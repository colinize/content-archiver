[00:00] Where is my happening? Where are all the cowboys go?

[00:07] Let's go.

[00:14] It's becoming a ghost town out there in the Pinball Podcasting world.

[00:18] Where is everybody going? Where are the episodes? It's like me and the poor man's Pinball Podcast and one pinball show from Zach Manian and Dennis.

[00:26] Well, happy belated birthday to Mr. Zach Manian by the way. If you didn't wish him one, it's too late.

[00:31] Zach, happy birthday brother. Okay.

[00:33] So on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcasts, I'm going to interview someone who's going to tell you a story about buying a Pinball machine that is crazy.

[00:41] You just have to listen to it. I've never heard anyone go through this. Just buying a Pinball machine. His name is Drew.

[00:47] I think you're going to enjoy it. I don't think you're going to expect where it goes and where it ends up.

[00:52] But crazy, crazy, crazy. Anything else going on in the Pinball world?

[00:56] Jack Danger, the man himself, streamed spooky pinballs Rick and Morty.

[01:01] So if you haven't seen a good stream of Rick and Morty, go check out DeadFlips stream of the game. It's great.

[01:08] Jack was on the machine for hours. Now I'll say this. I'll say this. I spoke to Jack after the stream and he said this game is just so addictive.

[01:17] Out of all the games in his lineup, he keeps going back to Rick and Morty and just can't get enough of it.

[01:23] And you can tell it's the kind of game where if you're really good at Pinball, which Jack is, that it sort of just pulls you in.

[01:31] It's not super easy. He was able to hit that upper loop shot. He was.

[01:36] Someone made a gif of him, handing it twice in a row and then hitting the garage shot. But I will say this.

[01:41] They ball did rattle around a lot. But Jack said that when you really dial it in, the game is very enjoyable.

[01:50] But everyone who's watched Rick and Morty, if you watch the stream of the game, the thing people are talking about is not the shot geometry.

[01:59] It's not the mechanisms in the game. In fact, every time I watch this game, I feel like another mechanism is removed from it.

[02:06] There's like no mechs in this game whatsoever. There are like no toys in this game whatsoever.

[02:12] There's nothing really to pinpoint and say, wow, did you see what they did there other than the incredible integration and fun factor and personality of this game.

[02:25] This game is like, it's like a girl you know that you just always want to hang out with every day.

[02:30] And you can't quite put your finger on why you like are so excited about her.

[02:36] It's not, it's not like she's stunningly attractive. It's not her wardrobe. It's not her jokes. It's just something about the addictive quality of this game.

[02:45] And that's what Rick and Morty is and it's a girl with an expletive R rated vernacular because this game curses at you.

[02:53] And it's, I think, I think the easiest way to describe it, it just feels like a game that's got the best call outs and the best light show of any pinball machine ever wrapped in a great theme.

[03:05] I will never, in a million years, I will never go to bat and tell you that this is the ultimate world under glass.

[03:12] I will never go to bat and tell you that this layout is spectacular.

[03:16] I will never go to bat and say the art package is out of this world. But what this machine does right? It does so damn right.

[03:25] What it does wrong? You can live with. I don't think there's anything in this game that says no because of that. I won't buy it.

[03:31] Okay. So definitely go check out that dead flip stream. Stern has new code coming out.

[03:37] 888 today of stranger things. I care about this point eight eight. That's it. I don't even care. Like these like slow burns to finish a game.

[03:47] And I put something sarcastic up on Jared's Facebook page because he's like new code today point. It's like zero point eight eight point zero.

[03:56] And I'm like, oh my god, Stern, you did it. You got point eight eight code out there on a game that's been out for four months.

[04:03] And we're still a long way away from the game being finished. I'm so sick and tired of the celebration by the Stern fanboys and the Stern army as they celebrate the fact that the game they bought four months ago is still not done.

[04:20] But is closer to being done. What a moment. What a glorious moment of celebrations during pinball. You once again succeed it in selling grown adults toys that are not complete.

[04:31] And they will be maybe within a year. It's pathetic. I really do think it's pathetic. At least the other manufacturers out there are shipping games with code.

[04:41] Now think now talking about shipping games with code. We know there's a machine that is built. We know there is a machine that has been brought to a trade show. Where's hot wheels?

[04:52] Why if hot wheels? This is what I don't get. If hot wheels is for sale by distributors. Why has an American pinball given hot wheels to a streamer like Jack danger to show the game off to the world.

[05:08] Order banks are open. Distributors will take your money. We know they have working machines. I am challenging American pinball to do this. I think they're stalling. I think they're stalling. Mr. Joe Balser and Mr. Josh Cougler will be appearing on Christopher Franchise. Super duper awesome spectacular extra extraordinary pinball show. The next show they air. So there's that.

[05:33] I offered to go on that show. They won't let me on it. They won't let me on the show. It seems there's for some reason one of their members does not like canada.

[05:44] It's not Mr. Franchise. Him and I get along. Now you got a 50-50 guess on who I don't even know what I did. I don't even know what I did to the guy. Do I rub people the wrong way?

[05:54] Does canada like this? Does he annoy people in pinball? I don't get it. I'm such a nice guy. Anyway, let's air this interview. I think you'll enjoy it. Everyone this has been episode like 478. We're still going to do shows. We're still going to entertain you. Enjoy. We'll talk to you soon.

[06:12] I want to welcome to canada's pinball podcast a person out there who's had a very interesting pinball experience that I've never heard before on any pinball podcast drew Sloan drew welcome to the show. Hey, buddy. How's it going?

[06:27] It's going as good as I guess it can go right now. How are you doing? Are you surviving the pandemic lockdown? Where are you at? What state? What's your situation?

[06:36] I'm fortunate enough where I still have an income and I understand that some people don't but I'm definitely not one of those you know, hooray for me and forget everybody else. So it's it's concerning. But you know, we're trying to make the best of it, I guess, you know. What state are you in? I'm on Long Island.

[06:55] Okay, so you're you're near me. You're you're on the Long Island Expressway, which is usually a parking lot is now now the new fast and the furious race track. All I hear are exotic cars going around New York City these days. It's a car lover's dream time.

[07:09] It's definitely odd because you're so used to the traffic just as a norm. I could tell you this. It's definitely picked up. I you know would speak to my mother who's at a state.

[07:22] And I would say last week and a little before the expressway when when I was traveling on it, I would see maybe two three cars had to meet two three cars behind me. Whereas now I do start to see some volume, but definitely nowhere near what you know, it was.

[07:39] Well, and because this is not called canators expressway podcast. Let's talk pinball. So Drew, you hit me up because you had something happen to you that I teed up already that I've never heard happen to anyone who is buying a pinball machine. I want you to just tell this story because I think it's it's a really eye opening tail. And you want to just take it away. Should we start it? Let's start to be getting because let's let people tell it as it happened. Sure. I mean, let's just a little background without giving.

[08:09] Too much information. I buy and sell pinball machines. I typically look for machines that are broken for non working or non shops and try to buy them at a lower rate and sell them at a higher rates. Part of the business.

[08:23] So typically the phone call that I would get is, you know, my brother has a white water.

[08:31] It's in his basement. It doesn't work or I have this machine and you know, it turns on, but it does this does that. That's 99.9% of my phone calls is is that type of scenario.

[08:44] And when I first got this phone call, it was the first time anyone had called me offering a new and box pinball for sale being someone who sort of myself in the business.

[08:58] I'm not one of the big dogs usually average say 40 machines a year. So I do it for half a living.

[09:06] And where do people find you? Where? How would someone know that you're a guy who's trading in pinball?

[09:12] I mean, I have a Facebook page. I have a following a lot of word of mouth. There are a lot of people who I found want a machine, but they're scared. They are scared because if they buy it and then something happens and then what do I do?

[09:28] So I typically always in this rounding area, I tell my customers that listen, just just give us a call. It's not a problem. When I do get people from outside my area, I let them know, look, eventually you may need some maintenance.

[09:42] You might want to find a local guy. Okay. But I thought a bulletproof my machines as much as possible. And I found that a lot of people have kind of come back or referred where they've had a good experience.

[09:55] And they were like, you know, what so and so game your number and kind of kind of like that. I guess we do advertise your your your known. And so you get a phone call and someone wants to sell you a new inbox machine. Does that happen very often?

[10:10] Never, never, never. And it was it was actually another guy who I kind of work with he has a website and they must have found him online as they called him. He then had called me. He's a little bit older. He's not.

[10:25] He'll do repairs, but he's done kind of holding games and doing all that. So he kind of referred him. Yeah, what was the machine that they wanted to sell you new inbox?

[10:36] Initially, the phone call, I believe they had said a monster's and a Beatles and I kind of told them, I don't really know what you could really give them to me for.

[10:48] I need to be interested in. But then it kind of the conversation grew from there where it was like, what else do you have? And it, you know, then turned into well iron man and those busters and Jurassic Park. And there seemed to be kind of a variety.

[11:03] Now, my alarm initially went off when I hear new inbox because it never happens. The thing that threw me off where the prices were not that great.

[11:13] So initially what knee jerk reaction? Are they stolen? That's first question that I'm going to think of. But when I hear the price that he's offering, my my analysis of the situation is this is not a stolen price. Somebody who, you know, has stolen these once again, rid of them.

[11:28] You're going to get them for a lot cheaper. That wasn't the situation at all. So how much was he asking for the titles that made you feel that way?

[11:38] Initially, he was at 4500 for a pro. And I kind of told them it's really not for me. I mean, and then he came down. So it ended up getting down to around 4,000, 3,700 around there, which is a pretty good price.

[11:57] And that for monsters or iron man. That was pretty much for any pro, any pro version. So it's like, I got any pro stern for 37 to 4th out.

[12:07] Okay, so this and that's where it ended up after haggling and back and forth and not interested. Okay. So then what happens next?

[12:14] Then this was the this was the real head scratcher because I went and picked up two games. I did not have one single problem. The guy was super nice.

[12:26] The machines were as described open them up. They were perfect. No issues. And I thought, okay, and just kind of little side note.

[12:35] This was kind of happening as the coronavirus was was just starting to kind of break out. So my another part of my thinking was, I know what this guy's doing.

[12:47] He's trying to liquidate pinball machines and get cash because of the fear of what's coming. Right.

[12:54] You know what I mean? And I kind of walked into my head where I was like, well, he's probably a distributor and he can't sell him for cheap because all the other distributors aren't going to like them.

[13:04] So he's trying to find a way to liquidate inventory. Okay. So you pick up two games successfully. Which two games do you buy from this gentleman?

[13:12] Ghostbusters pro and iron man pro and games are as described new in box and you're feeling good. And where is this guy located?

[13:22] Well, I don't know. According to him, the games were near Albany and he said that he would have he never showed up. He said, I'll send you know one of my guys down, which I did.

[13:36] It was a rented you all truck guy came down. So it's tough. He could be from near the Albany area. I do know not to kind of disclose too much.

[13:46] But I do know that there are other people that have gotten taken the same way that that I did and kind of get into it further. I guess the you know the next step was basically this guy.

[13:58] But true before you go on. So just so people listening. So you buy two games. You arrange for two games. The you all comes down to Long Island to sell you these two games. And they're there. And that's how it went down at the beginning.

[14:11] That's how I'm down at the beginning. No problem. So then what happens next next. I'm trying to get text messages from the initial guy spoke to and he you know always telling me while I'm looking for someone to take a lot of machines told them initially.

[14:25] I don't have any problem with that, but I just met you. I said, so let's start with two. And then we'll go from there. So we had had a deal set up for around close to about $50,000.

[14:38] And at the last minute because of the coronavirus, I pulled the plug on it and said can't do it. How many games were in that $50,000? You want two games, which is a roughly around eight grand of 50,000 next.

[14:53] Well, this this was support. You know, Willy Wonka collected edition. Willy Wonka limited edition. What else was in the list? Elvira premium. So there was kind of so the value was there.

[15:05] But Drew, I got to ask you as the coronavirus is starting to become part of culture and the pending potential shutdowns and stock market crashes. What are you doing pump in 50 grand into pinball machines? Why don't you know something we don't know.

[15:21] That's why I kind of came to my senses and said, I'm not doing this. I did have another person in with me on it. So there was two of us and it was kind of like you take this one. I'll take this one. You take this one. I'll take this one.

[15:34] But even even if you cut it in half, pump in 25,000 in it just it kind of I looked around and said, this is not the time.

[15:43] And Drew, just so I know your plan if you if you acquire these games is to do what with them is it to sell them for a little bit more and make some money or is it to keep them like what what do you need to do with all these games?

[15:54] I'm keeping the Elvira because I played it and I kind of liked it.

[15:58] What was the price for Elvira that you can't just go to a distributor and get it without any anxiety on that particularly deal. It was I believe just over four.

[16:10] For you know, Vira premium. Yeah, which is red flag city. No.

[16:15] A little bit. I guess because of the volume I figured and again, we didn't start there. It was, you know, listen, I'm taking this amount.

[16:24] It was a lot of haggling and and and keep pulling and saying no and back and forth under price. So.

[16:31] Okay. So this this big deal falls through and then what happens next? You meet somewhere in the middle with a deal?

[16:38] No, basically he kind of kept on me and I just kept kind of blowing them off and then the way that worked out is kind of struck up another deal but nowhere near as large and the way that I kind of had it set up was was really only getting two games.

[16:58] So and I had one of them pre sold. So I had a customer who said if you get this, I will buy it. So now the risk factor goes down because you you're getting one game. You have it sold profits there.

[17:12] And even if you're sitting on another one, nobody deal. What were the games? What were the games that one you had sold?

[17:19] And what was the they'll buy a premium and the other one was it might have been, I believe, Jurassic Park.

[17:28] Okay. And so then what happens? So we kind of again, we re renegotiate, we get to a price. It's nowhere near the deal that we had, but it's kind of like, okay, whatever.

[17:40] And this time we were told, well, if you want the games, you this is where you have to go. And it was up near Albany. It was, I believe, water, valet.

[17:50] Okay. So you got to come his way. And how much is this deal now from 50,000 to how much money?

[17:57] This deal was, I believe it is yes. It had, yes, 16,000.

[18:04] Okay. For how many games?

[18:06] For either 16 or 20. Actually, no, I'm sorry. I apologize. It was 23,000. And I believe it was four games.

[18:14] Four games. Okay. And you got to go north to get them. Okay. So and then what happens? You and a friend are going in on this and you're going up north.

[18:22] Yeah, we take a ride to me. Nobody deal. I've driven, you know, Long Island Pittsburgh, Long Island, Maryland to go an hour and a half, whatever it was.

[18:32] It might have been a little longer, but regardless, piece of cake. So we head up and we go to meet again. I'm, you know, I get from the guy I spoke to on sending one of my guys.

[18:43] Well, no big deal because you told me that last time and everything was fine. So show up.

[18:48] And I did when I got there and I kind of assessed the situation I had, I was starting to kind of figure out what was going on.

[18:59] And by the time my brain put it together, it was a little bit too late.

[19:03] Walk us through this. Like what, what happens? Where are you, where are you meeting? Is it a parking lot? Like what do you pull up to when you get to the spot?

[19:09] I went to a, and I looked it up before I went, it was like a storage house. It had big giant garage doors like come up now, not like a house garage door, but, you know, like you'd see on like a firehouse almost like a warehouse place that you might find a pimp on machine.

[19:25] It was not like a regular house. It was not so that's what we pull up to when the guy is telling us back to trailer up to the door. Okay.

[19:33] And when things really went wrong in my mind was when the guy said, well, I just need to make sure the money is correct.

[19:41] And he said this before we even went in the building. And that it, that immediately was like wait a second, like, you know, you think I'm here to stiff you like.

[19:52] Because I started to now ask questions, I think they realized their plan was going wrong and they both pulled out two guns and basically had held us up at gunpoint to take our cash.

[20:06] What is going through your mind at that point as these guys are pointing two guns at you during a pinball deal?

[20:13] Yeah. So I have a tendency to remain very calm during stressful situations. I was able to size up that these guys were young and that they were actually believe it or not nervous.

[20:27] What was their appearance? What was their demeanor as this thing was going down?

[20:31] I mean, as we first showed up, it was just kind of how's it going? It was, you know, nothing really, nothing really jumped out.

[20:38] As they pulled out the guns, the one kid that I saw screaming, get back, get back, get back. And he's kind of yelling at me.

[20:46] I'm standing there and in the next breath, he's asking me for the money.

[20:51] Okay.

[20:52] So I'm trying to tell him because I'm now out of the vehicle. I said, I can't get back and get you the money at the same time. The money is in the vehicle.

[20:59] You could tell they did were nervous. I mean, I don't know if that makes sense, but they were it almost made me feel like, I don't want to say it was their first time doing it, but they were just very on edge.

[21:12] And that made me a little nervous because my thinking is, I don't want this kid to do anything stupid. Like I'm remaining calm. You want money?

[21:19] It's okay to be a little nervous when someone's pointing a freaking gun at your head as you're trying to buy a pinball machine. Have you ever had a gun pointed at you before?

[21:27] No, no.

[21:30] Most people have it. I'd be beyond nervous if someone had a gun at my head screaming, get back. And so what happens then?

[21:37] You go back in the, is the money in the truck at this point?

[21:40] The money is in the truck. Thankfully, we had how money separated. So the guy that I was with handed him his envelope and once they saw the cash, they ran.

[21:51] Okay. So they grabbed that and run and how much was in that envelope?

[21:54] How much was in that envelope? So that, that, that was 16,000. And then I had another eight or so. So that's where the total numbers might have been money in the beginning, but the total was around, you know, 24,000 or so.

[22:11] So he gave him his envelope. They saw cash. They ran. And that was pretty much the end of it. You guys gave him the wrong envelope.

[22:20] Well, you should have the guy I was with. He didn't know where my money was. So he just said that's all I got.

[22:27] Well, and look, this is crazy. I mean, like nobody wants to have their life on the line to buy pinball machines. And so what I'm curious about what happens next?

[22:38] I mean, are you guys on the phone and 911 right away? Like what, what did you guys do?

[22:43] I told the guy I was with, you know, we need to call the police. He kind of just wanted to go home. He wanted nothing to do with it.

[22:51] I ended up phoning the police the next day. I then turned to him because of the amount of money he lost. And because he is also a friend, I said, look, I said, you lost 16.

[23:04] I said, I'll give you eight. And then that way we're both down 8,000. It makes it a little even you wouldn't be here without me kind of makes it don't want to lose 8,000.

[23:13] But, you know, I didn't want to turn to him. They're like, oh, well, that sucks. They got your money. Oh, well, see you.

[23:18] I mean, I can imagine this guy that's post traumatic stress. I can't imagine. I understand why he's like, I want nothing to do with this. I never want to relieve this moment.

[23:28] Like it's probably one of the most the worst moments of his life. And I know calling the cops is hard. And when you are assaulted or you are robbed, there is a reaction by victims to not want to deal with it.

[23:41] And so you called the cops and then what happens there?

[23:44] Well, I mean, I kind of told them what happened. And I said if nothing else, it's one thing about the people of community is it is a small community.

[23:54] So, in coming on your show, talking about it, first and foremost, just to warn anyone else. If you get a phone call like this, if something like this happens to, you know, definitely air on the side of caution.

[24:09] And to know that this is what's happening around the Albany New York, you know, Long Island area.

[24:15] So Drew, I have to ask, I have to ask, I mean, who, who is this guy that sold you two games legitimately. And then on a second sale, he's got his guys holding you up at gunpoint.

[24:28] Yeah. So my best analysis of the situation because he did from the very beginning, I kind of went through my text messages and very early on, he said, I'm looking for someone to spend up to 60,000 or whatever his message was.

[24:44] But you know who he is, like, is he a member of the community? I highly doubt it. If my guess is someone is a driver who was able to knock off a few pills. I mean, obviously now I have a pretty good idea that they're probably stolen.

[25:00] You know, so it has to be someone who's a driver or someone who works in that end. I definitely don't take him as a pinball guy.

[25:11] What was his name that he gave you? Do you have his full name? I have his first name, but I could guarantee it's fake.

[25:18] Do you have his, can we put his number out on the air? So nobody ever picks up? Yeah, I mean, we can do that. He went by the name of Mike.

[25:27] He went by the name of Mike. Now what's Mike's number? Let's see if I can access it without losing you. Hold on one second.

[25:34] You know, if you guys want to prank all this asshole at three in the morning, let's let's let this guy know.

[25:40] It's interesting enough. It is a seven, one eight number, which, you know, it's new year.

[25:45] It's a new year, right? But the number is seven, one eight, seven, three, seven, three, three, nine, zero.

[25:53] Okay. And that's not Hilton's number, right? No, it's not. I'm just joking.

[25:57] So this is crazy. So you've never seen this guy. He says his name is Mike.

[26:03] The first deal goes down. Second deal ends up with two guns pointed at you guys. And then after this deal, you know, I'm assuming you never hear from this guy again, right?

[26:13] When you're like, hey, that was great. Thanks for sticking us out.

[26:16] No, his phone was off. I haven't tried since, you know, whether it was a burner phone or he disconnected the number.

[26:24] This is probably a pretty good chance. I did try to text them and see if you respond, which you did not.

[26:33] It's crazy that there were two legitimate games at the beginning. It's like it's so crazy that this guy is using pinball machines to hustle someone to a big score or a big robbery.

[26:43] I will tell you this when I did talk to one of the detectives and I gave him some information asked because the question came up.

[26:52] How much does a pinball machine cost? And when I started talking about different games and what they go for, he was like, you got to be kidding me.

[27:01] Yeah, you're like detective a pirate to the Caribbean collectors edition is $21,000 and he's just like, yeah, just effing losers.

[27:11] Yeah, so the cops are involved. Did you say Drew are the FBI involved? This guy's done this before. Where is it at right now?

[27:18] So this doesn't happen again. Yeah, I mean they're aware. I don't know how much information, you know, I should be giving out now or should be, you know, as far as, you know, that's concerned.

[27:30] So do they feel like they know who it is? I mean, I don't want you to release sensitive information as, but do they have they identified the individual or are they still looking?

[27:39] I think they're hot on the trail. Okay. And they and this guy's done this before, right? They said that this you're not the first.

[27:48] So the story I got was there was other people who someone had gotten taken for a cactus canyon. I don't know all the exact details.

[27:59] I heard a little bit about it. It doesn't really involve me. So I don't want to say too much, but that was the title that was attached to it.

[28:08] And apparently there there are others. I know that these guys have contacted other people. And again, I don't think they realize how small the people world really is.

[28:18] And that's why I figured if I could at least get the word out at the very least, warn other people and, you know, not have them have to go through this because they're they're praying on your desires.

[28:31] Absolutely. I mean, look, it's they're taking advantage of someone's enthusiasm to buy an item that they really want, which is Pimple machines. And what's crazy is if this happened to me, I think a lot of you out there who listen to the show, this happened to any of us.

[28:47] I might never return to Pimple. I mean, it's the mental anguish of having a gun pointed at you and what's crazy about these robbers to true. They didn't they had no idea that you guys didn't have a gun inside your truck. If you're going to pull a gun on someone, there's a good chance they might use it because how do you know someone else is not going to protect themselves and that's why they were shaking too.

[29:12] I mean, this is insane. I I'm glad we got the word out because I think a lot of the lessons from this deal drew. It's like don't do deals with people you don't know, which is like rule number one, right? And it's always, but we live in a world in which people have Pimple machines all over the country than many of us do do deals.

[29:31] But if you're going to travel somewhere with cash, right, you had to be really careful.

[29:39] And in the cops said he goes, listen, he goes, next time this happens because he, you know, I gave him a little bit of background about me. He said, look, call call up the local police department and say, hey, listen, I'm buying the machine, I have a lot of money. Let them send up tro, they're like, we don't, you know, there's not doing anything wrong. You're buying a Pimple machine, call up, have them send us, we'll send us the squad car and we'll just sit and walk.

[30:00] and we'll just sit and watch.

[30:01] That's really great advice.

[30:03] I don't think most people would think to do that,

[30:05] that you could basically get a police escort

[30:08] when you're about to drop 24k.

[30:10] I mean, the cops would make fun of you.

[30:12] Here's the thing though,

[30:13] like I could see all these people doing it,

[30:14] and then cops would just sit in there

[30:15] and be like, look at these out of shape white men,

[30:19] trading pinball machines for half of my annual salary.

[30:24] What the f in my new and wrong in life?

[30:27] That's what they be witnessing 99% of the time.

[30:30] But that is great advice.

[30:31] And so Drew, right now,

[30:34] like walking away from this experience,

[30:37] has it deterred you at all?

[30:38] Are you just like, have you gotten over it?

[30:40] You seem like you're pretty cool for a guy who's staring

[30:44] down a barrel of a gun to sell pinball machines.

[30:48] Yeah, I mean, I didn't always,

[30:50] I wasn't always in the pinball.

[30:51] So I grew up on Long Island

[30:53] and I kind of grew up running around the streets

[30:57] and probably doing a lot of stuff I shouldn't have been doing.

[31:01] So it would take a little bit more than that to deter me.

[31:05] I've never, the worst experience I've had

[31:09] buying a pinball machine was one guy who quoted me one price

[31:14] and then when I showed up,

[31:15] after driving three hours, gave me a different price

[31:19] and the different price was not a lower price.

[31:21] Yeah, no, Drew, that is not worse than having a gun pointed

[31:25] at your head.

[31:26] But that's what I mean.

[31:28] I mean, it's honestly the experiences of having,

[31:32] I've enjoyed them, I've enjoyed people I've met and dealt with.

[31:36] And it's really been, it's been good.

[31:39] It really has.

[31:40] I mean, this is obviously a blemish,

[31:43] but whenever you're dealing with a lot of money,

[31:46] there's always going to be someone out there

[31:49] who's looking to take advantage of it.

[31:51] Right.

[31:52] And Drew, I want to thank you for coming on the show.

[31:54] And the reason we wanted to get the word out there

[31:57] is we want everyone to be careful.

[31:59] These are high price machines.

[32:02] I think sometimes, and Drew, you get this.

[32:04] You know, we don't really think about

[32:08] when we're spending $8,000, $12,000, $50,000 for pinball deals

[32:13] and it happens out there a lot, it's a lot of money.

[32:16] People will, and people will go to desperate measures

[32:19] to get their hands on your hard earned cash.

[32:22] So if you're going to do a pinball deal,

[32:25] then make sure you do your due diligence

[32:27] because someone will shoot you for $4,000 in this country.

[32:31] So it's not just the big deals that you have to worry about.

[32:35] And take that advice.

[32:37] Be safe, meet at a location you feel good about.

[32:40] Make sure you have background checks on people as much you can.

[32:43] And Drew, any other final words,

[32:45] I mean, this is just, I've never heard anyone get held up.

[32:49] And that's why when you told me, I was like,

[32:50] we gotta tell this story.

[32:52] Yeah, no, it's a shame.

[32:54] It really is, but it's like I said,

[32:57] it's looking back on it.

[32:59] Every other phone call has been like I described

[33:03] where I'll have a Cuba wizard to tap my uncle's house.

[33:07] I have this, to tap my father's house.

[33:09] I have this, you know, I have a whatever the game is.

[33:13] And you know, I've had it for 10 years.

[33:15] I've had it 15 years and they don't really use it anymore.

[33:17] By getting that phone call, my alarms,

[33:21] I'll put it to you like this.

[33:22] It won't happen again.

[33:24] Whoever this is knows the hobby, they know machines.

[33:28] It's not too hard.

[33:29] It's not too hard to acquire a list of games

[33:32] and a list of prices and understand a deal that seems really great.

[33:37] Right?

[33:38] Those were incredible prices.

[33:39] And that's another key takeaway for people.

[33:43] If it seems too good to be true,

[33:44] it probably is.

[33:46] And you really got to be careful.

[33:49] You know, next time maybe, you know,

[33:50] someone pulls a gun, maybe push a hot wheels in front of them

[33:53] and they'll run away without taking any cash.

[33:55] They'll just, that could be a deterrent.

[33:57] Oh man, the American Pimball fans,

[33:58] they're just gonna, they hate me so much.

[34:00] I won't stop.

[34:01] I won't stop.

[34:02] There's no look to loops.

[34:04] Well, Drew, I'm glad to hear that you made it out.

[34:06] Okay, is your friend doing all right?

[34:08] It sounds like he might have been more rattled than you.

[34:11] Yeah, I mean, I kind of checked up on him.

[34:14] We still kind of kept in touch.

[34:15] I think once the dust settles,

[34:17] you do get a little angry because the initial,

[34:20] I can't speak for myself, my initial response is losing $8,000

[34:25] is nothing compared to my life.

[34:27] And you can have it fortunate to be in a situation

[34:30] where that's not gonna banker up me

[34:32] and put me on the streets and all that.

[34:34] But he probably was.

[34:36] I think though you do get to a point

[34:39] where you kind of go through a little anger and resentment.

[34:41] Absolutely.

[34:42] You're violated.

[34:44] I mean, it is indescribable.

[34:47] The violation that happens when money is stolen.

[34:50] It's not like you were just stolen.

[34:52] There's a gun.

[34:53] Everything.

[34:54] Your life is threatened.

[34:55] Your money is stolen.

[34:56] You don't get your goods.

[34:58] And then how long was the drive home?

[34:59] Right?

[35:00] How in a half, two hour drive home when you've just been...

[35:02] The drive home sucked.

[35:04] The drive home was very depressing

[35:07] because you're just sitting there in silence

[35:09] and reflecting on what the hell just happened.

[35:13] But listen, you take it as a lesson

[35:16] and you learn from it if not, it's complete and total waste.

[35:20] And that's really all you can do

[35:21] and be thankful that you didn't end up in a hospital

[35:24] or a morgue and try to learn from it.

[35:27] Absolutely. Well, Drew, thank you so much

[35:29] for joining Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[35:31] Are you a frequent listener of the show?

[35:34] Yes, love the show, man.

[35:36] I love what you do.

[35:37] I definitely listen as much as I can.

[35:41] So keep up the good work.

[35:43] Thank you, thank you.

[35:44] Well, Drew, I appreciate you taking the time.

[35:47] Again, I'm sorry to you and your friend

[35:48] for having to go through this.

[35:50] But everyone out there, be careful.

[35:52] I think this story might be an extreme example

[35:55] of what can happen, but we always need to be careful

[35:58] when we're handling large amounts of money

[36:01] and we're putting trust into people.

[36:03] I don't even, Drew, I don't even trust people.

[36:06] Well, give me the accurate conditions of their games

[36:09] when I'm buying site unseen.

[36:11] That's a whole nother story.

[36:12] It's a whole nother story.

[36:14] I just don't trust anyone.

[36:15] You know who I trust distributors?

[36:17] So if there's another lesson here,

[36:19] if you want a game, there are a bunch of honest,

[36:23] hardworking distributors out there

[36:25] who will get you a game without any threat of your life.

[36:29] So no deal that is too good will probably happen for you.

[36:33] If you see $4,000 premiums out there, okay, people?

[36:36] Well, Drew, thank you so much, brother.

[36:38] Thank you, I'll talk to you soon.

[36:39] I love all the cowboys go.

[36:42] Let's do it.
