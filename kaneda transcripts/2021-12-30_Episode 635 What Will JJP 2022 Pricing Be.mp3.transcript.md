[00:00] Ah, welcome everybody, Happy Holidays from Pinside's favorite pinball podcaster, I'm your

[00:22] host, KineT.

[00:23] This is episode 635 of KineT's Pinball Podcast.

[00:27] I'm using the new microphone, it sounds great.

[00:30] And what I want to talk about on this episode is Rush Pinball.

[00:34] And what will the price be?

[00:36] I also want to talk about Jersey Jack Pinball.

[00:39] I think they're the most interesting company to think about going into 2022.

[00:45] Where do they price their games?

[00:48] They have seen the market go through the roof and they've seen stern titles that used to

[00:53] sell for $8,000.

[00:55] Now sell for $15,000 opened, right?

[01:00] These are not even new in box games.

[01:03] And I think Jersey Jack's 2022 pricing must be something that company is discussing at

[01:10] the boardroom table this week.

[01:12] I also got a funny email from Jersey Jack Pinball saying they did a year in review podcast

[01:18] of Jersey Jack Pinball and they did not talk about play field issues.

[01:23] They also, I think this was a response to KineT.

[01:25] They let everybody know that their year in review podcast is free.

[01:31] For some reason, this show and these club episodes are somewhat annoying everybody out there.

[01:37] Here's the thing, I know all you haters that listen, I want you guys to do me a favor.

[01:41] Explain this rationale to me.

[01:42] You complain that I'm a narcissist who just wants attention.

[01:46] I then take my show to club members only, which removes it from the mass airwaves.

[01:52] So why are you now still complaining?

[01:55] It makes no sense to me.

[01:56] The very people who say nobody should listen to KineT is Pinball podcast are the very gentlemen

[02:02] that want to consume every single episode.

[02:05] I love it.

[02:06] Now they have to pay five bucks and they're moaning and groaning like little babies.

[02:10] So look, we all know $5 is nothing, but you know what is not nothing?

[02:14] Someone is offering right now on pin side $15,000 for a Deadpool LE.

[02:21] This week we finally got confirmation that Rush Pinball is coming from Stern.

[02:25] Now what is that machine going to cost?

[02:27] It's going to have 17 Rush songs, 16 of which you've never heard of.

[02:33] No, I'm just kidding.

[02:34] But for Rush fans out there, this is a great thing to learn that there are going to be

[02:39] 17 tracks of your band or your favorite band in this pinball machine by John Borg.

[02:45] Okay.

[02:46] I don't know what the game is yet, but I am hearing a rumor that Stern Pinball is going

[02:51] to raise the price of every single LE machine.

[02:55] Now Godzilla was $10,500.

[02:58] What do you think Rush will cost?

[03:01] And if I'm Stern, I'm going to each of my distributors and I'm saying, okay, how many

[03:06] LE customers do you have that want an LE game?

[03:09] And then how long is your allocation list?

[03:12] And I bet that even at 1,000 units, there are still way more people that want every

[03:19] single new Stern LE than 1,000.

[03:23] And so Stern must be saying, okay, we could price it at 10,5 and then watch people flip

[03:29] these games immediately for 11,5 or 12,5 or 14,5 depending on how hot this game is.

[03:36] There is going to be a markup on every single game for people who missed out on the first

[03:43] 1,000 units.

[03:44] And I think Stern's probably, if I do guess what Stern will price this game at, I think

[03:49] we might see this game at $11,000.

[03:51] I think they're going to go another $500 upstream and they're going to keep doing this.

[03:56] I think a year from now, Stern LE's will be $12,500 and I think they will still sell

[04:05] every single one at that price point.

[04:08] Even though people will moan and groan, Stern knows that the demand for this product is

[04:12] hotter than it's ever been and they also know a very fundamental fact about wealthy people.

[04:19] And I know this upsets some of you out there, but they know that if you have $10,000 to

[04:25] spend on an unnecessary toy in which you already have a boatload of, these aren't like, oh,

[04:31] this is my first pen ever, I'm going to get an LE because if it is your first pen ever,

[04:35] you will never be able to get on an LE list from any distributor.

[04:39] So they know that.

[04:41] They know that these gentlemen who are buying these LE's for the most part, buy many LE's

[04:47] every year and they know that if you have 10, you have 10.5.

[04:52] If you have 10.5, you have 11.5, you have 12.5.

[04:55] They know that they can get this thing up and up and up and they want the money, right?

[05:00] They don't want scalpers and flippers to make that extra money.

[05:03] They are going to keep raising the prices.

[05:06] So I expect Rush to come in at $11,000.

[05:10] I do expect by the end of the year, we are going to see Stern LE's be closer to $12,500.

[05:16] Now a $12,500 Stern pinball machine in 2022-2023 seems crazy.

[05:25] Oh, and by the way, I reached out to CoinTaker.

[05:28] They're already sold out of Rush pinball machines.

[05:31] Nobody can get a Rush LE.

[05:33] Now I'm not getting one right now.

[05:34] I know that I could probably buy this game and flip it for some money, but I'm not a

[05:39] Rush fan.

[05:40] This isn't a game that I want to speculate on.

[05:43] I do think this game is going to sell out right away.

[05:46] I do think there are way more than a thousand Rush fans that are out there.

[05:51] This is a band that has sold 40 million albums.

[05:54] So even though for many of you out there, Rush is just a so-so title, it's going to

[05:59] sell out.

[06:00] Rush does have crossover with the pinball buying audience.

[06:04] This is a much better theme than Legends of Vahala.

[06:07] In the real world, Rush is a much better theme than Cactus Canyon.

[06:12] It's a much better pinball theme than even Deadpool.

[06:15] I mean it.

[06:16] This is a much better theme than a lot of those titles and they're going to have no

[06:20] problem whatsoever.

[06:22] The other thing that would make me feel really good about this game other than the 17 songs

[06:29] is knowing that John Borg is a huge Rush fanatic.

[06:34] When you get a designer that is lined up with something that he loves, that he is passionate

[06:40] about, you are going to get something very special.

[06:43] I expect this machine to have something very special, something very unique, and it will

[06:49] be a machine that I think Rush fans are going to be very, very fond of.

[06:54] Will it have crossover appeal?

[06:56] Will this have people who don't like Rush saying, I want to have that pinball machine?

[07:01] Well, that's going to come down to the features and the gameplay of the machine itself.

[07:06] But if you're like me and I don't really like Rush, I don't dislike them, I just don't

[07:13] play their music.

[07:14] Their music is not part of my life.

[07:16] It hasn't been part of my life for 45 years and it's not going to start being part of

[07:21] my life.

[07:22] I don't feel like I'm missing out because I have so many bands I love.

[07:27] I like ACDC way more than Rush.

[07:29] I like Metallica way more than Rush.

[07:32] I have Rush up with Iron Maiden.

[07:34] I don't like Iron Maiden.

[07:36] I don't like Rush.

[07:37] I love Guns N' Roses.

[07:39] Guess what?

[07:40] Different strokes for different folks.

[07:43] Music pins sell.

[07:44] They sell very well.

[07:46] There's a reason why because pinball and music just go together.

[07:51] If you're over at Jersey Jack Pinball though, you know that Guns N' Roses has been a sales

[07:57] success.

[07:58] You undersold your Guns N' Roses Collectors Edition.

[08:01] They sold out right away and they saw people trading them for $18,000 to $20,000 right away.

[08:08] Jersey Jack has seen Willy Wonka's CEs go for Over Sticker.

[08:13] They've seen the ridiculous prices of Pirates of the Caribbean Collectors Edition.

[08:18] So I want to ask all of you.

[08:20] If you're over at Jersey Jack Pinball and you're watching this market, you're watching

[08:25] people say, I will spend $15,000 on a Deadpool LE.

[08:32] And guess what the scary part is?

[08:34] No one even offered to sell that guy their Deadpool LE for $15,000 which means it's worth

[08:41] even more than $15,000.

[08:44] And I think if you're Jersey Jack and you see all that you put into your games, you

[08:48] have to be saying to yourselves, look, this is the moment.

[08:52] This is the time in which we need to do what Canada has been saying since day one.

[08:58] We need to behave and act like the premium pinball company we are.

[09:03] We put more into each of our games.

[09:06] Our games are a higher level of craftsmanship.

[09:10] Even as I say that, I start to vomit in my mouth a little bit because of all the play

[09:14] field issues.

[09:15] But when you put a Jersey Jack machine next to a Stern machine, everybody would agree.

[09:20] Which one do you think costs more?

[09:22] It's just that simple.

[09:23] If you took 99 million people and surveyed them, put guns and roses next to Led Zeppelin

[09:30] and say, which one do you think costs more money?

[09:33] You would get 99.9999% of people would say the Jersey Jack machine looks like it should

[09:39] cost way more money.

[09:40] The only person that would vote for the Stern is someone named Gary Stern or George Gomez.

[09:46] So if you're Jersey Jack, you have to be saying, now's our time.

[09:50] It's not just that we put much more in than Stern does.

[09:53] It's the market is so hot.

[09:55] So where do you think Jersey Jack pinball goes with its pricing?

[10:00] And are they going to start creating more FOMO?

[10:03] Are they going to jack up both the price and the volume of games?

[10:07] Now if you're them, how do you not learn from Stern's move?

[10:11] They made a thousand Godzilla Ellie's and they raised the price and they all sold out.

[10:17] So I firmly expect Jersey Jack pinball to increase the number of collectors editions

[10:24] of Toy Story from 500 to 1000 units.

[10:28] I also expect them to do a Buzz edition and a Woody edition 500 of each.

[10:35] I also expect them to do a price increase.

[10:38] Now here's the part where canade is going to say something that pisses a lot of people

[10:43] off.

[10:44] Do I think Jersey Jack pinball should price their collectors editions at $15,000 or should

[10:51] they go higher?

[10:52] I don't think they're ever going to price it at 12.5 again.

[10:55] They would be giving it away.

[10:57] And we know that the cost of manufacturing has gone up.

[11:00] I don't think 12.5 will ever be seen again.

[11:04] So if you ever bought a collector's edition 412.5 of GNR or Wonka or any other game out

[11:11] there, congratulations, your game is going to keep going up in value.

[11:15] I expect them to do it at 15.

[11:17] But I also, if I were in that boardroom with them, I also think they could go even higher.

[11:22] I really do.

[11:23] I think we're at a point now where people have made so much money in the real world

[11:29] with their real jobs and with crypto millionaires and stocks going through the roof.

[11:34] Even though there's inflation eating away at all of our savings, it doesn't matter.

[11:39] The men they are going after on a global level could drop, again, it's just the rationale.

[11:45] If you could drop 15K, could you drop 20K?

[11:50] And the market has shown us that people will do that.

[11:54] And remember, a Jersey Jack collector's edition comes with a topper.

[11:59] It comes with usually a really nice package.

[12:03] They give you different playfield artwork with the gold sparkle.

[12:06] They give you more in their collector's edition than Stern does in their LE.

[12:13] Jersey Jack always loads their games.

[12:16] Now I think 15K is where it's going to land.

[12:19] And I know they could go higher, but again, you don't want to like go too high.

[12:23] They're not going to go to 20 grand.

[12:24] They're not going to go to 17.5.

[12:26] So Canada is predicting that Jersey Jack will price their collector's editions at $15,000.

[12:33] And what I want to know from each of you out there, each of you, 323 club members, oh,

[12:38] Canada, you lost your relevance.

[12:40] You lost your audience.

[12:42] Are you still going to do the show?

[12:43] Oh, yeah.

[12:44] What am I doing right now?

[12:45] I love doing this show.

[12:47] And that's what burns the haters.

[12:48] I just love doing the show.

[12:49] I love that I've made it harder for me to win a Twippy.

[12:52] Are we still going to win a Twippy?

[12:54] I think so.

[12:55] Anyway, I think you're going to see a thousand of them at $15,000 each.

[13:01] And if it is Toy Story, it is already sold out.

[13:04] If you are listening to this and you are not on the list for the next Jersey Jack CE, it

[13:10] is probably too late unless one thing happens, unless Jersey Jack Pinball sells this game

[13:16] directly.

[13:17] Now, will they do that again?

[13:19] That is the other interesting part of this.

[13:22] If they sell it directly, they will make more money on each sale, but they will really burn

[13:29] their distributors unless they jack up the volume, right?

[13:33] 500 GNR CEs was not enough at all.

[13:37] And 1,000 Toy Story CEs, I'm going to say this, 1,000 Toy Story collectors' editions

[13:43] are not enough.

[13:44] I think Toy Story will be Jersey Jack Pinball's greatest selling machine of all time.

[13:50] I think they are really excited about it.

[13:53] I think it's going to be a masterpiece from Pat Lawler.

[13:56] I think he's seen his first two titles come out and they really didn't come out and hit

[14:02] hard.

[14:03] And I think this game is going to hit hard.

[14:05] And I think this game is going to fire on all cylinders.

[14:08] It's not going to come out and be incomplete like Ultraman.

[14:12] Have you seen what's happening with Ultraman lately?

[14:15] In Ultraman, with the butter cabinet, which is a $10,000 machine, cannot even sell for

[14:22] like $89.95.

[14:25] And this is just a game that is continuing to sink in confidence and sink in price.

[14:32] And like I said in my year in review show, I think Spooky Pinball is learning a really

[14:37] harsh lesson.

[14:39] They had seven to eight years to get this right and know what people want it and what

[14:43] they came out with, with incomplete this and incomplete that and multi-boss.

[14:49] I think Spooky completely has missed the mark with these games right now.

[14:53] And I also think people just don't care to see where these games go.

[14:57] And anyone who thinks these games are going to end up like Rick and Morty, you're fooling

[15:01] yourselves.

[15:02] There is not the demand for Ultraman and Halloween that there was for Rick and Morty.

[15:07] Rick and Morty is a much more popular theme than both of those titles.

[15:12] Rick and Morty has some of the best theme integration when it comes to software ever

[15:17] in the history of pinball.

[15:18] Let me repeat that.

[15:19] That Rick and Morty from a theme integration is one of the greatest theme integrated pinball

[15:25] machines ever.

[15:26] You've got the founder of Rick and Morty doing the best pinball call outs ever.

[15:30] You got Scott Denise's light show.

[15:32] You've got all the clips from the show that you love.

[15:35] You've got the voices from the actors that you love.

[15:37] And then you turn to Ultraman and you're like, I don't even know this show.

[15:41] I've never even seen this show.

[15:43] This doesn't even connect with me.

[15:45] And then you look at Halloween and there's barely any clips in it.

[15:48] People are moving away from these games so quickly.

[15:51] And that is it, man.

[15:52] This isn't Canadian ragging on this.

[15:55] That is a game up for sale in the hottest pinball market we've ever seen.

[16:00] And people are losing a thousand to $2,000 on their games already.

[16:05] And what does that say to the people at the end of the line like me?

[16:07] It means your games are going to keep going down in value.

[16:10] I'm sorry.

[16:11] I don't think this thing gets turned around.

[16:12] I don't.

[16:13] I think they underestimated the expectations of this community.

[16:18] And it's kind of ironic because they built up people's expectations.

[16:22] And then I think they delivered something that isn't even close to what people expect

[16:27] for $10,000.

[16:28] Am I wrong?

[16:29] Am I right?

[16:30] Is this still Canada's pinball podcast?

[16:32] Or are we irrelevant?

[16:33] Oh man, you know, someone said to me last night, they're like, Canada, you are now irrelevant.

[16:37] Okay.

[16:38] Well, I do a pinball podcast.

[16:40] I'm just entertaining and I speak my mind and I don't want ads and I don't want sponsors.

[16:45] And how is this show now irrelevant?

[16:48] I think people are always going to want to hear what Canada has to say about this hobby.

[16:52] I look forward to talking to you about what's going on in the hobby.

[16:55] And I think these discussions are fun.

[16:57] I really do feel bad for the people that get really nasty and lob all these personal attacks.

[17:03] For five years, I've never made anybody listen to the show.

[17:07] If you enjoy this show, the barrier to entry is the cheapest thing in all of pinball.

[17:13] All right.

[17:14] Now, speaking of cheap things in pinball, have you seen these like Stern insider connected

[17:18] aprons they're selling now?

[17:20] Now by the way, I hear that they can't offer it for Mandalorian right now because there's

[17:24] some physical part on the Mandalorian game that is interfering with the apron and how

[17:30] it needs to be set up for the insider connected mechanism.

[17:34] I also heard that Jersey Jack pinball has the patent to put the QR code on the screen.

[17:39] That's why Stern had to do what they did with the apron.

[17:42] I also, when I'm looking at these things, I think they look pretty bobo.

[17:46] I think these aprons need to be customized and personalized for each game.

[17:52] I think if you buy one for Deadpool, the artwork around the QR code thing should be done by

[17:58] Zambietti and should be Deadpool related.

[18:00] But maybe Stern is just going to wait for the, you know, the mod community to do that.

[18:04] It definitely looks pretty just like basic and kind of ugly.

[18:08] It needs to have like artwork for the game.

[18:09] Godzilla's got that right.

[18:10] The Godzilla QR code area is all Godzilla artwork.

[18:14] I'm also hearing this week that Stern is shipping Elvira 40th anniversary editions to people.

[18:20] So if you are one of the lucky rich few who decided to spend $10,000 more than 15 grand

[18:26] and bought one from your distributor and you feel happy about it.

[18:29] Congratulations.

[18:30] You just told Stern Pimball that the ceiling is nowhere near 15K and you're going to make

[18:35] it worse for all of us.

[18:36] No, it's a beautiful game.

[18:38] I walked by that Elvira 40th.

[18:40] It is a stunning machine.

[18:42] If you're getting one, I won't lie.

[18:43] I'm a little bit envious because it is probably the sexiest Stern Pimball machine of all time.

[18:50] Without a doubt is at Elvira 40th.

[18:52] So for each and every one of you getting one, congratulations.

[18:55] There are only 199.

[18:58] I think they will always hold their value because I hear nothing but good things about

[19:02] this game.

[19:03] You know, when you think about like what kind of games does it make sense to put into your

[19:07] lineup?

[19:08] I would argue if I were going to collect games and I wanted to have the best Pimball experiences

[19:13] on the planet, I would argue that collecting everything Lyman sheets has done in the Pimball

[19:19] world would be the way to go.

[19:21] And if you bought nothing but Lyman's games and Lyman's Stern machines, you would have

[19:26] a great lineup of games and nobody would argue against any of the titles in your collection.

[19:33] The Walking Dead, you would get ACDC, you would get Metallica, you would get Batman 66, you

[19:39] would get Elvira.

[19:40] There is way more than I'm missing.

[19:42] But this guy, he codes games like nobody else and when he left Stern, he left Stern because

[19:48] he was tired of Stern and he wanted to do it his way.

[19:51] And there was a lot of clashing going on between Stern and Lyman.

[19:55] It wasn't like an amicable split by any means.

[19:58] And he's still an independent contractor, but he will not be doing Stern games in the

[20:03] future.

[20:04] The only downside for him leaving when he left is he is a huge Rush fan.

[20:09] And I think everybody would have loved to have Lyman sheets on Rush making this Rush

[20:14] Pimball machine.

[20:15] And I know there's like rumors that he started the code, but no way.

[20:18] I mean, this game is not going to be done by Lyman sheets.

[20:20] You are not going to see his work on this machine at all.

[20:23] He might have given some insight into how the code should work and maybe the framework

[20:28] of the game, but I don't think you're going to see any of Lyman's touch on this machine

[20:32] itself.

[20:33] But I also think Stern Pimball's coding department has really upped their game tremendously.

[20:38] I mean, we're a very forgiving community though, because when I saw the animations for Rush,

[20:43] they look like PlayStation 1 animations.

[20:45] I love in Pimball when we spend all this money, we act like graphics and animations haven't

[20:52] evolved since like 1996.

[20:55] And we get these really crappy animations and then we say how amazing they are.

[21:00] No, they're pretty piss poor if you ask me.

[21:03] The best animations in all of Pimball are still over at Jersey Jack Pimball.

[21:08] Stern's stuff is so mediocre, but it's alright.

[21:11] But again, it does look like animations I saw on Gateway computers or PlayStation 1 when

[21:16] I look at games like Jurassic Park.

[21:18] Like it's not stellar.

[21:20] For Pimball, it works.

[21:21] But that owl flying around, that's in that teaser video for Rush, that's what we're

[21:25] going to get.

[21:26] More of that.

[21:27] If that excites you, I don't think you've played a video game in the last like 20 years.

[21:31] Alright, so it's going to be a fun week.

[21:33] We are going to see Rush Pimball, we're going to see Stern unveil it at a virtual CES.

[21:38] We are going to be talking about Rush for a while.

[21:42] It's already sold out.

[21:44] It's going to be a game that I still think will divide people.

[21:48] But John Borg designs are not that divisive.

[21:51] I don't think this game from a design standpoint is going to really make people angry.

[21:56] I do think this game is going to do just fine for Stern.

[22:00] I think people who love Rush are going to gobble them up and then I think we're going

[22:04] to move on to Venom, which is after this game.

[22:07] It's going to go Rush, Venom, then James Bond.

[22:10] I think James Bond is going to be a big one.

[22:13] And I also think that Back to the Future was a codename for Rush because Rush has like

[22:19] a time machine element to it.

[22:22] And I think Back to the Future is the codename for Rush.

[22:25] I don't think Keith Elwin is working on Back to the Future.

[22:28] I think Keith Elwin is probably working on Jaws.

[22:32] That is my guess.

[22:33] I also am hoping and praying after watching one of the worst movies ever, the New Matrix

[22:40] film.

[22:41] I'm hoping and praying that Jersey Jack Pinball is not making the Matrix.

[22:47] This franchise is beyond done.

[22:50] It had one good movie.

[22:52] If they make the Matrix, you're only going to want the Matrix original film.

[22:57] But the studio would make them put all four movies into the pinball machine, which would

[23:01] be horrible.

[23:03] And this last movie, I swear to God, I turned it off after 30 minutes.

[23:07] It's so bad.

[23:09] It is beyond bad.

[23:10] It's like they should never have made this movie.

[23:13] And it's like this franchise is done.

[23:15] And that is why I think the next Jersey Jack Pinball machine after Toy Story is either

[23:20] going to be Eric Minier's godfather or it's going to be Avatar.

[23:24] And Avatar makes way more sense.

[23:26] And for those of you saying, well, we already got an Avatar, but here's what's about to

[23:30] happen.

[23:31] Disney is about to make four more Avatar movies and they are coming out one after another,

[23:38] after another.

[23:39] And every other year, four new Avatar movies.

[23:42] And I guarantee you, James Cameron will never release a bad movie.

[23:48] The guy only makes hits.

[23:51] And they've been working on these Avatar movies for so long, I expect them to be probably

[23:55] the most visually spectacular.

[23:58] It's going to be like an amusement ride when you see this new Avatar movie and so much

[24:02] of it takes place under the ocean.

[24:04] And I think if Jersey Jack has secured the Avatar license, it's a much hotter property

[24:11] to come out with now.

[24:12] And for all of you complaining about it, just remember Avatar 2.7 billion at the box office.

[24:20] Okay.

[24:21] So tell me that it's irrelevant and there's not a big audience for Avatar.

[24:24] There is.

[24:25] And I think Jersey Jack could make an Avatar machine with that bioluminescent world and

[24:30] underwater elements.

[24:32] It could be so spectacular if JJP creates that world under glass.

[24:36] So we shall see.

[24:38] But again, just from a marketing standpoint, if they have to do all four Matrix movies or

[24:42] the new Avatar film, I choose the new Avatar film as the better direction to go in.

[24:47] We shall see.

[24:48] And this is why it is always exciting to see what's going to happen in the pinball world

[24:51] as we move forward.

[24:53] Everybody thank you so much.

[24:54] It's enjoyable doing the show.

[24:56] It's like nothing's changed to me.

[24:57] I don't see the numbers and the Twippies are coming up in January.

[25:01] I will say this, it will be amazing if Canadian pinball podcast can win the Twippy after doing

[25:07] what I did.

[25:08] I made it more challenging for myself doing it this way, just doing my show for the fans.

[25:13] But I think if you look at the numbers, if you look at the numbers, we still have a shot.

[25:18] We still have a shot.

[25:19] If I don't win, I will absolutely congratulate whoever does take it this year.

[25:24] I'm doing something different than everybody else out there.

[25:27] I don't know why it's upsetting some people, but the numbers keep going up and up and up.

[25:32] Everybody thought when I did this, we would start to see a decline in support.

[25:36] And guess what I've seen over the last week?

[25:38] Like 25 new people joined the club.

[25:40] And it's just going to keep going as more and more people realize that the only place

[25:44] on planet earth to get the world's most entertaining pinball podcast is right here.

[25:49] And all that it cost a month is five bucks.

[25:51] Come on.

[25:52] And then I'm reading threads.

[25:53] Hey, take my 15,000 for Deadpool and nobody will even sell the guy a game.

[25:59] Hey, I'll sell you a pinball podcast.

[26:01] Guess what it costs?

[26:02] Five bucks, pal.

[26:03] And you're in the best place on planet earth for your ears later.

[26:23] Let it go.
