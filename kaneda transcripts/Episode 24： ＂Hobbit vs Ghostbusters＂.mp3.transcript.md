[00:00] Tetsuo.

[00:02] Kaneda.

[00:05] Thank you.

[00:09] What?

[00:10] You called me back.

[00:13] I heard you.

[00:21] Welcome to episode 24 of Kaneda's Pinball Podcast coming at you from New York City.

[00:28] I want to get a quick podcast up today where we just go over some of the topics on Pinside.

[00:33] I think I've been doing a lot of coverage from the Texas Pinball Festival.

[00:38] I've got a lot of interviews coming for you guys that I'm super, super excited about.

[00:43] This week we're going to be talking to Jerry from Multimorphic about P3 and what's going

[00:48] on there.

[00:49] So look forward to that interview coming up.

[00:52] Hopefully sometime later this week have some other awesome interviews lined up.

[00:56] But this is going to be more of like what's going on on Pinside and what are some of the

[01:01] latest things that we should discuss.

[01:04] We're going to talk about the Hobbit shipping or talk about Ghostbusters a little bit.

[01:10] We're going to talk about some MMR.

[01:13] So without further ado, let's jump into it.

[01:23] So the Hobbits have shipped and it is a great thing.

[01:26] We're starting to see some unboxings.

[01:28] I'm seeing some smag SE versions arrive.

[01:32] And this is the moment that people have been waiting years for.

[01:35] And so it's good to see that Jersey Jack has stayed true to their word.

[01:39] They were telling people mid-marches when they would get the Hobbit and that is happening.

[01:43] So that is good news.

[01:45] And they look gorgeous.

[01:46] I see a lot of people putting them next to Wizard of Oz machines and there's no denying

[01:51] the fact that what Jersey Jack has put together is an aesthetically incredible machine.

[01:58] Here's one thread though that should be a little bit of concern because I think anyone

[02:02] who's getting this pin out of box has got their fingers crossed that there's not going

[02:07] to be out of the box issues the way they were with Waz.

[02:13] And I don't think people feel confident anymore that oh, it's never going to happen on their

[02:19] second pin because of all the time they've had to get it right this time.

[02:23] I think people are using that sort of excuse when talking about when the Hobbit would ship

[02:30] everyone was saying it's not going to be delayed the way Waz was.

[02:33] That was their first machine.

[02:34] They were ironing out the kinks.

[02:36] Hobbits going to arrive when they said it's going to arrive.

[02:38] And we all saw that the same exact issue happened.

[02:42] So I think a lot of fingers are crossed that nothing out of the box is going to be an issue.

[02:47] There was a new owner who posted a thread about the ball getting stuck in his new in box

[02:54] Hobbit.

[02:56] And for those of you who haven't seen that thread, the far left rail that drops the ball

[03:03] to the left flipper or the out lane area there, I think it drops it into the out lane and

[03:07] the out lane shoots it out when you press the button on the apron.

[03:12] The ball acts funny in that area.

[03:15] When I played the Hobbit at the Jack Bar and I played it at the fifth of state in New York City,

[03:23] it was doing the same thing.

[03:24] It would oftentimes just bounce out of that rail and not go where it was supposed to.

[03:30] Now this owner's experiencing a thing where the ball is actually getting trapped between

[03:34] the side of the cabinet and that railing.

[03:37] It traps so hard that even shaking it doesn't loosen it.

[03:42] I saw in the thread that JTP, everyone's favorite JJP sort of customer service guy just

[03:50] had given a nudge.

[03:52] And if a game is brand new, you don't want to have an issue where a ball is getting hung

[03:58] up or you even have to nudge the machine to put the ball back in play.

[04:03] Everyone has, I believe, a feeling that with being two years late, the Hobbit should

[04:10] ship pretty damn near perfect because there's been so much time to iron out the kings to figure

[04:17] things out to see if the ramps, the rails, where does the ball get stuck.

[04:24] So I don't think people are going to be very, very lenient on new inbox issues with this

[04:30] pin considering the amount of time that was spent arndaying it and having it ready to

[04:36] play for seemingly almost two years of a beta run on this machine.

[04:43] So let's hope there's not more new inbox Hobbit issues.

[04:47] I hope everyone opens it up and it's going well and we can get some reviews soon from

[04:54] people because I still just want to know what people think about this pin when it's in

[04:59] a home environment.

[05:00] I don't think any of the play that's been going on at shows, expos and bars has allowed

[05:04] people to really dive deep into this pin.

[05:07] And I'm going to share some more thoughts on the Hobbit when I talk in a little bit about

[05:11] the Hobbit versus Ghostbusters thread.

[05:14] You know, let's just go to that right now.

[05:16] We'll keep it pretty consistent and I'm, I got to make this podcast a little bit faster

[05:21] today because I do have to run and I want to get it up before I go to work.

[05:25] So I saw another thread out there that was the Hobbit versus Ghostbusters and it was

[05:31] a poll asking people which one they like more.

[05:36] And the poll originally, when I got put up, it got majority of the feedback was negative.

[05:43] It was got, I think it got five down votes and one up vote.

[05:47] And I think I understand why people would be negative on that poll because people are

[05:52] saying, well, majority of people out there haven't even played either of them.

[05:58] So you're really just asking a popularity question, not a question about which pin is actually

[06:03] better.

[06:05] And because of that, you're going to get results that are not really indicative of each

[06:09] pin.

[06:10] So I think that's why the negativity was there.

[06:13] I do find it funny that we also, he also had to put in the, in the subject to please

[06:18] be nice with your comments.

[06:22] But there's something else.

[06:23] So it likes the results of that poll.

[06:24] Let's just say what they were.

[06:26] Overwhelmingly in support of Ghostbusters versus the Hobbit, there were 74% of people

[06:30] said they prefer Ghostbusters versus the Hobbit.

[06:34] Having played both machines, having played both machines enough to have an initial impression.

[06:41] I've actually played Hobbit more than I played Ghostbusters.

[06:46] My vote would go for Ghostbusters and I can explain why.

[06:50] And I want to explain why with a little bit of a caveat that I think it's been impossible

[06:56] to say anything bad about the Hobbit without suffering the slings and errors of the JJP fan

[07:03] base.

[07:04] It always seems that when people order the Hobbit or in on the Hobbit, they're constantly

[07:10] in this position of having to justify it and defending it at all costs.

[07:14] And I wish people didn't behave that way.

[07:17] Because there has been some very, very, very consistent feedback on this machine that

[07:21] I think a lot of the fans have been blind to and been unwilling to accept and had they

[07:27] accept that this feedback, when it was given in real time, even as far back as over a

[07:33] year ago, I think some improvements to this machine could have been made.

[07:37] But again, I think everyone just went along with it.

[07:40] And people complained about the artwork initially, but they really should have been complaining

[07:44] about a few other things.

[07:45] And that's what I'm going to address again.

[07:47] So having played both of them, and I jumped on the Hobbit for a few games that Texas

[07:54] Pimball Festival as well.

[07:56] And Jack was there, Jack set up the games.

[07:59] The Hobbit continues to be floaty and slow.

[08:03] And I just really don't understand why we're not allowed to actually say that.

[08:09] Or when we say that, people always chime back in and say, what are you talking about?

[08:14] Yes, it's not floaty and slow.

[08:15] I played it, and it's fast.

[08:17] And here's a video proving that.

[08:18] I've played it now three times in three separate locations.

[08:24] Two of those times, Jack has set up the pin himself, or his company has, or someone with

[08:29] JDP has.

[08:30] And it's played the way it's played.

[08:33] So I'm sorry, but when is it fair for me to say, you know what, I've played it three

[08:37] times, and I'm making my mind up, and my mind is this, and this is how the game has played.

[08:44] I played Ghostbusters three to four times, and it played fast.

[08:47] It played furious.

[08:48] It had a lot of fun shots.

[08:50] It pulled me in right away.

[08:52] I didn't have any issues with it.

[08:55] Ghostbusters was played non-stop at Texas Pimball Festival, and didn't break down once.

[09:01] There was never any issues.

[09:02] I didn't say anyone complaining about anything that went on with the game in terms of the

[09:07] game flow.

[09:08] So here's my overall assessment right now, and I know it's early, and I want to hear

[09:12] reviews from people.

[09:14] But George Gomez said something really interesting, and I think when you apply it to both machines,

[09:19] you come away with a point of view that is pretty clear.

[09:26] And Gomez said that when they would design a pinball machine, there's one thing they

[09:31] look for, and they say, what are the five good shots?

[09:34] Like, what are the five rewarding shots this pin has had, or this pin has, and we're building

[09:39] the game around that.

[09:41] And I think when you look at Ghostbusters, you can easily see five shots, or five things

[09:49] are happening in the pinball machine that are super rewarding from a player's point of

[09:53] view.

[09:54] You know, you've got more than that.

[09:57] You're going to have, you've got the two ramps.

[10:01] You're going to have hitting slimer.

[10:05] You're going to have, you know, you get the Newton balls.

[10:09] You've got the magnetic slings going.

[10:13] You're going to have the Echtogoggle.

[10:15] So I mean, it's pretty easy to look at Ghostbusters and see five shots.

[10:18] In fact, there are maybe too many things to shoot for in Ghostbusters.

[10:22] You know, some of the shots are really tight.

[10:25] They cram seven things in there to do.

[10:29] But I think that's what people really love about Ghostbusters is they stand over that

[10:32] machine, and there's so much to shoot at, and there's so much to do.

[10:37] And it really immerses you immediately in the game.

[10:40] I have played a Hobbit multiple times, and I just keep coming away with the same feeling.

[10:47] It's that it's the most beautiful pin that I've seen in a long time.

[10:53] And any of the Ghostbusters is very beautiful, but Hobbit, you know, even more so the whole

[10:58] package is just gorgeous.

[11:00] It's stunning.

[11:01] And I stand over it, and I look down at this play field, and I just don't see.

[11:06] Anywhere near five shots that feel that rewarding.

[11:11] I'm sorry, but like drop targets and pop up heads and trolls and orcs.

[11:19] If you count the shots in Hobbit, the ramp, it feels the same.

[11:25] The left and right ramp are the same shot.

[11:26] They can be hit by either flipper.

[11:29] And hitting it, and I have to say this, hitting that ramp doesn't feel that rewarding because

[11:34] it's such a far distance away from the flippers.

[11:37] And it's so slow, like watching that ball crawl up that ramp.

[11:41] It doesn't have the rewarding feeling of like the ramps do like in Star Trek where the

[11:47] ball hits and flies back around.

[11:50] And people keep comparing this game to Lord of the Rings.

[11:52] I don't get the same satisfaction as locking the ball on the air-gorn sword or going

[11:58] up that legalist ramp where it swings back at you or even going up the center ramp where

[12:04] you lock the ball inside the ring as you select the mode.

[12:08] I mean, it just doesn't have that shot.

[12:12] And then you get the pop ups and anyhow, there's not much.

[12:17] There's just not much there.

[12:19] And I keep having the same feeling and we'll see what people say when they get it.

[12:25] I think people are really banking so much on code, but I don't know how code is going

[12:30] to save the fact that there's this not-stop-to-shoot for.

[12:34] So what you're going to have, and I think people are starting to notice is the pop-up

[12:37] heads are happening all the time.

[12:39] They're just like, Keith is going to have to use what he has and they're going to keep

[12:44] popping up.

[12:45] I don't know.

[12:46] They just doesn't feel like they're going to be as special.

[12:47] To me right now, they pop up all the time and I don't even understand why.

[12:50] I don't even understand.

[12:51] And my inner, have I reached the scene and the films where I'm battling them and that's

[12:55] why they're popping up.

[12:56] I think this game is going to struggle to create a level of excitement because of the

[13:03] lack of shots.

[13:04] And I don't care what code does.

[13:06] Code cannot save the fact that there aren't that many rewarding shots.

[13:11] And look, code should be much further along where if code is the savior here, where is

[13:17] it?

[13:18] I do have a hunch and I hope I'm right that these guys are just going to drop like an

[13:23] amazing code update once people start getting the machine.

[13:28] And that would be awesome.

[13:30] But people are saying to me that a text is like, why would they wait?

[13:34] Why would they want people's impressions of the game not to be as good as it could be

[13:37] in the current moment?

[13:38] And I kind of agree with that.

[13:40] But I heard that Keith, he's taken all this feedback and he's heard all the complaints

[13:45] that it's taken so long and if code is the savior, where is it?

[13:49] And I heard that he's trying to rally people at JJP because apparently everyone over there

[13:54] is really down and out that the code is really not where it needs to be.

[13:57] So Keith was, I overheard him talking to the JJP staff about just getting more excited

[14:06] for this pin and code will be coming and here's what he was saying to them.

[14:10] Where's the spirit?

[14:14] Where's the guts?

[14:19] This could be the greatest night of our lives.

[14:21] But you're going to let it be the worst.

[14:25] So we hope that code gets finished soon or gets updated soon on the hobby and we can start

[14:29] to see this pin the way everyone is saying it will be.

[14:34] We do not want a hobby that to turn out to be an $8,000 piece of artwork that is not as

[14:43] great as the weight and the expectations have been on that pin.

[14:47] So what else we want to talk about tonight?

[14:50] We've covered Ghostbusters vs. The Hobbit.

[14:56] Let's talk about one other issue with Ghostbusters that I saw thread on that was very, very interesting

[15:03] and this is a topic that should have a lot of people concerned and I don't even know

[15:11] myself where I'd fall on this side because I'd be a bit of a hypocrite because I do love

[15:19] what this community provides even if it is illegal.

[15:24] What I'm talking about ladies and gentlemen is Stern and the mod community and what does

[15:31] the future hold.

[15:32] I think if we think about how Stern is approaching the mod community lately it sounds something

[15:38] like this.

[15:39] You killed innocent people.

[15:41] That means to an end.

[15:42] You started a message.

[15:43] I caused the revolution.

[15:44] You betrayed the law.

[15:46] Right so the thread was a thread that the share Ghostbusters accessories that people were

[15:52] working on and people were sharing all this cool stuff slimer shooter rods, ecto-1 stickers

[16:00] and all of a sudden the thread title changed to careful don't share anything that you

[16:08] plan to sell because you're going to get a cease and dissist from Stern and that is

[16:12] the reality of the licensing and deals that Stern arranges with people is they own the

[16:20] exclusive rights to making accessories that are reflective of that IP for the individual

[16:26] pen and it makes sense.

[16:28] You can't Stern's not going to spend all this money to get the license for ACDC only

[16:33] to have someone like oric make translates and sell them and make money.

[16:38] He's not paying for that license at all and he gets the profit 100% off of that IP

[16:44] without paying for it.

[16:45] Now that's the law and it's very black and white.

[16:48] So there's that side of it.

[16:50] However, however, I am as a as a pinball fan concern that some of the best modding that

[17:00] goes on goes on from the community and should Stern go after and and send cease and

[17:06] to assist the people who are making these mods and I don't think they should 100% of the

[17:14] time and or they should and they've been doing things where they they're working with

[17:17] certain modders like meso mods and other people to actually make Stern license and approved

[17:23] mods and I think that's the way they're going to go and I do like that and I think it needs

[17:28] to happen that way but I do think that people should be able to share the mods they're

[17:34] making.

[17:35] So that's Stern can even identify which ones are the ones that Stern should say hey,

[17:38] like this is great, like we want to make this mod an official license mod for the game

[17:45] and I'm sure then there's some sort of agreement where some of the financial revenue that will

[17:52] be shared amongst Stern and the company that makes that mod.

[17:55] As I look over my Lord the Rings machine and this happened in a time when there was none

[18:00] of these mods that were officially licensed these were sold by by fans and members of the

[18:06] community almost everything on my pin would not have been approved for sale have they not

[18:12] come from Stern if if if the same policy existed back then they gand off with the lighted

[18:18] staff the the path of the dead mod the the eye of Palantir you know all the separate figures

[18:29] that were sold the lighted the lighted speaker area with with the ring I mean all the the

[18:37] topper I mean everything's got the is got the logo the font the the imagery from the film

[18:44] and so I think this is a this is going to be an interesting sort of battle ground that I hope

[18:50] Stern realizes that you know it's beneficial for them to not sort of put fear into the minds of

[19:00] the modders and I I because I do get concerned when I look at a pin like Ghostbusters and it's just

[19:06] so ripe for modding that there's tons people could do now not everything is controlled by the

[19:12] IP that Stern can shut down so for example if you look at Ghostbusters the city scape that the

[19:20] the city that is over the the pop bumpers if someone were to mod that out and make lighted windows

[19:28] using LEDs that's not infringing upon the Ghostbusters IP Stern cannot come after you for that

[19:34] if you were to remake the the Ghostbusters firehouse though and have the Ghostbusters logo on it

[19:39] then yes you would be infringing upon the IP I already saw someone is looking to make a mod for

[19:45] the slimer crane that holds slimer and losing back and forth to make that look a little bit better

[19:51] now that's fine it's only when you're really using the logo the IP imagery or the likeness of

[19:59] of actors and in the film stuff like that is going to be in question so I hope that I hope that the

[20:08] mod community and Stern can live in harmony and there really can be a balance here because I think

[20:14] it's super important that we don't lose all those terrific mods and that there is a room for

[20:21] a lot of creativity to dress these pins up because that's what makes owning a pin so much fun too

[20:26] is just the exciting mods that that take a company's vision and takes it to the next level I'm also

[20:32] interested to see what Stern comes out in in with their own mods I think the plasma beams are

[20:37] going to accommodate almost on it like those were for sure and it's interesting to see what they

[20:43] can develop having the IP not having to worry about that I think there's going to be some cool stuff

[20:47] so interesting thread interesting topic it's one that I hope works out for both parties involved

[20:56] so did anyone get their medieval madness remake from twisted pins yet

[21:07] yeah this is it is no laughing matter this is a topic I've been wanting to just throw out there

[21:13] for people to realize is going on and it just sucks and I think that's something needs to happen

[21:19] because medieval madness when they went up for sale planetary pinball listed a bunch of

[21:27] authorized dealers for you to buy your medieval madness remake and one of the ones they

[21:34] listed was twisted pins now these guys have taken people's deposits some people even pin fall

[21:40] and the last I checked that people haven't gotten their pins let me just check that real quick to

[21:45] make sure I'm still speaking the truth right so it seems like as of two days ago yes the situation

[21:49] is still what it is and the backstory is that when when Rick from PPS told people when they pre-ordered

[21:57] that that they would be holding all the deposit money on the pre-orders so that people wouldn't be

[22:02] screwed by distributors and the exact thing has happened though and here's here's my take on this

[22:09] and I'm not going to belabor this point but if Rick from PPS inked a deal with twisted pins to

[22:15] be an official and authorized seller of medieval madness remake and that guy I think his name is

[22:21] Travis has gone on to screw people over to take their money some people paid in fall some people

[22:27] put like a thousand dollars down and they has got MIA I'm sorry but the only is on Rick to get

[22:33] these people back their money or just ship them a pin and and take it to court but he should be

[22:39] the one who's doing the lion's share of the work not the not the buyers because you you put them as

[22:45] an authorized dealer and if they turn out to be anything but honest and truthful that's on you

[22:53] because you were supposed to vet them and make sure they were they were good and I'm sorry but that

[22:58] that's how I feel about this matter I am it sickens me to my stomach that anyone loses money on a

[23:03] pinball machine ever it sickens me to see these people getting yanked around by distributors who

[23:09] are taking people's hard earned money and then disappearing what the effort you're doing you're in a

[23:14] business how can you sleep at night how can you live with yourself when you take someone's hard

[23:18] on cash and don't deliver what you promise I think that is like the most despicable thing and I

[23:24] think these companies that are doing it like like twisted pins should be out of business

[23:30] it's it's but but if you if you connect it with them and you say they're authorized dealer Rick

[23:35] you you need to get those people their pins and their money back you need to take the loss

[23:40] and you need to take out a loan and pay them back because it's on you my friend for for connecting

[23:44] with them I'm sorry you I know it doesn't sound fair that you shouldn't have to own up to this guy

[23:50] Travis's mistakes but you said he was good to go from your company and that's the thing you got

[23:57] to be really careful who you associate with the next time only go with the distributor who's got

[24:01] nothing but but credibility and respect so that's all I want to say in that matter get these people

[24:06] their pins with their money back all right so last just quick topic is the topic that just never

[24:12] seen this to end and that is what will the next uh vault edition be will be Lord the Rings are

[24:19] Tron uh I think we heard in George Gomez's interview with Nate shivers he asked a question about

[24:27] vault editions and I know what are we going to see and and and Gomez said uh you're gonna I think

[24:32] says something like you're you're gonna see all the the the popular ones people are talking about

[24:37] uh something along those lines I'm paraphrasing but that implies that it's that we're probably

[24:42] eventually going to see them both one day and I think there's been a lot of speculation about okay

[24:48] what does that mean we're going to see like in Ellie remain and I think Lord the Rings Ellie

[24:52] doesn't matter although I do love like the the gold backlash and there's certain elements I

[24:58] wouldn't want to lose on mine if if a VE came out but if it had better sound better artwork

[25:03] yeah like I'd want one I'm not gonna lie I don't think it's gonna really significantly hurt the

[25:08] value but they've made they've shown that they're gonna make the VEs better looking I mean Spider-Man

[25:13] VEs better looking and when it comes to Tron that's the one where people are really the most sort of

[25:20] anxious about if you're a Tron Ellie owner because I mean that pin just sold 15 grand new in box

[25:25] and that's the only true Ellie with only 400 being made and there's the Daff Punk multi ball and

[25:30] there's things in Tron Ellie that you just can't replicate with the pro and no matter how many

[25:34] goodies you put into a pro it's always just a poor man's Ellie but if they made a vault edition that

[25:40] had new artwork had all the features of the Ellie but it wasn't called an Ellie but a vault edition

[25:47] for you know around eight thousand dollars everyone would jump on that and I think it would just

[25:53] make the Ellie become you know not so special so I think that's what's gonna happen I don't think

[26:00] Stern's gonna make Tron Ellie sort of is gonna hold it as this precious thing I think they've

[26:05] shown that they're all about just getting out there what people want and selling pins and moving

[26:10] on to the next like you know they know that if if if Tron VEs hits in a similar time period as

[26:18] let's say Star Wars are people gonna be whining no and they're not at all the same way like

[26:24] Spider-Man VEs sitting next to Ghostbusters right now you kind of just see Stern's larger plan

[26:28] which is let's just keep making pins better if there's some of the older ones that people want we'll

[26:33] make him again and we'll make him better we'll improve things on them where everything's gonna be

[26:36] a constant improvement so if you think your Tron Ellie is not gonna be improved upon in the VE

[26:41] edition I think you're wrong same with the Lord of the Rings you know this just goes to show that

[26:47] buying these things and thinking they're gonna be long-term investments might not play the way

[26:50] you wanted it to when it comes to Stern Pimble so that's it for this episode I got to quickly get

[26:56] dressed and head over to the Javits Center for the auto show just want to give a quick shout out to

[27:02] a couple people who have been sending me nice notes I want to thank Ronald for being a listener to

[27:47] New York City right now and hopefully I plan to connect with them at some point I'm thinking maybe

[27:53] tomorrow we they can come by the arcade seeing their pictures of New York City and I hope they get

[27:57] out and see like the really cool things New York has to offer and just stay out of the touristy

[28:02] zones I mean there's nothing in Times Square that is we're seeing and I want to show them the arcade

[28:07] and I know they're going to sunshine they're going to enjoy that and I know rotor Dave is like really

[28:11] in the cars so he has to take a ride in the hellcat I mean how can you come to America and not take

[28:16] a ride in a hellcat there's you know there's only like in car terms it's rare than a kingpin there's

[28:23] only five thousand out of all the cars in America driving around right now but anyway that's going to

[28:28] be episode 24 ladies and gentlemen I'm glad you tuned in and we will talk to you again later this
