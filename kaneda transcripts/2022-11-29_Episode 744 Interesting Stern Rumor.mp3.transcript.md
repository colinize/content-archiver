[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast, Pinside's favorite pinball expert, Canada.

[00:26] The one pinball party that is filling the void on a weekly basis, I have a great scoop

[00:31] for each and every one of you.

[00:33] I heard a really interesting story about a conversation that happened over at Stern Pinball

[00:39] about a game that is potentially coming down the pipeline.

[00:44] It's something nobody's talking about.

[00:46] Going to be really interesting.

[00:48] I'm going to share it for you on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:51] So don't ever say you didn't get your money's worth.

[00:54] Now here look, I want to start this show by saying there is a thread on pin side about

[00:58] another podcast I joined called Fifth Dimension Lounge or Fifth Dimensional Lounge and they

[01:05] wanted to interview someone about pinball and the topic and the context for that interview

[01:11] was simply this.

[01:13] Duke, who's the host of the show, got bit by the pinball bug and he wanted to talk to

[01:18] me about what pinball machine he should buy and just talk about the pinball community.

[01:25] And it's so funny seeing people on pin side get so upset that Canada was turned to as a

[01:31] personality and an expert on pinball.

[01:35] And I just want to say this to all the pin side babies who pay monthly to hear my show.

[01:40] If you think I'm not an expert on pinball, what do you think I've been doing the last

[01:46] eight years covering this hobby?

[01:49] Of course I'm an expert on what's going on in the pinball world.

[01:52] I'm an expert on all the new companies and what games are coming out and I know everything

[01:57] about each of these companies over the last eight years.

[02:01] Am I an expert on rule sets?

[02:03] No.

[02:04] Am I an expert on how to get to wizard modes?

[02:07] Absolutely not.

[02:08] But I know more about pinball than 99.9% of the galaxy and not only that.

[02:14] This is the thing about all these pin side keyboard commandos.

[02:18] You ask these guys to get off of the toilet bowl, put down the computer and actually have

[02:23] an intelligent conversation about pinball.

[02:26] Let's scratch that.

[02:27] Actually try to have an entertaining conversation about pinball and they wouldn't do it.

[02:33] Look I would invite each and every one of those people on pin side who call me a narcissist

[02:37] and a sociopath and all these terrible names.

[02:40] I'm also a husband, a father, a daddy, a worker.

[02:45] I love it.

[02:46] It's like nothing I do.

[02:47] You know it's like nothing I do.

[02:48] I love these like cancel culture pin side babies where you do a few things that were

[02:53] bad in their eyes and you're forever scorned.

[02:55] I love living so rent free inside the heads of pin side.

[03:00] Let me share a stat with you that is absolutely the most incredible stat of all time when

[03:05] it comes to pinball content creation.

[03:08] I've been banned from pin side now for over, I mean over six years now I have not been

[03:14] allowed to post on pin side.

[03:17] Guess how many times or guess how many posts on pin side the name Canada is mentioned.

[03:24] I am mentioned in 4,836 posts on pin side and I haven't even been on the site in six

[03:34] years.

[03:35] I love living rent free in all of these guys heads and they're missing out on the most

[03:40] fun and most entertaining pinball podcast on the planet and I've got the awards to prove

[03:44] it and I don't even care.

[03:46] I don't even care like who else wants to win the trippies.

[03:48] We're going to talk a little bit about Todd Tucky and Imodo are now the hosts of the trippies

[03:53] but I'm going to give you exactly the reason why you come to this show before I give you

[03:58] some interesting scoops that are happening in the pinball world.

[04:01] I want to talk real quickly about a story I put up on my Facebook page and the headline

[04:05] was this nearly half of Americans earning more than $100,000 now report living paycheck

[04:13] to paycheck.

[04:14] All right and it says this is why your savings is so important right now and we're hearing

[04:19] more and more from like economists around the world that now is not the time to spend money

[04:25] and buy unnecessary items.

[04:27] I mean Jeff Bezos came out and said don't buy TVs and don't buy cars right now.

[04:32] So in a global economic climate where all of our money is basically under attack with

[04:37] inflation are you telling me that 2023 is going to be a great year for pinball sales

[04:45] especially as these companies continue to increase their prices.

[04:50] So it's no surprise that this is triggering a response from different dealers and distributors

[04:54] and Zach many jumped onto the Facebook page and said what about products from companies

[04:59] that you represent such as General Motors, Carnival Cruises, well it was Royal Caribbean,

[05:05] Jameson Budweiser, H&M, etc.

[05:08] Well here's the thing and I said this to Zach.

[05:10] Well first of all some of these items people need like people need transportation they

[05:14] don't need pinball.

[05:16] I would also argue people probably need beer and whiskey more than they need pinball in

[05:20] life it'll make you happier.

[05:22] But here's the part and here's the part that I think Zach is missing and all these people

[05:25] are missing that are defending these high prices.

[05:28] None of the companies I work for increase the price of their product like pinball has

[05:34] increased the price of the product.

[05:37] Jameson Whiskey is not 30% more money now.

[05:40] A Corvette is not 30% more right now than it was two, three years ago.

[05:44] The problem I have with all of these pinball companies it's not the market setting the

[05:49] price.

[05:50] These pinball companies have become very greedy and they've increased the prices of these

[05:56] machines so significantly and we are not getting the value in these games.

[06:02] And I would happily invite Zach Mani on the show.

[06:05] I think this would be the greatest topic for him and I to discuss because I would love

[06:11] to hear his point of view from a distributor's point of view because I think he'll give

[06:15] it to me honest and he's been saying sales are going through the roof so I would love

[06:19] to hear how that's happening when we're hearing this other economic data and I would love

[06:24] to hear from him on what he thinks is going to happen in pinball in 2023.

[06:29] And the biggest question I have for Zach and I would love again love for him to join the

[06:33] show or come on Facebook live.

[06:35] I would love for him to answer one simple question as a distributor.

[06:39] Are you happy that these prices have increased by 30 to 40% on some of these titles?

[06:46] My door is always open and this is why we win Twipees because we don't shy away from

[06:50] having conversations with anybody and I know Zach is listening to this so he can join

[06:55] the show and I hope he does join because I think it would be the best moment in time

[06:59] for the two of us to connect.

[07:01] OK, because I think 2023 in the pinball marketplace is going to be so interesting because we know

[07:06] Stern Pinball is about to move to a new facility in which they can up their volume of production.

[07:12] So Stern is going to make even more games a year and they're going to charge the most

[07:16] they've ever charged for pinball.

[07:18] So is that going to work out for them?

[07:21] Jersey Jack Pinball, let me tell you right now Jersey Jack Pinball, the rumor is we're

[07:25] going to go from Toy Story to Godfather to Elton John and then to Avatar.

[07:32] So I think that's what we're going to see from Jersey Jack.

[07:35] So can Jersey Jack sell you a Godfather, Elton John and Avatar pinball machine if they're

[07:40] going to charge $12 or $15,000 for every single game because here's the mistake now with JJP.

[07:47] They don't even have like an affordable option.

[07:49] See I think what Stern is doing now and this is actually a genius move if you ask me, I

[07:55] think Stern Pinball realizes that we just need to sell the pro to make a ton of money

[08:01] on each game we make.

[08:03] The LE model was always just an easy cash grab for the collectors but now that they're

[08:08] making a thousand LE's they're no longer collectible so the LE to me now is like the

[08:13] silliest buy and the premium just seems so expensive because think about it like this.

[08:18] I've been thinking about this.

[08:19] This is how Canada wakes up and I'm in the shower and I'm thinking about this stuff.

[08:23] Think about the one singular thing that creates the experience of a pinball machine.

[08:28] What is the engine that drives pinball and I'm going to use a car argument.

[08:33] The engine that drives every single pinball machine is the code.

[08:38] It's the software because the shots and the layout are almost identical from a pro machine

[08:45] to a premium and an LE and so if you spend 6700 bucks you're getting the V12 engine in

[08:53] that pro.

[08:54] You're getting the same exact software that's going to go in the premium and the LE and

[08:59] so Stern Pinball is super smart right now.

[09:01] They're not even going to care because they know there's probably going to be a thousand

[09:06] suckers out there that are going to run towards every LE but I think that's going to change.

[09:10] I really do.

[09:11] I think if we get a thousand Venoms and the rumor is it might be Jack Danger's Foo Fighters

[09:16] a thousand Foo Fighters.

[09:18] No way.

[09:19] There is no way you're going to sell a thousand Foo Fighters at $13,000 or Venom can even

[09:25] be $13,000 but I'm so curious to see where this all goes.

[09:29] Look I'm just going to make a prediction right now.

[09:32] I think 2023 if the titles we get in 2023 and these are going to be the most expensive

[09:39] pinball has ever been in the history of pinball if the titles we get are Godfather Galactic

[09:45] Space Wars and we get Foo Fighters and we get Venom and Spooky brings out the hot glue gun

[09:53] to make Scooby Doo.

[09:54] Mark my words right now.

[09:56] 2023 could be even more underwhelming than 2022 was in pinball.

[10:03] You know me I'm the forever optimist.

[10:05] I am hoping that we get a game that changes everything at these prices.

[10:12] I'm rooting for a miracle game, a magical game that comes out of left field.

[10:19] We need another Godzilla.

[10:21] We need another big Lebowski.

[10:23] We need another Guns N' Roses.

[10:25] We need a pinball machine that universally excites everybody in pinball.

[10:31] We need a pinball machine that when you look at it you say I see the value there.

[10:36] I see where the creativity went.

[10:38] I love the artwork.

[10:39] I love the shots.

[10:40] I love the toys.

[10:41] We need a game that does that.

[10:42] If we go two years in a row in which nothing in pinball does that I have never been covering

[10:48] this hobby in which we've gone two years where that has not happened.

[10:52] So look what's it going to be.

[10:53] Everybody knows it's James Bond is not that pin.

[10:56] I'm sorry.

[10:57] But James Bond is not universally winning people over.

[11:01] Let's be honest folks.

[11:02] James Bond is okay but look at the pin.

[11:06] It looks like a stern pin from 15 years ago.

[11:09] It doesn't pop.

[11:11] It just doesn't pop.

[11:13] I understand the license holder made them go in that direction.

[11:16] They wouldn't even let Franchi do the artwork on the game but it is what it is.

[11:20] It is what it is.

[11:21] The license holder drove it in that direction.

[11:23] Is it really wowing any of you?

[11:25] Is anything in that game wowing any of you?

[11:28] And here's the thing.

[11:29] And everyone's saying the same thing.

[11:31] The only way for this game to wow us is if the code gets to where it needs to be and

[11:36] so cool.

[11:37] If the code is the wow thing.

[11:38] If the code is the magic because the art's not the magic.

[11:41] The layout's not the magic.

[11:43] The toys aren't the magic.

[11:45] If the code is going to be the magical glue that makes James Bond great you can get it

[11:50] in the pro.

[11:51] I can't believe I'm saying this again but this is the reality.

[11:53] Is you're going to be able to get the magic in the software and you don't need to spend

[11:57] $13,000 for something that's not even that unique because everyone who has the pro is

[12:02] on the same experience you are.

[12:04] And that's why it's important that the mechs are more magical.

[12:07] It's important that the premium NLE goes above and beyond.

[12:11] And that's the thing is like Stern's been yanking out what really makes these LEs special

[12:16] and until they get back there.

[12:19] And we know they can do it.

[12:20] We know they can make a game as beautiful as like Elvira 40th or Batman SLE.

[12:25] We know they can do it and it's just stickers.

[12:28] It's so silly.

[12:29] It's like stickers and side armor and little plastic things around the speakers and an

[12:35] interesting topper.

[12:36] Like it's not that much work.

[12:39] Like it's so funny to me that we think it costs thousands of dollars to make these games

[12:44] really pop to make them stand out.

[12:46] No it doesn't.

[12:47] It absolutely does not.

[12:49] They're just idiots that will spend $2,000 on a topper.

[12:54] Like look at that Mandalorian topper and then go look at a PlayStation or an Xbox and a

[13:00] $2,000 TV and you're going to spend $2,000 on a bunch of plastic.

[13:05] It's absolutely ludicrous that we are spending this much money for flat plastics and a little

[13:12] screen that probably cost them $15 to stick in the game.

[13:16] Alright, Canada the forever optimist.

[13:18] You're like, Canada you said this was going to be a positive show.

[13:20] It is going to be a positive show and I'm going to give you a really interesting story.

[13:24] Three interesting stories in order of significance.

[13:29] The first is American Pimble.

[13:32] They're getting very, very close.

[13:34] I mean like any week now we are going to see the next game.

[13:37] The reason I know this is I've been receiving information from my sources who are ready

[13:43] to spill the beans.

[13:45] They're a little nervous.

[13:46] A handful of people have seen the game.

[13:49] A handful of people have the information and my sources are nervous that they might be

[13:54] out it if they share the information with Canada.

[13:58] But trust me, I'm going to get stuff before they reveal the game.

[14:02] Trust me, I will leak everything I get for you before they want it leaked.

[14:08] This is what I do.

[14:09] This is how you put Twippies on the shelf.

[14:12] Another interesting story.

[14:14] I have confirmation that Duck Pimball who went over to Haggis Pimball to help Damien

[14:19] build the games.

[14:20] He has left the company and he could not reach an agreement with Damien or reach a contract

[14:27] that satisfied him.

[14:29] And so that is interesting.

[14:31] So the man who was super excited to go to Haggis to help them put these games together, he's

[14:36] clearly leaving because they could not reach a salary agreement that would make it worthwhile.

[14:43] If you're in on the next four to five games from Haggis, my fingers are crossed and I'm

[14:48] saying a prayer for each and every one of you.

[14:51] Here's the real interesting story.

[14:53] My friend Jason Knapp, I wish you were my friend.

[14:55] I know you won't report this, but here's what I heard.

[14:59] I heard one of the biggest bands of all time went into Stern Pimball.

[15:03] And I heard Stern Pimball said to the band, we'd like to make more of your game.

[15:09] We love your game, the world loves your game, and we think it's the perfect time to make

[15:15] more versions of your game.

[15:17] And the band they were saying that to was a little band called Metallica.

[15:22] But here's where it gets really interesting.

[15:25] Is Metallica said to Stern, you made our games years ago.

[15:30] It's got the DMD screen, it's got this, it's got that.

[15:34] You've updated Pimball.

[15:36] We don't want to remake our old game.

[15:39] We want you to make a new version of Metallica.

[15:44] So we would love to do another Pimball machine with Stern, but we want it modernized.

[15:49] A more contemporary version of Metallica.

[15:53] And so that is the rumor I am hearing that Stern Pimball and Metallica are working on

[15:58] in all new Metallica game.

[16:01] Now does that mean they are going to update the old machine with an LCD or is it going

[16:08] to be a brand new version of the Metallica game?

[16:12] And for those of you saying, well, they've already done Metallica, why would they do

[16:15] it again?

[16:16] I would argue, go look at Guns N' Roses.

[16:18] If you reimagine the band with a whole new amazing Pimball experience, their music is

[16:23] still incredible.

[16:24] Sure you might not sell it to people who own the old Metallica, but there are plenty of

[16:29] people who would buy a new in-box Metallica Pimball machine if it was designed amazingly

[16:35] well.

[16:36] Now the other thing is this, when they released Metallica, they were going to have a ride

[16:40] the lightning version of the game and that never came out.

[16:45] So maybe they make a sort of vaulted version of the old game with the LCD screen and they

[16:51] brand it as a ride the lightning Metallica game.

[16:55] Or we might get an all new game from them.

[16:59] I'm also hearing this, Mr. John Borg is really, really busy at Stern working on multiple projects

[17:07] right now and I know that doesn't sound like news, but I think we're going to see a Tron

[17:12] Vault, I think we're going to see maybe a new Metallica and then we're also going to

[17:17] get a brand new game from John Borg the world's never seen.

[17:21] There's a lot of people over at Stern Pimball working on games.

[17:24] You've got Jack Danger, you've got Keith Elwin, you've got John Borg and you've got

[17:28] Brian Eddy.

[17:30] Now here's the problem I see, if they're only coming out with two cornerstone games

[17:34] a year, they have four key designers and only two cornerstones and so now all of a sudden

[17:41] the wait to get the next Elwin or Brian Eddy or John Borg machine instead of a new game

[17:47] coming out every year, it's probably going to be every other year.

[17:52] They're probably going to have to move into the new factory so then they can get to three

[17:56] cornerstones a year, maybe three cornerstones and a vault.

[18:00] That's what we're used to with Stern Pimball, three cornerstone games, a new game every four

[18:04] months and then they also go back and do vault editions of machines.

[18:09] But yeah man, that's where we're at.

[18:11] We're really close to this new American Pimball game.

[18:14] I think all eyes are going to be on that game and how much it cost and how much did Dennis

[18:19] and Sophia and Christopher Franchi put into the game.

[18:23] It's going to be the ultimate test of American Pimball.

[18:25] I didn't talk about this on the show yet but I'll talk about it right now.

[18:29] Christopher Franchi did a treatment of Prince and American Pimball brought it to the Prince

[18:35] Estate and the Prince Estate loved the artwork.

[18:38] They loved the artwork and they were interested in exploring a Prince Pimball machine.

[18:43] But the cost to secure the license would have been the most expensive cost to secure a Pimball

[18:49] license ever.

[18:51] The Beatles was a million dollars.

[18:53] This would have cost them 1.5 million dollars.

[18:58] If that 1.5 million dollars also gets you access to all of princes like music and maybe

[19:05] his music videos and maybe like his live performances, you absolutely would be able to make up that

[19:13] 1.5 million dollars in sales immediately.

[19:16] You wouldn't have to worry about it because you know that Prince is so popular that you

[19:22] would easily make that.

[19:23] Like Jack Guinari was bragging when Toy Story 4 was announced they did 30 million dollars

[19:30] in sales in one day.

[19:32] Let's say the game is 10,000 dollars.

[19:34] How many Prince machines could you sell?

[19:36] Let's just say easily 2,000.

[19:38] So that's 20 million dollars right there.

[19:40] Okay.

[19:41] But that's just like your net.

[19:42] You're also going to take into account how much it cost to make each machine.

[19:45] It probably wouldn't work for American Pimball because they couldn't get the volume of machines

[19:50] for that to work.

[19:51] But Stern Pimball could do it, but it just goes to show you.

[19:54] It's like when you think about the millions of dollars these companies are making, 1.5

[20:00] million dollars to partner with Prince in 2022, it's not an obscene amount of money to

[20:06] think about.

[20:07] You know because I would argue if I'm American Pimball, how much money did you invest in

[20:11] this entire operation to have lackluster sales on Oktoberfest, on Houdini, and on Hot Wheels.

[20:19] One Prince license is worth more than all three of those combined.

[20:24] It's worth more than all four of their games combined if you throw Legends of Ahala into

[20:28] it.

[20:29] It's the kind of license where if you get it, it will put your company on the map in

[20:34] a way nothing else would.

[20:35] And you could also sell Prince machines forever.

[20:39] People would ostensibly buy this game for years.

[20:42] So it's just curious that we start to see what some of these numbers are.

[20:45] If Prince is 1.5 million and Beatles was the most expensive ever at 1 million, then how

[20:52] much was it to secure Pirates of the Caribbean?

[20:55] How much was it to secure Jurassic Park?

[20:58] How much was it to secure Ghostbusters?

[21:01] And then it gets really interesting because it's not just about securing the license

[21:04] with some of these properties.

[21:06] You've got to secure the actor rights and the clips from the movies.

[21:10] But we know it can be done.

[21:12] We know you can actually do it right.

[21:13] They did it with the Big Lebowski.

[21:16] Whatever Roger Sharp did with the Big Lebowski, we need more of that in Pinball.

[21:21] Everybody, this has been Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[21:23] We are getting to the end of the month.

[21:26] Trust me, you don't want to leave the show.

[21:28] At the end of every month, I always get like 10 or 20 people who cancel their subscriptions

[21:34] and then they come right back.

[21:35] I'm telling you right now, now is not the time to cancel Canada's Pinball Podcast

[21:39] because we are going to have some of the greatest shows over the next few months as

[21:43] all of these new games come out.

[21:45] As these prices go through the roof, you know this is going to be the one place in which

[21:49] we actually talk about this stuff and deconstruct it in a way that's 100% honest and candid

[21:56] and we're not going to hold back because we don't have any friends anymore in the Pinball

[21:59] world and we sure as heck don't have any friends on Pinside.

[22:02] We're just doing this all of us together and we might even win a six Twippy being behind

[22:06] the paywall.

[22:07] If we win a six Twippy from behind the paywall, that will be the greatest achievement in the

[22:14] history of the Twippies.

[22:15] I mean it and I think we can do it because here's the thing.

[22:18] If each and every one of you, there's over 500 of you that listen to this show.

[22:22] If each and every one of you is always upsets everybody else but it's a popularity contest,

[22:28] it's an election.

[22:29] If each and every one of you just gets one other member in your family to vote for Canadian

[22:35] Pinball podcast and I know a lot of you, you listen with your wives, they can't stand

[22:40] my voice, you listen with your kids because it's safe to play the show in the car.

[22:45] All you got to do is get one other family member to vote for Canadian Pinball podcast

[22:50] and we've got it in the bag because that would be over a thousand votes and every single

[22:55] year I've won.

[22:56] I've won by three times the amount of the second place finisher in podcasting and I

[23:01] win with around a thousand votes.

[23:04] So that is our goal this year.

[23:05] For each and every one of you, just get one other person in the family to vote.

[23:10] It's going to be legitimate.

[23:11] They're not going to throw those votes away and then we can say, Canadian Pinball podcast

[23:15] won the six Twippy.

[23:17] Now let's talk about the Twippies real quick.

[23:19] We heard from Todd Tucky a few news items.

[23:21] The Twippies will be live so you will be able to watch the Twippies even if you're not at

[23:27] Texas.

[23:28] So Todd did confirm that.

[23:30] I think that's what he meant when he said it.

[23:31] I hope Todd doesn't mean it's just going to be live at Texas.

[23:34] They need to broadcast the show live.

[23:37] Now it's going to be Todd Tucky who's the listener of the show.

[23:39] Todd, we love you.

[23:41] It's going to be Todd Tucky and Emoto.

[23:43] Now what are my thoughts on Todd and Emoto hosting the Twippies?

[23:47] Well look, I'm just going to say this.

[23:49] I'm going to say this.

[23:50] It's going to be very nice.

[23:51] I don't know yet.

[23:52] I don't know yet because what I know is this.

[23:55] When you have a live event, it takes personality and it takes chemistry and I hope that they

[24:01] practice.

[24:02] That's my only advice.

[24:03] They need to do more run throughs and they need to practice the show.

[24:06] What's really hurt the show over the last few years, it doesn't feel like they rehearsed

[24:10] it and you just can't wing it.

[24:13] You really have to make sure you do run throughs and you really practice it and get all of

[24:19] it tight.

[24:20] You can have fun.

[24:21] When the show starts, have fun.

[24:24] That's the other thing.

[24:25] When you're in that live room in Texas, I've noticed there's very little attempt to get

[24:29] the energy in the room going.

[24:32] What I think they need to do during the Twippies is I think they need to have a cocktail hour

[24:38] before the show starts.

[24:40] They need to get everybody a little saucy.

[24:42] When you watch the World Cup and there's no beer, the crowd is pretty quiet.

[24:45] I think they need to have a cocktail hour.

[24:48] Get everyone a little loose.

[24:49] Get everyone a little excited.

[24:51] Have sizzle reels going of the games.

[24:54] Get everybody pumped up.

[24:56] Then when the show starts, you've got a little bit of a rowdy audience.

[25:00] It makes it so much more interesting.

[25:02] That's what I would do.

[25:03] Then you need to pump the crowd up through the show.

[25:06] You need to talk to the crowd.

[25:08] Don't just talk to the category.

[25:10] Talk to the people in attendance and also make some jokes.

[25:15] It's also serious the Twippies.

[25:17] We need to start making fun of this ridiculous hobby.

[25:21] We need to take the piss out of it a little bit more.

[25:24] You need to Ricky Gervais it.

[25:26] I would love to do a little five to 10 minute stand up act.

[25:30] Get up there and be like, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 2022 Twippies.

[25:34] This is the last time they're ever going to let Canada up here.

[25:37] I am just here to confirm for you right now that P3 Multimorphic is not going to win any

[25:43] awards this year.

[25:45] Thank you very much and have a good night.

[25:47] I love you.

[25:48] Thank you for joining Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[25:49] I'll be back with more shows.

[25:51] Be good this week.
