[00:00] Alright, welcome to a little bit of an exclusive bit of news on Iron Maiden, Ellie Pimbaugh

[00:23] coming to you from Canadian Pimbaugh podcast.

[00:26] So normally I would be able to just post this on to Pinside if I was allowed to be a Pinside

[00:32] member, but the owners over there still deem me to be a cantankerous figure.

[00:37] But here's the exclusive I got, and here's a confirmation for you out there, for all you

[00:42] who have been waiting to see Iron Maiden, Ellie and Premium Pimbaugh, your dreams and wishes

[00:48] and prayers will be answered tomorrow early on, tomorrow morning for the most part.

[00:53] That's what I'm hearing.

[00:55] You will see the game and you will see it very early on in the day.

[00:59] Let's just say that.

[01:00] And Stern heard all of you.

[01:02] They understand the dilemma you're in.

[01:03] I want to explain the situation that they were stuck in because they know that for you

[01:10] guys out there you are being asked by your distributors to pay up in full for Iron Maiden,

[01:16] Ellie, right?

[01:17] We need your money because the games are on the line.

[01:20] Now you're saying to your distributor, how can I pay in full for a game that I haven't

[01:24] even seen yet?

[01:25] That's not fair.

[01:27] And that is true.

[01:28] That is not fair.

[01:29] And so all of it was supposed to be resolved and the thing is this, the original plans

[01:34] of how to show you guys the game and how the band was going to do, they're revealed

[01:38] the game and everything.

[01:40] It's not going to quite go down like that tomorrow.

[01:44] But the good news is, if you are a Pimbaugh fan, a Pimbaugh fanatic and you are on a Pimbaugh

[01:50] site or you have friends who are Pimbaugh distributors, you are going to get to see your game.

[01:57] You're not just going to get to see like the cabinet and the translate.

[02:01] You're going to get something around 30 images, high res images of Iron Maiden, Ellie,

[02:07] and Premium for you to salivate over.

[02:11] So the long wait for Iron Maiden, Ellie, and Premium will come to an end tomorrow.

[02:15] All right.

[02:16] All of you can go to bed tonight with thoughts in your head of what it's going to look like.

[02:22] I've heard some stuff about the package overall and I keep hearing really, really positive things.

[02:28] I heard some of the colors were adjusted to make them even better.

[02:32] So things have been approved by the band and things are ready to rock and roll.

[02:36] We probably won't hear from Iron Maiden and how they're going to blow this out

[02:41] until early next week.

[02:43] But I think we all could agree that the Iron Maiden fanbase, which has millions and millions of followers

[02:49] and the pin side fanbase or the Pimbaugh fanbase, which has a few thousand followers, are worlds apart.

[02:56] I can't wait to see what happens when the Iron Maiden fans who really want to get in Ellie

[03:00] realize that it's already too late, that they all are sold out and spoken for.

[03:07] So there you have it, a Canadian Pimbaugh exclusive.

[03:10] I also want to address something that someone emailed me because they said they didn't think it was fair

[03:16] that I did not disclose that I have an Iron Maiden Ellie that I also am offering up for sale

[03:23] if the price is right.

[03:26] I want to let you guys know in full disclosure when I do talk about Iron Maiden Ellie and I do sort of

[03:32] hype the game, I am not doing it to get a higher price for my machine.

[03:38] I think my machine will get a really high price, I'll tell you why.

[03:41] And this is what I told the individual who emailed me this is because everybody else is hyping the game.

[03:47] Right, so I heard that from listener of the show Jimmy Meyer, Jimmy thank you for writing in.

[03:54] He said, don't you think that you should have disclosed the Iron Maiden Ellie you're trying to flip

[03:59] sometime during your 15 minute worship of the game?

[04:02] I like your podcast and I've listened to every episode, but I felt this rant of yours was kind of

[04:07] dishonest and self-serving. You previously added to other podcasts being skewed due to their

[04:14] sponsors, but what you did was just as bad if not worse. Also, you did quite a bit of bitching

[04:21] about Batman 66 before finally praising it. Everyone bitched about Batman, everybody. Everyone

[04:27] thought Batman sucked. Wasn't just me, Jimmy, wasn't just me. Everyone is gushing about Iron Maiden,

[04:33] it's not just me. So as a podcaster, I literally, my opinions will be shaped by what people are saying.

[04:41] And I look, I think it's okay for me to be a little bit like overexcited about Iron Maiden.

[04:48] I'm not excited. Let me just for a minute say this. I'm not like, oh my god, I'm super excited

[04:54] because I am going to make a couple grand on Iron Maiden Ellie. What big deal is that? I've always

[05:00] said it, like when you flip a pin, you never actually get to experience it or have fun with it.

[05:05] And I will be honest here and I am being completely honest. When I flipped Ghostbusters, I didn't regret it

[05:12] because of the feedback. When I flipped Batman Ellie, I didn't regret it because of the feedback

[05:18] on the game. Iron Maiden Ellie really has me thinking twice long and hard about whether or not I

[05:26] want to flip this machine. I really, really am on the fence because I, if, what everyone is saying

[05:33] is true and it's that good of a machine and the Ellie package is going to be that incredible,

[05:39] it's going to be something that I really want. All right. Here's another bit of like a little bit

[05:43] of exclusive Canadian pinball information on Iron Maiden Ellie for you that you can go take to

[05:48] pin side and not give me credit for. It's got the upgraded JBL speakers. But what it has more

[05:55] than just that on the Ellie, it also has the red ring that goes around the speaker, sort of like

[06:01] Batman Super Ellie, which is going to look really awesome with the red armor that is on Iron Maiden

[06:08] Ellie. I don't know anything else. All right. I know that it has the airplane artwork on it.

[06:14] I know that they made the colors a little bit darker in the sky around the plane. Again, like what,

[06:20] you know, I tell my friends who have seen this game like I have a podcast. I got to describe to you

[06:26] what something looks like. It's like it doesn't really matter. This isn't ruining anyone's

[06:32] reveal. You're going to see this game in living color tomorrow morning. All right. You're super

[06:38] excited to see this game. I'm super excited to see this game. I will have another podcast up

[06:45] tomorrow to give my thoughts on Iron Maiden Ellie. I also really want to get Jeremy Packer

[06:50] on the podcast to talk about doing the artwork for this game sometime soon. He said he would. So

[06:57] hopefully he's listening and will return my constant text messages to him to give me a time.

[07:04] All right. Well, there you go, guys. I know today was a little bit disappointing, but you're not

[07:08] going to have to wait much longer. I'm guaranteeing tomorrow morning you will see images of Iron

[07:15] Maiden Ellie. Get to bed and that time will come sooner than later. Have a great night.

[07:26] Stop it. I sound like I'm going to the toilet.
