[00:00] Lonely Road, take me home to the place that we were wrong. Where'd you go now? It's been a ghost town and I'm still here all alone.

[00:18] CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CER

[00:48] We're gonna do it anyway.

[00:50] Canada was out last night drinking 12 year old Yamazaki whiskey from Japan and I'm gonna tell you right now.

[01:01] The theme of this podcast is simply this.

[01:05] I am buying a Star Wars LE and the reason is simple.

[01:11] I'm already on a list.

[01:13] I'm already gonna give my deposit as I've told everybody.

[01:18] Wait and see is the way to go.

[01:20] But and I've it's always the but and people forget this the big but in the wait and see is if it's a theme like Star Wars.

[01:29] If it's a theme like Harry Potter.

[01:32] If it's a theme like I don't know maybe Pokemon you're not going to be able to get in LE for less than MSRP.

[01:41] Now the reason why Harry Potter is an exception to that rule is it's unlimited.

[01:47] But trust me if Jersey Jack was only making a thousand Harry Potter CEs they be going for 18 to $20,000 right now.

[01:58] They would have sold out instantly.

[02:00] Now here's the thing about this Star Wars LE 770 only right.

[02:07] It feels a little bit like an only.

[02:08] I mean it's not 500 but remember the Steve Ritchie game was only 800 units I say only but that's really when Stern was bumping up past 500.

[02:19] I think they did like 600 on monsters and when Star Wars came out 800.

[02:25] Now this is John Borg.

[02:27] This is a new Star Wars game fall of the Empire kind of a weird title for a company like Stern.

[02:33] I mean a lot of the jokes the jokes going around there that's appropriately titled for Stern because people think their Empire is falling.

[02:43] But I'm just going to tell you this right now.

[02:45] I'm buying this game and I'm going to tell you this right now and don't cancel your subscription.

[02:51] If I don't like what I see I will sell this game for more than I paid for it and mark my words and I know a lot of you are mad about this but mark my words.

[03:02] The 770 will sell out instantly.

[03:06] All right instantly now Dan Jansen is just said you're not buying this game Dan I'm buying it and I if I don't plan to keep it.

[03:13] I will sell it this time for a profit.

[03:15] Now look my show covers the pinball market and I've been doing this for 12 years and why shouldn't I.

[03:22] Every once in a while if I'm covering the market of pinball speculating on prices on every single game.

[03:31] Why am I not allowed to buy a game and if I don't want it sell it for the fair market value.

[03:40] When I did this with Metallica remastered and I told everybody to get one and most people slept on it then people screamed at me they yelled at me so I ended up giving it away at cost.

[03:52] And I'm just here to tell you right now.

[03:54] I'm not a bad guy.

[03:56] I'm just a guy that every once in a while wants to make some extra coin on a game if I want to.

[04:03] Now look if Star Wars is great.

[04:07] I am going to set it up in my garage and keep it and play it and enjoy it.

[04:14] Now I want Star Wars to be great.

[04:17] I don't want to flip it.

[04:19] I don't want to pass it on to somebody else and I think it needs to be great.

[04:25] This is going to be a real moment.

[04:28] I'm worried and I'll tell you why I'm worried.

[04:30] I have a guy internally over at Stern and I asked him about Star Wars.

[04:36] I said Star Wars.

[04:37] Tell me come on is is this finally going to be the Star Wars game we've been waiting for.

[04:43] Is this going to be the next Godzilla.

[04:46] Is this going to be the game that galvanizes all of us.

[04:49] Is it going to give these shills that are going to spend 600 to $1000 out of their own pocket to fly to Stern pinball to make ads for Star Wars pinball and get a free dinner from Stern.

[05:01] Is this going to be worth it.

[05:02] And my contact at Stern said the following Star Wars is okay.

[05:11] That's what he said.

[05:11] Okay.

[05:13] It's okay.

[05:14] Like when I heard that it was like wait wait wait wait.

[05:17] It's not magical.

[05:19] It's not.

[05:19] Oh my God.

[05:19] I can't wait for you to see it.

[05:21] It's okay.

[05:23] When I heard that it reminded me of one simple thing.

[05:27] Why do I have high expectations for a stern.

[05:32] I mean in the end right in the end like I've always said this stern makes the world's greatest $7000 pinball machines.

[05:39] They do.

[05:39] They make the world's greatest $7000 pinball machines.

[05:43] I think their bomb is somewhere around $3 to $4000 and they should make $3000 on top of that.

[05:51] They make the world's best $7000 pinball machines.

[05:54] They make the world's worst $13000 pinball machines and that's the problem is we literally are paying for what we're not getting.

[06:04] And so my fear in Star Wars now and after hearing that it's okay is that Stern even if even if it is Star Wars.

[06:13] They cut corners.

[06:14] They probably add John Borg.

[06:17] Yank stuff out and you know it's always been a compromise with this company and nothing they're going to make is even going to remotely look as good as Harry Potter.

[06:26] It's not going to look as good as Evil Dead.

[06:28] It's not going to look as good as Dune.

[06:29] It's going to be a stern and every time stern releases a new game.

[06:34] I think we like expected somehow to be just better like we expect them to elevate to innovate to like make their platform more exciting.

[06:42] In the end it's going to be a stern.

[06:44] It's not going to be anything other than that.

[06:46] And look I 100% think Stern makes the most fun pinball in the world.

[06:53] They do.

[06:55] Nobody makes a game that's more fun.

[06:57] But to me to use a car argument Stern pinball makes Mazda Miata's a Mazda Miata is more fun than most expensive cars.

[07:08] And it's also really fun because it doesn't cost a lot of money.

[07:12] But if you charged a hundred thousand dollars for a Mazda Miata all of a sudden I'm looking at it differently.

[07:19] All of a sudden I don't feel like it's worth it.

[07:22] And to me that's stern.

[07:26] It's the greatest seventy five hundred dollar LE on the planet at most at most I would give them ten thousand dollars for an LE.

[07:36] There are now thirteen thousand dollars for every single one and they're about to raise the prices.

[07:41] I don't think they're going to raise it on Star Wars.

[07:43] But my point is they're large mass produced company like this is the high volume pinball.

[07:50] And so I hope Star Wars is amazing.

[07:52] I'm dreaming it's going to be amazing.

[07:54] We're going to see it in like a week.

[07:56] But my source says it's OK.

[08:00] And so if it's just OK I'm still here to tell you right now the LE's even though I hate saying this they are going to sell for thirteen thousand dollars.

[08:10] And here's my prediction on the second hand market Star Wars LE's are going to go for eighteen thousand dollars.

[08:18] And I'm just here to tell you that like you can hate me but I'm not the one who's going to control this market.

[08:25] I'm not going to make it eighteen thousand dollars.

[08:28] The market is going to make it that it's going to go for that.

[08:32] And I'm just like here to remind everybody the reason why it's going to go for that is very simply this.

[08:39] We have been getting themes for the longest time that nobody wants.

[08:44] The majority of the pinball buying demographic has been unsatisfied with the themes we've been getting over the last three to four years.

[08:55] Star Wars came out eight years ago.

[08:58] Right.

[08:58] 2017.

[09:00] It's been a long time.

[09:02] That game was never great.

[09:04] It's OK.

[09:05] It's not great.

[09:06] The art was bad.

[09:08] The mechs were bad.

[09:09] The TIE fighter on a spring was embarrassing.

[09:12] It's an embarrassing translation of Star Wars.

[09:16] John Borg is going to put more toys more mechs in it.

[09:19] I think it's going to be more of a world under glass but it's still going to be a stern.

[09:23] It's still going to be a stern.

[09:25] Now when I say still a stern it's not all negative gang.

[09:28] It's going to have great rules.

[09:30] It's going to have the assets.

[09:31] It's going to have movie clips.

[09:32] It's going to be like reliable.

[09:34] It's going to be all that and it's going to have a new screen.

[09:37] It's going to be bigger.

[09:38] Hopefully there's more like RGB full LED lights in the game but it's still going to be a stern.

[09:45] You know and so like but in even so think about it like this.

[09:50] We now know that there's going to be no distribution in Europe.

[09:55] OK.

[09:56] So that means all 770 in the US that's going to it's going to be insta-sello.

[10:02] Kerry Hardy just said Kong had something 932 Star Wars 770 right now there isn't European

[10:09] distribution so does that mean it's going to be easier to get one.

[10:12] The answer is yes and no while it's going to be more for America.

[10:17] I never in a million years ever believed that Stern sends half of its game overseas.

[10:24] They don't send half of their LEDs overseas.

[10:26] That has always been the greatest lie in the history of pinball.

[10:31] That when Stern was making 500 le's people thought that 250 were going to Europe.

[10:36] Come on.

[10:37] It's more like 40 more like you know 10 in Australia 30 in Europe.

[10:43] Though it was they were never setting 250 le's to Europe.

[10:47] It was always a lie to create FOMO in America.

[10:51] I feel like 85 percent of games always end up in America.

[10:55] So you know this European distribution problem.

[10:59] It was the same thing with the first Star Wars.

[11:01] People forget this.

[11:01] It was the same thing.

[11:03] They had to find a third party sort of like distributor to sort of allocate the games

[11:08] there because of how the licensing agreement shaked out like it's the same thing.

[11:13] It's no different than the first Star Wars game.

[11:16] We're still going to see some le's make it over to Europe.

[11:19] But trust me Star Wars le without even seeing it will be in $18,000 le and

[11:29] Canada this time around.

[11:32] I have the right to do what I want with my game.

[11:35] Now here's the thing.

[11:36] Spooky Luke's here and I want to just tell you guys something.

[11:38] I'm going to tease something right now.

[11:41] We're going to do Canada and Spooky Pinball.

[11:44] We're going to do something really awesome for Canada Club members.

[11:48] You know haven't done this before ever.

[11:51] I've been talking you know very kindly if you will about Spooky Pinball.

[11:55] It's all been authentic.

[11:56] I'm not shilling Spooky Pinball even though I have a shirt that says Spooky

[12:01] Shill that they sent me.

[12:03] I believe in their talents.

[12:05] I believe in the company.

[12:06] I just really like Spooky Pinball.

[12:09] I'm allowed to have favorites right.

[12:11] It's just the way life works.

[12:12] I like the way they're transparent.

[12:14] I like the way they talk to me.

[12:16] I like the way they run their company.

[12:18] I like the way I like the vibes of that company.

[12:21] I think that's the best like I just the vibes over at Spooky.

[12:25] It's all about vibing.

[12:26] You know Brenda's sister is here.

[12:27] Gen Z is all about vibing.

[12:29] Like if the vibe is good life is good and I agree with that.

[12:32] I think it's something good.

[12:34] One of the things that Gen Z's you know kind of made sense is like they

[12:38] they're all about the vibes like everything else they think about is stupid.

[12:41] But like the thing is is is like the vibes are good over at Spooky.

[12:45] They make you feel good about buying from them when they go live and they show

[12:49] you their company makes you feel good right.

[12:52] And so we're going to do something with Spooky's next title.

[12:56] Which we all know is going to be an instant sell out.

[12:59] It's tall.

[13:00] It's going to sell out instantly.

[13:02] And I've been telling people this for a long time.

[13:04] If you're not on a list to get Spooky's next game you're going to be upset.

[13:11] And I think Spooky's next game which fully loaded.

[13:14] Luke is here fully loaded with a topper with butter cabinet.

[13:19] So where you got to go.

[13:20] Look if you don't go butter what's wrong with you butter cabinets amazing.

[13:23] If fully loaded I think the game will be somewhere around 14 K right 14 15 K

[13:30] around there like you know all in all in and it's still going to sell for 18

[13:35] to $20,000 on the second hand market.

[13:37] I actually think this Spooky game will go like crack 20 grand.

[13:44] And I'm just saying I'm going to give you my reason why because unlike Stern

[13:49] unlike Jersey Jack unlike everybody else out there Spooky pinball has really

[13:57] figured out the one simple thing that all the other companies have not figured

[14:03] out when you buy something for a lot of money and it's part of your collection.

[14:10] The one thing you don't want is for that company to just keep making more keep

[14:18] making new additions keep making more the fact that Stern pinball the fact

[14:25] that Jersey Jack the fact that everybody else they just make you fear that one

[14:32] day they're just going to run more of the game.

[14:34] And I think pinball companies need to start declaring this is it.

[14:39] We're not making any more jaws.

[14:41] We're not making any more like Deadpool's we're not making any more Batman

[14:44] 66's the thing is they're gonna like Stern's going to make a 50th anniversary

[14:50] of Star Wars.

[14:52] So if you go buy a $10,000 Star Wars premium you're going to lose three

[14:56] to $4,000 over two years because then they're going to make a nicer

[15:00] anniversary edition but Spooky pinball will make somewhere around 888

[15:06] Beetlejuices and then never make any more.

[15:09] They made Rick and Morty.

[15:11] I think it was 750 Rick and Morty's correct me if I'm wrong.

[15:14] Luke 750 Rick and Morty's no more no more they could easily sell more.

[15:20] They could have sold 3000 Rick and Morty's but no more they made more

[15:25] TNA's because TNA was never limited and then I don't think they're going to

[15:28] make more of that but that's the thing is like so when you buy Beetlejuice

[15:33] you know that on planet Earth there will only be 888 now.

[15:40] Okay so Luke how many are you making 999 of the next game or you making 888

[15:48] how many are you making?

[15:49] We got Luke here he's typing in the chat so this would be a nice I don't know

[15:54] if it's a Canadian exclusive or people know this.

[15:56] Luke how many of the next game are you making is it 999?

[16:00] Okay great.

[16:01] Oh great you know Luke can I have game number 999 like has someone has someone

[16:07] grabbed it because I'm going to get I'm going to get this game but I would

[16:10] love to have the last one off the line.

[16:13] If no one else has it I would love to have the last one you guys make.

[16:19] I'll put you down.

[16:19] Thank you.

[16:20] Okay so you heard it here spooky Luke is going to give Canada number 999.

[16:25] Okay now here's the deal.

[16:28] I think this game is an instant sell out and I'm not going to talk about it

[16:31] just yet I'm going to tease that we're going to be able to make some of you

[16:35] canada club members very happy if you get shut out of this game.

[16:40] So I want to thank spooky Luke for a giving me game number 999 that's amazing.

[16:45] I can't wait to get it.

[16:47] I also want to thank them for what they're doing for the canada club and I

[16:50] think you guys are going to be very happy when you hear what we're going to do.

[16:55] It's just really amazing.

[16:56] It's just really amazing the goodwill of this company so okay so that game is

[17:00] going to sell out.

[17:02] So you know look I've been in the Harry Potter thread and I don't know about

[17:05] you guys a lot of people are waiting for their Potter still the game has been

[17:09] very successful for Jersey Jack.

[17:11] I've heard it's like selling as well as Guns N' Roses which was a tremendous

[17:14] seller for Jersey Jack.

[17:16] The one thing I'm a little bit worried about I go into the Harry Potter thread

[17:20] and I'm seeing a lot more troubleshooting than I normally would like to see

[17:27] with a brand new game.

[17:28] I think these games are having some issues with getting the diverter lined up

[17:34] with some of the mechanical stuff and so you know hopefully it all gets sorted

[17:39] out.

[17:40] You never want to see that though and you know that's always why the later

[17:43] builds are kind of better because they make tweaks to the games and so especially

[17:47] with Potter I just never really understood why anyone wanted Potter right away.

[17:52] They're making an endless amount of every addition and the code's not done.

[17:58] To me it was a no-brainer that like if you just wait six months you wait a year

[18:04] you can get a Potter CE for probably you know 12 grand maybe maybe less and

[18:10] with Sonic the Hedgehog around the corner from Steve Ritchie which is going

[18:14] to be amazing you know it's it's it's it always baffles me that people want

[18:19] something before it's done.

[18:20] It's like serving someone an undercooked meal.

[18:23] It's a movie without the special effects.

[18:25] I am not one of those people that wants to get a game and well you're like

[18:30] Kennedy you don't get any games like it no but I just don't want to get a game

[18:34] and have it be like 0.71 code and wait two years to get everything in it.

[18:39] I want to play the game the way it's supposed to be played and with everything

[18:43] in it that's a wow.

[18:45] I still think that the game to buy this year to collect is Jaws 50th.

[18:49] I don't think they're going to make any more.

[18:51] I think whatever they've made is what they're going to make.

[18:53] I don't think they're going to make any more between now and the end of the

[18:55] year. I think Jaws 50th they will make less than a thousand.

[18:59] It will end up being the Jaws that everybody wants.

[19:01] It'll be more rare than the LE and you know with that sparkling playfield.

[19:06] I just and they fixed all the mechs like Jaws 50th is the game everybody's

[19:12] going to want.

[19:14] So you know that's where we're at.

[19:15] So I was also in the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland thread and I was

[19:20] reading people questioning Canada as if I would tell people BS about the

[19:26] topper and the supplier like let me tell you guys this right now.

[19:31] Melbourne's one of my best friends not just in pinball but in life like we

[19:34] talk almost daily and Melbourne's an awesome dude.

[19:39] He's no BS and he tells it like it is and so everything I said about the

[19:44] topper was accurate.

[19:45] I'm not making stuff up.

[19:47] If I ever give you news about Dutch pinball it's 100% accurate.

[19:52] Okay.

[19:53] Like Raza's next accurate Raza's going to be like 300 games accurate.

[19:59] You're not going to see 500 like Alice.

[20:01] He never wanted to make 500.

[20:04] Barry made him make 500 like Barry bump bump the number.

[20:08] Look I always tell him and he he feels the same way Alice should have been

[20:11] 300 or 250.

[20:13] You know it's 500.

[20:15] It's a lot.

[20:16] Are they going to make all 500 by the end of the year?

[20:18] No.

[20:18] Are they going to end up having to give refunds?

[20:20] Yes.

[20:21] Is the game like beautiful but kind of overly simple?

[20:25] Yes.

[20:25] Is it supposed to be like more of a Baldy Williams play?

[20:28] Yes.

[20:29] You know and they they're waiting on the new supplier.

[20:32] The old supplier of the toppers is I think still making some but they're

[20:38] looking for a new supplier.

[20:40] You know and it's just the way it is.

[20:41] I know nothing's a lie.

[20:43] Nothing's a conspiracy.

[20:45] If you're waiting on your topper you're just going to wait a little bit longer

[20:47] because the reason I said that is like people thought I think Melissa a

[20:51] coin taker you know they thought that maybe like all the new games are going

[20:55] to come with toppers and the answer is no they're not.

[20:58] You know they're still waiting to figure all that out.

[21:00] There are going to be some but not like every game's got a topper right now.

[21:04] I don't understand why people are like Canadian is full of be like I literally

[21:09] have not been BSing anybody ever really.

[21:12] I like what what have I been wrong on?

[21:14] I mean it's just it's amazing to me that because people don't like me that

[21:18] anything I say is be it like Raza's next I will I will bet you my bottom

[21:23] dollar that Raza comes out before back to the future and you know I think

[21:29] they're going to end up making somewhere around 400 Alice is they're not going

[21:32] to make all 500 you know is good news is weak that a coin taker and Dutch

[21:38] they're going to pay for 5% of the tariff which is now 15%.

[21:42] It's still crazy to me that people are blaming the companies making these

[21:47] games they didn't put the tariffs in place the government did so like

[21:51] what's the deal gang like oh I signed a contract no no no you signed a contract

[21:56] to buy the game if a tariff happens post your contract you pay the piper

[22:04] like I'm you know I even annoys me that like Dutch and coin taker have to

[22:08] even pay that like you're a grown adult buying a $12,500 toy and our

[22:16] government is now doing tariffs so it is what it is like don't be like a

[22:22] complainer it's just the way the world works and you know it's like you don't

[22:26] go into the gas station oh yeah guess was was $2 last month now it's 3 and

[22:32] I'm not going to you know I want to pay only to like just grow up like pay the

[22:36] tariff like it's it is what it is you know but Alice is a you know it's an

[22:41] interesting game like some people say it's a brick fest some people say it's

[22:44] not it's not a brick fest there's just not a lot in it there's not a lot in it

[22:48] and Melbourne will be the first person to tell you that he took a John Papadouk

[22:52] foam core game and made it a working game like that's always what it was

[22:56] supposed to be you know I see more content from Kerry's been doing tours of

[23:01] multi-morphic of Turner pinball of barrels of fun I think those are great

[23:06] you know when you look at these companies I mean it when I was looking at the

[23:09] multi-morphic one I was like man like you know it's not for the faint of heart

[23:13] being a pinball manufacturer there's like nobody really there like it is like

[23:17] just a couple people like putting stuff together and that's the problem with you

[23:22] know these small boutiques like you know Jerry's like barely making like a game

[23:27] a day even if if that right and you could tell like the labor is the hard

[23:32] part and you know you look at like all the parts and the wood and the plastics

[23:38] and the decals and it's it really is like wow you know I just it's weird to

[23:45] me that there's so many independent pinball manufacturers that that all

[23:49] these smaller boutiques didn't like unite and just make one manufacturing

[23:55] facility that you know think about it like if you had 30 people in a small

[24:00] boutique manufacturing pinball facility they could be making you know we're

[24:04] gonna we're gonna do all the runs a portal this month then we're gonna do all

[24:07] the runs a predator then we're gonna do all the like you know what I'm saying

[24:10] like it's just weird to me that they're all trying to do it independent and

[24:13] failing at it because you're like waiting forever like I don't think anyone's

[24:18] getting portal like I was like a now it's like eight months ago like it's just

[24:22] it's a weird thing to me I don't think a Turner pinball is doing great that I

[24:27] just I don't hear from Chris I don't see people unboxing Merlin's arcade I think

[24:32] it's gonna be maybe the end of Turner I mean this I don't see how these companies

[24:37] release games that don't sell I think barrels needs to figure out a way to get

[24:41] doon sold I'm not seeing a lot of doon unboxings you know I mean I don't know

[24:46] you know how many Star Wars is not gonna help their cause you know is is it

[24:52] Tron next or Walking Dead you know I mean everyone now knows that back to the

[24:56] futures coming Sonic Pokemon I mean it it's just like I just don't think people

[25:02] want Rat Boy Timothy Chammel a like I just I just don't think like that's what

[25:07] we want you know doon is gonna be the new Pirates of the Caribbean no it's not

[25:13] Kara you think doon is gonna not sell when it's available and you think three

[25:19] years from now people are gonna spend twenty thirty thousand dollars on it I

[25:22] don't I don't care you I think you're a hundred percent wrong hundred percent

[25:26] wrong I mean it's like let's not be silly here like Pirates of the Caribbean is

[25:30] absolutely loaded it's also like Pirates is overrated Pirates is overrated

[25:36] Pirates is still the most overrated game I mean you know it's it's a great game

[25:40] for what it is it's a great again but it's not worth twenty thousand it's not

[25:43] worth thirty thousand it's an assetless game there literally is no Jack Sparrow

[25:48] in it so as much as like people can be like higher I get it but like it doesn't

[25:53] capture for me the magic of those movies at all and to me you know at least doon

[25:59] got all the assets it's got everything in it you know so problem with doing is

[26:05] like it has it all but you don't even care about it all like you know I again I

[26:09] just think David didn't do any market research and when you don't do market

[26:13] research you end up like this you end up like having to fight for every single

[26:20] sale you know David said to me he goes Chris I would I would have I would hate

[26:24] to have a day one sellout and I literally I said it I was like David don't

[26:29] say stupid stuff like that like that's a stupid thing to say why why would a

[26:33] pinball manufacturer ever say I don't want a day one sellout that that's like

[26:38] that really is like the weirdest thing to say it's like of course you do bro of

[26:42] course you do you're gonna watch spooky pinball sell more games in one hour than

[26:46] you can sell all year all year spooky pinball is gonna sell more games night

[26:51] like spooky pinball is gonna sell more games in five minutes then you will sell

[26:56] of doon all year and you'd rather be in your shoes like having to now you know

[27:03] put up content make a victory lap around each single game going out while

[27:10] while spooky pinball is literally gonna have 999 deposits in their bank

[27:16] account in less than an hour so it's just like I get that you can create this

[27:22] narrative that like this is how you want to do it it's not how you want to do it

[27:26] you know and I really do think like these companies they just need to hear

[27:31] the more honest truth and when they you know all these content creators and all

[27:36] the shows out there that just applaud everything they do it's not helping them

[27:39] out it's not helping them out at all you know and that's it that's absolutely I

[27:46] think David Menaday once I'll means may have under us no come on it doesn't mean

[27:50] underestimate the demand spooky pinball knows the demand for its new game is way

[27:55] more than 999 that's all they're gonna make smart stern pinball smart they know

[28:00] the demand for Star Wars le is higher than 770 but they need to get FOMO back

[28:04] it's smart like I talked to Seth I talked to this this was my advice to Seth

[28:09] and George and Gary you need to start lowering the le number and that's what

[28:12] they're doing they could sell it but if they keep selling a thousand le's

[28:17] they're absolutely destroying the collectability of their brand and so

[28:21] they're working to get that back smart right it's a smart move and I think

[28:26] pinball is in a really precarious place right now the prices are insane

[28:30] there's so much available I mean if you go on like and look at the amount of

[28:35] people trying to get rid of stuff in the thousands all over the place nothing

[28:40] is hard to get everything is readily available and I think you know the

[28:45] enthusiasm around every new game is gone I think spooky has the enthusiasm

[28:50] did there's only eight pages I was shocked stern pinballs Star Wars next

[28:55] only eight pages in the hype thread think about that for a minute that is

[29:01] ridiculous if someone started a thread what do you think of Canada it would

[29:06] have more than eight pages in one day can someone start that thread

[29:09] can a to want to challenge pin side that in one day if you put up a what do you

[29:14] think of Canada it'll get more than eight pages of commentary like nobody

[29:17] cares another Star Wars right and you know I kind of feel like they did it to

[29:23] themselves like Stern just did it to themselves they've been going back to

[29:27] the same well over and over and over again Star Wars Marvel Star Wars Marvel

[29:31] right Dad Rock Star Wars Marvel over and over and over again and they really and

[29:37] when they try to go contemporary they got it wrong and what they don't realize

[29:41] is the one thing they haven't done enough of is nostalgia right it's just not

[29:44] Star Wars nostalgia more Ghostbusters more Batman more diehard more total

[29:50] recall more Conan the Barbarian more Matrix more karate kid more you know

[29:57] Ferris Bueller more Christmas vacation more of everything more breakfast club

[30:02] they just don't understand it like Jody I really do feel like Jody goes to like

[30:07] a Slayer concert and like looks around is like this is what we need when Jody

[30:12] needs to go to like Comic Con and other places and realize like other themes are

[30:17] out there now look I think they're gonna try to do fallout and I think it's gonna

[30:20] fail miserably they really are fifth element Blade Runner yeah and so you're

[30:24] right where is this stuff big trouble in little China it's out there that

[30:28] license is out there you know it's it's no longer gonna be made apparently I

[30:33] think someone had it they lost it but Super Mario what you know this is what

[30:37] we want we want stuff Donkey Kong imagine a Donkey Kong pinball machine with the

[30:43] ladders and it would be incredible and the barrels rolling down you know make

[30:47] instead of barrels he's rolling the pinballs down at you and you have to

[30:50] hit them back you could you could think about you know just just the

[30:53] visualization of a Donkey Kong pinball machine in that iconic blue and it would

[30:58] just be amazing it'd be absolutely super cool and I think nobody really wants to

[31:02] own a John Wick or a Venom you know Dungeons and Dragons was a flop King Kong

[31:07] has been the biggest flop King Kong has really been a really big flop and you

[31:13] know it's it's it's probably interesting what Keith Elwin's going through now

[31:18] because he hasn't really had a flop like this since Avengers and there was a lot

[31:23] of build-up to Kong right everyone thought Kong was gonna be the next Godzilla

[31:26] it was anything but it was anything but everybody look it's Friday it's Labor

[31:32] Day weekend it's a long weekend I want to thank each and every one of you for

[31:36] being a member of Canada's pinball podcast I really appreciate it I'm glad

[31:40] you're enjoying these lives it actually makes it easier for me because when I do

[31:44] it like this I don't have to edit the show there's something about when I see

[31:49] myself talk it's easier for me to articulate and not stumble and I really

[31:54] love that patreon finally has this live feature I'm gonna share these so you can

[32:00] watch it either like this or you could listen to the audio I want to thank each

[32:04] and every one of you I especially want to thank my club members who have

[32:08] appreciated this additional content and I'm up their subscription amount the

[32:13] majority of people are at $5 a month I'm not gonna raise that price patreon

[32:18] keeps telling me to do that I'm not gonna do it but if in the kindness of your

[32:22] heart you feel like you know as you're about to pull the trigger on a $13,000

[32:28] pinball machine that you might want to up it to 10 to 15 to 30 a month I will

[32:34] happily give you a personal shout out for being a member of the raise the roof

[32:38] club but again give what you can that's always been how I run this show

[32:43] I feel proud to trailblaze in this space when I first did this you got to

[32:48] remember everybody everybody called me an idiot everybody said you know no one

[32:52] was gonna sign up and you know years later the most successful pinball

[32:57] podcast by a mile by a mile and the reason we're that way and I think this

[33:03] is the best pinball podcast community by a mile because we're the only ones I

[33:08] mean all of us only ones that I think actually are free where we speak how we

[33:14] really feel and in doing so we've built a great bond a great community and we

[33:20] also have the respect of the manufacturers trust me they don't respect the

[33:24] shills at all they don't like how can they like they literally don't and so when

[33:31] canada comes a knock and so that my point is like so stern invited me

[33:34] September 10th and here's my thing I'm not going and it's I thank Zach for the

[33:39] invite I just don't want to go and like be in the room with everybody the way

[33:44] they do it I don't think it's like a good way to see the game for the first time

[33:48] I think it's overcrowded and I think it is designed to like you know more for

[33:53] the shills now what I am gonna try to do is maybe go over there a little bit

[33:56] sooner and just sign an NDA and see it and I do feel like canada should have a

[34:02] different experience I just do I just don't want to go and then like sit down

[34:07] at dinner next to all the shills and be like yeah man I can't wait to make

[34:11] advertisements for this company and then get kickbacks from my distributor

[34:15] friends who are running advertisements at the beginning of my show promo codes

[34:20] promo codes to help distributors sell their unsold inventory unbelievable

[34:26] unbelievable never gonna see that with canada all right everybody happy Friday

[34:30] love you let's keep doing this I'm gonna end the podcast right now take it away

[34:36] jelly roll and machine gun Kelly I'm on that machine gun Kelly kick I love it

[34:41] you gotta watch his videos man dude at a total like convolescence and it's kind

[34:46] of amazing I don't know anyone who's sleeping on this new album lost
