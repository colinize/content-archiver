[00:00] Oh, let's go fly a kite up to the highest height.

[00:09] Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring.

[00:16] Cera, cera, cera, cera, cera, cera, cera, cera, cera.

[00:20] Ah, welcome everybody back to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:24] I'm recovering, but I'm here to tell everybody, I don't know for how long.

[00:28] I've been coughing so hard.

[00:30] I'm almost hesitant to tell everybody this.

[00:33] I've been coughing so hard that it has basically weakened my abdominal wall, which has then

[00:39] caused me to get ready for it to have a hernia.

[00:43] I have a freaking hernia.

[00:45] My insides are pushing through my abdominal wall.

[00:48] And now I'm going to have to go get surgery for that.

[00:51] Yeah, did you know this?

[00:52] A chronic cough can actually lead to a hernia.

[00:57] I feel like an old man.

[00:59] And I need to be an old man to afford the prices of these pinball machines.

[01:03] Let's talk about what's going on in the pinball world.

[01:05] It was a little bit of an off week, but we're back in the saddle.

[01:08] We're going to talk about everything going on in pinball.

[01:11] And we need to be.

[01:12] We're only at 705 subscribers, everybody.

[01:15] My goal of getting to 800 is moving in the wrong direction, but I'm not surprised.

[01:21] There hasn't been much news.

[01:22] There hasn't been much to really get everybody going.

[01:26] We're going to get there.

[01:27] Trust me.

[01:28] I think this month it's February.

[01:30] I think we might see Harry Potter at the end of this month.

[01:34] We're going to see Alice's go out the door soon.

[01:37] We're going to see if this Dungeons and Dragons dragon like holds up under normal gameplay.

[01:43] I was just looking at one of these units out in the wild and the dragon was broken right

[01:49] away.

[01:50] That's not a good sign for people waiting for the game.

[01:53] We've got all these pulp fictions going out.

[01:56] We've got a lot happening in pinball.

[01:57] So let's just go around the horn on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast and talk about

[02:01] everything going on.

[02:03] So let's start with avatar.

[02:05] The CEO owners are finally starting to get their games.

[02:08] And my gosh, they are gorgeous games.

[02:11] There's no denying the fact that when you look at one of these avatar pinball machines,

[02:16] you look at the armor, you look at the colors, you look at the top, or you just look at the

[02:20] machine, right?

[02:21] Just stand back.

[02:22] Look at the machine.

[02:23] And it is one of the most spectacular looking pinball machines I think I've ever seen.

[02:29] Now look, everything else around the game, you know how I feel.

[02:33] The one thing I just want to say is this.

[02:35] If you ordered an avatar CE, I really hope you have fun and you enjoy your game.

[02:42] Because if you don't have fun and you don't enjoy your game, you're going to lose a lot

[02:46] of money on the machine.

[02:48] You just know this people.

[02:49] And I just want to say, regardless of if you love the machine or if it's fun or not, I

[02:55] still think the story of this game, and I mean this, is going to come down to the fact

[03:00] that the marketing around it lied to everybody about what was going to be in the game.

[03:06] Don't you think it was so disingenuous to bring in extra UV lighting to hook everybody

[03:13] on what this game was going to look like if you put it in your game room?

[03:18] Remember, they never told you that they brought in a lot of additional UV lighting when they

[03:23] took your order, your nonrefundable order.

[03:27] And now it's crystal clear, everybody.

[03:29] The UV ink in this game doesn't work well at all.

[03:33] And I mean that at all.

[03:35] Like when you look at the avatar figures, all of their tattoos in the marketing materials

[03:40] around the game, they're all lit up super bright when the UV hits.

[03:45] And then you look at actual owners in a pitch black game room showing you their avatar, and

[03:51] all those characters are darkest can be.

[03:54] There's no lighting up of their tattoos in UV glory.

[03:59] So they bait and switched everybody.

[04:01] But you know what?

[04:02] As I read the thread, I don't think these owners care.

[04:06] I think they're just going to justify their games and they're going to have their fun,

[04:09] and that's cool.

[04:10] You know, look, I've been following not just like our hobby.

[04:14] I've been going on to a lot more reels, talking about the car industry, talking about the

[04:20] watch industry.

[04:21] Let me tell you something.

[04:22] You think we lose a lot of money when we lose $3,000 to $5,000 on the top of the line

[04:27] pinball machine, the Kremdolo Krem game, right?

[04:30] That's what we've been losing.

[04:32] Go look at the Ferrari buyers.

[04:34] I know it's not the same thing, but the average Ferrari buyer that bought into the FOMO that's

[04:41] been buying every Ferrari so they can get access to the super special ones, all those

[04:47] Ferrari owners are now losing $300,000 to $400,000 on the cars they bought.

[04:54] I mean, spending $600,000 on a car that becomes worth like $300,000.

[05:01] So look, maybe it's not so bad over in our little pinball corner.

[05:05] All right.

[05:06] So after Avatar though, all eyes are going to be on Harry Potter.

[05:09] It's not even worth speculating whether or not it's the next game.

[05:13] It's the next game.

[05:14] And we might just see it in a few weeks.

[05:16] All right.

[05:17] Let's go over to stern pinball.

[05:18] So I still for some reason can't understand one thing happening in the stern pinball thread.

[05:25] Why does everybody still think that the uncanny X-Men game is going to have some 180 moment?

[05:33] And I'm just here to tell each and every one of you, I think it's time to just give up on

[05:39] this game.

[05:40] You've now had over six months of waiting for this game to develop.

[05:45] The problem is, is the entire foundation of the code is the problem.

[05:50] This isn't like Lyman sheets and he's doing Batman and it's taken a really long time and

[05:56] he just needs more time.

[05:58] This is Wicen.

[05:59] This guy's never really coded anything that's given you that magical feeling.

[06:04] And you think he's going to do it now, especially when Stern has allocated most of the resources

[06:10] over there to King Kong, to games like Dungeons and Dragons.

[06:14] They're not going to keep swinging at X-Men because it's like the perfect storm of what

[06:19] can go wrong.

[06:21] It's got mechanical issues that haven't fully been solved and it's got software issues

[06:27] that are just one of the biggest sort of head scratchers in recent years in pinball.

[06:32] And then what happens is you lose the enthusiasm from the community.

[06:37] And how do you think they're going to get it back?

[06:39] Gang, they're not going to get it back.

[06:40] And every time I go into the thread and every time I read my chat, it's still filled with

[06:45] like X-Men people really hoping and praying that this game is going to have some sort

[06:50] of convalescence, that it's going to turn around.

[06:53] And I'm just here to say to every one of you, I would just get out while you can.

[06:59] Just get out while you can.

[07:00] If there is some miracle one day and they do make this game amazing, guess what?

[07:05] You'll be able to march right back in and get the game for less money.

[07:10] But I would get out now.

[07:12] Now I think what makes this so painful is the game is so beautiful.

[07:16] It's so beautiful.

[07:17] X-Men LE is one of the most stunning stern machines of all time.

[07:22] And that's why you want it.

[07:24] You want the game itself to match the beauty of the game that you're looking at.

[07:29] But it's just not the masterpiece is not there.

[07:32] And so as we watch these Dungeons and Dragons, Ellie's make their way out into the world.

[07:37] That's another exciting thing.

[07:39] It feels like the game was just revealed.

[07:41] Stern is going to make all 740 le's at the beginning.

[07:46] And I just hope the quality holds up for these D&D games.

[07:50] I can't wait to play one because they do make the Ellie's first.

[07:54] It's interesting now.

[07:55] It's actually a longer wait now for most of us to get on a game and just see if we like

[08:01] it.

[08:02] It takes longer now, now that the Ellie's are made first.

[08:05] But I still agree that the Ellie's should be made first.

[08:09] It is now the biggest gamble in all of Pinball.

[08:12] If you run in on these $13,000 le's and there might be a quality issue or the game might

[08:19] not be that great, you're the guinea pig.

[08:21] You're the high priced guinea pig now.

[08:23] But I think overall the consensus on D&D is it's a really good effort from Stern Pinball.

[08:29] I don't think the le package is really that awesome.

[08:33] I don't really care for it.

[08:34] I think there's been a lot nicer games that have come out recently.

[08:37] But it still feels like it's going to be a game that holds enough people over as we wait

[08:43] for King Kong.

[08:44] And also game we got to be careful.

[08:46] I fell victim to this.

[08:47] There's going to be a lot.

[08:49] I mean this a lot of really good AI generated fake news in the world of Pinball.

[08:56] Someone sent me a Ghostbusters trailer.

[08:59] It's coming back and it looked really good.

[09:01] And then you realize it's fake.

[09:04] But man, this AI can do really amazing stuff.

[09:07] It can actually recreate new cabinet artwork.

[09:10] It can recreate those Stern launch videos.

[09:13] It can do everything that we've seen in the world of Pinball marketing exactly the way

[09:17] we're used to seeing it.

[09:19] Maybe a little bit of that is because the Pinball marketing is so bad.

[09:22] So it's easy for AI to recreate it.

[09:25] But there's going to be a lot of this.

[09:26] We're seeing it all over social media.

[09:29] Fake movie trailers.

[09:31] Fake this, fake that.

[09:32] And the same thing is going to happen to Pinball.

[09:34] So for us Pinball content creators, we're going to have to be a lot more patient in

[09:40] sort of sharing this stuff because most of it is going to be fake.

[09:44] All right.

[09:45] So we got D&D out there in the world.

[09:47] You're going to get these code updates like every Sunday.

[09:50] Here's something I've been reading about in the D&D space.

[09:52] So a lot of D&D fanatics.

[09:54] A lot of you guys are so used to having a booklet and a manual that is like a map of

[10:00] the Dungeons and Dragons world and the universe.

[10:03] But here's the problem.

[10:04] Because Stern Pinball is going to manipulate those dungeons every week, you're not going

[10:09] to be able to have like a manual where you can sort of play along with the game the way

[10:14] you're used to with D&D because it's always going to be changing.

[10:18] What I think Stern should give people is sort of like a manual or a templatized dungeon

[10:25] book that just has like a hundred different pages of the dungeon and the different places

[10:31] things could be.

[10:33] And they should give you a chance to sort of mark down in the manual what this week's

[10:38] dungeon layout is because I think that would be fun for D&D fanatics.

[10:43] Ultimately I think this game is going to go down as a really solid effort from Stern

[10:47] Pinball and I just hope the quality is there.

[10:51] Because as I mentioned there was an Ellie on location and the dragon was broken right

[10:55] away.

[10:56] That's not a good sign.

[10:58] We all know that Stern seems to be rushing games to market a little bit.

[11:02] We know the quality testing at the new factory isn't the greatest.

[11:07] For Pinball you kind of got to get it right because if the quality is not there and only

[11:12] one mechanism goes down the entire game goes down.

[11:16] So it's not one of these things where you can live with a few headaches.

[11:19] You really want to make sure the game is playing right.

[11:22] So after D&D we're going to wait for King Kong and I don't think King Kong is going to

[11:26] be earlier than May of this year.

[11:29] So I think we've got a little bit of a wait.

[11:31] Let's go over to Spooky Pinball.

[11:33] Evil deads are going out the door.

[11:35] These games look phenomenal.

[11:37] Every time I see these games I want one more and more.

[11:41] The quality of these games.

[11:43] I'm hearing good things about it.

[11:45] People have walked up to this game and they're starting to say it doesn't feel like a spooky

[11:49] game anymore.

[11:50] It feels like they've really dialed up the premium nature of the game.

[11:54] That's really really good.

[11:56] And I think we're going to see a lot more people even if you don't love Evil Dead.

[12:01] You might want to think about putting this game in your collection.

[12:04] I think Spooky Pinball is one mainstream theme away from really knocking it out of the park.

[12:11] They really are.

[12:12] They're going to put it all together.

[12:14] They've got everything they need right now.

[12:17] Now they just need a theme that more of us really really want and I know they're going

[12:23] to get there.

[12:24] And I'm super excited because when that day happens you're going to see a day one sell

[12:29] out and you're going to see a game that never leaves people's game rooms.

[12:34] I mean it.

[12:35] We just want a theme that speaks to us that has a little bit more nostalgia and it's like

[12:41] a movie or a film property that you want to watch over and over again.

[12:45] Is it going to be Beetlejuice?

[12:47] Is it going to be the Goonies?

[12:48] I don't think it's going to be the Goonies.

[12:49] I think it's going to be Beetlejuice.

[12:51] And then that's going to be it right.

[12:52] There's not going to be much news from Spooky Pinball for the rest of the year.

[12:57] They make a game.

[12:58] They make it all year and that's it.

[13:00] Now all eyes on Barrel's of Fun.

[13:02] They've got a new game coming out any month now.

[13:05] The rumor is it is Dune.

[13:08] The overall consensus from a lot of people is you don't want Dune.

[13:13] And if it is Dune and it's the new Dune movie franchise, I think David Van S is going to

[13:19] have to sort of hit pause a little bit because even though he's making money and even though

[13:24] he's built a solid machine, I think there's a little bit of an issue with I'm going to

[13:30] make games that I want to make, not necessarily games that the community wants.

[13:37] And we've seen this before.

[13:39] I don't want to see Barrel's of Fun turn into the next American Pinball.

[13:44] When you think about it, it's like questionable themes, things they wanted to make, no real

[13:50] market research.

[13:52] You could even argue the same thing about Spooky Pinball, making stuff that's their

[13:57] wheelhouse.

[13:58] And then the moment they actually make something a little bit more mainstream, Rick and Morty,

[14:03] look at the frenzy to get one, then you get stuff like Rob Zombie, Alice Cooper.

[14:08] That's not really if you want to move units.

[14:11] That's not really where you should end up with your theme selection.

[14:14] I just don't know anymore now.

[14:16] Barrel's of Fun was the biggest mystery for an entire year.

[14:20] Then they dropped Labyrinth onto the world.

[14:23] I don't hear people talk about Labyrinth that much.

[14:26] I mean, it's a solid game.

[14:28] I like the innovations in the game.

[14:30] The screen underneath the glass is really cool.

[14:33] Lots of opportunity there.

[14:34] I just want to see these guys, again, make a theme that excites us.

[14:39] Now talking about making a theme that excites us, I feel like all conversation around back

[14:44] to the future has stopped.

[14:46] Have you noticed this?

[14:47] It's like Dutch Pinball X is going to make Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but parallel

[14:52] to that, development of Back to the Future, I think, is going to be a huge thing happening

[14:58] in the world of Pinball.

[15:00] Now I don't know what the latest is on whether or not Barry has inked a deal with like a Stern

[15:06] Pinball or a Jersey Jack Pinball, but the latest I heard is that he's going to make

[15:12] the game.

[15:13] Fine.

[15:14] All right.

[15:15] It's almost like I'm at the point now where like, fine.

[15:17] If you're going to make it, go make it, but geez, it has to be special, right?

[15:21] It has to elevate.

[15:22] It has to feel the same way and land the same way that Lebowski landed 12 years ago.

[15:28] The problem now is it's been 12 years.

[15:32] There was no Keith Elwin making games back then.

[15:36] Stern wasn't firing on all cylinders like they are now.

[15:39] The problem now too is like, Pinball is so damn expensive.

[15:43] Our expectations are through the roof.

[15:45] Remember when Lebowski first came out, it was $8,500.

[15:49] Now it's like $13,500.

[15:51] It's $5,000 more money for the same exact freaking game.

[15:56] Now Back to the Future is a theme where like money almost doesn't matter.

[16:00] People are just like willing to throw anything at this theme, but I'm curious to see how

[16:07] this whole thing develops.

[16:09] Being that Keith Elwin and Stern Pinball wanted to make it or help them make the game, I'm

[16:15] really nervous because if they go make it themselves, what then, right?

[16:20] What then?

[16:21] What happens when you get like 8,000 orders, 5,000 orders and you're making 10 to 15 games

[16:27] a week?

[16:28] Like think about that for a minute.

[16:29] That's the best they can do.

[16:32] Stern can make 800 games a week.

[16:35] So why would you, if you're Barry, why would you want to like spend?

[16:40] Five years of your life when you could just let Stern make the game, get a royalty on

[16:46] everyone's sold, make a few million dollars and just chill.

[16:51] I don't understand why he won't do that.

[16:54] It's like he wants to prove something and if I were him, the only thing I would prove

[16:58] is what a multi-million dollar mistake it was that George Gomez and Seth Davis hired

[17:04] a Gen Z market research company to tell them that nobody wanted back to the future.

[17:10] All right.

[17:11] So we're definitely not going to see back to the future anytime in 2025 and these Alice's,

[17:17] hopefully we see the first Alice off the line this month in February.

[17:22] They are now cutting it close on whether or not they can get all the Alice's built in

[17:27] 2025 before people are offered a refund.

[17:32] Now I still think they're going to get it done.

[17:34] It's seeming like Alice might hold value better than people thought.

[17:39] I think what might help it is how they are going to slowly trickle out.

[17:44] So there's never going to be like 500 Alice's available in the world until maybe this time

[17:51] next year.

[17:52] I think that's going to help them significantly, but I'll say this, I'm going to be honest.

[17:57] If this game isn't fun and it's just beautiful, but there's no substance and it gets boring

[18:03] quickly, this game is not going to hold value.

[18:07] People are going to want to get rid of it because a lot of really fun stuff is coming.

[18:11] A lot of really fun stuff with huge themes and great toys and much better integration

[18:17] and a lot of replay value is coming.

[18:20] And so I just don't think there's room in people's lineups for just eye candy anymore.

[18:26] You've got to give people a lot more.

[18:29] For example, there's a lot more happening in Evil Dead than Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[18:34] I even think Evil Dead looks even better.

[18:37] And Alice was always supposed to be this sort of work of art.

[18:41] And I tell this to Melvin every day, I still think they're making too many.

[18:44] I think 500 was too many.

[18:46] And I think since Expo people, it was like October, November, December, January, February,

[18:51] that was five months ago.

[18:53] Have you seen a code update on Alice?

[18:55] Have you seen anything new on the game?

[18:57] You haven't.

[18:58] And that's a little bit concerning to me.

[19:00] I wish they would have shown more stuff and why you should get excited about the game.

[19:05] Now they don't have to because they sold everyone.

[19:07] But still, what is the final version of this game going to be?

[19:11] And my advice to Melvin is just start doing weird stuff with the code.

[19:17] It's a really weird place, Wonderland, and get freaky with it.

[19:21] Then we've got this other Alice game from Wonderland Amusement.

[19:24] Someone sent me an email.

[19:25] Sorry, I don't have my email up right now.

[19:27] I mean, like, Canada, you should take a look at this game.

[19:29] Imagine if they can make this for $1,200, what they could do for $3,000.

[19:34] And I'm sorry, but I just can't take any Kickstarter seriously.

[19:37] I can't.

[19:38] I can't take a Kickstarter in the world of pinball seriously.

[19:43] Because you know what?

[19:44] It's like, how are they going to make this thing for $1,200?

[19:47] How?

[19:48] How are they going to make it for $1,200?

[19:50] And how are they going to get it into a box?

[19:52] And how are they going to develop everything and make it ready for production for $1,200?

[19:57] When a freaking stern topper, remember this, a stern topper is $2,000.

[20:03] And these guys want to sell a fully featured pinball machine for $1,200.

[20:09] It's cheaper than a stern topper by $800.

[20:13] If they can pull this off, more power to them.

[20:16] But here's the thing is they can't pull it off.

[20:19] They need your money.

[20:20] They need my money.

[20:21] They need Kickstarter money.

[20:23] And I just can't get behind it.

[20:25] If they do pull it off and they put this game into the world, I think it's great.

[20:29] I do think it's great.

[20:30] I can't have a pinball podcast about our love of pinball and then be mad that someone's

[20:36] going to give people an entry level pinball experience.

[20:39] I hope they figure it out.

[20:41] The biggest crime is not what these guys are doing.

[20:44] The biggest crime is that idiots are spending $2,000 on toppers.

[20:49] And these guys are going to show us that you can make a full pinball machine for less than

[20:53] that.

[20:54] All right.

[20:55] What else is happening real quick in Canada's Pinball Podcast?

[20:57] We've got these pulp fictions going out to people.

[21:00] That's great.

[21:01] I'm seeing a lot of them trade hands for at cost.

[21:04] That's also good.

[21:06] It's good.

[21:07] The FOMO is dead on this game.

[21:08] If you want one, you can get one.

[21:11] That's really good news.

[21:13] What's next from CGC?

[21:16] More medieval madnesses.

[21:18] They're going to do Twilight Zone and they're going to do Halo.

[21:22] Padredy Gaming is going to remake Tales of the Arabian Nights this year.

[21:27] Have you noticed on Pinside all of a sudden a lot more Totens are popping up for sale?

[21:33] Why do you think that is?

[21:35] Because it's going to be remade.

[21:37] Is it going to be as good as the Baldy Williams game?

[21:39] No.

[21:40] But it's going to have better lighting.

[21:42] It'll have a better display.

[21:44] And I really hope they don't mess around with the artwork.

[21:47] They're probably going to.

[21:49] But man, it's like more is coming.

[21:51] More, more, more, more, more.

[21:52] You know there's a new social media movement called No Buy 2025?

[21:58] This is happening all throughout TikTok.

[22:00] A lot of people are coming to the conclusion that their lives would be better if they didn't

[22:06] buy more stuff in 2025.

[22:08] And I think that's going to be a challenge for everybody in the pinball space because

[22:12] you're going to want to buy Harry Potter.

[22:15] You're going to want to buy King Kong.

[22:17] But for the most part, all these other projects, more this, more that, remakes of this, I think

[22:23] it's going to be a really hard space to sell us on.

[22:27] Another pinball machine is what we need.

[22:30] You know everybody, we don't need more.

[22:32] And you know that.

[22:33] And you've got games that you've never seen the end of and you want new games.

[22:38] You want more this, more that.

[22:40] I don't know.

[22:41] A lot of us as we get older are just going to learn to be happy with what we have, enjoy

[22:47] what we have, let the newbie suckers lose so much money on new and box games.

[22:53] And if you really want something, you'll easily be able to get it for $3,000 to $4,000 less

[22:59] money if you just wait a year.

[23:01] So yeah, Canada's going to subscribe to this No Buy 2025.

[23:05] Not by choice.

[23:06] I did sell my apartment.

[23:08] My reality now is I just can't take like $13,000 to $15,000 and even think about buying a pinball

[23:16] machine.

[23:17] There's just so much else I would rather allocate that money to.

[23:21] It's crazy when you say it, right?

[23:23] One pinball machine that's not even rare, that's not even special is $13,000 to $15,000.

[23:31] Hello, Jump the Shark pinball hobby, Canada out.
