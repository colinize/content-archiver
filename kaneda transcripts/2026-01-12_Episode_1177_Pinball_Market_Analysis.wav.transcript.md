[00:00] !

[00:30] I was watching some good football yesterday and it got me thinking.

[00:34] It got me thinking about the pinball market and we haven't really gone around the pinball

[00:38] horn and just looked at like what is it like if you were to wake up today and want to go

[00:44] grab a pinball machine.

[00:47] It's actually a really, really, really good buyer's market and I'm going to pull up the

[00:54] prices of what the current list price is for the creme de la creme version of a lot of games

[01:03] that have come out across the pinball universe over the last few years.

[01:08] Let's look at what they were new.

[01:10] Let's look at what they are at right now.

[01:13] We're waiting on Pokemon any day now.

[01:17] Maybe it's this week.

[01:18] It's going to be within the next week or so.

[01:21] There's nothing else really happening other than...

[01:24] Beetlejuices are going to start to go out the door in just a few days.

[01:29] Spooky's introduced tokens which I like.

[01:32] You can play the game and do achievements and get tokens which unlock different wizard

[01:39] modes later on in the game.

[01:42] It is now January 12th.

[01:44] There are a lot of people that love pinball around the world.

[01:48] A lot of us have been in this hobby for a long time.

[01:51] Some of you have been in this hobby just much more recently.

[01:54] I know what it's like.

[01:56] When I got into arcade collecting, I know what it's like to not know what things used to

[02:02] go for.

[02:03] I also know what it's like to remember this used to cost that and now it costs this and

[02:11] how that triggers so much anger.

[02:13] These little Neo Geo cabinets I have, they used to sell like 20 years ago for like $1,500

[02:20] to $2,000.

[02:21] Now, they're more like $8,000 to $10,000.

[02:23] 

[02:23] 

[02:23] I don't know.

[02:23] I don't know.

[02:24] I don't know.

[02:24] I don't know.

[02:24] I don't know.

[02:24] I don't know.

[02:24] I don't know.

[02:24] I don't know.

[02:24] I don't know.

[02:24] I don't know.

[02:24] I don't know.

[02:24] 

[02:24] I don't know.

[02:25] I don't know.

[02:25] I don't know.

[02:25] I don't know.

[02:25] I don't know.

[02:25] I don't know.

[02:25] I don't know.

[02:25] I don't know.

[02:25] I don't know.

[02:25] I don't know.

[02:25] I don't know.

[02:25] I don't know.

[02:26] I don't know.

[02:26] I don't know.

[02:26] I don't know.

[02:26] I don't know.

[02:26] I don't know.

[02:26] I don't know.

[02:26] I don't know.

[02:26] I don't know.

[02:27] I don't know.

[02:27] I don't know.

[02:27] 

[02:27] I don't know.

[02:27] I don't know.

[02:27] The thing I like about what I'm about to do is every single game I'm about to list is available for sale today.

[02:36] No waiting, no having to put pre-order money down on a dune topper eight months from now.

[02:42] Everything that I'm about to say, you could reach out to the seller and make an offer and maybe have the game by next weekend.

[02:52] And this is all real tangible pinball.

[02:55] No speculation here.

[02:57] And the numbers don't lie.

[02:59] Love that phrase because they don't.

[03:02] So let's start right now with Stern Pinball, a company that is really making the most pinballs out in the world.

[03:10] I think everybody out there has a little bit of a love hate relationship with Stern.

[03:15] We appreciate everything they've done.

[03:17] We appreciate the fact that they make four machines a year, some cornerstones, some remakes, more like four to five.

[03:24] If you think about the anniversary.

[03:25] And, you know, the remasters and the cornerstone games.

[03:30] But I think universally everybody's just struggling with Stern's new price point.

[03:37] It just hasn't really worked out for anyone who's gone in early on any of these Stern games.

[03:43] So let's go down a list.

[03:45] Star Wars, Fall of the Empire, a $13,000 machine.

[03:52] Just a few months ago.

[03:55] A couple months.

[03:55] A couple months ago.

[03:56] There is one that just sold for $9,900.

[04:01] So that just sold.

[04:02] That seems to be the price where these things will move at, which is over a $3,000 loss in just a couple months.

[04:10] And there is one unsold right now for $10,500.

[04:16] There are a lot of these things new in box, not even opened up for around $11,900.

[04:22] They are asking.

[04:24] I don't think they're going to get that.

[04:25] Especially with an open one being worth around $10,000.

[04:29] There's no reason why anyone's going to spend $2,000 for the cardboard box.

[04:35] Because none of these games have any plays on them.

[04:37] As we all know, Star Wars just was an abysmal failure.

[04:42] It doesn't mean it's not a fun pin.

[04:44] I should have said that at the very beginning.

[04:45] Because I can hear people be like, well, I jumped on it and it's fun.

[04:48] And it's a great game for operators.

[04:50] This is not what this podcast is about.

[04:52] It's about if you were to buy one of these.

[04:54] New in box.

[04:55] This is what you can now get it for.

[04:58] In pretty much perfect condition.

[05:00] And so, Star Wars didn't do well.

[05:03] There is no data right now on the Walking Dead remastered L.E.s.

[05:08] I think we saw some sell for around like $11,500.

[05:11] I think some dealers and distros were making some deals.

[05:14] But right now, I tried to look it up.

[05:16] I didn't find anything on Pinside.

[05:18] Let's go to King Kong, man.

[05:20] King Kong L.E.

[05:22] Ed Robertson's favorite game on tour.

[05:24] King Kong L.E.

[05:26] Another $13,000 game.

[05:29] There is one for sale right now that you could have for $9,800 or best offer.

[05:36] So, what does that mean, right?

[05:38] The good old OBO.

[05:40] Which basically means shave at least $500 off the price and you'll have a deal.

[05:46] So, we're looking at Kong L.E.

[05:47] Another game.

[05:48] A Keith Elwin game, right?

[05:50] The King of the Monsters.

[05:51] Didn't hold.

[05:52] Didn't do very well.

[05:53] Let's go.

[05:54] Let's go to the next recent game.

[05:56] Dungeons and Dragons L.E.

[05:59] The Tyrant's Eye.

[06:01] Seth Davis's eye.

[06:03] He's got his eye on the market.

[06:05] Another $13,000 Stern.

[06:09] Available today if you want to buy it for $9,800.

[06:15] Do you see the pattern here, people?

[06:17] That the world considers Stern L.E.'s to be worth around $10,000.

[06:24] Remember when Godzilla came out, it was $10,500.

[06:33] Everything is sliding in the Stern world to $10,000.

[06:38] Nothing is sliding from $13,000 to $15,000 anymore.

[06:42] Let's keep going.

[06:43] Because there's a game here now, which I think some people are like,

[06:46] No, it's not true, Kaneda.

[06:47] There are some games that have gone up in value.

[06:50] Metallica Remastered L.E.

[06:52] I remember when this game came out.

[06:54] People were spending over to get one.

[06:57] They only made $500 of them.

[06:59] New art package.

[07:01] New code.

[07:02] Sexy game.

[07:02] People dropped $18 on this game.

[07:05] It is now for sale, if you want one today, for $12,950.

[07:12] Look, it hasn't gone up.

[07:14] It went down $50.

[07:16] But it's holding.

[07:17] It is holding.

[07:18] But you see, this is more the anomaly than it is the everyday occurrence.

[07:24] We go to Jaws L.E.

[07:26] Another game that has been bolted to the floor.

[07:28] There is one available for sale right now for $11,995.

[07:34] Not a big loss.

[07:36] Not a big loss.

[07:37] And we all know what happened to Jaws L.E.

[07:39] The damn 50th anniversary with the nicer play field

[07:43] is the reason why these L.E.s are now going to keep going down.

[07:48] Stern keeps burning its own customers.

[07:51] They did it again on Jaws.

[07:53] We're seeing it again.

[07:53] seeing people with LEs swap in the 50th anniversary play field because they love the theme so much.

[08:01] Stern needs to just really reevaluate this strategy. You just never want to make people

[08:06] who love the theme so much ever have to feel like a nicer version of the thing they love

[08:14] has come out after they bought the top of the line version from you. There are some deals out

[08:21] there though, people. Let's keep going. The Uncanny X-Men, another $13,000 game. How much

[08:29] do you think you can go get an LE for today? How about $8,500 is the best price you could offer.

[08:39] Again, with all of these prices, remember, none of these things are sold. You could always negotiate

[08:45] more money off unless it says firm, but nothing's firm in this hobby. Not even your ding-dongs.

[08:51] Okay, so X-Men, huge loss there. That is a, whoa, whoa, I'm trying to do the math right here.

[08:57] That's $1,500 on top of $3,000. That's a $4,500 loss on an X-Men LE. Now, here's the crazy one.

[09:07] This game got made fun of more than anything Stern's done recently. People made so much of

[09:15] a big deal that there were no guns on the artwork. And yet, when you go and try to

[09:21] fight a lot of these games, you're going to get a lot of money off of them. And that's

[09:21] 

[09:21] 

[09:21] a John Wick LE. Guess how many are up for sale? Zero. Zero. And there are wanted ads.

[09:33] This is nuts. So out of all these games, you can go get everything else I just mentioned. There's

[09:38] Godzilla LEs for sale. There's Elvira every edition. There's even a Batman SLE up for sale

[09:43] right now. A Super SLE Batman is up for sale. But yet, John Wick LE, impossible to get.

[09:51] That's crazy. Which means that game's going to hold decently if that is the case. Now,

[09:57] I think the reason why there's none available is they were all selling for around $8,000.

[10:03] So don't think like for a minute, anyone who bought an LE new is happy because you are not

[10:07] getting anywhere near $13,000 for this game. And the reason they all got gobbled up is I think

[10:13] the John Wicks were selling for even less than X-Men. So a lot of these things were sold in

[10:19] trading hands. So I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good

[10:20] thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing.

[10:21] For almost a $5,000 loss. All right. So let's go on to James Bond LE, another $13,000 game right now.

[10:30] James Bond LE, $8,950. A beautiful $4,000 loss. The 60th anniversary game, originally $20,000.

[10:41] You can go get it for $12,500. That is the single biggest loss of any Stern in the history of Stern

[10:47] machines. Even if they won't admit they originally priced it at $12,500, they're going to get it at

[10:50] $20,000. The biggest loss ever. Foo Fighters LE sold out quickly back in the day. $13,000 new,

[10:59] now $8,250. Godzilla LE, baby. Went up a little bit. Still the greatest game maybe of all time.

[11:09] Is it number one? Is it number two? Is Jaws number one right now? Godzilla LE, $12,500.

[11:16] Firm for that game. Is it worth it? $12,500. I don't know. You know,

[11:20] I never really loved the LE package of Godzilla. I actually think you'd be happier with maybe the

[11:26] black and white edition. But you know what? We got to give credit where credit is due. And again,

[11:31] it just goes to show you, when Stern had an LE at $10,500 and made a great game, it went up in value.

[11:39] And when they stopped doing that, everything's crashed in value. And these are crashes,

[11:44] people. These are not normal depreciations. Every single game losing $3,000 to $4,000,

[11:49] and that's your...

[11:50] collectible version of the product. Talk about then the collector part of the market is dead.

[11:57] Like it is dead, but it is not. We are going to see some games that are maybe the only ones

[12:00] worth collecting these days. So KISS LE, I was curious. Because now that the rumor is that KISS

[12:06] is coming back, this is a game that with a topper, people want it like $16,000 to $19,000.

[12:13] Now there's a KISS LE for $13,500. See, that's like right at the price the new LE,

[12:20] and it's going to be $13,000. So if you have a KISS LE right now, I hate to break it to you,

[12:25] but your game is now worth $8,000 or $9,000. Because if they make the new one nicer,

[12:32] again, I'm just going off of what happened to stuff like The Walking Dead,

[12:36] what happened to the old Metallicas, it's kind of over. And unlike Metallica,

[12:43] where they really redid the art so that the other one felt almost completely unique,

[12:49] I think they're going to make it worth $8,000. So if you have a KISS LE right now, I hate to break it to you,

[12:50] but if you have a KISS LE right now, I hate to break it to you,

[12:50] but if you have a KISS LE right now, I hate to break it to you,

[12:50] exactly like the game you have, just better in every single way.

[12:55] And also the KISS topper. Remember when this thing was going for like $5,000?

[12:59] It was unobtainium? Now there's one for sale for $2,500.

[13:04] And they know that most likely they're going to make it again for all the new remasters of KISS.

[13:13] And Jason Knapp says he's pretty much 100% certain it's happening,

[13:16] and I really do trust him when he gets this certain about something.

[13:20] All right, let's go to Jersey Jack. Has Jersey Jack done any better?

[13:24] Well, you know, yes and no. There's some games in the Jersey Jack portfolio that have held nicely,

[13:30] and then there's some that have just been like way bigger losses than anything over at Stern,

[13:36] other than James Bond's 60th. So we got to start with Harry Potter.

[13:40] Harry Potter CE. I'm really, really surprised that not many of these games have gone up for sale.

[13:46] In fact, there's not a single Harry Potter CE for sale.

[13:50] On pin side for less than 15, which means people are just selling the game brand new.

[13:56] And what this means is it's a great game.

[13:59] People don't want to get rid of it. And this is the new trend in pinball.

[14:03] Just buy a great game you love and then you never have to worry about the resale value of it.

[14:09] I'm never selling my Dodge Demon.

[14:11] I'm giving it to Killian later in life when he's like responsible enough to have a car with that much power,

[14:17] but I'm not selling it. I don't care about the money. It's gone up.

[14:20] It's gone down. It's kind of held value. I don't really care.

[14:23] I don't look at the values of demons because I'm keeping mine. It's got my name on it.

[14:28] It's got my name on the vent. It's got my name on everything. Okay, so Harry Potter CE.

[14:33] But I did see on Facebook. There was a dude selling one with low plays for $14,500.

[14:40] Which if I were you, I would just buy a new one.

[14:45] Saving $500 is not enough.

[14:47] I'd much rather get a brand new

[14:49] that new pin smell it arriving at my house in a brand new box versus someone's used game

[14:58] Where something could happen because also remember people the warranties are non-transferable

[15:04] So if you buy a new game for $15,000 and it arrives and it's damaged and something happened

[15:11] You're protected if you buy a used game from someone for $14,500

[15:16] You know, I have a hard time believing you're gonna get the same

[15:19] And protection as if you bought it new so Harry Potter holding strong

[15:26] Elton John collector's edition another

[15:29] $15,000 CE game. How much do you think Elton John now?

[15:33] Look Elton John is a great shooter and so because of that it's held decently it is at

[15:41] $12,500 is the cheapest you can get in Elton John for a loss of

[15:46] 2,500 okay. All right. That's a pretty decent

[15:49] Decent appreciation but also like 12 5 is not exactly like giving the game away

[15:55] We're gonna see some other of these $15,000 JJ peas that have absolutely plummeted

[16:01] All right avatars CE not as popular as Elton John not as good of a shooter

[16:08] But it is a somewhat interesting pin if you ask me, it's still very beautiful

[16:15] 15,000 new the best price you can get an avatar CE for today is

[16:19] $12,000 or best offer again on that OBO you're looking at probably

[16:26] 11 to 11 5 someone would take it because remember at 12 or OBO

[16:31] It's not moving like these games are still for sale. All right now we get to the real

[16:38] difficult

[16:39] Sort of pill to swallow if you bought one of these two games

[16:43] Godfather CE

[16:46] originally

[16:48] $15,000

[16:49] Jack when Ari's dream theme in a box

[16:54] right

[16:55] Godfather CE

[16:57] today

[16:58] nine grand firm gets you on a loss of

[17:05] $6,000 is that the biggest loss in the history of JJP? No, there's another game. That is a much bigger depreciation

[17:14] toy story collectors edition instead of doing anything

[17:19] Andy's room we did Forky and Bonnie and that is why toy story CE in great condition

[17:29] $8,000 firm and you could get one now. This is where it's nuts people like think about that for a minute

[17:35] It's not a terrible game. It's still a beautiful Jersey Jack machine. It comes with the topper and everything eight grand

[17:43] that's

[17:45] $7,000 off the MSRP of a toy story

[17:49] One of the biggest IPs in the world. It's a pat Lawler game

[17:54] Are you telling me you're gonna go buy a brand new Stern premium for like?

[17:59] 9,500 when you can get a toy story CE

[18:02] For eight just goes to show you how badly they missed the mark on that game

[18:08] And then you know I had to throw Guns N' Roses CE in here the game I own

[18:13] now look there is only the cheapest you can get it for on pin side right now is

[18:19] $12,000 or best offer I'm not I am NOT gonna pretend like I have not seen

[18:26] Guns N' Roses CE sell for around ten five to eleven thousand dollars they have

[18:33] So this is a game that is very polarizing

[18:36] They made so many of them and I think if you really want to move your CE quickly

[18:42] You're around like ten to ten five and you'll get a buyer, but I don't think much more than that will make the game move

[18:49] All right, let's go to barrels of fun

[18:52] Labyrinth how much was labyrinth new I think it was around the same price as dune

[18:56] I think it was like eleven six around that price. Maybe I don't know maybe it's a little bit less

[19:01] I'm not sure if they had a price increase, but you can go get a labyrinth right now

[19:05] There's a few of them for sale the cheapest price is

[19:09] 8,300 another game that really didn't catch on and there's like a decent amount of labyrinth games for sale

[19:16] What there's not for sale?

[19:18] There are no

[19:19] Dunes up for sale, so they did the last call and I went on pin side and nothing there's just no numbers

[19:26] There is no secondhand dunes for sale. There are also no

[19:31] secondhand spots being traded for Winchester's mystery house

[19:35] So we all know Winchester is gonna go for a pretty penny the moment people start

[19:42] Speculating in the market. I would say right now you could easily get

[19:47] five to seven thousand over for your Winchester spot and I am very proud of this

[19:55] Community where not a single person is doing that. I don't understand I would take the money

[20:01] I'm telling you right now

[20:03] The reason I would take the money I would take like five to seven grand sell your spot

[20:09] Because a year from now when all these games are out and barrels moves on to their next game

[20:15] I don't think Winchester is going to go above, much above like 11.6.

[20:20] And so think about that.

[20:22] If you sell your spot for seven over and then a year from now when the code is done, let's say someone even wants 12 for it.

[20:30] All right.

[20:30] So you just got a $12,000 Winchester for five grand because you just sold your spot.

[20:38] And then you bought back in when the game was finished, when it was coded, and you made such a smart move.

[20:44] Are you telling me nobody out there is thinking this way?

[20:47] What happened to you guys?

[20:49] Get some guts.

[20:50] Do some scalping.

[20:51] It's fun.

[20:52] All right.

[20:53] Let's go to Spooky, baby.

[20:54] Spooky Pinball.

[20:55] I kind of want to go from the bottom up.

[20:57] I want to go from the bottom up with Spooky.

[20:58] So Scooby-Doo I looked at.

[21:00] And maybe that's not the bottom up.

[21:01] But Scooby-Doo right now, they made a lot of them.

[21:04] I don't think they made all of them.

[21:05] They said they were going to make 1,969 of them for 1969, the year the show came out.

[21:11] Way too many.

[21:12] They know that.

[21:13] They've changed their strategy.

[21:14] You can go get a Scooby-Doo collector's edition for $6,600.

[21:20] I mean, that's crazy.

[21:21] Price of a Stern Pro.

[21:23] It's a wide body.

[21:24] It's got a lot more in it than a Stern Pro.

[21:26] I think the code is pretty fun.

[21:28] Might be too easy for most people.

[21:30] And so, yeah.

[21:31] But that's not the worst, man.

[21:32] The worst is Ultraman.

[21:33] I got out of my Ultraman deposit.

[21:35] You can go get an Ultraman today for $4,900.

[21:39] I mean, even that, man.

[21:41] I've seen some Ultraman go.

[21:43] For, like, $4,900.

[21:44] Like, high threes to get rid of it quickly.

[21:48] Halloween, the platform that shared itself with Ultraman, $5,800 or best offer on Halloween.

[21:56] Right?

[21:56] Good prices out here.

[21:57] Like I said, it's a buyer's market.

[22:00] Now, this is where it gets bad.

[22:02] Think about that for a minute.

[22:03] A $5,800 Halloween.

[22:05] Guess how much the only Evil Dead for sale is right now on Pinside.

[22:11] There's only one available.

[22:12] $1,900.

[22:14] $1,000.

[22:17] $19,000.

[22:18] That is almost $14,000 more than what you can go get a freaking Halloween for.

[22:26] Is it really worth $19,000?

[22:28] I mean, supply and demand?

[22:29] I don't think so.

[22:30] I wouldn't pay that for an Evil Dead.

[22:32] I don't know how you stomach paying that for an Evil Dead.

[22:35] I think Beetlejuice is going to end up being an even better game.

[22:38] But, man.

[22:38] But, man.

[22:39] Talk about a company now.

[22:40] Both Spooky and Barrels are really the only.

[22:44] Two companies with these crazy appreciating collectible items.

[22:50] They're the only two.

[22:51] Name me someone else out there that has anything headed north like this.

[22:56] Nowhere.

[22:57] So, speaking of that.

[22:59] If you want to go get a Beetlejuice spot, there actually is a spot for sale.

[23:04] And it is $4,000 over the deposit.

[23:08] So, if you give the guy $4,000, you then pay full price for the entire game.

[23:12] That $4,000 does not include.

[23:14] The $2,500 deposit on the game.

[23:18] Okay.

[23:19] So, yeah.

[23:20] Beetlejuice.

[23:20] As I said.

[23:21] Beetlejuice is going to be another game.

[23:23] Much like Winchester.

[23:24] Much like Evil Dead.

[23:26] These games are not going to come up very often.

[23:29] They're going to be bolted to so many people's collections.

[23:32] And if you ever get a chance to get one.

[23:35] They're going to be very expensive.

[23:37] So, good job on Spooky.

[23:39] Good job, Barrels.

[23:40] Boys.

[23:41] You now have done what you want to do.

[23:43] You've created.

[23:44] You've created a lot more demand than supply.

[23:47] That's not the case over at Stern.

[23:49] And like I've been saying with these boutiques.

[23:51] The reason why the value holds so well.

[23:54] Is there's never going to be another run of any of them.

[23:57] And that is the number one reason.

[24:00] Stern Pinball has lost.

[24:03] All the confidence and all the trust between the collectors and Stern.

[24:09] They just kept remaking stuff.

[24:12] And they're doing it again.

[24:13] Because.

[24:14] Imagine if Spooky did another run of Beetlejuice.

[24:17] During an anniversary year.

[24:19] Or another Evil Dead.

[24:20] Or another Rick and Morty.

[24:22] You absolutely then send everybody packing.

[24:25] And they will never buy from you again.

[24:27] I still don't think Stern understands that very simple concept.

[24:31] Alright.

[24:32] Let's keep going baby.

[24:33] CGC.

[24:34] Attack from Mars.

[24:35] You don't see these games come up very often.

[24:37] And there's not many for sale.

[24:39] If you want Attack from Mars LE.

[24:41] The cheapest one is $14,500.

[24:44] $14,550.

[24:47] You know I think Attack from Mars and Medieval Madness.

[24:50] Are the two most popular CGC remakes.

[24:53] Monster Bash LE is $11,500.

[24:57] That's a little bit over what it was brand new.

[25:00] Remember CGC games were around $10,000.

[25:03] So again they all went up a little bit.

[25:05] But one that has not.

[25:07] Is Cactus Canyon.

[25:09] The Cactus Canyon LEs.

[25:11] I think they botched that whole thing.

[25:13] The weight.

[25:14] To get one.

[25:15] The upgrade kit.

[25:16] The weight for the code.

[25:17] All of it made people sort of not really love.

[25:21] The Cactus Canyon Return.

[25:23] It's also the worst out of all their games.

[25:25] By far.

[25:26] Even though it has a lot of toys in it.

[25:28] It's not considered the best gameplay experience.

[25:31] So at Cactus Canyon LE.

[25:33] $8,475.

[25:35] Or best offer.

[25:36] Which means.

[25:37] I bet you could sneak one out for like $7,900.

[25:42] Medieval Madness.

[25:43] So they had the LE.

[25:44] Which is $11,000.

[25:46] They've got the Royal Edition.

[25:48] The cheapest you can get it for.

[25:49] Is $15,000.

[25:51] Or best offer.

[25:52] And then they've got the new Merlin Edition.

[25:54] Which the cheapest you can get it for.

[25:56] Is $11,000.

[25:58] OBO.

[25:59] Remember again.

[26:00] Around $10,000 new.

[26:02] They keep remaking Medieval Madnesses.

[26:04] To the point now.

[26:05] Where I don't think any of them.

[26:07] Are really worth more than around $10,000 or $11,000.

[26:11] I would never spend.

[26:12] $10,000 on a Royal Edition.

[26:15] And there's just something.

[26:16] Off with CGC lately.

[26:18] I think they've lost a lot of the goodwill.

[26:20] With the community.

[26:21] And I think because of that.

[26:23] People just don't care as much anymore.

[26:26] About these CGC games.

[26:28] Dutch Pinball.

[26:29] The Big Lebowski.

[26:31] Remember the Big Lebowski.

[26:33] The only game they've made.

[26:35] Next to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[26:37] So the Big Lebowski.

[26:39] I want to say this game was.

[26:41] Like $13,000.

[26:42] In 2005.

[26:42] When they remade it.

[26:44] And they brought it back.

[26:45] Wasn't it around that?

[26:46] Like $13,000.

[26:47] You can now go get.

[26:49] A mint condition Lebowski.

[26:51] For $10,500.

[26:54] I mean.

[26:54] Hasn't held value.

[26:56] Not a huge loss.

[26:58] But you know.

[26:59] You see the way the market's going.

[27:01] The next stop for the Big Lebowski.

[27:03] Especially if they get to Back to the Future.

[27:06] Is definitely going to be.

[27:08] In the $9,000 to $8,500 range.

[27:11] I went to the Big Lebowski.

[27:11] I went to see if there were any Alice machines for sale.

[27:15] And there are not.

[27:16] But I did see some sell.

[27:18] For like around $11,500.

[27:22] I think.

[27:23] New in box.

[27:24] So it's not going up in value.

[27:26] It's not crashing in value.

[27:29] But I don't think Alice will ever go up.

[27:32] And I think again.

[27:33] Once things start to slide.

[27:36] They're going to keep sliding.

[27:37] The more time goes on.

[27:39] The more these games become.

[27:41] Yesterday's news.

[27:43] Especially if these games are not great.

[27:45] Right?

[27:46] That's really what it comes down to.

[27:48] If Alice was amazing.

[27:50] And the code was phenomenal.

[27:52] And the mechs were incredible.

[27:54] And the gameplay experience was.

[27:56] You know.

[27:56] Talked about with accolades and praise.

[27:59] It'd be a different story.

[28:01] But it's kind of the opposite.

[28:03] You know.

[28:03] It's a beautiful game.

[28:05] They made J-Pop's vision work.

[28:07] But next to modern games.

[28:09] It's not going to be a rewarding gameplay experience.

[28:14] For most of you out there.

[28:16] And because of that.

[28:17] The price will reflect that.

[28:19] And people just don't care.

[28:21] They really don't care anymore.

[28:23] To walk in and see one of these J-Pop brain fart games.

[28:26] In your game room.

[28:28] Does not telegraph anything anymore.

[28:30] Like people just don't care.

[28:33] Alright.

[28:33] So speaking about not caring.

[28:34] P3 Multimorphic.

[28:36] Let's see.

[28:36] Princess Bride at $9,500 or best offer.

[28:39] And then.

[28:39] Princess Bride at $9,500 or best offer.

[28:40] Portal at $10,620.

[28:43] Which is basically like a new in box game.

[28:46] That's $1,000 off.

[28:47] It's really hard with Multimorphic P3.

[28:49] Or P3 Multimorphic.

[28:51] Because they've got all the kits.

[28:54] And you know.

[28:54] Look.

[28:54] One of the biggest financial losses you'll ever take.

[28:58] Is if you buy one of these things.

[28:59] And all the kits.

[29:00] And then try to go sell it.

[29:02] Like you will literally lose.

[29:04] At least like 10 G's.

[29:06] If you bought all the kits.

[29:08] It's just.

[29:09] Nobody wants all of that.

[29:11] It's just such a weird strategy.

[29:14] He's never going to change it.

[29:15] I'm not even going to discuss it anymore.

[29:18] Pedretti Funhouse Remake.

[29:20] $7,200 or best offer.

[29:22] Nobody wants that game.

[29:24] Pinball Brothers Alien.

[29:26] $7,500.

[29:28] Turner Ninja Eclipse.

[29:29] Which was once going.

[29:30] I think people were trying to like.

[29:32] Fluff this thing up to around like 10 G's once.

[29:35] $7,200 or best offer.

[29:38] And the new one.

[29:38] The Merlin's Arcade at $8,500.

[29:41] All right.

[29:41] So look.

[29:42] The key takeaway is this people.

[29:44] All of these games.

[29:45] All of these games now.

[29:47] Except for just like two or three.

[29:49] Are losing money.

[29:51] And there are some of them are just normal depreciation.

[29:53] Which is fine.

[29:54] I don't think anybody has a problem.

[29:56] Sort of like buying an Elton John.

[29:59] Enjoying it for like two, three years.

[30:01] And you go to sell it.

[30:02] And you lose like two grand.

[30:04] $2,500.

[30:04] That seems a little normal.

[30:06] I mean you don't love that.

[30:07] But whatever.

[30:08] It is what it is.

[30:08] It is what it is.

[30:09] It is the Stern machines that are the most concerning for me.

[30:11] Because they are losing so much instantly.

[30:14] And that instant depreciation.

[30:16] I don't know how they like convince people to keep buying.

[30:20] And you know that their customer is not even you and me.

[30:22] It is the distros.

[30:23] How are they going to keep convincing these distros.

[30:26] To put in orders.

[30:27] To get their allocations.

[30:28] When no one wants them.

[30:30] Like just nobody wants them at these prices.

[30:32] And you know a lot of dealers and distros are doing the backdoor deals.

[30:36] They are taking the money on the table.

[30:38] Right.

[30:38] Their margin might be like $2,500 on the game.

[30:41] Or a little bit more than that.

[30:43] And they are willing to cut that margin in half.

[30:45] Just to get the game out the door.

[30:47] Because now they got to go sell all those premiums and pros.

[30:50] They also committed to.

[30:52] And so I love seeing the way the market is dictating this hobby.

[30:59] When it comes to buying.

[31:01] Now you know me.

[31:02] You know me.

[31:03] I think it is still a wait and see market.

[31:06] It will always be.

[31:08] A wait and see market now.

[31:10] Forever.

[31:10] I like what Jersey Jack is doing.

[31:12] Where their new emphasis is on just making the greatest games they can make.

[31:17] And they are not going to do any FOMO shenanigans.

[31:20] And they are just going to like.

[31:21] If you want the nicest version of Sonic.

[31:24] We will make it for you.

[31:25] I like that.

[31:26] Because you pair that.

[31:28] With Spooky and Barrels.

[31:29] Two companies making very limited runs of games.

[31:33] And never making those games again.

[31:35] That is going to scratch the itch of the collector.

[31:38] And then I look over at Stern.

[31:40] And I am like.

[31:40] What is the strategy?

[31:42] What really is the strategy here?

[31:44] When your LEs instantly are worth the price of the premium.

[31:47] Which means your premiums are not worth anywhere near $10,000.

[31:51] And then you just look at it like.

[31:52] Well maybe I will just play Stern Pros on location.

[31:54] And have fun.

[31:55] Because the code is exactly the same.

[31:57] That is what I love about this hobby.

[31:59] Is you had a company like Stern that was dominating.

[32:02] With a strategy that was working so well.

[32:05] And then they priced themselves out of their own.

[32:08] And now it doesn't work at all.

[32:11] In my honest opinion.

[32:12] And I do think that this hobby.

[32:15] Is going to start to see.

[32:16] The enthusiasm and the momentum.

[32:19] Happening around JJP more.

[32:22] And the boutique space more.

[32:23] And now that all these companies are making phenomenal products.

[32:27] I mean you put these games next to the Stern machines.

[32:30] And they make the Stern machines look so cheap.

[32:32] And I know there is people out there that are like.

[32:33] Kaneda you become anti-Stern.

[32:35] I haven't.

[32:36] I haven't.

[32:36] I am just observing.

[32:38] What a Stern Star Wars looks like for $13,000.

[32:42] Next to a Beetlejuice for $10,000.

[32:46] Next to a Dune for $11,600.

[32:48] It doesn't look nearly as good.

[32:50] It doesn't look like they put as much effort in.

[32:53] It doesn't look like the value is there.

[32:55] And if it was just me saying it.

[32:57] I wouldn't be able to do a show like this.

[32:59] That just showed you.

[33:01] If you bought every Stern LE.

[33:03] Over the last like 3 to 4 years.

[33:05] On average.

[33:06] You are losing $4,000.

[33:08] A game.

[33:09] A game.

[33:10] And so if you buy 3 Stern LEs.

[33:12] A year from now.

[33:14] You just lost $12,000.

[33:16] On just 3 games.

[33:18] This has never happened before.

[33:19] In the history of pinball buying.

[33:21] And for those people that say it's normal.

[33:23] It's like a car.

[33:24] No.

[33:24] You need a car to get from A to B.

[33:27] Do you need all these new machines?

[33:28] And also.

[33:29] Like I just proved to each and every one of you.

[33:31] If you just wait.

[33:33] If you just wait it.

[33:35] You can march in now.

[33:36] And go get all of these games.

[33:38] And save that $12,000.

[33:40] That's the smart move.

[33:42] You know I've noticed.

[33:43] The reason why a lot of the content creators in Canada.

[33:45] The ones we used to have issues with.

[33:46] We all get along now.

[33:47] Because they all see it.

[33:49] They all see it.

[33:50] The drum I was beating.

[33:51] They've all felt it now.

[33:53] They got bit by the pinball bug.

[33:55] They came in.

[33:55] They were excited.

[33:56] They were enthusiastic.

[33:57] They were buying every LE.

[33:59] And then they realized.

[34:00] Wait.

[34:00] What just happened?

[34:01] How did I just lose all this money?

[34:03] This little guy over there in Connecticut.

[34:05] Canada.

[34:06] Saying wait and see.

[34:07] And you were.

[34:08] You will be able to march in.

[34:09] And get everything.

[34:10] And I think that's still the case.

[34:12] I'm really excited to see what happens.

[34:13] In pinball this year.

[34:15] I don't think Pokemon.

[34:16] Is going to be one of these games.

[34:17] That skyrockets in value.

[34:19] I just don't think there's the overlap.

[34:21] Enough overlap.

[34:22] Between the Pokemon fans.

[34:24] And the pinball buying demographic.

[34:27] I just don't see it.

[34:28] And I don't think Gomez.

[34:30] Is going to design a Pokemon game.

[34:33] That's going to blow us away.

[34:35] We shall see in just a week or so.

[34:37] Everybody.

[34:37] Love you.

[34:39] Happy Monday.

[34:39] Canada out.

[35:07] ...
