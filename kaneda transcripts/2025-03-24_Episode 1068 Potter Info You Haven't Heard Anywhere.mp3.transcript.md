[00:00] The next game, the next Jersey Jack game,

[00:04] Terry Potter, we know that.

[00:08] I would not spend the time out of your pocket until you see the game.

[00:18] I wouldn't spend anything, nothing.

[00:21] And if I'm wrong when you see the game, you let me know.

[00:24] It's going to be spectacular.

[00:27] Of course it's going to be. Jersey Jack said that.

[00:30] It took me 10 years to get the license.

[00:32] Only 10 years.

[00:34] And X millions of dollars.

[00:38] We have all the movies.

[00:40] We have all the assets.

[00:41] I can't wait to see the internet blow up.

[00:45] If you think Wizard of Oz was something, you're going to love the game.

[00:49] So I can't really, I could really say a lot more, but I'm not going to.

[00:54] Spring started yesterday, so you'll see the game this spring.

[00:59] I got glister in the sun.

[01:02] Let me go on.

[01:05] Big hands.

[01:06] I know you're the one.

[01:07] I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said.

[01:12] Oh, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[01:15] Jersey Jack, did he just like spoil the entire reveal of confirming that it's going to be

[01:22] Harry Potter after an hour seminar in which they're trying to sell people more avatar games.

[01:30] He then tells everybody not to spend a dime on anything until you see Harry Potter.

[01:37] You can't write a weirder way to announce to the world that you have the second biggest license in

[01:46] pinball history.

[01:47] Star Wars is the biggest.

[01:49] It's going to be Harry Potter.

[01:51] And when we get Pokemon, that will be the number one biggest IP ever in the history of pinball.

[01:57] But man, what a weird way to get the news.

[02:01] I loved Retro Ralph when he added even more of a thunderous applause.

[02:06] We're going to talk about that.

[02:08] And I have some Harry Potter info for you.

[02:11] You know why you come to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[02:15] I've got something for you that I haven't heard anywhere else.

[02:19] Jersey Jack loves to talk.

[02:22] There's rumors everywhere.

[02:24] So we're going to deliver this as a rumor, but it's what I'm hearing and some of it you haven't heard before.

[02:31] We'll get to that later.

[02:33] So Texas Spinball Festival has concluded.

[02:36] And what did we get?

[02:37] We got some portal gameplay footage.

[02:40] We got Merlin's Arcade, Cactus Canyon, Remake, Lyman, Sheets, his code is now available for the world.

[02:47] I want to give my opinions and thoughts on what we saw at the show.

[02:51] And I want to just thank everybody who went to the show and record it.

[02:55] Really nice 4K video footage of the show.

[03:00] I mean, you don't even have to go there.

[03:02] You can see everything in living color on YouTube.

[03:06] So thank you, content creators, for making those of us who are not attending feel like we are at the show itself.

[03:14] And I want to say when they did the tour,

[03:16] one of the things that just stood out right away was how far spooky pinball has come in the pinball world.

[03:23] Those evil deads were gorgeous, gorgeous.

[03:26] I remember when this company had like America's most haunted and Rob Zombie.

[03:31] This company really, when you look at their modern games,

[03:36] they are punching in the heavyweight division with the kind of stunning machines they are bringing to pinball.

[03:43] And everyone's going to go crazy when they make a game look that sexy.

[03:49] And it's something like Beetlejuice or it's something like Gremlins or Goonies.

[03:54] Right?

[03:54] Once they get a little bit more mainstream with the theme,

[04:00] this company is going to be in the driver's seat for the next three to four years.

[04:06] If they just move the needle a little bit more mainstream, they know that.

[04:11] They've got Franchi over there.

[04:13] Man, oh man, his art package on Evil Dead gets better every time I see it.

[04:18] Now, speaking of Franchi art packages,

[04:20] did you see the 25th anniversary of the big Lebowski, which was actually like a few years ago?

[04:26] He clearly did a treatment.

[04:28] Now, I'm not sure like if Barry paid for that or if he did it organically and shared it with Barry as a possibility.

[04:36] I want to say though, I love Franchi's artwork.

[04:40] I do.

[04:41] I think his artwork is some of the best we've ever seen in Pimbal,

[04:46] but I don't like it on the big Lebowski.

[04:48] It's too busy.

[04:49] It's just way too busy.

[04:52] I prefer the big Lebowski as it is with the big logo on the sides,

[04:58] because then all of your attention is on the game itself.

[05:02] It's also like we don't think about the big Lebowski in that kind of art collage style.

[05:07] You know, sometimes it looks good.

[05:09] It looks good on Evil Dead, but for some reason seeing Lebowski there with all the characters,

[05:14] it just felt a little crowded.

[05:16] And the thing with the big Lebowski is there's so much fun stuff on the play field.

[05:20] You almost don't want the art to be too distracting.

[05:23] And that's why I think the original art package works the best.

[05:27] All right.

[05:27] So what else do we see at the show?

[05:28] We got Portal.

[05:29] I've been reading people's feedback on Portal.

[05:32] It looks like people had a good reception to the game.

[05:34] I still think people are hesitant to pull the trigger considering how much money it is.

[05:41] But to date, it is looking like Portal is probably the best P3 game to date.

[05:48] And for people looking for something different, maybe, right?

[05:51] I think everyone is probably still waiting to see King Kong and also Harry Potter.

[05:56] I also think market research has shown us that people, when you spend this much money,

[06:02] you just want a dedicated machine.

[06:04] You just want one machine that plays one game and that's what you want.

[06:10] And if the market wanted this sort of swappable play field system,

[06:15] then there would be much more sales around it.

[06:18] And you could argue that maybe the games haven't been there,

[06:21] but now that he's getting the games to where they maybe always should have been,

[06:26] it's really expensive.

[06:29] And I think a lot of people in general are feeling that burn.

[06:32] It's like the new in-box excitement just ain't there at these prices.

[06:36] But that's not true of everything because we saw Chicago gaming companies,

[06:41] Merlin's edition of Medieval Madness Remake.

[06:45] Look how well it sold.

[06:47] 1,000 coming back.

[06:49] Distros had their allocations severely cut.

[06:53] I think CGC and Rick at Planetary are selling more of these directly

[06:59] because they don't have to give money then to the distros.

[07:01] So they're going to make more money in-house.

[07:04] And that's why I think a lot of people didn't get a phone call

[07:07] if you were on your distros list for this game.

[07:10] They just didn't get nearly as many as they did on the previous editions

[07:15] of Medieval Madness, but 1,000 units.

[07:18] And what was the price?

[07:19] Like $12,500.

[07:22] And I think most of them are spoken for.

[07:24] And I'm not surprised.

[07:26] It's one of the best games of all time.

[07:28] The used market for the Royal editions have been like, I don't know,

[07:32] $14,000, $15,000, $16,000, $18,000, $19,000.

[07:36] And so now you can get a brand new one, which looks really good, by the way.

[07:40] I don't think it looks as good as the Royal, but they both look really good

[07:45] and nobody wants to pay over.

[07:48] And so now I think all of these early editions of Medieval Madness

[07:52] are going to hold strong around $12,000.

[07:56] It's still Medieval Madness, right?

[07:58] It's still in the top five best games of all time.

[08:01] And for a lot of people out there, you don't want to spend 45 minutes on a game.

[08:06] You don't want these deep, complex rule sets.

[08:10] You just want to hop on a machine and have fun.

[08:13] And this game really does deliver that.

[08:15] Also, because the code is a little bit more shallow than modern games,

[08:19] you will see these things pop up for sale.

[08:22] Like, people will buy them, they'll enjoy them for six months,

[08:25] and then they'll want to move on.

[08:27] But man, I think a lot of people underestimated how well this game would sell.

[08:31] And it just proves my point.

[08:34] It's never a bad time to release a great game.

[08:39] It's always a bad time to release a mediocre game or a game that's not great.

[08:45] So what else did we see at Texas Pinball Festival?

[08:49] We saw Merlin's Arcade.

[08:51] I watched about 20 minutes of Merlin gameplay and that song just playing over and over and over and over again.

[09:00] And the sound of that foosball spinner sounds like you're chopping some wood.

[09:05] Now look, this game is much simpler than everything else in the marketplace.

[09:11] Yes, Chris Turner is a super nice guy.

[09:13] He's listening to this right now.

[09:15] He's a Canadian club member.

[09:17] I'm just not sure.

[09:19] I just don't think at $9,000 there's enough going on here.

[09:24] And the code itself doesn't seem that far along and it just begs the question.

[09:30] I know you're in Texas, but this game got a lot to go code-wise.

[09:37] And you're only going to get one chance to make a first impression.

[09:41] And I don't think the code is far enough along to have shown this game.

[09:47] And you need to show this game with all of the bells and whistles going.

[09:51] If you're going to try to get people to buy at $9,000 this machine, you walk over and for just a few more bucks,

[10:00] you can go get an Evil Dead or an X-Men Premium or any Stern Premium.

[10:05] Right? It's just at that price point, you can go get a Pulp Fiction.

[10:10] So I just think if I'm going to give Chris another bit of advice,

[10:14] I just think you need to get this thing baked a lot more.

[10:18] And I know you wanted to show something at Texas, but I'd be curious how many people actually ordered.

[10:25] I don't think they sold a hundred Merlin's Arcade.

[10:29] And then it's like, now what? Right? Now what are you going to do?

[10:31] I think what Chris needs, and again, looking at the artwork and the simplicity of this game,

[10:36] I really think he needs a creative director to join him.

[10:41] He needs to invest in that money now.

[10:44] The artwork is fine, but it does look like artwork I would see on books I buy for Killian.

[10:50] It looks like artwork that would be in a book for a four-year-old boy.

[10:54] And we're 40 to 60 year old men. It's just not there, right?

[10:58] It's like, I don't know who the target audience is for a game like this.

[11:03] Is it children? We know children don't really play much pinball.

[11:07] And you're still going to have to convince someone in a household who's 40 to 60 to drop $9,000.

[11:15] And again, I think if you're sitting in a conference room and you're saying,

[11:19] well, what can we make that's going to make that target audience spend this much money,

[11:24] I don't know how you land on a game like this.

[11:29] So Chris, we should talk.

[11:31] You need a creative director that has a vision on how to apply all of your innovation,

[11:37] all of your technologies, all of your effort will be in vain if you don't nail the theme more

[11:44] and you don't make a product that's more enticing to the pinball buying demographic.

[11:49] And I'll say this, the hardest thing when you're a nice person like Chris Turner,

[11:54] the hardest thing is nobody ever gives you real feedback because they don't want to be mean to someone

[12:01] who's really nice.

[12:03] And that's always a blessing and a curse when you're making a creative product like this.

[12:09] I've seen this.

[12:09] I see it at work when I go into work every day.

[12:12] There's really nice people who deliver ideas that are stinkers.

[12:15] And it's really hard to give them feedback because you don't want to hurt their feelings.

[12:20] But as I said, if you can't sell to a global pinball buying world,

[12:25] if you can't get a thousand people to want your product, you're not doing it right.

[12:32] There are tens of thousands of people that are the potential pinball buying demo.

[12:37] And I mean that.

[12:38] If you're struggling to sell 200 games, you did something wrong.

[12:43] All right, so that's Merlin's Arcade.

[12:45] What else we got at the show?

[12:47] The faces are blurry.

[12:49] In that electric playground pulp fiction topper for $1,500.

[12:54] It has been confirmed they are blurry faces.

[12:58] So they did not break IP infringement.

[13:01] They went by the letter of the law and released a topper that looks a little funny,

[13:06] a little weird, will it sell?

[13:08] I don't think so.

[13:09] End of story.

[13:10] OK, all right.

[13:11] What else do we see at Texas Pinball Festival?

[13:13] What am I missing?

[13:14] Anything big?

[13:15] I know you want this Harry Potter information I'm sitting on.

[13:18] Before I get to that, I want to talk a little bit about Dungeons and Dragons.

[13:22] I got about 10 games on the machine and I want to report back that I think the game

[13:28] is an amazing shooter.

[13:30] It really is.

[13:31] And you can tell, right?

[13:32] The moment you first start playing a game, it has a lot of great shots, a lot of satisfying shots.

[13:40] I love the music.

[13:41] I love the callouts.

[13:42] What that game does?

[13:44] It does so damn well.

[13:47] That dragon is huge.

[13:49] It's just such a nice game to stand over.

[13:51] And I really do think Stern delivered a phenomenal pinball machine, except for one major issue

[13:58] I have with the game.

[13:59] I just don't like the artwork.

[14:01] I think the game's kind of ugly.

[14:03] And as I look down a row of Stern machines, this is a stinker when it comes to art package.

[14:09] It really is.

[14:10] I know they worked with a D&D artist, but there's just something about the art package

[14:14] that just doesn't pull you in.

[14:17] It just looks a little like AI created.

[14:20] It looks a little flat.

[14:22] It lacks depth.

[14:23] And also what's on the art is just not that interesting to look at.

[14:27] And I just think they could have done a better job.

[14:29] I that's my thing about D&D is like, I love the game.

[14:32] I love the way it shoots.

[14:34] It is a little confusing when you first walk up to the machine and you're selecting characters.

[14:38] You have to be a D&D nerd to get into this game.

[14:41] But man, that gameplay is awesome.

[14:44] And I can't tell if maybe it's because I'm always playing guns and roses that some of these new

[14:50] Stern machines just seem so satisfying within five minutes, because I'm finally playing

[14:56] something that shoots normal.

[14:57] And maybe my base level for gameplay is so low that I'm overly praising some of these

[15:04] games because they just shoot normal.

[15:06] But no, I think it's a great shooting game.

[15:08] I played some John Wick for the first time and yeah, not interested.

[15:12] Really not interested.

[15:14] Also with Wick, what's weird is like the flippers feel like they're even slanted down more than

[15:20] normal, cradling the balls a little bit harder.

[15:24] The whole game feels a little narrow and pinched in my honest opinion.

[15:28] And after playing John Wick for like 10 minutes, I was good.

[15:32] If I don't play it again, I really wouldn't care.

[15:35] Same thing again.

[15:35] I hopped on Avatar.

[15:37] I'm like, let me play more Avatar.

[15:39] Let me see if like I'm missing something.

[15:42] And again, it's just a sterile game.

[15:45] I didn't care the call-outs, the Iwajii, Wawama, whatever they're saying.

[15:50] You don't care about any of it.

[15:51] None of it.

[15:52] None of us have an emotional connection to any of the subject matter in Avatar.

[15:58] And man, after Jack just said, don't spend any money on anything until you see Harry Potter,

[16:04] he didn't do Mark's side and any favors up there on stage.

[16:07] I mean, I feel like that was a little bit disrespectful.

[16:11] Mark's up there trying to sell his game, get people interested in his game,

[16:16] and then you just pull the rug from underneath him like that.

[16:19] That could not have been the plan.

[16:21] Ken Cromwell probably had no idea that was about to happen.

[16:25] Because if they really wanted to announce the next game was Harry Potter,

[16:29] they would have had a slide or a little video teaser.

[16:32] They would have flashed the logo with a lightning bolt somehow.

[16:35] And again, it just goes to show it's like Jack doesn't want to be upstaged by anybody.

[16:40] Else. And you know, he probably walked around the show,

[16:44] all the conversations about other people's products, not his avatar.

[16:49] And then so he just wanted the attention he knows he's going to get.

[16:52] But he just did it prematurely.

[16:55] I did think it was in bad form to do it on that stage that way.

[16:59] All right, so let's just get to some rumors I'm hearing and let's talk about it.

[17:03] So here's what I'm hearing.

[17:04] And there's a lot of rumors swirling around Harry Potter.

[17:07] There was a rumor that the game is barren.

[17:09] And I heard people sharing this like this weekend.

[17:12] Hey, I'm hearing Harry Potter is barren.

[17:15] So I'm here to tell you right now from someone who's seen the game,

[17:18] someone who's seen everything in it, that this game is not barren at all.

[17:24] It is loaded like Wizard of Oz.

[17:27] So when Jack says, if you liked Wizard of Oz, you're going to like this game.

[17:31] He is being 100% accurate.

[17:34] So that is exciting.

[17:36] A standard body Jersey Jack game that is loaded.

[17:40] Think about it.

[17:40] The only time we really, really got a loaded standard body game.

[17:45] Maybe what dialed in what's going to be interesting is if we see the return

[17:50] of things like upper playfields and how will they make that work?

[17:54] We got an upper playfield on guns and roses.

[17:57] It definitely slows down the gameplay with those upper playfields.

[18:00] But I think they might find a way to add speed and add layers of gameplay.

[18:06] To Harry Potter.

[18:07] I think when we think about a loaded Harry Potter game,

[18:10] you're going to have to have that Hogwarts castle.

[18:13] You're going to have to have some like candlelit use of the lighting.

[18:18] If it's rainbow puke, I will be disappointed.

[18:21] I think Jersey Jack really needs to look at this theme and make sure they don't

[18:25] just jam in, you know, their hot rails, like rainbow Christmas trees into a Harry

[18:32] Potter world.

[18:33] That's not what Harry Potter lighting should be.

[18:36] So we also heard from Jack that they have all the movies, not just the first

[18:40] three that was the rumor, all of the movies.

[18:43] And he said, we have all of the assets.

[18:45] Now, here's the thing I'm worried about is Jack always says that.

[18:49] And then they don't use all of the assets.

[18:51] So here's something I am hearing.

[18:53] And I hope this is true.

[18:55] I am hearing that the clips in the movies, they have it all.

[19:00] And the clips are not muted, that you are going to see the sequences from the

[19:05] film and the voices of the actors.

[19:09] And we're going to get it as you would see it in the movie.

[19:12] No more muted clips.

[19:14] And I think this is incredible if it becomes a reality.

[19:18] He worked on this license for 10 years and spent millions of dollars to get it.

[19:23] So I hope they have it all.

[19:25] I still would love to hear how they convinced J.K.

[19:27] Rowling to give them the license.

[19:29] Maybe it's just like from one billionaire to another.

[19:32] I bet that's what happened.

[19:33] I bet Leonard's like, look, you've got a few billion.

[19:35] I've got a few billion.

[19:37] Let's make a game together.

[19:38] All right.

[19:39] So they got that.

[19:40] What else am I hearing?

[19:41] OK, so I have a few other things that you're going to find very juicy.

[19:45] The number one thing is I am now hearing that there will be three trims, which you

[19:50] know, but I am also hearing that the standard edition trim of Harry Potter will

[19:56] in fact have stuff removed from the game.

[20:00] It is going to be a simpler, more stripped down version of the game.

[20:05] And it is meant for operators.

[20:07] So the previous rumor was that all three trims are going to have everything in it.

[20:11] Nope, it's going to be more like a guns and roses S.E.

[20:16] And they want to sell as many of these as they can.

[20:19] I would assume the price is going to be $10,000 for the stripped down version

[20:25] of Harry Potter. All right.

[20:26] So we got one final big rumor that I'm hearing that no one else has said,

[20:30] and it's going to make for a very interesting launch of Harry Potter.

[20:35] It's also going to make it impossible for Canadian to scalp a Harry Potter

[20:40] and make $20,000.

[20:42] So after 10 years and all this money, you know how I've been saying recently

[20:47] that Jersey Jack has sort of boxed themselves in that you'd only want to

[20:51] order the C.E. now, right?

[20:53] With the L.E. being $12,000, why wouldn't you just order C.E.?

[20:57] I think they sold more C.E.s of avatar than they did of L.E. machine.

[21:03] So now you've got all these years where games haven't sold very well.

[21:07] Godfather was a flop.

[21:09] Elton John didn't sell tremendously well.

[21:12] You haven't sold many avatars.

[21:14] And now you got Harry Potter.

[21:15] And you know the demand for Harry Potter is going to be through the roof.

[21:19] So what do you do?

[21:20] What do you do?

[21:20] Do you stay true to the collectors?

[21:23] Do you increase the price because of the popularity of the theme?

[21:28] Do you increase the number of collectors?

[21:30] Additions you're going to make right now, it would be a thousand.

[21:33] What do you do?

[21:35] And it's a hundred percent a marketing decision.

[21:38] So the rumor that I'm hearing and we'll see if this comes true.

[21:41] The rumor that I am hearing is the following.

[21:45] Nobody is going to have a hard time getting a collector's addition of Harry

[21:50] Potter. What Jersey Jack is considering is instead of putting a number on the

[21:56] amount of CEs they will make, they are going to open up sales of the C.E.

[22:02] model during a window of time.

[22:05] And they will make as many CEs as people order during that window of time.

[22:13] So let's talk about that for a minute, what we think that will do to the initial

[22:18] demand of this game.

[22:19] Look, I think they're doing this because they know what they've got.

[22:23] I think they know they would sell a lot more than a thousand CEs of the game.

[22:28] This move is very beneficial to them.

[22:32] It will absolutely destroy, though, the machine being a collectible.

[22:37] And you call it a collector's addition.

[22:39] And that's an issue I have because if you do this and they are going to do this,

[22:43] I think you're going to sell thousands of CEs, like maybe three or four thousand

[22:48] of them at fifteen thousand dollars a pop.

[22:50] And you'll end up making so many of them that they will then become very,

[22:56] very easy to get for less money than fifteen thousand.

[23:00] You're ostensibly going to oversaturate the market and you won't care.

[23:03] And they shouldn't care, right?

[23:04] They're going to make as much money as they can when they do this.

[23:08] And that's what a company should be doing.

[23:11] But it's definitely a different direction for JJP.

[23:15] Remember when Spooky was like, we're going to make as many bloodsucker

[23:18] additions as people order or collectors additions.

[23:21] And I think Spooky now is just eight hundred and eighty eight of just one model.

[23:25] I'm very curious to see what happens when Jersey Jack does this.

[23:29] If they do do it.

[23:30] I'm curious to see what happens to distros now, if that's the case, because I

[23:34] was thinking about this wall.

[23:36] If you're going to say you're going to make an unlimited amount and there's

[23:39] going to be demand through the roof.

[23:41] Man, it's like, imagine if you were a distro.

[23:43] How many do you order now?

[23:46] How many orders do you put in knowing that this game might have

[23:50] demand for the next five years as new people get into pinball?

[23:55] Of course they're going to want to Harry Potter, C.E.C.

[23:57] My worry is this.

[23:59] If Jersey Jack opens it up like this, I guess the question I have is, are they

[24:05] even going to number the game?

[24:07] They did this with dialed in when dialed in collectors addition.

[24:12] When it was announced, Jack said, we're going to take as many orders as we get

[24:17] up until midnight, New Year's Eve.

[24:20] Remember that people?

[24:21] And you know what he did at New Year's Eve midnight?

[24:23] We're going to make 150 collectors additions.

[24:26] Like it was such an exact number that the whole thing just seemed a little bogus.

[24:30] So I'm wondering if they're going to do that here.

[24:33] The problem is, imagine if he says, we're going to make four thousand

[24:37] collectors additions of Harry Potter at fifteen thousand dollars a pop.

[24:40] You know what I'm saying?

[24:41] Like if they do number them and the number is so large, what have you really done?

[24:47] It's not a collector's addition anymore.

[24:49] It's just the nicest trim of the game.

[24:52] And then maybe don't even bother with a C.E.

[24:55] and an Ellie version of the game.

[24:57] So I think this is a very interesting marketing move.

[25:00] It does kill FOMO.

[25:02] I mean, would you have FOMO knowing like, all right, cool, like let the distros

[25:06] order tons of them and I'll just sit and wait it out.

[25:10] And by the time, you know, they start making all these things,

[25:14] if they're making a few thousand, I'm not going to have to spend 15,000 on one new

[25:19] inbox. There's going to be so many out there like guns and roses.

[25:22] So that's what I'm hearing.

[25:25] We will see what happens.

[25:27] The other thing is this game.

[25:28] There is an issue I heard with the artwork and licensing.

[25:32] And we're now not going to get this game maybe to the end of spring.

[25:36] So this game might not come out for three months.

[25:38] I think King Kong is going to come out Predator, the new barrels game.

[25:42] We haven't talked about what the barrels game is.

[25:44] I keep hearing it's Dune, a lot of disappointment.

[25:46] Man, my barrels friends do something guys.

[25:50] Like what are you doing?

[25:51] Like I don't understand what's happening.

[25:53] You know, they're not even doing teasers.

[25:55] I just feel like they might be trapped.

[25:58] If it is Dune, there's no excitement I'm seeing for that license.

[26:03] So if it is Dune, guys, you got to start just rip the bandaid off.

[26:08] Tell us it's going to be Dune, but you're going to love it.

[26:11] And here's why.

[26:11] And here's the date we're going to reveal.

[26:13] They're doing nothing.

[26:14] And I don't know, you know, Jack's now trying to freeze all of our money

[26:18] for an unlimited run of Harry Potter CEs.

[26:21] It's all about to get weird.

[26:23] I just wish they would have made a thousand CEs and just make those thousand

[26:28] games unobtainable, right?

[26:31] The collectors would have been happy.

[26:32] But as we all know, pinball collecting is over.

[26:36] Like it's kind of over the concept of like, I need to get this version of the game

[26:42] now, and if I grab it, I'm special.

[26:45] People are going to want it.

[26:46] The demand's always, it's over.

[26:48] It's all over.

[26:49] All these companies over the last three to four years have absolutely destroyed

[26:54] pinball collecting, which maybe isn't a bad thing.

[26:58] We're all grown men.

[26:59] And none of these L.E.s make your wanker a little bit bigger.

[27:01] Nothing, right? There's nothing.

[27:03] You're not special.

[27:04] You're not having more fun with this higher end version.

[27:07] But we know they need to sell those higher end versions to convince the distros

[27:13] to take the other versions of the game.

[27:15] That was always the reason why they existed.

[27:19] If you want this many CEs, you got to take this many L.E.s and pros.

[27:23] Or if you want this many L.E.s, you got to take this many premiums and pros.

[27:27] And that is how the model worked.

[27:30] So when you now blow that model up, it's going to be crazy Wild West.

[27:35] Everybody, thank you for subscribing to Canada's pinball podcast.

[27:38] A lot of stuff is going to happen over the next two months.

[27:41] And I can't wait to cover it.

[27:43] Canada out.
