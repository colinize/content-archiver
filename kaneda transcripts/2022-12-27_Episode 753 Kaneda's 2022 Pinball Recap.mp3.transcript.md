[00:00] It's the most wonderful time of the year.

[00:07] Oh Merry Christmas everybody, I hope you're all having a great holiday season, it's been

[00:17] a terrific time here in New York City, Killian is just having the greatest Christmas ever,

[00:22] you know my dad said it, he said Christmas is for kids and I remind it my father, I'm

[00:27] still a grown child, dad where is my Christmas gift, okay everybody here's what we're gonna

[00:32] do on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, I wanna go around the horn and talk about

[00:36] what kind of year I think each manufacturer had, what kind of 2022 was it for Stern and

[00:43] Jersey Jack and Pinball Brothers and American Pinball and Chicago Gaming Company and I'm

[00:48] just gonna talk about what kind of year I think each of these companies had and I think

[00:51] if we were to zoom out and just think about the industry in general, we all can agree

[00:56] 2022 was one of the most underwhelming years in pinball history, since I've been covering

[01:02] this hobby I don't think I've seen a year where each and every one of us is struggling

[01:07] to get enthusiastic about what's the game of the year, what was the most exciting magical

[01:12] game that came out in 2022, you'd get a lot of people shrugging their shoulders and I

[01:17] do think the industry is still suffering from like COVID supply chain shortages and

[01:23] obviously making pinball machines in 2022 is harder than it's ever been before but we've

[01:30] still seen companies produce, we've still seen new games and I'll tell you this, supply

[01:36] chain shortages due to COVID has nothing to do with the lack of creativity and I think

[01:43] that is the number one thing when we think about 2022, it was just the lack of creativity

[01:50] in certain titles that people were expecting big things from so we're gonna talk about

[01:55] it.

[01:56] Okay, let's start with stern pinball, so what kind of year did stern pinball have?

[02:00] Well look, stern pinball when you think about it from a manufacturing standpoint, they had

[02:04] another great year.

[02:06] This company is backlogged with orders, so many orders that they need almost a year

[02:12] to catch up on all of the orders they have and these aren't just like a few hundred orders,

[02:18] these are a few thousand orders they're backlogged, so stern pinball's year was defined by that,

[02:25] like we got rushed pinball at the beginning of 2022 and then we waited a really really

[02:30] really really long time to get arguably the sloppiest launch in the history of stern pinball

[02:36] which is James Bond, but stern pinball was making pinball machines throughout that period

[02:42] of time and so they were filling the backlog orders for Godzilla's, for Mandalorians, for

[02:48] all the people that ordered machines in 2021 who are still waiting and some of you are still

[02:53] waiting for Elvira, you're gonna have to pay more, right?

[02:57] Did you see Elvira now is two thousand dollars more for the same game.

[03:01] We're gonna talk about on this episode how the price increase is really the story of

[03:06] 2022, I think that's the main two stories of 2022 is the lack of creativity and then the

[03:12] most expensive pinball's ever been and that is not a good combination people.

[03:17] Oh look, I'm four higher prices, but if you're gonna charge me more, then put more into the

[03:22] game, but 2022 was defined by games like TNA costing two to three thousand more than it

[03:28] used to cost.

[03:30] Elvira is now gonna be two thousand more than it used to be.

[03:33] Jersey Jack Pinball decided to make their games two to three thousand dollars more money

[03:37] as well, so did stern pinball and so the lack of creativity and the increase in price is

[03:42] really the defining factor of the year.

[03:44] Okay, but we're not just talking about price, we're talking about the manufacturers, so

[03:47] stern pinball.

[03:48] I think all things considered, stern pinball is still moving along at stern's pace.

[03:53] I don't think anything can really dent them.

[03:56] I don't.

[03:57] I don't.

[03:58] I don't think they're gonna sell all one thousand James Bond LEs at thirteen thousand

[04:02] dollars.

[04:03] Gary Stern stepped down this year.

[04:05] Is that gonna change the company at all?

[04:07] I don't think so.

[04:08] I don't think Gary's really been calling the shots for a long time now.

[04:11] I think he's just been sitting back and watching the big checks roll in and he's laughing all

[04:17] the way to the bank and he deserves to.

[04:19] Like Gary Stern deserves to retire with like fifty to eighty million dollars probably in

[04:25] net worth and the man deserves it.

[04:27] I could be way off on that number.

[04:29] I have nothing to base it on, but that's what I would think for a company like Stern Pinball.

[04:33] But George Gomez has been running this ship for a long time now and he's been doing a

[04:38] great job at the helm.

[04:40] Now look, the botched launch of James Bond, I think it's not just Stern's fault, I think

[04:45] the license holder must have like tied their hands behind their back and it still continues

[04:51] to be pretty sloppy when you think about the fact that they announced the Keith Elwin pin

[04:56] in September and here we are end of December and we still don't even know what it looks

[05:01] like, how much it cost.

[05:02] But Stern is about to move into a much bigger factory, which is going to be interesting,

[05:07] right?

[05:08] Because we know right now in their current factory this company is pumping out like

[05:12] four to five hundred games a week.

[05:14] Some people have said it's closer to six hundred when all engines are firing.

[05:19] So six hundred machines a week.

[05:20] Let's just say it's like five hundred.

[05:22] They can make a thousand L.E.s in two freaking weeks, two weeks they can actually fulfill

[05:29] a thousand L.E. orders.

[05:31] Now I think what's going to be crazy about Stern's efficiency now and more than ever

[05:35] what's changed about Pinball is you now at these prices you need to be damn sure you

[05:40] want the game because they're going to make the game pretty quickly and then you're going

[05:44] to have to hand over your money and we all know the other big thing that's changed about

[05:47] Pinball in twenty twenty two is scalping and flipping machines is pretty much dead.

[05:52] Like FOMO is dying quickly in this hobby and it's dying quickly.

[05:56] You know why?

[05:57] Two things.

[05:58] Lack of creativity, lack of great themes and also higher prices.

[06:03] Maybe that's the third thing, right?

[06:04] We're not really getting the themes that are like take my money now kind of themes.

[06:09] Okay, but it's not all bad.

[06:11] It's not all bad.

[06:12] Like at least we have so many more options in Pinball than we've ever had before.

[06:17] Have you ever stopped to think about that for a minute, right?

[06:20] It's not just Valley Williams and Gottlieb and Data East and Sega.

[06:24] It is now like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

[06:28] I think we have over twelve companies right now that are currently manufacturing and putting

[06:34] Pinball machines in boxes for you to make up your mind on and that's a great thing.

[06:39] Okay, so good year for Stern Pinball.

[06:41] What kind of year was it for Spooky Pinball?

[06:43] Okay, so Spooky Pinball had a little bit of a mixed bag year.

[06:47] I would say that 90% of 2022 was a little bit of a nightmarish year for Spooky Pinball

[06:54] and here's what I mean by that.

[06:55] I think all of the goodwill this company built up over the years, it was really in jeopardy

[07:01] when we saw Halloween in Ultraman.

[07:03] You know, when we saw how much money people were losing on these games and how incomplete

[07:08] the code was on these games throughout most of the year.

[07:11] Now that the Halloween code is better, that game is starting to stabilize in terms of

[07:16] pricing and enthusiasm in the hobby.

[07:19] I would argue that both of those games, because they're the same design, don't have a lot

[07:24] of creativity in them.

[07:25] They just don't.

[07:27] Remove the artwork from both of those games.

[07:29] They're not that creative.

[07:32] Spooky got what they paid for in the coding department and in the animations department.

[07:37] Ultraman absolutely torpedoed in value.

[07:40] And we're not just talking like a few hundred bucks, we're talking like you might have lost

[07:43] three to four to five thousand dollars and if you had waited and not pre-ordered the

[07:49] game, you could get the same exact game for four thousand dollars off.

[07:53] So they had a really rough majority of 2022, but we all know how this story ends.

[08:01] Spooky Pinball unveils Scooby-Doo to really strong response, to a really strong fanfare.

[08:08] Scooby-Doo looks to be a much better shooting pin.

[08:11] It looks to have much more value in it.

[08:14] And it's based on a theme people really want.

[08:17] And it looks pretty beautiful looking at this game.

[08:19] I must say it looks really nice.

[08:21] And so I think Spooky Pinball has had a really terrific end of 2022.

[08:27] The big question mark is going to be when we finally see more of the game in January,

[08:32] are they going to feel as excited when they see the gameplay and the coding of the machine?

[08:37] Will their excitement remain once they see Jack Danger flip this machine in early 2023?

[08:43] He's going to play the game sometime in January.

[08:45] But a very good year for Spooky.

[08:47] You can't deny the fact.

[08:48] They sold more games in one day than they ever have before and they're going to make

[08:52] nineteen hundred and sixty nine Scooby-Doo's and based on theme alone, I think they're

[08:57] going to sell every single game eventually.

[09:00] And I also think you should wait and see because if you wait and see, trust me, you'll be able

[09:05] to get one for cheaper than MSRP.

[09:08] There's just too many games coming out people.

[09:10] All right.

[09:11] What kind of year did Jersey Jack Pinball have?

[09:13] I almost feel like just skipping this one.

[09:15] No, I'm not going to skip this one.

[09:17] I know they think I have an agenda.

[09:20] I don't have an agenda.

[09:21] I only own one pinball machine on planet Earth.

[09:26] It is a Jersey Jack Pinball machine.

[09:29] I don't have anything personal against this company.

[09:33] But Toy Story 4, I'm going to just go over it quickly, is the game I'm really talking

[09:38] about when I talk about lack of creativity.

[09:42] You look at this game.

[09:43] Pat Lawler was working on this game for two to three years.

[09:47] It looks like he mailed it in.

[09:49] There aren't any original ideas whatsoever in this game.

[09:54] It is basically no good gopher's light.

[09:57] We also didn't want Toy Story 4.

[10:00] We want it one through three.

[10:02] We wanted the movies we fell in love with.

[10:04] And that's the year Jersey Jack has had.

[10:07] They had a golden opportunity to bring out a magical toy-filled game that was going

[10:13] to blow everybody away.

[10:15] Instead, they released an underwhelming game that is fun to shoot.

[10:19] The layout is really nice.

[10:21] It is a fun game to flip, but it's a $12,000 to $15,000 toy that's based on a movie about

[10:28] toys coming to life in which the Jersey Jack version of the toy has no toys that come

[10:35] to life.

[10:36] That is where the story begins and ends on this title.

[10:40] It is going to go down as a great shooting game, but it will continue to lose value every

[10:47] single month.

[10:48] And it is going to go down as a miss for Jersey Jack pinball.

[10:52] And I think we're going to see at the Twippies.

[10:55] It's not just Canada who feels this way.

[10:57] I think you're going to see this game losing almost every single category, except maybe

[11:02] artwork.

[11:03] And that is not a win for Pat Lawler's final game in the pinball space.

[11:09] So really bad year for Jersey Jack pinball.

[11:12] Distros are sitting on these games and nothing Panzer Freak says is going to change people's

[11:17] minds.

[11:18] All right, let's go on to Chicago Game Company.

[11:20] Talk about back-to-back companies, which I should just skip when it comes to what kind

[11:24] of year have they had.

[11:26] Another horrible year for Chicago Gaming Company.

[11:29] I would argue that Chicago Gaming Company takes the prize for worst year by any manufacturer

[11:36] because they didn't do anything.

[11:38] They still are making people wait for Cactus Canyon LEDs.

[11:41] I think they are finally trickling out.

[11:45] And I mean trickling out.

[11:47] I don't think their full-scale production has begun.

[11:50] So it was like another dead year for CGC.

[11:54] We still don't have the Lyman sheets code.

[11:57] We have no idea how much that's going to cost.

[11:59] And their communication, and I mean it when I say this, there is no excuse for the lack

[12:05] of communication from this company.

[12:08] They took people's money over a year ago and they don't have the professionalism to just

[12:15] give people like quarterly updates.

[12:17] I'm not even asking for a weekly or bi-weekly update.

[12:22] Every quarter tell people where things are at.

[12:25] What is the truth and what is the status of their build and they don't even do that.

[12:30] I don't like CGC anymore.

[12:33] Alright, let's move on to American Pinball.

[12:35] What kind of 2022 did American Pinball have?

[12:37] So AP was another company that failed to get out the game they were supposed to get out

[12:42] in 2022.

[12:43] And I think it comes down to like part supplies and delays.

[12:48] Because the game everybody is really waiting for is the Dennis Nordman game.

[12:52] It was supposed to come out sometime around expo and then they delayed it to December

[12:58] and then they delayed it until sometime in 2023.

[13:01] So I don't think we're going to see their new game until sometime around TPF.

[13:06] And I think AP is another company that had a really dead year.

[13:11] Like not a lot went on over at AP.

[13:14] If I had to guess, I would say in total, American Pinball didn't even make more than 300 games

[13:20] in one year.

[13:22] I might be wrong on that.

[13:24] David Fix, if you're listening, let me know what the number was.

[13:27] But we really didn't see all of the Legends of the Hollas go out.

[13:30] Like they didn't make 500 Legends of the Hollas.

[13:33] And it's weird because now you can order a brand new Oktoberfest, which means they have

[13:38] leftover parts for that game.

[13:40] But look, everyone, we're looking towards the future of American Pinball, not the past.

[13:46] We don't need more Oktoberfest.

[13:48] We want to see what the future of AP holds.

[13:51] And that is the Dennis Nordman game with Christopher Franchi on artwork.

[13:55] Alright, what kind of year was it for P3 Multimorphic?

[13:58] Or Multimorphic P3?

[13:59] I always get it wrong.

[14:01] I will never get it right.

[14:02] Jerry, just call it something else, please.

[14:04] Alright, what kind of year was it for P3?

[14:07] Well look, weird out.

[14:08] Another game.

[14:09] People want it.

[14:10] People ordered it.

[14:11] Most people aren't getting it.

[14:12] And it's just been another year in which people are being told, if you order a game today,

[14:18] your wait time is one year.

[14:20] Now the thing about P3 is this.

[14:23] The next title is everything.

[14:25] Are they going to continue to get licensed theme games and put them on this platform

[14:32] in a way that's enticing enough to get people to spend $13,000 on one of these things?

[14:40] And I don't think we know yet what the answer is to that.

[14:44] These homebrew games that they're putting onto the platform, that's not going to work.

[14:48] That's not going to sell you any more units.

[14:51] In fact, if I owned a P3 Multimorphic and I saw one of those new games, I'm not going

[14:55] to shell out $3,500 for these very simple homebrew games.

[15:02] No, no, no, no, no.

[15:04] We need to see more licensed stuff if this platform is really going to take off.

[15:08] I wish I knew what the total number of Multimorphic units that have sold, but again, nobody wants

[15:15] to talk about it.

[15:16] And look, when it comes to these small boutiques, I think promoting how many you make is actually

[15:22] a good thing because you want to know how many Multimorphic P3 owners are out there because

[15:27] the more out there, the better.

[15:29] Because the more out there, then you want to get one and go online and play with other

[15:33] people.

[15:34] But I have no idea.

[15:35] Have they sold $500?

[15:37] Have they sold $700?

[15:38] Has it been like 300?

[15:40] Nobody knows.

[15:41] And asking for those numbers isn't me being a jerk.

[15:44] I would just like to know, like, how many have you made after like eight years of making

[15:48] this thing?

[15:49] Ah, alright.

[15:50] Okay, let's go on to our next stop on this Canada's holiday tour of 2022 and we're going

[15:57] to land at the Pinball Brothers.

[15:59] What kind of year have the Pinball Brothers had?

[16:02] Well, look, they've got their Alien games going out to customers.

[16:06] I haven't seen too many issues with the Alien rebuilds.

[16:09] They're still a little quirky.

[16:11] You kind of have to know when you buy a product from these smaller boutiques, you're going

[16:15] to be lifting the hood a lot more than you would on a stern.

[16:19] But for the most part, I generally hear positive things about the Alien machine.

[16:25] From owners, I always hear very positive things about the visceral atmospheric experience

[16:32] that is Alien Pinball.

[16:34] I've never played one that wasn't broken because I played the Andrew Highway games

[16:38] at shows.

[16:39] If you have an Alien and you're in the tri-state area, I would love to come by and play it

[16:44] one day and see what all the fuss is about.

[16:46] Now, what kind of year is it though for the Pinball Brothers?

[16:49] So I think the Pinball Brothers, and I'm just going to say it, I think their 2022 was also

[16:54] defined a lot by their failure to get Queen Pinball out.

[16:58] And now that they did get Queen Pinball out and go on to Pinside and read about the unboxing

[17:04] of the machine by a few of the owners.

[17:06] And there are some real bad quality issues going on with the game.

[17:10] I think it's one owner's had a lot of issues.

[17:12] I'm not going to say a lot of them have issues, but it's also concerning, right?

[17:17] Because these are assembly line built products.

[17:20] And you shouldn't have one person's game have a ton of issues, and then the next game

[17:25] be perfect.

[17:26] You kind of want every game to be perfect for this much money.

[17:29] And so we will see whether or not these quality issues pop up on any future Queen machines.

[17:36] We've also seen some video footage of the game, and it is very underwhelming.

[17:41] And I'm going to tell you this, it's their fault that the first video footage of Queen

[17:45] Pinball that we get is this underwhelming footage, because as a company, they should

[17:51] have created a five to 10 minute video showing us all the cool features of the game.

[17:58] Now you've got a homeowner whose pop bumper doesn't work, who's got issues with the game.

[18:04] He's putting the first piece of Queen video out into the world.

[18:08] And guess what that's going to do?

[18:10] It's going to turn off people to the product.

[18:13] And I still to this day do not understand why pinball marketing is so pathetically bad

[18:19] pretty much across the board in the pinball world.

[18:22] This doesn't work anymore.

[18:24] As the FOMO starts to evaporate, you can't just announce Queen Pinball from the pinball

[18:29] brothers and people are not just going to throw money at you.

[18:33] They're going to want to see what they're going to get for over 10 grand.

[18:37] And if what they're seeing is this crappy video, you're not going to get many sales.

[18:40] I mean, you're not even going to sell a few hundred of these things if people start to

[18:44] turn south on this game right away.

[18:46] Because there's just too many games coming out.

[18:48] They're all so expensive now.

[18:51] And that's the new climate of pinball.

[18:53] Because I need to make sure this thing is great before I commit my hard earned money

[18:58] to the hobby we love.

[19:00] Alright so what kind of year was it for Dutch pinball?

[19:02] Well it was a good year until like a few hours ago.

[19:05] I mean I think Dutch has been getting it done.

[19:08] They've been cranking out games.

[19:10] But just a few hours ago people are uploading pictures of their Mirko playfields that are

[19:15] starting to pool and starting to chip.

[19:17] And all of a sudden the nightmare that is Mirko playfields could be rearing its ugly

[19:22] head again.

[19:23] Now Mirko's been making the playfields for all of the Lebowski's and we haven't seen

[19:28] this problem.

[19:30] So this does feel like a bad batch.

[19:33] But how many bad batches is Mirko going to get before we get this guy out of the industry?

[19:39] I mean it when I say it.

[19:41] I have to go buy a replacement Guns N' Roses playfield because of him.

[19:45] Like he's going to cost me 500 bucks because of his bad work.

[19:50] Now I don't want to have to spend that money.

[19:52] That money should come out of his pocket not mine.

[19:54] I really hope this doesn't become more widespread because I really want to see Dutch Pinball

[19:59] get to their next title.

[20:01] And look let's face it they can afford to have to give out free playfields to people.

[20:07] So if they find those issues I think you're going to see something very much like Jersey

[20:11] Jack.

[20:12] They'll give you the opportunity to buy one at cost which is probably around $500.

[20:17] Alright let's keep going.

[20:18] Who am I missing here?

[20:19] What kind of year has it been for our good old friends at Haggis Pinball?

[20:24] The most efficient pinball company on planet earth.

[20:27] I'm just going to say this right now.

[20:28] I just hope these guys get the games built.

[20:31] I hope they get them to customers.

[20:33] And that's all I'm going to say on Haggis Pinball.

[20:35] I'm going to give them a holiday treat and not be mean because I heard some accusations

[20:39] on another podcast like slamming me as if I am on a mission to take down this company.

[20:44] Okay this is me.

[20:45] Right.

[20:46] I'm going to be here to talk about the games I love to do.

[20:47] Games would be out in June or July of 2021.

[20:51] I'm the one who took your money and promised you a game in 8 weeks and then made you wait

[20:54] 8 months.

[20:55] That was me.

[20:56] That was canada.

[20:57] The big bad toxic podcaster in New York is single handedly responsible for some company's

[21:02] poor decision making.

[21:03] Okay look I said I wasn't going to go there.

[21:05] Let's move on.

[21:06] It's been a bad year for Haggis.

[21:07] Hopefully they can get this ship turned around and get more games made because they got a

[21:12] lot of these games to make people.

[21:15] 250 mermaid editions they also took a few hundred orders for standard editions of fathom as well

[21:20] Not a good year for haggis pinball, but I would still argue I would still put cgc below haggis

[21:26] I know those two companies really battle it out for the worst communicators and the worst when it comes to

[21:32] Efficiencies in manufacturing this year, so I think that's kind of it

[21:35] I don't think anyone else made a dent in pinball. I'm looking at my list my old list and I've got like pinball adventures

[21:41] I don't think they have a game out really yet. We have team pinball. They're gone circus Maximus

[21:46] Where the heck are those guys with their kingpin remake? That's gone. That's dead on arrival

[21:52] Skit B Zidware and deep root like this was this was from like March of

[21:57] 2021 I listed all the pinball manufacturers and not all of them have survived. Okay, so here's my final thoughts on

[22:05] 2022 it wasn't the best year in pinball from a new in box standpoint

[22:10] But I'm gonna tell you this right now if you own a pinball machine or many pinball machines and every day

[22:16] You get to wake up and enjoy your machines

[22:19] You had a great 2022 with pinball because this is what pinball is all about you get a few games

[22:25] You love you wake up you take care of yourself and your family and your

[22:31] responsibilities and then you get to have some leisure time and enjoy pinball that is what it's all about

[22:37] I love covering the new in box world of pinball. I love covering what's going on in the industry

[22:43] It was just a really bad year and I'm gonna call it a really bad year

[22:48] 2022 was the least creative year since I've been covering pinball the game

[22:53] Creativities just not there toy story was supposed to be the mainstream hit and it just missed and so that's okay though

[23:00] Right, it's not the end of the world. These companies are designing pinball machines for the next five years at least

[23:06] So there is a lot of pinball coming and I kind of like the fact that we had an off year

[23:12] I'll tell you why because we had an off year and the prices went through the roof. What's really good about that?

[23:18] It's made each of us wiser each and every one of us. We are so much smarter now with our pinball money

[23:25] I mean it. We are all gonna start to hesitate more. We're gonna wait and see

[23:30] We're gonna make sure we play these games before we commit all these dollars and I mean it when I say it

[23:36] This is not the narrative you're gonna hear on other shows or from the manufacturers

[23:41] Because they want you to have FOMO

[23:43] They want you to throw your money at stuff before seeing it

[23:47] But I love the fact that this year made us all wait and pause and now we're all gonna make sure if a game comes out

[23:54] And it's super creative

[23:56] Absolutely, it could get $15,000 in a heartbeat, but if it comes out and there's no creativity in it

[24:02] There's no way you're gonna get 12 or 15 grand for it

[24:05] And then it's gonna tank on the secondhand market right away

[24:08] Which is good because all the wise people who wait it are gonna reap the rewards of not rushing in with the FOMO

[24:16] And that's the major theme the significant decline in pinball FOMO is

[24:22] Probably a really good thing for each and every one of us everybody. Thank you so much for your

[24:29] Subscriptions and being a member of the canada club. I hope you and your families had a terrific holiday season

[24:35] Obviously, I'm not going anywhere. I think Twippy voting opens up next week. Get ready

[24:40] I mean there is like zero hype for these Twippies. Nobody's talking about it

[24:45] They're not even talking about it. Nobody's even sure like what happens like Jan one or Jan two

[24:50] But get ready all we need is your vote and someone else in your family's vote and we easily win it

[24:57] But let's not stop there. Let's send a message that canada's pinball podcast behind the paywall

[25:03] It's fun to see all the other shows now are breaking off again

[25:06] They're coming back again, and they're turning on patreon, but they still can never do what we've done here

[25:12] They're never gonna get over 500 subscribers. They're never gonna get that Twippy on the shelf

[25:17] We know we can do it, but I need your help. Okay, everybody. Happy holidays. I'll talk to you soon
