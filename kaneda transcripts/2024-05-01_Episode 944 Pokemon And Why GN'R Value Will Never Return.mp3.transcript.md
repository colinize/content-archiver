[00:00] Before we start this show, I want you to do me a favor.

[00:02] Close your eyes.

[00:04] Imagine the pinball buying demographic.

[00:06] 40 to 60 year old men.

[00:08] Imagine them turning this game on, hearing this song.

[00:13] Do you think they're gonna be like super excited?

[00:16] Just picture them right now,

[00:17] Iceman down there in Texas.

[00:19] Neil McCrae putting his hands up in the air

[00:21] over there in the UK.

[00:23] Genghis in Denmark after leaving the gym.

[00:25] This is the song he's humming.

[00:27] Everyone saying if they make this game,

[00:29] it's gonna sell like hotcakes.

[00:31] Ladies and gentlemen, when are we gonna wake up

[00:33] and realize that there's a difference between valuable IP

[00:37] and IP that speaks to the pinball buying demographic.

[00:40] Picture them getting down to this song.

[00:42] Oh yeah.

[00:45] Hit me.

[00:49] I wanna be the very best.

[00:52] Very best.

[00:52] No one ever was.

[00:54] No one ever was.

[00:56] To catch them is my real test.

[00:59] Oh, to train what?

[01:04] Across the land.

[01:06] Far and wide.

[01:11] Hell yeah.

[01:13] Neil McCrae taking away.

[01:17] Iceman.

[01:20] Yeah.

[01:23] My best friend.

[01:28] Cedar, cedar, cedar, cedar, cedar, cedar, cedar.

[01:32] Welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:34] The baby has not arrived yet,

[01:36] so I have time to do a pinball show for each and every one of you.

[01:39] Pokemon, the rumor is back at his front page news on Jason Napp's page

[01:44] because Stern Pinball asked people yesterday,

[01:47] like, any questions out there and someone said,

[01:49] are you gonna make Pokemon?

[01:51] And Stern responded, stay tuned with like four Ds or three Ds.

[01:56] And look, people, we all know that Pokemon has been a long running rumored game.

[02:01] It's supposed to be maybe the next game that Jack Danger makes.

[02:05] We all know that Pokemon is one of the biggest franchises in the world,

[02:09] if not one of the biggest,

[02:10] or I think it is the biggest franchise in the world.

[02:13] And does that mean that each and every one of you is all of a sudden

[02:18] gonna become a Pokemon fan because of that?

[02:21] The way each and every one of you who never watched Rick and Morty

[02:24] had to become a Rick and Morty fan to get into the pinball experience,

[02:28] I'm not gonna debate whether or not Pokemon is a huge property.

[02:32] I'm not gonna debate whether or not it would make a good theme for pinball,

[02:36] but I maybe might debate that last point.

[02:38] Is it a great theme for pinball in the pinball world?

[02:42] It will absolutely crush on location.

[02:45] If they make this game, I think it'll crush on location

[02:49] because when you go out to barcades and you go to location play,

[02:53] there are a lot of people that grew up with Pokemon.

[02:57] The problem is that most of those people are not in the market

[03:01] for a 7 to 13 thousand dollar pinball machine, so will you want one?

[03:07] And you just have to ask yourself this,

[03:09] in a world in which we're buying stuff like ACDC,

[03:12] Guns N' Roses, stuff like Spider-Man, Star Wars, Batman,

[03:17] does Pokemon cross over into your world?

[03:21] I think it's targeting a demographic that's one stage earlier

[03:25] than most of who buys current day pinball machines,

[03:28] but here's the thing, this is just a rumor,

[03:31] and also take it with a grain of salt

[03:33] because Stern Pinball doesn't ever really confirm a game

[03:37] they're gonna make with a cheeky Facebook post like this,

[03:41] and we also know there are two more Stern machines

[03:44] that are gonna come out before we might even see Pokemon.

[03:48] The earliest would be December of 2024,

[03:52] we have John Wick coming out any day now,

[03:55] then we're gonna have John Borg's Metallica,

[03:58] all new designs Metallica on Spike 3,

[04:01] that's gonna take up a good eight months right there.

[04:06] So if you wanna get excited by Pokemon,

[04:09] maybe coming out at the end of the year,

[04:12] that's on you, but I think we've got a lot more happening

[04:15] in the here and the now than to get excited about Pokemon,

[04:19] and truth be told people, how many of you are like,

[04:23] Pokemon is a dream theme, and the game is gonna come out

[04:27] right when Back to the Future comes out,

[04:29] so that's gonna be a battle, 1980s nostalgia versus like what,

[04:34] like mid 90s nostalgia in Pokemon, it's gonna be a battle.

[04:39] Obviously Pokemon is a much bigger IP,

[04:42] but I think Back to the Future has more of you excited

[04:45] than Pokemon, alright, so we're waiting on John Wick,

[04:48] Canada's waiting on his baby, David Fix sent out an email

[04:52] to all of his dealers asking them, hey guys,

[04:55] do you know any barbecue restaurants

[04:57] that you could set us up with, and we would love to house

[05:00] one of these barbecue challenge games

[05:02] in one of those barbecue restaurants, do you know this fool,

[05:06] and I'm just gonna call him a fool

[05:07] because he doesn't know what he's doing,

[05:10] he was also trying to get ice cream parlors

[05:13] to put Galactic Tank Force games into their establishments,

[05:18] this is how bad it's gotten, this is how like,

[05:22] a name and ridiculous David Fix and the team

[05:25] over at American Pinball is, they have no idea

[05:28] what they're doing, it doesn't work like this,

[05:31] if Deadpool eats like chimichangas or whatever they're called,

[05:35] you're not gonna put Deadpool Pinball machines

[05:37] in chimichanga restaurants, you know, a taco truck's not

[05:40] gonna set up a Deadpool outside it

[05:42] because they feature it inside the game,

[05:44] it's really, really sad watching this company

[05:47] make every bone-headed move, but also I'm kinda happy

[05:50] because think how boring it would be

[05:52] if we didn't have people like David Fix and Pinball,

[05:55] if we didn't have people like Damien Harden and Pinball,

[05:58] it would be really boring if all we had were like

[06:01] three companies that execute really well and that's it,

[06:05] and we had to wait in between each game,

[06:07] think about how boring it would be to follow Pinball content

[06:11] and all the companies that are out there

[06:13] because I think what makes this hobby fun

[06:15] is you don't have a really great game

[06:17] if you don't have really bad games to compare it to, right?

[06:21] We know a movie is amazing, not just because it's amazing

[06:24] on its own, because we also know what horrible movies are like,

[06:27] and the same is true for Pinball,

[06:29] there's just so many really terrible decisions

[06:32] that happen on an annual basis,

[06:34] and just when we think we're done with terrible decisions,

[06:39] a whole new bunch of them come out like making Abba,

[06:42] terrible decision, like making an $11,000 funhouse,

[06:46] terrible decision, like telling people

[06:49] you're gonna have your game in eight weeks

[06:51] and it takes eight months, terrible decisions,

[06:54] and I don't make any of these companies make these decisions,

[06:57] and we all know this, at the end of the day,

[06:59] Stern Pinball makes the best decision.

[07:01] Stern Pinball has been consistently bringing out

[07:05] the best Pinball machines over the last 20 years.

[07:08] They've consistently put the best code into Pinball machines.

[07:12] They consistently have the best designers in Pinball,

[07:15] and that's why Stern Pinball is like an easy target

[07:18] because they do do so much so well.

[07:21] Now they are ripping us off and they know that,

[07:24] but they can justify stuff like a $2,000 topper.

[07:28] We're not just paying for that Foo Fighter topper.

[07:31] I mean, I think everyone needs to realize this.

[07:33] When we see a $2,000 Foo Fighter topper,

[07:36] they know that we know that that topper is not worth $2,000.

[07:41] What you're paying for is an ornament on top of a game

[07:46] made by the company that's making the best Pinball in the world.

[07:50] That's what that is.

[07:52] It is simply an ornament on top of a game.

[07:55] It's the cherry on top of the two and a half years.

[07:58] It took them to make that game,

[08:00] and they're cashing in knowing that they gave you enough value

[08:04] for people to consider putting that ornament on top of their game.

[08:08] And the last I heard, those toppers are selling just fine,

[08:12] regardless of how much Canada thinks it's a ripoff.

[08:16] And there's a lot that is a ripoff in Pinball,

[08:18] but even as I was thinking about this week,

[08:21] how it wasn't even hard to get someone to offer,

[08:23] you know, over $25,000 for a Batman SLE.

[08:28] Why is that, right?

[08:30] There will never be an American Pinball game

[08:32] in the history of American Pinball

[08:34] where anyone would ever want to buy for $25,000.

[08:36] There will never be a spooky game in the history of spooky

[08:39] where anyone would ever offer $25,000.

[08:42] There will never be a game in the history of CGC

[08:45] where anyone will ever offer that much money,

[08:47] but there's something about Stern, right?

[08:49] They make so many consistent games

[08:52] on big themes, and they've made so many of you happy

[08:55] that a lot of you out there have become collectors

[08:58] of primarily Stern machines, right?

[09:02] And if you're a Stern collector,

[09:04] the machines you're going to want to collect

[09:06] within that set of games,

[09:08] it's not just going to be the games that are the best.

[09:10] You're also going to want the ones that are like hard to get,

[09:13] that are collection pieces, and there's not many of them.

[09:16] Really, there's not many, because they screwed over everybody

[09:18] who thought they had a collector's edition

[09:21] of like Elvira by making so many variations.

[09:24] They screwed over the Jurassic Park LE people,

[09:27] but they didn't screw over the Batman collectors yet.

[09:30] There's only 240 LEs and 80 SLEs,

[09:34] so those are holding value nicely.

[09:37] In a little bit, I'm going to go down a list of all the games

[09:39] that are for sale for $14,000 or more,

[09:42] and we're going to see, you know,

[09:44] what is trying to be traded at collector's prices right now

[09:48] in the pinball world.

[09:49] Okay, so we're waiting on John Wick.

[09:51] We've got Elton John games are going out the door.

[09:54] Here's what's happening right now.

[09:55] I'm seeing a real influx of more and more

[09:59] Elton John collectors editions.

[10:02] I really think the line is cranking these things out now

[10:06] over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:08] That Elton John Platinum that was for sale for $11,200,

[10:12] it finally sold.

[10:14] It took about three weeks to sell that game,

[10:16] but I think we're going to see a lot more Elton John's

[10:20] in the marketplace.

[10:21] Now, what does that mean?

[10:23] Does that mean we're going to see this game go down

[10:25] in value like Toy Story 4 or The Godfather?

[10:29] No, I don't.

[10:30] I don't.

[10:31] It's still the best shooting Jersey Jack game of all time,

[10:33] but it's still Elton John, and there's only like what?

[10:36] Like 12 or 16 songs in the game.

[10:38] I think it might be 16 songs.

[10:40] The thing about the songs in the game is that most of them

[10:43] are not high energy, and there's about four or five of them

[10:45] that are just throw away songs.

[10:47] Like you're never really going to want to play them

[10:49] if you want to have an exciting, fast Steve Richie Elton

[10:52] John experience.

[10:53] So I think over time people might get tired of the song

[10:57] selection in Elton John, and they might want more tracks

[11:00] in it.

[11:01] Will they add more tracks to Elton John?

[11:03] I doubt it.

[11:04] We did see the Foo Fighters add it more songs into that game

[11:09] as new code updates approach.

[11:11] So that is something that might be on the table.

[11:14] The one game that I'm shocked they haven't added any,

[11:17] any new songs or new Easter egg tracks to unlock is

[11:21] Guns N' Roses because they don't have to pay for any more

[11:24] Guns N' Roses songs.

[11:26] So I am really surprised as they're doing all these major

[11:30] code updates with G&R that a few more songs are not

[11:34] unlockable, right?

[11:35] It would be super awesome if they could go maybe get

[11:38] knocking on Heaven's door.

[11:40] Maybe that's expensive because of the Bob Dylan estate,

[11:43] but there's other G&R songs I would love to see.

[11:46] Songs like Yesterday's, you know, songs like Dead Horse.

[11:50] There's other songs on the Chinese Democracy album that

[11:53] would be fun to add into the mix, but they haven't added

[11:55] any.

[11:56] You know, and recently I saw in the Rick and Morty

[11:58] thread, it was popping up again on Pinside, and we

[12:01] haven't talked about Rick and Morty in a while, but

[12:03] people forget this when Spooky Pinball made Rick and

[12:06] Morty.

[12:07] They told everybody that they had a really great

[12:09] relationship with the show's creator.

[12:11] I think that guy was canceled for like sexual misconduct,

[12:14] but when they did have a good relationship with the guy,

[12:16] there was this sort of promise to the community that we

[12:20] were going to add future seasons of Rick and Morty

[12:23] into the game itself.

[12:25] And the way the game was coded was perfect for that

[12:28] because it was all about going on different adventures

[12:31] and filling out the adventure card.

[12:33] And so the way the ruleset worked, it would have been

[12:36] really, really easy to add future episodes into the game.

[12:41] And they never did it.

[12:43] And I think one of the reasons why they never did it is

[12:45] why do it, right?

[12:46] You've sold all 750.

[12:48] You're not going to make any more money off of doing that

[12:51] and paying for the rights to put those future episodes into

[12:54] the game.

[12:55] So it makes no financial sense.

[12:56] The other thing that Rick and Morty owners would love to

[12:58] see is a final wizard mode.

[13:00] Like there's nothing in it that's really that satisfying

[13:03] when you get to the end of the game.

[13:06] And I know this for a fact that one of Spooky Pinball's

[13:09] biggest regrets is that they said they were only going to

[13:12] make 750 Rick and Morty's and that was it.

[13:15] And if they had not said that, they would have sold another

[13:18] at least 1,000 units of Rick and Morty, especially during

[13:23] COVID when people couldn't get anything.

[13:26] They would have been taking order after order of this game.

[13:30] It's still a much better theme for Pinball than Halloween,

[13:33] than Looney Tunes, then Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

[13:36] then Rob Zombie.

[13:37] I mean, it's still to this day, the best Spooky theme

[13:40] they've had.

[13:41] I would say the second best is Scooby-Doo, but Rick and Morty

[13:44] is probably still the best theme they ever had.

[13:47] The other reason why I don't think we get updates is all the

[13:50] team that made Rick and Morty is no longer at Spooky Pinball.

[13:53] So I think they just want to move past it and think about

[13:56] future titles.

[13:57] All right, so we've got Elton John owners continue to tell

[14:00] us it's the greatest game of all time.

[14:02] Will that keep prices steady?

[14:04] I am seeing right now distributors like Mike at Automated.

[14:08] He has Elton John CEs in a box ready to ship.

[14:12] So if you want one, don't put up these wanted ads on Pinside.

[14:16] Do you ever notice this weird thing where like, there'll be

[14:19] like 18 games for sale of a specific title and then some

[14:23] dude lists like a wanted ad and it's like, bro, they're for sale

[14:27] all over the place.

[14:28] Why are you saying you want it?

[14:30] They're readily available.

[14:31] So like just go open up one of these 15 for sale ads and go

[14:36] get yourself a game.

[14:37] All right, so we're waiting on John Wick.

[14:39] Elton John is out.

[14:40] Where is this fun house?

[14:41] I think something's happening with this fun house launch.

[14:44] I don't know what's taking so long, but it's not good.

[14:47] Another thing is like this Abba game.

[14:49] I've been looking at this thing and it's out.

[14:51] It's been revealed.

[14:52] I don't even know if it's on the line and all I know is when

[14:55] I go on Pinside and I like to jump into the new game threads,

[14:58] right?

[14:59] I'm going to go into like old game threads and read about what's

[15:02] happening with like Deadpool ball hangups and stuff like that.

[15:05] That's not exciting to me.

[15:06] I know that's not exciting to you.

[15:08] When I go into the Abba thread, I'm hit with nothing, but

[15:11] like distributors trying to take money on this game and there is

[15:15] no game yet.

[15:16] Like it's not on the line.

[15:17] I don't understand why anybody would like order this game right

[15:21] now.

[15:22] It's just where is it?

[15:23] You got to reveal your game and get it to customers.

[15:25] I went into the barrels of fun thread the other day and I'm

[15:28] starting to see a little like descent a little bit in there for

[15:31] people that ordered that game early on from barrels of fun.

[15:36] They don't really have a line of sight into when they're going

[15:39] to get their game.

[15:40] And I think distributors have been getting their allotments

[15:43] ahead of people that order directly.

[15:46] Now look, if you ask me, people that order direct should get

[15:50] their games first.

[15:51] I'll tell you why because they're putting more money in your

[15:55] pocket.

[15:56] You're not giving money to a distributor or a dealer.

[15:59] They don't get their margin.

[16:01] So if you sell an $11,000 labyrinth and you're a dealer, you

[16:05] got to probably keep like $1,500 or $2,000 of that for yourself.

[16:10] But if you're barrels of fun and you sell that game directly,

[16:13] you're keeping $2,000 more money for your company.

[16:17] So shouldn't the person who buys direct get their game earlier?

[16:22] I don't understand pinball sales at all.

[16:25] I think it's a system that was set in place in the 1970s and

[16:29] nobody seems to want to rock the boat.

[16:31] All right, so let's do a little bit of Canadian collector's

[16:33] corner.

[16:34] It's been a while since I did this.

[16:36] So we're going to go on pinside marketplace.

[16:38] We're going to see if people have given up the delusion and

[16:41] we're going to see what games are for sale for $14,000 or more.

[16:46] Right?

[16:47] Because the problem now is if I put up like $12,000, I'm going

[16:50] to get every single delusional Venom LE owner and James Bond

[16:55] owner and Foo Fighter LE owner trying to cash out on their

[16:59] games that are now all worth below $10,000.

[17:03] And speaking of below $10,000, I have to report this.

[17:07] I saw a Guns N' Roses CE for sale for $10,000.

[17:13] That's the cheapest I've ever seen a GNR CE for sale.

[17:18] And for those of you out there, as much as I love Guns N' Roses

[17:21] as a band, this game is never going to go back up in value.

[17:25] It doesn't matter if you put the capacitor kit in.

[17:28] It doesn't matter what you do to the code.

[17:31] It doesn't matter.

[17:33] They made too many.

[17:35] They made too many and too many people have played it and

[17:39] have had a bad experience playing it.

[17:42] You're not going to be able to go back to all of those people.

[17:45] There's going to be thousands of people who have played GNR,

[17:49] didn't like the mushy flippers, didn't like the layout,

[17:53] and didn't like the stupid multi-balls that keep coming at you

[17:57] that make it feel like you're flailing and chopping wood

[18:00] every time you start a mode.

[18:02] And so how are you going to go back and change all of those

[18:05] people's minds?

[18:06] You know, it's just too late.

[18:08] It's too late.

[18:09] And this is why it's so important that you polish a game over

[18:13] the first year that it's out.

[18:15] If Jersey Jack had done that and continued to make this better,

[18:19] the first year the game was out, we wouldn't have so many more

[18:24] people hating on the game and you're never going to win those

[18:27] people back over again.

[18:29] It's just the way it goes.

[18:30] If you sleep with somebody and they're bad in bed,

[18:33] are you going to let them back into your bed because they're

[18:35] like, I'm better now.

[18:37] Give me another shot.

[18:38] It doesn't work like that.

[18:39] All right.

[18:40] So what do we got for sale in the pin side marketplace

[18:42] in Canada's collector's corner?

[18:44] We got a $16,900 bonsai run fully restored.

[18:49] No thank you.

[18:51] That's a crack pipe price for a bonsai run.

[18:53] In Adams Family Gold, $30,000 for an Adams Family Gold.

[18:58] No freaking way.

[19:00] He says it's a one of a kind mint condition, many tasteful mods.

[19:05] I don't care.

[19:06] You know it's a better tasteful mod than an Adams Family Gold?

[19:11] $30,000.

[19:12] I'd rather have $30,000 in cash burning a hole in my pocket.

[19:16] We got a Metallica Masters of Puppets LE for $14,750.

[19:23] I would stay so clear away from any Metallica purchases until

[19:28] you see what the new game is from Stern Pinball because if

[19:32] it's amazing and it has zombie Eddie on artwork and the code

[19:36] is anywhere near as good as the Liming Code and it's filled

[19:40] with mechanisms, some of which may be inspired by this game's

[19:44] mechanisms, I think all of these older DMD Metallicas are going

[19:49] to lose value.

[19:50] So stay as far away as you can from a Metallica right now.

[19:54] All right.

[19:55] A Batman 66.

[19:56] There's only 240 of these.

[19:58] A Batman 66 number 69 Bat Gadget Edition is $20,500.

[20:06] Wow.

[20:07] That's a lot.

[20:08] Remember this game knew was I think like 10-5.

[20:11] Like this is crazy.

[20:13] But look, there's only 240 in the world.

[20:16] And as I said, Batman is going to be one of those rare Stern

[20:19] LEs that they didn't overproduce and it has a topper everybody

[20:23] wants and it's a beautiful game even if it is clunky.

[20:26] So I think that Batman 66 is a little overpriced.

[20:29] I think in LE, you're more in the ballpark of like 17 to $18,000.

[20:35] Elvira's House of Horrors 40th anniversary edition in a box.

[20:40] See, these people got screwed because the Blood Kiss Edition

[20:44] is nicer.

[20:45] And now these owners are all trying to get something out of

[20:48] this because remember when this game was sold to people in a

[20:51] box, it was 15 grand and then distros at the very beginning

[20:55] we're getting $25,000 for this game.

[20:59] This person's got one new in a box.

[21:02] Only 199 have been made and he wants 18,500 for it.

[21:08] I don't know if you're going to get it.

[21:10] I don't know.

[21:11] I think Elvira the problem is now that there's like three or

[21:14] four special editions of the game.

[21:16] Remember there's an LE, there's a signature edition and there's

[21:21] a 40th anniversary edition and there's a Blood Kiss Edition.

[21:26] So there are four different LE versions of this game.

[21:30] This is the most different variations of a game.

[21:34] I think Stern has ever done since like maybe Metallica had a

[21:38] few versions in Spider-Man, but none of those had four versions

[21:41] that were labeled and numbered as LE versions of the game.

[21:46] We've got a Godzilla limited edition with a topper for 16,000

[21:50] gang.

[21:51] Those days are over.

[21:52] The days of Godzilla getting $16,000, it's over.

[21:56] The other reason why I think it's over, the game's been out

[21:58] a long time.

[21:59] I think everyone's had their fun with Godzilla.

[22:01] I think people are starting to realize that Jaws is really

[22:04] good game and I think a lot of the Elwin fan base is going to

[22:07] move from Godzilla over to Jaws.

[22:09] I see Godzilla LEs actually settling around $12,000 by the

[22:14] end of the year.

[22:15] So I would not go anywhere near one for 16.

[22:18] The other reason is this, is 16 was the price of a Godzilla LE

[22:21] at the height of COVID.

[22:23] Those days are over.

[22:24] Here's not a bad buy.

[22:26] A Hepree-Stored Adams family for 16.5.

[22:30] Now look, Adams family, one of the greatest pinball machines

[22:33] of all time.

[22:34] It's the most heavily made game of all time with 22,000, but

[22:38] you're not going to find a lot of Hepree-Stored one.

[22:41] Hepra-Esterations before there was all these remakes.

[22:44] Like he was the de facto and what he does is a work of art.

[22:47] And so I think a Hepree-Stored Adams family for 16.5 is actually

[22:52] not a bad buy.

[22:53] I think it's the kind of game where if you put it into your

[22:55] lineup, it's absolutely going to hold its own next to a $13,000

[23:00] Stern LE.

[23:01] Because remember, a $13,000 Stern LE with a $2,000 topper is

[23:07] priced right near a Hepree-Stored Adams family.

[23:11] So not a bad buy.

[23:13] A big Lebowski with the lit apron for $14,500 in stock at

[23:18] Automated.

[23:19] So Mike's got Lebowski's in boxes in stock.

[23:23] I think this game new is $13,500.

[23:25] So Mike's trying to make $1,000 on top of the MSRP to cut the

[23:30] line, but it just goes to show you that Lebowski's another game

[23:34] where they're just going to keep making them.

[23:36] It doesn't have that like, oh, you know, collector quality

[23:39] anymore.

[23:40] And that's okay, but it used to, right?

[23:42] It used to when Dutch pinball didn't have many in the world,

[23:45] having a Lebowski was special.

[23:47] Now it's readily available.

[23:49] Here's an Elvira 40th anniversary with a topper included for

[23:53] 17-8.

[23:54] Again, beautiful game.

[23:56] I actually prefer the 40th over the Blood Kiss edition.

[23:59] I do.

[24:00] I think it looks nicer.

[24:01] But again, I think they just screwed over everybody.

[24:03] Here's a pirate to the Caribbean.

[24:04] This is my friend Derek's pirates.

[24:06] It's sold already.

[24:07] And I know he got close to $30,000 for that game.

[24:11] This next one is just the problem with multi-morphic.

[24:13] And if I was Jerry, I would call this guy up and be like,

[24:16] can you take this down?

[24:17] Because this is the problem with it.

[24:19] My entire P3 setup with five playfields, $21,000.

[24:26] See, this is the problem.

[24:27] Nobody's ever going to buy a multi-morphic with five playfields,

[24:31] one of which is not the Princess Bride, and spend $21,000.

[24:37] No, thank you.

[24:39] It's just never going to happen.

[24:40] Here's another Godzilla LE.

[24:42] What's with these Godzilla LE owners?

[24:44] $17,000 firm.

[24:46] Get out of dodge.

[24:47] $17,000 firm.

[24:48] Never get in it.

[24:49] This was an interesting one.

[24:51] A Foo Fighters LE and a Venom LE first sale at Pinfest for $18,000 firm.

[24:59] Think about that for a minute.

[25:00] A Foo Fighters LE was $13,000.

[25:04] A Venom LE was $13,000.

[25:06] That's $26,000.

[25:09] So this guy was selling both of them for $18,000.

[25:13] That's an $8,000 loss.

[25:16] And he's got a sale pending.

[25:18] Whoever bought this, congratulations.

[25:20] Good on you.

[25:21] But it just goes to show you this person bought two Stern LE's

[25:25] and lost $8,000.

[25:28] $8,000.

[25:30] Here's what's funny.

[25:31] There's another Adams Family Gold Edition for $16,000.

[25:34] This one's interesting to me.

[25:36] I haven't seen this game come up for sale.

[25:38] I know for a fact that owners of this game used to turn down offers of $50,000.

[25:46] Yes, I am saying that right.

[25:48] $50,000 for this game was turned down at the height of COVID.

[25:53] And it is no other than the Matrix by Pinovating.

[25:57] Those guys in the Netherlands who made that Matrix game.

[25:59] It was a reskinned Johnny Mnumonic.

[26:01] There is one for sale and it is listed for $19,000 or best offer.

[26:07] And it looks like it's coming from somewhere like I think in the Netherlands.

[26:10] But it just goes to show you, you know, now the rumors of the Matrix coming out.

[26:15] How far some of these like unique homebrew games have fallen.

[26:20] And the Matrix was one where I think they only made like eight of them.

[26:24] And so at the very height, it was like the only way you could play Matrix pinball was through this.

[26:30] It still is the only way you can play Matrix pinball.

[26:32] And it is a really cool game.

[26:34] But man, $50,000 at the height now down to $20,000.

[26:38] I know there was a Batman Super LE for sale over at Orange County Pinball.

[26:43] It has sold.

[26:44] I know it sold for around $30,000.

[26:46] So, Canada now is the only one that is still like up for sale.

[26:50] I do have a sale pending.

[26:51] The money has not changed hands.

[26:53] But I also found out that it did sell for just a little bit more than my offer.

[26:58] So I'm not sure, you know, I'm not sure.

[27:01] But you know, I probably will let it go.

[27:03] And then we've got a Hepree store to Whitewater for $15,000.

[27:06] I think that's too much for a Whitewater.

[27:08] See, look, there's another Batman LE that sold for $15,500.

[27:11] See, that's the thing.

[27:12] You got to really shop around people.

[27:14] Where was the other one?

[27:15] The other one was for sale for $20,000.

[27:17] So it just goes to show you.

[27:18] One guy wants to sell a Batman LE for $20,000.

[27:22] Another person lists it for $15,500.

[27:25] That's a huge discrepancy and price.

[27:27] And if you want to sell your game, you got to get off of the delusional crap.

[27:32] There's a difference between listening a game to actually sell it and then just

[27:36] listening it to see what you might get one day down the road.

[27:39] Everybody, thank you for joining me on Canada's Corner.

[27:42] This is always a lot of fun.

[27:44] I love talking about this stuff with you guys every day.

[27:46] I might get the baby tonight.

[27:48] I might get the baby this weekend.

[27:50] The baby is coming.

[27:51] The due date is May 4th.

[27:52] I can't wait to share photos of this new addition to the family.

[27:56] Everybody, thank you so much for your support.

[27:59] I know it's the beginning of the month.

[28:01] That $5 bill just burns a hole in some of your pockets.

[28:05] If you want to raise your support for Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[28:09] would be much appreciated.

[28:10] Now that I've got two kids, everything is like three times as expensive.

[28:13] We'll talk to you soon.

[28:14] Later, Pokemon theme song, Take Us Away.

[28:29] Pokemon theme song, Take Us Away.
