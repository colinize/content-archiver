[00:00] So that's it?

[00:19] Everyone's just gonna stand by and let Jersey Jack say don't buy your products and you're

[00:25] gonna do nothing?

[00:27] You're gonna sit on the sidelines and wait for everybody to see Harry Potter?

[00:32] Where are you at Barrels of Fun?

[00:33] Wake up!

[00:34] Where are you at Pinball Brothers?

[00:36] Wake up!

[00:37] Where is everybody at?

[00:38] Is this what pinball has become in the marketing world?

[00:41] You're gonna sit by and try to launch your product on top of Harry Potter.

[00:46] You need to get your games out now.

[00:48] We are a post-Texas Pinball Festival and it is gonna be April next week and these companies

[00:55] are about to make the biggest marketing mistake and they're gonna do it for silly reasons.

[01:01] I'm four cups of coffee in.

[01:03] Let's talk about this.

[01:04] So Jersey Jack Pinball said that Harry Potter is confirmed.

[01:08] We knew it was coming out but here's the thing now.

[01:11] You know Keith Owens King Kong is also around the corner.

[01:15] You know you got Predator from Pinball Brothers.

[01:18] I heard a rumor it might not have Arnold in the game.

[01:21] If it doesn't have Arnold in the game, I'm not buying that game.

[01:24] But I just want to say right now, what is everybody waiting for?

[01:29] This is the window.

[01:31] If you've got a game that's developed enough to show and you can take orders on it, we

[01:38] don't care if it's gonna take like a month or two to ship.

[01:43] Nobody cares.

[01:44] Look at the market data.

[01:47] When Spooky Pinball revealed Evil Dead in December, were there games in boxes in December?

[01:53] No.

[01:54] When did the first Evil Deads go out?

[01:57] About six to eight weeks after that.

[02:00] When freakin Melvin showcased Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, it was in October.

[02:07] I think it was even late September and the first game just went out the door.

[02:12] Six months later, he sold every single one back in October.

[02:17] So I don't understand why people have this mentality.

[02:21] So we need games in boxes and that's what I want my company to be known for and I'm

[02:26] here to tell you, nobody cares.

[02:30] That is not an important thing.

[02:32] The moment your company has established itself as a company that will deliver product, we

[02:39] know that people are okay waiting a couple months to get the product.

[02:45] So if you're David Van As and you're sitting on a game and you're like, well, I want to

[02:50] make sure that every single labyrinth goes out the door before I announce my next game

[02:55] and I want games to be in boxes.

[02:57] Well, David, what happens when that moment coincides with King Kong?

[03:03] What happens when that moment coincides with freakin Harry Potter?

[03:08] The game, unless it's something like Goonies and I hope it's Goonies, but if it's Dune

[03:13] and you launch on top of Harry Potter and King Kong and people only have so much money

[03:19] and room, you're going to be pretty DOA brother.

[03:23] I mean it.

[03:24] Now is a window and maybe you're saying, Canadian, you're just trying to get these companies

[03:28] to release.

[03:29] Yeah, you got to get out now.

[03:32] If you wait, think about it.

[03:34] If you wait and you allow thousands of people to commit to buying a $15,000 Harry Potter

[03:43] and you know they're going to have a superior product.

[03:48] You don't have a better product.

[03:51] Both Pimbal Brothers and Barrels of Fun do not have a superior product to Jersey Jack

[03:59] or Stern.

[04:00] You got to lock in your orders now.

[04:04] We don't care if the games are already on the line or made.

[04:08] It doesn't matter.

[04:10] You know you're not going to have something better than King Kong or Harry Potter.

[04:16] So you better get orders now.

[04:19] You know if I know that Brenda could go on a date with someone way more successful than

[04:24] me, I need to get on that date first.

[04:28] I need to show her why she should fall in love with me and get her to commit before she

[04:32] makes a better decision.

[04:34] She's listening to this right now, but that's where these companies are.

[04:38] They think they're going to make some sort of statement.

[04:41] And so Barrels of Fun, I think you're making a huge marketing mistake by waiting.

[04:46] I think Pimbal Brothers, you know if you've got Predator ready to go, don't tease us.

[04:51] We know it's Predator.

[04:53] What are you waiting for?

[04:54] We know you're going to make the games.

[04:56] You made Queen.

[04:57] You made Abba.

[04:58] You made the Alien games.

[05:00] Once there is no longer hesitation on locking in money and orders because you've delivered,

[05:08] just time it right.

[05:10] This is the thing right now that I think everybody's playing all wrong.

[05:13] You let everybody else march into TTF.

[05:17] Not that you needed TTF, but you let everybody else take money that could have gone to your

[05:23] company.

[05:24] CGC just sold a thousand medieval madness games again.

[05:29] You just let $12,500,000 go out the door towards your competitors.

[05:36] $12,500,000.

[05:38] And I don't think anyone really ordered that many portals and we know they didn't sell

[05:43] Merlin's Arcade.

[05:44] These aren't the games people really want.

[05:46] I mean, Chris Turner, man, we love you, but you really did just bring another deep root

[05:51] game to market.

[05:53] There's no other way around it.

[05:54] This was a deep root game and it wasn't the deep root game that had people's attention.

[06:01] It wasn't.

[06:02] And I don't even understand that market strategy.

[06:04] What market research did you do to think you could sell five to 600 Merlin's Arcade games?

[06:13] If Pimbal Brothers has Predator, I mean this, and Arnold is in it, I'm saying this right

[06:17] now, they will sell easily 1000 units of the game easily, but Arnold has to be in it.

[06:25] If they make Predator without Arnold, they will hardly sell any of these.

[06:31] It's that simple.

[06:33] And Jersey Jack takes orders on Harry Potter CE during a window of time.

[06:40] I didn't say they were going to make an unlimited amount.

[06:42] I said they are going to make as many Harry Potter CEs as people order during a period

[06:51] of time.

[06:52] I don't know if it's going to be one day, one week, or one month.

[06:56] If I was a guessing man, I would say it's going to be at least a week they're going to

[07:02] take orders.

[07:03] And they're going to get thousands of orders, people, from consumers, from dealers and distros.

[07:10] They're going to get so many orders that a Harry Potter CE won't even be a collector's

[07:17] addition item.

[07:18] It just won't.

[07:20] And so that's going to blow up the whole FOMO around the CE markets for Jersey Jack.

[07:28] Interested to see what happens there.

[07:30] If I were you now, see, I'm never going to be able to scalp this game.

[07:34] Even if I want this game, even if I don't want to scalp it, I'm not an idiot.

[07:38] I'm not going to buy this thing now.

[07:40] I don't care how long the window is open.

[07:42] I'm not going to buy this thing now on day one or when that window is even open because

[07:48] I know what's going to happen.

[07:51] The dealers and distros are going to overorder this thing the same way they overordered guns

[07:56] and roses.

[07:57] And there will be so many of them that you will easily be able to get one for much less

[08:03] than $15,000.

[08:05] And I think that is exactly what is going to happen.

[08:08] Stern's going to march in with only, I know it's crazy to say this, but they're going

[08:12] to march in with only 1000 King Kongs in a world in which Jersey Jack is now going to

[08:18] go as many as you want.

[08:21] All of a sudden, now 1000 feels like it's limited because of that.

[08:26] But man, I don't know, like is King Kong going to be as good as Godzilla?

[08:30] I heard Stern is in big trouble.

[08:31] The number I am now hearing, and I can't confirm or deny this, but the number I am hearing

[08:38] is that Stern has somewhere around 10,000 new in box Stern games are sitting in inventory

[08:48] unsold.

[08:50] Does that mean Stern has those games?

[08:52] I don't know.

[08:53] But even if like half of that is true, right?

[08:56] Even if half of that is accurate, that there are 5000 games in a box without any demand

[09:03] for them, without any homes, what's going to happen when all of that inventory has to find

[09:10] a place to go?

[09:12] See I think we always think about this hobby like the manufacturers are going to go out

[09:16] of business, but that's not what's going to happen first.

[09:19] The first thing we're going to witness are dealers and distros going out of business

[09:25] because these dealers or distros are the ones who have to buy these games.

[09:30] And are you telling me that these dealers and distros, that they pay for these games

[09:35] cash or are they buying these games on credit?

[09:39] Are they using credit cards?

[09:42] So every month they've got an interest payment on the money they use to acquire that inventory.

[09:50] Back in the old days, that wasn't a problem because that inventory was coming in and going

[09:56] out within a month.

[09:57] So when you had a new title, you were moving all of your Ellie's premiums and pros.

[10:02] They're not used to having, I mean these dealers still have Venoms, John Wick's, Foo Fighters,

[10:10] Godzilla's, like the stuff is just piling up.

[10:13] Every time I see the Stern line each Friday, more Godzilla's in the world.

[10:18] Is there a demand for that?

[10:20] Nobody has Godzilla premiums sitting in a box?

[10:23] So I think it's going to be the dealers and the distros that we see fall first.

[10:28] And when that starts to happen, we know who's next, the manufacturers.

[10:33] Because once the dealers and distros start to fall, then you lose your customers.

[10:37] Because remember, those are the predominant customers for all of these companies.

[10:41] That's the sales force for all of these companies.

[10:45] Now the only thing that's going to save Pinball in this crazy high priced world where nothing

[10:51] is collectible anymore, where there's no FOMO, the only thing that's going to save it are

[10:55] magical games.

[10:57] And look where we are.

[10:59] It's almost April, Portal, Merlin's Arcade, another run of medieval madness a game we've

[11:05] had for 35 years and nothing else.

[11:08] D&D is a great game.

[11:10] Don't get me wrong, it's a great game.

[11:12] I would never buy an Ellie for 13.

[11:14] I wouldn't even buy a premium for 9,500 because all of it, all of it, nothing is immune to

[11:22] what the market is now doing.

[11:24] It is basically chipping 30% of the game value off of the MSRP in just two to three months.

[11:31] So why wouldn't you just wait?

[11:33] And that's where I'm at.

[11:34] I'm going to wait on the sidelines now.

[11:36] I'm no longer going to chase Harry Potter when it goes up for sale because I know if

[11:41] I want one and the game is magical and look, I hope it's magical.

[11:45] Three levels of play, does that mean two upper playfields and a regular playfield doesn't

[11:49] mean a lower playfield and an upper playfield?

[11:51] I don't know.

[11:52] We're going to see it soon enough, but I'm going to wait because I know if I really want

[11:56] to see, I'm not going to have to spend anywhere near 15,000 as all of these dealers overorder

[12:03] it.

[12:04] You know, Steve Richie's game is delayed.

[12:06] I've got some news on Steve Richie's game.

[12:08] I will deliver at a later date.

[12:10] I think it's going to be another one of these titles where is the demand there for it?

[12:16] We're going to find out more on that.

[12:18] Jersey Jack loves making it hard on itself.

[12:21] I'll just say that.

[12:22] And then think about it in just like two months, Kong, Potter, those are the big ones, Predator,

[12:30] and then barrels of fun.

[12:32] And so I'm looking at the calendar right now and I'm just wondering what's going on inside

[12:38] the head of David Van Ness.

[12:39] David, I know you listened to the show.

[12:40] I'm here to tell you right now.

[12:42] You're making a marketing mistake thinking you need to wait to this game is in a box

[12:48] before you reveal it.

[12:50] Nobody cares.

[12:52] All of the market data shows us you don't need to do that.

[12:56] What you need to do is make sure you get out in front of King Kong and Harry Potter quickly.

[13:04] And it doesn't seem like that's your priority.

[13:08] It's more about showing people what barrels can do.

[13:11] We know what you can do.

[13:13] You don't have to prove it anymore.

[13:15] Don't make that mistake, brother.

[13:17] Get your game out sooner than later.

[13:19] Pinball Brothers, same thing.

[13:22] If you've got this big theme, what are you waiting for?

[13:25] What are you waiting for?

[13:26] We now know Harry Potter is coming within the next couple of months and Jersey Jack just

[13:32] told everybody in this hobby not to buy your product.

[13:35] Are you going to take that?

[13:37] Are you going to take that when you've got the Sambini gun and you've got Arnold and you

[13:42] know how to take down a monster, a juggernaut, an invincible force like a better company

[13:47] like JJP, you're going to take that on the chin and say, hey, maybe grown men are into

[13:54] predator and not Harry Potter.

[13:57] Maybe start to punch back a little bit, but with some real marketing, not just a picture

[14:01] of a box.

[14:02] Hey, something might be inside here.

[14:04] Wake up.

[14:05] All of you guys, I'm going to go in a little bit of a rant.

[14:07] This market and this industry does nothing interesting, nothing creative whatsoever.

[14:14] Spending $100,000 on a polished video is stupid.

[14:19] That doesn't leave a memorable moment for people.

[14:22] That's not creative.

[14:23] That is not creative at all.

[14:25] That video production company is laughing all the way to the bank.

[14:29] When was the last time you saw someone do anything creative whatsoever to launch their

[14:34] game?

[14:35] Crappy teasers leaving behind stickers in bathrooms and then they want to sell you millions of

[14:41] dollars of this product.

[14:43] When it comes to marketing and it comes to how to get people excited, they don't know

[14:47] what to do.

[14:48] Here's a box.

[14:49] Here's underneath the play field.

[14:51] Here's a bunch of crossword puzzles at Texas Pinball Festival.

[14:54] Here's a close above a ramp.

[14:56] They need to take those ramps and shove them where the sun don't shine and actually everybody

[15:00] wake up.

[15:01] Marketing matters.

[15:02] It's going to matter now more than ever.

[15:05] As all these companies are dropping games on top of each other, I've seen nobody, nobody

[15:10] do a marketing move that's been impressive or even smart.

[15:13] Bring out Merlin's arcade when it's unfinished.

[15:16] Why?

[15:17] That's stupid.

[15:18] Announce you're going to make $500.

[15:19] Why?

[15:20] That's stupid.

[15:21] Announce the price is going to go up because of cheap scopes.

[15:23] That's stupid.

[15:24] None of it's smart.

[15:25] None of it's smart and none of it's working.

[15:27] We know it's not working.

[15:29] Even the big companies with multiple millions of dollars and billions of dollars, they don't

[15:33] do things any smarter.

[15:35] How do you make avatar?

[15:36] It's not smart.

[15:37] It is absolutely not smart.

[15:39] If Jersey Jack Pinball made Rick and Morty, they would have sold four times as many as

[15:44] avatar.

[15:45] And yet a tiny little company in Benton, Wisconsin, lands a theme that has way more demand than

[15:52] a major, major company.

[15:53] What's happening people?

[15:55] What's happening?

[15:56] I'm on fire.

[15:57] A lot of coffee in me today and I'm just trying to get a fun show up for you guys today.

[16:00] But this is how I feel.

[16:02] This is how I feel.

[16:03] This is the easiest product in the world to market.

[16:05] It really is.

[16:06] And the marketing journey around Pinball starts with what theme are we going to make?

[16:11] Are 40 to 60 year old grown men going to want to play Merlin's arcade?

[16:15] No, not at all.

[16:17] So that game dies on that level.

[16:19] I don't care how nice you are.

[16:21] I don't care how nice John Norris is.

[16:23] I don't care.

[16:24] Robert Mueller made horrible decisions.

[16:27] So you want to bring Robert Mueller's ideas to life.

[16:30] That is called bad decision making, bad marketing, bad leadership.

[16:35] Why?

[16:36] Why did the work that happened at Robert Mueller's crook factory, did we forget all this?

[16:42] That all these games were developed originally by stealing money from old ladies who now

[16:47] have no pensions?

[16:49] How quickly we forget, right people?

[16:51] Okay, that game never should have been made.

[16:53] Portal, I don't have a problem with.

[16:54] I think Portal works good for P3 Multimorphic.

[16:57] The platform itself doesn't really excite people.

[17:01] That's never going to change.

[17:02] It doesn't matter what Jerry puts on this platform.

[17:05] The fact that they can't make games quick enough.

[17:07] The fact that the platform is not a loss leader item.

[17:10] It needs to be.

[17:12] Jerry needs to sell this thing for $6,000 for the total package and then make money on

[17:17] the module things.

[17:18] And then make money with licensed downloadable content.

[17:22] That's how you make money with video game consoles.

[17:25] That's what he's trying to do on this, but then he's trying to charge you $13,000.

[17:30] So it's not a loss leader thing.

[17:33] It's just a thing that's not enticing or attractive to the majority of people who buy these things.

[17:39] And I've been saying this for 12 years, right?

[17:41] 12 years.

[17:42] This guy has not sold as many games as I have of subscribers.

[17:47] And I say it, and I mean it when I say it.

[17:49] If you can sell a thousand units of your pinball machine to a global market that buys pinball

[17:57] that's in the 5 or 10,000 potential buyers, then what you've made isn't working.

[18:04] If Jerry made a normal pinball machine and one was Princess Bride and one was Portal,

[18:11] he would sell two to three times as many in a normal pinball wooden play field platform.

[18:17] You know what I'm saying?

[18:18] What else to say about it?

[18:19] He'll never test the market even though the market is showing him what the market wants.

[18:24] But man, I keep coming back.

[18:26] I keep coming back to one thing.

[18:28] I think stern pinball isn't big trouble.

[18:31] I do.

[18:32] I think stern pinball is in a lot more trouble than people realize.

[18:36] And I don't want stern pinball to go away, but I think they've sort of bit off more than

[18:41] they can chew.

[18:42] And I was talking to my friend, Bill Brandis about this, and he sort of pinpoints one moment

[18:47] and I agree with him.

[18:48] He says the moment stern pinball lost the narrative is when they declared themselves a lifestyle

[18:57] brand.

[18:58] That is not what a pinball company is.

[19:01] And the moment they declared themselves that, they went down a road where they forgot.

[19:07] They forgot what this is all about, like what these games need to cost, what people expect

[19:14] from you, how many you should make, how much should you charge.

[19:18] The reason now they are a lifestyle brand, it's not in a good way, is that if you buy

[19:22] one, it severely adjusts your lifestyle.

[19:26] I can no longer go on vacation.

[19:29] I can no longer get the other things I want.

[19:31] I can no longer send my kids to college because I bought three pinball machines.

[19:36] Yeah, that's where it's at.

[19:38] There's a lot of people out there that love supporting all of these companies, all of

[19:44] these years when the price was right.

[19:47] So no, you're not a lifestyle brand.

[19:50] You're not.

[19:51] Nobody aspires to be associated with you.

[19:55] That's not a lifestyle brand just because you sell a t-shirt doesn't make you a lifestyle

[20:00] brand.

[20:01] So yeah, I'm worried about them because the rumors I'm hearing aren't good.

[20:06] They need a hit.

[20:08] And even a hit game is not going to make those games in inventory go away.

[20:15] That's the white walkers, man.

[20:16] I mean this.

[20:17] You know when you watch Game of Thrones and you're like, yeah, the Lannisters and the

[20:21] other families, like all the humans are fighting each other, but the real enemy are the white

[20:27] walkers.

[20:29] And when I think about pinball, yeah, all these companies are competing with new and

[20:33] box games, but the real enemy that could take down this entire hobby and new and box and

[20:39] all these companies are those unsolved games.

[20:44] Those are the white walkers.

[20:45] When they pop up and they rear their ugly heads and we see the image from like the warehouse

[20:52] where they're all there.

[20:54] You know what that means when there's five to 10,000 unsolved games?

[20:58] It means the entire pinball market will quasi-collapse when it comes to value when all of those things

[21:06] go somewhere because it means that everything we have, it's going to oversupply and just

[21:11] destroy the demand.

[21:13] You know, it's crazy.

[21:14] I just wish we had a little bit more transparency.

[21:18] So we knew, right?

[21:19] We knew.

[21:20] Here's how many games Stern made this last year.

[21:22] I wish we could all step into earnings calls with all of these companies, right?

[21:27] I would love to see it.

[21:28] How many multi-morphics did they sell?

[21:30] We know how many spooky games are sold.

[21:32] Congratulations guys.

[21:34] You just sold all of your evil deads.

[21:36] That's a great thing.

[21:37] So we know spooky sold 888 games.

[21:41] Stern might be making that a week, a week.

[21:45] Who's buying all these games?
