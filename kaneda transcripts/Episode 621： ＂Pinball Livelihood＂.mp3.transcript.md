[00:00] From a place it was dark as I was and just it gets in his place

[00:02] Selling these words be like a switchblade

[00:04] Do a hate is ribcage

[00:05] Then let it be known, if I'm this day full

[00:07] I wanna just say thanks

[00:09] Cause your haters will cave in his strengths

[00:10] To let them be traced cause I came in five-nine

[00:12] But I feel like I'm sick so

[00:14] Hey, it's just once for you and me

[00:16] Say, I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick

[00:21] I've been up since four o'clock in the morning

[00:23] And for those of you out there who are new fathers

[00:26] Or remember what it was like being a new dad

[00:29] There is nothing like sleep and there's nothing like trying to get sleep, but I'm here to tell you that

[00:35] Killian and Brenda are doing really well and I would trade no sleep to have the most amazing baby boy

[00:42] and amazing wife in the world. And I've been up since four o'clock in the morning and I've been

[00:47] thinking about something in the Pimbal world that's just been weighing on my mind because I've

[00:52] been receiving some indictments lately that I think I want to address head on and I want to do a

[00:58] little bit of a different Pimbal podcast right now and I hope you can go along on this journey

[01:02] with me because I think it's really important that I discuss this because I believe deep down

[01:08] fundamentally this is the very foundation of Canada's Pimbal podcast what I want to talk about

[01:14] and I want to talk about my ability to freely express how I feel about Pimbal machines and Pimbal

[01:20] companies without the concern and this is the indictment that when Canada speaks freely on his show

[01:28] he does it with a total reckless disregard for the livelihood of the men and women who work in

[01:35] the Pimbal industry and I want to talk about this because I think this is really important and I

[01:41] think this is the reason why this show is different from every other show that is out there.

[01:46] If this indictment were true then some of the things I say on this show have to carry some

[01:51] consequence and some weight in the Pimbal world that you would believe that something I say could

[01:57] actually negatively impact somebody's career and also negatively impact their ability to sell

[02:04] their games because I would say something that would make people not want to buy the game.

[02:09] On my show I try to do reviews of games and I try to give you my impressions of a game when we

[02:14] first see it and then I try to give you my feelings on a game after I jump on it. I also try to

[02:20] give you my opinions about a company's marketing strategy and the decisions they make and by that

[02:27] I mean the themes they choose to put into the marketplace. I mean when they decide to launch their

[02:33] games right that's also a marketing decision are you going to launch your game when there are

[02:38] months of no launches or will you launch your game right after Godzilla or right after Mandalorian.

[02:44] That is an interesting thing to discuss because that will impact a company's ability to sell a game

[02:51] and to have sales success and I noticed when I got into the Pimbal hobby and I got into the Pimbal

[02:56] podcasting world and I got onto the forum there was always a division. There were those people

[03:02] that just loved Pimbal and loved everything Pimbal related. They loved playing Pimbal. They loved

[03:08] that there were new companies making Pimbal machines and they were never ever critical about

[03:13] anything that a Pimbal company did. They would give glowing reviews to games that weren't that

[03:20] great. They would support every single new Pimbal venture regardless of who was behind that venture

[03:27] and I was around during all of it. There's a reason why John Papadu took money. There's a reason

[03:32] why Andrew Highway got money. There's a reason why Kevin Kulik was given money. There was a period of

[03:37] time in which everybody was championing and celebrating every single new person that threw their hat

[03:44] into the Pimbal ring. Now if you're getting into Pimbal now people are a lot wiser. People are a

[03:49] lot smarter and they are and they are and that is why only 122 Raza orders were placed. If Raza,

[03:57] if that prototype was marched out to Houston five years ago they would have got way more orders

[04:04] even without showing manufacturing because back in the day Kevin Kulik didn't show manufacturing.

[04:10] Andrew Highway didn't really show manufacturing. Nobody really showed manufacturing. It was just

[04:15] you showed up at a show with an empty box and a translate and people were writing checks on the

[04:21] spot for $16,000 for Magic Girl and nobody said boo about it but we're different now. We're smarter

[04:28] now and now we're a little bit more discerning. Now we look at these companies and these products with

[04:34] a little bit more skepticism, a little bit more cynicism and the reason why we should be looking at

[04:41] these games with a little bit more of a fine comb is that these things are all now really expensive.

[04:48] And so if I think about my role in the Pimbal hobby and what Canatus Pimbal podcast is trying to do

[04:54] it's very simple. My goal, my mission, my objective on this show has never changed. I want to see

[05:02] the most amazing, magical and wonderful worlds under glass delivered to us for the amount of money

[05:09] we are spending on these games. That is my singular mission statement. To look at every single new game

[05:16] through that lens and ask, are we getting a magical, wonderful world under glass? Are we getting

[05:22] that symphony, that orchestra in which the code and the mix and the shots and the artwork and the

[05:28] music and the call outs all come together to create an experience that justifies the extraordinary

[05:36] high prices of these games. And I know there are some very, very rich men out there who collect

[05:42] Pimbal machines who don't care because this much money means nothing to them. But the majority

[05:48] of people aren't that way. The majority of Pimbal buyers don't have multi, multi, multi,

[05:53] millions of dollars to spend. They just don't. So when they buy something, they want to make sure

[05:58] they're getting the best possible pin they can get. So my show is looking at every new game

[06:04] through that lens. And I have to be completely honest in my time covering the Pimbal hobby,

[06:10] the majority of games that do come out do not. If you ask me, they do not deliver this masterful,

[06:18] wonderful world under glass. They just don't. They just don't. And there are tons of apologists.

[06:23] There are tons of people who don't care. Some of them come very close. Some of them do come very

[06:29] close. But for the most part, if you were to ask me like, are these companies? Are they pushing

[06:34] the envelope of creativity? Are they putting new mechs that we haven't seen before into these games?

[06:39] Are they thinking of new design layouts we haven't seen before? Are they sculpting?

[06:44] Right? Are they creating sculpts under the glass? Like, why is the sculpting underneath

[06:49] that Pimbal machine glass so bad when sculpting is not that expensive? It's they go cheap on some

[06:55] of this stuff. And one of the easiest ways to create that world under glass is with sculpts and

[07:00] molding and the use of plastic and creative and unique ways like take a game like white water.

[07:05] Look at the boulders. Look at the way they sculpt it. Look at the Yeti toy. Look at all that stuff.

[07:09] If that was made today, most of that would just be flat plastic. We don't sculpt like that anymore.

[07:16] Why is it? It's not expensive to create a mold and make something like that. And I see companies

[07:22] like Mezzel mods like look at the beautiful sculpts that Mezzel mods is planning for Godzilla. Go

[07:27] look at that. There is a Godzilla modification page. Mezzel mods has shown us what they plan to do

[07:33] in the game and it's absolutely epic. Now you're telling me and I love stuff like that. And that's

[07:39] just what I think we should get out of the box for $10,500. We shouldn't have to buy additional

[07:45] mods, but I will be buying those Mezzel mods because they are going to make Godzilla look incredible.

[07:50] And look, it is fun. It is fun to add additional things to that world under glass. And I think the

[07:56] mod community is a very important community in the Pimbal world. But let me get back to the

[08:02] indictment that things I say on my show have a negative impact on the livelihood of the people

[08:08] who work in the Pimbal industry. And by that, I mean the designers, the artists, the manufacturers,

[08:16] the salespeople, the people on the line. And I want to tell you right now, it is not my responsibility

[08:22] as a Pimbal podcaster to protect the livelihood of anybody who works in the Pimbal industry. I also

[08:30] will not personally go on and attack anybody's livelihood in the Pimbal industry. What I will do

[08:37] is I will review a company's products and a company's games and a company's marketing decisions

[08:45] and a company's services. And I will give you my objective opinion about those things. And if what

[08:50] I say there might hurt that company's perception or might hurt people's perception of a game,

[08:57] I'm allowed to do that. And that's not going to hurt the livelihood because nobody has ever

[09:03] in the five and a half years I've been Pimbal podcasting. Nobody has ever lost their job because

[09:09] of something canada said nobody has ever received a pay cut because of something canada said the

[09:15] only person whose livelihood has ever been under attack and ever been threatened has been my own.

[09:22] And you know those stories and I'm not going to go down that road again. But here's where I take

[09:27] offense to that indictment of me. If you are in control of a Pimbal company and you work at a

[09:33] Pimbal company, your livelihood, your destiny is in your hands. Every decision you make,

[09:42] every decision you make, whether it's you want to do this theme, you want to design the game this

[09:47] way, you want to have this music in it, you want to have this art in the game, all of those decisions,

[09:53] all of the hundreds and thousands of decisions that go into making each Pimbal machine is under your

[10:00] control. So your livelihood, whether you want to be successful or a failure, whether you want to

[10:06] make millions or make nothing, none of that is being controlled by me. So I want everybody to realize

[10:12] that that I have no control over these people's livelihoods. So for example, Zambietti's livelihood

[10:19] is his artwork and Zambietti's livelihood lately has been doing artwork for Stern Pimbal

[10:26] and look at the work that he's put into his games. Zambietti's artwork is phenomenal. You could

[10:33] put Godzilla next to almost every single Pimbal machine in the history of Pimbal machines and it

[10:38] looks better than 99% of them. And look at the detail and the attention and the hard work he put

[10:46] into his livelihood. And nothing I say on this show is going to change that and look at how people

[10:52] are celebrating his work. And I can tell that Jeremy Packer is someone that takes his livelihood

[10:58] seriously and he works really hard to give the best possible thing he can give. And he's in control

[11:04] of his livelihood. If he decided to just mail it in on a game and not apply much effort, we would see

[11:09] it and the sales would probably reflect it. So Jeremy Packer's livelihood is in his own hands,

[11:15] literally as he draws the most amazing art packages in Pimbal. Keith L. Wins's livelihood is

[11:20] designing Pimbal machines. It's in Keith L. Wins hands. It's his destiny to create what he wants

[11:26] to create. And we know how his destiny is going. He is now the number one Pimbal designer in Pimbal

[11:34] two day. He might be carving a path to be seen as the greatest Pimbal designer of all time.

[11:40] And I've played Keith L. Wins games and I understand why people love Keith L. Wins games. And so

[11:45] Keith L. Wins's livelihood is in Keith L. Wins hands. And let's take someone like Steve Richie.

[11:50] He wakes up every day. His livelihood is making Pimbal machines. Steve Richie doesn't have to do

[11:56] another job. This is his job. Seven days a week, he gets paid to make Pimbal machines. And so when

[12:02] Steve Richie has so much time to make a Pimbal machine and he comes out with a game like Led Zeppelin

[12:07] and people are not happy, who heard Steve Richie's livelihood? Was it me or you that doesn't like

[12:13] Led Zeppelin or was it him? He was in full control of that game. And I'm sorry, but I don't want to

[12:18] feel like I can't say I don't like Led Zeppelin because that might hurt Steve Richie's livelihood.

[12:24] If Led Zeppelin turned out the way it did, whose fault was it other than Steve Richie's? Okay.

[12:30] And Steve Richie is now at J.J.P. So his livelihood, he's now making probably more money

[12:36] at Jersey Jack Pimbal. So he might have failed up to a higher salary because his last few stern

[12:42] games have been considered somewhat of design failures. But here's the good news for Steve Richie.

[12:48] He's once again in control of his own livelihood. And we all hope he makes a great game at Jersey

[12:53] Jack Pimbal, but his success and his failure, if his games sell great, it's on him. If his games flop,

[13:00] it's on him. But there is going to be nobody to blame but Steve Richie. And he knows that he's

[13:06] a grown man. This is his livelihood. He gets paid everyday to wake up and make Pimbal machines. And

[13:11] that seems like a dream job. And so we'll see if he can control his livelihood and steer it

[13:17] in a better way over at Jersey Jack Pimbal. And the same is true of Jerry Stelemberg over at P3

[13:24] multi-morphic. Jerry Stelemberg has a different approach to Pimbal. He wants to see Pimbal go in a

[13:29] different platform direction. And that destiny and that livelihood is all in Jerry's hands. Now Jerry's

[13:36] livelihood is backed up by his innovation. He made the P-Rock system and that annuity from P-Rock

[13:43] is what has given him the freedom to continue to make P3 multi-morphic all these years. And that's

[13:48] his dream. And his livelihood is in his own hands. And whether or not I love what he's doing at P3

[13:55] multi-morphic or I think it's a mistake and he should just make regular Pimbal machines and sell

[14:00] hundreds if not thousands of them. It doesn't matter what I say because he is in control of his own

[14:06] destiny. He's a grown man. He's a smart man. He's making decisions that he wants to make. Now are

[14:13] those the decisions I would make if I were running a Pimbal company? Absolutely not. And I've said

[14:18] that on my show for many many years. I would not go in that direction. I would want to give the

[14:23] market what the market wants. I wouldn't want to create a new market. Now he's trying to create a

[14:28] new market within Pimbal. And I applaud that bravery but there's a high risk there and we're seeing

[14:34] it. Like he's not selling as many games as everybody else but that's his dream and I respect his

[14:40] ability to go in that direction. Where my show gets difficult and where my show gets challenging

[14:46] is that I know that a lot of you out there want me to interview more people in the industry.

[14:52] And I had a great interview with David Fix. I had a great interview with Spooky Pimbal. And I could

[14:58] do great interviews left and right. I think nobody could interview people as good as me. And I think

[15:04] I keep it informal. I keep it casual. I keep it informative. And I try to ask the right questions.

[15:10] And I love doing it. But there's a huge problem. And this is the biggest dilemma of Canadian

[15:15] Pimbal podcast when I do interviews with manufacturers. And when I build stronger relationships with them,

[15:23] it really does make it challenging for me to give you my honest opinions about their products

[15:29] because there are times when they will release stuff and they will make decisions that I just

[15:34] don't agree with. And I want to be as honest and as articulate and as opinionated as I want to

[15:42] because in the end, in the end, that game and what they put out into the world is their product.

[15:49] This podcast and what I create and I work really hard at this podcast. This is my product.

[15:55] And so I want to ensure that my product is as good as it can be, that it's as honest as it can be,

[16:02] that it tells you exactly how I feel. And yes, there is no truth in Pimbal. All of this is subjective.

[16:08] I'm so tired of the people that indict me saying like, oh, when the truth comes out, truth comes.

[16:13] The truth is this. This is the ultimate truth. You are never going to get someone's honest opinion

[16:19] about these games if they are selling you those games. And you know that. And I don't blame them

[16:25] if I'm selling Oreo cookies and I don't like a new Oreo cookie flavor, I can't go on air and

[16:32] tell you I don't like it because I'm selling them for a living. A salesperson's job is not to give

[16:38] you an honest opinion about a product. A salesperson's job is to spin it and sell it and convince you

[16:46] that this is something you want. And the greatest salespeople, they can convince you that you want

[16:51] something that they know you don't need. And there is no greater product on planet earth that

[16:57] everybody knows we don't need than a Pimbal machine. And so Pimbal salespeople are kind of like

[17:04] sometimes the worst because they know when they call you up and they say, hey, I got this new Pimbal

[17:10] machine. Not only do you not need it, your wife doesn't need it, your kid doesn't need it,

[17:15] it is the lowest thing on a human adult's priority list that you could possibly spend this kind

[17:21] of money on. And they know that and they want to get you excited and they want to remove your money

[17:27] from your wallet. And I love Pimbal salespeople because I know what they're selling and they know

[17:33] it's fun and they know it's not necessary, but it is fun. And life is short and that's okay, but I

[17:39] don't want, I don't want my Pimbal salespeople to be reviewing the games for me because here's

[17:46] what they always do. It's always a great game. This is my favorite tactic that they do. I've only got

[17:51] one more left. Do you want it? We all know those distributors and those tactics. I've only got one

[17:56] more left. Do you want it? And then they call the next guy. I've only got one more left. Do you

[18:00] want it? And they know how to drive that FOMO. And some of my best friends in the Pimbal hobby are

[18:06] the salespeople, but there is no way they're going to be completely honest with you about these

[18:10] products. They want you to buy these things and that's okay. But my problem is is when I interview

[18:15] the manufacturers and I get them on my show, there is this pressure I feel to then hold back a little

[18:22] bit. And so I put this on to you, the listener. And I know the answer you're going to give me. Would

[18:28] you rather have me interview all of these manufacturers and then hold back how I feel about these

[18:34] products? Or would you rather me just be me and not worry about getting them on the show,

[18:39] not worry about interviewing them, not worry about that stuff. But here's where I think the middle

[18:44] ground lies. I still think the best thing for a manufacturer to do is come on this show and

[18:50] discuss their games with me and then also live up to my reviews of their products. Because I think

[18:57] it's a good thing that anyone making a Pimbal machine at a Pimbal company would say when they're

[19:04] planning a title, what would Kineha to say about this? What would Kineha to say about this design?

[19:09] What would Kineha to say about this theme? And I think if they ask that question or better yet,

[19:14] get me to sign an NDA and come in and actually give them my opinions about this stuff far before

[19:20] they make decisions they can't change. That would be beneficial to almost every single Pimbal company

[19:26] out there. There is only one Pimbal company and I mean this. There's one Pimbal company that does

[19:30] not need my help and that is Stern Pimbal. They are the most well oiled machine. They know exactly

[19:36] what they're doing. They market their products perfectly because they know that if you make the

[19:41] right marketing decisions at the very beginning of a Pimbal process which comes down to theme,

[19:47] if you nail that, if you get the theme right, you can sell almost anything and they know that and

[19:52] they do it time and time again. There is nothing I could tell Jody Dankberg and tell Zack Sharp that

[19:58] they don't already know. And George Gomez is a smarter man than me. He is a much smarter man than me.

[20:05] I've sat down at a bar and I've talked to George Gomez and I am in awe of how intelligent he is.

[20:12] And I'm not a shill for Stern Pimbal because nobody will tell you sooner than I will that Led Zeppelin

[20:18] is the most uncreative, unimaginative game I've ever seen and that Mandalorian lacks all of that

[20:24] magic and all of that world under glass that I talked about at the beginning of this show.

[20:29] And I will hold Stern Pimbal accountable for every single new game they put out there.

[20:35] But the thing about Stern Pimbal that I will always respect is they never stop giving us product.

[20:40] They always stay on schedule and so I respect that. It's almost like they're saying, look,

[20:45] we're going to come out with four to five games a year and you tell us how it is but I'll tell you

[20:50] this we're never going to stop being the greatest Pimbal manufacturer on planet earth because

[20:56] that's their livelihood. They will always have their livelihood as long as that line is moving.

[21:02] As long as the line is going and they do not have pauses, they will not interrupt their livelihoods.

[21:09] Nothing I say on this show will interrupt their livelihoods. If I rag on a Dwight Sullivan code,

[21:14] that's not going to interrupt Dwight's livelihood. He's still going to be gainfully employed at Stern Pimbal

[21:21] and everybody knows that. Now do I feel like I could give valuable advice to all the other Pimbal

[21:26] manufacturers out there? Absolutely. Some would take it, some would not but it's okay. It's okay.

[21:31] They're deciding what they want to do and what's best for their companies and I'm sitting here and

[21:36] I'm simply receiving what they do. But my ability to voice what they do and tell you without worrying

[21:44] about their livelihoods is super important to protect and here's the most important part that

[21:49] all of you can relate to. There's one person's livelihood that matters more than all of their

[21:56] livelihoods. Mine included and that is your own livelihood. It takes a really a really great

[22:04] livelihood to get to the point in life in which you can afford to buy these machines. The average,

[22:12] the average global household income around the world is less than $10,000. So all of you who are out

[22:21] there that are even listening to this, that are buying Pimbal machines on a monthly annual basis.

[22:27] You have done something right in your life. You've created a livelihood for yourselves that is put

[22:34] you in a position to even be able to spend this much money on such an unnecessary item. My show

[22:42] exists to help you out. I'm more concerned about making sure you make the right decisions with

[22:48] the livelihood that puts you in a position to buy these games because each and every one of you,

[22:53] and I mean this, I don't care how rich you are, how poor you are, you are making sacrifices when

[22:57] you buy a Pimbal machine and you could have used that money for something greater, for something better,

[23:03] for a greater good. You could have done something more with your family. You could have done

[23:08] something more for yourself. This machine and all these machines and they don't want you to know this

[23:12] because the salespeople won't tell you this. These Pimbal machines will not make your life better.

[23:19] They will not make you a better human being. They're toys. They're toys that are meant to entertain us

[23:24] and I love them and you love them. But don't fool yourself for a minute. You could take that $10,000

[23:31] and you could put it somewhere else in the world that would actually help out somebody's livelihood.

[23:37] You're not helping out people's livelihood by buying Pimbal machines. You're just not. That's okay.

[23:43] I mean this. When you ask people outside of this hobby, what they think these things cost. It's

[23:49] always alarming. Most people think a modern Pimbal machine is one to $2,000. When you tell them

[23:56] how much it costs, their eyes light up and the reason why their eyes light up is because in their

[24:02] world, in the majority of people's lives, there is no way they would spend this kind of money on

[24:08] something like this with everything they have going on, with all of their expenses, with all of their

[24:13] bills, with all of the things they want to do and just the things that they're into, they just

[24:17] could not imagine it. And that's okay. It's okay that we're in this niche little community.

[24:22] But I really take offense when people say that when I speak freely, I'm interrupting the

[24:27] livelihood. I'm putting in jeopardy the livelihood of these companies and the people who work there.

[24:33] Let's take a company like American Pimbal. You know, they're going down a road that's going to be

[24:38] challenging. They're going to make two original IP games in a row. So their livelihood is now attached

[24:45] to that decision. I did not make that decision for them. They made that decision. Their next game is

[24:52] going to be Legends of Vahala. It's confirmed. You heard it here. I have pictures. It's coming out.

[24:56] I did not make that decision. It's not on me to hold back how I feel about that decision. They made

[25:03] that decision. It wasn't Canada. And Canada should be allowed to say freely that I would not have

[25:10] made that decision. That if you want to succeed in the Pimbal marketplace, I don't think you can

[25:16] succeed with original IP games. And I have more proof and more data and more info that points

[25:24] in that direction. The most important thing and the thing that doesn't lie in life, the thing that's

[25:29] not subjective are numbers. And when you look at the numbers of what works in Pimbal, then how do you

[25:36] land at a place that we're going to make original IP games and be commercially successful? So if this

[25:41] game succeeds great, I hope it does. I hope this company succeeds and they move on. But if it fails,

[25:47] it's on them. If it succeeds, it's on them. None of it is on me. But I have the permission and the

[25:53] right to go on my airwaves and talk to each and every one of you and tell you I don't like going

[25:59] in that direction. I don't know how you convinced me to buy a game like Legends of Vahala next to games

[26:06] Guns and Roses and Godzilla and Ultraman and Batman and Jurassic Park as a salesperson. And this

[26:13] is the most important thing as a salesperson. I need to be able to entice you to buy this. And that

[26:20] is why Stern is so smart. They don't even have to do that because they've picked themes that

[26:25] already have millions of fans that will jump at it regardless almost of what's in the game. Hence

[26:31] Mandalorian sales are great. Hence Ghostbusters sales were great. Here's the thing and I want to

[26:36] speak directly to everybody who works at a pinball company whose livelihood is associated with a

[26:41] pinball machine. If you work at a pinball company and your livelihood has to do with a pinball

[26:47] product, it is in your hands. It is your destiny. If it's your livelihood, if I were in your shoes,

[26:53] and I'm going to tell you this, I'm just going to be completely frank. If I was in your shoes and

[26:58] my livelihood was making pinball machines, I would make sure that I didn't go to bed at night

[27:05] until my machines were perfect. Until every single detail was right. Until I landed on a theme,

[27:12] I knew people would want. I would not be able to sleep at night knowing that I was about to put

[27:18] an eight to ten thousand dollar product into the world and I would not have hedge multi-bought.

[27:24] I would not have monitors that are all washed out. I wouldn't have playfields that are pooling

[27:28] and chipping. This is your livelihood. This is your craft. You are asking a lot of all of our

[27:36] livelihoods. We have to make so much money and our livelihoods have to be incredible to support

[27:41] your industry that's not needed in the world. And so if I were in your shoes, I would make sure I

[27:47] got it a hundred percent right. And I don't see that. And I think there's way too many apologists. I

[27:53] think there's way too many people making excuses and I think all of the excuses land in the same

[27:58] place. Well, if it's fun, it's okay. No, the real world doesn't work like that. When I come up with

[28:03] an idea and I have to go in and talk to a client about a marketing idea, I need to make sure I nail it.

[28:09] I need to make sure everything is thought through that I think about all the tough questions. I think

[28:14] if someone's playing devil's advocate, how would they pull my idea apart? And I need to go through

[28:20] all of that and make sure I get it right. And the moment I present, I need to make sure I got

[28:25] all of it right. A client's not going to go to me, oh, Chris, you made the meeting really fun,

[28:30] which I always do. They're not going to say, oh, yeah, you presented it really fun, but it's all wrong.

[28:35] Then I fail. And I think that's some of the problem with pinball. Everything just gets generalized.

[28:40] Like if it's fun, then who cares what the price is? If it's fun, then who cares if the posts are

[28:44] chipping? If it's fun, who cares if the LCD doesn't have pure blacks? If it's fun, then who cares if

[28:50] it's hedge multi-ball? If it's fun, then who cares if it's legends of Vahala? But the truth is,

[28:54] and each of you know this. And this is why you listen to Canadian pinball podcasts. Deep down inside

[29:00] your gut, all of the stuff that doesn't feel right, that's just not sitting right, you feel it,

[29:06] you sense it, you know it. And doing this show now, and now that I have over 200 supporters on

[29:12] Patreon, this is now a little micro livelihood for me. And the more it becomes part of my livelihood,

[29:18] and you guys are investing in me. And I mean this, you're not just investing your time now.

[29:23] You're investing some money in me. And I feel a really strong obligation to continue to make this

[29:29] product better for you. And I know that my product is better for you when I don't hold back,

[29:35] when I don't cut corners, when I don't sugarcoat it because I want to get someone on my show.

[29:40] Because I'm here helping service your livelihood by keeping these companies honest,

[29:46] by holding them accountable for products. I just want games to come out that are like Godzilla.

[29:53] And I looked at Godzilla yesterday, and I looked at that incredible building mech that they created.

[29:58] And I looked at the game on the line, this is what we want. We want themes that are fun. We want

[30:04] colorful, vibrant worlds under glass. We want mechanisms that show they work hard at it. We want

[30:10] a game that shoots well. We want all the theme integrated onto the screen and the sounds.

[30:15] Godzilla to me, and I mean this Godzilla to me is shaping up to be possibly the best stern

[30:22] machine ever. And I love seeing it. And every day I see more Godzilla, I get more and more happy,

[30:29] and I can't wait to get my LE. And I want that. I want a game that makes me want to do a podcast

[30:35] where I just gush about it for an hour. I don't want to do a show in which I'm complaining about

[30:41] a crappy theme. I don't want to do shows in which I'm complaining about play fields. But

[30:46] if play field issues do happen, I'm not going to sit by and watch a company send you product

[30:53] for $10,500 with crappy play fields. And every other single pinball podcast out there says nothing

[31:01] about it because they want to be friends with the company. And I'm not going to be threatened by

[31:05] the pinball company that's saying I'm attacking them because I'm holding them accountable for their

[31:10] own product and their own products quality. Why would you want to live in a world in which nobody

[31:16] says, Hey, something's wrong here. Let's fix it. And here's the good news. All of this can be fixed.

[31:22] But it will never be fixed. And these games will never get better. And you will never get more

[31:28] for your money if everybody just shuts up and sings kumbaya with these manufacturers. And everybody

[31:34] should be looking at Godzilla now. Everybody and saying we need more of this. We need more of

[31:40] this. We need more magic like guns and roses with good play fields. Jersey Jack, are you listening

[31:46] to me? Your game is 90% there. If you fix your play fields and maybe make your games a little bit

[31:54] less complex, I got to be honest, I don't need 22 patches, Keith. What are you doing there?

[32:00] Just make it less complex and make the play fields bulletproof. And then you've done it, JJP.

[32:06] Then you're making a product through and through that I think will appeal to everybody. But nobody

[32:11] wants a product that has quality issues in any industry. Nobody would you ever buy a product from

[32:16] anyone who's like, Yeah, this is great. But there is a quality issue. You'd be like, whoa, wait a

[32:21] minute. What? What? I'm concerned. This is how I feel. And for all of you who support

[32:25] Canada's pinball podcast, I really appreciate it. For all of you who don't support the show. And I

[32:29] mean that for all of you who don't subscribe and do anything for the show, here's what I want you

[32:33] to do. I want you to go look at how much all the Twitch streamers make. Okay. How much? And I have

[32:38] just 200. I have like 203 out of 3000 listeners, just 203 who actually say, you know what? Like every

[32:46] month will click five hours for you because you're saying something that needs to be said. This

[32:51] shows not even worth five bucks to thousands of people who listen to this show on a monthly basis.

[32:57] And these are the same people that are spending thousands of dollars on topers and hundreds of

[33:02] dollars for like art blades. And I'm just here to tell you whatever. It's your money. But I'm just

[33:07] saying, I wish there were more shows like this talking about pinball, talking about everything I

[33:11] love movies, cars, food, whatever it would be. I wish there were more shows like this. So if you

[33:16] do want to contribute and maybe I did control you and sort of shame you into contributing, I don't

[33:21] even care. Just go to Patreon, Canadian pinball and show your support because the other side that

[33:26] none of you see is this the overwhelming. And I mean, it's the overwhelming pressure by the

[33:32] industry and my peers in the content creation world, the overwhelming pressure is for me to go away.

[33:39] Is for me to shut up is for me to be canceled. And you see it. They want to say I'm a hypocrite.

[33:46] They want to say this. They want to say that what they don't want to do. They don't want to have

[33:50] me on their shows to ever talk about this stuff because they're because they're friends with all

[33:55] the manufacturers or they're selling you stuff or they're going to be a voice in a game, right?

[34:00] I mean, Jeff T. Oles is Odin in Legends of Vahala. Is he going to give you an honest review of

[34:05] Legends of Vahala? He's in the game. He's in the game. And I get it. Like Jeff's got a great voice.

[34:10] He should be in these games. But there's just a conflict. There's a conflict. There's just nobody

[34:16] else is holding these companies accountable. Show me who's doing it. Show me who's doing it. I get there

[34:21] are great shows about history. There are great streams about gameplay. There's great conversation

[34:26] happening. But there should be more. There just should be more people saying for this much money,

[34:34] we deserve this. That is not a really difficult thing. It's when this hobby gets interesting.

[34:41] And when I say this, I mean games that play well, shoot well, everything. I haven't had much sleep

[34:47] people. I haven't had much sleep. It's been a really rough couple of weeks. You know, being a new

[34:51] dad has been really difficult for me. And as I'm looking at the costs of daycare and the cost of a

[34:57] home and the cost of keeping all of this afloat, it makes me look at Pimbal differently. I'm still

[35:03] excited. I still want to do shows as much as I can. I mean, it is now 7.18 in the morning. And in

[35:09] less than three hours, I'm going to do an hour and a half Saturday morning spectacular for all of

[35:14] you that you will enjoy. And so I really do appreciate all the support and all of you out there who

[35:19] understand how much time I'm sacrificing out of my livelihood to get you entertaining Pimbal stuff.

[35:26] But I don't normally do shows like this. And I'm probably going to take a little bit of a week or

[35:31] two break because I just need it. I just need it. But there's so much happening between now and

[35:35] expo that I'm probably going to take that break after expo. I will be at expo. I look forward to going

[35:43] there. I look forward to hanging out with all of you. And I look forward to playing games and

[35:48] having great conversations to all the Pimbal manufacturers out there. Your livelihood is in your

[35:54] hands. Every decision you make is yours. For those of you who are buying Pimbal machines, you should

[36:00] be very thankful you have a livelihood that puts you in a position to buy these machines. I will

[36:05] look out for your livelihood over the livelihood of the companies. I am more focused on the customer

[36:12] than the companies. That is where my allegiance lies. And nothing that I say, nothing I say will ever

[36:20] change the fact that those manufacturers can control the product more than I can. And for those

[36:26] who are selling and distributing Pimbal machines, I know that's your livelihood. And you are probably

[36:31] having some of the best couple of years you've ever had in your livelihood, except for the fact

[36:36] that there's not a lot of product being made. But man, is this hobby growing? And I firmly believe that

[36:43] this hobby will continue to grow. And I firmly believe that shows like mine keep it entertaining

[36:49] on a weekly basis. And yes, I do think that if we lost Canadian Pimbal podcasts, it wouldn't be

[36:55] nearly as much fun to follow what's going on in the Pimbal world on a weekly basis. I happily

[37:01] make this content for all of you. It brings me great joy. And this is a little slice of my livelihood.

[37:07] And now that I do have all of these contributors and the more contributors I make, I promise you this.

[37:12] It is my promise to you. If you donate to this show, I'm going to work extra hard at making this show

[37:18] even better, getting you scoops, getting you rumors, but staying honest because man, you don't understand

[37:26] the pressure I feel and the sleepless nights I have, when I know that once I say this, it's going

[37:32] to be perceived that I'm hurting the livelihood of a manufacturer that's bogus. Only they can hurt

[37:39] themselves by the decisions they make with their games. Everybody have an amazing day. Let's do this.

[37:45] Let's all not think about Pimbal for a day, but I hope you enjoyed this episode. This world's

[37:49] humblest yet best Pimbal podcast on planet earth. We'll talk to you soon later.
