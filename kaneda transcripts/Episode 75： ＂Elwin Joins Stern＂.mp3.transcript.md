[00:00] Here!

[00:02] Ha ha ha ha ha!

[00:04] Yeah!

[00:06] Yeah!

[00:08] It's Friday Friday!

[00:11] Gotta get down on Friday!

[00:13] Everybody's looking forward to the weekend!

[00:17] Yes!

[00:24] Happy Friday the 13th to all you pinball fanatics out there in the world!

[00:29] It's a beautiful, beautiful day in New York City.

[00:32] We actually had some unseasonably warm weather the past couple of days.

[00:36] It was 60 degrees last night.

[00:38] I was literally walking around with just a t-shirt on.

[00:41] But you know what?

[00:43] Last night sucked because I lost my wallet.

[00:46] Oh!

[00:47] Have any of you ever lost a wallet?

[00:49] It's so frustrating.

[00:51] I got out of the cab.

[00:52] It was taken Brenda out for a nice date night dinner.

[00:55] I paid for the cab with my credit card and I had my wallet.

[00:58] And then we walked from one restaurant to another and I wanted to pay for drinks.

[01:03] And nothing.

[01:04] All gone.

[01:05] I have no idea.

[01:06] Canceled everything.

[01:07] Got new credit card and license coming.

[01:09] But that's not going to deter us from having a super upbeat little version of Friday special Canadian pinball podcast.

[01:16] So we're going to talk about a little news going on in the hobby that's happened recently.

[01:20] And then I'm going to read a couple comments from listeners of the show who actually wrote in.

[01:25] I love it.

[01:26] I get 500 plus listens in episode.

[01:29] I ask people to write in and I get like three or four.

[01:31] I hopefully more and more view chime in because you'll hear me read your comments out on the air.

[01:37] And that is always exciting.

[01:38] I always would love it when I would listen to Nate's podcast or other podcasts and they would give shout outs to different listeners.

[01:44] And every once in a while,

[01:46] Nate would get a shout out normally for being such a loser in the hobby.

[01:50] But let's talk about some of the news that's happening this week in the pinball world.

[01:56] So number one is Keith L. Wynn is joining Stern pinball.

[02:02] And I had some people write into me and say, hey, how come you didn't cover this?

[02:06] And I look, I try to read as much as I can on pinside that I don't catch everything in real time.

[02:11] But for those of you out there,

[02:13] Keith L. Wynn is joining Stern pinball as a designer.

[02:17] And what are my thoughts on this?

[02:19] First of all, I think it's great.

[02:21] I think it is great whenever more people come into the pinball designing world.

[02:27] I don't think pinball should always be the same few designers doing everything all the time.

[02:32] I think that's why we get a lot of cookie cutter designs when it comes to Stern pinball machines.

[02:38] No one seems to really be taking much risk.

[02:41] No one seems to be pushing the envelope over at Stern.

[02:44] So for Keith L. Wynn to join Stern as a new designer, that's exciting.

[02:50] That's good news. I think we all want to see more designers.

[02:53] I would also love to see more young designers come into the hobby who approach making pinball differently.

[03:02] Whenever I look at the Zen pinball out there and all the different digital pinballs that are available,

[03:08] Zen pinball machines are designed so incredible.

[03:13] I know it's digital, but can more of that sort of creativity find its way into physical machines?

[03:21] And Keith is well known for his archer pinball machine.

[03:26] When you read the conversation about Keith joining Stern pinball,

[03:30] a lot of people are speculating on whether or not archer will become a Stern pinball title.

[03:35] What are my thoughts on that?

[03:38] I don't know the show.

[03:40] I don't watch the show. I know of the show.

[03:42] I have some friends who watch archer and they love it.

[03:45] They swear by it. I get it. It's funny.

[03:48] But it's not mainstream.

[03:50] It's a niche sort of cult following type of show.

[03:54] It's not like the Simpsons. It's not like family guy.

[03:57] It doesn't have that sort of legion and army of followers that watch it to make it mainstream.

[04:04] So that being said, do I think an archer pinball machine would be cool?

[04:11] Yes. Do I think it would sell? No.

[04:13] Do I think Stern will make it? I don't think so.

[04:17] I don't think it'll be a big seller.

[04:19] I wanted to because it's already designed, make something like only 500 archer pinball machines,

[04:25] then I could see them doing something like that, a little bit of a woe nelly thing with it,

[04:29] where you just make a limited number.

[04:31] I don't think, I don't know how expensive the license would be.

[04:35] It might not be that expensive of a license because it's not that big of a property.

[04:40] So it could be cool. What I don't want to see happen is this.

[04:44] I don't want to see Keith Ellens archer game re-themed into something else.

[04:51] I hear people saying that, like the layout is done, the design is done,

[04:55] and it's a great layout, so you could always use it for something else.

[04:58] I think that is the worst idea ever, and I'll explain why.

[05:03] I think a design of a machine, a layout of a machine, should happen after the theme is decided upon

[05:12] because wouldn't you want to design it to match the theme versus retrofitting a theme onto a design?

[05:20] I just think it's silly, silly, and a terrible idea.

[05:23] So I don't want to see Keith Ellens archer re-skinned into anything else.

[05:30] I think he designed it as archer, and if they make it, make it as archer.

[05:35] Look, he's joining Stern.

[05:37] He's joining a company that has tons of resources, tons of help, tons of other creative people on board,

[05:43] and I'm excited because I think that he's going to do some fun stuff with Stern.

[05:47] We probably won't see anything that he works on until 2018, 2019, right?

[05:56] So there's some time to go because we know that Stern has a lot of stuff already in motion,

[06:03] especially over the next couple of years.

[06:06] So good news. We wish Keith the best.

[06:09] I reached out to Keith and asked him if he wanted to come on the show, hit him up on Facebook,

[06:14] haven't heard back yet. If you know Keith, then you listen to this show and your fan of Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[06:20] Maybe give him a note. He's really, hey, go on and talk to Canada.

[06:24] That being said, I reached out to George Gomez, and we are going to schedule a podcast over the next couple of weeks.

[06:31] So that is exciting. I really look forward to talking to George.

[06:35] There's so much going on that I want to pick his brain about.

[06:39] Speaking of George Gomez, the other news that happened just yesterday was Batman 66 code came out.

[06:46] Just a code update, right? I think it's .65. I want to say it is. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right.

[06:52] I don't want to go through, you know, I always hate it when people read all the code updates on a podcast.

[06:57] But, you know, it's exciting to see more and more of this game come together.

[07:02] The code update was for the Ellie S.L.E. owners. I think I read somewhere that premium owners are trying to install the code,

[07:10] and it's not working correctly. Well, duh. It's probably designed to sync up with some of the items that are on the Ellie and S.L.E.

[07:19] I think primarily the topr. I think the topr interaction is going to be coded into the game.

[07:24] So if you try to install that with a premium, it's not going to work properly for you.

[07:28] So, code update came out, right? And I think, look, everyone needs to just get off of Stern's back when it comes to code updates,

[07:37] especially a machine that has Lyman working on it. We know that this machine is going to be polished.

[07:43] He is going to do all he can do to make Batman 66 as great as it can be.

[07:48] I have to say, when people uploaded some of the pictures of the Batman 66 topper with the bat signal, it looks really cool.

[07:57] It's amazing how I think the topper with that signal, it's those little details that really make the game special.

[08:04] I still do not, and I cannot say that I think that machine looks like it's $15,000.

[08:11] But, you know, as we've said before, people are happy. I'm happy for you. It's a lot of coin.

[08:16] I think when you look at that machine in a vacuum, like if you just look at it, and you could tell someone,

[08:21] hey, this is $15,000. In a world where alligator pocketbooks cost $15,000. In a world where carbon fiber ceramic breaks cost $15,000.

[08:32] There's so many things that if you compare to contrast, you could see why that might be worth $15,000.

[08:39] But, when you put Batman super-eally next to other pinball machines, it just doesn't seem like it's worth that much money.

[08:47] I mean, when I was at Expo, just seeing it exodiled in, and it was, you know, no way, no way.

[08:53] But, again, happy people are happy, glad the games are going out. And look, we haven't heard any play field issues.

[08:59] And I think this is a good thing. People haven't been complaining about ghosted inserts. They haven't been complaining about cracked clear code.

[09:08] Which leads me to my next topic, which I've seen a lot of, and we mentioned his name on the last podcast.

[09:14] But that is there is a petition on Pinside to get Stern to fix the play field issues with ghostbusters, and no other than KPG posted the petition.

[09:27] And, you know, look, here's a thing about this whole thing. And we talked about it, but I think that KPG shot himself in the foot a little bit.

[09:38] He went off on his own tirade and his rants against Stern consistently. I'm not sure where the relationship broke down with him and Gary Stern.

[09:46] Is it because he went on Pinside and constantly said how unhappy he was, and didn't give Stern a chance to solve the issue?

[09:55] Because he was talking to Gary. So I am, I would love to hear from KPG.

[10:01] At what point did Stern just cut off communication with you and did they say something to you?

[10:06] I really think his constant moaning and groaning on Pinside is what led Stern to sort of blacklist him.

[10:14] And we know Stern has a history of blacklisting people kicking people off of their Facebook page when they hear things they don't want to hear.

[10:23] And I've been thinking a lot about this whole situation, and I said like, you know, maybe I would even do the same thing to KPG.

[10:29] But the more I think about it, the more I read through the thread, the more I see people chiming in, you can't come to any other conclusion then.

[10:40] Stern needs to get people new playfields if they had really bad issues.

[10:48] Look, this is because it's not personal. It's professional, and it's the objective right thing to do.

[10:56] You know, KPG, I wouldn't have gone about it the way you did, but you still bought a Stern product. It was still brand new.

[11:02] And while you had it over the first few months, conditions happened to the machine that should not have happened, right?

[11:10] Problems occurred that should not have occurred. And you deserve a new playfield, and you deserve it.

[11:16] Because you paid $8,000 of your hard earned money for a product, and the company should stand behind it.

[11:21] A company shouldn't be allowed to deny people repairs because of how they personally feel about that individual.

[11:30] You know, I buy a car, and it's warranty. And if I go out, and my Hellcat Supercharger blows up, and I've been reading a lot about a lot of recent issues with some people's superchargers, it doesn't matter if I have a wallet,

[11:43] and I'm like loud spoken, and I'm on the Hellcat forum, complaining, and bitching and moaning, that I just spend all this money in my Hellcats in the shop, and I want my money back.

[11:53] It doesn't matter. I'm only acting that way. KPG is only acting out because he got a defective product.

[12:03] So you can't, even if he is being a jerk, and being unreasonable, you can't blacklist him from his repair. You've got to do the right thing.

[12:13] And there's other people, other than KPG, who have had issues.

[12:17] I know it's a little bit of a nightmare scenario, and I said this. I think it's also, it's probably hard for Stern to tell what's actual wear, and some people might be sabotaging their machines a little bit.

[12:28] I don't approve of that, but if some people have some ghosted inserts, I could see some of those people chipping off some of the Playfield 2 to try and get a whole new one.

[12:36] Here's the thing about ghosted inserts, and we've talked about this before. Almost every machine sometimes develops a little bit of ghosting.

[12:43] A little bit of ghosting is not a big deal. I have a tiny bit of ghosting on a few inserts, on a $1,000 CPR gold Toten Playfield.

[12:54] So it doesn't bother me. It's not lifting up the insert. Yes, we've seen some of the ghost busters that have really bad ghosting, and the inserts are lifting, and the clear code is cracking, and Stern needs to replace those.

[13:08] And I hope the petition is successful. I hope it doesn't go to like lawsuit territory. I just hope Stern does what they say they're going to do.

[13:16] I know they did it for some people. We saw some people's mail in their Playfield and get new ones back. So I think it's time for Stern to just put this chapter behind them.

[13:24] They've clearly figured out the issue with the Playfield problems, and Stern needs to make right here, because Stern knows that they shipped Playfields before they had the problem fixed. They know they did that.

[13:38] And as much as I love Stern, I don't I hate that they did that. They knew that it was a ticking time bomb. There was going to be the equivalent of a red ring of death for some ghost busters owners.

[13:50] And it sucks that it was the Ellie people they bought the most of Stern, make right on KPG and the others. And let's put this chapter behind us and move into the LCD error with good Playfields and new machines and not look back.

[14:04] All right, what else is going on? Let's get to the consumer feedback that I got. I want to read what some of you sent me. And we'll go from there.

[14:15] So I want to read a comment from Joe Perino. Joe, thank you for listening to the Canadian Pinball Podcast. He says, hey, Canada, love the show.

[14:25] You are out of doubt the most interesting pinball podcast out there. Well, thank you, Joe. I appreciate that. That said, your heart on JJP.

[14:36] It seems like your biggest problem with them is the fact that Jack redesigns or makes numerous LEDs to make money. But when Stern has a $15,000 machine, which is supposed to be a thank you to the loyal customers by price gouging them, that's nowhere near the price range or worth.

[14:54] You say everyone needs to stop being but hurt, then say that Stern is a business and that you're just trying to make money.

[15:01] Okay, and I'm just reading, you know, like not every email is like grammatically perfect. So he's basically saying, you know, I've been hard on JJP and I haven't been as hard on Stern, even though they're fleeting people with the Batman SLE.

[15:15] All right, he then goes on to say, I know JJP makes a lot of mistakes when it comes to deadlines and stuff like that. But from a guy who's new to the hobby, it seems like Stern is rude to the customers and what they did to that guy at Expo from Pinball News is messed up just like how pin sight kicking you off for having critical opinions is messed up.

[15:38] How the hell cat, wait, how the, all right, talks about cars and whatnot and how he loved to see a JAWS machine and keep up the great work.

[15:48] All right, well, Joe, thank you for reaching out. And here's the thing, I am hard on JJP and the collectors edition versus Stern and the SLE.

[16:00] Look, do I think Stern should not have increased the SLE number from 30 to 80? Yeah, I think that was a shitty move. But again, like it's hard for me to say like, damn you because who is really, is anyone really unhappy?

[16:15] More people got the machine. They order sold out like that. They had 400 applications to buy an SLE.

[16:24] 400, think about that for a minute, at $15,000, 400 people wanted an SLE. Stern could have said, hey, we said we're going to make 30, but so many of you want it, we're actually going to make all the orders, all the applications that we got, we're going to give everyone one.

[16:42] Like that to me would have been fleecing the market. Not sure, no, not everyone would have stayed in because it would not have been nearly as rare.

[16:49] But they could easily have made 150 SLEs and sold every single one without a doubt, without a doubt. But what JJP was different, you know, Stern said a number, they then increased it, but then that was it. They didn't keep increasing it as they got more inquiries.

[17:06] And they also, like, they at least said a number at the beginning, right? What JJP did in terms of saying, we're not going to say how many we're going to build, we're going to only build as many orders as we get, and then not come out after New Year's, not lock the order banks, like he said he was, and then wait a week, and then come out with an arbitrary number like 150.

[17:28] Again, like, I don't know, I just think Jack has reputation for doing these things, and I think it's getting to the point where nobody trusts him. They don't trust him because of stuff like this.

[17:38] It's not that we don't, you know, I don't really like trust Gary Stern either, but I do trust when Stern sets a number, they will only make that number. I also trust that when Stern says this is, they're only making 240 Batman limited editions, they're only going to make 240 Batman limited editions.

[17:54] There won't be another run of a different type of edition Batman coming out. There won't be, there won't be another type of edition of Ghostbusters coming out. Not for years, maybe 10 years down the road that might vault edition the thing again.

[18:08] But what Jack has done time and time again is during a game's model run, just introduce a new edition as another limited edition, and it screws over all the people who went in on the original limited editions.

[18:21] Now, I would also argue that Jack's never really had a limited edition. You make 1,000 or 1,500 wasm, or Ruby Reds, that's not limited. It's silly that he just puts those words on machines that he makes over 1,000 of.

[18:35] You know, so it is what it is. It is what it is. Like, I don't think 150 dialed in collectors editions have been sold. If 150 have been, and those people really want it, then God bless them. Good, they get the game they want.

[18:49] But I just think that it's absolutely apples to oranges comparing what Stern is doing to what J.J.P. is doing. And I think Stern does it better. I just do.

[18:58] Stern God in trouble that time, remember when they made the, what was it, walking dead, when they said there was only going to be an Ellie in a pro, right? And there was not going to be a premium. And everyone went in on the Ellie, sold out, sold out, right?

[19:11] And then there he is the premium. They haven't done that since. They learned the lesson. That was a crappy move. But I think Jack does that all the time. I bet you. I bet you. You are going to see another edition of dialed in eventually down the road.

[19:27] To drum up more interest in sales and hype. So look, if Jack does that, he's going to do that from the Gecko people would never problem. So Joe, thank you for the note. Thank you for listening to the show. And I do, like everyone else, hopes that Jaws comes out one day.

[19:45] All right. So I want to do a shout out to another Joe of the show. Joe Zankus. I think that's how you pronounce it. He writes, you are a douche, the end dot dot dot just kidding. Okay. Thank you. Joe. Come on. I think, I think most people would consider me a douche and a hobby. All right. So here's what Joe writes. He said, yes, Stern is shipping.

[20:09] They have an, they have to in order to keep the factory workers busy. Doesn't mean they are doing a good job. They've replaced like three ghosted playfields since the promise, since they promised to so in November.

[20:22] That thread is collecting signatures. Batman toppers are going out with upside down logos. Node boards failing already. Spike two was supposed to fix this. It didn't.

[20:34] So that's what he says about Stern. I'm going to tackle what he says about each as he goes. Okay. So yes, Joe. I don't know. I don't think Stern is doing a bad job lately. I think a few people have issues.

[20:47] And Stern, yes, is fumbling, handling some of those issues. But it's just a few people. It's not everybody. Sometimes, Pinside makes issues seem like they are affecting everyone.

[20:59] Sometimes, Pinside makes it seem like the sky is falling and everything is horrible. And Stern is just effing everyone over. That is not true.

[21:08] Hundreds of machines are going out to happy customers all the time from Stern factory. And yes, they have to keep the line going. Right. I...

[21:19] What's the alternative? The alternative to being Stern is being everybody else. And everybody else doesn't have the line constantly going. Everyone else makes this wait years for a new machine. Everyone else is in jeopardy of closing at some point because they have so many days where machines are not going out.

[21:40] It's a business, Joe. It's a business. Stern is doing what they need to do to stay in business. Now, that does not excuse sending out a Batman topper with an upside down logo. That is inexcusable.

[21:54] And at some point, when toppers are going out, knowing they're going out to Ellie and SLE owners, right. So there's only... There's only in grand total, 300 and 20 toppers being made.

[22:09] And especially since they're going out to SLE owners first, yes, you would think they would be on a table and some quality control person who knows what the Batman logo is supposed to be would look at each one and say, that's good to go. That's good to go.

[22:24] Yeah, I've had an issue in the past. Stuff clearly leaves their factory. Like, remember the rails on Ghostbusters where they were sending the wrong rails, like one on each side was different. The Lollipop rails didn't match up for people. They were the wrong ones.

[22:38] Yeah, that's just inexcusable. But they'll fix it. They'll fix that person's topper. At least there's something to fix. Everyone else doesn't ship anything. Wait, you wait months, you wait years. I'd rather have a game with some problems than no game at all.

[22:53] He goes on to say, highway. He says, I don't get it either. Whoever is working on Alien isn't doing a good job. I really want this company to succeed though. I agree. I agree. Where are the updates on Highway Pimball? Andrew Highway said, he said the second week in January, this is his words, we'd start shipping, I think 20 games. So that's Monday. The 16th is the day he called out when 20 games would go out. So I don't know.

[23:22] I hope so. I really do. I know that Andrew and Orrick and team over there, they want the game out. Nobody wants it out more than them. I still am head scratching as to why we can't see the early artwork. And yes, I don't think they're doing, it's like, I don't think they're doing a good job in terms of getting the game out. I think everyone would agree on that.

[23:44] I'm going to wait to play the game before I make a real assessment of it. We've talked about the other parts of the game at Nazim. Is it a Nazia? I mean, rare here. Always keeps me honest whenever I say that for a hit.

[23:57] But let's see what happens. I think Monday's next week is going to be an interesting week for highway. If nothing goes out, if we don't see the early art, I think people are going to be banging at the door again, being like, Andrew, another one of your dates you didn't hit.

[24:11] Be honest. Tell us what's going on. Share with us something. All right. He writes next thing. Joe goes on to Dutch Pimball. And this is great. Guys, when you, when you email me, it's great if you break it up into manufacturer. He writes Dutch Pimball. In fairness, they did revamp a ton of boards in the past two years. And of course, had to redo the songs.

[24:31] How they haven't fixed their issues yet, car and bowling mechanism still freezing up is beyond me. Yeah, look, look, Dutch to me. I don't want to talk about Dutch much. I don't talk about Dutch much on this show because I think Dutch has been a big letdown.

[24:45] I think they took two years to perfect the machine. And then it wasn't perfect. It wasn't even close to perfect. People are having a lot of issues. And there's not a lot of them out there. And there are a lot of issues. And that, to me, is the most like worry something. It's almost like every machine is having some issue. Maybe not all of them. But it's not a good percentage right now for them in terms of quality.

[25:12] And if you're going to take two years to say you're making the machine better, then make it better. Then it better not have problems. Not for 10 grand. Not for 10 grand. I think the Lebowski owners are happy though. I think these guys realize they went in on a brand new machine from a new company. And, and they're living with it. This is what happens when you buy game number one, you live with issues. Talk to a was owner.

[25:39] There weren't that many issues on full throttle. But talk to other people who got game number one from a manufacturer. It's never a smooth sailing. So I hope people just get their Dutch machines soon.

[25:53] Home pin, he writes, Joe wrote, not a fair company to bring up. His wife passed away, which froze accounts. And then he had that worker that died and had to pay out money. Plus he's building a company from scratch while also building every component from scratch.

[26:11] When he finally does ramp up, he's going to be able to build pinball cheaper than every company out there. At least he's posting photos of updates in the factory.

[26:20] Well, look, I mean, Joe, I've brought up home pin. And I brought them up on my prediction show. But I haven't really, I haven't really slandered home pin. I think they have a difficult road ahead building an entire company from the ground up.

[26:37] I think it's a, that is the, that is the most ambitious pinball project happening by far. Every screw, every bolt, every mechanism, every coil, they're making every flipper. He's not going to vendors. He's not piecing together stuff that's already available.

[26:54] The most ambitious undertaking in China, halfway across the world. I mean, look, I think like the rest of, I'm rooting for him to make it. But I still, I can still say that I think Thunderbirds is a terrible theme. Why would you do that? That's the thing that boggles my mind. Why would you go through all the trouble, all the trouble of building a company from the ground up?

[27:20] Right? So you're doing everything that a company needs to do to become a legitimate company. But the one thing you don't do, the one thing you don't do, is market research. If you're really going to build a business, your first title needs to be a hit.

[27:36] I mean, how, how people don't get that is beyond me. There is a reason why we don't have alien pinball machine right now. It's because full throttle wasn't a hit.

[27:45] And money didn't come in and they haven't sold many. And because they haven't sold many, all of the costs that Andrew is incurring in terms of wages and rent and materials and vendors and programmers.

[27:59] He doesn't have a big pool of money to work with now because the first title didn't sell. So when I look at home pin and I look at Thunderbirds as the inaugural title to kick off this company, you've done all this work.

[28:13] Don't you need your first game to be hit? Nintendo entertainment system was a hit. Sega's first system was a hit. Microsoft's Xbox was a hit. But what drove those systems wasn't just Xbox. It was at Halo, the game was a hit.

[28:34] Mario Brothers, the first one, Super Mario Brothers, was a hit. So if you consider the video game councils to be platforms, then your first game needs to be a hit. And so look, why Thunderbirds? Why? Why? And I'll tell you why. It's because Mike is from a land and was Australia. They love the, they love Thunderbirds. So he's doing it because he personally loves the theme.

[29:03] And that's the mistake that people make. It's not just what you want. You need to make a title that people want. Right. Full throttle isn't a title. Anybody wants and we know this because nobody wanted it. But Andrew wanted to make it. Like on some level, you get to pick what are we going to make next? What are we going to make next?

[29:28] And look, they, they clearly should have just made alien first. They're spending the money for the alien license. Why don't they just do that up front when he had all the investor money? When he had all more money, Andrew had more money when he was making full throttle. Then he has now when he's making alien, which means full throttle might even be a better built machine. And that's, that's just what it just boggles my mind. Why you lead with a title that's not going to be popular. We saw what happened to highway with it.

[29:57] We saw what happened. And I think the same thing is going to happen to home pin. They're going to struggle to sell it. You know, like Wizard of Oz, not the greatest theme. But one of the, for pinball, right, if you look at the demo for pinball, but one of the greatest properties of all time, it's a classic.

[30:14] You know, Jack's not, you don't have to explain to people what Wizard of Oz is. So look, that's my hardest thing about home pin is I just think the theme is doesn't, all the work warrants a better theme. Let's hope pin two is something that people really want. All right.

[30:31] Next he says, pinball circus in fairness is in a company. They're like too hobby is putting these things together. It's barely even a boutique builder. Yeah, I get it. I really do.

[30:44] But it's been two years. Where is it? Hopefully it's out soon. I'm not like I'm not mad. I'm not like upset that it's taking pinball circus. You know, a couple years. What I'm doing, Joe and listener of the show is I'm just making an observation that it always takes these come up.

[31:01] And he's so long to get things together and get things out. And that again, with all these things, this is why I think we have to give stern credit because everybody else typically fails to deliver in any timely fashion.

[31:16] He then goes on to write about spooky why no mention of them. He's consistently shipping like eight to 10 pins a week in a space that's one 30th the size of stern. He's building both Rob Zombie and Domino's and he's going to announce another title of T.P.F.

[31:32] which will likely go into production in less than a month after announcement. I never seen a thread where a quality issue wasn't resolved with spooky. So I look, Joe, I mean, have you listened to the podcast, Joe?

[31:46] I talk about spooky all the time. I talk about spooky all the time. I don't, you know, I don't harp on any spooky issues because they don't really have any quality issues. I love the team over there. I think there were some of the nicest people on pinball. And as I've said, I'm just not excited by spooky's first two titles. I'm not excited by Domino's.

[32:09] I'm not, I'm not going to lie. I want to see spooky push the envelope and go further. I know they're coming out with a Jetson's pinball machine that's going to be very bare bones. It's not going to be, it was a commission game to be made for them. And it's, it's going to be more like a woe nelly kind of thing. Very, very bare bones game.

[32:29] Spooky 3, the one that him Charlie and Ben are making. Yeah, I'm interested to see what's going on. I saw Ben put up a photo of I think like a lower play field. That could be really fun to think about that. It was either a lower and upper play field. I think it was a lower play field.

[32:43] But look, spooky needs to now advance. And I'm rooting for them to do it. I think they do deserve credit. I've said it before a year from now. I think you might only see spooky JJP and, and, and, and stern. Right. There might only be three players left in the game. I might be wrong. I might be right.

[33:10] But I don't think I'm going to be right on that because I'll tell you why American pinball is for real and things are happening over there. And I can't say much, but things are really happening and things are looking really, really, I mean, I'm excited. I'm excited to see with Balser and, and Josh, Googler can do with, with Houdini. I'm excited to see what they show at T.P.F. I think it's going to be an exciting Texas pinball festival.

[33:39] I am looking at booking a trip out there. I need it. You know, I, I, the hotel's booked out, but I was talking to Ed and he said the hotel across the street is, is, is even nicer. And I should stay there. T.P.F. is amazing. For those of you who haven't gone to T.P.F. It is by far the greatest, I think, pinball expo and show in the world. It's the, the amount of games, the, the awesome people.

[34:05] The, the entire weekend, the weekend is, it's awesome. I, when I went there, I loved it. Whenever I go to expo, I'm like, I'm never going to expo again. It's so boring in comparison. All right. So last comment I got was from TJJ, maybe it's TJ.

[34:22] He was talking about Predator and he emailed me and he said, if I were Tim F, Tim Five, I would absolutely keep the machine.

[34:30] Now, the way he acquired it could be suspect. My assessment is based on the assumption that he paid for the machine and was the only one who did not get screwed by Skippy. However, if he bought it after the Kevin Coolick should hit the fan, then he probably never should have acquired it in the first place sketchy. I plan to research this. Okay. So we know that Tim did acquired after Kevin's whole thing went belly up.

[34:57] And, and that's why people are mad. And like, I don't, I don't really care about what this guy does. I think if you own that machine, it's always going to be, you're, you're going to have a target on your head forever. People are not going to like you.

[35:13] It's just simply because that money in some indirect way made it's made its way to Kevin, whether Kevin sold the prototype to someone else. And then that guy sold it to you. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. This machine was made by a thief, a liar, a crook, and a complete debag. I mean, really, Kevin, you said you were going to get people that are refunded and never dead.

[35:39] I don't know how you sleep at night. I don't know how your father. I don't know how you live with that stuff. But he has to live with it, right. As much as Kevin might feel like he's getting away with it, his life is going to be hell. And it's going to be hell from a financial standpoint moving forward. He's not going to get away with it. Right. You might not get your money back.

[35:58] But his life will be forever changed. It will never be. He'll never have peace of mind. And I know we see him walking around our cage shows and people are like, look, he doesn't seem to care. He bought his kid laptop computers for Christmas.

[36:13] He's a criminal. And now he's acting out the role of a criminal. But at the end, he will pay. He will pay. And he will never have any moment of peace for real. He will act as if what he did wasn't wrong. And he just started a company and went belly up. But you don't get to keep the money.

[36:33] Man, you don't get to keep it. All right, hot hot off the press. I was about to end this podcast. And I just went on the pin side real quick. And I I miss this. But there is an update for alien pinball. So I want to read the update. So it says 23 standards are on the line now parts are arriving every day.

[36:53] We are flat out finishing the first three games for EAG next week. That's a show in Europe. This is the major European coin up trade show in Europe. I should just read that. We aim to have three times aliens there. And so three aliens there and three full throttles there with heavy snowfall forecast over the next 24 hours. We're hoping the roads will be clear as more parts are due to be collected tomorrow.

[37:16] So finishing off the other 20 essays won't take long. Most parts aren't stock. Ellie's still on course for next month. So all right. I mean, that was 12 hours ago from Andrew highway. Look, I mean, I hope they make I hope they make these deadlines when I hear that most parts are in stock.

[37:34] We all know that in assembly line can't go unless you have all the parts. And it's so I you know I kind of I take this news and I'm like, oh, like just be honest, bro. Like the line can't start.

[37:49] Can the line start without all the parts in stock? Maybe I would think you'd want all the parts there to start assembly.

[37:57] So the more interesting thing is that the alien we finally get to look at the limited edition armor. And this looks more like actual machine. So the there's it looks like there's two limited edition alien pinball machines now.

[38:13] One is green and one is blue or you can get black right so there's a you can get a green or black. What makes sense is why does it just have one limited edition column where it's green black or blue are your options instead of having in separating like this doesn't seem to really make much sense.

[38:36] But here's the interesting part. So if you buy the le you don't get the 27 inch back box screen standard. That's optional. That's the first I've heard that that now that's an optional thing and that's that adds another hefty amount onto the price. I'm not sure what the total prices, but I can say this if you get that screen on the le I think this machine is well over $8,000 with all that included.

[39:05] I still am excited to see the illuminated artwork that is inside the cabinet on the LEDs we haven't really seen that yet. There's a 35th anniversary goody bag you get you get exclusive artwork on the alley haven't seen what that looks like yet we're still waiting to see.

[39:23] I will say this on the blue trim and people are asking like why blue like what is blue have to do with alien blue is actually the color used in the aliens film the second movie. And I would assume I'm making this assumption because the blue doesn't look right with the green that the Ellie there will be an Ellie version that's the blue version that also has sort of like the logo will be in blue and the art will be in blue. I think that is probably what will happen.

[39:52] But all this will be confirmed when we actually see the final machine but but from Andrew himself the Ellie's are still in course for next month so that means we're looking at Ellie's in February and he's saying that 20 essays will ship in January.

[40:11] So that's the latest news on alien let's hope all those dates are met we won't say anything further until dates either come and go with machines or come and go without machines.

[40:23] All right happy Friday everyone I'm talking to the black night tonight I will get that interview up sometime maybe over the weekend around Monday have a great weekend enjoy playoff football I'm betting on the sea hawks over the falcons and I really want the packers the steam rolled the cowboys and if you have any feedback on this show as you saw I will read your feedback out when I can send an email to canada pinball at gmail.com say anything.
