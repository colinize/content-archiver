[00:00] I know it's up for me.

[00:03] It's too much tension.

[00:05] Making sure I'm not here too deep.

[00:08] It's too much tension.

[00:10] Keep bursting on my feet.

[00:13] It's too much tension.

[00:15] Yeah.

[00:20] Alright, so if you're listening to episode three of the Canadian Club,

[00:24] I have some really exciting news for everybody.

[00:26] You are going to be the only people

[00:29] that get to hear Canadian Spinball podcasts right now.

[00:31] And I am not going to do any shows outside the paywall.

[00:35] And I want to explain why I'm doing this

[00:38] and why I feel strongly about this

[00:40] because you know what?

[00:41] Canada is a human being

[00:43] and Canada is tired of all the haters,

[00:46] all the losers out there, all the cowards,

[00:48] all the keyboard commandos out there

[00:50] that want to talk smack about Canada.

[00:53] And I'm telling you right now, these gentlemen,

[00:55] you know who they are.

[00:56] You see them on Pinside

[00:58] on my Facebook page.

[01:00] They have other podcasts.

[01:02] Let me tell you.

[01:02] Let me tell you the truth about all these people.

[01:05] They couldn't keep you entertained for three seconds.

[01:09] And yet they're all so high in mighty.

[01:12] They all love to barge into Canada's pinball podcast,

[01:16] Facebook page.

[01:17] They all love to go on to Pinside and talk all sorts of smack about Canada.

[01:22] So here's what we're going to do.

[01:23] Canada is going to give Canada to the Canadian fans.

[01:27] And you deserve to have these shows.

[01:29] And they don't.

[01:30] And I'm tired of doing the shows for free for everybody.

[01:33] To critique, to insult, and to say what they will about me

[01:37] because they're all a bunch of cowards.

[01:39] They know that.

[01:40] I know that.

[01:41] And you know that.

[01:42] And so for contributing to Canada's pinball podcast,

[01:44] you now are the only ones who will get

[01:47] Canada's pinball podcast.

[01:48] And I really don't care.

[01:49] I really don't care because at the end of the day,

[01:52] what's exciting to me is doing a show for those who contribute

[01:55] and those who give back to Canada's pinball podcast,

[01:58] everybody else can go punch sand.

[02:00] Everybody else can go try to figure out what's happening over at JJP.

[02:04] I mean, this has been a long time coming.

[02:06] And I tell this to Brenda all the time.

[02:07] I'm like, why do I do this?

[02:09] 500 and 88 podcasts about pinball.

[02:13] 588 shows about pinball.

[02:17] And behind every single show,

[02:19] it's hours of reading Pinside.

[02:21] It's hours of letting that toxic information into my brain.

[02:25] To do a show to entertain the pinball world.

[02:28] To win four twippies in a row.

[02:31] The best pinball podcast on the planet

[02:34] ain't no other pinball podcast even close.

[02:37] Look at the votes, people.

[02:38] Look at the votes.

[02:40] Three times the amount of votes as the second place show.

[02:43] And look at the effort they put into it so much so

[02:47] that the super awesome pinball show basically quit.

[02:50] When they realized they weren't going to win the twippy.

[02:52] And I do miss that show because that show actually brought us

[02:55] news and information.

[02:57] Now it's just the same old circle jerk.

[03:00] And you see it happening.

[03:01] The same old circle jerk of everybody just congratulating

[03:05] everybody.

[03:06] Everybody being a special guest on their own network shows.

[03:10] Special guest on my own network.

[03:13] And you get tired of it.

[03:14] And you see through it.

[03:16] You see how thinly veiled it all really is.

[03:19] That these are just friends of the people who make these games.

[03:23] These are just friends of people who sell you games.

[03:27] The whole thing is designed to drive everybody to a single

[03:33] distributor to buy product.

[03:35] And it's so thinly veiled.

[03:37] Everybody sees through it.

[03:38] Nobody tells you how they really feel about the games.

[03:41] Nobody tells you how they really feel about the companies.

[03:44] Nobody tells you anything that's actually real.

[03:47] And then I come out and I try to give you exactly how I feel

[03:50] about this stuff with no strings attached.

[03:53] No strings attached.

[03:54] No agenda.

[03:56] No friends to lose because I don't care about these pinball

[03:59] companies because I don't care to lose friends over at these

[04:02] pinball companies.

[04:03] I just want to tell you how I really feel about the product.

[04:06] And if a pinball company is having issues,

[04:08] I don't want to let up on it.

[04:10] I don't want to give them a pass.

[04:12] And I'll tell you I got to be completely honest.

[04:14] And because this is behind the paywall,

[04:16] I really don't care anymore.

[04:17] The response I've gotten from Jersey Jack Pinball has made me

[04:22] fall out of love with pinball.

[04:25] And my enthusiasm for this hobby has gone from 100 to zero

[04:30] because the second largest pinball company in the world

[04:33] who made the most amazing masterpiece that I was so excited

[04:37] to get has basically treated me like I am some enemy.

[04:43] Like I am some villain to their organization.

[04:47] And you know what it feels like when they do that,

[04:50] when they turn to you and say stop attacking us,

[04:53] you're the bad guy because you demand quality from this company.

[04:57] You know what it feels like it's like I don't even care anymore.

[05:00] Like why would I want to invest money in a company that treats

[05:05] its customers like that?

[05:07] I get unfriended.

[05:08] I mean this unfriended by Ken Cromwell.

[05:12] He unfriends me on Facebook unfriends me.

[05:15] They blocked my ability to comment on Jersey Jack Pinball's

[05:18] Facebook page.

[05:19] And I'm supposed to just put the mic on and cheerly

[05:23] these companies and these people.

[05:25] It doesn't make any sense to me.

[05:26] And I highly implore you to invest your money in companies

[05:29] that you believe in.

[05:31] And for me right now Jersey Jack Pinball has basically

[05:34] ruined my enjoyment of pinball because the way they've

[05:37] responded to me.

[05:38] And I was so excited about this game.

[05:41] I was so excited to get it.

[05:42] And now I feel like I don't even care anymore.

[05:45] I just want to get rid of it.

[05:47] I just want to sell it.

[05:48] I want to make money back on it and I don't even want to

[05:51] play it because the company that made it has treated me

[05:55] like I'm a villain, like I'm the enemy.

[05:58] And I have the text messages and I have the correspondence

[06:02] between them and me to prove it.

[06:04] What they think of me.

[06:06] Can they just pinball podcast?

[06:08] The number one pinball podcast in the world who got more

[06:11] people excited about guns and roses than anybody else.

[06:15] And I did them a solid.

[06:16] I never leaked the photos of the game.

[06:19] I never screwed over their big reveal moment.

[06:22] And the way they pay me back is by saying to me as a

[06:26] customer of their product that knows he's going to have

[06:29] quality control issues.

[06:32] The payback I get from Jersey Jack Pinball is to just

[06:36] punch sand.

[06:38] The payback I get, the payback I get is to tell me that

[06:43] I'm an enemy of their state that I'm driving angry

[06:47] consumers to their door and to please stop attacking them.

[06:52] That's what they told me.

[06:53] Please stop attacking us attacking you.

[06:56] All I'm doing is covering the quality issues of your

[07:01] very product.

[07:02] That's not an attack, my friends.

[07:05] That's not an attack.

[07:07] It's simply me as a buyer wanting to get something

[07:11] that is of quality for $12,500 of my hard earned money.

[07:17] $12,500 is more than most Americans have in savings.

[07:22] And I shouldn't feel bad that I demand quality.

[07:25] But that's where we're at, ladies and gentlemen.

[07:27] Can you just pinball podcasts on the bad guy?

[07:29] I once again am the bad negative guy that won't let up on

[07:34] this while every other show out there will do interviews

[07:38] with people and they'll tell you to buy, buy, buy.

[07:41] So here's the deal.

[07:43] Here's the deal.

[07:44] Pinball right now is in a crazy spot.

[07:46] It's an crazy spot.

[07:47] Prices are crazy.

[07:48] People are spending stupid amounts of money on games.

[07:51] I just saw that a medieval madness royal edition sold

[07:55] for $18,500.

[07:58] The game was $10,000 a year ago.

[08:01] 85% increase in price on a medieval madness royal edition.

[08:09] 85% talk about inflation.

[08:13] Toronto Lee sold for $25,000.

[08:18] And so here we are.

[08:20] Pinball.

[08:21] And I've been thinking about this a lot.

[08:22] You got to think about what does pinball mean to me?

[08:26] And I mean this.

[08:27] These games to me, we're looking at these prices,

[08:30] looking at these rich people throw money at this stuff

[08:32] like it's water.

[08:34] It's made me fall out of love with pinball.

[08:37] Why would you be excited about pinball when prices are at

[08:41] this level?

[08:42] Why?

[08:43] When you could have got a Lord of the Rings from Stern Pinball

[08:46] fully featured, no Ellie's premiums or pros.

[08:49] Just Lord of the Rings.

[08:51] They made the best pinball machine they could make.

[08:54] They put everything in it and they didn't delve into the

[08:57] whole collector market.

[08:59] It was $3700.

[09:03] Has everybody forgotten that?

[09:06] What you could get for $3700.

[09:11] And now people are spending $14,000 on Mandalorian Ellie's

[09:17] and look at the Mandalorian next to Lord of the Rings.

[09:21] It has hardly anything in comparison.

[09:24] Hardly anything.

[09:25] Lord of the Rings is a far better pinball machine.

[09:29] It has way more mechanisms and creativity and imagination.

[09:33] And it came out in 2004 people.

[09:37] So 17 years ago, Stern put more into their machines than

[09:42] they do today and we're supposed to be excited and we're

[09:46] supposed to spend three to four to five times as much money

[09:50] on these games.

[09:51] And Canadian's supposed to shut up, be happy and do a

[09:55] podcast for everybody.

[09:57] Why would I do that?

[09:59] Why would I stop thinking critically about this industry?

[10:03] That's what got me four twippies.

[10:05] That's what got me 3,000 people to listen to every show.

[10:09] And accepting this now is the new pinball.

[10:12] The new pinball is we are going to accept less for more.

[10:17] And we're supposed to be excited about that.

[10:20] And that the only changes they're making to these games to

[10:23] make them more valuable is the artwork, the armor, the

[10:28] back glass.

[10:29] Nothing on the play field itself is what they're touching to

[10:33] make the games worth more money.

[10:35] And I look at a game like Mandalorian and I look at the lack of

[10:38] creativity and it just makes me be like, why are we all

[10:42] still supporting this?

[10:45] You have a game about Star Wars people.

[10:49] You have a game about a baby Yoda that can use force powers

[10:54] to grab stuff and move stuff.

[10:57] And then you look at how Stern pinball implements baby Yoda

[11:02] into the pinball machine and there's no outcry.

[11:05] There's nothing.

[11:06] There's nothing but cheerleaders everywhere to be seen.

[11:09] And I'm here to tell you right now that Brian Eddie's

[11:13] Mandalorian is a joke.

[11:16] It is a joke, ladies and gentlemen.

[11:18] And look at how little creativity is in that pinball machine.

[11:23] Where is the magic?

[11:25] Where is the magic?

[11:26] And I'm tired of all the apologists.

[11:29] I don't want to do a pinball podcast no more if I have to just cheerlead

[11:34] this stuff.

[11:35] And you see it, people are like, I'm not going to listen to your show

[11:38] no more, because you're so negative.

[11:40] Why should I be positive about taking a franchise like the

[11:45] Mandalorian and you can even implement force powers using

[11:50] magnets in a creative way.

[11:52] And I'm supposed to get excited.

[11:54] I'll tell you I'm going to be completely honest.

[11:56] Mandalorian LEDs are flipping for 13 to $14,000.

[12:00] If you don't flip your mando right now, you're silly.

[12:04] You're silly.

[12:05] Ninety two hundred bucks for that game and you could get 13 to

[12:10] $14,000 for it.

[12:12] Ladies and gentlemen, do me a favor.

[12:14] Sell it.

[12:15] Sell it today.

[12:17] Make four to $5,000 on a machine that doesn't even have any real magic on the

[12:24] play field.

[12:25] And you know it.

[12:26] And you know it.

[12:27] And I know it.

[12:28] And they don't want to hear it.

[12:29] And now you get to hear it, all right.

[12:31] You're sitting in your car right now.

[12:33] You're sitting in your home and you're like, you're only going to be one of

[12:36] like a hundred people who hear this podcast.

[12:38] And that's amazing to me because I don't even care.

[12:41] You know, it's like Atlas shrugged.

[12:43] One day all the talented people of the world will just leave.

[12:48] They'll just shrug their shoulders, give up and depart the world.

[12:54] And that's what's happening with Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[12:56] I'm just departing.

[12:58] The pinball world that everybody knows.

[13:01] The community out there.

[13:03] And now you get to enjoy it.

[13:05] And now you get to fly the plane.

[13:06] And if you've never read Atlas shrugged, it's an amazing bug.

[13:09] But you get to fly the plane.

[13:11] And you get to visit Canada land.

[13:13] And you get to enjoy this show now.

[13:15] Nobody else gets to enjoy it.

[13:17] And all the cowards on Pinside that complain about me that listen to every show.

[13:21] Now they don't get to listen to every show.

[13:24] Now they don't get to have something to hate.

[13:27] Now they have to go just join the network.

[13:29] Listen to all the cheerleading.

[13:31] Listen to all the pinball people that support everything pinball.

[13:35] How exciting is that?

[13:37] How entertaining is that?

[13:40] I'm glad you're here.

[13:41] Because after doing 588 shows,

[13:45] you're one of the very few people who actually contributed to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[13:50] You said, you know what?

[13:52] I'm going to kick this dude a few times because he does a lot of work.

[13:56] And he gives me so much entertainment on a weekly basis.

[14:00] And I'm going to support him.

[14:02] And out of 3,000 listeners,

[14:05] I think the last I checked I had maybe, maybe 70 people who contributed to the show,

[14:11] maybe 75, at a 3,000 people.

[14:14] And that's the world today.

[14:16] Everybody feels entitled to something.

[14:19] But nobody wants to give back.

[14:21] So you get it.

[14:22] You contribute it to the show.

[14:25] And that is why I love each and every one of you because you get it.

[14:28] You get the way the world works.

[14:30] You get the way the world works.

[14:32] You understand the way the world is supposed to work.

[14:35] And that is something that I want to reward.

[14:37] I'm tired of all the other phonies out there that are all living their lives with the motto,

[14:42] do as I say not as I do.

[14:45] And we know who they are.

[14:47] Do as I say not as I do.

[14:49] And they would never be able to do this.

[14:51] They would never be able to talk about pinball.

[14:53] So let's talk a little bit about what's happening in pinball.

[14:55] So let's talk about pinball.

[14:56] So the next spooky pinball game will be Nightmare on Elm Street.

[15:01] I feel very confident in this.

[15:03] The artist that did,

[15:05] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, has also done artwork for Nightmare on Elm Street franchise.

[15:11] And I heard that the artwork on this game is impeccable.

[15:15] It is incredible.

[15:16] I heard it.

[15:17] I know it.

[15:18] It's going to be amazing.

[15:20] But I fully expect the next spooky to be Nightmare on Elm Street, Freddy Krueger's back.

[15:27] And that is what we're going to get probably at the end of this month, early next month.

[15:32] It is happening very soon.

[15:34] I also know that if everything goes according to plan, listen to me right now people.

[15:41] There will be cactus canyon remakes brought to the Allentown pinball show at the end of July.

[15:48] That is the plan.

[15:49] Whether that happens or not is up in the air.

[15:53] But that is the plan by CGC to bring cactus canyon remake to Allentown.

[15:59] And you are going to see that game very, very soon.

[16:02] And what I've heard from the people over at CGC is that this is their nicest game to date.

[16:07] That this game is going to sell out right away because when people see it,

[16:11] and they see all the toys in it, and what they've done with the code, and what they've done with the artwork,

[16:15] everybody is going to want to cactus canyon remake.

[16:18] And I'll tell you right now, we know that these playfields are going to be bulletproof.

[16:21] We know that cactus canyon is packed with toys.

[16:24] We know that this game, if they do the code justice, is going to be a must-have game.

[16:30] Do me a favor.

[16:31] Google Mandalorian pinball and put it next to cactus canyon pinball.

[16:35] And look at how much more was in a game from the mid 90s.

[16:40] It is embarrassing.

[16:42] And this is the part I just can't get over.

[16:44] I just can't get over how these ballet Williams games had so much in them.

[16:49] And then we see these stern products, and we're supposed to get excited.

[16:53] How do you get excited about these games?

[16:55] I just want to spend a day in Joe Abati's head, where he just cheerleads everything stern.

[17:01] He thinks Rick and Morty is great.

[17:03] He thinks Rick and Morty is great.

[17:05] There's nothing in Rick and Morty.

[17:07] Rick and Morty is a show about going through portals.

[17:09] You just, the ball just rolls into the garage, and it gets shot out the same place every single time.

[17:15] How is that created?

[17:16] Look at Rick and Morty.

[17:17] Look at the center of that game.

[17:19] Look at the center of that game.

[17:21] And you tell me what any of that has to do with Rick and Morty the show.

[17:24] What is it have to do with the show?

[17:26] The horseshoe with the drop targets and the lock.

[17:29] What is it have to do with Rick and Morty?

[17:31] They've got the spaceship on a spring.

[17:33] I mean, we made fun of the tie fighter on a spring to no end.

[17:37] And that's exactly what spooky pinball did with Rick and Morty.

[17:41] And everybody's fine with it.

[17:43] It's like, oh, we'll make fun of you over here for doing it.

[17:46] But when you do it over there, it's fine.

[17:48] Because we like spooky.

[17:50] And I do like spooky.

[17:51] But I'm just saying, Rick and Morty, eh, I don't know.

[17:55] Didn't have the creativity it should have in a game of that theme.

[17:58] So when cactus canyon gets shown to people and people see everything that's in it,

[18:03] I think people are going to realize

[18:05] where the magic is.

[18:07] This company is basically taking some of the greatest games of all time.

[18:11] And they're remaking them in a way that's even nicer than they used to be.

[18:15] How do you not support that?

[18:17] I mean, my biggest mistake is I let my medieval man as royal go.

[18:21] I had one.

[18:22] I bought a medieval man as royal for $10,000.

[18:26] And I was hit up by my distributor and he said, are you going to take it?

[18:29] Can you take delivery? I'm like, I can't.

[18:31] You can just sell it to somebody else.

[18:33] I let it go. I didn't flip it.

[18:35] Then I just saw one sold for 18.5.

[18:37] 85% over what I paid.

[18:40] I'm still kicking myself.

[18:42] I'm really kicking myself that all of us could have bought Pirates of the Caribbean,

[18:46] CE, inbox for an entire year for 12.5 and nobody bought it.

[18:50] They were sitting at automated for an entire year for 12.5 and we just didn't buy them.

[18:58] $38,000 they sold for this year.

[19:01] Inbox, Pirates of the Caribbean, CE.

[19:03] So that's my new thing.

[19:05] As I realize that pinball prices are stupid.

[19:08] As I realize there's a lack of magic in these games.

[19:11] And as I'm completely honest to you behind the paywall, here's my new realization.

[19:16] I will play pinball on location.

[19:19] I will enjoy pinball on location.

[19:21] I will enjoy pinball at my friends' houses.

[19:24] I have friends who have every single new machine.

[19:27] I have friends in New York City that have every single machine you could want to play.

[19:31] So instead of buying these games, instead of falling into the FOMO cycle of having to own everything,

[19:37] I will simply play other people's games.

[19:40] The fact that people would drop $14,000 on Mandalorian says it all.

[19:47] That this hobby didn't just jump the shark.

[19:50] It jumped over the fawns who's jumping over the shark.

[19:54] This hobby has become stupid.

[19:57] It is stupid to invest money in these machines at these prices.

[20:01] You all know it.

[20:02] You all know it.

[20:03] The problem is nobody will say that.

[20:05] Nobody will just come out and say it is gotten to the point where this hobby is no longer fun

[20:12] because the prices of everything are stupid.

[20:15] And it is absolutely asinine that we are spending this kind of money on this kind of experience.

[20:22] How do you unbox a pirate to the Caribbean for $38,000 and have a $38,000 experience?

[20:31] Like how do you even do it?

[20:33] So my new behavior in Pimball will be to enjoy Pimball.

[20:38] I'm going to play the FAT of Pimball machines.

[20:41] I'm going to enjoy them left and right.

[20:43] And I'm going to love them for how they were intended to be played, which is on location.

[20:49] Which is you leave your house, you go somewhere and you play a Pimball machine.

[20:54] That is how Pimball was designed to be.

[20:57] And that is how I will enjoy it.

[20:59] And the easiest way to enjoy Pimball is to do what Pimball was intended to do.

[21:04] It's to go find an arcade and play these machines.

[21:07] Nobody wants to tell you that you should not have these games in your home.

[21:11] Nobody wants you to hear that.

[21:13] Nobody wants to tell you that because everyone is doing all the other shows.

[21:16] They're so deeply connected to manufacturers and distributors.

[21:19] And they want Pimball to sell because they think if we sell more Pimball, Pimball won't die.

[21:24] Pimball is not dying, ladies and gentlemen.

[21:27] Pimball is going to be around for a very long time.

[21:30] It is a hobby that is consumed by wealthy people.

[21:34] And there are a ton of wealthy people who are very bored, who will continue to buy Pimball for many, many years to come.

[21:42] And that's why it's exciting to follow this hobby.

[21:45] To see how little these companies can put in these games and how much these rich folks will spend on it.

[21:52] To me, that's Pimball lately.

[21:54] How little can we put into the game and how much can they charge and how fast it all sells out.

[22:01] It is so much more fun to be a spectator of watching that happen than it is to jump in with my money.

[22:09] I give my money to my financial advisor.

[22:12] My money is going to Killian's future.

[22:14] It's going to my family and to experiences that I will never forget.

[22:19] I don't think if I spend $9,000 on a Pimball machine or $15,000 or $13,000, I don't think Pimball will give me the satisfaction at those prices.

[22:30] And you know it.

[22:32] Because these games used to be $3,700 bucks.

[22:35] $3,500.

[22:37] What was Twilight Zone brand new?

[22:39] Look at Twilight Zone.

[22:41] I bet that game brand new in a box was $2,500 bucks.

[22:46] $2,500 bucks you could get a Twilight Zone brand new.

[22:50] And you look at these games today and we're supposed to just cheerlead.

[22:54] Uh-uh.

[22:55] No, not on my watch.

[22:56] Not on Kineita's watch.

[22:57] Anyway, I hope you enjoy the Kineita Club.

[23:01] I'm going to be a little bit more strident, a little bit more candid than I do on my normal show.

[23:05] And I just don't feel like doing the other show.

[23:07] I only feel like doing this show now for people who actually care about Kineita.

[23:11] And I'm tired of everybody just insulting me and being a critic of mine.

[23:15] The number one Pimball podcast in the world.

[23:18] Four years in a row.

[23:19] Band by Pinside.

[23:21] The toxic adventure.

[23:23] The guy that's psychopathic.

[23:24] The guy that's bipolar.

[23:25] The guy that can't keep it together.

[23:27] The guy is going to make Pimball podcast.

[23:29] Guess for who?

[23:30] For you.

[23:31] He's going to remove himself from the Pimball community and make podcasts for those people who contribute.

[23:38] And if you are listening right now, you've contributed to Kineita's Pimball podcast.

[23:43] Thank you.

[23:44] If someone shared you a link and you're listening, shame on you.

[23:47] You should be contributing.

[23:49] So everybody, enjoy Kineita Club Episode 3.

[23:52] More to come.

[23:53] And only for you.

[23:55] Thank you so much.

[23:56] Thank you so much.
