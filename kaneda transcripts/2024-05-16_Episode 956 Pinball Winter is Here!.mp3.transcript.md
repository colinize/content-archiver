[00:00] Are you safe, you're funny, don't face out in all gray,

[00:03] Tell us, say you're funny, don't fit funny, no.

[00:07] Are you safe, you've got to say that I don't really care for you.

[00:14] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:19] Uh, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast, the world's most favorite pinball podcast with the best customer service in all of pinball.

[00:28] Something you can't even measure, right?

[00:30] Alright, here's what we're going to talk about on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:33] We're going to talk about what I'm hearing is Stern's next game.

[00:38] John Wick is not selling, I'm hearing this thing is coming out in June or July.

[00:42] I think it's going to shock some people.

[00:44] We've been going back on forth and went, what's next from Stern?

[00:48] We're going to talk about why I think Indiana Jones was lost by Stern Pinball,

[00:54] interesting rumors starting to creep up here.

[00:57] And then we're going to talk about John Wick and Pinball Winter.

[01:01] Like you can just feel it.

[01:03] Like it's in the air, like everyone's starting to just like panic a little bit.

[01:07] Everyone's realizing that they can't buy all these things.

[01:10] And here's what we're going to do because I'm talking to these people right now on Facebook Live.

[01:14] I'm going to let these people go.

[01:16] And if you want to hear where this show goes, you know where to go.

[01:20] Canadian Pinball Podcast, you guys are the best.

[01:22] We're almost at 700 paid subscribers, more subscribers to this show than every other

[01:30] single pinball content creator combined.

[01:33] And I'm talking to them right now because they're looking at me right now.

[01:37] And hey, what happened all those years you were making fun of me for doing Patreon?

[01:42] And here we are people, no giveaways, no shills, no polo shirts.

[01:48] Just the world's favorite pinball podcaster.

[01:51] All right, let's shut these guys off on Facebook and take it to the airwaves.

[01:54] Here we go.

[01:55] All right, guys, you know this, I'm never going to give the Facebook people who don't really

[01:59] give much other than their time as much as I give each and every one of you.

[02:04] All right, so here's the thing.

[02:05] Let's talk first about this rumor I keep hearing.

[02:07] And this just gets kind of annoying because I hear that Stern's next game is going to be

[02:14] a Vault Edition game.

[02:16] I'm also now hearing that it is going to be a game in which Ray Day is working on moving

[02:22] the DMD dots over to the LCD screen.

[02:26] I don't think it's going to be like all new animations.

[02:29] Maybe there's some animations, but I don't know if there's going to be like 4k video

[02:33] footage, which it's not going to be because that's like the spike three thing.

[02:36] But here's the thing I'm hearing now.

[02:38] And this is really annoying.

[02:40] I am hearing that because John Wick sales are not great and think about it, like when

[02:44] Stern has a flop, what can they do?

[02:46] They can't really get a new game or a cornerstone on the line very quickly.

[02:51] But what Stern has shown us they'll do is they will go back to the well and we know it as the Vault.

[02:57] And so here's what I'm hearing.

[02:58] I'm hearing the next Vault game from Stern Pimball that's supposedly coming out in June or July.

[03:05] It's got to be like July is no other than Metallica.

[03:09] Now look, this is the thing is like I keep hearing two reports.

[03:13] One is that there's going to be an all new Metallica game that's on spike three.

[03:17] That's the first spike three game.

[03:19] Now I'm hearing that the next game is going to be a Vault of Metallica.

[03:23] What if what if most of that is true?

[03:25] So here's what I think might be happening.

[03:27] Maybe just maybe spike three is the platform they are going to use to vault some of those older games.

[03:35] And maybe just maybe right.

[03:38] This is going to be the launch of spike three.

[03:40] It's a little weird though, right?

[03:41] Because if you're going to launch spike three and it has 4k video,

[03:46] you would think you would use something that has like 4k imagery.

[03:49] And it's really strange too.

[03:50] We're like George Gomez is talking about how John Wick has all this 4k footage that they have.

[03:56] But their system and their platform doesn't broadcast in 4k.

[04:00] So I don't know what to tell you.

[04:02] I'm just going to tell you this.

[04:03] I also know that John Borg is working on Tron and a Tron remake.

[04:08] So like do what you will with these Metallicas and these Trons.

[04:13] Here's my advice to all of you.

[04:14] If you love your Metallica, if you love your Tron, just hold on to it.

[04:20] I mean, just hold on to it and play it.

[04:22] Yeah, if they do remakes of these games, are your games going to lose value?

[04:27] Absolutely.

[04:28] Well, welcome to pinball since 2019.

[04:31] Everything's losing value.

[04:33] Maybe just enjoy it.

[04:35] Don't worry about the remake.

[04:36] But what's going to happen?

[04:38] If Stern does this and they burn all those original Metallica owners,

[04:42] they're really digging the grave even deeper.

[04:45] And that's what's weird about all of this.

[04:48] It's like when you remake Jurassic Park, you've now created 500 people that are pissed off at you.

[04:54] When you do what you did with Elvira, you've now pissed off 500 people.

[04:59] If 500 people bought in James Bond 60th, you've now pissed off those 500 people.

[05:05] And I know it doesn't always seem like a lot with each new launch,

[05:09] but when you start to add up all those different groups of 500 people,

[05:14] all of a sudden you've got a few thousand people that don't like the way Stern is doing business.

[05:21] And I think that's what they're feeling right now with John Wick.

[05:24] Let's just get right to it right now.

[05:25] So John Wick sales are abysmal.

[05:27] Everyone knows it.

[05:28] Like you can see it everywhere.

[05:29] And the reason why I'm saying like winter is here, like pinball winter is here.

[05:33] This strategy just is not going to work.

[05:36] Right?

[05:36] These expensive games shove them down the throats of distributors and dealers.

[05:41] Then they have to shove them down the throats of customers like you and me.

[05:44] It's just not working.

[05:46] And there's no greater proof that this thing is not working than the damage control tour that George Gomez had to go on.

[05:53] Did you see him go all over the place trying to get Jaws sales?

[05:56] No, he didn't.

[05:57] It's just funny too, because all these shill content creators,

[06:00] they're really looking like one-trick ponies.

[06:03] Like yeah, it used to work where you could just celebrate every new game,

[06:08] put up a stream, and then people would order the game.

[06:11] But then why is it after this game has been out now for two weeks,

[06:15] you go on the John Wick owners page, right?

[06:18] These are people that have ordered the game.

[06:20] It's not even two pages.

[06:22] There has never been a Stern launch where after two weeks of it being out,

[06:27] the owners club does not even have two pages of people saying how excited they are to get the game.

[06:33] Right there, game over.

[06:34] We're in the winter time now, right?

[06:36] Pimble Winter is here.

[06:37] Stern has never had this, right?

[06:39] And this is a culmination of all these different things, snowballing,

[06:43] like burning the people that bought your older Elise by making more,

[06:47] jacking the prices up through the roof,

[06:49] and then coming out with like themes that are not nostalgic,

[06:52] they're not take my money now themes,

[06:55] and then also not having much in the game.

[06:57] This is the biggest issue with John Wick for me.

[06:58] It's like all the distractions around the artwork and the guns and this.

[07:02] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[07:02] The real issue with John Wick, it's freaking empty.

[07:05] The game is freaking empty.

[07:07] And you can't sell a freaking empty game for this much money.

[07:11] When they lift the playfield on this game,

[07:13] and you see how much is underneath John Wick,

[07:17] and then you look at the price tag, it's like again, F off.

[07:20] And we're all going to be saying F off in a much more fun and jovial way.

[07:24] Yeah, I feel like I want to just tell George Gomez to F off,

[07:27] like I'm Christopher Walken or something.

[07:29] You know, I'm not mad.

[07:30] I'm not angry.

[07:30] Just George, I see a game.

[07:33] Look at this.

[07:34] John Wick, not selling $13,000.

[07:38] John Wick, what's going on here?

[07:41] I remember when this game was 5,500.

[07:45] George, there's nothing in this game.

[07:47] George, where's all this stuff?

[07:49] You know, George saw me in ACDC.

[07:52] He's got four times as much in it.

[07:54] Not paying these prices.

[07:55] That's a terrible Christopher Walken.

[07:57] But you know what I mean, people?

[07:58] You know what I mean?

[07:59] It's just like the winter is here.

[08:00] It's like all of this, all of this.

[08:02] It's one big machine that only knows how to do one thing.

[08:07] And it worked well for so many years.

[08:09] And now it's not working.

[08:10] I don't know about you.

[08:11] I keep saying this, man.

[08:12] Like the greatest thing about pinball, someone put up a thread.

[08:15] And they were like, this is the greatest time ever to be in pinball.

[08:19] And it really is.

[08:20] But it's not about new and box chasing.

[08:23] The reason why this is the greatest time to be in pinball

[08:26] is the most amount of people who have ever been into this hobby

[08:29] are into it right now.

[08:31] And you know what that means?

[08:32] You have the greatest chances to make some of the best friends in your life.

[08:36] You are going to make so many good friends in this hobby.

[08:40] And you can have those friends and keep those friends

[08:43] without buying every new and box game.

[08:46] And I think there's just a majority of people right now

[08:49] that just don't want anything to do with

[08:52] these ridiculous new and box prices.

[08:54] So speaking of with John Wick, this thread that's on fire, that's amazing.

[08:58] So there is this dude that puts a wanted ad up on pinside.

[09:02] And he says, I want a John Wick LE.

[09:05] And I want to pay $11,000.

[09:07] And that's it.

[09:08] And I buy a ton of games.

[09:09] I route a ton of games.

[09:11] Distributors know who I am.

[09:13] And I want to buy one of your John Wick LEs.

[09:15] And I'll take it off your hands at cost.

[09:18] Because that's what the cost to the dealer is.

[09:20] And that's it.

[09:21] He just walks in like a baller.

[09:22] He's like, look, I get it.

[09:23] It's $13,000.

[09:24] I'm not paying that.

[09:26] And then what happens?

[09:27] He finds someone who will sell it to him for $11,000.

[09:31] And for some weird reason, that was making people angry.

[09:35] Like why would anyone in our community get angry

[09:39] that this guy has exposed how overpriced this stuff is?

[09:44] Like he found the one car dealership that will sell you the car at the right price.

[09:48] And what does everybody want to do?

[09:50] They want to go tattle tail on him.

[09:51] Who is it?

[09:52] That dealer is going to lose their stern license.

[09:55] F all this stuff.

[09:56] F off it.

[09:57] That's how you feel.

[09:58] What this guy did was he just showed you

[10:01] what the real market value is for a John Wick.

[10:04] And now everyone who bought one for $13,000 feels like an idiot.

[10:09] I told you, if you buy one for $13,000, you're an idiot.

[10:13] Because this game is worth $9,000 by the end of the year.

[10:16] And the reason I know that, because that's what James Bond is worth,

[10:19] more popular theme, more in that game, has better code, has a better design.

[10:25] So if that game went to $9,000, what do you think John Wick's going to do?

[10:29] And there was tons of demand for James Bond.

[10:31] There was no demand for John Wick.

[10:33] And they made a game with hardly any demand, not even that good.

[10:36] And here's the scariest part.

[10:38] This is where the real stern arrogance lies.

[10:41] George Gomez keeps saying that they set the prices based on the demand.

[10:46] Okay.

[10:47] If you think about it in pinball, what really creates the demand other than the theme, right?

[10:52] What makes people open up their wallets, especially in the collector space?

[10:55] How many of these are you going to make?

[10:57] And how much money is it?

[10:59] And so it's just crazy to me when you think about it, that Star Wars,

[11:03] the most popular theme maybe Stern has ever made,

[11:06] they only made 800 Star Wars pinball machines that were LEs.

[11:11] And they're making even more John Wick's, 1000 John Wick's,

[11:16] 1000 Venoms, it's caught up to them.

[11:19] Winter is here for Stern.

[11:21] Now look, now trust me when I say this people,

[11:23] it doesn't mean winter is always going to be here for Stern.

[11:26] If they have a crazy awesome theme, if they actually do have Pokemon,

[11:32] they're going to need something though, right?

[11:33] They need something that's a banger.

[11:36] And if they just vault Metallica, when there's already like 6,000 Metallica machines in the world,

[11:43] I think this Stern winter is going to last for a really long time.

[11:47] And it's just going to get so old, like seeing all these people

[11:50] trying to jam these things out into the market and jam them down our throats.

[11:55] I'm sorry, it's just not going to work.

[11:57] Oh, look, it's great.

[11:59] There's nothing negative here.

[12:00] It's like the more we wait on the sidelines, people trust me,

[12:03] they're going to have to lower prices.

[12:05] There's no way out of this.

[12:06] There is no way out of this other than lowering prices.

[12:10] And what that gentleman just showed us is that you actually can go get a new inbox,

[12:15] John Wick LE, for $11,000.

[12:18] And what's the problem with that, right?

[12:20] Because the way it works is, let's just say you're a dealer and you get 20 Stern LEs.

[12:25] You have to keep ordering those 20 LEs,

[12:28] or Stern will start to give your allocation to another dealer or distro.

[12:33] And so like when Jaws comes out, you happily will take those 20 LEs

[12:38] because you know you will sell them.

[12:39] And then John Wick comes out and what do you do?

[12:42] Right?

[12:43] What do you do if you think Pokemon is somewhere down the line?

[12:46] Or what do you do if you think there's a huge game coming out?

[12:50] You're going to have to order your 20 John Wick's.

[12:54] And if you don't, then you're not going to get your 20 Pokemons.

[12:57] And so this is why it's smart for a dealer to give someone the game at cost.

[13:04] Like I have to buy these 20.

[13:05] Now remember, that's 20 games times $11,000 freaking dollars, right?

[13:11] That's well over $200,000.

[13:14] I have to buy a game and I'm not going to be able to make any money selling these at $13,000.

[13:20] And if I hold the line at $13,000, I could be holding on to these games

[13:24] to the point where maybe the market value becomes worth like $9,000.

[13:29] Then I've lost $2,000 on every game I have.

[13:33] That's what's happening with VenomLE right now.

[13:36] If you have one new in box, it's a $9,000 game.

[13:39] And so if a dealer bought it at $11,000, they're out $2,000.

[13:42] And they're not used to this.

[13:44] And that's why you're seeing the Gomez Panic Tour.

[13:47] That's why we're seeing all the content creator shields like working overdrive right now,

[13:52] trying to convince people John Wick is a great game.

[13:54] They know John Wick is not a great game.

[13:56] It's an okay game.

[13:57] But they also know it's one of the most overpriced things Stern has ever brought to market.

[14:01] And they can never tell you this.

[14:03] And that's why you're here listening to Canada.

[14:05] All right.

[14:05] What else is going on in pinball though?

[14:07] Because John Wick is over.

[14:08] It's over.

[14:08] It's dead on arrival.

[14:10] It is dead on arrival.

[14:12] You know, it's not dead on arrival.

[14:13] Canada's pinball podcast.

[14:14] Here's another game that's interesting to me.

[14:16] This Fun House remake, right?

[14:18] Did they brought it out?

[14:19] We still haven't seen a video.

[14:21] I asked somebody, Kelly Daniels shared me a clip of his Fun House 2.0 kit.

[14:27] And I watched it for 10 minutes.

[14:29] And now I know why Padredy Gaming did not share too much gameplay video of this game.

[14:36] It's kind of boring compared to modern games.

[14:38] And that's the thing.

[14:39] It doesn't matter how nice the lights are or the artwork is.

[14:43] They're just something about a Fun House that doesn't really show well compared to modern pinball.

[14:50] And maybe, maybe, just maybe we should stop trying to remake all these games

[14:56] and just make modern games with modern innovation, with a nostalgic theme everybody wants,

[15:04] and put toys and mechanisms into it that justify the price.

[15:07] How freaking hard is it to do that?

[15:09] But it's getting hard, man.

[15:10] It's getting hard.

[15:11] I don't think they're going to sell these Fun Houses.

[15:13] I really don't.

[15:14] You know, it's really hard.

[15:15] I was looking at, I was looking at the tour of Barrels of Fun.

[15:18] And they led us into their factory.

[15:21] And Canada owes them a pizza party.

[15:23] So if you're listening and you're a member of Barrels of Fun,

[15:26] I am going to buy you a pizza lunch because that's the offer.

[15:29] If you open up your door on a random day and show us your manufacturing,

[15:34] you get a pizza party from Canada.

[15:36] They also were very transparent about how many games they've made to date,

[15:40] how many orders they got, and how many they have to go.

[15:43] I love this level of transparency.

[15:46] You know, I think they've made something around 220 games.

[15:49] They have orders for around like 750.

[15:52] And when I saw that, it was interesting because I said to myself,

[15:55] okay, all right, that's not bad.

[15:56] Right?

[15:57] This is their first game.

[15:58] It also showed me that they might have just overestimated demand.

[16:03] Right?

[16:04] I mean, this game has been out for a while now.

[16:06] Right?

[16:06] And they're slowly trickling them out.

[16:08] But this game is slowly becoming yesterday's news.

[16:12] And this is what's hard in marketing.

[16:13] Right?

[16:13] For the longest time, these games on reveal day,

[16:17] they would sell all the ones they needed to sell.

[16:19] Right?

[16:19] Rick and Morty, 750, sold out instantly.

[16:22] You know, games like TNA,

[16:24] they sold pretty quickly, 500, sold pretty quickly.

[16:27] During COVID, everything was just selling out instantly.

[16:30] But now it's different, right?

[16:31] And think about it if you're barrels of fun.

[16:33] Your game's been out for a while, slowly trickling them out.

[16:36] So every month, your game gets a little bit older.

[16:39] Demandford gets a little bit lighter.

[16:41] How are you going to sell 400 more of these games?

[16:45] Right?

[16:45] It's really hard to do that.

[16:47] But I think from the very get-go, they said they might just cap how many they make

[16:51] based on how many orders they get.

[16:53] And I think that's something they might want to think about soon.

[16:56] And they said we will be able to make all of these games by the end of the year.

[17:00] But man, I don't think they're going to get to 1,100 made.

[17:02] And that's not bad if you're an owner.

[17:05] But it also just goes to show you where we're at.

[17:07] Right?

[17:08] Where we're at.

[17:08] You got to pick the right theme.

[17:10] Is Labyrinth the right theme to sell 1,100 units?

[17:12] No.

[17:13] It's again, it's a theme that they really wanted to make.

[17:15] David Van Ness loves this theme.

[17:18] If I was the marketing director over at barrels of fun,

[17:21] this isn't where I would have started.

[17:23] I guarantee you, Canada would have picked a theme that would have had a weak one sell

[17:27] out of 1,100 games.

[17:29] Right?

[17:29] I'm just assuming that we would have made a good game.

[17:32] I'm assuming that the toys would be good.

[17:33] The artwork would be good.

[17:34] But just on theme alone, I would have picked a theme that even without seeing it,

[17:39] you would have sold 700 units.

[17:41] I'm just saying, that's the job of marketing to get enough people out the door.

[17:46] Then it's the job of the engineering department to make good on the demand that I create it for you.

[17:52] And that's why John Wick doesn't work.

[17:54] Like John Wick, I don't have a problem with John Wick.

[17:56] I love the movies.

[17:57] But when the marketing department picks that game, you don't have like 5,000 people lined up to buy an LE.

[18:04] Now, if you have Ghostbusters, you do.

[18:06] If you have Back to the Future, you do.

[18:08] If you have Die Hard, you do.

[18:10] But not John Wick.

[18:11] And so you don't even have that many people lined up at the door, and then you make 1,000 of them.

[18:15] And then you charge 13,000.

[18:17] And all of a sudden, you open up the door, there's only like 117 people excited to buy

[18:22] that game at that price.

[18:24] And what does Stern do now?

[18:25] How do you find 850 more buyers?

[18:27] You send George Gomez on a damage control tour.

[18:31] You call up all your distro content creators who show your products every single launch,

[18:36] and you get them to make as much as they can.

[18:37] And it doesn't work.

[18:38] It just doesn't work, because we're all just talking to each other.

[18:41] It's a really small community.

[18:43] And everybody knows this.

[18:44] Like when we start to smell now, that something is a financial disaster if we buy it.

[18:50] Now we're staying as far away from it as possible.

[18:53] See, I think Venom was the last game that people would dip their toe in the water,

[18:58] but no longer.

[18:59] It's over.

[19:00] Winter is here.

[19:02] The lake is frozen over.

[19:04] And people are about to crash through thin ice if they buy John Wick LE.

[19:09] And they're trying to get Canadian to stop talking like this.

[19:12] They're trying.

[19:13] People, trust me, they're trying really hard.

[19:16] They're trying to fall back on like,

[19:17] shouldn't we just be talking about the gameplay, the gameplay, and how much fun pinball is?

[19:23] And let's just ignore that if you bought every Stern LE over the last like three years,

[19:28] you lost $15,000.

[19:31] Let's just ignore that and make me more money because I'm a salesman and you should trust me.

[19:37] No, you should trust Canadian pinball podcast on Pat Leave.

[19:41] This is going to get dangerous.

[19:42] I could start to do shows every day.

[19:44] I'm feeling triggered.

[19:46] And now that I don't have my other job hanging over me every day,

[19:50] I'm really thinking about what's happening in pinball.

[19:52] And you don't want me to use my private school, boarding school education on this hobby,

[19:59] because I will run circles around all these people that are not seeing the forest for the trees.

[20:05] People, welcome to Canadian pinball podcast for all you newbies out there.

[20:09] We're almost at 700 club members.

[20:11] I love it.

[20:11] This show is just going to keep getting better and better and better and just waited out

[20:16] winter is here, people.

[20:17] You're going to get the best deals ever in 11,000 new inbox.

[20:22] John Wick LE is just the beginning.

[20:25] We're going to force Stern and Jersey Jack to lower these prices.

[20:29] It's going to happen.

[20:30] And it's starting right here right now later.

[20:45] I had an Instagram.
