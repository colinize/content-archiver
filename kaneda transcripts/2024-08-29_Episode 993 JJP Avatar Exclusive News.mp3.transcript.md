[00:00] I'm going back someday, come what may, to Blue Ball.

[00:07] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:11] Ah, welcome everybody to the world's most prolific pinball podcaster, your host with the most

[00:18] canada.

[00:19] Going back to Blue by you, I have some exclusive information about Jersey Jack pinballs avatar

[00:26] pinball, which I am hearing by the way, they're going to reveal this pinball machine like

[00:32] within the next two weeks, maybe even next week.

[00:37] Stern pinball has really slept on this X-Men reveal, the month of Marvel did not pan out,

[00:45] and I'm loving this, like these pinball companies now are realizing you gotta move, and you

[00:51] gotta get people stuff, and you gotta get people excited.

[00:54] I don't know about you, but I'm excited about this, that people are actually starting to

[00:59] do different things.

[01:02] Dutch pinball X has been giving us teasers of Alice's adventures in Wonderland, and what

[01:08] harm does that cause?

[01:09] This is what we want.

[01:10] I don't know why anybody who's a fan of pinball loves the old way of doing it, we're like,

[01:16] we're kept in the dark, and then we're all shoved into like this FOMO room in which we

[01:21] have to buy a game in one day, and we have no information, we haven't seen anything on

[01:26] the game, and everything just hits at once.

[01:29] I think if you're going to work on a game for a year, for two years, like don't just

[01:34] shove it out in one instant, give it some breathing room, and now we're seeing Jersey

[01:41] Jack pinball get into the ring before Stern, and it's going to be avatar versus X-Men versus

[01:49] Alice versus Spooky's new game this winter fall, it's going to get really exciting in

[01:56] pinball.

[01:57] And I just want to say this right now, I know a lot of people want to be angry, right?

[02:03] You want to be angry with these companies, and I get it, nobody likes these high prices,

[02:08] nobody.

[02:09] Like there's nobody out there that's like, it's awesome man, that pinball prices went

[02:13] up this high, because none of us are investors in these companies, right?

[02:18] This is not like Nvidia stock where I own a share of Stern, and if their margins go

[02:24] through the roof and they sell at this much money, I'm going to see a return on that investment.

[02:30] In fact, it's been the complete opposite.

[02:33] If you went in on these high priced games, you've absolutely been slaughtered on the

[02:37] second hand market.

[02:39] Did you see what Godfather's CEs are going for now?

[02:43] $8,500.

[02:44] $8,500.

[02:47] That is a loss of what?

[02:49] Like $6,500 people have lost on this game in basically a year and a half, and it's just

[02:57] going to get worse because when Avatar comes out, you know what's going to happen?

[03:02] The demand for Elton John is going to die instantly.

[03:06] Nobody even had demand for the Godfather.

[03:08] Toy Story 4, good luck selling that game.

[03:11] So it's a brave new world of pinball.

[03:14] And at these prices, these companies need to realize they are competing with each other.

[03:20] And it almost doesn't even matter anymore if you're a boutique, if you're a big company

[03:25] like Stern or Jersey Jack, it doesn't matter.

[03:28] You're competing for $10,000 to $15,000.

[03:32] You're competing for someone's real estate in their game room, and so you got to figure

[03:37] out how to get people excited about your game.

[03:41] Now it's easier for the boutiques because if I only have to sell 500 games, it's a lot

[03:47] easier for me to figure out how to sell that many games.

[03:51] So I'm going to tell you right now, if you want an Alice, they most likely are going

[03:56] to bring no more than 300 Alice's to America.

[04:01] That's not a lot, right?

[04:03] That's not a lot.

[04:04] That's only six per state if you break it down like that.

[04:07] And that's the most they'll ever bring over here.

[04:10] If demand is really big in Europe and in Australia and they get orders over there, the point

[04:15] being is this, there's not going to be many.

[04:17] There will always be more total nuclear annihilations in the world than Alice.

[04:24] So we shall see, right?

[04:25] It's going to be interesting.

[04:26] And I think we're going to see that game in just a few weeks.

[04:30] We are going to see Jersey Jack's avatar in just a few days.

[04:34] And we're going to see Stern Pinball's X-Men like any day now.

[04:37] I think we're going to get the teaser tomorrow.

[04:39] I think Stern thinks it's being cheeky waiting until the last possible moment in the month

[04:45] of Marvel to drop the game.

[04:47] And I don't think they were expecting Jersey Jack to make a move.

[04:51] I think the Jersey Jack move is really smart because if you think about it, remember when

[04:55] Foo Fighter came out before Godfather and snaked everybody.

[05:00] And that was Jack Danger's first game.

[05:02] I don't think they're going to let them do that.

[05:04] Do I think there's going to be games in boxes the day they reveal it?

[05:08] No.

[05:09] I don't think they're going to show the game any day now.

[05:11] So here's the thing.

[05:12] Here's what I'm hearing.

[05:13] I am hearing that Avatar, I am hearing that Mark Sidon's avatar is going to be very blue.

[05:21] And that is not like an exclusive if you're making an avatar game, but you're going to

[05:25] look down at this game and it is fully lit up in its UV glory.

[05:30] So if you like the UV and stranger things, you are going to see most likely the most

[05:37] lit up and blue machine ever.

[05:40] And this thing's going to glow like no other in a game room.

[05:44] Here's a bit of exclusive information you haven't heard anywhere else.

[05:50] Jersey Jack pinball's avatar pinball machine will be the complete opposite of Pulp Fiction.

[05:57] And what I mean by that is not going to be a single level game.

[06:02] This game is going to have, are you sitting down?

[06:07] It is going to feature six ramps.

[06:11] Six, not two, not one, not zero, but six ramps will be in avatar pinball.

[06:20] I heard the flow is fast and fun.

[06:24] I heard Steve Ritchie had an impact on the layout of this game.

[06:28] I also heard that there are too many play fields that are part of this game.

[06:34] So six ramps, too many play fields, a lot of speed, a lot of blue, a lot of UV light,

[06:42] a lot of Pandora.

[06:44] So there you go, everybody.

[06:46] I also heard, and I'm not happy to report this, but this is just expected.

[06:52] They're going to make 1000 collectors editions of this game.

[06:59] I don't know why nobody in pinball can actually address the issue of we're making too many

[07:06] LEs, we're making too many CEs.

[07:09] It's just got to stop.

[07:11] And I mean that like the avatar demand, I don't think is there for 1000.

[07:17] And again, yes, you can make 1000, but should you?

[07:21] And for some reason, Stern and Jersey Jack are in this like standoff where nobody wants

[07:27] to reduce the numbers of their limited versions of their games.

[07:31] I don't get it.

[07:32] We know they're not going to roll back their prices, but the other way to give the consumer

[07:36] value is just roll back the amount you're going to make.

[07:40] And if there's only going to be 300 Alice's in America, all of a sudden it's feeling

[07:45] like, hey, if you want something different, that's the way to go.

[07:50] Think about it, like 1964 Scooby-Doo's.

[07:53] Right, why did we do that, spooky?

[07:56] That was actually not a bad Scooby-Doo voice.

[07:58] I should do a whole show in Scooby-Doo, right?

[08:00] I should break the most exclusive pinball news in Canada's Scooby-Doo voice.

[08:06] I won't do it right now.

[08:07] I won't torture you.

[08:08] Or maybe I wouldn't.

[08:10] All right, so we've got 1000 avatars, lots of blue, six ramps.

[08:15] The price is going to remain the same.

[08:17] And we're going to see the game in like a week or two.

[08:20] So that is very exciting because I think within two weeks, mid-September, we will have a

[08:26] lot more of Stern's X-Men, Jersey Jack's Avatar, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[08:33] And so all of a sudden, doesn't it feel like, how many of you out there, show of hands?

[08:37] How many of you out there don't really want to pay the remainder of your Pulp Fiction

[08:41] LE?

[08:42] I don't even care about Pulp Fiction LE anymore.

[08:44] I get it.

[08:45] I get it.

[08:46] It just feels two years old.

[08:47] I've already moved on from it.

[08:49] I've played the game a bunch at locations and I just don't want to get one.

[08:54] There's so much more new and exciting stuff happening in Bimbal.

[08:58] It just goes to show you, you got to strike while the iron is hot.

[09:01] And there's nothing hot anymore about Pulp Fiction because think about like, all these

[09:05] people are going to unbox it and be like, look, here's the game that's been out for

[09:08] a year now.

[09:09] And I just have a different topper.

[09:11] Same exact game.

[09:12] No new experience, no new thing to show.

[09:15] All you're getting is this plastic topper of the dance sequence in the game.

[09:20] And that's it, right?

[09:21] There's really nothing else that's going to separate and make a wow moment happen when

[09:26] people get their bad mofo editions of Pulp Fiction.

[09:29] And so that's where we're at.

[09:31] I think we're right on the eve of so much about to drop.

[09:36] It's going to be fun covering all of it.

[09:40] And I love doing these snippet shows for you guys because this is how it should be.

[09:45] I get it.

[09:46] There's other long form versions of content, but I wanted to tell each and every one of

[09:49] you this.

[09:51] My new goal moving forward is to work a little bit more with these manufacturers to get you

[09:57] information, to get you photos, to get you some exclusives, and then let's deconstruct

[10:03] what we get.

[10:04] I think there's a way to be fair and critical without being like overly negative.

[10:10] And I mean that.

[10:11] Like we shouldn't be in this hobby if what happens in pinball triggers us to the point

[10:17] where we're physically upset.

[10:19] Like our health should not suffer because of what a pinball company does.

[10:23] I look at all of it like this.

[10:26] It's just going to take pure magic to get most of us to buy any of these games.

[10:31] FOMO is dead.

[10:32] The only way I'm going to go in on a game is if the game has all the magic.

[10:36] I'm going to tell you right now, I'm waiting for Back to the Future.

[10:39] It's going to be a while.

[10:40] Back to the Future is not going to be out anytime soon.

[10:43] It is coming out next year.

[10:45] But if you're waiting on Back to the Future, you're going to have a long wait.

[10:49] So you might be waiting over a year to get it.

[10:52] So I would look at these games that are coming out now as things that you should consider

[10:55] as options.

[10:57] But look, everyone's fed up with the pricing.

[11:00] Everyone is fed up with the too many LEDs.

[11:02] The whole collectability feels like it's dead.

[11:04] So now it's kind of good because now we're kind of looking at all these games and we're

[11:09] looking at it through the right lens again.

[11:12] Is this game magical?

[11:14] Is this game creating a pinball experience like no other?

[11:18] And for those of you saying like, Avatar sucks, Avatar this, Avatar that, and yes, I would

[11:22] not have picked Avatar.

[11:23] But how many people out there absolutely cannot stand Iron Maiden music but love Iron Maiden

[11:30] pinball?

[11:31] And that's the point is there's always a chance, right?

[11:33] How many people out there like can't stand Elton John as a theme but are absolutely loving

[11:38] the game?

[11:39] And that's the thing about what's about to happen is you're going to have to keep an

[11:43] open mind because the last thing you should do as a pinball fan is write off a game before

[11:49] you see it, before you play it, and before you know how it makes you feel.

[11:56] Our love for pinball is a little bit like that show love is blind.

[12:01] You know what I'm saying?

[12:02] Like you got to go into each encounter with an open mind and you might fall in love with

[12:07] something and some game and someone who isn't quite what you expected.

[12:13] And that's a story for life and it is a story for pinball.

[12:17] Everybody more to come.

[12:18] I'm super excited as you can tell.

[12:19] A lot's about to happen in this hobby in just a short amount of time.

[12:22] And you know you're going to hear it here first.

[12:24] I'm in my garage.

[12:25] It's early in the morning.

[12:26] I've been up early.

[12:28] I've been talking to Melvin in the Netherlands at 4.30 my time.

[12:31] Great conversations with him.

[12:33] I can't wait to share more about Alice with you.

[12:35] Trust me, I'm trying to get you more.

[12:37] The more you see, I think the more you're going to get excited.

[12:40] Everybody have a great day.

[12:41] We'll talk to you soon.

[12:42] I'll never be blue.

[12:43] My dreams come true on blue.

[12:44] Blue.

[12:45] Blue.

[12:46] Blue.

[12:47] Blue.
