[00:00] It's time to give that whip a crack, I'm gonna have the senior factor, BITSCODE!

[00:09] BITSCODE!

[00:13] CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR

[00:17] BOOM!

[00:17] Okay, so let me get this straight. The Queen passes away, and the three pinball machines that are being revealed to the world right now are all British properties.

[00:29] Spinal Tap, James Bond, and Queen Pinball by the Pinball Brothers. What weird timing that all of this is happening at once,

[00:37] but today we saw another pinball reveal!

[00:41] There's been two new pinball machines revealed in one week, and we get to see home pins version of Spinal Tap.

[00:49] I'm looking at it right now. Now, here's how I want to start. I want to start out by saying

[00:54] another weird reveal. They spent how many years making this game? Think about it people.

[01:00] How did Mike reveal this game to the world?

[01:03] He now has like just someone in a room as they're setting up for this Australian show, and now the photos are just being passed around,

[01:10] and I want to start here for a minute. I just want to say this. As a marketer, it absolutely

[01:15] pains me how bad this industry reveals products. It is as if these people don't

[01:23] understand how to use the internet. They don't understand how to use cameras. They don't understand how to build hype.

[01:31] They absolutely don't know what they're doing. And home pin is a company in which you need to build some hype and

[01:38] excitement for your product because I'll tell you why. The product itself needs it because I'm looking at it right now.

[01:44] And I'm gonna tell you right now my true feelings about this game. Look, I don't think it's terrible.

[01:49] It looks better than Thunderbirds, but it's

[01:53] 2022 everybody and Mike and everybody over at home pin. I mean it when I say it.

[01:58] You guys have to start taking some accountability on how you reveal your products to the world for the first time.

[02:04] And here's the biggest bonehead move out of all of this. They have one

[02:09] exclusive distributor in the United States. It's my friend Joe Newhart over at Pinball Star 1. And home pin released a flyer on

[02:17] this game to Joe Newhart and also to the community. And guess what? You can't even read the flyer itself.

[02:25] This is the sales flyer people and you zoom in on it and you can't even read the words.

[02:31] Everything is blurry and it looks like there's absolutely

[02:34] zero toys and zero true mechs in this game.

[02:38] I mean it looks like everything is just sculpts and little plastic guitars and that's what the flyer is calling out.

[02:45] But here's the part that really just like irks me. Are you telling me after like years of making this game Mike?

[02:51] Moving your company from China to Taiwan,

[02:55] you are going to put out a blurry flyer as your sales material to get people excited for this game.

[03:03] I just don't get it people. You know, look, I called it a Mickey Mouse operation the other day.

[03:07] It's more like a goofy operation.

[03:10] This is such amateur hour and I really think these companies should be embarrassed.

[03:15] They should totally be embarrassed that they're revealing their products to the world in such a pathetic way.

[03:22] Hey, news flash everybody. It's not

[03:25] 1994. You can't just usher your game into a room or a trade show like IAPA and it's secret.

[03:32] Right now there's something called cell phones and the internet and social media and all of this stuff is just going to get shared.

[03:38] And so why do you put in so much effort on building these products only to launch them in a way that is just piss poor is

[03:47] cheap and doesn't do your product justice?

[03:50] So I'm looking at the game right now and I'm looking at spinal tap and look I will say this like it looks like colorful

[03:57] It's got the three band members

[03:59] It's got like this big dial in the middle and then I looked at the dial and I'm like this dial

[04:05] Makes no sense the whole joke of the movie is that the dial goes all the way over to

[04:13] 11 like past 10 it doesn't have 11 in the middle of the dial

[04:18] And it's almost like I don't even need to look past that to realize that they don't really

[04:23] Understand the joke like how can you ruin that like that's so easy to get right anyway? I'm looking at this game right now

[04:30] We've got three miniature instruments. I think there's like a drum set looks like there's a cocoon

[04:35] It looks like there's a really flat stonehenge in the back and there's two ramps on the left side three pop bumpers

[04:41] Three drop targets, and then it looks like there might be like a buck on the right side

[04:46] There's a few spinners. There's a scoop on the left side right here, but it looks like a pretty basic fan layout

[04:52] Okay, so the game probably shoots better than Thunderbirds

[04:55] But I'm looking at this game right now, and I'm just saying to myself where are the toys in this game?

[05:01] How do you make a spinal tap game and not have stonehenge actually come down?

[05:07] How do you not have stonehenge appear somehow? Look this game is very pedestrian. There are no toys in this game

[05:15] There's nothing mechanically interesting in this game

[05:18] You know this to me looks like it's got less in it than James Bond pro

[05:22] You know I'm looking at the ramp on the left side

[05:25] Go look at the ramp zoom in on that ramp on the left side and you can see like all these little beady weld marks on it

[05:32] Like I don't know if this is still a prototype, but that does not look like it's fully polished

[05:37] You know the artwork is drag-and-drop. It's spinal tap. It is what it is

[05:41] You know I don't think any of us had high expectations for this game

[05:44] And then you've got the 27 inch screen, and you've got the orange DMD

[05:49] Don't get me started on using an orange DMD

[05:51] The reason why they're doing that is they obviously don't have money to pay a coder to create animations for the big screen

[05:58] So that is why they are using DMD technology that probably came out sometime in the

[06:03] 1980s. I don't think I've ever seen a game do this have like a DMD and an LCD like that

[06:08] So here's the deal with this game. There is only one way this game is gonna sell

[06:12] There's only one way this game is gonna sell and there's only one target audience for this game

[06:16] This game is only gonna sell if you're a diehard spinal tap fan first of all my condolences to you

[06:23] This is probably the last company you would want to make your dream theme

[06:27] But if you're a diehard fan you might consider it, but there is only one way this game can sell

[06:32] Do you know what it is? I bet you do the only way this game is gonna find buyers is if the price is right and here's the problem

[06:38] I think this game needs to be priced around the stern pro now if this game costs more than like

[06:45] $7,000 or 7500 I'm maybe max

[06:49] 7500 bucks there is no way they are gonna sell this game

[06:52] There is just no way if this thing gets anywhere near a stern premium cost good night

[06:59] It's over no one's shopping and that's it because pinball is so competitive now

[07:04] And if you want to get eight nine thousand dollars from people think about it right now if Mike wants to get eight nine thousand from people

[07:10] He's got to steal buyers away from James Bond premium and what about cactus Canyon?

[07:15] He's got to steal buyers away from Godzilla premium. He's got to steal buyers away from TNA 2.0

[07:21] He's got a lot of competition buyers away from Rush premium, right? There's a lot of competition

[07:26] So let's talk about it because like Rush was the other music pin that just came out

[07:30] And I'm just gonna say this if Mike comes in around eight or nine thousand dollars

[07:34] You can go get a guns and roses le

[07:37] I mean put a guns and roses le next to this machine and let's just stop the conversation

[07:41] You know, I mean guns and roses is fully featured fully loaded got so many more

[07:45] Meks in it and got upper play field and has much more going on in it than this pin clearly has and so look we knew it was coming

[07:52] It's out in the world now. We have two pinball machines to chew on in one week

[07:56] I think one is gonna be a ginormous hit and I think one is gonna be a huge flop

[08:02] Just because I don't think Mike is making a product that can compete with where pinball is these days

[08:07] I think he built this company to compete with pinball like six seven years ago

[08:11] But look at where pinball is gone. Look at all the options we have

[08:15] We've become a lot more discerning with our money because there's so many options now

[08:20] It's also bad timing. Just think about it from a marketing standpoint and your mic

[08:24] You're really gonna launch your game the same week stern pinballs launching James Bond

[08:29] Just think about that for a minute if there is any time you want to avoid your game

[08:33] I would avoid launching it when the biggest pinball company in the world is about to launch another UK

[08:40] Property with a lot more toys in it a lot more features and a lot more talent making the game Mike

[08:45] You should have released this thing four months ago

[08:47] You should have released this thing when stern had nothing new on the line

[08:51] You should have released this thing when Toy Story sales were flat and here we are we get this okay?

[08:56] So I'm done with home pin spinal tap. I'll talk more about it as we see the video and how they integrate it look

[09:02] I do like the movie. I just I just don't get it. I just don't get why Mike would go through all the effort

[09:07] I just don't get making a pinball company where you can't be competitive with what's in the marketplace

[09:12] The only way this can compete is if the price is right

[09:14] So we shall see believe me if Mike can sell this thing for seven thousand dollars

[09:19] He will find buyers if it's over eight thousand dollars. He's not gonna find buyers for this game

[09:24] I really do think people are gonna draw the line there alright

[09:26] What else is going on in pinball so spooky pinball has opened up the TNA sales to everybody that is good

[09:32] They are gonna sell all 250 eventually once they start making these and people start unboxing the new TNAs

[09:39] They're gonna sell the remainder of them

[09:41] So I'm not worried about spooky for those of you worried about them. Don't be worried about them

[09:45] They have enough Corvettes in the driveway now where you don't have to worry about spooky pinball

[09:49] So here's what I want to do

[09:50] I want to give you a little bit of a treat on this episode because I know you're not expecting it

[09:54] I'm gonna give you a canada confirmation on two things happening in the pinball world in the future that are gonna be

[10:00] Exciting before I do that

[10:02] I want to say that I'm also still on the record that this James Bond number four game is going to be a Keith

[10:08] Elwin street level design

[10:10] I really hope that I hit on this one because if canada is right with this Keith Elwin rumor

[10:15] It is absolutely gonna blow the minds off of everybody on pin side and everyone's gonna finally realize

[10:21] Hopefully once and for all why canada spinball podcast number one five years in a row and here's why we're the number one show

[10:28] It's not just because I'm entertaining. It's not just because I give you scoops nobody else will it's because I'll give you shows

[10:34] As the news is happening and that's what we're doing right now

[10:36] I'm gonna give you information that other shows know about but they won't tell you like that's the funny part

[10:42] They all have to be worried about their relationships with the manufacturers guess who I'm not worried about

[10:47] Relationships with manufacturers. I'm doing just fine with my relationship with Brenda and my baby boy Killian before I give you my canada

[10:54] Confirmation on two new things. I want to talk a little bit about the James Bond thread on pin side if you go into that thread

[11:00] It is a prime example of how embarrassing

[11:04] Pinsight has become these days Robin makes like over

[11:07] $300,000 a year to run pin side and it is a great form and a lot of what goes on there is great

[11:14] But where's the moderation?

[11:16] Why do they let people derail a thread about James Bond and start talking about

[11:22] Locism and then you get this idiotic battle and debate

[11:25] Can you call them Bond girls and I'm just an old white man and it's not me that's offended

[11:30] It's Gen Z kids everybody look do us a favor stop talking about politics stop talking about how rich you are

[11:37] Stop talking about what offends you stop talking about social issues. This is a pinball forum

[11:42] We go to pinball forums and we listen to pinball podcast because we want to escape from all of that garbage

[11:49] Leave that garbage out of the forum leave it out everybody and here's the thing if you want to say something

[11:56] And if you want to say something stupid and if you want to tell us how you really feel about

[12:00] Social issues and politics and all this stuff do us a favor when you post that

[12:05] Please provide a picture of yourself so we can see who we're talking to because it's really easy to be these keyboard

[12:12] Commandos and say the most ignorant stuff and then you don't even know who's on the other side of the keyboard

[12:18] And I guarantee you I've been to the pinball shows a lot of these guys don't want to show you who they are

[12:23] They love being these little keyboard commandos and they would be terrified to do what canada does

[12:28] They could never do Facebook lives and talk to you in real time

[12:31] No, they've got to hide behind pinside and I just want to say this Robin hire some moderators, bro

[12:36] And clean up your house because it's getting pretty disgusting. All right, but you don't care about pinside

[12:41] What you want to know are the two things canada has to tell you so I'm gonna confirm for you right now

[12:45] And I haven't seen it so this is weird

[12:47] I'm starting to do canada confirmations and a canada confirmation just means it's real to me

[12:52] So if it's real to me, I will just confirm it for you

[12:55] But I don't know a hundred percent if this is going to happen

[12:58] But I have very good sources that this stuff is going to occur

[13:02] So I am hearing that Eric Minier's next game is in fact the godfather and the artist for the game will be no other than

[13:10] Mr. Christopher Franci on art so this is gonna be really really sexy that Jersey Jack pinball is

[13:17] Going to have a Franci art package game. It's going to be godfather now. Here's the other interesting news

[13:24] I'm hearing I am hearing that toy story sales are not that great

[13:28] They're not as good as they thought they were going to be and because of that

[13:32] They have already started ordering parts for godfather and if toy story sales don't pick up

[13:37] They might reveal godfather by the end of the year. So look here's the thing

[13:43] I think they've already started ordering parts for the next game

[13:46] That just makes sense like you've got to order all these parts

[13:49] But I do believe that Jersey Jack pinball is in a pickle right now

[13:52] And I do think that toy story sales are not gonna pick up and I do think they're gonna need to think about getting the next game

[13:58] On the line. Okay. I also heard another thing. I heard that it is not Billy Joel

[14:02] I heard that Steve Richie's game is Elton John and Elton John is gonna be the game the music game that Steve Richie is working on

[14:09] I also heard that he wasn't super psyched to be working on Elton John

[14:13] But I don't know about that like that just feels that feels like someone just made that up

[14:16] I'm sure Steve Richie is happy to be working on the game. He's working on I just don't think this pinball community wants Elton John

[14:23] I feel like Elton John is like in his 80s. I don't know like Elton John has a great library of music

[14:29] Like I love Elton John music. I just don't want an Elton John machine. That's just me personally

[14:35] Guns and Roses was cool like guns and roses music is cool

[14:38] I think the demographic for pinball would much rather have guns and roses than Elton John and that's just it

[14:44] I think for this to work

[14:46] I think they're gonna have to go do more of like a 70s Elton John and make it look kind of throwback because that would be kind of cool

[14:51] If Jersey Jack pinball made a retro looking machine

[14:54] I just wouldn't do current day Elton John like I don't want to see current Elton John concerts

[14:59] I mean at some point we got to stop we've got to stop with these musicians that are just like well past their prime

[15:05] We've got Frenchie on art with Eric's godfather

[15:08] We've got Steve Richie making Elton John and here's the other crazy thing

[15:12] We're also about to get two more Christopher Frenchie pins out in the world

[15:17] One of them is gonna be Dennis Nordman's game with American pinball. We are gonna see some of that in a couple weeks

[15:23] They're gonna tease it somehow at the tailgating party. I think it's gonna be that like galactic tank game

[15:28] Can it is on the record for saying they're gonna make the cabinet of the pinball machine look like a tank

[15:33] Yeah, and apparently when you fold the head down the whole thing looks like a tank

[15:37] I don't know what that means are there gonna be tracks instead of legs

[15:40] I don't know but it's gonna be Dennis Nordman original IP a tank game with Christopher Frenchie on artwork

[15:48] And then the other thing that's happening probably this year

[15:51] We're also gonna see CGC release pulp fiction a single level game with a lot of subways

[15:58] There's no screen in the game

[15:59] It's gonna have the old-school number reels like in games from the 70s and 60s

[16:03] So think about that pulp fiction no screen, which means no clips from the movie whatsoever

[16:09] Really weird, but on artwork on pulp fiction is going to be no other than Christopher

[16:15] Franchi so Christopher Franchi who I think is one of the greatest pinball artists in the world

[16:19] And I really think stern pinball needs to get him back after looking at James Bond now

[16:24] We'll see if this works because his art style is so distinctive

[16:27] It's gonna be kind of strange seeing him on three companies that are competing with each other. It is bonkers

[16:34] We've never seen this before we have never seen an artist have three games in a fiscal year

[16:39] On different companies products. I mean that is what is happening and you're hearing it here at canada's pinball podcast

[16:45] I think all of this is gonna come true

[16:47] I think we're gonna see the street level game from Keith L when James Bond's 60th anniversary

[16:51] The last thing I'll leave you with is this people

[16:53] I am hearing stern is gonna have a price increase that is probably more than we would want it to be on James Bond

[17:00] So don't be surprised if the James Bond le is not a thousand dollars more than rush le

[17:07] I'm hearing it might be that high people so get ready stern knows what they're doing

[17:12] And I'm hearing the reason why stern is raising their prices is they consider their product to be superior

[17:18] Than Jersey Jack pinball's product

[17:20] So thank you once again Jersey Jack pinball for raising pinball prices

[17:25] Showing everyone what the roof is and then making all of us pay more for stuff

[17:29] I mean you can't blame them

[17:31] You know all of you guys out there have been throwing your money at these products for so long now these companies

[17:36] Were bound to catch on it is a total mistake for these companies to try to sell their product at the flipper price

[17:42] It is not gonna last forever

[17:44] And I think a lot of these companies they're gonna price themselves out of pinball

[17:49] The only reason stern can get away with it is because they can get you the product right away

[17:54] People are gonna get sick and tired of writing checks to guys like Jerry Stelenberg and then waiting forever to get the game

[18:00] Like that's not gonna happen

[18:02] They're gonna get tired of writing checks to people like Haggis and waiting forever to get the game

[18:06] Stern is gonna win even though they know they're ripping you off a little bit

[18:10] You're not gonna care because you're gonna get the product in a timely manner and that's so important

[18:15] This entire hobby runs on FOMO and that is why it's gonna be interesting because the James Bond FOMO gets weaker and weaker

[18:23] Every day that goes on you really wanted to reveal the game and take orders in a 48 hour window

[18:30] We've never seen stern do this

[18:31] We've never seen stern have images of their new game and they're not taking orders like this is burning them

[18:37] This is the worst thing you can have is have your product out there and you can't even take people's money

[18:43] But I have faith in James Bond. I think the more we see of the game and the more we see the game in action

[18:48] I think people are gonna really want this game everybody. Happy Friday

[18:51] I hope you enjoy canada spin ball podcast and for those of you new members out there

[18:56] You know look I went off a little bit on home pin

[18:58] But I hope you enjoy this show. It's always gonna be entertaining

[19:01] I will get you shows on a timely manner and think about how expensive pinball is and this is the best bang for the buck in

[19:08] All of pinball and do me a favor invite a friend

[19:11] I know I asked you guys last time you all have a pinball friend

[19:15] That is not a member of the canada club do me a favor tell them I got you an early Christmas gift this year

[19:22] I got you a subscription to canada's pinball podcast. It's $60 for the year

[19:27] I mean that is nothing everybody. Thank you so much be good and I'll talk to you tomorrow on my Saturday morning spectacular

[19:54] Good girl
