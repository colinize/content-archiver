[00:00] Man, it made me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries.

[00:03] Got a crib with a studio in the softener drags.

[00:06] To add to the ball for the clocks.

[00:07] Hanging up in the office and back in my house like trophy.

[00:15] Welcome everybody to episode 551 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:20] I'm your host, Canada, and here's what I want to do on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:24] I just want to drop some truth out into the world and to you listeners of the show.

[00:30] First I want to say thank you to everyone who listens to Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:34] because for some of you you've listened to this show from episode 1 all the way up to 551.

[00:40] And during that journey, not that I would have used my free time that way, but you guys did.

[00:45] During that journey you do get to know me, the host Chris, Canada, as your go to Pinball Podcast

[00:52] or on a weekly basis.

[00:54] Now you also have other shows that you listen to, I do as well.

[00:57] We love the fact that there's a lot of pinball content creators out there that give us free

[01:02] content on a weekly basis that taps into this hobby that we all love.

[01:07] Now you might hear my voice as a little sore, it's a little raspy, it's a little drained,

[01:12] and I want to explain why.

[01:14] It was December 24th and we were getting ready to go home to see my parents and give them

[01:20] their Christmas gifts.

[01:22] And I always love giving back to my parents because they have given so much to me over

[01:26] the years.

[01:27] And so right before we were going down, it was December 24th, Brenda wasn't feeling the

[01:32] best.

[01:33] So I recommended that the both of us go get tested for COVID-19.

[01:38] And I went to the garage and I got my Honda Civic and I'm heading back to the city to pick

[01:43] up Brenda.

[01:44] And she called me crying hysterically that she had tested positive for COVID-19.

[01:50] And so I also got rapid tested.

[01:52] And here's the crazy part, my wife who I am next to every day, all day long, because

[01:57] we've been quarantining together ever since this whole thing happened.

[02:01] She tested positive and I tested negative for COVID-19.

[02:06] Now because she tested positive, they told me that I should behave as if I have it because

[02:12] we live together.

[02:13] And so the both of us have been basically quarantining since December 24th.

[02:19] Now, she is doing okay.

[02:21] I mean, we were really, really upset because obviously Brenda is far along in her pregnancy.

[02:27] We did not want to catch COVID-19 with a baby on the way.

[02:31] And I'll say this, we did everything that you're supposed to do to prevent yourself from

[02:35] catching this thing.

[02:36] We barely ever went out.

[02:38] If we ever did eat out, we were always six feet apart.

[02:41] We were always outdoors.

[02:43] But we barely, barely, barely went out and did anything.

[02:46] And even by barely going out, we still caught it.

[02:49] And we have no idea where we got it.

[02:50] We have no idea who gave it to us.

[02:53] It could have been in the elevator of our building.

[02:55] It could have been walking down the street and you touched something.

[02:58] It could have been when we had a drop off something at UPS.

[03:01] You just don't know.

[03:02] You start to sort of go down the chain of all the different things you did and what could

[03:06] have led to it.

[03:08] And ultimately, all we could do is accept the fact that we have it and we're going to do

[03:13] everything we can to get through it.

[03:15] And luckily Brenda did not have really severe symptoms.

[03:18] She felt under the weather for a while.

[03:20] She did lose her taste and her smell for a few days, but that has returned.

[03:24] And I was completely fine.

[03:26] The entire time she was experiencing symptoms.

[03:30] And then after she started to feel good, then all of a sudden, this thing just knocked

[03:34] me out for the last like four days.

[03:36] So the last four days I have just been with aches, with chills, with cold sweats at night,

[03:43] no fever, luckily, no shortness of breath.

[03:46] But it really did kick my ass.

[03:48] And I'm starting to feel a little bit better right now.

[03:51] And I'll say this, it is real.

[03:54] You can get it.

[03:55] And even when you take precautions, there really isn't much you can do because every time

[04:01] you step outside, especially in some place like New York City, it really is just a roll

[04:06] of the dice.

[04:07] But I'm here to tell you, I might not be doing as many shows over the next couple of

[04:12] weeks as I recover from this thing.

[04:15] I'm not sure how long it's going to take for me to get out of the woods.

[04:19] Unfortunately, it's not the best time because I'm going back to work right now.

[04:23] And work is ramping up really quickly after the new year.

[04:26] And I've got to jump in because with a baby on the way, I need to get ahead of as much

[04:30] work as possible because once the baby comes, I'll also be taking some time off for paternity

[04:36] leave.

[04:37] So if you don't know anyone who has COVID-19, now your favorite pinball podcaster, can

[04:41] me to has COVID-19.

[04:42] And I'm going to preemptively thank all of you for your support as I go through this.

[04:47] Okay.

[04:48] Now, being in this tired state that I'm in, I just wanted to say a few things that have

[04:52] also been adding to my fatigue and my headaches of late in the pinball world.

[04:58] Having covered pinball for over four years, having been selected three years in a row by

[05:03] you, the fans as your favorite pinball podcaster, you would think at this point I would have a

[05:08] little respect from the other people that are my peers in the pinball podcasting world.

[05:13] And you know me, I don't do a show about other people's shows.

[05:16] I don't do a show talking about content creators.

[05:20] But for some reason, there just seems to be a never ending negative slander campaign going

[05:26] on.

[05:27] And I'm just going to say names by the super awesome pinball show who constantly now is putting

[05:33] up negative stuff about Canada on their page.

[05:36] And look, I know what they're doing.

[05:38] I know they want me to bring attention to this.

[05:41] So here you go, Mr. Franchi, you have my attention.

[05:44] And I want to say two things to all of this.

[05:47] If you're man enough to put up negative stuff about me on your Facebook page, that's cool.

[05:53] Now what's not cool is this.

[05:55] Then he goes and he bans me from his page.

[05:58] So I can't comment or defend myself on his own Facebook page.

[06:03] So that's pretty lame.

[06:04] If you're going to pick a fight, at least stay in the fight a little bit or give someone

[06:08] a chance to like, retort you a little bit.

[06:11] But here's the other part.

[06:12] Here's the other part.

[06:13] I would like to officially invite Mr. Christopher Franchi and Mr. Christian Line, either one of

[06:18] them, both of them at the same time, anytime they want to come on my show and let's have

[06:23] a conversation about pinball.

[06:25] I think it would be a cordial conversation.

[06:28] If there's any hatchets we want to bury, let's just get it out in public because I am just

[06:32] getting so tired of this non-stop negativity that he keeps putting out in the pinball world.

[06:39] And he keeps saying he's taking the high road.

[06:41] But I'm here to call you out.

[06:43] You're not taking the high road.

[06:44] I see all the negative stuff you're saying about canada.

[06:47] People are sharing it with me and you're doing it in a cowardly way.

[06:50] You're doing it on pinball enthusiast page, which you know I can't read.

[06:54] And so why don't we just bury the hatchet?

[06:56] You do your show.

[06:57] I appreciate the show as you do.

[06:59] I appreciate the interviews you put out in the world.

[07:02] And I don't talk negatively about your interviews at all.

[07:04] In fact, I always call attention to them.

[07:06] I always give credit where credit's due.

[07:08] But the constant negativity, if that's what you think you need to do to win a twippy and

[07:13] stoop to that level, it's getting really sad.

[07:16] And I invite you on the show to let's air out whatever grievances we have and let's

[07:20] move forward.

[07:21] Because the other part I want to say is this.

[07:24] The reason why people listen to pinball podcasts are for the personalities and all of us out

[07:29] there.

[07:30] And I know almost everyone out there who has a pinball podcast, we all have distinct personalities.

[07:35] We all are distinct individuals.

[07:37] And it's not worth it to tear each other down to just prop yourself up.

[07:42] And we're not in this.

[07:43] And I mean this, we're not in this to break the pinball news to the world.

[07:48] For some reason this has become the main highlight of everything.

[07:51] It's breaking news in pinball.

[07:54] Everybody out there is smart enough to know that there's not a lot of pinball news.

[07:59] There's not.

[08:00] You're not going to get real news out of people when you interview them.

[08:03] They're not going to drop bombshells.

[08:04] They're not going to reveal games before they're ready to reveal games.

[08:07] I mean, that is why people always love listening to Canadian speculate about what's next.

[08:14] I mean, yeah, I told people Hot Wheels was Hot Wheels months before they wanted anyone

[08:18] to know that.

[08:19] We broke the news that October Fest was coming out well before they announced it.

[08:23] I broke the news that I was Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle before spooky wanted to

[08:27] do that.

[08:28] Look, let's forget about all those exclusives that Canadian has because it doesn't matter,

[08:33] man.

[08:34] I just, I really wish people would know this.

[08:35] All this news is worthless.

[08:38] It's worthless.

[08:39] This isn't why people listen to pinball podcasts.

[08:43] They're here to be entertained.

[08:45] They're here to chuckle and to laugh and to actually tune in to someone who even knows

[08:50] a few things about the very hobby they're into.

[08:53] And that's it.

[08:54] That's the only reason why and the reason why Canadian's pinball podcast has popular following

[09:00] is because we're not in anyone's back pocket.

[09:03] I can tell you that Led Zeppelin artwork sucks because I don't care to get Greg Ferris

[09:07] on this show.

[09:08] I don't care to get Zombie Eddie on the show.

[09:11] I don't care if Stern's mad at me.

[09:13] I will tell you that Led Zeppelin is one of the most uninspired lack of creative games

[09:18] I've ever seen and that band deserved more.

[09:22] Now if I wanted to get Steve Richie on, I couldn't just tell you that.

[09:26] And that's why people vote for Canada.

[09:28] It's not just because of the news.

[09:30] And I think it's great that other shows break news and have exclusives because it does

[09:34] the job for me.

[09:35] Then I just get to give you my commentary on that news.

[09:38] But that's it.

[09:39] That's how it's always been.

[09:41] It's always been this cycle of sometimes you have the news sometimes you don't.

[09:45] But you don't insult people.

[09:46] You don't try to prop yourself up.

[09:48] I mean, come on.

[09:49] Alright, let's get back to talking about pinball.

[09:51] That's the one time a year.

[09:52] I'm going to talk about pinball media topics.

[09:54] Maybe it's the COVID in me.

[09:55] Maybe that's one of the side effects and symptoms is you will have a fever.

[09:59] You will have nausea.

[10:00] And you will talk about pinball media even though you don't want to.

[10:04] So let's talk about American pinball and the interview they did in which they announced

[10:08] that Dennis Nordman and three junior designers were joining AP.

[10:12] Now on my last show, I was pretty gushing about how this was good news and how this was,

[10:17] he's the new George Gomez of American pinball.

[10:20] And I've been thinking a little bit about this and I listened to the interview again.

[10:24] And I didn't notice that David came across as pretty smug, a little arrogant, throwing

[10:29] shade on all of the pinball media.

[10:32] Why is this guy coming out of the gate with so much to prove like I have nothing to prove

[10:37] as Canadian pinball podcasts.

[10:39] Zach Manie has nothing to prove over at the pinball show.

[10:42] You know, poor man's pinball podcast has nothing to prove.

[10:45] Nobody in the pinball media has anything to prove.

[10:48] Why are they coming out of the gate sort of like throwing shade on the pinball media

[10:52] when the only person or the only company that really has something to prove is American

[10:58] pinball.

[10:59] They've had three chances to make a great game and they've yet to have any sales success.

[11:07] So this is a good move that Dennis Nordman is coming over there and helping them try

[11:12] to steer this ship in the right direction.

[11:15] And I did feel like he was flexing on us, like right, like he's flexing on the community.

[11:19] And all of a sudden I was like, is it time to start flexing on us?

[11:23] Have you done anything yet?

[11:25] And the more I think about their strategy of one license and one unlicensed game a year

[11:31] or doing a mix between the two, the more I started to see the cracks in that strategy,

[11:37] I just don't think there's any way for American pinball to successfully launch unlicensed

[11:44] games unless they do one thing.

[11:46] They need to make those unlicensed games limited number runs.

[11:51] Like I mean like really limited numbers.

[11:53] I mean like only 250 of these are going to be made maybe 500 at most.

[12:00] But you can't sell 6, 7, 800 of an unlicensed theme in 2021.

[12:07] Not with what Stern and Jersey Jack and Chicago gaming and everyone else has coming out.

[12:13] It's just not going to work for them.

[12:15] The other thing I was wondering about is timing and I've noticed this in the pinball industry

[12:19] is that a lot of companies want to get credit for their intentions.

[12:24] And they want to do somewhat of a victory lap before they've even shown us they can get

[12:29] it done.

[12:30] Now right now nobody knows if this new AP team can get it done.

[12:35] People do feel better that Joe Balser has been pushed aside and Dennis Nordman is in

[12:40] the lead designer chair right now.

[12:43] Now Dennis Nordman has been all over the place and he tends to leave before things get

[12:48] finished.

[12:49] But I do think that AP with their history of manufacturing is the right home for Dennis

[12:55] Nordman.

[12:56] I think if there's any place where he can have a positive impact it is at American pinball.

[13:00] But the question then becomes is when is Dennis's impact going to be felt?

[13:05] I mean he's brand new over there.

[13:07] So are they going to bring on junior designers that already have games designed and they're

[13:12] going to make those first?

[13:14] I did hear a rumor that Scott from Riot pinball was going over there and might be bringing

[13:18] one of his titles with him to be made at American pinball.

[13:22] Now I was told by people over to American pinball that that is not true because I had a post

[13:28] that I put up and they said take it down.

[13:30] So maybe then we can scratch Scott from Riot pinball off of the junior designer list because

[13:36] what I had said and this is Michael Grant over at AP said it's false and to take it down

[13:40] was that Scott was coming out with legends of Valhalla via American pinball.

[13:45] But if you remember what Dave said he said these are going to be names you know.

[13:49] So who else could it be that's a junior designer that we don't know?

[13:53] I mean they must be grabbing people that have games ready to go or have games in design

[13:59] because isn't that the best resume to show them what you can do as a designer to show

[14:04] you designed a game.

[14:05] So I would assume they are going to be poaching three young designers from the homebrew world

[14:12] or from the boutique world that we know of because he said we know these people but it's

[14:16] just an interesting time to flex and I see it I see it with the pinball brothers I've

[14:21] seen it now with American pinball is these companies want to flex before they actually

[14:26] get stuff done and I don't know why this is the new strategy and you've seen it they

[14:31] go on a podcast they talk all about what they're going to do and then it's like well where

[14:36] is it meanwhile Stern and Jersey Jack pinball they're putting games in boxes every day and

[14:41] making money that's the key right that is the key we don't need to hear about a pinball

[14:47] company's intentions at all all they need to do is put a great game that has a world

[14:52] under glass in a box and then reveal to the world and that's the best way to create

[14:59] excitement and hype and get people moving in your direction and that's the best way

[15:03] to make money.

[15:04] Stern pinball has this industry down to a science and if you don't think they do you're wrong

[15:10] they know exactly what to do to be successful in pinball they first and foremost understand

[15:16] that you need themes that people want they are never going to bother with original themes

[15:21] again after the failure of black night I highly doubt we will ever see another original

[15:29] title from Stern pinball so they grab a theme that people want they then make three

[15:34] versions of that game and they have one for the collectors one for the players who want

[15:41] all the features don't care about collectability and one for operators that has less in it

[15:46] but will still make money because of the theme that is the winning formula it's the formula

[15:52] that Jersey Jack pinball has now copied with their s c their Ellie and their collectors

[15:57] addition it's also the same formula that Chicago gaming company has now copied so if

[16:02] you're American pinball there's your road map you need to follow this road map because

[16:07] it is the one that is proven successful the other thing you could do if you don't want

[16:12] to do a three tiered system then you just need to do a limited of one version of the game

[16:17] the same way spooky said only 750 Rick and Morty's and then we're on to the next game

[16:23] it's still mind boggling to me right now they won't announce a limit to October fest or

[16:28] Houdini they should have by now said we're only making 500 of each and that's it they still

[16:36] have both of those titles as unlimited runs who thought that was a good idea so that is one

[16:43] of the changes I hope they make over to American pinball is they understand that they need to create

[16:47] some sort of photo and sense of urgency to buy these games so American pinball has decided to flex

[16:53] in early January so when do you think they're going to show us that game when is game number four

[16:59] going to come out now they've already said it's one of the games from the junior designers okay so

[17:05] that means it's not a Joe ball so game so that leads me to believe that game number four which they

[17:11] originally shelved and they moved on to game five they shelved Joe ball says next game because he

[17:16] was still over there after hot wheels so now we're at this point where we expect something big from

[17:24] them and this is going to be a game that I think is going to have to deliver now I will say this

[17:29] right now if American pinball comes out of the gates after all of this flexing and this new team

[17:36] and and sort of this you know that we got Roger Sharp who can get us everything you know and then

[17:40] they show us something that's underwhelming that isn't an amazing theme I don't know how people

[17:46] are going to respond to that see we didn't even talk about that part where they said they were

[17:50] going to only go after licenses if they could get everything now we know for a fact and stern

[17:56] pinball shows us this with almost every release it is really difficult to get some of these grade A

[18:03] licenses and get every single asset you want to get the theme song to get the actors to get the

[18:10] likenesses to get the clips to get everything you want is not easy but now they've said they've

[18:17] got Roger Sharp who's going to accomplish that for them okay so we'll see if that happens it's

[18:23] more than just theme and theme integration and assets people want everything together so after

[18:29] all of this talk about how when they get a license they're going to get everything if they come out

[18:34] of the gate with like an unlicensed theme like if they come out with something like legends of

[18:38] a hala like that's not going to be what people are expecting after this flex so we'll see what happens

[18:44] we'll see when it happens but I also question the timing if I were them I wouldn't even have come

[18:50] out yet I wouldn't even have spoken yet why not come out with your new AP you're the new American

[18:56] pinball why not show you're the new American pinball with a game all we're doing here is we're talking

[19:02] with hyperbole we're talking about intentions I'm so tired of pinball companies trying to get credit

[19:09] for their intentions your intentions don't count what counts are games in boxes what counts are

[19:17] finished products people can buy that is really the only point in which you should reveal yourself

[19:23] to the world otherwise be busy making those games you think one of the strategies is to try to get

[19:29] people to hold their money back to see what's going to come from Dennis Norman and company I don't

[19:33] think anyone's going to do that I mean why would you you don't have any idea of when it's not like

[19:38] they said oh this March the new American pinball will be revealed with a new title no we don't know

[19:43] when you know by March hopefully all the deeprew guys are finally getting to see the assembly line

[19:49] because have you been in that thread the last few days it's amazing to me now that the deadline

[19:55] is up now that there is no more orders being taken on raza now that hilton's been banned from

[20:01] pinside again it seems like for life now that there's nothing left to talk about other than

[20:08] when games will be made it's really interesting going into that thread now I will say this I want

[20:14] to thank you guys out there who have calmed down and understood that there's no point in just

[20:20] beating these buyers up every day but they are also starting to realize something right now

[20:26] why aren't they being shown anything I want you to think about something what did the pinball

[20:32] brothers start to show people before they opened up the order banks for the new alien game what did

[20:38] they show people they showed people parts they showed people play field they showed people the

[20:44] inventory they had which made people feel confident that this thing was real because we know there's

[20:51] a sequence to events that has to happen before you get a pinball machine and the first thing that

[20:57] needs to happen well obviously you need to design the game and all that but before you get your game

[21:02] the parts have to be made the parts have to be shipped to the factory and then the factory has to

[21:10] assemble that game for you so showing people all of those alien play fields lined up made people

[21:16] feel good showing people all those face huggers made people feel good showing people all of the

[21:21] pop bumpers and everything they showed made people feel good now if you're just a few weeks away

[21:27] from Raza right if you're just a few weeks away from this game hitting the line surely there are

[21:33] parts already in house surely some of these specialized parts even just the pin bars even if

[21:40] you just saw I think this would make people feel amazingly good even if you just saw an entire table

[21:46] filled with pin bars wouldn't that make the Raza owners feel confident that this thing is happening

[21:52] in a timely manner they're not seeing anything so here's what I do think is going to happen I think

[21:58] after a few weeks of seeing nothing if they don't get anything these owners are going to start to get

[22:04] really anxious and you're already starting to see some of them say like I'm willing to wait to

[22:09] June I'm willing to wait to July why are they already giving a pass to the time frame that deep

[22:17] root told them about deep roots said the following usually four to six weeks is what it takes between

[22:24] order banks opening and games shipping and we expect to be within that same time frame so four to

[22:32] six weeks it's going to be a very interesting four to six weeks to see what happens I do think deep

[22:38] root should show people some stuff now you have customers now you have buyers you have people now

[22:44] who are going to lose sleep unless they feel confident about this now again this is why I would not

[22:50] have gone in you should have seen this stuff first this is what the the negative crowd has been

[22:56] saying is you should have demanded to see this stuff before you gave them your money but you did

[23:01] in you gave them your money without demanding this stuff and you will have nobody to blame but

[23:06] yourselves if it doesn't work out and they're right those negative people are right as much as they

[23:11] want to start new threads and kick all the negative people out you can't turn off common sense you

[23:18] should have seen some stuff before you gave money common sense people goes a long way in the world

[23:24] all right so distributors have officially hit up consumers for their guns and roses collectors

[23:31] addition payments Jersey Jack Pimball wants to be paid this week for all five hundred machines that

[23:38] were ordered so does that mean the games are on the line they still have not confirmed whether or

[23:43] not games are on the line and so as someone who's in on one I'm a little I'm a little perturb that

[23:48] we have to pay in full we still don't know when we're getting the game I mean there has been no

[23:53] official communication I am not in a million years worried about losing my money I know I'm going

[23:58] to get the game it's just a timing thing you know for some reason when it was October 5th I had no

[24:05] problem saying yeah take my 12 5 a lot's gone on I spent a lot more this holiday that I wanted to

[24:12] so hitting me up for the 12 5 right now it's not the best time I wish if I had a three or four

[24:17] more weeks I would I would prefer that but it is what it is and I'm really excited to see this game

[24:23] on the line I do think when the CES roll off the line people are gonna see the most gorgeous Pimball

[24:29] Machine in the last year and quite possibly one of the most beautiful Pimball Machines of all time

[24:34] and I do mean that I do mean that this game is such a work of art it is unlike anything I've ever

[24:40] stood over all right ladies and gentlemen my fatigue is starting to get the best of me and I hope

[24:45] you understand I mean some people get mad at me for doing shorter podcasts but sometimes I just

[24:49] have to listen to my body and especially now you know the doctor didn't say to me Chris stay hydrated

[24:54] get a lot of rest and make sure you do a few more Pimball podcasts as you get through this thing

[24:59] now that wasn't one of the things he recommended so I just want to say to everybody out there and I

[25:04] mean this and I'm talking to everyone out there even you people who hate can eat his Pimball podcasts

[25:09] this thing is here for your entertainment we love Pimball because it's entertaining we don't

[25:15] need any nastiness anymore we don't need all this negativity about each other about fans of Pimball

[25:21] okay I really do thank each and every one of you for tuning in it means the world to me and thank

[25:26] you to so many of you who have voted for this show so many of you have been reaching out sharing

[25:30] the screenshots of how you're voting for Canada like three times in a row it does mean the world

[25:35] to Brenda myself and Baba because we love doing this podcast and we love at the end of the year

[25:41] putting that little twippy up on the show because it just means that you know what out of all the

[25:46] things going on in the Pimball world the one show that no manufacturer wants to talk to is the

[25:52] most favorite show I think that's such a powerful message to send to these manufacturers because

[25:57] here's a little thing that you don't know they all listen to Canada's Pimball podcasts of course

[26:03] you how many times I say stuff on this show and I hear immediately from the people over at those

[26:07] companies but again they'll never do an interview because I can't admit they can't validate Canada

[26:13] anyway everyone have a great night I'm gonna go to bed I'm exhausted I just wanted to get

[26:17] something up there to let you know why you're not gonna be getting as many shows for me over the

[26:20] next couple weeks everybody out there stay healthy I hope you don't get COVID it's not fun it's not

[26:25] a walk in the park and do the best you can to avoid it but Canada out
