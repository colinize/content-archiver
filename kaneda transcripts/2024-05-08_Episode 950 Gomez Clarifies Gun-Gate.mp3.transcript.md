[00:00] Alright, while I was just chatting with George Gomez, yes the man over at Stern Pinball,

[00:17] and he has confirmed for me that there will be a plethora of gun-toting John Wick scenes

[00:25] all throughout the game. He explained to me that this was Lionsgate asking them not to do this.

[00:32] They put a restriction on using guns in the artwork, and he said to me, you know, look, I'm not going to argue with George Gomez,

[00:39] but he said we signed the deal. When we initially signed the deal to make this game, that was not part of the agreement,

[00:47] and then you have to deal with the approvals people, and they did not want guns in the artwork.

[00:53] It's weird that they wouldn't want that, and it's just more about what's happening over at these movie studios,

[00:59] and not over at Stern Pinball, and we know Stern has no problem putting guns into games.

[01:05] There were guns in Mandalorian, there were guns in Deadpool, and so they had their hands tied behind their back,

[01:13] and we did what the pinball community does so well. We freak out, we get dramatic,

[01:20] and I think for the most part a lot of us out there, we're looking for reasons not to buy these expensive games.

[01:25] I mean, let's be honest, we're looking for anything we can latch onto as the reason why we're not going to spend this much money on pinball.

[01:34] And so here's my thing, though, about all of these pinball launches. I just don't think they work anymore like this.

[01:41] And I was saying this to George, I'm like, George, the problem is, is you're not communicating this stuff,

[01:47] you're just dropping it out in the world like it's 2016.

[01:52] Like, this is still the old way to launch a game where you're still trying to drive that FOMO and that urgency through the door.

[02:00] The moment the game is revealed, all of your dealers are spamming us, taking orders,

[02:05] and we're supposed to make a decision on whether or not we want to pull the trigger,

[02:09] no pun intended considering today's conversation, but we've got to make up our mind right away,

[02:14] and those days are over.

[02:16] Like, you don't have to launch a game like this anymore where, like, you try to keep the theme a secret.

[02:22] We all knew it was John Wick. I told you it was John Wick a year ago.

[02:27] And now, a year later, we get John Wick.

[02:30] And this is the problem when you're still trying to do this old method of FOMO inducing marketing

[02:37] where you're not going to let people know what the next title is, even though you know what the next title is.

[02:43] And the other thing they didn't do is they didn't bring in any of us pinball content media

[02:49] and actually explain to us what that issue was with the artwork in the game.

[02:54] So I'm reacting to this game the same way Carrie Hardy is reacting to this game,

[02:59] the same way Pinside is reacting to this game.

[03:02] Everyone's just reacting with the only information they have.

[03:07] And look, it's fun to overreact and to become dramatically enraged by decisions like these.

[03:14] They don't really mean much.

[03:16] The rest of the world is looking at us like we're a bunch of fools and jackasses.

[03:21] Like, if I walk down the street in New York City and I'm like,

[03:24] oh man, are you still going to pull the trigger on a $13,000 John Wick?

[03:28] Even though there's no guns in the artwork in the game, they'd be like, what are you even talking about?

[03:33] Like, what are you even saying, man?

[03:35] Like, that's where we're at.

[03:37] But there was one thing Gomez said to me.

[03:39] He's like, I didn't think people would react this badly and this poorly.

[03:44] And I did say to him, George, where you been?

[03:46] Like, have you met pinheads?

[03:48] You know they're going to react.

[03:50] You know they're going to latch on to the one weakness or the Achilles heel of a game

[03:55] and they're going to make a mountain out of a molehill, especially now, George.

[03:59] I don't really think they're reading the room.

[04:02] Stern has beaten down their fan base over the last like three years with overpriced

[04:07] LEs, way too many LEs, and they don't seem to be cognizant of the vibes that have shifted

[04:14] dramatically around their company.

[04:17] And I think they're living a little bit in their own bubble.

[04:20] I think it would behoove them to maybe talk to some of us who sort of have a better read,

[04:26] I believe, on where people are vibing, like how their customers are feeling.

[04:31] Because trust me, I speak more to Stern customers on a weekly, daily, and monthly basis than

[04:38] they even do.

[04:40] And so do all the other content creators out there.

[04:42] So do the moderators on pin side.

[04:45] And Stern never, ever, ever seems to even care what our opinions or feedback are on their

[04:51] company and they're just going to keep doing what they're doing.

[04:55] And that's my point, is that it's outdated now.

[04:58] This approach doesn't work.

[04:59] And that's why when you have a thing like the launch of John Wick and there's no guns

[05:03] in the artwork, I think you need to communicate that a little bit more upfront.

[05:08] I also asked about Tim Sexton's voice and even George was like, look, something was

[05:12] going on with the audio.

[05:14] Tim doesn't normally sound like Mickey Mouse.

[05:16] He came in with like this helium octave level voice that just made everybody sort of laugh

[05:21] out loud.

[05:22] And I did say to George, like maybe you should just have Jack Danger present all of these

[05:27] games.

[05:28] You know, I've heard Tim talk before and he doesn't normally sound like this, but it

[05:32] was funny on top of the no guns.

[05:35] You have Tim coming in with like this Mickey Mouse high pitched voice like, hey guys, let

[05:39] me explain to you John Wick pinball.

[05:41] Then there's this AI system and it knows how good you're doing.

[05:44] It was just so comical to have that kind of voice coming in on a theme like John Wick,

[05:50] you know, where it's like this dark, gritty, you know, badass hit man movie theme.

[05:55] And then you've got Mickey Mouse selling you the game.

[05:57] And then I know like Mr. Sharp went over to some YouTuber went over and had like a YouTuber

[06:03] make a video.

[06:04] Who is this guy?

[06:05] Like how is this the guy that Stern is turning to to make their videos?

[06:10] Like I played John Wick.

[06:11] Like I've never even heard of this guy.

[06:13] Like what's going on here?

[06:14] Like they're not leaning on any of the people in this hobby that have the fan bases and

[06:19] the communities connected to their products.

[06:22] And I'm not saying it's going to be me, but they should have gone to someone else who's

[06:26] got more clout and respect in the pinball world.

[06:30] And so this is what happens when you launch a product like this.

[06:34] You don't give people enough information.

[06:36] You don't give people enough context.

[06:39] And the problem is, is that the order banks open up.

[06:42] And that's the thing, Stern.

[06:43] The moment the order banks open up, you need to make sure that everybody has the right

[06:49] amount of information they need before you take their hard earned money.

[06:54] And that's why times have changed because for like six years Stern could announce any

[06:59] LE and it was an instant sell out and they didn't have to give us more information.

[07:04] They didn't even have to do any work.

[07:06] And I think now that this company is going to experience flatter sales than they've ever

[07:11] experienced before, I think at these prices, you know, games are not going to be flying

[07:15] off the shelf.

[07:16] There's no way they're going to sell a thousand John Wicks at $13,000.

[07:21] And there's no way people are excited about this price point, about the volume of these

[07:25] games, and then you have to spend another $2,000 on a topper.

[07:30] And I think Stern's marketing, I think it would help them out if they would just hit

[07:34] pause for a minute and realize we can't just do this rinse, repeat every single launch

[07:41] and have success.

[07:43] That maybe some of the stuff that Canada is saying we should think about, maybe the vibes

[07:49] that are happening around our company and the consumer base that we need to protect.

[07:54] Maybe we need to start addressing that because the issue in pinball now is all about whether

[08:00] or not these companies are going to be able to maintain consistent buyers of new and box

[08:05] products because remember, that's the only reason why we need a factory.

[08:11] It's to make new games.

[08:13] There are hundreds of thousands of pinball machines out in the world.

[08:16] If all these companies went away tomorrow, we would still have enough pinball to satiate

[08:22] every single person on planet earth that wants to own a pinball machine.

[08:26] And so the only way to keep those factories healthy and keep these companies healthy is

[08:31] if they preserve and protect what makes people want to buy a new and box game.

[08:38] And I don't think Seth Davis cares about that.

[08:42] And I don't think the moves Stern has made over the last three years have been aimed

[08:47] at protecting and preserving what made new and box pinball days so much fun, preserving

[08:54] what made buying an LE such a reward and feeling like you got something special.

[09:01] All of that is over now.

[09:02] And that is the big thing.

[09:04] That's the big white walker issue in all of pinball right now.

[09:08] The real enemy is not the fact that the mechs aren't amazing.

[09:12] The real enemy is not the fact that John Wick is not holding a gun.

[09:16] The real enemy to all of these pinball companies is they've overpriced what the real value

[09:23] of their product is.

[09:25] And it's happening across the board.

[09:27] Once you cross that $10,000 threshold, you really need to check every single box and

[09:33] make sure you deliver something that doesn't have any compromises.

[09:38] And that is why when we see a compromise like no guns in the hands of John Wick, it just

[09:45] is a reminder to all of us that you're not getting everything you want.

[09:50] And yet these companies are charging more than they've ever charged before.

[09:54] And that is a conversation that not everybody wants to have.

[09:58] I tried to tell George Gomez, if you could give Seth Davis any advice from Canada, it's

[10:03] not going to work.

[10:04] $1,000 at $13,000 is not a sustainable thing.

[10:10] They need to address that.

[10:12] And I think if they did address that, even on this launch, if they announced there's

[10:16] only going to be 500 John Wick LEDs, I think everybody would have celebrated that.

[10:23] I think those games probably would have sold out if they did that because it would have

[10:28] shown us that Stern is reading the room.

[10:31] It would have shown us that they want to move this company back into the right direction,

[10:36] but they didn't do it.

[10:38] If I was Jersey Jack today, I would announce that our next game is only going to have 500

[10:44] collectors editions.

[10:45] I don't care if it's Harry Potter or Top Gun, whatever it is, somebody's got to make a move.

[10:51] And I think if it's just going to be rinsed and repeat by all these companies and stuff

[10:56] isn't working, it's not going to work.

[10:58] And the last point I'll make is this.

[11:00] They get one chance to make a first impression.

[11:03] They had one chance to launch John Wick in a way that was going to get people excited.

[11:09] And I don't think they did it.

[11:11] And that's on the marketing team and that's on the marketing approach.

[11:16] Trust me, they could have found a way to launch this thing differently.

[11:20] They could have set up a game downtown in New York City where the continental is.

[11:25] And they could have invited people to have a first hands-on experience with the game.

[11:30] And what did they do?

[11:31] They brought a game and they put it in front of Windows, which annoys me to begin with,

[11:36] in some random room in California and put it on a guy's stream where none of his audience

[11:43] are the pinball fanatics you and I know.

[11:45] And that's how you create the content of John Wick.

[11:48] I think this approach just doesn't work.

[11:51] And I'm really rooting for Stern and anybody out there, for these pinball companies to

[11:56] wake up, read the room and stop with the rinse and repeat.

[12:01] Times have changed and we need to see more transparency from them.

[12:05] They need to let us in a little bit more.

[12:07] The days of like everything's going to be a secret until the day we want your money.

[12:12] And on that day, we're not going to give you enough information.

[12:15] It doesn't work.

[12:17] Everybody, thank you for the support.

[12:18] I love doing these shows.

[12:20] I'm waiting for the baby.

[12:21] I'm really anxious.

[12:23] I want to get this baby out with 10 fingers and 10 toes.

[12:26] And I just want my beautiful wife.

[12:28] She's carried this child for 10 months.

[12:31] That's all we want is this baby out in the world so he can be another person who's not

[12:36] going to buy $13,000.

[12:38] Well, ladies, have a good night, everybody.
