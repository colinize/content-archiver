[00:06] All right, Rush Pinball is part of the pinball world now.

[00:20] All the guessing, all the speculation is over.

[00:23] It is always exciting on a new pin day to see what Stern Pinball puts out in the world.

[00:29] And without Stern Pinball, there wouldn't be much pinball to analyze because nobody

[00:34] else can do what Stern does and that is get a new pinball machine even in pandemic

[00:39] times.

[00:40] They get us new machines every three to four months.

[00:44] It's amazing.

[00:45] And now we have John Borg's Rush and all of us are having first impressions and we haven't

[00:50] seen the gameplay.

[00:52] We've seen the layout.

[00:53] It looks very similar to a lot of John Borg layouts, but that's not necessarily a bad

[01:00] thing.

[01:01] We've seen the artwork.

[01:03] We've seen the toys in the game.

[01:05] We have to use our imagination a little bit at this stage.

[01:08] So what are my first impressions of Rush Pinball and how did I feel on today's reveal of the

[01:15] game?

[01:16] Well, I'll start out by saying this.

[01:17] My expectations for Rush were about as low as you could get because I'm not a Rush

[01:23] fan.

[01:24] I knew I wasn't going to buy this game.

[01:25] I knew that nothing they showed me would make me want to buy the game just because

[01:31] I'm not a Rush fan and I think music pins are for fans of those acts.

[01:37] And it's always weird to me when people buy a music pin and they don't even like the music.

[01:41] So I was able to go into today with very low expectations.

[01:45] I also heard that the art wasn't the best.

[01:47] So I was expecting maybe one of the most atrocious art packages of all time, a la Game of Thrones.

[01:54] And I will say this, after seeing the game today, I wasn't like appalled by anything

[02:00] I saw.

[02:01] I wasn't appalled by the art package.

[02:03] I wasn't blown away.

[02:05] I don't think it looks great, but I don't think it looks horrible.

[02:10] I give it just like a passing grade, but I do think it's a little bit of a miss because

[02:16] if you're a music fan, you don't want your pin just to shoot well.

[02:20] You also want it to be a work of art that pays tribute to the band you love.

[02:26] And I just don't think this art package is nearly anywhere close to the art packages

[02:32] we saw on Metallica, on Aerosmith, on Monsters, on Deadpool.

[02:38] You could add every zombie-eddy game Iron Maiden.

[02:41] It's just not as good.

[02:43] So I just feel like as a Rush fanatic, if you are one, I know I see a lot of people

[02:49] justifying this game saying it's a home run and I'm sorry.

[02:53] You don't get to say a game is a home run unless everything is a home run.

[02:58] And this art package is not a home run.

[03:01] Now that being said, if you are a Rush fan and you got all of the details on this game

[03:07] today and you saw the level of integration and the level of collaboration between the

[03:14] band itself and Stern Pinball, you're a happy camper today.

[03:18] You are.

[03:19] You're a happy camper.

[03:20] You have an order in on one of these three models.

[03:23] And there's not a lot for you to complain about if you love Rush.

[03:27] And I want everybody to understand that I think there are two camps of people here.

[03:32] There are Rush fans and did they get what they wanted?

[03:36] And there are casual fans who might not care at all about Rush.

[03:40] And I think this game is going to be highly appealing to that first audience.

[03:44] And guess what?

[03:45] That's what a pinball machine should be.

[03:48] It should give the people that love the theme what they want.

[03:52] Now I do think they'd want a better art package.

[03:54] I won't lie.

[03:55] But this game looks loaded.

[03:58] It actually looks loaded with a lot of stuff.

[04:01] It looks fun to shoot.

[04:02] It looks like an amalgamation of John Borg's older titles.

[04:06] I mean, it's basically like Austin Powers, Ninja Turtles and X-Men had a baby and their

[04:12] baby was the ring from Lord of the Rings.

[04:14] You put it all together and you've got this game.

[04:17] I mean, it's eerily similar to X-Men.

[04:20] But I hear people complain about that and say John Borg just recycles his designs

[04:24] and he keeps doing the same thing over and over again.

[04:27] I would argue that John Borg has a design style as does Steve Ritchie, as does Keith Elwin.

[04:34] And every designer, I don't care who they are, after they make like eight games, they're

[04:39] going to run out of original ways to do a layout.

[04:42] And this layout looks like it's going to be fun to shoot.

[04:45] The toys look like they're going to be fun to play.

[04:48] You got the time machine.

[04:50] You got the two scoops.

[04:51] You got some drop targets.

[04:53] You got a diverter.

[04:54] You know the whole list of things in this game.

[04:56] And so it looks like it's going to be the amalgamation I just talked about.

[05:01] And John Borg games usually are pretty fun to shoot.

[05:04] But I think the most valuable element of this game we haven't really seen yet, it's

[05:09] not going to be the layout.

[05:10] I think the layout's going to work and it's going to work just fine.

[05:14] The thing that's going to make this game sing and soar is the collaboration between

[05:19] Stern and the band.

[05:20] It's going to be all of those call-outs.

[05:22] It's going to be the two band members working with Ed Robertson putting a ton of personality

[05:29] into this game.

[05:30] And again, I only think Rush fans will appreciate that.

[05:34] If you don't like this band and you don't care for those two artists, why would you get

[05:40] excited about what they're going to put into the game?

[05:43] So I think this game is going to be a super appetizing package for Rush fans.

[05:48] But for everybody else, I don't think this is going to pull you in.

[05:52] If you're not really into Rush, because chances are you see a game like X-Men and you know

[05:57] what?

[05:58] You're going to be more likely to get excited about being an X-Man than you are going to

[06:02] be about listening to 16 Rush songs you probably have never heard before.

[06:07] Because if what excites you is the gameplay and the layout, you can get this from other

[06:11] John Borg layouts where the theme is something that's probably much more exciting to you

[06:16] than Rush.

[06:17] You know, so I wasn't extremely disappointed.

[06:19] I knew Rush fans would be happy.

[06:21] I went on pin site and I heard all the Rush fans super excited.

[06:25] I was glad to see that.

[06:26] I want to see fans of a theme excited about a pin.

[06:30] I think what's always deplorable in our hobby is when something comes out that the fans

[06:35] love and then the non-fans have to like berate them and be like, this is the ugliest

[06:40] game ever.

[06:41] Like this game is an unoriginal layout.

[06:43] Like why would you piss on it that much?

[06:45] At least let the Rush fans have their one day in the sunshine.

[06:50] We all know that in 24 hours, pin site is going to turn on this game.

[06:54] It always happens.

[06:55] They're going to turn on this game.

[06:56] They're going to tear it apart.

[06:58] They're going to tear apart the artwork.

[07:00] You know they're going to get their hands on this thing and they're going to go nuts.

[07:03] And I will say, if you're a Rush fan and this game speaks to you, just tune it out.

[07:08] Get your order in.

[07:09] Here's my advice.

[07:10] Get your order in and then turn off pin site for a month.

[07:14] Why would you care?

[07:15] Your order's in.

[07:16] You love Rush.

[07:17] If I loved Rush and I mean it when I say this, I would own this pin.

[07:20] I mean, I love a band and now there's a pinball game based on a band I love.

[07:26] I'm owning it.

[07:27] I'm absolutely owning it.

[07:29] Now the real question becomes, do you want an Ellie?

[07:31] Do you need an Ellie?

[07:33] Is the Ellie nice enough to get?

[07:35] And is this Ellie going to hold value?

[07:37] I want to talk about the pricing of the Ellie because I think the main news story

[07:42] happening today isn't even Rush pinball, right?

[07:45] We knew Rush pinball was going to happen.

[07:47] The real eye-opening thing today is that Stern once again is using each new game to trojan

[07:55] horse a higher price into the pinball market.

[07:59] And can you blame them?

[08:00] But it is official.

[08:01] Rush Ellie, look at this game.

[08:03] This game is more expensive than Godzilla Ellie.

[08:08] This game has an MSRP of $11,100 or $11,099.

[08:16] And I want to talk about this for a minute because it is getting so easy for me and maybe

[08:21] for you at this ridiculous price point to pass on these games.

[08:27] I mean, just think about what Stern has done.

[08:29] They've doubled the number of Ellie's they're making, which means they're not that

[08:33] special anymore.

[08:34] And now they've increased the price.

[08:36] And this is $11,100 with no topper.

[08:40] And you know them, they're going to sell you a $1,000 topper for this game.

[08:45] And then you're at $12,100.

[08:49] And they don't have a shooter rod that's different.

[08:51] So when they change the shooter rod knob, they're going to charge you another $100

[08:55] for that.

[08:56] When you add it all up, you are now seeing Stern Ellie's will be $12,500.

[09:02] And that's if you get free shipping.

[09:03] And I just want to talk about that for a minute.

[09:05] And I looked at this game and I looked at what was in it.

[09:08] And I said to myself, Chris, is this an $11,000 pinball machine?

[09:14] And again, maybe to you rush fans, it is, but I'm not seeing it.

[09:19] And I'm not seeing anywhere close to that much money going into the machine.

[09:25] And then you get to the premium.

[09:27] And this is really where the Stern Trojan horse pricing has happened.

[09:32] You are now spending $9,000 on a premium of rush.

[09:36] And they remove the expression lighting from the game.

[09:40] So if you want to get the expression lighting, which will cost you $500 extra dollars, you

[09:45] are now at $9,500 for a Stern premium that has everything in it.

[09:52] Think about that for a minute.

[09:53] A premium, a game in which they're going to make an unlimited amount of, is now

[09:58] more expensive than the Ellie's were just a year ago.

[10:02] And we're just sitting back and we're taking it.

[10:05] And they're not putting anything more into these games, people.

[10:09] That is the part that's scaring me.

[10:11] I'm looking down at rush and I'm seeing some cool stuff.

[10:14] But then again, for $11,000, should I look down and see completely flat

[10:20] plastics everywhere like they couldn't sculpt anything by the pop bumpers?

[10:24] There's not much sculpted in this game.

[10:26] There's the time machine and then there's the drum clock and that's it.

[10:31] That is it.

[10:32] There is not this like tremendous 3D world under glass at all.

[10:36] You know, I'm just having a hard time.

[10:38] I'm just having a hard time with these new Stern prices and I'm worried.

[10:42] I'm worried because here are two things that are not going to happen.

[10:45] Stern is never going to make less than a thousand Ellie's again and

[10:48] they're never going to lower the price.

[10:50] So now the new base price for all Ellie's moving forward is $11,100.

[10:56] Do you want to spend 11 grand on a Venom?

[10:59] Did you want to spend 1100 on Rush?

[11:02] I could understand if it was Star Wars.

[11:04] I could understand if it was back to the future, but now this is the new base.

[11:09] I don't know.

[11:09] The more these prices keep going up and up and up and again,

[11:13] I'm not seeing the stuff in the game to justify this.

[11:16] Are you, you know, the more Stern keeps raising the price of these

[11:19] machines and it seems like they're selling pretty damn well.

[11:22] We know that Jersey Jack machines are going to go upmarket in price.

[11:25] And it's at the point now where, you know, you buy two pinball machines

[11:29] and you're over $20,000.

[11:31] I think if you buy two Jersey Jack CEs in the future, you're at $30,000.

[11:36] So at these price points, I think our expectations need to be through the roof.

[11:41] And I do think every game needs to be a home run for $11,000.

[11:46] And then you start to look at these games differently.

[11:49] You know, you start to look at RushLE for 11-1 and you say, well,

[11:52] maybe they could have done better playfield artwork, at least on the LE.

[11:56] Sort of like how Jersey Jack pinball, they give you more in the

[11:59] collector's edition playfield, but we know Stern's not going to do that.

[12:02] Maybe I should get a topper for this much money.

[12:05] But we've all sort of screwed ourselves because sales are so good.

[12:09] And no matter what Stern comes out with and they've kept raising the price

[12:13] and they've raised the volume, I mean, collectors out there, if you ask me,

[12:18] collectors have lost out because now you're paying so much more.

[12:23] The value that the game used to go up in Stern is now getting that money,

[12:27] not you. And they've also doubled the volume.

[12:30] So as a collector, I really think these things are not going to be nearly

[12:35] as collectible or sought out as people think.

[12:38] If I were you, I would only buy a RushLE if the game is going to be

[12:41] bolted to your floor because you love the band so much.

[12:44] I'm hearing people say that dealers are already charging $13,000 to get it.

[12:50] So we're seeing dealers inflate the price over 11K already.

[12:55] At what point do we say enough is enough?

[12:57] And I really do mean this is the news of the day because we're seeing this.

[13:00] It's only going to get worse.

[13:02] If we're seeing dealers ask for 13,000 for Rush,

[13:06] what do you think they're going to ask for James Bond?

[13:09] What do you think they're going to ask for for Back to the Future?

[13:12] What do you think they're going to ask for when Jaws comes out?

[13:14] Right? What do you think it's going to happen?

[13:16] It's going to become a brutal bidding war to get any of these games.

[13:21] It was different when we used to be able to get a Stern LE for 6,500.

[13:26] You could buy a game, you could play it for a year and you could move it on.

[13:30] If the game was a hit, you would make a few thousand dollars.

[13:33] Now, now we're in Bizarro World.

[13:35] You're spending almost $12,000 from Stern with tax already, with shipping.

[13:40] If you get a top or you're at almost $12,000, $13,000.

[13:44] And then when you go to sell your game, you think you deserve $15,000 for it

[13:48] or $18,000 for it.

[13:50] And the sad part is you'll probably find some new to the hobby guy

[13:54] who has no idea what he's doing and will give you $15,000 for a stranger

[13:58] things LE. And this is where we're at.

[14:01] And some of this is chipping away at my enjoyment of the hobby

[14:04] because, again, I can't erase the prices.

[14:08] When I see a Jersey Jack LE, I see where the money goes.

[14:12] When I see a Stern at $11,000, I don't see where the money goes.

[14:17] Am I being like unfair?

[14:18] Am I really being unfair?

[14:20] Put Rush LE right next to Guns N' Roses LE.

[14:25] And you tell me how that Rush LE is more expensive.

[14:30] And if you say it's more fun to shoot, I'm going to slap you

[14:33] through the microphone.

[14:35] I am talking about what is in the game, what is physically in it,

[14:40] what is in it from a code standpoint, what is in it from an

[14:43] animation standpoint, and it's crazy to me.

[14:47] And if you're Jersey Jack, again, you're looking at this being

[14:50] like, what are we doing?

[14:52] We are giving our games away at these prices if Stern can

[14:55] sell at these prices.

[14:57] But Stern gets it to the only drug dealer in town that could

[15:00] cut up the dime bags fast enough because that's what

[15:03] these people want.

[15:04] And I will say this, the one thing I want to implore each and

[15:06] every one of you, if you want a Rush LE, I would just be

[15:10] patient.

[15:10] I think there are a bunch of dealers that are going to try

[15:14] to sell this for over sticker.

[15:16] I think some of them will be successful in luring some

[15:19] suckers in on day one, but I do think there are going to

[15:23] be Rush LEs available much closer to this $11,000.

[15:28] I can't even believe I'm saying this.

[15:29] $11,000 Stern is going to pocket for an LE like this and

[15:34] there's a thousand of them and they're still hard to get.

[15:37] This is insane.

[15:39] And it's hard for me to give my first impression of a

[15:41] Stern without looking at it through that lens.

[15:45] I think the game is going to shoot great.

[15:47] I think the art package is underwhelming.

[15:49] I think the code is going to be amazing.

[15:52] That is my first impression of Rush Pinball.

[15:55] I also think that the silver lining in all of these

[15:58] high prices and in the market nowadays is this.

[16:02] You are now only going to buy games you love.

[16:05] You're now only going to consider games that are

[16:07] themes you absolutely love because you can't afford to

[16:11] do what you used to be able to do, which is just run

[16:14] into everything, play it for a few months and then

[16:17] sell it for a profit because it's not going to work

[16:19] out like that anymore.

[16:21] And someone's going to be left holding the bag.

[16:23] I think for Stern, they're capitalizing on this

[16:26] hot market, but I'm a little worried that when the

[16:29] market goes a little bit south, will Stern have to

[16:31] reduce their prices?

[16:33] Are they going to stay at this high price?

[16:35] I don't know.

[16:36] I don't think this is the ceiling, which is scary

[16:38] to say, but I'm also not seeing $11,000 in

[16:41] pinball machines here.

[16:42] I'm just not.

[16:43] This is just Canada saying, I've always wanted high

[16:46] price games because I wanted people to put a

[16:48] ton into them.

[16:50] I'm seeing a pretty loaded game for a Stern.

[16:53] I am that there's a lot to like in this game.

[16:55] There's a lot happening in this game, but then I see

[16:58] stuff, right?

[16:59] For $11,000 Stern, you've got two scoops in the

[17:03] game that look really fun.

[17:04] Two scoops are great.

[17:05] Like two scoops of ice cream better than one, but

[17:07] then you don't put a scoop protector on the game.

[17:10] Why do we have to do this?

[17:12] Why do I have to go and disassemble my game and

[17:16] buy a clippy scoop protector when you know

[17:19] Stern that these scoops are going to wear and

[17:22] you don't even put a scoop protector.

[17:24] Again, I'm just saying this for $11,000, I just

[17:28] want these companies to give me everything I

[17:31] want in a game.

[17:32] And don't you want a scoop protector?

[17:34] You do, but you have to go do it extra.

[17:37] But in summary, I think Rush fans are going to

[17:41] be blown away by this game when they get it.

[17:43] I think mostly everybody else will enjoy the

[17:47] game on location and at shows, but I don't

[17:51] think you're going to be running to buy this

[17:53] game if you don't love Rush.

[17:55] And I don't think it's going to have the same

[17:57] crossover appeal of a game like Iron Maiden,

[18:00] because a lot of people will say that, like, I

[18:02] don't really like Iron Maiden, but I love Keith

[18:04] Elwin's Iron Maiden.

[18:06] And I don't think I don't, I don't think

[18:08] Borg pulls people over the way Elwin does.

[18:12] And Elwin's got a fan base and a following

[18:15] that for some reason, right, people can't

[18:18] resist the way a Keith Elwin pin shoots.

[18:21] And that is why even if people hate Iron Maiden,

[18:24] they love the pin because of how Elwin designed it.

[18:28] Do I think this game is going to have that

[18:30] crossover appeal?

[18:31] I don't, I just don't.

[18:33] I also think Rush music is just a really

[18:37] acquired taste.

[18:38] It is and not everybody loves it.

[18:40] And I don't think it has the same high

[18:42] energy level of Iron Maiden music for pinball.

[18:46] So we'll see how it translates into a pinball

[18:48] machine. I'm not going to lie.

[18:50] I know one Rush song and that's it.

[18:52] I know Tom Sawyer.

[18:53] I don't know the other stuff.

[18:55] I'm not going to rag on it.

[18:56] But man, if I want a high energy pinball

[18:59] music experience, I don't think Rush is what

[19:02] I'm playing, but I understand why a lot of

[19:05] you love Rush and I'm happy you're getting a pin.

[19:07] I mean, that's sort of it.

[19:08] I'm happy you're getting the pin that is

[19:10] based on the theme you love.

[19:12] I think the majority of people would love

[19:14] to see Stern do more mainstream stuff.

[19:17] I think knowing that after this pin is

[19:19] venom creates a pretty much a six month

[19:22] window in which it's an easy pass for the

[19:25] majority of people.

[19:26] James Bond is going to be a woodshed

[19:28] moment in which tons of people go after

[19:30] James Bond.

[19:31] But when you look at Stern as a portfolio

[19:34] of games, right, you have to always remember

[19:37] that Stern wants to make sure its

[19:39] portfolio of games appeals to everybody.

[19:42] And when you go on Stern's website,

[19:44] you've got Rush, Godzilla, Mandalorian,

[19:47] Led Zeppelin, Avengers, Ninja Turtles,

[19:51] Stranger Things, Elvira, Jurassic Park,

[19:55] Beatles, Deadpool, Iron Maiden, Batman,

[19:58] Star Wars, Guardians of the Galaxy.

[20:00] That's what they have on their website

[20:03] as games you can order today.

[20:04] All right, you go into Jersey Jack

[20:06] Pinball's website.

[20:07] They got one game you can buy.

[20:08] One, you go on Chicago Gaming's website.

[20:10] They got one game that you can buy

[20:12] that's not even shipping.

[20:14] You go on American Pinball's website.

[20:16] You got one game that's an original IP.

[20:18] You see what I'm saying?

[20:19] Stern is just clobbering everybody,

[20:22] everybody.

[20:23] So I fully expect them to add

[20:25] Foo Fighters to this list.

[20:27] And it won't matter because they'll

[20:28] have Foo Fighters and the Mandalorian.

[20:31] And then they'll have Foo Fighters

[20:32] and James Bond.

[20:33] They'll have Foo Fighters and Back

[20:35] to the Future, Foo Fighters and Jaws.

[20:37] You see what I mean?

[20:38] All they need to do is sell

[20:39] a thousand LEDs to a fan base.

[20:42] Easy to do.

[20:43] And then the rest is gravy.

[20:44] And if the game doesn't do great,

[20:46] it doesn't matter.

[20:47] They'll just make more Mandalorians

[20:48] or make more Godzillas or make more

[20:50] this or make more that.

[20:52] That doesn't happen anywhere else.

[20:54] Like Jersey Jack Pinball knows

[20:56] people want more Pirates of the Caribbean.

[20:58] They're not making anymore.

[20:59] They know you might want more

[21:00] Wizard of Oz is new in box.

[21:02] They're not making anymore.

[21:03] They don't care if you want dialed in.

[21:05] They don't care if you want more

[21:06] Hobbits, they're not going to make you anymore.

[21:09] This company is so far ahead

[21:11] of everybody else.

[21:12] It's not even funny.

[21:13] Speaking of that,

[21:14] the Twippies are coming up, right?

[21:15] And if you haven't voted yet,

[21:17] please go to the twippy voting

[21:18] on twippies.com and please vote

[21:21] for Canada's pinball podcast

[21:22] for favorite pinball podcast.

[21:24] And do me a favor.

[21:25] If you and one other person

[21:27] in your family votes for

[21:28] Canada, we would have like 700 votes.

[21:31] So I think we might take it

[21:32] and go five for five.

[21:33] And if you watch Canada's Facebook Live

[21:36] on Facebook, my Saturday morning

[21:38] spectacular, I would also love

[21:40] it if you would vote for Canada

[21:42] for favorite pinball streamer.

[21:43] I don't think I'm going to win,

[21:45] but I want to get in the top three

[21:47] because I think it would be amazing

[21:48] to show everybody that you can have

[21:50] an entertaining pinball stream

[21:52] when you don't even play pinball.

[21:54] But back to my point, speaking

[21:55] of the Twippies, and I mean this

[21:57] when I say this, stern pinball

[21:59] is going to win every single

[22:02] category it is nominated in.

[22:04] Every single category

[22:05] stern pinball is going to win

[22:07] every one, they're not going

[22:09] to lose out to spooky.

[22:10] They're not going to lose out to Jersey

[22:12] Jack, who's not even in it this year

[22:14] because they can't get more than

[22:15] one game out a year.

[22:16] They're not going to lose to C.G.C.

[22:17] They're not going to lose to anybody.

[22:19] They're not going to lose to P3

[22:21] multi-morphic or American pinball.

[22:23] They're the only game in town.

[22:26] Everybody else is so

[22:28] far behind stern.

[22:29] It's not even funny.

[22:31] Now, that doesn't mean that

[22:32] everything stern does is gold.

[22:35] It doesn't mean their games

[22:36] are worth this kind of money,

[22:38] but it doesn't matter.

[22:39] Like I said, if you're the only drug

[22:42] dealer making drugs

[22:44] and this is a drug and it is

[22:46] and these grown men don't need

[22:48] another pinball machine, but they're

[22:49] addicted to this.

[22:51] They want to feel this FOMO

[22:52] every three to four months.

[22:54] If you put that pinball machine

[22:56] in that stern dime bag,

[22:58] they're buying and they are buying

[23:00] and dealers and distributors

[23:02] are selling this crack

[23:04] every three to four months

[23:06] because nobody else can bring

[23:07] their crack to market.

[23:08] That might not be the best metaphor,

[23:10] but it's true.

[23:11] So let's see what happens on

[23:12] Pinside over the next 48 hours.

[23:14] It's always enjoyable to get out

[23:16] the popcorn and watch Pinside

[23:18] cry and moan about a game.

[23:20] I think if you love rush, do me a

[23:22] favor, order the game, enjoy

[23:24] your game and turn off all

[23:26] of the noise.

[23:27] It's not worth it.

[23:28] Everybody, Canada out.

[23:29] Let me know what you think

[23:30] about my first impressions

[23:32] and my assessment of this whole

[23:33] situation.

[23:34] Hit me up at

[23:35] canada pinball at gmail.com

[23:38] and thank you guys for being a part

[23:40] of the club.

[23:40] The numbers keep going up.

[23:42] The haters are losing every time

[23:43] a new person signs up to listen

[23:45] to Canada's pinball podcast.

[23:46] I'll be back with more episodes

[23:48] this week later.
