[00:00] If I can just wait 5 more minutes and tell you how I feel

[00:12] Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down

[00:16] Alright, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Kaneda Spinball Podcast. We are just days away from Pokemon.

[00:23] Dealers have been contacted by Stern. They know the details.

[00:29] Now, if that has happened on a Tuesday, I think we're going to see the Pokemon sort of logo teaser theme reveal on this Friday.

[00:41] It's either going to be this Friday or next.

[00:44] And Stern's typical launches go like this.

[00:48] On a Friday, they announce the theme with some like 30 to 60 second teaser video.

[00:54] Usually it's like 30 seconds.

[00:56] There'll be like the Pokemon ball and it's going to be like, got to catch them all.

[01:02] Stern pinball.

[01:03] And then on Tuesday, we're going to get the full game reveal.

[01:08] Little weird that they're over at CES in front of all of these people and they're going to do it the week after.

[01:17] It's kind of like they can't just get their stuff together lately with all of these like licensor approvals.

[01:25] But here's what.

[01:26] What we know so far about Pokemon.

[01:28] The game started as a Jack Danger game.

[01:33] I heard from some people over there.

[01:35] Jack was getting really creative with the design and the layout.

[01:40] You know, he likes to push the envelope.

[01:42] X-Men, Foo Fighters, two great shooting games.

[01:47] One of which was killed by bad code.

[01:49] X-Men, the code's getting better.

[01:51] And I heard that he sort of was sidelined by Gomez.

[01:56] Who wants to make a much more simple pin.

[02:01] And so now the latest rumors are that this game is going to be more of a reflection of a new Deadpool versus a game.

[02:12] Maybe like X-Men or Foo Fighters.

[02:14] We might get a more traditional layout and we might get more of a basic game in terms of mechanisms.

[02:21] Now, I hear people out there being like, well, Canada, what's the problem?

[02:25] Deadpool.

[02:26] Is a great game.

[02:27] And I would say back to all of you that Deadpool Ellie was how much money and Deadpool Ellie had zombie Eddie.

[02:37] Maybe his second greatest art package.

[02:39] Maybe his greatest art package ever on a stern machine.

[02:43] It was before the rainbow explosion.

[02:46] And it was perfect.

[02:47] Like zombie Eddie's Deadpool machine looks so good.

[02:52] And remember to back then.

[02:54] This is when we were sort of fresh.

[02:56] To all the Zeddy comic book style artwork.

[02:59] And hey, he's got a comic book style approach to his art.

[03:03] And it's a comic book.

[03:05] So it works perfectly.

[03:06] Now, you know, look, if he does Pokemon, it is a comic and anime.

[03:10] So I think it would fit the theme very well.

[03:13] But here's the issue.

[03:14] It's now 2026.

[03:16] And Stern Pinball, I think, needs more than just a game that checks the boxes.

[03:22] I think they need a game that is magical.

[03:25] That has like mechanics.

[03:26] Mechanical engineering.

[03:27] That's awesome.

[03:28] They need a statement game for this new spike three platform.

[03:31] Everybody knows it.

[03:33] I'm in the Star Wars thread today.

[03:35] And it's interesting how the owners are like, I don't understand why this game got such

[03:40] blowback at launch.

[03:41] And people are like, uh, it's barren.

[03:45] And they put a picture of it next to the data East Star Wars, which has nicer artwork,

[03:51] which has more interesting mechanisms in it.

[03:54] That's why there was blowback.

[03:56] People.

[03:56] In 2025, this game comes out and has almost nothing in it.

[04:01] John Borg himself admits to rushing this game in eight months in eight month design cycle.

[04:08] Jersey Jack Pinball has 18 months to make every single game.

[04:13] The typical Stern design cycle is at least like 14 to 16 months.

[04:19] And so why would you rush out Star Wars?

[04:22] I think the biggest thing with Pokemon is this.

[04:25] It's not really a game.

[04:26] It's not really going to be a Jack danger game at all.

[04:28] This is going to be a Gomez pin and you know, 73 year old George Gomez.

[04:35] Does he have an emotional connection to Pokemon?

[04:39] Do you think he's seen a single Pokemon episode?

[04:42] I mean, he probably making this game, but you know what I'm saying?

[04:45] The man hasn't been dreaming about the possibilities of putting a Pokemon world under glass.

[04:52] And this is why I think, and I don't know yet.

[04:55] But if I were to make my guess, I think it's going to be underwhelming because I think George is going to be answering a homework assignment versus making a game that he's super passionate about.

[05:08] I think he's going to be making a game to try to get Stern out of a financial hole because there are last few games have been really mediocre.

[05:17] And I'm hearing like Seth has been calling meetings and he's like yelling at people about what's going on.

[05:23] Where are the sales for the walking dead?

[05:24] How come this is not selling so well?

[05:26] And so it's a company that's got its back against the ropes and it doesn't feel like the culture over there right now is one where everyone's going in and having a good time and bringing their best ideas to the table and everybody's collaborating on how to make Pokemon the best pinball machine.

[05:45] But what will happen is this, this game will sell very well based on theme.

[05:52] And even as I say this,

[05:53] I'm not saying that this is going to be a good game.

[05:54] I'm saying that I almost want to play devil's advocate.

[05:56] I don't know, man.

[05:57] I don't know if there's enough like crossover between Pokemon fans and people that will drop seven to 13,000 on a pinball machine.

[06:06] And here's the thing that I think has happened is Stern's lost a lot of the base.

[06:11] The core people that are just pinheads that used to buy every new Stern and a lot of those people, they're just burned.

[06:18] They're tired.

[06:19] They're burnt out of losing so much money.

[06:21] Even Star Wars right now.

[06:22] I'm looking at Star Wars.

[06:23] You can go get the le for almost 10 grand now.

[06:26] So $3,000 off people in the thread are like, well, I got a premium for the price of a pro.

[06:31] And you know, this doesn't just go away.

[06:33] These are the latest releases.

[06:35] You can almost now go get a walking dead remastered le for $3,000 off.

[06:41] These games are not selling.

[06:43] And so when you lose that aura that you make something that has the value, it doesn't even hold the value at MSRP.

[06:51] I think a lot of pinheads are just like, look, I'm going to buy this.

[06:52] I think a lot of pinheads are just like, look, I'm curious.

[06:54] There's not a single pinhead out there that isn't excited on a new pin day.

[07:00] There's not a single pinhead out there.

[07:02] And I mean this, that's not open-minded when every new pin comes out.

[07:07] There were people that wrote off barrels of fun because a labyrinth, and then they bought a Winchester.

[07:13] There are people that might hate Stern pinball and their recent releases and think they're barren and cheap.

[07:19] But if they put a great game out in the world, you're going to buy it.

[07:22] They still have the capacity to make amazing pinball machines.

[07:25] When you go on the pin side, top 100, there's no denying the fact Stern has made some of the best pinball machines ever.

[07:32] They're in a little bit of a quagmire.

[07:34] They're in a little bit of a weird place right now.

[07:37] I think culturally they need a change.

[07:40] And I don't know who that change agent is.

[07:43] Seth has the weight of this company on his shoulders.

[07:46] He's now the CEO.

[07:48] Gary ran this thing for many, many years.

[07:50] His father was there.

[07:51] His father was there.

[07:52] He was in the industry.

[07:53] He grew up in this industry.

[07:55] George Gomez, same thing.

[07:57] He's been doing this since he was just a young lad.

[08:01] And here he is now at 73, handed the biggest IP in the world.

[08:06] And you know when he's designing this game, on one shoulder is the young George Gomez being like,

[08:14] what's the greatest creative stuff we could do?

[08:17] And on the other shoulder is the bean counter being like,

[08:21] we have to maximize profit and we have to give back to our private equity investors

[08:26] a return on their investment so we can't go crazy with the bomb on this game.

[08:31] Look, I hope this game blows us away.

[08:34] I hope this game exceeds our expectations.

[08:37] With every Stern launch recently, our expectations have been lowered.

[08:42] So they don't even need to come out with like the next Godzilla in my honest opinion.

[08:46] They just need to come out with a game that just looks like a ton of pinball.

[08:50] Of pinball fun.

[08:52] It just looks like a game that is unique.

[08:55] That doesn't feel like more of the same.

[08:57] And I think that's the other thing with Stern lately.

[08:59] All these remakes and remasters and new versions of older games,

[09:03] whether they're anniversary editions or not,

[09:06] it does feel like we've seen this movie before.

[09:10] You're asking us to pay more to see the same movie again.

[09:15] And it's just not working.

[09:16] It's just not working.

[09:18] So we shall see.

[09:19] All of our Pokemon questions will be answered.

[09:22] They will be answered within the next two weeks.

[09:26] Now speaking of two weeks, this is too funny.

[09:29] The man who made two weeks famous in the world of pinball is back at CES.

[09:36] Andrew Highway is back with his latest invention, Ice Splosion.

[09:43] It is a home machine to make slushies.

[09:48] I'm not even making this up.

[09:50] Now he's had this Ice Splosion idea for like six, seven years.

[09:55] Because I remember people who worked on the art for the Ice Splosion logo.

[10:00] But here's the funniest part.

[10:02] Here's the funniest part.

[10:03] He is clearly looking for investors.

[10:07] It's not available to buy.

[10:10] And it's coming out sometime in 2026.

[10:15] There is just something about these slushies.

[10:17] There is something about these serial entrepreneurs that fail every single time.

[10:24] And they just keep coming.

[10:27] Now I will say this.

[10:29] Now you know what to get Kaneda for Christmas.

[10:31] I mean this.

[10:32] If the Ice Splosion machine actually does make it to market by the end of this year,

[10:40] I would like one.

[10:42] I would want one of these.

[10:43] I think we should put these things on every machine as a topper.

[10:46] After you have a good game, just go up there and make yourself a slushie.

[10:50] And I love the fact that all of these scam artists, they always start with the same line.

[10:56] Andrew's got this line.

[10:58] It's like, this all began with my love of slushies.

[11:02] This all began with my love of pinball.

[11:05] This all began with my love of hydrofoils.

[11:09] If you don't know the Andrew Highway story, people, and some of you are newbies,

[11:13] you have to remember.

[11:14] I have to remember about a decade ago when this guy was lying to the pinball community,

[11:20] only one pinball podcaster called him out.

[11:23] Only one pinball podcaster was asking the tough questions.

[11:27] And a lot of people came at me.

[11:30] He threatened me.

[11:31] He was coming at me.

[11:32] And guess what?

[11:33] I was right.

[11:35] If it smells like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, it is a duck.

[11:40] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[11:42] People are getting their predator machines.

[11:44] Look, I'm happy if you get a predator.

[11:46] It's just not for me.

[11:47] I just cannot enjoy a predator machine without Arnold.

[11:53] It is that simple.

[11:54] To me, it is Batman without Batman.

[11:56] It is Star Wars without Luke Skywalker.

[11:59] It's just not going to work for me.

[12:02] That doesn't mean you can't have fun.

[12:04] That doesn't mean you can't be in Dutch's crew.

[12:08] I see they're using AI to make all these weird Facebook posts.

[12:12] With all the dealers and distros.

[12:13] They still have not sold 300.

[12:15] Can you think about that for a minute?

[12:18] There are about what?

[12:19] Like 8 billion people in the world.

[12:22] There are probably in excess of 20,000 pinball collectors in the world.

[12:30] And there are probably 5,000 hyper buyers of pinball.

[12:36] And there are easily well over 300 locations globally.

[12:41] That would love to put a new pinball machine in their arcade or operate it.

[12:47] Because new games bring in money.

[12:50] And you can't sell 300 of an iconic theme.

[12:56] A nostalgic theme like predator.

[12:59] That's an issue people.

[13:00] That is a real issue.

[13:02] But look, I'm happy you're getting it.

[13:04] I think it's a game that's just going to keep losing value.

[13:07] And I don't think they're ever going to get Arnold into this game.

[13:10] The way Alien eventually got Ripley into the game.

[13:14] What else is going on?

[13:16] I'm starting to see a lot of people getting nervous about Back to the Future.

[13:26] Old habits die hard.

[13:29] Barry is once again going a little radio silent.

[13:34] On people that want answers to where the toppers are.

[13:39] On some of these Alice games.

[13:41] The new Alice's are shipping with the toppers.

[13:45] The issue is it's a really intricate topper.

[13:48] So you need to design a special box.

[13:51] And you need to ship it in a way that's not going to break.

[13:54] It's a lot easier to ship it attached to the game.

[13:58] The thing is this.

[14:00] What Barry and everybody over there at DPX needs to know.

[14:04] And DP.

[14:05] Your company has a history.

[14:08] Of saying nothing.

[14:10] And what you need to realize is that silence is toxic.

[14:15] You made it so.

[14:17] So even if you don't have an exact time frame.

[14:22] Of when a customer can expect their topper.

[14:26] You can't go silent.

[14:29] You can't not respond to anyone's inquiries.

[14:33] About the status of their game.

[14:37] And so this is a thing.

[14:39] We need everybody.

[14:41] And I mean this.

[14:42] We need everybody over at Dutch.

[14:44] And it's not just Barry.

[14:45] It's everybody.

[14:46] As a company.

[14:47] That's the old Dutch.

[14:49] And I think if Dutch really wants to make it to Back to the Future.

[14:53] They need to never go radio silent again.

[14:58] How many total Alice's did they make?

[15:01] I don't know.

[15:02] Somewhere around like 300.

[15:03] Maybe a little bit more.

[15:05] That's a far cry from the 500.

[15:08] And now they got to get Raza on the line.

[15:11] What's going to have to happen at Dutch Pinball.

[15:15] Is the company is going to need to change.

[15:17] They're going to need to work harder.

[15:19] And longer.

[15:21] If they are to get to Back to the Future.

[15:24] And I'm a little bit nervous.

[15:26] They took off two weeks during the holidays.

[15:28] That was a pivotal moment for their company.

[15:31] You got to get as many of these Alice's in a box.

[15:34] As you can.

[15:35] So maybe in this year.

[15:37] You got to work harder.

[15:39] Maybe in this year.

[15:40] You can't take the vacation you want to take.

[15:43] Because you got to survive.

[15:45] And I'm still getting these vibes.

[15:47] That there's still a little cavalier about it all.

[15:51] And that Melvin has made these two games.

[15:54] To help them survive.

[15:56] And I think they need to collectively get together.

[15:59] And just approach this differently.

[16:02] It's all not just going to work out.

[16:03] Because you have Back to the Future.

[16:07] Remember when Lebowski came out.

[16:09] A lot of people wanted one.

[16:11] But their own internal issues.

[16:13] Are the reason why it all collapsed.

[16:16] So not for a minute.

[16:18] Do I think.

[16:19] Simply because they have Back to the Future.

[16:21] That that's going to fix.

[16:23] A lot of the internal issues.

[16:25] They need to work on these now.

[16:27] And getting 500 Alice's made.

[16:30] In a single year.

[16:31] Was a great thing.

[16:32] Was a great goal to achieve.

[16:35] And they came up way short.

[16:38] And that's not a good indicator.

[16:40] If you can't make 500 Alice's in a year.

[16:44] How are you going to handle.

[16:46] The demand for Back to the Future.

[16:48] Which is going to have like 10,000 orders.

[16:51] And so this is concerning.

[16:54] And I hope that this company.

[16:56] Really really figures this out.

[16:58] And they need to figure it out this year.

[17:00] This is the most important year.

[17:02] In the history of Dutch Pinball.

[17:04] And as I start to do the time frame.

[17:06] And the math.

[17:08] I do get a little bit concerned.

[17:10] Because if you have like 200 or so Alice's to make.

[17:12] And you now have gone on the record.

[17:14] To say you're going to make 333 Razzas.

[17:16] We all can say right now.

[17:18] Because it's already almost mid January.

[17:20] You're never going to get those 333 Razzas made.

[17:22] And you're never going to get those Razzas made.

[17:24] And you're never going to get those Razzas made.

[17:26] And you're never going to get those Razzas made.

[17:28] And you're never going to get those Razzas made.

[17:30] In 2026.

[17:32] Because Razzas manufacturing.

[17:34] Might not even begin.

[17:36] Until like June or July.

[17:38] If we're looking at the way things are going.

[17:40] They still have to make all these Alice's.

[17:42] Because you know they're not going to get 200 refund requests.

[17:44] And so what do you do?

[17:46] I mean you got to hire more people.

[17:48] And if you don't hire more people.

[17:50] You got to work longer hours.

[17:52] And you got to get it done.

[17:54] And I think this is going to be a test.

[17:56] Of Barry's work ethic.

[17:58] Of the organization's work ethic.

[18:00] That he can step up.

[18:02] Or I think it could collapse.

[18:04] I mean it.

[18:06] I think it could collapse.

[18:08] Because they got to get it together.

[18:10] I hope they do man.

[18:12] You know me I hope they do.

[18:14] I like these guys a lot.

[18:16] I can't wait to see what Dutch does next.

[18:18] I think unlike Stern they're going to put a lot in the game.

[18:20] But they got to get the manufacturing together.

[18:22] But they got to get the manufacturing together.

[18:24] They still in 12 years have only made 2 games.

[18:26] That's not a recipe for success.

[18:28] That's not a recipe for success.

[18:30] All right, what else is happening in the pinball world?

[18:32] Beetlejuices!

[18:34] The Beetlejuice production has begun.

[18:37] Everyone has game number 745, apparently.

[18:40] What's going on with that?

[18:41] It's like weird.

[18:42] A few people have the same number.

[18:44] I can't wait for this game to get out there.

[18:46] I can't wait for this game to be in the hands of all the fans.

[18:50] There was so much hype well-deserved for this game.

[18:54] And now I want to see what people feel about the game in their homes.

[19:00] I think we're going to see games going out the door by the end of this month.

[19:03] And then it's just going to be the year of Beetlejuice.

[19:05] All the way up until the end of the year when they announce Goonies.

[19:09] It's going to be fun.

[19:10] It's going to be great.

[19:11] I have to make a correction.

[19:13] On this year's Canada's Kudos Awards, I gave Christopher Franchi a kudo for Evil Dead.

[19:21] The problem is I forgot that I gave him a kudo for Evil Dead the year prior.

[19:26] So I need to change the game in which

[19:30] he gets the kudo for.

[19:31] It is going to be Beetlejuice.

[19:33] Okay.

[19:33] I was splitting hairs between the two and it's going to be Beetlejuice.

[19:37] I've had a lot of Stern people.

[19:39] I've had a lot of Stern fanboys come up to me and be like,

[19:42] I can't believe Stern didn't win anything.

[19:45] And someone yesterday said to me,

[19:47] Canada, it should have won for King Kong Art.

[19:49] And I'm like, are you kidding me?

[19:50] King Kong Art?

[19:52] I mean, it's fine.

[19:53] But man, no.

[19:54] Like, and I'm just going off of the community's feedback.

[19:57] There has not been any.

[19:59] Universal love for King Kong Art.

[20:01] In fact, the vitriol, a lot of the vitriol for Kong outside of lack of assets is the art package

[20:09] and how all the art packages look the same and how that comic book stylized Kong

[20:15] is not how you relate to King Kong.

[20:17] So no way was King Kong going to win over Harry Potter or Beetlejuice or Evil Dead.

[20:23] No way.

[20:24] In fact, I would put Dune way in front of King Kong for best art package.

[20:28] I would put.

[20:29] I would put Winchester in front of King Kong for best art package.

[20:33] A good art package really shouldn't make people upset.

[20:37] I'm just saying that.

[20:38] All right, everybody.

[20:38] It's going to be a great week.

[20:40] I'm really looking forward to it.

[20:41] How do you guys feel, man?

[20:42] I feel like I'm getting the cobwebs out.

[20:44] Coming back from the break, getting back into work, the weekly routine, a little depressing.

[20:50] I won't lie.

[20:51] It's dark out.

[20:52] It's cloudy.

[20:54] It's like you're tired.

[20:55] You haven't seen the sun or I haven't gone on a long walk in a long time.

[20:59] And it's like it's dark when I leave.

[21:01] It's dark when I get home.

[21:03] I go into the office.

[21:04] It's still pretty quiet.

[21:06] Everyone always needs like a Caribbean vacation after the holiday vacation.

[21:11] People have been asking me if I'm going to pinball at the beach.

[21:14] I don't know.

[21:15] My new company, we've been acquired and the PTO days are a lot less.

[21:20] We used to have unlimited.

[21:22] Now I have a very limited number.

[21:24] And so getting to pinball shows for me this year is going to be a lot harder.

[21:29] I've already booked Japan and Italy.

[21:32] I just can't burn like three PTO days down in Florida seeing pinball machines.

[21:38] I would love to, but I've got to put my family first and trips with Brenda in front of pinball trips.

[21:45] All right, everybody.

[21:46] I think in just a few days, we're going to see Pokemon teaser.

[21:50] And I think in maybe less than a week, we're going to see the game.

[21:53] It's about to get real exciting.

[21:55] Thank you for being a member of the Canada Club.

[21:57] We'll chat soon.

[21:57] Canada out.

[21:59] Canada out.

[22:29] Canada out.
