[00:00] Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye,

[00:04] Never gonna tell a lie, and hurt you.

[00:08] Celta, Celta, Celta, Celta, Celta, Celta, Celta, Celta.

[00:12] Uh, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:15] I'm your host, Kaneda, about to go on my break, and I thought,

[00:18] what better way to go on a break for a couple weeks?

[00:21] I'll be back second week in October.

[00:23] I might sneak in a show if Alice's Adventures in Wonderland gets shown to everybody,

[00:28] which I think it is in just like a week or so,

[00:31] but I'm about to go on a break, and let's break down what's happening in Pinball,

[00:35] because I don't think too much is gonna happen between now and Pinball Expo.

[00:40] Let's talk about Stern Pinball.

[00:42] These X-Men, Ellie's are on the line.

[00:45] There's a little bit of a delay in getting these games to consumers.

[00:48] I see distributors have them and dealers have them,

[00:51] but definitely these games are gonna make their way to consumers any day now.

[00:55] It is a stunning game.

[00:57] It is a stunning game to shoot.

[00:59] That being said, it's a very expensive game at $13,000.

[01:03] I think everybody has a memory of what happened to all those $13,000 Foo Fighters.

[01:09] Personally, I would much rather own an X-Men over Foo Fighters just because of the theme,

[01:15] but the big question mark, there is a huge question mark

[01:19] that is just hanging over this X-Men game, and that is the code.

[01:24] Will the code live up to be as cool as the layout?

[01:28] Will the code be as awesome as the artwork?

[01:31] Will the code have the originality and the creativity of everything else happening in this game?

[01:36] I think that's the most important thing about this game, and the problem is this.

[01:41] I don't know how you buy the game right now if the code is gonna take a long time to finish.

[01:48] And so, are we seeing moments in the software right now that are as exciting as the game itself?

[01:54] I think the answer is no, not yet.

[01:56] And so, if I were you, I don't think there's a sense of urgency or FOMO to get one of these LEDs right away.

[02:03] And I think by the time the code is done, here's the part about this game that's problematic for Stern.

[02:09] By the time this game is done, and the code is at a place where I think they're excited about it,

[02:14] and I don't think they're there just yet, it might be six to eight months from now.

[02:18] And then you're gonna get brand new games from everybody else.

[02:22] We're gonna get Harry Potter, we're gonna get maybe Keith Elwin's next, Dungeons & Dragons,

[02:26] all these games coming out, Spooky's next game, and so that's the issue.

[02:30] I think at these prices, Pimball Machines can't be revealed so incomplete on a software level.

[02:36] So we shall see what happens with X-Men, and then we're gonna get this Metallica remastered.

[02:41] It's coming any minute now. It's coming out in October.

[02:45] And if George Gomez is accurate, we're gonna see it not in a Spike 3 cabinet.

[02:50] We're gonna see it maybe be the last of the old Spike 2 games.

[02:54] New artwork, LCD screen, all the Metallica we love in a new package.

[03:00] And it's gonna be, I don't know, like it's gonna be interesting to see a game where there are already,

[03:06] like maybe five to six thousand Metallica machines out in the world.

[03:11] And now you're gonna make more.

[03:13] And after that, I think we're gonna get Brian Eddy's Dungeons & Dragons.

[03:17] I'm also wondering if that's Spike 3 or not, because think about it.

[03:21] I think Stern might reserve Spike 3 for a Keith Elwin game.

[03:27] I'm gonna call it here first.

[03:29] I think Spike 3 is gonna be Keith Elwin's King Kong.

[03:33] Here's why I think that.

[03:34] Because think about it, if Dungeons & Dragons and Brian Eddy's game is what was delayed

[03:40] to get to Jack Danger's X-Men, well X-Men was not designed as a Spike 3 game.

[03:47] And so if the game that was supposed to come out in September was delayed, that was not Spike 3.

[03:53] So I think it's gonna go Metallica remastered, Dungeons & Dragons,

[03:57] and then we're gonna get the introduction of Spike 3,

[04:01] the big new thing from the biggest designer Stern has with the biggest ape ever, King Kong.

[04:08] I think that is what's gonna happen over at Stern Pimbal.

[04:11] Alright, let's go to Jersey Jack.

[04:12] So we got Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[04:14] Avatar LEs are on the line.

[04:16] You can order one today.

[04:18] Distributors have them.

[04:19] The game has been streamed a lot over the last couple of weeks.

[04:22] I think the consensus on the game is this.

[04:24] It's a beautiful game.

[04:26] It's got a unique layout.

[04:28] I think Mark Siden has been welcomed with open arms by the Pimbal community.

[04:32] You know, he's a really nice guy, and I think all the good vibes from the media day

[04:36] are making its way into the coverage by the content creators.

[04:40] I still think it's a theme not most people want.

[04:42] I think when I watch the stream of Avatar, I'm still not getting that energy,

[04:46] that excitement of those big battles.

[04:49] There's a lot of question marks I have about the software.

[04:51] It's another game, much like X-Men, where the software is the big question mark.

[04:56] Now, the thing with the software with Avatar, it's pretty much done.

[05:00] So what you see is what you get.

[05:03] And I'm not sure.

[05:04] I just think if they stream this game over the next like two months,

[05:08] I'm just not sure that's going to translate into a ton of sales

[05:13] simply because the code itself, I don't think, is delivering like continuous,

[05:19] amazing moments of Pimbal magic.

[05:22] I just don't see it yet.

[05:23] I just don't see it.

[05:24] But here's the thing with Jersey Jack games because they are always so beautiful.

[05:28] They're like a beautiful woman.

[05:29] They're always fun to go out with, right?

[05:31] They're always fun to walk into a restaurant with a beautiful woman.

[05:34] It's like owning a J.J.P.

[05:35] machine is always something that brings people happiness.

[05:39] And maybe that's enough, right?

[05:41] Maybe Jersey Jack doesn't need toys because the game doesn't really have toys.

[05:45] Maybe they don't need synced up audio with the video because the game does not

[05:49] have synced up audio with the video.

[05:51] Maybe all they need to earn a spot into people's game rooms is the most beautiful

[05:56] Pimbal machines on the planet.

[05:58] And they are doing that unlike everybody else.

[06:01] And the thing is this, the CE is the only model to get.

[06:05] So I don't think we're going to see a lot of Ellie sales.

[06:08] I wouldn't buy an Ellie.

[06:09] The CE is going to have the beta playfields, the nicest topper maybe in Pimbal history.

[06:15] The armor is incredible.

[06:17] The three ink UV ink is incredible.

[06:20] And so if you want an avatar, I don't see how you buy the Ellie.

[06:24] Unless you're a streamer, remember people, some of these streamers are getting

[06:28] these games from their distro friends to help them move product because the Ellie

[06:34] is going to be what Jersey Jack uses to sell people on the CE.

[06:39] I think if you ordered an Ellie, I would cancel my order and wait for the CE.

[06:44] And also we know that Harry Potter is just a few months away.

[06:48] It is coming out in February.

[06:50] And that's going to be difficult for Jersey Jack Pimbal to navigate that as we

[06:55] start to turn the corner and head towards Harry Potter.

[06:59] Now look, Harry Potter needs synced up video with voices.

[07:02] You have to do it.

[07:04] If they don't do it, I need to have a personal phone call with Brett Abbess and Ken Cromwell

[07:09] and Jack Winari and just figure out what's going on here because Stern has synced up

[07:14] clips.

[07:15] Spooky Pimbal does.

[07:16] We can't be the only company guys that doesn't do it right in the software department, especially

[07:22] with all the effort we put into our games.

[07:24] And they do put in a lot of effort.

[07:27] We need to see way more toys on Harry Potter.

[07:30] Everybody knows that.

[07:31] I'm a little bit disappointed in the Pimbal community in general because the overall consensus

[07:36] is we're forgiving these companies for not having toys.

[07:41] I hear a lot of people talking like the shots are the new toys.

[07:44] UV light is the new toy.

[07:46] All these things are toys.

[07:47] No, they're not toys.

[07:49] We want to see more physical stuff that interacts with the ball.

[07:52] I want to see more environments in Pimbal, both upper and lower, that do magical stuff.

[07:57] Rock back and forth like the pirate ship, a bowling alley, and Big Lebowski.

[08:02] You're not going to win me over with a static crab that you don't even bash and he doesn't

[08:07] even move.

[08:08] You've got to be kidding me.

[08:09] The only place the crab moves is on the screen.

[08:12] We just need more and we need more in Harry Potter.

[08:15] The good news is this is Eric's dream theme, so I think it's going to be amazing.

[08:19] All right, Spooky Pimbal next.

[08:21] I think Spooky Pimbal is going to have the hit theme of the year.

[08:24] I think it's going to come out at the end of the year.

[08:27] My guess is it's going to be Goonies and I think it's really going to win people over.

[08:32] I think Franci is going to be on artwork.

[08:34] They've got Beetlejuice coming somewhere down the road, Evil Dead.

[08:38] They don't have Sonic the Hedgehog.

[08:40] So look, I think Spooky Pimbal is going to march in the same way they marched in with

[08:45] Rick and Morty.

[08:46] They have a theme that other companies slept on.

[08:50] This one's got nostalgia.

[08:52] I'm curious how many they're going to make.

[08:54] Are they going to make as many as they made of Scooby-Doo's?

[08:57] That's a lot.

[08:58] They want to make around 2,000 games per layout.

[09:01] That's why when they do a divided layout like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Looney Tunes,

[09:07] they're right there around like 1,700 games.

[09:10] They've moved into a new factory.

[09:12] They've got everything going in their favor.

[09:14] They've got a great artist.

[09:16] Are we going to see better toys?

[09:17] I think so.

[09:19] They've got the best Playfield company, Bader, making their Playfields.

[09:22] They've got a game now.

[09:24] And I mean this.

[09:25] I think Spooky Pimbal is at a point where this company is ready to graduate and behave

[09:30] more like a big league manufacturer and will they deliver a big league quality product.

[09:36] I don't think we're going to see it at Expo, so I definitely will talk to you again before

[09:41] I think we get any new news from Spooky Pimbal.

[09:44] I think it's going to be a December release and I think it's going to do phenomenally

[09:48] well for them because I think by December there will be fatigue on X-Men, Avatar, and

[09:54] there will be fatigue on stuff like Metallica Remastered.

[09:58] And I think they're going to release at the perfect time.

[10:00] All right.

[10:01] Moving on from Spooky, Chicago Gaming Company.

[10:04] I mean everybody now knows that the game after Pulp Fiction is going to be Halo.

[10:08] I don't think most people care.

[10:10] I don't know where these Pulp Fiction LEDs are.

[10:13] I don't think anyone cares anymore.

[10:15] They made everybody wait too long and because they didn't treat us with respect, I'm not

[10:20] going to give them much airtime.

[10:22] I just don't care about CGC.

[10:23] Now that being said, who cares about Pulp Fiction when you're thinking about what's

[10:28] next at CGC.

[10:29] You're thinking about Twilight Zone Remake.

[10:32] If they remake the Twilight Zone, I would be an idiot if I didn't predict they're going

[10:38] to sell a ton of them.

[10:39] They will absolutely sell a ton of them.

[10:42] And what's going to be interesting about Twilight Zone coming back, it's the most loaded game

[10:47] in pinball history.

[10:49] What do you price it at?

[10:51] That's what's going to be interesting because everything in comparison to Twilight Zone is

[10:56] going to look empty.

[10:58] And so if Twilight Zone comes out and it's like 10 grand, how are you going to charge

[11:02] 15 for Avatar?

[11:04] How are you going to charge 13 for like John Wick?

[11:07] It's just not going to work.

[11:09] And so I'm super excited to see a Twilight Zone come from CGC.

[11:14] Will the quality be there?

[11:16] There's been some quality issues with CGC.

[11:19] Remember that game Cactus Canyon Remake?

[11:21] You never hear about it.

[11:23] It's like nobody cares anymore about Cactus Canyon Remake.

[11:26] All right, so that's Chicago Gaming Company.

[11:29] Let's now move on to the company we won't talk about.

[11:32] You know who I'm talking about though, right?

[11:34] I don't think they have anything ready to compete.

[11:37] I don't think anything from them is going to come out before Texas Pinball Festival.

[11:41] And I'll just say this, it's never a bad time to release an amazing game.

[11:48] And it's never a good time to release a bad game or a theme people don't want.

[11:54] That is what's going to plague this company.

[11:56] And that's it.

[11:57] That's all I'm going to say on that company.

[11:59] All right, barrels of fun.

[12:01] Let's talk about them next.

[12:02] Barrels is a company we don't talk about much.

[12:04] The labyrinths are going out the door.

[12:06] And I think now the question really becomes, what's next from barrels?

[12:11] I think they might have gremlins and it might be gremlins versus goonies, barrels versus

[12:19] spooky.

[12:20] An interesting battle because mostly everyone over at barrels, at one point or another, went

[12:26] through the hallways of spooky pinball.

[12:28] So they are the other boutique company that is like really wants to make a name for themselves.

[12:34] And I'll say this, we don't hear about labyrinth much.

[12:37] I think for two reasons.

[12:38] It isn't a theme that most people want.

[12:41] But if you do love labyrinth, you're happy you have the game.

[12:45] I also don't think we hear about them that often.

[12:48] They're not making a ton of games a week, but they're also not games that are having

[12:52] a ton of issues.

[12:54] A really smart sort of first entry into pinball for this company.

[12:59] They obviously have learned a lot of growing pains about how to get a pinball machine to

[13:03] market and I'm really expecting big things from them.

[13:07] I don't think we're going to see the next game until TPF.

[13:10] So over the next two weeks, are we going to see something at Expo from Barrels of Fun

[13:15] that teases their next game?

[13:17] I don't think so because that would mean no more new sales for labyrinth if they start

[13:22] to look forward.

[13:24] Alright, after Barrels of Fun, who do we have next in the pinball world trying to sell you

[13:28] pinball games?

[13:30] We're not going to talk about home pin.

[13:31] We're not going to talk about Spinal Tap.

[13:33] We're not going to talk about Blues Brothers.

[13:35] Nothing big is going to come from that company.

[13:38] But Dreadigaming is remaking Funhouse.

[13:40] I guess if you really want a Funhouse and you want a beautiful version of Funhouse, knock

[13:46] yourself out.

[13:47] But I think for the most part, it is not going to be a game that is going to dominate

[13:51] much conversation come pinball Expo and as we head into the end of the year.

[13:56] Alright, after that, we've got who?

[13:58] We've got Abba is out now from the pinball brothers.

[14:01] You know, it's a game again.

[14:03] Like if you're an Abba fan, I bet you're happy.

[14:06] It doesn't feel like a game that's doing anything truly innovative.

[14:10] It's not that affordable.

[14:12] It's an expensive game and there's only one version of the game that I would get.

[14:16] There's only one version that looks good.

[14:18] So that's Abba.

[14:20] It's been out now.

[14:21] It feels like it hasn't come out.

[14:23] Right?

[14:23] I mean, that's just always a sign of themes we don't want and games that aren't doing

[14:27] anything magical.

[14:28] They almost just fall off the radar immediately, especially when companies like Stern are dropping

[14:34] like Jaws revenge codes into the world.

[14:37] It's like that one thing alone is more exciting than anything I've seen on Abba Pinball.

[14:44] Does pinball brothers really have like a lot more titles in the arsenal?

[14:49] I don't know.

[14:50] Some of these companies, like they just don't have any momentum.

[14:53] I can't imagine all these companies are going to survive over the next couple of years.

[14:59] So one company that will never die is P3 Multimorphic.

[15:02] You can't stop Jerry.

[15:03] He's going to do this thing forever.

[15:05] He's got more licensed themes coming.

[15:07] Now he's got to get people their Princess Bride machines.

[15:10] I think they're on the line right now.

[15:12] So I don't expect to hear a lot more about Multimorphic Princess Bride, but I am curious

[15:17] because I think Expo will be the first show in which more people will jump on this game

[15:22] and give it some time and get some reviews.

[15:26] An interesting theme.

[15:27] I love the movie growing up.

[15:29] It definitely has the nostalgia, but there's still something about the whole platform,

[15:34] which is really hard to sort of warm up to.

[15:38] It's a huge financial investment.

[15:40] And if you want to get out of it, you're going to lose your shirt, the kitchen sink and like

[15:45] everything else in your game room because it's like $25,000 if you buy all the different

[15:50] modular kits and then no one's going to come anywhere close to offering that if you want

[15:55] to trade it for something else.

[15:56] All right.

[15:57] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[15:59] Who are we missing here?

[16:01] How about Dutch Pinball X?

[16:03] Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[16:05] This is going to be the talk of October.

[16:08] I think Avatar and X-Men were the talk of September.

[16:12] This game, it is coming out.

[16:14] It is going to be revealed in just a week or so.

[16:16] It is going to generate opinions.

[16:19] This is not going to be a game where you're not going to have an opinion about it.

[16:23] I think some are going to be good.

[16:25] Some are going to be mixed.

[16:26] I don't think there's going to be anyone like really angry about this game.

[16:30] I think the price is right.

[16:32] I think he took a foam core J-pop concept and turned it into a working pinball machine.

[16:38] I think Melvin is going to get credit for that.

[16:41] Again, at the price point, knowing there's only 500, I think it's going to have a lot

[16:46] of attention because I think people might be tired of always getting the same games

[16:50] from the same companies, but it is a small company.

[16:53] You are not going to have the levels of resources and coders and all this stuff that can happen

[16:58] at JJP and Stern.

[17:00] That's not this type of game.

[17:02] This type of game is just more boutique.

[17:05] It's smaller team doing everything.

[17:07] It's a very small team who actually designed the game, but there's only going to be 500

[17:12] ever in the history of pinball.

[17:15] Will that be enough?

[17:16] Maybe 200 are in Europe and 300 in America, so barely any here ever.

[17:23] That's going to be interesting to see if FOMO can come from Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[17:29] Zombie Eddie worked on some of the artwork.

[17:32] The artist from the Big Lebowski finished the project.

[17:35] There's magnets.

[17:37] There's a big topper.

[17:38] There's a good price.

[17:39] There's laser etched armor.

[17:41] There is a lot happening in this game.

[17:43] There's a lot of scopes from Leor in the game, so you're going to definitely have an opinion

[17:48] about this game.

[17:49] I haven't really seen much from Melvin on this game over the last few weeks.

[17:53] I think he wanted to have X-Men and Avatar just have their moment on stage, and then

[17:58] he's going to drop with this game.

[18:00] I will probably have some exclusive stuff for you guys as we get closer to the reveal,

[18:06] which I expect to be sometime before Expo.

[18:09] That's just a little less than two weeks from now.

[18:13] As far as Dutch Pimball, we are not going to see back to the future until next October,

[18:18] so that's that.

[18:19] Is there anyone else I'm missing?

[18:21] I feel like I always miss somebody, and then I don't realize it until the show is recorded.

[18:26] Everybody look, there's a lot going on in Pimball.

[18:29] Prices are really high.

[18:30] I don't think there's any FOMO around any of these current games.

[18:34] I encourage you to jump on every machine.

[18:37] Make sure you really want it.

[18:38] Don't just order after playing it 10 times.

[18:41] Play it 10 days in a row.

[18:43] You're going to be able, if there's an Avatar near you, which there probably won't be because

[18:46] operators can't make money on these things, but I would encourage you to play the games.

[18:52] Don't listen to the blowhard fanboys on Pinside.

[18:56] There's a lot of multi-millionaires on there that just buy everything, and then there's

[18:59] a lot of people that can't afford anything who crap on everything.

[19:03] So somewhere in the middle, the truth lies, all of you know your financial position in

[19:08] life, and so I would just encourage you to make smart decisions.

[19:12] If you have games you love, you might not need more, and that's okay.

[19:16] I'm about to be away from the mic for about a couple weeks.

[19:19] I hope you keep your subscription.

[19:20] I've given you more than enough content over the last few weeks that I hope you come back.

[19:25] I hope you don't leave, and I hope you just respect that I need a little personal time

[19:28] for myself and my family, and I will be back better than ever in just a few weeks.

[19:34] Everybody, I love you.

[19:35] Thank you for the support.

[19:36] Canada's Bimbal Podcast will return mid-October.

[19:40] Have a great day.

[19:41] Oh, and thank you for all the birthday wishes from so many of you.

[19:44] If I didn't personally reply to you, it's because I just got so many.

[19:48] It's so awesome.
