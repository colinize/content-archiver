[00:00] It's the end of the world as we know it.

[00:04] I feel fine.

[00:07] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪

[00:13] Welcome to episode 470 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:17] We're coming at you from Ground Zero of the pandemic in New York City.

[00:22] Haven't left the apartment.

[00:24] Maybe once in a month.

[00:25] Crazy.

[00:26] Crazy times we're living in.

[00:28] So what I wanted to do on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast,

[00:31] there's been a lot of questions about what this whole thing is doing to the pinball world

[00:37] and the pinball industry.

[00:39] And I wanted to ask a pinball distributor.

[00:41] I wanted to ask Joe Newhart at Pinball Star.

[00:44] How has this pandemic affected your business, sales of new games that have just come out?

[00:52] And what do you think is going on in the pinball world with the different manufacturers?

[00:55] So really great interview.

[00:57] I'm going to air for you.

[00:58] Before I do that, just two quick news items.

[01:00] Two quick news items.

[01:01] Now, this is the week we've been waiting for all year.

[01:06] It is the trippies on Saturday night.

[01:08] I know.

[01:09] It feels like we already had the trippies.

[01:10] It feels like 2019 was five years ago, not just a few months ago.

[01:15] But this Saturday night, the 2019 Trippie Awards in which we honor the greatest in pinball

[01:23] or the most popular, however you want to skin that cat, is happening this Saturday night.

[01:28] Now, the good news is nobody has the excuse not to be there.

[01:33] You don't have to get on a plane, a train, or a car.

[01:36] You just need to be on the computer.

[01:39] There are invites out.

[01:40] If you go to thisweekandpinball.com or this week and pinball on Facebook,

[01:45] you can see the invite.

[01:46] The link to it is Kerry Hardy's YouTube channel.

[01:51] Now, they don't have the exact link to the show itself because that link will change when

[01:55] the show goes live.

[01:56] But here's what you need to know.

[01:58] The show is at 8.30 at night, Eastern Standard Time.

[02:03] So, do whatever you need to do with your time zone.

[02:05] They are going to start at 8 o'clock Eastern Standard Time with some fun, I think words

[02:11] from sponsors and different things going on.

[02:15] But here's what's fun at 8 o'clock, the chat room will open up so we can all get to our

[02:20] seats or our virtual seats early.

[02:22] I will be in there at 8 o'clock and it's going to be a fun time.

[02:26] So this Saturday night, March 28th, mark it down.

[02:30] Don't miss it.

[02:31] Let's see if Canada wins Best Pinball Podcasts.

[02:34] Okay, something else that I'm doing real quick is I'm going to start doing on my Facebook

[02:39] page on Canada's Pinball Podcasts Facebook page.

[02:42] I'm going to start maybe like a few times a week, maybe once a week.

[02:46] I'm going to do Canada Live Q&A sessions on Facebook Live.

[02:51] I'm going to do one tonight at 6.15, I think Eastern Standard Time.

[02:56] Here's what I'm not going to do.

[02:57] I'm not going to have like a schedule time every week because I don't want to be married

[03:04] to that time.

[03:05] I like to do stuff when I feel like doing it.

[03:07] I don't do a show every Monday.

[03:09] I don't do a Facebook Live or Twitch stream every Wednesday or Monday night or Friday

[03:14] night.

[03:15] Because I don't want you guys to get disappointed if I have to miss it.

[03:18] I also don't want to make pinball content or engage with talking about pinball if I don't

[03:24] feel up for it.

[03:26] I think that's fair because it takes a lot of work to not get a lot of money or really

[03:32] anything other than your enjoyment.

[03:34] But you'll enjoy it.

[03:35] For those of you who have joined Canada's Facebook Live sessions, you will get a little bit

[03:41] of me playing the piano.

[03:42] We'll play some guns and freaking roses.

[03:45] And we'll talk pinball and it's fun because you get to ask any question you want and you

[03:49] can sort of experience the Canada pinball podcast entertainment style live and in real time.

[03:55] And I think you'll see why we don't really need editing or segments.

[04:00] It's just good old pinball banter and I am who you get every week.

[04:06] This isn't some highly edited show that makes me sound entertaining.

[04:10] The last point I want to make and I just read this on Pinsett.

[04:13] I just, this just sort of like annoyed me and I wanted to bring this up before I let

[04:16] Joe have the airwaves.

[04:18] I saw people in the Rick and Morty thread attacking people that were saying for eight

[04:24] to nine thousand dollars, they shouldn't have to tweak their machine.

[04:30] They shouldn't have to remove screws.

[04:32] They shouldn't have to figure out how to fix design flaws in a game that should have

[04:38] been caught by the manufacturer or the designer much earlier on.

[04:43] And I'm watching Hilton attack people saying this game, this game shot perfect out of box.

[04:48] Now you can make a few tweaks and he's doing the thing he always does again where he's drawing

[04:52] his ridiculous little thin lines all over the play field to show you the geometry of how

[05:00] the shot is supposed to work.

[05:02] And I just want to say this.

[05:04] This sort of commentary on this whole thing is the most dangerous part of this hobby for

[05:09] me because these manufacturers and these designers, they have a responsibility to you the

[05:15] buyer to make sure the game you buy is designed right is manufactured right is assembled right

[05:23] is tested properly.

[05:25] So by the time the game goes into a box, the shots are figured out you should not not

[05:32] in a million years should not have to pull your game apart and start removing things or

[05:38] changing screw locations or opening up the shot and bending see what people are doing

[05:45] now is they're like some of the people are like bending the rail and they're ruining their

[05:49] game.

[05:50] And once you've been that good luck, you're never going to be able to get it back to the

[05:53] way it was.

[05:55] I don't think anyone should ever have to do this.

[05:57] I don't care if it's Rick and Morty.

[06:00] I don't care if it's the orbit shot on Game of Thrones.

[06:03] I don't care if it's the Alvira skill shot.

[06:05] Whatever it is, whatever it is, you pay so much money for these games, they should not

[06:11] need this level of of adjustment out of the box.

[06:16] But when I hear guys like Hilton attack these buyers who don't want to make these changes

[06:22] and they chalk it up as all pinball needs are just thing, the kind of adjustments that

[06:28] people find acceptable on a new in box shipped game is maybe a connection came loose.

[06:36] Maybe a light came out of its socket.

[06:39] Maybe something a screw came loose.

[06:41] Stuff like that.

[06:43] People should not have to reengineer the design geometry of a shot.

[06:49] People shouldn't have to bend things, remove screws.

[06:52] This stuff should have been caught.

[06:55] It's not an, I think, Chuck and Scott are trying to figure out a saw for people and they're

[07:00] going to make those changes moving forward.

[07:03] But the fact that we're attacking people who don't want to have to do that I think is

[07:09] a name.

[07:10] I think it's this arrogance of some people in this hobby who just want to gloss over any

[07:18] major issues with the game simply because they might be good friends with the company

[07:23] or the designer of the game.

[07:26] And that's what we know Hilton does.

[07:28] He does it every time.

[07:30] You got to remember this guy had the back of Kevin Coolick at Skit B. He had the back

[07:35] of Andrew highway with all the highways games.

[07:39] He called like for throttle one of the greatest design games of all time.

[07:43] I mean it's it goes on and on and on.

[07:46] And I'm all for Hilton helping people with tips.

[07:49] But to say this game comes out of the box shooting fine is 100% wrong.

[07:56] And it's not about learning the shots.

[07:58] It's not the own the designer of the game himself even said I'm sorry.

[08:03] I'm sorry.

[08:04] Something happened with these screws and it made it too difficult.

[08:07] He's admitting there's a mistake and yet Hilton won't and that is dangerous.

[08:13] I just want you guys on that thread to understand that that this show won't let that kind of

[08:18] behavior fly.

[08:19] And what's great about this show is I can bring up an issue like this and get you a fix

[08:24] like that put into the game.

[08:26] All games moving forward are going to have that fixed from the factory.

[08:29] He didn't fix it for you.

[08:31] It was this show.

[08:33] This show got Scott to respond and think of a solution and we did.

[08:36] But we didn't do it by attacking the people that were having issues.

[08:40] And it's just unbelievable to me the amount of things some of these fanboys will want to

[08:47] brush under the rug and say it's not a problem.

[08:51] And just know that can you just pinball podcast will always have your back and call out those

[08:56] people that are trying to prevent these manufacturers from hearing the hard truth of what they

[09:02] need to hear.

[09:03] And you best believe it that Scott Denise moving forward is going to make sure when he

[09:07] designs a game that he's not going to have this kind of issue again.

[09:11] And he's only going to get that way if he hears the feedback.

[09:15] And the final point I'll make is this I know Scott has a lot of fans and a lot of friends.

[09:21] But I do think it is pretty obvious that Scott would have benefited a little bit from having

[09:27] a senior design mentor help him with some of these shots.

[09:32] And I was just thinking about that in all of our careers and all of our professions when

[09:37] you're developing a skill set, having a mentor help you understand what works, what doesn't

[09:44] work is really, really important.

[09:47] And so then my question is, you know, at spooky, who's sitting over Scott and Chuck and

[09:52] anyone who's designing games Ben Heck, who's helping them understand the fundamental learnings

[09:59] of what might work and what might not work.

[10:02] And I don't think there is anybody.

[10:04] I think they played a lot of pinball and I think they designed their own games.

[10:09] But I would love to have a Dennis Nordman or a Pat Lawler or someone who has a lot of

[10:14] years, a John Borg in experience of designing games, helping them.

[10:19] You might want to open that up a little bit.

[10:21] You might not want to have nine shots, maybe eight.

[10:24] This is going to be too hard and too difficult and too frustrating for the player.

[10:29] If this game's about getting through 10 modes, you might not want to make it this way.

[10:33] With this shot being so important and yet so difficult to make.

[10:37] And that's it.

[10:38] Scott's learning, Chuck is learning, they're all learning, but it should not be at the expense

[10:45] of these people spending this much money on games.

[10:48] And I think that's a fair way to look at it.

[10:50] Alright everyone, let's find out from a distributor what it's like during this pandemic to be

[10:56] a pinball distributor.

[10:57] Canade is pinball podcast.

[10:59] Would like to welcome one of the nicest, one of the friendlies, one of the best pinball

[11:03] distributors in the business back to the show, Mr. Joe Newhart.

[11:07] Hey Chris, what's happening?

[11:09] Well, let's start out.

[11:10] Give us the release date for guns and roses.

[11:12] First of all, I don't know what you're talking about.

[11:14] Number two, I have no idea of anything about future releases.

[11:19] But nice.

[11:20] Okay.

[11:21] Alright, I tried.

[11:22] I tried listener.

[11:23] Okay, so let's start at the macro question is, have you seen an impact on your business

[11:28] over the last few weeks?

[11:31] Usually enough, not really.

[11:34] Cancelations?

[11:35] No, not yet.

[11:36] Do I expect that to possibly occur?

[11:40] Sure I do.

[11:42] I think people are going to be impacted by unfortunately losing jobs or value in the stock

[11:48] market.

[11:49] And I think that's going to have an effect on maybe people that have deposits down on

[11:57] games.

[11:58] Really though, at this time, we represent most of the manufacturers.

[12:01] The only game that is really out there in pre-order mode is Rick and Morty.

[12:06] And you know, it might be really hard for people to give one of those spots up.

[12:09] So, you know, time will tell and we'll see.

[12:13] As far as the business and new sales, there's actually been, I know it's going to be like

[12:19] a temporary little jump, but a little bit of an uptick.

[12:22] I think I've had a number of people that are looking to, you know, hunker down and create

[12:29] something for the home and for kids and the staycation type of thing that was a term

[12:36] that came about, you know, during the financial crisis at the end of the last decade.

[12:42] And I think that fueled a lot of, you know, pinball excitement and purchases where people,

[12:49] you know, wanted things to do at home and wanted, you know, pinball machines in their home,

[12:54] maybe people who aren't necessarily hobbyists.

[12:57] So I've had a few of those.

[12:58] You know, I don't think that's going to be any sort of, you know, maintained spike or

[13:04] anything like that.

[13:05] So, you know, right now, Chris, I, I, to answer your question, I would say things are, you

[13:10] know, equal.

[13:11] Right.

[13:12] And a little bit of a spike, but I definitely expect that there's going to be, you know,

[13:16] some ramifications of course.

[13:17] And then the flip side of that question, which maybe you'll, you'll be asking me about

[13:21] is, you know, most of these companies are shut down right now.

[13:23] Yeah, we're going to get to that because as a distributor, you can't even sell them

[13:28] the new products that are getting revealed right now because they're, they're telling consumers,

[13:33] manufacturing is, is halting.

[13:35] Let's, let's go right there.

[13:36] And I want to go back to Rick and Morty and talk about some of the new games as well.

[13:39] But one of the titles I saw you, you list recently was Hot Wheels and we know American

[13:45] pinball revealed that game at really an unfortunate time where it was like a week later, this whole

[13:51] thing hit and their supply chain got hit and they've just announced that they can't make

[13:56] the game as a distributor.

[13:58] I mean, is it, is it really almost next to impossible to sell a game that you have to

[14:03] then tell consumers that production is just TBD?

[14:07] Not really.

[14:08] We've had interest in Hot Wheels, pleasantly surprised both from home consumer and, and

[14:16] some operators initially, obviously the operators, they're all pulling their horns and that's

[14:21] probably a whole another question or conversation we can have.

[14:24] But, yeah, you know, it, was it an opportune time for them to show the game?

[14:30] No, because now we're in another situation where, you know, we've got to reveal and it's

[14:36] going to sit and I know, you know, you talk about it a lot and I'm a big proponent of

[14:41] these companies don't show anything until you've got games and boxes ready to show it and

[14:47] that didn't occur with Hot Wheels.

[14:49] I mean, they're really close.

[14:50] There are games on the line and even though, you know, they're out of the factory, hopefully

[14:55] temporarily, there are games on the line that are in various stages of being finished.

[15:02] So they did hold true to what they set out to do, which was pretty much show the game

[15:06] and then, and then be able to ship it very quickly.

[15:10] Can I ask about the launch?

[15:11] Because I heard from a few distributors and I want to know, Joe, because you're one of

[15:14] their main distributors.

[15:16] Were you a little blindsided the day they brought it to the trade show and I heard from

[15:21] other distributors, they didn't have price yet, they didn't have materials.

[15:24] What was it like seeing game that you're going to sell to people?

[15:30] You're not, you don't even have the full info.

[15:32] Did that happen to you as well?

[15:35] Blind like Mr. McGoo.

[15:36] Is there feedback back to American people?

[15:39] Like, how can we, how can we, you got to help us help you?

[15:42] You got your sweet ass there is.

[15:44] But, you know, here's the thing with that show.

[15:47] Obviously, it wasn't ideal way to do it and us not being prepared for it.

[15:52] That's not a good thing because we can't answer questions.

[15:55] You know, we're excited that the game's out, of course, but to get emails and tax and

[15:59] phone calls and not even know what the title is other than rumors.

[16:04] Yeah, it's a little frustrating, but in the same respect, their gauge for doing that

[16:10] show and doing it the way they did it was to show some prototypes, get some feedback

[16:16] on the gameplay.

[16:17] If there was anything that really needed to be tweaked between then and full production,

[16:22] they were able, they would have been able to do that by getting some playing time.

[16:26] And let's face the companies years ago before the internet and Facebook and everything

[16:31] else that people have immediate access to information.

[16:35] The Ballon Williams used to take a game down a bar down a bowling alley and wherever

[16:40] in Chicago and they would just throw the game there, go back in two weeks and there

[16:44] was no fanfare or anything and they got the data that they needed either from the game

[16:48] or from people at the location as far as what was good, what wasn't good.

[16:53] And I think this was American pinballs way to do that and keep in mind that if these

[16:59] companies are now going to gravitate towards showing the game and then having it ready

[17:04] to ship, they lose even though it's not good and trust me, I hate these long time frames

[17:09] between reveal and shipping and production and everything.

[17:12] But the companies do lose that valuable feedback that they're able to get by maybe doing

[17:18] a few shows and having to game out there for a couple months and if something's not working

[17:22] right, they can adjust it.

[17:23] And I'm not saying any of that is the case with Hot Wheels, but I understand why they

[17:27] did it and I appreciate that.

[17:30] And it wasn't a pinball show.

[17:31] They really, to be honest with you, I don't know that they even expected that the pinball

[17:37] community would find out about it if it was more of a coin up.

[17:41] You know, it just takes one.

[17:43] It takes one pin sign number.

[17:45] You know this, Joe, like these guys are, it's like cocaine and these guys are drug addicts.

[17:50] You can't drop a dime bag at a trade show with amusement devices and not have the right

[17:55] side guy find it.

[17:57] I understand.

[17:58] You know, it wasn't like I app it was a smaller trade show.

[18:01] So I kind of get it.

[18:03] Again, still we were blindsided and you know, to be honest with you, it wasn't the best

[18:07] situation.

[18:08] You bring up a really good point about putting a game on location to see what the response

[18:13] is and the entire industry and we're seeing this with Rick and Morty and I think people

[18:17] saw that with my initial review of the game is what if you discover that some of the shots

[18:23] aren't really working very well and you might want to tweak it before people play the

[18:28] game and I experienced that with Rick and Morty and we saw that Scott Denise and Chuck

[18:33] are actually now making some tweaks to the game at the factory that everyone will benefit

[18:38] from when they get their game.

[18:40] But even so, I would say that it does suck that people are buying these games for so much

[18:44] money now and the games have never been tested out in the wild, right?

[18:49] Because they need to keep that window of hype.

[18:52] They need to protect that window at all costs and if they let the game out there, it's

[18:55] not like 1986 anymore, right?

[18:59] It's on the internet.

[19:00] We've seen it and we're bored of it in two weeks because we're waiting for the next game

[19:03] and that's the new climate.

[19:04] And we're really picky, Chris.

[19:06] You know, and that's not a bad comment I'm making, but we're all.

[19:09] We're all really picky.

[19:10] We want perfection.

[19:11] These things aren't cheap and there are going to be some things that need to be adjusted

[19:16] on it again.

[19:17] They threw fish tails out there in 1996 or 2007 or whatever.

[19:21] They threw it on the bowling alley and nobody really gave a shit.

[19:25] And they still don't.

[19:26] Okay.

[19:27] So let me ask you about Hot Wheels sales because you're one of their biggest distributors.

[19:31] How have the orders been in comparison to Houdini and Octobre Fest?

[19:37] slower than Houdini and better than Octobre Fest.

[19:41] And I think the, and it's really not even a fair comparison to be honest with you in

[19:47] my standpoint because the game really hasn't been able to be seen yet by anybody or played

[19:54] for the most part.

[19:55] And that is fair because Houdini was revealed at T.P.F. and had thousands of pinball people

[20:01] through that show over the weekend where this didn't have any moment to be played.

[20:06] Exactly.

[20:07] And again, that's unfortunate.

[20:09] So do I think early numbers are indicative of its success?

[20:13] Absolutely not.

[20:14] I mean, I sold the game last week to a big toy museum that thousands of people are going

[20:19] to see that game.

[20:20] So I think it's a game that's going to have legs.

[20:23] I think it's something that the community had asked for, which is a lower price point for

[20:29] American pinball.

[20:31] And I think it's a fast and fun game from what I've seen so far.

[20:35] Obviously I haven't played one, but I think they're going to do well.

[20:40] And I think it's a good theme.

[20:41] I mean, I haven't listened to the last few of your podcasts just with everything going

[20:46] on.

[20:47] I've been a little busy, but I do see your Facebook post.

[20:49] And I know you've been poking them a little bit in the manner that you do.

[20:56] But to me, I think it's a theme that is a good thing for pinball.

[21:01] It's a toy.

[21:02] It's something that has millions and millions of fans.

[21:05] And I think everybody knows it.

[21:07] And I think done properly with the right sound and assets that the game would be fun.

[21:12] Right.

[21:13] And I think the thing I've been hard on is it clearly doesn't have the same amount of

[21:18] stuff in it.

[21:19] And it's priced accordingly.

[21:21] It's not priced at the same.

[21:22] But by design.

[21:23] Yeah.

[21:24] By design.

[21:25] So, you know, and I think American pinball was maybe in that uncomfortable.

[21:29] I'm sure you've talked about it and probably had the same opinion that they were maybe

[21:33] in, I don't want to say uncomfortable, but they were kind of in the middle.

[21:36] They weren't up in the Jersey Jack feature or price range.

[21:40] And they certainly weren't down in the Stern Pro range.

[21:44] I would always tell customers that inquired.

[21:46] I always did feel truthfully that an American pinball game with the powder coating and all

[21:51] the toys and mechanics and the LCD screen.

[21:55] Maybe the animations weren't as great as some of the other companies.

[21:58] But I did think that they put as much in the game as they possibly could.

[22:03] And I always called it an LE version game for a non-LE price.

[22:07] So I think they're looking to kind of put themselves in a position where this is who

[22:12] we are and what we are in position themselves between a Stern Pro and a premium.

[22:16] Do you think this will be the new model for them to be more affordable, operator focused

[22:23] with themes that collectors will also consider?

[22:27] I think so.

[22:28] I don't have any information on that as future themes or things that are being discussed

[22:34] or whether the makeup of this game compared to the others is going to be their ML going

[22:39] forward.

[22:40] So I don't really know.

[22:41] It will honestly depend on the success of it.

[22:45] I think the price point is great at $6,300.

[22:47] I think people are going to be more inclined to give it a shot.

[22:50] Do you have a street price or is that the price?

[22:53] That's the price.

[22:54] With all these companies anymore, the price is the price is the price.

[22:57] So years ago, we did have some flexibility with pricing and how I used it extensively

[23:04] Chris.

[23:05] I actually built my business up by a nice big reach on social media and email and a lot

[23:11] of times over the holidays.

[23:12] I mean, I would do Labor Day, Fourth of July.

[23:15] I would do sales with $250 off of Wizard of Oz or whatever the game was at that time.

[23:22] And I utilized some pricing flexibility that we had to generate interest.

[23:26] And it really worked well and it helped me build my business up to be honest with him.

[23:30] Every customer, I hope that a new customer I gain even if I'm making a little less to

[23:36] me because I try to treat people so well would be a customer that would always come back

[23:41] to me.

[23:43] But it was Chicago Gaming that actually started the one price, don't discount or you don't

[23:48] have to be our distributor anymore type of policy, no free shipping, no pricing discounts.

[23:53] So Chicago Gaming started that with Attack from Mars, very stringent and then other companies

[24:00] obviously followed suit, you know, soon thereafter Jersey Jack and American Pimba obviously

[24:06] spooky has always been the price of the price.

[24:08] There's just not a lot of fudge there to work with.

[24:10] Yeah, and just to clarify for the listener, because you don't carry stern and but I do

[24:15] here so many people with stern machines are getting like 800 to a thousand off.

[24:20] All I hear from people and it annoys me.

[24:22] I'll tell you, it doesn't annoy me as a consumer because I, is people are getting

[24:26] LEDs for around like 81 or 82 hundred bucks.

[24:30] Here's the difference.

[24:31] Here's the difference.

[24:32] Every other company aside from stern and I represent every other company aside from stern

[24:36] has the price.

[24:38] Hot Wheels is 6300, it doesn't matter what distributor you go to, the price is the price is the

[24:44] price and that's, that's, and I will mention too that when the companies came out with

[24:49] this model, a lot of our margins got decreased.

[24:52] We felt we had 250 dollars of fudge to work with at a time that we wanted to run a sale.

[24:59] A lot of the companies have eliminated that margin, that extra margin that we had to work

[25:04] with where we would be willing once in a while to give that up.

[25:08] Honestly, just can't do it anymore.

[25:10] There's not the margin there to do that and then still be able to support the customer

[25:15] after the sale and do everything that's involved with shipping and things like that and

[25:19] at least have something for your effort at the end of it.

[25:21] The stern model is different whereas they have an MSRP that's expected to not be the

[25:28] price that let's say a pinball collector is going to pay but the distributors do have

[25:33] very strict floors.

[25:36] So round numbers, let's say an LE is 9000, the distributor will have a floor number of

[25:40] 8500 that you can't sell under that.

[25:43] So in essence, it's the same thing and if you call any distributor, they're all selling

[25:47] for that floor price because they know where everyone else is so you have to compete.

[25:51] And I honestly think I don't know the logic behind it but they don't do it on the hot

[25:56] titles.

[25:57] I'll tell you that.

[25:58] Well, maybe, maybe not.

[25:59] I can't answer to that but that makes sense because the hot titles they could ostens

[26:02] because the stern have a policy of they don't have a policy that you can't sell over MSRP

[26:07] do they?

[26:08] No, of course not.

[26:09] And some distributors will do that.

[26:12] The MSRP thing, I'll tell you why I'm sure they do that is because you have a lot of

[26:17] their distributors that do a lot of sales on eBay and other areas be it front gate and

[26:25] online the sky mall and stuff like that where you get somebody that's just flipping through

[26:31] a magazine and they see a pinball machine and they're going to pay that price.

[26:37] So I'm sure they make plenty of sales at the MSRP at the higher price.

[26:43] So it does give the distributor some flexibility whereas they can market the game to the general

[26:49] non pinball public at the retail price and hopefully get a couple sales at that price

[26:56] and then sell to the regular people at the floor price.

[26:59] So, you know, there's a pricing strategy I'm sure behind that.

[27:03] You know, I'm not part of that.

[27:04] Just to confirm, do you know that $8500 is their floor?

[27:07] You don't know what it is.

[27:09] No, no, no.

[27:10] I, and I prefaced before that I just gave round numbers.

[27:13] I said, I picked numbers out of the air 9,500 just to show you know, the disparity between

[27:19] figures.

[27:20] I would love to give people that ammo and that info when they go to get their next game

[27:24] because I definitely know that while there is a floor, there's sweet hard deals in this

[27:29] hobby.

[27:30] So let's talk about Rick and Morty because that game sold out in four hours.

[27:34] How many Rick and Morty spots did you get in total at pinball star?

[27:38] I got 100.

[27:39] I wish I got 200.

[27:41] You know, I had the ability to take what I wanted and for the most part, we, I sold over

[27:47] time, I think 100 of the TNA games and they've made 500.

[27:53] So I did about 20% of the volume of what they produced.

[27:57] With Rick and Morty, I was vacillating 100 and 150, you know, when the hype was going

[28:02] a little bit, maybe, maybe 200, but you know, we also have to pay deposits on these games

[28:08] up front.

[28:09] So there are some calculation of risk involved that I could put myself in a tough position

[28:13] if I order and commit to this many games and something goes wrong.

[28:19] And at that point, I hadn't even seen the game yet either.

[28:21] So yeah, let's talk about that timing.

[28:23] I don't mean to interrupt you because I think that's really interesting that a lot of people

[28:26] are not aware of.

[28:27] So you as a distributor have to commit to the number you're going to order from spooky,

[28:33] how much earlier than even seeing the game and then announcing or teasing it.

[28:40] It's not as formal as you're making it out.

[28:43] It's very informal with spooky, but there was a conversation of they, nobody knew what

[28:49] was going to come out of the game.

[28:51] Obviously when he leaked the title, there was a lot of hype.

[28:55] So the only commitment that was really needed was for their planning purposes of how many

[29:01] they were going to lot to each distributor.

[29:03] You know, I've been a spooky distributor since their first game with America's most haunted

[29:07] and I probably do more sales than other folks that do sell for them just because I built

[29:14] up a clientele of spooky customers from the beginning.

[29:17] But it wasn't like a hard and fast, you know, you need to commit or you're screwed forever.

[29:23] And when I say that I didn't want to overextend myself or anything like that, it was more

[29:29] self in the standpoint that I would never want to say 200 games and then a week later.

[29:35] I'm like, you know, I only need 100 because I don't hurt my friends at spooky pinball.

[29:40] So it's more of a commitment on my mind, not necessarily them forcing a number.

[29:47] Yeah, I mean, everything was fluid, Charlie released the title and a teaser video and

[29:53] then we all started getting inundated.

[29:55] So we had a plan really quick as far as who was getting one and how many and I think they

[30:00] did a really good job with it.

[30:01] Well, let's talk about another question I have before we move on to the selling of it.

[30:06] When you're committing to a number from them, you said you didn't want to give too much

[30:11] of a deposit not knowing the demand for it.

[30:14] How much of a deposit do you have to give per year?

[30:17] For verbal allocation, like, hey, Chuck, I want 100.

[30:20] Then what does he make you do then?

[30:22] Uh, pay the same deposit you guys pay.

[30:24] So you pay 1500 per game.

[30:26] So you're paying 150 grand to get 100 Rick and Morty blood sucker additions basically.

[30:31] Pretty much.

[30:32] Okay.

[30:33] And that check goes to him before the games go on sale.

[30:35] Pretty much.

[30:36] Pretty.

[30:37] No, I mean, it's so it's a good point because I just, I think this is really interesting

[30:42] because I do think what I'm trying to do here, Joe, and this, and this, this, this always

[30:46] hasn't been the case with spooky and it's not necessarily a case with every company,

[30:51] but because they needed to plan their numbers, they wanted commitments from the distributors.

[30:56] You know, they didn't want somebody saying, oh, I'll take 350.

[30:59] And then the next week, the distributor could say, oh, you know, I got to think about it.

[31:02] Just think about the people and hopefully we'll talk about this.

[31:04] People buying spots that maybe don't really want it.

[31:07] The company does not want a distributor doing that either, taking up a huge allotment

[31:10] of their title and then throwing it back to the later.

[31:12] Absolutely.

[31:13] Yeah, it's not cool.

[31:14] Well, and I'm not cool.

[31:15] And the reason why I think this is good to know and I'd say it with more empathy and

[31:20] compassion for distributors is that you guys are taking a risk and a gamble.

[31:24] And I think my good friend over at Coin Takeer, Chris Marquette, the, the, all the money

[31:30] he lost with Dutch pinball and with J-pop, this is why because these games are pre-invested

[31:35] in with buyers lined up or buyers in mind, you would have loved 200 knowing how well

[31:41] it's sold.

[31:42] Now, Joe, you were at the center of a lot of anxious fans waiting for their number and

[31:48] talk about that somewhat of a nightmare-ish moment for you trying to keep 100 people happy

[31:56] with their allocation number.

[31:59] Knowing that you had the power to give one guy a game in two months and another guy had

[32:04] to wait maybe 12 months.

[32:07] I had no power, Chris, because I did it in a manner that I knew the shitstorm that was

[32:12] coming with this.

[32:14] And if you go back and look at my email blast, I think I even clearly put in there, even

[32:19] before anybody put a dime down.

[32:22] Don't expect the number.

[32:23] You could be first.

[32:24] You could be last.

[32:25] We get allocated all throughout the run.

[32:28] Don't expect just because you ordered it.

[32:31] I just listened to one of your podcasts.

[32:33] That was an older one.

[32:34] But I think it was your pinball babies one where you're talking about people crying that

[32:38] they were matching up the older number and all that kind of stuff.

[32:42] It only had me laughing in the car.

[32:45] And I had it.

[32:46] I had guys that emailed me.

[32:48] They still got a great number.

[32:49] They were like 150 or 212 and their email and me saying, I ordered it 10.04 and I'm like,

[32:56] dude, I sold 105 minutes.

[32:58] Like, do the math.

[33:00] But everything was done fairly.

[33:04] I didn't do the, and I had in the past with Spook, I'll be honest with you, with TNA or

[33:10] Rob Zombie.

[33:12] I emailed prior customers first and said, hey, listen, you guys were great.

[33:16] You supported this little company that nobody put a lot of faith in and you bought America's

[33:20] most haunted.

[33:21] I'm going to give you first crack at Rob Zombie and one of the earlier spots.

[33:25] And that worked then.

[33:26] And again, now we're 304 games in and I just looked at the number of customers that I've

[33:33] sold Spooky games to and everybody that bought Rob Zombie if I sold whatever.

[33:38] If I sold 75 Rob Zombies, they could have been 60 different people than bought America's

[33:43] most haunted or 50 different people than bought TNA.

[33:46] So I easily had several hundred customers that were, quote unquote, Spooky customers

[33:52] of mine that may or may not have been interested in Rick and Morty.

[33:55] There was no way that I was promising anybody anything.

[33:59] So anybody that sent me one of those, I'm interested emails.

[34:03] I sent them a very carefully worded email stating, I'm not, nobody's jumping line.

[34:12] Basically, I'm, you know, and I have a very concise way I do this.

[34:16] I send an email out with a PayPal link in it.

[34:19] Everybody gets a first shot.

[34:21] He's going to get that email at 10 a.m. or 10 or one and get the email.

[34:26] Read it.

[34:27] Don't read it.

[34:28] Click on the PayPal link and you're in and that's going to determine your spot.

[34:31] And that's exactly what I did.

[34:32] And then when I was done, I, you print out all the PayPal orders and you place them in

[34:37] order and it was funny.

[34:38] And I'm looking at, I'm dying because there were, somebody could have ordered like a 10

[34:42] or one 30 seconds and then there were within the next 30 seconds, there were like six orders.

[34:47] And I'm like, shit, you know, these people are maybe losing 50 spots because of 20 seconds

[34:52] difference.

[34:53] But that's the way I did it.

[34:54] And, you know, and I did a crisp because I didn't want anyone coming back to me.

[34:58] There wasn't going to be any, I wasn't going to allow anybody to say, oh, well, Joe did

[35:04] me a favor or something like that.

[35:07] Yeah.

[35:08] And because you know what, then my name, then I'm shit to everybody.

[35:10] Yeah.

[35:11] And I thought, I thought you were going to hook me up.

[35:12] And that's why I was like, I could get this sense that you were going to be an honorable

[35:15] man.

[35:17] And so I love it.

[35:19] I love the fact you didn't buy for me.

[35:21] Well, first of all, you can't sell everything number one.

[35:24] Yeah, let's talk about my behavior and what it means to be a distributor.

[35:28] But you know what you should do is you should print out how the orders came in and just release

[35:33] that information without people's obviously without their like any credit card information.

[35:37] But it would be funny just to show people, hey, look, this is how they came in.

[35:42] You know, what was funny is, you know, and then when I was lining people up,

[35:46] placing the numbers and lining them up, and they were just like, I had games,

[35:52] like I have all the games of the 50s.

[35:55] I have all the games in the 70s.

[35:56] And then I jump up to like 120.

[35:59] The difference between, let me put it this one, I was making a list, the difference between

[36:02] 50 and 70 wasn't a big deal.

[36:04] But the difference between 70 and 120.

[36:08] So it was like, oh, that first person in the 120 is like, oh, you know, you just missed it.

[36:12] And it felt bad for everybody.

[36:13] I mean, I felt bad when I'm doing the 500s and somebody's at 550 and the next one is going

[36:19] to be 625.

[36:22] But the good thing for me that was actually good for people that ordered from me,

[36:26] Smokey gave me all my games under, I think under 500.

[36:29] So I don't have anything on the back, back end.

[36:32] So people that ordered to me from me at least had that little benefit.

[36:36] Right. And now nobody's getting games right now because they're locked down.

[36:40] So the pain has swept over the shores of Smokey as well.

[36:44] I think they're going to finish up a few that they have in house.

[36:46] But because they get parts from Pimball Life in Chicago and Chicago's on a total lockdown,

[36:53] we're going to add a little months to our weight for Rick and Morty.

[36:56] Let me ask you a question about, has anyone with the economic downturn,

[37:01] has anyone tried to get out or asked you to sort of transfer their spot,

[37:05] which is an easy spot to transfer for this game?

[37:08] No, not yet.

[37:09] Do I expect it possibly?

[37:12] Right.

[37:13] But not yet.

[37:15] I know a few people I talked to, some of the folks that spoke in,

[37:19] I know there were a couple people this week that we're looking to move spots, unfortunately.

[37:23] And again, you don't want to see that,

[37:25] because you know everybody that bought the game for the most part,

[37:29] had their heart set on getting it.

[37:31] So you know what's a hard decision if somebody has to bail on it,

[37:35] especially on that title, that kind of waiting list of 150 people that want it.

[37:40] That's good.

[37:41] All you flippers out there, there's 150 souls that are ready to pay over sticker.

[37:45] Let me ask you about the other title that was revealed last week,

[37:48] which was multi-morphics.

[37:49] Can we do one thing?

[37:51] Yeah.

[37:51] Can we talk about the flippers?

[37:52] Let's talk about the flippers.

[37:54] How do you feel about flippers?

[37:55] I hate flippers.

[37:56] Tell me, you know what?

[37:58] I'm a real positive guy, Chris.

[38:00] And being a distributor, you got to make everybody happy and try to be positive.

[38:06] And I am just my nature.

[38:08] But I'm going to tell you, like I don't like seeing these games where people paid $1,500 being sold for $3,500.

[38:17] And I tell you right now, a lot of times people that are requiring about buying these games are checking with me.

[38:24] Like obviously they want to make sure that the spot that this person has this spot number,

[38:28] and he's paid and just confirming everything's okay before they pay them.

[38:32] I'm telling them not to buy it.

[38:34] I'm telling them to keep their money in their pocket.

[38:36] A year and a half is a long time to wait.

[38:39] And by the time, now obviously we didn't know, this virus thing was going to occur.

[38:43] But it just goes to show that shit happens.

[38:46] And things will occur in people's lives, whether it's another butterfly or pinball machine release that comes out that they have more interest in.

[38:55] I've had people cancel games because they're, they got to put a new septic system in their house or the car broke down.

[39:00] I mean, stuff happens and people will sell their spots.

[39:03] And once the spots that are sold to people that are willing to pay the premium for them and over, let the flippers profit.

[39:11] Once those people and it's exhausted that the public will not spend that much money on the game,

[39:18] then there's going to be people that are going to be selling them for what they paid for it.

[39:23] So I've been telling people that require and again, and then you're going to have people that just honestly need to get out of the spot

[39:29] because they lost a job or their car broke down and you don't want, they're going to say, I know I can make money, but I don't want to.

[39:35] I'm, I want to just sell it.

[39:37] Right. So let's talk through that scenario.

[39:39] Let's talk through that scenario.

[39:40] So let's say this, I'm in on Rick and Morty.

[39:43] I really want the game.

[39:45] I lost my job.

[39:47] I've fallen on hardship.

[39:48] You're going to say to that person where every penny counts that he shouldn't sell it for the current market value.

[39:55] If he has a low number game that people, I don't tell people what to do with the spot.

[39:58] I think I tell people who are inquiring about spending triple the deposit money or double the deposit money that I don't think it's in their best interest.

[40:08] And if they're just a little patient that they will get a game eventually before this year and a half is up and probably pay the same amount.

[40:15] 100% agree with you.

[40:18] All of these games, they're only worth over sticker during that hype window.

[40:23] The fear of missing out is the strongest right now.

[40:26] I absolutely agree.

[40:27] If you wait, you will find Rick and Morty's new inbox for MSRP easily like eight months from now.

[40:32] You want to know why it really pisses me off, Chris?

[40:35] It doesn't matter to me because I don't make any more or less wherever it goes to.

[40:39] And again, the work involved with transferring the order and dealing with a new person and rewriting a new order.

[40:45] That's just part of business expense and time that I have to expand.

[40:49] But why it bothers me is you know who should be making that money?

[40:52] Take a guess.

[40:53] Spooky.

[40:54] Yes.

[40:54] They're in Wisconsin.

[40:55] It's spooky pinball.

[40:57] Those are the people that are putting their lives on the line, investing in licenses that may or may not fly.

[41:03] Maybe again, they're going to take a risk and buy a license that nobody's going to like.

[41:07] And that's a risk that they incur.

[41:10] Those are the people that should be making that extra money.

[41:12] They could have came out and made this game $8,000.

[41:15] They could have made this game $8,500 and still sold them.

[41:19] But they didn't.

[41:19] What do you think?

[41:20] I'm paying close to 10,000 for my game.

[41:22] Wow, you're getting that.

[41:24] But I'm making money on it.

[41:26] I would argue this.

[41:27] I would argue this.

[41:27] I would argue that spooky is charging a nice price for this game.

[41:33] And most of them are blood-sucked edition.

[41:35] Most of them are going to be optioned out.

[41:37] And you look, you know, Dodge could sell a demon for 150 grand.

[41:42] But at some point, you want to make a product in which the second-hand market is stronger

[41:47] than even the first-hand market.

[41:48] It just goes to keep the value of that product for the guys who get in.

[41:53] But here's the thing.

[41:55] So I just want to circle back though.

[41:57] The guy who's down on his luck, would you recommend he give up his spot for MSRP if he could

[42:03] get more?

[42:04] I have no say in the matter.

[42:06] I don't even have an opinion.

[42:07] I don't have an opinion.

[42:10] And I'm not going to disparage anybody no matter what their situation is.

[42:15] They bought the spot.

[42:16] It's theirs to do it.

[42:17] Totally fair.

[42:18] You're a good man, Joe.

[42:19] You are a good man.

[42:20] I would say the company that is.

[42:21] I'm just saying, I don't like seeing it.

[42:23] Because you know what?

[42:24] You know, and I know that there's people that clicked on the buy thing for the sole purpose

[42:29] of, I don't really like Rick and Morty.

[42:32] But you know what?

[42:33] This thing's going to be hot.

[42:34] Let me see what happens.

[42:36] And I could tell you, it pains me because I have a list of 100 people that are going

[42:40] to love the theme.

[42:42] They love to think they love to theme with their kids.

[42:45] They love spooky games and or they they were out of the country when the thing went on

[42:50] sale and they missed it or bad.

[42:52] Too bad.

[42:53] Too bad.

[42:54] Again, you know, there's two people that want the freaking game that can't get it.

[42:57] There's people that are holding it and just want it to make a little profit on it.

[43:00] So yeah, I'm a flipper.

[43:02] You know what I say?

[43:03] I'm a flipper.

[43:04] You know what I say?

[43:05] You know what I say to those people?

[43:06] You had four hours.

[43:07] I don't care where you were in the world.

[43:10] Use a cell phone.

[43:11] I don't know where in the world you could be where something called PayPal don't work.

[43:15] Something called the internet.

[43:16] Unless you're like at Machu Picchu at the exact moment they dropped this game and you

[43:21] know for sale.

[43:22] But anyway, tell a friend.

[43:23] Hey, make sure you grab anyone.

[43:25] Anyway, look, let's move on to multi-morphic and P3 and Heist.

[43:31] Jerry's new game.

[43:33] How and you're your distributor for P3, right?

[43:35] Yes, I am.

[43:36] Okay.

[43:37] Is this the is this the nicest multi-morphic game you've seen?

[43:41] How has the response been as a distributor?

[43:44] I'm extremely excited and I don't want to say I've not been overly excited for a multi-morphic

[43:51] title.

[43:52] You just did.

[43:53] Because it's a niche product, it has nothing to do.

[43:56] I think Jerry is an incredibly intelligent guy.

[43:58] I think the platform is beyond what anyone else has done.

[44:03] It's beyond our comprehension.

[44:05] Beyond advancing pinball, but the gameplay and the themes just haven't been there.

[44:13] And Jerry did tell me, I didn't have any specifics, but Jerry did tell me.

[44:17] And I could sense the excitement in his voice two months, three months ago that what we've

[44:22] got coming up is going to flip the table a little bit.

[44:25] And it did.

[44:26] I mean, I'm excited.

[44:27] This thing's exciting.

[44:28] The way it was.

[44:29] The way it was.

[44:30] Which table are we talking about?

[44:31] Which table?

[44:32] Is it like it?

[44:33] No.

[44:34] I just see this table in the P3 office and Jerry just walks over and just, he's like, this

[44:41] is what I'm talking about.

[44:42] I just throw it across the roof.

[44:44] All right.

[44:45] The response has been great.

[44:46] It's been great on pin size.

[44:48] But as a distributor, have you sold new P3 now?

[44:53] Yes.

[44:54] P3?

[44:55] Were you thinking about that?

[44:58] Well, there's two questions.

[45:00] I didn't know which you were asking.

[45:02] There's the consoles.

[45:03] There's the consoles for which is the beauty of this product.

[45:07] And I'm actually happy that I think now with this game, people that have previously

[45:12] purchased the P3 platform, whether they bought Lexi or whether they bought Cosmic Cart

[45:18] Racing, now we're going to start absorbing and benefiting from what a great selling point

[45:25] of this platform was is that right now people can buy for 2750.

[45:31] They can buy the heist game and throw it in their module, their game that they have

[45:37] Lexi in and they've got a brand new game for 2750.

[45:41] Obviously, they had to make that investment up front.

[45:44] That goes without saying.

[45:45] But, you know, let's $1,750.

[45:48] But yes, $10,000 is what?

[45:50] Well, yeah, $10,000 plus $2,700.

[45:53] Oh, right.

[45:54] Right.

[45:55] Right.

[45:56] Yeah, and now they're up to 12.

[45:57] Yeah, no, I understand that.

[45:58] But they've got a platform that they can continue to build on.

[46:00] So let's see, he comes out with another game each year now that is at the caliber of

[46:04] heist with the toys and the innovation and it is.

[46:09] I mean, you said it when you saw it, like that's a world under glass.

[46:13] You post it on Pinside and you know, you look at the pictures.

[46:15] They did a great job.

[46:17] Yeah, they did it.

[46:18] They did a surprisingly great job from the standpoint that I think multi-morphic in

[46:23] P3 has always been about technology.

[46:28] And maybe I don't want to say a little less so on the gameplay.

[46:33] But the attention grabber was always the technology and the ball tracking LCD.

[46:38] And I think for Jerry to finally put both of those aspects together and have a game with

[46:43] great rules and also with toys, you know, a periscoping crane.

[46:49] The crane.

[46:50] Yeah, I'm going to say something right now that I think a lot of people would agree with.

[46:54] There is more in heist from a physical old school pinball standpoint than there is in

[47:01] all of stranger things, which is all old pinball like approach.

[47:07] There's more in it.

[47:08] Look at that back third.

[47:10] And if you haven't if you haven't played the P3 and I know a lot of people having, there

[47:15] is a lot of cool stuff.

[47:16] Those walls that come up that either block shots, I like this or sucked the ball in that

[47:22] you shoot into them is great.

[47:24] The fact that you have the LCD screen where let's say it's a mode, I remember I'm Lexi

[47:28] that was a mode with dragonflies that fly down the screen when the ball rolls over

[47:33] that you're killing things and you're gaining points by something that's a virtual and not

[47:37] necessary on the play field.

[47:39] But the rub always was you got this big open play field on the bottom.

[47:43] Yes, it's got the LCD screen and then you've got a very small module with ramps and things

[47:48] on the back.

[47:49] And there's not a lot of pinball stuff to do.

[47:51] Well, heist puts a lot of pinball stuff even in the standpoint of a third flipper now

[47:57] being at it on the right side of the game.

[47:59] And even some of the rules are kind of very creative.

[48:02] There's going to be a multi ball where as you advance through the different characters,

[48:07] you start a multi ball and you have to hit one of the scoop shots and it actually takes

[48:11] your ball away.

[48:12] It's a, I don't know what the terminology that Jerry used, but it was like a reducing

[48:17] multi ball where you actually want to release one of the people from jail, one of the characters

[48:22] from jail.

[48:23] And by doing that, you have to release, give up one of your balls during a multi ball.

[48:27] So kind of cool stuff like that that would make for good and unique gameplay.

[48:32] So in terms of sales, has it been mostly kits purchased by existing owners?

[48:37] Have you sold any brand new bundles or high standalone games?

[48:43] Again, we're a few days in it.

[48:46] Fools, yes, full games, not yet.

[48:49] But again, I don't think it's game.

[48:51] I haven't even done an email blast yet Chris.

[48:53] So Joey, you got to tell him this.

[48:55] He's got to send a game to Jack Danger to stream.

[48:59] He's got like, he needs to, this thing needs to be played and shown to people and he needs

[49:04] to put it in the hands because I, the first stream happened by one of his owners and the

[49:09] guy sucked at pinball and I'm like, oh, like it's just watching the guy drain like for 46

[49:15] and so I'm like, he needs to, it'd be so cheap.

[49:18] It'd be cheaper for Jerry to give like a streamer that's got so many followers, the game,

[49:23] then it is to take the TpF event.

[49:25] Yeah, they did do.

[49:27] I know Nick up at Buffalo pinball had done some streaming.

[49:32] Again, that was Cosmic Cart when that first came out.

[49:34] So maybe Jerry has some plans there either with the guys of Buffalo pinball or maybe

[49:38] hooking up with Jack Danger to do that.

[49:40] But yeah, obviously that's a great idea.

[49:42] I think it'll showcase.

[49:43] Even like the video, did you see the video they did?

[49:45] Yeah, it was great.

[49:46] You know, like the teaser, they great.

[49:47] I mean, great quality.

[49:49] It blew me away.

[49:49] I emailed Jerry and I said, they tried.

[49:51] They actually gave an effort.

[49:53] It looks great.

[49:54] I mean, it's better than it's better than what other companies are doing.

[49:58] Yeah, totally.

[49:59] Let me, I know you don't have too much time, but I want to finish off with with Jersey Jack.

[50:03] So big news, Jack moving from a place that you can't drive to anymore.

[50:08] Yeah.

[50:09] How do you feel about the move?

[50:11] And if you spoke about it, is he happy?

[50:13] Is he, of course, I have.

[50:15] Yeah.

[50:16] Jack, Jack is happy about it.

[50:18] Jack knows that it's the next step for the company to compete on the level that they

[50:23] want to be able to compete at and also produce at the level they want to produce at, which

[50:28] is multiple games per year.

[50:29] It was sad for me.

[50:31] That's really the only word.

[50:32] I mean, business wise, I think you talk to anybody, business wise, it's a no brainer.

[50:38] To have the design team in one spot and then to have production in another spot, I'm sure

[50:43] was extremely difficult.

[50:44] So I know it was difficult.

[50:47] Just like we're talking about spooky and, or even Hot Wheels and putting a game on out

[50:54] there for the public and then making some tweaks on the production line, I mean, spooky

[50:57] can do that because they're right there.

[50:59] I mean, you got the designer and the coders and all those guys that are there to do that

[51:04] on the production line and, and try things out.

[51:08] It's very difficult to do that remotely.

[51:10] I'm sure they've done it and been successful making some great games over the years, but

[51:15] obviously not without some hiccups with production and, and timing and capabilities and stuff

[51:20] like that.

[51:21] But let's face it, Chicago, there's more talent there.

[51:24] And I'm not going to say that moving to company at anything, do it stealing talent or

[51:27] getting other people to work there.

[51:30] But obviously that's, that's going to be an offshoot benefit.

[51:34] They need to hire people.

[51:35] They may be able to hire people that previously worked in pinball.

[51:38] Maybe they're not even still currently employed in pinball, but you know, there's a lot of

[51:41] people out there versus just trying to find people in Jersey that want to make pinball

[51:45] machines and they, they come and go possibly.

[51:49] You know, and, and then just having the designers and the programmers and the engineering

[51:54] staff there, all working under the same roof is, is just great.

[51:58] You know, the sadness was just, been it's tributes since the beginning and part of it

[52:02] was just me being able to hop in my car and drive from Pennsylvania to Jersey and sit

[52:06] with Jack.

[52:07] And as you stayed a lot, have a Jersey, Jersey Mike sub and sit there and walk around

[52:12] the factory and, you know, again, I can get on a plane when plane start flying again.

[52:16] And, you know, I can go and do that for sure.

[52:19] But it's, it's sad because something isn't there that was there that was close to my

[52:23] heart.

[52:24] But I'm really excited for the company to put the vision in place that I think they've

[52:30] been working towards for a while when, when Jack started the company and obviously also

[52:36] when Leonard and the investors bought the company.

[52:39] I think we're going to see a lot of that stuff happen now.

[52:42] Any, do you have any anxiety, any anxiety that this economic downturn could, could hurt

[52:47] them in a significant way?

[52:48] Or do you think they'll get past this?

[52:50] No, I, I, they'll get past it.

[52:53] It's, yeah, yeah, we're all going to have everybody's effect of Chris.

[52:57] Everything's going to be affected.

[52:59] I mean, would they possibly sell anybody sell less games?

[53:02] Stern's going to sell less games.

[53:04] All these locations that Stern sells, multitudes of majority, probably of the games that they sell,

[53:10] they're all shut down.

[53:11] I mean, everybody's going to hurt from this.

[53:13] Obviously, both of those companies are well capitalized with big pocket investors behind

[53:18] them that are committed.

[53:20] And this also shows the commitment that the Abbas family has for pinball.

[53:25] The easy thing would have been staying jersey and watching, wait and see how pinball goes.

[53:30] But don't think that this move is, is a cheap situation for them.

[53:34] It's not.

[53:35] They're investing a lot more money into doing this to make this a, a really stronger, stronger

[53:41] company.

[53:42] Has the move happened yet?

[53:44] I think it's in process.

[53:46] Obviously, right now, as we speak with things shutting down and, and even trucking is getting

[53:51] a little weird right now too.

[53:53] I've been, I'm still shipping games for folks, but I am trying to get them out to

[53:58] Doraid.

[53:59] I'd want one, one guy that had two games ordered and he's finishing his house and didn't

[54:02] want them to April.

[54:03] And I actually emailed him the other day.

[54:05] I said, you know what?

[54:06] I said, I kind of see some things happening and I know your room's not done yet.

[54:11] But let's get this game to you before you can't get it until, you know, May or June or

[54:16] whatever the case may be with trucking.

[54:18] They've started to move, I believe, probably parts and inventory.

[54:25] I'm not sure I would think probably the lines have been broken down and, and, you know,

[54:29] maybe some of that stuff has started moving.

[54:31] I honestly haven't asked exactly where they're at, but I think it's a process and I'm,

[54:36] I'm sure concurrent to that in addition to getting things moved from Jersey and put

[54:41] on trucks to go out there.

[54:42] I'm sure they're also tooling up and getting their space ready.

[54:46] You know, this is obviously something they've had in the works for months and months.

[54:50] They didn't announce it when it was an idea, an idea bubble.

[54:55] It's something that they've put in place, secured the location and started being able

[55:01] to do the move and decided that the timing was right to let everyone know.

[55:05] Yeah.

[55:06] Well, it was announced on this podcast first, but we'll just remind the listeners that

[55:10] we've broken.

[55:11] There's a lot of stuff announced first on this podcast.

[55:14] Joe, do you think that Jack learned anything or do you give him any feedback on the Rick

[55:19] and Morty, the way that things sold like wildfire?

[55:22] I mean, we've never seen a Jersey Jack machine sell like that many units in just a few hours.

[55:27] Do you think Jack took anything away from that in terms of how to sort of create that window?

[55:32] And I know theme has a lot to do with it.

[55:34] Scott Denise has a lot to do with it, but it was really, it must have been eye opening

[55:38] for other manufacturers to see that go down and to see, you know, what's in that game

[55:44] and then how much Jack is putting in his machines and to always not get to that level of

[55:49] frenzy when a new JJP game is available.

[55:53] Good question.

[55:55] You know, the Rick and Morty thing was really surprising.

[55:59] And I know you harp on the make things limited so everybody celebrates for it and wants it.

[56:07] I don't know.

[56:09] I don't really have an answer for Chris.

[56:11] I think Jack would have sold all 500 collectors edition wonkers had they been the first 500 games built, right?

[56:17] And speaking of like how that's definitely, yeah, that's definitely a thing.

[56:21] Yeah, for sure.

[56:22] Yeah, you got to make you got to make the the best model.

[56:25] Yeah, first class gets on first on the plane.

[56:29] How how is wonka sold in comparison to Jack's other titles?

[56:33] Well, let's not compare it to Wizard of Oz because Wizard of Oz is just an every

[56:38] title that that's got legs that everybody wants and we can never have enough of them to sell.

[56:43] So, you know, that's obviously their top title.

[56:46] We've been selling it for seven years and delivering them for seven years, multiple iterations of it.

[56:51] And they sell great.

[56:53] I get emails every week.

[56:54] I want this model of a Wizard of Oz.

[56:56] Can you get me?

[56:57] I still have people asking me for the kind of guy this week asked me for a green LED.

[57:01] I'm like, dude, you're eight years late, you know, like, well, don't they have the 12,500 hour ones

[57:06] with the new light.

[57:06] Yeah, yeah.

[57:07] Yeah, we have the we have the 11,500 yellow brick road edition.

[57:12] So those are still available.

[57:13] I thought Jack found like a few Emerald City ones and switched out the lightboards and was offering them.

[57:18] Oh, oh, yeah, you're right.

[57:20] You're right.

[57:20] Yeah, I think they were just like a key to those.

[57:23] Yeah, yeah, I know.

[57:25] Okay, so, so, okay, let's take Waz out and let's put Wonka next to Hobbit,

[57:30] Dildin, Pirates, which Pirates would sell more if they made more.

[57:34] Sure, of course.

[57:35] And then, uh, Wonka, where does Wonka fall in terms of like after one year of sales?

[57:40] Like, where does it fall?

[57:41] I really think they're and I'm going to answer this honestly.

[57:43] I don't have my numbers right in front of me, but I honestly think they're,

[57:49] it's probably equal to maybe Dildin was a hair less than Hobbit and Wonka.

[57:55] I would think Wonka and Hobbit were pretty close, um, in terms of sales.

[58:00] And let's just take around numbers.

[58:02] Let's say, you know, they sell more than this, but let's say I sell

[58:05] 100 of her particular J.J.B. title.

[58:08] You know, let's say Wonka's at 100, Hobbit would probably be at 100,

[58:12] and maybe Dildin would be 80, 85, and then Pirates would probably

[58:18] 80, 85, but should have been 200, um, and would have been 150 if it wasn't for

[58:24] the whole negativity with the spinning disc, which was nothing about nothing in my opinion.

[58:30] Yeah.

[58:30] Yeah.

[58:31] Well, and there was a year delay with Hobbit production because of

[58:35] right having to retool it and probably recode that part of the game.

[58:39] And because it was shown too soon, I mean, you know,

[58:43] you know, why they did that?

[58:45] And why did they do that?

[58:46] All right.

[58:46] I don't know.

[58:47] I know I heard you on the podcast say that, you know,

[58:51] thought the investors were getting antsy of used dials in sales.

[58:54] I mean, just make, make the stuff up sometimes, but,

[58:58] I mean, I don't know.

[58:59] I don't know.

[58:59] I think, I think it's just human nature.

[59:02] I think it's human nature that when they've got a prototype that is ready to show,

[59:07] they're excited just like we are.

[59:09] And that's just not Jersey Jack, but any company.

[59:11] Look at American pinball with hot wheels.

[59:14] Like they were excited to show somebody that game.

[59:16] They could even stir and pinball the most successful company in the history of pinball.

[59:20] They've never shown anything early.

[59:22] I, I, again, I'm not saying what's right or wrong.

[59:25] You ask me why they do it.

[59:26] And the reason they get it is because they were excited.

[59:29] They got excited and they basically made it impossible to sell the game.

[59:32] It's a fully engineered.

[59:33] And, you know, my argument with, not an argument, but my, my conversation that I had with a lot of people,

[59:39] you know, when the spinning disk thing was going on.

[59:43] Number one, I'm not a fan of spinning disks.

[59:45] So to have three concentric disks,

[59:49] throwing the ball over the place, to me, that's not pinball.

[59:52] That's randomness.

[59:53] You know, that's throwing the ball down the middle.

[59:54] To me off, especially in that position.

[59:57] So going to one disk, I actually liked.

[59:59] I thought, you know, now it's a cool toy.

[01:00:01] Now it's not too crazy.

[01:00:03] And I didn't think it was a big deal.

[01:00:06] The big deal was, is that something was showing and something was promised.

[01:00:10] And then something different was, you know,

[01:00:13] and that's a mistake in the marketing and the showing of the game,

[01:00:17] which that lesson I'm sure has been learned.

[01:00:20] But, you know, I don't, I don't know that they, they did that with any ill intention,

[01:00:26] other than the fact that they thought they would be shipping soon.

[01:00:29] And maybe they didn't have a firm grasp on how long it would take to get parts from vendors.

[01:00:33] And again, it was just, you know, a decision that was made.

[01:00:37] That was the right one.

[01:00:38] Do you wish you could just order more pirates?

[01:00:41] And if you ask Jack, like, come on, man, like the buyers are there.

[01:00:44] Like, what do we do?

[01:00:45] Every time I might talk to them.

[01:00:47] But we don't know what's going to happen.

[01:00:49] But, you know, here's another, here's a, is he still a firm now?

[01:00:52] No, he's never said firm no to me.

[01:00:54] I don't know if he said it publicly anywhere.

[01:00:57] But no, there's no firm no on anything.

[01:01:00] They can go back and probably remake any title,

[01:01:03] renew a license that maybe is expired.

[01:01:05] I don't know.

[01:01:07] But this is another big thing and a big advantage about going to Chicago.

[01:01:12] You know, they used to have a secondary line in Jersey.

[01:01:14] And they had the room that if they wanted to rerun,

[01:01:17] let's say 50 or 100 Wizard of Oz's during dialed in,

[01:01:20] they would be able to do that.

[01:01:22] I think at the size of what they're going to have now in Chicago,

[01:01:27] they very well may have two lines running concurrently at different times.

[01:01:30] Like, you know, when this next game comes out,

[01:01:32] I shouldn't even say anything because I'm just, I'm just,

[01:01:34] it's guns and roads just like talk talk talk.

[01:01:37] No, I'm not saying title.

[01:01:38] Joe, Joe, Joe, just make it feel better.

[01:01:39] Just produce another game.

[01:01:41] But just to make you feel better, slash in an interview already announced it.

[01:01:46] Okay, so like it's okay.

[01:01:48] It's okay.

[01:01:48] I don't know.

[01:01:49] I don't know.

[01:01:50] Knowing Jack, it'll probably be, it'll probably be guns and roses without Axel

[01:01:53] Rosen.

[01:01:53] It because you know, it's like that's a,

[01:01:55] Jackson always got to find a way to keep one of the assets you really want out of the game.

[01:01:59] It's pirates without Johnny.

[01:02:00] Oh, man, I was going to buy you the will you want a soundtrack to shut you up at one point.

[01:02:04] Like, yeah, you were just crazy.

[01:02:05] I've like, dude, watched the movie.

[01:02:06] I'll sing you a song.

[01:02:08] So I think it, look, it mixed, it would make total sense to run guns and roses

[01:02:13] and pirates of the Caribbean in 2020.

[01:02:15] And I think that would make total sense for him.

[01:02:17] What a juggernaut.

[01:02:18] What a juggernaut that would be.

[01:02:19] Give the, give the enthusiasts what they want.

[01:02:22] And I think gun, I think guns and roses is going to be a sales phenomenal phenomenon.

[01:02:26] I think people underestimate the popularity of the musical act.

[01:02:31] That's the biggest touring act in the world over the last three years.

[01:02:35] 90 million albums sold.

[01:02:38] How many albums has like what, what, what music?

[01:02:41] Primus sold, you know, or I think guns and roses outsells kiss.

[01:02:45] I think, I don't know, they probably did.

[01:02:47] Anyway, Joe, I know you got to go.

[01:02:48] I know you took the time that we were at the hour.

[01:02:51] Thank you so much for joining the show.

[01:02:54] For those of you out there, Joe, you just let everyone know which you covered.

[01:02:58] You just you distribute everything but stern pretty much, right?

[01:03:01] Yeah, we do, we do Jersey Jack Chicago gaming that does the remakes.

[01:03:06] Spooky pinball, American pinball, VP camps, which are the virtual machines.

[01:03:13] The vertigos to stand up things that people love playing at shows that we do.

[01:03:17] I do multi-morphic.

[01:03:19] We are distributors for home pin and don't forget about those guys, Chris.

[01:03:23] Yeah, well, how could I forget about home pin?

[01:03:26] There may be more coming out from them at some point in time that you might be interested in.

[01:03:30] All two thunderbirds that you sold a come on.

[01:03:33] You never take my money.

[01:03:34] You get to mark my words.

[01:03:36] You mark, you mark this episode and this time and maybe one day there will be something

[01:03:43] you'll be really interested in.

[01:03:44] For four words, they've never heard our take my money now.

[01:03:52] Team pinball we've sold games for too, but they're doing some other projects right now.

[01:03:56] Has deep root, yeah, they're doing janitorial services right now over at Team pinball.

[01:04:02] I'm too mean. Has deep root reached out to you at all? Have you been in conversations with

[01:04:07] Robert about potential?

[01:04:08] No, I don't have any contact with them in any capability or manner.

[01:04:13] And lastly, Joe, you're going to watch the Twippy Saturday night?

[01:04:16] I am. I've missed the trippy, the Twippy shows and tech trippies.

[01:04:24] They push off the trippies.

[01:04:25] The trippies.

[01:04:28] I've missed the shows because usually when I go to TPS, I'm either working or my wife

[01:04:35] and I take a night out to go hit the town and go to a nice dinner and stuff like that.

[01:04:41] But I am, I have it on my calendar. I can't wait.

[01:04:44] I think Jeff has done a good job with some new talent that he had a scrambled to do at the

[01:04:51] last minute to put on a good show. And I think it's good. I think the timing is great.

[01:04:57] And I'm excited that they're able to do it remotely, not at the show.

[01:05:02] And I think it's going to be a good thing for the hobby at this point in time where everybody's.

[01:05:06] Yeah, it's the only thing we have to look forward to over the next few weeks.

[01:05:09] And here's the good part.

[01:05:10] Everybody is in attendance this year because all you know is a computer.

[01:05:14] Right. Awesome.

[01:05:15] Are you going to wear a tux like even at home?

[01:05:18] Well, I should dress up for it.

[01:05:19] Yeah, what I'm doing is my friends here.

[01:05:21] We're going to do a little virtual hangout.

[01:05:23] So we're going to put it on the TV and then on the laptops, we'll do a little virtual hangouts

[01:05:28] and this all sort of like watch together live at a 30 Eastern standard time on Saturday.

[01:05:34] Joe, thank you so much.

[01:05:35] Stay healthy.

[01:05:36] You know, you should, you know, you should do Chris.

[01:05:38] If you win, you should take one of your prior trip twippies and run up and down the street,

[01:05:44] high-fiving people.

[01:05:45] Oh, you're not supposed to touch people by now.

[01:05:46] Yeah, well, I'll just say this.

[01:05:48] If I do win, there might be a fun surprise for my fans on the show.

[01:05:52] I'm ready.

[01:05:53] Excellent.

[01:05:54] I think I think I might have a good chance this year.

[01:05:56] I think everyone like bailed out right when like the last months were happening for voting

[01:06:00] and everything was great.

[01:06:01] Great timing, guys.

[01:06:02] Thank you for paving the way for the dynasty that is Canadian Spinball podcast.

[01:06:06] I think you did a really good thing last year.

[01:06:08] Chris, even though it was a very, very painful experience for distributors and for companies.

[01:06:14] And you may have beat the dead horse a little bit too much, but you really did a good job with

[01:06:19] the whole play field issue thing and keeping it in the forefront for quite a while.

[01:06:22] So I think just based on that, aside from the entertainment value, I think you did a good thing

[01:06:28] in looking out for the community.

[01:06:31] Trying to do that.

[01:06:31] I mean, who got Chuck to start to open up that shot in Rick and Morty?

[01:06:37] It wasn't any of the pin-side bickering.

[01:06:39] We went, we played the game, we talked to the designer, and we came up with a sob.

[01:06:43] And now everyone who gets a Rick and Morty is going to have that fix happen from the factory

[01:06:47] thanks to yours truly.

[01:06:49] Not Hillton.

[01:06:50] I want you to sign my game, please.

[01:06:52] You know, I already signed every game.

[01:06:55] Chuck sent me every translate.

[01:06:56] It just says, canate a real big across the translate.

[01:06:59] Sorry guys, it's just part of the agreement.

[01:07:01] All right, brother, stay healthy.

[01:07:03] Okay, Chris.

[01:07:03] The best to you and your family, and we're all going through crazy times.

[01:07:06] And everyone, come hang out Saturday night at the Twippies.

[01:07:08] It's going to be a lot of fun.

[01:07:09] Joe will be there, canate will be there.

[01:07:11] We'll all have a good time.

[01:07:12] All right, buddy.

[01:07:12] Thanks so much.

[01:07:13] All right, brother.

[01:07:22] All right.

[01:07:22] It's the end of my life.

[01:07:25] It says we know it.

[01:07:27] I feel fine.
