[00:00] Bait the impromade on that

[00:02] For something I might as it

[00:05] Pleat and I forget my past

[00:08] The future looks bright

[00:10] But hey, I don't be cruel

[00:12] Who hard is true?

[00:19] Welcome to episode 622 of the world's favorite pinball podcast, Amir Host, Canada

[00:25] And we might be a little bit cruel on this episode now. I'm not gonna be really cruel

[00:29] But I'm gonna say some stuff that is gonna ruffle some feathers

[00:34] I will take the arrows in the back

[00:36] But everything I'm about to tell you on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast

[00:40] I firmly believe and I know a lot of you out there a lot of you out there believe this too

[00:45] And that is why the Canadian Army just keeps on growing we are now at

[00:51] 208 people on Patreon. I want to welcome Brian robin rich Michael Lee

[00:58] Eric and Aaron to the party this just does not stop and thank you so much for the support

[01:03] Here's what we're gonna do and this is gonna be a fun episode

[01:06] I'm gonna not hold back when I talk about a few things right now

[01:09] And I want to just tell you how I feel about some stuff and I'm not trying to be cruel

[01:13] I'm just trying to tell you what's been going on in the pinball world now

[01:17] The first thing I need to talk about is this great news and I'm not gonna be cruel here is that friend of the show and

[01:24] Long time pinball streamer probably the greatest pinball streamer of all time this man has the ability to play pinball

[01:33] entertain you and follow the twitch chat as it's happening in real time all while he's playing a pinball machine

[01:40] You know him as Jack danger four time twippy award winner for best pinball streamer mr. Jack danger is now

[01:49] Contracted by stern pinball and helped make and is the designer on the new Jurassic Park pinball machine

[01:56] I just want to say first and foremost Jack

[01:59] Congratulations, I think I called this I said Jack danger was gonna be designing with stern pinball and here it is

[02:05] Canada's right once again. This is really good news and it's great to see Jack danger joining stern pinball

[02:11] I mean, I love that he says I'm a contractor. I'm a contractor. I'm not working with stern

[02:16] It's like saying Lyman Sheets is not working at CGC if you're

[02:21] Contracted by only one pinball company and you've never worked for another pinball company or taken pay from them

[02:28] You're pretty much working at stern pinball. He's wearing a stern jacket

[02:32] I mean when I go on the stern website whose face do I see wearing all of the stern merchandise?

[02:38] It's no other then mr. Jack danger maybe the most handsome man in pinball next to canada

[02:43] So what do I think about the Jurassic Park home edition? I think this game looks better than Led Zeppelin Pro

[02:51] I really do I think this game looks like the best home version stern has ever made this thing has dropped targets

[02:59] It has a moving mech. It has the big T-Rex head that locks the ball and then spits them out when you look at this game

[03:06] It looks like a lot of fun. It looks like oh my god

[03:10] Stern can actually make a home game that everyone is not laughing at there is nothing

[03:16] I would change in this game for the price point other than one thing

[03:19] There's one thing that is just so embarrassing so sad looking and it's that tiny little display between the speakers stern

[03:28] Come on we know that an LCD display is like 30 bucks at most and this is still a

[03:36] 4500 dollar item. I still don't understand why the display looks so bad

[03:42] We all know that screens are cheap. I don't know right?

[03:45] It's like everything looks beautiful on the play field the cabinet looks great the translate looks great

[03:50] And then you see that tiny little display and that is the only thing I would change if I were stern

[03:56] But when you think about it right when people go into a distributor or a showroom and are looking for a pinball machine

[04:03] This is probably the best theme that has such a mainstream audience

[04:08] It's dinosaurs and when you're shopping for a pinball machine for your family and you're not a diehard

[04:14] Right you don't care about deep rule sets. You don't care about wizard modes even though this has two wizard modes in it

[04:21] If you just want an entry level pinball machine

[04:24] This is probably the best entry level pinball machine of all time and there's something to be said for that and nobody and

[04:33] Really nobody has service that side of the market

[04:36] You know, I always argue that p3 multi-morphic is probably the best machine to learn pinball on but it's $10,000

[04:43] That's not an entry level price

[04:44] So for 4599 which is the MSRP you can order from stern today the Jurassic Park home edition

[04:53] I did find the quote pretty funny from Gary Stern. He says

[04:56] Jurassic Park is an iconic film featuring something we all love

[05:01] Dinosaurs the Jurassic Park pin is designed to provide quality family entertainment and bring pinball fun to homes

[05:10] Everywhere said Gary Stern this game will be an incredible addition to any home any home Gary said really Gary

[05:18] Do you think this would be a great addition Gary to a single parent home in which they're under water and debt and they need to buy

[05:23] A $4,500 pinball machine. I'm not so sure this would be a great addition to any home

[05:30] But it's definitely a great addition to homes that are looking to have a pinball experience

[05:35] It's easy to play it's easy to figure out. It's a theme everyone relates to and my god

[05:40] Did they slap the Jurassic Park logo in enough places on this machine?

[05:44] I mean take a look there's like six times you can see the Jurassic Park logo just looking at the game front-on

[05:49] It was great seeing Jack on the twitch AMA yesterday that he did in which he talked about the great challenge

[05:54] He had to overcome by putting so much into this game with the low bomb that it had and I think he did a great job

[06:01] I also think we will see Jack dangerous talents on more stern machines moving forward

[06:07] I think he is going to join the stern design team what else is happening with stern pinball

[06:12] So Godzilla pros are shipping right now. They're out on location

[06:16] I'm waiting for jack bar to get their Godzilla pros so I can go try this game out

[06:21] The Ellie's are also on the line. These are the ones that are going overseas

[06:24] But I expect stern to have every Ellie in everyone's home by Thanksgiving, which is amazing

[06:32] Something I've been noticing is that this Godzilla game is the most universally

[06:37] Applauded game by the community right now

[06:40] I am seeing so many people so happy about Godzilla

[06:44] And that's a good thing we all want to have games where we all can rally around them

[06:49] And appreciate the greatness that is pinball and I think Godzilla is that game

[06:55] Now when people say this is like the game that everyone is loving on launch

[06:58] Well, there was another game that had equally the same amount of enthusiasm and love

[07:03] And that was guns and roses and when the guns and roses launch happened

[07:07] It was incredible

[07:09] Everybody was blown away

[07:11] The launch video for GnR was the greatest launch video ever for pinball

[07:15] Nothing will top that like Godzilla didn't have that moment right it did not have that moment

[07:20] In which everyone saw it for the first time and was like oh my god

[07:23] It just didn't now the question is this we know the way the GnR story went

[07:28] And it didn't go good for the rest of the year with all the quality issues

[07:31] So will the enthusiasm for Godzilla last there is one issue that's starting to pop up

[07:36] And I hope this doesn't become a serious issue with the game

[07:40] And that is the magnet grab so that magnet that grabs the ball

[07:44] It is overheating and it is turning off and people who have played this game

[07:49] extensively are noticing that so I really hope stern tested this thing

[07:55] And I really hope this doesn't become something that every owner has to now fix somehow

[08:00] So time will tell on this magnet grab mechanism because it's a super cool part of the game

[08:05] And it would suck if it turns off midway through gameplay

[08:08] So hopefully hopefully stern is going to address this but unfortunately once again

[08:14] The most expensive buyers the Ellie owners are most likely not going to get the fix

[08:20] If this thing needs to be fixed and stern is smart they do rush out these Ellie's as fast as they can

[08:27] Even if there are some quality issues they haven't pinpointed yet

[08:31] They do it every time and they're doing it again

[08:34] All right what else is happening with stern pinball

[08:37] So stern insider connect is rolling out

[08:39] And Godzilla is really the first game in which people are connecting their stern insider connect accounts to the game

[08:45] It is very cool. I can't wait to try it

[08:48] Now I'm also very aware that this insider connect program opened the door for trolls

[08:53] To steal people's identities

[08:56] And so someone has already taken canada name

[08:59] They've taken my personal name and they've also made fun of me with the initials

[09:04] Now I spoke to George Gomez himself and he understands that they are going to work this stuff out

[09:10] That they're inundated right now with people signing up

[09:12] But he did tell me they were going to take the canada name back

[09:16] And they were going to make sure that I had the canada name

[09:19] They just need some time to figure everything out

[09:22] So for those of you out there who are going on stern insider connect and just stealing people's pinside profiles

[09:28] And doing this as a joke

[09:29] It is funny it is funny

[09:31] But I hope stern figures this out

[09:33] I do think stern is going to have to understand that when you open it up to the internet like this

[09:37] You're going to have to police it a little bit

[09:40] And as I showed on my Facebook page that I could take the name Gary Stern

[09:44] And have the initials be as ss and that that went through

[09:48] So there has to be some sort of validating that they do that doesn't allow there to be like a million troll accounts

[09:54] In which the trolls can just insult all these people in the pinball community

[09:58] Because I just don't think that's what this is about

[10:00] Okay on an unfortunate note if you're going to pinball expo

[10:04] The stern tour is no longer going to be in person

[10:08] It is now going to be a virtual tour featuring George and Gary

[10:12] So you'll be at expo and they are going to go live to stern virtually

[10:17] Now for many of you out there who are going to expo who bought these passes

[10:21] These were $60 passes

[10:23] A lot of you scheduled your trip to arrive on Thursday for that tour

[10:28] And this is a bummer like nobody wants to do that

[10:31] Because a virtual tour you could just go on YouTube and see a virtual tour of stern

[10:36] Stern could record it right now and just upload it

[10:38] There's no reason to fly to Chicago

[10:41] And be there Thursday if you're not going to physically tour stern

[10:45] If you would like a refund you should email them at info at pinballexpo.com

[10:51] And ask for a partial refund

[10:53] I don't think you're going to get all of your money refunded

[10:55] But some of that $60 was going towards

[10:58] your tour of stern pinball

[11:00] And so I feel bad for some dudes here

[11:02] Their flights are booked and their rooms are booked

[11:04] And now they might not want to come in Thursday

[11:07] But it is what it is

[11:08] And obviously they're doing this for COVID safety reasons

[11:10] So don't beat them up too much

[11:12] They didn't want it to be this way

[11:15] But stern needs to be safe and they need to protect their employees

[11:18] And their employees are working hard on all of these games

[11:21] They've got to make Godzilla

[11:23] The last thing you would want is someone to come in to stern pinball

[11:27] Who's not vaccinated and get everybody there sick

[11:30] And they have to shut down production for two weeks

[11:32] It would cost them millions of dollars

[11:34] And I'm sorry but your presence inside their company is not worth it

[11:38] It's just not

[11:39] So let's keep everybody safe

[11:41] And don't complain and get a refund if you want a refund

[11:44] Now speaking of pinball Expo

[11:46] I am just going to have a very limited number of Canadian merchandise there

[11:50] Just t-shirts and hoodies and that's it

[11:52] If you would like one let me know

[11:55] There's only going to be 30 t-shirts and 10 hoodies

[11:58] So email me at canadapinballatgmail.com

[12:02] If you're going to be at Expo

[12:04] What size you would like

[12:06] And your phone number so I can text you when I'm there

[12:08] I've got your merchandise okay

[12:10] I might have to find a way to drop all this off at one of the booths

[12:13] If you have a table at Expo and you want to help

[12:17] Canada sell his merchandise let me know okay

[12:20] Alright let's go on the Jersey Jack pinball next

[12:22] Not a lot of news over at Jersey Jack pinball

[12:24] But there is a new code update for guns and roses

[12:27] So if you have a guns and roses

[12:29] Code update 1.24 is out

[12:33] The major change in this is it adds

[12:35] Scorebit achievements to your GNR machine

[12:38] So that is cool so download that

[12:40] And you can start to go for those achievements

[12:42] The other thing that's really cool is they added a very awesome new intro to the game

[12:48] Which has this really incredible spotlight effect

[12:51] In which the spotlight is going back and forth

[12:53] It's very well done it's very clever it's not an actual spotlight

[12:57] It looks like it's a spotlight because of the way the lights are lighting up

[13:00] Now someone said that they are ripping off

[13:03] Rick and Morty with this but I just want to say

[13:06] The spotlight effect on Rick and Morty is nowhere near as cool as this

[13:10] Because guns and roses has so many more lights

[13:13] And the effect works way better on GNR than it ever did on Rick and Morty

[13:17] And who cares it's a really cool idea

[13:20] And I love that they implemented it

[13:22] You're probably wondering right now you're saying

[13:23] Canada you started this podcast with like don't be cruel

[13:27] And everything you're saying is nice and normal

[13:29] But here's where I'm going to start to say some things that people might think are a little cruel

[13:33] But I want to explain why I'm saying what I'm saying

[13:36] Let's talk about spooky pinball for a minute

[13:38] So first and foremost for those of you who say that canada does nothing good for pinball

[13:43] Do you think spooky pinball would be fixing the hedge

[13:46] Multi-ball insert if it wasn't for canada drawing attention to this

[13:51] So I am hearing that they are actually going to fix this

[13:54] They are going to change it so that the insert covers the entire word multi-ball

[13:59] So it no longer will say hedge multi-ball

[14:02] Now I applaud spooky pinball for this

[14:05] They could have saved themselves thousands of dollars

[14:08] If they simply had asked canada to look over their machine before they hit go and ordering all the parts

[14:14] They definitely saw this at the factory

[14:16] Because it's not just the hedge multi-ball insert

[14:19] It's also the insert that's on the jackal lantern

[14:22] If you look at it the jackal lantern has a triangle nose

[14:25] And is the insert that lights up triangular?

[14:28] No, it's like a hexagon

[14:30] It seems like they clearly took the ultra-man play field

[14:34] And slapped the Halloween over it

[14:37] Now none of those inserts are messed up on ultra-man

[14:40] It's only Halloween that has the mistakes

[14:43] Which is also a kind of strange decision

[14:46] Because Halloween is the bigger theme

[14:48] It's the one you're going to make more games of

[14:50] Almost three times as many Halloween as ultra-man

[14:54] So sort of strange way to cut a corner

[14:57] That you didn't want to make any changes to the Halloween play fields

[15:00] You wanted to just be able to order

[15:02] 1750 play fields all cut the same way

[15:06] And now look what they have to do

[15:08] They have to go after the runs begun

[15:10] And make a change that's more expensive

[15:13] And they should have caught this from the very beginning

[15:15] And I think everybody agrees with that

[15:18] The next thing I'm going to say is going to be controversial

[15:21] And the reason it's controversial is because

[15:24] For some reason I feel like nobody really

[15:28] Ever is able to speak their mind about how they really feel

[15:32] About new pinball machines

[15:34] Especially new pinball machines from spooky

[15:37] Unfortunately here's what happens

[15:38] Whenever there's a new spooky pinball launch

[15:41] You have the people who buy the games

[15:44] And they will defend these games to no end

[15:46] And they will tell you the games are great

[15:48] Right, you see it

[15:49] The people who ordered these games

[15:51] Who can't cancel their orders

[15:53] They will unanimously defend them

[15:56] And say how incredible they are

[15:58] And then on the other side of the spectrum

[16:00] You have spooky haters

[16:01] Who just say the most ridiculous stuff about the games

[16:05] And they hate on these games so much

[16:07] And they jump into the ring to tell you

[16:09] Like how bad these games are

[16:11] How homebrew they are

[16:12] How unfinished they are

[16:14] And how they're not worth it for the money

[16:15] And that's what happens when a new machine comes out from spooky

[16:18] You've got like one side of the spectrum or the other

[16:22] So it's really hard to cover spooky pinball

[16:24] Because the moment I say something that's not super positive

[16:28] I get attacked by the people who ordered the game

[16:30] And I definitely don't want to be like some hater on spooky pinball

[16:33] Because I actually think spooky pinball

[16:35] Launched this game at the right time

[16:37] They sold every single one

[16:39] Here's the problem

[16:40] This game will always be a successful game for spooky pinball

[16:44] Because they sold through every one

[16:46] So nothing I say matters

[16:47] Every game is sold through

[16:49] Distributors probably have some of them sitting and waiting to sell them

[16:53] But I still want to be able to give spooky pinball

[16:56] Some constructive feedback on these games

[16:59] Here's my feeling right now on both Halloween and Ultraman

[17:04] And I've seen gameplay, I've played it myself

[17:07] Do I think this is a great pinball machine right now?

[17:11] No, I think there's work to be done

[17:13] Do I think the game sucks?

[17:14] No, I do not think the game sucks

[17:16] I think the game has some great flow

[17:19] I think the game has some great potential

[17:21] But here's my one main issue

[17:23] With both Halloween and Ultraman

[17:26] After playing Halloween again

[17:28] And seeing a lot of Ultraman online

[17:31] This is just my feeling

[17:32] Here's my issue with both games right now

[17:34] And my issue comes down to one word and one word only

[17:39] And that word is wow

[17:41] And by wow I mean there's no wow toy

[17:44] There's no wow mechanism

[17:46] There's no wow mode

[17:48] If you're gonna make a pinball machine from the ground up right

[17:51] I think every game needs to be designed around at least

[17:56] Just one one wow thing

[17:59] That physically interacts with the ball

[18:01] Or creates a wow experience

[18:04] Right? It's like the Guns and Roses light show

[18:06] And the concert feeling from that game

[18:08] Is an incredible wow experience

[18:11] And as I look at Spooky's Ultraman and Halloween

[18:15] I'm just trying to find the wow in it

[18:17] And I can't find it

[18:19] I don't get it from the three whack-am-all things happening on the left side

[18:23] I'm not wowed by the upper play field

[18:25] I'm not wowed by the scoop or the in-lane risers

[18:27] I'm not wowed by the light show anymore

[18:29] Because we've had much better light shows in pinball to date

[18:33] And here's the thing

[18:34] The artwork cannot be what the wow is in a pinball machine

[18:39] You don't play the artwork

[18:41] The ball doesn't interact with the artwork

[18:44] So as great as these machines look

[18:47] And they both do look great

[18:49] I just can't find the one thing in it

[18:52] That's a wow

[18:53] And I know this stuff has a lot in it

[18:55] Right? It's got subway systems

[18:57] It's got ball locks

[18:58] It's got this

[18:59] It's got that

[18:59] It's got in-lane risers

[19:01] There's a lot of physical stuff in this game

[19:04] But does any of the physical stuff actually create a wow moment

[19:09] While you're playing the pinball machine

[19:11] And I just don't feel that

[19:14] And maybe I'm being a jerk

[19:15] And am I being too cruel

[19:17] But where is the wow?

[19:19] So now here's the issue for these games

[19:21] When the wow isn't on the physical play field itself

[19:25] And I don't think it is

[19:27] Then you need to rely on the code to create the wow

[19:31] And I'm just not sold that the coding that's happening around these games

[19:36] Is going to create that wow

[19:38] Like it would be different if Lyman Sheets was working on these games

[19:41] And then you would be patient

[19:43] And you'd wait for that wow to arrive

[19:45] So is Canada being a jerk?

[19:47] Am I being unfair?

[19:49] I think these games shoot super smooth

[19:52] I think the upper play fields are really neat

[19:54] I love the artwork

[19:56] The light shows are great

[19:57] The sound is cool

[19:58] But I'm just missing

[20:00] That singular wow thing in this game

[20:04] And I think every single pinball machine

[20:06] I look at every machine this way

[20:08] Here's the thing

[20:08] Every single pinball machine at these prices

[20:11] Needs to have that wow thing

[20:13] And here's how I define it

[20:15] If you were to pull someone over to the machine

[20:17] And say to them

[20:18] I can't wait to show you this

[20:21] Way to you see this happen

[20:23] That is how you introduce a wow moment in pinball

[20:27] Way to you see the theater of magic trunk

[20:30] Way to you see the T-Rex grab the ball

[20:32] Way to you see the upper play field

[20:34] In pirates of the Caribbean

[20:36] Way to you see the light show

[20:37] And the experience of live and let die

[20:39] In guns and roses

[20:41] Way to you see the building

[20:42] In Godzilla go up and down and fall apart

[20:45] Way to you see the castle in medieval madness

[20:48] I just don't think you can build a pinball machine

[20:51] At these prices

[20:52] And not have that wow in the game

[20:55] Am I being a jerk

[20:56] Am I wrong

[20:58] Email me at canada pinball at gmail.com

[21:00] And I want to know what your feelings are on this

[21:03] And I know if you bought a Halloween or Ultraman

[21:06] You're locked into your purchase

[21:08] And that's fine

[21:08] I want to support spooky

[21:10] I'm still in on Ultraman

[21:12] I am

[21:12] But I just get this feeling

[21:14] This overwhelming pressure by these Halloween owners

[21:18] They're just becoming incredible apologists right now

[21:22] And they're just seeing what they want to see

[21:24] And so I am asking all of you Halloween owners right now

[21:28] What is the singular wow thing

[21:30] You see in this pinball machine

[21:32] That brings your love of Halloween to life

[21:35] Besides the artwork

[21:37] Okay

[21:38] Email me at canadapinballatgmail.com

[21:41] And I want to read your answers

[21:43] Okay

[21:43] Not hard

[21:44] What's the wow in theater of magic

[21:46] What's the wow in circus full tear

[21:48] What's the wow in twilight zone

[21:50] What's the wow in Lord of the Rings

[21:51] I would be inundated

[21:53] With people telling me what the wow things were in those games

[21:56] And I'm asking you

[21:57] What's the wow thing in Halloween

[21:59] Or Ultraman

[22:00] Come on all you spooky owners

[22:02] Hit me up

[22:02] All right canada stop

[22:04] What are you doing

[22:05] You're gonna upset everybody

[22:06] You're not gonna win a fifth twippy

[22:08] If you keep speaking this truth

[22:09] All right

[22:10] I got two more companies I want to cover

[22:11] And I want to cover pinball brothers alien

[22:14] And I want to cover haggis pinball

[22:15] Who put out an update

[22:16] And I want to talk about haggis this update

[22:18] Let's talk about pinball brothers alien

[22:20] So real quickly

[22:22] There's a civil war brewing

[22:23] Between highway pinball owners

[22:25] And pinball brother owners of alien

[22:28] Now here's what I think is happening with this whole thing

[22:30] Is that there are many highway owners

[22:32] That worked really hard

[22:33] To fix their games over the years

[22:35] And they've sort of created some of the solutions

[22:37] That pinball brothers

[22:39] Is now implementing

[22:40] Into the new games

[22:42] And I think these highway owners

[22:44] Are feeling under appreciated

[22:46] They're almost feeling like

[22:48] Their game is yesterday's news

[22:50] And nobody wants to take the time anymore

[22:52] To focus on making those games bulletproof

[22:54] And all of it's about the pinball brothers version of alien

[22:58] It's almost like they feel like they deserve more love

[23:00] That if pinball brothers create some solutions

[23:03] They would like to get access to some of those things as well

[23:06] I always feel like they want pinball brothers

[23:08] To make some fixes for the highway games

[23:10] Which is never gonna happen

[23:11] But I also think there's another interesting aspect

[23:14] To all of this that's really under the surface

[23:17] And that is this

[23:19] A lot of collectors bought the highway pinball alien game

[23:23] And they bought the game

[23:24] Feeling like it was never gonna be made again

[23:27] And they really wanted to have a rare collectible

[23:30] They did

[23:31] And they really wanted to have something

[23:32] Where there might only be 200 in the world

[23:35] And now that there's gonna be a thousand LV machines

[23:38] That are built better

[23:40] That have better features

[23:41] That are gonna hold up better

[23:43] They're feeling somewhat upset

[23:45] That their thing is no longer this rare collectible

[23:49] But here's the good news for everyone that doesn't really care that much

[23:52] And I'm part of that camp

[23:53] Like I just don't care

[23:55] Like I didn't think Andrew Highway's game needed to be remade

[23:58] I'm so tired of these companies that fail

[24:01] And people pick up the baton

[24:02] And have to keep pushing these failed projects forward

[24:05] Like at what point are we done with it

[24:07] From what I can see as an outside observer

[24:11] Both of these games

[24:12] Both the pinball brothers version

[24:14] And the highway version

[24:15] Have nothing but issues

[24:17] Every time I open up the thread

[24:19] It's always issues with these games

[24:21] These games were never built well from the beginning

[24:24] And even though they've tried to make them better

[24:26] And they are better

[24:28] They are still games that seem to be a maintenance nightmare

[24:31] And the problem is you get some of these rich collectors

[24:34] Who like never play their highway alien

[24:36] So they like they'll play it 10 times a month

[24:38] And be like my games fine

[24:40] Like nothing ever happened

[24:41] Because you don't play your game

[24:42] You don't play your game

[24:43] But if you want to put a few on your games

[24:45] On a highway pinball alien

[24:46] You're gonna have issues

[24:48] Unless you change like 10 things in the game

[24:50] And even the pinball brothers version

[24:52] Seems to be problematic

[24:54] And again

[24:55] This is what happens

[24:56] It's not super simple to course correct

[24:59] And fix a machine that had a lot of design problems

[25:03] And you don't really have proper testing of these machines

[25:06] Until you have them in people's homes

[25:08] So we'll see we'll see if these LB versions of alien

[25:11] Have better quality

[25:12] But for the most part

[25:14] I mean kind of buy this game if you love the theme

[25:17] But if you don't love working on a pinball machine

[25:20] And lifting the hood frequently

[25:21] I would stay away I really would

[25:23] Oh, canada you are so cruel on this podcast

[25:26] You're telling people not to buy alien

[25:28] Because it's problematic

[25:29] You're pushing spooky to put more wow into their machines

[25:33] You're such a cruel podcaster

[25:35] So let's end this episode of canada

[25:38] Is a cruel podcaster

[25:40] With one final company

[25:42] And I want to talk about a company

[25:44] That on April 26, 2021

[25:48] This company announced that they were going to be making

[25:51] Fathom pinball

[25:52] And when they announced they'd be making

[25:54] Fathom pinball

[25:55] And the order banks opened up April 26

[25:58] They said to people

[25:59] The manufacturing is scheduled to begin on July 1st

[26:03] With the plan to build 50 per month at the new facility

[26:08] Okay, April, May, June, July, August, September, October

[26:14] We are almost at November in two weeks

[26:16] So that is six months have gone by

[26:19] And not a single Fathom pinball machine is on the line

[26:23] And I'm wondering I'm wondering because Damien put up a video

[26:26] I'm wondering at what point do we start to see some red flags

[26:30] And are we seeing the same thing happen all over again

[26:34] And for some reason I cannot understand a very simple principle

[26:38] If you're a successful businessman

[26:41] And you made money doing something in life

[26:43] And you also like pinball

[26:45] I'm just confused by the synaptic leap of men

[26:49] Who make money doing something else in the world

[26:51] Who wake up one day and say they want to get into

[26:55] Not only manufacturing

[26:57] But pinball manufacturing

[26:59] And one of the most difficult things to possibly do on planet earth

[27:03] Is to set up a pinball manufacturing assembly line

[27:06] A machine that has thousands of parts in which all of those parts need to be in one place at one time

[27:12] And it's not just that

[27:13] You've got to deal with designers and artists and line workers

[27:17] And vendors and parts coming from all over the place

[27:20] Why would anyone wake up and think that's a good idea

[27:24] If you wanted to get closer to the hobby you love

[27:26] Maybe start as a distributor

[27:28] Maybe start as a salesperson

[27:30] Maybe get your feet wet in pinball

[27:32] Maybe make some toppers

[27:34] Maybe start small before you jump right in

[27:37] To making a full blown machine

[27:39] With absolutely zero knowledge on manufacturing

[27:42] And it's not just me saying

[27:44] That Damian has zero knowledge in manufacturing

[27:47] Let's listen to what he says

[27:48] I know I didn't come from a manufacturing background

[27:50] But I did come from a corporate professional services type background environment

[27:54] Works with many many times many businesses many companies

[27:58] Okay, so right there is red flag number one

[28:00] That you've worked with many teams and many people

[28:03] And many businesses out in the world

[28:05] So have I in the world of marketing

[28:07] And I'll tell you this 20 years of doing what I've done

[28:10] In the marketing world has given me no greater understanding

[28:14] On how to set up a pinball manufacturing facility

[28:17] And so none of that knowledge is really that transferable

[28:21] Like it is a very very difficult thing

[28:24] To set up something

[28:25] Okay, so that's red flag number one

[28:27] I also would give Damian some advice

[28:29] If our media training him that I probably wouldn't say the following

[28:33] Never never stop learning

[28:34] For all of you that have followed along on this journey with me

[28:37] From the very start you will know the position

[28:39] That I came into this business

[28:40] And into this hobby from

[28:42] And it was one pretty much of zero zero knowledge

[28:44] So okay, so I'm not sure that's going to make you feel super confident

[28:49] Of how he's scaling up his business now

[28:52] If you've been following Damian and Haggis pinball throughout COVID

[28:55] You know that they have a large facility

[28:58] They've hired a bunch of people

[29:00] And when you have zero knowledge of manufacturing

[29:02] And how to do this right

[29:04] Here's the main issue I think they're running into

[29:07] Their ambition

[29:08] And their ability to know what to do might be worlds apart

[29:13] And we're clearly seeing that right

[29:14] Like they announced Fathom in April

[29:17] And said games would ship in July

[29:19] So what were they looking at that made them put that date on the table

[29:23] And you really can't use COVID as the only excuse

[29:26] Because has stern pinball not announced and made and shipped games throughout COVID

[29:31] Has spooky pinball not announced made and shipped games during COVID

[29:36] So COVID was a thing in April when they were announcing these games were going to ship in July

[29:41] Now we've seen this before right

[29:43] It's kind of eerily similar how we've seen this before

[29:47] Where a new to market pinball company gets really ambitious

[29:51] Announces game number two before they finish making game number one

[29:54] Have we seen this before?

[29:56] All the KELTS orders did not go out

[29:58] And not only that they're starting to put expectations about how many games they can make a month

[30:03] Now here's what happens is that because these gentlemen don't really know much about manufacturing

[30:09] And they've never done this before

[30:11] Every single move they make is a learning experience for them

[30:15] Here's the scary part about boutique pinball that's figuring it out as they go

[30:20] When you invest money in them

[30:22] Is your money going to the parts they need to build

[30:25] Fathom or is your money going to them learning how to figure out manufacturing

[30:31] Is your money going to them hiring staff to figure out how to scale this thing up

[30:36] That's the problem because he's put a price on every fathom

[30:40] That needs to take into account labor costs

[30:43] And part cost and keeping this company afloat

[30:46] So if you go six months and the line's not moving

[30:49] And you've hired all these people and you have this big facility

[30:53] You are now entering into a red zone are you not?

[30:56] In which money is going out the door every month

[30:59] But no new money is coming in

[31:01] And no games are getting built and going out the door

[31:04] And you start to make mistakes like clearly they made

[31:07] Listen to what they say about how many employees they scaled up to

[31:11] And how many employees they are at now

[31:13] And again is this not a red flag

[31:16] So the ranks swelled quite a fair bit

[31:18] Initially we were up to about 19 staff members

[31:21] And we were pushing hard pretty much in every area of the business

[31:23] CNC was showing the prep area upstairs on the mes

[31:26] The final assembly wasn't even really in existence at that point

[31:30] But the print room as well upstairs the metal crest

[31:32] You know every area we sort of hit the ground running

[31:35] And the intent was to meet all these fairly tough targets that I had hoped

[31:39] That supported that sort of model and got us moving quickly within the timelines that we needed

[31:44] Unfortunately that didn't quite pan out

[31:48] You know we have needed to restructure ourselves and turn in a little bit

[31:52] And numbers have now resolidified at 10 people

[31:55] Okay so you scale up you have all these people

[31:58] You have 19 people now you have 10

[32:00] So that's a huge reduction in the workforce

[32:04] And so now you have 10 people

[32:06] He goes on to say that they're going to start ramping up again as they get closer to fathom production

[32:11] But again remember this 19 people getting paid

[32:15] Getting a salary every week buying all that expensive machinery

[32:20] Where's the money coming in?

[32:21] They didn't sell enough kels to absorb all that

[32:24] Did they sell enough fathoms to absorb all that?

[32:27] Six months of rent, months of salaries

[32:30] You see how this really starts to become a slippery slope

[32:34] And again the people who do this, these aren't broke people off the street

[32:38] And I don't know how much money Damien is starting with

[32:41] I don't know who his investors are

[32:43] But I know when I hear stuff like this

[32:45] That's clearly poor planning

[32:48] That you go to 19 people and have to let half of your workforce go

[32:53] Okay but there's something even scarier in all of Pimbal

[32:56] It's that when you are transparent and I mean this

[33:00] When you are transparent to the community

[33:03] Sometimes people don't even want to hear the words you're saying

[33:06] They just applaud the fact that you're transparent

[33:09] And I'm here to tell you right now

[33:11] Everyone who listens to Canadian Pimbal podcasts

[33:14] Because you are a transparent jovial person

[33:18] Does not mean you are capable of setting up a Pimbal manufacturing company

[33:24] And I want to play this last clip for you

[33:26] And listen to the very last words they tell us

[33:29] And ask yourself

[33:30] Has Stern Pimbal ever had to say this to you to feel good?

[33:33] Has Jersey Jack?

[33:34] Has Spooky Pimbal?

[33:36] So let me play this

[33:37] You know I hope as well if you've been following along since the very start of this

[33:41] One thing I have always tried to be is transparent and honest

[33:44] You have seen all of the mistakes that I've made

[33:47] You have seen all the things I've had to learn

[33:48] And discover and figure out

[33:50] And you know one thing I hope that you understand when it comes to me

[33:54] And it comes to really the whole team here in Haggis

[33:56] Is that we do not give up

[33:58] All right there you have it

[33:59] Have you ever heard Stern say

[34:00] We're going to get you your Mandalorian people

[34:02] Because we don't give up

[34:04] There is this sense

[34:05] And again I just keep hearing these words of like

[34:07] You invested in Damien and Haggis and the team there

[34:10] Learning how to do all this

[34:12] And look

[34:13] This is boutique Pimbal

[34:14] This is the same story over and over and over again

[34:18] Do I wish that Haggis Pimbal succeeds?

[34:21] Yes, do I hope they figure this all out?

[34:24] Yes, is it a good sign that Celts are on the line

[34:27] And Celts are going out the door

[34:28] Yes, I am not arguing whether or not they can eventually

[34:31] Screw machines together and get them to customers

[34:35] What I am worried about is the long term viability

[34:39] Of a company that is doing it this way

[34:42] Because why would you?

[34:44] Here's where I have the issue

[34:45] Why would you open up order banks on a game

[34:48] When that game was not yet on the line

[34:51] Why are we investing in him figuring out these mistakes

[34:55] That's the part that I want to stick up for

[34:58] Are you consumers because that's what you invested in

[35:01] If you gave money six months ago

[35:03] Your machine is not being built

[35:05] And you have no idea yet where your money went

[35:08] Now I also know that in the world of Pimbal

[35:10] There are some very wealthy men

[35:12] Like the Pimbal brothers spent millions of dollars

[35:15] With Andrew Highway just to figure this stuff out

[35:18] Damien is clearly pumping six, seven figures into this

[35:22] To figure it out

[35:23] My bone to pick is not really with Damien

[35:25] It's more with the community that runs at this stuff

[35:29] Every single time it happens

[35:31] And the community is so susceptible to this

[35:34] All you have to be is transparent

[35:36] Even if your transparency is telling people

[35:40] You really don't know what you're doing

[35:42] This was the first comment on Pinside

[35:45] After this video was posted are you ready for it

[35:48] The first Pinside comment is

[35:50] That is encouraging

[35:52] Great honest update on what's going on

[35:55] Are you kidding me?

[35:57] Are you guys really kidding me?

[35:59] You spent money six months ago on a machine you were expecting in July

[36:03] It's been six months

[36:04] And now you get a video like this

[36:06] And you're encouraged by it

[36:08] That's the problem that I've always noticed in Pimbal

[36:11] Is you have people that just champion these things

[36:14] And want to support this stuff

[36:16] And nobody doesn't want Haggis to succeed

[36:19] But at what point are we done

[36:22] With this pre-order model

[36:24] This is another pre-order model

[36:27] You gave money on a machine that was not ready for manufacturing

[36:32] A company took your money when they were not ready to make your game

[36:35] I don't like this behavior

[36:37] I will never like this behavior

[36:39] And if you're going to do that start small

[36:42] But again 19 employees

[36:45] Let's ask Charlie Emory

[36:46] How many employees Spooky Pimbal had

[36:49] When they made America's most honoured

[36:51] Which sold way more games than KELTS

[36:54] Okay?

[36:55] Why are these guys all of a sudden in a big facility

[36:58] Why are they spending a lot of money on machinery

[37:01] Why are they scaling up when their model right now

[37:04] Hasn't shown them where to scale to

[37:06] They don't know how big this company needs to be

[37:09] But once again it's like a miniature version of Deeproot

[37:12] Where your ambitions

[37:14] They want you to be in that nice building

[37:16] They want you to have all that fancy machinery

[37:18] They want you to have all those employees

[37:20] But here's what you have to do to succeed in business

[37:23] You have to grow slowly

[37:25] You have to earn that big building

[37:27] You have to earn that revenue to buy that equipment

[37:30] Until that day comes

[37:31] Unless you want to personally finance this thing

[37:34] Then fine

[37:35] I guess there's no point in even analysing these companies

[37:37] If everything is personally financed

[37:40] But man you see how easy it is

[37:42] Even when you have millions of dollars

[37:44] It is to fail at Pimbal manufacturing

[37:46] It is the hardest thing to do

[37:48] It is a very difficult thing to do

[37:50] And when you do become a boutique company

[37:52] You have to scale up slowly

[37:54] And you have to make games that people want

[37:57] And if you ask me

[37:58] I think Haggis is scaling up too big

[38:00] With people, with facilities

[38:03] Bringing on Marty

[38:04] They have new designers

[38:05] They're talking about games three, four, five

[38:07] No! Just make one successful game

[38:09] Then make number two

[38:11] It never ceases to amaze me

[38:13] How all of these companies do it wrong

[38:16] It's like they're selling you on their intentions

[38:18] And they're selling you on their ambition

[38:21] But their ability needs to catch up to those ambitions

[38:25] And when your ability can't catch up to your ambitions

[38:28] I don't care how bad you want to dunk a basketball

[38:31] But if you're not tall enough

[38:33] Then maybe you become a three point shooter

[38:35] And if you don't have the ability to manufacture yet

[38:38] Then maybe you don't take money on games

[38:41] That you know you can't manufacture in two months

[38:44] And I think that's a fair way to look at it

[38:46] It's something nobody else will say on any show

[38:48] Because now I'm the bad guy

[38:50] Damien, I still wish you luck

[38:52] I know you're a good guy

[38:53] I want you to succeed

[38:54] But I do need to call this fairly

[38:56] And I need to call it as I see it

[38:58] And no other shows will do this

[38:59] And I'll take the arrows in the back

[39:01] That can aid as a cruel guy

[39:03] But this is why this show is number one

[39:05] This is why we crossed a threshold yesterday

[39:08] 210 Patreon supporters

[39:10] Somewhere out there

[39:11] Somewhere out there

[39:12] All the haters are realizing that

[39:14] They failed that the show just keeps getting better and better

[39:17] And more and more people are hanging out with Canada on Facebook

[39:20] And more and more people are going to be rocking Canada merchandise at Expo

[39:23] I can't wait to see your Viva LaRaza shirts

[39:25] Bring them to Expo

[39:26] But anyway everyone

[39:27] This has been episode 622 of Canada's Pinball Podcast

[39:32] If you agree or disagree

[39:34] Let me know at CanadaPinball at gmail.com

[39:37] And Damien, you are absolutely welcome to the show

[39:40] If you want to come on

[39:41] Let's talk about it

[39:42] Let's have a conversation about this

[39:43] Because again

[39:44] I want to see them succeed

[39:46] But I'm seeing some red flags

[39:47] And my door is always open

[39:49] For anyone to join

[39:50] They know where to find me

[39:51] Everybody can aid out
