[00:00] Welcome to episode 461 of Canatus Pimball Podcasts.

[00:16] Let's continue our analysis of Pimball companies and on this episode it's going to be all

[00:22] about American Pimball, the American Dream Company.

[00:26] Now American Pimball has been around since 2015 and in that five year period American

[00:35] Pimball has managed to put out two and a quarter games and we're going to talk about what

[00:41] that quarter game is and I think you know what it is.

[00:44] But we know when I think about American Pimball and I think about how do I do a show that

[00:49] gives an accurate analysis of this company it's hard because I don't want to just talk

[00:55] about the games and we are going to talk about these games but I think to really understand

[01:01] the games and Houdini and October Fest and to really understand how those games came

[01:08] to be the way they are the way you have experienced them the way this company has marketed itself

[01:14] to really understand what makes this company like tick you really have to go and look

[01:21] at the origins of the company and you have to look at the founders of the company.

[01:26] Now for many of you out there when we think of Jersey Jack Pimball you know Jack Store you

[01:31] know his origins he was a salesman with Gary Stern he was one of Stern's biggest sales

[01:36] men's and distributors of Stern Pimball machines and he went off and he had a dream to start

[01:40] Jersey Jack Pimball.

[01:42] Now if I were to ask you out there how many of you are familiar with the origins of American

[01:48] Pimball how many of you are familiar with the relationship between Amtron or Amtron and

[01:55] American Pimball and it's kind of confusing and so instead of me trying to explain to

[02:01] you everything I thought the easiest thing to do and the most accurate way to think about

[02:07] this company and how it's structured is to actually hear from the man who's running

[02:13] American Pimball right now and I want to play a clip of Mukesh talking about how American

[02:20] Pimball came to be.

[02:21] Now this is about four to five minutes but I really think this is extremely valuable

[02:28] in sort of understanding what American Pimball is and how they themselves see their company

[02:34] and its origins so let's play that right now for you.

[02:38] This is the CEO of the founder of Amtron in American Pimball Mr. Mukesh Fassani.

[02:43] Thank you my dear friends, business friends, Pimball community and our design team who made

[02:52] this miracle you know Amtron design team and American Pimball design team especially

[02:58] we call JenJay Group you know we have five Jacks one two three four five you know

[03:03] and we have a lot of staff members, but we have five jacks.

[03:08] That's why we are winning.

[03:10] Welcome and thank you for your time and support for another amazing milestone for American

[03:20] Finball. We are, we all are excited to see the miracle made by our design team.

[03:33] But one thing while working on the floor, a lot of questions came up.

[03:37] Who is American Finball? What is the relation with Amtran?

[03:41] Who is Amtran? And that was kind of murmuring.

[03:44] So that's what I would like to take you for a couple of seconds for my journey.

[03:49] Born and brought up in a small village of 500 and being an engineer after that came to

[03:56] land opportunity in America in 1994 Christmas Eve.

[04:02] And that's where my journey started. Even though construction business owner in India,

[04:07] I came here and changed 180 degree and I went to Devri and started electronics business in 1996.

[04:15] First decade, our main cliental base was gaming industries, WMS, Williams and a lot of other

[04:22] gaming industries. So we have a passionate and passionate for gaming and amizement since day one.

[04:28] It was a partnership journey in 2007 partner retired and we started Amtran as a newborn company in 19, I'm sorry 2009.

[04:38] In 2009 to 2018, almost nine year journey, we took this company to about $30 to $40 million.

[04:47] And now thanks to Davul, he helped me to raise this company.

[04:52] But now it's time to start our own product line.

[04:56] So Davul came in an idea, let's start Finball. That's why not.

[05:00] Because this is something is giving us a gaming presence, amizement.

[05:06] So that's why we started in October 19, 2015, we started American Finball.

[05:17] It's exactly three years today. So that's why American Finball came in picture.

[05:23] In Amtran Group, we have a five six company but nothing is right now is we are not here to talk about Amtran.

[05:29] I would like to invite and come to visit the facility and you will sell a lot of things over there.

[05:33] But again today, I would like to just give you a glimpse where American Finball came from.

[05:42] And the last but not least, as mayor said, we acquire a big building in a fellow time.

[05:51] So our business model will be couple lines for pinball machine, one or two lines for contract manufacturing only.

[06:00] Because that's our forte and then one line for NPI.

[06:03] So that's why we will have a big fortune in amizement, not only one pinball industry but other radians and game in other couple other areas.

[06:11] We are going to diversify it. Because Amtran itself a diversification.

[06:15] We have a government contract, we have medical areas, we have industrial, we have gaming.

[06:21] So we have all around. So that's why in amizement industry, we're going to make a long path.

[06:27] So we don't get fail or we don't get any other, you know, wind tunnel or something happens in the economy so we can survive.

[06:34] So that's about, you know, Amtran journey and American pinball journey.

[06:38] And I'm going to say thank you to the world to take the lead on this.

[06:42] And thanks to normal, he just joined on this journey.

[06:45] And I'm going to have new millennium, new thought process in pinball industries come in a picture.

[06:51] So again, thank you for time. I don't want to take much time.

[06:54] I would like to again one more time. Thank you to our design team, Joe, Jim, Josh, Jeff and another Joe,

[07:01] all Brian, Barry. There's a Leslie on the back.

[07:06] So there is a lot of, you know, our staff member, they work day and night.

[07:10] So within one year, we got a second strong machine and I rest assured that there will be a quality.

[07:18] Make sure quality is number one for all American pinball machine.

[07:22] Okay, thank you for your time. And we are here to support last, we are in my serious,

[07:29] last long, you know, commitment to support pinball community. Thank you so much.

[07:35] All right. So we have the promise of high quality pinball machines.

[07:39] You start to understand this relationship of Amtran, who has a background in making parts for other gaming companies,

[07:47] but they don't really have experience in making the games themselves.

[07:51] So there's a desire to enter into a category in which they know very little about.

[07:56] And so I think this really to me has always marked and defined what American pinball origins are,

[08:04] which is successful men who are running another business that has another focus,

[08:11] who decided to pivot into pinball. Right. I mean, you hear it.

[08:15] He just said like, Dovel just said one day, let's make pinball.

[08:19] And I don't even get the sense of Dovel really understands what makes a pinball company successful,

[08:26] how to design a pinball machine, what is needed to do what he wanted to do.

[08:32] And you hear this sort of, again, you start to hear this undertone of winning,

[08:36] we're making this miracle product, we've got this winning team in place.

[08:41] Now this is 2018. And when this conversation is happening, we know for a fact that American pinball has not been winning at anything.

[08:51] They haven't had great sales of Houdini and the entire Magic Girl Fiasco,

[08:58] which is what we're going to talk about right now, we can't ignore the past.

[09:02] And I think that's the other thing about American pinball is they would like to probably start over in terms of how they started.

[09:09] So we have to go back before 2018 in this Amtron collaboration and really look at the origins of this company

[09:17] and what their strategy was from the very beginning, because I think it's very important to understand where they started,

[09:24] because I think that is going to ultimately, ultimately define where they are today and where they're going to be in the future.

[09:32] So for those of you who don't know, for those of you who are new to pinball, I'll give you the brief explanation of what happened.

[09:39] John Papaduke, when he invented Magic Girl in Raza and Alice in Wonderland as his sort of premier, premium, expensive, ultra-exclusive titles for Zidware, he went belly up.

[09:51] He went belly up, he ran out of money, he started creating a Ponzi scheme sort of system in which he was selling spots for games two and three years ago.

[10:01] And he needed a sucker, he really did, he needed someone to come in and bail him out.

[10:09] But John Papaduke sort of almost had a way out with Pentasia and Bill Brandis, but they quickly saw that it was an absolute disaster and cut bait immediately.

[10:20] And then all of a sudden, right around 2015, there were rumors that John Papaduke had a new investor,

[10:28] or John Papaduke found someone to help him make the Magic Girls, and there was like this company that people started to speculate called American Pinball.

[10:38] And I remember people looked up the address of this company that was filed and they went to the location and on the door.

[10:46] Do you remember these pictures like on this glass door, there was just a little printout with the logo American Pinball on it, and nobody knew what was going on over the American Pinball.

[10:57] Now we now know what was happening at American Pinball between 2015 and 2016.

[11:05] It was John Papaduke, was at American Pinball, and he was working with Dovel and their marketing person, marketing and salesperson Scott Goldberg.

[11:15] And this was the first time the world ever heard of American Pinball, and the first communication from them really was dominated by Scott.

[11:24] Now what I want to do is go back to that time period, because they finally, in 2016, came out and articulated what their plans were with American Pinball.

[11:36] Now the Pinball community, when they heard that J-Pop was working with American Pinball, the entire community collectively thought it was a horrible idea.

[11:48] Because you have to remember, at this point, John Papaduke was the utter laughing stock of the Pinball world.

[11:54] He had burned so many people, not just buyers of Zidware games.

[11:59] He had burned so many vendors and other individuals who worked for him and gave him products and parts and supplies and time and energy, and he never delivered anything to anybody.

[12:12] Just go ask Zambiyeti, Mr. Jeremy Packer, what it was like working with John Papaduke all those years at Zidware to understand what a sort of manipulating guy John was to get stuff from people and give them nothing in return.

[12:28] He was able to find, and I'm just going to say this, a new sucker in American Pinball to give him more money to try and complete his projects.

[12:39] Then what happens is, John moves his operation into the American Pinball facilities between 2015 and 2016.

[12:50] Now, what I want to do now is I want to play for you, one of the first interviews that American Pinball's Scott Goldberg did when they were talking about why they picked J-Pop and how they actually thought it was a good thing because of what it did for the company.

[13:07] Let me play that clip for you right now.

[13:09] That's where I would say, and honestly, we do acknowledge what happened and know the incredible skills that he brings to the table.

[13:22] And truth be told, you know, as I'm John involved, it certainly puts us in the forefront of the industry right now.

[13:33] And if we were just some random company that was coming out of nowhere saying, hey, we're going to create a pinball machine. It would take a lot longer to get the attention and the awareness if we didn't have this relationship with John.

[13:49] You know, it's unbelievable to me that explanation. You know, you could show up to the party with Mussolini and of course you'd get a lot of attention.

[13:58] But needing John Papaduke to put yourself on the map was a colossal mistake. They basically acquired a toxic figure that nobody liked and they did it.

[14:10] You can hear it strategically to make themselves get awareness and be talked about in the pinball industry and the pinball community.

[14:19] And that's to me, this is super important and you can't just gloss over that decision because to me, that decision to put J-Pop into the company and start the company with J-Pop is an error of judgment by Dovel.

[14:34] And I think that Dovel has been driving this pinball company since day one and I don't think he quite knows right or wrong.

[14:44] And here's why I think that because between 2015 and 2016, John Papaduke was allowed to come into American pinball and keep tinkering away at his magic girl game.

[14:59] And this is all John loves to do. He loves to play the role of pinball wizard, pinball magician. But he really is, and I'm going to say this, he's a little bit of a fraud.

[15:09] And what I mean by that is this. It's not that John doesn't have good ideas. He doesn't know how to execute those ideas. He doesn't know how to make things work on his own.

[15:19] And a lot of these designers who came out of the Bali Williams days, a lot of them are now, you know, in this period of like 2012 to now, a lot of them had so much fame and high praise and so much expectations of what they could do as a designer.

[15:38] But the truth is this is that the Bali Williams engineers made these men great. It's not the other way around. It was all the unknown people that you don't even know about who are the engineers that made these guys ideas come to life.

[15:53] And it's all of them Pat Lawler, John Papaduke, anyone who worked at Bali Williams back in the 90s was made to look better than they then you even think they are.

[16:04] And John is the ultimate testament to that. And so allowed to sit in his own workshop, John Papaduke can't make anything work.

[16:12] And you know, magic girl was a disaster when it was under his own oversight. And here he is at American Pimball. And he's given, this is crazy. So after Zidware fails, John Papaduke is given an additional three to four hundred thousand dollars to make magic girl via American Pimball.

[16:32] And so just to clarify what happened in this time period and for those of you who don't remember in 2016, American Pimball comes out and says we are making a new game. It is called Houdini.

[16:45] And we are working with John Papaduke Jr. to make Houdini and to prove we're serious and to add some goodwill into the Pimball world.

[16:56] We are going to finish the game that John could never finish the white whale of Pimball, the mythological game known as magic girl.

[17:07] And the first piece of content that American Pimball ever showed the world was a row of magic, again it was funny, it was a row of empty magic girl cabinets.

[17:19] And that was the first way they introduced American Pimball to the world. And they promised that they would have those magic girls out and shipped to owners by the end of 2016.

[17:32] And I think this is somewhere around like September or August or September of 2016 in which they started to make these bold promises.

[17:41] Now it's crazy as this. This company has never made a game before. They've never shipped anything before. And even at the very beginning, there's always this weird thing and we see it with so many Pimball companies in which they want to take credit before they've ever even done anything or proven themselves to have done anything.

[18:00] We saw that with Andrew Highway. There's this weird sense of you've already fulfilled your destiny and you're already great in the Pimball world before you even do anything successful.

[18:12] I mean we heard it, we heard it just from Mukesh when he said we're winning. This is a miracle game. He talks in this way about all the excitement and all this and that.

[18:22] And meanwhile in 2018 when he was saying that to us, who Dini was a sales failure. It was a total flop. So how is it that coming out of a sales flop, you're talking in a way that makes it sound like you're succeeding.

[18:41] And it's like this weird, delusional way in which people look at making Pimball machines. I'll never understand. But let me, let me play for you. How Scott and the American Pimball people were, we're sort of already boasting and bragging about how if it wasn't for them, the world would never get magic girl. Let's play that for you right now.

[19:01] If the American Pimball wasn't here, I think it's pretty safe to say magic girl wouldn't be happening now. And because we are a real entity now, we're able to help make those dreams come true.

[19:15] And I think people are starting to realize that that's a pretty substantial accomplishment in itself. If we're able to make that a reality.

[19:25] So a pretty substantial accomplishment. They're making the dreams come true of Zidware buyers and the truth is this. What they accomplished was nothing more than screwing together a broken box of crap.

[19:41] And what blows my mind is that Scott and Dovel that entire year, John is working on this magic girl that they never once walk into the shop and say, hey, John, let us see the game working. Hey, John, is this game functioning? Hey, John, is this game going to fulfill what people are expecting? And no, it didn't. And no, it didn't. And like, can you blame Scott?

[20:07] I mean, they bring on this guy to be the head of a Pimball companies marketing efforts. And what is his background? Does he know how to how to make a Pimball company successful? Well, let's let's hear from him. What his background is.

[20:21] I don't have a typical background, but I have a pretty diverse background in in marketing with start up to entrepreneurial companies in a variety of industries that fit nicely in this.

[20:34] And then we're adding a lot of other tin balls experience make a well-rounded team that's going to show, you know, have all the different areas covered to really kind of grow the company smart and strategic way.

[20:48] So was it smart and strategic to launch this company with Jay pop right now it's impossible. It's impossible for us not to draw the parallels between the origins of American Pimball and that of deep root Pimball because where did John land after American Pimball?

[21:09] He found another another Pimball company to to kick things off with him. And it is unbelievable. Now we are going to see if that bet paid off for Robert Mueller in a couple weeks, but at least Robert has surrounded his company with other individuals.

[21:26] It wasn't just if it was just John and Robert, it would end up the same way as the beginnings of American Pimball. Now, now they came around to their senses.

[21:36] Now for those of you who don't know what happened here, so this is 2016 American Pimball realizes John Papaduke is a whack job that he's never going to get it done that magic girl doesn't work unbelievably they they screw the games together they put him in boxes and they ship him to customers.

[21:56] Now I bought one of them now at this point nobody knew the game didn't work the games didn't make it out by the end of 2016. I think it was February of 2017 the magic girls left American Pimball with a note from American Pimball.

[22:12] It was a very strategically worded note by Scott that said we built these games to the specifications of John Papaduke, which basically means we screwed together his non working piece of crap and it's your problem now, but the game is yours.

[22:29] And I was the first person canada on canada's pinball podcast if you go on YouTube and search canada pinball I was the first person who unboxed a magic girl and showed the entire world what a non working ultra beautiful game it was and what an unsatisfying game it was to play you can't play the game there's nothing in it to play none of the next work it's a piece of crap.

[22:55] And it still amazes me that people are willing to pay 20 to 25 thousand dollars to own a piece of rare pinball history but it's such a tainted history anyway so they come to their senses and in 2016 before they kick John to the curb they start to build another team and that team includes Joe Ballster is brought on now Joe Ballster you have to remember is originally brought on to American pinball to help work with John Papaduke.

[23:25] And that was how the arrangement was supposed to occur originally now what happens very quickly because you know Joe is a normal human being unlike John he realizes John's game is a complete and utter disaster now they still show John Papaduke's who Dini to the world and if you remember they brought it to expo and it had Matt Andrews artwork and it was sexy as could be I mean this is a very interesting game.

[23:55] This game looked incredible I remember they had the game I think at a Vegas trade show and Cornelius that crazy guy in Pinside he drove all the way to go see it and all of us remember we were all willing to almost forget who John Papaduke was because another beautiful sexy J-Pop machine was right in front of us and who Dini I still think the J-Pop who Dini aesthetically blows away the final version of who Dini that the world received from from from Joe Ballster and America.

[24:25] But here's what happens they kick J-Pop out basically Joe Ballster is like you know what he's gone we're going to start over and they announce that they're going to build who Dini in record time they designed a new version of who Dini it's based on John's design if you look at the two games next to each other they are similar layouts but he basically has to start over and remove the J-Pop stuff that doesn't work.

[24:52] So now American pinball is sort of you got a new team in place and it's dovel it's Joe Ballster and it's he announces who's going to code the game and that's Josh Cougler now what I want to do is you know so for me American pinball has been the story of one one simple thing that they this is the team this is the team that has been the core driving force of American pinball machines Joe Ballster Josh Cougler

[25:21] and Dovel and that is their core unit like that's their Gary Stern George Gomez and that's their Lyman sheets right that's their big coder so I've always said it American pinball to me has shown what they can do and like it or not I never understand why people think their games are going to get significantly better unless they either change personnel

[25:50] unless they bring in new talent and unless they try new things now at this point let's play for you the reaction when Joe Ballster introduces Josh Cougler as part of the American pinball team I want you to pay very close attention to what Joe Ballster says at the end of introducing Josh Cougler

[26:14] introduce this Josh Cougler

[26:17] there we go

[26:19] yeah

[26:21] there we go

[26:23] he said that I'm in a rough and program that I pray for

[26:33] you know like I said in the talent that's out there so we're giving it other companies

[26:39] so you have it right there a diamond in the rough that Joe Ballster was praying for because all of the talent in pinball was working at other companies now remember up to this point

[26:52] Josh Cougler had only done his Cougler family pinball machine this isn't someone who had been coding machines now for those of you have played American pinball machines

[27:02] in Josh Cougler's defense I don't think I hear many complaints about the code I think the code and his creative approach to coding pinball machines is actually really good

[27:14] but because the team is so small Josh Cougler was making more than just decisions about code they were also making decisions about art packages and making decisions about the cabinet design and making decisions about how the American pinball package would be

[27:31] and this is where again I think American pinball has always always made some bonehead moves and so it's also a at this point in which Scott Goldberg is ousted from the company

[27:44] now when I say they've made bonehead moves I mean it because when you look at an American pinball cabinet do you think that that cabinet with like the weird shape back box looks good like aesthetically looks good

[27:58] the one thing they had the one thing they should have realized before they kicked Jay pop to the curb they actually had who I believe is the greatest creative I in pinball

[28:11] John Papaduke for all of his faults for all of his terrible terrible business decisions he has the greatest creative I in pinball he knows how to make things beautiful

[28:25] he knows how to work with artists he knows how to get the most out of working with artists and designers and knows how to put it together and assemble it in a way that makes a pinball machine gorgeous

[28:39] when we saw that with his zidware titles we saw it with his magic girl we saw it with Raza we saw it with Alzen Wonderland and when people first saw that Houdini it looked amazing it looked so beautiful on looks alone people would have went in on that title had it worked

[28:59] now they went and they took John Papaduke's aesthetic and they threw it all away and see that to me was one of the biggest bonehead moves of American pinball is they should have they should have had John Papaduke design them a standard size cabinet

[29:15] it never would have looked as frumpy and weird as the AP cabinets currently look and they never should have made the Houdini package turn into this dark steam punky artwork

[29:28] it just doesn't look as good if you put the two next to each other it doesn't look as good and part of the decision making was made by Kugler and Balser I just think that they had people making decisions that had no business making decisions

[29:44] and I can't believe it too because they owned this is what's crazy they own all the beautiful artwork that J-pop had Matt Andrews do for Houdini and they threw it away

[29:55] they threw away the beautiful art package because they wanted nothing to do with anything that resembled John Papaduke but they should have kept the J-pop aesthetic and had Balser make the game

[30:07] so the story of Houdini you know it from there in 2017 this game is made in I think less than a year they went from J-pop's original concept to the Joe Balser version of Houdini

[30:22] now so they make Houdini and Houdini is a game that is rushed it's rushed into production and by that I mean they did not even have a full white wood before they made this game

[30:36] and because of that even though this game is packed with some really cool toys it has one of the coolest toys ever in Pimball that milk can in shot that goes all the way like three feet from the left side all the way

[30:50] the back of the game one of the coolest mechs I've seen in Pimball it it suffers from other shots that are just way too tight way too clunky and ultimately Houdini goes down as a title that even though it's got some cool stuff in it and it's loaded in jam packed for $7500

[31:11] or bucks ultimately people find it unsatisfying to shoot and even though some people out there will try to hype it ultimately the game comes out and it's a sales it's it's mediocre in sales I would say the what I've heard on the streets from distributors is that Houdini has sold between five and 600 units and that is it and I and there are still Houdini's to be had new in box sitting at distributors

[31:40] and they can't move them now because used to Dini's are going for closer to $6000 and so in a way in a way everyone was sort of willing to forgive them for Houdini because Houdini was them again picking up the mess that J-Pop left them but nobody again nobody made them sign up J-Pop it was them and again it goes back to a company that I think at the core does not understand Pimball

[32:09] they the founders of this company have no idea what they're doing in Pimball and they're basically at the mercy of those that do have some knowledge of Pimball to tell them what to do so Joe Ballsor this is like Joe Ballsor's company at this point Joe Ballsor has the ability to create whatever game he wants for them and Joe Ballsor has a responsibility to them much like I railed on Pat Lawler that it was Pat's responsibility to do that

[32:38] that it was Pat's responsibility to give Jack a hit game and he handed Jack dialed in the game that we heard was rumored to be the next title from American Pimball was a game that nobody wanted and even when the rumors of this title started to percolate through Pinside and within the Pimball world there was never any enthusiasm for it anywhere

[33:04] and yet somehow in some way Joe Ballsor decided with other people's money right this this is all like Mukesh's money and Dovel's money he had the ability to make any game he wanted that even like let's just say okay even though it's not a license theme there are many non license themes out there many IPs many historical stories and novels and books and open IP things you can make a game on

[33:32] he decided to make a game that was what he wanted to make and the similarities to this and dialed in are are frighteningly similar that a designer that is allowed to create what he wants and go in a direction that he 100% wants to go in I'm fine with that as long as that person is accountable for the decision they make

[33:57] if you're going to say if we make this it will be successful if we make this we're going to sell this many units then that needs to be on you and you need to be accountable and hold nobody else to blame for this decision now people realize that it was October fest and there was absolutely no enthusiasm for it anywhere I ragged on it on the show even months before they even

[34:27] revealed it officially I said if American pinball makes October fest this company is dead on arrival with that title okay and so you have all these months of people not excited for the theme right months and months

[34:43] and months of people saying no don't make October fest it feels very similar to what's going on now don't make hot wheels how could you land at hot wheels

[34:52] and what this company did and what Joe balsa did I'm going to hold these people accountable I want to just ask Joe balsa what market research did you do to take these people's money and apply it to October fest did you do a survey did you ask people did you put up three or four titles in which you said which one of these would be most exciting to you you didn't do anything you simply

[35:22] listen to your gut and your gut led you a stray and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what you jam pack into a theme that nobody wants American pinball making a game based on a German drinking festival even though that festival takes place in the US it still seems so misguided let's play a clip of when they finally did reveal this game I believe it was September

[35:51] of twenty I want to say eighteen the company finally at at a Vancouver pinball show revealed to the world what the next title was and let's let's play the reaction when October fest was revealed to the world

[36:05] we're calling the game it's after the first big ball I'm 10 I think I believe the first time you see this game shoot this game you're going to I think it's going to be really well received I really got a lot going on so we bumped up who didn't to we know how to build a new deal so now it's time to build something a little bit bigger

[36:34] and hold it better that's saying that we need not good just saying that we need to bump each game if we can and that's kind of our plan so you know as you can see here we got we got ramps going all over the place and I'm not giving you anything to really say oh I can figure out what's going on there but there's shots we've got we've got shots that change in the different shots we have

[37:02] where form ramp that I don't think has never been done out of production in ball before we've got a ramp out there that once you see it you're going to look at it and think I don't know if you could even shoot that you can shoot it so it's it's got a lot of cool stuff going on I think you guys would be happy with once you see it and like I said we're out of fast track to try to get a couple three whatever we can maybe more if we can

[37:32] to have to to to the expo in October so that's what we're planning to do when I fail there so this is September of 2018 October fest is promised to go to expo in October of 2018 and it does it makes it there to the show it's revealed to the world

[37:54] and we're going to talk all about the October fest reveal but the game doesn't ship then it doesn't even ship for six to seven months later okay now also at this point American pinball announces their new sales and marketing guy and it's no other than I think it's moukesh's son and that's normal so we have dovel whose uncle is moukesh and normal who I believe is the son so you have a very family run

[38:24] company in which some of the most major roles and strategic roles are being handled by people within moukesh's family now how qualified is normal to be running marketing for this company

[38:41] and let's let's look at his experience and what his background is to be able to take the reins and drive a pinball company into profitability and success

[38:52] this is normal with sunny he's going to be working marketing the sales side fresh out of school learn a lot about the industry sure is why the people's brains here just get some ideas on how the

[39:07] industry works if he's in that mode so I'll give it over to normal for me to have one of the other cool pictures of not not there all right so fresh out of school absolutely no experience in sales and marketing in the real world and Joe ball sir kicks it to him in front of a crowd of people in which the marketing

[39:26] lead of American pinball is going to say something and get you hyped and by the way if you keep hearing that sound in the background while Joe ball sir's talking about October fest go watch the clip of them at the Vancouver flipping out pinball show

[39:40] and it's so funny because they have a Houdini on stage and they're allowing the machine it's like they played a ball or two and the game's music is just going throughout their

[39:50] presentation and the whole time Joe ball sir is trying to show you clips and do stuff and show you October fest teaser clips he's ruffling through a computer file and folder and it's it's it's don't even get me started on the amateur hour way in which these pinball

[40:07] manual factors communicate to their buyers and their audiences if you can't take the time if you can't take the time the night before you're talking to your customer base and set up a simple PowerPoint presentation that simply guides people through your chat and you're going through folders on your desktop on your computer it is so amateur hour lazy empathetic but anyway I love I love normals response to the crowd when Joe ball sir is going to be in the middle of the world

[40:36] to the crowd when Joe kicks it to him look look let's let's listen to that well unfortunately we're trying to tie that time so I'm sure a lot of you have seen kind of some of the prizes that I've laid out oh man what what a way to just excite the crowd we're at a time I've got some prizes laid out look the bottom line with all of this is this company has been run from the very get go by a family that has a very smart business in Amtron

[41:05] but they know nothing about pinball they know nothing about marketing they know nothing about market research they they hand this company over to children to try and figure it out

[41:19] dovah wants to do the company on a whim they don't know they don't eat pinball they don't sleep pinball they don't breathe pinball and Joe ball sir was given the company to make two games and they both flopped they both flopped there's no way around it and if you were to ask Joe ball sir himself when he was asked how many games of each skew does American pinball need to sell to be successful the volume

[41:48] and someone asked that of him when he was talking about Houdini and let's hear from Joe himself on how many titles they were expecting to sell of each of Houdini and October Fest

[42:01] what kind of volume is are you going to get for each game?

[42:04] well Houdini we released it at a thousand pieces we had confidence in it after the first couple shows that we could get there and we are going to get there

[42:16] I believe I would say not I'm not not written in stone but that we would probably do it a thousand releases per new title

[42:28] well yeah that works out one thing that's nice about again the analysis seeming that I can see we can stop it and we can come back to it

[42:36] so you know we could build up some pipe make it happen get the new game out there and see what we are about bringing back some Houdini's when we get enough orders for that

[42:46] you know our part of business plan is a thousand per unit as an initial release and you kind of got to be in that range to keep your bill of material down

[42:59] you know what I mean once you start going to shorter numbers your bills jumping up here and you know there goes anything we were looking at from that 69 95 price tag is not going to cut it

[43:13] if we get out we don't short releases we won't be able to get that

[43:17] alright so you heard it from Joe himself if they go shorter than a thousand the bomb doesn't work they're not making money they can't sell games at 69 95

[43:28] now if I'm to listen to the distributors that I know Houdini sold around four to five maybe 600 at most

[43:36] but I'm hearing October fest only sold around 300 units so 70% off of the target that it needed to sell now what was to blame for it was it the six month weight between the reveal was it a horrible theme

[43:53] let's deconstruct October fest because this game and we're going to do it quickly because we've done it before on this show

[43:59] October fest failed for a few reasons one it was a theme that nobody wanted irresponsible by Joe to make this theme without any market research he easily could

[44:09] he use the free resource that is in front of him every day

[44:12] pinside is there Facebook is there there are free tools and resources that you can use to determine whether or not your

[44:20] theme is popular you could even start a thread that just says what kinds of original themes would you like to see in

[44:26] pinball did he do that did he ask people what they wanted he did not nobody over there did what did

[44:33] dovel ask of him didn't he not sit him down and say hey Joe if we make October fest is this going to sell is this a

[44:42] theme people want and again I bet they didn't even have that conversation because I think dovel would just go with it

[44:49] remember this is the guy who walked into his own company and gave John pop it up three to four hundred thousand dollars and couldn't

[44:56] even realize that the game doesn't work if he can't realize that magic girl doesn't work how is he going to realize what's a good

[45:03] theme and what's not and so he allows October fest to be made they reveal it in October but you can't have the game in October

[45:11] so immediately a game that's called October fest the earliest you can play it is in spring or summer more

[45:18] on it more on it marketing decision if you're going to make a game called October fest it needs to ship in

[45:25] august september so can actually be physically present at all the October fest celebrations happening in October

[45:33] there's a reason why there's a reason why everything that's Christmas themed starts being sold in November

[45:40] okay so you have it in time more onic decision I don't understand it then you had the whole monkey gate

[45:48] scenario in which they said this was a family friendly game and then they had a monkey on the back glass

[45:54] on the back glass that was grabbing two girls butts and it looked very stupid and insensitive and unnecessary I get it for some of you out there you don't find that offensive I personally don't

[46:07] find it offensive but it is creepy it is unnecessary and it definitely was the wrong time to put something like that on a game when the entire country was going through the whole me

[46:19] to movement and that was the biggest cultural thing happening in society and it looked really dumb and tone deaf the monkey on there could

[46:28] have set some buyers no one cares if it's off okay so they go through that whole debacle by the time the game ships they have to

[46:37] redo the cabinet artwork they have to redo the monkey and the ultimate reason other than theme why this game didn't sell well

[46:45] is not because it wasn't loaded with stuff it's one of the ugliest art packages in pinball you stand over in October fest

[46:55] and it's not attractive it's pretty hideous the art package and we are now in a competitive landscape where if your art package isn't as good as a zombie yeti

[47:07] isn't as good as a Christopher fransche isn't as good as the other high caliber artists that are out there you can't sell your game

[47:17] and October fest needed everything to be beyond good because the theme is bad like you have to win people over and then I didn't even talk about

[47:26] the animations in the game were just horrendous and the animations in who Dini were also horrendous and they finally got better with new code update with October fest

[47:38] but the damage was done and so you have a company that has always given a lot of mechanical stuff into these games with pretty black

[47:47] luster art packages some of the worst animations in pinball and that's why the sales never materialized and here's the sad part about American pinball to this date is they do build some of the best quality

[48:02] pinball machines now who has said it they know how to build stuff like it's crazy to me American pinball knows how to build high quality

[48:12] pinball machines what's let them down is they don't have their George Gomez they don't have anyone leading the company who knows what they're doing and they listened to Joe balsa now it's funny to me because I always hear you know people say to me

[48:27] behind the scenes the murmurs that like Joe's not happy at American pinball Joe's so but I my question is this and if you know Joe or Joe's

[48:37] listening didn't Joe balsa stand over didn't did he not stand over the art package on October fest and how is he satisfied with that art package a

[48:49] man who's been in this industry for two to three decades he knows what a sexy pinball machine looks like so didn't he not have say on which artists would be working on this game

[49:00] how did Josh Kugler stand over that game and think it was satisfactory how to do a man who's seen the kind of beautiful game that John could produce with his

[49:13] who Dini how did he stand over October fest and say yep this is it this is ready to go and that is my entire

[49:21] belief of this company is I get that they make pinball machines I get that they build quality machines I get that they don't rip people off you've never lost your money on an American

[49:32] pinball game but the people inside the core team have shown time and time again they just don't know what you want as a pinball buyer they don't know how to make a

[49:45] beautiful game they don't know what the need state is of the pinball community they have absolutely no clue and to me it feels like a

[49:55] company that is funded by a different company and guess what that's exactly what it is individuals who are really good at

[50:04] making other stuff that are dabbling in pinball and it feels like it and the sales reflected it is crazy to me in a hobby like

[50:14] this in a world that is starving to buy any pinball machine that is new and available and fully featured that they couldn't figure it out they had

[50:26] two chances and what's what's really frustrating is Joe bosser knows better so who's to blame like it doesn't matter what he's going to say is the

[50:36] problem he got to make his game and as far as I'm concerned when you're a creative director and you get to execute your idea you are held accountable so now we move into hot wheels now hot

[50:48] wheels is happening hot wheels is happening but I am telling you right now I'm telling you right now ap's hot wheels is going to most likely

[50:59] disappoint and I'll explain why because the first two games and their failure to launch has done one thing it has forced this company to now re-evaluate how much money they can put into these games

[51:15] because the first two games have lost them a lot of money so what I think they're going to do now and I don't know this for sure but this is my prediction that is going to

[51:25] underwhelming my prediction is that they think because they got hot wheels that they have a hot property and because they got hot wheels they were probably sold all of the reasons why hot wheels is popular by the

[51:39] tell team over at hot wheels and I know this because I work on hot wheels they were probably sold on the fact that they've made eight billion hot wheels cars that hot wheels has a huge collector base that hot wheels has arcade and video games that are in

[51:53] the same place that hot wheels is still a contemporary and popular entity and it is it's just not popular in the pinball world and it's probably not popular within the people who buy

[52:07] machines now and where it's really not popular is amongst the competitive set of available pinball games because it's not about making this game in a vacuum it's is hot wheels going to actually sell well against stranger things against star wars against Batman against medieval madness against this against that against

[52:33] Morty it has to be a theme that will appeal now again I ask you this question in all of the threads on pinside of themes people would like to see I had never seen anyone in a million years and I've been I'm saying that hyperbole I've never seen anyone in any of those threads say hot wheels so then it begs the question who

[52:59] made this decision and this is why a company like American pinball will just always always fail to make a hit game because I just think the people running the ship have no idea what they're doing

[53:17] and they were probably at a trade show and Mattel was probably there with a big hot wheels booth and they probably got excited by the property and they they decided to make a game now I'm going to tell you right now if hot wheels were a popular theme that would sell you a thousand plus pinball machines if hot wheels were a theme that pinball buyers wanted it would have been made already by

[53:47] Stern pinball this isn't a theme that is going to excite this community and you know it and you know it now there are some of you out there that are saying well Chris wait to we see it let's see what it is and we're going to see it in just a few weeks and I think when they

[54:06] pull the curtain off of hot wheels I think you're going to see a game that is not going to have nearly as much in it as Houdini and as October fest and I think you're going to see probably some orange ramps and what not and I think you're going to have a colorful hot wheels art package

[54:24] but I also think next to what's coming out and next to the games that are launching guns and roses ninja turtle stranger things you have deep roots coming into the picture you have a Chicago gaming company with original games Rick and Morty games are going to be available for people people will flip the Rick and Morty's I just don't think within the competitive set this is the answer and it's another example of a company that just didn't do the homework

[54:54] they didn't work hard to get to a big factory it was given to them me think about that for a minute spooky pinball started small and worked hard to make their pinball company American pinball company was born out of the success of another company

[55:11] dovel didn't earn he didn't earn a pinball company he didn't earn pinball buyers he didn't earn the right to have a huge factory he didn't earn the right to have all the money that he's building his games with it was given to him by the successes of another company a family company albeit which is fine

[55:32] which makes it even more frustrating if you look at it that way you have the money you have the ability to go higher the right people you have the ability to go get the right talent you have the capital to get a license property if a small company like spooky can do it why can't you Charlie doesn't have an uncle with $60 million or a $50 million company feeding him money he did it himself to me that's the American pinball company

[56:02] and dream now aim tron is the realization of the American dream but American pinball is anything but that American pinball is a byproduct of what happens when you give you know your spoiled son who's on Facebook you know showing his super expensive computer you giving people these roles in the company that they didn't earn they were just given those roles and it's playing out that way

[56:31] it is absolutely playing out that way and you know that's that's the story in my book of American pinball a ship without a captain a lot of money and what won't happen is this American pinball won't go away because they have all that other capital coming from aim tron now

[56:52] I'm always not doom and gloom but I do think that hot wheels is a title caught in the middle of this company's transition and I think hot wheels will fall victim to a company in transition

[57:08] there's new there's a new sales and marketing guy and Michael grant that just joined this week or week yet they just announced that they've had other people leave the company

[57:18] and so they are transitioning their own team now the whole thing is this this company needs a leader I don't think it has it I don't think marketing and sales guys could help they need a leader that understands pinball and until they establish who that person is it is always going to be this cluster of one step forward in this area two steps back in that I think you're going to see one step forward in terms of theme hot wheels is still better than that

[57:47] hot wheels is still better theme than the first two games but then two steps back in terms of the mechanical ingenuity and complexity of the game and we will see maybe can it is going to be wrong maybe I'm going to eat my own words on American pinball but that is the story of American pinball they did not earn the big factory they didn't grow because of sales they actually their sales have declined right

[58:16] they have yet to sell spooky pinball in four hours people spooky pinball in four hours sold more games almost more games in four hours than American pinball has sold in five years so when you think about it like that that's the problem and Chuck and bug and Ben heck pinball guys pinball guys made spooky pinball guys make stern pinball tick pinball guys

[58:45] pinball guys made up CGC pinball guys are over at deep route pinball guys did not start American pinball and they've never been able to put the right kind of pinball leadership in place but I think they're going to try and do that but it's not going to be felt on this next title I might be right I might be wrong we will see very soon enough everybody have a great day we'll talk to you soon we'll come back with an analysis of another pinball

[59:15] company on our next show later
