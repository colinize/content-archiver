[05:45] John's not really the guy to get you excited, is he? I mean, damn, that was John.

[05:51] Yeah, not really, not really feeling the energy, Johnny, I'm not feeling the hype,

[06:00] Star Wars! I want to go home, mommy. I don't want to do 1137 podcasts about pinball.

[06:15] Let's see, my first reaction to Star Wars.

[06:31] I feel like they didn't show much. The clips, it's all in there, I'm sure,

[06:38] but I feel like the licensing, they didn't have the theme song, there's a weird version of it,

[06:44] there wasn't really a moment. What I saw under the glass, the ad ad falling down is fine,

[06:51] it's tiny, it's too small, it's too small, I like the way it falls, it falls the way it does in the

[06:56] movie, but it also makes no sense, why aren't you going around its legs? It should have been bigger,

[07:02] and it should have been an orbit shot around the legs to make it fall. Why is it looping around

[07:07] above it? Why is it looping around above it, Johnny? Johnny, you got to get the legs tied up,

[07:14] not the head, I don't get the common sense, it's not even going, it can need to be bigger,

[07:22] it's like Stonehenge from Spinal Tap, it's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

[07:28] wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know, I, I, I don't know.

[07:35] And the Vader and the Storm Trooper heads look like shooter-rod handles just dropped in,

[07:44] just a head, headless, not a headless body-less, scared,

[07:51] there's another teaser? Where is the other teaser? I put the link to it here,

[07:57] I don't watch the other one.

[08:04] All right. Put the link here. It's on Nams arcade home.

[08:13] I don't know. Like gang. It just doesn't look like $13,000 game.

[08:20] I just I don't know what I.

[08:23] Harry Potter man. Much more impressive looking. I just the blue man on the LED.

[08:31] It's Star Wars.

[08:35] Let's see. Official game trailer. Is this doing?

[08:42] This one.

[08:47] That song is weird. It's like not the song you want.

[08:51] Yeah, let's watch this one.

[08:55] Then I got to go. I got to get Brenda the car.

[09:01] Let's see.

[09:06] We need your help to defeat the Empire.

[09:21] We saved.

[09:51] All right.

[10:02] I don't know.

[10:14] I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know. I'm a Star Wars. It seems okay.

[10:20] It doesn't seem. It doesn't seem spectacular.

[10:24] The play field art doesn't seem great. It seems very.

[10:31] It seems too cheap looking. I'm just going to say it just seems too cheap for.

[10:39] I don't know what they're charging again. I think at 8500 that we look at it differently.

[10:46] I just after Harry Potter and how beautiful that game looks.

[10:51] What spooky is putting in the evil dead. I think these stern machines are looking like.

[10:57] They're not looking expensive enough for the amount of money they're charging.

[11:03] I think this game is going to. I just don't feel like the Ellie is like, wow, it's not wow.

[11:12] I don't like the Ellie art to be honest. The blue with the.

[11:16] It just. It just feels. I get what they were going for.

[11:21] It's got that kind of like Kenner toys 1980s vibe going on with it.

[11:27] It just doesn't. It just doesn't blow me away.

[11:36] I it just feels like once you start putting just heads.

[11:43] And the scales wrong. You know, like I don't like scale being all over the place.

[11:48] I don't know.

[11:55] I just didn't see my there's anything magical happening the ball saves cool.

[11:58] But also with the ball save it. I think it's kind of like why did they put a ball on the art.

[12:05] You know what I'm saying? It's like that's kind of.

[12:09] Slam like why didn't they just leave that you know what why not have you to like like like I don't like having a.

[12:16] It looks like a picture of a pinball where the ball save is happening.

[12:25] What's this gameplay.

[12:31] I don't know.

[12:36] Is there like is there other pictures anywhere.

[12:42] Is there any other pictures on the inside yet.

[12:50] Let me see.

[12:56] I'm looking at the art now.

[12:59] The art is pretty pretty pretty bad gang.

[13:05] I like.

[13:08] I like job a trap in the ball with his tail.

[13:13] What's this? I'm just a 27 minute.

[13:28] There we go. Let's do this real quick.

[13:30] Then I get it run.

[13:39] This is gameplay.

[13:42] This will give him a better sense of.

[13:55] I'm not going to be a speaker panel.

[13:58] So again, here any audio clipping.

[14:01] It is what it is. I wasn't able to use their new HD.

[14:04] Without further ado, let's get to the gameplay.

[14:07] Jackpot!

[14:26] You got Jackpot! Super Jackpot can let it come wonderful.

[14:36] I can't look anymore.

[14:40] Look is lit.

[14:53] Super's your job completed.

[15:06] Hope momentary arrangementsUNT

[15:19] Good my vote, The Hot Fear toilet bomb.

[15:29] ATTO SAME

[15:36] I'm done!

[15:40] He's got a problem with his own path, no one can choose it for him.

[15:43] Not you?

[15:44] You take good care of most of them now, understand?

[15:48] Well, do take good care of yourself.

[16:07] Oh, he's got a problem.

[16:14] Did you steal your junior?

[16:18] I'm seeing that.

[16:20] I've seen enough.

[16:22] Okay.

[16:23] I don't wait.

[16:26] Like the text is cut off.

[16:27] It should be full screen when it's scrolling.

[16:30] I'm, um,

[16:32] um,

[16:34] man.

[16:39] Um,

[16:43] I need to, I need to, I need to, I need to run gang.

[16:46] I'm going to watch some more gameplay.

[16:49] I'm going to do a show today when I get home.

[16:53] I'm just going to say first live reaction of Star Wars is exactly the commentary I've been hearing.

[16:58] Is that it's, it looks okay.

[17:00] It doesn't look like it's mind blowing.

[17:02] And it looks like there's a lot going on.

[17:04] I know it's turned, the way it's turned just does the assets.

[17:07] Lots happening.

[17:08] Movie scrolls happening.

[17:10] I don't, I don't, I think there's a lot to be still put in the game.

[17:14] I bet they're still waiting on approval of like getting sign off on all the actors.

[17:18] But, um,

[17:21] I just,

[17:22] I'm just not blown away.

[17:24] I'm just going to say,

[17:26] I'm just not blown away.

[17:28] I'm just, I got to be kind of, I don't feel like I'm like, oh, yeah.

[17:31] Give me my L.E.

[17:33] Um, not feeling that, not feeling that yet.

[17:35] But I'm going to go in the car.

[17:37] I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to call some pimped heads as I drive back to Connecticut.

[17:41] But, um,

[17:43] yeah, first reaction to Star Wars is this.

[17:46] The right, the famous retro Ralph,

[17:48] ever see his videos, he was like,

[17:51] if the Star Wars live up to the hype,

[17:54] that's how I feel later, everybody.

[17:57] Oh.

[17:59] Go!
