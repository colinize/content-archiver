[00:00] You shoot me down, but I'm on fire, I am vitamin E.

[00:30] We got Busta386, Sean Spear, Dan F.

[00:36] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:38] Let's do this.

[00:39] Let's go around the pinball horn on this episode because a lot is about to happen in the pinball space.

[00:44] Can you feel it?

[00:46] Those Beetlejuice games are just lining up waiting for those populated playfields to go inside.

[00:54] We are going to see Beetlejuice machines going out the door in January.

[00:59] This is just a couple of weeks away.

[01:01] We are going to get that stern pinball the next game.

[01:05] Is it Pokemon?

[01:06] Is it Transformers?

[01:08] It's Pokemon.

[01:09] We're going to see that most likely January 6th, which is the beginning of CES over there

[01:15] in Vegas.

[01:17] We've got Winchester Mystery House.

[01:19] I give you guys credit who have a Winchester Mystery House spot because none of you are

[01:25] selling it for a profit.

[01:28] We're going to talk about that.

[01:30] We're going to talk about Dune.

[01:31] You've got two weeks to order your dunes.

[01:34] We've got stuff happening over at American Pinball.

[01:37] Apparently people are going over to the factory and they're excited about their next pinball

[01:42] build, which by the way might arrive at TPF in March.

[01:47] Do you believe that?

[01:48] I don't.

[01:49] Who's designing it?

[01:50] Are they really going to get a game out in the world in March?

[01:53] I don't know.

[01:54] We'll talk about that.

[01:55] Let's just go around the pinball horn.

[01:57] I think a lot of people out there are starting to realize a lot of really great pinball is

[02:02] out there.

[02:03] I've seen some stuff recently with my own eyes and I can say this without any hesitation.

[02:09] 2026 is going to be one of the most amazing years for pinball ever.

[02:15] I think it's going to get bookended by some mega moments.

[02:20] And I think everything in between is just going to be the gravy.

[02:24] We're going to get Beetlejuice, Winchester, the new Stern, maybe the biggest IP ever,

[02:30] Pokemon.

[02:31] And then we're going to get Sonic the Hedgehog, middle of the year.

[02:35] Then we're going to get Back to the Future and Goonies at the end of the year.

[02:39] And also the next game from Keith Elwyn.

[02:41] Is it going to be Fallout?

[02:43] Is it not?

[02:44] It doesn't really matter, right?

[02:45] It's a new Keith Elwyn game.

[02:46] A lot of exciting stuff happening in pinball.

[02:49] Now if I were to give an overall assessment of where the hobby is at, you really have

[02:54] to knock it out of the park.

[02:56] And this is why it's such a fun time to be in pinball.

[02:59] And for those of you who are new to the hobby, welcome to pinball.

[03:02] The prices are through the roof.

[03:04] But the good news is this.

[03:05] I know and I've been speaking to everybody at every company.

[03:10] Everybody is really doing their best to put as much as they can into these games.

[03:16] It's getting to a point now where a lot of us are at a room and if you're going to bring

[03:21] a new game into your collection, it really has to be worth it.

[03:25] I see people debating every single day, what's going to go?

[03:28] Some of you, it's five pins.

[03:30] Some of you, it's 10.

[03:31] Some of you, it's one like Canada.

[03:33] If I'm going to move that guns and roses out, something really awesome has to move in.

[03:39] Is it going to be Beetlejuice?

[03:41] Is it going to be Sonic?

[03:43] How do I get that thing down the stairs?

[03:44] Let's go around the horn.

[03:46] Let's start with Stern Pinball.

[03:48] So obviously, Pokemon is just a couple of weeks away.

[03:51] Now I have some news.

[03:52] I don't think anyone else here has heard.

[03:55] One of the biggest orders for Pokemon is not going to be the distributors you and I know.

[04:01] I am hearing that Costco put in an order for 3000 Pokemon games.

[04:09] So they're going to make a sort of home edition of this game, a la what they did with Star

[04:14] Wars and Costco is a humongous order.

[04:18] It does beg the question.

[04:21] Even if you can bring all those games to Costco, should you?

[04:25] Because right now Stern is sort of suffering a little bit from the perception issue that

[04:30] they're cheap, that they're not worth the money, that all these like spike three changes

[04:35] are cutting corners.

[04:37] They're not real enhancements.

[04:39] And so showing up at Costco with something that's like 5000 or 5500 bucks, how much sense

[04:46] does that make?

[04:47] Is that going to get new people into the hobby?

[04:50] I do know this.

[04:52] It is really, really hard for all of these pinball companies to really measure how many new people

[04:59] are we bringing into the hobby with each one of these moves?

[05:04] Are these Costco games a gateway pin or a gateway drug to get these people hooked on

[05:10] pinball and then buying more of our like everyday product?

[05:15] So I am hearing that Pokemon is not like spectacular.

[05:20] I'm hearing that it is going to be another underwhelming game a la Star Wars.

[05:26] So I don't know, right?

[05:27] Because George Gomez is on this and he's finishing what Jack Danger started.

[05:34] It's a strange combination in my honest opinion.

[05:37] I don't think George Gomez is a Pokemon fan.

[05:41] I know Jack Danger is, but he clearly was fed up, if you will, with what is now seemingly

[05:48] becoming the, I don't know, it's not even like a secret anymore.

[05:53] That stern pinball over there culturally has become a bit of a toxic work environment.

[06:00] And you can kind of feel it.

[06:01] You can kind of sense it.

[06:03] And I think if I'm looking at stern right now, I think that is the number one issue they

[06:08] are facing right now.

[06:10] I know on good information that a lot of people are looking to leave.

[06:15] I know on good information that people have left and recently gone over and down the street

[06:21] to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[06:23] And so it's hard for these designers though, because there are not a lot of homerooms for

[06:29] these designers.

[06:30] I think John Borg might have waited way too long to land over at JJP.

[06:35] I also don't think JJP wants John Borg.

[06:39] Do they want Jack Danger?

[06:40] I think it's hard.

[06:41] I think a lot of these guys have a lot of personality and they have a lot of reputation

[06:47] that goes along with them.

[06:49] And so if you're Jersey Jack and you're going to get to a point now where you're making

[06:53] two games a year, they're going to make Potter, they're going to make Sonic the Hedgehog.

[06:58] They've got Mark Sidon, they've got Eric Minier, and they've got Steve Ritchie.

[07:02] They really don't need another designer.

[07:04] But let's go back to stern.

[07:05] So we've got Pokemon coming out most likely January 6th.

[07:11] If this game is not ahead, what does that mean?

[07:15] How quickly will they rush out transformers?

[07:17] Now I don't think they're going to rush it out quickly at all.

[07:19] I think the big issue they're facing right now is that the Walking Dead, I don't think

[07:24] they ever expected the Walking Dead to do so poorly.

[07:28] They probably were anticipating.

[07:30] They would somewhat consistently sell this Walking Dead remastered throughout the end

[07:35] of the year and into the next year.

[07:38] The orders are not there.

[07:40] The game is already plummeting in price.

[07:43] And so I think most of you out there are not really into Pokemon.

[07:47] And so I think we're going to see another really soft beginning of the year to stern

[07:52] pinball and then it's going to become Elliot Eisman's Transformers.

[07:57] Now I'm hearing very good things about transformers.

[08:00] Can't wait to see it, but they better have Stan Bush's You Got the Touch in this game

[08:06] and they better get the voice of Optimus Prime into this game and they better do it justice.

[08:14] I am hearing that they are putting a lot into this game and look, Stern just needs something,

[08:19] right?

[08:20] They just need something that makes everybody universally look at it and say, that is awesome.

[08:27] If I were to give them some advice, I think they need to get more into these games.

[08:33] I think the toppers need the launch on the LE.

[08:37] I think they need to figure out how to make the decals look even better.

[08:42] I've seen some stuff coming people and I'm going to tell you right now, the problem with

[08:46] Stern is they're looking really cheap next to stuff from JJP and from Spooky and from

[08:53] Barrels and those three companies are going to keep making their platforms look even better.

[09:00] If Stern just wants to keep doing the same thing, they're going to have less and less

[09:04] excitement and enthusiasm.

[09:07] Let's go next to Jersey Jack Pinball, the second largest pinball company in the world.

[09:14] Harry Potter's are doing phenomenally well.

[09:17] I think they've made about 1800 CEs.

[09:20] I think there's another 1200 or so to be made.

[09:24] 3000 CE orders they got roughly.

[09:28] They've sold more CEs than arcade editions.

[09:31] It almost begs the question, do they need three tiers with this platform?

[09:37] But look, in the end, this has been a super successful game for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[09:43] You don't hear me talk about it that often because there's nothing really to say other

[09:47] than people are really enjoying it.

[09:49] I think a lot of people consider it to be one of the best pinball machines in a very

[09:54] long time.

[09:55] I've been saying it for a while.

[09:57] I think a lot of new pinball collectors, even the old pinball collectors, collecting pinball

[10:02] and just owning machines for years.

[10:05] I think there's going to be new titles that sort of become the standard foundation for

[10:10] what you build a collection around.

[10:13] I think Harry Potter is going to be that.

[10:15] I think games like Beetlejuice are going to be that.

[10:18] Oh, and I almost forgot.

[10:19] I got to go back.

[10:20] Rewind with Canada right now.

[10:21] Jaws 50th.

[10:23] Jaws is now the number one game in the world.

[10:27] They just released the accessory package to Jaws 50th.

[10:30] I think it looks good.

[10:32] Initially, I didn't like all the red.

[10:34] Now I love it.

[10:35] I think Jaws 50th is ending up the game where if you're going to go in on something, I think

[10:41] it is the number one game at Stern Pinball this year that gave everybody the best value.

[10:48] And shaping up to be one of the best Stern machines of all time.

[10:54] Now that's incredible.

[10:55] They really got past the whole shark doesn't eat the ball thing.

[10:59] And I think where this game just wins, if you love Jaws, it connects with you on such

[11:05] an amazing level.

[11:07] I think we're going to see the same thing with Beetlejuice.

[11:09] We're seeing it right now with Harry Potter.

[11:12] There's just a lot of smiles to go around.

[11:14] It's good, right?

[11:15] This is what we want.

[11:17] We don't want games that can only sell during a very short window.

[11:23] What we want are games that sell really well at the beginning, but they're also just really

[11:29] good games that people want to hold on to for a long time.

[11:34] And I think Potter is one of those games.

[11:37] I do think Beetlejuice is going to be one of those games.

[11:41] So Jersey Jack, we are looking at most likely Sonic the Hedgehog sometime in June, July.

[11:48] So middle of the year, this company will have two legitimate games on the line.

[11:54] And they're going to be running Harry Potter's all the way up until the end of the year.

[11:58] Then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's Sonic the Hedgehog.

[12:02] And then after Steve Ritchie, we will see the next game from Mr. Mark Sidon.

[12:07] I don't know what Mark's game is.

[12:10] I don't think it's a music pin.

[12:13] I think it's going to be another movie related IP, which is good.

[12:18] I think the pinball world in general is a little over music pins.

[12:23] And if we do get another music pin, just make it different.

[12:28] Michael Jackson, maybe Eminem, you know, something different.

[12:32] We don't need more dad rock music.

[12:35] So Jersey Jack is going to have a really great 2026.

[12:40] And I will say this, talking to the people over there and getting to know them better

[12:45] and listening from people who are over there.

[12:48] This is another company where the culture is really in a great place.

[12:54] And it's not a company that's cutting corners.

[12:57] It's not a company that is like removing things from the games or rushing people to get their

[13:02] stuff out.

[13:04] I think the culture at JJP is going to be felt in the future products of this organization.

[13:10] I also got an exciting rumor about something that is going to launch with Sonic the Hedgehog.

[13:17] They are finally after all of these years, I think they're going to finally connect all

[13:22] of their games with their version of connected pinball.

[13:27] It's not going to be called inside or connected.

[13:29] But what makes me really excited about the Jersey Jack connection, because this company

[13:35] has the camera, you're going to be able to see the person you're playing.

[13:41] And that is amazing.

[13:43] You're going to be able to look at your friend who also has the machine you have, and you're

[13:47] going to be connected via the video and via the camera.

[13:51] And that all of a sudden gets me so excited, way more excited than just getting lame badges

[13:58] like inside or connected.

[14:00] They're really going to be heads and shoulders above everybody else if they can connect the

[14:05] games that way.

[14:07] So look for that to come sometime in middle of 2026.

[14:11] And again, it just goes to show you these companies that are innovating that are bringing

[14:15] things into the market that haven't been done before are going to be the companies that

[14:21] people want to support.

[14:22] All right, let's go now to spooky pinball.

[14:26] As you know, Beetlejuice machines are on the line.

[14:30] They're making four games at once.

[14:32] Four games at once.

[14:33] I'm looking at you, David Vaness.

[14:35] You said you're going to do two.

[14:37] Spooky's doing four.

[14:38] What are they making?

[14:39] Like Scooby-Doo's and Evil Dead's and Beetlejuice's.

[14:43] And I don't know what else is still left to be made.

[14:46] I don't even know.

[14:47] But January is going to be an exciting period for spooky.

[14:51] We're going to start to see these Beetlejuice machines go out to customers.

[14:55] It's going to be amazing.

[14:56] Everybody by now should have their number of what game you are, which is good because

[15:02] then you can kind of map out your year.

[15:04] You're going to be able to know sort of within a ballpark of a few weeks when you're going

[15:09] to need to pay and fall for your game.

[15:12] It's fun.

[15:12] I mean, it's great.

[15:13] Like I love being 999.

[15:15] I'm at the end of the year.

[15:16] By the time I have to give them my money, I will already be giving my deposit on the

[15:22] Goonies and I'm just going to keep it going.

[15:24] And look, I'm going to try to find space for these games, but I'm just holding on to them

[15:28] because I will eventually, whether it's in this house or open up a pinball bar, these

[15:34] games are going to go somewhere where I will be able to unbox and enjoy them.

[15:38] So don't worry about me.

[15:40] I'm going to take possession of Beetlejuice 999.

[15:44] I think spooky is just going to have a great year building all these machines.

[15:48] And I need to open up.

[15:50] I got a holiday gift from the folks over at spooky.

[15:53] I have not opened it up yet.

[15:55] I'm going to do a live unboxing of it sometime this week.

[15:58] Maybe I'll do it tomorrow on Christmas Eve.

[16:00] We'll invite everybody on Facebook, on YouTube, on Patreon.

[16:04] I wonder if I can go live on all three at once.

[16:07] I've never tried that.

[16:08] So great year for spooky pinball.

[16:10] I think they've got the mojo.

[16:11] I think they've got the magic.

[16:13] I think they've got the good vibes.

[16:15] And again, I think their culture right now is seemingly the greatest company culture

[16:22] in all of pinball.

[16:23] And they've done it right.

[16:25] And they've grown from a tiny little company to a company that's now making

[16:29] a thousand games a year and everybody is very happy with them.

[16:34] And I think they also understand there's a point where you just don't want to

[16:38] grow too big because if you grow too big, too much pressure puts pressure on your

[16:42] culture to figure it out.

[16:44] And I feel like when you look at Stern, they really do look like a company

[16:48] that's panicking because all the private equity money they took has put them

[16:52] under the microscope and it just feels like they're staring down the barrel of

[16:56] this gun and they don't know how to get out of it.

[16:59] I really think Stern has no way out.

[17:01] I'm just going to guess, but I think in just a couple of years, Stern pinball

[17:05] is in big, big trouble.

[17:08] I mean, imagine if they lost Keith Elwin.

[17:09] If Keith Elwin just went somewhere else, imagine how much trouble

[17:13] Stern pinball would be in.

[17:14] That's how vulnerable they are.

[17:16] All right.

[17:16] So after spooky pinball, let's go over to barrels of fun.

[17:20] So barrels of fun has their FOMO for Dune pinball.

[17:24] There's eight more days to order your Dune or it is likely your last chance

[17:29] you'll ever get to order it.

[17:30] We'll see how that goes.

[17:32] I don't know.

[17:32] I don't think they're going to get like hundreds of orders.

[17:34] I don't see tons of people on the pin side thread saying, Hey, I just ordered

[17:39] it because of this new sort of countdown.

[17:41] If you will, I think it's not going to be impossible to get a Dune the way

[17:45] it's impossible right now to get a Winchester.

[17:48] And I think everyone's just excited for this company to move on to Winchester.

[17:53] I think everyone looked at that topper preorder as a bad move.

[17:59] You know, I don't really see people say that a lot about barrels, but I do feel

[18:03] like David's move there, it was uncharacteristic of him.

[18:07] And it's not how this company normally operates.

[18:10] And it does feel like a weird cash grab moment where there's like a cash flow issue.

[18:17] And you see, you've got people now and they're like, well, how tall is the

[18:19] topper that you haven't even made yet?

[18:21] How tall is it when it's actually sitting on a machine?

[18:24] And these are just things people need to know.

[18:27] And they don't really know because they haven't even made the damn thing.

[18:30] They haven't actually physically put it on top of a game.

[18:33] And you know, for a lot of people out there, every inch or half of inch matters.

[18:38] If you're trying to figure out if you can actually fit a $1,600 topper on top

[18:43] of your game in your game room.

[18:45] Look, I think everyone is excited for Winchester.

[18:48] I'm excited for Winchester.

[18:50] I just want these games to get on the line.

[18:52] I want people to get them and I want to see if it lives up to the hype.

[18:56] And that is my thing about Winchester.

[18:58] The hype is there, baby.

[18:59] The hype is real.

[19:00] The FOMO is real.

[19:01] And heck, people are not selling their games.

[19:03] I just saw people giving up their Harry Potter spots because they're just like

[19:07] going to get a Winchester now because there's no urgency to hold on to Harry

[19:11] Potter because they can go buy Potter whenever.

[19:14] I think they're going to make Potter CEs for years.

[19:17] So yeah, if there's only 525 Winchester's and no show games, you better like

[19:22] hold on to your spot because they're not going to pop up very often.

[19:26] But it's still going to have to be an amazing game to hold, to stay in people's

[19:31] rooms. It's going to have to be amazing because there's just so much coming out

[19:36] that if it's only mediocre, I don't think people are going to hold on to it forever.

[19:40] But we don't know. I don't know yet. You don't know yet.

[19:42] The question right now is when will Winchester make it onto the line?

[19:47] Because they haven't said yet. They haven't said yet.

[19:49] Now let's count the months.

[19:50] This game was revealed at Expo in mid-October.

[19:54] October, November, December, January.

[19:58] Probably not in January, right?

[20:00] More like February or March.

[20:03] So we're probably looking at six months after the game was revealed.

[20:08] It will be on the line.

[20:09] That's a pretty long runway to get to manufacturing.

[20:14] Typically, it's like a two month window between reveal when a boutique

[20:18] reveals the game and then the game is on the line.

[20:21] I don't really have anything to say on CGC other than do you think we're going

[20:24] to see something new after this remake of medieval madness, Merlin's Edition?

[20:30] I see people selling this game a lot.

[20:32] The goodwill with this company is kind of gone.

[20:35] I think people are kind of just exhausted.

[20:37] How long these guys take to execute?

[20:39] The rumored game that I heard is after this is Twilight Zone coming back.

[20:45] Personally, I don't think all these old games coming back is going to be

[20:50] as successful as it would have been like six, seven years ago.

[20:54] I just think there's so much new modern pinball that is so good.

[20:58] It's not like it's that hard to find a Twilight Zone.

[21:01] So that is what I'm hearing they are going to do next.

[21:04] The long rumored game is Mark Ritchie's Halo.

[21:09] We've been saying it for years.

[21:11] Unfortunately, if it is Halo, I don't think anybody wants it.

[21:14] I don't think that property is really popping in culture.

[21:17] So hopefully they moved beyond that.

[21:20] So not a lot to say about CGC.

[21:22] Let's go over to Dutch Pinball.

[21:24] Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[21:26] I'm going to ask them in a week.

[21:28] How many total did you make?

[21:30] How many refund requests have you had?

[21:32] I talked to Melvin last week.

[21:33] He said they only got two, two refund requests.

[21:36] So I think people are going to hold on to these games

[21:39] because they're going to want their back to the future spot.

[21:41] My issue now and my concern now.

[21:44] I got to be canned here.

[21:46] It's back to the future.

[21:47] I'm worried about this game now.

[21:48] I'm worried about this game because I spoke to someone who saw it and, you know,

[21:53] they were excited.

[21:54] They saw the whitewood and I got this sense that they weren't blown away.

[22:00] And that they wanted there to be a few more things in it that were just like, wow,

[22:05] that they want Melvin to get more involved in the project.

[22:10] And I think what Dutch needs to do now,

[22:13] because this game is roughly almost a year away,

[22:17] I think everybody over at Dutch needs to get into a room.

[22:22] And I think all egos, all stubbornness,

[22:26] everything has to be checked at the door.

[22:28] This now needs to be an effort where everybody over there is working together

[22:34] to make this a magical game.

[22:37] And I'm worried that there are sort of still compartmentalizing the development of it.

[22:43] Melvin's over there making Raza, adding all this magic into Raza.

[22:48] And he's got some good ideas for back to the future.

[22:50] I just think him and Barry, and I know it's hard.

[22:52] It is hard to have like two people's design philosophies colliding,

[22:57] especially when there's only so much room under the glass.

[23:00] But the thing about Pinball is it's such a different world

[23:04] than when the Big Lebowski came out.

[23:06] You know, Barry's only made the Big Lebowski.

[23:09] And Pinball's changed a lot.

[23:12] Keith Elwin wasn't even a name anybody knew.

[23:14] The way these companies have advanced over the years.

[23:17] And this company has made just one game.

[23:21] So it is not like Barry's been refining his skill

[23:25] and they've been manufacturing mechs for the last like seven to 12 years.

[23:30] They've only been making the same game.

[23:32] And five of those years, the company was basically making nothing.

[23:36] People are waiting for their Lebowski early achiever additions,

[23:40] you know, their pre-order spots and all that stuff went down with ARA.

[23:43] And so here we are, right?

[23:45] This is like really Dutch Pinball's second game in 12 to 13 years.

[23:50] What other company had a 12 year gap between games?

[23:54] Doesn't really make any sense.

[23:55] And I'm a little worried that old habits might die hard.

[23:59] They just don't have the experience making another game until now.

[24:04] And so I hope they get it all together.

[24:07] I really do.

[24:08] We know the demand is there.

[24:10] And that's the other part they need to figure out.

[24:12] I'm getting nervous about how they're going to like manufacture these things

[24:17] because the demand is going to be through the roof.

[24:19] The rumor I'm hearing is that there are going to be 88 SLEs,

[24:24] 88 for America and 88 for Europe.

[24:28] That's cool. I think that's a good idea.

[24:30] I think they're going to sell out instantly.

[24:31] And if Christopher Franci puts on the cabinet, a big DeLorean,

[24:35] like he did the Batmobile on Batman SLE, take my money now.

[24:40] And I know people already are like trying to figure out how to get on the list

[24:43] for one of those Back to the Future SLEs.

[24:46] Look, the thing about Back to the Future, it's got the movie assets.

[24:49] It's got all three movies.

[24:50] It's going to just crush on just them alone and assets.

[24:54] But we just also want a game that is as fun to play as the best

[24:59] modern games in the market right now.

[25:01] And you know me, I'm always a little confused why it would be hard

[25:05] to make a game as good as a Keith Elwin game

[25:08] when you can simply study his designs.

[25:11] It's not like Keith is working with a material that only he has access to.

[25:16] It's not like he has some cheat code advantage.

[25:19] He doesn't have any proprietary or patented thing happening whatsoever.

[25:23] He just like knows the way a game should feel.

[25:26] And he knows how to lay a game out that just gives you so much great

[25:30] kinetic satisfaction as a player.

[25:33] Why would it be hard for everyone else to do something similar?

[25:36] And yet it is.

[25:38] And yet here we are.

[25:39] Well, the thing is this, though, that's the secret is it's not just Keith.

[25:42] It's Keith's entire team that makes his games magical.

[25:46] And you know who they are.

[25:47] They know who they are.

[25:48] Maybe I just don't know who they are, but he's got his whole team

[25:52] and they work together to make sure all of it comes together

[25:55] because that's really what makes a game magical.

[25:58] It's not just the layout.

[26:00] It's the software.

[26:01] It's the mix.

[26:02] All of it is an orchestra and concert together

[26:06] to make the pinball playing experience magical.

[26:08] All right.

[26:09] So Dutch pinball, we're going to get razes out probably sometime in April.

[26:14] Three hundred and thirty three razes.

[26:17] That will be the bridge to get us to back to the future.

[26:21] Can't wait for that game to be shown.

[26:22] I know I've seen it and it's got some really neat stuff.

[26:26] They're going to sell everyone.

[26:28] He's going to sell these razes pretty much instantly.

[26:31] They really are cool.

[26:32] And when you see the wider screen, it's got the wider deep root screen.

[26:37] It's going to be neat and the code and all the stuff, you know, I don't know.

[26:40] It's just kind of like this game that's finally going to get made.

[26:44] And, you know, you're not going to worry about getting it.

[26:47] So I think they're going to sell everyone easily.

[26:49] All right.

[26:50] So who are we missing?

[26:50] American Pinball apparently is making stuff in this factory.

[26:53] They're making some other sort of arcade machines.

[26:56] And they say they're going to bring a new game, maybe to T.P.F.

[27:01] I just don't buy it.

[27:03] I don't like American Pinball because of what they did to me personally.

[27:07] I accept any apologies they want to give to me.

[27:09] They have not.

[27:11] But I just think Karma and this company is going to play a big factor

[27:15] with how people receive them moving forward.

[27:18] I really don't like giving them much airtime.

[27:21] I think they've made so many bad decisions.

[27:24] And my question now becomes is, who is their George Gomez?

[27:27] So if this company is moving in the right direction, who's steering the ship?

[27:31] Until I know who that is, I don't have any faith they're going to make a good game.

[27:36] And that's all I'm going to say about American Pinball.

[27:39] But hey, if their new George Gomez introduces himself to us

[27:43] and talks about their new philosophy and tells us who's designing their games,

[27:48] who's doing the code, you know, what kinds of themes we can expect.

[27:51] Sure, I'm on board to change my mind.

[27:53] I think it's stupid to not keep an open mind.

[27:56] But there was some dude that visited the factory last week

[27:59] and he said his son saw two titles for pinball machines that were original IPs.

[28:05] And it's like, really, there's no room in this market with Pokemon,

[28:09] Beetlejuice, Star Wars for original IPs to work.

[28:13] Raza is different. It's not even like an original IP.

[28:16] It's got enough awareness all these years.

[28:19] But man, if you want to come out of nowhere now with something completely original,

[28:23] it'll have the same results that Galactic Tank Force had.

[28:27] All right, who else am I missing in the world?

[28:28] The pinball. We got all these companies in Europe.

[28:31] Pinball Brothers with Predator, only 300 sold.

[28:34] I don't know. Next from them is supposed to be Tales of the Arabian Knights

[28:39] or Circus Voltaire.

[28:41] Are you going to buy a John Poppins remake by the pinball brothers?

[28:45] Or maybe that's Padredy. I keep getting confused.

[28:47] I think it's Padredy.

[28:49] Pinball Brothers, I don't know what's next.

[28:51] Padredy is going to be, I think, Circus Voltaire or Toten.

[28:55] They obviously are not going to do Big Bang Bar just yet, but that's another remake.

[29:00] Look, the whole like remake world, I'm over it.

[29:04] It's not exciting.

[29:06] These games are like been around for 20, 30, 40 years.

[29:09] Some of them I'm not excited.

[29:10] I heard they might be bringing back Adam's family as well.

[29:13] Like I'm just not excited.

[29:15] We can get these games easily.

[29:17] To me, what makes pinball exciting is the here and the now, the games that are pretty new.

[29:22] I don't want to keep looking in the rear view mirror.

[29:25] The future is looking so amazing for pinball.

[29:28] I don't really care about these remakes.

[29:30] Our friends in Switzerland making this resonant evil game.

[29:34] I look forward to seeing more of that.

[29:36] They said they're going to share stuff with me exclusively.

[29:38] So look out for that.

[29:40] Who we missing?

[29:41] Hex of pinballs making that Louis Vuitton game for like one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars.

[29:46] How do you go from Space Hunt to Louis Vuitton for one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars?

[29:51] I don't get it.

[29:51] I really don't get it.

[29:53] We've got Turner Pinball.

[29:54] I don't think anyone ordered Merlin's arcade or they didn't sell that many.

[29:58] So I think Chris Turner needs to figure out how to go get an IP people want.

[30:03] And then we've got multi morphic P three with Jerry portal.

[30:07] I feel like I haven't seen people unboxing it.

[30:10] You know, I just don't know, man.

[30:12] You know me, like I just don't know how the multi morphic is going to keep doing.

[30:17] I don't.

[30:17] I just think at the price now because portal all in is expensive.

[30:22] Like the module itself is like the price of a stern pro almost.

[30:26] I just don't know, man.

[30:27] I don't know. I don't think it's going to catch on.

[30:30] I think Jerry really needs to figure this out.

[30:33] I think he could have had one of the most successful boutique companies of all time.

[30:37] And instead, he just had this dream to make pinball differently and come on.

[30:41] It hasn't really worked out.

[30:43] The numbers don't lie.

[30:45] He's a nice guy.

[30:46] He had a dream.

[30:47] But man, like look at what Spooky's doing a year and look at what multi morphic is doing a year.

[30:53] Any questions?

[30:54] I'm losing my voice, people.

[30:55] The reason there's been a delay on the podcast.

[30:57] I'm a little under the weather, but everybody will be back with more episodes of

[31:01] Canada's pinball podcast.

[31:03] We'll talk to you soon.

[31:04] Canada out.
