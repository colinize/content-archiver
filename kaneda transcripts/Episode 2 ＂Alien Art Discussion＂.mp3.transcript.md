[00:00] Booooooo

[00:00] Feeling frustrated ConniderN

[00:04] Now do you understand how it feels being little and helpless?

[00:25] 🎵〜

[00:27] now stay to the badass Ar!!!

[00:30] You do not want to fuck with me.

[00:33] Check it out.

[00:35] Independent targeting particle beam failings.

[00:38] What?

[00:40] I have city, this puppy.

[00:42] We got tactical smart missiles.

[00:44] They fly as a pulse rifle, RPGs.

[00:47] We got Sonic, Electronic, Power Break.

[00:51] Dude, what the fuck?

[00:53] I'd rather castrate myself with a blunt rock.

[00:58] With some of the feedback I got from the first Canadian pinball podcast.

[01:04] That was Mr. Paul Koffee who said that.

[01:08] With some other people agreeing with this statement.

[01:11] Which is great.

[01:12] We're getting a reaction which is, um,

[01:14] you know, expected when I take to the airwaves with this podcast.

[01:18] But today was a big day.

[01:20] We all were expecting

[01:22] highway pinball to reveal

[01:25] the alien

[01:27] play field artwork.

[01:28] And we did.

[01:29] And I want to talk about that on this second podcast.

[01:33] I want to also talk about

[01:35] how that artwork was revealed

[01:37] and give a little feedback on that.

[01:40] And, you know, I want to keep this objective.

[01:42] Because

[01:43] it's early.

[01:44] It's early in this pin.

[01:47] And we haven't seen much.

[01:49] And what we have seen has definitely got a reaction from the crowd.

[01:53] So what I want to do is sort of just.

[01:57] Walk through the day on how we got to see this artwork.

[02:00] And.

[02:02] I.

[02:03] For the life of me cannot understand.

[02:07] Why there is not better communication with some of these companies

[02:10] and how they reveal their assets.

[02:11] And.

[02:12] Look, I know some of you don't give a crap that you think this is just pinball.

[02:16] And this is not marketing.

[02:18] And this is just a small community seeing stuff.

[02:21] Look, and I kind of agree with that.

[02:23] I kind of agree.

[02:24] I'm not here saying that.

[02:26] It's really important that everything happens perfectly and it doesn't need to.

[02:30] But come on guys.

[02:32] For.

[02:33] For real.

[02:34] You've been working on this thing for months.

[02:36] You've been waiting for Fox approval on the assets for months.

[02:40] You now know you have approval.

[02:43] Okay.

[02:45] Get.

[02:46] Your shit together on how you're going to launch it.

[02:51] I really don't even know what the plan was other than okay.

[02:55] Orrick is going to tease out some inserts which he did late at night.

[03:01] That's fine.

[03:02] That's cool.

[03:03] But.

[03:04] The reveal itself.

[03:06] Was a crappy flyer image that people were first reacting to.

[03:11] Which forced Orrick to then quickly respond.

[03:14] Look, again, not a big deal within 30 minutes of stuff happening.

[03:20] But come on guys.

[03:22] Why can't people just plan asset reveal and game reveals a little bit better knowing that

[03:31] these are six, seven, eight thousand dollar toys that people really want to see and have

[03:38] their expectations met for the first time with the right assets and what happens scrambling.

[03:46] Okay.

[03:48] And honestly because I said that that was a piss poor reveal and it was I got permanently

[03:54] ejected from the thread.

[03:56] I want to read something that a good friend of mine on the board said about yours truly.

[04:04] Canada doesn't even understand what marketing is yet is quick to lecture pinball companies

[04:11] as though he's an expert.

[04:13] Who's the only pinball company that wanted his marketing experience?

[04:17] J-pop telling.

[04:20] This isn't marketing canada.

[04:21] This is an art reveal on a pinball form something hardcore pinball fans find interesting.

[04:27] A random person posting a pick of a flyer isn't bad marketing by highway.

[04:31] Two seconds later, Orrick shared the high res play field image.

[04:34] Big fucking deal.

[04:36] Marketing is when the game is actually finished and they are actively manufacturing and selling

[04:41] the game to 99% of the world who doesn't read pinball forums.

[04:46] Okay.

[04:49] Bullshit.

[04:50] If you think that this is the best way to share your hard work on a machine, then I think

[04:59] you're absolutely wrong.

[05:01] I think the hard work people put into this stuff deserves to be revealed in a proper manner.

[05:09] And I'm sorry, but it is all marketing.

[05:12] You're marketing your goddamn company.

[05:14] I'm sorry.

[05:15] And all that it takes is a conversation between Andrew and Orrick to just coordinate.

[05:22] And something happened.

[05:23] Look, and again, it's not a big deal.

[05:25] I'm just saying whenever I'm reading these alien threads, I have no idea who the spokesperson

[05:31] for highway is anymore around this game.

[05:34] This game has become more about Orrick's art than Andrew even talking about it.

[05:39] Now, even in the thread today, the most of the information on the game is coming from a guy

[05:44] who had a conversation with Andrew at a show.

[05:47] Well, why aren't they better prepared to talk about this stuff and share it in a way

[05:54] that makes sense and explains everything?

[05:58] But whatever.

[05:59] I digress.

[06:00] I just want to say thank you, Rare Hero, for calling me out.

[06:04] I'm not knowing shit about marketing.

[06:06] I think if I had done this in any of the clients I represent and how we talk about or show

[06:12] something for the first time, I would get a phone call being chewed out at what the fuck is that?

[06:18] Again, not a big deal.

[06:19] I'm just saying this can be done better.

[06:21] Look, I'm going to cover pinball marketing in another time and I'm going to address specifically

[06:28] the J-pop experience that I had.

[06:31] Okay, I think people give me a lot of shit for that.

[06:35] But I will explain how I got connected to John, the timing around all that.

[06:39] But what I want to talk about today, we got past that.

[06:42] I got banned from the thread.

[06:44] I'm no longer allowed to post an alien thread forever.

[06:48] Apparently the mod team is upset with me and I understand why and I'm on thin ice.

[06:55] So get it.

[06:56] It's all share my opinions about the Playfield artwork here.

[07:00] So the art work comes out and it's interesting.

[07:06] It's really hard, as I said, to judge this before we see the toys, the ramps, the mix, the LCD,

[07:14] how everything is going to work together.

[07:15] We've heard from day one, this is going to be a pinball machine that is all about the atmosphere.

[07:21] It's going to put us into the movies of aliens and it's going to use lighting and it's going to use sound

[07:29] and it's going to do things that really focus on making us feel and immerse us in an atmospheric way.

[07:36] I love that.

[07:37] When I hear them talk like that, I'm super excited because I think that when you look at pinball

[07:44] and you look at games these days, they're so little done to really manipulate the lighting

[07:51] and the sound to create an effect.

[07:54] It's usually just this is blinking shoot here, call out randomly from the property and music.

[08:02] I don't know.

[08:03] I just never feel the kind of immersion that I get with modern video games where they put you into a scene and they keep you there.

[08:11] I love it.

[08:13] I'm going to use Lord of the Rings in an example just because I played all the time.

[08:16] But even just when like destroy the ring and everything goes haywire and goes nuts.

[08:20] I just love it when pinball machines just do things that you don't expect them to do.

[08:24] And so I expect alien to do a lot of this stuff.

[08:27] So the artwork comes out and I'm just going to read some of the feedback that you guys said when you saw the Playfield artwork.

[08:37] Jeff Pinball Palace says Playfield art looks outstanding.

[08:42] Insert lettering is consistent and easy to read.

[08:45] Different areas give off unique vibes.

[08:47] I didn't have expectations or preconceived images but really appreciate how the artwork lays out.

[08:53] Frolick says it feels like it's own piece, not just recycled license assets.

[09:00] Okay.

[09:03] Maybe I'm not sure about that.

[09:07] I do feel that there's just like this outer space sort of look to it.

[09:17] And assets are just sort of laid on top of that space environment.

[09:23] So I do feel there's a lot of just like drag and drop going on here.

[09:27] And I don't know if you guys agree.

[09:29] But from the inserts and stuff, I just feel there is that from the other areas.

[09:34] I don't feel that so much.

[09:36] But you know, I don't know.

[09:39] TVP says it looks like just a lot of cut and pasting from clip art.

[09:45] The inserts and icon art do not blend in well with the background and looks to Photoshoppy to me.

[09:51] It doesn't blend together as a whole.

[09:55] I you know, I look I see that if you zoom in on certain areas.

[09:59] I think in the middle area there were a lot of the inserts are it made feel that way.

[10:04] But again, it's just the art.

[10:08] Right.

[10:08] That artwork is going to be leading up to ramps to toys to mex to things going on.

[10:12] So, you know, I'm not sure it's going to feel that cut in pace.

[10:17] But we'll see.

[10:20] Fantasy Goat says first impressions.

[10:22] I'm not amazed or anything, but it's much, much better than the recent slap shot work from Stern.

[10:29] However, it's not as good as the current Hobbit play field.

[10:32] That's from Fantasy Goat.

[10:34] I would agree that Hobbit is beautiful and amazing.

[10:39] And this compared to Hobbit, a little bit apples to oranges.

[10:43] We're going for a claustrophobic field space versus a fantasy world filled with with all these different bright natural elements and a huge freaking dragon in the middle.

[10:55] But okay.

[10:58] And or he said something interesting.

[11:00] One thing I love about aliens is how the Marines decorate their armor and ship.

[11:03] It makes the universe feel lived in.

[11:06] Pharaoh's fly.

[11:07] The friendly skies.

[11:07] How am I writing?

[11:09] The bug stomper decal.

[11:11] Hudson's skull on the knife drawing on his breastplate.

[11:13] I wanted to bring that all in.

[11:16] So, that's an interesting point.

[11:18] So, I think when you look at the play field,

[11:21] and I'm trying to just pull it up here just because I have a lot of stuff open right now.

[11:27] There's definitely a lot of elements from the two movies that are dropped in here.

[11:36] I'll say this though.

[11:38] I see a lot of the icons.

[11:43] They're the airlock and the air vent inserts.

[11:47] They come from the semiotic standard, which is on the ship.

[11:53] And yes, they pay homage.

[11:57] Not sure they blend in with what's going on in the background.

[12:02] They sort of just look placed on top.

[12:06] But I'll say this.

[12:08] I can't tell from the photos how flat everything looks.

[12:13] Because I think that could just be the photography.

[12:16] I really have to stand over it in person to make an opinion.

[12:22] So, we'll see about that when we are looking at the real thing.

[12:29] Let's see.

[12:31] Perspects, PR, SPX, Perspects, I think I'm saying that right.

[12:36] The pen's biggest problem is that it isn't dedicated to one movie, specifically Alien.

[12:41] Both are different and mashing two things together.

[12:44] It doesn't always give you a Reese's peanut butter cup.

[12:47] It's not the 35th anniversary of Aliens.

[12:50] I don't know.

[12:51] I'm still in, but it might have been easier to recreate the industrial dirty space trucker look of the first film,

[12:58] along with some of Geiger's landscapes, et cetera, if it was dedicated.

[13:02] So I think we heard this feedback a lot that it doesn't have that sort of gritty Geiger sort of old school look of the original.

[13:12] And I'm not quite sure how they could have got around that.

[13:18] Because if they started going more towards the interior look of the first movie and the ship,

[13:27] I don't know.

[13:29] I think you would have been a little bit trapped like you're feeling inside a ship.

[13:34] And instead, this has more of the lost in space, which is the broader theme of Aliens.

[13:40] You can be trapped there.

[13:41] So, Giki, let's see, Giki J. GKJ says glad to finally see the play field.

[13:48] Wish I had unique perspective, but I think my impressions are similar to several others that have been voiced,

[13:54] not quite what I built up in my mind over the last year, but certainly ain't ugly.

[13:58] I won't judge to R&T so I see populated in cab with some gameplay vids.

[14:02] So, I mean, brings up a good point.

[14:04] We all have our preconceived expectations and imagination of what art is going to look like.

[14:11] And for the most part, we've been, I think, disappointed by what we normally see when a game is revealed recently.

[14:19] And I think Alien is in the middle.

[14:21] I really, I don't not like it, but I don't love it.

[14:27] But again, I just think it's a hard one to judge.

[14:30] And I'm going to use, I'll use two games as an example of expectations, blown away expectations,

[14:39] Eh, Game of Thrones.

[14:42] I don't even need to say anything more.

[14:44] Right.

[14:46] Sucked.

[14:49] I'm going to use this as an example and don't crucify me, but Magic Girl.

[14:54] A game we heard was in artistic wonder and lots of time and energy and money went into it.

[15:01] Still probably one of the most beautiful play fields that we'll never see in front of us tragically.

[15:06] But man, like, right, just showed us like what's possible with artwork.

[15:11] You know, so I get what they're going for.

[15:14] Let's go to another quote here Jean-Luc Picard.

[15:19] Is it these on Luke coming at us from the enterprise?

[15:22] He says reminds me of star, I'm sorry, of Stern Star Trek with the grid, space background and icons floating on top,

[15:30] which is not a very good thing.

[15:32] When I think of alien, I think of alien interiors, flesh, industrial metal, not just space and galaxies or retro stars,

[15:39] especially not outer glow layer effects on planets and graffiti, would have been nice to see something more alien and organic or something with weight,

[15:47] like the ships interior infested by aliens.

[15:50] Okay, so we obviously see, you know, this people wanting to have more of like that gritty alien feel.

[15:59] And, you know, I get it.

[16:01] I just think you either got to go that way or you got to go more worther at right now.

[16:07] And I think you can easily get trapped inside of the ship and just that, you know, if you're going to make a guide,

[16:14] or it's got to kind of all be that.

[16:17] And that's not where they were going with it.

[16:21] So, you know, look, overall, what are the impressions of it?

[16:27] I think it's super exciting when we look towards the bottom of the play field and we see all these modes, right?

[16:35] I mean, how can you not get excited by what looks like, I mean, what both movies and multi,

[16:43] and I don't know how many multi-balles are there's going to be.

[16:46] It looks like there's one, two, three, five multi-balls, which, you know, that's awesome.

[16:53] And there's one, two, three, four, five, there's ten modes, you know, five from each movie with five multi-balls.

[17:04] That's freaking cool.

[17:06] So, I think fans of the films are really going to enjoy those.

[17:11] You know, and then it looks like there's, I'm just trying to, I'm just looking at different images guys,

[17:15] there's like the big alien face in the middle, you know, almost like in the same position as like Rob Zombie's face is.

[17:21] It looks like we have the two alien heads off to the sides like where the outer drain lanes are.

[17:28] There's a little alien poking from behind the left flipper, and then we're in sort of an outer space.

[17:36] And I think, you know, I do like how it's dark where the LCD hits, right?

[17:45] When you get to the bottom of the LCD, I like the way it's dark there and it's going to blend in nicely.

[17:51] With that black screen, you know, I still think it's a little off that there's like a screen in the middle of artwork.

[18:00] I know why it's there.

[18:02] Personally, I'm not a fan of it there.

[18:05] I mean, it's there and then it's also on the back box, the same screen.

[18:11] Yeah, I just don't get it.

[18:12] I think highway's initial, initial plan was to only have it there, right?

[18:16] Then they got feedback that that doesn't really work because when people are looking at someone play, they can't see any information.

[18:24] Totally agree.

[18:25] There's a reason why the screen's on the back of the pinball play box.

[18:28] When you're looking down and all you see is the information there, it doesn't help, you know, bring people into the game and it doesn't, doesn't help make the game appealing from a distance.

[18:39] So they put it where traditionally it was and now they've got a huge freaking screen that you can get on the back box.

[18:45] And you also have this screen there.

[18:48] I don't know.

[18:49] I don't know.

[18:50] I kind of wish.

[18:52] I kind of wish because you're not rolling over the screen in a P3 manner.

[18:57] It's not there to do anything like that.

[19:01] I kind of wish if you ordered the back box screen, you could get rid of the play field one.

[19:08] And just see all of the art.

[19:10] I mean, we've got this big planet in the middle that is cut in half.

[19:17] I mean, it just, I just don't think it's going to, I don't know.

[19:20] I just not a fan of that.

[19:22] There are some things that I love that highway's doing.

[19:24] There's other things that I just not a fan of.

[19:26] And I think it must make it hard for any artist to design around that thing.

[19:31] It really is just putting a black box in the middle of your artwork.

[19:34] That is also going to be on the back box.

[19:37] It is like having two TVs showing the same thing.

[19:40] I think highway needs to make up their mind on that.

[19:43] And I think it's a mistake to have the same screen playing the same thing twice.

[19:47] I really do.

[19:48] Okay.

[19:49] So what else do I want to talk about with this play field?

[19:53] You know, the top section above what looks like the green.

[20:00] Is that the queen in the middle there?

[20:03] And then there's just like this.

[20:05] Looks like someone said it looks like foil wrap.

[20:08] Sort of like a reddish sort of.

[20:12] It is hard to describe.

[20:14] Almost like a cranberry color.

[20:16] I think someone said it was like the hallways, right?

[20:18] I think it's hard to see in these images like what exactly it is.

[20:22] So we got that up there.

[20:24] And then another thing that a lot of people had issues with.

[20:27] And I understand it's, it's the grid.

[20:32] All right. And I know it comes from the computer on the ship.

[20:38] But it does look, I don't know, whenever I see grids like that with art and play,

[20:43] it looks almost like how I look at something in Photoshop or like an illustrator

[20:49] where you're using the grid to lay out and line up things.

[20:53] I don't necessarily get the grid from a computer from a ship on this.

[20:58] And I don't know.

[21:00] I kind of think you got a pick or choose.

[21:02] Like am I looking at space?

[21:04] Am I looking at space through a computer?

[21:06] I think Oric just wanted to put so many elements that harkened to the movie.

[21:15] But there might be too much of it that is not really syncing up for me.

[21:20] And the big thing missing from this.

[21:26] And maybe it's fine.

[21:29] There's no characters from the show or from the film, sorry.

[21:34] At all.

[21:36] That kind of sucks.

[21:37] I do like seeing, you know, Bill Paxnan, Sagoani Weaver, you know,

[21:43] the cast and crew of like what made Alien like this, this, it's like this.

[21:48] These, these, these, these astronauts together on this battle.

[21:53] And I don't know.

[21:55] I just, I love for them to, I don't know, lead a light up or their light goes out when they die in the order of the film.

[22:01] I don't know.

[22:02] They're, I just miss not seen in there.

[22:05] I don't, I don't know.

[22:07] It's probably a licensing thing.

[22:08] I don't want to be, you know, belabor that point.

[22:13] Speaking of licensing.

[22:16] I really think that this whole process was hopefully an eye-opening experience for, for Orrick and any artist really who goes into making a license pen.

[22:28] I think someone said it best that Stern deserves a round of applause for having to navigate this, this minefield of working with, with a license and their legal teams and, you know, their internal direction.

[22:43] And still cranked out some amazing play fields.

[22:46] They're not all amazing, but, but most are.

[22:49] I really, and I've said this before and I go on record and I'll say it again.

[22:55] I do wish Orrick would not have been so vocal and so critical of some other license pens that have come out.

[23:04] He was harsh, harsher than harsh on.

[23:07] We all thought Game of Thrones was crap and I agree with him.

[23:10] He was very harsh on Rob Zombie as well.

[23:14] And I know that kills him because he basically went to Charlie and wanted Rob Zombie pen.

[23:20] And it's got to be killer for him not to be in on that pen with such a theme that he loves because of the art.

[23:27] But, all that being said, I just don't think it's appropriate or professional for him to do that.

[23:34] And I'll explain why.

[23:37] As much as he wants to be in this middle ground of I'm a freelance creative director for Highway, I'm not an employee, I get that.

[23:46] But come on man, you are on Highways team.

[23:49] At Expo, you're up on stage with them.

[23:51] At Expo, you are taking the mic from Andrew and you are part of that crew.

[23:57] Behave like it. I think it is an extremely poor taste when anyone who's pretty much embedded with the company.

[24:05] I don't care if you're an official employee or not.

[24:08] When they go out and they start slamming the competition.

[24:12] And you know, here's the killer thing.

[24:15] Slamming the competition before you've even proven your own merit.

[24:21] And now you know what it's like.

[24:24] And now you know how difficult it could be.

[24:26] I mean, who knows, Game of Thrones could have been the biggest nightmare for Stern because of their partnership with HBO.

[24:32] But here's what they would never do.

[24:34] They would never come out and even indicate that working with HBO was difficult.

[24:40] You know why? Because that's the professional thing to do.

[24:44] All right. They want to work with HBO again on a future property. You don't do that.

[24:51] Good luck. Good luck.

[24:53] And I hope Orrick goes far in this industry.

[24:57] But good luck going to get a job now with the biggest manufacturer out there Stern.

[25:03] And he may not want to.

[25:04] So I think he's going to design more games for highway. I do.

[25:08] I think the relationship there is working.

[25:11] But I also think he needs to just like rain in a bit.

[25:14] And I'll tell you another thing I heard I saw was he said that he never wants to do another license pen.

[25:20] Or not ever again, but he wants something to be non-licensed so he has more freedom.

[25:25] That's cool. I understand that.

[25:27] Andrew just said the next three pens are going to be licensed.

[25:31] And I've seen this. I've seen artists who say, oh, I just want to have free rain.

[25:37] Really? Do you really want to be in charge of creating the artwork, the theme of an all-original thing and you think you can make it work?

[25:47] I think Orrick is brand new to making art for Pimble.

[25:53] I think he's done some great translates, some other plastics that have been great, other mods like the Metallica Hammer mold.

[25:58] But this is now when you're taking the reins of the play field and the overall cabinet art.

[26:05] This is it. Like this is the major leagues now and you're you're on a major league brand.

[26:11] It's interesting when you look at the fact that Alien, a huge major property, is now in the hands of someone who's never done this before.

[26:24] Is he failing at it? I don't think so. I don't think he's failing at it.

[26:28] But it's interesting that highway knowing that Alien is a little bit make or break to put this company in the map.

[26:35] Is isn't utilizing people who have done this before or who are veterans in making play field art.

[26:44] Now, like you don't have to be a veteran, you just have to be a great artist who understands how to lay out a play field.

[26:54] You know, one thing that's happening that's really interesting is we're going to have two artists who have both been handed the reins to major movie properties whose games will probably ship in a similar time period.

[27:07] Ork is on Alien and if I'm hearing correctly, zombie Yeti is going to be on Ghostbusters.

[27:15] And that's what I'm hearing from pretty reliable sources.

[27:20] So we'll see. But look at what happened. Zombie Yeti was discovered serendipitously as the guy working on John's art who really came into the community frustrated because his art was never going to see the light of day.

[27:34] And what happened? He now is working with the biggest pinball manufacturer.

[27:40] And that's a great place to be.

[27:44] And in the day, the licenses that Stern will secure are going to be incredible.

[27:50] And there's no point in burning bridges.

[27:53] Zombie Yeti as talented as he is. Do you ever think that guy would go on to a thread and start crapping on other people's work?

[27:59] And I just, look, we do it. We're fanboys. We don't work for any of these companies.

[28:07] I work for Pepsi. I'm not going to go shit on Coke's campaign. If I work for Chevrolet, I know where I work for Dodge. I can't publicly go shit on them.

[28:19] And it's just not professional. So look, Ork's not going to change. He's a very vocal member of the community.

[28:26] People love his insights and that's cool.

[28:30] I just think that if you're going to critique and you're going to do it, that's fine.

[28:36] But man, you better make a highway your home base because I don't think people are going to be enthusiastic about working with someone who is just going to go out there and just criticize and act independent of the connection to the company.

[28:53] So that's that. So in closing, and for those of you who listen to this podcast before I have these closing sentiments, I apologize, something happened with the podcast.

[29:05] I think AlienArt is okay. I don't think it's a home run slam dunk. I think that Ork is learning as he goes.

[29:18] I think he's learning on a pin that needs to be incredible and highway is taking a gamble going with Ork to make the playfield art for such a huge franchise.

[29:31] But I think it's going to tie together and I don't think that anything we're seeing is really caused for huge concern.

[29:41] I do think the reveal was completely just fumbled and look sloppy and they could have just done a better job.

[29:48] And that is something we'll address later on. I think these companies do understand that they're talking to a small community but doesn't mean you have to behave and act in an amateurish way.

[30:00] And as much as my friend rare says this isn't marketing, it is marketing. And every every time these guys are ready to go out with stuff, they should have assets that are ready to go.

[30:11] And they should have communication that is ready to go. And that's that's not hard. It just takes a little planning and coordination and it's something that I don't see many pinball companies doing.

[30:20] It might not matter and you might be right. But I think the pros like Stern, they're doing it right. They're doing it right. And you don't need to join the community and be one of them and like go with some of their professional tactics and behaviors that should be indicative of any company that is once the mature and be a legitimate player.

[30:45] I think highway is going to have a lot of competition this year. I think there's a lot of pins coming out that are going to be asking people to hand over $68,000.

[30:57] So what we've seen so far, I don't think is making people run to put in money on LE's. I don't think it's going to make people ask for refunds either.

[31:09] So it's early and I think we all agree. I do congratulate Orrick on his first play field art job. And I think that he's going to grow and get better.

[31:21] And I think we're going to see how this whole game ties together. And I think if they can do the atmospheric sort of immersion within the alien franchise that they've been talking about, I think it'll be a success.

[31:36] I do recommend that highway ditch the screen on the play field. And I hope they rethink some of the cabinet layout that is currently the only option.

[31:48] I think Andrew is on a mission to differentiate his company from what's out there. But the difference is that they're implementing. I don't think they're going to be, I don't think they're making it better.

[31:59] And I also don't think people are going to go for that swapping out of the play fields very often. I mean, where do you put an extra play field?

[32:06] Okay, so in closing, exciting day to see Alien Art. Exciting to hear the thoughts behind it and the exciting to see the thread blowing up.

[32:16] Thanks guys for listening to episode two or episode 1.5. Look for something shortly. And I will talk to you guys real soon later.
