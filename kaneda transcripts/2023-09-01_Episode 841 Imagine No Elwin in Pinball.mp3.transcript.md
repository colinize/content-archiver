[00:30] I want to say, am I second guessing who I think should be the second most highly anticipated pinball designer out there?

[00:37] On my last episode out of the 22 designers

[00:40] I said John Borg is the one that I think is second place after Keith Elwyn on who we should be most

[00:46] Excited about to see what they have cooking up next now look

[00:49] I've spent the last 24 hours thinking about that decision and I just want to talk about it

[00:54] I didn't really go into all the other designers out there that some of you might be more excited to see what they have cooking up next

[01:00] Now before I do that I want to do a real quick thing first

[01:02] I want to say thank you everybody for sticking around

[01:04] It's a new month some of you that five dollars burns too much of a hole in the pocket and every month

[01:09] We lose like 20 people and then they come right back

[01:12] But I want to give a shout out to Ryan W who asked me to say the following thing

[01:16] He said hey Chris would you mention this pinball show tournament on your show?

[01:21] It's located in Ann Arbor, Michigan

[01:25] 500 games set to free play the show is Saturday

[01:29] September 30th with an IFPA tournament the following day October 1st

[01:34] All right

[01:35] So there you go if you're around the Ann Arbor, Michigan area at the end of September check out this pinball show

[01:41] Thank you Ryan W. I want to give a shout out to Stefan him and his dad acquired a neon sign from an arcade

[01:48] He used to go to in Italy when he was a child and the arcade has since closed down

[01:54] And he found this sign and this greedy guy wanted 2,000 euros for it

[01:59] And he finally was able to get it for 500 euros

[02:04] Congratulations Stefan you see it just goes to show you that the greedy bastards are not just in pinball

[02:09] They're all over the place like once this guy heard that this was a childhood sign that meant a lot the guy puts a

[02:15] $2,000 price tag on it. It's sort of like stern pinball charging

[02:19] $2,000 for flat plastic topers all right

[02:21] So let's talk about pinball and second guessing who I think is the second best designer in all of pinball now

[02:27] Look John Borg is a great designer. He has definitely made some I don't know questionable or mediocre themes recently

[02:33] But they're not that mediocre

[02:35] I mean rush did win pinball game of the year a lot of people would argue the reason why rush did win

[02:41] It wasn't really going up against anything else

[02:43] We were really excited about and the more I thought about this I heard some of your feedback some of you said hey

[02:49] John Borg just keeps recycling the same ideas. It's a little cookie cutter. He's not really pushing the envelope in pinball

[02:56] I could see that you know, I didn't mention people like Eric Minier

[03:00] Let's talk about Eric for a minute, you know after fired to the Caribbean and after guns and roses

[03:05] I always did believe in Eric Minier

[03:07] And I thought he would always come out with games that would really push the envelope of

[03:13] Creativity push the envelope of theme integration and I feel a little bit bad because Godfather's not his fault

[03:19] He was handed Godfather by Jack Guinari, you know

[03:22] It's hard to even look at Godfather and say he did the best he could with this game

[03:27] The thing about Godfather that still stands out to me and this had to be a creative decision by Eric Minier and Keith Johnson

[03:35] The moment they decided to put employees from Jersey Jack pinball into the game

[03:40] Showed me that they don't really get it

[03:42] You don't do that like you can't make a top gun game and have Jack Guinari and Ken Cromwell as like pilots in the game

[03:50] You can't do it

[03:51] You can't have Christopher Franchi be like a general on the aircraft carrier

[03:55] You fly by and Christopher Franchi's coffee spills in his face

[03:58] So what made them think that they could take this iconic movie and put employees into the game and that was a creative

[04:06] Decision and once I start to see stuff like that

[04:09] I kind of get a little nervous that the judgment made by the designer isn't a good decision

[04:14] Like someone should have overruled that and yes, I am very excited to see what Eric Minier does next

[04:20] But the big issue is this how far away are we from Eric Minier's next game?

[04:24] It's probably like three years from now, you know, Mr.

[04:27] Satan's game is coming out and Mr.

[04:29] Richie's game is coming out so there are two designers in front of Eric Minier now over at Jersey Jack pinball and Jersey Jack

[04:37] Pinball only makes like one game every 18 months

[04:40] It's really hard to get excited about something that is so far away

[04:44] Same thing with my friend over at Dutch pinball

[04:47] Barry over at Dutch pinball has made arguably one of the coolest games in the big Lebowski 10 years ago

[04:53] 10 years ago, we know that their next game that they're super excited about

[04:58] Probably is not even gonna be revealed until maybe the end of 2024

[05:03] So that is like walking up to a beautiful woman who says she's going to sleep with you a year from now

[05:10] So yeah as I'm doing a show in August of freaking 2023

[05:15] And I'm trying to figure out who's the second best designer and pinball we should be excited about after Keith Elwyn

[05:21] It's really hard to get excited about something that is so far away

[05:26] You know and with 22 designers in this pinball hobby

[05:29] You would think there would be more people though that would get us more giddy and more excited

[05:34] Some of you mentioned George Gomez and without a doubt George Gomez is a great designer

[05:39] The one thing with George Gomez games and everybody knows this they are a little bit clunky James Bond is clunky

[05:46] Right there are a lot of shots in that game that are super clunky. They're super tight

[05:51] I wouldn't say James Bond is a game with great flow. It's not a game with great flow

[05:55] What I like about Gomez is he at least tries to put mechanisms and toys into the game

[06:00] But is anyone out there think about it? Are any of you really impressed by the toys and James Bond?

[06:05] I'm not like none of those toys are really wow moments in pinball that missile in the game isn't very impressive

[06:11] When it comes to mechs and toys, right? If we look at every single game that came out in

[06:17] 2023 there is not one single mechanism in all of pinball that really blew us away

[06:23] Ladies and gentlemen, this is the reason why if I'm honest with you and I mean it when I say it if I'm really honest with you

[06:29] I'm really not that excited about most of what's happening in pinball right now

[06:35] And that is one of the main reasons is when I look down at a game

[06:38] And I look at all the years and all the money and all the effort that goes into these machines

[06:43] And I look at how much money these games are right now. There's no avoiding it, right? How much money they are?

[06:49] I'm not gonna harp on the price, but for this much money

[06:52] Shouldn't we look down at these modern games that are costing more than pinball has ever cost it and

[06:58] Shouldn't we see a mechanism in a game in every single game that does something?

[07:05] Amazingly well that creates a moment of magic that creates a wow moment where you say oh my gosh

[07:10] Did you see what that mechanism can do?

[07:13] We saw a lot of cool stuff in Godzilla, but since Godzilla has anybody on a design front

[07:20] Designed a mechanism in pinball that has blown you away

[07:24] And that's my point is Godzilla was like two years ago. We've got two years of pinball

[07:30] We've got the highest prices pinball has ever been we've got all of these machines coming out

[07:35] And we're out of ideas on how to put toys into a game. Is there a single toy in the Godfather?

[07:40] That's impressive. No, is there a single toy designed in galactic tank force? That's impressive. No

[07:46] Is there a single toy in foo fighters that blew you away? No, is there a single toy in pulp fiction that blew you away?

[07:53] No, is there a single toy in venom that's making you say oh my gosh, how did they do that? No, there's not nowhere

[08:00] So is it only Keith Ellen is he the only guy that can actually put mechanical magic into the game

[08:05] And we just saw the other day that Jersey Jack pinball hired

[08:09] Stern's head of mechanical engineering and I'm just gonna say this people

[08:14] Stern doesn't lose anybody that they want to keep alright. Let me repeat that

[08:18] Nobody leaves stern that stern wants to keep and think about it like this leaving stern has never been a good move for anybody

[08:25] Think about it

[08:26] All I know is people trying to get back into stern like Christopher French would do anything to get back at stern

[08:32] You think he wants to be making these games for AP and JJP?

[08:35] No, he would love to be back at stern in a heartbeat stern is where you want to end up because they have the most games

[08:41] They have the best themes. They have the most talent

[08:44] But even so even the mighty stern at these prices and all these designers George Gomez John Borg

[08:50] We've got Jack danger. We've got Keith Ellen. We've got Brian Eddie even with all of that

[08:55] Collective might we really are only seeing mechanical wow from one designer as I think about it the gap between

[09:03] Keith Ellen and everybody else is

[09:06] Such a large gap that it almost has created in the entire hobby a

[09:11] Feeling that like you might as well just wait to see what Keith Ellen does the only game you really need to have FOMO around is

[09:19] A Keith Ellen game

[09:21] Everyone else's product everybody else's games are games you can wait and see on and it creates an interesting

[09:29] Discussion is Keith Ellen enough to carry this entire industry

[09:34] He really is the guy that has the industry on his back

[09:38] He is like Atlas shrugged with a big pinball on his back and without him think about it without Keith Ellen

[09:45] What would modern pinball be like right now? It wouldn't be nearly as exciting

[09:51] And what's great about having someone like Keith Ellen and seeing what he does with pinball is I think he's the only

[09:57] Designer going right now and I mean it when I say this. This is a very important fact

[10:02] He is the only designer going right now that can justify these prices

[10:08] Nobody else in pinball. Nobody not George Gomez not John Borg not Brian Eddie not Luke and bug

[10:15] Not Eric Mignor nobody else in pinball when you look at what they're putting out over the last few years

[10:21] Nobody else in pinball can justify these prices and that is why everyone who thinks like oh

[10:27] Scalping is dead flipping is dead. It's dead on every single game

[10:31] That's not a Keith Ellen machine when Keith Ellen jaws gets announced

[10:35] And I know there's pinside threads where people are debating about the popularity of jaws trust me when jaws comes out

[10:42] It is already sold out Keith Ellen is the only designer that will sell out without even having to show you a game

[10:50] And he's earned it and nobody has any doubt that Keith Ellen is gonna hit it out of the park

[10:55] It's the same way

[10:57] Lyman sheets was in pinball whenever we knew Lyman was coding a game

[11:02] We knew it was gonna be great. There were no question marks. There were no doubt

[11:05] It might take a while to get there with Lyman code

[11:08] But when it got there it was better than everything else in pinball

[11:11] And so that is why I wanted to do this quick follow-up show because I really had a lot of things going on inside my head when I was thinking about it

[11:19] I'm like am I really Chris am I really waking up and being like I can't wait to see what's next from John Borg and the answer is not really

[11:25] But I think out of all those other 21 designers who are not named Keith Ellen

[11:30] I think he's the second best designer

[11:32] But the more I think about it the gap between Keith Ellen and him and everybody else

[11:37] It's a country mile and I still think this hobby needs new talent. I'm super excited to see what's next from Jack danger

[11:44] I really am I think Jack has such potential

[11:47] I think Jack's gonna learn from someone like Keith Ellen. Do you feel like Brian Eddie wants to learn from Keith Ellen?

[11:53] I'm not sure like look at Venom. It's just another boring fan layout like there's no way to hide it

[11:58] It's a boring fan layout. It's like just cookie cutter over and over again

[12:04] But I do feel like Jack is gonna be the padawan to the master of pinball who is Keith Ellen

[12:10] I really do feel that vibe between those two and Borg's been around a while like I don't know like I don't know if Ellen's gonna rub off on him

[12:16] Everyone's got their own style, but everybody as we head into the fall of 2023

[12:22] It's going to be very interesting what happens between now and the end of the year

[12:27] I think the demand for all the games that came out this year has dried up

[12:31] And so now you've got all of these companies that need to keep the pinball

[12:36] Manufacturing line going and what are they gonna do the pressure is on people the pressure is on it's gonna be exciting to watch

[12:43] And I don't know about you, but I think it's fun to talk about this stuff

[12:47] I think it's fun to do a podcast about this stuff

[12:49] It's fun seeing people do Facebook lives and talk about this stuff because as a spectator

[12:54] It doesn't cost us anything and we can just keep being better friends and having offline

[13:00] Conversations and we can talk about what's gonna happen because all of the pressure in this hobby now

[13:05] It's on the backs of distributors and it's on the backs of the manufacturers and everybody's realizing this if you wait it

[13:12] You could get Scooby-Doo for two thousand dollars less money

[13:15] If you waited you could get the godfather for two to three thousand dollars off if you waited you could get toy story for

[13:21] $4,000 off now, I mean guns and roses lees now

[13:24] You can't even give away a guns and roses le right now

[13:26] And I know there's a balance in life for how much do I live for today?

[13:30] And how much do I live for tomorrow and nobody has guaranteed time in life?

[13:34] And I get it like if you have means and you don't care and you just want to play everything new of course

[13:38] You're gonna go buy it like you're not gonna listen to me, but for everybody else for the 95% of people out there

[13:44] I think now is a time to just wait when Keith Elwin's game comes out

[13:48] You better be on a list to get it the L. E's are gonna sell out instantly. I think there's gonna be an SLE of the game

[13:54] I think we're gonna see a feeding frenzy

[13:56] It's like putting chum in the water that there is gonna be a feeding frenzy of a great white shark

[14:02] That's gonna attack everybody else's pinball plans in early 2024

[14:06] I'm excited for it because as I said, I think this is the only time where we're gonna see a game that justifies the prices everybody

[14:13] Let me know how you feel about this is Keith Elwin the only designer that can justify the prices

[14:18] Like do you think Godfather?

[14:20] $15,000 $12,000 do you see it? Do you think Pat Lawler could get 15,000 for toy story?

[14:26] Do you think Venom L. E is worth $13,000?

[14:29] I mean just saying that looking at Venom and then actually going up to someone and saying hey the L. E costs

[14:35] $13,000 get the f out of here and then they're gonna charge us $2,000 for a topper

[14:41] So $15,000 for a Venom a freaking Venom. It's not gonna work. It's not working

[14:47] Everybody thank you so much for the support. We'll be back real soon

[14:50] You're getting a lot of shows this show is not gonna end and I will be back on Facebook one day

[14:54] I'm really enjoying the break. I'm having a great time with my family and friends and yes

[14:59] I do have friends and yes, I do enjoy spending time with my family versus arguing with people on Facebook

[15:06] It's a waste of time. Canada will be back

[15:08] No one's ever gonna be able to fill my time slot with the show as good as canada's pinball podcast

[15:13] You know this everybody will talk to you soon later

[15:17] Oh

[15:47] You
