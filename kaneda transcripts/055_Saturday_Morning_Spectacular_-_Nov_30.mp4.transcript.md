[00:00] All right, we're live here.

[00:03] Let's do this.

[00:05] Let's get the Saturday morning show off the ground.

[00:08] Let's take this link.

[00:13] Let's copy it.

[00:16] Let's go to Facebook first.

[00:27] Where do we go?

[00:28] Share this screen.

[00:30] Copy.

[00:31] There we go.

[00:47] Mm-hmm.

[00:49] All right, everybody.

[00:50] We're going to get this show kicked off in a second.

[00:52] You know how it is.

[00:53] So we slow run in here.

[00:55] What's Facebook all mess weird?

[00:56] What's going on here?

[00:59] Let's just come on.

[01:00] Let me post.

[01:04] Where's like my ability to post?

[01:06] Oh, here we go.

[01:06] This is why.

[01:16] Saturday show is live.

[01:26] All right.

[01:28] I think by now, right?

[01:29] Shouldn't everybody by now know that we're doing this on YouTube?

[01:34] Do I have to tell everybody?

[01:36] I don't want to keep posting the link.

[01:40] So I think everybody hopefully figures the stuff out by now.

[01:45] It's like always going to be here.

[01:47] All right, it's always going to be here on Saturday,

[01:49] unless otherwise, otherwise noted.

[01:59] See, I make it louder, louder, louder, louder.

[02:04] Oh, it's how's everybody doing?

[02:08] It's always going to be on YouTube from now on, right?

[02:10] So I'm not, I don't want to go around like posting 18 different links.

[02:14] Just everybody get in here and let's do it here.

[02:18] Like it's going to be, that's how we're going to do it.

[02:22] Um, I'm looking forward to today's show.

[02:26] There's a lot to talk about, a lot to talk about.

[02:31] Oh, how's everybody doing?

[02:33] Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

[02:35] Let's drop this into our chat.

[02:41] We are live.

[02:43] We are, we are going to talk about all the manufacturers.

[02:47] It's been a busy week.

[02:49] Been a busy week.

[02:53] I feel like I should just create.

[02:55] It's like people need like handholding to get in here.

[02:59] I feel like let's just do this live.

[03:05] Oh my gosh.

[03:07] For you early birds who come in at the right time,

[03:09] you know, like you understand my frustration with like,

[03:12] like having to lead all these people to the show like this every week

[03:18] is just getting a little tiresome.

[03:20] Just, just join Saturday.

[03:25] I'm just going to do SMS live now.

[03:29] I'm going lazy on it next.

[03:33] And I'm just going to predate it yesterday.

[03:41] For some reason, it always like tries to go the other day.

[03:47] Oh man, what is it?

[03:48] What is it going?

[03:51] December.

[03:53] December.

[03:54] Still in November, right?

[03:55] Yeah, here we go.

[03:58] Publish.

[04:03] All right.

[04:06] Now we're good.

[04:07] Now we're good.

[04:09] I was trying to get this volume up a little bit.

[04:17] There we go.

[04:18] There we go.

[04:19] All right.

[04:20] How's everybody doing?

[04:21] We doing good.

[04:22] We have a good Thanksgiving.

[04:27] Canate is going to get down on the ground for this one.

[04:33] Hopefully this core doesn't crap out.

[04:38] Can you guys hear me?

[04:38] All right.

[04:39] Are we doing all right in the pinball world?

[04:45] Is everybody doing all right?

[04:48] How's it sound?

[04:49] Are we sounding good?

[04:52] I got relegated to the garage.

[04:54] relegated to the garage.

[04:59] Mama bear is with the children.

[05:02] So we're going to see how comfortable we can get this.

[05:05] Because it's going to be about over an hour here.

[05:12] Maybe I can sit on this.

[05:13] Do you get the drive the dodge?

[05:15] No, you don't get the drive the demon when it's below like 50 degrees.

[05:20] So it's not happening.

[05:22] It's not happening.

[05:26] All right.

[05:26] Here's what we're going to do.

[05:27] We're going to open up audacity.

[05:28] We're going to record this for our Saturday morning audio for people.

[05:38] Robert, thank you, brother.

[05:42] We got a lot to talk about.

[05:43] We got Black Friday deals by Jersey Jack.

[05:45] We got evil dead.

[05:53] Oh, that's better.

[05:58] Why won't you stay loud?

[06:07] All right.

[06:07] This is way better.

[06:09] Let's do this, everybody.

[06:12] I'm going to hit record.

[06:27] All right.

[06:28] Welcome, everybody.

[06:28] Did the Saturday morning spectacular coming at you live from the garage

[06:34] date, Kaneda, everybody.

[06:36] Hope you guys had a really great Thanksgiving.

[06:39] It's been a crazy week in Pimbal.

[06:43] I'm glad to have you guys hanging out here.

[06:45] I know that it's like a food coma kind of week.

[06:49] I don't know about you, but I'm done with pie.

[06:51] I'm done with leftovers.

[06:53] I've been just grazing all day long over the last like three days,

[06:59] just eating so much I don't normally eat,

[07:02] waking up, feeling terrible, going to bed,

[07:06] pretty buzzed up in Haddon's watching like cold case or forensic

[07:11] files.

[07:12] I got to stop.

[07:13] I got to stop.

[07:14] We're going to talk about Pimbal.

[07:16] We're going to have a cup of coffee.

[07:18] And we're going to go across the Pimbal Horn and talk about everything

[07:22] that's happened over the last week in the world.

[07:24] The Pimbal had is that sound.

[07:27] There is a lot happening.

[07:29] A lot of like the vibe of the Pimbal hobby is really what I'm interested in.

[07:36] I feel like certain games have such a great vibe happening.

[07:42] And certain games people are ready to give up on.

[07:46] Chris, it was a great talk.

[07:47] We're going to talk a little bit about Catwoman Edition, Batman.

[07:51] We're going to talk about these use game prices.

[07:53] We're going to talk about where I think most people's mindset is,

[07:57] which is basically I just want a great new game.

[08:01] I think everyone feels that way.

[08:03] And for a lot of you out there,

[08:05] if you want a great new game, there are so many games out there.

[08:09] You don't only have to chase new inbox.

[08:11] In fact, chasing new inbox, as we all know,

[08:14] is an absolute recipe for disaster.

[08:17] And I think most people know that, right?

[08:19] Most of you out there are absolutely burned.

[08:23] If you've bought new inbox over the last like four years,

[08:27] we're going to talk about some of these prices.

[08:29] John Wick, new inbox, 10,000 firm.

[08:32] No one's giving you 10,000 firm for a John Wick new inbox.

[08:36] But let's start out this show.

[08:39] Let's start out with like, let's go in order

[08:42] of where I think the major conversation is happening.

[08:46] And we're going to start with spooky pinballs, evil dead.

[08:50] Seems like that game came out a month ago, right?

[08:52] It's only been about a week.

[08:53] How many do we think they've sold?

[08:56] How successful of a launch was this game for a spooky pinball?

[09:01] And what have the vibes been around the game?

[09:05] So I first want to say that I hope you've enjoyed my podcast

[09:09] around evil dead.

[09:11] I had a good conversation with Bug the other day.

[09:15] He was very thankful of my last show.

[09:17] I think it was very balanced.

[09:18] I think it was very fair.

[09:20] And I think overall, what a tremendous week for spooky pinball,

[09:25] what a tremendous launch of evil dead.

[09:29] And the overwhelming vibes around the game are super positive.

[09:34] I think anyone who's an evil dead fan absolutely loves

[09:37] the fact that they can get this game.

[09:40] I think spooky pinball as a company has poured a lot of passion

[09:45] into this game.

[09:46] And I think they've sold somewhere north of 650 in just one week.

[09:52] Really good week for spooky pinball.

[09:55] A good week for fans of evil dead.

[09:58] I think there's just a lot more to like about this game

[10:01] than not like Christopher Franci absolutely crushed it

[10:04] with the art package, the sound, the callouts,

[10:09] the mechanisms, the topper.

[10:12] There's just a lot more to like than not like in the game.

[10:16] Now hopefully the quality will be there.

[10:18] Hopefully there won't be servo issues.

[10:21] Hopefully nothing goes wrong with the code of the game.

[10:25] But all signs are pointing in a very positive direction

[10:30] for this game, for this company.

[10:33] And once again, spooky pinball has utilized a great window

[10:38] between Thanksgiving and the New Year's.

[10:41] They've sort of like made November, December their moment

[10:46] to take the stage to release a game and to get a lot of love

[10:52] and to get a lot of non-refundable orders.

[10:55] Remember, there's something to be said about selling 650 plus

[11:00] non-refundable orders.

[11:02] On a game nobody has played.

[11:05] Really, really good.

[11:06] Now look, if it was a more popular theme,

[11:08] we all know this game would have sold out in day one,

[11:11] they know that I know that it didn't, right?

[11:14] Rick and Morty sold 750 in one day.

[11:17] Rick and Morty was also much cheaper, not by much,

[11:20] but still cheaper.

[11:21] Here's my thing right now.

[11:23] Now that they've sold 650, if you want one,

[11:27] you just wait it out.

[11:29] There is no point right now in being number 650 to 888.

[11:35] What, one is it?

[11:37] No, 888, right?

[11:38] 8881 was X-Men.

[11:40] The thing is this, is I see people saying,

[11:42] like, I'm gonna go order Evil Dead now,

[11:45] and it's gonna be a great Q1 2025 news flash.

[11:50] If you order Evil Dead now, you are not gonna get your game

[11:54] in Q1 of 2025, you're not even gonna get your game

[11:58] until maybe the end of 2025.

[12:04] So like, you have to sort of be realistic

[12:07] that I just don't think there's a point going in now,

[12:11] because as I've been saying, by the time they make

[12:15] even just like 300 of these games,

[12:18] you're gonna see the next game from Stern,

[12:21] you're gonna see Harry Potter,

[12:23] you're gonna most likely, if you're at number 400, 500,

[12:27] you're gonna start to see King Kong from Keith L,

[12:30] and you're gonna see Spike 3,

[12:32] you're gonna see maybe the new game from American Pimball,

[12:36] you're gonna see what else is coming out in the Pimball world.

[12:39] A lot of you out there are gonna be asked to pay

[12:41] for your Pulp Fiction at least.

[12:43] We're gonna talk about that.

[12:44] I don't think anybody cares.

[12:46] Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is also gonna supposedly

[12:49] start shipping in January.

[12:51] I'm not so sure about that, we shall see.

[12:54] But my point is this, by the time they get to where you would be,

[13:00] there's just gonna be a lot more games out there.

[13:04] So I think just at this stage,

[13:08] let them start building the games.

[13:10] You also, here's the benefit of just waiting now,

[13:12] is you're also gonna get a lot more feedback

[13:15] about the game itself, right?

[13:17] Right now, think about it.

[13:18] You've got one gameplay video delivered to you

[13:21] by the company that made the game.

[13:23] Of course, it's gonna look great because they make the video.

[13:26] But just wait it out.

[13:28] And I still think they're gonna ultimately end up selling

[13:32] most all of them, if not all of them.

[13:36] Again, I think that's because of the good vibes.

[13:38] I think it's because of the passion.

[13:40] And I think everybody else is kind of like dropping the ball.

[13:44] You know, it's sort of helping Spooky's stock

[13:47] is everyone else's stock is sort of declining.

[13:50] So good job on the launch.

[13:52] Yes, Mr. Franchi, I've been relegated to the garage.

[13:56] I was gonna do the show upstairs,

[13:58] but a lot of diapers and killing and screaming.

[14:02] So here we are.

[14:03] So I think really good week for Spooky.

[14:06] I think they're also learning.

[14:07] I do think Spooky is learning that these sort of horror themes

[14:13] are still not creating the frenzy that we could create

[14:20] if we went a little bit more mainstream.

[14:23] So I do think that if they have like a Gremlins

[14:28] or they have he-man masters of the universe

[14:32] or they have something like GI Joe,

[14:34] I don't know, I'm just throwing out more mainstream stuff.

[14:38] I think they're gonna like just crush it.

[14:41] And with Franchi making the artwork on these games

[14:44] moving forward and these guys really developing mechanisms

[14:50] and toys and magnets and upper plate fields,

[14:53] lower plate fields hidden flippers like this is Pimball.

[14:58] This is what Pimball should be.

[14:59] Creativity, thinking a little bit outside the box,

[15:04] giving people a lot further money.

[15:06] And I wanna say congratulations to the team over there.

[15:09] I think it's been a very, very good Thanksgiving

[15:12] for all of them and they seem very thankful

[15:15] for the community.

[15:17] And I think that's gonna go a long way.

[15:21] They don't need more mainstream.

[15:23] Ah, it's a, you know, Captain, this doesn't make any sense.

[15:28] Like it does, nothing will change how fast they can make games.

[15:33] But the more mainstream and the more popular the theme is brother,

[15:37] the more that game is gonna hold value,

[15:40] the less likely people are to sell it.

[15:43] And it's just even more beneficial to spooky.

[15:45] The more exposure they'll get to the larger sort of world out there.

[15:51] Because more people will get excited

[15:53] about a more mainstream theme.

[15:54] I'd like, again, they're in the driver's seat

[15:58] and they just really, you know, really are gonna be able

[16:02] to like call their own shots moving forward.

[16:04] So Charles Thomas said be this in Butthead.

[16:06] So this is the truth about be this in Butthead.

[16:10] That Stern Pimball had an opportunity to make it,

[16:13] but they said it was too risque.

[16:16] Too risque.

[16:17] Yet they'll make a game based on John Wick

[16:20] where he murders 30,000 henchmen

[16:23] and then makes the game without guns.

[16:25] How is be this in Butthead too risque?

[16:28] Last time I checked, is be this in Butthead even R rated?

[16:32] And yet you'll make John Wick.

[16:35] So I don't understand.

[16:37] Look, I think Stern Pimball, let's go to them next

[16:39] because I think the next big story

[16:43] of what's been happening in the Pimball space

[16:46] has been sort of like, Stern Pimball seems like a champion player

[16:54] who's not quite himself right now.

[16:56] If I had to use an analogy,

[16:59] they're like Travis Kelsey.

[17:01] Like if you pick Travis Kelsey on your fantasy team,

[17:05] you were so used to him just crushing it

[17:08] at the tight end position.

[17:10] And now the numbers just aren't there.

[17:13] He seems like the success has gotten to him

[17:17] and he doesn't seem like he's trying his hard,

[17:19] he's not working in the gym as much

[17:21] and he's just not showing up.

[17:23] And if I look at Stern Pimball these days,

[17:26] I think they're a little bit like that.

[17:28] I think they've got moments of greatness with Metallica

[17:33] and then they've got X-Men

[17:34] which just seems to be a game

[17:37] that is just continues every week to lose momentum,

[17:43] to lose enthusiasm.

[17:45] So let's go down like what's like eating away

[17:49] at Stern Pimball's sort of like enthusiasm for their fans.

[17:54] So we'll start with, let's start with Metallica real quick.

[17:57] Hold on, I'll make it my coffee.

[18:05] Nine refundable coffee mug.

[18:10] Still does a job.

[18:16] All right, we'll start with Metallica.

[18:20] Now that Kaneda was like slammed viciously

[18:25] for wanting to scalp one of his Metallicas,

[18:29] now other people are selling them easily,

[18:32] instantly for $18,000.

[18:35] So thank you everybody who has really mad at me

[18:38] for all the hard work I do,

[18:40] for legitimately grabbing a spot.

[18:43] I didn't cut the line, I didn't get special treatment.

[18:46] I legitimately bought a game

[18:50] and now I'm not allowed to speculate

[18:53] and I basically took $5,000 away from this family.

[18:57] I did.

[18:58] You know who would have bought my game?

[19:00] Some rich guy who's worth multi-million of dollars

[19:02] and he would not have even cared.

[19:04] And I just want to say for the record,

[19:07] I'm really disappointed in the amount of people

[19:10] that got mad at me, that thread into quit my show,

[19:13] people who give me $5 a month.

[19:15] Okay, so think about that for a minute.

[19:17] So I basically sacrificed five grand

[19:22] because people who give me $60 a year

[19:25] thought it was disgusting what I was trying to do.

[19:28] Even though they were nowhere to be found

[19:31] when I lost money on other games

[19:33] or took huge hits on other titles I got.

[19:36] So I just want to say for the record,

[19:38] I'm never doing that again.

[19:39] I'm just letting everybody know that right now

[19:43] that if I legitimately grab a game,

[19:46] it's mine to do what I want to do with.

[19:48] And if you think that's disgusting behavior,

[19:51] then that's on you,

[19:53] but it's a fair game people, it's fair game.

[19:56] I did not get any special treatment.

[19:59] I bought a game like everybody else.

[20:01] It was on a website,

[20:03] it wasn't even with the distributor that I ever buy from.

[20:05] So I just want to say that, all right?

[20:07] So I lost $5,000.

[20:09] So just, just, and if you knew,

[20:11] and this is the other part,

[20:13] if you knew what happened to me because of this hobby

[20:18] and the reason why I had to go on a hiatus

[20:23] and the reason why I had to take my Facebook page down,

[20:26] if you knew how much money I lost

[20:29] because of what this hobby did to me,

[20:32] nothing I did myself,

[20:34] like someone came after me,

[20:35] if you knew how much money I lost,

[20:38] you would have understood why I tried to recoup

[20:40] some of that loss by flipping a metallic.

[20:43] So that's my personal story for all the people out there

[20:47] that you have no idea what's happening, okay?

[20:49] You have no idea.

[20:50] And I was simply trying to get some money back for this family

[20:53] because when your daycare is 6,000 a month

[20:56] and you have holiday bills piling up,

[21:01] you have to understand,

[21:02] I'm gonna do what's right for my family.

[21:04] So here's the thing,

[21:05] now I'm watching people sell Metallica Ellie's

[21:09] instantly for $17,000 to $18,000.

[21:12] There's no hesitation.

[21:13] People are buying these things like they are candy.

[21:17] I would say the going rate on a game right now,

[21:20] I think 18 is the sweet spot.

[21:22] I don't think if you try to sell yours for 20,

[21:25] you're not gonna get it.

[21:27] I would absolutely like, don't be too greedy,

[21:32] but I think 17 to 18,

[21:34] you're gonna find buyers all day long.

[21:36] And again, because I think these games are just only 500,

[21:41] it's built on a theme that is evergreen

[21:44] and it's built on one of the greatest games ever

[21:48] and it's Alignment Sheets Masterpiece

[21:50] that has just been made better.

[21:52] So I just think 18,

[21:55] you're out the door with five grand in your pocket

[21:58] and what it's exciting seeing these guys do this

[22:01] and for those of you who sold yours for 18,

[22:04] I just wanna state this,

[22:06] the gentleman buying these games.

[22:09] All right, I always think about it like this.

[22:11] Look, if Ed Robertson wanted to pay 5,000 over sticker

[22:16] or Bill Brandis,

[22:18] it doesn't mean anything to them.

[22:19] I think about like my dad made way more money than me

[22:22] or makes, has more money than I do.

[22:24] If my dad really wanted a pinball machine

[22:28] and having it in his house,

[22:30] if the difference in getting it was between 13,000 and 18,000,

[22:35] it means absolutely nothing.

[22:38] And I'm just, I just want everybody to remember this.

[22:41] The people buying these games for the most part,

[22:45] let's be honest, can we be candid for a minute?

[22:48] The people that are chasing after a super hard to get Ellie

[22:52] that is like for their pinball collection,

[22:57] for the most part,

[22:58] you are talking about multi-millionaires, right?

[23:03] People that have at least a few million dollars

[23:06] in their net worth,

[23:08] most of them have millions of dollars liquid

[23:12] that they could throw at something.

[23:14] So I just want you guys to remember

[23:17] that I don't know who you think you're saving these games for.

[23:21] I don't know why you think it's so disgusting.

[23:24] You know, when I go down the streets in these towns, gang,

[23:26] it's like the houses like start at like one and a half million.

[23:31] They go all the way up to 20 million dollars, okay?

[23:33] So stop acting like you're on some moral crusade

[23:37] to make sure, you know,

[23:39] some guy who's been saving his pennies

[23:41] gets his Metallica Ellie.

[23:42] It's absolute hogwash.

[23:45] And I think there's, it's just you just want it for yourself.

[23:48] Like let's just be honest.

[23:49] And the people that are crying the loudest

[23:51] are just mad because they didn't get one.

[23:54] And they got locked out, okay?

[23:57] So I just want to say that like,

[23:59] you need to stop pretending like you're doing some moral

[24:02] or ethical good thing

[24:04] by stopping,

[24:05] the scalping every once in a while of a rare pinball machine.

[24:09] It's actually very healthy for the pinball collecting community

[24:13] that some games go up in value.

[24:15] If you try to prevent games from going up in value,

[24:20] then you will absolutely destroy the second hand market of pinball.

[24:24] If all pinball manufacturers try to bake in the second hand price

[24:29] into their games, then they will tank the value

[24:33] and they will tank the demand for their products.

[24:36] And basically gang,

[24:37] we're pretty much seeing that on every single stern Ellie

[24:41] other than like Metallica recently, okay?

[24:43] I just want to like,

[24:44] just like,

[24:45] can we have an adult conversation about this?

[24:48] Because it's what we're seeing.

[24:50] So when you see a John Wick Ellie

[24:53] for 10 grand new inbox, right?

[24:56] Ellie new inbox 10 grand.

[24:58] How do you think everybody who bought a stern John Wick

[25:02] Ellie feels right now?

[25:03] It didn't dawn by one.

[25:04] He went to the factory, right?

[25:06] He saw the beautiful trans light

[25:09] and he spent 13,000 on one, right?

[25:12] The code's not even done.

[25:15] And now you can march in and get one.

[25:16] And I mean like, look, a John Wick Ellie

[25:19] opened with low plays, $8,500 all day long.

[25:25] And even if you ask that for that game,

[25:28] it's not gonna sell right away.

[25:30] So dudes are taking $4,500 losses on a brand new game.

[25:36] All right?

[25:37] And dudes are making $4,500 on a brand new game.

[25:41] Now you know what?

[25:42] That's just a state of where we're at in Pimbal.

[25:45] So I just wanna say look,

[25:47] if I had a Metallica Ellie, I'm gonna be serious.

[25:50] If I had one, I would sell it.

[25:54] If I love Metallica, I would sell it.

[25:57] And then I would just go get a premium for like,

[26:00] and it would only cost you like $4,000.

[26:03] I would change the trans light

[26:04] and you're having the same exact experience.

[26:07] Just add the expression lighting

[26:09] and you're having the same exact experience.

[26:13] But if you absolutely love Metallica,

[26:16] the only time I would keep it

[26:19] is if you absolutely love Metallica.

[26:22] Okay?

[26:23] All right, cool.

[26:24] Are we cool?

[26:25] Are we cool?

[26:26] Like are you guys cool with this?

[26:27] Like are we talking like grown adults now?

[26:30] Or do we have to talk like little kids

[26:31] where everyone gets a trophy?

[26:32] Because I think the world's changing,

[26:35] you know, not everybody gets included, right?

[26:38] The diversity and inclusion,

[26:40] all those programs out there in the world,

[26:43] everyone who's got a DEI job,

[26:45] like they know they're all in trouble.

[26:47] And so for all of you crying

[26:49] that we should have pinball socialism,

[26:50] I think you're gonna be in trouble.

[26:53] All right, Metallica Ellie is the game of the year.

[26:56] Well, there is no longer an award show, nobody,

[26:59] it would not get voted game of the year.

[27:01] I absolutely do not think it would get voted game of the year.

[27:04] I still think it was an older game

[27:07] that's been remastered, but it wouldn't be game of the year.

[27:10] All right, so let's talk about

[27:13] the other side of the Stern coin.

[27:15] So we've got Metallica hit.

[27:18] Then they've got nothing really else

[27:21] that is exciting people right now.

[27:24] I really feel bad for my friend Jack Danger.

[27:28] The more I watch the vibes around X-Men,

[27:32] the more I feel so gutted

[27:36] that Stern wanted Jack to release this game

[27:40] before it was ready.

[27:42] I feel so gutted that Stern stuck Wyson on X-Men again

[27:47] and he did it again.

[27:49] I just feel like this was one of the most creative layouts

[27:54] in the history of Stern pinball.

[27:57] It's one of the most fun designs ever.

[28:00] And it is now being plagued

[28:03] by mechanical problems with the plunger

[28:07] and how the game shoots

[28:08] because they didn't test it long enough.

[28:10] It needed a few more months to bake.

[28:13] And then Wyson's code is the ultimate disaster of the game

[28:19] because the game just isn't there.

[28:22] And it's not going to get overhauled.

[28:24] The foundation of the code is not really where it needed to be.

[28:30] And now I think it's kind of over.

[28:35] I, the game's now been out.

[28:37] Wait, like this isn't,

[28:39] the fixes are not coming for this game.

[28:42] And everyone can see the writing on the wall.

[28:45] The fixes are not going to come.

[28:48] The demand for the game is never going to return.

[28:51] And it's just going to be like the next kind of Avengers now.

[28:55] We're like, you know, it's beautiful.

[28:58] It shoots uniquely,

[28:59] but it's just never going to get back to having,

[29:02] it's never going to have the moment it deserved to have

[29:06] if they had done it right.

[29:08] And I feel bad for Jack

[29:10] because like when you're a designer, man,

[29:12] you pour a year of your life or more into this game

[29:17] and he did and he cares so much.

[29:21] And I think it's a learning lesson.

[29:22] I don't know why Wyson, like I don't know, I don't get it.

[29:26] I don't get it.

[29:26] I don't get what he was doing.

[29:28] You know, I heard from people internally over at Stern

[29:31] that if you think the code is bad now,

[29:33] like you should have seen like where it was.

[29:35] Like, yeah, the whole thing just feels like,

[29:38] like the, I don't know, like the way the code was developing

[29:42] did not sync up with the game or the storyline.

[29:47] So I don't know, I think it's going to go down

[29:50] as a big mess.

[29:52] It's an absolute gorgeous pin,

[29:55] but you know, they rushed it.

[29:57] And I think what sucks is whoever forced Jack

[30:00] to rush this game out,

[30:01] most likely Brian Eddie delayed again.

[30:03] He's always like delayed.

[30:05] Most likely Brian Eddie's Dungeons and Dragons wasn't ready.

[30:10] And so we got this.

[30:12] And then not helping Jack out was dropping Metallica Ellie

[30:17] right on top of his game at Expo,

[30:20] which became the talk of the show.

[30:22] So a lot of, like just a lot of really,

[30:26] I think marketing mistakes and manufacturing mistakes

[30:31] that led to an unfinished game.

[30:33] And like at these prices gain, this is the problem now.

[30:36] At these prices, nobody has patience anymore

[30:40] for you to get your act together.

[30:42] You can't ask me to spend 13,000 on a game.

[30:46] It's incomplete.

[30:47] The music isn't there.

[30:49] The excitement of the modes is not there.

[30:52] It's just not there.

[30:54] It's coming across as like shallow and complete

[30:57] and then add to the mix all the mechanical issues.

[31:01] And it's like such an,

[31:03] it's like I think people are just like,

[31:04] I'm just gonna avoid it for now.

[31:08] And that's the biggest problem is it's not just software, right?

[31:12] And so if it's broken, as Chris is saying here,

[31:16] and doesn't work right, why would I go get one?

[31:19] All right, gang, I need to take a look.

[31:22] I usually don't do this.

[31:23] I need to take a little bit of a quick bathroom break.

[31:25] I think it's just his coffee's running through me.

[31:27] I'll be right back.

[31:28] Don't go anywhere.

[31:32] And we're gonna tack on this missing time

[31:34] to the end of the show, all right?

[31:36] Hold on.

[31:40] Oh, I'm gonna take off my side here.

[33:23] All right.

[33:53] We're back.

[33:54] I'm back.

[33:58] Oh, thank you.

[34:00] Oh, we gained people.

[34:02] Let's go to the bathroom more often.

[34:07] Did I wash my head?

[34:09] You know, you're, you know, you're a parent.

[34:13] When you were a child,

[34:15] you were a child.

[34:16] You were a child.

[34:17] You were a child.

[34:18] You were a child.

[34:19] You were a child.

[34:20] You were a child.

[34:21] You were a child.

[34:22] When you walk into the living room and kill you,

[34:25] what are you doing?

[34:25] I gotta go caca.

[34:29] All right.

[34:30] All right.

[34:30] So here's the thing.

[34:31] Here's the thing.

[34:32] X-Men, I just think it's like,

[34:35] it's just not gonna come back anytime soon.

[34:39] Stern sort of did it to themselves,

[34:40] rushing this game out.

[34:42] And I just think it deserved.

[34:44] It just doesn't have, can I be, can I be Candid?

[34:48] It just doesn't have the magic.

[34:51] It doesn't have the magic.

[34:52] From the moment you hit that start button,

[34:55] that code just doesn't grab you.

[34:59] And, you know, it's got this really cool layout.

[35:03] And there's like all this potential.

[35:06] Like what a game with so much potential.

[35:08] And I just think Wyson made a game.

[35:11] That's a little bit soulless.

[35:13] It's uninspired.

[35:15] The way he does the battles.

[35:17] And like the music and some of those battles gang,

[35:20] it's like, it's like, it's like,

[35:22] it's like store bought music that's just open license tracks.

[35:27] Like it just doesn't have the soul, the personality,

[35:32] that it really needed to have.

[35:36] And so here's the problem with Stern is like,

[35:40] by the time, I don't know, they figure out

[35:43] maybe some ways forward,

[35:45] you're going to be on two more Stern games.

[35:48] So speaking of more Stern games gang,

[35:50] you can look, you can believe me or not,

[35:52] John Borg is working on the new Tron.

[35:56] It is, I've heard that it is a remake of the old Tron

[36:00] that he's just modernizing.

[36:03] So for those who think like it's not going to be based

[36:05] on Tron Legacy, it's not going to have Daph Punk.

[36:07] I think it is.

[36:08] I think it's going to be a re-release

[36:11] of the iconic Tron machine.

[36:14] And much like Metallica,

[36:17] and he's been working on it the same way he's worked on Metallica.

[36:23] And with the success of Metallica,

[36:26] how did all these people just join?

[36:27] Did I just hit someone,

[36:28] did someone just share this somewhere?

[36:30] With the success of Metallica,

[36:33] I mean, it's a no-brainer that Seth Davis and George Gomez

[36:36] are going to do the same thing with Tron.

[36:39] And I keep telling people this,

[36:42] I keep telling people this,

[36:43] if you have a Tron Ali right now,

[36:47] you've enjoyed it for over a decade,

[36:49] you could probably get now 17,000 for it.

[36:53] See, the problem with Tron Ali owners now,

[36:55] is I think it's worth like 21,000.

[36:58] You know what kills me is like,

[37:00] there's a guy, Batman S.O. Lee,

[37:01] he wants 37,000 or best offer.

[37:05] What's happened to people?

[37:08] Really, what's happened to people?

[37:10] So I keep thinking about what's next from these guys.

[37:15] Cause here we are, it's almost December,

[37:17] and X-Men came out a while ago,

[37:20] and all the rumors are that it's gonna be Dungeons and Dragons

[37:25] from Brian Eddie and Dwight Sullivan.

[37:27] And I just wanna say gang, good luck.

[37:32] Good luck.

[37:33] D&D is not, is not a big enough theme,

[37:39] a big enough hit, is not gonna do what Stern needs

[37:44] a game to do right now.

[37:47] I just think D&D is gonna kinda come and go quickly.

[37:51] For a few reasons, is that we all know

[37:53] that Elwin is after that with King Kong,

[37:56] and we also know Harry Potter is right around the corner.

[38:00] I mean, if you had a choice between Dungeons and Dragons

[38:02] and Harry Potter, I think Potter is gonna be

[38:04] the much bigger theme.

[38:06] I just don't think this is it.

[38:09] I think Stern is gonna get caught now

[38:13] with their lack of market research is catching up to them.

[38:17] And I think they're gonna like,

[38:20] I think they're gonna struggle.

[38:22] And I think the way out of this quagmire for them

[38:27] is gonna be to like re-release older games,

[38:30] but again, then they're burning the old owners.

[38:34] I don't know, like I owe Seth a follow up.

[38:37] I did talk to George and Seth.

[38:39] I gave them some interesting ideas.

[38:41] I have a lot of thoughts.

[38:43] King, I'll tell you this right now.

[38:44] I mean, I'm gonna be completely candid.

[38:47] Completely candid.

[38:49] I think Stern's issues are all because,

[38:55] as an organization, they don't have a chief marketing officer

[38:59] doing his or her job.

[39:03] They just, they need to build a marketing department.

[39:08] And because I think what people don't understand

[39:10] is like a marketing department is not what you think

[39:15] when it comes to Pimball.

[39:16] A marketing department in Pimball is making sure

[39:20] that they're getting you the right themes for the market.

[39:24] They're also able to think about themes

[39:29] that maybe being overlooked

[39:31] that would just translate so well

[39:34] into a super successful Pimball game.

[39:37] I just don't see it. I don't see it.

[39:39] I think Stern's marketing has been jody.

[39:43] Is it Josh or Zach Sharp over there?

[39:45] I always forget which one is it Zach over there?

[39:48] Which Sharp is over at Stern?

[39:54] And so it's Zach, okay.

[39:56] So Zach is over there.

[39:57] So like Zach is doing marketing for the audience

[40:01] that is attractive to him,

[40:03] which is more of like the tournament player

[40:07] and the operator, like I don't see Zach,

[40:10] do you ever see Zach connecting?

[40:11] I mean, does he ever see Zach connecting

[40:15] with new inbox home buyers anywhere?

[40:18] Do you ever see Zach doing a Facebook live,

[40:21] like talking to people who buy his product?

[40:24] Do you see anyone from Stern really,

[40:27] kind of reaching out to you guys who have been buying

[40:30] hundreds of thousands of dollars of their product?

[40:34] And again, I'm gonna go back to Seth this week.

[40:40] And look for me, it's just simple.

[40:45] Because I know Seth wants to build a marketing department.

[40:47] It's just like, look man, if you wanna do it right,

[40:50] I would help you guys do it right.

[40:52] But I don't wanna just be a PR guy on the side,

[40:55] giving you ideas that nobody can execute.

[40:59] Cause I do think like when you get the marketing right

[41:01] in the pinball world, to me the marketing needs to happen

[41:04] well before the end product, right?

[41:08] Cause if you do your marketing properly,

[41:11] and again, it's not just the games and the theme selections,

[41:14] if you do your marketing in the right way,

[41:18] you won't have to do any of that other work.

[41:22] You won't have to do any of that other work.

[41:24] Because you will have made the right decisions

[41:26] and the things will just work hard for you.

[41:30] And that's what is exciting to me.

[41:33] And again, I don't know, I'm gonna just,

[41:35] I'm just gonna throw it on the table for them.

[41:38] If you wanna get a guy who's got a 25 years experience

[41:42] in marketing and launching products and brands

[41:45] and understanding communities and culture,

[41:48] I'd be happy to explore what that might look like

[41:50] with Stern Pinball, but again,

[41:53] you know, just, we'll see.

[41:56] And I know, look, I know their hearts are in the right place.

[41:59] I mean this, like I actually really enjoy Seth.

[42:03] I really enjoy George and Gary.

[42:06] I think they're very, very smart businessmen.

[42:10] And I think they just are at a crossroads.

[42:14] I mean that.

[42:16] They're at a crossroads.

[42:18] And I think they need to sort of figure out

[42:22] how to embrace who they are as a company

[42:26] and how to actually embrace who their audience is.

[42:30] And I think they're kind of acting a little too,

[42:34] like, you know, future proof our industry 10 years from now.

[42:39] And I think they're making moves

[42:42] that are gonna really hurt them in the next two to three years

[42:47] which they can't really afford constant misses.

[42:51] I also just think they're at a touch

[42:53] with who's always gonna be their target audience.

[42:57] But it is what it is, right?

[42:59] All right, but you know, look, again,

[43:01] not, I don't think it's unfixable.

[43:06] I think they're just at a crossroads.

[43:07] And I think that over the next two years,

[43:10] Stern Pinball needs to really wake up.

[43:15] And they need more professionals over there.

[43:17] When it comes to the marketing department, again,

[43:19] I mean, like, Jody, they got like Jody Zach and Jared.

[43:23] Like, and I don't even think the three of them

[43:26] even like get along or collaborate on anything.

[43:33] Right? As Jared's still over there.

[43:35] Like, I mean, they're like, and you're paying these people

[43:37] money.

[43:39] I feel like, I don't know.

[43:40] I just don't get it.

[43:41] That's not like, Stern should be operating

[43:45] on a marketing level with more polish and swagger

[43:48] than they do.

[43:51] Okay.

[43:53] So here is the thing everybody.

[43:54] Here's the thing.

[43:57] Let's talk about Jury's Jack next.

[44:01] How's that sound?

[44:04] Black Friday deal.

[44:06] The thousand dollars off.

[44:09] I look, I don't have a problem with games going on sale.

[44:14] You know, I've been saying this for years.

[44:17] You're going to have to discount old games

[44:22] if you want to move the inventory.

[44:25] So like, I don't know.

[44:26] It'd be weird for anybody to be like, ah, you know,

[44:28] this sucks.

[44:29] They're putting games on sale.

[44:31] I think what I found interesting about their sale prices

[44:36] is how off they are from the market value of the games.

[44:42] No game more so than guns and roses.

[44:44] I just think a guns and roses Ellie is now selling new

[44:50] in box for $6,500.

[44:53] Okay.

[44:54] And I can point you in the direction of a distro

[44:57] who will probably take that cash on the table if you have it.

[45:02] Okay.

[45:02] Let's not pretend like GNR is a $10,000 pin

[45:08] and $9,000 pin in $8,000 pin.

[45:13] It's not.

[45:15] Okay.

[45:16] So that one makes no sense.

[45:19] The thousand dollars off.

[45:20] The one that was most surprising to me

[45:24] wasn't there a thousand dollars off avatar Ellie?

[45:29] When I saw that,

[45:31] I was worried about that one

[45:34] because to me, that's the biggest mistake they're doing right now.

[45:39] And correct me if I'm wrong gang,

[45:40] but didn't they offer avatar for 11 from 12?

[45:45] Like they took a thousand off.

[45:52] Yeah.

[45:52] So Ryan just said the random video clips and call out.

[45:55] It's killed.

[45:58] So here's the thing.

[46:01] Okay.

[46:02] So avatar was not part of the black Friday.

[46:04] That was at IOPPA.

[46:05] Okay.

[46:06] Thank you for clarifying before.

[46:11] It's a, I just want to say this about Jersey Jack.

[46:17] And you know me, I have a lot of feelings about Jersey Jack

[46:20] and Brett Abbas.

[46:21] You know, I had a great conversation with Brett Abbas.

[46:24] You know, I talked to Brett Abbas.

[46:25] We were talking about cars.

[46:27] I was telling him how much I love this car.

[46:29] This car was about, you know, taxing everything.

[46:32] This car is about $40,000.

[46:35] I asked him what his, his, his most favorite car is in his collection.

[46:39] And it's a, a Shelby original Shelby AC cobra that he,

[46:44] I think he got for 1.2 million.

[46:47] Okay.

[46:47] So just, just remember that the Abbas family is in it.

[46:53] Like they're in it.

[46:55] And I just, the most annoying thing to me is when people say

[46:59] that Jersey Jack needs a hit or else.

[47:03] There is no or else.

[47:06] There is no moment in which this company will struggle to survive.

[47:11] The amount of money they have, the Pimble operation is peanuts people.

[47:16] It's peanuts.

[47:19] It's like if someone were to go into your sock drawer and light all your socks on fire

[47:26] and then say, oh, he's not going to be able to wear any outfit anymore.

[47:29] Like this means like they, they make more money on interest off of their money

[47:36] than they could ever make with Jersey Jack Pimble annually.

[47:40] So I just like want you guys to realize that as long as they want to be in it,

[47:47] it is, it is, it is.

[47:49] Now here's the part that I am confused about.

[47:53] And I know everybody is confused about.

[47:56] Guys, stop saying billionaires don't want to flop after flop.

[47:59] It's like you, you, you, you have to understand the dynamic of this company that Leonard

[48:05] has made Brett the president isn't Brett the president of JJP.

[48:11] If I was a Leonard, if I was a billionaire and Killian didn't have like a career or, you know,

[48:20] if Killian was just into something and I, and I bought Killian Stern Pimble,

[48:26] because I'm worth billions.

[48:28] You, you, you, you, you, like that's, like that's it.

[48:32] It's a father hooking up his son with something that they're into.

[48:37] Like it's just you, you guys don't, you don't quite get.

[48:41] I don't know.

[48:42] You guys, there, there, there is like wealth.

[48:45] And then there's like insane, like generational wealth.

[48:50] And it's just, it's different.

[48:52] It's different for folks like that.

[48:54] They're doing it not for the money.

[48:56] Trust me.

[48:58] They're not doing it for the money.

[49:00] So I, I think what's unfortunate for Jersey Jack is that the haven't had more hits.

[49:10] And with a seemingly huge financial backer, they then don't get all the assets.

[49:19] They don't get the right themes.

[49:21] They don't get the right games out.

[49:24] You know, there's, there's two things this company has going for it.

[49:28] The money of the Abyss is and the relationships that slash could bring.

[49:36] Now, I'm not sure they even utilize slash enough, but man, everybody loves slash.

[49:41] If you need to get Kurt Russell's likeness in big trouble and little China,

[49:47] like have slash give him a call, be like, hey, Kurt.

[49:50] Man, like here's a deal.

[49:51] Like I know you guys have your licensing deals and all these things, but here's a deal.

[49:55] Like you, you should have mortalized this movie in pinball form the way I did with guns and roses.

[50:01] This company, like, can you give them permission?

[50:04] Like it's like every, every impossible to get celebrity can give you permission if they just want to.

[50:12] You know, and I just don't think they utilize him enough to build the bridges.

[50:17] Obviously the relationship between Leonard and John Landau led to Avatar.

[50:24] But I, like, I think this company is, um, it's, is, uh, you know, just really just, I think it's just fun to watch Jersey Jack.

[50:36] It's fun to watch them sort of continue to like, just like, I don't know, like not.

[50:46] Progress.

[50:47] Yeah, I, I, I think there's no better way they haven't made a better game since guns and roses.

[50:53] And for those of you who are saying,

[50:54] Alton John's the better game BS, then Elton John would have sold 5,000 units.

[50:59] Elton John would have sold 6,000 units.

[51:01] Guns and roses has sold probably five times more games than Elton John.

[51:07] You know, so like, oh, but it's the better game.

[51:08] So don't give me that.

[51:10] Don't give me that because most people just don't want, they don't want to see Elton John.

[51:14] They want to see Axel and slash.

[51:16] They want to see, they want to hear GNR.

[51:19] So like they haven't made a game as good as guns and roses since guns and roses.

[51:24] No, it would not.

[51:26] It would not have sold.

[51:27] Chris, you're out of your mind.

[51:28] You think if Elton John was $3,000 less, they would have sold another 4,000 units.

[51:33] These guys are, you guys are like bonkers.

[51:36] I don't, I don't, do you think someone who has nine grand doesn't have 12?

[51:41] Are you guys like, do you got like what world?

[51:43] I mean, come on guys, like let's be honest.

[51:45] Again, can we have a big boy conversation here?

[51:48] When you go to take money to buy a pinball machine, I know you're looking at liquid,

[51:54] you're a liquid area of your finances where there's tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars

[52:00] to go buy your little toy.

[52:03] And to think that like thousands of more people would buy Elton John, if it was $3,000 cheaper, no, you're wrong.

[52:10] Absolutely not.

[52:10] They just don't want Elton John.

[52:12] They just don't want it.

[52:17] Come on gang.

[52:18] Come on.

[52:19] I'll go buy Brenda $3,000 a pair of chopsticks today if she really wanted them.

[52:24] I mean, it is not a deal breaker gang and I'm not even rich.

[52:27] I'm not even rich and I'll do that.

[52:30] You, you, Elton John is not selling because people don't really want Elton John.

[52:37] They don't.

[52:39] It's a fun game.

[52:40] It's just not like it's not as cool to own as Guns and Roses.

[52:44] Gang, do you remember the launch video of Elton John versus G&R?

[52:50] Whatever, you know, like gang, if $10,000 is a ceiling for you, you're in the wrong hobby now.

[52:55] Look around you guys.

[52:56] How is that the ceiling?

[52:58] You're not going to get anything.

[52:58] Heck, spooky's not like $12,000.

[53:08] Anthony, you get the spooky game with the topper and with the butter cabin.

[53:12] You're at $12,000.

[53:15] I, you guys are like, I mean, I don't know what to tell you.

[53:20] Like, because, you know, I don't know.

[53:22] I don't know what to tell you.

[53:25] Look, the thing is this, the thing is this.

[53:30] Let me ask you guys a question.

[53:32] Do you think they're going to mess up Harry Potter?

[53:34] I mean, to be a Harry Potter is everything, man.

[53:37] Because like what I talked to Eric, he was like, this is my dream theme.

[53:42] This, this is the one.

[53:43] Like Eric's been answering homework assignments on every game.

[53:46] Even Guns and Roses, Eric Minier is not a G&R fanatic.

[53:50] He's not a godfather fanatic.

[53:51] He wasn't a pirate to the Caribbean fanatic.

[53:54] But he told me that him and his girlfriend or is it his wife?

[53:58] I think I forget his partner and him.

[54:01] They love Harry Potter.

[54:05] Now he didn't say Harry Potter.

[54:07] He said they love the next theme.

[54:09] I love the next theme so much.

[54:12] All right. All right.

[54:14] All right.

[54:15] But then I got a little nervous because the next thing he said to me after he said

[54:20] he loves the theme so much.

[54:23] He said the game plays really fast.

[54:26] And I was like, oh, okay.

[54:30] Like like wide open and empty fast or like a quidditch kind of game going on.

[54:37] You know, a la star wars hyper drive or hyper loop.

[54:41] You know what I'm saying?

[54:42] Like I was like a little nervous because playing fast sort of indicates

[54:48] might be kind of empty.

[54:50] And I'm just worried that this game could be a lot of switches and muted clips.

[54:59] And if that's the case, then, you know, I don't know, you know, it's just like

[55:07] it is what it is.

[55:08] I mean, again, again, when was the last time?

[55:11] I mean, when was the last time Jersey Jack like exceeded our expectations?

[55:21] When was the last time they came out with a theme you wanted and just nailed it.

[55:28] And just made the code fun, made the game inviting didn't hand you a diner menu of

[55:37] rulesets like avatar.

[55:39] When I look at that avatar rule set, I just I throw it over my shoulder.

[55:42] It games done.

[55:42] This game's never going to be fun.

[55:44] It's never going to be fun because the stuff that Keith Johnson put into that

[55:48] game like the journey of that game, the fact that he went that nuanced.

[55:56] It's like he failed.

[55:58] He failed to capture what avatar is all about.

[56:03] Avatar is all about trying to protect your planet and the emotion of the Navi feeling like

[56:13] their world is being pillaged and raped by these humans.

[56:19] And what, you know, what that loss of planet feels like to them.

[56:25] Like the game doesn't deliver that on any level.

[56:31] You know what I'm saying?

[56:32] Like they miss the forest, the bioluminescent forest for the trees.

[56:36] The whole game is just devoid of any of that soul, any of the passion and any of the real

[56:43] theme that is that you need to make people feel when you play the pin.

[56:47] It's like there's nothing at stake.

[56:50] And then you're just collecting all these dumb notes that people don't remember and you're

[56:54] battling dumb crab suits that people don't remember and none of it comes through.

[56:58] None of it feels like anything's happening.

[57:00] None of it's wow.

[57:02] None of it's wow.

[57:05] You know, so it's like, okay, cool.

[57:07] Cool.

[57:08] Spend all the effort on the topper and on the armor and, you know,

[57:12] nothing, nothing in the world.

[57:15] It just doesn't work.

[57:16] It just doesn't work.

[57:19] All right.

[57:19] So like Harry Potter, the word on the street is we're going to see Potter in February or March.

[57:27] So that's coming up fast people.

[57:30] It's going to come up faster than you realize.

[57:34] And let me just say this.

[57:39] I want to be blown away by Harry Potter.

[57:44] I hope I'm blown away by Harry Potter.

[57:48] I've lost all faith in Jersey Jack Pimble though to do that.

[57:53] It the balls in their court to do it.

[57:56] If you have a Guns and Roses and you want to alter your monitor, let's talk about that for a minute.

[58:01] Yes, I did it.

[58:02] Yes, it's easy to do.

[58:04] Yes, there's like a secret menu you can get to.

[58:06] If you have a Guns and Roses like an older Ellie or a CEO, it is so easy to do.

[58:13] You just hit the power button, turn the monitor off.

[58:17] Then you hold down the menu button and hit the power button.

[58:23] Okay.

[58:24] And then let go of your fingers and then tap the menu button.

[58:29] And it will open up a black window in the upper left section of your monitor.

[58:36] You then want to scroll down to where it says page and it has a zero.

[58:43] You want to change that number to one and then hit enter.

[58:48] By the way, enter is the menu button.

[58:51] Then when you get to the first page, so there's like basically two pages, zero and one,

[58:56] you then go to the backlit number, which is set at 50.

[59:05] And you lower that number to 35, save it, exit out, then go to the main menu and change brightness

[59:16] to 90, contrast to 100.

[59:19] And your Guns and Roses display will all of a sudden look phenomenal.

[59:26] The blacks will be deep black.

[59:28] The contrast is twice as good as it is out of the box.

[59:33] I can't believe we've all had this game for four years now and nobody has known how to do this

[59:42] until now.

[59:43] So I'm not sure who the gentleman is on Pinside who figured this out.

[59:49] But thank you for doing it.

[59:52] And it makes everybody's Guns and Roses look phenomenal.

[59:56] All right.

[59:57] Let's go on.

[59:58] Let's talk about Dutch Pimball.

[01:00:00] How about that?

[01:00:03] Look,

[01:00:05] do we think Alice's are going to be on the line in the next two months?

[01:00:09] I hope so.

[01:00:11] I think Melvin's got some coding to do.

[01:00:14] He needs to make the game like he needs to wake up the game more in the code.

[01:00:22] He's already done cool stuff.

[01:00:24] I've talked to him.

[01:00:24] He's added a lot more ways to get to the upper play field.

[01:00:29] I think he heard that feedback at Expo.

[01:00:32] It was just too hard to get up there.

[01:00:34] There's now going to be like skill shots where you can get up there right away.

[01:00:38] I think you're going to have a lot more fun with the physical stuff in the game because he's

[01:00:42] going to change the ability to access that stuff more often.

[01:00:46] I think that's a smart move.

[01:00:49] I also think he, uh, like he needs to dial in more of the sex appeal of the game into the code.

[01:00:54] You can't have like these voluptuous, beautiful, sexy, like,

[01:01:02] images all over the game.

[01:01:04] And then none of that's in the code.

[01:01:06] So I think they got to get more of that in.

[01:01:09] Alice stole the show again at the Australian Expo.

[01:01:14] Well, look, I think people line up for Alice because they're curious.

[01:01:20] Uh, is it sold out?

[01:01:22] I don't know.

[01:01:23] I heard there's still some available in Australia.

[01:01:26] Like I'm still in on an Alice at the end of the run.

[01:01:30] It's a safe place for me to be.

[01:01:33] I, I, I just, you know, again, I think we're going to have to see games going out in January

[01:01:39] to feel good about the schedule.

[01:01:40] Otherwise, I'd be a little bit worried that it's just going to take too long.

[01:01:46] So there was a NAPS or Kage story.

[01:01:51] And I talked to Jason this week and love Jason NAP.

[01:01:54] I love his page.

[01:01:56] Uh, apparently there was an interview, right?

[01:01:57] But I think Don went to IAPA and interviewed David Fix

[01:02:03] who was told that cup heads are on the line.

[01:02:06] All right.

[01:02:06] I mean, look, if a man's going to say that and he runs the company,

[01:02:12] I can't dispute it.

[01:02:13] I mean, I didn't see a picture of them on the line.

[01:02:16] I have a hard time believing that um, actual

[01:02:21] production has begun of cup head.

[01:02:25] I think knowing the track record of how they talk,

[01:02:32] I would say that having a couple pre-production games being assembled

[01:02:40] is not indicative of a pending launch or a reveal.

[01:02:47] I don't know what window they're waiting for.

[01:02:49] I don't.

[01:02:51] And you know, that's all I'm going to say.

[01:02:53] I, I, I hesitate to talk about this company for obvious reasons.

[01:02:59] I think they're um, I think this is it.

[01:03:03] Like I think they either need to get this game out and into hit

[01:03:07] or there's no, there's no way forward.

[01:03:09] They've, they've put every older game they've had on, on a fire sale.

[01:03:15] And people forgot too that the,

[01:03:18] the signature edition of Galactic Tank Force, people forgot that that game originally was

[01:03:23] priced at $17,500.

[01:03:26] I know people who bought that game for $17,500.

[01:03:32] I think now the sale price is like $12,000 or something or $11,000.

[01:03:35] I don't know.

[01:03:38] Um, yeah, I just um, that's it.

[01:03:41] That's all I'm going to say about American Pimball.

[01:03:44] Uh, has anyone got their multi-morphic,

[01:03:47] Princess Bride Collector's Edition that has the, the swords attached to the cabinet?

[01:03:53] Wasn't that game revealed like a year ago?

[01:03:59] I, I, I see how many games of, I, you know, Jerry's making these kits, but where the games,

[01:04:07] it's really hard to follow some of these like niche boutique companies because it just doesn't

[01:04:12] seem like they've got much movement happening on a production level.

[01:04:19] Speaking about much movement on a production level, I don't know about you, but

[01:04:24] who here even cares about Pope Fiction, Ellie, Eddie Boer? It's just, it's like where is it?

[01:04:29] Where is it?

[01:04:31] I don't, I don't, I don't get anyone who is, is, is still going to go in on it.

[01:04:37] I don't, I don't, I don't know what they were thinking.

[01:04:43] Uh, Twilight Zone remake is coming from them and so is more medieval madness games.

[01:04:50] Chicago gaming company, just again, like another like whatever, Enigma can't get their execution down.

[01:04:59] And I think people are just kind of over it.

[01:05:02] Turner Pimball, do we know when he's going to get those ninja clips is out the door?

[01:05:09] I think Chris is probably going to make it about like, what, like a few a week,

[01:05:14] a handful a week, four a week, make these over a year.

[01:05:19] Been killing it on my Pope Fiction for seven months laughing at Ellie owners waiting. Yeah,

[01:05:24] I know it's, um, it's a semi-exact game. It's his thing too. It's like, I don't,

[01:05:29] there's absolutely, you're not going to have a better experience on Pope Fiction.

[01:05:36] Uh, my garage is heated. It has a heater in the ceiling that I just turned on, but now it's

[01:05:43] comfortable now. I think you can see it. Let's see. That's a heater. This woman did everything great.

[01:05:53] It's cold out there today.

[01:05:58] Um, looking, I, I just want to say, you know, I've been reading Pinside a lot. I've been

[01:06:09] hearing a lot of feedback from people. I've been seeing the, the used market continue to just

[01:06:18] offer up kind of like anything you want. I think it's a buyer's market. I don't think it's a

[01:06:25] seller's market unless you have Metallica Ellie and a few other rare machines. I just think, um,

[01:06:32] I think show of hands gang. How many of you are just starting to

[01:06:37] reevaluate your consumption levels? I want to talk about this for a minute because, you know,

[01:06:43] as it's like Black Friday yesterday and this like stupidity driven over consumption world we live in

[01:06:51] where companies just want you to think you're going to be happier if you buy more of something.

[01:06:58] And stuff you don't need. And I think what's happened a lot for, for people lately is your credit card

[01:07:05] bills are much higher than they've ever been before. Things you used to enjoy doing, the cost of them

[01:07:12] is skyrocketed and it's everything. It's your car insurance, it's your grocery bill, it's your

[01:07:17] at the gas pump. You know, none of us are making 40% higher wages. And I've noticed this. It's like

[01:07:25] the, like the painfulness of inflation of like six years ago, I'm basically making what I'm making

[01:07:32] now. Like marginal increases in wages. And yet if every year, inflation's been around like seven to

[01:07:41] 10% over that period in time, I'm significantly less wealthy than I was back then. And it's led me to

[01:07:53] make a lot of changes in my life. Like first and foremost, I will never walk into a store anymore and

[01:07:59] buy any article of clothing at full retail. I just won't. There's just been an explosion in

[01:08:10] second hand resale, finding friends who work for places that get discounts. And also just

[01:08:17] probably the number one thing I've been doing is just I have enough. I just, I, what more do I need?

[01:08:23] I've got 10 outfits for every occasion. So there's that. Right. So, and then when it comes to pinball,

[01:08:34] I think like a lot of you are probably just really content with your game rooms, with the

[01:08:41] amount of machines you have. You've witnessed a lot of people that you know lose a lot of money

[01:08:49] over the last four years. Games are now being put up for sale, buy manufacturers. The second hand

[01:08:57] loss on prices is is astronomical. The last time we got a, you know, an appropriately priced

[01:09:04] sternally, it was Godzilla, Ellie. Jersey Jack is just priced itself out of the market for the most

[01:09:10] people. There's like, there's a lot of wealthy people in America. There's a lot of people with a

[01:09:15] lot of disposable income. But man, most people can't afford to buy like a pinball machine or two a

[01:09:21] year if they have other expenses and their wages haven't gone up. And you know, we're looking at,

[01:09:28] you know, a super high real estate market, the cost of child care is astronomical, the cost of

[01:09:35] college is astronomical. And just every little thing just chips away. And that's what I've noticed.

[01:09:41] Right. It's not like the big purchases anymore. It's every little thing now is just adding up so

[01:09:49] that when your monthly statement hits, it's like everything is just so much more than you thought

[01:09:57] it would be. And the hardest thing in life is to adjust your lifestyle in relation to the inflation

[01:10:06] of the world. And so that is why, you know, when you ask me like what I'm doing with my money,

[01:10:13] I'm paying this car off instead of getting another pinball machine. The what I owe on this car

[01:10:21] is the same amount that a Jersey Jack C.E. is. So I think I put down like 20 something thousand on it

[01:10:28] and I'm just going to pay it off. So good. Done. No more car payment for this. The demons fully paid for.

[01:10:36] We sold our New York City apartment, fingers crossed. We've got a contract signed.

[01:10:42] All of that is going to go against this mortgage. And then then only then only then will will Brenda and

[01:10:52] myself be back to having much more cash flow a month than debt. Only then until then it's like man,

[01:11:02] buying these pinball machines stupid. But it's hard. It's hard. And you know, the hardest part for a lot of

[01:11:10] people. And I know a lot of you probably think about this is, you know, tomorrow is not always

[01:11:18] going to be as good as today. And how much do I put away for tomorrow? You know, buying all these

[01:11:23] things and overconsuming all these things. I think there's a level of like weird arrogance in pinball

[01:11:32] that will just keep buying regardless of what they price these games at. You know, distributors are

[01:11:39] friends of ours. But I think they think like, I don't know, like the good times just going to keep

[01:11:46] rolling. And I don't know. I don't know. It's also just like when you think about the amount of money

[01:11:51] people have locked into pinball machines, how do some of you not look at, well, I should have just

[01:11:57] bought Netflix stock. If I had just bought Nvidia, if I just, and these aren't like, like if I just bought

[01:12:05] like S&P 500, if I just put my money in better places, you know, as much as we say that pinball

[01:12:09] machines are good investment, it's really not the same way like car people do this. Like my demon

[01:12:14] was not a good investment. It was 86,000. It's probably now worth like a buck 10. It hasn't gone down

[01:12:20] in value. But man, like that's five years ago, if I had invested $90,000 in anything decent,

[01:12:28] I mean, I'd be half a million by now. 300,000 at least. It's just the way it works.

[01:12:38] I think the demon 170 is a stupid car. I think Dodge is bankrupt and I think their new electric EV

[01:12:46] muscle car is going to bomb. I mean, they're, they're, talk about like people think they can just

[01:12:51] charge whatever they want to charge $83,000 for a Dodge with no V8 in it. They want, they want to

[01:13:00] go after the very audience that hates EVs by making an EV muscle car offering no internal combustion

[01:13:10] option. It is going to bomb so hard. It's slower than a Tesla that costs $30,000 less. And it makes no

[01:13:20] sense when you think about it like that. So what was the point? You took away all the visceral

[01:13:25] fun of your product. The only thing that differentiated you was you were, you were ignorant to all the

[01:13:31] EV garbage and you were making fun cars and everyone loves them. And you're going to destroy it

[01:13:38] because you got sold to like with the Lantis. Yeah, they destroyed the company. They destroyed

[01:13:42] Maserati. They destroyed Dodge. It's, it's, they're going to go, they're going to get liquidated.

[01:13:49] And then someone's going to buy Dodge and then go back to the internal combustion. That's what's

[01:13:52] going to happen. Yeah, I mean, the Europeans don't know how to make American muscle cars.

[01:14:02] I feel like Trump should just buy Dodge. Elon Musk could just buy it.

[01:14:05] Yeah, this is a GR86. It's, this is a great car. You like, you, look, I look at this car. I'm like,

[01:14:20] you can have no more fun than this. It weighs 2800 pounds, 220 horses. It, it, it slides around

[01:14:30] the street like a go cart. And it looks cool. It's not a masculating like a meada.

[01:14:39] So like I got the best of both worlds. I got the, I do, I have the best, I feel like I have the

[01:14:44] best cars right now for where I'm at in my life. I've got the Kia Carnival, which I love it as a

[01:14:49] minivan. It's so practical with the kids. It looks great for a minivan. I've got this for just a

[01:14:56] round town. And then I've got like the demon for like, you know, just moments I want to go out and

[01:15:01] just have a crazy thrill. But I'll tell you cars are headaches too. You know, I just want to get

[01:15:12] the brake pads changed out on these because I put ceramic brake pads on it's because I was so sick

[01:15:18] of all the brake dust from the Brembo's. If you have Brembo brakes on your car in stock form,

[01:15:23] they make so much dust. And then I put just these little, I'll show you like splash guards right here.

[01:15:32] Just little splash guards, right? Installed because I had the tires off to do the brake pads.

[01:15:39] Just, I gave them the brake pads. I gave them the splash guards. Just to do that install was like

[01:15:49] almost $300. I'm like, what? Like, it took them over two hours. I'm like, and I was watching them.

[01:15:55] The guys just like walking around the garage. He didn't know what he was doing. Like, I'm like,

[01:16:01] why did, why am I paying for over two hours of service that should have only taken an hour at most?

[01:16:11] Like, they don't want to change brake pads at a tire brake shop.

[01:16:19] I don't know. But again, it's like, you know, it's a pretty specialized skill set and I don't

[01:16:24] know how to do it. And you that's why you pay for it. But, you know, it just when it all adds up.

[01:16:31] So next time you guys want to tell me I can't flip the pinball machine to put a few more

[01:16:35] thousand dollars in my pocket, I'm doing it. I'm doing it. In fact, I'm just going to set it at

[01:16:40] the highest price. Metallica Elite 21,000 firm. How you guys feeling? I went to the gym today

[01:16:49] and I have encouraged each and every one of you. Have you guys been taking care of yourselves?

[01:16:55] Like, forget pinball for a minute. How have you been taking care of yourselves?

[01:17:00] Have you have you guys been working out? Are you, are you getting out there, exercise,

[01:17:08] and three days a week, four days a week? Pretty soon, ozempics going to be a pill, right? When that

[01:17:14] happens, everyone's just popping pills. I see it everywhere, man. It's like that the short cut,

[01:17:22] the lightweight short cut is the multi-billion dollar thing now.

[01:17:30] I mean, people just want to feel good. I guess, you know, who am I to tell them not to do that?

[01:17:36] I think it makes people look a little weird though. Because you get that like ozempic face.

[01:17:41] It just, you start to look like a little zombie. I also just like food too much.

[01:17:49] All right, so Chris Liu wants me to talk about Catwoman Edition. Okay, so we had a nice discussion

[01:17:54] yesterday about Batman 66 and how the, he said the version everybody wants is the Catwoman edition.

[01:18:05] Now, I still argue that like, look, an SLE is going to have the most value because of its

[01:18:09] rarity. But we all know that when Stern first made the L.E.s and the SLEs of Batman, that was when

[01:18:16] they stopped working with Churchill. So the cabinets were crappy. The playfields were crappy. They

[01:18:22] dimpled really bad. They were thinner wood. And apparently, Batman 66, when it was a later run,

[01:18:31] like the Catwoman edition, used better wood. They sort of tweaked the little bit, some of the layout.

[01:18:38] So it shoots much better. And so the most satisfying version of Batman to play is the Catwoman edition.

[01:18:47] So Scott, congrats on losing that five pounds. And so like, Chris was saying that the Catwoman

[01:18:54] edition is super sought after. No, like he's not wrong. There's none available for sale. There's

[01:18:59] none. You can't find a Catwoman edition. Now, I've never liked the Catwoman edition because I don't

[01:19:07] think it looks like a Catwoman edition. Jim, congrats on losing 25 pounds, brother. Keep up the

[01:19:15] good work. My issue with the Catwoman edition is they really didn't go the full Catwoman on it.

[01:19:22] She should be on the cabinet. She's just on the back box and on the translate. They pushed her

[01:19:27] forward. But nothing else about the game screams Catwoman to me. I've been getting to the, let's see.

[01:19:35] I've been getting to the fat the last two years. Like what?

[01:19:41] Man, trying to read some of your guys statements about your weight loss. Look, I think people love

[01:19:46] talking about this stuff too. I think we're all on a personal journey. And you know me, I'm more

[01:19:53] about feeling good than I am about owning more Pimball machines. Batman did another run of premiums

[01:19:59] in 2021 with insider connection. Like I think Batman's going to come back. I think they will do

[01:20:07] another run of Batman. Here's what I think is going to happen. I think Stern's going to put these

[01:20:12] older games on Spike 3 with bigger screens and upgraded sound and upgraded lighting. And I think

[01:20:19] when that happens gang and we start to get like Spike 3 premiums of Batman and Ghost Busters and

[01:20:27] other games, heck, they're going to do Godzilla on Spike 3 eventually. I think, look, I think

[01:20:32] they're going to Spike 3 at all. And I think it's just going to like, you know, it's again,

[01:20:38] it's going to reward those people who are new to the party or those that waited or again, because

[01:20:43] like, you think about it like you're a guy like Chris and you want it, you spend $12,000 on a new

[01:20:51] Batman 66 if you could find one somewhere, but you can't. And there's hundreds of people that

[01:20:58] are in that boat. They just, they can't find the product. And I think when they put these games

[01:21:05] into the new platform, they're easy to port over to the new platform. I think we're going to see a

[01:21:11] lot of that. You know, Batman can sit, you know, continues to be a very polarizing game. I get it,

[01:21:20] I get it. I think it's a game with so much personality though. And I don't know how you can have

[01:21:27] a ton of fun playing Batman. It's just, it is that much fun. I look, I love my guns and roses gang.

[01:21:33] I know people are like, oh, why'd you sell Batman? And my answer is always the same because I got $28,000

[01:21:39] for it. And I bought all of the furniture for this house with Batman's sale. And this house

[01:21:48] brought us so much joy. And I love this home so much. And again, like, it's just brought way more

[01:21:56] smiles to my face than, um, than a Batman would have. And we wake up every day in his house and we

[01:22:03] feel blessed. I hope all you feel the same way about your homes. I really, I feel like your home,

[01:22:09] your family home should bring a level of enthusiasm to you every day. And of course it comes from

[01:22:19] the people inside it and the good vibes. I mean, it's like I feel so good knowing that my children

[01:22:28] are growing up in a household where mom and dad are not arguing with each other. We're not stressed

[01:22:35] about money. We're not just, you know, we're engaged with them. We're, we're, we're, we're, 100% focused on

[01:22:44] our children and, and disciplining them and rewarding them and, and setting boundaries and, and raising

[01:22:52] them to be two gentlemen. I can tell you right now, my children are going to be the Peaky Blinders.

[01:22:57] And much like the Peaky Blinders, I can tell you right now that Killian is going to be Arthur,

[01:23:02] the older brother. He is emotionally like his dad. He's a more of a prima donna. And I can tell

[01:23:08] you right now that Cassian is going to be the Thomas Shelby, the cool, collected boss man who just

[01:23:15] gets it done and always looks out for his older brother. That, that is, I can just see the way they're

[01:23:21] developing now. And it's just so awesome. You got the right idea. Congrats on the, the, yeah. Yeah.

[01:23:30] Thank you. Thank you. WLC. Look, I feel very lucky to have sold the New York City apartment

[01:23:38] in my building in New York City. There were nine apartments for sale, nine, all of which were one

[01:23:44] bedrooms. And so I, you know, I just didn't, I, I don't like the city anymore. Eric Adams has

[01:23:53] destroyed it. All the social movements destroyed New York City. Young people don't go out anymore.

[01:24:00] So the nightlife of New York is not what it used to be. I just saw a report that like college

[01:24:05] kids are having the least amount of sex they've ever had. That more college kids are like leaving

[01:24:09] college as Virgin. I don't, I don't understand man what it would happen to kids. Like when, when I was

[01:24:16] like, I don't, doesn't anyone get like aroused anymore? Like, I don't know. When I was young,

[01:24:22] didn't you try to find any free space you could find with someone you were attracted to?

[01:24:28] And college was just like paradise to, to be outside of, of your parents and any control.

[01:24:37] I don't get it. Yeah, you know, we were talking about that. I bet a lot of these people are,

[01:24:44] especially boys are like the addiction to the modern porn world has got to be, I know my

[01:24:52] hats is porn star, but it's, it's got to be somewhat debilitating though. I bet they look at normal

[01:24:58] intimacy as like unattractive because of what's coming at them. Because when we were kids gang,

[01:25:04] remember like I remember like there was an internet porn like that. Like porn movies still have

[01:25:11] like a storyline at least a little bit, right? And then you know, you had all these like magazines,

[01:25:17] but they were much more just focused on the beautiful figure versus like crazy stuff going on.

[01:25:24] I, yeah, it's all, I don't know, it's all the internet to trash a trash can. It's a dumpster fire

[01:25:30] of what is put into these kids' heads. So I'll do my best as a parent. As all parents can do,

[01:25:38] you can do your best, raise them to have self-esteem. That's, that's my number one goal with my kids.

[01:25:43] I just want to raise them to have self-esteem. If I can achieve that, I will feel good because when

[01:25:50] you have self-esteem, you don't give in the peer pressure, when you have self-esteem, you don't make

[01:25:55] fun of, you don't, you don't care that people make fun of you because you're not going to, you know,

[01:26:00] go along with the crowd. Like when I was in, when I was in high school, I had a lot of self-esteem.

[01:26:05] My parents raised me with a lot of, a lot of confidence to just be myself. Like I didn't do drugs,

[01:26:13] I didn't really drink. I said no to a lot of the social pressures that were around me

[01:26:20] because I fell in love with stuff like automobiles and my dad would say like, hey, look,

[01:26:25] I'll get you a nice car if you promise me you're not going to drink. And, and they was like, yeah,

[01:26:33] sure. And I didn't. You know, I was in sports cars in college when every other kid was in like

[01:26:40] these big Eddie Bauer SUVs, had a little Honda S2000 in college. Eclipse GST was my first car,

[01:26:48] then Subaru STI, then Audi S4, then another STI. You know, then, then, then, figure it, then,

[01:26:57] eventually went, then I went to like the Honda Civic Type-R. We had the, we had a lot of fun cars.

[01:27:08] It's easy to have self-esteem when you're wealthy and white. I disagree with that. Scott,

[01:27:13] I think self-esteem isn't about color or about money. It's not. It's, it's a feeling of self-worth.

[01:27:21] And it's not really, you know, like everyone goes through insecurity, but to raise someone to have

[01:27:28] a point of view on the world that allows them to feel good about who they are, I think it goes

[01:27:36] well past all of that. Like, no one's going to trust me because you're like, well, it's easy for

[01:27:40] you to say because you're white and you, you know, you had some privilege growing up. But I don't

[01:27:45] know. I meet people of all walks of life who have self-esteem and didn't come from money or

[01:27:51] our diverse, have, you know, alternative lifestyles. Yeah, it's an attitude. It absolutely is an

[01:28:00] attitude. I also think it's about, for me, self-esteem, more than an attitude, it's a perspective.

[01:28:07] You know, if you realize how rare it is to even be alive, right, that this earth even exists,

[01:28:17] how everybody who's here is sort of a miracle to the universe and how fortunate most people are,

[01:28:25] just to be where they are, right, and not in a, in a region of war and of turmoil and of extreme

[01:28:34] poverty, it always kills me when I see wealthy kids depressed. You know, I, to me, that's just like,

[01:28:46] how, how did you allow children of such privilege to grow up feeling so

[01:28:55] like ashamed? And I think this is one of the biggest and then gang, I'll let you guys go.

[01:29:00] I think one of the biggest mistakes a lot of people do when they raise children is they,

[01:29:06] they make them feel ashamed of who they are, where they come from, what they have, and they,

[01:29:14] they adopt this weird shame and a apologetic point of view on the world. And then the kids

[01:29:24] sort of live in their own head. You know, they can't get out of their own feelings and they,

[01:29:33] they've closed themselves into this tiny little world. And to me, that like, that's the wrong

[01:29:39] perspective because if you zoom out and see the larger world, you start to realize like, wait a

[01:29:47] minute, like, there's so much more to all of this. It's hard though, because kids, you know,

[01:29:55] kids get very, they get very, very lost in their emotions. We all did. We all still do.

[01:30:06] We all still do. But I also just think there's a, like, there is a little bit of a fallback on

[01:30:11] like mental health now. And I don't know, it just become too much of an excuse for, for people to

[01:30:19] not to develop any grit and any fortitude and any strength. You know, you got it. I remember like

[01:30:27] so much of being young and, and, and learning how to sort of survive in environments where there were

[01:30:39] people bullying me and their, you know, kids would steal my book bag in high school and try to sell

[01:30:45] me my books back. And they would make fun of me because of the town I grew up in and where the

[01:30:52] clothes I had or they would, yeah, there, there was just a lot of like a lot to deal with, right? And

[01:30:59] you, and you knew like your parents couldn't help you. You had to like, develop a way to like, get

[01:31:03] through it. Anyway, all more than I can join Canadian club because it's tuition season only

[01:31:12] feds. Okay. Guys, have a great weekend. This was a fun show. I, I really do appreciate all of you

[01:31:20] who subscribe to Canadian Spinball podcast. I will do a new show probably on Monday. I think it's

[01:31:27] exciting to see how we finish off the year. Then a lot of crazy stuff is going to happen as we get

[01:31:32] towards TPS. So thank you again. And thank you for those of you who have upped your subscriptions.

[01:31:39] We had a few people raise the roof. I really do appreciate it. We're holding steady. We're holding

[01:31:45] steady. You know, my goal was to get to 800 by the end of the year. We're still around like 735

[01:31:51] ish. I thought like 50 of you could gift it to one of your friends who's not a member. I think we

[01:32:00] could still hit that goal. I don't really talk about it much, but you know, because I'm happy

[01:32:04] where I'm at. Like I'm not greedy about it. But it'd be nice to sort of hit that milestone of 800

[01:32:11] over the next four weeks. Just give it, give it to your friend as a gift. You can now, if you're a

[01:32:16] Patreon member, you can gift Canadian Spinball podcast to a friend and watch their look of

[01:32:23] disgust as you give them that gift for the holidays. All right, everybody. Be good. I've been

[01:32:29] doing 100 polyps. Awesome. Okay. Come on, John. I love it. John, you know, you don't work out

[01:32:39] like that. Don't lie to me. All right, later, guys.
