[00:00] Welcome to episode 236 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:23] I'm not the normal voice you would expect to intro this, but figured this morning when

[00:28] I learned that my darling fiancé has been pulled into some sort of a legal battle and

[00:34] has the potential to be sued or something along those lines.

[00:37] I needed to understand what the heck is going on.

[00:41] So as Sunday morning I woke up and I told Brenda that Chris Coularris spelled incorrectly,

[00:48] has been named as a potential defendant in a lawsuit that Andrew Highway is exploring.

[00:55] So here's what we're going to do on episode 236 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:58] We are going to interact Brenda and myself, the interview between Pinball News and Andrew

[01:05] Highway.

[01:06] Brenda will be taking on the role of Martin at Pinball News and will ask the questions

[01:11] and I will be doing my best to play the role of Andrew Highway and I will read his

[01:16] response as how does that sound Brenda?

[01:18] I think this sounds like I'm going to learn a lot.

[01:21] Alright, so let's jump right in and then we're going to discuss what our thoughts are

[01:24] on this entire story after we go through the interview but let's jump right in Brenda.

[01:29] I give you the mic.

[01:31] Cool.

[01:32] So, why are you doing this interview?

[01:34] There are two sides to every story and I have the right to put my side of the story forwards.

[01:40] You've been involved in a number of previous businesses including advertising and racing

[01:44] was Highway Pinball the largest of these?

[01:47] Yes, it was.

[01:50] Are any of the previous businesses still trading?

[01:52] No.

[01:54] What happened to them?

[01:55] Why are they not all successful companies today?

[01:58] What are the biggest lies circulating about me today?

[02:01] Is that I have eight failed companies behind me?

[02:05] When doing research on me, eight previous director or company secretary listings of me are

[02:10] listed, I did not own all of these companies and was not even a shareholder in some of them.

[02:17] If the original researcher had undertaken proper research then they would know that a company

[02:22] posted as dissolved does not mean liquidated.

[02:26] Sometimes companies simply cease trading.

[02:29] If accounts are not filed with companies house in the UK then the companies are naturally

[02:33] dissolved by companies house as a matter of course.

[02:37] There is zero evidence to say that any of these companies were liquidated.

[02:42] The question was why are none of these companies a success or are they even still trading?

[02:48] What I am wondering is, do you have a history of running companies for the short term

[02:52] and then closing them down or are there any long term successes?

[02:56] I have run or been involved in different businesses over the last 28 years since I left school.

[03:02] I was involved in motor racing for a while when that activity ceased.

[03:07] Then there was no need for the company anymore.

[03:09] I was involved in another company as a director and a company secretary but not a shareholder

[03:15] and left when my contract ended.

[03:17] I also lived and worked overseas at various periods when a UK company would no longer be needed.

[03:23] I understand that you are looking for patterns here but there are none.

[03:27] Someone can legitimately run or work in a number of different companies within a 28 year period.

[03:34] Before setting up Highway Pinball, have you ever managed a team of employees before?

[03:38] Yes, both in businesses I have run and in businesses in which I was employed.

[03:44] Do you think you were up to the task of managing that many employees?

[03:48] Yes, I do.

[03:49] But circumstances made this more difficult as time went on.

[03:53] Do you consider yourself an honest man?

[03:55] Yes, I do.

[03:56] I have to live with myself and my own values.

[04:01] How do you reconcile that with making so many promises about people's games or replacement parts being delivered?

[04:08] Often to their face at pinball shows and then not fulfilling those promises,

[04:13] knowing you wouldn't be delivering on them.

[04:16] Your assumption is that I knew we couldn't deliver on our or my promises.

[04:21] We always prioritize sending out replacement parts.

[04:24] Delays sometimes occurred because we had to wait for replacement parts to be built or delivered.

[04:29] Replacing populated playfields was nearly impossible in the early stages of production.

[04:35] What people should understand is that every time we thought we had overcome one problem,

[04:39] then other problems occurred and led to more delays.

[04:43] In hindsight, I was often overly optimistic with our timelines and so I understand why people feel

[04:49] that I lied to them.

[04:50] But I honestly never intentionally misled customers.

[04:53] I did my best to keep my promises but often fell short.

[04:57] I absolutely did not live up to my own expectations of myself,

[05:01] but I never intentionally lied to customers either.

[05:04] In hindsight, we absolutely did not have the resources to be the company that I wanted.

[05:10] Our customer service is technical support, quality control, and electronics departments

[05:15] all suffered from underfunding compared to our rivals.

[05:18] Our technical platform was pitched very high but was too much for a company of our limited

[05:24] resources. hindsight teaches us a lot.

[05:28] Did you really believe you would ship games in that time scale you've stated?

[05:32] Despite everyone, even the game designer, telling you those dates were ridiculous?

[05:38] Why did you not listen to what everyone was telling you?

[05:40] Yes, I did believe it.

[05:42] But as each week went by, the mountain of tasks got bigger and bigger.

[05:46] In hindsight, I vastly underestimated what it would take to build a world-class game.

[05:51] But the biggest killers for us were the technical and supplier problems

[05:55] that we suffered and our lack of resources meant it took us much longer to fix problems

[06:00] that it should have done.

[06:02] There seemed to be a trail of dissatisfied and disgruntled people who have worked with you or

[06:07] for you or had business dealings with you in the past.

[06:11] Every time I have told someone I'm sharing a room with you at a show, I always got the same reaction.

[06:16] Good luck getting him to pay his share.

[06:19] Why does nobody seem to have a good word to say?

[06:22] It is human nature to put down someone in my position.

[06:26] Also, in this social media age, everyone has an opinion.

[06:31] Ex-employees are ex-employees for a reason.

[06:34] If someone gets fired, for example, do you expect them to have good things to say?

[06:38] As a pinball dealer, I traded hundreds of pinball machines, and most of those transactions

[06:43] went smoothly and without problem.

[06:45] Also, people love to jump on the bandwagon and see other people criticizing me

[06:50] and want to join in.

[06:52] But one of my characteristics is that I'm a fighter, and I fought for five long years to keep

[06:58] the company alive and achieve its goals.

[07:00] Sometimes, when you fight so hard, you make enemies.

[07:04] I'll end this point by asking you a question.

[07:06] We shared a room on quite a few occasions over the last six years.

[07:10] Do I owe you any money for any of these rooms?

[07:14] Did I honor my commitment to pay my share of the room at Expo 2017

[07:18] when I didn't even attend the event?

[07:20] We both know the answers.

[07:21] We both know the answers, yes, to those questions.

[07:24] You also seem to have a history of not paying people or suppliers,

[07:28] or only paying them when absolutely forced to,

[07:31] such as before being taken to court.

[07:33] Is there an ethical way?

[07:35] Is this an ethical way to operate?

[07:37] No, it isn't.

[07:38] But as I said in my previous answer,

[07:39] sometimes you have to fight for survival,

[07:42] owning a business is often about juggling,

[07:44] and many times you have to prioritize certain payments over others.

[07:48] A well-funded company doesn't have to fight so hard.

[07:51] This was one of our biggest shortfalls.

[07:53] Hmm.

[07:54] Was the continued survival of Highway Pimble,

[07:56] the number one priority for you during the time in charge,

[08:01] overriding all other considerations?

[08:03] Absolutely.

[08:04] The survival of the company and everyone,

[08:06] everything directly associated with it,

[08:08] was always the number one priority.

[08:10] There are many people who can vouch that I regularly went over the edge

[08:14] and beyond the call of duty to keep the company alive.

[08:18] Some have suggested that I didn't care about the business,

[08:21] and this is simply ridiculous.

[08:22] My passionate commitment were there for everyone to see.

[08:26] I put the company ahead of every aspect of my life,

[08:29] including my health.

[08:31] As many will tell you,

[08:32] I have been unsuccessfully battling diabetes for years now,

[08:35] and it was impossible to set aside any time for my help.

[08:38] But I cared about every single customer of the company,

[08:41] and was determined that every paying customer would receive their paid for gain,

[08:45] or refund.

[08:46] I departed the company because the investor group promised

[08:49] it would happen and had no other option but to leave.

[08:53] Nothing was more important.

[08:55] Nothing was more important.

[08:56] Employee wages were always the first priority.

[09:00] The original first game was...

[09:02] Cersei's.

[09:03] Cersei's Animal House.

[09:05] A party-themed mix with ancient Greek mythology,

[09:09] eventually after several showings,

[09:10] you accepted that it was a more poor theme choice,

[09:13] and ultimately picked a love of yours,

[09:16] motorcycle racing, as a good replacement theme.

[09:19] Do you think this was a wise decision,

[09:21] given a subsequent sales number?

[09:23] This wasn't the driving factor behind this theme change.

[09:26] The speed of the gameplay pushed the theme towards something fast.

[09:30] Motor racing, or car-themed games,

[09:32] had been coveted,

[09:34] or covered extensively by our competitors over the years.

[09:37] Motorcycle racing had barely been covered

[09:39] over the last few decades,

[09:40] and this is why it was chosen.

[09:41] Ultimately, it was my belief that unlicensed games

[09:44] generally sell very poorly compared to licensed games,

[09:48] and full throttle was up again strong licensed games

[09:50] from our competitors at the time.

[09:52] Many pro-pimball players and actual game owners

[09:55] love the game.

[09:57] Dave Sanders and I had big arguments over the theme of the game.

[10:00] Ultimately, we listened to the opinions and advice

[10:03] of two world-class pinball designers

[10:05] and changed the theme from Cersei.

[10:09] Why did you insist playboy was a good idea for a theme?

[10:14] When everyone was telling you it was misogynistic,

[10:16] outdated, and potentially downright offensive in this day and age.

[10:20] It was always my intention to cover a broad spectrum of themes

[10:23] for our future pinball titles.

[10:25] I was personally fed up with the endless stream of superhero theme games

[10:29] and games targeted at children.

[10:31] I also have a personal dislike for adults being treated like children in general,

[10:36] and I wanted an adult theme where groups of adults could play a game

[10:40] that was more relevant to them.

[10:42] Bali released one playboy game,

[10:44] Dada East another, and Stern one more again,

[10:47] and these were at times when playboy as a brand

[10:49] was far more controversial than it is today.

[10:52] Playboy as a brand and pinball as an activity

[10:56] have their paths in history intertwined.

[10:59] I believe there would be a popular game

[11:01] choice amongst adults.

[11:04] This appears to be part of a pattern of everyone telling you

[11:07] something is about idea,

[11:08] and then you ignoring them and doing it anyway.

[11:10] Do you think you welcome others' opinions and listen to them?

[11:14] Many of these patterns you are talking about concern x employees,

[11:18] and as I've previously said, many are x for a reason.

[11:21] I believe that I often welcomed other opinions.

[11:24] For example, we had endless meetings about alien,

[11:27] and many team members had direct input into the game

[11:30] and how it turned out.

[11:31] This would not have happened if I controlled every aspect

[11:34] and every decision without council as you have suggested.

[11:38] Did you pay yourself a salary at Highway Pinball?

[11:41] Yes.

[11:41] Hey, what was that?

[11:43] In year four, it was 40,000 pounds for the year,

[11:46] and in year five, it was 45,000.

[11:49] However, in reality, the actual figure amount

[11:52] to approximately 25,000 of 30,000 pounds each year

[11:55] has put a substantial amount of money back into the company

[11:59] via personal loans I took out for the company.

[12:02] Proceeds from selling pinball games in my own personal collection,

[12:06] funds for my personal bank account,

[12:07] and funds for my personal credit cards,

[12:09] often I would even pay for wages and parts

[12:13] for my personal bank account and credit cards.

[12:15] Before my shares were sold to the investor group,

[12:18] the company personally owed me an excess of 54,000 pounds.

[12:23] All of these claims can be verified by the company's accountants.

[12:27] What personal benefits did the company pay for?

[12:29] Car, house, living expenses, loans, storage,

[12:33] the purchase, rental or leasing of any equipment,

[12:36] not directly related to the design and manufacture

[12:38] of Highway Pinball machines?

[12:39] In general, most items listed above were part of my salary package and wage.

[12:43] There was also a degree of consolidation at the end of each accounting year

[12:47] by the company's accountants.

[12:49] As professional accountants, they have a legal responsibility

[12:51] to report the exact situation of the company,

[12:54] including my own personal affairs relating to the company.

[12:57] Could you clarify that?

[12:58] Are you saying those listed expenses came out of your salary

[13:02] or that they were additional to that salary of 40,000

[13:06] or 45,000 pounds?

[13:08] The listed expenses where applicable

[13:11] would be consolidated as part of my salary package

[13:14] and director's loan account balance.

[13:17] Who gets to see these accounts?

[13:19] Company accounts get submitted to the company's house as

[13:22] per normal rules.

[13:24] Did you pay all of your employees a salary too?

[13:26] This is a strange question.

[13:28] All employees were paid salaries and all salaries were logged

[13:31] with and calculated by the company's accountants.

[13:34] Who at the company didn't you pay a salary too and why?

[13:38] Contractors were paid retainers and not salaries.

[13:41] Dave Sanders, for his own reasons,

[13:43] chose to work for the company on a voluntary basis.

[13:46] I know that is a widely discussed and controversial topic

[13:49] and so I will address it in detail.

[13:52] Dave and I have been friends for nearly nine years.

[13:54] Dave shared the company dream from the very beginning.

[13:57] At the start, Dave had the option to be directly involved

[14:01] with the company, including shares and he declined.

[14:05] In 2015, I told Dave that the company's finances were much

[14:08] healthier and asked him if he would consider

[14:10] becoming a paid employee.

[14:11] Again, Dave declined.

[14:13] Dave has certain personal reasons why he declined.

[14:16] But I'm not breaking any competences by stating that Dave

[14:18] had his own reasons for doing everything on a voluntary basis.

[14:22] One big reason that I can discuss is that Dave wanted the freedom

[14:26] to come and go as he pleased.

[14:27] With no set working days or working hours as an employee would have,

[14:31] Dave always preferred working from home and when he did visit the factory,

[14:35] he would often be found playing pinball games on the factory floor.

[14:38] Of course, Dave wasn't going to do all of this for nothing

[14:41] but he wanted to be paid retrospective royalties

[14:44] for his design work in the future.

[14:46] Dave had his own reasons for wanting this in no way

[14:50] can I be accused of manipulating Dave or taking advantage of him.

[14:53] What was I supposed to do?

[14:54] Forced Dave to take a salary.

[14:56] Dave and I have had a number of discussions about his future contract

[15:00] and it's true.

[15:01] We had our own disagreements about this.

[15:03] My personal preference was that part of such a package

[15:06] was see Dave become a shareholder in the company.

[15:08] Dave preferred to have higher royalties instead

[15:10] between April through June of 2017.

[15:13] Both Dave and I agreed that it would be more prudent for his contract

[15:16] to be finalized with the new owners of the company,

[15:19] such a deal, proceed it.

[15:20] Dave is a very nice guy and his heart is absolutely in the right place.

[15:24] I also completely understand his anger and dismay about the situation

[15:27] but I believe his anger should be directed at the investor group.

[15:30] Dave told me approximately a month ago that he had signed a contract

[15:33] previously with the investor group and he seemed very happy about this.

[15:37] Dave did not discuss any details of this contract with me.

[15:40] I've heard reports that Dave is now suffering financially as a result of his contract breach.

[15:45] If this is true then this is grossly unfair.

[15:48] The question needs to be seriously asked

[15:49] is to whether the investor group led Dave on with a false contract

[15:52] when it would appear that they had every intention of closing the company down

[15:56] once the alien license had expired.

[15:58] Even though Dave appears to be blaming me online for the situation

[16:02] I feel very bad for Dave that he has been put into this situation.

[16:06] Dave does not deserve this treatment on any level.

[16:09] What did you personally get out selling your stake in highway pimbol?

[16:12] This matter is covered by a legally binding confidentiality clause

[16:16] and therefore I cannot comment on this.

[16:19] Are you personally being chased for any outstanding debt from your time at highway pimbol?

[16:24] Yes considerably so. I am being chased for a large sum of money

[16:27] I was personally guarantor on many loan and finance deals taken out for the company.

[16:32] The investor group accepted the responsibility of changing guarantees

[16:36] over to themselves but ultimately refused to do this.

[16:40] They knew full well that this chain of events would happen

[16:42] and I believe that it was part of their overall plan.

[16:45] I expect to suffer to the tune of at least 25 to 30,000 pounds from this liquidation.

[16:51] Maybe more.

[16:52] When you left highway pimbol what was your understanding about what was to happen

[16:57] with the company and what changes the investment group would make?

[17:00] I never wanted to leave the company.

[17:02] I was pursuing other financial solutions for the company

[17:05] but I didn't have the time to see these through.

[17:07] The investor group made clear that they were prepared to put considerable funds into the

[17:12] company to save everyone involved but that I was to depart the company so they could assume control.

[17:17] I cannot discuss any details of my departure from the company

[17:21] as they are covered under a confidentiality clause.

[17:24] It has been suggested that I duped or misled the investor group

[17:27] but I can categorically deny this.

[17:30] One of the duties that is legally required of any purchaser of a majority shareholder

[17:34] in a UK company is that they must perform due diligence on their proposed investment.

[17:39] What would you consider to be a reasonable period of due diligence for five allegedly wealthy

[17:44] and successful businessmen one day, one week, one month?

[17:48] They're due diligence period lasted for three months.

[17:51] During this time they spoke to every employee, contractor, supplier, and distributor in great length.

[17:57] They were regularly in the factory during these three months and spent a huge amount of time

[18:02] understanding every aspect of how the business worked, including every aspect of the technical

[18:06] setup of the company's games.

[18:09] The investor group also went public with their intentions and told everyone that they would make

[18:13] sure that all customers would receive their games and refunds.

[18:17] If this is true, then why?

[18:18] Once the deal to purchase my shares had been completed,

[18:21] then the investor group formed a brand new company called Pimball Brothers,

[18:25] allegedly run all parts purchasing and new sales through this company and transfer all of the

[18:29] highway Pimball's intellectual property into their new company.

[18:32] As reported to me on Thursday, May 3rd, 2018, by MB Insolvency, the company

[18:39] handling the insolvency of highway Pimball, it would appear that the company was assets stripped

[18:43] at an early stage and by the end of April 2018, few assets remain to liquidate for any customers,

[18:49] creditors of highway Pimball limited.

[18:51] It has been reported that the investor group has exported all company parts back to Europe.

[18:57] Does this seem fair to customers?

[18:58] It has also been reported that the investor group shipped a number of finished alien

[19:02] games to Europe to secretly sell to new customers.

[19:05] Why are these games not being delivered to customers of highway Pimball who paid for their games

[19:09] a long time ago?

[19:11] The truth would appear to be that they always had every intention of closing the company down

[19:15] once the alien license had expired and had no intention of sending existing customers

[19:20] their games or issuing them with any refunds.

[19:23] It appears that they did the bare minimum to drag the company through to April 2018

[19:28] before liquidating it.

[19:30] Also, let me refer back to Dave Seniors again.

[19:33] It was Dave that designed full throttle and alien and apparently took over design of queen

[19:37] and other games.

[19:38] I believe that Dave is the legal owner of the design rights to these games and as such,

[19:42] he should take legal advice on any action he can take against the investor group,

[19:47] including the recovery of any games that they may be trying to sell in Europe.

[19:50] Quite simply, I question whether Pimball Brothers actually owns any of the design rights to

[19:55] any of highway Pimball's games.

[19:57] Let me finish this point by being 100% clear again.

[20:00] I did not want to depart from the company.

[20:02] I wanted to stay and honor the company's commitment to every single customer

[20:06] to ensure they received their games and for the company to thrive in the future.

[20:11] When faced with only one option for the company to continue and survive,

[20:14] I sold my stay to investors who promised they would honor these commitments.

[20:18] But only if I'd departed the company.

[20:20] If you were faced with such a decision, wouldn't you do the same?

[20:24] You do know there is a go for me campaign,

[20:26] set up to help Dave pay his living expenses.

[20:29] How does that make you feel?

[20:30] I feel absolutely gutted that Dave has been put in this position by the investor group.

[20:34] For the reasons I stated previously, it appears he was given a false contract by the investor group

[20:39] and undertook work for them.

[20:41] On the basis of this contract, even though they apparently planned all along to close down the

[20:46] company and invalidate his contract, Dave really needs to take legal action on what his options are

[20:51] and I would be more than willing to assist Dave if he wants my help.

[20:55] What did you know about the Pimbal Brothers Company?

[20:58] And when did you first know about them?

[21:00] I was told about the pending insolvency by a smaller investor a few days before it was revealed

[21:06] to the public. I heard about the existence of Pimbal Brothers the day before news broke online

[21:11] about the insolvency. I first spoke to the insolvency company handling this business,

[21:15] MB Insolvency, on Thursday, May 3rd 2018. Mark Hunt told me that the assets of the business

[21:22] were stripped a long time ago and were now owned by Pimbal Brothers. This is sound like a fair deal

[21:27] to customers and creditors of the company. I also have been told that the investor group had

[21:32] disposed of two Pimbal machines that belonged to a finance company, a walking dead Ellie and a

[21:37] wizard of Oz, standard edition. I'm waiting to hear from the finance company as to whether they wish

[21:43] to involve the police in this matter. I still can't believe that they have done what they have done.

[21:48] Do you think Highway Pimbal was in good shape when you sold her steak?

[21:52] Our serious problem started in Pimbal Expo 2016 and I believe that sabotage played a big part

[21:58] in the company's problems. There were some people in the Pimbal industry who were very threatened

[22:02] by alien and how it could harm their own game sales. Does this claim sound far fetched?

[22:08] Here are some facts for you. This is a chain of events that began at Pimbal Expo.

[22:13] Number one, company tools and electronics were stolen from Highway Pimbal's stand in the main

[22:18] exhibition hall at the Weston Hotel. Number two, on announcing the state of full throttle

[22:24] production at Expo, a fraud campaign was launched against Highway Pimbal customers.

[22:28] This was a planned and targeted campaign. Customers were told to pay Highway Pimbal bank

[22:33] accounts and send spent show instructions on how to do so. These were fraudulent bank accounts,

[22:38] each one with a different bank account number for each customer. Confidence in our payment system

[22:43] was decimated as we were originally wrote to all customers telling them not to make any payments

[22:49] to accounts reporting or reporting to be ours. Two customers were calmed and paid over 12,000 euros

[22:55] to these fraudulent accounts. I spent many hours in Chicago on the phone to the UK police,

[23:00] the serious fraud office and the individual banks in question. The planning of this fraud campaign

[23:05] was meticulous and its timing was planned and targeted. Three, significant online campaigns were

[23:12] launched to defame the company and myself personally, advice is being taken on possible legal action.

[23:17] The online campaign against the company was so bad that the likes of Owen Clipsham,

[23:22] rubber ducks on Pinside, wrote directly to Highway Pimbal customers trying to convince them

[23:28] to cancel their orders and get refunds. I have proof about this and I'm seeking legal advice about

[23:32] this matter. These events led to mass customer cancellations that a company of our size and in our

[23:38] position was not able to deal with. The situation deteriorated to the point where more funds were

[23:43] needed or the company would not have to close. Why do you think that the business is liquidated

[23:49] just nine months after you left? I believe that the investor group had no intention of honoring any

[23:54] of its financial commitments and that they have every intention of assets stripping the company

[23:59] and liquidating the following end of the alien license. The investor group who took over the

[24:05] running of Highway Pimbal are saying that they didn't realize the true state of the company's

[24:10] finances and operational problems that you hid a number of liabilities and that the actual

[24:15] situation they found was so bad that they could not continue losing money. What do you think about

[24:21] that as an explanation to the liquidation? As mentioned previously, the investor group conducted a

[24:27] thorough audit of the company over three month period and therefore conducted their due diligence

[24:32] which they are legally bound to undertake. The company's accountants, whole documents that

[24:36] prove the extensive statements I have officially made to the investor group about the state of the

[24:40] company and its dealings. The investor group absolutely knew what they were getting into. I am

[24:44] sure the most intelligent people will understand what really happened when they understand a situation

[24:49] story behind Pimbal brothers. During your tenure as head of the company, your use of language appeared

[24:55] almost deliberately misleading at times, saying for instance that a title was shipping when in reality

[25:01] you might have only sent one out out incomplete or a prototype game to a distributor or to a show.

[25:06] Was it your intention to mislead and if so to what end? To bring in more orders and more money?

[25:12] I think I have already discussed this point in detail previously. Even when the game was deemed

[25:17] to be ready and I was confident of making such claims, a new bombshell, often technical, would delay

[25:23] matters further. I never set out to mislead anyone. What can you do or say to all those people who

[25:30] paid money to you for games they never received and are now never likely to receive? I deeply regret

[25:35] this situation. I did my very best and understand that I fell short of most people's expectations. I

[25:41] sold the company in good faith and the full belief that everyone would receive their games or refunds.

[25:46] I believe the promises of the investor group like everyone else did. The end result is nothing

[25:51] short of shameful. If you were a customer who prepaid and never received a game, what would you do?

[25:57] I would be asking serious questions of the investor group and how they apparently mislead everyone

[26:02] for the reasons I have stated in this interview. In hindsight, I very much regret that we took

[26:07] pre-orders for alien. I knew many of the company's customers personally. We met at Pimbal shows,

[26:12] drank beers, laughed, and shared our passion of Pimbal together. My name was in the company name.

[26:17] I was proud of what we were doing and wanted everyone to receive and enjoy our games. I can only

[26:22] feel ashamed and disappointed by the end result. You had a large following on social media, both

[26:27] highly supportive and actively hostile with everything in between. How did comments on social media

[26:32] impact the business? Both your comments and those of others? They had a huge impact on the business.

[26:38] I managed the situation as best as I could in an ever more difficult circumstances. The actions

[26:43] of a few people such as Owen, Clipsham, Rubberducks, and Chris, Kuleris, Canada directly contributed to

[26:51] customer cancellations and what has turned a run on the bank. I'm currently seeking legal advice

[26:57] against both individuals. They weren't the only ones. There were plenty of other people who did

[27:01] their best to make customers cancel their orders. I also accept that my unrealistic timeframes impacted

[27:08] negatively on the business. Do you think any of the negativity was justified? I think that the

[27:13] negative comments from paying customers is absolutely justified. There is no excuse for customers not

[27:18] receiving their games or refunds. What would you do differently on social media if you could go back?

[27:23] I would not have taken any pre-orders and I would have greatly overestimated, not underestimated,

[27:29] my timelines and announcements. Where did the money to buy the curl, curl, hydrofoil come from?

[27:36] No company funds were used to purchase any hydrofoils.

[27:39] Can you guarantee that none of the highway, pinball investors, or pre-order money was spent on the

[27:44] curl curl? Or to help fund your hydrofoil adventure? Yes, absolutely. No funds relating to investors

[27:52] or the company were used in this venture. Was it just a coincidence then? Coincidence then,

[27:57] that you registered a new company for the hydrofoil in the same week. You told alien buyers that

[28:02] the game was ready to ship and they could send in their final payments September 2016.

[28:07] Yes, it was a coincidence. The company's formation cost less than 50 pounds and I simply wanted to

[28:14] protect the company name for a possible future business venture. The company was predominantly dormant

[28:19] and unused until I departed highway pinball in June of 2017. This claim can be confirmed by official

[28:24] company filings. Do you think the fallout from the highway pinball situation will damage your plans

[28:29] for the curl curl? I am sure there are people who would like me to disappear completely and not

[28:34] engage in any future activity of any kind. When the investor group made their investments in

[28:39] highway pinball, what changes did they demand and return for that investment? Other than my

[28:44] forced departure from the company, I cannot comment on the specifics of my departure for legal

[28:48] reasons. Before the investor group became involved, was the company highway pinball, the one and only

[28:54] business involved in the making of your games, or were there any subsidiaries, sisters, or related

[28:58] businesses with any financial involvement? I was advised in an early stage to set up a separate

[29:03] company so the sales and manufacturing could be kept separate. For this reason, highway pinball

[29:08] sales limited was formed. However, the separation never gathered any steam and most of the business

[29:12] activities remained with the main company highway pinball limited. No intellectual property

[29:17] assets ever changed hands between these companies. Therefore, to answer your question,

[29:21] other than there's one technical exception, all businesses relating to the making of the games

[29:26] were handled by highway pinball limited until my departure in June 2017.

[29:31] Was the highway pinball company the same business you began rather earlier when based in Ireland?

[29:35] I was trading personally as highway pinball when I was living in Ireland. Yes, the business

[29:40] only became a private limited company when I moved back to the UK in 2012.

[29:44] How much of the manufacturing equipment was owned by the company and how much was least borrowed

[29:49] or on any other kind of finance? A lot of the equipment was obtained through higher

[29:53] purchase and lease purchase agreements. Some equipment was purchased outright and finance

[29:57] retrospectively. Some equipment was owned by the company outright when I departed the company.

[30:02] If present presented with an asset list by the liquidator, then I can comment on the specifics

[30:07] and what equipment I believe should be owned directly by the company. Was highway pinball

[30:12] money used for anything other than the operating expenses and stock purchasing? Was it, for instance,

[30:17] used to help fund the UK pinball parity shows or buy or lease pinball or arcade machines?

[30:23] I believe that I've answered most of these questions previously. The UK pinball

[30:26] party was used as a promotional vehicle by highway pinball, often for new announcements and product

[30:31] launches and did contribute some sponsorship funds accordingly to the show. How many full

[30:36] total and alien machines were purchased? For legal reasons, I will not answer this question.

[30:43] Why is releasing this information a problem? It will be useful for the IPDB to have complete

[30:49] production details for both games. As I have had no involvement with the company since June of

[30:54] 2017, I have no information as to how many alien games were produced following my departure.

[31:00] In any case, I am unsure of the legality pertaining to disclosure of this information.

[31:04] Therefore, I will not comment further. Sorry. How's the license for alien now expired?

[31:09] I have not had any involvement in running the company since June of 2017. I have heard the rumors

[31:14] that it was not renewed. You will have to seek confirmation from the investor group.

[31:18] It was due to expire at the end of December 2017, right? I am not commenting on this specifically.

[31:23] You would seem to be well informed. Can any existing alien machines still be sold by pinball

[31:29] brothers or whoever now has the remaining stock? If the license has indeed inspired,

[31:34] then I believe the answer is no. I am sure Fox would be very angry to hear that games were being sold

[31:39] after the expiration of this license. If I was Dave Sanders, for reasons I have discussed earlier,

[31:45] I would be taking legal advice to pertaining to the ownership of the game designs.

[31:49] Was the queen license in the name of highway pinball? If so, do you believe it was transferable

[31:54] to another company? A good question. And one that I cannot answer for legal reasons,

[31:58] it would be easy for someone to find out this information.

[32:02] It seems odd you can't comment. Where might one look to find out such information?

[32:07] It is common public knowledge that bravado agency handles most affairs for queen.

[32:12] You are very keen on the use of non-disclosure agreements or NDAs to prevent people talking about

[32:18] business critical matters such as licenses, designer, or finances. Now you are not running the

[32:23] company and it is about to be liquidated. Do you release these people under NDA from them?

[32:29] NDAs are legal documents that I would assume would remain legally binding. What is the point

[32:33] of having an NDA if everyone wants to break them? Sadly, many people will post matters anonymously,

[32:39] even though they have signed NDAs or simply break the terms of the NDA anyway. These are cowardly

[32:44] acts in my opinion. The NDAs would have been contracts between the individuals and either

[32:50] highway pinball or you personally, once highway pinball ceases to exist. Those contracts with

[32:54] highway pinball would become void as there is no company to which reputational or financial

[32:59] harm could be done. You could say that as far as you are concerned, anyone under an NDA is released

[33:05] from it. They will be able to be in a position to confirm any of your points. You are making a

[33:10] number of assumptions here. What if a third party was to purchase the company from the liquidators?

[33:15] What if the company's IP that has been allegedly transferred over to pinball brothers include a

[33:19] transfer of confidentiality agreements? Therefore, I have nothing further to add. Can you ever see yourself

[33:24] being involved in the pinball business in any way ever again? No, even if I wanted to, to most

[33:30] people, the truth is unimportant. The accusations against me will stay. Looking back at everything that

[33:35] has happened. What lessons to have you learned about starting a pinball business? And probably more

[33:39] importantly, what would you do differently if you could go back and start again? A lot more capital

[33:44] investment, simpler game features, no pre-orders, and realistic timelines expectations.

[33:50] You said in your post on Pinside that you would defend your integrity. How do you think your integrity

[33:54] stands after this whole episode? Something said about me are true. I accept my responsibilities, but

[34:01] I have also been a lot of lies about me. Many people criticize the UK pinball community and it's true.

[34:06] There is a lot of toxicity in that community. I gave a lot to the UK pinball community over the

[34:11] last 15 years and personally, feel betrayed by many of them. With some notable exceptions,

[34:17] I never felt there was any real support from the UK community for what our company was trying to do.

[34:23] On the flip side, I love dealing with everyone at the US shows. There are a lot of knowledgeable

[34:28] pinball fans in the States and it was a pleasure to meet so many enthusiastic pinball folk.

[34:32] I made a lot of good friends in the USA and thanked them for all their support over the last year

[34:37] in the last few weeks in particular. His name is Hilton. Whatever the facts are, my reputation and

[34:42] integrity have been destroyed by the many accusations against me. Once it no longer exists as a

[34:48] company, what do you think highway pinballs lasting legacy will be? Do you think it will be remembered

[34:53] in a positive light? Because of recent events in the last year, in particular, the answer is a clear

[34:59] no. But take a look at the game's company produce. Bacardi Baffable, a quality game,

[35:06] any huge success for Bacardi. Full throttle, critically acclaimed by some of the best pinball players

[35:12] on the planet, Hilton, if not a commercial success. Alien pinball, look at the depth of this game.

[35:19] This is not a game that was born and appeared overnight. It took years to develop a world-beating game.

[35:25] Time equals money. Technical delays equal money. Speak to customers of highway pinball games.

[35:30] Many have had technical problems, but there are also many customers games that are fully working.

[35:35] Many will tell you how well built the games are, how solid they are, how technically superior they

[35:40] are to our rivals games. All this technology needs time to invent and time to develop and time to

[35:47] nurture. Some of our biggest challenges were the hardware and software systems,

[35:51] Roman Fontaine, who was a great technical director. Bubba. Bubba, you don't Roman Fontaine.

[35:59] There's bubbles over this. Bubba is like, it's been taking a week too long. I think Bubba is like

[36:03] the lawyer for Roman Fontaine. The second he heard that name, he just went nuts. Let's jump back in.

[36:10] Roman Fontaine, like we're looking at Bubba, who was the great technical director, couldn't even fix

[36:15] the problems with Iow boards that he designed. In the eight months before he left the company,

[36:20] we took on too much technically. I absolutely accept that. The company also had huge supplier problems.

[36:27] In particular, there were huge problems with the playfields from our supplier. In wooden shipment,

[36:31] more than 90% of the playfields were rejected by us. It caused the company massive problems in delays.

[36:37] The multiple software and hardware problems that every turn led to more and more delays.

[36:42] It was a very difficult situation to manage. With hindsight, we needed much greater resources and

[36:48] more key technical staff to truly fix the game's technical issues. It is also my personal opinion

[36:53] that the investor group did not hire the correct personnel to overcome the outstanding technical

[36:58] issues. Without hiring an experienced technical director, then nobody was truly qualified to understand

[37:04] the technical issues and most importantly, fix them. But the fact remains that customers were owed

[37:10] money at the end. That is not acceptable on any level. What will you do now?

[37:16] The investor group Pimbo Brothers have done a great job in deflecting the blame about this

[37:21] sorry situation to me. Whilst apparently running away from all the debts and responsibilities,

[37:26] and taking all of the main highway Pimbo assets with them, have they even publicly apologize for

[37:32] any of this? This is a witch hunt now. In angry mob with their pitchforks where the truth,

[37:38] or my side of the story doesn't seem to matter, many people will comment that I am now a wealthy

[37:43] individual. The opposite is true and I will personally prove to you if necessary that I am heavily in debt.

[37:49] Personal threats have been made against me and my home address has even been posted online by

[37:54] foreign members. I think the safety and security of my family is my main priority now.

[37:59] I think that's it. I think we're at... oh hold on, wait.

[38:08] In addition to the points raised during this interview, there have been many accusations made

[38:12] against Andrew and various online forums concerning his governance of highway Pimbo's finances

[38:17] and his personal interactions with former employees are contractors. Rather than address them all

[38:22] one by one in an interview, Andrew requests the opportunity to address these claims

[38:25] any separate statements below. All right so guys I'm not going to read all this. I want to

[38:30] I want to pick out some stuff that was interesting. Alien Pimbo, Orrick Lawson did a great job

[38:38] with the alien artwork given the limited resources given to us by Fox. Brian Allen was brought on board

[38:44] because Orrick Lawson's Ellie Backlast wasn't good enough. I held a public vote at a Pimbo show

[38:50] and he had run out of ideas by then. Brian did an amazing job with the Ellie Backlast art that

[38:55] luckily Fox also liked. The Famitorian libelist slanners comments have been made about me by the

[39:01] likes of Owen Clipschim, Phil Palmer, Owen, Owen, Owen, Owen Meadows, Chris Cularis spelled wrong

[39:09] and a number of other people. Many of these people have their own agendas and well informed people

[39:13] know this. I never bought a Porsche, never bought new Porsche, a new mini, swing pools or tropical

[39:19] islands and has been alleged. I did drive a 12 year old Porsche that I sold in 2017 for 6500 pounds.

[39:25] I no longer own the car. Thank you to the many amazing people I met and work within this

[39:30] industry hobby. I leave the industry with great sadness that I was unable to complete my mission

[39:35] in Pimbo and also deep sorrow that some customers did not receive their games and refunds from a

[39:40] company that I had my name in the title. All right so Brenda that concludes the interview. Thank

[39:48] you for sticking it out. I know that was a lot to read and process. So now you're pretty much

[39:53] up to speed with where we're at. You saw me accuse as being one of the people that was on a mission

[39:59] to sabotage the company. What are your thoughts? Bubba. Bubba. Bubba clearly has some thoughts he

[40:06] wants to share. He's like Bubba is Roman Fontaine's lawyer and he would like to bring up Roman Fontaine's

[40:12] mention in this interview. So what are your thoughts Brenda? I think he has a lot to say for not

[40:17] really saying much right. It was a lot of long-winded repetitiveness. Overall I just don't understand

[40:25] how he feels like he could possibly have a case against you or anyone else when nothing you said

[40:30] was or put out there was falsely reported nor was it stuff that you were in his opinion maybe making

[40:34] up this was stuff that was fed to you by people who were close to him in the situation correct?

[40:39] Right so I think that's the point that Andrew misses in all of this is that I didn't wake up one

[40:45] day and say hey I'm going to go on a mission to take down this pinball company right. I think what

[40:50] he fails to realize is that the information that was sent to individuals like myself like rubber

[40:56] ducts the other people out there all that information was coming from people who were validating and

[41:02] giving us an insight into what was going on behind the scenes at highway pinball and it wasn't a

[41:08] good picture and so for us to get this information what what were we to do with it right I think we're

[41:13] should we have shared it with the pinball people out there and tried to protect people from

[41:18] potentially losing money or should we have kept quiet as I think you know he's sort of saying none

[41:24] of that information should have been shared. I think any customer who has money on the line regardless

[41:28] of whether it's in pinball or in any industry if someone has information that that is a product

[41:33] you should not invest in then as a customer yes I want to know that I want to know all the

[41:37] information about what I'm getting into right before I put my hard-earned dollars or or pounds or

[41:42] euros whatever it might be on the line. Right only the other thing too is and I think this is

[41:47] the point that I think Andrew kind of admits that he made a big mistake is when you look at the

[41:52] time frame of when he said games would ship and all of the sort of the negative information about

[41:58] the company it really only started to surface around 2016 because people had waited you know

[42:05] over a year for their games and it became apparent that production was not starting anytime soon

[42:12] and that's when I think just the dam broke where people were like actually it's probably not

[42:17] going to happen that full throttles shipping is not proof that the company is in a position to

[42:22] financially get people their alien machines. I'll say this too and this is the point where like when

[42:26] I see my name being called out is trying to take down this company I cover the entire pinball

[42:31] industry right no one has ever sent me anything to to indicate that there's any real problems at

[42:37] Jersey Jack pinball right now any real problems at Stern pinball any real problems at a spooky

[42:43] pinball any problems at Chicago gaming pinball the only two companies where people really have been

[42:49] shining a spotlight on our Dutch pinball and highway pinball as two companies that are misleading

[42:56] people into investing in them when they know all too well that they're not in a position to get

[43:01] people their games and so I would love for Andrew highway to go seek legal advice against me

[43:07] because I would love to hear a lawyer's response when the lawyer asks him some very basic questions

[43:13] like Andrew did you get people games that they paid for Andrew did you give people refunds

[43:19] who were you know who were who were coded you know the burden of responsibility when you take

[43:25] a customer's money it falls on you Andrew it's not it's not my fault that any of this happened and I

[43:30] think he sort of thinks that we created a run on the bank but the person who created a run on the

[43:36] bank was you Andrew like you're the reason why people wanted out because the the mismanagement of

[43:42] highway pinball it led to the kinds of stories that podcasts like this were reporting on it also

[43:50] sounded like he had a lot of other things going on he talks about how highway was the of the single

[43:55] and sole priority the entire time but then this Karl Karl company the hydrofoil thing happened to

[44:00] be also registered and set up on license in in the middle of all of this so clearly it was like

[44:05] busy and probably distracted yeah I mean we all know that story of the hydrofoil sort of happening

[44:12] sort of parallel at the same time that alien machines were supposed to ship and I don't have

[44:17] any information on whether or not any company funds were diverted I'm not going to speculate on that

[44:23] I just think it is kind of crazy that any other business venture would start to be developed

[44:28] right in the middle of of you owing people alien pinball machines it just seems like

[44:34] you need to be 100% focused on these machines a question that I did not see asked in the interview

[44:40] which we have heard time and time again from the likes of Dave Sanders is whether or not highway pinball

[44:45] paid the rent from the factories and I didn't see that question asked I would love to know if

[44:50] if highway pinball was actually paying their rent or were they skipping out on those obligations

[44:57] and that seemed to be one of the things that I received from people was like this company

[45:02] you should be cautious because Andrew's moving from factory to factory because they're not paying

[45:08] the rent and they're also not paying their supplier bills on time so yeah so you and this

[45:14] rubber ducky guy rubber duck rubber ducks I'm sorry rubber ducks right where you guys both put in

[45:20] a similar information from the center sources there were some differences in what you guys

[45:25] I've never talked to him and I were never like in cahoots or collaborating with information

[45:32] I did receive a bunch of information from one of Andrew's ex employees at one point

[45:39] but ex employees are ex employees are a reason right well this a thing is like look I get it

[45:44] I'm more than open to hearing Andrew's side of the story but I think when you start to hear

[45:50] different stories from different people but all the stories add up right so you have Dave

[45:55] Sanders saying something you have other employees saying something it just you know you zoom out

[45:59] in you ask well who do I believe do I believe all of these highway employees are saying the same

[46:04] thing or do I believe Andrew highway who's saying you know this is what actually happened and I do

[46:10] I do feel like there's a lot of blame going to or deflection to the investor group I mean if you're

[46:16] in these investors you're like I mean you must feel like betrayed and and and so frustrated that

[46:24] these guys have lost so much more money than anyone else and so they were just trying to protect

[46:28] themselves so I don't know Andrew seems like the battle between him and the investor group it's

[46:33] going to be a brutal one and I'm not even I don't even know if he has resources to try and pursue

[46:38] legal action against me but here's the thing Andrew I got a really good lawyer he drives him a

[46:42] clarin he would love he would love to hear what we did incorrectly that led to the downfall

[46:48] the company you invited Andrew on to the show a couple of times as well didn't you to essentially

[46:53] yeah Andrew's always been invited on to the show he has never accepted that invite I mean it's

[47:00] like this I I would happily have them on the show I think if you read between the lines or you hear

[47:06] everything he's saying the reality is he bit off more than he can chew and he knew that I mean

[47:12] he wanted to make a big pinball company that would manufacture hundreds of games a month without

[47:19] any knowledge of how to do that there weren't the people in the UK that knew how to do this I mean

[47:24] he literally was trying to compete with Stern pinball and Jersey Jack pinball with very little

[47:30] institutional knowledge of how to do that and look do I have any empathy or sadness for someone

[47:36] who tries to create a big pinball venture like that the reality is I don't like don't don't claim

[47:42] you can do something take people's hard earned money fail to deliver and then try to blame other

[47:49] people it it falls 100% on the shoulders of the individual who creates that company after you

[47:57] agree I mean all the money in the world if he was to have it doesn't stand a chance unless you

[48:03] actually put in the right resources and you know the right tools and the right people and framework

[48:08] yeah and that's it we keep hearing that recurring theme that this podcast is one of the reasons why

[48:13] the company like failed and I also want to address that is because we all know that throwing more money

[48:20] at the company would not have solved the company's problems and see that's the thing is when you are

[48:26] mismanaged or you don't have the right person now and you've got you know all of these like people

[48:32] they are trying to figure out how to make a pinball game more money is not going to solve the problem

[48:38] what they need it was more expertise they need it also to scale up slowly they try to become a big

[48:45] pinball company overnight and I think that ultimately led to the downfall and look I also want to

[48:52] say that it is disturbing that people are personally posting Andrew's home address or going after

[48:59] his family and stuff like that because you know look this is a failed business people lost money

[49:06] people should never personally threaten someone's livelihood or health or family I think when

[49:12] we cross that line where people are making those kinds of threats I think that is deplorable and

[49:17] people should be ashamed for doing that you know I've always sort of looked at these pinball companies

[49:23] as companies you know this isn't a personal attack against Andrew highway or anything that we've

[49:29] done on the show this is me questioning the company and his ability to manage that company but I

[49:35] would never on a personal level threaten him or or anyone that is you know close to him so

[49:43] what do you think Brennan you think we're gonna get a legal notice anytime soon um no I don't think so

[49:51] I think it's a lot of talk do you think I should change the spelling in my name to

[49:56] Coularris K-O-O-L-E-R-I-S my parents have just learned how to pronounce Coularris so I think we stick with that

[50:03] so what do you think do you think we this is the final we just closed the door do you think this is

[50:07] gonna be the the end of the highway pinball or are we gonna have a whole another round of pinball

[50:13] brothers games and promises and lawsuits and legal battles or is there we just have the middle

[50:20] on this whole saga I think if for those folks we probably have money that they're out they would

[50:26] love for this to continue with some semblance of hope that there will be a shining light at the end

[50:30] that they could get their game that they got really excited about but if they've not renewed the

[50:34] license and Fox knows about this drama then why would they bother you know we're newing it so I

[50:39] think you just got to acknowledge this as being the end draw the line of the sand lads and just like

[50:44] just all move on except for what it is failed this as you've already explained and just say this is it

[50:48] it's just like washer and house clean and everyone go their separate ways and best to look to everyone

[50:53] their best to look what what less than you think everyone should learn from this

[50:57] unless there's an actual product you can try test like a goddamn car go test drive it

[51:03] then hand over your money do not hand over money until you know that either a company has proven

[51:09] that can produce games such as stern they ain't going anywhere right or it's a product that some

[51:15] by a company you've never heard of before but they are putting the actual ready to play ready to

[51:20] ship game in front of you right yeah now I think we I think the pre-order world the world of like

[51:26] buying something that isn't real I think this company more than any other um you know

[51:32] showed people that you have to be very careful I think the hard part too is even if they make a game

[51:37] you still have to be very cautious of whether or not a company can produce another game because full

[51:45] throttle was like a red herring for people you know people a lot of the shells like Hilton they

[51:50] pointed at full throttle as hey look there's nothing wrong at highway pinball they've made full

[51:55] throttle and the reason why Andrew won't answer how many full throttles were made is that he knows

[52:02] deep down inside that hardly any full throttles were sold and because full throttle was a failure

[52:08] commercially that really put them into a terrible financial position to make alien and I've always

[52:14] said it full throttle was probably made with more money than alien was made with because the company

[52:20] had more resources at that time um all right well it's also only pinball knots can we just like take

[52:27] that moment pause and just take a big step back from this people who have put money down and I know

[52:32] you've gone into the pre-order stuff but you're not going in and putting like your only paycheck down

[52:38] if you're doing this I would like to think that you're in a much better financial position

[52:43] this is a fun little hobby big picture guys it's just pinball yeah but you know look nobody

[52:50] wants to lose money on anything I don't I don't want to lose eight bucks or eight thousand bucks

[52:53] and I think that we all know that for some of the people that lost money on his venture they're not

[52:58] rich like they can afford to lose the money and when you buy a pinball machine for the most part

[53:04] it does hold its value so people don't see them as like high risk investments um and that's why I

[53:10] think there's a lot of anger right now is people's money's gone like they'll never recover that like

[53:16] they will never recover the eight thousand dollars they lost and also their enjoyment in the hobby

[53:22] has sort of evaporated and I think that is what will ultimately be the legacy of of alien pinball

[53:29] it will always be looked at as something that tarnished the hobby and and and such is such as the

[53:36] you know tough lesson to learn right we kept hearing like just you know I just do you think like

[53:44] he took full responsibility I mean we read the in-mere with him do you think he like he's taking

[53:49] enough of the blame or do you think he's still deflecting he very much is deflecting to pinball

[53:55] brothers is that what's called the investor group but I I did get a sense of apology a little bit

[54:01] he is accepting a little bit of responsibility but I don't think his eyes are really open to the

[54:06] grinder of his involvement and how he is individual possibly could have managed this better and

[54:12] set of ones set of ones expectations more from the onset and I have not resulted to worry us today

[54:18] I think when I when I read his responses I think that he knewingly did mislead people at times but

[54:25] I think he sees that as a moment of survival like for this company to survive I need to get more

[54:31] money coming in and he definitely knew when he told people if you pay him for for your alien and

[54:36] you're gonna have it in a couple weeks he knew that games were not on the line he knew that the

[54:42] factory was not up and running but I think a lot of what he did he probably sees it as survival

[54:48] tactics and that you know and that sort of absolves him of the real remorse that I think you should

[54:57] feel around misleading people so look the story is it is what it is this is the final chapter I think

[55:05] pinball brothers will not be successful especially if they're making queen I don't think that's a

[55:10] title people really want I think it's cool queen yeah especially they got like some really good

[55:16] songs in there it's a great artwork yeah I think it's only gonna play under pressure on on loop

[55:23] all right Brenda well thank you for sitting down with me and indulging me in a in a podcast about this

[55:28] I um I've got my lawyer waiting to receive any legal advice I might need to plan for

[55:37] but Andrew also said that he's he's pursuing legal action and I do think when he finds out

[55:43] that nothing this show has done and reported is illegal nothing I have said was slanderous or

[55:51] libelous in fact if you remember what I did last year during alien day or or maybe yeah it was

[55:57] basically just in Andrew's own words all the things he said about the company the company's

[56:03] performance it was all just him hanging himself in a way and I think now Andrew just needs to say I'm

[56:11] sorry I got in over my head it's over goodbye I think that's it it's time to just like bury the hatchet

[56:19] and I don't think any people should be threatening him or or trying to cause harm to his family you

[56:24] invested in a company it didn't work out such as life it's like buying stock in a company that

[56:30] you know goes under move on the money's gone you're not getting your games you will have anger you

[56:36] will have hatred towards um you know the company but let's let you know this dying company die and

[56:46] move on any other final words Brenda can we get back this now yep we're gonna go eat everyone enjoy
