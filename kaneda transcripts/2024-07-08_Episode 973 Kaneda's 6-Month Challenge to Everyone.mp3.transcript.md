[00:00] Everybody's working for the weekend.

[00:06] Everybody wants a new romance.

[00:10] Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars.

[00:14] Ah, Happy Monday everybody. Welcome to Canadian Bimbal Podcast.

[00:18] Canadian Paternity Leave is over. I'm heading back to work today.

[00:22] I'm so happy. It is sunny out. It is Monday morning.

[00:25] And you're going to get the most entertaining Bimbal Podcast episode 970-something.

[00:31] We're going to talk all about the fact that a John Wick LE has popped up for sale for $11,000 instantly.

[00:43] This new Stern LE has lost $2,000.

[00:48] What does that mean when you telegraph to 999 other buyers that they just lost $2,000 on a cardboard box?

[01:02] How do you think they feel right now? How do you think Donald Garrison feels right now knowing he could have saved $2,000 if he just waited?

[01:11] And it's not just him. It's everybody else.

[01:14] Anybody that bought a John Wick LE, you know what? They never played it.

[01:19] They ordered the game before even playing the game.

[01:23] And I love this guy that's selling the game. He's like, you know, so many games come through my place.

[01:28] You don't even matter. 29 plays. You think that's a low amount of plays?

[01:32] I got a friend who sells an LE after only one play.

[01:37] And I'm just here to tell you right now.

[01:39] And if this is you, I hope you don't cancel your subscription.

[01:42] But if you order an LE and play it once and sell it for a multi-thousand dollar loss, something's wrong with you.

[01:53] Like literally something is wrong with you.

[01:56] This is where there's like starving people in the world where $2,000 could put a lot of food on someone's plate.

[02:03] And you're so damn rich that you can order like pinballs in LE format and lose $2,000 on one single play.

[02:15] Like what's wrong with you? These people act like, what are they running here?

[02:18] Some like some bed and breakfast for new inbox pinball machines.

[02:22] Every time something new comes out, guys, it's coming through my house.

[02:26] I don't even care if I want it. You should see the amount of machines I go through on a monthly basis.

[02:32] And I'm like, whatever man, what a strange way to live.

[02:36] But let's just talk about the fact that if this game has already lost $2,000 and it's lost more value than that.

[02:46] And the reason I know that is it still has not sold.

[02:51] And just think about everyone else out there who ordered a John Wick LE for $13,000

[02:58] and is watching this game sit unsold for $11,000 with just 29 plays on it.

[03:06] Everybody wake the F up.

[03:09] These stern machines are not worth this much money.

[03:14] And this is not sustainable.

[03:16] And it's not just because it's John Wick.

[03:19] The same thing has happened to Foo Fighters, to James Bond, to Venom, to John Wick.

[03:26] So only Jaws is the only game that's held some value.

[03:30] And even Jaws has not gone up in value.

[03:34] And everybody remember for the longest period of time, every single hot and in demand LE or collector's edition,

[03:41] when you bought one, it went up $2,000 to $3,000 in value.

[03:46] And now we're living in a completely upside down pinball marketplace.

[03:50] You unbox the thing and it loses $2,000 to $3,000.

[03:54] So you think this hobby is going to survive?

[03:57] I mean this new and box sales, you think they're going to survive much longer,

[04:01] where people who buy three new and box LE's lose $9,000 to $10,000 on their games.

[04:08] Because when you add up all those losses, that's the money they would use to buy the next new and box LE machine.

[04:16] And you just can't sustain it like this.

[04:18] And I just think it's funny because as Canada's been telling everybody to wait and see, wait and see, wait and see,

[04:24] on every game, on every single game, if you just wait it out, there's no way these things are going to hold value.

[04:30] There's no way the current pricing structure works.

[04:33] And it's not just because it's John Wick.

[04:35] Look, we got Elton John collector's edition.

[04:37] Great game. Absolutely phenomenal game.

[04:40] It is the best $12,000 CE Jersey Jack ever made.

[04:45] And it's the greatest like $9,500 platinum game they ever made.

[04:50] The problem is the platinum is $12,500 and the CE is $15,000.

[04:56] And for some of you out there that have to pay taxes and shipping, and yes,

[05:01] there are many people out there that have to pay taxes on these games.

[05:05] So if you buy a $15,000 Elton John CE and you got to pay for shipping

[05:12] and you got to pay for taxes on that game, you are in on.

[05:16] I mean, I want to say close to $17,500 on your pinball purchase for one freaking pinball machine

[05:27] where they're going to make a thousand of them.

[05:29] And I know that Jersey Jack said they've made all 1000 collectors editions.

[05:34] Do you believe that? Do you really believe that? I don't know.

[05:36] I still have a hard time believing that.

[05:38] I just don't see enough unboxings of this game where they made this many.

[05:45] And I really wish that Jersey Jack would just stop with like the shenanigans

[05:50] about how they number their games. Just make them in order so we know.

[05:56] Like it's so weird to me in a hobby where like collectors are driving it,

[06:01] that they make these games where it's impossible to know like how many they actually made.

[06:07] They don't disclose that information. The numbers are all over the place.

[06:12] Like dudes could order a game after it's been on the line for six months and get game number 83

[06:18] because they just shuffle the deck of like the plaques that go on the game.

[06:22] And the number of the game has no significance in what order that game was on the line.

[06:28] And I just think we need to stop that. Game number one should be game number one.

[06:32] And game number 1000 should be the last game off the line.

[06:37] It should just be that simple. And if you want your number, I get it.

[06:40] Like let's say you want number 007, then you get the seventh game off the line.

[06:44] If you want number 666, then you got to wait until number 666 is built.

[06:49] Why don't they just do it like that?

[06:51] That would be an easy way to just showcase to everybody,

[06:55] hey, we're going to be transparent about how many games we're going to make,

[06:59] but we're still going to allow people to get their custom number.

[07:02] I just don't get it, right? I just don't get it.

[07:05] But let's get back to John Wick and Elton John.

[07:08] So Elton John CE, some guy bought it brand new, $15,000.

[07:14] He opened up the game and he lifted the play field and he damaged his inner art decals,

[07:19] which are basically like a $50 item that you could switch out in like 30 minutes.

[07:25] Okay, so he damages those and now he's selling that game for $13,000.

[07:31] It's a brand new game. It just needs a new sticker.

[07:35] Okay, so all of a sudden now you've got Elton John CE,

[07:39] which people are saying is the greatest game ever made.

[07:41] It's not the greatest game ever made.

[07:43] It's just the greatest shooting Jersey Jack game ever made.

[07:47] And that's a really important part because most Jersey Jack games don't shoot well

[07:54] and they finally made a game that shoots amazingly well.

[07:58] And you can also understand what to do when you play it.

[08:03] That's the other big part about Elton John.

[08:06] The reason why it's fun is because it's not confusing.

[08:11] Almost all the other Jersey Jack games, when you walk up to it,

[08:16] you are so confused what to do, how to play the game.

[08:21] It doesn't communicate to you what's going on unlike a stern machine,

[08:25] which is a lot easier to get into.

[08:28] Okay, so you've got this game now and that's lost $2,000 in value.

[08:34] And I don't even think that game sold.

[08:36] And I'm just here to tell you ladies and gentlemen,

[08:38] so just think about it between Elton John CE and John Wick Ellie.

[08:44] You're now communicating to 2,000 people.

[08:48] 2,000 people, they're now looking at the market and saying,

[08:52] hey, if I had just waited just a little bit,

[08:55] now look, Elton John's been out for eight freaking months.

[08:58] So you could make the argument that the thing hasn't really lost much value,

[09:02] but it's just a sign of the times that if you don't need a game right now,

[09:08] like if you don't need a game even in the first six months to a year that it's out,

[09:13] you're going to have significant savings on every single title.

[09:18] It doesn't matter what it is.

[09:20] It's even going to be significant savings on Jaws Ellie.

[09:23] It's going to be significant savings on James Bond on Venom on Elton John,

[09:27] every single game.

[09:28] And the next game this is going to impact is a game that can't even come out.

[09:33] And that's Pulp Fiction Ellie.

[09:35] The latest on the street is that this Pulp Fiction Ellie is going to be made in September.

[09:41] This is ridiculous.

[09:42] This is absolutely ridiculous.

[09:44] There is no excuse why it's taken so long for CGC to get this game to customers,

[09:50] but that's just the reality.

[09:52] And I think we're living in a bold new, brave new pinball world in which this is not going to last very long.

[09:59] I think new and box sales are going to be the toughest ever as we head into the end of 2024 into 2025

[10:07] because you really have to have your head examined.

[10:10] You go in on a new and box Ellie or CE of any of these games because what we're seeing right now,

[10:18] if you just wait, and I mean this too, it's not just the Ellie.

[10:22] It's like the premiums too because if you buy a premium brand new for 9500,

[10:28] there's a really good chance if you wait six months,

[10:32] you will get the Ellie version of that game for the amount of money you spent on your premium.

[10:39] Everybody is losing now except for the pro buyer.

[10:44] Now just think about that for a minute.

[10:47] What happened to the entire hobby?

[10:49] So the people that buy the cheapest version that has the most unlimited amounts,

[10:56] those people have the most secure investment?

[11:00] This is all that's wrong in pinball right now.

[11:03] And I mean it and I know we talk about price a lot,

[11:06] but it has to be talked about because the world's getting crazy expensive

[11:11] and I don't want to see my friends continue to lose money on these pinball purchases.

[11:16] And here's the problem is that it's no fun.

[11:20] It's no fun spending this much money and then witnessing the person who spends the least amount of money also has the least amount of risk.

[11:30] That's not the way things are supposed to work.

[11:33] If you spend the most amount of money, you should have the most amount of protection.

[11:38] You shouldn't have the greatest risk and you shouldn't be losing the most amount of money on your game.

[11:43] But I think the same thing is going to happen to Pulp Fiction because by the time this game comes out,

[11:47] they're now saying they're going to make the Ellie's in September through November.

[11:52] And I think there's a thousand of them.

[11:54] Okay, so they're going to flood the market with all of these Ellie's, these bad mo fo additions,

[11:59] and it has the cool topper.

[12:01] And I think what's going to happen now, you're going to see bootleg versions of that topper pop up.

[12:06] And I don't think there's going to be anything they can do about it.

[12:10] Now, speaking of mods on games, just want to give a big shout out to Chris over at CRCRCades.

[12:17] I don't know, Chris, I need to know how to pronounce this thing because I'm in marketing and it's like CRCAIDS, right?

[12:23] ADES and he makes pinball mods.

[12:25] Check them out.

[12:26] He's got a lot of like really high end expensive stuff for JAWS.

[12:30] But I don't know how to say it like CRCAIDS.

[12:33] I think that's how you say it, but it's just spelled a little weird.

[12:37] I'm going to talk to you brother about this from a marketing standpoint.

[12:40] It shouldn't be confusing how you enunciate the name of a company, but we'll get you there, man.

[12:44] We'll get you there.

[12:45] But he's a $50 a month Canadian club member.

[12:48] I'm looking at you, Ed Robertson.

[12:50] I'm looking at you, Ed, right now, man.

[12:53] I know you get paid every time the Big Bang Theory theme song plays.

[12:58] You get paid.

[13:00] And I think Ed's that $5 a month, man.

[13:02] He's at $5 a month.

[13:04] I love you, Ed, so much.

[13:05] Thank you for being a member of the Canadian club.

[13:07] But the same thing's going to happen with this pulp fiction.

[13:10] And here's the thing, people.

[13:12] It's like amazing time to be in pinball because it's a buyer's market.

[13:17] It's the biggest buyer's market in the history of pinball.

[13:21] If I'm a dealer, if I'm a distro, I'm as nervous as can be because somebody's got to buy all these John Wick LEs that are losing value.

[13:29] And think about it right now.

[13:31] If you're a distro and you've got 15 John Wick LEs that you ordered because you want to get Jack Danger's X-Men 97, which is most likely next,

[13:43] and you want to get some of these Godzilla premium black and white editions,

[13:47] so you ordered 15 John Wick LEs, right?

[13:51] You haven't sold them all.

[13:52] And now you see this one for sale for $11,000.

[13:57] What do you think that's going to do to that dealer's ability to move those games?

[14:02] Seth Davis, I know you don't listen to this show,

[14:05] but Seth Davis has destroyed the pinball pricing.

[14:09] It is so beyond stupid.

[14:11] It's not even funny.

[14:13] And it'd be one thing if one game was an anomaly, right?

[14:16] It was just Venom that lost the money.

[14:18] Yeah, you could chalk it up as being just because it's Venom.

[14:21] But man, it's happened to every single game.

[14:25] Every single game has lost money,

[14:27] and 90% of those games have lost thousands of dollars.

[14:32] I'm not saying hundreds, thousands of dollars.

[14:34] And then all of a sudden it's like, well, maybe we should stop being idiots.

[14:38] Maybe we should stop bailing out Seth Davis and his greedy company.

[14:44] And maybe we should start showing more support to all the operators out there.

[14:49] And instead of chasing all of these new and box games,

[14:53] just go out on location with 50 bucks, buy a couple beers,

[14:59] play these games and just enjoy them out on location,

[15:03] and don't rush to buy them.

[15:05] Because when you rush to buy them, you're going to get burned.

[15:09] Now speaking of rush to buy them,

[15:11] did you see this stern pinball is going to make more rush machines?

[15:17] Who the heck needs more rush machines?

[15:20] What is going on over at Stern?

[15:22] I think it's obvious what's going on over at Stern.

[15:25] They just don't have a hit.

[15:27] They have nothing right now that people want,

[15:29] and they're just going to keep remaking the old stuff.

[15:32] But you guys all know the issue with this.

[15:35] If they just keep doing this and rerunning everything from yesteryear,

[15:40] all that's going to do is continue to over saturate every single title

[15:46] to the point where when you go to sell your Rush now,

[15:50] and you go to sell your Metallica when they remake that,

[15:53] or go to sell your Godzilla when they bring out a nicer black and white version,

[15:58] when you go to sell your game,

[16:01] it's going to either sit forever,

[16:03] or you're going to take a much bigger loss than you ever anticipated.

[16:08] And that is why, ladies and gentlemen,

[16:11] I really do urge each and every one of you,

[16:15] enjoy the games you have.

[16:17] If you don't have a gym membership,

[16:20] I haven't talked like this much lately,

[16:22] go join a gym.

[16:24] Take care of your bodies.

[16:26] Take care of your lives.

[16:28] Add more balance into your life.

[16:31] The money you're about to spend on another pinball machine

[16:34] that you know you don't need.

[16:36] Do me a favor, take that money,

[16:38] whether it's $6,000 for a pro,

[16:40] all the way up to $15,000 for an Elton John CE.

[16:44] I see these guys, Iceman, Bezel Boob.

[16:47] They're not in shape.

[16:48] They're not taking care of themselves.

[16:50] They're taking care of their pinball collections

[16:53] more than they're taking care of themselves.

[16:55] And this might ring true for some of you.

[16:58] And trust me, just take that money, whatever it is,

[17:01] and invest that in your help.

[17:03] Invest that in yourself.

[17:05] Invest that in feeling better about your life.

[17:08] And trust me, not only will you enjoy

[17:11] your pinball collection that you already have,

[17:14] that is already amazing,

[17:16] but you'll start to feel happier.

[17:19] And I mean this, we've all been stuck in this vortex, right?

[17:22] It's been this like, imagine being dropped into this blender,

[17:25] all these years of FOMO, and I need the next one.

[17:29] And if I don't get the newest pinball machine,

[17:31] my life is gonna be incomplete.

[17:33] And if I listen to these newbie content creators

[17:35] that just buy everything,

[17:37] because it seems like they need to buy new friends,

[17:39] it's not the way to happiness, people.

[17:41] You don't need to do it that way.

[17:43] And I think what I've been saying all these years

[17:46] is just less is more.

[17:48] We should be putting the onus on these companies

[17:51] to making magical games.

[17:53] And we know deep down inside,

[17:54] I'm looking at everybody right now,

[17:56] deep down inside, we know they haven't been doing it.

[17:59] Like why is it that 10 years ago,

[18:01] the big Lebowski could put all that stuff

[18:03] mechanically into a game,

[18:05] and then you look at a game like John Wick.

[18:07] 10 years later, look at what's in John Wick.

[18:10] 10 years later, look at what's in Elton John.

[18:13] 10 years later, look at what's in these games.

[18:16] And it just doesn't even come close

[18:19] to justifying what the prices are.

[18:22] And that's okay, people, because here's what's gonna happen.

[18:24] If each and every one of us just pauses,

[18:27] like buying all of these new things,

[18:29] if each and every one of us invest that money

[18:32] in your health, because health is true wealth in life.

[18:35] If you do that over the next six months, trust me,

[18:37] just do it over the next six months and see what happens.

[18:41] Six months from now, you're gonna feel so much better.

[18:44] Six months from now, you're gonna be able to buy

[18:47] any of those games you wanted for much less money.

[18:51] And six months from now, we're all gonna be raising a glass

[18:54] and cheers-ing to feeling better about ourselves,

[18:58] our bodies, our health, our mentality on pinball.

[19:02] And then we can rock into like Expo and TPF and look better.

[19:07] We're gonna be able to buy every game we want

[19:09] because they're gonna be so much cheaper.

[19:12] I mean, it's like every single new-in-box game.

[19:15] We'll be 30 to 40% cheaper if you wait six months to a year.

[19:19] And now that we all know that, everybody,

[19:21] how liberating is that information?

[19:23] It is so liberating. I come to you now as a man

[19:27] that barely plays pinball to help liberate you

[19:31] in the pinball space because you need someone to tell you this.

[19:35] Your wives and your partners and your kids

[19:38] have been telling you this for years.

[19:40] Stop buying every single new game.

[19:44] It's not making your waistline thinner.

[19:46] It's not making you happier.

[19:48] It's not making your game room more impressive.

[19:50] Trust me, as a grown adult, nobody wants to come over

[19:54] and see 35 pinball machines in a house.

[19:57] Three is enough. Three is more than enough pinball machines.

[20:01] I'm looking at my beautiful neighbors right now.

[20:03] I bet I've got the only pinball machine in town.

[20:06] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[20:08] And trust me, do this. Let's spend the next six months

[20:12] getting ourselves in the best shape of our lives.

[20:16] And then we're going to roll into pinball shows with a lot of cash

[20:20] and buy anything we want for 30% cheaper.

[20:24] You know who doesn't want you to feel this way?

[20:26] Distros dealers, Seth Davis, they want you to buy, buy, buy.

[20:31] No, wait, wait, wait and get in shape, shape, shape.

[20:34] That's going to be the new Canadian line.

[20:36] Wait, wait, wait while you get in shape, shape, shape.

[20:39] And we're all going to feel so much better passing the good vibes

[20:42] over here from Connecticut on to each and every one of you.

[20:45] Thank you for being a club member. This show ain't stopping.

[20:48] I'm on caffeine. We're going to crush it this week.

[20:50] And a moment of silence to Donald Garrison, who just lost $2,000 instantly

[20:55] because he got blinded by the stained glass window of John Wick Ellie.

[21:00] Sorry, bro. You should have followed your mentor's advice later.
