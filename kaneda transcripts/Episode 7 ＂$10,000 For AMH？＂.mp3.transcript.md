[00:00] Canada, what are you doing here?

[00:04] Huh?

[00:05] Huh?

[00:06] Tetsua, are you alright?

[00:09] We came to help!

[00:10] Music

[00:17] Here we are, episode seven.

[00:20] Coming at you, it's Sunday morning in New York City, and I've been traveling for work last week, so I wasn't able to really dive too deeply.

[00:29] I've been in Detroit, I flew to Dallas.

[00:36] I flew to Dallas guys there and back in one day for a meeting that lasted 26 minutes.

[00:43] So I've been tired this weekend.

[00:46] Brenda, against her better judgment, is actually moving into the apartment.

[00:52] It's now going to be our apartment.

[00:54] And I have to say, I have never met a cooler woman in my entire life.

[00:59] I mean, she's actually going to let me keep the arcade.

[01:03] And right now we're sort of redesigning the living room, and we'll do the kitchen in the bathroom.

[01:09] But Brenda's moving in, so it's been a busy weekend.

[01:12] But that hasn't stopped some interesting stuff from going up on the forms.

[01:17] And I want to cover three things today.

[01:19] I first want to say this.

[01:21] What I love about Pinside, and I love about Pimball in general, is stuff changes so frequently.

[01:28] And there are three topics that I was originally going to talk about.

[01:31] I have already changed because I woke up this morning, and I read some things going on.

[01:35] And I want to cover those instead, because I think they're more timely, more interesting.

[01:39] So those three things are going to be America's most honoured, and what the resale value of this game is.

[01:49] Someone just posted one for sale, and it is really exploding the conversation in that thread,

[01:56] and it's just interesting to talk about that.

[01:58] I also want to talk about the Hobbit.

[02:00] It is going to be in New York City Tuesday night, and I look forward to getting there,

[02:07] and playing it, and giving you guys a decent review.

[02:10] And lastly, I want to talk about a new Stern Pimball that is going to be made by

[02:17] none other than Metallic artist Dirty Donny.

[02:21] So let's talk about what that game could possibly be.

[02:24] And that's it.

[02:25] I don't want to make it too long of an episode.

[02:27] I got to get to a brunch in the city, and I'm trying to do this before that, and Brenda will come leave if I'm not there by 12.30.

[02:35] So let's start out with America's most honoured.

[02:39] Crazy muffin just listed an America's most honoured for sale.

[02:45] Believe it's a new inbox.

[02:46] Forget ready for this.

[02:48] $10,000.

[02:51] Surely you can be serious.

[02:53] I am serious, and don't call me Shirley.

[02:56] And look, the price police and selling a pinball on Pinside is something that you guys know me.

[03:03] I'm very active in those thrice, even though I'm never a buyer, right?

[03:06] I'm only a room for one pin, and even though I'm never a seller, because I only have one pin, and I can't sell it.

[03:11] But when you're collecting, and you're collecting pinball, I love collecting things, and I will have more room one day.

[03:17] But four sale threads are some of the most fun threads to jump into.

[03:21] Why? Because there's so much just emotion and drama usually in these threads.

[03:27] So I think Crazy Muffin did a smart thing by listing this pin for $10,000.

[03:32] Why?

[03:33] Because he's going to get a reaction. That thread is constantly going to be bumped up to the top, and his four sale thread is going to jump ahead of everyone else's.

[03:43] So here's the thing with asking a lot for a pin.

[03:49] I see so frequently when someone sets a price for something, people just lose their lid if it's more than they think it should be.

[03:58] And so when you ask $10,000, for a new and box America's most honoured, some people are just going to flip out and say, you're nuts for asking that.

[04:10] But guys, in any market, this seller should ask for the highest price possible, and obviously, if they're taking best offer, why not?

[04:22] Why not? Try and get the most out of it.

[04:26] And so I'm going to get into in a little bit, whether I think that price is worth it, whether that's fair for this game.

[04:34] I'm going to read some of your comments on that price, but a high price is the smartest thing to do.

[04:40] I always think it's silly when people list a pin and it's sold in like an hour.

[04:46] So that seller clearly left money on the table. And you see it all the time.

[04:50] You see it all the time. Some guy oldest something well below the highest price he could get for it.

[04:58] And look, I get it. Some people have to move a pin and they need money quickly. And that's fine.

[05:03] And look, at the end of the day, with all four sail threads, only two people have to be satisfied.

[05:10] Not the pinball trolls and the sales police and all the people that are not even in on it who are crying and screaming, only the buyer and the seller have to walk away satisfied.

[05:22] And if those two people do that, then good. Then good. Then both parties are happy, even if the mob who's standing around the sale are screaming and crying about what's going on.

[05:34] So this pin gets listed and you know, it's it's interesting to see how people have responded to it.

[05:44] But here's here's the first angle I want to tackle with this pin because there's multiple ways to look at this.

[05:51] The first is the notion that it's new in box. And we see this. Sometimes people will buy a pin and never open it and keep it for a year or two.

[06:03] Sometimes, you know, people still have new in box cactus canyons when I went up for sale recently for, I don't know, I forget what it was like 17 or 20,000.

[06:12] And so there's always the people who respond and say, I can't believe you bought a pinball machine and you never open the box.

[06:20] Like, what are you doing? Like, that's stupid. You're stupid for doing that. This is a toy. It's meant to be played. How could you do that?

[06:27] And to those people, I say, come on. This is a collector community. And if you want the nicest version of something opening it up new in box is still going to be the best version of a game you'll get other than like a hepp restored version of a game.

[06:48] So I get why people do it. Some people have the the foresight to buy a game like trinelly. I forget his name in New Jersey. He bought one. He bought two. He opened one low use home, you know, low play home use only pen and he kept one new in box. And he sold it for a lot of money. I think he doubled his money on it pretty much.

[07:09] And so there's always going to be those people who buy new box and I say to those people who want to do that, who want to speculate on pinball, there's nothing wrong with it. Don't let people call you names and convince you that you've done something wrong. It is totally fine to keep a pen new in box. Now the other side of selling a new in fix, sorry, new in box pin for a lot of money.

[07:32] I just think the buyer just always loses out on a new in box purchase. The reason being is you're going to open it up. So then right in that moment, you've opened it up and you've sort of lost the premium you paid for new in box.

[07:52] And on some of these, that premium can be a couple thousand dollars more than if it was just a low play home use only pen. And here's the thing I I would never buy a new in box version of a game where most of the ones that are out there are all in collector's hands, which means they're mostly being taken care of, which means they're going to be pretty pristine and mint.

[08:21] When when comes up for sale, these aren't things that people are beating on. They're not getting 100 to play the day. And so I would just wait and avoid the new in box sort of glory that comes with opening a virgin machine, especially on the older machines too.

[08:43] There are a lot of people say that cactus cans, sometimes the batteries can leak out and cause bored damage. And you don't know what you're going to open up and what you're going to find, which could cause expensive repairs down the road.

[08:56] So I'd rather buy a game that has been played. And me personally, I'd rather buy a game that has some of the mods that are really desirable put into the game because if you are able to find one that has some nice stuff in it and you're paying less than those mods cost, then I think you're getting a great deal.

[09:14] So it's 10 grand, it's new in box. And you know, what are people saying about this? So I think someone on Pinside said at the best that and his name is under Lord and he said, it's only insane from a rational point of view.

[09:33] Pinball buying is 95% emotion, 4% financial planning, 1% or less for thought. I 100% agree with that statement. We spend money on these machines, the kind of coin people drop.

[09:53] And the way people chase after LEDs and the way people chase after games that are limited, it's all emotion guys, all emotion. And the fact that there's only 150 America's most haunted out there that is driving people now that production is coming to an end to seek this game out.

[10:12] And there's that fear of missing out that I'll never another one will never come up. I don't think that's going to happen. I really don't. I think that no matter how limited the pin is, if you just wait, one will come up.

[10:26] What you have to ask yourself is one will one come up for this price and in this condition. And that's the thing that's driving this thread. So so far is it's men, it's new in box.

[10:37] And but it's sure expensive. It's 4 grand more than the game cost new, right? This game cost I believe $6,000 when it came out. And so that's a huge, huge increase in value.

[10:51] Pinsider musket it is a musket it M U S K E TD musket says 10 K seems fair for new in box one and I'm not an owner. This is just a special game.

[11:04] Okay.

[11:06] Bo Joe says wait till what you see new in box rob zombies are going for on the secondary market once they have all been produced.

[11:16] Guess spooky is selling them too cheap and will have to raise the prices going forward. Interesting.

[11:24] I just want to point for the record that I said that exact same thing and everybody slammed you when I said it. Spooky is giving away rob zombie at $6,000 considering two things.

[11:39] They're only making 300 and the demand for that theme far exceeds the demand for America's most honoured.

[11:46] Far exceeds. It is not even close. When we talk about emotion people's emotional connection to rob zombie in his music versus the America's most honoured theme.

[11:58] So I said spooky made a mistake. I think I said that thread spooky could have charged $8,000 and people would have been fine.

[12:08] And the whole notion that this is boutique that these guys are hand making these things slowly they're building a new factory.

[12:16] They're growing as a company but this is where they need to be to really create you know a lot of financial.

[12:22] This is where the market will bear and this is where they will be they didn't do it and I understand they do deserve credit for keeping the price relatively around a stern pro.

[12:33] And I think they also know this is for what we're doing and what we're delivering this is where the price can be and because I don't I don't see the quality in a spooky pinball machine to warrant anything really north of $6,000.

[12:50] But quality aside guys the demand would have allowed them to move product at that increased price.

[12:58] You can't always just say quality is the reason why something is what it is sometimes you know demand for a low supply who cares right who cares if certain things look a little bit home brew on their pins.

[13:10] There's only 150 of them that's it. And if there's 500 collectors out there of 5,000 collectors out there you know and think it ever have it in their collection.

[13:20] So one of the most expensive video game cartridges of all time what's that what's that Nintendo NES cartridge the track and field game is like stadium events I think it's called sells for like 30,000 dollars 50,000 dollars new in box.

[13:39] It's one of the worst games they made but they just made so few of them.

[13:44] So you know that that is the case means and look if spooky charged 2,000 more for every Rob Zombie made what is that another $600,000 they left on the table that's a lot of money and they could have got it and here's the thing if what he's saying is right and Rob zombies flip for 6,000 or immediately or 10,000 on the road.

[14:13] That's money that spooky will never see that's money that spooky will never see.

[14:19] So let's see what happens and then one last thing just to balance out some of the feedback Jade Gentry said this is nothing but a cash grab all the owners acting like this is completely reasonable is funny.

[14:34] It's a fun game but anyone wants to offer me 10k for mine I would start breaking it down that second.

[14:40] So I agree with this this is not it so this is the last thing I want to say is is this game worth 10,000 dollars and I think you have to be really out of your freaking mind if you think that America's most haunted is a 10k pen I don't care if they made 15 of them I don't care if they made one of them.

[15:05] It's just not worth that guys and look this is my opinion right if someone thinks it's worth them they really want it then it's worth that I bought my fix it Felix Jr.

[15:18] for without all things included shipping $7,000 some people think that pennies worth it I sorry that arcade machine is worth nothing nothing.

[15:27] One sold on eBay for 20,000 most of them sell for around 6 to 7 there's not many out there there's only about 20 in private hands in the world and if you collect arcade games there's 20 fix it Felix's and people consider that to be the worst game ever but there's 200,000 miss pack means that were made.

[15:48] So I don't know it will sell for 10k this is going to be interesting thread to watch I don't think it's worth it and I wanted to say this I think right now.

[16:02] Jan were right upon February I think in the next three months anyone who buys a pin inexpensive pin whether it's a 10,000 dollar America most on it I saw someone just listed a 7,000 five dollars star track alley if there ever was a time in pinball to just wait wait this is that time because there is so much.

[16:32] Coming out there is so much about to be revealed there are going to be so many options the people that I would wait for a few reasons I would wait because something that might get revealed or shown very soon whether it's ghost busters or alien or libouski shipping and it's great and hobbit shipping and it's great you may want that you may want that and to go in and a game that's already out I think it's a long time to do it for my.

[17:01] Second reason because I think the value on pins that came out in the last few years are all going to drop they are going to drop guys there is when I see people spending like 7,500, 8,000 dollars on a star track alley and you're going to be the third owner of the game and these pins are almost selling for what they were new in box.

[17:23] Man that market is going to go away people you are not going to get.

[17:29] In increase or equal value for pins down the road simply because of the volume that's going to occur and the quality and the innovation that is going to take place is your so why not wait I would just wait even if you handed me 8,000 dollars right now 10,000 dollars and said.

[17:46] I think I think I can go buy a pin I really wouldn't go buy anything.

[17:54] Look if you could wave 10 grand around and get a lot from people right you can get an MMR you could get a tronle you could get any any of the recent stirons that have come out that are hot you could get almost any of the older titles,

[18:09] Admin's family, Twilight's own, I'm trying to get a medieval madness remake you get an original all these great pins are out there but I would just wait because I'm so much more excited about what the future holds for pinball then what's come out.

[18:26] And I think we are at the crossroads of value and innovation and desirability people can't desire what they really don't know is there.

[18:39] So we're left desiring themes I really want Star Wars I really want to rest the world I really want ghostbusters but once people see the toys in these mechs on these games you know if ghostbusters comes out and the pins got holographic ghost on the playfield.

[18:55] And the trap opens up and sucks the ball on the ghost I mean things like that if they come out and a lot of these things are speculation in our dreams right now but if what's revealed in the next few months really brings innovation and excitement to the table then I think people really really really need to wait and hold on to their money and now is not a good time to buy the market is about to be flooded with stuff just hold on and I think you'll be happy you did.

[19:25] Because you're going to want to put your money elsewhere so that's a good segue in terms of waiting and seeing what's going to come out there to some exciting exciting news the hobbit is going to ship very very soon and I know we were talking about this in the last episode but the but things are actually happening right when when a production pin is out there and it's in in in owls hands and you jersey and it's about to be a New Yorker.

[19:55] And this is the big city Tuesday night and and Jen has emailed customers and and one has said that she is pretty much guaranteed that his smog special edition will be delivered by mid March you have to get excited as much as we could gripe about JJP and as much as we could complain and troll the situation and even though I brought up where your money could have been if you had invested in netflix versus hobbit all that is.

[20:25] And this is what are under the bridge when this game ships and all will be forgotten and hopefully this won't happen again and we said that last time but now is the time to celebrate and for people who think they're going to just listen to canada I'm going to rant and complain all the time is not true I love pinball as much as you guys I want to see pinball ship as much as you guys I will speculate on the collector market which is where most of the drama occurs anyway but when when you pin ship it's always going to be a lot of money.

[20:55] So I'm not going to be a standing ovation moment no matter what the pin is for me no matter how much it costs no matter anything I just love the fact that pinball has gone from an assembly line to a game room in 2016 I think that is a miracle that should always be celebrated so hobbit is going to ship now for some reason I'll post it on pin slide I think it was like day of the machine is going to be in New Jersey come by and play it I mean I would have went I just didn't have any prior notice it wasn't I'm going to be a real good guy.

[21:25] It's not my things to do instead I think at that time was probably napping then Brenda and I went to restoration hardware and guys talk about pinball prices Brenda sat down on a chair at restoration hardware it was one chair with an ottoman the chair is $6,000 and the ottoman was $2,200 okay eight thousand two dollars for chair an ottoman of course we did not buy it but what I'm saying is the theory of price is going to be a big deal.

[21:55] I think that is one thing that brings us joy is so relative to where we're at and but I couldn't go so my day was filled and I saw that the game was there and it I've been to owls before it's an it's an interesting facility it's just got tons of pins it's a great little clubhouse I told them like man you got to clean this place up a little bit and make it like a clubhouse where people could actually come by and hang out and spend money and you could even you know have members

[22:24] membership fee and but it's it's it's kind of cluttered in there and there's just a lot of madness going on but I love it anyway I mean his office is just like this throwback to to the 80s and what not and so someone uploaded a video of the hobbit and first when you upload videos guys can you do us all a favor moving forward and I'm going to try and capture video when I go to the bar that it's going to be out in sorry it's in Brooklyn the name just so

[22:54] this gives me right now but it's me there to tonight when you take video turn your phone 90 degrees guys I see this all the time I know it's it's misleading because the pinball machine is is vertical so

[23:08] you want to hold your phone to go over the playfield but when you upload that video guys there's going to be 2 big black bars on the side you're not getting

[23:16] vertical area when you hold it vertical as opposed to going 90 degrees when you

[23:20] take video and just do go 90 please and stand back it'll just be a much better

[23:24] video for everyone when we when we watch it but someone uploaded a video of of a

[23:30] about a minute minute and 15 seconds of the multi-ball and all I got to say is

[23:37] when I see this stuff is wow the game looks phenomenal as much as there's a lot

[23:44] of griping here and there the game just looks incredible that multi-ball and it

[23:48] was short the the lighting effects the smell as you know as much as he's not

[23:57] interactive he's so cool and just I'm just blown away by the sound of the

[24:02] hobby when I hear the ball and everything it hits and the music it it blows away

[24:09] my Lord the Rings like Lord the Rings like you kind of got the music going and

[24:14] when you hit something you get a sound effect and it's great I mean I love Lord

[24:17] the Rings I love it I love it love it I don't think hobbit I don't it's gonna be

[24:21] hard to topple Lord the Rings in terms of overall integration theme because of

[24:26] everything it has but but man hobbit looks incredible and smell when he's

[24:31] talking and and like sort of like the the bass in his voice and the lights are

[24:35] going and the multi-ball is going it looks incredible and I'm gonna try and

[24:39] grab some more video for you guys but this is super exciting that hobbit is

[24:42] gonna be shipping soon and I hope they make their mark so I really really

[24:50] really hope that JJP like mid-March is realistic and happens now what I there

[24:57] is one thing though that people are still so the couple things people are still

[25:00] grabbing about one when is the the the upper flipper the upper flipper continues

[25:07] to be called out for being pointless but there's nothing really to shoot at it

[25:13] with and I don't know if people have been given an answer those satisfied with

[25:21] I know people ask he then he talked about how you can do certain things on it

[25:24] but it doesn't seem to have a critical shot at all or or shot you really can

[25:31] only make with it and I think that's the big issue too it's why put a third

[25:36] flipper up the upper right if there's nothing really to hit so actually I

[25:42] wanted to get to the bottom of this so I I called Keith up and I asked him I said

[25:46] hey Keith can you explain like what the reason we know what we're thinking

[25:52] behind having an upper flipper up there and is a reason that is a reason for it

[25:57] that people can't hit with the flippers that are down there so yeah I just asked

[26:01] me a simple question and here's what he said to me what do the things I'm gonna

[26:05] find up there that they can't find down here I think if the piss high enough they're

[26:08] gonna come across the monkey with the beard and the crap ideas and it's like oh

[26:13] there you are captain I mean are you busy because I've got a few fundamental

[26:16] questions for you all right well you know I accept the data and so it makes total

[26:20] sense now that that upper flipper is there so this is exciting have it is going

[26:26] to be a pin that I do think is worth the wait but I still hold to my initial

[26:34] statements in the last podcast that pre-ordering this thing for for three years was

[26:40] was it was an a-n-a-n-act that just will never be justified and I saw some guys

[26:44] still saying like oh I'm saving $500 a thousand dollars guys you locking your

[26:48] money out over the last three years in that money in any other market that you

[26:54] put it in unless you're an idiot like me and bought grubhub stock and in most

[26:59] any other market you would have made much more than you ever would have made or

[27:04] saved on the on the hobbit but look it's a time to celebrate I can't wait to

[27:09] play this game look for my review on it this week I'm really hoping to get

[27:13] out there Tuesday night and do an entire podcast dedicated to how the game plays

[27:17] yeah yeah baby yeah baby it's official dirty donny is working on another

[27:26] stern I love us someone put up a thread that was asking it as if it was a

[27:31] question when dirty donny himself said I'm busy working on another stern which

[27:36] is awesome news the only thing now is what is it gonna be

[27:42] excuse me while I'm Christmas

[28:12] so what is it gonna be it seems like Hendrix iron maiden and aros miss seem to be

[28:26] the three most rumored themes for his next creation I'll say this when it comes

[28:34] to musical pins and themes there's no more of an of a subjective opinion we get

[28:40] from people across the board personally I enjoy these artists I actually had

[28:49] of all three of them the one that I probably listen to the most just in my

[28:53] own life and enjoy the most is is erosmith that being said I always put

[28:58] erosmith like in this enjoyable rock and roll but I never held them up to my

[29:04] favorite band which was guns and roses I never thought they had like the

[29:07] attitude or the edge that G and R had and nobody was cooler than guns for me in

[29:12] the late 80s early 90s that being said erosmith is still like a phenomenal man

[29:18] with tons of great songs but iron maiden I have to say iron maiden started

[29:24] like a band that like I just wasn't really into it all I'm not gonna say

[29:28] anything bad about their music I think some people come on and they they

[29:31] don't like music though they'll just start saying crap like metallic sucks

[29:35] and this and that and iron maiden no way that's terrible an adhander just

[29:40] classic but again I you know I enjoy his songs but I'm not not a guitarist I

[29:44] don't I don't study and love love the material but I will I understand why it's so

[29:49] important and why people do so we'll see what it becomes I am excited that a

[29:56] great artist is working on another pinball first turn what I what I kind of

[30:00] personally hope is that it's not a music pin that he's working on something that

[30:04] is completely unique and outside of what's expected but it as others have

[30:11] said his style does go really well with with music so it's it's anyone's guest

[30:17] at this point I think if Stern has done one thing it's they've done a good job

[30:19] other than ghost busters and spider-man VE and keeping a lid on what the

[30:26] future projects are but I don't you know we'll see what happens I don't even

[30:32] want to speculate on this one I'll just say this when it comes to music I'm

[30:36] gonna cover in another podcast how I think that the music genre that we keep

[30:42] going back to is getting a little long in the tooth for me and kind of boring

[30:46] they're always looking to just classical acts of the same type of music and I

[30:51] wish that they would expand but I want to save that for a separate podcast

[30:55] because I think that's a fruitful discussion that that we should put out there

[31:00] into the into the pinball community and before I wrap up today's podcast I just

[31:05] want to say one thing I am trying as hard as I can to get guests on the show I

[31:09] downloaded call burner that's what everyone recommended I paid for twice and

[31:13] it's not working properly keep saying that it's working in free mode I had

[31:18] Ted on the line he's so nice enough to set up Skype and we were talking but I

[31:24] couldn't record it and I'm trying to figure out an alternative program to

[31:28] call burner so look for that real soon I do want to get you guys on and get

[31:34] back and forth going that's gonna make this talk a lot more interesting and I

[31:39] just want to end this episode and I'm gonna end a bunch of my podcasts with the

[31:43] call to J-pop to see if there's any news on where Magic Girl is and if we're

[31:50] gonna see it and we're gonna end tonight's podcast on an voice message he left

[31:54] me when I asked him if we're gonna see Magic Girl anytime soon good night ladies and gentlemen

[32:02] I don't know

[32:05] I'm so fucking choke up I cannot see straight I'm in that possible fucking

[32:14] situation here once I get Tony on shore there's a distinct possibility that he is

[32:24] a good boss on I've got some plans for me
