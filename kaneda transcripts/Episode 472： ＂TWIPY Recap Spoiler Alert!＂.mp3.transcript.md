[00:00] I love myself, I want you to love me when I'm in doubt

[00:05] I want you to love me, I switch myself

[00:09] I want you to find me, I forget myself

[00:12] I want you to remind me, I don't want anybody else

[00:19] Better think about you, I touch myself

[00:22] Oh, I don't want anybody else

[00:26] Oh, no, oh, no

[00:29] I said I said I said I said I said I said I said I said I said I said I said I said I said I said

[00:34] Well, we've gone three for three for favorite pinball podcasts

[00:38] And I just want to say thank you to everybody out there who voted for Canadian pinball podcast as your favorite pinball podcast

[00:47] I only got one vote, Brenda got one vote, Bubba didn't vote

[00:52] The rest of the people that voted for Canadian pinball podcast were you, the listener of the show

[00:58] So thank you to all the guys and gals out there who voted for Canadian pinball podcast

[01:04] And who would have thought at the very beginning of this show that we would make it to 470s plus shows

[01:11] That we would talk about companies succeeding companies failing, we would entertain and find ways to make pinball content enjoyable on a weekly basis

[01:20] Sometimes cringe worthy, sometimes enjoyable

[01:23] But I know through it all, I've always said this, I feel like I have the best pinball fans on the planet

[01:29] And although it's not always popular to admit you listen to the show

[01:34] It's not always popular to tune into the train wreck every once in a while

[01:38] You still come back and you still support the show and without that support I don't think I would do this

[01:44] So it's always nice to know that every week you guys look forward to the show

[01:49] And I know you get excited when you see a new episode of Canadian pinball podcast and that's why I do it

[01:55] I was just talking to Brenda tonight and she said, do you remember Chris when you said you were going to call it quits after 100 episodes

[02:03] 100, I don't even remember how many years ago that was, we've been doing this now for over 3 years

[02:09] And we're still going and so I want to talk about the awards show, I'm going to go down

[02:13] And we really got some of the greatest information today because Jeff posted how people finished in the voting

[02:20] We now can see the percentages by which people won and lost

[02:24] And I don't really feel like there are any losers, they really aren't

[02:28] But it's actually interesting for the first time to see where people fall

[02:32] Because some of the categories were super competitive

[02:36] And I want to talk about that

[02:38] Obviously talk about Canadians acceptance video a little bit and we'll talk about the show itself

[02:43] So let's just start with the show itself and I want to say I think Carrie and Amodo and Jeff did an amazing job

[02:50] Putting this thing together and creating an atmosphere that felt like watching our favorite awards show

[02:58] And they weren't in the same room at the same time, they used green screen, they used a lot of technology and editing

[03:04] And so many hours went into it, I know Amodo did so much work to put this show together

[03:09] And I just want to say we all should be applauding them for the job well done

[03:13] Now for those of you out there when they announced favorite pinball podcast category after my video aired

[03:19] I know Carrie went on this little canator rant

[03:22] Now I just want to say for the record he was joking

[03:25] Now as I told him if you don't know he's joking and you don't know where friends

[03:31] You don't understand the sarcasm and you can't figure it out

[03:36] It reminded me a lot of when Christopher Franchise stomped on the trophy last year

[03:40] It was like an inside joke and if you're not in on the joke

[03:44] Then you actually think it's a sincere thing happening and it almost makes it awkward and cringe worthy

[03:50] And I think for a lot of my fans they saw that and they actually got upset

[03:55] But I'm here to tell you put down the pitchforks

[03:58] Carrie was only joking

[04:00] And I know it looked like he was raining on my award but he wasn't

[04:04] He didn't mean it that way so let's forgive the man

[04:07] But as I told him like when you do comedy you have to make sure you let the audience in on the joke

[04:14] It's like when you watch my acceptance video you know the whole thing is sarcasm and irreverence

[04:20] So you don't really think that Steve Richie loves me or Dwight and John Borg

[04:26] Think I'm an amazing guy or Joe Balser asked me about hot wheels manufacturing right it's it's all irreverent

[04:33] So did you enjoy the video I enjoyed making that video so I spent a lot of time making that video

[04:38] I had to learn how to use iMovie and I just really wanted to do one thing

[04:43] My my creative brief in my head for my acceptance video was very simply

[04:48] I knew a lot of people were going to do acceptance videos

[04:52] Traditionally and I felt like after everything everyone's going through after being stuck in this New York City apartment for an entire month

[05:01] Staring at months ahead of us

[05:04] Quarantine and social distance all I wanted to do is make people laugh

[05:10] That's it. I think we need laughter now more than ever

[05:13] And that is why I made that video the way I did and that is why I'm so glad they aired it

[05:19] And did not edit out any of it and another reason why you should love carry is carry is the reason why that video remains

[05:28] Unedited he was like people are going to expect this from Chris this is canada he does this stuff

[05:35] I'd love the fact that they put a disclaimer on my video that it did not express the views of the larger this week in Pimbal community

[05:43] Or the committee right which is fine. It's fine

[05:45] It's fine. It's I always want to you know you always want to be the problem with the parental advisory lyrics right that that's those are the cool albums

[05:53] So I'm glad they aired it. I'm glad you enjoyed it

[05:56] I think I've heard nothing but unanimously positive feedback on the video so I put a lot of work into it and I think I think you enjoyed it

[06:04] And I'm really happy you did and you know when I was thinking about it

[06:08] And I think we all did miss the live show a little bit maybe a lot of it for some people

[06:13] I do think doing it that way is also really interesting because you get to look into

[06:20] People's homes their houses you get more of people's ability to think about what they want to say when they win

[06:28] Versus going up to a microphone and it was nice to sort of have all that edited together tightly

[06:35] And it kept the show moving I if that was a live show

[06:39] It would have been like three hours long it just came in a little under two hours

[06:44] But it didn't feel as long as if you're live and everyone has to get up there and it's just not the same

[06:51] I thought they did a really amazing job keeping the pace of the show

[06:55] And let's face it Jean Claude Von Dom dancing just never grows old

[07:00] It just gets better with time and I for those of you

[07:04] I think that is right in the wheelhouse of the target demographic some of the jokes I was pulling from with that video

[07:12] So I'm glad you guys enjoyed it and who knows who knows if we win it a fourth year

[07:17] Maybe I should start thinking about it's way too early right

[07:20] We're going to talk about where do all of us pinball podcasters go because it's just going to be a dry spell over the next few months

[07:28] There's not going to be a lot of news but let's first and foremost say congratulations to all the winners

[07:33] Congratulations to all the nominees

[07:36] Congratulations to everyone who voted

[07:39] Congratulations to all the people who watched live last night and got in on the fun and it was fun

[07:47] Okay now look I will say this

[07:49] I haven't had a drink in a month

[07:52] I drank way too much last night and I had a stupid drunk and rant where I was going off about F this and F that right I think I...

[08:01] Here's my thing, here's my thing

[08:03] When you're drinking and you haven't had dinner and you haven't drunk in a month you get drunk fast

[08:07] And when you're drinking vodka you get drunk fast and you should not drink Louis Trey after you've killed your taste buds with Tito's Vaco

[08:14] Okay now look I don't make more money than Stern employees combined

[08:17] I doubt that's true so that's another fake news from Canada

[08:21] I do think Keith Ellin is the greatest designer but I do think this I do think Keith should have came out and said thank you

[08:27] I do and that's what I was ranting about

[08:29] He should have said thank you he should have he should have came out in front of the camera because people vote for you

[08:34] People vote for you I was going to go to Texas I didn't really want to travel but I was going to go to Texas and I tell this to Brenda

[08:41] It's like I feel like there is an obligation to your fans and they want to see from you they want to hear from you now

[08:47] The thing is I do this show so I know that even though my video wasn't really me saying thank you in that format

[08:54] That I'm going to give you guys multiple multiple audio thank you's in video thank you's I just put up another Facebook live video

[09:02] So that's the thing I just think people should say thank you and and that's that okay now what else did I do?

[09:07] I think I made fun of Mike's house is the ceiling so low that he can't fit a topper and yet Stern sells this these expensive toppers

[09:13] I don't know any of these people personally I don't have anything against them personally and if you want to take the rants of a drunken man at face value so be it

[09:22] And I know we live in a culture now in which people point at you when you're in your worst behavior and they say look at that that's who he is

[09:29] Nope it's not and everyone knows that so look let's talk about this show itself now let's go down a list and we're going to get billweb back on to talk about how we did with our predictions

[09:39] Because there were some upsets but not too many but there were interact it was really interesting to see where things fell with the votes

[09:47] And then I'm also proud to tell you right now I just solidified tonight joining the show I'll wait a wait to tell you when we get to that category

[09:55] Alright how's that sound alright let's go down the list of how the trippy awards were handed out now in the past we have not received percentages for every category

[10:04] And the argument against that was always that it would be discouraging for people who did not get a lot of votes to see where they fell

[10:13] And that Jeff was worried that people might get discouraged and I've said to him like well people should know though like data is data facts or facts and I've said it

[10:22] If you do a pinball podcast or do anything around pinball you have to do it because you enjoy it

[10:28] Like I love doing this show I enjoy doing this show if you do it for the ratings or you do it for an award you will be disappointed

[10:37] You will most likely be disappointed you have to just do it because you enjoy it the awards for me are just byproducts that luckily for me

[10:46] The thing I get to do that I love doing is actually appreciate it by the most people who listen to pinball podcasts and the numbers indicate that

[10:54] And so I think you guys so let's go down best music and sound effects black night sort of rage was the winner in this category with 33% of the votes

[11:05] The next runner up was Jurassic Park with 21.3% Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory 17% Elvira House of Harers with 10%

[11:13] The month there's with 8.4 star wars with 6.1 October fest with 2.4% and cosmic carnival in the rear with 1.6%

[11:24] So you know this is interesting because for me this one I think when you see stuff and you're gonna hear this you're gonna hear this from people

[11:30] Is that Jersey Jack games don't have as many buyers and don't have as many fans as stern games because of the volume

[11:38] So are these results legitimately capturing the quality of these games and I hear I'm here to say I think they do

[11:46] Because I think you see and you see Willy Wonka winning categories which means that it there people want to vote for what they legitimately feels deserves it

[11:56] I totally believe that and so for those of you who think there's a better way to do it I really don't think there is I don't think you should have a committee of just 8 people who get to decide the fate of everything

[12:07] Because then you have to leave out a lot of the other areas of the hobby people love so congratulations to the team over at black night to Steve Richie and Stern Pimball for that win

[12:17] Favorite home broom Pimball machine Jack danger and dead flip one with 31.6% of the vote

[12:23] Spaceballs was runner up with 25.8 followed by Castlevania with 17.8%

[12:30] Metroid 16.2% and Undertale with 8.6%

[12:35] Alright congratulations Jack danger oh my god now Jack's got he won two last night so he's got four twippies

[12:42] I'll never catch him and I think this one too Jack has a huge following so he has an advantage because he has a huge built-in audience that will vote for him by recognition alone

[12:52] But I really do think spaceballs man in Castlevania like and Metroid like really super cool home broom machines and I think everyone would agree that home broom machines are awesome

[13:02] That we love seeing people make home broom machines and congratulations to Jack danger on that win best toys and gimmicks in a game

[13:10] Now this is one that's interesting when you think about the best toys and gimmicks in a game because this is this is where we start to get to that world under glass

[13:19] Like who is mechanically put the most into a game and the winner with 39.8% was Jurassic Park the runner up was Willy Wonka with 23% and black night was third with 11.2% followed by Elvira with 9.5

[13:36] October fest 7.1 monsters 5.3 2.7 for Star Wars and cosmic carnival with 1.3% who voted for cosmic carnival like how do you like they it's like the sun coast team must have made up that 1.3% anyway

[13:50] The thing with toys is interesting because I would argue that the best toys and gimmicks I think the T-Rex just stole the show

[13:58] And if you were to ask like what was the single greatest toy in Pimbal it was the T-Rex mechanism without a doubt I would argue that Willy Wonka the collectiveness of the toys and gimmicks is probably better than Jurassic Park but it doesn't have that one wow feature

[14:14] And I think Wonka had a chance with it. I really do I think if Wonka had used the Wonka Vader or even the Wonka vision I think to me the Wonka vision is the one that just net they just didn't really implement it the best way

[14:27] And I think that's why the T-Rex with with a you know grabbing the ball throwing the ball biting the ball the ball goes up into the T-Rex mouth

[14:34] I think that T-Rex deserves the win so congratulations to Stern to Keith L-Win and the team who put that game together all right Mike as well the favorite Pimbal location

[14:43] Logan arcade and the Pimbal Palace they battled it out now. I know the Pimbal Palace was was lobbying strong for votes

[14:50] And they came in in second place with 24% of the vote Logan arcade won with 27% followed then there's a drop off a lot of these got like between 9% and 4%

[15:00] And I'm not going to read them all but very very tight race at the top there for the favorite Pimbal location

[15:08] Favorite Pimbal publication writer or article Pimbal magazine coin up carnival 11 point so Pimbal magazine won with 29.2% Jonathan

[15:20] Juston congratulations man lock goes into making that magazine a coin up carnival got 20% skillshot Pimbal Zeen 15.9% just beat out Dennis Creasel

[15:32] who got 15.7% see this is where it gets interesting to be because for a lot of people out there being in the top three means a lot and it should mean a lot

[15:42] It is incredible to make it into the top three of any of these categories for all of these votes right and so Dennis Creasel

[15:50] Missed by 0.2% people this is why every vote counts it gets down to the wire to get into the top category and then we had and all these so 15.9% got

[16:05] Skill shot into the top three Dennis missed by 0.2% and then after that pen game journal got 15% so they only missed it by less than a percentage and then you know that's so close

[16:19] So if you are thinking next year should I vote or not and you have something that means a lot to you yes you should

[16:27] Alright best theme best theme I think everyone really felt this was going to take it and it did willy Wonka and the chocolate factory congratulations it is the best theme it is the best theme the second best theme was Jurassic Park willy Wonka got 32.4%

[16:42] Jurassic Park got 33.7% Elvira got 14.3 Black Knight as a better theme than monsters got 9.3% Black Knight as a better than October Fest

[16:55] Here's what's crazy how how is this possible October Fest beat Star Wars for best theme think about that for a minute this wasn't best

[17:04] Them integration it was in best new pin it was just best theme October Fest is a better theme than Star Wars according to this list unbelievable and then cosmic carnival at 2% got some more support I don't I don't want to make fun I don't want to make fun but it's just it's we've already had our digs we already had enough of

[17:24] Canada's you know negative side for for for one week alright favorite pinball competitive player Keith L win wins it with 25.5% congratulations Keith Bowen Karen's second place with 16.5% Jack danger with 13.3% Steve Bowden 10.5%

[17:45] and this is close you got holly got 9% Johannes got 7.4 Robert Gagnon got 5.5 Eric Stone you know and then it goes on but you know you have to like sort of like your top guys and these are your top guys and it wasn't a surprise that they were up there but congratulations to Keith favorite pinball convention

[18:04] tpf above everyone else with 24.7% of the votes replay effects with 17 point 17% and then Chicago pinball expo with 16% and then it goes on from there mini minuest gaming classic 9% I'm not going to read all these for everyone guys is too much but but here's what's

[18:22] interesting with these right in categories if you'll notice because when we get to podcast you'll see how much can you to one by when you get to the ones where there's like 10 people there's 10 in the drop down menu it

[18:33] thins out how much you win by because there's the votes can go in a lot of different directions which again which again I think makes it get very competitive for those

[18:43] 3rd and 4th and 5th spots and 2nd spots alright so best theme integration now here's a thing if you win best theme you want that to win best

[18:53] theme integration like walk is the best theme was it integrated the best it got second place walk it got second place with 21.9%

[19:01] the best theme integration went to Jurassic Park with 33.9% 3rd place was Elvira house of horrors and then we had monsters October fest black night star wars and cosmic carnival at the bottom I mean cosmic carnival just took a shell

[19:18] they told Jeff like if you don't want to discourage people with percentages for podcasts but you're just going to let the sun coast people get annihilated in every single category but it is what it is I this is interesting to me this is important to see how popular things are now this part is no surprise the favorite

[19:38] symbol website and this this site ran away with it and I knew this would happen and it was easy to predict this because pin side is above and beyond the most popular the most engaged site the most utilize site it's it's the hangout it's where most people hang out it got

[19:56] 1.4% second place was this week in pinball was 16.5% so if you look at numbers like that you're like there's no way in hell it will ever lose there's nothing and that's in a category with a lot of right in it goes this week in

[20:12] 3.3 is match play events with 8.2% then IPDB 7.2 and then it's like everything else is around 4% 3% best and well first of all congratulations robin we need to congratulate robin I mean we ever feelings about pin side but I've said it before without

[20:28] pin side there's no place to hang out with everybody on a daily basis that's awesome and as much as sometimes we wish they would moderate it better it's still the greatest pinball website it's still without without pin side most people wouldn't get back into this hobby there's something about that site that galvanizes and creates a community it's a community and you know that and you know that you know that when you're on there and you're avatar and you're a little name and your image it means something it's

[20:57] signifies who you are in that online community the same way when you go into your office at work they know who you are by your name in your face and that's the same thing that happens on pin side and the way robin has the threads it's it's brilliant it's brilliantly done it's perfectly set up for our ADD culture in which we're constantly bumping the hot topics to the top I mean it just works so well so well done well done robin well deserved to the pin side staff and all the

[21:27] moderators who do a good enough job keeping that site going all right and congratulations to all you pinheads on pin side because without your

[21:36] reverence and humor and ignorance and intelligence that site wouldn't be interesting so you all should take a bow

[21:43] for being the most ridiculous motley crew ever assembled of grown men and some women because it is fun to go on there and read it when you're going in the bathroom that's what it's made for that's when you should read it okay

[21:57] let's keep going here best animations and display this one was super close I think this one was one of the closest categories of the night and I did not think it would win but Willy Wonka I had it a second place Willy Wonka won with 23.6% of the vote second place with 23.3% was Jurassic Park black night sort of rage was number three with 19.9%

[22:25] followed by Elvira medieval madness monsters star wars October fest and cosmic carnival at the bottom okay well congratulations to to to I wish I knew that I his name is escaping me right now but he's he's an incredible

[22:41] animator I think it's John is a jump all and he's he he has done such amazing work on Jersey Jack games and he is he makes that screen come to life I think everyone

[22:52] agrees with that and it's well deserved victory for him all right if I got his name wrong I'm sorry I will I will correct it on my next show but I'm in the middle I don't want to pause right now

[23:00] rookie of the year rookie of the year Tim sexting with 20.8% and I think he deserves it he actually put work into a game and had something to do that made an impact in the pinball industry

[23:13] followed by Jack danger with 15.7% and Zach and Nicole many as distributors with 12.4% Johnny Crap Randy Martinez loser kid

[23:23] Christopher Franchie Lauren Gray Brad Albright poor man and Joel they goosmon alright favorite pinball tournament or competition

[23:31] this is another one there's like a runaway victory for pinburg with 47.8% almost everyone else just huge drop off

[23:37] I have PA was next Texas wizards tournament those were the top three but tournament man pinburg is just got it on lockdown easily easily the best now this

[23:47] one was interesting best call outs now what I love about these categories is when you get to certain elements of a game when we die of a

[23:54] little deeper see these are the categories I love because it does get us to deconstruct these games a little bit and it gets us the

[24:00] highlight elements that are really important in making a pinball experience amazing and so call outs are one of the most

[24:07] important parts of bringing you into that world and so Elvira house a horrors with Cassandra herself doing these call outs one with 30.1% and I

[24:18] think that's great because she does a lot of custom call outs for the game that's what we want in pinball and I'm glad to see the

[24:24] community agrees number two is another game with a lot of great custom call outs from Steve Richie and that's black night 27.6% followed by

[24:32] Stern Jersey Jurassic Park 13.9% and not on this list and this is as I said the reason why I think this show and I think I

[24:42] said this on my Facebook show the this week in pinball twippy awards are really important for market research for pinball

[24:50] companies if I'm a pinball manufacturer and I'm a pinball company I want to know what the people are

[24:56] gravitating towards I want to know what they like what they're voting for and I want to know how if I'm a

[25:01] manufacturer how is my game doing where did my game win where did it shine and where did it fall down because this is the kind

[25:09] of market research that can only help pinball manufacturers get better and I'm glad Jeff is sharing all this because without

[25:16] knowing those numbers they wouldn't know where they fall now not near the top three for best it's number four but it

[25:24] didn't make it in the top three was Willie Wonka with 13.4% and I think it shows like now one element of

[25:31] Wonka that could use work or or Jersey Jack aim are the call outs I think they nailed the call outs in

[25:37] Pirates the Caribbean but the call outs really needed work in dialed in they really need it work in Willie

[25:42] Wonka now here's the takeaway for me notice a pattern here the call outs within pat launder games have been weak

[25:51] and they need to work on that and that's one of the elements where pat's amazing at design but there's something about call

[25:58] outs that he's struggling with right now and I think he needs help making the call outs in the machines better

[26:04] and and that's not to take away from the game this is like one of the weaker areas of Willie Wonka that it's not me

[26:10] saying it it's also the people so favorite pinball YouTube channel another this one again the top this one was like

[26:18] I think one of the most competitive because the top three were so close and I think people were surprised but winning it

[26:25] was Papa pinball with 26.9% so congrats to the team over at Papa 23.2% was straight down the middle a pinball show that

[26:36] Zach and Greg's show and 22.6% TNT amusements okay now here's what's interesting about this category and why every vote matters

[26:46] is those three those three top finalists they were separated by less than 5% of votes so 7.3% went to flipping out pinball

[26:59] now those votes had gone to TNT or straight down the middle those they would have won

[27:04] Carrie Hardy 6.4% which means if his listeners have voted for someone else he could have his voters could have pushed Zach to the front

[27:15] or Todd Tucky to the front right I told Carrie I'm like you're the Ralph Nader of pinball YouTube channels because you cost like

[27:23] other people the victory but no these were the votes these were the votes it's not who you think is the best it's

[27:27] it's an aggregation of everyone's votes so there's no there's no right or wrong answer here this is how the people voted

[27:34] you know in a mode port of a moto had 3.4% pin and this like I could see how chaz is arcade and gameplay

[27:40] restorations at 1.2% but chaz's stuff is mainly arcade so I don't think he looks at this like oh you

[27:46] know what all right favorite pinball mod this one I was surprised by this one I was surprised by because

[27:51] if you look at this mod there are a lot of cool mods out there and I'm not gonna crap on winners but

[27:56] I'll just say this the amber shooter rod mod is really cool in Jurassic Park until this my one thing

[28:02] you realize that it's lit by two lights that are underneath it shining up like like maybe that's

[28:09] how they had to do it but I'm sure they could have figured it out if the mod community had made it

[28:14] they would have made it a little bit cleaner than that but anyway congratulations to George Gomez

[28:19] and the team that worked on that mod it's very cool you deserve it you guys are the best you guys

[28:23] ran away with the show come on you I got to take some some cheap shots when I can the amber Jurassic

[28:31] Park shooter rod had 20.1% followed by the chess mod for Jersey Jack pinball a pie to the Caribbean

[28:38] at 12.9 and then willy-wonka wonka factory had 12% by the mod couple followed by the raptor pin stadium

[28:45] okay then it goes the list goes on all right so congratulations Jurassic Park right best light show

[28:50] okay here we go all right so here we go again with that ever important data like I was talking about

[28:56] because this shows you like what you're really doing right and where you need to improve with

[29:01] with your games and so willy-wonka wins best light show with 40.3% of the votes wow like that means

[29:10] if I'm jack all right we're nailing it on theme we're nailing it on light show where else are we

[29:16] really nailing it all right we're really weak in callouts so whoever's doing the callouts over

[29:20] in the Jersey Jack coding department you know let's let's we got to up our callout game it's

[29:25] where were we um followed by black knight with 15 I mean ran away with it 15.4% for black knight and

[29:33] then 11.6% for Jurassic Park followed by a viral medieval man as monsters star wars cosmic carnival beat

[29:41] October fest in this one okay I think that deserves a separate award in which cosmic carnival

[29:47] bested October fest for best light show amazing god there's so many categories favorite pinball

[29:52] streamer a dead flip again ran away with it jack danger my god my man you you just crushed it

[29:59] with 46.7% of the votes second was flipping out pinball with 12.2% and 9.8% was pop a TV pinball

[30:08] so congrats to you three Buffalo pinball came in fourth close a close fourth with 8.9% so

[30:15] congratulations Jack congratulations Ken and the team over at flipping out and as I've said they're

[30:20] just totally different types of shows totally different types of audiences I don't think any of this

[30:26] is an indication of of who's better than who it's just completely different types of content favorite

[30:32] pinball league was very close now these are the ones where like you know people really had a lobby

[30:36] for votes it's like you either activate your community or you don't you activate your league to vote

[30:42] you've got a lobby here you've got a lobby because a lot of people have no opinions about these

[30:47] categories when you get to the local stuff like favorite pinball league a lot of people might have

[30:52] left these categories blank we're not seeing total number of votes but I want to say it was so

[30:57] awesome to see bells and chimes out of San Antonio Texas take this one and finally having some female

[31:04] representation other than a moto into the award show which was great which was great and other

[31:10] than keeps I don't know this keeps white for girlfriend was on the videos but you know there wasn't

[31:13] there weren't many females represent it last night so bells and chimes congratulations to your

[31:20] victory here followed by New England pinball league with 12.7% and tilt town or tidal town sorry

[31:27] tidal town pinball in Wisconsin with 11.6% and all I mean look all these leagues are great

[31:33] and then it goes from there but this is very competitive there's so many with like six there was

[31:36] there was like one two three four five five of them had six point nine percent five percent two

[31:41] percent very close so best rules wow best rules this is another one and I've been this is what I've

[31:47] been saying people market research coming from this what can you extract from this best rules how

[31:54] important is code in pinball it is probably the most important thing that makes a game staying

[31:59] your house it's probably the most important thing that pulls you into the world of that theme right

[32:03] other than the mechanical stuff which we don't get on anything anymore the best rules in pinball

[32:07] unanimously and this is where I think people spoke and what I've been saying about these games

[32:12] Jurassic Park destroyed destroys Willy Wonka with 56.9% of the vote not even close not even close

[32:23] Willy Wonka was second was 16.1% this is what I've been saying Wonka has the best theme but not

[32:31] integrated and the rules of the game it's just not whoa black knight was third was 7.1% followed

[32:37] by an incomplete Elvira October Fest monster Star Wars and then again 1.2% cosmic carnival again

[32:43] gets to the bottom of the heat so congratulations to Keith Owen and Stern for that I mean Keith's like

[32:48] you know again he designs the rules set and the game at the same time which is why I think you see

[32:53] the love of fear for his machines favorite pinball topper black knight sort of rage just beat out

[32:59] medieval man is 29.2% versus medieval man is is 25.3% in third place surprisingly this Star Wars

[33:06] R2D2 topper the $750 three years of the making monstrosity and then Alice Cooper monsters I'm

[33:14] surprised monsters was that low Jurassic Park topper Beatles and okay was and then 3D hoggerman

[33:21] Beatles all right favorite pinball podcasts introduced by macho pinball now look I know I might have

[33:26] I might have dropped some expletives about macho on my drunken rant and I'll say this macho

[33:31] you're entertaining there's no bad blood I know your troll huntin I'm a little nervous it's

[33:37] gonna be like was the intercontinental title what's it I feel like it's like the hardcore championship

[33:42] I love that WCW days where you had to defend yourself at all times like you could lose the belt

[33:46] anywhere at any time but macho thank you for the introduction of this podcast category I were

[33:53] people able to see on his screens in the background who he was as macho man bone carons who is he

[33:59] who is he we should offer a cash reward to out him because I feel like once he's outed I don't

[34:03] know if you can keep doing it but it's more fun not knowing who he is so can a dispimball podcast we

[34:07] won with 27.9% of the votes followed by this week in pinball 18.8% congratulations to Zach as

[34:15] that was his show and special when lit I was so happy to see billen kenshow special when lit make

[34:22] it into the top three and I eight eleven point eight percent and I know that they're honored to

[34:28] be in the top three and and they should be and we all miss the show I know the show's not coming

[34:33] back I believe me I asked bill today's come on the fans want it back like let's bring it back I

[34:39] think there's some shake up happening in the pinball content world that we're gonna hear about

[34:42] over the next few weeks I don't know what it is I really hope we get Jason Fowler back I hope we

[34:47] get slap save or some form of it back I hope I hope I hope I hope more of the shows that sort of

[34:54] change direction or win away come back that people love I do the after special when lit bro do you

[34:59] even talk pinball was fourth followed by head to head now head to head was pretty much second

[35:04] place last year and and if you're Marty you know he's he's he's gone in a different direction

[35:09] and I think everyone agrees like the show when Ryan left the show it was just it was just never

[35:12] quite the same but there they were with seven point four percent loser kid five point one backbox

[35:18] slam till pinball profile poor man's and at the bottom Christopher franchise is super awesome

[35:23] pinball show podcast but again that's a brand new show to brand new show the poor man shows been

[35:28] excellent excellent show slam tilt excellent show I mean these guys are they're all so different half

[35:34] of them don't even ask for votes half of them don't want votes half of them don't lobby for votes

[35:38] you know can a dispin ball podcast we selfishly go on this campaign every year like it's a

[35:42] presidential election all right best artwork we're gonna close this out best artwork Christopher

[35:47] franchise ship came in with the monsters well deserved Christopher fransi at 24.9% will he

[35:53] walk a number two which is great again you made a beautiful game with a beautiful light show with

[35:58] a beautiful theme with beautiful displays walk a one a lot in in terms of where it fell in categories

[36:05] and even if it didn't finish first it finished a close to first as in most categories and so I

[36:12] really do think if people were to let me summarize that when I finished the next two but I'll

[36:17] summarize where I think wonka falls within the year but third place for best artwork was a

[36:22] viral followed by star wars comic edition black night and these were close these were like 17%

[36:28] 1412 so it got really close it got really close best play field gameplay and layout unanimously

[36:36] Jurassic Park now this is one where I would say 53.6% of the vote went to Jurassic Park 18% to

[36:45] willy-wonka 9.1% to all viral so you're telling me that Jurassic Park gameplay and layout is

[36:54] almost 40 points greater than wonka then the pat lawler I think pat law are designed an amazing game

[37:02] but this is the votes so I wouldn't walk away I just think there's a popularity of Keith

[37:08] L. Wynn versus pat lawler a Keith L. Wynn is the new pat lawler for a lot of people he's the new

[37:14] blood he's the new kid in town and and I think people might look at pat a little bit like he's

[37:20] been around forever like he's made them most the best selling pit mom machine of all time I eat and

[37:25] they want to see Keith win these things and again this is why I just wanted Keith to come in front

[37:30] of the camera and say thank you that's it I was drunk it didn't mean to be a jerk Keith sorry if

[37:34] you're mad at me game of the year game of the year Jurassic Park again crushes the competition with

[37:41] 48.7% willy-wonka number two with 20.8% Elvira number three followed by black night

[37:48] monsters octoberfest starware okay so here's what I want to say about 2019 overall overall

[37:53] there weren't that many great games there really weren't if you look at the way that these votes

[37:59] tallied up there really it was really Jurassic Park and willy-wonka were were predominantly the only

[38:06] real games that were in contention for most categories that matter so why is it and then I walked

[38:12] away from even when I was voting I don't know how you felt but I I just felt like 2019 was a

[38:17] little bit of an off year for pinball in terms of giving you a lot of what you want it I don't think

[38:22] there were a ton of stellar themes I don't think there were a ton of stellar games and if I'm looking

[38:29] at this market research that is free for everyone now and I'm deep root I'm like we can win in this

[38:35] market play this is what this is what we're up against we have a chance if I'm if I'm CGC I'm

[38:42] feeling the same way where's Chicago gaming company there nowhere in here spooky pinball nowhere

[38:48] in here right Rick and Morty is gonna be next year's award show where will it fall I could see

[38:53] Rick and Morty winning a lot of these categories light show best theme best theme integration right I

[39:00] think spooky is gonna have a really good year but who knows I mean and their game is out kind of

[39:06] right there's about 70 out there who knows when manufacturing begins again but this is this is

[39:12] why I love this show I love aggregating it all I love recognizing all the talent because what this

[39:17] show does is it does tell you what's working and what's not and we shouldn't and this is my thing

[39:23] with this show and this is the thing about canada we shouldn't shy away from what's not working we

[39:27] shouldn't hide data that might make some people feel discouraged or embarrassed or feel like they're

[39:33] they didn't do a good job and in a part of a game because they learn from that everyone learns and

[39:40] you you improve in life when you know where you stand within these categories if you're these

[39:44] pinball manufacturers and if I'm American pinball then this is why you you you people give me crap

[39:50] because I crap on American pinball and and I have like an agenda no they they are failing at pinball

[39:57] they are failing at pinball they put a lot of money into October Fest and look at where it landed

[40:03] it failed and so I don't understand how you walk away from these kinds of awards in which the people

[40:12] who buy your products are telling you what they like and you're so far at the bottom and the same

[40:18] as like with suncoast it's like I get you wanted to make a pinball machine but you just didn't give

[40:23] the people what they wanted and the people you the listener of the show the people will vote with

[40:30] their wallets what they want in this industry because these things are not cheap and they'll also

[40:36] vote with their ears and their brains and their eyes and their minds and that's why I think

[40:41] canada does well because I think we give you a commentary that is a little different and and we'll

[40:47] say that I mean this is a night where there are going to be some people that are going to walk

[40:52] away feeling dejected and good because when you get dejected and you get ignored and you get

[40:59] left out you get mad and if you're if you're smart you want to improve and you want to get better

[41:07] and you want to climb up this leaderboard in a way who because people I think people are lying when

[41:13] they say they don't want to be voted popular I think that's a lie everyone wants to be popular

[41:20] on some level and if you're making a product whether it's content or a machine you want to be

[41:26] recognized that's just human nature I didn't make that the way of the universe of the way the world

[41:32] works so look it was a great night if you haven't seen the show I just spoiled everything for you

[41:36] so I apologize but look you should go watch the show I should put a disclaimer watch the

[41:42] twippy's first I'm gonna put spoilers in the headline like twippy thank you spoilers okay so you'll

[41:47] know but anyway everyone thank you again so much we're in for a rough a rough few months everyone

[41:55] knows it stay safe I walk through New York City tonight and it's hard it's hard not to tear up to see

[42:03] the city this beautiful city the city that is energetic with with all these people it's like nobody's

[42:10] out nobody's out we do this amazing thing at seven o'clock at night everyone starts clapping

[42:15] outside their windows as a thank you to the medical professionals out there and it's it's it's

[42:20] gut wrenching it makes you happy knowing that we're all trapped in these boxes trying to get out

[42:25] and we can't and we have we had a special night it was it was it was it was great to recognize

[42:30] the finest in pinball and it's just nice to be a part of a community that can connect and we found

[42:36] a way to connect and and it was great and it was fun being in the chat and I think everyone had a

[42:40] good time if people want to walk away and find new reasons to hate canada they will I can't stop that

[42:45] don't hate carry hearty I think Jeff did a great job a moto did a great job everyone should feel

[42:49] proud of themselves everyone at these pinball companies should feel proud if you won

[42:54] should feel proud if you came close to winning but if man if you were at the bottom of those

[42:58] categories got work to do you got work to do don't be discouraged get better get better and some

[43:06] of these games aren't even done a virus not even close to being done lineman sheets will make it a

[43:10] great game but it's just lineman games are always sort of those they're expensive they take a long

[43:15] time to finish but like a fine wine when a lineman sheets game is done I guarantee you it'll have

[43:22] better code than almost anything else but he just have to wait it's just his games are not

[43:27] engineered to win in these kinds of kinds of windows of popularity he will never win a game in a

[43:32] window of popularity in which you get voted on the year your game is out because his games are

[43:37] always going to take 18 months or more to mature it's just his style but it's always worth it and

[43:43] we know that so he just you know people like lineman and I was going to say this um I didn't say

[43:48] this in the category sorry Todd Tucky is coming on the show we're talking Tuesday night because I

[43:54] think people like Todd Tucky are people like lineman sheets what they need to add to the Twippies to

[43:58] improve it they need lifetime achievement awards for best coder to lineman sheets lifetime achievement

[44:05] award for content Todd Tucky we need those kinds of awards George Gomez should being honored you

[44:10] got to honor these people who are above the the yearly recognition because they've just done so much

[44:18] for pinball and I think people would love to see that kind of recognition every year you create a

[44:23] few special awards that honor the best and maybe it's in the decade right every 2020 would have been

[44:30] a good time to be like the best of the decade goes to so and so I think nobody would argue that

[44:37] lineman sheets has been the best coder in the last 10 years nobody would argue right and yet I

[44:41] don't think he has any any twippies and does he I don't know anyway everyone be safe be healthy we'll

[44:49] be back this week with more content and then who knows what we're going to do in the weeks to come

[44:53] I got a few more exposés on shows or sorry exposés shows plan about companies but then I'm telling you

[44:59] man there's me nothing I told Jeff it's not going to be this week in pinball this the TW IP is going

[45:05] to stand for this week in popcorn he's gonna have to change what he talks about and just review

[45:09] different popcorns because people are just sitting home watching movies all day long and there's

[45:12] no new games coming out for months think about that people months can canate it keep you entertained

[45:18] I don't know we'll see have a great day everyone

[45:35] you see just how much I don't you don't know where you're going to wait for you

[45:41] I don't want anybody else where I think you're going to trust myself I don't want anybody else

[45:53] where I think you're going to trust myself
