[00:00] Uh oh, we're in trouble, something's come along and it's burst of bubble.

[00:06] Yeah, yeah.

[00:07] Uh oh, we're in trouble, gotta get hungry, much of the trouble.

[00:14] Sit-a-sit-a, sit-a-sit-a, sit-a-sit-a, sit-a-sit-a.

[00:18] Alright, the wait is finally over, not you getting a podcast from Canada about this game,

[00:25] but the wait to see Harry Potter pinball, probably the most anticipated pinball machine

[00:32] in the history of Jersey Jack pinball, 12 years plus in the making, the passion from

[00:40] the team came through in the featurette video I just watched, and I've been really taking

[00:47] my time about this show because I wanted to absorb as much as I could.

[00:53] I wanted to hear from them, I wanted to read people's response to this game on pinside,

[01:00] I wanted to look at the game, look at the features, and look at everything we know to

[01:06] date, look at the price, look at the art, look at the mechanisms, look at the video,

[01:12] look at the, or hear the sound, and I wanted to gather as much as I could before I formulated

[01:20] my own opinion.

[01:21] Now before I go into all this stuff and I can't wait to share with you how I feel about

[01:26] this game, I just want to say, you know, they're going to sell a ton of these machines.

[01:33] Theme alone is going to move this game.

[01:36] Theme alone, doesn't matter about the artwork, we're going to talk about it, it doesn't matter

[01:41] about mechanisms, doesn't matter about anything they went over in the featurette.

[01:45] You make a Harry Potter pinball machine, you make it available for sale, and it's going

[01:51] to sell.

[01:52] Like I absolutely think this game is going to be on every location site in the world.

[01:58] I think it's going to be in a lot of people's homes.

[02:01] I think a lot of people that grew up with these books and these movies are going to buy this

[02:06] game.

[02:07] It will be the best selling game in the history of Jersey Jack pinball easily, easily.

[02:15] So I'm really happy for Jack that he got this license.

[02:18] I think it was extremely difficult to get.

[02:21] I'm happy that, you know, when you watch the featurette video, the passion of the team,

[02:27] Eric's personal story about his not wife at the time, future wife, going to drive an hour.

[02:35] I don't know how you could live an hour from a bookstore, but apparently that's how long

[02:39] it takes in Wisconsin to go find a bookstore from where he was.

[02:44] And you know, it's just great to see all of these people feeling so passionate about

[02:51] a game because in the end, I mean this in the end, what people buy into.

[02:56] And this happens in my industry.

[02:58] It happens in life.

[03:00] People don't buy into your ideas.

[03:03] They don't buy the tactics.

[03:06] And you know what I'm saying?

[03:07] Like a tactic in the pinball world is a mechanism.

[03:10] A tactic in the pinball world is a mode.

[03:14] What they buy into, and there's not enough of this in pinball, what they buy into is

[03:19] the passion of the people.

[03:21] They want to support the people that they connect with over the energy and the passion

[03:28] and the enthusiasm.

[03:29] That is why a company like Spooky Pinball, you know, could put out sometimes like B level

[03:34] games and they sell them because people connect with the passion of the team over there.

[03:40] So I just want to say as someone who's spent over 25 years, you know, working on ideas

[03:46] and in the creative field, which is a hard industry to be in because it's very subjective.

[03:51] People have very strong opinions about the things you will create.

[03:55] I just want to say it was great seeing the level of passion by this team.

[04:00] And I really, really, really feel like a lot of people out there, it just makes you feel

[04:06] good seeing people in this kind of mood, making this kind of thing and giving it to us.

[04:13] It's an honor to sometimes be able to buy something that is someone's heart and soul

[04:18] went into it.

[04:19] It's almost like you're absorbing a little bit of their dream, their lifelong dream,

[04:24] and they've made it a tangible thing you can now own.

[04:28] Okay, so I just want to say on that level, I'm very happy for this team.

[04:33] I also want to say on another level, I think this community is maybe the most gaslit community

[04:40] I've ever seen.

[04:41] I really mean this.

[04:42] And I'm going to talk about it through the context of the game and what I mean by that.

[04:47] And this is the thing.

[04:48] It's like words to me matter, like words matter.

[04:51] And if you're going to say stuff, and this is the other thing when I was watching the

[04:54] feature at video, I felt deja vu to avatar a little bit video because I was like, here

[05:00] we go again.

[05:01] Like they're kind of saying things and using words that are very hyperbolic, like they're

[05:08] very dramatic.

[05:09] Like you're going to have the most intense match of quidditch ever.

[05:12] Okay, and then you see it and you're like, are you seeing the most intense thing you've

[05:17] seen in a pinball action sequence or like some sort of dramatic movement of the ball?

[05:23] Okay, we're going to get into it.

[05:24] I'm going to get into it, but I just want to say words matter.

[05:27] And so when you use words like the most intense and you use words like ultra limited, when

[05:35] you use words like loaded and packed, like you start using these words and people are

[05:42] saying stuff like this is the most loaded game ever.

[05:46] And I'm like, okay, well, let me ask those people who are saying this game is packed.

[05:50] If this game is packed, then what is Twilight Zone?

[05:56] What is Theater of Magic?

[05:59] What is Godzilla?

[06:01] What is Wizard of Oz?

[06:03] What is dialed in?

[06:05] How are we just throwing words out that should mean something?

[06:11] And what's amazing to me as someone who's covered this hobby for 12 years and knows the products

[06:19] intimately of the last 30, 40 years, what's interesting to me.

[06:25] And again, the reason I use the word gas latest, again, it's because I just think sometimes when

[06:30] a new game comes out and it's not just this game, I think when a new game comes out, people

[06:35] look at it in a vacuum like nothing else has ever come out.

[06:39] Like what are we even comparing stuff to anymore?

[06:43] And I just want to say on a broad stroke level, what I think has happened in pinball and these

[06:49] companies have been very successful changing the perspective of the buyer and changing the

[06:56] expectations of what we expect to see under that glass.

[07:00] They've changed it.

[07:01] See in the 90s, these games were made to be so magical under the glass because in the

[07:08] 90s, they had to put so much physical world under glass to pull you away from arcade machines.

[07:17] Remember, they had to get people's attention away from stuff like Street Fighter and Donkey

[07:23] Kong and Punch Out and Daytona USA and Mad Dog McCree and Dragon's Lair and Tron.

[07:29] You know, they got all the games that were in an arcade back in the 90s, Neo Geo, everything

[07:34] that was in there.

[07:35] They needed to get money.

[07:38] And so by doing that, they packed those machines with so much mechanical wow that, you know,

[07:45] when you stood over it, you were like OMG, like I wonder what that does OMG, look at that.

[07:51] And they didn't have an LCD screen.

[07:53] Now times have changed.

[07:55] Where games are packed now is not under the glass.

[07:59] Where these games are packed now.

[08:01] And this is the shift that's happened in pinball.

[08:04] They're packed now in the software, in the code, right?

[08:09] 96 mini modes in this game.

[08:12] Yeah.

[08:13] 96.

[08:14] That is insane.

[08:16] And if you're a Harry Potter fan, that's awesome, right?

[08:18] You want to see all the scenes from the movie.

[08:22] You want to experience all those memorable moments.

[08:25] And this game has it all, right?

[08:27] So it is like an encyclopedia of all the moments of Harry Potter.

[08:31] So that's incredible.

[08:33] I'm just that alone.

[08:34] If you're a Potter fan and you hear 96 modes of all the moments, I love.

[08:42] You're buying this game.

[08:44] You could turn this podcast off right now.

[08:48] It doesn't matter.

[08:49] And you should buy it.

[08:50] And you should enjoy it.

[08:52] And nothing anybody says in this world should ever take away from your enjoyment of the

[08:59] thing you love.

[09:01] And they're giving you 96 modes.

[09:03] That's incredible.

[09:04] There's not 96 modes in Twilight Zone or Indiana Jones or Star Trek, the next generation, right?

[09:11] Toad in.

[09:12] Those games get old real fast because you can get through everything.

[09:15] Medieval Madness, you know, Attack from Mars 96.

[09:19] That's like every single Balli Williams game combined in one Jersey Jack game.

[09:25] So you're getting your money's worth in the software area.

[09:29] Somebody had to code those 96 modes.

[09:31] I mean, think about that.

[09:32] The team of people that had to do that, that had to make all the lights sync up with each

[09:38] sequence of that mode.

[09:40] The ton of people that had to create the music, David Thiele's music, he had to do something

[09:44] for every one of those modes.

[09:46] That's where the 10 to $15,000 is going to now.

[09:50] And so I hope as you hear this podcast, people, you understand, I'm just observing what I

[09:56] think has happened in this hobby.

[09:58] And I'm also not angry or mad.

[10:00] You know, I'm not screaming about any of this.

[10:02] It doesn't bother me anymore.

[10:04] I just think what we have now as a product is so different than what it used to be, but

[10:11] we don't know how to change the verbiage.

[10:14] And that's the thing that I think is really interesting that nobody else really even wants

[10:18] to address.

[10:19] Like none of the other content creators like talk like this, they either say like nasty

[10:24] stuff about the game.

[10:25] Like I saw one of them was like, this is clown puke.

[10:28] Like, come on.

[10:29] Are we really resorting to like juvenile ways to insult a product like this?

[10:35] I think we can all grow up a little bit and just talk about it in a much more mature way.

[10:41] So I just think that so much has changed, but we haven't changed the way we talk about

[10:46] games.

[10:47] And is this game packed?

[10:49] It's yes and no.

[10:50] Like this game is packed with software, but it's not packed mechanically.

[10:56] But when people say this game is packed and the way that phrase has typically been used

[11:02] is to say that it's got a lot of mechanical and physical wow in the game.

[11:08] It's got a lot of toys.

[11:10] And I just want to say no on that level.

[11:14] This game is pretty barren.

[11:16] And it's more of what people were telling me that this game is more Godfather and Avatar

[11:22] than it is Pirates of the Caribbean.

[11:25] And that's the truth.

[11:28] If you think I'm wrong, then tell me in this game mechanically, the most impressive item

[11:36] in the game is a ball diverter.

[11:40] Okay, it spins, it diverts the ball, the staircase, it diverts it 13 different ways.

[11:47] What I love about Jersey Jack is they always like go overboard with numbers that almost

[11:53] make you feel more overwhelmed than excited.

[11:56] Like I don't really need 13 different ball paths.

[12:01] Like I get a lot of excitement out of the ramp in Toten that I think diverts the ball

[12:06] three different ways.

[12:08] But the three different ways it goes are very magical.

[12:11] 13 to me isn't enjoyable because it's too many.

[12:17] It's like I kind of want to have somewhat of a sense of I'm going to know where the

[12:20] ball is going to go.

[12:21] Okay, so 13 different ways the ball can go.

[12:26] Okay, after that mech, where is the next wow mechanism in the game?

[12:33] I'll wait.

[12:34] I'll wait for all those people on pin side that said this game is loaded.

[12:38] It's packed.

[12:39] There's so much in it.

[12:41] It's a home run.

[12:42] They knocked it out of the park.

[12:43] Okay, what's the next thing?

[12:44] I'll wait.

[12:45] Okay, tell me what is the next thing?

[12:47] Is it the balls being locked on the wands?

[12:50] Is that a magical wow moment where it passes through the cauldron?

[12:55] It's just dropping a ball through the cauldron.

[12:59] That's it.

[13:00] The ball doesn't disappear in that cauldron.

[13:02] It should have.

[13:03] If this was made in the 90s, there would have been like a disappearing magnet.

[13:07] You're telling me that the balls couldn't go into a cauldron and then disappear for

[13:11] a little bit like you're mixing the different elements in the cauldron.

[13:15] Isn't that what a cauldron is?

[13:17] You put the different items in.

[13:19] You mix them together and then it creates a potion.

[13:22] Is that happening here?

[13:24] Is it going into a subway where the balls will appear somewhere else in the playfield?

[13:28] Is there even a subway in this game?

[13:31] No.

[13:32] Is there even a magnet in this game?

[13:33] I don't even think so.

[13:35] So is that the next wow mechanism?

[13:38] How about the high flying quidditch upper playfield?

[13:41] Okay, what's happening up there?

[13:44] Is that loaded?

[13:46] Is that magical?

[13:47] Is that a wow?

[13:49] Like the upper playfield in Pirates of the Caribbean?

[13:52] Are you feeling it there, people?

[13:54] I don't know, right?

[13:55] Is it the death eater pointing his wand at you, which isn't even a bash toy?

[14:00] You're hitting a drop target that just drops down and then you lock the ball.

[14:06] Ladies and gentlemen, and that's it.

[14:09] There's nothing else.

[14:12] So again, it's empty.

[14:15] There's more physical stuff in Avatar than this game.

[14:21] And everybody complained about that as being empty.

[14:25] And then they see Harry Potter and then they say it's one of the most loaded games they've

[14:31] ever seen.

[14:32] The problem when you're gas lit is that it's effective.

[14:36] Like they've effectively done it to the entire pinball community.

[14:41] One who thinks otherwise is bullied out of the conversation.

[14:46] And that to me is the greatest marketing achievement in the history of all the pinball is they

[14:54] got a community to believe that these mechs are indicative of a loaded pinball machine.

[15:03] This is Harry Potter, people.

[15:06] This is a game that's about wizards and magic and stuff happening in front of your eyes

[15:14] that makes the unbelievable, believable, that creates moments of drama and tension.

[15:21] And look, there's stuff in this game I really like, but all of it is software driven.

[15:26] When you're fighting that death eater and it's making the flippers go haywire, I love

[15:32] stuff like that.

[15:33] Like that's a pinball moment.

[15:35] I bet this game is going to have interesting moments like that.

[15:38] But my fear is this, because there's not that much in it mechanically, then there's only

[15:45] so much you can make happen via software.

[15:49] Everything else will happen up on the screen.

[15:52] And as I'm looking at the screen, people, I'm seeing like flashbacks to Wizard of Oz,

[15:57] though, like there's seven things happening at once on the screen.

[16:02] No, there's eight things.

[16:04] There's seven things happening around the video clips.

[16:08] And then there's the video clips in the middle, eight things at once on a screen in a pinball

[16:15] machine.

[16:16] Eight.

[16:17] When you played Lord of the Rings, there was one thing going on on the screen.

[16:23] One, it was showing you some dot matrix version of a scene in the movie.

[16:29] And that was it.

[16:30] It was like, that is what you were looking at and your score.

[16:34] And so then what you were absorbing when you played was the callouts, the music, the gameplay,

[16:40] the toys.

[16:41] And so for people saying like, this is better than Lord of the Rings, there is more in Lord

[16:46] of the Rings mechanically.

[16:47] That is wow.

[16:49] Then is in Harry Potter.

[16:50] Is there any Mech in Harry Potter that is more magical than the ring in Lord of the Rings?

[16:56] And Lord of the Rings is $5,500.

[17:00] Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you right now.

[17:03] I think all we're witnessing is just this is modern pinball now.

[17:07] Again, it doesn't upset me.

[17:09] Like it really doesn't.

[17:10] Like it's just changed.

[17:11] Like the game has changed.

[17:13] It's gone from a physical mechanical wow game to a software wow game.

[17:19] And it's just different.

[17:20] And again, the reason why that's happened is so obvious.

[17:24] Home buyers want more of the software because it gives you more replay value.

[17:30] Hello, 96 modes.

[17:33] Are you really going to ever be able to experience 96 modes in an arcade on location?

[17:38] I mean, imagine walking into Bali Williams in the mid 90s and they've got Twilight

[17:44] Zone and some dude walks in and is like, you know, it would make this game better with

[17:48] all this mechanical stuff.

[17:49] If we put 96 modes into this game, I mean, seriously, imagine if someone said that, like

[17:54] they'd be like, dude, leave, leave, get out of here.

[17:57] We're doing two modes per area of the game.

[18:00] And that's it.

[18:01] Get out of here.

[18:02] So like it's just changed.

[18:05] And I think you could be two types of people.

[18:07] You could be the kind of person that just screams at the clouds and is mad that the

[18:12] world has changed.

[18:14] There's social media now.

[18:15] I don't like it.

[18:16] But if I woke up every day and complained about social media, it would put me in a bad

[18:21] mood.

[18:22] So my point is, I think everyone's been gas lit, but I also just think you have to make

[18:27] a decision now in him.

[18:29] You don't have to make a decision whether or not you need to buy this game right now

[18:31] because there's zero FOMO.

[18:33] We're going to talk about that in a second.

[18:35] But I think you just have to make a decision.

[18:37] This is modern pinball.

[18:39] Like the games are going to be super expensive.

[18:41] The stuff that's going to be packed in them is going to be the audio, the video, the software,

[18:47] the modes, 96 modes.

[18:49] I was like, this game needs a Dungeons and Dragons thing where you can save your progress.

[18:54] I'm a little bit worried that you're never going to get through this game.

[18:58] One of those Jersey Jack things they do is they make the game so damn deep and complex

[19:03] that you never see most of it.

[19:05] I'm a little bit worried about that.

[19:07] Like, is this a three ball game or a 36 ball game to see those 96 modes of gameplay?

[19:14] But hey, look, it's just changed.

[19:16] That's what makes a game packed.

[19:18] When I saw the feature at video and they started out with the artwork, remember, you always

[19:23] start with your most impressive thing.

[19:26] So I knew right away, I'm like, here we go.

[19:29] Here we go.

[19:30] Like the fact that they're starting with art leads me to believe they know they don't have

[19:36] a lot magically to talk about when it comes to the mechs.

[19:41] Right?

[19:42] It was funny that Eric was like, he wasn't even realizing how many ball paths it had.

[19:46] He's like, did he say 13?

[19:47] Okay, guys, it's like not like you got a 13 inch wee wee in your pants.

[19:53] It's 13 different ball paths.

[19:55] Again, like how many ball paths does the magic trunk have in theater of magic?

[20:01] Not 13, but the three to four that it does have and the three to four things that it

[20:06] does do are way more magical than what's happening in that rotating staircase.

[20:13] All right.

[20:14] And look, you can cancel your subscription.

[20:16] I hope you don't.

[20:17] I'm not being negative.

[20:18] I'm just trying to call it like I see it.

[20:21] And when I read pin side, what I've noticed is you've got a lot of men who need this.

[20:27] Like they need this.

[20:28] They need to feel something.

[20:30] And even if the thing doesn't really deliver, they simply will convince themselves that

[20:36] it has because pinball is really meaningful to all of us.

[20:41] And we all have a relationship with it.

[20:44] And we walk into every new game release wanting to feel like a kid again.

[20:49] Now if this game makes you feel like a kid again, then that's amazing.

[20:54] And that's really all it needs to do.

[20:57] Everybody needs to decide, do I need this for 10 to $15,000?

[21:02] Should I order one?

[21:03] Is it giving me enough value?

[21:05] And look, I'm just going to say this from a pure asset standpoint.

[21:09] Yeah.

[21:10] Like, holy cow, they got Harry Potter.

[21:14] That's where the value is.

[21:15] You can actually play a Harry Potter pinball machine.

[21:19] That's not homebrew.

[21:20] That is going to have so much in it that you are never going to get bored of the game.

[21:25] It looks like it shoots fine.

[21:26] It doesn't look like a clunk fest like GNR.

[21:29] You're going to have so much in it.

[21:31] You're absolutely going to get your values worth.

[21:34] It looks beautiful.

[21:35] I love both art packages for different reasons.

[21:38] I do hearing Eric talk about that CE art package would just make me want that one.

[21:45] It's so clear how much meaning it has.

[21:48] And again, that's what you're buying.

[21:50] I've never heard of that artist.

[21:52] I've never read the books.

[21:54] But when I hear Eric talk about how much it meant to get that art on the game, how he

[22:01] wrote a letter and didn't know if he could even get them and they wrote back, even just

[22:07] the letter part I love.

[22:09] I mean, was it an email or like a physical letter?

[22:11] Who knows, right?

[22:12] Who cares, right?

[22:13] But now that's the version I want.

[22:16] You know why?

[22:17] Because you know what I'm buying for $15,000?

[22:19] I'm buying that story.

[22:22] That's marketing.

[22:24] That's what it is.

[22:25] If you've ever wondered what Canada does and what marketing is all about and how marketing

[22:30] matters, that's marketing.

[22:32] Is there any story behind the King Kong artwork that makes you feel anything?

[22:38] Is there?

[22:39] Like was there ever a story like with Zambietti?

[22:40] Like, yeah.

[22:41] I wrote the Empire State Building a letter and I wasn't sure they were going to let

[22:45] me use their image.

[22:46] No, because they didn't even illustrate the Empire State Building because Stern was too

[22:51] cheap to get the license.

[22:53] And that's my thing about King Kong versus this.

[22:56] King Kong is a way more mechanically impressive game than Harry Potter.

[23:01] King Kong will shoot better than Harry Potter.

[23:04] You know this.

[23:05] But what King Kong doesn't have is a story.

[23:08] It doesn't.

[23:09] It doesn't have anything interesting you want to hear about.

[23:12] So after like a few days, you're kind of over it.

[23:16] It's yesterday's news.

[23:18] But this game has a story.

[23:20] There's a story behind everything.

[23:21] There's a story behind how long it took to get the license.

[23:25] There's a story behind all the work David Thiel put into the music, the thousands of hours

[23:30] to get to the final product, the thousands of hours.

[23:33] So that's what you're buying people.

[23:36] And I think sometimes it's easy to even indict the baron playfields and say, it's crap.

[23:41] It's not worth it.

[23:43] Come on.

[23:44] Someone's doing all that work in the music section.

[23:47] Someone's doing all that graphic work.

[23:49] You know what I'm saying?

[23:50] Like there's still thousands of hours going into the product and that's not free labor.

[23:57] It's just not thousands of hours going into designing a mechanism.

[24:02] And that's the difference between 90s pinball and pinball today.

[24:06] And I think this is one of the most honest shows I've ever done.

[24:10] I think if we start to look at pinball this way, we can start to maybe just appreciate

[24:15] modern pinball a little bit differently than the old pinball.

[24:19] Now look, for this money, you know me.

[24:21] I think we should get both.

[24:22] I do think we should get both.

[24:24] I just don't think we are.

[24:26] And again, you could wake up every day and complain about what's in the world or you

[24:30] could just accept what's in the world and find a way to enjoy it.

[24:33] Now don't worry.

[24:34] I'm not going to become a shill.

[24:35] Every other content creator is going to shill this machine to the cows come home.

[24:40] You know it.

[24:41] You know it.

[24:42] Okay.

[24:43] I just I can't.

[24:44] I can't.

[24:45] It's just going to be nauseating listening to all the people just gush over what's not

[24:49] really physically in the game.

[24:51] I can't.

[24:52] I can't take it.

[24:53] I don't know what you're seeing.

[24:54] I ain't seeing lobster and steak guys.

[24:55] I'm seeing just French fries here.

[24:57] Okay.

[24:58] Okay.

[24:59] So we're going to get both editions.

[25:00] The topper on the game is not that great.

[25:03] And you know what?

[25:04] I know something internally that not everybody knows.

[25:06] I know that they tried to get Lior to do the topper.

[25:10] They weren't in love with that topper.

[25:12] They wanted Lior to make it.

[25:14] And it was just too late in the development to do that.

[25:17] I was expecting more of a sculpt.

[25:20] It looks a little plasticky and cheap.

[25:22] The topper on the le gag is so cheap.

[25:26] But I was in pin side and someone was like, it's really nice to see they're doing layer

[25:30] toppers light guys.

[25:32] It's two pieces of plastic next to each other.

[25:35] Are you not grown men who have actually bought something of quality?

[25:42] Do you have no taste?

[25:43] This is my real worry about the pinball community.

[25:46] I'm just worried the community doesn't have style or taste like they don't.

[25:52] And I can tell because they all crapped on the CE artwork.

[25:55] It's beautiful.

[25:57] It really is.

[25:58] It is a work of art and everybody crapped on it.

[26:00] Okay.

[26:01] So that tells me that the cargo pants wearing community doesn't really get or even want

[26:07] to walk up to art guys.

[26:09] Part of what makes art interesting is that it doesn't immediately telegraph what the

[26:16] art piece is about.

[26:17] Do you understand?

[26:18] Like that's what art's meant to do.

[26:20] It's meant to make you think and look at it and analyze it and then see things and discover

[26:29] things within the artistic piece.

[26:32] That's art.

[26:33] Okay.

[26:34] If it's just the characters and it's got the logo, that's a movie poster.

[26:39] Okay.

[26:40] And I get that movie poster is made up of art, but good art.

[26:44] Art that lasts the test of time are not movie posters.

[26:48] You don't go to a museum and see movie posters.

[26:50] You see stuff that makes you think stuff.

[26:53] That's a little bit more abstract stuff.

[26:54] That's a little bit deeper and they did that and I give them credit for doing it and I

[26:58] love it.

[26:59] And if I was buying this game, I'd be buying a CE version of this game.

[27:03] But what I don't like is that Jersey Jack, all of this added up, right?

[27:09] The passion, the love, the conversation, the feature, all of it.

[27:15] I love all of that passion.

[27:17] What I don't like and what I will never like is the sleazy sales tactic they are doing

[27:25] with the collector's addition.

[27:28] Because as I said before, words matter.

[27:32] They are right now taking nonrefundable deposits on what is being billed as in ultra limited,

[27:41] made to order version.

[27:43] Okay.

[27:44] Think about what those words mean.

[27:48] Ultra limited.

[27:49] Okay.

[27:50] In the world of pinball right now, limited, limited edition in every game ever made by

[27:56] every company out there on the planet.

[28:00] Limited means a thousand or less.

[28:03] Okay.

[28:04] That is what we're at right now in the world of pinball.

[28:07] It used to be 500 was the limited version number.

[28:10] Then it was a thousand.

[28:12] So when you say your ultra limited, that connotes to me much less than a thousand.

[28:19] Okay.

[28:20] So what is it?

[28:21] No, there is no number.

[28:22] So they're lying to us.

[28:24] That is a flat out lie and then made to order.

[28:29] Okay.

[28:30] So think about that.

[28:31] So they're saying, all right, what is it?

[28:32] Is it bespoke and custom?

[28:33] Because they could just say that.

[28:34] They could just say our collector's addition is made to order.

[28:38] If they had said that, I would appreciate it.

[28:41] That is telling the truth, but that doesn't mean it's ultra limited.

[28:45] By combining those two phrases, Jersey Jack is once again lying to us.

[28:52] And I mean it.

[28:53] It's a lie because they don't know it's ultra limited, but by saying it is, is a lie.

[29:00] If it was truly ultra limited, they would put a number on it and they're not.

[29:04] They don't even have a window.

[29:06] We were all told there was going to be a window by which we were going to know we had a place

[29:11] in order.

[29:12] And what they're going to do now is they're just going to like see what happens.

[29:17] They're going to move the goalposts in the middle of the game.

[29:20] If the game is selling great, they're just going to keep the order banks open and they're

[29:24] not even going to mention it.

[29:26] And then what's going to happen is this, like six months from now or a year from now when

[29:30] thousands have been ordered or whatever the number is, they're going to say, all right,

[29:35] no call, like final sale on the collector's editions.

[29:39] We're going to stop taking orders at this date, but that's not going to happen this week.

[29:43] It's not going to happen next week.

[29:45] And then the ultra limited thing is going to be a lie because when they reveal how many

[29:50] they finally made, it's not going to be limited.

[29:53] It's going to be everywhere.

[29:54] Okay.

[29:55] So that's my thing about buying this game right now.

[29:57] What's the point in buying a CE right now?

[30:01] If I were you, I would just buy the $10,000 version and see if you like the game and then

[30:09] you'll be able to get an ultra limited version.

[30:12] If you really want the CE, they're going to be everywhere and they're going to be way

[30:17] cheaper than 15.

[30:18] I mean, none of these versions are going to hold much value.

[30:21] And here's the other part.

[30:22] Why would you order the game now?

[30:24] You don't know what you don't know about the game.

[30:27] And after I watched the feature, you got to listen to their language people.

[30:33] For those of you saying that there's not going to be muted clips in this game, you need to

[30:38] go back and watch how they talked about Avatar.

[30:42] They said they had everything, how they talked about Toy Story 4.

[30:46] They said they had everything, how they had everything in Willy Wonka.

[30:49] They're speaking in very similar tongues to the way they said stuff about those games.

[30:56] And I can just see by the way the clips are on the center of that screen.

[31:00] I also don't like the fact that you've got the movie clips.

[31:03] Put them on the full screen.

[31:05] It's so annoying that you've got all this other stuff.

[31:08] Just show the movie.

[31:09] Like what I love about Guns N' Roses Assets is the way it takes up the whole screen.

[31:15] It just looks so good.

[31:17] Like framing this multi-billion dollar movie franchise clips with all this pinball stuff

[31:23] is just not how I would do it.

[31:25] I'm still not sure how many clips, because they talk about how we've got the individual's

[31:31] voice files.

[31:33] And then I get worried because I'm like, why would you need to think about this?

[31:37] Why would you need to separate all that?

[31:40] When you look at Jaws, it just plays you what the movie is.

[31:43] When you look at Star Wars, it plays you what the movie is.

[31:46] When you look at Batman, it just plays you the clips from the TV show.

[31:50] So the reason why Eric said that and the reason why I'm nervous is the reason why they're

[31:55] separating it is because they don't have it synced up to all those scenes because they're

[32:02] going to use the call-outs, but you're not going to see the actors say those iconic lines

[32:08] in the scenes themselves.

[32:10] You might hear them, but they're not going to sync it up.

[32:13] Again, I don't know, but history has shown us that there will be much more muted stuff

[32:19] happening.

[32:20] What I want to see in this game is what we see in Jaws and in the Big Lebowski when you

[32:25] get into those 96 moments of the movie and it's a sequence, right?

[32:31] Like Harry and his friends are doing something.

[32:33] I want them to be talking to each other like they do in the movie.

[32:38] And then I want them to be progressing through that moment in the movie.

[32:42] And I want to hear it.

[32:43] I want to see it.

[32:44] I want the voices to be synced up.

[32:46] And I want to feel like I just went through that moment from the story.

[32:50] I don't want it to be a repeated, muted clip of the scene, which I think it's going to

[32:55] be.

[32:56] And I think all of David's music is when they start saying stuff like that, gang, get ready

[33:01] for like a muted masterpiece.

[33:02] Because when they say that David's orchestration is going to happen over all of those moments,

[33:10] that means they're not just going to play the movie.

[33:13] They're going to have the orchestration going because that's what happened with Avatar.

[33:17] Instead of hearing all those characters and when they're screaming in the battles, you

[33:21] don't hear their screams.

[33:22] It's all muted because you're hearing the orchestration.

[33:26] You're not hearing the movie.

[33:27] The movie has orchestration in every scene in the movie.

[33:31] There's music playing along with the dialogue.

[33:34] So I'm just telling you, if you ordered already and think you're getting 96 synced up video

[33:40] modes from the film, prepare to be disappointed.

[33:44] Oh, God, everybody, how are you doing?

[33:46] Where's Predator?

[33:47] If I were the pinball brothers, I'd drop Predator now because I'm just going to say this.

[33:50] I think Predator is going to have more mechanical wow in it than Harry Potter.

[33:54] It's just not going to have Arnold.

[33:56] Again, everything's a compromise now.

[33:58] Everything's a compromise.

[33:59] If I were you again, by the $10,000 edition, I did not even mention everything's in the

[34:04] $10,000 edition.

[34:06] That really matters.

[34:07] Everything.

[34:08] It's the same game.

[34:10] I knew it when it was all going to be the same game that there wasn't going to be a

[34:12] lot of mechanical wow in the game because there was not going to be anything to take

[34:16] out.

[34:17] Think about it.

[34:18] What could you actually take out of this game?

[34:20] If you don't take out the diverter, there's nothing else.

[34:23] Oh, you're going to take out a drop target?

[34:25] No.

[34:26] You're going to take out a pass through cauldron?

[34:27] No.

[34:28] You're going to take out just wire forms from the quidditch area?

[34:31] There was nothing to remove.

[34:33] Nothing.

[34:34] Game.

[34:35] Come on.

[34:36] Come on.

[34:37] This is modern pinball.

[34:38] It's empty.

[34:39] It's barren.

[34:40] Then go on pinside and count the amount of times people say this game is loaded and they're

[34:47] referring to the physical stuff in the game.

[34:50] It's crazy.

[34:51] It's crazy.

[34:52] Everybody look.

[34:53] Happy Friday.

[34:54] I love being your go-to pinball podcaster.

[34:57] I love talking to you about this.

[34:59] I think my private school education, if it taught me anything, it's how to think critically

[35:04] about stuff, but also deliver back in a hopefully well-articulated way.

[35:10] I just wish there was a little bit more of this, a lot more of this maybe in pinball.

[35:15] I think everybody, again, just wants to feel more excited than they truly are.

[35:21] There's that little honeymoon period when a game launches.

[35:24] That used to be the window of FOMO.

[35:26] There was a limited number of games you had to go get.

[35:29] I don't see any FOMO here.

[35:30] I encourage everybody to play the machine.

[35:33] This game is going to be everywhere.

[35:35] It's going to be at every show other than the Northwest Pinball Show.

[35:39] There were more guys out there.

[35:40] They were advertising they were going to have this, and now they don't.

[35:44] There's got to be a story why Ken is no longer at Jersey Jack.

[35:48] That's interesting.

[35:49] To me, that's the most interesting story.

[35:50] The whole time I was hearing these guys talk, I'm like, man, I really just want to know

[35:54] what happened to Ken.

[35:55] More so than Eric driving an hour to a bookstore, which I did appreciate.

[36:00] It looked like he was about to cry at the end.

[36:02] I will say, Eric, I love stories like that that make grown men want to cry.

[36:06] But also, I just got to say this.

[36:07] This is my final point.

[36:09] Most of this hobby are men.

[36:10] And I was just thinking, yeah, all this 20 minutes of grown men dressed in a way.

[36:16] There was something about the medieval background with this polished Harry Potter

[36:21] world and seeing these guys in baseball caps just doesn't go together.

[36:26] It's just weird.

[36:27] I would have made it so they just wore something a little bit more appropriate for the theme.

[36:34] Details matter.

[36:35] How you show up to the pitch matters.

[36:38] Like if I am trying to sell you a $15,000 item, I might not have the baseball cap on for that.

[36:45] OK, it's Eric's style.

[36:47] It's like Slash's top hat.

[36:48] I'm just saying, like I'm just having fun, by the way, all this is just meant to entertain you.

[36:53] Let Kaneda be the jester in the corner as this company makes millions of dollars off of this game.

[36:59] And I have to beg people to give me $5 a month.

[37:02] Everybody, I love you.

[37:04] Thanks for the support.

[37:05] I might make this a free show.

[37:07] I do. And the reason why is I just want everybody to hear my take.

[37:11] Everybody at Jersey Jack.

[37:12] I put a lot of thought into this.

[37:13] And I hope people, if you're listening to this and you're not a member of Kaneda's pinball podcast,

[37:19] I think you should be.

[37:20] So thank you, though, for being a member.

[37:21] And it means a lot to me.

[37:22] Everybody, enjoy your one life and spend the money on stuff that makes you happy.

[37:28] If this game makes you happy and you see the value.

[37:31] And I think there is the value is in, like I said, all the software, all the music.

[37:36] That's where the money is in the IP in the artwork.

[37:39] It's just not in the mechanical stuff.

[37:41] That's modern pinball.

[37:43] And I would stop doing this show if I woke up and sing a game like this made me go crazy.

[37:49] It doesn't. That's it.

[37:50] That's it.

[37:50] You know, this game doesn't blow me away.

[37:52] It doesn't make me angry.

[37:53] I think it's going to give a lot of fun to Harry Potter fans.

[37:58] And I think my assessment was pretty fair.

[38:00] Let me know what you think at Kaneda pinball at gmail.com.

[38:04] And obviously join tomorrow or Sunday when we do the spectacular and we could talk

[38:09] live a lot about Harry Potter.

[38:11] Can't wait to hear your thoughts.

[38:12] So make sure you hang out there.

[38:14] It'll probably be Sunday because I think tomorrow is going to be T-ball.

[38:18] Maybe I'll do it tonight.

[38:20] I might do it tonight.

[38:21] So look out for a Kaneda Friday evening.

[38:24] Harry Potter discussion spectacular.

[38:28] I needed a better name, but it's six in the morning people.

[38:30] And I want to get you some content to chew on later.

[38:33] Oh, we're in trouble.

[38:36] Something's come along and it's best not bubble.

[38:40] Oh, we're in trouble.

[38:43] Gotta get home quick.

[38:45] My shot is double.

[38:47] Oh, we're in trouble.

[38:50] Something's come along and it's best not bubble.

[38:54] Oh, we're in trouble.
