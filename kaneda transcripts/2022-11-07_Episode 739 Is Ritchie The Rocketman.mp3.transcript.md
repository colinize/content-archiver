[00:00] Oh, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast, the only Pinball podcaster with the

[00:26] bravado to do lives every week and everyone is invited to join.

[00:31] Thank you for joining the show, we're going to talk about Elton John as the rumor of Steve

[00:36] Ritchie's next pinball machine.

[00:38] Now look, I think there's two themes that Steve Ritchie is working on, I'm going to tell

[00:42] you what I think they are, and we're going to talk about the timeline with Jersey Jack

[00:46] Pinball.

[00:47] And when would we see this game, right?

[00:49] Because this is a company that has said we are going to get two games out a year.

[00:52] Guess what they've never done?

[00:54] They've gotten two games out a year and we're almost at the end of the year and once again

[00:58] Jersey Jack Pinball has not got out two games a year.

[01:01] So we're going to talk about that, we're going to talk about the wait for this Elwyn version

[01:05] of James Bond.

[01:06] But before I do that, I want to welcome our new club members.

[01:09] Welcome John Kay, Wade, Fishtails, Bally, let's welcome Trey King.

[01:15] And there's someone else who joined who made the weirdest name ever that has a lot of expletives,

[01:19] but I'm not going to say that because this is a family friendly show.

[01:22] And I want to give an extra special shout out to a man that's been on the fence about

[01:26] joining Canada's Pinball podcast.

[01:28] And I told him if he joined, I'm going to give you a shout out, Mr. Dave Howard.

[01:32] All right, let's get right to it.

[01:33] So Elton John, what do we think about Steve Ritchie making an Elton John pinball machine?

[01:39] Now look, Elton John is one of the greatest artists ever.

[01:43] The man has sold over 300 million records worldwide.

[01:48] Okay.

[01:49] He has sold more than 30 million copies of his one album, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.

[01:54] He is also, this is crazy, is also the first artist to achieve top 10 singles across six

[02:01] consecutive decades.

[02:04] So if you think about a man who's got a portfolio of music that has more fans, almost as many

[02:10] fans, right?

[02:11] As groups like The Beatles, more fans than Guns N' Roses, more fans than like Motley

[02:15] Crew and Foo Fighters.

[02:17] He's got more fans than Kiss and like Rush and Guns N' Roses combined.

[02:22] And yet when you ask people in the pinball space, do you think Elton John is a good theme

[02:26] for pinball?

[02:27] You get this weird like resounding, no, it's not.

[02:31] And I'm just wondering why people think an Elton John pinball machine is not a good choice

[02:37] for pinball.

[02:38] Here's why I do think it's a good choice for pinball.

[02:40] I'll tell you right now.

[02:41] The man's got amazing music.

[02:43] The man's music would be great in pinball form.

[02:46] And here's the other thing about this pinball machine.

[02:49] Elton John is very, very like, he's very, very like colorful and flamboyant in his persona,

[02:56] right?

[02:57] And that's Elton.

[02:58] Like that's his whole shtick.

[02:59] It's always been his shtick.

[03:00] Like a lot of bright colors, a lot of diamonds, a lot of rhinestones, a lot of crazy sort

[03:05] of Vegas-y vibe kind of thing going on with Elton John.

[03:08] And when you think about a pinball machine and you think about a pinball machine's ability

[03:12] to take an artist and bring that artist's like audio visual world to life under glass,

[03:19] I think Elton John, the Rocket Man, under glass, if done right, will look absolutely

[03:25] spectacular.

[03:26] He has such a stronger visual identity than like most of the other bands I've been hearing

[03:31] about.

[03:32] He has a stronger visual identity than Bruce Springsteen, than like Foo Fighters, than

[03:36] Motley Crue.

[03:37] And so look, it's going to be really interesting.

[03:39] And here's why I think there's a lot of hesitation.

[03:41] I think a lot of people out there are tired of acts that are very old.

[03:46] And Sir Elton John is very old.

[03:48] Like he is very, very old.

[03:49] I think he's in his late 70s, early 80s right now.

[03:52] So a lot of people out there are probably hesitant because they're like, why do we need to make

[03:56] another musical pin based on someone who was like born in the 50s?

[04:01] Like when are we going to get a game for bands like Nirvana?

[04:05] When are we going to get Red Hot Chili Peppers?

[04:07] When are we going to get Motley Crue?

[04:09] When are we going to get some hip hop and rap into the whole like pinball space?

[04:13] It's crazy that there's no Eminem.

[04:15] There's no Biggie Smalls.

[04:16] There's no like Dr. Dre.

[04:18] Nothing in the hip hop space and nothing in the pop space is even represented in pinball.

[04:23] No Michael Jackson.

[04:24] No Madonna.

[04:25] No Lady Gaga.

[04:27] No Taylor Swift.

[04:28] No Katy Perry.

[04:29] Don't get me started when we think about music and pinball.

[04:32] This has been one of the most myopically developed genres in all of pinball.

[04:38] At least the movies will span the spectrum of like sci-fi and action and cartoons and

[04:44] all the different things that people grew up loving.

[04:46] But for some reason we're not really capturing the variety of music that people who buy pinball

[04:52] machines love.

[04:53] And I'm speaking to each and every one of you.

[04:55] You can't tell me that all of you guys only listen to like Dad Rock.

[04:59] You have to let other music into your lives.

[05:01] And I think most of you out there who are in the pinball buying public would absolutely

[05:06] buy an Eminem pinball machine.

[05:08] Now let's get back to this pinball machine.

[05:10] When do we think we're going to see the next Steve Ritchie game.

[05:14] This is the big thing right because JJP is in trouble right now.

[05:17] Everybody knows they're in trouble right now.

[05:19] They can't spin it.

[05:20] They can't find new buyers for these toy story games.

[05:23] Everyone is looking at this company saying look when are we going to get the next Jersey

[05:27] Jack game and we know the next game is Eric Minier and then we're going to get Steve Ritchie's

[05:31] game after Eric Minier's game.

[05:33] But here's the dilemma and the problem for Jersey Jack pinball.

[05:36] They are basically on something like an 18 month to two year cycle which means when they

[05:42] reveal a game and put a game on the line the next game does not even get revealed for like

[05:48] 18 months.

[05:49] And so that means if we've got Eric Minier's Godfather next we are not going to see Steve

[05:55] Ritchie's pinball machine anytime in 2023.

[05:59] Now they will tell us we're wrong and we shouldn't speculate because Jersey Jack pinball is a

[06:04] company that's going to get two games on the line in one year.

[06:07] I could go back and grab about 15 sound clips in which Jack Guinari himself said they will

[06:14] be able to reveal two games in one year.

[06:17] He's said it every year now for like the last five or six years.

[06:21] So is he lying?

[06:22] No.

[06:23] Is he misleading us?

[06:24] I don't know.

[06:25] Does anyone care?

[06:26] I don't really know.

[06:27] All I know is this is that the Jersey Jack fans out there are pretty deflated.

[06:32] I mean for the most part they are very very deflated right now because Jersey Jack unlike

[06:36] Stern makes one big colossal mistake and you know what the big colossal mistake is with

[06:41] Jersey Jack pinball.

[06:42] They don't give you the ability to buy any other new and box machines other than the

[06:47] single game that is on the line today.

[06:50] You can only buy a Toy Story 4 and that's it.

[06:54] They won't make you another dialed in or pired to the Caribbean or Wizard of Oz or

[06:58] Hobbit.

[06:59] There are so many people who are just getting into pinball today and guess the one thing

[07:04] they can't do?

[07:05] They can't give Jersey Jack pinball their money unless they want to buy Toy Story 4.

[07:11] Unless they want to buy a Guns N Roses right now because there's distributors sitting

[07:14] on GNRs.

[07:15] But that's a huge issue with this company.

[07:18] I don't understand why they don't follow the demand.

[07:22] And there is like evergreen demand for new and box Wizard of Oz's.

[07:25] There is.

[07:26] Like Jack has said it himself.

[07:27] They sell more Wizard of Oz's every single year if they simply made them.

[07:32] And so the big question becomes is this.

[07:34] Are we going to see the Ritchie game in 2023?

[07:36] Now what's the other theme I think Steve Ritchie might be working on?

[07:39] I think it's Top Gun.

[07:41] I think they have Top Gun.

[07:43] I think they have some sort of license.

[07:45] I'm not sure if they're going to have the Maverick or the original movie.

[07:48] The second movie was great.

[07:49] Both movies were great.

[07:51] Here's the good news for Top Gun fans out there if they have this franchise.

[07:54] Unlike Toy Story 4, which is the movie nobody wanted, if they make either of these Top Gun

[08:00] movies people will be happy because both movies are phenomenal.

[08:05] I would argue the second movie is even better than the first.

[08:10] But it's only better than the first because we had the first.

[08:13] There's so much emotional connection to that first film and waiting all those years to

[08:18] make a sequel to Top Gun and paying it off the way Tom Cruise did made all of us feel

[08:24] so satisfied.

[08:26] It is so rare that this happens, that something comes out and actually is better than the

[08:30] original and we waited decades for it.

[08:33] And we know that Steve Ritchie has a knack for making airplane-themed games.

[08:37] What F-14 Tomcat I believe was supposed to be Top Gun but they didn't get the license.

[08:43] Now look, that's a really weird sort of two titles to think about.

[08:47] Elton John or Top Gun.

[08:49] If we did a poll and said which Steve Ritchie theme would you rather have, Top Gun or Elton

[08:55] John, I bet 98% of people would say Top Gun.

[09:00] Now the question for Jersey Jack Pinball is this, can this company absorb two flops in

[09:06] a row?

[09:07] Guns and Roses was a huge success, Toy Story has been a flop.

[09:10] Godfather, I just can't imagine a scenario in which Godfather Pinball Machine gets people

[09:17] excited.

[09:18] I'm hoping, I'm really hoping Godfather is just a rumor that is false.

[09:23] I'm hoping that Godfather is a fake rumor.

[09:25] I'm hoping that Eric Minier's game is actually Avatar, the new Avatar way of the water movies.

[09:31] I'm hoping that it is that.

[09:33] It would make perfect sense for them to come out with a new Avatar game as that humongous

[09:38] franchise gets rebooted.

[09:40] There's four more Avatar movies coming out, one every two years.

[09:45] And I bet even though there's already been an Avatar Pinball Machine, so many of you

[09:50] would rather have Avatar than the Godfather.

[09:53] And look Jersey Jack Pinball has shown us that they can remake older themes and be great

[09:58] at it.

[09:59] Hello Guns and Roses, the new one is much better than the old machine.

[10:03] But here's the thing about Jersey Jack, it's like at these prices, right?

[10:08] Are they going to go back and remake Pire to the Caribbean?

[10:11] Are they going to go back and make more wide body games?

[10:14] The I think for $12,000 or $15,000, this company might need to start thinking about going back

[10:21] to wide body games that are packed.

[10:23] The problem with JJP now is they have priced themselves so far above where their prices

[10:30] used to be.

[10:31] And even though their marketing department told us they stuffed everything they could

[10:34] into Toy Story, that wasn't true.

[10:37] They're at a real crossroads right now.

[10:39] And I think the next 6 months are going to be so interesting as we look at Jersey Jack

[10:44] Pinball.

[10:45] Because Toy Story demand is over.

[10:48] Like it is over, it's so weird to me that you can go on the marketplace on Pinsight

[10:52] and see all of these Toy Story LEs for sale for around $10,000, right?

[10:57] And then the distributors have to list their games for $12,000.

[11:01] Like who is buying a game from a distributor right now?

[11:04] Almost nobody.

[11:05] Like you would absolutely be foolish because if you're buying a game second hand with low

[11:09] plays for $10,000, a new in-box distributor game with tax is $13,000.

[11:17] So why would you spend $3,000 more when you can go get the game in brand new condition?

[11:24] It's unbelievable.

[11:25] The demand is gone.

[11:26] I've never seen a game lose this much demand this quickly.

[11:30] Like this is worse than dialed in.

[11:32] This is absolutely worse than dialed in because dialed in was at least a packed game.

[11:37] You could at least look at dialed in and see where the money went and also dialed in was

[11:41] so much cheaper than Toy Story.

[11:43] And so where do they go now?

[11:45] Like it's like, G&R, where do we go now?

[11:47] Where do we go now?

[11:48] Do we get Eric's next game out in the next couple of months?

[11:51] Or are we going to keep making Toy Stories because every week they put more Toy Stories

[11:55] into the marketplace, the price is going to keep going down and down and down.

[11:58] And I'm loving the fact I was on Pinsight and someone started a poll and they said,

[12:03] where do you think the Jersey Jack price should be?

[12:05] And I'm just glad as a community, we're all starting to ask these questions.

[12:10] Like this is a good debate.

[12:11] This is not a debate that distributors want you to have.

[12:14] It's not a debate that these companies want you to have, but it's a debate that we all

[12:18] need to have.

[12:19] Like this has been the year in which pinball pricing has jumped the shark.

[12:24] Everybody knows it.

[12:25] Everybody's holding back now.

[12:27] The hype for James Bond LE has dissipated.

[12:30] Everyone's feeling like this isn't right.

[12:31] Like we can't keep going in this direction.

[12:34] All right.

[12:34] So let's talk about this for a minute.

[12:35] Okay.

[12:36] So let me give you my prediction on what I think Steve Ritchie is working on and when

[12:40] I think we're going to see it.

[12:41] I actually do think they're going to reveal Steve Ritchie's next game by the end of next year.

[12:48] I do think it's going to be Elton John.

[12:51] I do.

[12:51] I think it's going to be Elton John.

[12:53] I think it's going to be a music pin.

[12:55] I heard Steve's next game is a music pin.

[12:58] For those of you thinking Steve Ritchie is more of a badass rocker and wouldn't do Elton

[13:02] John.

[13:03] You guys are nuts.

[13:04] I think this is one of the most expensive licenses you could get music wise.

[13:09] And I think it's going to be pretty cool.

[13:10] But I think there's a big but right.

[13:12] And the big but is this.

[13:14] I don't think Jersey Jack in today's pinball climate can afford to have two flops in a row.

[13:19] And I think we need to put Steve Ritchie's game to the side right now and just talk about that.

[13:24] If Godfather comes out and it is underwhelming people and at 12 or $15,000 it doesn't start

[13:31] to attract buyers.

[13:33] I think Jersey Jack pinball is going to be in a little bit of trouble.

[13:36] But the thing is this is like Jersey Jack pinball.

[13:38] They would be in trouble if they didn't have tremendous financial backing.

[13:43] So almost anything they do doesn't really matter because they've got so much money backing

[13:48] the company.

[13:49] But we don't care about that.

[13:51] What we care about is we want Jersey Jack pinball to finally deliver games that check

[13:57] all of the boxes.

[13:58] And that's what I'm looking at with JJP moving forward.

[14:01] We haven't really seen this company nail the theme for the most part.

[14:05] We haven't seen them get all of the assets that we want in the games.

[14:08] We haven't.

[14:09] Like they didn't get all the assets for pirates.

[14:11] They didn't get all the assets for Willy Wonka.

[14:14] They didn't get all the assets for Toy Story.

[14:16] Like you're watching these movies and you don't see the syncing up of the actors with

[14:21] the voices.

[14:22] And if you can't get that, then maybe go get something where you can get all the assets.

[14:28] Why is it that Dutch pinball was able to secure everything they did with the big Lebowski

[14:33] and eight years later Jersey Jack pinball can't put as much into games that are costing this

[14:39] much money.

[14:41] And I think that's it.

[14:42] It's like for this much money, everybody wants it all.

[14:46] James Bond has all of the assets you want.

[14:49] They sync up the voices between Sean Connery and the movie clips.

[14:52] Like we're actually going to feel like we're watching the movies when we play the game.

[14:56] And that's my point is you just can't get away anymore with this sort of kind of integrating

[15:01] the theme into the machine.

[15:02] And can I please get $13,000 from you or $16,000?

[15:06] Again, you notice how Canadian is talking about these prices with tax included because

[15:10] that's the all in cost for these games.

[15:13] But I think they're going to reveal the Steve Ritchie pin at the end of the year.

[15:17] But if Godfather Flops, it's going to be a very, very interesting year for JJP.

[15:23] I think if Godfather Flops, there's only one thing they can quickly pivot and do.

[15:28] And that's make more pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:31] It is the silliest thing I've ever seen in the history of pinball marketing where you

[15:35] know there is huge demand for pirates and you won't satiate it.

[15:39] You know you could sell another 500 to a thousand pirates at these prices.

[15:44] You would sell them and they won't do it.

[15:47] Makes no sense.

[15:48] All right, let's switch gears now and talk about this Keith Elwin pinball machine.

[15:53] Stern stalling, of course they're stalling.

[15:55] I keep wondering when they're finally going to pull the curtain off of this game.

[15:59] Now we were hearing from someone on my Saturday morning spectacular that they're hearing

[16:03] this Keith Elwin game might be $25,000.

[16:07] I kind of hope it's $25,000 because it makes it super easy for almost all of us to say,

[16:14] no thank you.

[16:15] I'm not spending $25,000 on a single level street level game.

[16:19] I don't care who made it.

[16:20] I don't care if like Zeus himself came down from the heavens of Mount Olympus and made

[16:25] this game.

[16:26] How can you spend $25,000 on a single pinball machine?

[16:30] How could this thing have $10,000 more in it than like Batman SLE?

[16:35] And I think that's where we're at right now.

[16:36] Stern is stalling.

[16:38] They're trying to capitalize on the hotness of this pinball market.

[16:42] But I think this game is going to backfire.

[16:43] I do.

[16:44] I think this game is going to be a public relations nightmare and backfire for Stern

[16:48] pinball.

[16:49] I think it's going to show each and every one of us that they really are greedy.

[16:53] That they really are greedy.

[16:55] And I think a lot of people are going to be turned off by these greedy behaviors.

[16:59] And it's one thing if you want to pass the value onto the customer.

[17:02] Look, Stern could easily do this.

[17:04] Stern could easily go down their sales list.

[17:07] They know who buys what game.

[17:09] They could easily find their buyer base, their collectors who have spent more than $100,000

[17:15] on Stern machines over the years.

[17:17] And they could easily allow those people first dibs at Keith Elwin's James Bond game.

[17:23] They could sell to them for like $15,000.

[17:26] And then it would be a win-win for everybody.

[17:28] You're rewarding your loyal customers.

[17:31] You're charging them something that is appropriate for what the game is.

[17:35] Instead, I think they're going to give this to the distributors.

[17:38] They're going to let the distributors make all the money because they don't care about

[17:41] you.

[17:42] They're going to care about keeping their distributors happy and making sure their distributors

[17:46] keep buying all the pros and premiums.

[17:48] See, Stern Pinball needs distributors to stock up on inventory.

[17:52] And I think this is going to be another game in which they're going to help distributors

[17:56] make themselves another $10,000 or $15,000 in their pocket for everyone sold as a way

[18:02] to say thank you for absorbing all of the Rush premiums and Mandalorian premiums.

[18:07] But I don't like it.

[18:08] I don't like it.

[18:09] And I think this is the problem.

[18:10] This is going to be like a seesaw back and forth now where I think a lot of pinball buyers

[18:14] out there are going to say no thank you at these prices.

[18:18] And it's going to start to divide people.

[18:20] It's already started to divide people.

[18:22] And I just don't think people want to wake up and spend this kind of money on machines.

[18:27] Now look, I don't know if it's $25,000 or not.

[18:30] I hope it's not.

[18:31] I really hope it's not.

[18:33] I don't know why anyone would spend $25,000 on a single pinball machine in the year 2022.

[18:40] I've got way more things I want to spend my money on than that.

[18:43] I've got a lot more exciting things I want to do with my family and with Killian and

[18:47] with my life that would make my life so much better than a $25,000 pinball machine.

[18:53] The target for a $25,000 pinball machine is someone who's a lot wealthier than me.

[18:59] Once we get into these prices for a single pinball machine, we are talking about individuals

[19:04] that are worth tens of millions of dollars.

[19:06] It's not me.

[19:07] It's not Canada.

[19:08] I'm not going to get that way with my $5 a month subscription.

[19:12] I'm not ninja playing Fortnite with like a million subscribers or a hundred million

[19:16] subscribers.

[19:17] I'm just a wee little pinball podcaster in New York City and it is what it is.

[19:21] It's fun to talk about this stuff.

[19:23] It's fun to sort of speculate on all this stuff.

[19:25] But I do think Keith Owen's James Bond game is going to be one of the most polarizing

[19:30] pinball machines I've ever seen released.

[19:32] And I do think they're stalling.

[19:34] I don't think they know where to price it.

[19:36] And I think the people running stern.

[19:38] The marketing people running stern need to be careful.

[19:42] This isn't the time to be greedy.

[19:44] This is the time to give people value.

[19:47] The world economy is about to go through a rocky few years.

[19:51] And if you get greedy now, you're going to really regret it when everyone heads for the

[19:55] exits and stops buying all these new and box games.

[19:58] You know, and I think that's what they're struggling with.

[20:00] That's what they're struggling with.

[20:01] And I also think they need to show this game before people pay for these James Bond LEs.

[20:05] I think stern has really never done this before.

[20:08] We've never seen stern do this in the history of all their releases.

[20:12] Release two games on the same theme by two different designers.

[20:17] And I think they could have made this a special moment.

[20:20] And nothing about this James Bond release feels special.

[20:23] It doesn't feel like they connected to the 60th anniversary in the right way.

[20:26] It doesn't feel like they gave the Keith Owen machine to their loyal customers in a fun

[20:31] way where value is exchanged between company and customer.

[20:35] None of this feels fun.

[20:36] None of this feels like it was done right.

[20:38] It feels really like a greedy move.

[20:41] And we don't know what the exact price is going to be.

[20:43] But everything about this feels like a fumbled launch.

[20:47] Everybody happy Monday from Canada's pinball podcast.

[20:49] I can't wait to just see this game, this Elwyn machine.

[20:52] I can't wait to see Eric Minier's next game.

[20:55] I can't wait to see like Galactic Tank, Battle Force, whatever is coming out from American

[21:00] pinball.

[21:01] What we need is a new game.

[21:03] Everybody just wants a new game to discuss.

[21:05] And I think the next game we're going to get that's going to be brand new to discuss is

[21:09] going to be Scooby Doo.

[21:10] Everybody I will be back this week with more Canada's Pinball podcast.
