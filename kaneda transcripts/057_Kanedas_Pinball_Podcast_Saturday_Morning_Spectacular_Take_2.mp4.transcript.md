[00:00] So this is going to work much better.

[00:02] All right, are we back?

[00:05] I think we're back.

[00:07] We're demon speed in here, people.

[00:09] All right, let me get the charger.

[00:30] We're damn leakflowers again.

[00:37] We had a rule.

[00:41] No, there's supposed to be no gas power leakflowers.

[00:44] People keep breaking that rule.

[00:47] All right, we're back.

[00:55] We're back.

[00:59] I don't know, I was outside, but I'm right underneath the router now.

[01:07] I get to see the demon.

[01:13] Let's pop the hood.

[01:59] Yeah, the air driver.

[02:07] Mike's blocking.

[02:10] Supercharger.

[02:11] Oh, demon.

[02:15] It's the best, the best.

[02:19] Yeah, you know, like literally pinball is fun, but nowhere near as fun as putting on some

[02:26] country music, beautiful sunny five degree and no cloud in the sky driving the demon to

[02:33] the beach and Connecticut and just chilling, have a couple cold beers in the cooler.

[02:40] Life is good today, you know, that's kind of how I feel.

[02:42] Like pinball is fun, man.

[02:45] People take it way too seriously.

[02:47] You know, people people people they don't get it.

[02:51] They don't get it.

[02:53] It's like you can this is the pinnacle of like automotive fun that these two cars, like

[02:59] the Toyota.

[03:00] I think like a Mazda Miada and a muscle car would be the greatest two, you know, best of both

[03:06] worlds in the driving world.

[03:09] Dodges coming back, baby.

[03:11] Dodges coming back.

[03:13] I don't know if you saw this.

[03:14] Let me find it for you.

[03:15] Let's watch it.

[03:16] It's amazing.

[03:17] Let's see that it's like talk about a company that like realizes they made a mistake

[03:20] more than cracker barrel even.

[03:24] And they like they they have to go back and like course correct, but like look at this.

[03:30] That's the SRT.

[03:36] I mean, this is basically how are you like kind of say like, oh, we messed up.

[03:46] Let's see, where's the video?

[03:53] All right, hold on.

[04:00] Why is it like this louder?

[04:08] Share.

[04:10] Hold on.

[04:14] Hold on.

[04:15] You guys ready?

[04:22] Ready for it?

[04:28] Sitting on over 500 acres, our 5.4 million square foot North American headquarters is the

[04:37] second largest building in the US.

[04:41] 36 years ago, 40 years before this building was completed, a very small group of engineers

[04:48] created something special that to this day fuels a subculture, both inside this complex

[04:56] and the auto industry as a whole.

[04:59] The name has changed a couple of times and it even went quiet recently.

[05:03] Quiet.

[05:04] But it is time now for us to harness our past to accelerate harder and faster towards

[05:10] our future.

[05:11] So today we start recruiting.

[05:15] We start rebuilding and we refire the machine.

[05:18] We stop being quiet and we get loud again.

[05:22] Today we relaunch the world class SRT performance division.

[05:29] Hell yeah.

[05:30] Love it.

[05:31] I love it.

[05:32] Okay.

[05:33] That's how you do it.

[05:35] Okay.

[05:36] Back to the spooky stuff.

[05:38] We had a very proud to announce that for the first time ever, I would get one LLE of

[05:48] a game and we would auction it off for someone to get a shot at a game that sold out.

[05:54] We all know that build use is going to sell out instantly.

[05:56] They're going to sell 999 in 9 minutes.

[06:03] 9 seconds.

[06:05] I'm saying that's how it's going to happen.

[06:10] Spooky Pimball is going to give Canadian club members a chance to get a few of the games.

[06:19] Fully loaded games.

[06:20] They're going to be, and I said, only want my club members to get access to a butter cabinet,

[06:28] top or everything.

[06:29] I want the works.

[06:31] I want every, these are going to be loaded games available exclusively, if you will, to

[06:38] Canadian club members.

[06:41] So I encourage all of you to try to get one through your distros and all that.

[06:49] But if you get shut out, Canadian club members are going to have a shot at some.

[06:55] I'm really excited to do that.

[06:58] I'm very excited for this game from what I've heard.

[07:02] It's going to be a jaw dropper.

[07:06] So like, but you know, as I said, as I said, please exhaust all of your other options because

[07:14] there's going to be more people that get locked out.

[07:17] I fear than I will have games.

[07:19] So like just, just no.

[07:23] A special Canadian plaque signed by the man.

[07:26] Probably, I'm sure we can work on that.

[07:29] They're really cool.

[07:30] We'll do it.

[07:31] I think we can have a Canadian edition.

[07:32] Canadian club member edition.

[07:34] Be fun.

[07:35] You know, it's fun.

[07:36] I've crossed the Rubicon.

[07:37] Now I'm like, am I a distro now?

[07:38] Does that mean I'm am I a sell out?

[07:40] No, no.

[07:43] I will still call this game, you know, objectively.

[07:46] I absolutely will.

[07:48] I only want that version.

[07:49] It's funny.

[07:51] Yeah, no, I just, you know, for me, the desire to own this game feels personal to me as much

[08:00] as it does professional.

[08:02] It's a personal desire to really support these guys.

[08:06] And in a game that I think is going to be incredible.

[08:11] I really do.

[08:12] I think I just feel the vibes from them.

[08:15] I see the smiles.

[08:18] I know that like evil dead, this like they got it to where they now have a game that

[08:26] when you walk by a spooky evil dead and then you see even Potter or Dune or Kong like

[08:35] they're there now in my honest opinion.

[08:38] The second most beautiful pinball platform and the second most beautiful game in all the

[08:44] pinball.

[08:45] I still think Jersey Jack's platform is still just levels above everybody else's.

[08:49] But remember, like it's $15,000.

[08:51] Spooky's going to sell you this for $9,999.

[08:57] Are you getting some pets again?

[09:02] You know, we put the dog, we want to get it.

[09:05] We'll get a dog again.

[09:06] I just need the kids to get a little bit older so they, you know, baby Cassie and Kenna.

[09:11] It's a lot on our plate.

[09:12] You know, there's, we don't have any help.

[09:14] This is something about, you don't see it because you get shows every week and the level

[09:21] of exhaustion in our family is high.

[09:25] There's no grandparents nearby to help out.

[09:27] They're nearby, but they just can't help out.

[09:29] We don't really have a babysitter.

[09:31] We don't have a nanny.

[09:33] We are doing it all.

[09:35] And so I would love a dog, but it's just too much on our plate right away.

[09:41] We really need to put our own piece of mine.

[09:44] And look, we're going to get one.

[09:46] The property is perfect for one.

[09:49] And the town is filled with beautiful little canine friends.

[09:53] Just a little bit later.

[09:54] I think sometimes you can pile too much on your plate and I just, we can't do that.

[09:59] And I, I know Brenda wants to move faster on it than I do, but I'm like, no, babe, like,

[10:03] come on, you're already beating down.

[10:05] Don't add another.

[10:07] It's hard to travel.

[10:08] You want to go away because we can take the kids.

[10:10] And we also now we have it like to find shelter for the dog.

[10:13] It's just a lot.

[10:16] Signing Franci was brilliant.

[10:17] Of course it was.

[10:19] Of course it was.

[10:23] I mean, Franci's art, just killer.

[10:27] And it's going to kill Beetlejuice.

[10:28] It's going to crush it.

[10:30] What if it's goonies?

[10:38] I love that they're making one less than Stern makes of an LE.

[10:42] I mean, now Stern's making 770 Star Wars.

[10:46] This is why Star Wars LE game.

[10:49] You know, look, how many of you, I don't even care if the game is great or not.

[10:54] Star Wars LE will sell on the second hand market immediately for $18,000.

[10:59] I just don't know what to tell you.

[11:01] It's going to sell for $18,000.

[11:07] You can hate me.

[11:08] You could say I'm just trying to pump and dump it.

[11:11] All of that might be true.

[11:13] But I'm telling you, Star Wars on the second hand market, if there's only 770, and look,

[11:18] there is no way that that that have the games ever went to Europe.

[11:26] There that Star Wars theme song, bigger Stern screen, better sound system, it's going

[11:33] to end to sell out.

[11:36] My worry was Stern at least, they don't know how to make a good LE anymore.

[11:40] Have you noticed this?

[11:43] Stern doesn't know how to make a great LE anymore.

[11:45] I mean, Jaws LE maybe, right?

[11:49] But like Kong LE, not terrible.

[11:52] Nothing special.

[11:55] I don't think James Bond LE looked too similar to the premium.

[12:01] I just don't think they made a great LE in a long time.

[12:04] They have not made that really the LE just felt so much nicer.

[12:09] D&D LE did not look nice.

[12:14] X-Men LE maybe, but again, they keep making the premiums too similar.

[12:19] I agree.

[12:20] X-Men looks nice, but the premium, they need to sandbag the lower models.

[12:25] I think X-Men was gorgeous.

[12:28] Poor X-Men by the way.

[12:30] I know it's getting better, and I think it's going to get better, but it'll never fully

[12:37] recover.

[12:39] It just won't.

[12:41] I don't even know if the mechanical side of the game was really fixed.

[12:45] Was it?

[12:46] I don't know.

[12:49] I don't know.

[12:54] Yeah, the animations are not the best.

[12:56] It's just kind of like, just doesn't feel like it's worth the money.

[13:03] No, gang, the pro should have crap on it as art.

[13:06] The pro should have just the logo.

[13:08] I'm serious.

[13:09] They need to sandbag the pros.

[13:13] X-Men is underrated.

[13:16] I don't know.

[13:16] X-Men is just, it kind of like, it kind of is what it is.

[13:23] It ended up being, unfortunately, it just ended up being, it's just all the issues with

[13:32] it.

[13:34] It's a shame.

[13:35] You can't have a game be successful when it's just going to be plagued by all those

[13:43] issues.

[13:45] Big Bang Bar is coming back.

[13:49] What I heard was there will be 250 remade.

[13:55] There will be a new art package by Stanley.

[14:00] I think it was Stanley.

[14:01] I don't want to butcher his last name.

[14:03] Before he passed away, he worked on it.

[14:06] There will be improved mechanics in the game that are really cool.

[14:12] Every time I talk about it, they get mad.

[14:15] They get mad.

[14:18] It's kind of dead flip.

[14:19] Jack, what's up brother?

[14:21] Jack, we want you back.

[14:23] Designing brother.

[14:24] Jack's on Facebook right now.

[14:25] Jack, join us over at YouTube right now.

[14:28] We're on Canadian pinball.

[14:30] Mr. Jack danger in the house.

[14:31] Jack, we love you.

[14:32] We always have.

[14:33] We always will.

[14:34] I mean, that's just the way it goes with Jack danger.

[14:36] Cool as mofo and pinball.

[14:38] He's like a tall version of canada.

[14:40] Like it's just what happens.

[14:41] Jack, I want one of those stern jackets, by the way.

[14:44] The one you wear.

[14:45] You know the one I'm talking about.

[14:46] Just be like, hey, lost mind.

[14:47] Can you guys make me another and then give me the other one?

[14:51] Okay.

[14:52] Probably a medium.

[14:53] All right, let's do it.

[14:54] It's been too long, man.

[14:57] And we need to look like twins when we go to a show.

[15:00] You know, it's gonna be great.

[15:02] It's gonna be great.

[15:04] One of my most favorite pictures ever is me, Jack danger and Carrie Hardy just laughing

[15:09] hysterically.

[15:10] It's just, it's such a good image that captures the vibes we're all going for.

[15:16] Right.

[15:17] Canada Beetlejuice Elise with retro Ralph ball drains.

[15:21] Yeah, they're going to come with a pair of retro Ralph gloves.

[15:25] He made gloves, by the way.

[15:26] Have you seen these like fingerless gloves?

[15:28] Like what's going on?

[15:29] It's weird, it's weird stuff.

[15:34] Poor Ralph.

[15:35] Poor Ralph, you know, we didn't get him back.

[15:38] Now he can't come back.

[15:39] He's been locked out.

[15:40] We locked him out.

[15:41] Now he's just there making every notice all the Ralph's like, he's like, his

[15:45] videos are always like, we always make, is there innovation left in Pimble?

[15:52] What do I think of the new get?

[15:54] It's always go look at all the thumbnail.

[15:57] Just like what?

[15:59] Who cares?

[16:00] Guys, I'll take them as I was way too seriously.

[16:02] You know, I heard Ralph's going to be in New York City.

[16:06] He's going to be in New York City September 10th when this stern Star Wars media day so

[16:13] we can't make it to stern.

[16:15] And I was like, and you can hit Ralph up.

[16:18] I am extending an offer to bring Ralph to my Japanese Jazz Bar.

[16:24] And I think we should just break bread and just bury it all.

[16:28] Like just, that's the, but I'm not going to, I'm not, you know what?

[16:32] Every time I reach out, I get ignored.

[16:33] So just, you guys can go say, hey, Kaneda would like to take you to his Japanese Jazz Bar.

[16:39] From the house, he'll be my special guest.

[16:42] We'll go in through the VIP entrance.

[16:43] We won't wait online like everybody else.

[16:45] The line is down the block.

[16:47] When you go with Kaneda, you going through the back secret entrance.

[16:51] It's the most amazing night you'll ever have.

[16:53] Jack, we got to go in your New York City.

[16:57] Oh, what's up?

[16:59] Everybody.

[17:01] He's definitely going to regret it.

[17:03] We're all having fun.

[17:05] Yeah, we're all having fun.

[17:07] We're all at, and look, when you're a grown man and you can't just like chill, you're

[17:12] going to get made fun of.

[17:14] You're going to get made fun of.

[17:16] It's just the way it goes.

[17:18] It's just the way it goes.

[17:22] Ah, yeah.

[17:23] No, it's good.

[17:24] It's good.

[17:25] It's good.

[17:26] Look, there's no, like, there's no ill-will, man.

[17:27] I mean, I see these guys at shows.

[17:29] It's all fine, you know?

[17:31] Even if they refuse to shake my hand, it's all good.

[17:33] Nothing, nothing changes.

[17:34] I can't change how I feel and how I'm vibing.

[17:38] And it's all about positive vibes, gang.

[17:41] It's all about like the new MGK album, baby.

[17:44] Trust me, Lost Americana.

[17:45] Don't sleep on it.

[17:46] It's so damn good.

[17:47] That first song is so good.

[17:49] Take me somewhere cheap where the live-in is easy.

[17:53] I mean, that's it.

[17:54] Isn't that what we all want in life?

[17:57] Cheap pinball?

[17:58] Where the gameplay is easy?

[18:02] Yeah.

[18:05] Smooth things over with a compliment regarding his gloves.

[18:09] I beat.

[18:10] I love it too.

[18:11] Like, he's got like FOMO on his gloves.

[18:14] He's like, we're only making 90-nags.

[18:16] Like, FOMO on gloves.

[18:19] And he's like, I love these guys that make stuff where like,

[18:21] I'm just breaking even to put my logo on something to get it to you guys.

[18:26] You notice how I stop selling all merch?

[18:27] I don't care.

[18:29] The amount of effort.

[18:30] I don't need to walk around.

[18:31] I don't need that.

[18:32] Rather you guys like, you know, kick your donations, your club member,

[18:37] we're making more than all these guys and we're having the most fun.

[18:41] And we're not showing anybody.

[18:43] And we're absolutely having the most fun.

[18:45] You could see it.

[18:46] They literally are not, it's all, they're all reading show notes.

[18:50] We ain't reading shit.

[18:53] But how we're vibing.

[18:54] Okay, so here's my prediction.

[18:55] Well, we got Jack Danger.

[18:56] Jack.

[18:57] Jack, I heard Star Wars is just okay.

[19:01] Is it better than okay?

[19:02] Like, I know you guys are streaming the old Star Wars games.

[19:06] Give us a little something, man, dude, seeing it, he's here, he's seen it.

[19:10] You know, just give us like, I wish they would hype it more.

[19:14] Like, where is the, I can't wait to see the mech in this game.

[19:17] Once you hear the theme song, like, we know it's Star Wars.

[19:22] I'm not getting hyped watching Borg play the daddy East game.

[19:27] I know you're, Jack literally, literally.

[19:31] Stern needs to like unleash a connate of like personality to get people more excited.

[19:39] Like, where's the excitement?

[19:43] I really, like, I just like, hey, like, I don't care about the old games.

[19:49] I want you guys to make me feel like I can't live unless I get your new game.

[19:59] Because we all know we don't need it.

[20:02] Make me want it.

[20:04] This is it, Stern.

[20:06] No, it is not.

[20:07] We really isn't, but like, whatever, whatever.

[20:10] So, like, I think it's come in soon.

[20:13] You know, I don't understand why there's not more of a little bit of, like, like, it's a week.

[20:20] It's a week away.

[20:21] It's gonna be a fun week.

[20:23] Beautiful time of year, by the way.

[20:24] It's like, either to wait, right?

[20:25] It's easy to wait when the weather's perfect.

[20:27] And, you know, you don't really want to be inside.

[20:29] It's easy.

[20:31] It's easy.

[20:31] Single tie fighter.

[20:32] You know, it's funny about Stern sometimes.

[20:38] It's like, literally George Gomez walked by that tie fighter on the spring.

[20:47] And he's like, all right, this works.

[20:51] Right?

[20:52] Like, literally, I love George Gomez.

[20:56] But like, man, George, how did you, when you walked by a Richie's game, how come you

[21:01] weren't like, Steve, get over here for a minute?

[21:05] What the, is that?

[21:08] We have Star Wars, bro.

[21:12] What is this?

[21:13] What is this Bob Oh Head tie fighter thing going here?

[21:16] Like, what is this?

[21:17] What is that screen?

[21:18] Stupid.

[21:19] What is that?

[21:20] Like, what, what was your idea that you're just gonna slap the lock down bar button?

[21:24] That's right.

[21:25] That's gonna, that's how you shoot tie fighters.

[21:27] Let me see.

[21:28] Steve, come on.

[21:29] What are we doing here?

[21:31] Stern pinball.

[21:32] Where the world's number one pinball company, you put a tie fighter on the spring.

[21:35] This guy, Knade, is gonna kill us.

[21:37] It's gonna effing kill us.

[21:39] The dude doesn't even play pinball and he's gonna kill us.

[21:45] You know, he's insecure.

[21:47] He's wearing multiple necklaces like what one's paying?

[21:50] Like what's with this guy?

[21:53] He doesn't even understand pinball rules.

[21:54] He hasn't put his podcast on a pair of gloves.

[21:58] He's not even doing gloves this year.

[22:00] He's not even doing gloves.

[22:02] And he's got an audience.

[22:04] More people watch his Facebook lives than we even sell of games.

[22:07] He's 4,000 people are watching every video now.

[22:10] He's not showing respect everybody.

[22:12] He's not, he's not even gonna come here.

[22:15] How are we gonna win this guy over?

[22:21] Stupid get you.

[22:22] Look, this is it.

[22:24] This is it.

[22:25] This is it.

[22:26] Like this game better be it.

[22:28] All right, so like there's a dude that automated and I was thinking about going there to play

[22:33] the latest.

[22:34] I might text Frank DiAngelo.

[22:36] He's usually in here.

[22:38] Frank Mack and see if we want to go over there.

[22:40] Automated it's only 30 minute drive north.

[22:42] So it's there now.

[22:43] So like it's a beautiful day.

[22:44] I might just take the demon up there.

[22:46] I don't know.

[22:47] I need an oil change.

[22:49] But my oil level is fine.

[22:53] I think it's just like after a certain amount of miles it's saying that too.

[22:56] I don't know like I don't or I don't think it's detecting like it needs new oil.

[23:00] Because I it's just I've got the oil.

[23:05] Yeah I called the dealership today.

[23:06] They're like yeah drop it off.

[23:07] We can sneak it in leave it leave it with us.

[23:09] And I'm not leaving you my demon.

[23:11] No.

[23:13] I will wait for an oil change.

[23:17] Make sure the June code is up to date and crank the volume.

[23:20] All right.

[23:21] Yeah.

[23:22] No I carry so carry man.

[23:24] Are you getting a dude?

[23:27] Yeah it's based on miles right Mike.

[23:31] Yes.

[23:32] Yeah and it probably doesn't need it because I already got the oil change like a few months

[23:36] ago.

[23:37] I don't know how to reset that statement though.

[23:41] Yeah.

[23:44] I know cars don't detect quality of oil.

[23:52] I drive my demon.

[23:53] This thing's got 60 300 miles on it in the demon space.

[23:57] That's a lot like these guys it's still in the original tires.

[24:01] Horenda's story of my friend was holding on to my replacement demon tires.

[24:05] He threw him out.

[24:06] They're now worth $5,000.

[24:07] You can't find them.

[24:08] They don't even make him anymore.

[24:09] And he's like bro I'll buy you dinner Mike do you throughout my tires at worth five

[24:14] thousand dollars and you want to just buy me dinner.

[24:17] And he's not even offering to pay for replacements.

[24:22] It just takes all the patients sometimes to be an adult that have friends that kind of

[24:27] suck.

[24:29] Yeah.

[24:30] I mean who does that who like moves houses and doesn't tell you he's moving and then

[24:35] throws out your fucking items.

[24:37] I'm sorry for cursing.

[24:38] Who does that?

[24:39] Like it's still like I just would never do that.

[24:43] Just give me a call.

[24:44] I would have come and picked them up.

[24:47] It was a hard time for him is dad has to wear I get it I get it.

[24:50] Just give me a call.

[24:51] Just give me a call and I'll pick him up.

[24:53] Fine we we we made up.

[24:54] I mean my because my friendship with him is like really like goes much deeper than tires.

[25:03] Anyway.

[25:07] Yeah.

[25:11] So how many of you let me ask you a question how many of you have a on the list for Star Wars.

[25:19] I'm shocked that the this hype thread is not really blowing up.

[25:23] Is it even like 10 pages by now.

[25:27] I mean I get it it's like yeah it's like more Star Wars right we all knew it was Star

[25:32] Wars so I you know that's why the hype page is kind of just Neil McCray trying to

[25:36] shield for Stern.

[25:37] Have you noticed Neil is like the biggest Stern family ever.

[25:40] It's just like it never it never sees it to me like literally he's like I'm tired

[25:46] of hype threads he starts the hype thread.

[25:48] He started it.

[25:52] Good old Neil he's a good guy.

[25:54] It's got a lot of money flies around the world.

[25:56] I mean I feel like he's just making money in his sleep which is good and he just flies

[25:59] around the world.

[26:00] He's like you know he's an ambassador for the sport of him.

[26:06] They need Jack to sink Kong to hype Star Wars.

[26:09] Tote in.

[26:11] Here's the thing big bang bar is coming out before Tote and remake.

[26:17] Do we need another Star Wars.

[26:18] Yes Carl because we never had a great modern Star Wars game.

[26:22] So that's why I say yes we do need another Star Wars.

[26:26] I don't think we've ever had a great modern Star Wars game.

[26:31] And that's I think I don't think anyone would disagree with that.

[26:34] Would anyone disagree with that?

[26:35] Like have we had a great modern Star Wars game.

[26:37] It's not the Steve Richie game game.

[26:40] I want to take that's high fighter on the spring.

[26:42] I hate the hyper drive the way it's like it's cool but it like it's it takes up too much

[26:47] room.

[26:48] It's also not you know part of the storyline.

[26:54] Yeah well I'm going to get the oil change on Wednesday.

[27:04] The Dodge dealership.

[27:05] Does it matter where you get the oil change.

[27:07] Let me ask you guys that question because I could go to I could go to Valveline and they

[27:12] could do it today.

[27:14] Or should I take it to Dodge.

[27:18] The thing is Valveline wanted to use their oil but I'm like no I want you to use the

[27:22] pens oil.

[27:23] Yeah.

[27:24] Yeah I'm going to Dodge.

[27:28] Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

[27:30] Yeah because like if you need new oil filters and stuff like that it's a demon like

[27:34] they've got the right stuff.

[27:40] Who's on code for Star Wars.

[27:41] Do we know?

[27:45] Why don't you have a motorcycle.

[27:47] I'll carry you want me to tell you the truth on that.

[27:51] My mother is why I don't have a motorcycle.

[27:58] My mother said she will write me out of the will if I ever get a motorcycle.

[28:08] She loves me too much she said.

[28:11] What I'm going to get is a Vespa.

[28:14] Come on.

[28:15] I'm a Premadana.

[28:16] I'm an insecure Premadana pansy.

[28:18] Come on.

[28:19] I'm on a Vespa with a silk scarf.

[28:21] That's how Canadian is going to roll around this town.

[28:24] Yeah.

[28:27] Exactly like a little Italian scooter you know pinky out sipping my you know my espresso gentlemen.

[28:35] Have you heard about Stone Pimbaugh's latest limited edition Star Wars game.

[28:41] The fine folks over there in Ilk Grove Illinois would like to sell us a 770 edition version

[28:48] of the Star Wars game.

[28:51] It's it's Alex.

[28:52] They've already done episodes for through six.

[28:55] It writes my good man.

[28:56] Are we chaps are we getting one?

[28:59] Are we getting one?

[29:01] I should do like a canada's double breasted Pimbaugh tournament where like you literally

[29:05] have to wear double breasted jacket to compete in the tournament.

[29:09] Like let's bring some class.

[29:10] Have you seen the way people dress at Pimbaugh tournaments?

[29:13] Have you smell the way people smell at Pimbaugh tournaments?

[29:17] I think we class it up.

[29:18] I think we do canada's double breasted Pimbaugh extravaganza.

[29:22] And the winner gets like a tailored suit.

[29:25] You know what I'm saying?

[29:26] Like like a Pimbaugh machine in a habidashary sounds like a great idea.

[29:32] We're all everyone looks like they just got like.

[29:37] I don't even know like everyone looks like they're going to paint a house at a Pimbaugh

[29:41] show.

[29:42] They look like they're about to go paint a house.

[29:48] Yeah.

[29:55] A photo of me walking towards the Vespa like a cure would be amazing.

[30:00] Carry.

[30:01] Carry, when you were at a multi-morphic, how many people were there making games?

[30:06] Like I saw a couple of people there.

[30:08] But what was like the total staff like?

[30:11] Yeah, it just felt like Jerry's got all these parts.

[30:16] And like, but nobody's like doing anything.

[30:19] Like I, you know, the tour was great.

[30:23] Thank you for doing it.

[30:25] But like how many people are actually there?

[30:27] Five?

[30:28] That's it.

[30:31] That's it.

[30:32] There's more.

[30:33] It just felt like nobody was there.

[30:34] It's like one dude's like, you know, like, like he's like, here's the portal sticker.

[30:40] Or is it like like what?

[30:41] Stick them on, bro.

[30:42] Make the damn games.

[30:43] Get them out the door.

[30:44] Yeah.

[30:45] Total staff.

[30:47] Three, we spoke about that a bit actually.

[30:50] And what did he say?

[30:51] Like, I like legit.

[30:56] It just felt empty.

[30:59] I don't find no, no, no, no, no, finding good help is not hard.

[31:04] If you if you pay for it, what he's trying to find, you know, this is the problem with

[31:08] manufacturing.

[31:09] You got to find like, you have to find like almost like temp type workers.

[31:14] And you don't pay them.

[31:16] So like, yeah, like if you would, I'd rather work at McDonald's making french fries than

[31:22] sitting there in a, you know, in a in a three person pinball company trying to screw together

[31:27] portals.

[31:28] That's the problem.

[31:32] He hires people they don't want to work.

[31:34] They go to Chick-fil-A.

[31:35] Yeah.

[31:36] Because it's like, what, you know, what we know that pay is crap.

[31:41] Yeah, no, and spooky.

[31:46] It's like, it's a family like, that's the thing is like, if you walk through the door

[31:50] every day, would you want to carry like carry between us?

[31:53] Pretend no one's listening.

[31:54] Would you want to walk through the door every day there and like be like slowly screwing

[31:58] together like princess brides, right?

[32:00] Right?

[32:01] It's like three people there.

[32:03] And you're, you know, but also it would make me nervous too.

[32:08] Like, I don't know, like, it's like quality control and only having that many people,

[32:14] like, just feels like, come on, man, like, that's not like a manufacturing facility.

[32:20] It's, it's a glorified garage build when you have that few people.

[32:24] I mean, I could fit three people in this garage and we could screw together the games.

[32:38] I don't know how many people were at barrels?

[32:42] You went to barrels too, right?

[32:44] How many people were at barrels when you went there?

[32:51] It's, you know, I really do think, wow, okay, so good.

[32:58] So barrels over 20.

[33:01] That's kind of like Dutch, you know, I feel like barrels is around the size of like Dutch

[33:03] pimple.

[33:09] And how many were at Turner?

[33:14] Turner Pimbal trying to sell that $10,000 Merlin's arcade man.

[33:18] It's not happening.

[33:19] A yellow armor.

[33:20] Chris man, you never, Chris's mistake is he never should have sold Raza to Melvin.

[33:26] He should have just made Raza.

[33:28] He would have sold the Raza's more than Merlin's arcade.

[33:30] I don't know why.

[33:34] Like he brought Merlin's arcade to market.

[33:37] I don't know why.

[33:43] There were two people at Merlin, okay, like this is like, how, how can you like make games

[33:52] like that?

[33:54] Like in the end, I mean, this Jerry, Chris Turner.

[34:00] The American, all of that should have been consolidated.

[34:03] Like AP should have set up a company where that not only will they make AP games, but they'll

[34:10] crank out Turner's games.

[34:13] They'll crank out Jerry's games.

[34:15] This way you have, you know, 20 people every month cranking out 20 games a week for somebody.

[34:26] You will get orders, but to have each of these companies independently manufacturing with

[34:33] like two to five people, I don't get it.

[34:37] I don't get it.

[34:45] I don't get it.

[34:46] I don't get how these guys stay in business to be honest.

[34:51] I don't get it.

[34:52] I mean, I don't get it.

[34:53] The overhead, all those parts, like just sitting there, just every day, parts, you're just

[34:58] walking, you're staring at parts.

[35:00] It would drive me crazy.

[35:02] Guys, want to talk to Archipim Ball?

[35:11] What's up?

[35:12] You know, the tariffs, you know, there was more talk about Ninja than Avatar.

[35:19] I don't, I don't carry.

[35:21] Come on, man.

[35:22] What do you, there was no talk about either.

[35:26] I mean, there was no talk about Avatar.

[35:28] So like, yeah, like I just, it was like, yeah, you know, I can hear people say probably,

[35:33] like, yeah, there's more, I have more fun on Ninja clips for like half the price.

[35:36] Maybe that.

[35:37] Look, I think it's going to get real interesting in the next couple of months.

[35:45] We're going to get through the three new games.

[35:48] There's going to be four new games that disrupt the market.

[35:52] You ready for them?

[35:53] Star Wars, Walking Dead Remastered, Beetlejuice and Big Bang Bar Remake.

[36:00] All of that will be announced, revealed and showcased between now and December.

[36:09] Expect Big Bang Bar to be announced sometime around Expo, 250 coming back.

[36:18] Fortunately, the company's putting its logo real big on the back box.

[36:22] I don't like it.

[36:23] They need to get that off.

[36:24] It's just not good.

[36:26] Doesn't look good.

[36:27] They're, they're going to get mad.

[36:30] They can't touch us.

[36:37] Oh, carry just spoiled.

[36:46] Carry did it.

[36:47] I didn't do it.

[36:48] Carry did it.

[36:49] I didn't do it.

[36:50] Carry said it.

[36:51] Carry said it.

[36:53] It's not my fault.

[37:00] Don't yell at me.

[37:02] Carry hearty.

[37:07] I can't confirm or deny what carry just said.

[37:10] All right.

[37:12] I can't confirm or deny it.

[37:15] Once again on Canada's Pinball Live, we're getting exclusive stuff.

[37:18] And where's the super chats gang?

[37:20] I'm going to about to give myself some, oh, am I going to about to pay myself?

[37:26] Is it Petretti?

[37:27] Is it DP?

[37:30] Would you rather have Dutch Pimble?

[37:31] I'll tell you this.

[37:40] I don't know.

[37:42] I don't know if it's Petretti.

[37:44] It's someone, I don't know for sure either to be honest.

[37:47] I haven't seen too much, but Rick at Planetary owns the license.

[37:55] You guys know that.

[37:59] JPL just said, well, Stern used Petretti to guide a voice to Bacca.

[38:03] Oh, man.

[38:04] I don't know.

[38:05] I don't know what the callouts will be.

[38:13] OK, so here's your options for who's remaking Big Bang Bar.

[38:17] Pinball, brother's Petretti gaming, Hexapimball, Dutch Pimball.

[38:23] And my missing anyone home pin, it's not going to be home pin.

[38:28] Now, look, everybody would want it to be CGC if they were on schedule.

[38:32] I don't know.

[38:32] I see they're building those Merlens or Cades.

[38:35] Here's the thing about Big Bang Bar remake.

[38:39] It's going to be cool.

[38:40] It's going to be beautiful.

[38:41] It's going to be cool.

[38:43] It's going to be different.

[38:45] And it's going to be collectible.

[38:46] And it's going to sell out.

[38:48] This is why these guys, when they're like, oh, they want to,

[38:51] they get all pissy about me talking about it.

[38:54] It's like shut up.

[38:54] You're going to sell everyone.

[38:56] You know, it's not a secret.

[38:58] The cats out of the bag.

[38:59] This little tiny little hobby, people here talk.

[39:03] So yeah, pinball is going to have the return of Big Bang Bar.

[39:10] And it's going to be this year.

[39:13] Cool.

[39:14] Look, Rick at Planetary Man, he's sitting on like a lot of stuff that will sell.

[39:18] You know, I don't know.

[39:20] If you own a Big Bang Bar, one of the remakes, you know, your game is going to lose value.

[39:30] This one's going to be nicer in every way.

[39:32] They did some, they improved geometry on stuff.

[39:35] They improved mechs.

[39:35] The pole dancer has been improved.

[39:37] The soup's super cool.

[39:39] It's just going to be a cooler Big Bang Bar.

[39:42] You know, I was talking to my friend, Kim Mitchell.

[39:43] He's like, I'm glad I sold mine because I knew this was going to happen.

[39:57] Well, you know, the thing is, the thing is, the thing that's going to get tricky now,

[40:01] gang, is the tariffs with people, right?

[40:03] Because if this game's going to be made overseas,

[40:06] tariffs, man, it's like, it's going to get difficult for these European companies.

[40:15] Here's the thing though, if you make 250 Big Bang bars, you'll sell them all in Europe only.

[40:24] I mean, you would sell them.

[40:28] You know, I know there's been some talk like, maybe we just sell them here.

[40:33] Like, does anyone know what is the real issue with Star Wars and overseas distribution?

[40:39] Like, can you get a Star Wars, Ellie in Europe or no?

[40:45] I'm still confused.

[40:53] Like, I've played Big Bang bars.

[40:54] It's not even that good of a game.

[40:57] It's not.

[40:57] It's the most overrated game I think ever.

[40:59] It was just famous for being rare.

[41:03] Can someone in Europe, like Dave Sanders, you know, nobody knows, like, what's the, like,

[41:10] I feel like people are trying to say I was wrong.

[41:14] I don't know.

[41:15] I feel like Stern is not sending Star Wars at least to Europe.

[41:21] Are they?

[41:22] I don't care either way.

[41:24] I just, that's what I heard.

[41:25] Now that Cuphead is dead.

[41:31] Why doesn't Ryan McQuay just share it?

[41:35] Like, why does he just like, just like, if I were Ryan, I would just share it,

[41:40] try to get people excited to maybe convince someone to make it or buy the title to produce.

[41:48] Great shows says Alejandro Traveria.

[41:55] Traveria Traveria.

[41:58] Great show Star Wars is good.

[41:59] Her news.

[42:03] Hope Star Wars is good.

[42:04] Yes.

[42:04] I Alejandro.

[42:06] I hope Star Wars is amazing.

[42:07] I keep saying this.

[42:09] I want Star Wars to sort of remind us all why we love Pimball in the first place.

[42:14] And, you know, John Borg gets what we love.

[42:18] What I keep hearing about Star Wars is that it's going to be a game that casuals will really enjoy.

[42:25] I think they're going to make it more mainstream in terms of its layout, which means fan layout.

[42:30] I think, you know, and I think it's going to, I think they're going to, you know,

[42:33] they're not going to take any crazy creative, like leaps on this game.

[42:37] I think Borg's going to put in, I think it's going to be a lot of his recycled mechs that you love.

[42:41] I think we're going to see the ad ad is going to be the mech suit from Avatar that he made that falls down.

[42:50] Makes total sense.

[42:51] Like the mech suit in Avatar falls down.

[42:54] I think we're going to see the ad ad do that.

[42:56] I also think Borg is going to use the NBA, Aero Smith shooting the ball up into something is going to be the Millennium Falcon popping out of the, of the, you know, the creature's mouth when it needs to escape.

[43:15] I think that's going to be a moment.

[43:17] I think there's going to be some ball flying like that.

[43:22] I do. I think he's going to, I think he's going to use those two mechs.

[43:25] And then we know Borg loves magnets and we want magnets and Star Wars.

[43:31] So like, yeah.

[43:35] I think it's going to be just again, and makes all of us curious.

[43:40] I can't wait to see it.

[43:41] I can't wait to go to the beach today, by the way.

[43:43] Canada.

[43:45] Come on, Ralph.

[43:46] Send me some gloves.

[43:48] My hands feel so they feel,

[43:51] they feel naked without retro, retro Ralph gloves on.

[43:57] Oh my God.

[43:59] Oh my God.

[44:00] I'm not going to, I'm not going to please myself until I got those gloves on my hands from now on.

[44:04] I want to feel the shape.

[44:07] You know, last time we went to a restaurant locally and I was like, I ordered a $75 steak that sucked.

[44:14] And I'm never going back.

[44:16] Um, it was like literally this wagyu, you know, it was flavorless.

[44:23] It was overcooked.

[44:25] You know, I was going to send it back.

[44:28] And I just like, Brenda, like, whatever.

[44:30] Like, I don't even want to, like, I'm never coming back.

[44:33] Like, my new thing now is you can't cook a $75 steak, right?

[44:38] I'm never coming back.

[44:41] You know, I hate, I hate overcooked meat.

[44:45] And, you know, I've got some really great restaurants here.

[44:49] Roed and seafood is the best.

[44:51] Like, the food is good.

[44:53] It's not like, but it's not about, it's just the vibes, the environment you'll see.

[44:59] It's right on the water.

[45:00] It's incredible.

[45:00] They got a boat.

[45:01] It's called the Pearl owner and his son and his family run.

[45:06] Like, they, it's just their great people.

[45:07] Like, the vibe in there is so amazing.

[45:10] You know, the older I get, the less I want to like branch out to all and try all these new places.

[45:13] No, you, you find where the bites are amazing and they know your name when you walk through the door.

[45:19] And I don't need anything else anymore.

[45:20] I don't need to go around and like, find all this new stuff.

[45:24] It's like, food is food is food.

[45:25] Like, give me the good stuff with the good people and the good vibes and the good service.

[45:28] And that's what matters most.

[45:31] So I'm really like, I don't know, what day do you think we're going to see Star Wars?

[45:36] See, this is the other part that I kind of is annoying.

[45:38] Like, why don't we have a revealed date?

[45:42] Like, like, why, why isn't there like a date?

[45:47] By which all of us are like, you know, like blocking out our calendars.

[45:53] Like, is it the 10th?

[45:55] Is it the 7th?

[45:56] Is it the?

[45:58] You're literally like less than 10 days away and we don't know when it is.

[46:02] This mark, like, what are you doing?

[46:03] Like, what are they doing?

[46:06] September 8th.

[46:07] Carrie says, but did they say that?

[46:09] Carrie, is there like a 9, 8, 25?

[46:14] Are they hyping that?

[46:15] Is it just like, I don't understand.

[46:20] Like, where has that been communicated?

[46:23] I haven't seen anything.

[46:26] The thing is, is like, I actually think that this is why the media day is silly to me.

[46:34] Because like, you know, like, everyone's already seen it.

[46:39] Like, I think they do it all wrong.

[46:41] I think the media should come in before it's revealed to the world.

[46:44] I think we should sign NDAs.

[46:45] I think we should hand over our cell phones.

[46:47] And I think we each each each content creator should get a room with a game

[46:52] and nobody else in it and let us bang on it for a couple hours.

[46:56] Don't let us have any devices on us.

[46:59] Close door rooms.

[47:01] I don't want to see like don't don't like

[47:04] heard in like, you know, 25 content creators into that stern alley room.

[47:12] It's too crowded.

[47:13] It's too loud.

[47:14] It's the worst way to intimately experience a game for the first time.

[47:17] I want to walk into a pitch black room with just the game on.

[47:23] Nope.

[47:23] I want it sound dampening room.

[47:25] I want pitch black.

[47:26] I want to walk up to it and I want to experience it in the best possible way.

[47:33] What they give is it's crap, right?

[47:37] And like, and you could see it.

[47:38] Like people are not like getting the right experience.

[47:41] It's the worst way to sort of reveal a product.

[47:45] They've got a new chief market in the office, marketing officer.

[47:48] Like they like, why is it so hard for these people companies to understand that?

[47:52] You bring in carry, you bring in canady, you bring in Ralph, you bring in,

[47:55] bring them all in separately.

[47:59] And then you embargo their coverage.

[48:02] So I can make videos whether I'm hyping it or that's how you should do it.

[48:09] They don't want to do that.

[48:10] No, no, they want you to pay out of your own pocket.

[48:14] These guys are going to pay $600 to $1,000 out of their own pocket to get what?

[48:33] Did he say that that job is in the game?

[48:37] Is he serious?

[48:38] Like that's in the game?

[48:40] Why would he show that?

[48:43] Just looks terrible.

[48:54] He said it's in the game.

[48:55] I think he's trolling.

[48:56] I don't think he's being serious.

[49:03] I'm really curious how the title is going to work.

[49:09] I don't even like the logo.

[49:10] I think they didn't make it good.

[49:13] It looked like AI generated.

[49:14] It just looks sloppy.

[49:15] Like the font, the E was wrong.

[49:17] The R was not.

[49:19] It didn't go to the edge of the border.

[49:21] And the border wasn't sharp.

[49:22] Like the movie, like Empire Strikes, the Empire.

[49:26] It should also be called the fall of the Empire.

[49:29] I just think the fall of the Empire sounds better.

[49:32] It's like the Empire strikes back.

[49:35] Add the the.

[49:37] It just sounds better.

[49:38] It looks better when you write it in the logo.

[49:39] The fall of the Empire.

[49:45] You know, fall of the Empire?

[49:47] Make it more, I don't know.

[49:49] It feels more dramatic with the the in it.

[49:54] The.

[49:55] The number one pinball podcast in the world.

[50:01] I'm looking at all my trippies.

[50:04] So speaking of trippies, right?

[50:06] I know Collins trying to reboot it.

[50:08] He's you know, he knows, he's funny.

[50:09] He's like, he wasn't going to do it.

[50:11] He's now trying to reboot it because

[50:12] canadus said it wasn't happening.

[50:14] He's literally doing it to try to prove me wrong.

[50:17] Which is funny.

[50:18] I'm so happy.

[50:19] We're going to make him do work.

[50:21] And the show's going to suck.

[50:23] It's going to suck.

[50:24] Like he has no idea what he's doing.

[50:27] He has no vision for it.

[50:28] It's going to suck.

[50:29] And I literally can't wait to sit back this year.

[50:34] You know, maybe Kellen, I are going to just get together,

[50:36] get some whiskey's and some popcorn and just sit back and watch it suck.

[50:41] It's a shame that our hobby does not have a great end of the year award show.

[50:47] It's a shame.

[50:48] We were there.

[50:48] We had it.

[50:49] We all experienced it when it was good.

[50:50] And it turned into total garbage.

[50:54] It was garbage.

[50:55] It was garbage last year.

[50:58] I mean, 45 minutes.

[51:00] I know Wi-Fi.

[51:01] Like the whole thing was just like, what's happening here?

[51:06] Garbage.

[51:07] You didn't even need to do it live.

[51:08] They should have just like, they should have just recorded it,

[51:11] edited it in the right way.

[51:13] And because there's no advantage to live.

[51:16] There's no advantage.

[51:17] Nobody's there that's getting in an award.

[51:18] Nobody.

[51:25] You know, the thing about Kellen is, you know,

[51:31] again, I think his intent is in the right place.

[51:37] But once again, I think he just chooses

[51:42] to take the wrong side of things.

[51:44] And you know, it's unfortunate.

[51:46] Like him and I were fine.

[51:47] I don't know.

[51:47] He just like started.

[51:49] You could tell like, he just, he seems really

[51:52] what's the word I'm looking for?

[51:55] What's the word I'm looking for?

[51:56] Starts with a W.

[51:58] It ends with an E.

[52:01] I think he's really woke.

[52:04] And when he, you could see it.

[52:07] Like he was really trying to just like,

[52:09] cater and virtual signal alone.

[52:11] He was doing those stories around JK Rowling.

[52:14] And like, you know, trying to like align

[52:16] with the extreme members of our community that, you know,

[52:21] and you could see like why you doing this?

[52:23] Like why are you writing these stories?

[52:25] It's because he's trying to virtual signal.

[52:27] And that's what woke people do.

[52:30] They pretend to be like, you know,

[52:35] all high in mighty.

[52:36] And it's like, this is a pinball, bro.

[52:37] Like walk around the damn floor.

[52:39] Like this is, this is not, you're not,

[52:42] that's not the audience here.

[52:46] We're back.

[52:48] Anyway, and I don't care if you're

[52:50] woke or not, just, you know, again,

[52:52] but if you're trying to make a living

[52:54] at a pinball content, man, being like,

[52:58] you know, being like really far progressive to the left

[53:02] is not really going to, really going to win you the audience.

[53:05] You know, when in Rome, baby, that's why I'm moderate,

[53:08] a Kylian.

[53:10] Where are you going?

[53:14] Or you say hi?

[53:14] I don't know, can I?

[53:18] Say hi.

[53:19] Bye bye.

[53:20] Bye.

[53:20] Hi.

[53:21] Yeah.

[53:22] I'm gonna share what that was.

[53:26] All the air.

[53:27] So much energy.

[53:30] You know, I'm raising these kids to be

[53:33] like their daddy, moderate, socially liberal,

[53:37] ischalink conservative, treat everybody with respect,

[53:41] treat people how you want to be treated.

[53:44] That's it.

[53:45] That's it.

[53:45] And don't mess with kids.

[53:47] Don't mess with children.

[53:50] Don't try to introduce them to overly complex things.

[53:55] They don't understand yet in the name of normalization.

[53:59] It's not normal to try to introduce kids

[54:03] to things they don't understand yet.

[54:05] Get that out of my family.

[54:08] I will raise them to be respectful of everybody.

[54:12] I will raise them to use common sense,

[54:14] but don't ever come after children

[54:18] and their purity and their innocence

[54:20] with that sort of agenda.

[54:22] That is why you will lose elections forever until you stop.

[54:28] It's just the way it goes.

[54:30] It's the way it goes.

[54:31] If you want to go after family values

[54:34] and you want to go after children

[54:36] and if you want to go after women,

[54:38] female sports, if you want to go after it,

[54:40] you're going to lose.

[54:43] Forever.

[54:45] So keep doing it.

[54:46] Keep changing, crack a barrel of logos.

[54:49] Keep doing this stuff in the end.

[54:53] I do believe this is the greatest country in the world.

[54:55] I do believe you have an idea you can make it here.

[54:57] Not easy.

[54:59] Look at spooky Luke.

[55:00] Just join.

[55:01] Look at, look at, look at spooky Pimba.

[55:03] American Dream.

[55:05] No one's going to knock on your door

[55:07] and take it away from you.

[55:09] Nobody.

[55:11] You know, it's funny.

[55:12] Like Brenda Sisters and Amsterdam.

[55:15] Like everybody hates America.

[55:16] Everybody.

[55:17] Yeah.

[55:17] Good.

[55:17] Good.

[55:18] Hate on us.

[55:20] Hate on us.

[55:21] Man.

[55:23] I love this country.

[55:24] My parents came from nothing.

[55:27] Nothing.

[55:29] Immigrants.

[55:30] They're grandparents from Italy.

[55:32] From there's Rebecca on camera.

[55:35] There it is.

[55:36] Hi.

[55:37] We're talking smack.

[55:41] Hey, I don't care less.

[55:42] I could care less.

[55:43] In the end, if Brenda had stayed in Ireland,

[55:47] she would not have got to where she got to.

[55:50] The opportunities are not there.

[55:54] She came to America.

[55:56] Now she's got this great life.

[55:59] She's happy.

[56:01] She's blessed.

[56:03] It's amazing.

[56:04] And look, there's great places everywhere.

[56:06] There's great people everywhere.

[56:08] But this anti-American sentiment,

[56:10] the way in it.

[56:11] I've noticed this a lot.

[56:12] As I look at my American muscle car,

[56:14] I've just noticed this a lot.

[56:15] There's a lot of like, it's like the people that claim

[56:17] that they're fighting for stuff,

[56:20] they really hate America though.

[56:22] Like they're like embarrassed by us.

[56:24] And how are you going to win an election in America

[56:26] when you're like actually embarrassed by us?

[56:30] You know?

[56:31] It's like, you know, Rebecca was saying,

[56:33] why do that?

[56:34] She's like, why are there so many USA flags

[56:36] everywhere in this town?

[56:38] Right?

[56:38] I mean, I live in a very,

[56:38] there's a very,

[56:39] it's a very like left-meaning town.

[56:42] Why is it?

[56:42] Because we, because people are very patriotic.

[56:45] We, we, we look at our flag

[56:48] with a lot of adoration

[56:50] for all the sacrifices people made to be free.

[56:54] Like if you, if people don't understand that,

[56:57] like yeah, you're not, you're not flying the Irish flag

[56:59] because it's a symbol.

[57:01] It actually is a symbol of unity.

[57:03] I mean, the, the, you know,

[57:06] it's the, what, the green,

[57:08] the orange and the white in the middle.

[57:10] The white is the symbol of the unions.

[57:12] I forget like which tribes are like,

[57:13] what it all stands for.

[57:14] But, but you look at the American flag

[57:17] and it's a symbol of everybody who sacrificed

[57:20] to, to the ultimate sacrifice,

[57:23] to be free,

[57:25] to put democracy over, like socialism and communism.

[57:29] And like, so yeah, like people fly the flag proudly.

[57:34] And so when I hear people are like,

[57:35] oh yeah, an Amsterdam,

[57:36] and then like us are like in Europe,

[57:38] like everyone thinks, good, don't like us.

[57:42] We sent our boys over there to fight your war.

[57:47] Like it's funny because like it's like people forget history.

[57:50] Do you forget all of this?

[57:52] Did you forget all of this?

[57:55] Yeah, we've got our issues,

[57:56] but no other country is dealing

[57:59] with 50 states, different ideologies,

[58:02] different points of view.

[58:03] It's a melting pot of people from around the world.

[58:07] And it's still here, right?

[58:11] And we've got issues, don't, don't.

[58:13] We have a lot of issues.

[58:15] But that's also what makes us strong.

[58:17] Because we deal with those issues too.

[58:19] Just saying.

[58:24] But I'll tell you this, I'll tell you this.

[58:28] The reason we didn't end up in Ireland

[58:30] is because Ireland is way too socialistic.

[58:34] Like you'll get great benefits,

[58:36] but the opportunity to climb there so much harder,

[58:41] your money goes nowhere,

[58:44] the ability to make money is a lot harder.

[58:46] And like if you want to buy anything,

[58:49] the way they tax stuff, you guys have no idea.

[58:51] This $35,000 Toyota in Ireland would be like 60 grand.

[58:56] In euros.

[58:57] Just like what?

[59:00] You can just have a better quality of life here.

[59:04] Not to mention the weather.

[59:06] They're not going to get a week of this ever in Ireland.

[59:10] Anyway, anyway, I'm like, I again,

[59:14] I respect all people and that's why you don't see me get into it.

[59:18] I respect people, I respect discourse.

[59:21] I think people should have debates.

[59:23] I think people should be able to debate

[59:27] without personally insulting each other

[59:29] or refusing to shake hands or fighting.

[59:32] What I love about Pimball is bringing back is like,

[59:34] I love that we get to debate this stuff,

[59:36] because it's innocuous.

[59:39] And that's what's funny is like when some of these people get

[59:43] all bent out of shape or they don't want to talk to you anymore

[59:45] about Pimball drama, I think it's so funny.

[59:48] It's like, I don't know.

[59:49] I don't know.

[59:50] It's just, I love it.

[59:52] I love it.

[59:52] I know what I'm doing.

[59:53] I know that I hit a sore spot for a lot of people,

[59:56] but whatever it is, what it is.

[01:00:00] People don't know this.

[01:00:01] Ireland is the second most expensive country in all of Europe.

[01:00:05] It's Sweden and then Ireland.

[01:00:07] Second most expensive country.

[01:00:11] There's a lot of money in Ireland.

[01:00:13] And you think we're going through issues in Ireland?

[01:00:16] The main issue is they're not putting their own people first.

[01:00:23] And that's what's happening.

[01:00:26] You know, and people aren't happy about that.

[01:00:31] You can't have your own people suffering and then you're like opening up,

[01:00:34] you know, lay everyone else in and use all,

[01:00:36] and you know, and take all the benefits that you're paying for.

[01:00:41] Pinside drama.

[01:00:46] Like Ireland is great.

[01:00:46] Carry, when you go to Ireland, let me know.

[01:00:48] Go to Galway, go to Cork, go to Dingo.

[01:00:52] Dublin's all right.

[01:00:53] Just spend like a couple days in Dublin.

[01:00:55] Dublin is the worst part of Ireland.

[01:00:59] It's not, it's, it's, like Dublin's a neat city,

[01:01:02] but like you can see it all like in a, you know, day or two.

[01:01:06] But Dublin doesn't have the charm of Ireland.

[01:01:11] The charm of Ireland is when you drive and meander through Ireland.

[01:01:15] And you go to these like 800 year old pubs and you know,

[01:01:18] like trust me, stay in a dare manor, right?

[01:01:22] A dare manor is where you want to stay.

[01:01:25] Golf at a dare manor.

[01:01:26] Let me pull it up here.

[01:01:31] And you're, you will absolutely be blown away.

[01:01:36] And that's Ireland.

[01:01:40] Let's see.

[01:01:42] Trip advisor, a dare manor.

[01:01:44] It's a visit to site.

[01:01:45] This, this is heaven on earth.

[01:01:50] Like we stayed here.

[01:01:54] And I will say it's, it's so worth it.

[01:02:03] Like look at that.

[01:02:06] And you know, they just reded it.

[01:02:08] Let me, where's the other one?

[01:02:12] Let's see, trip the travel.

[01:02:14] Get some photos.

[01:02:17] Oh yeah.

[01:02:22] Just, you know, have tea here.

[01:02:28] Talk pinball.

[01:02:30] That's funny.

[01:02:34] Yeah, you know, like go to Galway, go to Chinatons.

[01:02:40] All right, just trust me.

[01:02:41] Go to Galway.

[01:02:43] Just find your way to Chi-Nokton's pub.

[01:02:46] And just drink Guinness and Jameson all day long.

[01:02:51] They'll be like live music.

[01:02:53] Everyone's in a good mood.

[01:02:55] Think about Ireland that I love.

[01:02:56] There's like nobody cares about money there.

[01:03:00] Like there's no flashing of well.

[01:03:02] There's no, they don't respect that.

[01:03:03] They're salty on the earth.

[01:03:05] They're, it's a farming nation.

[01:03:07] And so like, it's really great because when you get into conversations in Ireland,

[01:03:12] nobody cares.

[01:03:13] They're not asking like, what do you do for a living?

[01:03:15] Like in America, like we're obsessed with that,

[01:03:17] especially towns like these.

[01:03:18] Like everyone's just trying to size you up.

[01:03:20] Like what do you do?

[01:03:20] How much you make?

[01:03:21] How much square footage?

[01:03:22] Like I get it.

[01:03:23] And all y'all rich people in therapy and like, you know,

[01:03:26] alcoholics and your wife's son, antidepressants,

[01:03:28] and she's doing GLP ones.

[01:03:30] And you know, she's your wife's now all of a sudden,

[01:03:33] 50 pounds lighter in one year, jabbing herself,

[01:03:36] not eating food.

[01:03:36] Like I get it.

[01:03:37] Like is all that making people feel better?

[01:03:40] Or you just like trying to find an Ireland?

[01:03:45] They don't care about any of that.

[01:03:48] I mean, I mean, they're probably doing the GLP ones now.

[01:03:50] I mean, everybody is.

[01:03:51] I, it's just crazy.

[01:03:52] Everyone's withering away.

[01:03:54] Canad is 49 at the gym, working hard, eating healthy.

[01:03:59] I'm not, you know,

[01:04:02] is what it is.

[01:04:02] Who knows what the long term help problems are going to be with all this stuff?

[01:04:06] I think it's, I think it's tragic.

[01:04:08] The way we're not, you know, we're, we're, that's, we're doing that.

[01:04:11] We're turning on sports betting everywhere.

[01:04:12] I think that's a tragedy.

[01:04:14] And we're not regulating social media for kids.

[01:04:17] These things are like, we need to fix that.

[01:04:20] We need to.

[01:04:21] Like you, you, you have an age by which kids can drink legally.

[01:04:26] Why isn't there an age in which social media is banned until you reach a certain age?

[01:04:32] You, these parents are handing these kids these cell phones by age five,

[01:04:35] and they're just getting addicted to doom scrolling.

[01:04:38] And they wonder why these kids are messed up.

[01:04:40] They wonder why these kids don't want to like,

[01:04:43] look you in the eye.

[01:04:44] They can't talk.

[01:04:45] They can't have a real conversation.

[01:04:46] We had like our interns present.

[01:04:48] These Gen Z kids, they're looking at their phone the whole time to present.

[01:04:51] Sitting down, looking at their phone, sitting down.

[01:04:55] If you challenge them or have a question, they crumble.

[01:04:59] They crumble.

[01:05:00] They, they, they can't even deal with confrontation.

[01:05:03] And they've, they've grown up like this.

[01:05:08] I love it because like when it comes to creating presenting,

[01:05:10] like presenting creative ideas, like anyone, my generation,

[01:05:13] general slaughter them, slaughter them.

[01:05:16] Like they can't roll with it.

[01:05:18] They don't know how to roll with it in real life.

[01:05:19] They, they, they, they're just used to like sharing and

[01:05:22] emojiing their way through everything.

[01:05:25] Parents absolutely, no, my kids are not getting cell phones.

[01:05:28] We don't only, we only watch TV in this household on the weekends.

[01:05:31] That is it.

[01:05:32] When it is a school day, there is no TV on ever,

[01:05:36] ever.

[01:05:36] They come home.

[01:05:37] We're doing activities.

[01:05:39] They come home from school.

[01:05:40] We are like, we're in the backyard, we're at the beach,

[01:05:43] we're like drawing, we are, they,

[01:05:44] he, killing, killing with love to watch TV every day.

[01:05:47] Only on the weekends.

[01:05:48] It's a treat.

[01:05:55] Hate, I hate the fact that we threw social media at kids.

[01:06:00] Without even thinking about the consequences of any of it,

[01:06:03] I hate the fact that, you know, these tech billionaires

[01:06:05] are making 300 billion dollars or worth as they destroy

[01:06:09] the, you know, the psyche of humans, not even like kids.

[01:06:13] Just people are addicted to this stuff.

[01:06:19] It is, it is garbage in garbage out.

[01:06:21] It is endless doom scrolling garbage out.

[01:06:24] Everybody, you came here for pinball talk.

[01:06:27] We just started talking about all this stuff.

[01:06:28] Okay. Anyway, because it's like, it's like, there's not,

[01:06:31] we're going to talk about Star Wars when it comes out.

[01:06:33] Everybody, it's been an hour and a half.

[01:06:34] I love you guys.

[01:06:35] Have a great Saturday.

[01:06:37] Do me a favor.

[01:06:38] Give your kids a kiss.

[01:06:40] Give your wife or your partner a kiss.

[01:06:43] Enjoy your weekend, your Labor Day weekend.

[01:06:46] All right.

[01:06:47] Have a good time.

[01:06:48] We are here for a very short amount of time.

[01:06:51] And let's everybody go buy those retro Ralph gloves.

[01:06:54] Come on, he's selling them at cost.

[01:06:57] Can someone buy me a pair?

[01:06:59] Can someone please do that?

[01:07:00] Can someone go buy me a pair of retro Ralph gloves?

[01:07:05] I would love to rock them on the show next week.

[01:07:08] Can we do that?

[01:07:10] Like, I will pay pal, you, like, I don't know, I don't know how to do it.

[01:07:13] Like, like, but if someone can grab me a pair of retro Ralph gloves,

[01:07:17] I'd really appreciate it.

[01:07:20] Oh, here's where you go.

[01:07:21] I got it on good authority that Star Wars is a non-asset game.

[01:07:24] Another, no, this is, it's not a non-asset game.

[01:07:28] This guy, this is Dr. Freightner.

[01:07:30] He's wrong.

[01:07:32] You got to remember, like, how would you do a non-asset Star Wars game?

[01:07:37] So you think you're going to animate it and Disney's going to improve your,

[01:07:41] your crappy animations?

[01:07:44] There's no way.

[01:07:45] Got you's common sense.

[01:07:46] There's no, it's not going to be animated.

[01:07:49] It's going to be, it's going to be clips.

[01:07:53] There, literally, there's no, like, there's no way

[01:07:56] their stern is going to originally animate a Star Wars adventure.

[01:08:00] No, there's, that would be dead on arrival.

[01:08:02] Dead on arrival.

[01:08:05] Peace out, everybody.

[01:08:08] Larry, you're wrong.

[01:08:09] Larry, I, Larry, I know people at...
