[00:00] And the Super L East is got a lot of extra stuff on it.

[00:03] It's an expensive pinball.

[00:05] And but it's got the special topper on it,

[00:08] a special sound system, so forth.

[00:10] It's worth the money.

[00:11] And very collectible, there'll be 30 of those,

[00:14] one for each year that we were in existence

[00:18] plus another 50 for one for each year of the Batman series.

[00:23] Because it's 50th and for only 80, there will not be 81.

[00:26] Well, there goes my effort to not do any more podcasts

[00:37] until we hit Expo because breaking news, all of a sudden,

[00:41] you just heard from Gary Stern himself

[00:43] that they're going to be 80, not 30,

[00:47] but 80 Batman Super L East being offered for $15,000.

[00:52] And I just, you know, like, I know Pinsides

[00:54] are going to blow up when they hear this news

[00:56] and they're going to hear it any second now.

[00:58] And I just want to give my thoughts

[01:00] and I'm just going to be candid.

[01:03] I think this is purely a greedy move on Stern's part.

[01:06] I think this is absolutely ridiculous

[01:08] that they're doing this on one level, whatever.

[01:12] If they sell everyone cool, but the whole reason

[01:16] these things were special is they

[01:17] were making a very, very limited number, only 30

[01:21] to celebrate Stern's 30th anniversary.

[01:24] Now that they're offering another 50

[01:26] to celebrate the Batman anniversary alongside that,

[01:31] I just feel like this is just a greedy move.

[01:34] I feel like there's, it's just a silly thing.

[01:37] How many other things can they add up

[01:40] to get to these arbitrary numbers?

[01:42] Earlier in the interview, too, this is from a WGN radio

[01:46] interview with Gary Stern.

[01:47] The L.E.'s are going to be 120 for each episode

[01:51] and 120 L.E.'s for each bat gadget that's used in the show.

[01:56] I just think it's getting to the point

[01:58] where this machine has been so over-market it,

[02:01] so over-thought, and it's just feeling

[02:04] like a purely greedy celebratory move on Stern's part.

[02:10] To just up the number more than double it,

[02:13] with some arbitrary number about the Batman anniversary,

[02:17] I just don't think it's worth $15,000 anymore.

[02:21] It's funny because they follow the 4GT model of you

[02:24] have to apply to be able to get one.

[02:27] I know that Stern got over 400 applications

[02:30] to get one of the 30 Stern's super L.E.'s,

[02:34] but those people that were clamoring to get one,

[02:36] were clamoring to get one because there were 30.

[02:39] If you said there were going to be 80,

[02:42] now there's 80 of them, does that make them as special,

[02:45] as rare, as sought after?

[02:47] No, it doesn't.

[02:50] You've just more than doubled the supply,

[02:53] so the price has to decrease a little bit

[02:56] because you've made it not as rare.

[02:59] But part of me is just like whatever.

[03:01] Stern understands who they're selling to,

[03:03] and there's gonna be 80 super rich board dudes out there

[03:07] that wanna have a machine that's cooler and flashier

[03:11] and more blinged out than anyone else.

[03:14] And so like, yes, it's not a crime for them to do this,

[03:18] but I really, really, really think Stern

[03:21] is at a position now where they could corner this market

[03:24] and they could really, really establish themselves

[03:27] as the dominant player without becoming

[03:31] like this greedy company.

[03:33] And I just think this is all greed.

[03:36] That is all it is.

[03:38] They don't wanna leave money on the table.

[03:40] And yes, I know they're gonna say this is a one-time thing.

[03:43] I don't buy that.

[03:44] I think they're still gonna try and do this

[03:46] when they have other super hot titles.

[03:49] It's just getting to the point now where,

[03:52] what are we supposed to believe?

[03:54] And this is also like, as a marketer,

[03:56] this is such a marketing mistake.

[04:00] There is no, they came out and they established

[04:03] what the number was gonna be.

[04:05] And then for them to just turn around

[04:08] and just be like, oh, by the way,

[04:09] there's one and a half more of them gonna be made.

[04:13] Oh yeah, because of Batman's anniversary, right?

[04:15] It's greed, it's a hundred percent greed.

[04:17] And I think Stern has really fumbled

[04:20] this entire Batman launch.

[04:22] I just don't feel excited about it.

[04:24] It's hard to get excited because I just think

[04:27] coming out of the Ghostbusters issues

[04:29] and all the quality control issues,

[04:31] for Stern to come out and just like shove their hands

[04:36] in the people's wallets and grab all this money

[04:40] for a Stern is just, I don't know.

[04:44] It just leaves me with a bad taste

[04:47] and I think it's all in bad taste.

[04:50] And I think for the other companies out there

[04:52] who are watching this, I really think

[04:55] if they can get games out back down to reality

[04:59] in the price zone between like $78,000

[05:03] for a really awesome pinball machine,

[05:06] I think the door is gonna be open

[05:09] for consumers to go elsewhere.

[05:12] Again, I say that,

[05:13] no one else has the production ready to go.

[05:15] No one else is like a really authentic pinball manufacturing

[05:19] company.

[05:21] The only one who could really do it is Jack.

[05:23] And I hope Jack can get there because there's no competition.

[05:27] Stern can keep doing this.

[05:28] I've got him monopoly on the market.

[05:30] So there you have it.

[05:32] This is a short little breaking news podcast

[05:35] from Canada.

[05:36] Stern's releasing 80 Batman Super LEs.

[05:39] I think it's a greedy move.

[05:40] If you're hearing me over there at Stern,

[05:42] I think you guys need to get in a room

[05:45] and get your marketing ship together.

[05:47] This is not good marketing.

[05:48] You are just making people think you're silly.

[05:52] You're not doing it right.

[05:54] You had this whole application process.

[05:56] People did all this work and now all of a sudden,

[06:00] you know, you just changed the reality of the game.

[06:04] You changed the game midway through the game.

[06:07] And I get it.

[06:08] If you're a company, you can do what you want.

[06:10] I think if people go in on this machine,

[06:13] I think it's a little foolish.

[06:15] I wouldn't spend $15,000 on one.

[06:18] Again, because I just think it's just the way

[06:19] Stern is doing it.

[06:20] If they were only making like a superversion

[06:23] of Batman to celebrate their birthday,

[06:25] and if there was only 80 games in all existence,

[06:28] then yes, these things would definitely

[06:29] warrant that kind of price.

[06:31] But the fact that there's gonna be Ellie's

[06:33] and then there's gonna be premiums

[06:34] and it's all the same game.

[06:35] I think this whole fiasco is a joke.

[06:38] I think Stern looks really poor here.

[06:40] And I think the marketing team

[06:41] should kind of go back to the drawing board

[06:43] and ask themselves,

[06:45] are we trying to make people like our company

[06:47] or we just trying to piss people off

[06:49] and do stuff that makes us look like

[06:50] a bunch of greedy bastards?

[06:53] And if I go to that 30th birthday party,

[06:55] I swear to God, and the drinks aren't free,

[06:57] I swear to God, Stern, for fuck's sake,

[07:00] if you're gonna throw a birthday party

[07:02] and you're gonna dive into people's pockets

[07:04] and want $15,000, those drinks better be fucking free.

[07:08] I'm putting you guys on notice.

[07:09] If I have to pull them, I wall it at that birthday party.

[07:11] That's not a birthday party.

[07:12] You don't invite people to your party

[07:14] and then make them pay for the drinks.

[07:16] That is also greedy.

[07:19] All right, go back to watching football.
