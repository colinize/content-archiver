[00:00] I keep going to the river to break this I need

[00:06] Something that go a shock of pain and I'm lost

[00:11] I'm sleeping all these demons away

[00:14] What's your ghost? The ghost that you wake is me awake

[00:25] Welcome to episode 151 of Canadian Spinball Podcast

[00:29] I'm your host canada it's Friday night in New York City and I've spent hours

[00:33] Editing and getting this podcast ready for you because I promise my friends over in the United Kingdom

[00:40] I would have this podcast up for them the night of the interview so I got to interview Neil McCray

[00:47] He's a great pinball collector

[00:49] Met him on pinballinfo.com which is the UK pinball forum because I've been banned from Pinside

[00:56] I have to migrate to United Kingdom pinball forums and Australian pinball forums

[01:01] A lot of people expected there to be like fireworks and sparks because Neil called my show a little bit boring on the forum

[01:09] You'll see we have a great pinball talk. He's a great guy. He's a great collector

[01:13] He's got a lot of great opinions and insights about pinball and it's the ultimate lesson about this hobby

[01:19] There's a lot of drama on the forums, but everybody deep down inside who actually cares about pinball

[01:26] We're all gonna get along. We're all gonna get along because we have to get along because the rest of the world doesn't care

[01:33] It's us against the world and even though sometimes it looks like it's us against us for the most part

[01:38] We're all part of this hobby together a couple quick news items then we're gonna air the interview

[01:43] Number one news of the day I have to give the biggest shout out to my friend Chris Wright in Seattle

[01:50] Chris got my magic girl lights working after about six months of this machine being down

[01:58] Boards going back and forth mailing stuff to Seattle him mailing stuff to me

[02:03] He reflashed my Arduino board. We finally got it working and it's all because

[02:10] Sarah and Dippit-a-Sly John Papa Duke locked every single magic girl game except for Chris's

[02:18] And Chris was able to work and copy the hard drive and reflash it and because of that he was able to give me a new version of the hard drive that he copied over

[02:30] My heart magic girl all the files were locked so it's like the pinball gods have shine down on

[02:38] Canada's apartment and that God is Chris Wright Chris

[02:41] Thank you so much the funny part go to play the game and have the coils don't work because I have a blown fuse

[02:47] But that's so much easier to fix than figuring out a light board issue that's connected to buggy software

[02:55] So Chris thank you so much news item number two is that the rumors are circulating on

[03:01] Pinside that Christopher Fransche will be talking at Expo about Batman 66 and his next game does that mean that Mr. Fransche's next game will be

[03:12] Showing it Expo and what will it be we don't know yet, but that could be really really exciting and I want to say finally

[03:20] I got a lot of people tell me you know what I agree with you on Star Wars but enough already and I agree I think Star Wars is a miss but here's the thing

[03:29] Stern has so much coming out that I know is gonna blow people away I just know it and that's why I've been telling people I would wait

[03:37] I would wait because what's around the corner what's around the corner is gonna put them back on the right path and it's gonna give us what we want

[03:48] It's gonna bring these themes to life. I'm fully confident. I can be down on Stern on one game but man they have the

[03:56] They have the potential to make that Ghostbusters game but make it even better now that they're working with LCDs

[04:03] And they know what people want they've heard the feedback they're gonna deliver I fully believe that

[04:11] All right, so let me hear the interview with Neil McCray awesome guy listen to it we cover a whole bunch of topics good guy thank you

[04:21] Neil for taking the time and for all my pinball fans in the UK thank you for listening to Canadian pinball podcast I really really appreciate it ladies and gentlemen Mr.

[04:31] Neil McCray ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome to Canadian pinball podcast a very very special guest and we've talked to people all

[04:40] Over the world about pinball but we haven't talked to anybody in the United Kingdom and

[04:46] Neil is a pinball fanatic he's got a collection he's building a room that he's gonna dedicate to pinball he's on the UK pinball form which is pinball info

[04:56] Nio is that correct yeah pinball for the calm and and he's a car enthusiast too so he's like a brother from another mother the man likes to go fast and

[05:04] Flip pinball so Nio welcome to Canadian pinball podcast and

[05:08] Thank you for inviting me and I can get out in Chris and and it's a pleasure to to be talking to you and we're happy to have you here and

[05:17] And you know I know you listen to the show and you know that on this podcast we cover a lot of what's going on in the pinball world a lot of the new stuff and

[05:25] And right now in the pinball world what's the main thing that's on your mind right now sure I mean

[05:31] There's a few thing going on I think the big thing is on my mind right now is is for me personally is attacked from mod remake so

[05:40] I've got that machine on order and it's I've been waiting for it you know the rumors of that game probably date back a year

[05:49] Where it was supposed to be you know I think launched a pinball expo last year and they didn't quite make it unfortunately

[05:57] But they've got a game bill. Yes, a remake of an older game and there's some die hearts that are probably thinking that the remakes are good. I've actually got

[06:09] I'm sitting right in front of the medieval madness remake and which I think Chicago gaming did a phenomenal version of so

[06:18] And the thing is maybe some of your normal listeners don't understand is in the UK you know we're quite small in fact we're a tiny pinball market

[06:28] There's probably only three maybe four good places to play pinball in the country most of the games are in collections not on location

[06:38] So I'm sitting in a room here. This is my I'm working to build a new room but I've got an existing one. It's got six machines in it

[06:46] And and you know short of this the newest pinball place for me to play is probably about 40 miles 50 miles away. So we talk a lot about the need to own

[07:01] So for guys like you who have to drive a long distance you kind of need to buy a game if you want to play it frequently because you don't have access

[07:11] Right you don't you don't got barcades and and and pinball over the place. I mean in the problem the whole country of the whole of the UK

[07:22] We're not like you know 60 million people there's probably too many three good barcades. There's one in London place called Bruega

[07:32] Bruega we're actually on Sunday. I'm playing a tournament there and there's another great place a phenomenal place called tilt and burning him if you're ever in London and you're pinball phonetic

[07:43] You must go to tilt we've got phenomenal beer and they run a great place up there and they've got about 20 machines

[07:53] They've got they've just recently got dialed in from Jersey Jack and they've got nearest mist there and and

[08:03] Crack your own place kind of works with one of the one of the fact the only good distributor of pinball in the UK

[08:11] Pinball heaven at Phil runs and and Phil can fill the runs pinball heaven he can use his tilt as he sure is you want to buy a machine you can play it

[08:20] And until they've got a great selection of craft beer and there's you know there's a good selection of pinball machines if you find a pinball machine anywhere else in the UK

[08:31] It's usually you know a seaside resort so we have these kind of very British and resorts you know place like black pool

[08:41] And there are by the seaside the pinball machines are typically in a pretty rough condition

[08:46] So you know back to your point if you really want to play pinball often and you live in somewhere like London

[08:53] There is a place in London called chief cafe it's a coffee shop but it's open it's kind of open coffee shop power

[09:03] So you know if you want to play late or drink beers it's it's it's that isn't a great place for it

[09:08] And there is brew dog but it's got you know five maybe six machines and so a lot of us own machines and you know

[09:18] On pinball info there's probably about a hundred of us more actually pulling more than that but we own machines

[09:24] Some of us have been in pinball for years and myself actually I only really got back into pinball actually less than a euro go

[09:32] I used to I used to where I was university back in Edinburgh in Scotland I used to play pinball in an arcade

[09:42] But this is back in the golden age of our cage where you get this huge place full of video games of pinball machines

[09:49] And it's gone now sadly but I used to duck out of university or school and go play bright a pinball for in a afternoon

[09:59] So yeah if you want to get you go on and the games are expensive and actually in the moment there are probably a bit more expensive because of the exchange rate of ten pounds and dollars

[10:09] And you know if you see Sterling just they're just an end star wars

[10:14] So you know if you want one you talk to Phil you say I'm a star wars you'll take a deposit and Phil's a great guy

[10:22] Very very I mean he's a real pinball lover himself which helps

[10:26] Play in order with with Stern and then once once a container fills up you know these big shipping containers

[10:33] Once there's enough of them to ship then they ship and that can sometimes take you know you might wait a few months for it

[10:41] Or you might get lucky there might be one that's already full in it arrives very quickly

[10:45] But typically you know we watch in the US market all these games rolling out with real jealousy thinking we won our game

[10:54] So there's a bunch of guys on pinballing for the win for dialed in and specifically

[11:01] You know let me ask your question about that because when you when a new machine is coming out

[11:06] Do you guys have to buy them before playing them?

[11:10] You because I assume you guys haven't really had a chance to jump on star wars

[11:15] So are you in LA to Neil?

[11:19] No I'm not on star wars at all and I'm not I mean I like star wars but I'm not a mad fan of it

[11:27] So you're basically right so sitting standing next to me is Batman 66

[11:33] And I pretty much bought that without playing it

[11:36] Everybody did yeah exactly so I mean it's a good game it's not great though I think you know

[11:45] The line is still working on the code I think you'll do you know I think he is heart really in this game

[11:50] And I think he's gonna he's gonna really the next drop of code which hopefully will be in the next few weeks

[11:56] I think he's really gonna bring this game alive as good as it is but it's not it's not it's not the deepest game

[12:03] But quite often you know Ghostbusters for example when that came out last year

[12:08] Many people who ordered the hand player dialed in

[12:12] As you tell her in Jersey Jack guys did a good thing actually got machine over

[12:18] And they had a kind of a launch party where they invited people who'd ordered to play the game and Jack came over

[12:25] And talked to people who wanted to play and now it was in Birmingham so you had to track the Birmingham which for me is you know it's 150 miles journey

[12:33] So I didn't I couldn't make it unfortunately but you know they tried to let people play the game

[12:39] But yeah often you know the whole bit a lot of people bought that without playing it

[12:45] Ghostbusters a lot of people bought it without playing it

[12:48] And I was smith many people bought that without playing it

[12:51] So you know what's that like with your distributors in the UK

[12:54] So if you order a game it's in the containers on its way and during that time period you see

[13:02] Reviews rolling in that aren't glowing is it non-refundable by the time it's in that container coming to you

[13:10] And that's a good question I've never been in that scenario and I've never seen anyone do that

[13:16] So what tends to happen and I wouldn't say this is the policy or anything

[13:23] But I have seen where people who ordered the game they made good

[13:28] By the time you said I contain I'd go look paid for it and full

[13:32] And sometimes I think actually this game might not be for me

[13:36] And actually what tends to happen is they'll try and sell it in the box brand new

[13:45] And often in fact I think there's an aerospace myth that this happened to recently

[13:49] You typically will find a buyer for it and I think fill you know I can't speak for them obviously

[13:57] But the sense I get is if you walk with them you would come up with a solution for it

[14:04] But yeah I mean it is you know you're showing out maybe £678,000 on something you may not have played

[14:11] And then you really go the buyer and you know I know a few people on Hobbit for example

[14:17] I mean I think that's one of the worst teams that ever existed is boring

[14:21] It looks nice but it's not a game that excites me

[14:25] I don't know a lot of people that bought that game well I made a lot of movie

[14:30] But of the people that bought that game quite a few people sold it on very quickly

[14:35] So you kind of you do take a risk but you don't have a choice

[14:41] I mean that's unless you fly to the US now I'm very lucky I just got back from Pinburg

[14:46] And a couple of weeks ago and I was able to play Star Wars there, I was able to play Star Lin there, I was able to play Aerosmith and Attack for Mars

[14:57] So you've played a lot of new games and what were your thoughts?

[15:04] So as someone who's jumped into Star Wars dialed in Attack for Mars, Aerosmith give me your feelings

[15:10] Let's do Star Wars vs. Dialding because those are two games right now that a lot of people are having to decide where to spend their money

[15:18] Yeah and I mean I think that's a... it's not... this isn't like buying a black car or a white car

[15:27] They're very different games and you know dialed in is... actually when I first played it back it

[15:35] Pinball X-Po and Chicago and I have to say when I first played it I thought no I don't like this and actually

[15:40] And cards on the table I'm not a big fan of Pat Lolo game

[15:45] The only game of his that I really like is Safe Cracker

[15:49] Most of his other games you know that people love, Adams family, I hate it, Fun House, I hate it

[15:57] So I kind of came into it with a... it's Pat Lolo I'm not going to like it

[16:02] And I played it a bit at X-Po and it wasn't finished then

[16:06] But it seemed okay I then played it again I was actually in the sometime laundromat about a month ago

[16:15] I played it there, I actually played it all night

[16:17] It just didn't really give out a good see what it was like

[16:19] And it's a deep game, it's a fun game

[16:22] I think there's a lot of great, it's a game with a bit of a story with the natural disasters

[16:28] And there's some things I've got to like

[16:31] You know I like the... some of the rules sets around picking up the same and holding on to it

[16:37] And doubling your points etc

[16:39] There's some of that I've done like there's a couple of other places where it kind of just seems to dump the ball randomly

[16:44] Right

[16:45] And I'm not too keen on that

[16:47] But in terms of quality and presentation, you know, that is 10 out of 10

[16:52] It looks beautiful, it's bright, it's very well made from what I can see

[16:58] But it's a game, I would position it as kind of a slightly slower game than say Star Wars

[17:06] And Star Wars, you know, Star Wars when it was kind of leaked it and it was on its way

[17:12] It was kind of, as you know, a bit madness around it, Star Wars is a big franchise clearly

[17:17] A lot of expectations and frankly, previous Star Wars pinball machines hadn't been great, right?

[17:24] So I placed Star Wars maybe a couple of dozen times

[17:31] I think for me, I like to see things on the play field

[17:37] And if you look at Star Wars in there's a lot on the play field

[17:40] If you look at Star Wars, it's empty

[17:44] And when I first thought of what you're paying for, but actually when you play it, what I found is

[17:51] I do like games with the ball moves and it feels like there's a flow so

[17:56] Thea magic's one of my favorite games because the ball just continually moves

[18:00] And I think Star Wars is one of those games

[18:03] Now, I think the only downside to Star Wars if there is one is

[18:07] The whole kind of select the character, go through all the rules

[18:12] And select this, select that, sometimes you just want to get an impressive button and play

[18:18] Right, yeah, I mean it's a little bit like Theater of Magic without the magic trunk

[18:23] I mean it's got the flow for sure

[18:26] I think what people were hoping for was just a little bit more interaction with the ball

[18:31] And you know, bringing some Star Wars mechanisms and toys onto that play field

[18:35] And I agree, I think everyone's sort of feeling that the complexity of the rules sets

[18:40] And all the different stacking of modes and multipliers has gone too far

[18:46] And I think Stern's heard the feedback right now because I know you were, I saw you on the Dead Flip Twitch stream

[18:53] When they showed the premium and I don't think it was by coincidence that they didn't do any mode stacking

[19:00] When they showed the game for the first time in premium form

[19:05] Yeah, and I think the, listen, you know, I always try to beat myself in the position of the guys who are shown that

[19:14] It's first of all, I think it's great that Stern, you know, show games in the very early stages

[19:19] I remember when they showed Batman, you know, it clearly was far from complete

[19:24] And you know, it's risky to do that

[19:27] So it's great that they do that and I hope they continue to do that

[19:30] But you're right, I think, you know, what I think they assured was

[19:35] I think this game's probably got a bit more to go before it's finally beat

[19:39] And you know, how has it gotten developed?

[19:43] The great thing about showing it early, and I've seen this with Dwight who's driving the code

[19:49] And I've seen him with ghost boxes, he does listen to feedback and tape it on board

[19:54] So I'm hopeful that he takes some of that feedback

[19:58] And the other thing I will say Steve Richie and Dwight, I've met both of those guys

[20:02] They are massive Star Wars fans, they are super passionate about this machine

[20:07] It's in their blood this machine, I think they want to really nail it

[20:11] And I think they're working fine to do that

[20:13] But I think part of me feels they might have overthought it

[20:18] And you know, and I'm hoping to feedback that they get on it

[20:22] I mean, obviously the most depressing thing I saw was that Death Star explode

[20:27] I kind of thought, you kidding me on

[20:31] And you know what I would love to have seen, you know, what was one of the most iconic Star Wars vehicles

[20:38] They have Walker

[20:40] You just imagine one of them on the playfield stomping up and down

[20:43] There's so many things in Star Wars that they could have done

[20:50] And well, and you know, that's the, I think that's sort of the consensus of the negative feedback

[20:58] Is with all the source material and all those iconic scenes from the movies

[21:03] We would have liked to have seen more that physically on the game

[21:07] We see a lot of it in the LCD screen

[21:10] But there's not that much physical stuff in there that comes from the films itself

[21:16] So you're not in on the Star Wars, right? So right now you just ordered an attack from Mars remake?

[21:21] Yeah, I've got a attack from Mars remake, I ordered a while ago

[21:24] It's, I think it's made, I'm just waiting for it to go on a container

[21:28] So you're waiting for enough of them to be put into a container

[21:34] Because I'm assuming they usually what do container shipments of 30 or 50, right?

[21:39] Yeah, it's something like that

[21:41] Usually around 40, 50 machines

[21:45] And it doesn't, you know, there's an hour prior to the stage ago

[21:49] I'm quite, actually, one mentioned that I'm looking at building an LR pinball room

[21:54] The reason I'm looking at that is because I'm out of space

[21:57] So even if I arrive, I can't, I don't know where I'm going to, I don't know where I'm going to put it

[22:01] And my wife's kind of warned me off about building it in the, in the house

[22:05] So, yeah, I'm waiting for that game to arrive

[22:09] You know, it's a game that I've played, I love it

[22:12] In some ways, there's a lot of similarities to Star Wars again

[22:17] It's an open play field

[22:20] But the rules and I actually quite like the humour of it

[22:23] You know, as Brits, we were string-sensed, the humour attacked from Mars

[22:28] And actually, many of the manas, which I've got the remake for that as well

[22:32] The humour in those games are fantastic

[22:35] You know, you just want to fire some of them up, have a quick game or something

[22:39] You don't need to read 14 pages of roadside, you can just get into it, you can play

[22:44] And Chicago gaming, my hat's off to them

[22:48] So I've got many evil madness, and sitting next to it I've got a walking down in a Ghostbusters

[22:53] Let me tell you, the many evil madness about it for over a year

[22:56] I've not had a single problem with it, not one

[23:00] Walking down in Ghostbusters and their premium machines

[23:03] I've had a couple of issues I've had to deal with

[23:06] So I genuinely think that the designer, a strong platform

[23:12] I love the new screen and the top are on Attack from Mars remake

[23:18] I've got the Aminth from LE, the top are nominal

[23:21] So it's an old game, but I've never played Attack from Mars

[23:27] For me, it's relatively new

[23:30] If I think about the other games on the way, the one thing is kind of a bit disappointing

[23:37] I know you've got a opinion on this alien

[23:41] I've played that back in Chicago X, but I've had real potential

[23:49] And they've moved it forward

[23:51] I don't think it's quite the game that we hoped it would be

[23:55] But I think it's still a brilliant game

[23:57] I know the company that makes it highway

[24:01] I've gone through a lot of options down

[24:03] My hope is that they come out on top

[24:06] I have some doubts that they will frankly

[24:08] But I hope that they do I wish them well

[24:10] And I hope they turn the game into some impositive

[24:13] However, you're point about the LCD screen

[24:16] This is one of the things that kind of worries me a little bit about football

[24:20] Which is LCD screens become in the de facto toy

[24:24] A screen with a couple of buttons underneath it

[24:27] And you whack the screen with a pinball

[24:29] And I think that would be very bad for pinball

[24:32] I absolutely agree

[24:34] I couldn't agree more

[24:36] And I think that when you look at even a game like alien

[24:39] You've got an LCD screen on the back box

[24:42] The same screen on the play field

[24:44] And then another screen where the Queen's Chamber was

[24:47] And it's just getting to the point where

[24:49] You really shouldn't rely on the LCD to tell the story

[24:53] Because I think the more you do that

[24:55] The more you remove the physical things that used to tell the story in pinball

[25:00] And it's not as fun

[25:02] If I want to watch a movie, I'll go watch a movie

[25:05] I don't want to be

[25:07] And a lot of these screens, too, Neil, you have to like squint your eyes

[25:10] To see what's going on

[25:12] A lot of them are not the best utilization of the screen itself

[25:17] And in Star Wars in particular

[25:19] I just really felt like the screen where the three targets are

[25:23] Below on the right side

[25:25] It just felt like an actor thought

[25:27] It didn't feel like that was the best use of that real estate

[25:31] Yeah, I agree

[25:33] And I don't know if this is my view for what it's worth

[25:39] But it feels like, you know, so LCDs, they're cheap

[25:43] And you can pick them up on, you know,

[25:46] Alibaba.com in the thousand, right?

[25:48] They're not hard to get hold of

[25:51] You know, I'm sitting looking at the

[25:54] Well-walker and walking dead right now

[25:57] And it's such a great toy

[25:59] It's been sculpted and designed and manufactured

[26:04] It looks phenomenal

[26:06] Whether you like that game or not

[26:08] It stands out as a piece in the middle of the game

[26:11] But it's clearly an expensive thing to make in design, right?

[26:15] And it takes time doing plastic manufacturing is, you know,

[26:19] It's a hard thing to do

[26:21] I'd give a bit of, I make some, where I work

[26:25] We make home gateways for DSL and broadband access

[26:30] And do the plastics

[26:32] It's a hard thing to do

[26:34] So it's kind of easy to grab an LCD screen

[26:36] Stick a few pictures on it and ram it in a machine

[26:39] But, you know, I think that's, for me, as a backwards step

[26:42] And I think it's a potentially dangerous step for a film

[26:48] Right

[26:49] And it hasn't enhanced, right?

[26:52] The gameplay, and I think if we look at a game like the walking dead

[26:56] I mean, imagine if it came out now

[26:59] And instead of the prison, there was an LCD there

[27:02] That just showed clips from the show

[27:04] It just removes, I think, what makes pinball separate

[27:09] From video games and other sort of entertainment devices

[27:14] That these themes are based on is so much of it needs to be physical

[27:17] Because the physical element is what makes pinball really special

[27:22] So you've got an attack from Mars Ellie coming

[27:25] I think that's a great choice

[27:27] What color trim did you get on your Ellie?

[27:29] You have to go for green set

[27:31] I agree, it looks great

[27:33] It looks great, I don't get what the, remember when they first showed the green

[27:36] And people were going nuts when I saw it

[27:38] I think I saw that Texas pinball festival for the first time

[27:41] I thought the game looked phenomenal on the price, you can't beat it

[27:44] Yeah, I mean, I think so

[27:47] Actually there's a friend of mine here

[27:49] That has an original attack from Mars

[27:51] And he's actually long before this game was announced

[27:55] He actually had the legs, etc. powder pudding

[27:58] Almost the same shade of green

[28:00] And when I saw, with the long staff

[28:05] I thought, I wonder if they saw this game

[28:08] Because it's almost identical

[28:10] But it just walks in so many ways

[28:13] And I think most people who complained about it

[28:17] When they actually saw it in real life

[28:22] Kind of thought, actually this doesn't very good

[28:25] So it stands out in a row of normal machines

[28:29] Which is what you want

[28:31] For me, there was no choice but to go for the green

[28:34] It looks fantastic

[28:36] Especially with the top part

[28:39] And the extra work that they've built in

[28:41] And I think the shadow game has been a bit brave to do that

[28:46] And good luck to them because I think we need brave stuff

[28:50] What do you think their next remix is going to be?

[28:54] Oh, that's a good question

[28:56] I have a kind of an off the wall view of that

[29:00] Now everyone thinks it's going to be monster bash

[29:03] After I'm monster bash here, I'm looking it right now

[29:06] Monster bash would be a great game for them to do

[29:09] Everybody loves it, it's got a great theme, it's funny

[29:12] It's simple but it's got a little bit of interest in play

[29:16] It's fast, it's got a flow

[29:18] We talked about proper toys

[29:20] Monster bash has got proper toys

[29:23] Dracula is brilliant, Frankenstein is phenomenal

[29:27] There's a lot in the rare

[29:30] There's not many of them either expensive

[29:32] So the accountant in me says monster bash

[29:37] But I look at a couple other titles

[29:42] And there's two titles for me that I think are

[29:45] And also one other thing in Monster bash

[29:47] A lot of people talk about it, the rights

[29:49] I think the rights are relevant

[29:51] I think they just need to phone someone, send them a check

[29:53] And they'll get the rights

[29:54] So I think that's the total

[29:56] But the game I think they're going to do

[29:59] This is my 101 offline

[30:03] You know, one to one side bet

[30:06] I think they're going to do the Adams family

[30:08] Really?

[30:09] Yeah, I do

[30:10] There's 22,000 Adams families out there

[30:13] But 21,000 of them are in a real shit state

[30:17] You know, listen, how many times have you walked up to an Adams family

[30:22] And some bit of it's been broken or it doesn't walk

[30:25] Or it's got some, you know, attack in the middle of it

[30:28] Where someone stuck something, they shouldn't be there

[30:31] For the first time ever actually I played an Adams family in Pimberg

[30:37] And the first time I played a machine that was as it should be

[30:41] So yeah, there's a lot of them about it

[30:43] But I still think there's a decent demand for them

[30:46] And I think there's so much in that game

[30:49] If you think what they've done with the screen on attack from Mars, the top are

[30:55] You know, there's a few things they can tweak and add to that

[30:58] And I think it's potential when I like to stay at it

[31:02] So I know it's like, bet I suspect Monster Bash will be the next one

[31:05] But there's a part of me that says that they're the Adams family

[31:10] And also, you know, that game, you know, there is a lot of them

[31:14] But people still want the game, you know

[31:16] And what they've shown with, especially with attack from Mars is

[31:22] When you add the nicer display in the back box, the top is incredible

[31:27] And like you were saying, it's brand new

[31:30] It's new technology in there and yes, I agree

[31:33] You would be hard pressed to find a really mint Adams family for anywhere north of $8,000

[31:40] They don't exist

[31:42] So you can find a lot of them for less than that that are pretty beat up

[31:47] But it would sell, I definitely think people would buy the most popular game of all time

[31:54] The other title nearly heard a lot about in terms of rumors is cactus canyon might be the next one

[32:01] We see a lot of guys with $15,000, $12,000 cactus canyon continues

[32:07] Trying to sell them right now, so you know, it's hard when you're a collector to sort of anticipate what it could be

[32:15] Yeah, I mean, there's part of me that would love it to be cactus canyon

[32:19] Because I would love to get one

[32:21] I don't have that game, I like how I played it

[32:25] There's money in a bundle that I do have access to

[32:29] There's actually a couple of them

[32:31] One is in chief cafe, but the cactus canyon continues

[32:36] It's a place near the coast

[32:39] It's a good game, there's a lot of complexity to it

[32:42] And of course, the codes and the original was kind of half done

[32:47] Could you add to that, could you build on it, could you take the continued stuff and add it to it?

[32:52] How would that work?

[32:54] I think, and as you say, they go for 10,000, 12,000 pounds

[33:00] Even more of, you know, the only thing that's kind of more expensive than this, I think, is big bang bar

[33:07] So, you know, again, from a money point of view, you know, the account, and he says, that makes sense

[33:15] However, is it a game that people know, and is it a game that, you know, people would have to...

[33:22] The advantage of many evil madness and the fact from ours, everybody knows that game, everybody

[33:28] But cactus canyon, does everybody know that game? I think they've heard of it, I think few people have played it

[33:35] I think it's a harder sell, and requires potentially more work

[33:43] I definitely think they'll get to it, this is the next game

[33:46] I think they need one more big game before they go down that path, that's my view

[33:52] Right

[33:54] Well, they've got a lot to choose from, and it's going to be interesting to see where they go next with it

[34:00] So, I mean, I like remakes, but I'm also, you know, I'm always on the fence a little bit about the...

[34:08] Like, stern vault additions, because it does disrupt collectors, right, in your collector, in the other games in your collection

[34:15] You know, part of me just is like, all right, stern just let us know what you're going to remake

[34:21] So we know we're getting new ACDC, I keep hearing that the premium vault addition is not going to be any different

[34:29] Like, there's not going to be new art, they're literally just going to remake it, sort of the way they remade Iron Man

[34:36] What do you think is next in the stern vault? They keep teasing, tron, Lord of the Rings

[34:42] What do you think it makes sense for them to remake again?

[34:46] Yeah, I mean, that's a really tough question

[34:48] First of all, I think with Spiderman, they did a reasonable job

[34:54] To be honest, what they should have done with Spiderman is done the comment version to start with

[35:00] There's a Spiderman, you know, Marvel, not

[35:04] That's what we all wanted to see, we didn't want to see coming in while, let's be honest about it, right?

[35:10] I think tron is the obvious candidate, particularly where the Lumi edition is in huge demand, it goes for big money, it's a beautiful machine

[35:23] Actually, I'm not a big fan of tron as a game, I find it quite difficult

[35:28] But it's a great, you know, it would be, if they could arrange the license

[35:38] Which, you know, Disney or a business, I'm sure they'll take money for it

[35:42] And then, to some extent, it's a no-brainer

[35:45] But I think there's a couple other games that, you know, you might want to pencil in

[35:50] X-Men

[35:52] X-Men gets a bad press

[35:55] And I think if you spend a bit of time with it, it's potentially a better game

[35:59] Now, is that a game, Starrer, I'm going to risk as a vault because they want volume, perhaps not

[36:05] But I think it's hard to see where Starrer has gone on this

[36:13] And they've got kind of a solution

[36:16] I'll be honest with you, I think the Starrer remakes are in a different world from the kind of medieval madness attack from Mark

[36:25] Many of the manuses are a 20-year-old game

[36:28] Spider-Man was barely, you know, was even more 10 years when it came out

[36:33] And there's still a lot of them around

[36:36] I recently picked up Spider-Man in the office

[36:41] And, you know, they're a good shade because there's a lot of them to be had and they're reasonably well-priced

[36:46] And then, ACD, I think, I think with my understanding on that

[36:54] I don't know the story well, but my understanding was that they kind of stopped making that ahead of when they probably wanted to

[37:01] And for the ACD, ACD is a bit of a dysfunctional organisation, by all accounts

[37:05] They try to renew the license, it was a problem for them

[37:09] So, I think if you've gone and bought one of the limited-different ACD's from the first run, which I haven't

[37:18] But if you had done, I can see why you might be upset about the vault addition because it doesn't feel like it's that wall-different basically

[37:28] Well, and I think what's interesting when Stern approaches Remake's is they're all over the map for me and how they do a remake

[37:36] So, with Iron Man, they just remade the same exact game

[37:40] With Spider-Man, they re-scoped it, all the toys and changed the art

[37:47] And I think improved upon the game and made it look even better

[37:51] ACD were back to sort of just like another remake, I know they took the big Angus face off because people complained about that

[38:00] So, it's always been a little bit of this, a little bit of that

[38:03] And then you could even argue that Batman 66 is technically a remake, re-themed

[38:10] You know, it's like they've never, Stern's never done that before, they've never taken a game and kind of changed 30% of it

[38:18] And within the same genre of theme, so it's, you never know, like for Tron, I would love it if they would remake Tron but make it based on the original Tron film

[38:31] And redo the art, I think it would be gangbusters because the Deaf punk Tron movie was not nearly as popular as the original Disney film

[38:41] I don't know though, I kind of don't, I think they put it out there just to mess with our heads and to mess with the secondary market

[38:50] Yeah, I mean, I think what Stern wanted is for you to buy new machines, you know, and they have a, there's a used market, it's different from cars

[39:02] You know, it's hard to meet money from the used market where you've got cars, you can take it in the dealership and you want parts and upgrades etc

[39:09] And it's harder for that involved, so Stern definitely wanted you to build, you know, to buy new games

[39:17] I think, you know, whether they change the game a lot or not, I think really depends upon the game and how they think it will go

[39:26] I think they knew that they had people who, you know, actually I was trying to buy an EC Easy for some time just after they stopped making them

[39:33] And they were hard to get a hold of, the man's high, so you know, you can just push that one out, change a few things, fix a few issues, we had with it and it will sell

[39:41] Spider-Man, you know, no one really let, I think after Spider-Man 3 and the whole Tully require thing went away

[39:48] And you know, the notion of going back to the comic particularly in Marvel World where there's big collectors in that space as well

[39:56] And you know, it makes a lot of sense, but in Batman 66, and I think Batman 66 didn't really think too hard about it

[40:04] I think it was all very opportunistic, and again this is my near-eating between the Lions, Chris, where you know, Joe I think has the rights to Batman 66 in casino games

[40:17] You know, was able to then extend that into Pinbong and Capoe as part of the solution

[40:24] And you know, I remember when they first started leaking pictures of the new game, leaking pictures of the Rams and stuff

[40:34] It was clearly they had an accelerated development time for that game, but I think, I mean, I personally love it

[40:42] I'm also a big Adam West Batman fan, and Memo Wife, we got to meet him at Chicago, the Chicago Bimbo Expo, a lovely guy, very sad that he died over in the shoot of course

[40:55] But I think, you know, and also they tweaked the order of games for the new LCD, which was, you know, some ways of brave moves

[41:06] But we still wait for the, you know, like I said at the start, this is a good game, it's not a great game yet

[41:14] But, you know, we wait for Lyman to land the code, we've seen what he's done on Walk and Dead, we've seen what he's done on Ails, Meta, Metallica

[41:24] We've seen what he's done on many games and we all believe he's going to land it

[41:29] And the potential is there in the villain vision, it doesn't do anything right now, but it will do

[41:37] The potential is there and I really hope he lands it, and I'm looking forward to that

[41:43] But I think both games, I think both games are in a different, they're kind of a different world to what Chicago Gaming are doing in my life

[41:53] And you know, to me it feels like you might have had you start with just trying to keep the production line going in a good way of doing that

[42:06] You know, they run a massive production line and I mean, it's a fantastic thing to watch

[42:13] And developing pinball games is a lengthy tough process, so you know, if you can do that, if you've got a way of keeping that production line going

[42:23] And you know, I think that's a good way of okay, give us a quick vault addition, let's round this out

[42:29] Well with the amount of new games though, Stern has coming out each year and the amount of themes they have secured

[42:37] In my mind, the best way to keep the line going if I'm Stern is just to make really freaking awesome games every time versus you know, it always feels like a little bit like hit and miss with that

[42:48] Like some titles pop, some don't, and I know every game can't be great

[42:52] But when games are costing what they're costing now, yes, every game in my mind needs to be great

[43:00] And Neil, it's using analogy, people hate car analogies, but you drive an M series BMW if Ferrari doesn't really make bad cars

[43:10] So if you're going to charge a lot of money, Stern, because at $9,000, Stern is in the big leagues with the pricing on these LEDs

[43:18] And those games all need to be great and whether or not like the play fields are different, then the art should be epic

[43:25] There should be other elements of the limited edition games that make them worth the money and I think they've sort of got caught with Star Wars with their pants down a little bit

[43:34] Where they just thought the theme alone would carry them

[43:37] And I think the feedback is not this time, you know, we can't see the value there in the Ellie and I think I've heard from many, many buyers out there on Ellie's that they're dropping out

[43:49] That they're going premium or they're just going to wait for the next title

[43:53] Yeah, I mean, it's a hard situation, I think

[44:03] Here's what I think needs to happen, what I don't want to see is the same games coming out, the same format game every three months

[44:14] I give you an example of that, video games, first-person shooters, every game is a first-person shooter

[44:22] And you got a weapon, you killed someone and people loved it

[44:26] But then it's obviously the first-person shooter, kill PC gaming, because there's a lot of variety in it

[44:32] So I want variety in games, I think I want to see the value of a game

[44:39] You know, something that like Ghostbusters where the play feels absolutely jam-full of stuff

[44:45] You know, the premium of the Ellie's got Hector goggles, it's got an extra RAM, it's got Slymer that does a whole lot of stuff, it's got the great buildings on it

[44:54] It's got phenomenal lighting on it, and I absolutely, you know, that

[44:59] Ghostbusters, no problem buying a game like that, it's obviously see what you get for your money

[45:05] I think on Star Wars it's a little bit more tricky to see what you're getting for your money

[45:09] Other than a lot of video that you've probably got 14 DVD versions of in your shelf anyway

[45:16] So I do think, you know, if you look at it from that angle, I have a lot of sympathy for your point

[45:25] If you look at it on the flip side, and you look at other Star Wars games, where some of them have had a lot of toys on the table

[45:34] And it's hard to tell the Star Wars story of a pinball game

[45:40] And actually, I'm going to go out and look at the game here, and my good friend Tim will probably chuckle at this

[45:49] You know, I actually think one of the best Star Wars games is the pinball 2001, episode 1

[45:55] Because I think it tells the Star Wars story in a much better way than any other game, partly because of the video

[46:01] But I think that format really works for it

[46:04] So, you know, you're trying to encapsulate the game, you know, one of the things I think is missing from Star Wars

[46:10] And people will probably have a mad guy for this part

[46:13] I genuinely think that they should have put some stuff from episode 1 to 3

[46:20] Yeah, those aren't the best Star Wars movies by far, but there's some great things in it, there's some great music, there's some great actors and storyline in it

[46:28] And I kind of think you've got to weave some of them in, it's like Ghostbusters

[46:33] All about Ghostbusters 1, but there's the odd limo of Ghostbusters 2 in it, right?

[46:39] I think it is hard to see the value, the LEDs though, here's my prediction, our predictable seldom out

[46:46] You know, there'll be people who don't want them, but I think there's enough people back in pinball where what's on the table, they'll want it by

[46:53] And they'll be happy with it

[46:54] And it's a good game, I think it's, you know, more and more, you have to watch how these games develop

[47:02] Let's take walking death for example, when that first came out, oh my god, it was dreadful

[47:06] Like, what have they done? Now, you know, this is, whatever happens in my life, the only game that's stayed

[47:13] You know, I've had to sell every game for whatever reason, but one that stays is walking death, I'm not playing it

[47:19] So, it's early days, I like to look at it this in the most positive way I can, Chris, which is, let's give you know, let's have some feedback

[47:29] And I don't know if people who have worked with them, content provider, so in my job, we're on a TV channels

[47:41] When you work with assets like Star Wars, the amount of control and checking back with the owner of the rights is pretty significant

[47:55] You know, they want to make sure that what you're doing is not taking value away from their brand, right?

[48:02] And it's tough, keep going, keep going

[48:05] Yeah, we know Disney was definitely prohibitive of probably a lot of creative freedom that Stern probably wanted

[48:14] But I think if I could go back an hour then, knowing how big the license is, I probably would have made a game per movie

[48:20] I would have made a new hope version, and two years later I would have released an Empire Strikes Back, and two years later I would have released Return of the Jedi

[48:28] People would have bought all three, and it would have been easier for them to probably put, you know, be more focused

[48:34] Because I do agree that there's so much in Star Wars universe that it's hard to capture it all on a single game, on a single play field

[48:44] I think they did a great job in capturing hardly any of it in terms of physical elements from the movies

[48:51] But so, Neil, if I'm Gary Stern and I go to you, I say, Neil, what's your dream theme if I were going to make you something that's not already available?

[49:00] That's a dream, for me, a dream theme, I mean, there's a couple of themes out there that are my kind of dream theme, Ghostbusters for me, it was a big one

[49:09] Here's my two dream themes, I think I'm going to leave you with two, right?

[49:13] The Beastie Boys is a music convo, I think that would sell like you wouldn't believe

[49:21] I don't know if you're a fan of them, but if you look at their videos, you know, they were really, they were one of the real first people to get video on MTV

[49:31] And a lot of people talk about Michael Jackson, if you park him and you look at what they've got in their videos and some of the music they've got

[49:39] And there's tunes everybody knows, but they've got a lot of great stuff in their back catalog that would suit a pinball machine for long away

[49:47] The second one, the second one, and it's kind of linked to Ghostbusters, but I think one of the most best convo games that could ever be would be a convo game based on the Blues Brothers

[49:59] I think there's a huge amount in that movie, the music's great, the movies great, the characters are great

[50:07] There's many dimensions too, there's a musical dimension, there's the story of the Blues Brothers

[50:15] You know, you've got the Giro Boys and the cops chasing them, I think there's a phenomenal pinball machine with the Blues Brothers license on it

[50:25] Definitely has the action, has the music, has like the narrative that would be perfect because a lot of what makes a good machine too is

[50:35] The stories from these films can they translate well to a pinball game? I actually think BC Boys 2, I mean that's a huge band

[50:42] They're one of the few sort of mega bands that hasn't ever had a pinball game dedicated to them

[50:50] We talk a lot about too, like how well would a theme sell?

[50:54] So I would say that we're running thin on major bands to make pinball machines based on

[51:02] I think a Michael Jackson pinball machine would be awesome too, pre-petophile days, if there were any

[51:11] Allegiance, Allegiance

[51:13] Yeah, yeah, he was never found fully guilty, but it's going to be interesting because one of the themes that we always hear over and over again from Stern is Jaws Pinball

[51:23] Do you think they're ever going to make Jaws?

[51:25] I think Jaws is a bit of a, I think Jaws is an in-jokeist term, that's my view of that

[51:32] So I'll give you a, I'll give you a, something that was kind of one of the buzzies of pinball

[51:40] And Keith Ellin was wearing a Jaws cap for the whole of pinball

[51:44] Right, so they're taking a piss out of it

[51:46] Yeah, I just want my belief is I think it's a bit of a funny thing

[51:53] And I think what it was down to is that they kind of shark, and I don't know if you've ever read what Steven Spielberg wrote about the maker of Jaws

[52:02] But that toy, the shark, was a real problem toy

[52:07] And that's where I think this story comes, I think there is, there's this is just my kind of creative mind

[52:14] But Stern were trying to build something in a toy, it was a disaster, and they called it Jaws

[52:19] And it's kind of, somewhere from there, would Jaws make a great pinball game?

[52:24] I think it has potential, but it's not the deepest of stories, let's be frank

[52:30] And there's not a huge amount of, you know, you got the sea, you got the fish, you got a boat, you know, it would be it

[52:39] And there's no, you know, the music, there's, there's element of that, you know, that scary music

[52:44] But can you take that and jump in ball game? I think that's a tough one

[52:47] I mean, I think Jaws would kind of translate, translate incredibly though, you're right, it's not the deepest story, but I love about it

[52:56] Is imagine just like the denna, denna, you know, the lights go, and then all of us, the shark, the shark needs to pop up from under the plate, feel it in some way

[53:06] And you have to bash it in a certain amount of time, and the ultimate NC, though, needs to have the scuba divers tank in the mouth

[53:14] And you get one shot

[53:16] Just the time, shoot the time, yeah, I mean listen, I think there's, you know, I think you could do it

[53:22] I'm not, and I think, listen, I think you would sell like hotcakes, we all love Jaws, you know, and I'll put this way, I'll probably buy it

[53:31] And Jaws is just one of those movies, but you know, I kind of feel that this is a bit of a stern internal gag

[53:42] That they kind of lay around for us, I mean, I'm not using it, sorry

[53:47] I mean, this is the challenge, this is, this is where I challenge Stern a little bit

[53:52] And they probably won't thank you for this, but I'm going to do it anyway

[53:55] But, you know, Stern are clearly like a bunch of guys that like rock music, right? They like AC, DC, they like Aerosmith, they like Metallica

[54:06] You know, there's rumors of a Slayer pinball, there's rumors of Death Leper, another rock bands

[54:12] I think you're point about Michael Jackson's a great one

[54:15] And I don't know if you've seen him Boston, there's a, in 4K in Boston, this guy's put together this Michael walking dead Jackson

[54:23] I don't know if you've seen it, but he's re-themed the game and changing the music, it's brilliant

[54:28] Yeah, I've seen it's awesome

[54:30] I think there are some big bands, there aren't heavy metal bands

[54:35] And genres of music, there aren't heavy metal or hard rock

[54:39] The high-think pinball would be great for, but I don't think, you know, the designers or the management or the whole kind of Stern family

[54:50] And I kind of, listen, if you're not passionate about it, it's hard to do something with it, right?

[54:54] So you know, you need Pat, you need, I would say that, you know, if you look at the legends of pinball, they're all Stern

[55:04] You've got Steve Richie, Dwight, you've got Lyman, you've got John Bord

[55:09] I mean, these guys are all, George Gowen, these guys are all legends, but they're all of an age, right?

[55:15] They're old like me, they're late 4, he's gone into their 50s

[55:19] What Stern needs is a few 20s, somethings, they are a bit closer to modern-day music

[55:27] They can provide that passion both in design and software for, you know, a music game that's probably not a rock band

[55:36] And I give you a, you know, there are some, and I like a bit of hip hop, there are some great hip hop bands

[55:44] that I think we're trying to, like, very well at the pinball, but you need someone with that passion

[55:50] Yeah, I couldn't agree more, I've said before in this podcast that in an M&M pinball machine or two-pock,

[55:57] would crush it, especially like on location, and even just hip hop music in general, would be so great for pinball

[56:05] And just the mood of the game and the subwoofer hooked up to it, it would be, you could go through an artist like M&M's collection

[56:13] 8 mile, like Detroit on the play field, that you have all the grittiness, it could be really cool

[56:19] But yeah, I don't think we'll ever see it because they also know they're target demo

[56:24] And they will always skew towards the older white male demographics on everything

[56:29] Which is fair, but I think, you know, wall

[56:32] But the thing that, what I see is, in the moment, you know, people like me, 20 years ago, love pinball

[56:44] We can now afford to buy them, is a market that has a limited time

[56:50] And I believe that pinball business would do well to place some seats

[56:58] For the future, for the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years

[57:03] And that means, you know, that doesn't mean, you know, making a pinball machine that's probably not, you know, more geared towards the operator market

[57:13] Where there's life in that market again

[57:16] And that perhaps, you know, not the, the, the four-year-old people, four-year-olds that would normally buy them, aren't buying them

[57:26] Because I think, you know, they, it feels to me that the one of the biggest challenges of pinball is the size of the market

[57:35] A respective of how good the games are, the market needs to grow

[57:40] And it needs, it needs to be good, they need to be varied, and they need to appeal to people

[57:46] And, and appeal to, and this is the thing that I think I'm an awe of, in particular, serenity in this space

[57:54] We can put a game together that has, has a rule set that works for people who don't pinball

[58:01] And a rule set that works for people who love deep rules and, you know, pinball, pinball, and he's like me

[58:07] So I think that's, that's, that's really one of the big challenges for them

[58:14] And it's not easy, you know, we've seen, you've seen how many people have tried to build pinball machines in the last couple of years

[58:20] And, you know, most of them haven't made it

[58:22] Let's, let's talk a little bit about the other manufacturers, and we have about, I usually do these, like, in hours

[58:28] So it's been like another, like, almost like 10 minutes talking about everyone else

[58:31] But, but, but, I think you raised a good point right there because the more expensive these games get, and they're getting expensive, the smaller the market becomes

[58:40] And it will continue to shrink as games creep closer to $10,000

[58:45] There is just no way to justify having six games for 50 grand in your house

[58:52] It's just getting harder and harder for, I say, I say this as I've broken $20,000 magic rod in my peripheral vision

[58:59] But, what do you think about Dutch pinball and the other? Are they going to make it?

[59:03] You know, if you'd asked me that a month ago, I would say that we're dead

[59:09] But, you know, those guys, I met Jack in Chicago last year

[59:15] And he is a very passionate guy

[59:19] I think they might just make it, but it's going to be a tough rule

[59:27] And I think what they need to do is, you know, there's a couple of, in the, in the

[59:36] They've clearly come up against a very difficult situation

[59:40] They're not being a cash rich company, men that they couldn't tackle a problem in the way that they might choose to, you know, either in the course or, or I really might have choose to do

[59:51] And my, my gut feeling, you know, they've got another manufacturer on board, they've started placing orders

[59:59] And it looks like they might just make it, and actually, because I hope they do, because I don't know if you've played the big Lebowski, but it's a fantastic machine

[01:00:09] I played it, it's some showing London, I'm not playing it a lot of it, but I was quite impressed by it

[01:00:17] And so I hope they are successful, but what they need to be is very transparent

[01:00:22] You know, they were transparent for a period of time, that, you know, that really hurt them

[01:00:28] You see what's happening in my highway, because of the lack of transparency there

[01:00:32] You know, they're really on a, on a knife's edge

[01:00:36] I do hope they survive, and I think Jack, you know, and the guys that are there, they are passionate pinball people

[01:00:44] But they've got, they've got a tough, you know, I would like to be in their place, because they've got a tough six months ahead of them

[01:00:50] Yeah, I mean, like, I played the game, and I still think Lebowski is one of the most amazing games

[01:00:55] It's magical, it's got a pin, it's got a freaking bowling alley, as a lower pay field

[01:01:00] The problem they're going to face, and it's just where is the money going to come from

[01:01:04] You know, I think they, they, we saw the same thing with highway, where when you burn through all the pre-order money

[01:01:11] You then have no money to make the games that people already paid for

[01:01:15] And the only way you can survive then is if you get outside investors to come bail you out

[01:01:21] Because highway's got the bailout, but Dutch doesn't have the bailout yet

[01:01:25] So even if the contract manufacturer can make the game, I'm just not sure where the money comes from

[01:01:30] The order of the parts to make the games that we're already paid for

[01:01:33] Now, what, I do hope they make it though, because I would love to have a big Lebowski in my collection one day

[01:01:38] But I won't go in until I know that the company is on, on short ground

[01:01:43] I agree, I think, I think anyone who's got money in those two companies is brave

[01:01:51] But one thing I do, what comes out of this though Chris, is this notion of paying for games in full

[01:01:58] Use and advances, get in them, come on, let's, let's kill that, let's not be silly with that anymore

[01:02:04] Pinball players, please don't do that anymore

[01:02:07] Do not allow a company to use your money to finance their business

[01:02:12] I think that's a dead process, I hope it's a dead process

[01:02:16] I certainly wouldn't do that, and I'm able to afford it more than some people can to lose that sort of money

[01:02:23] But none of us want to do that, right? So I'm hoping, I don't mind putting down 10%

[01:02:27] That's fine, but more than that, I think you buy a car from you eventually BMW

[01:02:33] You don't go pay cash in a week, three months to turn up

[01:02:38] You order it, you could have deposit that eventually turns up

[01:02:42] So I'm hopeful that that model is dead and the people have learned the hard way of that unfortunately

[01:02:49] And those people that have lost money, my heart goes out to them because people, they're passionate pinball people

[01:02:56] And I hope that it comes with them

[01:02:58] I think, in-hem, but you know, I'm reflecting on a couple of things on my Twitch stream

[01:03:05] The more manufacturers that are in pinball, I think the better it is for all of us

[01:03:09] So I want, I completely agree with your skepticism on where is the money coming from

[01:03:15] I think that's a really difficult thing for a Dutch pinball to get on top of

[01:03:20] I think any notion of them selling a new product to help fund the current one

[01:03:26] I hope everybody looks at that and says no, I don't want to do that

[01:03:30] And actually Dutch pinball or root-relph might try that

[01:03:34] We're not going to let you get away with that because that's just not good business sense

[01:03:40] And frankly, it's not fair on the people who are spending hard earned money on a pinball machine

[01:03:47] But at the same time, you know, I look at highway

[01:03:53] And I really want, I really, you know, aliens on my list to go get

[01:03:58] But the only way I would buy an alien now is if it, you know, the highway are about 200 miles away from me

[01:04:04] I drive there, I've given them the cash and collect the machine at the same time

[01:04:09] If the only way I would buy one, and it feels like they're moving to a more distributed model

[01:04:15] Which I think probably not the right thing in my view

[01:04:19] But they've got some tough choices to make to survive and move on to the next thing

[01:04:25] I think the other thing that worries me about it a couple of these guys is

[01:04:29] You know, you look at, so Dutch pinball have got another manufacturer for Bigelow's game

[01:04:36] But it also looks like they're going to build a machine with a different design

[01:04:41] So the same machine, but with different boards and different parts underneath

[01:04:46] So if you've got one of these machines, what does that mean for you?

[01:04:49] I think, you know, they need to be really, you know, if they don't look after those customers

[01:04:54] They've got the machines and have spent a lot of money and the ones that are waiting for the machines

[01:04:58] If they don't look after them, the world is watching them

[01:05:01] If they don't look after them, then I kind of feel that their business is going to be finished pretty soon

[01:05:06] Right, and I know I've been down on Stern over the past few weeks because of Star Wars, but I'll say this

[01:05:16] I know or have a good inclination of what's coming next from Stern

[01:05:21] I know that people involved and Stern's not going to slow down

[01:05:24] So for these other manufacturers that are, you know, they're fumbling to figure out

[01:05:28] Manufacturing and profitability

[01:05:31] You're getting bored and Christopher French, he's coming with something

[01:05:34] John Trudeau and Zambietti are coming with something

[01:05:37] You know, Stern is going to be hitting with some real knockout blows in their next few games

[01:05:44] And as much as I've been poo-pooing Star Wars because I'm a die-hard Star Wars fan and I'm disappointed

[01:05:49] I don't think Stern is going away. In fact, I think Stern's going to come back

[01:05:54] And I think all the other manufacturers out there are going to be in big trouble if they don't have their act together over the next six months

[01:06:02] Because it's swim or sink time in pinball because to your point of view, there's a lot of manufacturers

[01:06:09] And I do love the competition, but I also think that manufacturers are getting...

[01:06:16] And you guys are getting it wrong because to be boutique, you need to go high end

[01:06:22] You can't win and you can't go against Stern at the pro level

[01:06:27] And that's where I think Spooky is going to struggle

[01:06:30] And what are your thoughts on Spooky because I think they're trying to win at the Stern pro price?

[01:06:34] I just don't think they can win in that marketplace

[01:06:37] And I think Spooky need to be innovative

[01:06:41] I mean, there's only, I think, one Spooky game in the whole of the UK

[01:06:46] So what we like to see them do is sell on machines

[01:06:50] There's a lot of interest in TNA, I'm very interested in it

[01:06:53] It looks like a stunning machine and a stunning game

[01:06:57] My hats off this Spooky because they're being conservative but trying to do things differently, trying to be innovative and stuff

[01:07:05] I think you know, Rob Zombe is it, I think we played that, I was in the US, me and my wife played it, and we loved it

[01:07:11] And it's a simple game, but it's quite addictive, it's a little bit funny

[01:07:15] I don't know the theme that well, but I thought it didn't have that one more goal, sort of, feel about it

[01:07:22] But listen, let's be really clear

[01:07:25] I don't think Spooky Pinball wakes up and thinks I've got to beat Stern

[01:07:29] I don't know the way they go about the business

[01:07:31] I think they say, how do we make a Pinball game that is as much appeal as possible

[01:07:35] Part of that's got to be about, probably, back to your point about 10,000 bucks

[01:07:39] Pinball machines

[01:07:41] And I think they're doing a reasonably good job with that

[01:07:44] I think TNA is a critical point for them

[01:07:47] Because I think that game's going to sell like hotcakes

[01:07:50] In fact, we're trying to figure out here in the UK how we might import a few

[01:07:53] Because they don't serve the UK market

[01:07:56] I think it looks like a great game, I think they're onto a winner of it

[01:08:00] But let me talk about Stern from it, you said that they're kind of back

[01:08:04] I'll be honest, I think Stern have been doing, you know, but they've had some issues, let's be clear

[01:08:10] And I've actually, I've been challenged by a couple of those issues, I've compared to that

[01:08:14] But I'm sitting in front of the year, I'm sitting with, I've got three Stern machines here

[01:08:19] Ghostbusters walking dead in Batman 66

[01:08:21] So a game from pretty much each of the years for the past few years

[01:08:25] They're all premium or LEDs

[01:08:27] The games are phenomenal games

[01:08:29] They're most, they're with one exception, they're well-made

[01:08:33] And they are, they work

[01:08:37] They are work on walking dead

[01:08:40] It's, the playthrough can be made a little bit better, but the back glass and the side is beautiful

[01:08:45] The Ghostbusters artwork is out of this world, as far as I'm concerned

[01:08:49] It is fantastic

[01:08:50] It is spot on the theme of Ghostbusters in my view

[01:08:53] And then Batman, Chris Franchey, you know, he has done, you know, I like to say I love the theme

[01:09:00] He's done a tremendous job on that

[01:09:02] There's things about that could be better, don't, don't, you know, but I think Stern have never been in such a strong place

[01:09:11] They've got a fantastic factory, they know how to build volume

[01:09:16] They know how to design machines and get them moving, Aerosmith, you know, I'm not fat

[01:09:22] I like one son of Aerosmith because I'm a space nut and it's the, the, I'm a getting son

[01:09:28] But, you know, they're not, the games are beautiful games, the artworks are phenomenal

[01:09:34] And you look at all that, you know, most of the other games, the artworks, be good and italic

[01:09:40] They're all very fantastic on it

[01:09:42] And, you know, I think Stern are, you know, I think it's Williams who are around today

[01:09:47] And Stern was, was where they are today

[01:09:50] I think you see a real punch up between those two guys because I think they're, you know, we have a lot of,

[01:09:56] we look back with the nostalgic love of Williams and Ballet

[01:10:00] And, but I think Stern aren't far away from that

[01:10:03] But here's Stern's biggest issue

[01:10:05] Stern's biggest issue is themselves

[01:10:08] They don't have to worry about survival gaming, they don't have to worry about Jersey giant, they don't have to worry about

[01:10:15] Spooky, they don't have to worry about Dutch Pimbal

[01:10:20] They are beating those guys' hands down, they make more machines in one week than most of the other guys in an idea

[01:10:27] Right? Stern's only danger is themselves

[01:10:32] And what I mean by that, they need to make sure that the quality issues that we've seen on some of their games are a thing of the past

[01:10:40] And we know they can do it, you know, we've seen them put out beautiful machines, we know that they can do it

[01:10:46] So, this cabinet issue they had was a bit ridiculous

[01:10:50] The ghosting issue on Ghostbusters and other games, frankly that was very bad in my view

[01:10:59] And actually, I'm in the middle of dealing with that, my premium has got a ghosting on it and I'm trying to give that sorry, Iw

[01:11:06] Things go wrong, right? Pimbals are complicated products, things go wrong, okay, communicate, put it right

[01:11:14] So Stern's own, you know, I'm just a buyer, I'm a nobody in this industry, I'm not in the industry, I'm just a customer spending my money

[01:11:21] I believe that Stern's only thing that can stop Stern being a massive success is Stern themselves

[01:11:30] And they've got the best talent in Pimbal with Lyman, Steve Richey, Dwight, George

[01:11:40] There's an endless, they just got Keith Ellin on board, you know, another phenomenal name in Pimbal

[01:11:47] The artist work of Franchie and Zombie Eddie, I mean they've got, they've got, you know, often, companies are bad people

[01:11:56] They've got all the right people, they've got money, yeah, they're selling a tough business, they're starting to get value

[01:12:02] All they need to do is not drop the ball

[01:12:05] That's all they need to do

[01:12:07] I agree, Stern has got the ultimate ball star roster

[01:12:11] And then they're going to make some amazing games coming up

[01:12:15] I do think Star Wars was a little bit of a step back simply because I think everyone expects a lot more since Ghostbusters

[01:12:22] I've been saying it, I think that game showed us what Stern could do

[01:12:26] And we want to see that as the new base level for what they can do

[01:12:30] And I think Star Wars is a step back, but I wouldn't be worried because I think Stern's going to come out with some amazing stuff

[01:12:36] And we do see what Christopher Franchie can do when he can design a game from the ground up

[01:12:41] And not have to come in with just a few weeks

[01:12:44] You know, his necker ain't going to blow us away

[01:12:47] And then I've got a couple of Chris Franchie's all-around work, he is a genius in horror

[01:12:55] And I think him and his on the great assets to Stern

[01:13:00] I can help, but I can't help but really look with all of my biggest traumas

[01:13:12] I don't want to put any of these machines when they come out

[01:13:15] It's a great problem to have so many great machines coming out

[01:13:19] And Sparer thought for the guys who can't afford an 8,000 pound pinball machine

[01:13:26] Sparer thought for the guys that have lost money on some of the machines

[01:13:31] Let's make this industry a fun industry and industry that people feel they believe in

[01:13:38] I think Stern's the North Star for pinball for the next for the foreseeable future

[01:13:45] I hope they do well, but let's come close to the end on this

[01:13:51] I will look at Chicago gaming and you look at what they've done enough fairly small amount of time

[01:14:01] And they are showing signs of their arcade manufacturers

[01:14:08] They've been in pinball and it is a supplier for some time

[01:14:11] They know how to manage supply chain, they know how to build assembly lines

[01:14:16] They've been doing arcade machines for years

[01:14:19] What they've built with attack from Mars shows that if you've got the right leadership, the right investment

[01:14:25] You can build a pinball company and they've got a list of titles that are five star titles

[01:14:32] That they can pick and choose for launch

[01:14:34] And with effectively, relatively low, they've done all the work

[01:14:38] They've built the system, they've built the boards, they just need to put them in machines now

[01:14:43] Where all the designs are already done

[01:14:45] So Stern doesn't need to keep an eye on them and not get too complacent

[01:14:48] But I want Stern to be successful, I love them, I love going to their factory

[01:14:52] I love when they do webcasts, I do get frustrated when they don't communicate

[01:14:56] Like when is the bad man who's coming, I'd really like to know

[01:14:59] But you know, they've got a tough job and I want them to be successful

[01:15:03] Right

[01:15:04] Well Neil, I really appreciate you taking the time, I'm a little bit over now

[01:15:07] Now I want to ask you the final question, the elephant in the room

[01:15:10] Because I know we got connected on pinball info

[01:15:13] Did you find this podcast boring?

[01:15:17] I'll be honest with you, I'm not a big podcast fan

[01:15:22] I kind of listen to them when there's something of interest

[01:15:29] So here's what I'm going to say, I think until I was on your show

[01:15:33] It was boring, but neither I'm on your show

[01:15:36] It's the best pinball podcast in the world

[01:15:38] There you go, well that's a fair comment

[01:15:42] Well Neil, I appreciate you coming out

[01:15:44] And look, we all love this hobby, I mean I keep telling people

[01:15:48] There's no real conflict in pinball, there's no real issue for concern

[01:15:53] You know, this is in North Korea and China against the US

[01:15:56] This is Stern and Jersey back and Spooky Pinball

[01:15:59] We love this hobby because it's an escape from everything else going on in our lives

[01:16:05] That is oftentimes really more dramatic and important

[01:16:09] And it's a fun hobby

[01:16:11] I hope that these manufacturers give us the best they can

[01:16:15] Especially at these prices

[01:16:17] And you know, I know you're going to love Attack from Mars Remake

[01:16:19] Because it's a great game and it's just made even better

[01:16:22] And we look forward to seeing what Stern comes out with next

[01:16:25] And I really do appreciate you coming on the show

[01:16:28] I say this all the time, I invite people on

[01:16:30] And you're one of the few that actually stood up to the plate and said

[01:16:33] I'll come on and I'll talk to you

[01:16:35] So I thank you for taking the time

[01:16:37] Well, thanks for inviting me

[01:16:39] And listen, as you say, you know, Mr. Tolpinets

[01:16:44] We're all in the same mission, unwapping the ball and scoring points

[01:16:48] And I say, I will say one more thing

[01:16:52] I went to Pinburg, I don't know if you've been to it first, but

[01:16:56] It was a phenomenal event, you know why?

[01:16:59] Because everybody was friendly with everybody

[01:17:02] Everyone just wanted to have a great game of pinball

[01:17:04] And enjoy a couple of days away from the usual life of Pinburg

[01:17:10] It was an outstanding event

[01:17:12] The Papa guys who ran it, Owen and Papa Garb

[01:17:16] And all the team, the fixers, etc.

[01:17:19] Did a tremendous job, they kept 500 machines going for three days

[01:17:24] And you know, being part of that community

[01:17:28] And this kind of hobby is great to see it

[01:17:32] We're all passionate, we're all trying to go in the same direction

[01:17:36] So let's just remember that

[01:17:38] And actually, do you want to do one thing before you go

[01:17:42] Can you just do a little pitch on what your podcast is

[01:17:47] So that the people that watch my Twitch replay know how to get to it

[01:17:51] Yeah, sure

[01:17:52] It's Canada's Pinball podcast

[01:17:54] It's a weekly Pinball podcast

[01:17:56] We usually do about two to three podcasts a week

[01:18:00] And we focus primarily on new Pinball machines, the collector market

[01:18:05] We don't go into any of the tournament talk or strategies on how to play Pinball better

[01:18:10] Mainly because I suck at Pinball

[01:18:12] But we cover the news

[01:18:15] Anything that's going on in the Pinball world that's newsworthy

[01:18:19] You will hear it most likely here first

[01:18:22] So for those of you out there who are in the Pinball, I encourage you to check it out

[01:18:26] I think you'll find it entertaining

[01:18:28] And yeah, and we do it frequently

[01:18:31] So there'll be enough episodes to occupy your week in the world of Pinball

[01:18:37] So thank you for letting me do that plug, Neil

[01:18:39] And Neil, your final point was great

[01:18:41] It's all about the people

[01:18:42] The people make this hobby what it is

[01:18:44] Pinball will be boring if you're just playing by yourself in your home

[01:18:46] It's fun when friends come over, grab some beers

[01:18:49] And the shows are always fun because of the people

[01:18:51] So Neil, I appreciate you taking the time

[01:18:54] And we'll do this again soon

[01:18:56] I'd love to hear how your attack from Mars is when you get it

[01:18:58] So we'll have to get you back on

[01:19:00] I'll drop you an open arms

[01:19:02] Thanks for having me on

[01:19:04] And let's catch up soon

[01:19:08] Awesome

[01:19:26] Thanks for watching
