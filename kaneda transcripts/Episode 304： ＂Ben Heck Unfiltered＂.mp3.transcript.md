[00:00] You will talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me.

[00:05] I'm a little weak, I'll never, ever, ever, ever.

[00:10] Getting back together.

[00:12] Hush!

[00:13] Hush!

[00:15] Hush!

[00:18] Welcome to episode 304 of Canadian Spinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast in the world with a minor villain mode.

[00:27] Welcome, you're going to love this episode.

[00:29] This is going to be an interview that I think you're going to remember for a really long time.

[00:34] And the reason why I'm getting you guys some really incredible interviews is I got some advice months ago from another pinball podcast.

[00:41] And he said to me, the only way you win Twippy Awards is if you do good shows leading up to the Twippy show itself.

[00:50] And I think we're pulling out some pretty big guns.

[00:52] Now, if you haven't, if you haven't voted for Canadian Spinball Podcast, please do go to this week in pinball and fill out all your favorite game designers or work-in layouts.

[01:03] And make sure you write in Canadian.

[01:05] Now, let me spell that for you.

[01:07] K-A-N-E-D-A as your favorite pinball podcast.

[01:11] But you don't want to hear me speak.

[01:12] I'm not even going to talk about pinball news because you know what?

[01:15] This podcast, this podcast is going to make the pinball news, alright?

[01:20] Without further ado, I give you unfiltered, unedited, in-living color Ben Heck.

[01:28] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast, the ever entertaining, the super smart, super great engineer, a friend of the show, long time guest, Ben Heck.

[01:41] Ben, welcome back to the show.

[01:43] Hi, I don't know if I'm that great of an engineer, I'm just adequate.

[01:48] Alright, well, I knew you way before you even followed pinball, your day is modding gaming councils into to toaster ovens and other awesome shit.

[01:59] It feels like I've been around forever.

[02:01] Yeah, well, you're well known figure now in the pinball world.

[02:05] I'm glad you joined the show because I reached out to you after seeing a bunch of back and forth on pinside.

[02:10] And I really just wanted you to get a chance to tell your side of the story.

[02:14] For those of you out there who listen to this show, I mean, just a little bit of history, Ben worked at spooky pinball, Ben developed America's most haunted, right, Ben?

[02:24] Yes, the finest ghost hunting related pinball machine ever made, not not designed by a felon.

[02:31] Right, right.

[02:33] But it's fun.

[02:34] Yeah, John Trudeau just pleaded guilty to his charges.

[02:38] So we can hear the confirm that Ben is not convicted of any heinous crimes against humanity.

[02:45] At least not at the moment.

[02:46] Right, right.

[02:47] And then you also worked on Rob Zombie, you worked a little bit on Alice Cooper's name or castle.

[02:52] Somewhere in the middle of all of the titles coming out from spooky.

[02:57] I worked on Alice Cooper a lot more than I worked on Rob Zombie actually.

[03:01] Okay, well, I think what's curious, Ben, you know, a lot of people are curious about is, you know, we know you were working on your pin and long story short, you want to just explain like kind of what happened with how you feel and how your game got sort of put on the back burner and like just walk us to that background.

[03:19] Then I want to get to sort of like some of the more present stuff that people are saying.

[03:23] Right, I mean, I won't go into all the glory details because, you know, just out of professionalism.

[03:29] Well, yeah, so it was 2016 and oh, and you know, I was not Charlie posted on Pinside and yeah, he's right.

[03:36] I am like a whiner and I complain a lot and I am very moody and I have mood swings.

[03:41] However, I don't I wouldn't say that I'm a quitter.

[03:43] I think I'm pretty good at finishing things.

[03:45] Anyway, quitting every other week is that true.

[03:48] So after I finished America's most haunted, I was really burned out.

[03:53] It was so much work.

[03:55] And I was doing that on top of my day job, right?

[03:59] And so I was doing that nice in weekends and yeah, I had this really funny comment once I was at a convention.

[04:06] And someone was like, hey, you're not married. Are you?

[04:08] And I'm like, gee, how'd you guess?

[04:10] And they're like, well, that's the only way you can get this much stuff done.

[04:13] So I'm like, yes, that was one of the most astute come, you know, observations I ever saw.

[04:17] But so by the time I was done with it, or like, you know, where I had the code in a good place, which I would say was about a year after I went on sale.

[04:25] And that's when it actually started selling really well as well.

[04:27] Like winter of 2014.

[04:29] Right.

[04:30] I was just so burnt out that 2014 was a really rough year for me.

[04:35] Like getting that code done and then having the game not sell very well, but then still improving the code.

[04:40] And I did a big huge update in October of 2014. I think it was.

[04:45] And that's what actually, uh,

[04:47] right.

[04:48] And Ben, just to sort of stop when you start to think, when we start to address things like in chronological order, what was it like when, you know, you

[04:57] you you slaved the way at the game. You were working, you know, late nights, you're doing every aspect of America's most haunted and sales were sluggish and it's something that I read was that

[05:08] that deflated you that did it when you saw that like sales weren't like speeding up and it required them to sort of limit the number.

[05:17] Like what was that like when you were you down and out on the pinball community who wanted an original theme and you gave it them one.

[05:24] I think that when the pinball community asked for original theme, they're full of shit. They don't actually want that.

[05:29] They want license themes that they know, which is fine.

[05:33] Actually, it was your best friend, Hilton, who suggested, hey, if you set a cap to the number of units made, you'll sell out very quickly.

[05:42] Right. So that's when I think it was like the pinball convention 2014, we're like, okay, 150 units, which again, in hindsight, that was way too low.

[05:53] Whatever, we're like 150 units. We set that cap and then I did a big code update like October 2014 was really rough month.

[06:03] I was working full time and I moved my shop and I did this huge update. That was probably the hardest month of work in my life.

[06:12] But then by the time I got to TFF 2015, it really started selling and it was funny. It took us like a year to sell like 70 units and then back half it was gone in like a couple of months.

[06:24] And actually the week that what was that remember when the big Lebowski had like fill gate remember like late 2014.

[06:33] Yep, he announced that he was leaving. He woke. I think he refunded people's money at like midnight. And he basically said that these guys are full of shit. And how wrong he was, you know, that game sold what five, six thousand units today.

[06:48] A million copies. I just want to say a lot of that money when right into our pockets. So that actually worked out really well for us. We actually sold a lot of units that week. And I think that's where it actually started to pick up.

[06:59] Yeah, but so yes, I was definitely kind of, you know, depressed about it. Well, you're not really depressed. But it's like, oh God. I think about stuff, you know, like, as you mentioned, like video gaming or where I'm known in the past.

[07:12] And it's like, it's kind of like when you're at a school and your parents pull out of the school and you go to a new school and you have to like make friends all over again, which has happened to be as well. It kind of felt like that.

[07:22] It's like, okay, now I have to prove myself in the pinball world. Right. And I think that's what we did. Was it at that point? So I just just want to, you know, get your side of the story.

[07:32] Ben is where you offered half of the company at that point to join and sort of be Charlie's 50 50 partner.

[07:40] You know, honestly, I don't remember. It sounds like something he would say. I mean, his big thing was like move to Benton. Right? That's.

[07:48] Oh my God. He says that like every other line. It's like, there's a snake in my boots. Kind of thing.

[07:55] And we're buddy live right now. I live in Madison, Wisconsin. Okay. And how far is Benton from Madison?

[08:02] It's about an hour and a half and it's pretty much freeway the entire time. So it's. You know, I would typically go down there like every other month, you know, before I just like rage quit.

[08:11] Okay. So you didn't you didn't take them up on the offer. You didn't want to move there. And we were.

[08:17] Well, I was making I was making really good money at the Ben Hex show because that was a corporate sponsored gig.

[08:25] Right. Why would I give that up? Right. And so what was the offer? I mean, was the offer if you'd have to give that up completely, right?

[08:34] To focus full time on Pimbal and at that point, there was in a financial upside that you could see.

[08:42] Right. Because that's when we were still struggling. And again, I. I. This is this is like what five years ago, which might as well be a million years ago, as far as my mind is concerned.

[08:51] So I really can't speak to that. I know he definitely wanted me to, you know, move down there and, you know, do Pimbal full time. But.

[08:58] But I couldn't because again, you know, I. You know, Charlie left.

[09:04] You know, he worked at a print shop or something. He left a job that let's just say he left a job that paid incredibly less than I was making at the time.

[09:13] So it was a lot. It would be a lot harder for me to make that jump. Although later on, I was willing to make it, which is where my second game kind of comes into play.

[09:22] Okay. So yeah, because I want to sort of, I think it's important to tell the story in order of how things transpired because obviously things started out rough.

[09:32] Sales weren't great with America's most on it. They picked up when they made a limited edition game. Then we get on to Rob Zombie, which what was your involvement in Rob Zombie?

[09:43] Well, I believe he started talking to Mr. Zombie around.

[09:48] I think it was like January 2015. So it was right around the time that America's most on it was picking up.

[09:53] Right. So once that got some steam, I think that opened up the door to being able to, you know, buy other licenses.

[09:58] And then I think that thing was like, I think he had it pretty much, he pretty much had it like in March of that year.

[10:07] And then I think he, yeah, he'd had that pinball zombies from beyond the grave game.

[10:12] And then he turned that into Rob Zombie. I mean, he made some changes along the way.

[10:17] And then really that game as Rob Zombie kind of went into production or I'm sorry, went into like design production, I would say like 2015.

[10:27] I want to say like around June of that year. And then as far as my involvement with that, I've read the libraries for the

[10:36] the code because America's most on code. The people like the rules, but the underlying code is like a horrible mess.

[10:46] Right. It's like the remote starter on my car that somebody installed before I bought it because I bought a used car that probably make your skin crawl.

[10:54] I look and look at this bundle of wires and it's disgusting. It's like, I don't even want to think that's under my under my column or whatever. Right.

[11:01] It's like, extreme my own intestines. Like I don't want to, I don't want to accept the fact that's in my body. Gross.

[11:06] But so at that time, Charlie wanted me to program Rob Zombie. And I'm like, I can't. I am too burned out.

[11:14] I just spent, you know, almost three years working out of America's most haunted at that point because I started that in early 2012.

[11:21] Even before there was a spooky pinball. I just was doing his my own game, you know, like everybody else like.

[11:26] And Ben, just, you know, obviously we're talking about you sort of figuring out what makes sense for you from a career standpoint, from a financial standpoint.

[11:36] Yeah. In terms of your involvement with the Americans most haunted is it was the contract like you would make a certain amount every game sold or was it a salary to work on the game?

[11:46] Like what, what was like the setup that I was I got a royalty for every game.

[11:52] Okay, so when they said 150, you're kind of like, well, shit. Now, now I'm capped.

[11:59] I didn't make a dime off of spooky pinball until games went off the door, which is a really good way to ensure that games go out the door.

[12:06] That's pinball.

[12:08] Where? Insert company here. Right. You work a lot harder for money. That's not in the bank.

[12:14] Which I think will benefit, you know, deep root, for instance, but yes, not having investors or I'm sorry, not having pre orders, but they must be paying their employees at deep root and not not have everyone working pro bono into sales occur, right?

[12:29] I mean, they have a huge team from what I've heard they pay very competitively, which is good.

[12:36] Yes, scary because you got to make up that money somehow, right?

[12:40] I guess that's his investors concern. Right.

[12:45] Oh, how many going going back to the royalty thing? So yeah, basically we had Americans most haunted and Charlie and I split the profit on every game.

[12:54] And I'm sure I'm guarantee I made, I put more in my pocket because of it because he put everything right back into business. And I just put it in stock market.

[13:04] Good time to be in the market.

[13:07] Okay. So then I asked out last summer, how does it? How did it work? You're working there. So when you're working on a game, are you driving an hour and a half to go into spooky pinball is our work you can do from your memory.

[13:19] I still had my day job. So I would, I would at that time, I would work on, I would work on my game like in the evenings. I would like, I would get done with whatever we're doing at the shop.

[13:32] Then I would program a room because most haunted until like seven o'clock or I would do it on the weekends or I would drive down to spooky pinball on the weekends. Right.

[13:40] Okay. I spent many, many, many nights in Charlie's downstairs living room on his lumpy couch. I think that he called it the Nordman suite because when Dennis Nardman would visit, he'd stay in that same room too.

[13:56] I sure hope that couch is gone. I always told Charlie I love him. Or fumigated. Hopefully, John Trudeau never stayed there. Oh, no, I hope that couch burns.

[14:07] Edit that out. Alright. Well, so Ben, so it sounds like you had a lot in your plate. You get burnt out quickly. Maybe some of the more strident language of you quitting every other week is more about you just being burnt out and you break kind of thing versus like,

[14:25] you know, I think it's hard. You can't keep quitting every week because at some point you're coming back. So, yeah, I think that might have been a bit of an exaggeration. Once we got to the point, I mean, I definitely was really burned out on pinball, but I still was helping with the Rob Zombie game. But then in 2016, when we were going to start my next game, I was totally on board. Okay. So I got all of my bichiness.

[14:54] My original bichiness and wishy washiness was like mostly in 2015. Like, first of all, I'll crap. Nobody wants my ghost game. Then, okay, if you want my ghost game, I'm feeling good, but I'm really burnt out. I mean, I feel like what Scott's an easy said he's not going to program his next game. I bet he feels the same way. Right. It's just too much work for one person.

[15:16] I mean, that's what it seems. And so let's talk about 2016 and your next title that was slated to be a spooky release. So how did that whole thing transpire? Like, what was communicated to you? What were you expecting with that game and its release? And then what happened?

[15:38] Because I think that's sort of become the center of gravity of a lot of the back and forth lately. Well, one part of it that I can say because Charlie said it during a convention, which I guess means its public knowledge is that originally I was going to do money python and the holy grail as a license.

[15:56] And I guess, well, as often happens, I guess I think Terry Williams daughter is responsible for all of their marketing or licensing. And I think I think they they pitched it to Stern, but Stern turned it down. And then probably because they had at the time they had medieval madness coming out end game of thrones, you know, similar themes.

[16:17] Yeah, so Charlie's like, I think we can get you that I'm like, OK, cool. So I started designing a black night because of course the main toy has to be the black night. And the idea was, how did it work? I had a rotating cam for his legs. So the cam would rotate kind of almost like a music box, you know, like a little pegs on it that hit the the tines.

[16:41] The cam would rotate in such a way that I think it was either weights or gravity or magnets or his legs would fall off. The cam would rotate like 20 degrees, one leg would fall off and rotate 20 more degrees the other leg would fall off. And then there's an arm that lowered his body.

[16:54] And then his arms would also they wouldn't fall off. They'd kind of go behind his backs. Look, I mean, basically every time you hit him, you would dismember part of him. Right. Where where are they go? They fell off on a pinball play field.

[17:07] They don't fall off like they fold behind his back. You know, like in a movie where they someone lost an arm and they just tape it behind the back.

[17:16] OK, right. Well, do you remember like, yeah, it wasn't transformers. Do you remember those cars back in the 80s, old diecast cars where they had like simulated damage? Remember, do you remember those? You like smash the car and like a little panel would flip around and flip over in the call.

[17:30] Yeah, it was kind of like that. Right. And then I think that whole thing ran off like two cams. So you could give you could if you moved it less than 20 degrees, it would like give you kind of a free animation.

[17:44] You know, so you could like jiggle a little bit. Me like, oh, what are you going to do bleed all me? And then I wanted one of those World Cup soccer very targets that go back and forth. You know those.

[17:53] I wanted to have one of those in front. So that would be like a shield. So that would be moving. And if you hit that, he'd give you a negative or tort. And if you got the ball past it, that's when you would, you know, take a piece of his armor off. So it was really out. Oh, there's the night. That's a shield.

[18:08] Right. You know, super obvious. Like, did you actually physically make this toy or is this a design concept? I had it in foam core and rough 3D printed parts. OK.

[18:18] So I did, but then I can't wait one of the one of the flying circus guys got dementia. I don't know which one it was. And that's one of those deals where everybody has to sign off on something.

[18:28] So there was a period there where basically they weren't really able to make any deals. And that's when that license drifted away.

[18:36] OK. So you get the word that this license can't move forward for the reasons you just described. And then what happens next, you're sort of you're going back to the vault of another theme I can think of.

[18:49] I will say one thing about money Python. It's like, we would have to do it very, very well. Because basically we would have to make the real thing better than the rip off, which is medieval madness. And that's a tall order.

[19:03] Right. So that was one concern of mine. Yeah. The number one or two game of all time. So maybe it was a blessing in disguise.

[19:14] I think I think money Python could have been cool. My pitch was to make the make the LCD like a 16 bit RPG game. You know, like you'd be collecting members that look like a super Nintendo game. And they walk around and they'd fight like 16 bit dragons and stuff.

[19:29] Part of my reason for doing that was to make the hardware, the hardware requirements lower. So we wouldn't we wouldn't have to use p rock.

[19:37] I mean, we haven't seen anyone even come within a country mile, though of making a toy or mechanism as cool as the medieval man is castle.

[19:45] And the thing is that castle is so simple. Right. It's just it's just one solenoid. I think that's what they really need in pinball. They need.

[19:52] Max that are satisfying that there's a satisfying result to physical action of the ball, but also make the Mac simple enough that it doesn't cause production issues.

[20:02] And you know that castle is fairly simple, but you know, everyone understands the concept of destroying castles, you know, castle siege.

[20:11] You don't have to explain it to people, you know, we've all seen.

[20:14] Interesting because I mean, I'm going to jump forward a little bit, but we have a castle game that eventually comes out from spooky and Alice Cooper is which has a huge physical castle, but there was really nothing animated about it.

[20:28] That is absolutely true.

[20:30] We'll talk later about that game. So let's talk about. Okay. See, Bonnie Python had to be done right license was an issue.

[20:37] You then then go back to the drawing board for another theme.

[20:42] Yeah, we never we never got I never got into the layout phase of that game. I mean, you know, again, it wasn't really for sure. So that's I basically just started with that toy concept.

[20:53] I don't know if I still have those in a box in place. I'm sure I have the files. Okay. I think it would have been really cool.

[21:00] Uh, yeah. So then we were looking at another theme, which I still won't, you know, say what it is because there wasn't NDA attached to that. So I.

[21:07] Well, okay, but I got to stop you there because somebody grabbed a Twitter conversation in which it you said how cool it evil dead be as a pinball machine.

[21:17] So that's a rhetorical statement.

[21:22] Okay. So you can't confirm or deny that it would be evil dead, but let's just hypothetically said you were working on something.

[21:28] Like a question I have been so within this the spooky umbrella as a company.

[21:34] Was there any pressure to make sure the themes aligned with the spooky theme?

[21:39] Sort of as a, you know, sort of a whole you mean you mean your thing where spooky is not a very good name for the football company because it implies over game needs to be spooky.

[21:48] No, there was never any any pressure to do that. Right.

[21:54] Okay. I mean, think about Jetsons isn't spooky dominoes isn't well, they, but also it's fun.

[21:59] Well, they might be spooky spooky still doesn't consider those games to be spooky games. It's weird. Well, you know, they're like contract manufactured, but they don't.

[22:07] It's weird. They put the ghost on those machines, but then whenever they list out spooky games, they always leave out those games. So it's like which one is it anyway.

[22:15] So you go to the drawing board on a game that you can't talk about because of NDA or respect that even though I just said what I saw.

[22:22] And so you started that in 2016.

[22:26] Correct. So this is this is the kind of part where it gets a little.

[22:30] I don't say dicey for me, but I guess where some of my consternation comes from.

[22:34] So at that time, you know, after like, you know, years and years of Charlie like asking me to just, you know, go quit my day.

[22:42] Charlie's big joke was that I convinced him to quit his day job and started a pinball company. And I'm like, no Charlie, I told you not to do that.

[22:50] Although it did work for him. So well, you know, it's still it's a risk in Denver.

[22:56] But then in 2016, I was pretty tired of doing my show because it was very stressful and a lot of work and my blood pressure was way up.

[23:04] Because it was basically a weekly, you know, television production.

[23:08] Yeah. Anyway, so I was like, OK, you know, if we're going to do this license, this was the plan. I'm like, I'll start making it.

[23:17] I think I think I started out in November of 2016.

[23:21] I built a new super rotisserie, which is the most amazing development rotisserie there is.

[23:26] I built that and then yeah, I started doing all these foam core mockets.

[23:31] This is really cool. It's just because it basically has an Italian bottom and then the top most of it is a big half inch foam core cartridge.

[23:39] You know, like a piece of, you know, foam core is right.

[23:42] And what I could do is I could put a bunch of stuff in the foam core and then it all worked to a suitable game.

[23:49] And then I could pop the cap off the back slide the foam core cartridge out. I think it was like 30 by 40.

[23:57] No, it was. Oh, yeah, it was 20. It was 20 and it was 20 and a half by 30.

[24:05] No, I'm sure my podcast listeners are going to try to recreate those schematics, but keep going.

[24:11] No, it was 20. It's a 20 by 30 piece of foam core. And then as your listeners probably know, a play field is 20.25.

[24:18] So the cartridge shimmed in between two one eighth inch thick pieces of steel centering the cartridge in the correct area.

[24:27] I put a lot of thought into it. Anyway, so you pull the cartridge out. Oh, and then the cartridge.

[24:32] You take you get the foam core, but then you spray adhesive this grid onto it like a coordinates grid. Right.

[24:38] Then you put down all your pieces and try it out. Then you can take a photo of it and scan it into the computer.

[24:44] And then the next iteration, you take what you know, you take what you drew into the computer, print that out with a coordinates grid at kinkos or whatever.

[24:53] Then slap that on foam core and then do the next revision. Okay. So you're going to make sense physical and digital design.

[24:59] Yeah. So I actually start with physical design foam core. Once I've got like some rails on it and you know, I like the way it shoots.

[25:06] I pull it out. I scan it in the computer. Then I print a new copy of it that has the same, you know, measurement grid lines, but it also has the thing that I added.

[25:17] Okay. Oh, I like this target. I like this curve. So I print that in it. Then I stick it back in the machine and then I rebuild the surface because I've got a guide for it.

[25:26] Okay. Here's where the rails go. Here's that drop Tucker goes. And the foam core, you can just cut that with an exacto knife. Right.

[25:31] So then I build up the next revision and then I start adding more stuff to it. I went through like five versions of that before I even did a whitewood question for you Ben. So at this stage and I'm always curious about this.

[25:42] Did you have a license in mind that was locked or were you just designing a game and then you would think about the license later?

[25:50] No, I designed it with the license in mind, which I think is what you should do when you're designing a game.

[25:54] But I guess my question then is like you're starting the work on the game. Did you know the license was available and you could have it?

[26:02] That was the issue of the license was a negotiation, but then there were issues that prevented it from being obtainable, which of course means money.

[26:11] Okay. And was it a question I have to be because spooky's games always seem to be around the same price.

[26:17] Was there ever a conversation internally over there? Well, if we have to, if we have to charge 500 more per game and that gets me the license, let's just do it.

[26:27] We're watching Stern and all these other guys charge $9,000 for nothing but artwork.

[26:32] That conversation happened. David Van Eszen, I pitched the idea of offering a mere 150 LEs, you know, because 150 A matures.

[26:42] 150 LEs at only 500 extra each would have done it. And that's where I was like kind of threw my hands up in the air.

[26:51] And maybe that's a little bit too much information, you know, Charlie's going to kick me in the balls, but I mean, I just don't think that's good business.

[26:57] Honestly, you know, that's and that should be everyone's concern, not just mine, but anyone that works there or anyone that invests in the product.

[27:04] Well, I've always said, you know, I don't get it. And I've said this on the show and I think Ben you listen.

[27:11] The notion that this hobby can't absorb $500 more to get a theme people want is a name because the people who buy these games for the most part are millionaires.

[27:25] So I think I think Charlie has too many friends who are rich pinheads. He can't step back and realize how rich the customers are.

[27:32] Like we live in we live in a country where 50% of the population can't cover an emergency $500 expense.

[27:38] That's why you see check cashing and loan title places in every strip mall, right?

[27:44] Like people who can buy $6,000 toy can buy $7,000 toy can buy an $8,000 toy. They're very well off.

[27:52] And yes, you're right. It's not that much of a stretch, but more.

[27:55] And the number one rule of business pass all pass all costs increase on the customers.

[28:00] It also seems kind of ironic to me that you can also go order like a $700 butter cabinet upgrade, which you don't really need.

[28:10] But that price was not seen as a thousand dollars for that.

[28:15] Right. So it's like, I don't know. And this seems like a theme people really wanted.

[28:20] So I can see how that would have been frustrating. And I've always said I think some of these manufacturers, it's like they feel like they're doing it for the greater good of pinball and not understanding the marketplace they're even in.

[28:35] Yeah, I mean, when I when I first started doing this with America's most haunted, I didn't understand the marketplace enough.

[28:43] And now I do. Yeah, it's well, you say this all the time. It's middle age white dudes who are rich. And they want.

[28:50] And I think you a little bit further with this. They want to they want to remind themselves of being single.

[28:57] So they turn their bars. They turn they turn their basements into bars to remind themselves to be in their 20s. And they want themes that remind them of being 10.

[29:05] That's it. That's that's the key.

[29:08] And I think you've learned this lesson too.

[29:11] You know, we're not going to hold punches on this show. America's most haunted art package.

[29:17] Not the best, but knowing what you know now, you could have taken 10 grand got an incredible artist to just one time cost to make it one of the sexiest pinball machines.

[29:28] And then you raise the price of every game by like 400 500 bucks. And you're you're good. Like it's it's yeah, I mean, look at look at Stern's Ellie model.

[29:38] I mean, I don't know what Christopher Frenchy charges. It's probably, you know, it's probably a good amount. But let's say it's I don't know. I mean, just just from what I know of art budgets.

[29:46] I would say another you could probably get another art package for $10,000, right? So for for $10,000.

[29:53] And that's all Ellie is is a different art package now in a stupid $1 plaque for $10,000 and a $1 plaque.

[30:01] You can basically write yourself a check for two grand more per game. And what Stern does is when they have like, all right, we got to develop spike two like raise the price.

[30:10] And that's business like you basically it's it's just like a free to play mobile games. There's whales out there that buy all the stupid transactions and crap.

[30:20] And that pays for everyone who plays a game for free. It's the same kind of thing you find the customers who are willing to vomit out money. And you take as much of their money as possible.

[30:29] Right. I agree. I mean, I still to this day I look at when I go to pinball shows and I see the way people gobble up these games and then we're talking they gobble up these games been without even playing them.

[30:44] Without even seeing them sometimes. They're writing checks for $9,000. So, okay. So let's get back to the story of the game gets put on the shelf because you designed to a theme that spooky was not going to be.

[30:58] So, I think he was not going to increase the price to allow you to pay the license or to make the game. So where's the game now? Like is it is it pretty complete and it's just like it just needs a manufacturer to.

[31:12] No, it's not really complete. I submitted the whitewood files in June of 2017. And that was around the same time that they were getting TNA and a production.

[31:24] And I don't think this is any surprise else Cooper was supposed to come out in 2017, which is probably fairly humorous to hear now, but it was originally.

[31:34] And it wasn't ready because there wasn't enough investment into creative. And so TNA came along and saved some butts.

[31:46] And it sounds like it saved the company without it. There was nothing on the roster, right?

[31:52] I think people could probably do the math and come to that conclusion without me actually saying it.

[31:57] It was a smart move. I mean, we've said on the show every time. I mean, grabbing TNA was a smart move. The game was developed. It was making waves at the shows it went to.

[32:10] And it's done. It's been the best selling game. And I've always said the best selling game is a really spooky game.

[32:15] And the only reason they stopped taking orders was because they wanted to get Al Scooper done before, you know, before this license term obviously.

[32:22] So. Right. And yeah, he can make it. Okay. So no, they'll probably make more TNAs in the future. They may as well. It's unlicensed so they can make it forever.

[32:30] Right. Absolutely. So at this point, I guess what I'm saying is between them working on Al's team,

[32:38] working on Al's Cooper and spooling up TNA because they needed something for the line. My game just got lost in the shuffle basically.

[32:46] And that's when I'm like, Hey, okay, well, give me something to do because I'm on retainer. And that's when I started working on Al's Cooper creative stuff.

[32:54] What are your thoughts on Al's Cooper?

[32:57] I.

[33:02] I'm not a huge fan of it. I think more time could have been spent on some things.

[33:07] But I'm proud of all the storyboarding that I did for the screen and working with David Van S.

[33:14] And then Jeff who took my storyboards and made them into awesome art. So yeah, of course I'm going to say that my favorite parts are what I did.

[33:22] When the ecosystem bastard.

[33:25] I think some of the early criticisms we've had are just tight shots. And that just seems to be something that we hear not just on spooky games.

[33:34] We heard it on a Houdini that games that are brick fest sometimes frustrated people more than entertain them. Do you think the shots are a little tight in the game?

[33:45] I think in games that I like to design, I think you should have some shots that are easier to hit, wide open and rewarding.

[33:55] What was it, Ratho Olympus? You were talking about that recently, right?

[33:58] Again, there's one for sale for $25,000. I mean, sure.

[34:02] That game.

[34:04] The shots were way too tight. Did you ever play it? There was like kind of like this like almost like fan layout where all the entry points or stand-up targets were at the same distance from the flippers.

[34:15] And all the shots were really tight. So you had to get the ball past all of that.

[34:19] Rigor Morote even see it do anything else. And wasn't very enjoyable.

[34:23] Yeah, it's the same way in Houdini to feed the most rewarding shot, which is that awesome. No can shot.

[34:29] There's like this shot you have to hit that's barely the size of the ball. I mean, it's a little bit wider.

[34:35] Yeah, and they were what shaving down stand-up targets even.

[34:39] Yeah, it's actually kind of a cool idea to make a skinnier target.

[34:42] Well, I think with most of these games, I've said the same thing with Alice Cooper's with Houdini.

[34:46] If you just have one less shot and open up every other shot and make those shots more rewarding, how is that not going to make the game more fun?

[34:54] And I think what happens to is I think there's a panic. And this is just me guessing a little bit in my supposition is that I think there's anxiety that if we make a game too easy,

[35:07] the tournament players who are the guys who are testing the games all the time are going to are going to revolt.

[35:14] But here's the here's the thing that nobody in the marketplace gets.

[35:18] I know what you're going to say by your fucking games.

[35:21] Oh, okay, I didn't expect you to say that.

[35:23] No, they don't. The 20 players who like there's like a handful then like they're like,

[35:27] Hey, Hilton buys a lot of pins brand new pins.

[35:30] Right. And I think and he also thinks that Rath of Olympus is an amazing shooter.

[35:36] That's that's probably because he has one and he wants to get 25 and try to show up the price.

[35:41] It's funny.

[35:42] Hey, you know, if you had something that cost you $6,000 in part, you can get 25 grand for it. Why not?

[35:47] But Ben, he says that he turned down an offer for $25,000.

[35:52] I can't tell you if you did or not. I'm not like a psychologist.

[35:58] No, it's what he said. He said if this is any indication of the unsolicited offers, I got he goes,

[36:04] this game should sell fast. It's for sale for $25,000. So anyway, we don't want to talk about that.

[36:12] So I was going to say one more thing.

[36:15] What's the one I thought you were going to say regarding tournament players?

[36:18] You can always make a game more difficult and deeper with code, but you could never change the geometry.

[36:24] Absolutely. And that's the part that's a great point because I never understand why people complain about a game where it's like easy to hit the shots,

[36:33] but you could always make the code difficult. Right. And I saw we saw this on Batman when Lyman Sheets was coding Batman.

[36:41] The shots on Batman are not hard to hit, right. But he made some of the minor villains like the original way he coded bookworm.

[36:49] You had a hit like it was like 15 to 17 shots in a row to complete the mode, right. That's hard.

[36:54] Yeah, it's hard. You can always math it up like we're like on monsters.

[36:58] They've got that Dracula target and that Lily target, which is just cost cutting.

[37:02] But there's nothing to stop them from making it like three hits per letter.

[37:06] Like maybe the L and Lily gets brighter, brighter, brighter than the next I gets brighter, brighter, brighter.

[37:11] You know like three shades per hit. Right.

[37:14] As long as you have a way to easily catch the ball, stop the ball, show an animation.

[37:18] If you have, you know, some physical mechanism for stopping the ball to have start stop animation, mode start, whatever.

[37:25] You can always make the code more difficult just by making it deeper or having higher requirements.

[37:29] So besides America's most haunted out of all the games that spooky is made to date, which one would you like to own?

[37:38] Oh, probably TNA.

[37:43] I like TNA.

[37:45] Yeah, I mean, that's the greatest selling game.

[37:47] The American or the global pinball buying public has also decided that that is the game that they would also like to buy.

[37:54] I think they're making 550 before they switched the line over completely to Alice Cooper.

[37:59] Why do you think Charlie showed Alice Cooper at T.P.F. and it's been a long wait?

[38:05] Because he had TNA right?

[38:08] Was it was it just to be there?

[38:11] I'm always curious about the decisions these guys make because that was after I kind of like walked away.

[38:20] I don't know.

[38:22] I suppose I never.

[38:24] He must have figured he needed to show something, but he had TNA being made.

[38:27] And again, I think a lot of it is just anxiety, right?

[38:30] And I, you know, to well, because a lot of times when you get a license, whether or not you're actually manufacturing the game, the clock is ticking.

[38:38] Like, you know, everyone talks about Big Lebowski.

[38:40] It's like that license is so expired.

[38:42] It's like not even funny.

[38:45] Right.

[38:46] Were you a fan of the $1,000 non-refundable deposit strategy?

[38:53] Uh...

[38:54] I mean, you're basically asking people to give a thousand bucks.

[39:00] Honestly, I think that speaks to a lack of confidence in one's design.

[39:05] But they're asking for that for TNA too, right?

[39:08] No, not with TNA.

[39:10] It was birthed out of, I get why it happened.

[39:13] That might, that might decision, you know.

[39:15] It was birthed to, it was birthed out of response to what people were doing with Rob Zombie, where people were, you know, back then and again, it's like, we say back then, like, it was 50 years ago.

[39:26] It was actually like three years ago.

[39:28] Back in my day, right.

[39:30] People were like flipping machines quickly for a buck, because if they were limited, you, you could make a dollar or two.

[39:37] People, we saw people flipping.

[39:39] Rob Zombie was up to like eight or $9,000 of them point, and then it quickly dropped below the retail price.

[39:45] And then what happened was, guys had ordered them in the way they wanted, and then they bailed right before they were supposed to take shipment, and that's why.

[39:54] And look, for a big company like Stern, who already sells through to all these distributors, they can weather, you know, a few Jackass flippers like me doing that to them.

[40:03] They can't spooky camp weather that kind of behavior, because to your point, once people saw Rob Zombie selling on the second hand market for much cheaper, why would you buy a new one, right?

[40:17] So that's what I had that same concern, like I saw, I don't remember what convention it was, because back then I was going to too many goddamn conventions, but I was at some show and somebody had a Marikas most Honda for like 5750, you know,

[40:31] less than $6,000, and we haven't even like sold them all yet. I'm like, oh fuck, you know, I was I was pretty worried.

[40:38] Right. What that's me, I'm the pessimist who worries about things like that.

[40:42] So, okay, so I want to ask you about some other companies when we do this show.

[40:49] Just closing the loop on unspookie. It sounds like Ben, do you still want to work in pinball?

[40:58] Yeah, I mean, I would like to see how much better I could do. You know, how much I could improve. After I did at Marikas most haunted, I was doing library support, graphics drivers, you know, dot drivers, stuff like that.

[41:12] Any on not a whole lot of creative work. It's like I'd like to be creative again. I mean, I guess I did, you know, storyboard and I wrote, you know, quite a bit of dialogue for Rob Zombie.

[41:21] Knowing the pinball landscape, knowing all the companies that are out there. If I could, you know, snap my fingers and place you at one of the companies, which one would you love to go work for tomorrow?

[41:33] I think you've asked me this before, haven't you?

[41:36] I don't know, I mean, what, an episode 217, we're on 304 here.

[41:40] Well, you do like a podcast every day, so it's hard to keep track.

[41:44] I mean, I have to have to win, you know, with cadence. I can't win with quality.

[41:50] Honestly, I can't say I would say that I, I don't know. I think you've asked me this before too many of them are, let me, let me, like, are you intrigued by deep root?

[42:03] You've met with Robert. Oh, I've met Robert many times. He tried to buy spooky, right?

[42:09] Is that public record?

[42:11] That's what, I mean, that's what I hear through the grapevine. It is now.

[42:16] I mean, look, I think it worked out. I don't think you know. I think they care now. I mean, they've got their thing going on.

[42:21] I mean, I, I think I said on an earlier show this a couple weeks ago, I think Chuck should have took the money, but,

[42:27] well, you know what happens is first, as soon as you sell your company, guess what happens? Founder gets fired.

[42:35] Well, that's why you get money, though.

[42:37] Exactly, because again, business 101, have an exit strategy. So regarding deep root, I'm, of course, I'm curious to see what they make.

[42:45] I think they'll either completely blow us away or completely fail. I don't think there's going to be an in between.

[42:51] Right. I agree. I think they either hit it out of the park or they, they with.

[42:57] And I think everyone sounds like they're doing a lot of original themes based off that interview you did.

[43:02] The previous interview you did with Lutz's face with Quinn. Yeah. I mean, well, we know for sure they are doing a lot of originals, right?

[43:08] It's like, you've got all of John's originals, J. Pops. You've got it sounds like original from, from Barry and Dennis and, you know, we know they secured an 80s theme.

[43:20] We know that. But,

[43:22] Well, anybody wants, do you think that's a real risk? You know, we talk a lot about this, Ben, all the time.

[43:29] I definitely do. I think I think these companies are drunk on original themes right now, and I don't think the market could sustain it.

[43:35] Yeah, it's hard to market an original theme. It's hard to, it's hard to pull people in.

[43:41] What people need to remember with TNA is that it was being taken as shows for at least a year before it was sold.

[43:48] So people like the game, not just being sucked into the license or the theme, right?

[43:55] So it proved itself. People were asking for it to be made.

[43:59] But if you just pull an original theme out of your ass, like, oh, I don't know, dialed in. People were going to be like, what the fuck is this?

[44:05] Right. And it's a great game, but you know, you either have to sell people on the game or sell them on the license.

[44:11] That was, that was going back to spooky for just a second. I know Chuck, Chuck did say, oh, we'll just, you know, make your game into an unlicensed theme like the America's Most HANA to follow up.

[44:20] The, you know, urban legends game. And that's a cool idea, but, you know, it would probably sell better than America's Most HANA,

[44:28] but it's not going to sell as much as a license would. Right. Okay. I'm sorry. No, absolutely. And I think the other part of TNA though.

[44:36] And I think this is a fair assessment. I think TNA also sold a lot because people love Scott Dinesi. And he's a man of the people within the community.

[44:47] And that goes a long way. He can't underestimate the fact that if John Papaduke showed TNA the exact same game, there's not the same affinity.

[44:57] And I also think TNA did some things. It felt original and fresh with the light show. It was, it was, you know, a little bit back to basics of pinball for people. You didn't walk up to it. And it wasn't like a confused complex pinball experience. It was fast and fun and furious for people.

[45:15] Even when I interviewed George Gomez, he was like, the one game I really love that the shows was TNA, you know, that's a glowing endorsement for that game. So Chuck made the right move.

[45:24] So Ben, you are, you are now a talented man in limbo. There are a lot of pinball manufacturers out there that are trying to be successful, be competitive.

[45:36] What are your thoughts on the companies that are out there? We just talked a little bit about deep route. Do you think, oh, I want to say one more thing about TNA.

[45:43] I think a huge part of its success was it was so effing loud. You could hear it above all the cacophony that all the pinball shows and you were drawn to it.

[45:51] Yeah, it sounded amazing. And the light show too, right? It just, it's like, ooh, what's that?

[45:57] Well, you know, you know what you're when you're at a pinball show and you hear like a certain audio clip or a certain sound effect, you're like, oh, they've got that game here, right?

[46:05] You got a little adrenaline boost. TNA, you could hear that thing across the country.

[46:10] Right.

[46:11] All right. I'm sorry. I know. And it's why it found its niche within the marketplace. And again, it's not trying to sell five thousand.

[46:21] It's trying to, you know, just sell a few hundred.

[46:24] Now, thinking back though, let's say they sell, I don't know, well, they, hey, they, five 50 is more than I thought they'd sell. My bet was 300.

[46:31] That's really good for spooky, although I don't know if that would have been considered a success for any other company, but it's great for spooky.

[46:37] I don't know how many stern would have made. I think Europeans would have loved that fucking thing.

[46:41] I mean, I would just love to know this is always what's hard.

[46:44] How many Houdinis did they sell?

[46:49] Considering how much that's dropped in the secondary market, I would bet under a thousand. I highly doubt it sold a thousand units.

[46:59] I don't think it sold a thousand. That's what I'm saying. I mean, I don't know. Maybe Tina is sold more than Houdini. They'll never tell us. So speaking of America, if they won't tell you, then that means the numbers not very good.

[47:11] Right. Well, we know, and what's crazy too is Jersey Jack came out and started to reveal sales numbers, not that I believe him, but he said that dialed in sold 1500, which is a colossal flop for them when you think about it.

[47:26] Because they are set up for volume. It's an original theme and that's it's a tough sell. Yeah, they probably sold like what four or five thousand was it a boss? That came has been smash hit.

[47:38] Right.

[47:39] And what's interesting about Jack is every title since was it's he's had nothing but sales declines so 4,000 2000 hobbits 1500 dialed in and I don't you know, I don't think pirates is going to like be a sales success.

[48:00] Again, pirates was like, hey, this game has to be cool. And that's what made people want it. I mean, the theme, you know, it's basically kind of a done theme. I mean, maybe in China, they still care, but as far as America's concerned that IP is pretty old.

[48:20] But I mean, you keep talking about a Willy Wonka or a toy story. Either one of those themes will be it doesn't matter if it's a blank piece of plywood with art on it. They'll sell.

[48:32] Yeah, absolutely. I think Jack has got juggernaut themes waiting guns and roses, Willy Wonka and toy story. He just needs to make them. The question is, will his billionaire investor be fed up if pirate sales are not where they need to be?

[48:48] Yeah, I guess that would be the question. But when you're a billionaire, it's like, I don't know, like do you even notice losing one million here, a million there?

[49:00] I don't know. I mean, you know, a billion, a billion, a billion dollars is an unlimited amount of money.

[49:06] It's, yeah, but it's like a thousand million. I don't know. And then the interest you grow on. That's correct.

[49:14] Okay, so let's talk about the marketing strategy. You could be like Jeff Bezos and be getting divorced and there goes half of it.

[49:22] Right. Yeah, it's still not going to affect them.

[49:25] But let's talk about the marketing strategy to release a game called October Fest.

[49:31] That's like how many times you do have to get divorced and no longer be a billionaire?

[49:36] Right.

[49:38] I'm sorry. You say time on October Fest?

[49:40] Yeah. What's the strategy of launching a game called October Fest in the month of March?

[49:45] Didn't, did we talk about October Fest on the show after it was released? I can't remember.

[49:49] I don't know. I think we talked about whether the theme was good or not, but I think we did. I think we talked about the monkey, right?

[49:57] Yeah. I remember because I remember I was really curious to listen to your podcast when that show was released.

[50:03] I listened to that on a train in Portland. So I was on the train listening to your podcast.

[50:10] I'm going to Voodoo donuts to get a maple donut because I'm like, oh, I kind of know what Chris is to say about this.

[50:15] You're like on a train down the nowhere. That's when you put on Canadian spin ball podcast.

[50:19] So look, west side of Portland.

[50:21] Do you think, so they revealed that it expo? Do you think they're going to be able to get height back?

[50:26] Like, how do you get high back for that game?

[50:28] I've heard that it's mechanically a really cool game. I haven't played it. I didn't go to expo.

[50:33] I can overcome the theme.

[50:37] I don't, I think the theme is worse than people think it is. Is that making any sense?

[50:43] It's like, oh, this will be great for bars. It's like, you're right.

[50:47] Most of these pins are going to millionaires basements, you know, people are like, for every sunshine laundry,

[50:53] there's a hundred other locations that only want keymaster kitty gambling games.

[50:58] Right. But I don't get that notion of like, when I'm in a bar, it doesn't mean I want to be playing like Budweiser pinball.

[51:06] Yes, it's just like, you know, the pitch that everyone has heard.

[51:10] Oh, we should make an NFL pin because there's, you know, however many teams, and we can make a model for every team,

[51:17] and everybody loves football. You know what? As far as booze is concerned, I like drinking booze.

[51:22] You know, I don't care about a pinball machine based around booze.

[51:27] Although that taper arcade machine is pretty funny.

[51:30] So here's, here's, here's my thing. They should have made taper pinball.

[51:35] How would you translate that? Oh, you could shoot the targets, the targets.

[51:40] Exactly. Imagine that. Like they pop up and you have to like shoot them before they go down.

[51:47] Like it's like a beer. If you think about it, at least the video game taper, it's a game about booze or mountain dude,

[51:54] depending on the version or the root beer. But the game itself is set in a bar, and the idea of drinking is part of the game.

[52:02] Wait, wait, Ben, imagine this. Imagine like the artwork on the playfield of taper looks like, you know, three or four bars lined up going up the playfield.

[52:11] That's drawn. The target pops up and moves from left to right quickly and you have to shoot it before it goes over the edge.

[52:18] Oh, yeah. So basically you're shooting the glasses off the table. That would be really cool because it's like, oh, there's a target it's moving.

[52:27] I have to shoot that. And then you don't have to explain it.

[52:29] Difficult to change the speed as you get to later levels in the game.

[52:33] Or you have multiple targets. We just designed, we just, we just came up with a great concept for taper pinball,

[52:39] which is, and then you think about all the iconography, the emotional attachment people have to the taper arcade game is the same, you know, the same target you're going after with a 56 year old man who grew up with that game that they love.

[52:52] You know what game I think would be really, so I see these threads on pinside about there should be Zelda pinball, there should be Mario pinball or God of maybe left, there should be Fortnite pinball.

[53:02] It's like I just shake my head, but you know what would be, how about rampage? You have like three buildings in the play field and you hit targets and knock them down.

[53:11] That's it. Right. And then you change the lighting or change the buildings come back up and there did different height. Oh, that's a different city. Boom done.

[53:19] Yeah, I mean, look, I think that'd be cool. There is, there is a, there are, there have been attempts, right street fighter pinball. There's been attempts to.

[53:29] It should be, it should be a video game that can translate to the physics of pinball. Yeah, absolutely. Angry birds would have been amazing. People would have hated it, but it would have made sense. Street fighters that make sense. I think street fighters possibly the worst pinball machine I've ever played because it doesn't translate.

[53:46] I know, I know. Well, Fortnite, it's like, oh, I didn't know 12 year olds buy $7,000 toys. Right. Right. Right. No, I think you're right. I think you're right. So as you look at 2019 in pinball,

[53:58] you know, obviously the stern train keeps on a roll in. What do you think of monsters?

[54:04] I think the black and white looks amazing. And I think it's hilarious that people who want an ancient TV show theme are complaining about it. Right.

[54:15] I think these are the same show was in black and white. Right. These are the same people who won't watch and move with subtitles. I'm guessing.

[54:22] I know that sounds like crafts, but it's a black and white show. Right. Do you agree with Stern's decision to put the black and white as the premium and not the L.A. since it's such a unique approach?

[54:35] I'm sure, I'm sure there was a lot of thought put into it like how to basically kind of like, I don't want to say trick the customer.

[54:46] But I think they were being strategic about it because they're like, we have to sell our L.E.s because that's our cash cow.

[54:52] But if we put some controversial on it like black and white, it might not sell as well. So we'll put that one one, you know, one tear down so to speak. Right.

[55:02] I mean, you know, they make decisions like this. Like you play Deadpool, right? Unfortunately.

[55:07] You notice there's like a unicorn with a rainbow behind it, but the rainbow was miscolored. So it's not gay. Like every notice things like it's that's on the game.

[55:16] Well, I mean, all these decisions have been made. The only reason I say unfortunately with Deadpool, because I think George Gomez might listen to this podcast.

[55:24] The reason I say unfortunately is they just made a PG Deadpool game, which makes no sense to me.

[55:30] Well, we're going to get PG 13 Deadpool movies now that does Neon's Fox. I don't know though. And Disney's, you know, they've had R rated movies.

[55:37] Well, I just 30 years ago. I just, I just think, you know, Deadpool's a miss because of that and the humor is too PG. It doesn't really work.

[55:47] Well, just like comic books, nobody cares about comic books. I don't care. No one says nobody cares. It's all about the movies.

[55:53] So if you're talking, if you're talking Deadpool, people are thinking Ryan Reynolds and a bunch of sex jokes. So I would agree on that. And yeah, but even I played that game.

[56:02] I think actually Hilton has one on location and I was just kind of, I was struck even for PG rated humor. I was struck at just how badly it was written.

[56:11] I mean, honestly, it sounded like jokes from like a Nickelodeon show. I was kind of surprised. Like, oh, my trusty steed. And he's like on an inflatable horse. It's like, you could, you could

[56:22] have done better. It's like you hired, you hired Nolan North, right? And he's, he's saying this dialogue and oh, my God, I think it should have been better.

[56:32] I just don't know why they didn't give you an option to turn on an adult mode and just have the guy have a whole script over all those PG jokes with like our rated humor.

[56:43] So you know what we did on, on Rob Zombie, like Rob Zombie has a non adult mode or whatever. So if there's five different things that Rob Zombie says for an event, right?

[56:54] Like the first three RPG and the last two are, you know, have profanity. And all you do is you change the random number generator, right?

[57:03] You either say, okay, clip zero, one, two, if family mode or if not family mode extend the RNG range to zero, one, two, three, four, five.

[57:13] Right. So think about it. Yeah, you split it in half. And then you change the range of the random number generator for what he's going to say.

[57:19] Right. Well, I don't think Stern is going to give the people what they want, which was once an adult mode.

[57:26] In terms of, I'm trying to think who else is out there. So Dutch pinball is pretty much dead. We saw them come out this week and say, hey, everybody, here's the update. There is no update.

[57:37] When you're finally just going to call it quits.

[57:42] Well, highway eventually stopped, right? Yeah.

[57:48] I, you know, I find a guess what's happening with the, the DP thing is they realize once they finally say they're done, then they are done.

[57:58] Like, they'll never have a chance again. They're not job pop. They'll never have another chance to do this in the hobby. They'll be tainted, you know, they'll have to do something else for a living, right?

[58:08] You know, it's like, it's like Kevin Spacey, like, he'll never get to act again probably. And now, I guess he's going to have to go work in a brokerage firm or something.

[58:16] Maybe that's not the best, not the best analogy, but so the longer they, the longer they stay off admitting defeat.

[58:24] Right. I think it's more for their ego rather than their customers. And like, like you said in your last podcast, yeah, the people who bought for the games, they should be the ones decided because they are the investors, right?

[58:35] If it was a company, well, as you know, you have a board of directors and you have investors, and ultimately they're making the shots.

[58:43] Right. The problem with Dutch is when it comes to calling it quits, is there is nothing to call quits. There is no factory they are paying rent on. There are no employees, right?

[58:54] So they could, they could extensively keep this thing going forever, where highway, you know, they had fixed cost every month.

[59:04] Yeah. So as you say, they, they don't have to get money. They're not losing any more money anymore, Dutch. They're just, they're just nothing happening.

[59:14] Well, you know, it's, you know, where's the fucking money? La Bousske and you know, that is the ultimate I the quote from the day I movie haunts them forever.

[59:24] Well, you know, and the thing is those games that are at ARA, I still I think it's ridiculous. It's clear what happened. They underestimated whatever cost to make a game.

[59:34] ARA probably underestimated it as well. The cost of make the game is too high. The Dutch ran out of money. They couldn't pay the bills and therefore those games are in the warehouse. So those games like it or not, they do not belong to the buyers. They belong to ARA.

[59:48] It's Dutch's responsibility to generate the funds to buy those games to fulfill their customers needs.

[59:55] I agree that that is exactly what must have happened. And it would be like if Ford went on a business and I expected a steel mill to like give me a car.

[01:00:06] Right. And what's, what's so annoying is what they should have done when, when you know, ARA came clean and said, hey, like this is the first pinball game we've ever made. It was, it was actually like 6,500 versus 4,500 for each game.

[01:00:22] And then Dutch should have just and Dutch, you know, who also I think spent all the money traveling the world and do another.

[01:00:29] That expensive. Yeah, it is. People don't get it. Like shipping and pinball games not cheap and flying around to other shows around the world, flying international.

[01:00:38] Yeah, shipping shipping, shipping the pinball machine is more expensive than shipping a human.

[01:00:42] Right. Oh, and didn't they also like run out a pen house in the hotel? They didn't have like, oh yeah, it was, it was a great party. I went to it. It was fun.

[01:00:50] Didn't they grab the mic and say fuck Gary Stern? Yeah, they did. I wasn't at that speech, but I heard it was very very colorful.

[01:00:58] Prophane, yes. Well, and that's the thing. It's like, so what they should have done though, when they reached that impasse with ARA, they basically should have said, look, they should have been clean and honest with her and clear and said, here's what we're going to do.

[01:01:11] And this is like a little bit of a patron. ARA gave him a gave him a way out, but they didn't take it. Right. And they should, yeah, they wanted it.

[01:01:19] Because then they would have been done. Same thing. Or they should have said, look, here's, here's what we're going to do. We're, we're going to tell the pinball buyers and the community, the, the truth.

[01:01:31] And that is it costs more for us to create this company to manufacture your games. Here's what, here's the only way we can survive and get all games made.

[01:01:42] We're only going to make 500. The price now is 12,000, whatever, $500. And that's it. And, you know, and then the people could have, he's like, hey, here's the difference. Right. And you could have added another 4,000 to the mix. If you were,

[01:01:57] early a cheaper, look at how much they're flipping for. Like what? Like close to 20 grand. Yeah. So, and what have probably worked.

[01:02:05] I mean, when you look at games now, the big Lebowski looks like it's definitely equal value to a Jersey Jack pinball collectors edition, which sells for $12,500.

[01:02:19] Yeah, there's a lot of stuff in big, plus, you know, lower play field bowling alley games. Did that bowling alley see if I was involved, I think that that cost too much money. And it only does one thing.

[01:02:31] That's something that could have been removed, to be honest. It's cool. I always argue this would be what they get the coolest fucking thing just to look at.

[01:02:40] Yeah, but how cool is that when you, when your game costs more than, than you, than you sold it for?

[01:02:48] Look, you know, we talk about, but that's about Stern, I, Stern bombs, I talk about Stern bombs and, but hey, Stern's doing well.

[01:02:56] Then I'm being honest, if they said, look, and I'm just moving the numbers around a little bit, if they said we're only going to make 250 big Lebowski's ever there each.

[01:03:07] I mean, get ready for this 250 ever and they're each like $18,000. They sell everyone.

[01:03:14] These are million. 18 might be a bit high. But here's the thing. The other part of the market people failed to realize what rich people want is.

[01:03:26] They want to feel rich. Yeah, they want something that nobody else has a world only class. Right. They want to feel exclusive. They want to feel like it's never going to happen again. And I got one. What, what game?

[01:03:37] Yeah, but that's that same person. They're still, if they're a Disney world and they see a bottle of water seven dollars, they're still going to be like, Jesus Christ, seven dollars for bottle of water.

[01:03:45] Yeah. And you don't get rich by, by overpaying for stuff, right? But, but here's the thing. The real lot of, a lot of rich people are the most frugal people you'll come across.

[01:03:53] Yeah, warm buffered drives like this. Shitty as car. Here's the thing, but the game was good. And the game was was being heralded. And I think they could have got away with it because the product was in demand.

[01:04:06] It didn't feel like it was, it didn't feel like they were ripping people off the way.

[01:04:10] But again, you know, they, you know, as, as you talked about with George Gomez, they had contract manufacturing, which means they're ultimately at their mercy.

[01:04:18] Like, so would spooky if Charlie had to go in and stay overnight with a screwdriver and finish the game, he could.

[01:04:24] You don't have that control the contract manufacturer. Right. Okay. So Dutch, I think Dutch is done. I, I think that the Bowskies will always trade on the second hand market.

[01:04:35] Also building it in Europe is probably not the best idea. I mean, there's people who say that building a pinball in America is stupid. And it's even more expensive to do in Europe. So.

[01:04:43] Right. Like you say, like, yes, someone like American pinball should scoop that up.

[01:04:49] Well, I have to clarify to that a. R. A. is actually in the Netherlands. I incorrectly said it wasn't sweet in.

[01:04:56] Oh, yeah, that's right. So I want to clarify. I could just be like a typical American.

[01:05:02] It's the distance from the Netherlands. It's the same country. It's all Scandinavia.

[01:05:07] Yeah. Yeah. A bunch of Euro people that speak in French. Right. Right. Well, Ben, what do you, what do you think just broadly? Then I'll let you go. Like 2019 and pinball. Do you think it's going to be a great year for pinball?

[01:05:20] Do you think it's going to be an oversaturated year? Well, you know, we keep thinking that they're going to hit peak pinball. But I guess it hasn't happened yet.

[01:05:30] I think they're definitely flirting with the price ceiling. And I think we saw this recently. Apple found the price ceiling not so long ago.

[01:05:39] And you know, Stern and other companies could could find it as well.

[01:05:44] Yeah. And I guess we know once they find the price ceiling, it's about seeing how much they can sustain it at that range. But going back to the customers.

[01:05:53] I mean, this is another thing I'll get me kicked in the balls. You have the ultimate customer. They're rich. They have the patience of job. And they have very low standards.

[01:06:03] As long as it looks good. It doesn't seem like it's that hard to make them happy. Again, I share that to like the video you play video games, right? I mean, the video game industry. It's customers are just assholes.

[01:06:16] Like, well, because the customer bases everybody, they're not rich. They didn't know it is like the world. You know, EA can spend $100 million making a game that they sell for 60 bucks.

[01:06:28] But if that campaign's not six hours long, Lord help them, right? Versus pinball where you can shift an incomplete game and not finish the code for two years. And people are fine with it. As long as it looks good in their basement.

[01:06:40] I think making money in pinball is really easy. If you just don't try to do too much and do what exactly what you did, give people a sexy game built on a theme they love and just make short works. And they will say take my money now.

[01:06:55] Well, the real I mean manufacturing is that's the main issue and Stern has been doing you know, they've got that down. They've been doing it for like what?

[01:07:02] 32 years now. That's why they're doing really great because they're the best people that maintaining supply chain and getting the games out the door. And you know, it's like it's like Apple.

[01:07:13] It's like, hey, months is the game and it's already on the boat. You know, heading to Europe.

[01:07:18] Yeah, I think it's really hard to ever compete at volume in the industry with Stern in it because it is such a niche market.

[01:07:25] And so you've got this humongous company that's got production and manufacturing down. I just think the I do. I think the only white space left is is to be a medium boutique sized company.

[01:07:38] You mean the blue ocean strategy.

[01:07:41] Well, I'm just not sure like and I always say this like who is the rolls Royce of pinball right now.

[01:07:49] Probably J.J.P.

[01:07:51] Right, but why does Jack always find himself like losing money or struggling to get these games in demand?

[01:07:58] I bet. Well, I'm sure Rolls Royce makes less money than Chevy or Ford.

[01:08:03] Right, but I'd also say that where Jack falls down is a few areas. I think he falls down and he his Ellie model is ridiculously flawed, right?

[01:08:15] And he for some reason he just can't even just copy Stern. He's he's always doing it weird.

[01:08:21] So if you think about Rolls Royce, they don't make many games, right?

[01:08:25] So you can't try Jack's trying to sell as many games as Stern does, right?

[01:08:31] But I see Stern is more like Toyota.

[01:08:34] And and so like if Jack wants to be the rolls Royce, then he's you know you're making carguments.

[01:08:41] I know, I know, but that's my thing with Jack is like he does his games. There's so much more in them.

[01:08:47] And I look at him charging the same amount of money as Stern. And Jack also is trying to make games for location and redemption game.

[01:08:56] It's like, what are you doing man? You're you're making a high end collectible for a rich person.

[01:09:04] But he can't figure out the strategy on how to like market that.

[01:09:10] Yeah, I mean, I think it's going to come down to theme. I mean, I think part of the problem with the Hobbit is, you know, the movies were rushed into production.

[01:09:18] They weren't that good. I think that ultimately affects it.

[01:09:22] One might say that about I use the Caribbean.

[01:09:24] But here's thing, then. It's like if I get in a board room with Jersey Jack and his marketing team, which I think is his daughter.

[01:09:31] And I don't know who else is over there who makes these calls the investor.

[01:09:35] Okay, who's our target? Okay, we're going to we're going to go well above Stern in terms of like material and bomb and innovation.

[01:09:42] All right, so I need a guy who's like willing to spend like 10 to 15,000 dollars.

[01:09:48] You know the kinds of guys that were buying all the medieval manaces and the monster bashes that were restored by high and pinball, you know, like six, seven years ago.

[01:09:55] You know, kind of guys, John Papaduke attract it, right?

[01:09:58] John Papaduke sold magic girl, site unseen for 16,000 dollars sold out in one day.

[01:10:08] Yeah, okay. Okay. So if I'm Jack, I'm like, look, I need a strategy here.

[01:10:14] Like, why am I going to try and beat Stern on buying? Why don't I just make a company that's very profitable by making a few hundred, very high end boutique.

[01:10:24] boutique games where everyone who like, and then I scale to that.

[01:10:29] And I don't set the thing as I just think like they scaled up, but they haven't given the people what they want.

[01:10:35] But I'll say this if they do get wonka and toy story out and the games are great, then I think you'll see that factory running like it's never run before in terms of like orders and the line will keep moving for a long, long time without.

[01:10:51] Yeah, I actually think Willy Wonka is a better theme than toy story just for the demographic.

[01:10:58] Although I'm surprised how many 45 year old men want toy story as a pinball team at whatever.

[01:11:03] Yeah, I mean, they're both great. They're both great. I mean, I love toy story. I think toy story gets you more female,

[01:11:11] wives or into it a little bit more than Willy Wonka. Yeah, Wonka is great. If it is great, Wonka has, you know, another 20 years of pedigree associated with it.

[01:11:23] But toy stories never had a bad movie. You know, when I did the, in Wonka, my concern with toy story is they're not going to get the assets they need to have like the actors from the movie, but with Wonka they will.

[01:11:35] And I think that's going to make a difference. Yeah, unless we forget Apollo 13 with the Kevin Bacon billpax and then the third astronaut at his son visor down.

[01:11:46] Because he couldn't you can't, can't show Tom Hanks. Right. The pinball. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Well, Ben, thank you so much for taking the time.

[01:11:55] No, it doesn't, doesn't Tom Hanks's brother do like voices for his brother? Yeah, he's like, I think he's, yeah, I think Tom Hanks's brother is like a Tom Hanks voice actor, which is like impersonator. Is that the right word? I don't even know. Yeah, yeah, something like that. So that probably fine. Yes, I think he did all like the like the toy story toys.

[01:12:16] Because that's always like when you buy a toy story toy the voice and it is not Tim Owens or Tom Hanks. It's similar, but it should be okay.

[01:12:25] As long as they started similar unlike the stern Avengers game. Yeah, no, it's for what about what about like Guardians of the Galaxy or is all like redone? It was like, oh, but the boobie.

[01:12:36] He's only played that game twice and it was always in noisy environments. So yeah, I think what time is the Sunshine laundry actually? Yeah. Well, Ben,

[01:12:44] any final words to the listeners of Canadian Spinball podcast? Any any recommendation on who they should vote for in the Twippies?

[01:12:54] Oh, well, I'm not going to give like, you know, do any political grandstands as far as voting in the Twippies. I'm not even going to say go out and vote because, you know, you don't have to.

[01:13:05] Final, I don't know. I think I'd like to see some cool stuff from Ben Ball. I think I'm very curious to see what Deeproot will do. Actually, I don't think they'll have anything at Texas. I would disagree with you on that.

[01:13:18] So I'm here to confirm that you are right because I actually heard from through the grapevine that that's not happening because there are some personal celebrations happening within that Deeproot world that are going to forbid them from being a T.P.F.

[01:13:34] So you heard it here first. I'm going to be wrong. They're not going to be there, but it's not because they don't have stuff ready. It's for some other reason that you can just guess.

[01:13:44] Okay. Yeah. I mean, are you going to be any shows for fans of the show who love you, Ben? Where are you going to be next in the pinball world?

[01:13:53] I actually don't have any plans at the moment to be at any video game or pinball shows. As I mentioned, part of my semi-retirement was dialing way back on that because I used to do it far too much.

[01:14:04] Right. Now, you are, are you going to be in New York soon? Yes. Next month, I'm going to be visiting.

[01:14:10] Okay. So why don't we do this for I plan to grab a beer with Ben and I'm sure we'll find a place to play some pinball.

[01:14:17] If you want to see Mr. Ben Heck, why don't you email me at canadapimbalagemail.com and maybe we'll get a little group together because I need all the protection I can get because apparently the New York pinball scene just wants to kick my ass after my shenanigans last year at the New York City pinball tournament.

[01:14:32] So I need I need all the backup I can get. I did sound kind of KG, but it was bad. It would happen again. I saw this year. They're at the same venue.

[01:14:44] It'll be a good show. I won't be there disrupting the tournament. So if you're planning to go, don't worry. Can it is not going to start flinging drinks left and right.

[01:14:55] Hopefully not.

[01:14:57] Ben, well, thank you again. Always appreciate your time. Always appreciate your passion, your enthusiasm and your candor in the pinball world. I think the listeners appreciate it as well.

[01:15:09] Alright, well I better get back on pinside and start whining about things. Alright, well thank you Ben. Yeah, no problem.
