[00:00] Never thought I could feel this way and I've got to say that I just don't get it.

[00:07] I don't know where we went from but the feelings gone and I just can't get it back.

[00:21] Welcome to episode 317 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast that you know

[00:28] your wife also listens to. So guys, I feel really, really excited to talk to you about this

[00:34] edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast. On this show, I'm going to give you the Canada insider info

[00:41] that I've been teasing you with. You know me. I'm just going to say everything I know about

[00:45] Stern's 2019 release plans. I'm just going to put it all in one show. This way you don't have to

[00:51] come back and hope I do a little bit at a time. You're going to get it all in this show at the end.

[00:56] So I hope you listen to it. But before I do that, I want to tell you about a kind of crazy

[01:01] night I had last night. I almost felt like I died and went to pinball heaven. So let me start at

[01:07] sort of the end of the night. Canada is on the ground, blacked out, blacked out, and I come through.

[01:14] And what do I see? I see a row of pinball machines in this beautiful New York City law department.

[01:21] I see Ben Heck on a TNA having the time of his life. I see another guy saying, Hey,

[01:27] canada, are you Chris? Are you all right? You're right, man. You fell down. And right in that moment,

[01:32] I thought I might have been in pinball heaven. But then I also saw a perhaps blue ribbon machine

[01:37] to my left. And I realized if I had died and gone to pinball heaven, there probably wouldn't be a

[01:43] PBR machine. But that's what happened to me. I blacked out and came through. And probably

[01:50] the coolest pinball setup apartment game room I have ever been in. I want to thank my friend

[01:57] Adam in New York City for inviting Ben and I to come over and enjoy his incredible collection

[02:02] there. I hope it's the first of many great nights we have inside the apartment. But canada couldn't

[02:08] handle it. I was probably 48 hours on lack of sleep. I had I got sick the night before. I'd been

[02:15] in Minneapolis on a new business pitch. And I was tired. But I went right from the airport

[02:21] to Adams. And we were partying. And all of a sudden I went to walk about 30 feet. And then that

[02:28] was it lights out. I don't even know what happened until I woke up. And then there's a picture of me

[02:34] lying on the ground pillow under my head. These guys did a great job of nursing me back to life.

[02:41] There was about a two hour period in which every other pinball podcast had the advantage. But I

[02:47] came back for you the listener of the show. But I will make that photo the the picture of this

[02:54] podcast. If you look at it, you can kind of see in my face. I'm looking up almost dreaming of

[02:59] what it would be like if we finally got the Ghostbusters code update we've been waiting for.

[03:04] So that was last night. Incredible time. Adam. Thank you so much. Ben HECK always a pleasure to see

[03:09] you out in about I love this guy. I love passionate pinball people. I'll talk a little bit about

[03:16] what it's like to play a bunch of games. And Adam has a great line of games. He's got the Beatles. He's

[03:21] got Paps Blue Ribbon. He's got Iron Maiden Ellie. He's got a Deadpool Ellie. He's got a Beatles. Did I

[03:27] say Beatles already? He's got a T2. He's got a TNA. What else is there here? I'm missing something.

[03:34] I'm missing a few games. It's okay. He's got a walking dead Ellie. He's got a Metallica Ellie.

[03:39] And the games are beautiful. I mean, beautiful condition. Everything is gorgeous. I want to say this.

[03:45] It is really cool when you do have a variety of games in which each game is different. Each game

[03:50] sort of complements the other game. I won't lie to you. I wish I had room for more games because I

[03:56] would love to have a few more of those games in a lineup myself. Now, here's the part that really

[04:03] surprised me. The game that we had a lot of fun on. The game that we played first. The game that

[04:09] sort of pulled us in as we were just partying and having a good time was the Beatles. And the Beatles

[04:16] is a game that when it came out, right, we all sort of lost our shit because of the pricing of the

[04:20] game. But the Beatles really is a great game to play with people. It is a lot of fun. Adam has a

[04:28] platinum edition of the game. And it's such a good game for a group of people to jump on immediately.

[04:34] And I'll explain why. Not only is it beautiful to look at, it sounds great, but it's easy to explain

[04:40] the people what to do. And I think that's something that TNA also has. These two games are very similar

[04:47] in the sense that you can stand over them and explain to people what to shoot for. And then right

[04:52] away, you're in it. You're playing it. You're having a good time. You know exactly what you need to

[04:55] shoot for. You understand in the Beatles, like which song equals which shot objectives. And then

[05:01] you're off going to do it. I also like that in the Beatles game. The scoring isn't like one

[05:08] billion and 700 million. You know, it's much more realistic scoring. And I think that also helps

[05:14] as you're tracking your progress against the other players. But great light show in the game

[05:18] really surprised me. It really did surprise me how much fun the Beatles was. Right. You know,

[05:23] and TNA similarly, we had just so much fun on that game. So lots to be said for simple fun and

[05:30] pinball, it seems like. And I do hope to get more times on a lot of these machines. And so

[05:36] you're going to see a canada playing games a lot more. Hopefully so you guys will get

[05:41] different opinions about these games. Now that being said, whenever I asked you're going to get

[05:45] a monster is like, no man, no monsters. But there is a two monsters, Ellie's were actually

[05:52] delivered to Sunshine Laundromat in Brooklyn. I never understand why they buy two. Why would you buy

[06:00] two games for the I don't I don't get that. But Peter is kind of crazy. He does stuff like that.

[06:05] He has like cactus canyon games in the window in direct sunlight at Sunshine. It's crazy to me.

[06:12] How much he just puts these rare games. He has a Beatles. I think he has a Beatles diamond

[06:18] edition. I want to say he has a diamond edition Beatles out on location for play. Why would you do

[06:24] that? Why wouldn't you just put a Beatles gold. It's the same exact game. And he has all those

[06:29] games right next to each other. So there's absolutely no point in putting that the more

[06:34] highly sought after collectible version again, jammed up against another pin. So that was my night.

[06:42] That was my night. And it was kind of crazy. It was kind of awesome. The one benefit is I got to

[06:48] wake up and my head was still hurting. I must have hit my head pretty hard. I didn't feel it at first.

[06:53] But it is kind of scary when you wake up and your mind is somewhere, but your body won't respond.

[06:59] And it was I was a little scared. And I almost felt more embarrassed for them to have to watch me

[07:05] sort of be on the ground like a dead man. Canate it down. Canate it out. No, but we're back. And we're

[07:10] back and we're doing the show this morning. And I dedicate this show to Adam and Ben for such a great

[07:15] night. Now what are we going to talk about before we get to the Stern 2019 plans? I know that's

[07:20] what you guys all want to hear. Let's do a little housekeeping. And then we'll get to that.

[07:24] Something I saw this interesting thread on Pinside. I wanted to to touch base on it.

[07:29] Some guy wrote what if anything to say to a significant other? And this is from Pinside user.

[07:37] Holman, Holman one, I don't know. He's from Walnut Creek, California. Long story short,

[07:44] I don't want to read the whole thing. He loves Pimbal. He has a dialed in Pimbal machine

[07:50] that he loves. His wife is always grilling him about it, making fun of him for owning it.

[07:56] And he said that they had a dinner party. And another couple came over and they were all talking,

[08:02] having wine, having a great night. Later in the evening, they get to talking about Pimbal.

[08:08] And his friend sees the game and his eyes light up like a kid in a candy store. And all four of

[08:14] them start playing dialed in Ellie and are having a good time. And then his wife starts

[08:20] crapping on the game, making fun of it. And he's basically saying it put a dark cloud over

[08:26] the entire experience. And he said other than her hate of Pimbal, she's absolutely an amazing

[08:32] wife. And his question to the community is, what would you do? What would you say if your wife

[08:38] was doing that? And what would you do? Listen to the show. I'm curious. So here's what I would do.

[08:45] I just wouldn't let my wife, which is now Brenda, insult something that I enjoyed. Because I

[08:52] think it's disrespectful to crap on something that your significant other is really into and

[08:58] passionate about. And I can tell you, when that happens, it does create division within a

[09:04] relationship. And in life, we should end up with people who support the things we love,

[09:10] especially things that are innocuous and like Pimbal. I mean, there's absolutely nothing

[09:19] wrong with loving Pimbal. It's not like you're asking her to get into something that's

[09:25] bad or can't tankerous or you know what I'm talking about. People can be into all sorts of weird

[09:33] shit. But being in a Pimbal is not that strange. I will say this though, there are a lot of

[09:39] people out there that look at grown men who are still in the toys and sort of in this arrested

[09:44] state of development. And they roll their eyes at us. I think men in general get a bad rap. And I

[09:51] heard this from some one of my senior leaders in this week. She's amazing. She is a high up in my

[09:57] company. And when we were talking about nostalgia, she's sort of like, I don't like nostalgia. It's

[10:02] just like grown men who just refuse to grow up. It's like this longing for the past. And I kind

[10:06] of was like, yeah, that's true. But it's also why we love to be nostalgic about stuff. Because I

[10:12] think for a lot of men out there, the period of your childhood was an awesome one. It was a

[10:19] period of when you played a lot. You used your imagination a lot. You played with toys. You had

[10:24] skateboard. You had BMX bikes. You had arcade games. You had Pimbal machines. You had Saturday

[10:29] morning cartoons. You had gaming councils that were so exciting to own every time there was

[10:34] like a new council that came out. You sort of witnessed the graphics getting better and better

[10:40] every few years. I feel like nowadays there's nothing quite like that anymore. There's not that

[10:46] surprise into light. And the internet has ruined kind of everything for all of us. Even though

[10:51] it's connected us, it's sort of made everybody really jaded. And sort of, I don't know, the imagination

[10:58] that we used to have is gone. And kids don't play like they used to. We all know that. And so I

[11:03] think for a lot of us, we look back at that time with with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of longing

[11:12] to get back to that sort of simplicity. And I think for for us grown adults now, creating an

[11:18] environment that feels like that, that recreates that feeling is cool. I would never look at that

[11:24] with negativity. There's no denying the fact that the 80s and 90s, while not perfect, I think were

[11:31] a very enjoyable time to live in. And especially to grow up in, I can't imagine growing up as a kid

[11:38] today. I just couldn't. And with staring at social media and all these loser influencers,

[11:44] people with no talent, making millions of dollars, shallow vein people everywhere, just bragging

[11:51] about what they're doing on social media. And no one's really in the moment. It's pathetic.

[11:56] It is so pathetic. What I like about pinball, what I like about growing up with street fighter,

[12:02] I like that you actually had skills like people, people with skills actually had a following now.

[12:07] That's not to say that there's not people on Twitch with crazy Fortnite skills, making millions of

[12:11] dollars because there is. And that's fine with me. I'd rather you geek out watching Ninja play Fortnite.

[12:17] At least the guy's got talent. And there's a reason why he makes money. He has talent. But these

[12:22] influencers who are just like, look at me. Look how pretty I am. And hundreds of thousands of people

[12:27] follow these main people. I don't get it. Anyway, all right. So I would just tell your wife,

[12:33] please love what I love and don't make fun of it. And let's move on. All right. So what else is going

[12:37] on in pinball? So American pinball, it wasn't that thread the other day. And it seems like they're

[12:43] getting ready for October fest is big re reveal at Texas pinball festival. They're working on the

[12:50] code. I believe they've adjusted some of the shots from what I can tell a few of the games are out

[12:57] there being beta tested ferret who I believe ferret was a coder for highway pinball. He is working

[13:03] with Josh Kugler on the code. So they are putting the final finishing touches on this game

[13:11] to get it ready. Now TPS is going to be a big moment for them. This is going to be the time when

[13:17] people can jump on the machine and make up their mind and whether or not October fest is right for

[13:23] them. It's hard to tell unless you play it. And that's all we're going to say. We're not we,

[13:27] you know how we feel about the theme. There's definitely work to be done on the artwork. We'll see

[13:33] what the final package is. I look forward to playing it. I also look forward to getting Josh on the show

[13:39] post TPS as he said he would. All right. All right. What else is going on in pinball? There's not too

[13:44] much, right? There's not too much. But at Jersey Jack pinball they have a new customer. So ice man.

[13:51] He was in on a collector's edition. He was out on a collector's edition. He saw the latest

[13:56] stream they did. I believe it was on Valentine's Day with Jack Danger. That stream alone led him

[14:03] to order a collector's edition pirate to the Caribbean. And I want to say that's good. You know,

[14:09] great. I think when people watch a stream and they see the game play and they understand it better

[14:14] and they want to go in and get a pirates now's the time to grab one because there are not going to

[14:19] be that many pirates of the Caribbean's available come April. We know that March is the final

[14:26] production date for that game. I still am on the fence about whether or not I need to believe people

[14:32] who tell me it's the greatest game of all time. If it was the greatest pinball machine of all time

[14:38] just ask yourself one question. Why would they stop making it then? You know, it just, you know,

[14:44] I have to I have to go off of the data and the insights I have and the reality of the situation.

[14:51] I get that you guys love it. But there is no way the greatest pinball machine of all time

[14:57] would cease production. And then all these other people are failing to see what you see. You know,

[15:03] I when I asked Ben Heck last night, how is pirates at Sunshine Laundromat? And the first thing he said

[15:09] to me, game wasn't working right. Something wrong with the flippers and the the the shooter lane was

[15:15] like off center. So it wasn't plunging the ball properly. And there you go again. You know,

[15:20] it's a great game when it's working. But there are just so many instances where these games just

[15:25] don't work right. And especially on location Jersey Jack games seem to be a handful for for people.

[15:32] All right. So what else is going on? So all right. So here's the thing before I get into Stern,

[15:39] is there anything else I want to talk about? You know what? I'm going to leave Stern 2019 plans

[15:44] until the end. And I'm going to read some emails first. And then I will get to it. All right. How's

[15:49] that sound on episode 317 of Canada's pinball podcast? Just pulling up my emails. One second

[15:56] gentleman. All right. All right. I'm going to start here. Episode 316 from Jeff S. He writes

[16:02] Canada. Your loyalty program episode had me stop in my tracks a few times. First, I thought

[16:10] the Canada plan was real. I was actually thinking it would work and wanted to suggest raising your

[16:16] price to $100. Then I learned it was a joke and that Stern has started a new program. I'm on the

[16:23] edge of seat awaiting details as you describe and comment on each feature. Finally, you announced

[16:30] your program will now be free and suggest it should be free for other sites. That makes sense.

[16:37] Why charge people to learn something sooner? This topic was a roller coaster of fun. He then

[16:43] goes on to say, you are still off base on pirates and will probably change your mind after playing one.

[16:50] I boldly predict you will buy a Jersey Jack Pirates of the Caribbean's or GNR this year 2019. All

[16:57] right Jeff, let me tell you right now. Okay. I'm just going to make this a known proclamation.

[17:03] I will never buy a pirate to the Caribbean pinball machine. Never, ever, ever. And it's not because I

[17:10] don't think you love it. It's not because I don't think the pin is great. I don't like the theme at all.

[17:17] And this is something that I don't think people really understand the importance of theme and pinball.

[17:22] For some people, it might not be that much. But for others like me, especially because I have very

[17:27] limited room, I don't want to own something that doesn't bring me happiness even when I see it turned

[17:34] off. And there is nothing about the pirates of the Caribbean franchise that makes me want to

[17:39] own one. Okay. And that's that. And I think the power of theme is so important. And it doesn't

[17:47] just mean it has to be a license theme. Here's the thing. There are plenty of license themes that

[17:53] don't turn me off that I'm open-minded about exploring. For example, I'm not the biggest iron

[18:01] maiden fan, but I'm open to exploring an iron maiden pinball machine. I kind of have to be honest

[18:08] when I say I sort of hate the pirates of the Caribbean movies. I think the first one was good

[18:15] so many years ago, but recently they were so bad that they turned me off. And I think if you have

[18:22] a theme that just turns you off, you're not going to want to own it. All right. Jeff goes on to say

[18:28] what you can't tell without standing in front of pirates is one. How immersive the game is.

[18:34] Two, how easy it is to understand your progress. Just reading inserts, matching lip insert colors

[18:41] and looking on the main screen. Number three, that the pin is based on the franchise layout,

[18:47] art, sculpts, sounds, and cabinet art. And it feels like it. That's not a bad thing. You prefer it

[18:53] to have likenesses and voices and it doesn't. It is still a pirate to the Caribbean pin that is

[18:59] done in a tasteful way. Four, how painless and fun it is to learn the characters. You'll soon have

[19:06] a few favorites, but it's not stressful to pick one you've never tried. Five, how challenging it

[19:12] is to collect gold. Six, how good the bottom of playfield is. Seven, how useful the upper flipper is

[19:21] to making five shots. Eight, how easy it is to start multi balls. Nine, how well the game keeps

[19:26] and displays scores. If we're like, if we're now applauding games for the fact that you can actually

[19:33] see the score, we're we're in for a ride people. Number 10, how deep the code is. Number 11, how broad

[19:39] the game is. Number 12, how fun it is to blow up the don'tless with cannonball. Number 13, how fun it

[19:44] is to plunder from opponents. Lots of things to make this game greatest of all time. Overall,

[19:51] I have a general idea of what I want to do when I step up, but playing soon results in a mix of

[19:56] planning, reacting and avoiding exciting say hi to Brendan Bubba. All right, so here's the thing,

[20:02] Jeff. You just give me 13 reasons why I should love pirates to Caribbean. I don't want anyone to

[20:09] ever have to tell me there are 13 reasons why it's the greatest of all time. I think a pinball

[20:15] machine should be more easy to get into. And I look forward to playing it. This game, it just,

[20:22] it hangs over this podcast like a black cloud. I don't think people are going to stop until I change

[20:28] my mind on Pirate to the Caribbean. Now that being said, in a week or so, I think it's next weekend,

[20:34] I'm going to go play Pirate to the Caribbean at Sunshine with someone who's going to show me the

[20:39] game. Will my mind change on this game when I play it? We shall see. All right, that's that's

[20:45] all I'm going to say on pirates. All right. I got an email from from cam. You know, I played his

[20:52] audio clip in which he talked about kids and pinball. He said, Hey, Chris, thanks for your response

[20:58] today. And while I get that millions of kids are playing Fortnite and L O L type games and not

[21:05] nearly as many playing pinball, I'm still sticking to my opinion that there will be plenty

[21:11] each year for decades to come that will be buying and playing pinball machines just as it's been

[21:17] for the past several decades. We'll have to tickle the issue for podcast number 9,025, 30 years from

[21:24] now to see if I'm right. All right. Well, we'll see. There's no way pinball buyers will continue to

[21:30] increase or stay at this level in the future. There's just no way. There is no way it is wishful

[21:35] thinking. I think pinball has another five years left before we start to see a real decrease in

[21:42] demand. There's just going to be so many games out there that at some point you're going to run

[21:48] out of themes and you're going to have oversaturation of games. And we're going to all realize that

[21:55] maybe we don't, you know, I think you're just going to run out of all those things. They're going

[21:59] to combine to just make it so people will get, I don't know, fatigued with constantly going in on

[22:07] new games. It's also just going to be super hard for manufacturers to make a profit with so much

[22:11] out there. And when they use pinball market really becomes more attractive. Why would you go

[22:16] buy the new stuff when all these beautiful games in collectors homes go up for sale and you're

[22:21] saving thousands of dollars? I got an email from Dave Whitting. You remember CEO Dave, our SWAT

[22:27] session guy says, Hey, Chris, sorry for being so slow to respond. As I think I mentioned, he's

[22:32] in the process of doing something with his business. So he said, I'd love to do another SWAT with you.

[22:37] Maybe this weekend or next weekend PS. That was a pretty damn impressive ad that you did with Stella

[22:44] given your position in the industry. I can't believe the pinball companies are not banging down

[22:50] your door for marketing help. Well, Dave, we all know why. They all just think they know how to do it.

[22:55] They also think that they don't need to market. And look, Stern doesn't really need my help.

[23:00] Everyone else could use a little help on how to get these games to market. And my advice is always

[23:05] open for anyone who needs it. But I can't help games like the team pinballs, the mafia. That's where I

[23:12] draw the line. All right. And Dave, we'll do it soon. We will do it soon. I got an email from

[23:18] Helling frequencies. Stern themes stuck in the 60s. Hey, canada, I was thinking about Stern's

[23:24] themes lately. And the rumored themes ahead. And it seems like there is an infatuation with themes

[23:31] from the 60s, which I think may be leaving buyers in the dust. First, we had Batman 66, a theme that

[23:37] was heavily championed by Lyman Sheets. But also a show syndicated through reruns based on a

[23:44] version of the Batman IP that is in a bit of a renaissance with ongoing comic books and movies.

[23:50] Most recently, we had Beatles based on the 1964 incarnation of the band. I feel like the buzz for

[23:56] this particular era of Beatles has cooled as we get further away from that moment in time. Finally,

[24:03] the monsters, another show that aired in the 60s. John Borg has gone on record saying he really

[24:08] pushed for this theme. Looking ahead, there are some more titles coming that may be from the same

[24:15] error. Toho Godzilla, James Bond, I understand that there is an aging pinball market that is an

[24:21] nostalgic for themes from this time period. But I also feel like there is a group of 30 to 40

[24:27] some things just getting to their midlife crisis disposable income years that are getting left behind.

[24:34] Working in marketing, you probably see that 80s and 90s nostalgia is hot right now.

[24:39] So why are we stuck in the 60s? Do you think there are factors internally at Stern that are

[24:45] pushing for these older themes? Does Stern need younger blood in house to help push for more relevant

[24:50] themes? Or do you think they should stick with the 60s and over crowd? Best RD? Well, first of all,

[24:57] thank you for the note. I would love to address this right now. Here's the thing. The assets from

[25:03] the shows from the 60s are plentiful when you let licensed those IPs because the actors back then

[25:11] did not have the rights. You didn't have to sign the rights for each individual actor. So that when

[25:17] you licensed the IP, the studio owned everything. So I think that's one reason why Stern looks at these

[25:23] older themes with bright eyes because when you do Batman 66, when you do the monsters, you see how

[25:31] you can give us everything we want and everything we remember from those TV shows because Stern's

[25:37] licensing agreement gives you everything and they just have to license it once from the studio. They

[25:42] don't have to go back and license each individual actor. That gets a lot harder with more modern

[25:48] themes. Even stuff from the 80s and 90s, you know, not the contract started to be more difficult

[25:55] if you want to secure everything from the license. Now that being said, I still think the 80s

[26:01] is the prime decade to go back to if you want to get the mass audiences in. Stuff like Ghostbusters,

[26:09] stuff like Goonies, stuff like Back to the Future will Trump stuff like Monsters and Batman 66 without

[26:17] a doubt. Okay. So I think anything from like late 70s, early 80s into 90s, I think is Pimball

[26:26] Marketing Gold and I'm surprised we're not seeing more from that era and I hope we do.

[26:32] I still wish Ghostbusters could be remade. I am also hearing something about Alien and I know

[26:39] Fox is shopping around to have another Pimball company make a better version of Alien and I've

[26:44] heard that rumor many times and I think we're going to see Alien be remade by a new Pimball company

[26:52] because they are not happy over at Fox with what happened with Highway Pimball. But I would love

[26:57] to see a lot more themes from the 80s and 90s for sure and I think the sales would also be

[27:03] much better. Let's see what deep route has because we know they secured an 80s theme. All right,

[27:09] I got an email from, let's see, do, do, do, do, do, do, Joe and a Gale. He just said just wanted to

[27:15] say, uh, Johan, Johan, sorry, Johan Gale just wanted to say rock on best Pimball podcast this

[27:24] century cheers from Sweden. Well, my brother from Sweden, thank you so much for listening to the show.

[27:30] I'm glad you enjoy it and I'm glad that we're the best Pimball podcast of the century. Who knows?

[27:36] Who knows 100 years from now. Will anyone ever be able to match of Canadian Pimball podcast?

[27:43] I got an email from, let's see Jeff S. He said, Pirate to the Caribbean open invite. Chris, I bought

[27:52] Pirate to the Caribbean and have had it for four days. Wow, I wish I could show you my game.

[27:57] No boring 30 minute tutorial planned. A five minute overview followed by an hour hands-on

[28:03] four player game. When you graduate, you will see how great this pin would look and work sitting

[28:11] behind or sorry, sitting beside your Batman super alley and you will learn to accept Pirate to

[28:16] the Caribbean as a decent and non offensive theme that makes you want to play it. When is,

[28:21] when the next time he says next time you come to Atlanta, come down and we'll hang out. Awesome.

[28:25] Well, Jeff, thank you again. This seems to be the game that everyone wants me to love. I'm going to

[28:29] do my best to keep an open mind next week when I play it with someone who knows how to show me the

[28:35] rules and what is going on in that game. All right, anything else going on in Pimball that I want

[28:41] to mention, something that's interesting as we go into Stern 2019. Before I do that, I want to

[28:46] tell you guys if you own a PAPS Blue Ribbon Machine, you know it's cool about it. You can download

[28:52] the code from Primus Pimball and you can upload into PBR the entire Primus code that is out there

[29:00] and available and guess what? It transforms your PBR into Primus Pimball. It is fun. You can

[29:08] actually have a Primus game without having to pay Primus a dime because the code is exactly the

[29:14] same. It's because it's the same exact game as Primus, same switches, same everything. So that's

[29:20] a way to cheat and actually own Primus without having to buy Primus. All the music's there. I played

[29:27] one that had it like that. It's super, super awesome sort of way to sort of game the system over at

[29:32] Stern. All right, so here we are. Half hour into the show. I'm still a little, I don't know if you can

[29:38] tell. I'm a little woozy from my fall last night and maybe that's why I've decided to wake up

[29:44] and just give you what I know about Stern Pimball's 2019 plans. Okay, and now some of this is rumor.

[29:52] Some of this is as good as fact and all of this I'm hearing from very reliable sources so you can

[29:59] take it with a grain of salt or you can run to Pinside and take credit for it but this is what I

[30:05] know. It's okay. So get your pen and paper ready. Other Pimball podcasts out there. You feel

[30:10] free to use this. Please credit the source as Canadian Pimball podcast Marty. I hope I hope we

[30:15] can bury the hatchet. I know you're doing a show for Monday. Let's put this on head to head too. This

[30:20] is as good as it's going to get in terms of sources on what's next at Stern Pimball. All right,

[30:26] now first I have to like look up something real quick because this is a date that you're going to

[30:31] want to know about and okay, let's see. Do do do because at this show a new Stern Pimball machine

[30:40] will be revealed. So I just want to make sure I get the right dates for you guys. All right,

[30:45] let's see. Okay, here we go. All right, you ready? Drum roll please. Can you just Pimball podcasts

[30:50] giving you Stern Pimball's 2019 Pimball plans subject to change and maybe they might hear this

[30:57] and start to move stuff around because I know they get really annoyed when I talk about this stuff.

[31:02] So here we go. Here's what's going to happen in 2019 according to my sources. The most the most

[31:08] powerful one is the first one and I think that this is already been speculated many times over.

[31:15] In fact, I don't even feel like I'm leaking this because the more I talk to people, it's like

[31:19] it's like they give this information back to me and as if they already know it. So here's what

[31:23] here's what the deal is the next Stern Pimball machine. The next game coming out, the next game going

[31:30] on the line is Steve Richie's game and it is an original game by Steve Richie. Now I have not had

[31:38] 100% confirmation on what the title will be but I keep hearing that it will be Black Knight 3000

[31:47] and this is Steve Richie's game that will be and this is the other part that I'm hearing.

[31:52] This will be the last game that Steve Richie does with Stern. Now that part I'm not 100%

[31:58] sure on but I keep hearing that that is it that this is going to be Steve Richie's sort of final

[32:04] swan song game over at Stern. He's not that old but I find it hard to believe that he's ready to

[32:09] retire. So that part I'm not 100% sure on but I'm hearing that this will be Steve Richie's last

[32:16] game. The other part that I'm hearing is that this game will be coded by someone who's completely

[32:25] new to coding games over at Stern Pimball. The coder of Black Knight 3000 will be no other than Tim

[32:34] Sexton. So he is doing the code on the game. How do I know this? Well, you know, Tim has friends

[32:42] in the New York area and they talk to people and that's how I know it. So I'm here to confirm for you

[32:46] on Canatus Pimball podcast that Steve Richie's next game will be coded by Tim Sexton. Now the other

[32:54] part of this is when will this game be revealed and I'm about to tell you right now exactly when

[32:59] Stern plans on revealing this game. This game will be revealed at the Midwest Gaming Classic which is

[33:07] Friday April 12th through Sunday April 14th. So Stern Pimball's next game will be revealed

[33:15] in mid April. So there you have it. We will see what it's all about. Now here's the other part I

[33:20] heard and this is from other sources close within Stern. I am hearing that Stern Pimball is really

[33:28] nervous about this game that they are really nervous that it's going to sell and they're anxious

[33:34] and if you think about it they have a big reason to be anxious because this breaks away from the

[33:40] mold over at Stern Pimball. Stern is so used to the same formula of license IP and then

[33:49] you know that equals sales because they don't have to worry about creating a lot of hype because

[33:54] they know that people are into these properties but here we go in original IP. Now Steve Richie,

[34:01] the king of Pimball, the self-proclaimed king, he has enough clout and power to convince them to

[34:06] let him do in original IP and maybe this is sort of a response to how sort of handicap he felt

[34:16] handicap, handicap. Sorry you guys see again my head, what's a handicap? He was handicapped by Star Wars

[34:22] so much and we heard that. He wasn't happy with how hard it was to make Star Wars because of all

[34:29] the restrictions with the license and so this would maybe in response to that where Stern was like

[34:34] all right if you do it on your next one we'll let you just run wild with it and create whatever you

[34:40] want. Now here's the thing when you're an open IP like Black Knight 3000 right they don't have to

[34:46] pay any money for the license what that means is we should see a lot more in this game from a

[34:51] mechanical standpoint because there is absolutely no money that has to go to the license when it comes

[34:57] to the bomb of the game so will Black Knight 3000 be a completely unique and mechanically spectacular

[35:04] game from Stern? Well a lot more be put into it now if that's the case why are they nervous over

[35:11] there about the game? What do they know that we don't know? So we'll see in mid April we've got

[35:17] a couple months to go now before we see that but that is the latest of the next Stern game.

[35:23] I can tell why Stern might be nervous though because they have to keep the line going. If this game

[35:28] comes out and it doesn't resonate with people and it's a little bit of a flop that Stern is not

[35:34] used to that and remember just ask one question what was the last original IP game that Stern

[35:41] released and how well did it do? Original IP and if you go back it's even really hard to find in

[35:48] original IP game that Stern has done in the last 10 years. I think the only one I can think about

[35:54] and it didn't sell well the only one was Wo Nellie right that was the only one that was a Stern

[36:03] produced manufactured game and so I can imagine they must be really nervous okay so what also my

[36:10] hearing about Stern in 2019? I'm hearing that we're not going to see James Bond or spider or sorry

[36:17] Superman 78 those are not games that I'm hearing are going to happen okay now I forgot one thing

[36:24] on Steve Rich's game I don't know who's doing the artwork I don't think it's Christopher

[36:29] Franchi I don't think it's Zombie Eddie who will they get to do the art will they get the artist who

[36:36] did Black Knight 2000 will they go back and use the original artist I'm not sure I just don't know

[36:42] is doing the art on the game now that being said to we are very used to incredible art on all

[36:49] these recent Stern games so I hope that the bar is equal if not raised with this original IP game

[36:57] okay so that means what does that mean that means that Steve Rich will never come on the show

[37:00] that means I'll probably never get any more Stern people on the show but that is what their plans

[37:05] are now no Superman 78 and no James Bond this year is what I'm hearing now here is what I'm hearing

[37:12] the other two milestone titles will be from Stern Pimball in 2019 are you ready are you sitting

[37:19] down this is what I hear is coming out from very reliable sources this summer get ready get your

[37:29] deposits in get your money ready I am hearing two major titles I am hearing Jurassic World will be

[37:38] a Stern game coming out in 2019 the dinosaurs are back a little questionable on the timing as

[37:46] the second Jurassic World movie was not the best but it it is nice that's turn is going back to the

[37:52] jungle and we are getting a Jurassic World game with dinosaurs and I think this can be a lot of fun

[38:00] if done right it's also nice that they're going to a more recent IP I think Jurassic World the first

[38:06] movie was incredible I would love for them just to make the pinball based on that movie the second

[38:11] movie was bad I wouldn't even bother with it but it's nice to have a dinosaur themed game you know

[38:16] that Jurassic Park theme song is so iconic in a modern game with modern display modern sound and

[38:22] we all love the daddy East Jurassic Park game which is the bar when it comes to Jurassic Park so that

[38:29] is what I'm hearing Jurassic World will come out from Stern pinball now great huge huge theme

[38:36] even bigger than that I'm hearing that the rumors are true that Brian Eddie's next game is

[38:42] jaws and jaws is being worked on and we should see jaws sometime this year so Steve Richie original

[38:50] Jurassic World and jaws I'm not sure on the order of Jurassic World and jaws though I don't have

[38:57] confirmation on that the other big news that I heard is that Stern did secure another license

[39:04] which is based on a very popular TV show of today and that is Stranger Things that Stern has

[39:10] the Stranger Things license and when will they make that game not sure but that means it could be

[39:17] anytime soon now this this this leaves a lot of questions yeah right this leaves a lot of questions

[39:24] for me because it also raises the questions of well when is Elvira 3 coming out and is that coming

[39:31] out in fourth quarter so maybe we're gonna see black night 3000 then I think it makes sense in the

[39:38] summertime to hit with jaws right and then it makes sense to hit with Elvira or Jurassic World I

[39:46] don't know maybe it's right Jurassic World and jaws feel like two summertime releases to me so I'm

[39:51] not sure how they're gonna do that maybe we see April may see the pro Stern usually does a game

[39:57] every three to four months so it makes sense you have monsters and like three to four months later you

[40:02] have black night 3000 then three to four months later you're either gonna have jaws or Jurassic World

[40:08] and then you're gonna have a fourth quarter milestone title will it be Elvira or will it be

[40:12] something else I'm not sure but we know Elvira is also in the mix we know that a Toho Godzilla is in

[40:19] the mix we know that stranger things might be in the mix so a lot of options now here's a thing

[40:25] two about Stern and we know this they're always designing a lot of games simultaneously and they've

[40:32] really been ramping up their programming department and their coding department and we know that they

[40:37] can design a game and get it to market pretty quickly and now that the code department is pretty big

[40:43] I think Stern can have a variety of titles to pick from in terms of what goes on the line next

[40:51] and and that's gonna be you know an interesting thing to see how it rolls out now what does that

[40:56] mean if that is the case for 2019 I think it becomes a very interesting year you know what are we

[41:02] gonna see from deep route what when are we gonna see Willie Wonka what will Jersey Jack's plans be

[41:07] but 2019 is starting to shape up to be another very exciting year for pinball in fact I think it's

[41:13] gonna be much better than 2018 if you look at the twippies for 2018 best games I don't think a lot

[41:20] of stuff was like wow like holy crap you know I think 2019 actually is gonna shape up to have a much

[41:27] better selection of pins so that's what I'm hearing I might be right I might be wrong but I'm

[41:33] definitely right about Steve Richie's next game being at Midwest gaming classic that is absolutely

[41:39] happening if it doesn't happen it's because I listen to this podcast and they're just gonna move

[41:44] it to try and prove me wrong say I know I always put them in a little bit of a quagmire it's always

[41:49] a dilemma for Stern when when when Kineda has to spoil their plans from a marketing standpoint but

[41:54] we already knew this you know that Steve Richie's game is coming those of you in the inner circle of

[42:01] pinball you guys all know this information you all share it you all talk about it but only on

[42:07] this podcast will actually go out and let the rest of the people here about it without having to

[42:11] pay me any money so welcome to the canada pinside pinball podcast insiders club you're all part of it

[42:18] I will let people know exactly what I hear when I hear it I don't think we should hide information

[42:23] from the community and and if everyone wants to sort of talk amongst this little inner circle

[42:29] you know and you have information you want me to air on this podcast happily send it to me I

[42:34] will happily air it out for everyone to hear and speculate about because that's what's fun I mean

[42:40] just fun to speculate about what's next on pinball sorry on pinball podcast right all right guys I

[42:45] feel like maybe I should go to the doctor don't it's just was this podcast okay or did I just sound

[42:50] like I hit my head really hard and I'm just in a babbling incoherent mess I don't know I think

[42:57] it wasn't too bad all right well there you have it 2019 Stern games that are coming out that's

[43:04] the plan go to pinside take credit for it don't mention this podcast you might get banned everyone

[43:11] love you so much and I want to close out by saying listen to Ken Cromwell's special one lit podcast

[43:19] the last episode was great he called for a pinball podcast sort of ceasefire same as I have

[43:26] and let's all do it let's all get along let's let's do each other's show I apologize publicly to

[43:30] anyone who's been offended by this show or by me Ryan C Marty you guys know it come on man like let's

[43:36] all just bury the hatchet get along and do each other's shows I think would be great it would be

[43:41] awesome for all all you out there to see us all get along a little bit better we're not competing

[43:46] we're all talking about the same stuff and that's pinball podcasting we should all get along right

[43:52] I also think all of you out there should check out is Greg and Zach did a straight down the middle

[43:58] review of the monsters pinball really awesome show love those guys reviews and I think they rated

[44:06] it at a B but what's great about it now is Greg is doing the reviews and they're having two other

[44:12] people score the games as well and that will tally up the final score for the game I think Zach is

[44:18] sort of step to the side a little bit because he's now distributing at flipping out pinball which

[44:23] is great so I think he's you know realizing that it's a little hard to be a distributor and give

[44:29] you're completely honest review of the game because you used to want people to buy the game right

[44:34] but great show those guys just continue to make I think the best YouTube reviews of pinball that

[44:40] that that is out there and so love the new format guys keep up the good work everyone have a great

[44:46] weekend we'll be back real soon I'm gonna just go go to bed I'm dehydrated I've hit my head

[44:53] and look at the picture of me on the ground just staring up at the ceiling with a little smile on

[44:57] my face dreaming of another twippy for best pinball podcast I'll talk to you guys real soon

[45:16] what
