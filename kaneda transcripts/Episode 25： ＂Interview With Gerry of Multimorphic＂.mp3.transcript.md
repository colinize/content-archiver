[00:00] Canada! Canada! Canada! Canada! Canada! Canada!

[00:05] Welcome to episode 25 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:17] And this episode is going to be an interview with Jerry Stelenberg from Multi-Morphic,

[00:25] who is working on P3. And I really wanted to do this interview after sitting through Jerry Seminar

[00:32] at the Texas Pinball Festival because I really wanted to just hear from him his thoughts on

[00:38] P3 and where it's going to go from here. And I'll tell you why because my initial response was to

[00:44] just sort of give my own opinions about P3 in Multi-Morphic and the machine. And I just didn't

[00:51] think that'd be fair. I wanted to hear from him about what his vision is and what we expect to see

[00:56] from them in 2016. And I had a really great chat with Jerry. And I'll say this, universally across

[01:02] the board, I hear that Jerry is a great guy and he is a great guy. And he's got a dream. And his

[01:08] dream is to sort of revolutionize how people think about pinball and what pinball can be. And when

[01:15] you have a dream like that, that is very bold, very disruptive, it's not always easy to see or

[01:22] believe in it and to see what he sees. And I think people are on the fence and I'm on the fence

[01:27] with a lot of you about whether or not this will actually take off and become a hit, whether or not

[01:33] it will be viable as a business. But that doesn't mean that it shouldn't happen. And I think that

[01:40] for innovation to take place, you need people that dream and you need people who have passion and

[01:46] that are willing to disrupt the category. And he's definitely doing that. And I think he's tapping

[01:50] into some very, very strong insights that other companies I think are just ignoring. One being,

[01:58] you know, there are no games out there that are easy for people to jump on. Whether the themes are

[02:03] for children or adults alike, pinball has become way too complex, way too hard for people to jump on

[02:09] and have immediate fun with. And I think that's a huge, huge problem. The diehards expect so much

[02:15] in terms of deep code and complexity. But majority people who want to play pinball and have fun don't

[02:20] really care about that. And I think that's a hard pill to swallow for some people. Art work,

[02:26] you know, he's making it easy to swap artwork in and out of games. That's something we all kind of

[02:31] complained about a lot. And just the overall sense that, you know, do you need to buy a static game

[02:38] and then buy another one and buy another one? And at what point does that become sort of silly?

[02:43] And should we switch over to more of a platform like this? So look, we'll see if it works.

[02:49] It's there are definitely challenges ahead. And we talked to him about that. But I really admire

[02:54] about Jerry is that he hasn't taken anyone's money. So who am I to come in and crap on a man's dream?

[03:01] Who he's self-financing this thing? So he deserves a lot of respect because I think a lot of people

[03:07] have been burned over the last two years who have taken money from the community. People have lost

[03:11] money. But Jerry's got a dream and he's financing it by himself and with the help of some people

[03:16] within his organization. And let's see what comes of it. I think we all should keep an open mind

[03:21] when this platform ships to see how it does. Ultimately, consumers will decide whether or not they

[03:28] enjoy it, whether or not Alexey Lightspeed is the game for them, whether or not they're willing to

[03:33] invest in this new platform that could change the way people think about Pimbal. I think that's

[03:38] exciting. I think that deserves respect. And I think that's how it should be. Hopefully we see

[03:45] his system going into his platform going into boxes and going into people's homes this year.

[03:50] It sounds like that's going to be the case. So without further due ladies and gentlemen,

[03:54] I want to air this interview and I want all of you out there to do your best to try and experience

[04:00] this and also just play Pimbal before you make your opinions about it as much as you can. That

[04:04] doesn't mean we're going to stop just giving your opinions when people show us an unpopulated

[04:08] playfield than having our own opinions without playing it because that's also what we will never

[04:13] stop doing. But without further due, here is the interview with Jerry. I hope you enjoy it. If you

[04:18] have feedback, hit me up at canadapimbal at gmail.com. Ladies and gentlemen, let's roll the tape.

[04:25] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome Jerry Stellenberg to canada's Pimbal podcast.

[04:32] Jerry, thank you so much for joining the show. Absolutely. Chris, nice to talk to you.

[04:37] You too. I mean, we talked very briefly at the Texas Pimbal Festival. Let's talk about that

[04:45] show because I think we're sort of all coming off of being there. What were your thoughts on the

[04:50] show overall? The TPS is always a great show. It's the largest in the country now. It's one of the

[04:57] largest and it's always an experience for us because it's our home show and it's the place when

[05:01] we first showed off the P3 a few years ago. The show is amazing. It's grown so fast in the last

[05:06] couple of years that I heard they might be growing so bad that they might have to find a new venue

[05:12] in the next few in the upcoming year. So that's good news, that they're growing so much.

[05:18] That's hard to imagine. I know they sold out the rooms early but while that floor is still,

[05:22] I mean, the way they allocate the space is pretty cool because it's such a large place and they

[05:27] pack it with games but you don't feel crowded. Right. So just to for the listeners of the show,

[05:34] Jerry is the founder of Multi-Morfray, and you guys are headquartered in Austin, Texas, correct?

[05:41] Yes, that's right. And for those out there, I think a lot of people have

[05:45] are familiar with Multi-Morfray and P3 but for those who aren't, Jerry, why don't you give a quick

[05:51] sort of introduction to what Multi-Morfray and P3 is for people out there? Sure. So I'm a,

[05:59] I'd like to call myself or at least I used to call myself just a pinball enthusiast. I had about

[06:04] 12 games in my house at one point and I honestly got bored of them. I had, you know, early 90s

[06:12] machines and every time I turn them on, they're the same thing and I'd play a few and I'd get to

[06:17] the end and I'd be them and I got to the point where I didn't really want to turn them on anymore

[06:22] and traditionally that's when you would sell games and buy new ones but I being a, being a developer,

[06:27] being an electronics guy, I took a different route and I designed the P-Rock board which is a board

[06:32] people can use to replace their CPU boards and run new code and people can create new code,

[06:39] other people can run the new code on their machines and basically, you know, breathe new life

[06:43] into their old games. So I started with that, we kind of grew the business a little bit, I

[06:47] a couple of friends and I started building the boards and selling them and writing some software

[06:50] forum and then we turned our attention to the machine itself because like I said, every time

[06:57] you turn these games on, they're the same thing essentially and I came up with this concept where

[07:02] we could build this multi-game platform in a physical sense, right? It's still physical

[07:07] involved but I wanted to build this platform where we could do the same thing that the video game

[07:13] console did for video games and that's give people a way to buy that machine, that console,

[07:19] that piece of equipment once and then add games to it for relatively inexpensively.

[07:25] In the, in the video game world you buy that three or four hundred dollar thing and then add

[07:28] thirty or forty dollar games to it and in the first world pinball's a different beast right because

[07:33] their mechanical devices and super big and complex and expensive to make so they're a lot more

[07:37] expensive but with the P3 or with the system like the P3 you should only need to pay that $78,000,

[07:44] $10,000 once and then you can add games to it for relatively and expensively.

[07:51] All right so you have this idea to sort of do something that's never been done before, I mean you

[07:55] want to create a platform by which people can change the games in a way that makes it a lot more

[08:02] like a video game system where they're not going to have to pay an arm and a leg every time they

[08:05] want to swap out. Now we've seen the pinball 2000 right and you're different than that right so

[08:11] we want to explain how your system is a different sort of way to swap games out versus like a pinball 2000

[08:17] or even a highway pinball is where you're taking out the whole play field you guys took a different

[08:21] approach. Right so I think that you know swapping out that full play field like they were trying to

[08:27] do in pinball 2000 is cool in the sense that you don't have to buy that cabinet again but those

[08:33] play fields are big and they're heavy and trying to get that out of the machine yourself is not

[08:39] super easy because they're you know big and heavy but I mean you also have to find a place for them.

[08:43] So yes you're buying a machine once and adding games to it for potentially less money than you

[08:51] would with new games but you're still logistically dealing with these humongous play fields trying to

[08:56] find space for them. I think it's great for operators or it's potentially great for operators.

[09:01] The concept is great for operators in the sense that they can buy a machine put a game in it whether

[09:06] it's revenge from ours or whatever and they can have their customers play it for a few months or a

[09:11] year or whatever and then once they want to change things out and refresh their games they can

[09:16] swap a different play field into that system. Right. Our concept is like I said more like the video

[09:23] game console where we hope people will swap their games you know three four five times in an

[09:30] afternoon or doing a playing session. We wanted to create a system where you could very easily

[09:35] with no tools and with no you know super strong muscles and and lots of help you should be able

[09:43] to yourself just literally pull this play field out of your games stick it in the corner of a room

[09:47] or in a closet and add a new one to it. So our play fields are smaller than the pinball 2000 play

[09:55] fields are traditional pinball play fields in the sense that the part that is modular is at the top

[10:00] third of the of the length of the play field. The bottom two thirds is a whole another beast which

[10:04] we should probably talk about in a different part of the conversation because it's interesting too

[10:09] but the upper third of the play field is where we can swap out that you know it's like a two by

[10:15] two foot piece of wood where all the mechanics are mounted and all those things. We have to

[10:18] relapse your targets those kind of things. So I think for for for listeners who haven't seen

[10:24] the multi-morphic system I would recommend googling it and seeing what this is because describing it

[10:31] on a podcast is somewhat difficult. So it's it the bottom two thirds of the play field is a full screen

[10:40] that interacts with the ball which plays like traditional it plays like a traditional pinball with

[10:45] flippers that sit above that screen and the back the top one third is is an actual mechanical

[10:52] interchangeable sort of play field that can be swapped out easily depending on the game that you're

[10:57] playing correct. That's probably the worst description you've ever heard of it but that's

[11:03] kind of what's going on right and I recommend that people go look at what's going on because it

[11:06] really is cool and there's nothing else like it that has been attempted in pinball. Yeah you know

[11:11] we run into this problem all the time trying to describe it or trying to explain how it plays or

[11:19] trying to convince people that it's actually fun in words in text or the phone or on forms or

[11:25] whatever we we really need people to see and play it before they make a judgment because it's

[11:29] something that they're not quite used to but it plays exactly like a traditional pinball machine.

[11:34] Right. Yeah that lower portion of the play field you described as an LCD. In our minds

[11:40] the lower two thirds of most pinball machines are you know they're painted pieces of wood.

[11:46] There's not a whole lot of mechanics there there's the flippers and the slingshots and

[11:51] sometimes there's some targets on the side relatively close to the outlands and sometimes there's

[11:57] maybe a scoop pretty low down the play field but in general they're just empty pieces of wood

[12:03] with some artwork on them maybe some blinking insert lamps. So we essentially took that dead space

[12:09] the ball just rolled over that wood it doesn't do anything it just you know it goes from the flipper

[12:13] off towards the upper portion of the play field towards the ramps and loops and targets and things

[12:17] we replace that with this LCD. In the same sense that you have an iPad and your finger can interact

[12:22] with the iPad the physical pinball can interact with this with this play field LCD. So we took that

[12:29] dead space and we added virtual content to it we can change the way it looks we can change the

[12:33] way it interacts with the ball and we can add meaning to that otherwise empty dead space and pinball

[12:38] machines. Right. Can you something I when the machines off is there an ability to do like a screen

[12:45] saver like thing on that screen because a lot of these guys too they like to look at their games

[12:49] as pieces of artwork when they're not using them. So is there is there that opportunity with with

[12:54] the system to not just have the blank screen there. We've talked about some interesting ideas we've

[13:00] never implemented anything down there that's actually the exact same thing I discuss when people

[13:04] talk about screens in the back box right because traditionally we have translates and things in

[13:09] the back box pinball machines and when you replace that translate with an LCD and turn the machine

[13:14] off it's it's blank. I feel like having a translate in the back box is more important than having

[13:22] artwork on the play field from a you know looks pretty when you walk in the room because because

[13:27] that's what you see when you look at a game if you're in an arcade and you're looking across the room

[13:31] you don't see the play field you see that translate right or ever. So yeah I mean I don't know there's

[13:38] that's certainly not not a huge priority for us right now but there's probably something we can

[13:42] do someday. So you had a big announcement at a tpf for you guys was the the reveal of was it

[13:50] four more titles and again that right that would be part of the bundle. That's right. And and

[13:55] there and and Jerry just can you go over quickly what what you guys showed at at the at tpf what

[14:03] you games were announced. Absolutely and for those who actually want to watch the seminar I will be

[14:09] I have the footage I was actually editing it earlier today I have the footage of the seminar

[14:12] be posting it on our side at some point but we so we've developed the first game Lexi lights be

[14:18] the skate from earth we've been talking about it for a little while now and it's a mostly

[14:22] traditional style pinball game that people who are familiar with pinball and enjoy the intricate

[14:27] shot layouts and deep rule sets they can enjoy this game but we want to explore different types

[14:34] of gameplay and target different demographics build machines or games for no for kids and for

[14:40] women and for people that aren't necessarily pinball enthusiasts. So what I did is I've looked

[14:47] around and watched people play games on location seeing these random people walk up to machines

[14:53] and interact with them and what we've noticed what I've noticed is that pinball games are just

[14:59] too complex for most people they walk up to these games and there's you know there's all these toys

[15:04] and there's artwork and there's blinking lights and they have no literally no idea what to do

[15:08] right could be skim other than keep the ball out keep the ball up and graining yeah exactly so

[15:14] these new games that we developed one of them is a complete game in the sense that it's a playfield

[15:21] its cabinet artwork it's a full set of rules we call it can in the goon it's a pirate themed game

[15:27] and it's not as complex as your traditional game in the sense that the shot layout is

[15:33] is fairly simple we have a few different shot lanes we have an LCD screen that we put in the

[15:39] upper playfield so that we can change the way the upper playfield looks as you're shooting those

[15:46] shot lanes and we created this this this fun but not super deep ruleset for it so people can walk

[15:54] up to it hit the start button it presents a game it presents targets on that upper LCD that

[16:03] coincide with the shot lanes and people can instantly understand what to do while they're playing it

[16:08] so that's that's canon lagoon it's it's a full game in the sense that it's all of the physical

[16:13] stuff in artwork but it's not your traditional game we're trying to hit a different demographic into

[16:18] you know attract people that aren't super hardcore pinball enthusiasts to the game

[16:24] yeah yeah yeah i just want to say like i was at the seminar at texas pinball festival and jerry

[16:29] brought up some young kids to play and i think you you guys have have a hit on a really really

[16:35] powerful insight that pinball is probably the most intimidating entertainment device that a

[16:43] kid can walk up to and not even just a kid i have friends who are my age and i took them to

[16:49] sunshine laundromat and brooklyn where there's you know 30 of the best pinball machines ever made

[16:54] and people just couldn't have fun they just they just they were so overwhelmed by the complexity of

[17:01] the game so yeah i i do think that you guys have hit something that a simpler pen just a pen

[17:08] you can just jump on and explain a simple rule set is something that the the category definitely

[17:13] needs that isn't out there one cool thing about the p3 is we can experiment easily with these things

[17:19] you know if we come out with this game that tries to target different demographics and is simpler

[17:23] and it doesn't work out if people don't like it then it wasn't a huge rnd expense we didn't

[17:28] spend a ton of time making it we actually we developed this game it took about six months of six

[17:35] or seven people working you know three or four hours a week after their day jobs working nights

[17:40] and weekends and things and there's probably each each of those developers probably put

[17:45] 50 to 100 hours into this game and so we developed it on a schedule that is on herd of

[17:51] an epinball industry and we did that because we have the system we have the platform we have the

[17:56] software framework we have all this stuff in place so we can experiment with these things and

[18:00] we want to experiment with a lot more right we have ideas for completely different playing styles

[18:06] than what people are used to and at the same time it's always important for me to say this because

[18:10] i tend to scare people and i say that um but we're going to continue developing traditional style

[18:15] games because that's what we love ourselves and that's what we know the pinbook community really

[18:19] loves to so let's let's go over um quickly like the other titles that you showed and then i want

[18:25] it i do want to talk about what is next in terms of what you guys are working on what you'd like

[18:31] people to start developing for the platform but the other three titles that you guys showed were

[18:37] were which titles yep so one of them is a subset of the game lexelite speed escape from earth where

[18:45] we focus on that that really cool eight ball physical ball lock we have in the game so we created

[18:50] sub game called lexelite speed secret agent showdown and the focus of that is for people to literally

[18:56] just shoot that ball lock and try to get an eight ball multiple and again we changed the playing

[19:01] dynamic a little bit where instead of a three ball game it feeds to the player one into time eight balls

[19:08] so you get a ball you try to shoot and lock if it goes into a hole or the drain then that's it and

[19:13] if you do another ball you get eight balls you get a chance to lock them all up and play multi ball

[19:18] so that secret agent showdown we created a different game actually the are two other games are games

[19:23] that we had concepts for in our very early prototypes that we showed in tpf 2012 i believe

[19:32] and these are two games that are almost like video style games with graphics and target and things

[19:41] on the LCD but using the physical pinball and physical flippers and physical bumpers as your

[19:46] user interface to that game and one of them is called rocks ro c s kind of a take on our on our

[19:52] p rock board the naming of it but rocks describe asteroids or now these these rocks that float around

[19:58] in space they're floating around on the screen and you're trying to shoot them with the ball and it's

[20:03] a multi level game you you clear the level you move on to the next level you get farther in the game

[20:07] your flippers get destroyed by the the the rocks in your flippers get weaker and you can collect

[20:13] power ups and get new new power for your flippers and all these things and then the other game is

[20:18] targeting kids directly it's a game called barnyard where we have these you know these farm yard

[20:23] animals running around the screen carols and horses and chickens and little kids enjoy just

[20:28] hitting them with that physical pinball right and you guys have also designed a really cool just

[20:34] like big button to go on this into replace the smaller pinball buttons we that was really cool

[20:39] to show that you know kids want to just have like a bigger easier button to slap as they're playing

[20:44] pinball and that was yeah we have those on the side of the machine we have these things called

[20:48] button boxes which we did so we can I mean just like the rest of the machine the buttons are a

[20:52] modular we can change up the way people interface with the machine so for fun and for the show

[20:59] and yeah we'll probably integrate it with the game at some point maybe for the redemption style

[21:02] games but yeah we we we traditionally have a three button thing on the side for Lexi and a lot of

[21:08] people they walk up and they're like when do all these buttons do I've never seen a game with these

[21:12] three buttons I don't know how to use them they once again they get intimidated by them right so

[21:17] we could we'll throw a single humongous button on it that people can just walk up they know exactly

[21:22] which button to hit because there's only one and they're good to go right so you you you've been

[21:26] doing this circuit I've been watching videos on on YouTube and and the forums and on Facebook and

[21:32] so you've been sort of going around since 2012 right sort of showing off the prototype and it's

[21:37] been evolving ever since is this is this is this is this a full-time thing you're working on or

[21:43] is this is this a side project do you have a day job or how focused is is are your efforts with P3

[21:50] right now a good question when I started it was a hobby project I did the p-rock at after work

[21:56] and supported it and then built this machine for fun with my friend less and until until the end

[22:04] of 2013 it was just a part time you know let's see if we can do this let's see what happens kind

[22:09] of a gig but the response to the machine was so good it was so interesting and people seem to

[22:14] enjoy the concept so much that less and I both at the end of 2013 both quit our day jobs and started

[22:22] working on this full time okay so we've been working on it full time for almost two and a half years

[22:30] wow so you guys okay so you guys are focused on getting this thing to market and and you know I

[22:36] think that the community has seen the the whole p3 system evolve and multi-morphic evolve so

[22:43] let's fast forward then so it's it's 2016 we've got lexelites speed lexelites speed now is that

[22:49] game considered done at this stage is that sort of ready to launch with the with the launch of of

[22:55] p3 done is a final type of word that right no games ever done it's very close we just recently

[23:04] actually two weeks before tpf we added all the voice callouts we have over 800 voice callouts in that

[23:09] game but we have a few more bugs to fix there are a couple of issues that pop up that we need to

[23:14] to track down and fix but the logic for the game yeah and the gameplay is essentially complete we

[23:18] could launch that today it would probably be one of the more mature games that gets launched okay

[23:23] so we've got lexel we've got these these these fun mini games um it's it's really like a platform

[23:29] that it's you know seemingly the whole family can enjoy what what's next i want to sort of talk

[23:35] about here we are it's March 2016 what do you guys see happening in the remainder of 2016 are you

[23:43] do you feel like this is going to be the year where shipping will happen or I know I know that's

[23:49] no one likes to speculate on when they're actually going to go out the door but how confident are

[23:55] you guys that this system is going to sort of be shipping this year uh uh yeah so that that

[24:02] word also is a bad word in this industry we're trying to predict that date is tough um

[24:08] I feel 100% confident we'll be shipping games by the end of the year hopefully a lot sooner than that

[24:12] okay but i'm not telling people a date i'm not giving people an exact time i i feel like

[24:18] the way i want to run this company is i want to keep people in the loop as much as i can i don't

[24:22] want to promise them things that i can't necessarily guarantee right and and i think that's smart i

[24:28] think you have witnessed as as have everyone else of the last couple years the the ill effects of

[24:36] placing dates out there for people to get stuck in their head um but i think and i don't know

[24:41] another thing you've guys have done and i want to talk about this because your pre-order system is

[24:46] is much different than other companies and pre-ordering has sort of become this

[24:53] despicable term because of how it's been utilized by other manufacturers

[24:58] but talk about your pre-order model and how you decide to come about with it or come out with it

[25:06] yeah we use the word pre-order just because it basically implies that your

[25:12] committing in a sense to a game purchase but yeah we started out when we first announced the

[25:18] lexelite speed theme we got on the bandwagon like everybody else did and we started

[25:23] asking for customer payments and i didn't like it right we as a company multi-morphic we can't

[25:31] spend like i guess we can but we shouldn't spend any customer money until we're building the

[25:38] products that we're going to ship for them um basically unrecognized revenue and it's really

[25:44] from my point of view it's not money that's ours yet until we're building their machine so

[25:49] we're taking their money this is back in 2013 i believe the end of 2013 or early 2014 we took some

[25:55] money and we put it in the bank and it sits there in the bank and we can't use it anyway so what's

[26:00] the point in having it right so the the goal of us raising interest in getting people to sign up for

[26:07] our game is simply so that we can go to our investors or to potential new investors and show them

[26:14] the interest for this machine show them it's not just me making up numbers that there really are

[26:19] people and that's why we make them sign a form our pre-order our pre-order is a form that people

[26:24] download fill out scan it or send it back to me and it's a form with their signature that shows

[26:31] they might not buy the machine but they're interested enough in it to reserve one to basically

[26:36] tell us that they're interested in us making one for them so as you're sort of dealing with

[26:43] potential investors you you can go to them and say look we've got and i'm just throwing out

[26:47] like an arbitrary number we've got a thousand people who have signed up with a pre-order intent to

[26:54] to buy with you know no money down yet they're interested in in p3 and multi-morphic right and so

[27:01] but do you ever get concerned Jerry that without people putting money down though because that's

[27:06] like the flip side of it when people have to finally put money down it is more a of a serious

[27:12] commitment to buy that you might not be able to gauge what the actual commitment is once

[27:19] people are asked to pay that that number could significantly decrease or you're left

[27:24] you know without the ability to accurately predict your initial orders because everyone is

[27:30] just giving emails now and no money yeah that's that's absolutely true but i feel like it's the

[27:38] same story with deposits right companies that are offering a six or ten thousand dollar machine

[27:44] or somewhere in that range they're asking for what five thousand or five hundred dollars a thousand

[27:48] dollars fifteen hundred dollar deposit right what we've seen in the industry especially after the

[27:53] fallout from a couple of failed ventures is that people might sign up for these things they might

[28:00] put that money down but the likelihood they're going to follow through is just as low anyway

[28:04] so yeah i go to the investors at the potential investors and i say we've got these number of

[28:08] signups but realistically i have no idea it could be half of them fallout it could be 75% of them fall

[28:15] out but what i find interesting Chris in in this specific situation is we i get a lot of people

[28:24] emailing me on the fence that they're not sure if they should sign up they know they're interested

[28:29] in the machine they're not sure they're going to buy it but so they email me and they say here's

[28:33] where i stand i don't know if i should put my my name down because i don't want to put my name

[28:36] down unless i know for sure i'm going to buy it so i would say that the majority over 50% of the

[28:41] people on our list are people who are seriously considering it and by seriously considering it i

[28:48] think i think a five hundred dollar thousand dollar deposit is something they would do but again

[28:53] it's not something we need them to do because we're not going to use that money right so let's let's

[28:57] talk about that a little bit so it the company right now is it completely self finance at this

[29:03] point or do you have investors i mean you you don't have to disclose this if you don't want to but

[29:08] how how how are the doors kept open for four years without any pre-order money?

[29:14] a lot of a lot of people volunteering their time and their their efforts because they believe in

[29:22] in the in the product we took on some money from friends and family a few years ago when we started

[29:29] and that basically helped us build our early prototypes and it got us to the point where we had

[29:33] enough well well we we took the machines to shows and we started showing off the capabilities and

[29:40] every literally every show we go to this is this is not exaggerated this is absolutely true

[29:45] and we go to three or four or five shows a year so we're going to go to more this year

[29:50] but every single show we go to i get one or two or three people who come up to me

[29:56] and their developer types and they see the potential and they fall in love with the system and

[30:00] they volunteer to help right so we know how the staff of 16 people i'd say that i personally knew

[30:07] beforehand three or four of them and the rest of them are all people who came up to us at shows and

[30:13] just essentially volunteered to help we have a couple of people we pay simply because the only

[30:20] way that could help us is because or is is if we can help them you know pay their bills and put

[30:26] food on their table but the majority of us including me we're all unpaid we're doing this because

[30:31] we believe in it we're doing this because we're really doing it full time for me is the only way

[30:37] I can make this happen and i believe in it enough that i'm willing to you know risk a couple of

[30:42] years of little salary in order to make it happen right no i mean i mean that's admirable i mean

[30:47] it's i think when i talk to people about p3 and multi-morphic the passion you have for a gerry

[30:55] i think comes through and and really is appreciated by the community i mean people want to get behind

[31:02] a project where there's so much passion i'm driving it forward so you said something interesting

[31:08] at the seminar that you didn't see the other companies as competition because you were building

[31:14] a platform right and then it's it's a different thing you're going for versus just another machine

[31:21] but do you do you ever think like through the consumers the way the consumer views it that if

[31:25] if i have ten thousand dollars that i do have to sort of pick in 2016 am i gonna

[31:33] am i gonna go towards multi-morphic am i gonna go towards ghost busters or an alien or you know

[31:40] a libousky do you feel like the the consumer might have a dilemma of where to put that money in

[31:45] are you on some level do you feel like we have to provide a package that's got better value than

[31:50] what those other companies are providing yes of course but there's two points to address here i think

[31:58] uh mainly it's not that i don't think other companies are our competition i think they are

[32:04] because of that exact reason people need to make a choice which which machine to buy i honestly

[32:10] believe that we from their perspective from other companies perspective don't need to be their

[32:15] competition right because if another company sees our technology and sees us being successful

[32:23] at some point in the future when we're manufacturing and shipping games to lots of customers

[32:28] uh they don't have to view us as the other company that's making that other game what they can do

[32:35] is take advantage of all of our work they can take advantage of our technology they can take

[32:39] advantage of our platform they can take advantage of our customers buy simply developing games for

[32:44] our system so do you have a do you have a dream one day that someone like a stern might come

[32:50] you guys and say hey like we'd love to make a game on the platform sort of like um is that do

[32:55] everything that could be a possibility that another manufacturer out there or would you see it more as

[33:00] developers out there who are not one of the competitors would have an idea and they would

[33:05] bring into fruition through the platform is is i think that both should happen i but here's the

[33:12] thing if we sell and pick a number thousand two thousand five thousand ten thousand machines

[33:18] if there's if there's two thousand customers out there with p3s and somebody wants to develop a game

[33:24] so they do they go build a cabinet they build a play field and they you know they them it they

[33:29] write the software it takes them however many years to do it and then they have to find customers

[33:34] who want to put that into their house and that's challenging it's challenging for existing

[33:39] manufacturers because people already have their space filled up and it's a challenge for new

[33:43] manufacturers because they have to create the customer base for them but if we have this customer

[33:48] base that has p3s and someone goes and makes a game for the p3 the customer is the customers are

[33:56] going to be itching for games for the p3 yes of course we're going to make games uh who knows

[34:00] how many a year hopefully two or three at some point once we get rolling but at least in the early

[34:05] phases when there are in a ton of games available customers are going to be itching for any game for

[34:10] this system right and these are customers that already have the machine so spending you know

[34:16] $1,500 or $2,000 for a new game instead of $8,000 or $9,000 or $10,000 for a new machine makes perfect

[34:24] sense for everybody and by everybody I mean all three of us it makes sense for us because people

[34:29] interested in the machine and they'll bring us new customers it makes sense for other manufacturers

[34:34] yeah you pick a manufacturer any of them once we have that that customer base that user base installed

[34:41] absolutely it's to their advantage to build games for it they don't need to you know waste their

[34:46] manufacturing dollars working on machines and building those huge things and testing them and

[34:51] finding space for them and shipping them they can just build games now of course that's not going

[34:55] to happen at least not not in total the manufacturers other manufacturers are always probably going to

[35:00] build their own traditional games they're going to go get their licenses but I think that if you

[35:07] are a pinball enthusiast and you're building a game room you have five or ten or twenty games in

[35:12] your game room you are going to want to buy your favorite theme from the other manufacturers whatever

[35:18] it is whether it's a movie or a TV show or you know whatever you're going to look for those themes but

[35:22] you're also going to want this multi game capable platform because it gives you such a diverse

[35:28] and interesting playing experience and if you're not a pinball enthusiast use you know moving furniture

[35:34] around to put five or ten games in a room if you're just somebody looking for a single game

[35:39] then the p3 makes so much more sense than a traditional game right because by that machine once

[35:44] and you can add so much value to it through games well I'm sure you get asked and you just mentioned

[35:49] to like the the it seems to be the the lay of the land is is all about license themes and you

[35:55] probably get asked is a you know a million times but with with original themes being a harder sell

[36:02] in in today's climate more than ever license themes like what have you guys explored it I

[36:09] what what's your sort of stance on if a license might appear on your platform um talk to us about

[36:16] that yeah I would love to get a license I agree with everybody who says that it's a super hard

[36:22] challenge to bring unlicensed games to the pinball industry today people you know people like

[36:29] what they like and they get attached to themes whatever they are and those are the games that

[36:34] they jump at right away now of course I've researched it I've actually talked to a couple studios

[36:38] about specific licenses and talk through pricing and those kind of things I've talked to you know

[36:43] the name everyone always throws out is Roger Sharp I've talked to him about the process and about

[36:47] the expenses and them about the process to go through and get a license um here's the deal where

[36:53] where a startup we don't have tons of money to throw around um and if we're going to go get a

[36:57] license for the p3 it's going to be a big license we're not going to go buy a license for a little

[37:03] niche market that you know some subset of the community might enjoy like like like like like the

[37:09] monsters which I keep seeing people throw out monsters probably isn't number one on our list right

[37:14] um but you know what I'm saying we're going to go after a big license and to do that it's it's a

[37:20] six figure deal it's actually not just a low six figure deal it actually creeps up and for me to

[37:27] go either spend that money out of my own bank account out of my own pocket or try to find investors

[37:34] to support it is a is a challenge so it's irresponsible for me as a as a new startup business owner

[37:41] to take that risk I can't go and and find two hundred thousand dollars to go spend on a big license

[37:47] and hope that we build a machine people like we build a game that people enjoy because if they

[37:53] don't enjoy it if we don't build something that people buy then that money is going and I've ruined

[37:59] our company and I've not given us a chance to be successful so I think it's a good point and so

[38:05] the it's and then the initial charge for you guys is all about getting that customer base up right

[38:12] so you guys must be anxious to just start selling these things right and seeing what where you know

[38:18] what what the numbers are and what the interest is are you ready Jerry to like do you like at what point

[38:25] you guys say like look like we've gone to the shows we've gone we've gone the circuit multiple times

[38:32] when is the time to just say like we just let's just finish this thing get it ready to go is it

[38:36] is that is it easy to do that as you're sort of going the circuit and bringing it to shows or

[38:41] or can is it time to just sort of get it done like

[38:45] wow the get it done is an interesting phrase I would love to be able to tell you that we're just

[38:53] sitting around you know showing off an almost complete game trying to build a customer base and

[38:59] just kind of holding off on the production button because for whatever reason but no we're working

[39:04] our butts off to get this thing done right it's I think people try to compare us to other new

[39:11] manufacturers who are building new games and it's it's a tough comparison because we're not

[39:16] just building a game we've totally re-engineered from the ground up this entire platform right it's

[39:22] a new cabinet because a traditional playfield is great and works in that traditional cabinet but our

[39:27] playfield is different and I showed it the seminar we don't have a standard piece of wood with

[39:31] stuff bolted to it we have this whole system it's a chassis-based system where you can slide all your

[39:36] your mechanisms in and out of it that doesn't fit in a standard type of cabinet so we had to re-engineer

[39:42] the cabinet we re-engineered this playfield we re-engineered the buttons we re-engineered the

[39:46] back box we don't have all the boards up in the back box we re-engineered the control system we

[39:51] re-engineered every single thing on this pin-bomb machine we use standard coils and rubbers and

[39:56] targets and things but everything else in this thing is custom and we've had to engineer it from

[40:00] scratch so it's been a process obviously it's taken a few years to do it and then we're working

[40:05] through that now trying to get it to production I tell people we're in pre-production now and when

[40:11] I tell them that I explain that pre-production means we are buying parts from vendors we're doing

[40:17] what's called first article samples from our fabrication partners we're getting the pieces

[40:24] in house we're making sure they can build our parts to spec because right if we make a big order to

[40:30] a metal shop and the parts come back and they don't fit right then we're we're kind of host so we're

[40:35] buying small quantities of parts from all of these shops to make sure they meet our specs that

[40:40] they fit together that they work and oh by the way these things need to be long-term reliable

[40:45] right if we go and sell the machine in six months it's busted in everybody's houses then we have

[40:50] to basically spend all of our revenue supporting all of our existing customers and then we're kind of

[40:54] done so yes we are in this pre-production phase we're bringing in the parts we're going to put

[41:01] together our sample machines with these parts in the next month or two and work through teaching

[41:07] our contract manufacturers how to build the machines so that they can do it they can order the

[41:13] parts directly from the vendors they can put together the machines they'll test them they'll build

[41:17] them they'll test them they'll ship them and then we will be official in production okay well

[41:23] something interesting so we talked to Ben Heck about like a month ago and you know over the last

[41:30] couple years I think people have seen a lot of the boutique manufacturers sort of pop up the zid

[41:36] wares the skitties and it seems like spooky was the one that actually out of all of them

[41:41] shipped it pin right so I think people look at spooky sort of approach with with with with

[41:47] sort of questions of how would you guys get it done and actually make it work and something that

[41:52] Ben said was interesting was when it comes the pricing the pinball machine he said that the best

[41:57] approach is to just build it build your final pin and then from there you'll you'll know your bomb

[42:03] accurately and you can price the the pin accordingly talk about the price Jerry of of the system and

[42:11] is that price is is is that going to be the price how have you figured out how much to accurately

[42:17] charge based upon the years of R&D and and the and the different you know costs associated

[42:24] should associate it with basically like reengineering the entire game of pinball which I think is an

[42:29] incredible feat is that price sort of like where where we're going to be at like what's the right

[42:35] now 9,900 is in my right there in that in that price essentially is 98 75 okay yeah so we kind

[42:44] of took the same approach that Ben described I mean in a perfect world we would have had lots of

[42:50] money backing us and we could have stayed in what we call secret mode until we announced the

[42:54] production right no one knows the game exists no one knows we've reengineered everything

[42:59] we develop a game or two or five and we all of a sudden wake up one morning turn on a website

[43:06] come to the forums and yell from the top of our lungs that we have this brand new multi-game pinball

[43:12] platform it costs this much money sign up today we'll build them today we'll share that's obviously

[43:18] not what happened because we don't have that kind of financial backing so I've held off for a long

[43:24] time with price I made an in estimate initially and tried to bring people in saying we were going

[43:31] to sell it for about ten thousand dollars and we were going to ship it with two games one being

[43:35] like see light speed escape from earth and the second being a concept game we came up with a

[43:39] long time ago called cosmic heart racing and people could sign up for ten thousand dollars and

[43:45] they would get this platform with two games once we got the production and actually we discounted

[43:51] it a thousand dollars for the early sign ups and we kind of worked from that estimate all along

[43:58] I've been for the last year and a half two years asking people to sign up for this zero dollar

[44:04] down free pre-order without promising them what the price would be so I'm asking them to sign up

[44:10] to order the game and saying when we get to production I'll define a price and at that point you

[44:15] can finally decide if you really want to buy it so that's where what Ben described is what we've

[44:22] been doing we I couldn't define it a final price until I knew exactly how much it cost the build

[44:27] right so now we know that now we have all of our parts defined and we have our design basically

[44:33] complete we've gone to all of our vendors our parts vendors and fabricators and ask them how much

[44:38] does it cost to build five parts to build ten parts to build a hundred parts to build a thousand

[44:43] parts and we set up a pricing structure that that we think works for us given what I'm estimating

[44:50] our initial customer base will be got it so so okay so that makes sense and I think and I have

[44:58] to say this I think it's great that you guys haven't taken that pre-order money I'll to give you

[45:03] a quick like I pre-order the alien Ellie about a shoot like two months ago the fifteen hundred

[45:10] dollars down you know there's just so much coming out that I thought why not I'll see I ended up

[45:18] asking for a refund and it took 30 days to get the refund back and I also ended up losing about

[45:24] like a hundred and sixty dollars in terms of like the transaction fee from I guess PayPal is what

[45:31] charges for that so you know I think for a lot of people who are going on these pre-orders just

[45:36] speculating on it it's it's not you know you don't always get a hundred percent of what you put

[45:40] down and there is a cost associated with it so I think I think everyone is happy that you guys

[45:44] haven't taken money that this system exists and and that consumers can make up their mind when

[45:50] it's available to buy now how in terms of percentage Jerry like what how much more do you think

[45:56] there is there to go it seems like things are the games are working pretty smoothly I mean there's

[46:01] some kinks here and there that I know you guys are working on are you looking at like a summer fall

[46:05] and I again I don't want to you to put like a date in your but are you guys like 80% there 90%

[46:10] there is or how close do you think you are the other interesting question in the sense that at least

[46:17] in the development world where I'm from developing hardware and software we are we like to say that

[46:23] the last 10% takes 90% of the time because you're seeing all the bugs and finding all the hard to find

[46:31] issues is it's just very time consuming and making everything polished and and pretty and

[46:37] reliable is just tough like I said I think the design is complete I think what we're working through

[46:44] now is mostly logistical and yes we are still working through some issues and we had some issues

[46:51] at the show we had to take the machine down a couple times to fix random things and people might

[46:56] look at that and wonder if that means the machines are unreliable in reality all that means is where

[47:03] we're running prototype machines that shows that still have some hand-built parts that

[47:08] you know every time you hand-built a part you build two parts and they come out a little different

[47:12] so we're dealing with a couple issues related to that but that's the purpose of the sampling

[47:18] sure I'm building a sample machine to make sure all the parts that we expect come in and they're

[47:22] built properly and everything works and I feel like the design is 95% done that we might have to tweak

[47:29] a couple of parts in the last couple of minutes to fix whatever issues pop up or to to work around

[47:34] vendor issues if they can't manufacture things a certain way then maybe we'll need to tweak the

[47:38] part a little bit to make it easier to manufacture but we're there Chris we think we'll be building

[47:45] sample machines here in the next couple of months so we could theoretically be shipping machines in

[47:50] you know mid to late summer if and I always say this if things go well with this pre-production process

[47:57] if things don't go well we have to tweak parts and we have to find new vendors because some are

[48:01] unreliable or whatever then it's going to take a few months longer but we're close great and Jerry how

[48:08] in terms of the just the landscape of the pinball market play is do you guys do you guys

[48:13] closely monitor that I mean like a year ago or like let's say like two years ago there was a promise

[48:18] of so many pins to ship right and so few of them actually came to market it seems like 2016 is

[48:25] going to be a crowded space right in terms of asking for people's dollars if everything goes according

[48:30] to plan across the board right we've got Lebowski we've got another highway pinball coming we got

[48:36] ghost busters we've got stern's next one how do you guys feel about sort of entering the market at

[48:43] a time that is super crowded do you guys wish maybe you were able to get out ahead of that or you

[48:48] guys feel confident that this thing is just so different and unique and and bring such a leap forward

[48:53] and innovation that you're not doesn't really concern you guys at all well it's always nice to try to

[49:00] look at a market and think about when you would like to enter it but that's always just a mental

[49:07] exercise and doesn't work out reality right you build your machine you take your concepts and

[49:12] when it's finished it's finished if you have super great visibility and you can predict the future

[49:17] then maybe you can figure out when to start building something so that it will be done exactly

[49:21] the right time but that's just impossible to do but I feel like with this machine the reason we

[49:27] came out with this machine is because we feel like the industry needs it we feel like pinball

[49:35] machines have been the same forever and they're great for people that like traditional pinball and

[49:41] there's a whole community of people probably most of your audience are traditional pinball players

[49:46] of pinball enthusiasts who enjoy that traditional pinball experience so we've built a game that

[49:53] can deliver a traditional pinball experience but we've also built a game or a machine I should be

[49:57] saying that delivers so much more and we can reach different demographics and we can reach a

[50:03] broader range of people and we can interest the rest of your family and your kids and your wives and

[50:08] or spouses and and it doesn't I feel like going back to the word competition I feel like all of

[50:17] these other new manufacturers are competing with each other right I feel like we're different I

[50:25] feel like people will as I said earlier continue buying their favorite game they'll pick one

[50:30] one new machine from all these new manufacturers because it's the theme they want or whatever

[50:34] but I feel like if they want a a piece for their game room if they want a machine that they're

[50:41] going to hold on to for years because the average consumer is isn't going to want to flip games

[50:46] they're just going to want to buy a machine and and play it for years our machines the one they're

[50:50] going to buy and maybe not initially maybe it's going to depend on us building up a game library but

[50:56] I feel like we're different than everybody else we've brought new technology we've brought all

[51:00] these things that make more sense to consumers like the floor space use and the serviceability

[51:05] and the modularity the game libraries that that we're not we're not directly competing with all

[51:13] these other manufacturers right does it does it get frustrating for a company Jerry when you

[51:20] guys are working on so much innovation when you see a game like Ghostbusters get released where

[51:25] before it gets released we saw so much hype that the pin would have 10 times the innovation of

[51:31] any other pinball machine ever right and it gets released you guys like look at it be like yeah like

[51:36] there's some some things here and there but it's still just the same old concept that you guys are

[51:42] you know that the the the market place or the consumer it's like they don't even know what real

[51:48] innovation is or leap forward is they're they just keep accepting the same old

[51:52] sandwich as being a new thing and does that kind of get you guys frustrated at times as you know

[51:59] when you look at these things like where is the real innovation no I don't think so I think I think

[52:04] the fact that the industry uh incumbents the people building traditional machines and even the

[52:09] new manufacturers building traditional things I think it's great I think I think the pinball

[52:14] community uh likes their games and and I think they come out with cool things and certainly we all

[52:19] have our taste we all like one our package over another our package or one theme over another theme

[52:25] whether or not other companies deliver on an innovation promise it is kind of immaterial they're

[52:33] they're building games that they think people enjoy and the people are voting with their dollars

[52:38] and buying games what I do know is that if somebody wants to build technology like ours

[52:45] if somebody wants to you know track the ball as it rolls over the playfield and have it

[52:49] interacting with dynamic graphics if somebody wants to develop a machine that can accept

[52:56] modular components these game modules and and our modular button boxes and our upper playfield

[53:02] modules and all these things well first of all they got to deal with with with our patents and

[53:08] we have five or six patents pending that hopefully get granted and we protect our IP but

[53:14] even if they find other ways to do things I've been through the process now for years and years I

[53:19] know what it takes to build a machine with this kind of technology and it's not something that you

[53:24] can just you know go go spend a week or two in in your CAD development computer-rated design

[53:29] and tweak a couple things and build in this new technology it's not how it works we had to re-engineer

[53:34] the machine not because we wanted to but because it had to be done in order to support this

[53:38] this technology so it's it's not something that I get scared about because I don't think the other

[53:43] manufacturers are yet set up to do it unless they're doing something in secret that we don't know about

[53:48] it's not something that frustrates me because it if all the other manufacturers want to keep developing

[53:53] games the way they've been developing it just strengthens my viewpoint that we're doing something

[53:57] different and will be successful because of those differences sure no that makes sense um

[54:04] let's talk about developing for the platform right because a lot of what the proposition is

[54:11] long-term for purchase is is the fact that development can happen not just internally with your

[54:19] company Jerry but externally right that much like the video game industry almost like software

[54:24] developers will pop up to make games for the platform um how hard is it how much of a of a

[54:32] technological and uh he's sort of like a how how how difficult would be for someone who's got a

[54:39] game idea to to learn how to design for this thing yeah so we tried to model ourselves after

[54:47] yeah that video game industry or after the the cell phone industry where you go you know you

[54:53] can go buy an android phone or an iPhone you can get the developer kit and you can create

[54:56] applications for those things um we have a similar system and and we've because we developed the

[55:02] p-rock board and software frameworks for the p-rock we have experience here and we we've developed

[55:07] frameworks that people have used to create other games before um but i'll never say it's going to be

[55:12] easy um it's it's a challenge for one person or even a team of people to go and develop a pinball

[55:20] game for lots of reasons one is there you know it's it's multi-disciplined to build a cool game you

[55:26] have to develop your shot layout you have to develop the artwork you have to develop the sound

[55:31] the video the the game rules that there's a lot of things that go into making a game

[55:37] not just complete but fun um and it's a challenge to do that in this sense that it's it's a lot of

[55:44] work um we've tried to take all of the i call it the infrastructure or the uh the uh the boring

[55:51] stuff we've tried to do all of the the boring things that people have to put into a game to make it

[55:56] work and and we've basically rolled that into a development kit we have the of course we have the

[56:02] cabinet and the control system and all that stuff and we have a mechanical spec that defines the

[56:07] the shapes and the the the regions of the machine where people can add their modular components

[56:13] we we've defined the electrical interfaces where people can connect to our control system with

[56:18] you know driver board and switchboards to control the features they need um and then of course

[56:23] we've developed this set of of software libraries that do all of the things to control the machine

[56:30] that that one would need to do um everything we've done for the p3 up to this point all of the games

[56:36] we've developed or while we've developed and we've created these libraries that that we use to

[56:42] do all the low level functions to control the machine like our wall scoops module which is a set of

[56:47] features walls and scoops that pop up in the middle of the machine we have a module a software

[56:53] module built into a library that a software developer can just say you know raise wall one or raise

[56:59] wall two or raise scoop three and four and they can just make these these high level calls to our

[57:04] low level software framework to do these things so it's i'm not going to sit here and tell you it's

[57:10] going to be easy but i will tell you that we've done most of the hard work and we like to tell people

[57:15] that they can they can come in they can develop the fun they can add their game rules to our

[57:21] skeleton game where they can take the open source games that we're going to ship Lexi lights people

[57:26] be open source people can download the code and look at it they can download the code for rocks

[57:30] for barnyard for cannon lagoon and if they want to they can use those as templates for their own games

[57:36] um so so it's not super difficult in the sense that a developer uh an experienced software

[57:42] developer should be able to very easily take the system and develop software games for it then

[57:47] they have to find help on the mechanical side right and the mechanical guys since our playfields

[57:51] are pretty small the two by two the two by two piece of wood with stuff on it i mean they can go

[57:56] and build that system and find a friend to help them with the software so i i i don't think it's

[58:01] i don't think it's out of the realm of possibility of anybody right is there are other games currently

[58:07] in development outside of your company jerry that people are working on for for the platform

[58:13] yes you won't tell me what they are yes um yeah we've been talking to people for a long time now

[58:21] we've even talked to other manufacturers other pinball machine manufacturers about developing

[58:25] games for it um a couple of them are looking into it and then a lot of you know individuals and

[58:31] things individual people are actually starting to design games for it and when i when we talk about

[58:38] that i like to say that um i like to compare it to the uh i think i mentioned this up briefly

[58:42] earlier i like i i like to compare it to and think about the iphone market when the iphone first came

[58:49] out right there were there were a couple of apps and people were trying to explore what they could

[58:55] do with this phone but people who bought the phone they would go out and oh look there's a new app

[59:01] i'm buying it because it is something new i can do with this phone so the developers of the first

[59:06] few apps for the phone they sold their app to pretty much everyone who on the phone

[59:11] and that same thing will happen with the p3 right if if the first 100 people get machines

[59:17] and we will start working on our second development or our second production phase to to hit more of

[59:22] the the pre-order list and if someone comes out with a game right away then i would suspect that

[59:30] every hundred of those people already have a machine will buy it yeah i mean i mean when when you

[59:34] were talking about it and i think the comparison to video games is accurate it reminds me of the old

[59:39] days when you bought a system i think every member like when like dreamcast came out and those

[59:44] remember those older systems like they'd ship with like two or three games and that was it

[59:49] and and everyone who owned those systems played those games every day and the next title that hit

[59:54] everybody bought because you're you're you know hungry for another game to to to show the platform off

[01:00:01] um is there like just just hypothetically Jerry like i if i gave you a blank check and said

[01:00:08] what is there is there like a theme out there you would love to put on your platform because you

[01:00:13] just be like oh my god this would just work so perfect knowing how the the platform works with

[01:00:19] the screen and and the and the upper play field is there like a theme you would just love to put

[01:00:24] on there yes there is but i'm not i'm not gonna tell you what it is it's the monsters isn't it

[01:00:31] no uh okay so that's fair that's fair you know we could go on the forums and we could throw a list

[01:00:36] of themes up there and ask who wants to buy what or who's interested in what we could try to do some

[01:00:40] market research and you know what would happen of course because we're doing this research publicly

[01:00:45] everybody has access to the same information we do and somebody else would go by that license

[01:00:49] so it doesn't make sense for me no i believe i believe we have a couple of ideas that if we

[01:00:55] develop them into games they would be huge hits for all age groups oh cool yeah i

[01:01:03] okay i i i'll just leave it at that because i i i it was i just had to ask um okay so is there

[01:01:09] so another question i had Jerry so um another production or people were following was the wrath

[01:01:16] of Olympus and and they had they had an interesting model where they sort of figured out how many

[01:01:22] initial units they needed to sell to sort of make the project real do you guys have like a minimum

[01:01:28] you've got to hit to to get that initial order in and you feel confident based upon like your feedback

[01:01:34] and your response from people at shows and from just different people contacting you that you

[01:01:39] guys will get that sort of like initial user base out there and and and and be able to make it

[01:01:46] viable at the very beginning so you can order the parts and and make sure everything gets off the

[01:01:49] ground smoothly yeah so by the way Scott golech's the developer wrath of Olympus he uh he's been a

[01:01:55] developer with us too he's one of those guys who saw the platform and wanted to get involved

[01:01:59] early so he's great he helped us with lexie light speed he did all of our cabinet artwork for that

[01:02:04] he helped us with canna lagoon a little bit to helping us come up with some layout some uh

[01:02:09] shot layout concepts but yeah i i mean i think Scott was really smart about how he went about things

[01:02:14] it doesn't make sense for him to invest a lot of time and money if he can't make it financially

[01:02:19] um financially worth it to do so in our case yeah of course we we can't go out and build five

[01:02:26] machines and expect to make them to make any money on them because it'll cost 30,000 dollars to

[01:02:32] make each game um at the same time we have this we we have a limit and we have what we hope to build

[01:02:39] the first time and our pre-order list well exceeds that now but of course as we discussed earlier

[01:02:45] we don't know how many of those pre-order people are going to fall off when it comes time to

[01:02:50] for them to send the money in so i mean worst case that happened we run into the same boat

[01:02:55] where is we can't make machines and tell more people so enough to buy it but uh at least right now

[01:03:00] i'm pretty confident we're gonna well exceed that that initial order right well

[01:03:07] yeah i mean i think it's great that you've sort of done this whole project i mean i it's it's

[01:03:14] it takes a lot of courage to to look at something like a pinball machine that has pretty much

[01:03:20] remain the same for very long time and the in the current iteration of it has remained the same for

[01:03:26] almost 30 years now um to look at it and say look this machine isn't user friendly this machine does

[01:03:34] you know kids can't really jump on it um and there's just an ability to improve the way you can

[01:03:40] maintain a machine there's a way to improve um your ability to put new games into one unit um so

[01:03:47] you've you've you've taken on a lot of challenges at once oh based off of i think a lot of very smart

[01:03:53] insights around pinball um do you ever feel like maybe you know we should have just tried to go after

[01:03:59] a couple of these things at a time or versus like you sort of going at it all at once uh i i

[01:04:06] i think it's a character flaw um i tend to enjoy challenges i tend to get bored doing

[01:04:15] thinking about products that are similar to others with just a couple of little changes which by

[01:04:20] the way is how most industries evolve right most industries evolve by taking the existing products and

[01:04:25] tweaking one or two things and making it a little bit better moving forward uh that's that's

[01:04:30] probably the smarter way to go about things but that bores me um i'm i'm a i'm a technology guy i

[01:04:36] like to invent things i like to find new ways of doing things and that's what i've done here but

[01:04:42] i haven't done that just because just because that's what i like to do um i did that because i think

[01:04:48] the industry needs it i mean it's it's not a it's not a mystery it's not a surprise or it's it's

[01:04:55] just fact that the industry is switching from location based to consumers right we we can't go

[01:05:02] to arcades that much anymore i only have well we have pinballs here in austin texas which is a

[01:05:08] pretty big arcade but um when i moved here 20 years ago we had three or four different arcades

[01:05:14] with pinball machines and they had them in the bowling alleys and the bars and all those places

[01:05:17] don't have machines anymore so it's it's obviously true that the industry has shifted from locations

[01:05:24] to consumers people are going with their homes and traditional machines were designed for location

[01:05:30] and they make perfect sense for locations in arcades and places that have five or ten or fifteen

[01:05:35] games but they don't make sense for consumers they're too hard to maintain they're too complex

[01:05:39] they're they're all of these things that traditional games are now all of those things don't make

[01:05:45] sense for consumers so i came at it with with a fresh a fresh viewpoint and i tried to think about

[01:05:52] what i would want to see in a pinball machine a vibrant average consumer

[01:05:57] just shopping for a new thing to put in my game room and and it just matched right it the fact

[01:06:03] that we needed to do all these things to attract the consumer matched perfect with my interest

[01:06:08] in innovating with inventing with developing new hardware and software and and things to make

[01:06:13] it happen so so i it's definitely a huge risk and and my parents think i'm absolutely nuts to

[01:06:19] do this and you know what that's the only way i could really be happy you do you do you make

[01:06:26] your choices and you go for it and that's what we're going to do when i think every you know and

[01:06:31] jerry i think from the feedback i got from people talking about p3 and talking about

[01:06:37] your company is i think people are are very um you know drawn to your passion and and and

[01:06:44] they're supporting you i mean i there's a lot of support out there for this and we hope these

[01:06:50] people turn into customers you know i i think that uh this type of innovation uh can really you

[01:06:57] know work and and and if it's given a chance to breathe i think it's it's exciting to see what

[01:07:01] the future holds for it um what do you know if we were to talk a year from now what do you hope

[01:07:07] we'll be discussing if we're talking about p3 and multi-morphic

[01:07:11] what do i hope we'll be discussing or what do i expect we'll be discussing what well let's

[01:07:16] let's answer both of those well i expect we'll be discussing multi-morphic games i don't know three

[01:07:25] and four and how many new third-party developers are actually developing games for it what i

[01:07:32] hope we're discussing is the fact that people are obviously buying the game for their game room

[01:07:39] but that they are and other manufacturers are figuring out or learning or experiencing that the

[01:07:47] p3 is the machine that they need that that it's the one that makes sense for their game room it's

[01:07:52] the one that makes sense to develop for it's the one that makes it doesn't make sense i i said this

[01:07:57] earlier i don't think it makes sense for for how many are there now six or seven or eight new

[01:08:02] manufacturers or total manufacturers i mean there's even more than that i but i don't think anyone

[01:08:08] is a manufacturer and today manufacturer is something but yeah there's a lot of logo someone sent me

[01:08:14] a jpeg of all the companies out there that are it's a lot well i don't expect any i mean i don't

[01:08:23] expect all these companies will still be around any year or two years there's going to be some kind of

[01:08:30] a weeding out process some of these companies will do well some of them won't i obviously hope that

[01:08:34] we're one of the ones that do well i think we set ourselves up to do well i think we have the

[01:08:38] technology and the uh the support to do well it's just a matter of two things one people accepting

[01:08:46] the fact that these games are are uh or that the machine delivers the experience that they want

[01:08:52] and to that people develop games for it right and i hope obviously hope both of those things

[01:08:59] happen i i think they will right and and and jerry we definitely wish you well uh all of us

[01:09:05] being just me at canators pinball podcast but i know that a lot of people are wishing you well

[01:09:10] and i think you know my prediction is i think it's the the system is going to play out

[01:09:15] a lot like amh and i don't mean by volume i i think you're gonna one day start getting out there

[01:09:21] and people start seeing them in in in the collections i think it's going to start to build and build

[01:09:26] and build and i think that's why i think we're all sort of looking forward to uh the date that

[01:09:31] these can actually get into homes i think that's it's going to be an exciting period for you guys to

[01:09:36] see how that all transpires it's going to be exciting for consumers out there uh to have the option

[01:09:41] right i think all people want is the option to to buy and play pinball uh so what if for for fans

[01:09:50] out there for people looking to jump on the the p3 platform um what show are you going to be at next

[01:09:55] so people can keep a lookout yeah we're actually uh to address that specific point you just made

[01:10:02] we we believe that we will grow organically as well because this kind of system is one that has to be

[01:10:09] you have to touch it and feel and play it to really get it um in in fact i i gave my seminar and

[01:10:16] i introduced all these new games and i tell i told the story to a bunch of people right afterwards but

[01:10:21] i was watching people react to the new games at the seminar and i was speaking to a bunch of pinball

[01:10:25] enthusiasts showing games that were totally different than what they were used to and i could see

[01:10:30] in their eyes that it wasn't quite what they were hoping or expecting despite the fact that i

[01:10:35] tried to you know preface all my words with these games are different and they're they're simpler

[01:10:40] but then we went out into the game room and watched people play we watched people play canon

[01:10:44] lagoon and we watched people play rocks and i have never seen people smile playing a pinball

[01:10:52] machine like they did these games and i don't know i mean if you just try to try to think back and

[01:10:56] watch people play games think back to when you saw people playing whatever games whether they were

[01:11:01] new games from you they could have been lexie light speeder they could have been games from other

[01:11:05] many factors people either enjoy the games or they don't enjoy the games but i have never seen

[01:11:10] people smile when they play pinball yeah i know what that is i've i've you when they're in a group

[01:11:16] or playing against people they're like i just did something really cool and ha ha i did better

[01:11:19] than you whatever that makes me smile but just experiencing the game that they internalize it

[01:11:24] and all those emotions are internal they don't they don't hourly show their emotions but with

[01:11:29] canon lagoon and with rocks there were people that just kept coming back over and over and over again

[01:11:34] and they were smiling the entire time they were playing and it was it was crazy yeah no it's yeah

[01:11:39] i i i was funny i heard you say that i looked over all my photos from the text has been both

[01:11:45] festival ed you're right i mean when people get on these machines with this deep code and these

[01:11:50] complex things are trying to do they're so serious and it's almost like one of the reasons too

[01:11:55] like i i stopped playing in the pinball league in new york because it was so serious like it wasn't

[01:12:00] fun after a while i just want to and you know and i whenever i have like game nights in my arcade the

[01:12:06] machine that people the game people always play is is bust to move on neo geo which is just a simple

[01:12:10] puzzle game where you line up three of the same colored balls and they that's it and it like

[01:12:16] everyone jumps on it and it has a riot so i i i definitely think you experience that with

[01:12:22] the canon lagoon game and i think it's what pinball needs i i do agree i think people have gotten

[01:12:27] so lost in the complexity of all that everyone is just looking for this like really deep deep deep

[01:12:34] deep game and i yes there is a definite there's a market for that but that's like the hard core

[01:12:40] niche market and you could argue that all pinball is niche and hard core at this stage but i think

[01:12:45] you guys have something that can open it up to a whole new generation of players and i think guys

[01:12:51] you have a lot like a lot of pinball collections in their houses you have young kids i think you're

[01:12:56] the only option really you know for that age group but i mean i i agree with you i think i think

[01:13:03] other manufacturers would have a lot of trouble designing a game specifically for kids because it's

[01:13:07] a huge risk to build that full machine to you know spend the whole development cycle doing it

[01:13:12] and then shipping machine and and hoping that it's successful yeah you're you're going to be the

[01:13:17] gateway drug well i mean certainly that's a big part of our part of our business model and we're

[01:13:24] hoping to bring in new people and new players and attract different demographics to your other

[01:13:28] question we are trying to get as many people as we can to experience this machine because we know

[01:13:34] they have to so we are we just committed to going to i think it's six shows through the rest of the

[01:13:40] summer and then there of course more shows later on the year we're going to g's mgc midwest gaming

[01:13:46] classic here soon we're going to hit um we're going to Denver for the rocky mountain show we're

[01:13:53] going to fantastic up in Boston we're going to we're potentially going to have a machine at

[01:13:58] Alentown we're going to go to pinagogo in california we have a very busy schedule and we just want

[01:14:07] to get this machine for other people yeah no that's great um i'll probably see you at a couple of

[01:14:12] those shows i definitely will be a fantastic in Alentown so i hope i hope to catch you guys again soon

[01:14:19] well jerry wanted to thank you so much for coming on the podcast um for getting me a little bit

[01:14:25] over an hour of your time to talk about p3 multi morphek and just your vision for for this and

[01:14:31] what drove you to do it and um i i do congratulate you on on not listening to your parents and going

[01:14:38] forward with this venture um and you know we're rooting for this um i think it's going to be an

[01:14:44] interesting year i think uh consumers are excited by the options they're going to have and and

[01:14:49] and we hope that you know people find room for for p3 in their in their game rooms and in their

[01:14:54] households yeah thanks kris i i do appreciate your feedback i appreciate every little bit of support

[01:15:01] we get from everyone even the people that just look at the first time and have the you know that

[01:15:05] glimmer that sparkle their eye when they play it and we we certainly appreciate people like you

[01:15:09] supporting us and given us a platform to talk about it and helping generate some interest for

[01:15:14] us so thank you for that great and we will see you soon into show and for friendly listener the show

[01:15:20] you might as well pre-order it you know that you're not going to lose any money uh but be careful

[01:15:24] about some of those other pre-orders and um yeah i definitely recommend checking it out as jerry said

[01:15:29] it's one of those machines that don't listen to feedback unless you've jumped on it i think that's

[01:15:34] just true for all pinball i think we all can realize pinball is a very personal experience jump on it

[01:15:39] make your own opinions of it um and don't listen to what other people say enjoy it and it's it's

[01:15:46] it'll be a unique experience that's for sure so jerry thanks thanks again and we will see you real

[01:15:52] soon fantastic thank you kris all right take care all right well there you have it ladies and gentlemen

[01:15:58] that was my conversation with jerry from multi-morphic um i have to say in in in closing um i really do

[01:16:06] respect that he is trying to innovate something that has been sort of static for so many years

[01:16:13] and i do respect the fact that this company is building and innovating a pinball machine on their own

[01:16:19] dime and not taking money from people not stringing people along for years it may take years um

[01:16:25] to get this to market and it's taken them you know few years to get to this point um but there's no

[01:16:30] pain there's no agony there's no suffering involved with that and ultimately consumers will have

[01:16:35] the decision whether or not they enjoy p3 and multi-morphic whether or not they enjoy lexelite speed

[01:16:40] and the games that jerry is offering but that's how it should be make up your own mind on this

[01:16:45] machine and you it might not be for you but it might be for you um but when he's ready to send

[01:16:51] them out to consumers um that's the only time he'll ask for your money and i think that's the way

[01:16:56] it should be and i think all these other boutiques out there that are uh you know asking for pre-orders

[01:17:02] and trying to lock you in on elis and all this stuff whatever that's how they want to do it but

[01:17:08] um go check it out if you can and uh we will talk to you real soon have a great week in ladies and

[01:17:13] gentlemen
