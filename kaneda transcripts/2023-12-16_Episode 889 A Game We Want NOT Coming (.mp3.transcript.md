[00:00] Hey, so easy, easy, easy, when everybody's trying to please me, baby.

[00:06] Hey, so easy, easy, when everybody's trying to please me.

[00:11] Sitter, sitter, sitter, sitter, sitter, sitter, sitter.

[00:30] I was not able to get the show up yesterday, I was really busy, but let's just get right to it and talk pinball.

[00:36] And look, for everyone listening to this show, please go to the Facebook page.

[00:40] There is a fun People's Choice Awards happening right now.

[00:44] My goal is to get 1,000 people to vote in each category.

[00:50] We have until next Friday until the polls will shut down, and then Jengus and I will do a recap show

[00:57] where we discuss where the chips will fall.

[01:00] And what I like about this show is everybody's included but me.

[01:04] I took my name off the ballot. You know why? I don't want to be accused of being biased or trying to give myself an award.

[01:11] I will never be eligible for another Twippy in the history of planet Earth now.

[01:17] They revealed to the world that if you've won a prior Twippy, you will not be eligible to win again.

[01:25] Tom Brady can't win more than one Super Bowl. Michael Jordan, one championship, and then you're done.

[01:32] Let Carl Malone have one. You know, this is the problem with the modern world, and I'm not going to get into it.

[01:39] It's silly that people who make these decisions are making themselves seem silly, and I think come next year,

[01:46] we need to all just get over this stuff, lighten up.

[01:50] I don't know what people do to lighten up these days. Maybe they need to smoke a little something.

[01:54] Maybe they need to get a little hanky-panky from the Mrs.

[01:58] and everyone just needs to stop fighting over this mountain of dirt and just respect people who are putting in the effort and doing the work.

[02:05] And it's okay if we recognize people. It's okay if people want to win an award.

[02:11] It's okay. It's just pinball people. It's not rocket science.

[02:14] Alright, so let's talk about pinball. I'm going to give you an exclusive bit of news that I wish was better news.

[02:20] I'm here to confirm for you. I have 100% confirmation that our friends over at Barrels of Fun,

[02:28] they are not working on the fifth element pinball.

[02:33] This rumor has been spreading for a while. It is not happening.

[02:38] I'm not surprised it's not happening. Getting Bruce Willis and his likeness into a pinball machine is not something we will see.

[02:46] It seems really difficult. Same with Tom Cruise and especially with what's going on with Bruce Willis and his health condition.

[02:54] I highly doubt his family is concerned about him being immortalized in pinball format.

[03:00] And it is a shame because the fifth element and diehard would be two of the greatest themes you could ever put into pinball format.

[03:09] And I think that's what people just want.

[03:12] They want to get themes that just speak to us, that make us want to hand over some money.

[03:18] And so we're going to see in a few days whether or not Jaws has that kind of power.

[03:23] Now, I think Jaws is going to sell out on day one of those 1000LEs.

[03:28] I think after two years of mediocre games at best, everyone's waiting for Keith Elwyn's masterpiece is what I'm hearing it is.

[03:36] I was wrong about a teaser going up yesterday, but this game will be at CES.

[03:42] That is what I am hearing and CES is January 9th.

[03:46] So maybe they are waiting that week.

[03:48] January 9th is a Tuesday.

[03:51] So maybe we're going to see it the Friday before then.

[03:55] So that means we've got about three weeks to go.

[03:58] And I implore each and every one of you, if you're thinking of buying anything right now,

[04:03] you might as well just wait three weeks and see what happens.

[04:07] You're not going to have a hard time getting a Texas Chainsaw Massacre or a Looney Tunes.

[04:12] You're sure as heck not going to have a hard time getting an Elton John.

[04:16] And there's still Elvira blood kiss editions in boxes sitting at distros.

[04:21] And now we're seeing that Jurassic Park 30th Anniversary Edition is selling for $2,000 off instantly.

[04:28] Like it's now an $11,000 game overnight.

[04:31] And so just wait it out. People have some patience, drink some eggnog,

[04:36] spend some time with your childhood friends, like go to the local pub and just wait it out.

[04:42] I also think the holidays is a really good time for everybody to turn off Pinside for a couple weeks,

[04:49] become a normal adult again, stop saying hateful things about Canada on podcasts.

[04:55] And I think starting in January and I mean this, I think everybody needs to just move on

[05:00] and celebrate pinball, call pinball companies out when they make mistakes.

[05:05] I think we need to get back to a place in which the topics that we talk about are only pinball related

[05:11] and not the personalities in pinball.

[05:14] Now what I love about the People's Choice Awards, I've heard from so many people that are just happy to be on those polls.

[05:22] And so if I missed you, please let me know.

[05:25] The polling is open until next Friday.

[05:28] It's kind of funny because with some of these categories, I made it so people could add an option if I missed it.

[05:35] Instead of adding it in, like people could write in what they wanted to be voted on.

[05:39] They just put it in the comments section and I get it.

[05:42] This is the first time we've done it this way, but I'm just happy at the end of the year.

[05:46] We're going to be able to see what people loved and I'm happy that we have stuff like the Pulp Fiction Topper.

[05:52] You can vote on that.

[05:54] That topper is not going to change and we've seen it now for like nine months.

[05:58] The art package on Elton John.

[06:00] This is crazy.

[06:01] Elton John art package is beating out Foo Fighters as the best art package in pinball in 2023.

[06:09] I mean, it makes sense.

[06:10] The game came out.

[06:11] The art is not going to change.

[06:13] So why would we have to wait an entire another year?

[06:17] Why would we delay people's ability to say, hey, this is the most beautiful game even if I'm not going to buy one?

[06:23] This is the most beautiful game in pinball right now.

[06:26] Poor Mr. Franchi.

[06:27] Did you see what he did yesterday?

[06:29] He uploaded on Facebook an image of a big Lebowski anniversary edition art package that he was working on.

[06:37] And yes, it looked really cool.

[06:39] But in the very post, he said that Universal SHIT Candid.

[06:45] And I was like, why is he like yelling at the license holder like this in this cranky manner?

[06:50] And I said this on my Facebook Live earlier.

[06:52] Franchi, you're an incredible artist.

[06:55] Your stuff looks great on pinball machines.

[06:57] I own one of your machines.

[06:59] You need to be more professional now.

[07:02] You're working with all these companies.

[07:04] And if you don't get your way or some game doesn't get green lit because the license holder doesn't want to do it,

[07:10] it's not your place to share this artwork out in the world.

[07:14] He's deleted the post, but the damage is still done to his reputation

[07:18] as someone who's a bit of a loose cannon in the pinball space.

[07:22] And this is coming from the ultimate loose cannon in the pinball space, Canada.

[07:26] And maybe it's because Franchi and I have that Italian blood inside us.

[07:30] And for those of you who are Italian, you know that there's something inside our veins that's just a little bit different.

[07:37] We tend to get triggered easily and we snap back.

[07:40] I find it funny that people love the Godfather movie.

[07:42] And then when you are Italian and you act a little bit like that, everyone's like, how dare you?

[07:46] How dare you, you bully?

[07:48] I'm going to just destroy you and then go enjoy that movie and love everything about Godfather too.

[07:53] All right, so we've got no fifth album in.

[07:56] We've got Elton John Pinball is on the line.

[07:59] Stranger Things Premium is on the line.

[08:02] And everyone is still just waiting for Jaws.

[08:04] Stranger Things Premium, it looks good.

[08:06] I really hope the quality of the game is better than I've seen on some of these Elvira's

[08:12] and some of these other stern machines they've been making recently.

[08:15] The stuff coming off the line in the new factory is not as good as the stuff that was coming out of the old factory.

[08:22] So it just begs the question, like is Stern's quality control, is it where it needs to be?

[08:28] Are they rushing these games out?

[08:30] At these prices, they can't rush these games out.

[08:33] They got to make sure that people are not unboxing $13,000 Elvira's and the game's not working right.

[08:39] They got to make sure they don't release code like Batman 66 code

[08:43] and people are playing their games that they've enjoyed for years

[08:46] and all of a sudden you do a code update and now your game is getting bricked.

[08:50] You can't go one step forward, two steps back.

[08:53] It's like, and the only reason they're doing these code updates is so they can spy on everybody's machines

[08:58] with this insider connected stuff.

[09:00] You know the next move they're going to make when they go Spike 3 System,

[09:04] which I think is going to happen when they do the remake of Metallica with an LCD screen.

[09:09] I think that's what you're going to see, Metallica Anniversary, LCD screen, Spike 3 System,

[09:14] all new sound system, all new 4K video.

[09:17] I think you're going to see downloadable content happening in Pinball.

[09:21] I think that's Stern's ultimate plan.

[09:23] Get everybody signed up, get everybody connected, and now you're going to start buying a game.

[09:28] You're not even going to get the full game when you spend $13,000 on it.

[09:32] They're going to want you to spend extra and extra to get the things that would have normally been in the game years ago

[09:38] when these games were half as much money.

[09:40] And I think that's the big thing, man.

[09:42] I think everyone's watching what's going on, and they're just wondering,

[09:45] like, is Stern going to go down that ultra greedy road?

[09:48] And if they do, it opens the door for everybody else.

[09:52] It opens it up for Jersey Jack.

[09:53] I mean, Jersey Jack, talk about a company that can't figure out how to connect its games.

[09:57] It's Jersey Jack Pinball.

[09:58] How long have they gone without Scorbit?

[10:00] They seemingly still have no answer to the replacement of Scorbit.

[10:04] So the door will be open for them if Stern gets too greedy.

[10:07] But unfortunately for Jersey Jack, they're just way overpriced.

[10:10] Like, everything about them right now is overpriced.

[10:12] Nobody's buying Elton John at this much money.

[10:15] Everyone's lost money on Godfather and Toy Story 4.

[10:18] So we'll see what's going to happen.

[10:20] I mean, think about it right now.

[10:21] It's December.

[10:22] Nobody's buying Elton John.

[10:24] It's on the line, but who's ordering this game?

[10:27] These things are going to stockpile at distributors, and then what?

[10:30] Distributors are going to have to sell these things out the back door

[10:33] We're witnessing now all this matte pricing BS where everybody knows

[10:37] that a distro bought Elton John Platinum for $10,000 or $9,500.

[10:42] And we know they're not going to get anywhere near $12,000 for this game consistently.

[10:48] And you can't force these distros to have to open up games and stream them

[10:53] and then sell them used.

[10:54] Like, why can't a distro, seeing the market conditions on a game,

[10:59] say, hey, look, we've got 15 Elton John Platinum's in a box.

[11:03] The market value on them is $11,000.

[11:05] No one's paying 12.

[11:07] You can get $1,000 off and come get one today.

[11:10] The moment one distro does that, all of them will have to do it.

[11:14] But isn't that better?

[11:15] Like, move some product because the game's on the line.

[11:18] Have to go somewhere.

[11:19] And if you move the product out the door, it takes the pressure off the distributors

[11:23] and gives them some capital so they can go buy your next game.

[11:26] But if distros just keep stockpiling these games,

[11:29] their money's tied up in an asset that's underwater and it doesn't work.

[11:33] So it's going to be really interesting to see what happens in 2024.

[11:37] I think the distros are going to have to get together.

[11:39] And I think they're going to have to put some pressure and collude against some of these high prices.

[11:44] It's just not going to work.

[11:45] You know, JAWS is not going to bail out the entire industry because there's only one JAWS.

[11:50] What happens after that?

[11:51] If Sternes to make 500 games a week or more,

[11:54] I mean, they're going to get through the JAWS allotment in a couple months.

[11:57] And then what?

[11:58] And then what happens if the next game is not a big hit like JAWS?

[12:01] I mean, even thinking about Metallica coming back,

[12:03] there's probably 5000 Metallica machines in the world right now.

[12:08] So you bring it back, you make it nicer.

[12:11] Then what happens?

[12:12] Everyone who has a Metallica and loves one, are they going to try to sell theirs for how much?

[12:18] Then you're going to have hundreds of Metallica machines going up for sale

[12:22] so these people can buy the new one.

[12:24] Oversaturating the market.

[12:26] I'm really worried Stern is going to do a dangerous dance in which they might collapse everything

[12:32] by oversaturating, overpricing in a climate in which demand will shrink at these prices.

[12:39] I think they're smart to cancel the Godzilla Anniversary Edition because it's too soon.

[12:43] Like that game just came out.

[12:45] That game only came out two years ago and they've been running Godzilla since.

[12:49] They might do it five years from now, like a 75th anniversary.

[12:52] Everybody, what do you think?

[12:54] Like what do you really think?

[12:55] Do you think pinball at these prices, where things are headed in the world and economically?

[13:01] Do you think there's another five year run of this?

[13:04] I don't know.

[13:05] It's really hard to think that over the next five years, this hobby can continue to absorb these prices.

[13:12] I don't know.

[13:13] You know, I definitely feel like all these companies won't survive.

[13:16] There's like 12 companies right now trying to get our money.

[13:20] And when I was doing this, like people's choice awards and I laid all the games on the table,

[13:25] here's everything that came out in 2023.

[13:28] It really was a bit underwhelming.

[13:30] The themes across the board were underwhelming.

[13:33] The mechanical magic in the games was a bit underwhelming.

[13:37] You don't hear people talk about pinball moments really in any of these games.

[13:41] I never really hear anyone say like, oh yeah, that game, that moment.

[13:46] You know, when you talk to people about Lord of the Rings, they're like there and back again.

[13:49] I just don't feel like people are sharing these modes and like I can't wait to get to this and that.

[13:54] Maybe they are.

[13:55] Maybe they're doing it in the club threads.

[13:57] Maybe we need to make that a pinball poll category.

[14:00] What is the most magical moment in a pinball game in 2023?

[14:05] I might add that up this week and make it a write in poll.

[14:09] I think that's kind of a fun one to add.

[14:11] What's the most magical moment in a pinball machine in 2023?

[14:17] And I need your help to write it in.

[14:19] The reason I need your help to write it in is I haven't been able to play a ton of pinball this year

[14:24] because most of the new games have not made their way to New York City.

[14:28] Most of the new games I've only been able to play at shows a few times

[14:31] and they've been loud and hard to get a lot of time on them.

[14:34] And that's just been the reality.

[14:35] I mean, I'm in New York City.

[14:37] This is where the Godfather takes place.

[14:40] There is not a Godfather pin on location in New York City.

[14:44] Maybe there's one at Sunshine now, but I've had zero time in this city on the Godfather.

[14:50] No time on Galactic Tank Force.

[14:52] No time on Scooby-Doo.

[14:54] The only two games I've really played have been Foo Fighters and what else is their Toy Story 4,

[15:00] which I think is last year's game.

[15:02] So nothing new.

[15:03] Nothing new for Canada.

[15:04] Everybody, we are at the end of the year.

[15:06] I really want everybody to take the next couple of weeks and don't overinvest in pinball.

[15:11] Don't overthink pinball.

[15:13] We're going to get Jaws.

[15:14] When Jaws happens, let's all come back to the party.

[15:17] When Jaws is revealed, let's all jump into the ring and debate it, talk about it, celebrate it,

[15:22] say what we love, say what we don't.

[15:24] Like, let's wait for that moment, though.

[15:26] Until then, I implore each and every one of you,

[15:28] spend time this holiday really, really focused on your friends and on your family

[15:34] and enjoying the holiday season.

[15:36] Be present.

[15:37] It is really easy to sit on a couch and just whip open your phone

[15:41] and log on to Pinside or Facebook pinball groups and not be present with your family.

[15:47] Be watching those movies.

[15:48] Like, watch Christmas Vacation.

[15:50] Watch Die Hard.

[15:51] Don't do it double screening.

[15:53] Be very present.

[15:54] Brenda's sisters are coming in next week,

[15:57] so you might not see as many shows from me over the next couple of weeks,

[16:01] but you're going to get some good shows.

[16:03] I'm still going to do it, but let's face it.

[16:05] Other than the Pimball People's Choice Awards,

[16:07] if we don't get a new game reveal, there's not a ton going on right now.

[16:12] Everyone should just wind down and be present with their families.

[16:15] There was one thing I would like from all of you for Christmas this year,

[16:19] and we are so close.

[16:21] I just want to hit 700 legit subscribers by Christmas Day.

[16:27] We are at 692.

[16:30] That means just eight more people.

[16:33] If just eight of you get a friend to join this show,

[16:36] you could even create another email address and just sign up again.

[16:39] But that would be the ultimate Christmas gift for Canada.

[16:43] I've taken a lot of arrows this year.

[16:45] We're still chugging along.

[16:46] We're still making the best pinball podcast on the planet.

[16:49] And then now that there's no award shows,

[16:51] maybe everybody needs to stop branding themselves as the favorite and the best.

[16:56] And maybe we all just do our own thing and may the chips fall where they may.

[17:01] But there's a reason why 692 people support this show.

[17:05] It's because I think we call it like it is, and we're balanced and we're fair,

[17:10] and we're not that terrible army of people everyone tries to label us.

[17:15] Happy holidays, everybody.

[17:17] More shows coming next week.

[17:19] Thank you again for the support and much love from myself and Killian and Brenda

[17:24] to your families.

[17:26] May all of you have a very happy and healthy holidays.

[17:30] Canada out. Take us away, Axel.
