[00:00] Oh baby, no baby, you got me wrong baby, my baby's already got all of my love

[00:07] So no, no honey, I'm good, I can have another better probably

[00:11] Should not, I got somebody at home and it's my stay, I might not leave it alone

[00:20] Uh oh, Canadian Spinball Podcast might know Stern's next title and Spooky Pimball's next title

[00:26] I know they've done such a good job of keeping these titles a secret but the secret might be

[00:33] out of the bag and the last person any of these companies want to have in his possession

[00:40] The title of their next game is Canadian Spinball Podcast will I spoil all of their hard work?

[00:46] Will I spoil the big reveal moment for these companies or will I let them after years of working

[00:53] on these games? Have the moment that they work so hard for? Is Canadian going to be a hypocrite

[00:59] because he spoiled Hot Wheels well before Hot Wheels? Has he spoiled Toy Story? Nobody spoiled Toy

[01:06] Story or Guns and Roses because we knew those titles were coming so on Episode 571 of Canadian Spinball

[01:13] Podcast I want to maybe give you some round about details about what I know of Stern's next game

[01:19] and Spooky Pimball's next game. Yes, I am hearing rumors. Now these are rumors that are coming from

[01:25] a very reliable source but now it all makes sense why each of these companies are making these titles.

[01:33] Now what I can do and what I will do is I will debunk some of the rumors that have been out there

[01:39] in the world so if you think this game is coming out and it's this theme I will tell you some of

[01:45] the major themes that people are thinking it's going to be are not going to be what's coming out

[01:51] next from each of these companies. Are you confused by that? I'm somewhat confused by that as well.

[01:55] So happy to have you guys here at Saturday morning. I know I haven't done as many podcasts as I normally do.

[02:01] Works been kind of crazy. Got a new boss. Got a lot of new stuff going on so I'm just trying to

[02:06] manage being a new father as well. Trying to manage the pandemic. Trying to keep my body in shape

[02:12] and trying to figure out how much dogecoin do I need to buy to never work again. It's crazy.

[02:17] I just put a few thousand dollars in dogecoin like a few months ago and half a sudden now it's

[02:22] basically paying for my Guns and Roses collector's edition. It's stupid. This whole crypto thing.

[02:26] Look I think Bitcoin is going to be a real thing and you should invest in it for the long term.

[02:30] But man some of these daily gains on some of these altcoins are incredible. Incredible. If you're a

[02:37] gambling man I highly suggest you get into some of this crypto madness because you could either be

[02:42] on the outside and complain about it or you could be on the inside and be cashing in. I mean I'm

[02:47] just going to tell you right now if we all bought and I mean all of us out there if all of us out

[02:52] there a year ago instead of buying a pinball machine instead of buying Ninja Turtles if we all bought

[02:59] dogecoin one year ago one thousand dollars in dogecoin a year ago is now worth sixty thousand

[03:08] dollars this week for one thousand dollars so do the math and you tell me pinball is a good investment

[03:15] but you can't look at life this way you can't look at these investments this way we have to

[03:19] enjoy life so let's move on to pinball I want to go through the news in the industry right now and

[03:24] then I will get to some roundabout ways to talk about spooky and stern next titles and next themes

[03:31] okay and here's the thing I'm going to say right now these are juggernaut themes one is obviously

[03:35] much bigger than the other and you can guess which company has that one and this is why I'm excited

[03:41] about the summer of pinball because there are some themes coming out that a lot of you are going

[03:46] to love they're going to be games that are going to come out and these are going to be more games

[03:50] in which they're going to sell out in one hour or two hours and everyone they make they're going

[03:55] to be spoken for right away and if you thought your money was safe if you thought you were spending

[04:00] enough on pinball already trust me on this you are going to have themes put out there that is

[04:07] probably going to try to get more of your money out of your wallet and into these pinball companies

[04:13] and I also say this all of these boutique companies that can't figure it out it's game over it is

[04:19] absolutely game over there is no room anymore for these pinball companies that can't get their

[04:25] act together you can't compete it is going to be as I predicted this industry is dominated by stern

[04:33] by jersey jack and spooky pinball everybody else is so far behind these companies and how you do it

[04:40] and how you get it done and how you execute okay so we're going to talk about these new titles but

[04:46] I just want to say the three horse race is really what's driving pinball right now everybody else

[04:53] everybody else is just lagging behind and I mean that you're lagging behind American pinball

[04:58] you're lagging behind Chicago gaming company you're lagging behind p3 multi morphing you're lagging

[05:03] behind pinball brothers Dutch pinball who else am I missing the punny pinball factory who else am I

[05:08] missing in this mix of games so many people are lagging behind deep root pinball can't even get one

[05:13] game made the joke just keeps even getting bigger and bigger and bigger but it's a joke even to talk

[05:17] about deep root they can't even get one machine out all right so let's start on one thing and that

[05:23] is the pinball brothers have made some alien games and on the pinball brothers Facebook page they

[05:29] uploaded a video of six alien machines in a row ready to go to customers which is great so I want

[05:36] to say the fact that the pinball brothers are getting it done and making this game is a good thing

[05:42] okay I know that I've had my critiques about the game itself in terms of how it looks and the

[05:48] package itself and I will say seeing all six of them lined up didn't make it six times better

[05:53] it still looks really underwhelming I'm still not impressed by this package at all I still think

[05:59] the game looks really underwhelming and I think the gameplay looks underwhelming and I think the

[06:04] package looks underwhelming I mean the game itself just looks ugly and there's no reason why

[06:10] an alien pinball machine should be ugly and that's it I mean when I saw all six I'm like cool they're

[06:16] working cool they finally showed us the Xeno head working it works it still has that awkward moment

[06:22] when it pulls the ball over the targets it kind of bobbles the ball a little bit they didn't fix that

[06:26] so it's like it's all there though it is working you will get a working Xeno head and I think the

[06:32] fact that they finally figured out a way to make Andrew highways game a working game they fixed a

[06:38] lot of the mechanical issues is good news to people I hope all of you people that highway burned

[06:43] get a game and get a game at a price that you're happy with man imagine if you put that money in

[06:48] Dogecoin no we can't do it we can't do it we can't keep relating all pinball purchases to Dogecoin

[06:54] we will go mad we all would have been millionaires it's crazy like two years ago if we didn't buy a

[07:00] pinball machine if we just put one sternally and this is crazy one sternally into Doge you'd be like

[07:07] 1.5 million up instead of a sternally I know we're all kicking ourselves we're all kicking ourselves okay

[07:12] I'm gonna go back to this so pinball brothers is getting it done the games are going out they're

[07:17] gonna slowly roll out I don't know how many they can make though and you know that's the other

[07:21] question how many games a week can the pinball brothers make with this Italian manufacturer I'm not

[07:26] sure six games doesn't make me feel like it's super efficient but they are getting it done but I'm

[07:33] also not that excited about this game when you watch the gameplay video I mean go look at the

[07:37] video they put up go look at the actual gameplay footage it looks so underwhelming the balls are

[07:43] just kind of floating around it's all wide open it's a wide open wide body game and without

[07:49] helped in standing over this game saying how amazing it is and how it's the best game ever I think

[07:55] people when it comes to alien I think the atmosphere of the game is really cool I know of the music

[08:00] is amazing I know the sound effects are great I know that the callouts are really awesome but the

[08:05] gameplay itself I'm curious to see what people think about the gameplay of alien as more people get

[08:11] this game because remember most people never got their alien and most people haven't played this

[08:16] game working it was always broken at shows so we will finally get a working alien for the community

[08:23] to react to which is good news you know I was gonna move on the Dutch pinball next but I don't

[08:28] think there's any real Dutch pinball news over at American pinball I once again am wondering where

[08:34] is the next title from American pinball this would have been a perfect window I have not heard back

[08:40] from David fix about accepting my offer to join the show I will reach out to him and Michael

[08:46] Grant to see if we can get American pinball on this show doing interviews is harder for me so if

[08:51] we can make it happen it better be worthwhile you know we've proven over the last year we don't

[08:56] need interviews to win twitties we don't need interviews with George Gomez with Gary Stern with

[09:00] Ed Robertson with all these people we don't need zombie Eddie I mean I love all these people I think

[09:06] these people do great stuff in pinball but the fact is majority of them the majority of them are not

[09:12] allowed to come on canators pinball podcasts just think about that for a minute the majority of these

[09:17] grown men who work over at Stern and work on pinball Ed Robertson won't come on the show I love you

[09:23] Ed Robertson I know you're listening right now Ed's afraid to come on the show because of how it

[09:28] will make him look to his buddies at Stern zombie Eddie can't come on because of the stuff I've

[09:33] said about Stern Zach Sharp won't come on George Gomez won't come on they've all been reached out to

[09:39] over the last year and they all said no and they all appeared on the super awesome pinball show and

[09:45] they did great interviews the super awesome pinball show they did those interviews are great they asked

[09:51] all the tough questions we all wish those interviews would happen when the show began we didn't have

[09:56] to go through an hour of stuff to get to them but that's how they wanted to do the show but those

[10:01] interviews were great but you know you know the best interviewer in pinball is canada and my door

[10:08] is always open for these people to come on but they're not going to come on because I'm about to

[10:12] somewhat somewhat spoil what their plans are and this is why you love canators pinball podcasts

[10:18] because you would rather me tell you stuff you know they don't want me to tell you then to have

[10:25] them come on here and justify thousand dollar toppers and justify these prices and talk about stuff

[10:31] as if like oh yeah it's really hard canada getting all the licenses and the assets and we had to

[10:36] put that Jeep like that in Jurassic Park and we couldn't I don't buy any of that I don't buy any of

[10:41] it for the prices of these games they could get more into these games okay so what's next so before I

[10:46] go on to what is next from Stern and spooky I also wanted to talk about my first impression of

[10:54] guns and roses collector's edition because my friend Steven Jacobson in New York City he got a

[11:00] collector's edition delivered to him by coin taker this week and I want to give a very special shout

[11:06] out to an amazing couple who does the white glove service for coin taker I want to give a shout out

[11:12] to Erica and Andy who set up my friends game it was really nice meeting both of you and I'm so happy

[11:19] that he was able to get his game set up by people who know what they're doing because trust me my

[11:24] friends the biggest guns and roses fan but he has no idea he has no idea how to set up a pinball

[11:30] machine he has no idea how to adjust the tilt he has no idea how to do this how to do that how to

[11:36] download the code how to set up the top and believe me a lot of people who get into pinball a very

[11:43] very large amount of people who buy games are buying their first game or maybe their second game in

[11:49] a very long time but they're not people who wake up every day and want to work on pinball machines

[11:54] now my friend has the data east guns and roses right next to the new one now let me give you my

[11:59] impressions of seeing the collector's edition for the first time so without a doubt this in my mind

[12:05] is the second most beautiful pinball machine I've ever stood over the second most I still consider

[12:12] the magic girl that john pop a duke made that doesn't work to be the most aesthetically pleasing

[12:18] pinball machine I've ever stood over it's just something about that game the zombie Eddie artwork the

[12:24] way it pops the way it comes at you though even like the screen and all the weird stuff going on

[12:29] in magic girl makes it so interesting to look at it's the worst game ever though it's the worst

[12:35] game on planet earth do not do not go after one even if you think it's going to be a collectible it's

[12:42] the worst pinball experience second to that game is this guns and roses collectors edition and my god

[12:49] I think the one word that came to mind is this thing is bling like it's shiny it's got gold sparkle

[12:57] everything about it the armor it's just perfect in a lot of ways they really went over this game

[13:03] and they made sure that this collector's edition it's just beautiful everything about it is very

[13:08] cohesive I love the color selection I love the armor I love the skull on the shooter rod I love

[13:14] the roses by the action button I love the glossiness of the rad cows I love the gold sparkle

[13:21] playfield is just one of these things you don't understand how amazing it is until you actually

[13:27] stand over it and with the lights in this game the way the lights hit those sparkles it's just I

[13:33] I really I know you guys with the LEDs want to feel great and you should feel great it's still a

[13:39] masterpiece game and you should feel good about your Ellie but this CE is such a level above any

[13:47] other game I think Jersey Jack's ever done I think it's the nicest Jersey Jack game by far

[13:52] and it's also probably maybe the nicest pinball machine ever I it's the nicest pinball machine

[13:58] that works ever in terms of what it looks like and the overall package of the game now for some of

[14:03] you out there you're like canada this is not a work of art this is a pinball machine what was it

[14:08] like to play it and did you enjoy it again playing it in a home environment now I'm going to be

[14:14] completely canned it right now and I'm going to be completely canned it and do not say that

[14:18] canada's flip flopping on his love of guns roses because I'm not but I want to be honest with you

[14:23] the day I went over to my friends house the day I met Andy and Erica it was a really busy work day

[14:29] and it was a really stressful work day and I was actually doing a lot of work while they were setting

[14:34] it up I was on conference calls we went to lunch we had a rush through launch I had to get back

[14:38] for another conference call I'm working on creative ideas that weren't working so well so I

[14:44] was really stressed out and when you're really stressed out and you're really not in a great mood

[14:49] jumping on a pinball machine won't make you feel better doesn't make me feel better and so here I

[14:55] am it's the middle of the work day like I'm I'm juggling all this stuff and I really wasn't able to

[15:00] just absorb the game I wasn't able to walk up to it I wasn't able to walk up to it in a mood

[15:07] in which I wanted to sort of just lose myself in the game and I think for a lot of us out there

[15:12] you know it's like when you see a movie and you're not in a good mood and you don't really like

[15:16] the movie maybe because something happened in your personal life something happened at work

[15:20] and you just really can't enjoy the content in front of you the way it's supposed to be enjoyed

[15:25] with open mind and open heart and so because of that I was kind of like only played like maybe

[15:31] five games with him but here's my take on it after five games the game shoots tremendously well

[15:37] I'm so tired of seeing people saying like the shots and guns and roses are not there that there's

[15:43] no this there's no flow there's no that there's nothing to shoot at there's nothing to hit that is

[15:49] not the truth in my book my observations of playing guns and roses is there is a lot to shoot

[15:55] and most of the shots in the game are very smooth and the game itself is like absolutely I still

[16:01] think it's a masterpiece in its presentation I really do now look obviously playing it more and

[16:06] having seen this game for a few months now obviously some of that honeymoon phase is wearing off a

[16:11] little bit and the light shows you get used to it you get used to everything over time and so

[16:16] didn't have the same like oh my god I can't believe I'm seeing this for the first time because I'm

[16:20] not seeing it for the first time I've seen it before so there was that part of it like it didn't

[16:24] you know I wasn't whiskey and hand I wasn't drinking beer I wasn't ready to walk up to a rock

[16:29] concert in a box the other thing that I'm starting to feel a little bit with guns and roses is now

[16:34] all of us out there who have one and want to get into this game now we have to go learn what

[16:40] this game is all about because it's much more than just starting a song and seeing pretty lights

[16:46] and when you play the game and I could tell this like as my friend was like a casual who just got

[16:51] the game delivered it's not the easiest game to understand it's not the most intuitive game out there

[16:58] there's a lot going on on the screen there's a lot of shots in the game there's a lot of inserts

[17:04] there's a lot flashing at you all the time it's not easy like the way Keith makes these games the

[17:10] level the learning curve to get into them is so high for the casual player that I almost felt bad

[17:17] for my friend because I'm like I don't really know where to start other than okay by your third

[17:22] ball you'll probably be able to start a song if you just hit the scoop I was explaining to him

[17:27] where all the band members were and how to do that and you got to collect the band members and

[17:31] you got to do this but then you get into like the different layers of patches and how to lock balls

[17:37] and pyro and lights and it's a lot it really is a lot and it requires a degree of understanding that

[17:44] you know what most people are just are like what like I don't I just like can I play can I flip can

[17:49] I experience something fun and so that's the reason why I think a lot of Jersey Jack games are

[17:55] peeling to homeowners because there is so much in it there is so much that will make this game

[18:01] a a long lasting game in your collection but it's also still very intimidating I was surprised

[18:06] at how even myself was very kind of confused as things were happening and all this stuff is going on

[18:13] now that I'm seeing more of what's in the game I do wish it was still a little bit simpler and maybe

[18:19] I'm still in love with the simplicity of a game like Batman 66 which has a lot in it but it's a lot

[18:26] easier to understand in Batman what I'm doing like where those things are like where those shots are

[18:33] to do stuff and I think in these games because there's so much you know you don't really know you

[18:38] don't really know like what doors do I need to get through how many doors are there how many shots

[18:44] how many combos what do I have to hit where it's all very very very underwhelming at first now

[18:50] I'm not going to indict this game as being like overly confusing and like it just turns me off

[18:55] but this has always been a little bit of a problem for Jersey Jack Pimball and I think it continues

[18:59] to be a bit of a problem for Jersey Jack Pimball is their games just aren't immediately satisfying

[19:05] because there's so much confusion going on and this game gets around that a little bit for obvious

[19:11] reasons because at least you're going to start a song if anything you will most likely experience

[19:16] the magic of a song and a mode and a light show because of how the game is coded but man everything

[19:24] else everything else you need to do in the game or the objectives of this game it's just not that

[19:29] intuitive and it doesn't jump out at you the other thing I noticed is there's a lot of lights that

[19:35] we love in this game and there's so much going on and it is beautiful it also does create

[19:40] someone of a level of confusion of like what am I shooting where and again I felt this when I was

[19:46] playing the game because now that I'm trying to hit shots and I understand that the little screen

[19:50] in the back is telling me what my shots are I did walk away a little bit again it was a day in

[19:55] which I was a little bit bummed out but I did walk away feeling a little bit like there's just

[20:00] so much to shoot I'm not really sure what I'm shooting now there's like four or five balls going

[20:04] and you're just sort of like flailing away a little bit you know I didn't mind the multi-ball at all

[20:09] like I know that you need the multi-ball as I know why they're there I did feel like I experienced

[20:14] some of that like chaos that some of you out there just don't like like you like a game with more

[20:19] control you like a game with more feel and that's the big thing I mean that's the big thing in

[20:24] this industry I think if you look at a game like Guns and Roses and then you look at Stern's

[20:29] good games I think it boils down to one thing for me one thing for me I mean other than like

[20:34] the presentation and the quality but the most important reason why I think people would just

[20:39] skip over Jersey Jack games for a Stern game is just feel I think the feel of a Jersey Jack game

[20:47] to me is almost like a luxury car like it's very smooth it's very polished it feels very solid all

[20:55] these things are happening it feels very premium but it's lacking some of that feel and that feel

[21:01] for some of you out there is everything you know when you drive in a car and it's a luxury car and

[21:05] it could be fast it could be a beautiful engineered machine which is what a Jersey Jack machine is

[21:11] but there's something missing a little bit in the feel of the steering wheel and that's what I feel

[21:17] a little bit like with Jersey Jack games is like it's a little numb it's a little numb to the touch

[21:23] and I don't know how you improve that isn't it weird to say that too because you're actually not

[21:28] feeling anything in a pinball machine you're really not you are your hands are on a button

[21:32] and you're on wood and you're on the the the armor but your your hands not touching the ball you're

[21:37] not throwing the ball up the playfield but there's you know what I'm saying there's just a little

[21:40] bit of a disconnect where I think Stern machines and the way Stern flippers work and the way

[21:46] Stern games shoot is much more sort of snappy you have more feel more control you must feel more like

[21:55] you're inside that ball and you can control where it's going more than when you play a Jersey Jack

[22:00] machine I know this sounds really weird and maybe I'm describing it weird but when I shoot like

[22:05] an Avengers or a Jurassic Park and then I shoot guns and roses you know one feels like it's

[22:11] tighter it's got a little bit more control it's got a little bit more snappiness and I can

[22:16] anticipate more what's going on in the game in Jersey Jack games I mean I love guns and roses don't

[22:22] get me wrong I love it I'm still going to get it I'm never going to sell it but there is a little

[22:27] bit of that disconnect that the balls are floating around and I don't feel as much control I don't

[22:32] feel like the kinetic energy between the ball the playfield and the flippers as I do in a Stern

[22:39] and that's not to say like the games are bad it's just different feel CGC has a different feel to

[22:44] its game then then Stern and JJP so it is like American pinball so all these companies it's a unique

[22:50] thing about a pinball company is they each have a different feel and I think that is the number one

[22:55] reason why Stern has such a big fan base you know I think that's the number one divider is like

[23:01] some people just can't get over the way a Jersey Jack game feels and then I would say the second

[23:05] big thing that keeps people away from Jersey Jack machines other than theme is just they're

[23:10] two complex they're too deep like it's just too much going on and you just walk away feeling

[23:17] overwhelmed and that's a big issue and I think guns and roses solve some of it but man go stand

[23:23] over guns and roses and look at the amount of inserts look at the amount of stuff there is to

[23:29] shoot and do some people get excited by that but some people get extremely overwhelmed by that

[23:37] and I mean it's coming from Batman 66 I do miss the simplicity of knowing that these two shots

[23:44] are the cat woman shots these two shots are the ridler shots this is the penguin shot and there's

[23:51] inserts and lights that show me and indicate to me what I'm doing and it's easy to understand

[23:57] it's easy to tell other people who play the game this is what you do and then I stand over guns

[24:03] and roses and you kind of just like shoulder shrug throw your hands up in the air and are like well

[24:08] it's just a lot of stuff it's beautiful there's a lot going on but I've absolutely no idea what the hell

[24:14] is where and why and and again it's because I'm a newbie but it begs the question should a newbie be

[24:20] able to stand over a pinball machine and be utterly confused and I think that learning curve is

[24:26] still a main reason why you know people look at Jersey Jack games and they shoulder shrug a little

[24:32] bit they're like this isn't this isn't the best way to deliver pinball because it's overly complex

[24:38] and there's too much on the screen and there's too much do we need all this do we need patches do we

[24:43] need that do we need this mode do we need the real trick is how do you have a lot in a game and make

[24:48] each thing feel meaningful and I can't wait to explore more of guns and roses to see if I feel

[24:53] that meaningfulness with all the different stuff in the game I mean I felt it with Batman 66

[24:58] code it's why Lyman is a genius I actually prefer Lyman over Keith when it comes to coding just

[25:03] because I think he knows how to give you a lot but not make it utterly confusing on how to get

[25:10] to most of it now this might get simpler as I learn it so keep in mind I've only played about

[25:15] maybe 50 games of guns and roses but I now need to learn it I need to learn what to do and where

[25:20] everything is and I'm sure the game will become more enjoyable for all of us as we learn this game

[25:26] but it's a stellar game it's a beautiful game I don't expect guns and roses CE's to leave

[25:32] people's collections just because of how mesmerizing it is it's just one of these special games

[25:38] that really is once in a lifetime it is raised the bar on the pinball experience it hasn't raised

[25:44] the bar on like shot geometry or flow or toys or any of that stuff but in terms of experience what

[25:51] this game does is truly magical and I can't wait for all you guys to play it all right so let's

[25:57] end this show with what's next from Stern and spooky pinball and as I said Stern is gonna do it

[26:02] again they're about to clobber everybody with a juggernaut it's common it's a juggernaut it's

[26:08] gonna be big it's gonna be bigger than big your money will be going to Stern pinball come this

[26:14] may okay do you hear me right now your money will be headed to Stern pinball come this may

[26:21] unless Brian Eddie messes it up I mean that's that's really the caveat you are all gonna want this theme

[26:27] unless Brian Eddie and Stern messes it up unless they go cheap on it I haven't seen the game

[26:33] but I know that you're gonna want this theme okay that's just the first thing I'm gonna say it's not

[26:39] based on a movie so I'm gonna give you that hint it's not based on a movie and it's not a music

[26:45] pin so let's start there it's not a movie and it's not a music pin so it is not back to the future

[26:51] for all of you out there hoping for back to the future it is not back to the future it is a contemporary

[26:57] theme which means it is something that has come out recently over the last few years it is something

[27:04] you all know it is something you all love it is something that you are going to want if I were a

[27:12] betting man I think Stern's gonna sell every Ellie out in day one and if I were a betting man I

[27:18] think Stern is probably gonna offer more than 500 L.E.s of this game because of how big the

[27:23] property is we've seen them do that before a few times so I think that is also gonna happen there's

[27:29] no way they're only gonna make 500 I mean I would doubt it but I think Stern knows they have a

[27:34] property that is huge okay it is huge and here's the good news about this title here's the good

[27:40] news about this title you're not gonna have to wait very long so if you're thinking about buying a

[27:45] pinball machine this week don't if you're thinking about ordering an Avengers this week don't if

[27:50] you're thinking about ordering a guns and roses this week don't you are going to see this game are

[27:55] you ready can it is pinball podcasts please source me all to you other pinball podcasts that you know

[28:00] but this is about like the you know you get another hour to go if it's another pinball podcast no

[28:05] you don't need an hour to talk about what people want to hear in pinball so so I'm hearing this

[28:09] game will be shown to the world the first week in May so if you are waiting to see what Stern's

[28:16] new game is it is going to be revealed to the world the first week in May now I don't want to say

[28:21] anything more than that and I think for those of you out there you can make your guesses you could

[28:25] try to figure out what it is but I also don't want to spoil what the theme is I don't want to tell

[28:30] you exactly it's going to be this because if I do that I do think that undermines all the hard

[28:35] work of the people who have been working on these things I know they're excited for you to see

[28:39] this stuff they're not excited for canate to have this information and this is my sort of

[28:45] olive branch if you will now I could just come out and say what it is I think you guys will be

[28:49] smart enough and be able to figure this out contemporary theme not a movie not a music pin

[28:57] huge juggernaut theme get ready to give Stern your money this is music to the ears of coin taker

[29:04] to Zach many to all the distributors out there I'm telling you right now go call your distributor

[29:10] and get on the list for an le you're going to want this theme now just get on the list because if

[29:17] the games a dog if we get another stranger things if the game is not what you think it should be

[29:22] that's fine you can always get your money back but don't get locked out of this one this is going

[29:27] to be a big one this is going to be a big one okay so spooky pinball so what is next at spooky

[29:32] pinball so again same thing here I am not going to run spooky pinball is next theme but I will give

[29:38] you some details the game is coming out in June now I don't know if the game is going to be on the

[29:42] line in June but spooky is going to reveal this game in June so that's great so we have a new

[29:47] Stern in May and a new spooky in June what a great time to be in the pinball right awesome awesome

[29:53] now I heard that spooky pinball game was a mainstream movie property now I'm here to tell you

[30:01] that was a little misleading spooky's next game is a mainstream property it's a property you all

[30:07] know you grew up with this property it's spooky themed if you will it's not horror based so if

[30:15] you think it's like a horror like Friday the 13th or something like that you're wrong it's not

[30:20] night of the living dead it is spooky themed it's fun it's campy it's it's like a joyous theme it's

[30:26] not going to be like some dark horror kind of thing is it contemporary is it you know it's always

[30:32] been around like this this property has always been around and again it's something that makes a lot

[30:38] of people smile it's something that makes a lot of people laugh I think you're really going to enjoy

[30:42] it I think it makes perfect sense for spooky to make this game I think it's going to have nostalgic

[30:48] appeal but I also think it's going to be like a really colorful fun vibrant game from spooky pinball

[30:55] and that's all I'm going to say on it and I think this game also when they reveal it in June is

[31:01] probably going to sell out immediately it's not as hot as Rick and Morty but it's a property

[31:07] that's been around for longer that has fan bases that span generations and again I just think

[31:13] it's going to be fun and campy and I think spooky has realized that if you want to sell games and

[31:19] you want to get people excited this is what you do you give people stuff that makes them feel good

[31:24] like Rick and Morty you know Alice Cooper Rob Zombie like that stuff is too niche it's too like

[31:30] oh it's music but it just makes you angry on some level like nightmare castles fun it was a fun

[31:35] game but I think this is going to be another game where spooky learns and improves I expect this

[31:41] game to have way more in it mechanically than Rick and Morty did this is going to be a game that has

[31:46] more toys in it it's going to be a game that flows better it's going to be a game that finally I think

[31:52] spooky has heard the feedback that stop making these games so damn brutal like that's not fun like

[31:58] in this property is something you grew up with it's not something you want to jump on and struggle

[32:03] just to have like a two minute ball time like you want to be in this game and in this world and I

[32:10] can already see like what the toys could be it's going to be fun I really do I think this one is

[32:15] also going to be the perfect theme for spooky pinball Godzilla is not next from Stern I didn't say

[32:20] that but it's also not Godzilla so take that off the table so look here's my point is this summer

[32:28] you're going to see I think two great games from Stern and from spooky pinball and I think this is

[32:34] why we love pinball because we love the options that these companies are going to give us see this is

[32:39] why I've been saying to people stop looking at the past stop looking at what's come out over the last

[32:45] couple years and chasing after things and spending two three thousand dollars over on Jurassic Park

[32:51] or thirty thousand dollars over on a pirate to the Caribbean there's no point there's no point

[32:56] the best way to enjoy this hobby is to look at what comes out play what you love try to jump on

[33:02] everything but by themes that you love and here's what excites me about what's coming from Stern

[33:07] and spooky is these are themes people really love like a lot of people really love this isn't stuff

[33:12] that like just a few people like this isn't like the comic book version of something that you love

[33:18] this isn't like the movie that you love without the assets like this is stuff that you love now the

[33:23] big question will be what kind of assets will Stern get in this juggernaut theme you're going to need

[33:29] to have stuff from the property like you're going to have to see it it's not going to work without it

[33:34] so I'm curious to see how much they get now history tells us something I think they're going to get

[33:40] all the assets they need for this one this isn't going to be like a Jurassic Park without the clip

[33:45] so that's that's a good thing same with spooky I think they're going to have everything in it that

[33:49] you're going to want I don't think it's going to be without anything so that horse race I was talking

[33:54] about Stern spooky and JJP they are firing on all cylinders where is everybody else right

[34:02] three horse race people look at everybody else like look at deep route like it's over it's over

[34:07] deep roots going to see this title by Stern and May and it's just over like you can't compete with

[34:12] 130 raza orders you can spend millions of dollars on animation studios in Utah and all this money

[34:19] down in Texas and no one knows what's going on they can't even get deep route pinball can't even

[34:23] get six games lined up that are made the way the pinball brothers could like the pinball brothers

[34:27] just two dudes who were like embarrassed by Andrew highway they're more effective and efficient

[34:33] than all of deep route that that's pathetic like it's not even worth talking about where's Chicago

[34:38] gaming company we know it's cactus canyon Ryan we know it's cactus canyon remake it's going to be

[34:43] the most underwhelming reveal because we know what it is great it's cactus canyon great it's got

[34:48] a wide screen great you add it more code so what Stern's about the clobber that theme was something

[34:54] that millions and millions probably billions of people love right now and you're going to come out

[34:59] with an old game that we've waited for two years now and it's like the cat's been out of the bag

[35:03] for so long why don't you show us what mark richi's been working on all these years that's sci-fi

[35:08] thing you're working on is a gremlins is probably gremlins is the cat out of the bag American pinball

[35:13] like this is it man this is it David fix this is it this is it this is how you flex David fix

[35:18] this is how you flex the first week in March David fix like I want to just have a camera on David

[35:24] fix his face when stern reveals this game and and then David fix can tell us all about how he's

[35:29] got Dennis Norman and Zofia and all this stuff happening but where is it bro where is it bro you

[35:34] can flex like this you got to come out when you have something you got to drop a game out in the

[35:40] world that's when you flex and stern's not just gonna flex they're gonna do what they do they

[35:46] stern and burn everybody else they're just gonna clobber everybody else with this stuff and it's

[35:52] gonna keep coming because here's just crazy you weren't even expecting to buy the next stern you

[35:58] all were expecting to buy Keith Owens Godzilla now they are gonna get your money and then you're

[36:02] gonna want to buy Owens Godzilla and then you're gonna want to buy back to the future when they

[36:06] make it because they are making back to the future and then you're gonna want to buy Lord the Rings

[36:10] remake because they are going to remake Lord the Rings this is just not gonna stop it's not gonna

[36:15] stop so don't be stupid and spend three four thousand dollars on topers because stern pinball is

[36:21] gonna keep serving you up what they know you want Jersey Jack pinball yes but they can't serve it

[36:26] up fast enough I mean we're not gonna get toy story to next year they can't even get guns and

[36:31] roses made in time so like stern is just gonna keep clobbering everybody they don't have 90%

[36:37] of the market people they have 95% of the market there is no market other than stern it's a monopoly

[36:43] they really have it all now it's not a monopoly I mean I'm getting a little dramatic here if I had

[36:47] a cup of coffee but but you know what I mean but I'm happy to see these three companies dominate

[36:51] they really are there is something for everybody in just these three companies there's something from

[36:58] stern and Jersey Jack and spooky if you can't find pinball enjoyment from those three companies

[37:03] then what are you even doing here and the other thing is this we don't need other companies we don't

[37:09] need all these other companies and these other companies need to look at what these three companies

[37:14] are doing and say how can we do as good if not better they need to and if they can't figure it out

[37:21] then get out of pinball we don't need more than four or five games a year and these guys will

[37:25] deliver seriously four to five new games a year will come out from these three people probably more

[37:30] like six or seven and is that not good enough we need we need 10 games we need 15 games we don't

[37:37] we don't so this is good I can't wait first week in May you heard it here first can it

[37:41] just pinball podcast later
