[00:00] I feel like I need to start training my body as if I was preparing for a marathon to

[00:24] get ready for Texas Pimball Festival next year because there is just a level of physical

[00:29] abuse your body takes when you are at a pinball show. I'm at the airport right now so you're

[00:35] going to hear like airport BS over the loudspeaker there's nothing I can do I am probably just sitting

[00:41] in the wrong place but there is like hardly anywhere to find some quiet little corner in an

[00:47] airport to record a podcast but I wanted to get you guys my feedback from day two of the Texas

[00:52] Pimball Festival so don't ever say I'm not dedicated to getting you guys a show even though I'm in

[00:58] the middle of traveling I have to head to Atlanta for work but here's what happened at day two the two

[01:02] big things I'm where highlights of the day one is spooky pinball showing us Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[01:09] two stern pinball having their seminar in which this podcast was actually called out specifically

[01:17] by George Gomez and I want to tell you what he said and also a subsequent conversation I had with

[01:22] him following that that no one was privy to but but him and I but it's all good stuff I think there's

[01:27] a level of respect and camaraderie that everyone who's in this hobby experiences and that is what

[01:34] makes these shows so special because you know here I am I feel like it's been one long day I flew

[01:40] in on Friday and it's Sunday morning and it really just feels like one long consecutive day of

[01:47] drinking a ton of booze eating a ton of food and seeing a ton a ton of pinball and and when it's

[01:54] over you kind of sit back and you're like you know what I didn't even actually play much pinball

[01:59] I spent majority of my time catching up with friends and hanging out but I say this my body is

[02:07] on like a biological clock and I'm normally used to waking up every morning around seven o'clock

[02:11] because this one Bubba has to go out and at tpf I'm like in bed at like two or three in the morning

[02:16] which is another hour later in New York I'm just dead tired but let's get right to the stuff you

[02:21] want to hear about so what were my thoughts on Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle so when Charlie

[02:26] unveiled the game at four o'clock he had the seminar unpacked I mean it was standing room only as I

[02:32] was walking up to the room it was like 359 and there was like people outside just trying to even

[02:37] get into the room and when I got in there there was still some some TNA being played by Bohn Karen's

[02:45] guys amazing I mean I got there like at the end apparently he spent the hour

[02:49] going through all nine reactors and showing people how to beat the game and and strategies on total

[02:54] nuclear annihilation I always say like I probably wouldn't want to ever be that good at pinball because

[02:59] I feel like that guy can just beat any game anytime he wants to and then it's just like on to the

[03:04] next I mean he literally is that good but he got a standing ovation and it was really cool to see

[03:08] people celebrating the best of the best when it comes to pinball skills but finally he was done

[03:15] they wrapped it up Charlie was in the back wearing like a cape and a top hat and then his eyes

[03:20] pain it like Alice Cooper and they marched down to the front of the room and they brought with them

[03:27] a pinball machine that was covered up clearly they hadn't removed the paper and plastic that was

[03:33] covering the play field from previous few days and they had their moment to reveal a TPM now what

[03:38] I want to do is I want to talk about how they revealed and then what they revealed because I think

[03:43] those are two separate things and you know man I'm always going to look at how pinball companies

[03:48] decide to reveal their products to the world through the lens of a little bit of a marketer right I

[03:53] think you get one opportunity to build as much excitement and enthusiasm for your product as

[03:59] possible and that's just the first impression of course of course it's not you know nothing's

[04:05] really going to go horribly wrong during a pinball reveal at the end of the day pinball people will

[04:10] find the pictures they need they will find time to get on a game and they will have a plethora

[04:17] of content to look at whenever a new game is revealed because you know what happens

[04:22] hundreds of people with cell phones will bombard the machine and start taking pictures and videos

[04:26] once a game is revealed but here's what they did they got up there and they showed a great video

[04:32] of Alice Cooper talking about how much excitement he has for being immortalized in a pinball machine

[04:40] and it was a really good video it was a really great video I think Spooky and Company did a great job

[04:45] showing the backstage footage they had when they brought bug and to see Alice Cooper and

[04:50] and and veiled the game to him and I can say that Alice Cooper is in fact getting game number one

[04:57] which is super awesome it's a dream come true for these guys I mean I think the other part is

[05:01] you know when Charlie first got up there he said you know we're not trying to be stern we're not

[05:04] trying to be these big manufacturers and this is sort of like this family is living their dream

[05:11] and I think if you sort of step away from you know just critiquing the products they make

[05:17] I'm in awe of anyone who follows their life's passion and their life's dreams and they're family

[05:23] their whole family is lifted up by pinball and by making pinball machines and you know if their

[05:30] son's favorite act is Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle and and through making pinball machines

[05:36] he's able to meet Alice Cooper me you know me his favorite drummer hang out with the band

[05:41] and and and also make a pinball machine that captures his favorite artist I think that's absolutely

[05:46] incredible I mean I can't even tell you the excitement I had when I got somewhat close to the world

[05:50] of Guns and Roses but not nearly this close and I think these guys are living the dream and I think

[05:56] that rubs off on people I think what we've always asked of spooky pinball is that the passion they

[06:02] have for the industry makes its way into a product that is also a stellar pinball product and we'll

[06:07] get to that in a minute but I'm still talking about the reveal so they're up there they show this

[06:11] video and they have an hour they have an hour scheduled to reveal Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[06:18] and then they sort of put up a PowerPoint slide that said the reveal and they pulled the curtain

[06:23] off the game you know that moment right that moment where you lift the curtain off and we're

[06:28] going to see for the first time the populated playfield of Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle and

[06:35] you know that was it we had this video image of the top down of the game and it was colorful it

[06:42] was bright but it was like so hard to see I think everyone in attendance just couldn't get a sense

[06:48] of what they were looking at because it's almost impossible when you're shooting in a bright room

[06:53] like those seminar rooms and you're just looking top down on a game it sort of it sort of flattens

[06:58] everything and if there's anything this game is not it's flat it has a lot of depth it has a lot

[07:03] of detail and we just couldn't see any of it and sort of you know Charlie went over and was talking

[07:08] about certain things the game would be doing but I think everyone in the room just couldn't really

[07:14] figure it out because of what we were looking at just did not connect we couldn't even you know

[07:21] we couldn't really comprehend it so that was like my only like oh man if I could just give one

[07:25] advice next time they do do a reveal is to just have a high res images ready of the game and walk

[07:32] us through it I mean there I feel like Charlie was nervous and even said he was nervous but they

[07:36] put so much effort into this game there's no need to rush I mean you've got the whole hour at

[07:41] the show you know I think you can take your time and explain to people you know the game walk us

[07:47] through the storyline walk us through like what the objective is that you're you know you're trying

[07:52] to escape from this castle and there's these monsters and we work with back alley creations to

[07:57] sculpt a world under glass that is unlike anything we ever thought we could do before you know there's

[08:02] a story there there's a narrative and I think the art of public speaking and and really getting

[08:08] your story down it takes practice it takes rehearsal and we all know that pinball people are not

[08:14] the best at this I mean it's not just Charlie I was in some other seminars where I'm just like oh

[08:18] man like do people even like do they even like run through this before coming to a show where people

[08:24] are going to be expecting to hear something so I'll say this though that it didn't last very long

[08:30] I eventually Charlie was just like you know what I'm just going to put the game out there in the floor

[08:34] and let you play it and let you have added and that's what they did it only we were only in the room

[08:39] for like 10 minutes and then everyone just like bum rush the game and that's when we really got

[08:45] to see Alice Cooper's nightmare castle for the first time I walked up to it kind of ran up to it

[08:51] there was a lot of people looking at it and I have to say I have to say the game looks great I mean

[08:57] there is there I have nothing bad to say about the appearance of this game I think the cabinet

[09:01] I'm gonna talk a little bit more about that in a second the cabinet artwork the printing to the

[09:06] cabinet is incredible the detail in the game looks phenomenal it you know I look I I I know people

[09:13] make fun of me for saying world in their glass world under glass but this is a world in their glass

[09:18] and it doesn't feel just like a traditional music pin it really feels like you're in this horror

[09:24] castle and there's so much going on there's a guillotine there's a Frankenstein there's there's

[09:29] you know there's multiple layers upper playfield so I think everything there um that we wanted in terms

[09:36] of spooky taking their games to the next level was there and I think everyone agrees I think everyone

[09:40] who saw it was was completely blown away by um this being there this is the game I mean we've said

[09:47] it this had to be a game that really they put a lot into if they were going to sell 500 of and I

[09:53] and I think they're gonna do it you know I think they're gonna do it and so also another good

[09:57] decision was to put the game on one ball so that people could come up and play one ball the game

[10:03] and Charlie explained like the code is not there the code is not there um the code will get there

[10:07] but right now he just wanted people to get a sense of this is what the game is gonna look like

[10:11] and this is what the game is going to shoot like now it's funny because if Stern showed up

[10:17] with a game with so little code people would have like chastised them and screamed how terrible

[10:23] how could you arrive without you know much in the game um but there's hardly anything in this game

[10:29] and it was fine though you know I think we give spooky much more of a break than we give Stern

[10:34] probably because there's not 400 people working at spooky pinball who who who get these games ready

[10:39] for market um the other big news though was right before the game was revealed is Charlie

[10:46] revealed that bone carons is now an employee are working for uh spooky pinball to help them with

[10:53] with game rules and game design um and code after it could it'll be like a consultant for the code

[10:59] I mean I think it's a great move I mean who better to help consult on a game than a guy who knows

[11:06] everything about so many games and knows knows how to like beat everything and knows what makes a game

[11:13] good um so that's really really exciting news that spooky has bone carons now on board helping them

[11:19] with with um with code development so a lot a lot a lot of good stuff coming out of the show for

[11:26] for spooky and I I said it from the very beginning you know this was going to be their show to lose

[11:30] because there really wasn't anything else new that was going to be shown at this show monster bash

[11:36] wasn't there iron maiden wasn't there we had Jersey Jack pinball there you know and we saw

[11:41] pirates of the Caribbean before so pirates was not going to have this like wow like you know reveal

[11:46] moment but for a lot of people this was the first time they were seeing pirates the Caribbean and

[11:51] jumping on it um same with Houdini you know those were the games I mean at the end of the day the new

[11:56] games that people are looking at are Houdini are Jersey Jack uh pirates the Caribbean

[12:04] uh house coopers nightmare castle total nuclear annihilation and from Stern you know I mean I think

[12:09] people are relooking at Batman but I think for the most part iron maiden is the game that people

[12:12] are waiting for so to wrap this up to wrap this up I think it was a little bit of a fumbled reveal

[12:20] in the seminar room for charlotte and company I think if I could give them some advice I would work on

[12:24] that part of of their presentation um when you spend so much time on something you take it slow

[12:32] savor that moment really walk through um all the hurdles and things you did to make this game happen

[12:39] I think there's a story there that we just quite don't know yet um and I was hoping he would have

[12:43] gone a little bit deeper into making this game um but does it really matter absolutely not I think

[12:49] the response that I'm seeing on pin-side and the response from people in the room is that this is

[12:53] a great game and we haven't talked about the greatest part about this game it's only $6500 and I

[12:59] know they raised the price a couple hundred bucks because they're using p-rock and full RGB LEDs um but

[13:05] I think you're gonna get your money's worth there now the other thing is this he had a standard

[13:09] cabinet and then he had the butter cabinet and the butter cabinet is a thousand dollar uh upgrade

[13:14] but I'll say this you want that butter cabinet and charlie was telling me it's the difference between

[13:20] artwork printed on like a fifteen thousand dollar machine and artwork printed on a quarter million

[13:26] dollar machine and so if you are going to get an Alice Cooper's nightmare castle just take my word

[13:32] for it you want the butter cabinet it the colors pop like I've never seen colors pop on a game it

[13:38] is gorgeous and it's directly printed to the wood this isn't some cheap decals slapped on all right

[13:45] as far as I mean I can't go too much into the gameplay of Alice Cooper's nightmare castle because I

[13:49] played a few games on it um I definitely think it's a fun layout uh I you know there's not much going

[13:55] on in the game right now so I think there's there's like I want to hold my reservations but I think

[14:00] from what we see in the game from from a layout from a mechanisms um there's a really cool like

[14:07] magnet save in in between the flippers I know golden eye has this where the if the ball will go

[14:13] beneath the center of between down the middle of the flippers and the magnet will grab it and throw

[14:18] the ball back up into play which is super freaking cool um so I think there's a lot of the game to be

[14:22] excited about there's a guillotine that acts as a ball lock in the upper play field area um lots

[14:27] and lots and lots of detail in the artwork so I think look I think people are going to be happy

[14:31] I don't have anything else other to say then I think spooky and company did a great job

[14:36] and I think we're seeing the fruit of the relay when I think people are going to love it I really do

[14:40] I you know now you have to make sure you want it because if you go in on one the refunds are non

[14:45] refundable and I think the order books open up in about a week or so so make sure you know you want

[14:51] it um you know I know it's hard that's hard right it's hard to get in on a game that you're

[14:57] gonna have to lay money down on before ever playing it um but maybe that's you know that's fine

[15:03] maybe that's fine um I think you guys uh you know I would just recommend playing it it's it's

[15:10] it's a little bit of a quagmire I get it I get it but I do think they're going to sell all 500 I

[15:14] was skeptical at first whether they would do it but um I do think people want new stuff as much

[15:19] as monster bash is a great old game it's an old game and I told Charlie people want new stuff new

[15:23] experiences so um it's it's your market it's your market because you have something new in it

[15:29] versus just looking back with these remakes uh keep getting interrupted with this inner

[15:33] commonest airport but I'm doing my best I'm doing my best all right let me get to the other part

[15:36] of yesterday that that really stood out for me so um George Gomez was up there and he was talking

[15:43] about Stern Pimball and he walked us through sort of a little bit of a behind the scenes journey

[15:49] at Stern Pimball he walked us through like the private design area of Stern Pimball where

[15:54] he began to tease their next title they called it um titanium man right which is obviously referring

[16:01] to iron maiden um and he gave us a nice sort of like behind the scenes look something that I really

[16:07] liked what they did was they played a video of the making of guardians of the galaxy and they had

[16:13] the coder they had John Bore they had people who are working on the game and it was a nice sort of

[16:19] sort of like two-minute journey into like how they developed guardians of the galaxy I'm you know

[16:24] and I think that video is great I'm part of me is just like well I just wish they would launch this

[16:28] stuff when the games are launched and I explain why in a minute because this is what happened this

[16:34] is what happened I wasn't expecting this and I saw George when I first got there at wild

[16:39] pitch and I said hi to him and I could tell like you know he wasn't that excited to see me I get

[16:44] that a lot in this industry and someone asked a question about what what do you say to the rumors

[16:51] about lineman sheets retiring which I kind of find that kind of funny because I was having dinner

[16:56] with lineman sheets the night before and hanging out with him a little bit that day what do you

[17:00] think about those rumors and I and basically George was like you know these rumors you know they

[17:06] who knows where they come from but you know there's a pinball podcast or in New York who aims to be

[17:12] provocative and sometimes you know says stuff that's just bullshit I mean I'm just paraphrasing

[17:17] that's not exactly what he said I'm sure there's a video somewhere and that I'm really good at

[17:21] being provocative and that's what I aim for and I want to sort of just talk about sort of how

[17:27] he felt in that moment where like George Gomez the guy who like runs the biggest pinball company in

[17:31] the world is saying those things about my podcast I want to I want to break it down and sort of how

[17:36] it made me feel and just thinking about it because I also ended up talking to George later that night

[17:41] at Perry's stake house I saw him at the bar by himself and I wanted to just like you know just

[17:46] clear the air a little bit and and and tell where I'm coming from and and what not so look he said

[17:52] that you know they always aim for for speaking the truth and if they given the opportunity they're

[17:56] going to speak their minds and I want to just say this first and foremost I have the utmost

[18:01] respect for George Gomez I have the utmost respect for Stern pinball I think I've said it on this

[18:06] podcast many many times if it weren't for Stern pinball there would be no Texas pinball festival

[18:11] there would be no Canadian pinball podcast there would be no pinball there would be no modern

[18:14] pinball that we're all playing and enjoying it that's just the reality of of what they've done

[18:19] and all the hard work they do and I think Stern is a company that because they are so big it is

[18:25] easy for them to get the you know the the majority of complaints and the majority of frustration

[18:33] and the majority of the arrows head in their direction because they're the ones are actually

[18:37] putting pinball in people's homes where so many other companies out there have failed to do what

[18:42] Stern does on a daily basis you know you got to remember when companies come out and say oh we're

[18:46] going to ship 50 we're going to ship 200 we're going to ship you know Stern is making that in a

[18:50] week and they're on to the next you know they're shipping thousands of games a year this isn't a

[18:56] company that ever has a pause you know and George Gomez is responsible for putting food on the

[19:02] table for hundreds of employees not not just a few people here and there this is not just a family

[19:07] run operation I mean he's got a lot on his mind and he's got a lot he's got to deal with and

[19:14] I'm sure dealing with someone like me or hearing the things I say at times has to be frustrating as hell

[19:21] especially when you know more than I do and I'm always going to be at a disadvantage on this podcast

[19:25] I'm always going to you know have to speculate on things that I don't you know know 100% and I'll

[19:32] say this the Lyman Sheets retiring comment came from someone who hit me up and said hey I like I

[19:38] know for a fact that Lyman is leaving Stern and this is happening and this is happening and you

[19:42] know it's it's always hard for me because what do I then go do do I then go ask Lyman Sheets and

[19:48] Stern I know they won't comment is this guy telling the truth and then I'll solve aired as a rumor

[19:54] now what I need to do a better job of and this is just this is me learning as a podcaster and I

[19:59] told this to George like I want to get better I want you to tell me like what exactly goes you

[20:03] know what what goes on in Stern when if I say something like this what are the repercussions I

[20:08] need to do a better job of not just flippantly saying stuff that does have a damaging impact on on

[20:15] a company and a company's business and a company's ability to be you know successful because rumors

[20:23] can be damaging now look when I when I had all the information I had about highway pinball I knew

[20:27] that was real I knew I verified it I fact checked it I fact checked all of it I knew it was accurate

[20:34] I knew Andrew highway was lying and you all some of you didn't believe me but in the end everything

[20:40] I said was true but recently I've said some things that I think I need to do a better job of

[20:45] fact checking and like the like the Jersey Jaxiost stepping down and then like Lyman Sheets retiring

[20:50] and you know are these things going to happen I don't know and if I do talk about this stuff I will

[20:55] do a better job of of indicating how close to the truth I think this information is so there's

[21:02] that now in terms of this podcast being provocative there's a lot that goes on in this hobby and I will

[21:09] always be a provocative voice within the pinball world I think you listen to me because of that I am

[21:13] not here to be a cheerleader for anyone company and if some company does something wrong I do want

[21:20] to call them out on it you know because because as much as I do respect everyone over at Stern for

[21:26] what they do they also do make mistakes at times and they don't always handle it the way that I think

[21:34] is the best way to handle it but they always do handle it and that's the thing you know as much

[21:41] I've had Stern machines I've had other manufacturers machines for the most part I think like 99%

[21:47] of the time Stern takes care of its customers Stern 100% of the times gets people a game when they

[21:52] pay for it and Stern has so many games that they're working on and they're going to continue to be

[21:59] the biggest player in town you know look Alice Cooper's nightmare castle is awesome Charlie's

[22:03] going to be making that and total nuclear annihilation probably for the next couple years and the next

[22:08] couple years Stern is going to get 10 probably like eight to ten new titles out the door for us

[22:14] and that's incredible I mean that is absolutely incredible and when you I was at the Marco booth

[22:20] at Texas Pimball Festival the variety of titles that Stern has you know everything from Batman

[22:26] to Ghostbusters to Arosmith the Star Wars to you know ACDC and they're all great games I mean

[22:34] sometimes we really really really are too hard on Stern and I'll be the first to admit it and

[22:40] again because it's easy to criticize the company that has the majority of the share of Pimball

[22:47] because we all feel we all kind of also want option you know it's just part of being human like

[22:53] we want to have as many options as possible like I don't want to live in a world where there's only

[22:57] one performance sports car manufacturer right if if Porsche was the only company making sports cars

[23:03] and they dominated the market I would still long for some variety and I think that's what

[23:09] drives people in the enthusiast sort of collectible part of this hobby is we just want options right

[23:16] and sometimes we we we're overly critical of Stern because we think they could do better for

[23:21] what they're charging for their games but I'll say this this is what I told George and I think

[23:26] if I could ask them to do more of this I think they'd be better off as I think Stern should let us

[23:31] in a little bit more on the process and the stories behind their games I'll tell you why for two

[23:37] reasons I think reason number one is when you let people know what goes into a game and the story

[23:44] behind it and all the hard work and you show the people I'll tell you what it does it makes idiots

[23:50] like me sort of be less critical because you know what now I know now I know why that is the way it

[23:58] is now I know why it star wars ended up the way it did you know I think I think I've been overly

[24:05] critical on Steve Richie being like he needs to retire this and that you know Steve Richie

[24:08] tells people flat out like working on that game was a nightmare because of Disney and the approval

[24:13] process and everything they made him do you know he was so compromised in making star wars I think when

[24:19] you let people know the stories behind the games I think it eliminates a lot of the criticism

[24:25] because people feel like now they know all right I think that's that's a good reason why they should

[24:29] do that I also think it gives people more excitement for the product itself because there's a story

[24:35] behind it when you walk up to a machine like you walk up to guardians like so many times people

[24:39] are just focused on like what's not in the game and they don't even know like the story that went

[24:44] into building the game and that just makes people have an increased desire to own something when

[24:49] they know the story behind it so look I fully fully respect George and I think George

[24:56] was totally warranted in jabbing at me and saying some stuff about me that wasn't so nice because

[25:02] I've said stuff about them that is not so nice but we shook hands and I told them you know what I'm

[25:08] going to do more in the future to be more fair and to not sort of say things without thinking

[25:14] them through folly all right I'm still going to get my opinions about the games because that's what I do

[25:19] but I definitely I definitely want to say that you know that defines some of my trip you know

[25:26] being called out by the world's biggest bimbal manufacturer for doing what I do but I'm going to

[25:31] keep doing it and I hope you enjoy it now I got to go run and catch my flight I'll say this

[25:36] bimbal is back in a big way there are so many options though it is competitive though I would

[25:43] hate I would hate to try and have to sell like a thousand or two thousand titles to stay in business

[25:48] because the money is going to go all over the place and I would never want to compete with the

[25:54] manufacturing ability of like stern and all the titles coming out I just wouldn't I think the

[25:58] white space in this hobby even as I walked around the show nobody is making a high-end collectible

[26:06] limited run game that is the only white space I can see in the hobby I think Charlie's doing it right

[26:11] I think Stern is doing it right I think Jersey Jack will get there they're just not quite there yet

[26:18] in terms of like the theme that's going to sell thousands and thousands of units pirates looked great

[26:23] I'll go into more detail about that on a recap show that I'll do probably with Blake or some other people

[26:28] but the super high-end collector is still left without any options and I think that is the white

[26:35] space that if you're listening and you want to bring bimbal to market that's that's the itch you

[26:40] need to scratch or else good luck trying to break through with all these games have a good day

[26:45] guys I got to catch a flight I'll talk to you real soon

[26:58] thank you Birmingham
