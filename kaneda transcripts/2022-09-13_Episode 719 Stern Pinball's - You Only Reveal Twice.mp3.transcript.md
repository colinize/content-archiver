[00:00] With so much drama in the LBC, it's kinda hard being a Snoopy O Double G.

[00:04] CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA

[00:09] What a dramatic week for pinball launches.

[00:12] We're gonna talk about it on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:15] But first, we are at 544 club members.

[00:19] Welcome to the club, Leon, Josh, Adam, Vader, Miles, Glenn, Shanti, Ryan, Paul, David.

[00:26] This is so awesome.

[00:28] You know what's not awesome?

[00:30] Stern flying all the way to the UK to reveal James Bond pinball.

[00:35] And now we have, I think, one of the weirdest and strangest and most dramatic weeks in Stern pinball history.

[00:42] And I'm hearing more news from behind the scenes.

[00:45] I'm hearing about this fourth mystery game.

[00:47] I wanna deconstruct everything going on and do a show about this because I've never seen anything like this before.

[00:53] I mean, a lot of planning went into getting these games over to the UK.

[00:56] So let's start there.

[00:57] If Stern is going to ship a pro and a premium of James Bond all the way to the UK,

[01:03] you have to do a lot of work to get these big pinball machines across the seas,

[01:07] through custom, get them set up.

[01:09] And then the unthinkable happened for Stern.

[01:12] And I wanna tell you what I'm hearing.

[01:14] Well, first and foremost, I am hearing that Stern pinball is pissed.

[01:18] They are very pissed off that these photos leaked.

[01:21] And they know who leaked all the photos.

[01:24] You know how they know who leaked these photos?

[01:26] If you look at them, you can see in the reflection of the LCD screen area,

[01:32] it almost acts as like a black mirror.

[01:34] You can see the person taking the photos is wearing some bright yellow high-viz jacket.

[01:41] And the moment they saw that, I'm hearing, they knew exactly who took all these photos.

[01:47] They knew who leaked this to the world.

[01:50] And I believe it's someone associated with the UK show in pinball.

[01:53] And Stern knows exactly who it is, and they are super pissed off.

[01:58] But I wanna play Devil's Advocate.

[02:00] What did Stern think was going to happen when they unbox these games on a show floor

[02:07] in which people are walking around the show floor?

[02:10] And it's IAPA.

[02:11] Like, these are all people that are associated with the amusement industry

[02:15] and people who can't wait to see new reveals of games.

[02:19] And everybody knew that James Bond was going to be at the show.

[02:23] Why didn't Stern just set up some pipe and drapes?

[02:26] Right?

[02:26] You could block off your entire area with black drapes

[02:30] so nobody can see what you're doing in your booth area.

[02:33] And then you unbox the game.

[02:35] Or even better yet, Stern, if you know that the big reveal is happening Tuesday morning,

[02:41] why wouldn't you just wait until then to unbox the games?

[02:46] Like, I understand that they're mad.

[02:48] I understand that they trusted this individual.

[02:51] But come on, Stern, you gotta know what you're doing.

[02:54] No one's under NDA.

[02:55] You're setting this up at a trade show.

[02:58] This was bound to happen.

[02:59] Here's where the drama starts, because you gotta think about it like this.

[03:03] The Queen passed away a few days ago.

[03:05] Stern Pimbal knew that all of these events were gonna be going on

[03:08] in terms of the national mourning of the Queen's passing away.

[03:12] And they knew that when they were still setting up these games.

[03:15] So what I'm hearing happened was this.

[03:18] I'm hearing that the reason why they delayed the reveal of the game

[03:21] wasn't because of the Queen.

[03:23] It was really because of the leaks of the images.

[03:27] And here's what I'm hearing happened.

[03:28] Eon, who's the license holder for James Bond, is really, really difficult to work with.

[03:34] I heard from someone over at Stern that this is one of the most difficult license holders

[03:39] they've ever worked with.

[03:41] And that's why you don't see much James Bond stuff out in the world.

[03:44] And so when Stern broke the news to Eon that images of the game leaked.

[03:50] I'm hearing Eon like flipped out and they basically said that's it.

[03:54] Nope, we're not doing it.

[03:56] And they probably were on the fence anyway about doing it because of all the mourning

[04:00] going on in the UK.

[04:01] And I think this was just the straw that broke the camel's back.

[04:05] And they were like, get the games off the floor, because they did.

[04:08] They removed the games off the floor.

[04:10] And that's it.

[04:11] We're not showing the game.

[04:12] Maybe this was a move by them to punish Stern because they feel like Stern burned them.

[04:16] Like how did images get out, Stern?

[04:19] You were in charge of setting up your booth.

[04:21] You were in charge of keeping this thing a secret.

[04:23] And now the game has been revealed.

[04:25] No matter what happens next week, the entire game has been revealed.

[04:29] And here's what's funny about it all.

[04:30] Did you see Pinside?

[04:32] They took down the images.

[04:33] I mean, Pinside legitimately has removed the images from the internet.

[04:38] I mean, you can't control this anymore.

[04:40] I've got images up on my website.

[04:42] I've got images up on Facebook.

[04:44] Stern doesn't own the images.

[04:46] Once these images have leaked, they have no legal power to tell you to take them down.

[04:51] There's absolutely nothing they can do.

[04:53] It is out there.

[04:54] It was shared by people who were not under NDA.

[04:57] I'm not under NDA.

[04:59] Everybody's now looking at the game.

[05:01] Everybody now knows what's in the game.

[05:03] This is really, really bad.

[05:04] And I hear that Stern is so mad right now.

[05:08] And they are so upset.

[05:09] And obviously, their vitriol is most likely pointed at the individual that leaked everything.

[05:16] And I just want to say this.

[05:17] For once, for once, it wasn't Canada.

[05:20] It wasn't Canada.

[05:21] I did not hop on a plane and go to the UK and dress up like James Bond and sneak into this

[05:28] iApp a show and take photos of this machine.

[05:31] But I'm not going to take these photos down now.

[05:33] There's absolutely no reason why I would.

[05:35] Look, and I still think as mad as Stern is,

[05:38] I think they need to accept 100% blame here because I've launched products at trade shows.

[05:45] It is not that hard to keep a pinball machine a secret until you're ready to show the world.

[05:52] It's actually so easy.

[05:54] And the fact that they just did it this way,

[05:56] it just shows that Stern does not understand how to market their products in a modern world.

[06:03] They still don't get it.

[06:05] And this should be a wake up call because their marketing department keeps letting them down.

[06:11] And it's painful for me to see such marketing mistakes because you have a product,

[06:16] you don't even need to create the demand.

[06:18] You need to make the launch special.

[06:21] The reason why you need to make the launch special is you need to make your license holders happy.

[06:26] That's the whole reason why you need to nail it.

[06:28] And they completely fumbled it.

[06:30] And this must be a really painful week for Stern

[06:33] because now they've got all these people over there expecting to see James Bond at IAPA.

[06:38] Like people flew in, distributors are there.

[06:40] Now no one's getting to see it.

[06:42] I heard they might do an event tonight behind closed doors,

[06:45] but for the most part, now it's a disappointing trip for them.

[06:48] Think about all the money they spent bringing the product there.

[06:51] All the personnel from Stern who flew over there for this moment, now it's not going to happen.

[06:56] And so now the rumor is we're going to see this game revealed for the second time next week.

[07:02] Now, speaking of delays, I'm also going to delay my Bond LE raffle until the following weekend.

[07:09] So September 24th now, because it would be silly to do the raffle now.

[07:13] We don't know what the game looks like.

[07:15] We don't know the price.

[07:16] So I'm going to hold off on it.

[07:18] And if I go to the CoinTaker tailgating party, I will do it live from there.

[07:23] So that'll be super fun.

[07:25] OK, so here's the other thing, right?

[07:26] It is that Canada was told today that the mystery fourth game that is coming out from this franchise is going to be a Keith Elwyn designed game.

[07:35] And this is just like mind blowing.

[07:37] And I will say this, I was nervous about reporting this because I know that my credibility is somewhat on the line.

[07:44] I would also argue that if you ask Pinsight, I have no credibility left, but this is why this show is fun.

[07:51] This is why it's entertaining.

[07:52] It is fun to speculate about this stuff.

[07:55] But I'm hearing from a very good source that this is going to be what the mystery special pin is.

[08:00] It's going to be a 60th anniversary of James Bond designed by Keith Elwyn.

[08:06] Now, let's stop right there.

[08:07] How are they going to do that?

[08:09] Even as I report this rumor, I'm on the fence about how does this make sense?

[08:13] Because George Gomez is not going to want to be upstaged by Keith Elwyn.

[08:19] So let's think about it.

[08:20] Let's say this is actually going to happen, which I think it is.

[08:23] Then what kind of game would Keith Elwyn design?

[08:26] Is it going to be a full featured game?

[08:28] Is it going to feature George Gomez's mechs, but just maybe laid out differently?

[08:31] Maybe it's a single level game that looks like it came out in the 1960s.

[08:35] But here's the thing.

[08:36] If it's based on the 60th anniversary of James Bond, maybe this version has some Roger Moore in it.

[08:42] And maybe it has some Daniel Craig in it.

[08:45] That seems like really hard to do on a licensing standpoint.

[08:47] I don't know any other details other than I'm being told it's a Keith Elwyn pin.

[08:53] I heard that it's not going to be limited and it's going to be more like made to order

[08:56] and dealers are going to set the price on it.

[08:59] This has never been done before.

[09:01] I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before, ever.

[09:04] It's crazy, absolutely crazy.

[09:07] And I hope it's true because if it is true, John over at Jack Barr promised me a day of free frozen margaritas.

[09:15] And he also said he would join the Canada club if this rumor turns out to be correct.

[09:21] So there's a lot riding on this.

[09:22] And maybe my sixth Twippy is riding on this as well.

[09:26] But here's another bit of news associated with this rumor.

[09:29] I am hearing that this Keith Elwyn 60th anniversary bond will be unveiled at the British Film Institute's

[09:37] celebration of James Bond, which is taking place September 30th through October 2nd.

[09:43] So that's just two weeks from now.

[09:45] So this is going to be a really, really interesting next two to three weeks for Stern Pinball.

[09:50] I think Stern is super pissed.

[09:52] I think they worked really hard on this game.

[09:55] I think they've been waiting to launch this game for like eight, nine months now.

[09:59] And this is not the return they wanted.

[10:01] I think it's a wake up call for Stern.

[10:03] I understand that they did not anticipate the Queen to pass away.

[10:07] And they weren't expecting this 10 day morning period of the Queen.

[10:11] But here's the part that I still don't get.

[10:13] If they knew this was happening, then why were they setting the games up?

[10:17] This leads me to believe that it was the leaks of the images that pissed off the license holder.

[10:24] And that is why they said, pull the plug on it.

[10:26] I do think they might be using the Queen's morning period as an alternative reason why

[10:31] they delayed the launch.

[10:32] But I think the real reason they delayed it is they pissed off the license holder

[10:37] and they didn't keep the reveal secret.

[10:39] And now it's been spoiled a week from now.

[10:42] Nobody will care.

[10:43] But I will say this.

[10:44] I've been reading your comments on this game and I've been seeing the community's response

[10:48] to this game.

[10:49] And I think the response is pretty universally this.

[10:52] Everybody loves the fun mechs in this game.

[10:55] And I think almost everybody out there thinks the artwork is a letdown.

[11:00] And that is where we are at right now with these games.

[11:03] And we don't know anything about the code.

[11:04] We don't know who's coding it.

[11:06] It might be Dwight.

[11:07] We're seeing that multiplier and you're going to be mashing the button to increase your multiplier.

[11:11] I really hope it's not that.

[11:12] But this week has really turned out to be the week Stern pinball really fumbled something

[11:19] they should have been tighter on.

[11:20] And I mean that.

[11:21] And I really do mean this.

[11:22] Stern pinball, you know how to reach Canada.

[11:25] If you want to learn how to market these things a little bit better, you need to step up your game.

[11:29] You are the world's number one pinball company.

[11:32] You have such great professionals at every level of your organization.

[11:37] But your marketing department continues to mess this up every single launch.

[11:41] And I think you need to get Mr. Sharp in a room and Jody in a room and really think about this.

[11:46] Because maybe hire an agency, get more professional.

[11:49] Like Jersey Jack pinball hires a video production company to reveal the game to the world in the

[11:55] most polished professional way.

[11:57] Why don't you do the same?

[11:59] This almost feels a little bit like arrogance.

[12:02] Like we don't have to do it.

[12:04] And this is what happens.

[12:05] You really look silly launching a game like this.

[12:08] It's like you're just winging it.

[12:10] Like I don't understand how they even let this leak happen.

[12:12] Like they could have ushered in the games, in boxes on Tuesday and just did an unboxing video

[12:20] of James Bond for the first time ever.

[12:22] Like why not do it that way?

[12:23] You could have put them in black boxes with 007 on it.

[12:27] And that would have been awesome.

[12:28] And then you could have leaked that to the world.

[12:30] Two black boxes with 007 written in gold and you are going to unbox them live in front of

[12:37] everybody in the world come Tuesday to kick off IAPA.

[12:40] What were you thinking?

[12:41] Just having them on the floor with the glass off and like a leveler on the play field.

[12:46] And people are walking around the show with cell phones stern.

[12:50] You really have nobody to blame but yourself.

[12:52] Everybody, I love doing this show.

[12:55] This is the craziest week.

[12:56] Like either Canada is going to hit this rumor on the head or I am going to get made fun of.

[13:02] Now I'm used to getting made fun of but I hope you're entertained.

[13:06] I hope you enjoy this show and thank you so much.

[13:09] We are close to 550 club members.

[13:13] This is insane.

[13:14] It is driving the haters nuts that everyone continues to have so much fun hanging out in the

[13:19] Canadian club.

[13:20] We'll talk to you soon.
