[00:00] If I had a million dollars, if I had a million dollars,

[00:07] Well, I'd buy you a house, I would buy you a house.

[00:18] All right, kids, welcome to episode 406 of Canadian Spinball Podcast. I'm your host,

[00:23] Canada. It is Friday. It is 11.05 in the morning. I should be at work. I am hungover.

[00:29] I am going to do a 20 minute show because I have to get to a noon meeting. Now,

[00:33] we're going to prove on this episode of Canada's Spinball Podcast that I can do

[00:37] quality and quantity at the exact same time. So you can drain that or save that,

[00:43] kid and bill. All right, so here's what's going to happen in the pinball world. I am

[00:46] not going to be at expo, but I think I could maybe give some information that

[00:52] might make Canada the talk of pinball expo this year. I'm going to just have you guys

[00:57] guessing what that's going to be. But here's the thing. I'll talk about it at the end of this show.

[01:01] Let's talk about what's going on in the pinball world right now. So I can't believe it.

[01:05] L. Vyras are being unboxed as we speak this week. And owners of the game are starting to play the

[01:13] game and give their first impressions of the game. And we've said it before. Say what you will

[01:18] about Stern Pimball. Say what you will about the other pinball manufacturers out there.

[01:23] It is incredible how quickly this game went from announcement reveal to streaming to in your home

[01:31] record time. I mean, I think it was only like two weeks this time of the four people were unboxing

[01:36] the game. Now that is incredible. And no one else out there can even come close to this level

[01:43] of efficiency in the pinball world. And I think because of that efficiency, I'm here to say because

[01:49] we all know that Stern Pimball is in putting the most into these games. We know that they know that.

[01:55] And what I mean by that is we know that a Stern game probably cost around $3,000 to make. And so

[02:00] they're doubling if not tripling, if not, you know, multiplying by five, the profit margin on

[02:06] some of these games. But here's the thing. They deserve it. They just they just deserve it because

[02:11] they get you games quickly. I mean, I mean, it's just it's just that simple. Every other pinball

[02:15] manufacturer makes you wait months and months and months to get the game. I mean, think about it.

[02:19] It's been six months since people gave deposits down on the collector's edition of Willy Wonka.

[02:25] American pinball made people wait six months to get October fest after they revealed it. Right?

[02:30] What else? What else has taken a long time? I don't know. Suncoast pinball. They're out then

[02:34] they're out of business right away. Alien pinball years, Dutch pinball years, right? Stern pinball

[02:39] weeks. They have it down to a matter of weeks. Everyone in that company should be doing cartwheels

[02:46] in a victory lap. All right, but here's the thing. I'm going to talk a little bit about this

[02:49] later at the end of this show. I think Elvira, you know, a lot of us were speculating why this game

[02:55] come out when it did. Like why didn't Stern give Jurassic Park more time and why they rushing this

[02:59] game out? And I'm here to tell you like, this isn't one of the big ones. This is this is a game for

[03:05] Elvira fanatics. It's a game that was sitting at Stern pinball for three years. I think people

[03:09] forget that too. Dennis Nordman designed this game and it's sat at Stern pinball for three years

[03:15] until they decide it. Okay, we have time in the schedule now to make Elvira. They probably had

[03:22] time in the schedule because nobody had black nights ordered and they just, okay, what can we do?

[03:27] What can we do to put something else on the line? Because Stern pinball doesn't see what's on the

[03:33] line in terms of what game is on the line. They just see a game on the line equals dollars equals

[03:39] profit. They're making money on everything, right? They will always make money on everything the way

[03:46] they they handle their business, right? We've seen it before. Hey, that that that armor didn't sell

[03:51] on WWE. Ah, don't worry about it. Just throw it on Guardians of the Galaxy. No one will notice that,

[03:56] you know, that we did that. We all noticed that, but it doesn't matter because they'll do it and

[04:01] you'll buy it. I mean, doesn't Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy feel like 18 years ago? It came out.

[04:06] It wasn't. It was only like what a year or two ago. Monsters feels like in eternity ago in the

[04:12] pinball world. So look, I think it's exciting that Elvira is out there. It's clear that the code is

[04:18] early on. So it's going to be another lineman sheets, a long marathon, but we all know at the end

[04:26] of that marathon, it will be one of the one of the best coded pinball games. Everything he touches

[04:31] turns to a lineman sheets gold. So super excited. I just can't wait to play the game. We've had a

[04:36] lot of debate mainly around the pricing of the signature edition, which I still think is a suckers buy,

[04:41] but I understand why people buy it. Zach, many I understand why you won't come on the show. Also,

[04:46] Zach, many bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, I actually we need to start playing and syncing bye, bye,

[04:51] bye, bye, whenever Zach does his little segment. Anyway, so that's what's happening over there.

[04:55] Okay. Have we have we not learned a lesson in which if someone puts up a photo of a game being

[05:02] screwed together, all of a sudden, everyone thinks Dutch pinball has everything figured out. Have you

[05:07] seen this photo? It's in the Big Lebowski thread. There is a photo of a Big Lebowski playfield with

[05:14] all the mechs on it next to an empty cabinet. And it's a, you know, it said final testing before it

[05:20] goes into the cabinet and goes out to customers. And Barry is telling people that they're making four

[05:25] to five games a week. Okay. So I just want to call BS on this whole thing. I think he's pulling

[05:31] another Andrew highway. And here's what I mean by that. We know that he has a bunch of parts

[05:38] for partially assembled games that he got from ARA. He's got a lot of parts. But we also know

[05:44] that one of the parts that he doesn't have in quantity is our cabinets, right? And we saw in

[05:51] that photo, if you go back and you look at the photo of all the parts that Barry got from ARA,

[05:56] there were a few cabinets. So do I think he's going to be able to screw together a few games? Yes,

[06:02] I do. Now, here's the question nobody is asking. Did all 40 games go out to customers yet? Did all 40

[06:11] games arrive in good condition? Now we know they didn't. Some of the games that are being put

[06:17] together now are to make up for the insurance claims on a few of the games that got destroyed

[06:22] in shipping. Okay. The problem with this whole thing now is this nobody knows numbers, right? These

[06:28] games aren't numbered. Nobody knows. Do I have number like 51? Do I have number 60? There's,

[06:34] there's no plaques on them. So I'm not sure if they're numbered on the back of the games. They

[06:38] might be. Okay. But then we also don't know the number of parts that he has to start making new

[06:43] games. We don't know the number of employees that he has to put these games together. We don't know

[06:49] what parts are missing. We don't know the number of months. It's going to take to get those parts in.

[06:55] It's all one big question mark. And I think when I read people's responses, right? Right? It gets

[07:00] like 20 thumbs up when you see a picture of a game next to a cabinet. I just want to caution

[07:05] everybody not to immediately think that everything is going to be roses here on out. Don't forget

[07:11] the fact that this was a guy that lied to all of you out there. Don't forget that this is a guy

[07:18] who spent three years incapable of finding a solution. Don't forget that this is a guy who took

[07:25] people's games and now is reselling them to new buyers screwing over the original buyers of the

[07:32] game. Don't forget all that just because you see a game next to a cabinet. Okay. Now speaking of

[07:36] Big Lebowski, I put up a little poll about what I should do with mine and whether I should sell it to

[07:42] an early achiever or if I should auction it off for charity in which the proceeds would go to a good

[07:47] cause. I have to check the results of that. I think it was pretty 50-50 on that. I think there was

[07:52] more people about the charity part of it, which I actually would feel better about because then I

[07:57] have to run into the whole situation of, well, how do I pick the early achiever? I could put all of

[08:02] their names in a hat and pull it out and do it that way. But then if I do that, here's what happens.

[08:08] You appease one early achiever. The rest of them are still disappointed again. If we did the charity

[08:15] thing, I think it's a win-win for everybody involved and because it's for a good cause and ultimately,

[08:21] it's the people at the end of the charity that matter the most. We were going to do it for the

[08:25] children's hospital stuff. So we'll see what we do with that game. Here's why I don't really care.

[08:30] I'll tell you at the end of the show why I'm kind of easily walking away from the big Lebowski.

[08:34] What else is going on in the Pimball world? Spooky Pimball has a new VIP plan. I haven't seen all the

[08:41] details about it. I was just told about it. I was heard that for like 550 bucks a year. I think you

[08:47] join their VIP club. I don't know if it's called the Fang Club or something like that. I'm sorry if

[08:51] I'm making this. I should have listened to the segment. This is not like me. I'm just going to rush

[08:55] this morning. For 550 bucks, I think you get some knick knacks and whatnot. But you also get the

[09:00] ability to get to the front of the line when they make a new game. So if you saw the way like Al the

[09:07] Scooper worked, you know, if you were in the low, you know, numbers, you got your games early on.

[09:12] If you were near the end of the run, you might have waited a year. So this is a, you know, this is

[09:17] sort of like a way to cut the line. Do I think that will work for a chucking company? I don't. And the only

[09:23] reason why is I just don't think there's that kind of demand to want to cut the line. Now,

[09:30] Stern Pimball, here's a difference. If Stern Pimball said for 500 bucks a year and I told this to

[09:35] Zach Sharp, I emailed him. I said, Zach, you guys should definitely do something with Stern Insider

[09:42] Club where you could pay more. And if you're like a VIP Stern Insider, then you get the ability to get

[09:49] first crack at Ellie's and SLEs of games and how awesome would that be for them? And people would

[09:56] happily, happily spend that 100 bucks or whatever, $500 more a year to have that ability instead of

[10:02] having to chase down distributors and maybe getting a locked out of a game that they would want.

[10:08] So I think that would be a smart move for Zach. So Zach, take that into George's office and say,

[10:14] hey, look, Chris has got another idea we should do because we all know charging $15,000 for

[10:19] these games was Canadian's idea. I can go back and find the podcast in which I said it and they

[10:24] executed it to the perfect degree. So Zach, you did a great job with all that. So I think it would work.

[10:31] I think it would work, but I just don't think the demands there for spooky the way it is with Stern.

[10:35] Right. And because we see right now that spooky Pimball just announced that they are finishing a

[10:41] production on Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle. And if the timing is what Chuck is predicting on

[10:48] December 2nd, the final number 500 of Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle will be put out in the world.

[10:55] And we have to say congratulations to Chuck and Company. They once again have delivered on their

[11:02] promise. They once again will have got everybody their games in the fiscal year in which they promised it.

[11:08] And we can say without a doubt that spooky Pimball has shipped 500 more times, 500 the volume

[11:19] as deep root Pimball in 2019. I think that's a pretty amazing feat. After all, it wasn't deep

[11:24] root supposed to ship more games in this year than any other company in the history of Pimball.

[11:29] So congratulations to Chuck. We look forward to seeing Scott Denise's next game. I don't think

[11:34] it will be at Xbox because I think Chuck still wants to sell all Alice Cooper's. He has a few left.

[11:40] So if you're interested in one, you can get one brand new in box. And I have to say, you know,

[11:45] this has been one of the games where I definitely did a little bit of 180 and I think people really

[11:49] enjoy the game. And I haven't heard many issues with it. And I think Chuck and Company are going to

[11:55] continue to improve what they give us. Sorry, little burp there guys. I just got picked from the

[11:59] gym and I'm like, shugging a protein shake. You guys should work out. You should hit pause. Hold on,

[12:03] I'm going to take a sip of this protein shake. Wow, I'm like the other Pimball podcast out there.

[12:07] Right now, I'm actually going to edit out that pause. You know, when they're like drinking and they

[12:11] make you listen to them drinking throughout the entire show. Anyway, what else is going on in Pimball?

[12:16] We've covered spooky. We've covered Stern. Jersey Jack, you know, the wait for the Wonka

[12:22] Co. Nath the Code, the wait for Willy Wonka, Collectors Edition continues. I think we have to see it

[12:27] at at Expo. I also don't know what people are expecting. We already know everything that's going

[12:32] to be in it in the design matrix. So I think the more Jack makes people wait, you know, I don't know.

[12:38] The expectations are going to keep becoming more and more like high and the delivery of what

[12:42] people are going to get is not going to, I don't think it's going to meet your expectations because

[12:45] I don't think you're going to see stuff like different artwork on the play field. It's going to

[12:49] be the same layout. I don't think you're going to see, you know, a topper that's going to blow your

[12:53] mind the way pie are to the Caribbean topper blew your mind. I just don't. I really don't. I mean,

[12:57] look at the toppers that have gone on. It's like this. I told this to somebody the other day. Look at

[13:01] the toppers that have gone on every single Jersey Jack game other than pie are to the Caribbean. They've

[13:07] all been just like basic like plastic toppers. Nothing special. Okay. Speaking of, I do have

[13:13] confirmation now that that that medieval madness remake is coming with the big screen. All right,

[13:19] and I know who's working on the topper for it. Yeah, I'm not going to tell you, but it's going to be

[13:23] freaking awesome. So that's coming. So if you want to medieval madness remake, I bet they're

[13:28] going to showcase it at expo. It makes total sense. All right. What else is going on in the pinball

[13:33] world? I'm trying to think about how to like, let me see, you know, you know, me, you know,

[13:38] canate. I love to give you guys rumors and what's going to come and speculate on what's next and what's

[13:44] around the corner. Look, we're only at the 13 minute mark by this point in this week in pinball

[13:49] podcast, Zach and Dennis are like just getting into it, just getting into it. And we've already

[13:53] given you more news and good stuff going on. And we're only at 13 minutes. Oh my god. Can I get a

[13:58] twippy vote? All right. Here's a thing. Like I said, I'm not going to be at expo. But I think I

[14:04] could be the talk of expo. Oh my god. I almost forgot something. Guys, it's October. You are now

[14:09] officially allowed to buy October fest. It's the perfect game for this time of year. Oh, American

[14:17] pinball. Get the line. Ready. The order banks are just going to be flooding in with orders this

[14:22] week. It's it's it's I mean, you can't swing a dead cat without hitting someone that doesn't want

[14:28] an October fest pinball machine in 2019 in this October. It was it's the perfect game for this time

[14:33] of year. I mean, I just woke up and I told Bruno, I'm going to go out today and buy myself an

[14:37] October fest pinball machine. I'm going to do it. Don't you can't stop me. You can't stop me.

[14:41] Had an entire year to make the art package better, but they failed to do it. What a great business

[14:45] decision. Hey, guys, canate a pinball at gmail.com. Get me on board. Let me see what you're doing with

[14:51] the next game. I'll help you out. I'll help you out. First thing I'm going to do is fire the artist.

[14:56] All right. Let's see what's going on the pinball world. All right. So here's a deal. Here's a deal.

[15:00] Here's a deal. Here's a deal. Now I started this podcast with the song If I Had a million dollars.

[15:04] Right. And I love that song. I love you, Ed Robertson. I love you. I love all Canadians. Here's

[15:09] the deal. Here's a deal. You guys want one thing. I know what you want. I know what you want. I know

[15:15] what you're craving. You're craving a dream theme. Here got like real quiet. I'm going to get

[15:21] closer to the microphone. You want a theme that's based on something you love. You want a theme

[15:28] that's based on something you grew up with. You want a theme that sparks emotion. Sturge your soul.

[15:37] You want a theme that's bolted to the floor. If you're honest with yourself, that's the kind of

[15:42] game you want. Something that you have a memory associated with that's very, very positive.

[15:47] It's not black night sort of rage. You know it's not. It's not stuff like that. It's not, you know,

[15:53] it's not guardians of the galaxy. You want a theme that's a dream. I'm not going to tell you what

[16:01] that theme is right now, but I'm going to tell you this. It's coming. And it's the kind of theme where

[16:09] I'm here to tell you right now. I have to get it. I have to. It means more to me than Willy

[16:19] Wonka. It means more to me than Big Lebowski. It means more to me than Star Wars. It means more to

[16:25] me just because it's just more of a connection point. And I think what's coming is going to be like

[16:32] a one, two, three, four punch right now. And you know who it's coming from. There's no doubt

[16:39] they were going to do it. We've been saying it for years. We've been we've been pressuring them

[16:44] on this show for three years now. Can you just pinball podcasts has been pressuring Stern Pimball

[16:50] to give us more. And they've answered the call. They've answered the call. I mean, yeah, sure,

[16:55] I would like a little bit more in the games here and there. But what have they done? They've

[16:59] improved every single thing. But they continue to go out and get stuff that just will blow you away.

[17:05] And they have they have a tsunami coming of titles and things that are just going to blow you away.

[17:12] There's a little bit of a thing coming too. That's a little bit. It's going to be underwhelming.

[17:16] We'll talk about that on a future episode of this show very soon.

[17:21] You know, but I just I just I get all giddy inside and you know me. Look, I know what you're

[17:26] going to say. Hey, Chris, we heard you get this way with Willy Wonka. And absolutely. But here's

[17:31] the thing. You all know why you all know why my my love turned to sourness with that game.

[17:37] And I'm just very confident. Well, here's the thing. I should pause for a minute because I haven't

[17:44] seen anything. And I think it does raise a big question. A dream theme. Will it will it be a dream

[17:52] game if it doesn't have the assets we wanted it? Now that's a topic for another show. But because

[17:59] I don't know that yet, I can just tell you on theme alone. It almost would have to be the worst

[18:05] use of assets ever for me not to get this game. That's how excited I am for it. So I'm just here to

[18:11] say that. I you know, I'm trying to choose my words carefully. I'm just here to tell you this.

[18:17] If you are a fan of pinball and you are excited to see what comes out in pinball in the next six

[18:23] months, I think you're going to have a very, very amazing time in this hobby. I think you are

[18:30] going to have the ability to buy what I believe are going to be some of the greatest pinball themes

[18:36] and greatest pinball games we've ever seen. And for the old cramudgins who want to keep complaining,

[18:43] like there's no point in complaining because we can go buy a new medieval man as an attack from

[18:48] Mars and monster badge. Like it's the greatest period of pinball because when you think about it,

[18:53] the greatest games from the Valley Williams errors are now available. You've got stern pushing

[18:58] the envelope. You've got Jersey Jack pushing the envelope. You're going to have so many amazing

[19:04] games to choose from. I hope the economy and your wallets stay solid enough to go in on these

[19:10] games because what's coming is going to be so hard to resist. So hard. See, a virus in me was like

[19:18] man, it's like, I say this, I mean this, like a virus is going to be a little bit of a fart in the

[19:24] win when you see the kinds of titles that are coming out. But that's okay because El Vira was

[19:30] always meant to be a niche title for El Vira fans. Like that's what it was always meant to be.

[19:35] And it will be that. It's like I said, like if you're not into El Vira and those camping movies,

[19:40] why would you like run after this game? Especially when you see what's coming. And I know you guys,

[19:46] I see you guys at shows. We're all around the same age. We're all, you know, maybe you're a little

[19:52] bit older, maybe a little bit younger. But we all, I know what you like. This isn't just what you like.

[19:58] This is what you love. Okay. I'm going to leave you with that. More to come on that on

[20:05] Canada's pinball podcast. Now look, look, I love you guys. I'm not going to beg for twippy votes.

[20:12] I'm not going to do it. I don't need to do it. It's funny because I was just joking with Ken over at

[20:17] Special Wett and Lit and he's starting to ask for twippy votes in like the nicest way possible.

[20:22] Ken is like the nicest guy. He's like Ken's the kind of guy who just like loves like he'll give,

[20:28] he'll just say he, you know, he thinks Domino's pinball is like, okay, he's just I love, I love his

[20:34] positivity. We need more of it. I like hanging out with people that are much more positive about

[20:39] the hobby. I'm always giving him crap that I love build to, you know, Bill's always on the fence

[20:43] about stuff. He starts debates and he's on the fence about his own debate. I said, I'm going to build

[20:48] a physical fence in the Special Wend Lit studio for Bill to sit on. No, but I talk to these guys.

[20:54] But anyway, it's funny that we're all sort of starting to even talk about twippy's because it's

[20:59] so far away. I always say it's a strategy. It's like it's like the football season. You got to play

[21:03] your best football near the end of the season and just make it into the playoffs, right? I always

[21:10] used to tell that to Ryan C. I'm like, you guys peaked too early. You don't want to have your best

[21:14] shows in like August. They're going to be long forgotten memories come December, January. Anyway,

[21:19] everybody more to come on this show. But I think you're going to hear this stuff first on

[21:23] Canadian pinball podcast. I think you're going to be excited. I know you like it when I get giddy.

[21:28] I'm doing back flips all the way to work. I'm telling Brenda right now, you know what Brenda? We're

[21:33] buying this. She can hear me. She's like, Chris, what are we doing? We're going on a honeymoon in like

[21:38] 10 days. I know that baby. But if you see me out there only eating ramen, it's because of this

[21:43] new title coming out. Everyone have a great day. We'll talk to you soon. That was 21 minutes,

[21:47] Zach, many. See, in 21 minutes, we can get more excitement than two hours. Come on, Dennis. Stop

[21:53] talking trash about my apartment, buddy. It's all paid for. No more gauge. Just maintenance, which

[21:58] would shock all you guys how much maintenance is in your city later, guys.
