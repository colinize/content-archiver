[00:00] Oh, it's Monday morning.

[00:27] You feel that pinball energy ladies and gentlemen, we are going to get a brand new pinball machine a week from today.

[00:33] You're going to see retro atomic zombie adventure land.

[00:36] And we're going to talk about a Facebook post that Deeproot pinball put up this weekend by Robert Mueller.

[00:42] And I have to say, I have to say smack talk, smack talking stern pinball, the company that is shipped more pinball machines in the last hour than Deeproot has shipped in five to seven years.

[00:54] Oh my god, we're going to read what Robert Mueller said on Facebook.

[00:58] But here's the thing, all the smack talk is over in a week.

[01:01] You're going to see the game and we're going to be able to judge for ourselves whether or not all this smack talk is worth it.

[01:07] Okay, really exciting, really exciting September.

[01:10] I also want to dedicate this show.

[01:12] I want to dedicate this show to to concrete hard hat on pin side.

[01:17] Now, if you don't know his story, he is a badler.

[01:21] He's a fighter and he's been battling cancer for a while.

[01:25] And I just want to say concrete hard hat, you know who you are.

[01:28] I read your statement about how this show helps give you a quantum of solace and everything you're going through.

[01:36] And that's why I do this show.

[01:38] I mean, I've been back for just a week and I'm here to entertain you and give you my opinions about what's going on in the pinball world.

[01:46] We're going to speculate about stuff.

[01:47] We're going to interview people.

[01:48] You know the show 500 and six episodes of Canatus pinball podcast and it never ceases to amaze me.

[01:57] How some people just don't get the point.

[02:00] We're here to entertain you and here's the great news.

[02:03] If you don't want to listen to the show because it seems to upset some people, you don't have to listen.

[02:08] It's that simple.

[02:10] I love that the people who are so upset by the show the most actually listen the most.

[02:15] It's nice.

[02:16] It's nice to have them all here.

[02:17] Now speaking of that, first of all, Concrete Hard Hat.

[02:20] We hope you continue to fight and I'm so happy.

[02:24] I'm so happy that you're a listener of Canatus pinball podcast and I'm so happy that this show, this show helps you through some really tough times and you enjoy tuning in on a weekly basis.

[02:34] It's why I do it.

[02:35] So thank you so much for tuning in.

[02:38] I also got an email I wasn't expecting to get from someone who's been a real critic of the show.

[02:43] He goes by Chuck Wurt on Pinside.

[02:45] He's from Kentucky, I think Independence Kentucky and he just wrote the following.

[02:50] Chris, I've been really hard on you lately.

[02:52] I've been saying a lot of negative things about who you are and I just want to say that I've checked out your last five podcasts and I think you've changed your tune and I think you've turned a corner.

[03:02] And I just want to say, keep up the great work and I'll be tuning in from here on out.

[03:06] So Chuck Wurt, I want to thank you so much for that note as well and that's what I'm here to do.

[03:10] I'm here to entertain you.

[03:12] We're not here to do personal attacks, but we're going to go after these games and we're going to go after these companies and we're always going to fight to make sure that you get the best possible games you can and you have the best quality in those games that you can.

[03:25] I mean, we're not going to stop bringing up issues when they occur in the pinball world.

[03:30] Okay, so let's talk about a couple things that I've been hearing from people and I hear this all the time.

[03:35] Like, canada, you contradict yourself.

[03:37] You say one thing and then you say another and even in the same show in the same show in which you say deep root pinball must build games before they reveal it because if they don't they're dead on arrival in the same show you said that you said Jersey Jack pinball should slowly release and tease guns and roses.

[03:57] I hear it all the time, canada, you're a hypocrite.

[03:59] What are you saying there? You contradict yourself.

[04:02] So how can you be saying that? Let me make it real simple for everybody out there.

[04:06] First and foremost, first and foremost, I'm allowed to change my mind.

[04:10] But saying that one company needs to build the games before they show it and have the game on the line before they reveal anything to say that deep root has to do that or they're dead on arrival and then saying Jersey Jack pinball doesn't have to do that.

[04:25] When they release guns and roses and I firmly stand behind both of those statements and I don't think I'm contradicting myself and here's why.

[04:34] Because they're not the same company.

[04:37] Not every single pinball company has to go by the same exact playbook.

[04:43] In fact, I think most pinball companies out there are radically different and because of the current situation with each company they need to behave differently and they need to operate differently.

[04:54] And here's the main reason why and you know this reason you don't have to listen to canada's pinball podcast to know this a brand new company like deep root that has never shipped anything before to anyone before we've never seen the games we've never seen if they can manufacture we've never seen the quality they have no credibility at all at all.

[05:15] So nobody nobody's going to pre order games with a brand new company and wait months for those games or weeks or just listen to what they say the time frames going to be because everyone's been burned in the past.

[05:29] It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. They need to show they can manufacture games on day one.

[05:34] Now Jersey Jack Pinball on the other hand they've been manufacturing games now for like seven eight years so nobody nobody who buys a Jersey Jack Pinball machine is worried that they're going to get their machine especially not now with Leonard back in the company.

[05:50] So they don't need to they don't need to have the game on the line the day they reveal the game they just don't because people will still order the game.

[05:59] People will wait for Eric's game people will have more patience with Jersey Jack Pinball and they're not afraid they're going to get burned.

[06:06] Like spooky did the same thing with Rick and Morty the game was not on the line when they revealed Rick and Morty.

[06:12] Now why was that because they didn't need it to be on the line because spooky pinball is a trust worthy company and everyone who's ever ordered a game from spooky has received their game.

[06:25] So those are different playbooks for different companies so it's not me contradicting myself.

[06:30] I also think that one of the problems with Jersey Jack Pinball's guns and roses is that everyone knows its guns and roses in the pinball world.

[06:38] So so the cats out of the bag in terms of their next two titles being Toy Story and guns and roses whereas at stern pinball nobody and I mean nobody was talking about Avengers Infinity Quest coming out next nobody.

[06:53] Nobody except for Jeff at this weekend pinball he was the only one who knew it was a Marvel title nobody was talking about Rick and Morty either it's spooky pinball right because if you knew spooky pinball's next game was Rick and Morty you would not have been buying.

[07:07] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle I mean they did a great job keeping it secret but the problem is now that it's out there you know it's like you might as well maybe slowly release it in a way that builds up hype and I only said that for Jersey Jack because there's so many.

[07:23] So there's so many games that are coming out right now that maybe you want to steal some of the thunder now here's what I think they're going to do and I've been thinking about this all weekend you know just look you call canada hypocrite and then he contradicts himself and so you know I sometimes have a moment of reflection and I say Chris what have you said is it wrong is it incorrect.

[07:43] Here's what I think Jersey Jack's going to do here's what I think is going on in Ken Cromwell's head in the marketing department over there and I see key for his on pinside making some funny comments.

[07:53] I've seen his comments on pinside go read them they're hysterical I think what Jersey Jack is going to do is this and I think this is what they're thinking they're thinking we've got a game that we know is going to blow everyone away right we've got a game that we think is

[08:09] having incredible we got a game that this dude can a to over here is hyping saying it's the game of the decade and everyone is hearing how amazing it is because he's seen it and hey maybe he's doing the job for us.

[08:22] So we've got a game that we're going to bring out and I think this might be something like Leonard is going to do because he's a kind of guy where I think he's this is his approach he's going to come out last make everyone

[08:34] buy all their other games like go in and buy Avengers go in and buy a rise a go in on everyone else's releases and he's going to do the encore he's going to show guns and roses after everyone ran to other stuff and he's going to be like mic drop moment boom here it is this is and I just know this is the game that you're all going to want unless you don't like guns and roses are you vehemently hate actual rose or something I think if you love pinball

[09:04] and you want to see what Eric can do next I think you're going to love this game I think it's effort incredible and I spoke to someone this weekend who had a video of the game he wouldn't send me the video of the game and I'm not going to mention his name because he is someone you trust in the pinball world he has a podcast in the pinball world I'll say that and he said just wow just wait just wait you see it and so the reason why I started this show with Chinese democracy and the Axel Rose phrase it don't

[09:34] really matter you're going to find out for yourself and this is this is the thing about guns and roses from Jersey Jack pinball it really doesn't matter when they launch it if you have something that you know is just going to blow people away you don't even need marketing the only marketing you need in the pinball world is a great game I've always said this if you make a great game a great product that everybody wants that pulls people in that checks all the right boxes if you make a great game you don't

[10:04] that is the marketing you know marketing this is why I always sort of love and hate what I do for a living half of the time you need marketing is because you don't have any innovation you don't have anything special you don't have any new news you have no reason to be talking you have no reason to be generating conversation you have no reason people should care about you again today but when you make something amazing when you make something incredible the marketing approach is always different you

[10:34] hold back you remain silent you slowly leak out stuff like I used to do marketing in the video game world and that's what we would do in video games like we didn't need to drum up excitement for grand theft auto we knew there were millions of people that wanted it they know that there's thousands of pinball fanatics out there that want this game they know that

[10:54] so they are going I think to take the stage last and do an encore performance and in very much guns and roses fashion they are very fashionably late to the party guns and roses is notorious for going on stage well passed well passed the start time they now go on around 8 30 PM but when I saw guns and roses as a kid they took the stage at Madison Square Garden at like midnight midnight and this is a funny fact about guns and roses do you know that back in the

[11:24] day when they did use your illusion tour they were only paid about 20% of the total tour income because the rest of the money went to paying the late fees for all the venues because they played so late and they didn't give a damn and that's why I love guns and roses because they just they just did whatever

[11:41] they want it whenever they wanted to do it so I think guns and roses comes in at the end I think it blows all you away and I do think it's going to be game of the year and I think if you

[11:51] have patience like many of us don't you should wait for this game again like that's it that's it and I still see people being like I don't think he has anything and like all these people that are brand new pretending to be brand new if you notice

[12:05] this lately there's a lot of new accounts being created where people are pretending to be brand new on Pinside and they have a huge issue with

[12:14] Canada and it's really weird because you're like well how do you know all this stuff about a guy if you've only got like 17 post and all the sudden

[12:22] you're all about a podcaster like I'm not even on the site it is amazing that when you're not even on a forum the amount of times people talk about you and say your name

[12:34] they're doing the work for me it's really nice I mean it's really nice living in so many different apartments rent free around America thanks to Pinside

[12:44] so many people's heads I'm living rent free and it's great thanks guys I really appreciate all of the support but thanks for tuning in too because they know they're like listening right now they

[12:54] like oh damn it damn and I hate him so much and I'm listening again why does he think he has the right to be the spokesperson for pinball

[13:03] he doesn't even own a pinball wait now he owns a Rick and Morty wait now he's selling his Rick and Morty let's talk about that for a minute so I list it my Rick and Morty for 11,500 dollars all right so 11,500 dollars

[13:16] and as I look at the game right now it the game is gorgeous the game is gorgeous I really do think they did a stellar job on creating a game that just visually it is such a beautiful cabinet and it is such a colorful game I love looking at Rick and Morty I do it makes me happy every time

[13:32] see the game I also notice this this interesting thing is when you go to sell your machine especially if you're me for some reason when you go to sell your game or you're ready to make room for a new game which is a

[13:43] natural thing in pinball right I only have room for one game you know who hit me up and said hey Chris I'm totally cool with you selling your Rick and Morty because I know you only have

[13:54] room for one game you know who hit me up and said that Scott Denise the game's creator so he's cool he's like dude I'm glad you've

[14:02] enjoyed it and someone else is going to enjoy it and I know I would do the same thing if I only had room for one game and that's my

[14:10] predicament the thing that people always want to see me do is they want to know why and they want me to say negative and nasty

[14:16] things about this game is this is the reason why I'm getting rid of it like it sucks like no like I'm not going to say that and I

[14:23] think my review of Rick and Morty has been very fair I think there's a lot in this game that people will love I think

[14:29] there's stuff in this game that will frustrate people I'm not sure the code with where it's at is going to give people a lot of

[14:36] long term replay ability but they're going to keep working at it it's not done it's not even nearly done there's a lot more to go into

[14:43] this game they're going to be making this game for the next like year or so so this is Rick and Morty you know it's a it's a world under

[14:51] glass but there's not a ton of toys in it it's got one of the best sound systems and light shows and music I've heard in a pinball

[14:57] machine it probably has the best callouts and pinball history but it's a it's a game in which you know the flow is not the best

[15:04] world under glass in terms of wow moments in it I don't know you know mixed bag on that but overall a really good

[15:11] package from spooky pinball now the other thing I always hear about this game is what's $9500 so so like they should be giving you

[15:18] more but here's the thing here's I always remind myself this you know I can't be mad at spooky pinball for selling me

[15:26] Rick and Morty for $9500 you know why it's not their fault because I bought it for $9500 they didn't mislead me they didn't bait

[15:35] and switch me on the game I knew going in as a consumer this is what I was getting for my money so I have nothing to come I can't

[15:45] complain about that you they're not at fault for anything and I think a lot of times you know pinball people like they

[15:52] feel entitled to getting exactly this if they're going to spend this and I'm here to tell you right now you know what is in a

[16:01] game before you buy it so you should not feel entitled to anything and in fact the power is all on your side of the

[16:08] fence you have the power to say hey if I look at Rick and Morty and you say hey I don't see enough in this game to

[16:16] warrant the price then here's here's what you do don't buy it buy something else buy something that has more in

[16:22] it buy something that is a theme you love buy something that I don't know like whatever it is you're looking for if

[16:28] it's not in it then then that's it but to buy it and then complain you want more in it or to or to go

[16:35] in threads and constantly complain that it's not worth that much money I think it's a waste of time I think it's

[16:40] a waste of time I mean look is it worth $9500 and the answer right now and I'll tell you this right now is

[16:45] people are offering me about $2,000 over that for the game so it is worth over $9500 for people do I

[16:54] think there's $9500 worth of pinball stuff in it no but that's never been what determines price in this

[17:00] hobby we all know that I mean people spend $15,000 on a damn Elvira for a piece of couch there were

[17:07] people who bought Beatles platinum for no so it was a diamond edition yet the diamond edition

[17:12] Beatles people bought that game for $25,000 just because it had a silly plaque on it that said

[17:20] diamond edition one of 50 so value is in the eye of the beholder alright so Rick and Marty it's up

[17:26] for sale you know what I wake up and each day I change my mind on it each day I change my mind on

[17:30] it and for I don't know about how you guys approach your pinball machines and and the moment you know

[17:35] you're ready to sell it and for me it's always hard and I'll explain why because it's a toy that we

[17:41] play and for me the struggle is always this like some days you wake up and you really enjoy your

[17:47] machines and some days you wake up and you might not be in the best mood and so then you might not

[17:53] even want to play pinball or if you do play pinball you might not be enjoying it and that's always

[17:58] what's hard for me is like I just have like there's some weekends where I'm drinking beers and

[18:03] loving Rick and Morty other weekends where I play it and I'm like and I look for what's wrong in

[18:09] it versus just enjoying it and we're all like that we're all like that like we are moods change and

[18:14] we apply what mood we're into the gaming experience in front of us I don't know anyone out there who

[18:19] can just always play pinball with the most like you know open mind it like jovial nature every time

[18:25] we jump on a machine and I won't lie to you like I will go a week or more at times without even

[18:31] playing pinball and a lot of it just has to do because of life like my job might be super busy

[18:35] there might be other things happening my personal life and I'm just not in the mood I'm not in the

[18:40] mood and I it's a game in which it's more fun to play with other people and unfortunately this is

[18:45] the year in which other people aren't coming over to play these toys with us as much okay it is

[18:50] for sale for 11,500 and I've had interest at that price point and I don't need to drop the price

[18:55] to move it so good on spooky for creating a game that's held value for a very long time after it

[19:02] was released and with only 750 ever being made and it being Rick and Morty it's just always going

[19:08] to be a game that I think holds decent value if not will stay at the MSRP or more for a very long

[19:16] time all right so deep red pinball let's talk about this because Robert Mueller makes me laugh

[19:21] because it's a Saturday I think I'm doing something like watching midnight diner on Netflix I've

[19:28] already seen Cobra Kai two years ago all you Cobra Kai fanboys right now you need to just like

[19:33] you're not real fans you're not real fans the show came out two years ago and now everyone's

[19:38] blown up my feet about how great Cobra Kai is I would have been telling people Cobra Kai has been

[19:43] amazing for two years now it's kind of it's kind of annoying me like wake up us real fans paid

[19:48] the ten bucks on YouTube red to see that show all right so deep red pinball we just have to read

[19:53] this I mean I'm pulling it up right now so on their September 12th at 4.27 p.m. Robert Mueller thought

[20:00] it was a great idea to post the following on their Facebook page and I want to read it word for

[20:06] word we want to personally thank Jody Dankberg Stern's director of marketing and licensing for this

[20:14] wake up call back in 2016 and then there's a quote from Jody that says there are others trying

[20:21] to make pinball machines I think it would be fantastic if someone else came along and was really

[20:29] successful at it because that would make an industry I want someone to be successful as we

[20:35] probably do 99.9% of the games ship that's not an industry it's a monopoly and then Robert wrote

[20:44] challenge accepted just a few days left in the pinball world before deep route okay well look

[20:51] it's hard you know I'm laughing right now as I just read it it's like all right so you're saying

[20:59] that this Stern quote and this was a quote before all the other companies jumped into the ring in

[21:06] which Jody is saying like come at a you know it's like boring basically being lonely at the top

[21:11] with nobody else making games and Robert Mueller is saying all right we're we're gonna come out and

[21:17] challenge accepted which is also throwing a little bit of shade on American pinball because challenge

[21:22] accepted is like the hot wheels phrase so here's my thing here's my thing why why do this like you

[21:29] know what you're doing they know they're using Stern's words against them and they've already come out

[21:35] and said all of this bullish stuff about how they're gonna do this and do that and they didn't do any of it

[21:40] they didn't do any of it and none of what deep roots has said they were going to do have they accomplished

[21:47] yet okay so then you read this and I'm just trying to like go through the same journey all of you

[21:52] are so most people I think are looking at them right now as a little bit of a joke right like

[21:57] come on they they've already missed every deadline they haven't delivered on any single promise

[22:02] this company is a joke there are more people laughing at them than supporting them and cheering

[22:08] them on and and you have to say rightfully so if you said all those things and didn't deliver on it

[22:15] people are going to make fun of you and this kind of Facebook post is smack talk now you can't talk

[22:21] smack until you get stuff done right you can't talk smack until you win three trippies everyone

[22:27] else is talking smack about canada but we're the trippies you know when you're successful at what

[22:31] you do and nobody nobody is more successful at pinball in the history of pinball probably nobody's

[22:38] been more successful consistently making these games than stern pinball and so I get what they're

[22:44] doing here it's total passive aggressive play and I kind of on some level on some level why I would

[22:50] not have done this I kind of love it I love it and here's why I love it because this is either

[22:58] the most impressive launch we see in seven days or it's going to be a laughing stock I really

[23:05] believe that and I believe it because of deeper it is made it so that it's one or the other there's

[23:10] not going to be any middle ground because if what they show doesn't blow people away they're going

[23:16] to get laughed at like we're not going to accept it as being their first game in a by a humble company

[23:23] who's just trying to get into the pinball world right right when when spooky pinball showed everybody

[23:28] America's most honoured right I mean look at that game now that game is a laughing stock compared to

[23:34] how nice games look right now right but because it was spooky and they were a family run business

[23:39] and they were nice people everyone gave them a break and and was like more accepting of what they

[23:45] could do in their first attempted pinball right that's not the case with this company right it's

[23:51] the complete opposite arrogance ego bold statements we're going to do that and and that's fine if you

[23:57] can back it up so that's why I'm excited because like they they either have to back it up or they're

[24:02] going to be like laughed at more than anyone's ever been laughed at with the first game in the pinball

[24:07] world and no one's ever come out of the gate so bullish is this so this is a good thing this is a

[24:12] good thing for us the pinball community because now we get to see if they can back it up and you're

[24:17] not going to have to wait long and I can't wait their media event I believe is this weekend I

[24:22] mean it's coming up like four or five days like whatever they're going to show like it has to be done

[24:27] and the big questions remain are we going to see manufacturing are we going to how many they're

[24:31] going to make are we going to see more than one title how much are their games going to be I mean

[24:36] they've done a great job I will say this they've done a great job of being talked about they've

[24:42] done a great job of creating curiosity within this company they've done a great job of pissing off

[24:48] a lot of people they've done a great job of of making a lot of bold claims and come this weekend

[24:55] we are going to get so many answers to so many of the question marks and that's really exciting

[25:01] now if I'm them do you think they're nervous that Jersey Jack drops guns and roses this week and

[25:06] like could that just like blow up their entire plan I don't know you know I don't think Jersey

[25:11] Jack's going to do that I think Jersey Jack has his eyes set I don't think they even care about

[25:15] what deep route does I don't I don't think Jersey Jack pinball is like even like worried about deep

[25:21] route on any level I think Jersey Jack pinball is just like we want to make the game when it's ready

[25:26] and when we can like really blow people away with a launch of this game and I think they're just

[25:30] going to wait for that I think Jersey Jack is playing by its own playbook I really do I don't think

[25:33] they care that Avengers came out I don't think they care about any of it I don't I think they're

[25:37] just like we're gonna we're gonna steal when the when the spotlight is ready for us we know what

[25:42] we got and we're confident in what we got and we're just gonna make the best game possible and

[25:47] we know we have it and we know we have it and we know canada knows we have it and we're annoyed

[25:51] that canada has it but he's doing all the hype for us so that's how I think this whole thing's

[25:54] going to play out and I think it's going to be an amazing week and I'm not sure if there's going

[25:58] to be any more surprises this week but man September shaped up to be a really great pinball month

[26:03] this is going to be fun I don't know about you guys but I'm really excited to see where this

[26:07] all goes over the next few weeks and we're gonna have a lot of pinball to talk about and I look

[26:11] forward to talking to people over at deep route I look forward to hearing you know everything they're

[26:16] gonna say this weekend and I'm I hopefully I'm gonna be a part of it I think Robert invited me

[26:20] to be a part of it at some point over the weekend I know people are traveling there other pinball

[26:25] media are going to deep route I will not be going it wasn't that I wasn't invited I also just

[26:30] wouldn't travel because of covid I'm really taking this seriously I just don't want to go to an

[26:36] airport get on a plane it's just not worth it to me to put my health at risk I've been doing so much

[26:42] to stay healthy and to stay safe in New York City I'm not gonna jeopardize all that to see a pinball

[26:47] machine and so that's why I would not go even if I was invited even if Robert had a private jet waiting

[26:53] for me at Westchester Airport I just wouldn't go I just think it's a time to put your family and your

[26:58] health first it's unfortunate I would have been there otherwise absolutely I would have been there

[27:03] otherwise and I know this isn't the launch they wanted they didn't expect there to be a pandemic

[27:10] but I do know he has something special planned for this launch and I think it's gonna be a rollout

[27:15] unlike any we've seen before so I'm excited to see that as well I stern pinball Avengers Infinity

[27:22] Quest it's on the line already we're seeing pictures by zombie Eddie of tons of games being made

[27:27] and this is why it's always funny is that everyone else has always got all this conversation going

[27:33] and Stern's the only one that's caching checks right and that's all that matters it's a business

[27:37] this this is the business of making pinball machines and and they're the only ones that always

[27:42] just execute execute execute and as much as jody said that four years ago five years ago the

[27:49] truth is Stern is still the only one that 99.9 percent of the time just keeps executing right

[27:56] and they've got it down to a science and and maybe that's why it's just never that exciting to

[28:01] focus so much on Stern because they just always get it done sure they've got quality control issues

[28:06] sure they've got this but that's what happens when you make thousands of machines a year right

[28:11] everyone else is always like struggling to get anything out the door easy to criticize a company

[28:16] that's making millions selling thousands of games around the world and would I like Stern quality

[28:21] to be better absolutely would I like Stern to put more into their games absolutely am I excited

[28:25] by every Stern launch no I'm not because it's just it's all so it all happened so quickly on top

[28:31] of each other and it does start to feel a little bit of the same uh but if you like pinball

[28:37] you've got to like totally respect Stern pinball and I totally respect Stern pinball and I

[28:42] I think the man I have the most respect for in all of pinballs George Gomez I mean I've set it

[28:46] before without George Gomez none of this is here I'm not here you're not into pinball we're we're

[28:51] all just chasing down 90s machines spending 15 thousand dollars for cactus canyons right where

[28:57] the hell's that game where is cactus canyon remake Chicago gaming company to me they're the big

[29:02] like out of all the companies they know how to do it and they just can't get it done I mean it's

[29:07] just I don't even know I don't even know we haven't even you know we're not even gonna go there

[29:11] but anyway congrats Stern you did it again you got the games on the line and people are gonna be

[29:16] unboxing vendors infinity quests real soon and we'll see what the game is like at a box it was a

[29:22] great stream by jack danger of the pro version of the game which was a much better stream than the

[29:27] first stream uh and pinball streaming is always gonna be this thing we're like there's no right

[29:31] way to do it what it's the dumbest thing to watch for hours it just is ultimately it's unfortunate

[29:37] that none of us can jump on any of these machines right now before we buy them so we're all in the

[29:40] same bucket we're all in the same bucket only if you want an led you need to go in now but trust me

[29:47] I know I was wrong on willy wonk it I know people won't let me forget that it's like

[29:51] canator you you hyped us on willy wonk and you're never allowed again to to to hype anything

[29:55] I'm telling you right now I'm telling you right now gungeon roses I will fall on my sword if I'm

[30:01] wrong on guns and roses you're gonna want to collectors edition of guns and roses if they don't

[30:06] make 500 they'll sell out of them trust me on this wood people if I've ever asked you to trust me on

[30:12] anything gnr is the one it's the one it's the one and it's coming out the day after we all die
