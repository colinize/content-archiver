[00:00] May we all know that nothing ain't cool till you wear the new office sound of a coat of

[00:06] rolling down the jukebox, play the tattest tread right above the soup pot, or you get lost

[00:12] down some road.

[00:13] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:18] Welcome everybody to Canade is Pinball Podcast.

[00:21] Thank you for being patient with Canade.

[00:23] I just got back from Austin, Texas.

[00:26] I got back at 2.30 in the morning.

[00:29] I'm pretty exhausted, but that never keeps me away from the mic.

[00:33] So what do we got going on in pinball?

[00:35] So I've learned some information about the next game from Jersey Jack Pinball, and I'm

[00:40] glad I did some digging around because it is not the theme I thought it was.

[00:46] So I will confirm for you what it is not on this episode of Canade is Pinball Podcast,

[00:51] and this is how it's going to go because we're going to have Harry Potter on the line for

[00:55] like the next year.

[00:57] So we're not going to see Steve Richie's game for a while.

[01:00] Now I did learn some stuff about Steve Richie's next game, and I will share it with you on

[01:06] this episode of Canade is Pinball Podcast.

[01:08] But the real big news in the pinball space right now is Jack Danger going back to his

[01:15] roots, if you will.

[01:17] He is now going to accept a new role over at Stern Pinball as head of community.

[01:24] What does this mean?

[01:25] What does this mean for the future of Jack Danger?

[01:29] They are insinuating that he is going to finish design on one more game, but it doesn't say

[01:35] he's going to stay on as a game designer.

[01:38] Now you know me, I think Jack Danger is one of the greatest pinball designers in the world.

[01:44] Foo Fighters and X-Men are incredible designs, very creative, and I don't think anybody out

[01:50] there wants Jack Danger to stop designing games.

[01:55] But clearly X-Men just burnt him out.

[01:59] I think it just absolutely was a soul crushing experience.

[02:04] The entire X-Men journey.

[02:07] And I could see it when I went over there.

[02:09] I was in the factory right when X-Men was releasing.

[02:12] Remember, it released the same time as Avatar.

[02:16] It just looked like it was eating away at his mental happiness and his physical appearance.

[02:22] Just felt like the entire thing was grinding him down.

[02:27] And so I think this move, I haven't talked to Jack yet, but I think this move is an important

[02:33] one for him to reset and rediscover what he loves so much about pinball, which for the

[02:38] most part was always streaming pinball machines and playing pinball machines and being a pinball

[02:44] content entertainer and creator.

[02:46] Now I would hate to lose Jack as a designer.

[02:49] I don't know why he can't do both.

[02:52] Now I don't know how much energy it takes to design a pinball machine.

[02:57] I bet it takes a lot.

[02:59] And it's not just the energy to design it.

[03:02] It is the armor you need to wear to absorb all the slings and arrows of this community.

[03:10] It's a brutal community because you don't want to let anybody down.

[03:15] And there's so much expectations with every game.

[03:19] And when you love the community so much and you love pinball so much and you're putting

[03:24] everything you can every single day, your mind is bent on making the best possible pinball

[03:32] machine.

[03:33] I know that's how Jack goes into a game like this.

[03:37] And it's so hard.

[03:38] And you're working that hard.

[03:40] And it absorbs so much of your mind and so much of your time.

[03:45] And it's not just the job because when you're making a pinball machine, I'm just going to

[03:49] make an assumption.

[03:50] But I am going to assume that you bring that job home with you.

[03:55] And when work gets really difficult and work takes over, you start to miss your family.

[04:02] You start to feel like your priorities are a little bit upside down.

[04:06] And it's hard because you want to make your family proud and you want to work hard.

[04:10] But you also don't want the job to kill you inside because you know that what I always

[04:15] say is true.

[04:17] The real measurement of success in life is how many days do you wake up in a good mood?

[04:23] Now on paper, being a pinball designer for someone like Jack, you would think would make

[04:28] him wake up in a good mood every day.

[04:31] But then you get really close to the sun.

[04:34] You get the job at Stern.

[04:35] You got to spend all these hours designing a game.

[04:39] You've got this coder in Weisson who's doing his thing and it's not working out.

[04:44] You had to rush your game to market.

[04:46] And because you had to rush it to market, you didn't have enough time to catch all the

[04:50] potential issues with your very ambitious creative design.

[04:55] And then there's no going back.

[04:57] You're kind of stuck.

[04:59] They forced you to play your hand early and it's stressful.

[05:03] And he probably felt a little bit like this is unfair.

[05:06] Why do I have to rush out?

[05:08] Because other products that had more time didn't sell very well.

[05:13] And it takes, I would assume, close to two years of a person's life, put into a game.

[05:21] And then it comes out and people aren't happy with it.

[05:25] People are selling their spots for significant losses.

[05:28] And all of a sudden the dream job is then not so enjoyable.

[05:33] And you have to put up with all of it.

[05:35] And you don't want to let anybody down.

[05:37] Nobody does.

[05:38] Nobody makes a pinball machine and wants to let anybody down.

[05:43] Nobody wants to sell you a pinball product and not give you your money's worth.

[05:48] I mean that.

[05:49] Like even the worst pinball designers out there, they go into it with good intentions.

[05:55] So I feel like Jack just needs a reset and he's now head of community over at Stern Pinball.

[06:01] And you know how I feel.

[06:03] He's a great face of a pinball company.

[06:05] Like I would put Jack in front of everything.

[06:07] I would have Jack launch every single Stern machine.

[06:10] You know they've made a lot of really bad launch videos Stern.

[06:14] They've had other people make videos where they look like it's painting them just to

[06:17] play the game.

[06:19] So I think Jack is a great ambassador for pinball.

[06:22] But I'm a little worried about Stern.

[06:24] I have to say.

[06:25] I'm worried about Stern Pinball.

[06:27] I just don't know where this company goes.

[06:31] I feel like they're at a crossroads.

[06:33] I do feel like they were trying to find a buyer.

[06:37] I do feel like they're not really sure now if their own formula is going to lead them

[06:44] into the next five years in a successful way.

[06:47] I think Stern has been very successful the last 10 years.

[06:51] But now I think a lot of major major variables have caught up to them.

[06:57] And I'm not sure they really know how to move forward with the amount of weight that company

[07:03] is carrying.

[07:05] And I think that's the key.

[07:07] They are carrying so much weight.

[07:10] So many people.

[07:12] So much expectation.

[07:14] So much cost.

[07:15] I'm not sure the next five years look amazing for Stern Pinball.

[07:22] And they're in jeopardy if someone like Keith Elwyn leaves and goes to a competitor.

[07:28] If Jack Danger leaves and goes to a competitor.

[07:32] Because think about it.

[07:34] It does feel like they're grooming maybe Brian Eddy to take over from George Gomez.

[07:39] Who is the next in line.

[07:41] Is it going to be Keith Elwyn.

[07:42] Does he want that kind of managerial role.

[07:45] I'm not sure he does.

[07:47] And I think these designers now they are under so much pressure.

[07:52] To deliver a game that's worthy of being this much money that all of a sudden it's just

[08:00] not enjoyable.

[08:01] I don't want the pressure of having to sell you a $13,000 game when Stern hasn't increased

[08:08] the bomb for us designers.

[08:11] Stern has in double the size of the mechanical engineering department.

[08:15] And yet the price is almost double what it used to be for these L.E. machines.

[08:21] And that's just in a 10 year period.

[08:23] And I think Jack just wants to get back to doing what he loves.

[08:26] Now if he is head of Stern community he's not going to be streaming competitor games.

[08:32] That never made sense to me that if you're now working at Stern you can't test drive

[08:38] and help other companies sell their products.

[08:41] It just doesn't work that way.

[08:43] Good news is Stern has so many products for Jack to be the ambassador for.

[08:48] They've got three cornerstones a year.

[08:50] They've got remakes and it's not just what's on the line now.

[08:54] It's always fun having Jack Danger play games from the last 20 years of Stern Pinball and

[09:01] introducing a whole new crowd to those great games and having him play and walk you through

[09:07] the game.

[09:08] Nobody does it better than Jack Danger.

[09:10] I still think it's not a demotion but I think it feels like now Stern's not going to get

[09:18] the best out of Jack.

[09:20] They're not.

[09:21] He's an amazing designer.

[09:22] I want to see where his designs keep going.

[09:25] Now what does this mean about his next game?

[09:28] Is he working on Pokemon or is it Keith Elwin?

[09:32] The new rumor is it's Keith Elwin.

[09:35] So we've got John Borg's Star Wars next.

[09:38] We should see that in about a month and a half.

[09:41] Then we're going to get Pokemon and somewhere in the fall we're probably going to get Walking

[09:46] Dead.

[09:48] He wants Tron but it's Stern.

[09:50] They're probably going to do Walking Dead.

[09:52] I really hope it's Tron for them.

[09:55] Not even for us, for them.

[09:57] They need some hits.

[09:59] So I think Stern is at a really interesting crossroads.

[10:02] I'm worried about them.

[10:04] I think they're worried about them and I think they've lost a lot of their swagger, a lot

[10:10] of their mojo and again it's because they're underneath the tremendous weight of how big

[10:17] they've made that company.

[10:19] I don't think Pinball can sustain itself at that size, at that volume with that many people

[10:26] at a company.

[10:27] It's just not the kind of product where you're going to have that much demand to justify

[10:33] the amount of things they are supplying in terms of jobs, careers, factories, workers,

[10:41] wires, everything.

[10:42] They're trying to do so much and I just don't think the hobby is going to grow and continue

[10:48] to grow to justify how big they've become.

[10:52] Just down the block is Jersey Jack.

[10:54] Smaller company, smaller operation with the bigger theme, with the bigger budgets, with

[11:01] the bigger bombs.

[11:03] So is Keith Elwyn going to think about maybe after his Stern contract is up, is he going

[11:08] to walk down the Jersey Jack?

[11:11] Jersey Jack's also had its issues over the years but the games are finally shooting much

[11:16] better.

[11:17] The games look way better than Stern machines.

[11:20] There's way more you can do on the screen.

[11:23] It's just a prettier machine.

[11:25] It is a machine that feels more of the time.

[11:28] It is a machine that feels like it justifies more of these prices.

[11:32] Now I thought I knew what Steve Ritchie's game was and the title I thought it was and

[11:38] they might have this license I'm not sure but I now know definitively this is not Steve

[11:44] Ritchie's next game.

[11:46] And what I thought it was and I was worried it was going to be another avatar, I thought

[11:51] it was going to be Fast and the Furious and I thought he was going to make like his new

[11:55] version of High Speed and it was going to be based on the Fast and the Furious movie franchise

[12:00] and much like Avatar multi-billion dollar franchise but I'm not sure that people want

[12:06] to own it as a pinball game and so I'm here to tell you it is not that.

[12:12] Now I also do know what it is and I can't say because I swore to secrecy and I learned

[12:20] it in a very intimate and personal way but what I did here was this that the layout of

[12:27] this game is the greatest Steve Ritchie layout of all time and that it might in fact be the

[12:36] greatest layout and the most fun pin to shoot of all time.

[12:42] So like take that with a grain of salt please you know like I haven't shot it I don't know

[12:48] but now that I know what it is theme wise now that I know who's making it now that I

[12:55] know how fun it is to shoot if I put all that together I think it's going to be a hit game

[13:01] and I think it's going to hit the demographic in the right way and I think it's perfect

[13:06] for pinball I think that's the best thing I could ever say is this is a perfect theme

[13:11] for pinball for all of the obvious reasons when you see it and I don't think we're going

[13:15] to see it anytime soon so like I don't think we need to talk about it every week I don't

[13:20] think it's going to diminish Harry Potter sales but it definitely feels like Jersey

[13:26] Jack is a company with the wind behind its sales it's a company with some momentum it's

[13:32] a company when I talk to the people over there there's a level of optimism they have

[13:38] that I'm not feeling when I talk to the stern folks you know now look I still think Jersey

[13:43] Jack needs to make some moves I think they need to figure out some egos and attitudes

[13:49] that are over there I think they need to calm down on the code I think they need to make

[13:54] positive changes and continue to improve their product it's not just about gameplay the reason

[13:59] we don't find those games so much fun there's other issues you don't need 35 patches in

[14:05] GNR you don't need 96 modes over here they've got some work to do and they can achieve it

[14:12] but they've still got some work to do I don't look at Harry Potter and say they nailed it

[14:17] on every level I don't but they're giving you enough I heard too that like the CE is

[14:22] far outselling the $10,000 arcade edition nobody wants the cheapest version this is

[14:28] the thing it's like Jersey Jack is trying stuff they're learning valuable lessons but

[14:34] they're also learning people want the nicest version if you make the nicest pinball machine

[14:40] in the world which they do people want the creme de la creme version it's always gonna

[14:45] be that way because if you have 10 you have 12 if you have 12 you have 15 you know how

[14:50] I feel if you have like around that amount of disposable income which one are you gonna

[14:55] buy the only reason why the CE's would make me a little bit nervous is it's unlimited

[15:00] so I worry about future value but the current buyer base doesn't care they're selling a

[15:06] lot of them I heard it is selling on par with guns and roses and remember this is way more

[15:12] money than guns and roses so maybe the margin is better probably not because I think slash

[15:18] gave them everything and didn't make them pay extra so I bet the margin on GNR is better

[15:25] than the margin on Harry Potter because it's a much more expensive license but Jersey Jack

[15:29] is a company where I'm excited to see what's around the corner I don't feel the same way

[15:35] about Stern it's just something going on over there I just feel like Stern bit off more

[15:42] than they can chew and they're trying to find a way out of their own quagmire I feel super

[15:47] excited about spooky pinball absolutely I feel like everybody feels super excited about them

[15:53] I don't feel super excited about barrels of fun I'm not sold that David Van Ness knows what the

[15:59] pinball buying community wants I'm not sold on it I'll be sold on it when he drops a theme that

[16:05] people really want labyrinth and Dune are not that so I get there working hard I get there

[16:13] making games but they haven't created the kind of demand they should for people that have been

[16:19] in the industry as long as they have I don't know about Dutch pinball I don't know how they're

[16:24] gonna make back to the future it doesn't work it doesn't even work on paper it doesn't work when

[16:30] you try to do the math so what's gonna happen when they get thousands of orders they're just gonna

[16:35] collapse under those orders right if Roz is next yeah they'll sell a few hundred roses but that's

[16:41] not really what people want Melvin will get those games sold but man it's not like we look at Dutch

[16:47] pinball and say hey the next five years for Dutch are gonna be amazing no the next five years for

[16:52] Dutch are gonna be them trying to claw their way out of the back to the future orders and what

[16:58] happens if back to the future is not amazing it's not like they're gonna run something else it's not

[17:04] like they have multiple games in development and I think that's the key the companies that are gonna

[17:09] succeed will have multiple projects in development that they nailed the theme and they nailed the

[17:16] execution of it I think spooky's gonna do it I think Jersey Jack's gonna do it and of course

[17:22] stern pinball is gonna fight like the champion they are they are they're not gonna just like

[17:28] take it on the chin they're gonna punch back with Star Wars they're probably gonna punch back with

[17:33] another Batman run they're gonna punch back with Pokemon they're not over they are never over

[17:39] but they're in trouble people mark my words I think stern pinball is in more trouble than people

[17:45] realize again just because they're so big can they move that weight in the right direction that's

[17:50] the key everybody thank you for being a member of Canadian pinball podcast thank you for being

[17:56] patient with me I usually have two to three shows a week I'm a little off schedule I'm gonna get

[18:01] back but I hope you're having fun I'm having fun a lot's gonna happen over the next couple months

[18:05] and I'm gonna be here to talk about it canade out

[18:35] you
