[00:00] Whatever becomes somewhere deep inside, There's always this version of you and I,

[00:07] So just kiss me the way that you would if we died tonight.

[00:14] I promised you, if I ever got any information about what's coming down the road in Pinball,

[00:25] I would tell you first, right?

[00:28] And that's what we're gonna do on episode 700 and like 16 of Canadian Pinball Podcast

[00:32] everybody, I am going to tell you some information that is coming from one of my most reliable

[00:38] sources and I think this is gonna get everybody super excited about what's coming out in

[00:44] 2023.

[00:46] It's coming from the biggest pinball company in the world and it's something that a lot

[00:51] of you have been waiting for.

[00:52] So get your wallets ready people.

[00:55] It's gonna be a brutal year for your checkbook in 2023 but before we get there I want to

[01:01] ask each and every one of you a favor.

[01:03] Now you know when I started Canadian Club and I started this whole thing behind the

[01:07] paywall that my goal was to get to 1000 club members and we're kind of you know we're halfway

[01:13] there.

[01:14] I want to welcome Iceman to the party from Pinside.

[01:17] I want to give a shout out to Ed Robertson who's a member, Jack Danger, Zach Menne's

[01:22] listening.

[01:23] I know that Drew over at Poor Man's Pinball Podcast listens to every episode and Drew,

[01:27] by the way brother, I need to come on your show and give it some energy.

[01:31] That last show, those 20 minutes, it sounded like you were doing it from the bathroom and

[01:35] you didn't even want to be doing this show.

[01:38] Just hit up Canada, I'll be your co-host, Ian ain't coming back and Orbi can't save

[01:43] it man, I got you, I got your back.

[01:45] Just hit up Canada and I'll do your show.

[01:47] But my goal was always to get to 1000 club members and I just have a simple favor to

[01:51] ask each and every one of you.

[01:54] Every single one of you who's listening right now, you have a pinball friend out there that's

[01:59] not a member of the Canada Club and I am just asking a favor that you could invite one of

[02:05] your friends who doesn't have a club membership to join the Canada Club and just like that

[02:11] we would hit 1000 club members.

[02:13] I'm in on Labor Day, I love doing this show, it's a new month, we're gonna get a new stern

[02:18] machine this month but that's not gonna stop Canada from giving you what's coming out down

[02:23] the road because the speculation is where the fun is all at.

[02:27] I mean if you've been following this show, I am probably the only show when I hear something

[02:32] I know you want.

[02:33] I'm gonna tell you because I don't have to worry about not getting the interviews, I

[02:37] don't have to worry about getting shunned at the pinball shows, people don't want to

[02:41] take photos with Canada, people are not asking for Canada's autograph, they just vote for

[02:45] Canada every time the Twippies is opened up.

[02:47] Okay so here's what I want to talk about before I reveal the big thing you're gonna be waiting

[02:51] for on this episode.

[02:53] First and foremost I want to say this, I went to Jack Bar yesterday and I played more Toy

[02:57] Story 4 and I played it for like an hour and I had a good time on the machine but I want

[03:03] to say, you know John over at Jack Bar, he was told by JJP to raise the out lanes on

[03:10] the game and on the right side of the game, he lifted the post up and I'll tell you, it

[03:16] just destroyed the fun of the game.

[03:18] Absolutely ruined the fun of the game because now anytime the ball hits that left sling

[03:22] and shoots towards the out lane, it immediately drains, like it doesn't even hit rubber, it

[03:27] just goes right into the out lane and I'm sorry but this isn't gonna help, this is not

[03:32] gonna help this game.

[03:34] And again, I think this is a great location game, I had a lot of fun putting $20 into

[03:40] it but I would never put $12 or $15,000 on the table for one of these machines.

[03:45] Right now, on the marketplace for this game, you can't even sell a CE for $13,100, like

[03:53] it's crazy how much of a discount that is and people are still not buying this game.

[03:59] I still think Jersey Jack has to figure this out, are they gonna put the games on sale,

[04:04] are they not gonna make a thousand of these games.

[04:07] Now I heard from another reliable source that sales of Toy Story are somewhere around the

[04:14] same sales enthusiasm for dialed in.

[04:17] This game is not selling well.

[04:20] Le's are sitting at distributors, think about it, you're sitting with Le's, how are you

[04:25] gonna go order them the CE and have that sit when everyone is seeing that you can't even

[04:32] sell a CE for $13,000 and you're gonna go place an order for $15,000 CE's if you're

[04:39] a distro?

[04:40] I don't think so.

[04:42] This game is gonna be a huge problem for Jersey Jack and they are going to have to either

[04:48] get out the next game soon or they're gonna have to figure out a way to lower the price

[04:53] but there is no way Toy Story sales are gonna happen throughout the fall and into the winter.

[04:58] The jig is up on this game.

[05:01] Like everyone knows the same thing about this game.

[05:04] It's fun to shoot, it doesn't really have magical pinball moments and there's not enough in

[05:09] the machine to justify the price and that is the story on Toy Story.

[05:15] There is no code that's gonna save this game people, it is what it is and Jersey Jack's

[05:20] gotta figure out a solution.

[05:22] Now talking about it is what it is and is it worth the price as of today, total nuclear

[05:28] annihilation 2.0 still has not sold out.

[05:33] So they did not have a day one sell out, they did not have a week one sell out yet but it

[05:39] hasn't been on sale for a week, it's only been on sale for like 4 days.

[05:43] I still think this game is gonna sell out if they do the following.

[05:47] Spooky needs to offer this game for sale now outside of the Fang Club.

[05:54] Everyone who's a Fang Club member got the email that the game is available to buy.

[06:00] Everybody.

[06:01] So why are they still keeping this game for sale behind the Fang Club?

[06:07] There's nobody on Mars who's on a spaceship who wasn't on planet earth spooky when you

[06:11] sent out the email.

[06:12] I think it's time for spooky to now open it up for everybody else.

[06:17] There are people out there that don't want to spend $9000 on this game but there's also

[06:23] a community out there that just doesn't want to sign up for the Fang Club.

[06:29] They don't think they should have to pay you an additional fee for the privilege to spend

[06:34] $9000 on a game that cost $6000 just a few years ago spooky.

[06:42] So look, it's over with the Fang Club sales, open it up to everybody else and I think you

[06:47] will sell all $250.

[06:50] I mean we heard from Scott Denisi himself, he doesn't even think it's worth $9000.

[06:56] I would also add that I think the original version of the game with the chrome armor

[07:02] looks better than the powder coated version they're bringing out.

[07:06] It's almost like they're trying to do too much.

[07:08] They don't have to do everything but the original chrome armor I think looks much better than

[07:13] the powder coated version they are putting in this $9000 version.

[07:18] But it didn't sell out and I know a lot of people out there were rooting for this thing

[07:22] to sell out day one because they wanted canada to be wrong and I wasn't wrong and I'm not

[07:28] wrong on this game.

[07:29] This is a great game.

[07:31] This is a great $6000 game people.

[07:36] Everybody knows that.

[07:37] It's not a great $9000 game.

[07:40] It's not worth $9000.

[07:42] If it's worth $9000 to you congratulations I hope you got one and then I hope you see

[07:48] in six months how you can go get one for $7500 because that's where the price is going to

[07:53] settle when there's another $250 of these things out in the world.

[07:58] And don't say canada didn't tell you that.

[08:00] I mean look Toy Story I'm going to say this right now.

[08:02] Toy Story Pinball.

[08:03] If I were to predict how much Toy Story LE and CE's will be worth in six months are

[08:08] you ready for it?

[08:09] I think Toy Story LE is going to be a $7500 pin and I think Toy Story CE is going to

[08:17] be like a $10,000 to $11,000 pin.

[08:20] I think this game is going to be the single biggest loss in the history of Jersey Jack

[08:26] Pinball releases.

[08:27] You are never going to see games lose more value than these two games.

[08:31] It's the perfect storm of what could go wrong.

[08:34] Nobody wanted the fourth movie.

[08:35] The game doesn't have these magical moments in it because nobody remembers magical moments

[08:40] from Toy Story 4.

[08:41] The game is significantly overpriced and the game has significantly little in it and you

[08:47] add all of that up and why wouldn't you just go buy a dialed in for like $7500 or go get

[08:53] a Willy Wonka which is clearly the much better game.

[08:58] Everybody knows this.

[08:59] But Canada is the only one who is going to tell you this with a straight face.

[09:02] I just can't imagine they are going to make all thousand CE's of these games and I think

[09:06] you are going to see distributors getting really antsy because Stern's game is coming

[09:11] out maybe this Wednesday I heard.

[09:14] That's the latest rumor.

[09:15] On Wednesday of this week they are going to reveal the new game.

[09:18] I don't know.

[09:19] Are they going to surprise us after this holiday weekend?

[09:21] Who knows?

[09:22] Alright a couple more things and then we are going to get to the whole reason for this

[09:25] show which is what's coming next year from the big dog.

[09:29] I heard from someone who is working with Spooky Pinball on their next game.

[09:34] I heard the following.

[09:35] I heard that the next Spooky All Original title which is like Scooby-Doo apparently.

[09:41] I heard that it is a major improvement over Halloween and Ultraman.

[09:47] That it is a big leap forward for this company which is music to the ears of everybody because

[09:53] as I've been saying.

[09:55] At this price point they need to make the games better.

[09:58] Now what does this mean for Halloween and Ultraman?

[10:01] I keep saying this to everybody.

[10:03] Get ready for both of these games to be worth around $6500.

[10:08] They are going to keep sliding in value.

[10:12] When the dust settles a year from now I think these two games are going to be two games

[10:17] that not many people want and hopefully the next Spooky Game delivers because these two

[10:24] did not deliver and they are done on the marketplace.

[10:27] They're going to keep sliding down.

[10:29] Alright so huge improvement.

[10:30] So the one thing I'm looking for if you ask me I'm not looking for more artwork.

[10:34] They're not going to hoodwink us with art anymore.

[10:36] The one thing I really want to see in the next Spooky Game.

[10:40] I want to see some toys.

[10:43] I want them to actually show us they can engineer a toy or something with some complexity to

[10:51] it.

[10:52] If we want to get just more off the shelf parts or stuff that slows down the gameplay

[10:57] or ramps that are as wide as a three lane highway that's not what I want to see.

[11:03] They went from making games that were a brick fest to making a game that's just too easy

[11:09] to shoot and is too slow and doesn't have great flow.

[11:13] So I really hope that we get a game that shoots well but also has some toys and a great world

[11:19] under glass.

[11:20] I mean like a world not just artwork a sculpted world.

[11:25] Alright Kaneda what was in your coffee this morning you're just excited because you finally

[11:30] got a scoop.

[11:31] Now look I know that I've been giving you guys a lot of rumors of late and the truth

[11:36] is this like all of these rumors we've been talking about for a long time.

[11:41] Now we all know that it is either James Bond or Venom coming out next.

[11:46] I'm here to tell you right now I am being told it is going to be James Bond and Venom

[11:54] will be delayed to a later date.

[11:56] Here is another thing that is breaking news.

[11:59] I told you earlier that this machine was going to be based on Thunderball.

[12:05] I got a little anonymous tip and it said to me Kaneda you are 25% right on Thunderball

[12:13] and I am taking that as information that there will be four classic James Bond movies in

[12:21] this pinball machine.

[12:22] And so I am here to tell you right now I think James Bond is going to be based on four Sean

[12:29] Connery movies.

[12:30] And I think what happened is the person who told me Thunderball I think Stern is probably

[12:35] going to use artwork from each of these movies and make four different James Bond cabinets.

[12:42] Yes you heard it here first.

[12:44] I think they might do an addition for each movie and yet each game will have in it all

[12:50] four films to choose from.

[12:52] So I could be right I could be wrong but here's what they might do and it might be smart.

[12:56] Imagine if Stern offered LE's based on each movie in which they made 250 of each film

[13:04] in LE format.

[13:06] So imagine that imagine if you had 250 of each title.

[13:11] What if you had from Russia with love Thunderball.

[13:14] You only live twice and maybe Goldfinger or maybe Doctor No.

[13:19] It seems to make total sense and if they made 250 of each and there's four movies guess

[13:24] how many LE's that equals.

[13:27] One thousand people how many LE's are Stern making right now.

[13:31] One thousand.

[13:32] I don't know we shall see very soon.

[13:34] Here's the other thing I'm hearing.

[13:36] There is going to be an Aston Martin DB5 as the main mech in this game and it is going

[13:43] to fire pinballs.

[13:44] Okay let's think about this for a minute.

[13:46] If there's going to be an Aston Martin that fires pinballs well there is the machine guns

[13:51] that pop out of the headlights in this car or like above the headlights but wouldn't that

[13:56] really be hard to do unless you had a really big front fascia of the DB5 like as the back

[14:01] of the game.

[14:03] Like that would be super cool or I was thinking about it how awesome would this be are you

[14:08] ready for it.

[14:09] Imagine if they made a DB5 in which the pinball goes into the car and then you press a little

[14:17] red button somewhere on the game and that acts as an ejecting seat and you can eject

[14:23] the pinball from the DB5 whenever you wanted to add another ball into play.

[14:30] Just think about that for a moment.

[14:32] Think about how creative canada is and think about how now that you thought about this

[14:38] that would be such a dream mech to have in a game in Aston Martin where you as the player

[14:44] because you're James Bond you get to control the ejecting seat which ejects another pinball

[14:50] into play and you can eject that pinball into play whenever you want like whenever you need

[14:55] an extra ball you can add it as the player.

[14:58] Oh my gosh I'm super excited I hope they thought of that I hope the creative geniuses over at

[15:03] stern pinball can do a better job than canada who's just a PR hack in New York City who

[15:09] has no engineering skills whatsoever.

[15:12] Don't let me beat you at your own game stern.

[15:15] I hope this game has an ejecting ball DB5 mech in the game so we shall see this week.

[15:22] Alright before I run out of oxygen before I run out of air I'm bringing too much energy

[15:27] to this show.

[15:28] This is like the poor man's pinball network like on speed right now Drew you gotta take

[15:32] some lessons man so here we go here we go without further ado I'm gonna give all of

[15:38] you a scoop I'm gonna give all of you something I think a lot of you have been waiting for

[15:43] so I am here to tell you right now and I'm gonna put my show's credibility on the line

[15:48] that after all the years of waiting after all of the speculation coming in 2023 from

[15:55] stern pinball is going to be a super duper surprise.

[16:01] Now we know we're gonna get Jack Danger most likely he-man we're gonna get Gomez's James

[16:06] Bond Brian Eddie's Venom and we're also gonna get the next game from Keith Elwin which might

[16:11] be Jaws but who knows there's no assets apparently in Jaws you can't even get the damn shark

[16:16] apparently when you talk to people about this license but here's also what is gonna happen

[16:20] in 2023 and this is why stern pinball doesn't want you to know this right now because you

[16:25] might not buy the next game you might save your money for this so we are going to see

[16:31] in 2023 stern do something it's never done before we're gonna see stern pinball go into

[16:38] its portfolio and put an older DMD game into a newer cabinet with an LCD screen and we

[16:48] are going to see them vault a game that everybody has been asking them to vault this game is

[16:56] going to have new artwork it's going to have full RGB lighting it's gonna have improved

[17:02] sound it's gonna have all of that new lighting system they do too and so I just want you

[17:07] to close your eyes and imagine this game with better art better sound and better lighting

[17:14] and then look at your wallet and just take out a blank check and write stern pinball and date it

[17:22] for 2023 everybody thank you for being a member of the canada club this is the only show that

[17:29] will do this nobody else gets these scoops and nobody else would tell you because then they'd

[17:34] burn their relationships it's a good thing for you that nobody likes me here we go coming from stern

[17:41] in 2023

[17:45] I promise you that if I ever got any information about your dad I'd tell you first right

[18:01] I was paged last night came from your dad's office at the arcade

[18:06] so so the numbers been disconnected for 20 years two nights before he disappeared he came to my

[18:14] house he said he was about to change everything science medicine religion he wouldn't have left

[18:20] that sam he wouldn't have left you Ellen you're acting like I'm gonna find them sitting there working

[18:28] just hey kiddo lost track of time
