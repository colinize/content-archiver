[00:00] I got guns in my head and they won't go

[00:03] Spirits in my head and they won't go

[00:05] I got guns in my head and they won't go

[00:09] Spirits in my head and they won't go

[00:11] Let's...

[00:12] ...

[00:15] ...

[00:18] ...

[00:19] Alright, it's episode 237 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, Omni or Hosts, Canada.

[00:25] On this episode, we are going to talk to someone all the way

[00:29] On the other side of the pond, a good friend of the show, Mr. Neil McCray,

[00:33] Neil is a member of the UK Pinball community

[00:37] And I really wanted to talk to someone over there because when Andrew Highway was interviewed

[00:41] He talked a lot about how there was toxicity in the UK Pinball community

[00:46] So I wanted to hear from someone within that community

[00:49] How they felt about that comment and what they feel in the wake of the only pinball manufacturer

[00:56] in the UK collapsing a couple weeks ago with Highway Pinball

[01:01] Before we do that, a couple news items and then I want to read some of your emails

[01:05] And then we'll air the interview, how does that sound on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast?

[01:09] Okay, news item number one, and this to me is a very, very big deal

[01:15] And I know people try to brush it under the rug

[01:18] I know people try to chalk it up as being isolated incidents

[01:22] But for F-Sakes, Stern Pinball, can you fix your cabinet splitting issue?

[01:30] It is absolutely ridiculous that people are spending the amount of money they're spending on these pinball machines

[01:37] And all of a sudden, with every new Stern release, we're seeing cabinets split

[01:42] I don't see people sharing cabinets splitting on Tron or old like Lord of the Rings games

[01:49] I don't see any since Pinball party cabinets splitting up

[01:53] But all of a sudden, since Ghostbusters, since Aerosmith, since Batman, since the reruns of Metallica

[02:02] Now we have Iron Maiden shows up at a show and two of them at the same show have cabinets that are splitting

[02:09] And here's the part that just, I don't understand Stern, what's wrong with you guys?

[02:15] Because the whole community understands that if you use metal cabinet brackets on the inside of these cabinets,

[02:24] it will stop them from splitting

[02:27] And these brackets only cost what, $10, $20, and Stern is too cheap to put these things into their games

[02:36] And I'm sorry, but people have no confidence when they buy these new cabinets that they're not going to split

[02:42] And I don't think anyone who spends the kind of money they're spending on a pinball machine in 2018

[02:47] Should have to worry about the cabinet splitting because when a cabinet splits, it's not so simple to fix it

[02:56] This is like the major foundation for every pinball machine

[03:01] Yeah, it's easy to swap in a new node board

[03:04] It's easy to fix a mechanism and swap a new one in and out, but a cabinet, a cabinet swap?

[03:12] That is something that is well beyond the abilities of most people

[03:16] So I just think it's shame on Stern for having these constant cabinet splitting issues

[03:22] We're not seeing cabinets that are splitting from Jersey Jack, we're not seeing cabinets split over at Chicago Gaming

[03:28] I'm not hearing about any spooky pinball cabinets that are splitting

[03:32] Once again, we have the largest pinball manufacturer in the world

[03:37] And the product they're shipping people seems to have a quality control issue that they must be well aware of by now

[03:44] And all I'm asking Stern is this, stop being so cheap on everything

[03:50] We all know you can put better brackets inside those cabinets to just reinforce them

[03:57] I think it's clear by now that whatever they're using, whatever wood they're using, whatever process they're using to make these cabinets has a weakness

[04:07] And it can be fixed with some brackets, pony up the money and let's go

[04:13] Alright, I also heard the rumors to you about Superman 78 and Beetlejuice

[04:20] But I also want to tell you this about Stern's upcoming titles

[04:23] I know for a fact that Stern is going to start leaking out titles that aren't correct

[04:29] They're going to try to find out who the moles are, who the leaks are within the organization

[04:35] And they are going to put false information out there into the world

[04:39] So what does that mean?

[04:41] Does that mean we're not going to see Beetlejuice that we're not going to see Superman 78?

[04:45] I don't really know, I don't really know

[04:47] I think that those two titles would be huge hits if Stern made them

[04:51] So I would happily embrace both of those coming out

[04:55] I do know more information about Beetles that I will share at a later date

[04:59] And I do know more information about Deadpool that I will also share at a later date

[05:05] But those two games are coming

[05:07] We've got Deadpool and then Beetles, Bubba, calm down here buddy, I know

[05:11] I feel like Bubba, he's the one who's policing the new Stern rumors

[05:15] Alright, what else is going on?

[05:17] So Jersey Jack Pinball is going to flip

[05:19] They're going to flip the order of two games that are not even officially announced yet

[05:25] How's that for a major fuck up at Jersey Jack Pinball?

[05:27] I mean let's think about that for a minute

[05:29] These two titles are not even officially announced

[05:33] And now they're officially changing order

[05:35] And the order now is supposed to be Willy Wonka is next

[05:39] And then Toy Story is after that

[05:41] And I just when I heard that news, I said here we go again

[05:45] Here we go again, once again, Jersey Jack Pinball is going to completely miss

[05:51] And fuck up the launch date of a pinball machine that's supposed to be based on a film franchise

[05:57] Because we all know that Toy Story 4 is coming out in June of 2019

[06:03] Now we all know that the next Jersey Jack Pinball machine that follows

[06:07] Pires of the Caribbean will not be out until around that time

[06:11] So why would it be Willy Wonka?

[06:13] Why wouldn't you time Toy Story to come out at the same time as the movie itself?

[06:21] And I hear people are already like, well they want to incorporate the fourth movie into the pinball machine

[06:27] So that's why

[06:29] And I just think the whole thing

[06:31] I think Jack's timing around all of these games that are connected

[06:35] To film franchises, he's completely fucked up every single one

[06:39] I mean how much of a joke was it when he tried to release Hobbit

[06:43] To coincide with the Hobbit movie with the third film

[06:47] He missed that by like a year and a half

[06:49] Same thing with Pires of the Caribbean, that movie came out like two summers ago

[06:53] So everything Jack has tried to do, he always misses the hype window

[06:57] And the marketing window of these franchises

[07:01] And with Toy Story, here's the thing

[07:05] I don't want a Toy Story game with four movies crammed into it

[07:09] All right, Toy Story 1 is by far the best Toy Story of all of them

[07:15] You could just make an amazing pinball machine that takes people through the first film

[07:21] You don't need to have also Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 4

[07:27] I think that Jack tries to do so much with these games

[07:33] They become overproduced, there's too much they need to code into them

[07:37] And they become convoluted items

[07:41] Right, just make it based on Toy Story 1

[07:45] And you'd be much more successful

[07:47] All right, but he's not going to do it

[07:49] So what does that mean now?

[07:51] We're not going to see Pat Lawler's Toy Story

[07:53] Until sometime in like 2020, probably at the earliest

[07:57] And now think about that for a minute, two more years, two and a half years

[08:01] Until we get the next standard body, jersey jack pinball machine from Pat Lawler

[08:07] And why the flip?

[08:09] Because we just got an Eric game

[08:13] I heard Eric is also the designer on Willy Wonka

[08:17] So I don't know what's happening over there at jersey jack

[08:21] I just think their inability to get games out faster

[08:25] It's just going to make it harder and harder for them

[08:29] To be successful

[08:31] Who out there wants to wait two and a half years now for Toy Story

[08:35] You're going to have to wait another year and a half to get to like Willy Wonka

[08:39] It seems like they're not even shipping pirates of the Caribbean

[08:43] So I don't know, I really don't know what's going on over there at JJP

[08:47] I continue to baffle me

[08:49] Alright, anyone know where the Star Wars Topper is at?

[08:51] Joker the Year

[08:53] Where's the fucking Star Wars Topper?

[08:55] I'll show you where it's at

[08:57] Alright, what else is going on?

[08:59] Chicago Gaming Company has still not revealed the next title

[09:03] It will most likely be Monster Bash Remake

[09:05] And we all saw that some like pinball show

[09:09] Put up Monster Bash Remake as a grand prize that you could win

[09:13] Even though it hasn't been announced yet

[09:15] They just need to show this game

[09:17] They understand why they can't just reveal it

[09:19] At this point, we're well past T-P-F

[09:23] I don't know how they were expecting to get this thing at T-P-F

[09:27] And now we're like three or four months past that date

[09:31] And still nothing from Chicago Gaming on this title

[09:33] Alright, anything else going on in the pinball world

[09:35] The J-Pop thread continues to have pointless discussions going on

[09:39] Our friend Rare Hero is on another one of his crusades

[09:43] To tell us how he feels about

[09:45] Certain individuals which is fun to listen to

[09:47] Hilton is still a member of the Pinside community

[09:51] It doesn't matter how many times he causes people to lose money

[09:55] I heard that him and Robin have been in Cahoots

[09:59] About how to keep him on there for all the eternity

[10:01] So that's cool to know

[10:03] Let's see is there anything else I'm missing

[10:05] I think we've covered most of it

[10:09] Most of it, I'll say this before I air this interview

[10:11] And then read some of your latest news

[10:13] Or sorry your latest emails to me

[10:17] There's going to be more that comes out on Andrew Highway

[10:21] And I think we're at the point now

[10:25] Where Andrew just needs to go away

[10:27] And there's something about him trying to defend his integrity

[10:29] And stand up for himself that is going to continue to stick his foot in his mouth

[10:33] Time and time again

[10:35] And when you see more of the stuff that's about to come out

[10:39] You're going to understand the real nature of this individual

[10:43] And look, it's going to be quite clear that no one ever should have supported him

[10:47] No one ever should have invested money in him

[10:49] And you're going to want him to just go away

[10:53] And I think we're at that point

[10:55] I don't think it's worth discussing too much more

[10:57] I don't expect to see anything come out of the Pimball Brothers operation

[11:01] I think all of these new companies that think they can just turn the light switch on

[11:07] They're going to have a Pimball Manufacturing company

[11:09] Are foolish

[11:11] I don't think when you look at the amount of titles coming out from reputable Pimball companies

[11:17] That there's any desire or demand for any of these other companies to be successful

[11:23] That's the part people miss is that it's a very finite amount of buyers out there

[11:27] This isn't video games, this isn't cars, this isn't watches

[11:31] The number of people that actually will buy new-in-box Pimball machines

[11:35] Isn't that large

[11:37] And if your company has pissed people off, if it has a bad reputation

[11:41] If it carries with it a lot of baggage

[11:43] And then the game you release isn't even that good

[11:47] It's going to be game over immediately for these companies

[11:51] Alright, let me pull up my email here

[11:53] Let's see

[11:55] Let's see

[11:57] I'm going to try and go for the last one

[11:59] Alright, I got an email from Kevin Samborne

[12:03] What a joke

[12:05] He's seeking legal advice against you and rubber ducks

[12:07] What a meaty, breasted, zilch he is

[12:11] Well Kevin, thank you for listening to the show

[12:13] I did find it funny that my name appeared in Andrew Highway's list of people

[12:17] He was seeking legal advice against

[12:19] On a scale of 1 to 10

[12:21] How worried am I to get a legal notice from Andrew Highway

[12:25] Probably a minus 5 on that scale

[12:27] Alright, I got an email from Chris

[12:31] I said hello again

[12:33] I remember our conversation about P3 when reading this

[12:37] Might this be a rush to deliver like magic girl

[12:41] Was rush to deliver possible changes in production of P3

[12:45] Alright, so I haven't talked about P3 recently

[12:49] And I saw in the thread that some people are having issues with their P3 machines

[12:55] In terms of quality control

[12:57] I was talking about P3

[12:59] Because I did get an email from multi-morphic into my inbox

[13:03] And it said something that did make me laugh

[13:05] It said like, Pimbal Evolution Achieved

[13:09] And it was kind of like this

[13:11] Congratulatory email about this

[13:13] Finally after all these years

[13:15] The Pimbal Evolution has been achieved

[13:17] And I couldn't help but snicker

[13:21] In Jerry sort of proclaiming that some sort of evolution has happened in Pimbal

[13:25] And here's why

[13:27] In one day, Stern Pimbal will make more games than Jerry has shipped in seven years

[13:35] So I just want you to think about that for a moment

[13:37] That the amount of P3s that have shipped out are probably less than 30 in all this time

[13:43] And he spent seven years to get to 30 games out in the world

[13:51] And in seven years, Stern has probably shipped upwards of 50,000 machines

[13:59] So I really would love to know what kind of evolution has been achieved

[14:05] From the very beginning, we all know that Jerry was trying to make a new platform for Pimbal

[14:09] And he succeeded in creating that platform

[14:13] But the demand is just not there

[14:15] Why is it when you go and you look at all the different threads on Pinside

[14:19] You will have new game threads by Stern, by Spooky, by JJP

[14:25] All of these threads have, you know, tens, if not hundreds

[14:29] Some of them, you know, 500 different pages of conversation happening around these titles

[14:37] And then you go into the P3 multi-morphic thread and it's three pages

[14:43] I mean, what's the point of an evolution if it doesn't create a revolution in Pimbal

[14:51] And I think that's the big issue I continue to have with this platform

[14:55] Is we're still just seeing Lexi light speed

[14:57] We're still seeing the same games on the same platform over and over again

[15:03] And nobody really wants to, I don't know what point

[15:07] I mean, Jerry's got, here's the thing about Jerry

[15:09] Here's the thing, seven years, all the money, all the R&D, all the attempts to make Pimbal something new

[15:17] And Scott Denisi took store-bought parts off the shelf

[15:23] And made total nuclear annihilation in his basement

[15:27] And has now sold over 300 to 400 machines

[15:33] And that game would continue to sell more and more production can move even faster

[15:37] And isn't that the Pimbal evolution that people have been waiting for?

[15:43] Like a different type of Pimbal experience which it is

[15:47] And that's the thing, if you're Jerry, you got to look at what Scott Denisi did and just say, why didn't I just do that?

[15:53] Seven years ago, and now you would have such a successful Pimbal company

[15:59] If you would have simply gave people what they wanted, which is just Pimbal

[16:04] No one asked for these modular systems, no one asked for these swappable platforms, nobody asked for big LCD screen where the play field is

[16:13] People like looking at their play fields when the games are turned off, they don't want to see a big black screen there

[16:19] And so, look, and now people are having issues with the game

[16:23] And that's the other part is, with all these new manufacturers, if the game you get out there on day one isn't bulletproof

[16:31] All that does is make people hesitate to go in on the platform, nobody wants to buy something

[16:38] Where they feel like it's going to just give them a headache

[16:42] And these toys be quickly become frustrating items when they don't work properly

[16:47] You know, there's a lot of conversation around, our aliens gonna be worth a lot of money

[16:52] You know, if there's only 120 of them out there in the world, then I say this, as someone who bought Magic Girl

[16:57] It is no fun owning a rare machine when that rare machine A, other people out there got burned by the company

[17:07] And B, the game could break at any time and there will be no support for the game

[17:12] It is no fun having a game that you kind of don't even want to turn on because if anything happens to it, you're screwed

[17:18] And that's just the way it is

[17:20] I remember when my Magic Girl ramped shift and my great, it's gone, done.

[17:24] Alright, let's go to the next email here. Again, everyone, thank you for emailing me in when you do

[17:30] I will read your emails on the air at canada-pimbal at gmail.com

[17:34] I got an email from Rich Brett. This subject was hot air, Chris. Just listen to the latest podcast and decide it to email

[17:43] The notion that highway is contemplating a lawsuit is ludicrous

[17:47] The cost of such a lawsuit is prohibitive for all but the deepest pockets

[17:52] As we know, highway does not have such pockets

[17:55] Also a lawsuit across international borders further increases the complexity and of course, cost

[18:01] He does not even have the correct spelling of your name, imagine trying to serve you with a suit

[18:07] Do not give it a second thought and do not let it affect the podcast

[18:11] Highway is just trying to distract and obstacle skate

[18:15] On a final note, highway's final interview was such a self-serving dribble that it should never have been posted

[18:21] No value whatsoever. I wish the interviewer had never given him the platform to spout such nonsense cheer is rich

[18:28] Well Rich, thank you for writing in. I'm actually know it. At first I was like, I don't want

[18:32] Andrew highway to have a platform to talk. I don't think we should give him the time and day anymore

[18:37] But then I was actually, I actually thought Martin did a good job with the interview

[18:41] I have to say Martin, I was wrong in saying you would serve up softball questions to the dude

[18:47] I think he really did press for some real answers from Andrew highway and I think we got some very very incriminating statements from Andrew

[18:55] Which he is going to regret using as this proceeds

[18:59] I would not be surprised. I'm not the one worried. I'm not the one worried. I tell people this all the time

[19:05] Andrew highway is most likely going to get a knock on his door from the police

[19:10] He is going to most likely end up in court or in jail for what he did

[19:18] Think about it from his vantage point. Not only do you have laws that you probably broke because of doing fraudulent things

[19:28] So you've got to worry about that. Andrew's got to worry about the police coming after him

[19:32] He's also got to worry about these wealthy investors who are going to sue him with very deep pockets who he can't possibly compete with

[19:40] And then he's got to worry about what I think is the worst thing to worry about for the rest of his life

[19:46] And that is the individuals who he took money from and never gave a pinball machine who just want to physically harm him

[19:54] He has robbed people of their money and he lied to people's faces when he guaranteed he would get them games if they paid in fall

[20:02] Now he's got to deal with all of that. On top of all that he's got some podcasts dude in New York City who's been saying you know get your money out of his company

[20:11] I'm the least of his worries. And he knows that. He knows that. It's easy to use me as a scapegoat but he knows that the road ahead for him is going to be a terrible one

[20:22] Alright. Alright. I got an email from Aaron Nicholas. Nicholas saying really and it's a picture of an iron maiden cabinet split

[20:31] Well Aaron we talked about that on his podcast. I agree. It is ridiculous that stern cabinets are continuing to split. I got an email from Ryan

[20:41] He said thought you might be interested in these picks. Hey Chris Ryan T from Vancouver Canada

[20:47] Thought you might like these photos I took at league night as bad as highway situation has been I'm glad it's finally over

[20:54] The pinball hobby needs these black eyes to be over because the future is very bright. I played alien at last show as Vancouver flip out show and after a few games it wasn't bad

[21:05] No xenomorph headlock though. If someone could get these games going that would be awesome. I played Big Lebowski last year and had a blast

[21:14] Despite the upper left ball lock and lower play field not working it was a super fun game. As for Houdini the shots are tight

[21:22] But once you get the feel for them and hit some combos it's a pretty good experience. The thing I don't like is the stop and go of the trivia

[21:31] As a fan of pinball I hope J.J.P spooky American and hopefully a new name and new logo deep route can bring us some unique and fun games

[21:41] While the other 90% of the hobby stern can bring in more people who love pinball and more games like iron maiden can't wait for deep route toy story and deep route reveals in the months to come long live pinball

[21:55] Alright well first of all Ryan thank you so much I do appreciate you sending the photo from your league night it's crazy in your league you have these rare games like alien and the big Lebowski

[22:05] I do find it funny when people talk about those games and they're like the games fun except for this this and this was broken and to me like that's just inexcusable

[22:14] I don't want to play a pinball game ever where some of the major features of the game are not working. I've also been reading a lot on pinside where people who own aliens are like if they could just get this game working it's one of the most incredible experiences in pinball

[22:29] Those people just need to stop here's why look I get it it's got a cool light show it's got a cool LCD animations and like clips from the film it's got amazing music by David not even say his last name and correctly this time rare hero it's got it's it's atmospheric there is no one's ever denied that alien is very atmospheric it's a very atmospheric movie alright I'm sure all those elements are great but the mechanics of the game

[22:58] are built like shit the game itself is built like shit the game is going to break the xenomorph head is the biggest piece of shit mechanism ever made they didn't even want to make it the own people the people who had to make it were like terrified of actually making that thing after Andrew promised it would be in the game so that's the whole thing so cool you've got this very immersive thing that's going to break on you in any minute enjoy that game guys all right let's see

[23:27] I got an email all right from Jonathan Houston last chance to advertise in pinball magazine number five all right you know what Jonathan I'm going to I'm going to let that last chance pass we buy I don't need no advertisement in a pinball magazine pinball doesn't happen in a magazine it happens on podcasts and on forms no actually his magazine is great it goes much further into depth it's more of a it's more like in depth

[23:56] articles about the pinball world and the pinball hobby that I think you guys would love if you haven't seen that magazine that would definitely subscribe to it and check it out all right I'm going to stop rambling I'm going to air this interview from the UK Niel McCrae is a great guy and we're going to talk all about what happened at highway pinball and then we're going to start to close the door on this chapter I think it's coming to an end and then we're going to start to talk more and more about where the f the premium artwork is on iron maiden and I'm going to talk about the

[24:26] and where is Star Wars topper is it a crazy may 4th of 2018 came and went and there's still no goddamn topper I think we all should just not stop banging on the door of stern for that topper I mean what what what kind of topper is it that it takes Disney a year to approve it right I mean did they just completely fuck up this topper I mean Disney can't be that hard to get it right can they unbelievable whoever was in charge of the Star Wars topper for stern they should just pull

[24:55] that guy into a room and be like we hate to break it to you it's your last day here it's been two years since the game's been out it's been like over a year and a half you're fired goodbye cyan our ladies and gentlemen here's Niel ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome back to canators pinball podcast a friend of mine over in the UK Niel McCrae who's a big pinball enthusiasts Niel welcome to the show

[25:21] hey hey Chris I'm on good to hear from you two man and I'm excited to have this conversation because you know if the topic is going to be I we've we've all been following highway pinball and one of the things that really stuck out from me

[25:34] in Andrew's recent interview was he sort of calls the UK pinball community toxic and I and I wanted to get like just your overall opinion about what you thought about the collapse of the company and also I want to talk about the UK pinball community

[25:51] because from what I've been reading it seems anything but toxic so I wanted to talk about why we think he feels that way sure I mean let's let's cover the company first I mean I think I mean it's a story of never end in kind of disappointment I think the the polite way of beating it and and it's it starts with

[26:20] in my view bad really bad and poor management and leadership from the star and I think when you look at what happened and and you know I only really go into the pinball scene just as

[26:35] just as aliens was being announced or alien was being announced and full throttle was was kind of out there and and had various mixed reviews and and for me alien you know that's a mega theme and I'm sitting on my

[26:48] line where I've got a list of alien DVDs I can see in blurry so you know for me it was like oh yeah let's give you a particularly good theme and then I saw the game at

[27:04] the Chicago expo in 2017 would it be 70 though sorry 60 60 he brought it that's right and I have to say it was

[27:15] it was like oh my god it was my first reaction I mean it looked like I had potential but

[27:21] um you know there was just a few things it just weren't quite right on it and it was also from my

[27:27] point of view really clear that the game was still quite some way off before it was shipable despite

[27:34] you know and viewpoints that it was you know imminently about to ship then and and learn but hold you

[27:42] almost over a year later um it ships and and and and so you went from Chicago expo where it was a matter of

[27:51] you know weeks and months to eag and here in London which is the it's kind of like the big UK was not that big

[27:59] but it's it's like the main UK amusement and arcade uh expo here in London and the game was just it

[28:07] was an amest and people turned up it wasn't ready there were soldering boards at night it was just

[28:13] and and you know when you when you look at the game now and I show them I'm part of a club

[28:18] here in the UK flip out London where we have one and actually the game now is that you know it's

[28:24] it's a reasonably decent game but it took two years too long to get out and also um reliability

[28:34] somewhat questionable so for me we look at a whole thing I think there's a lot of great guys at work

[28:39] you know they you know Dennis Norman was working there at some point in time he's a big name in

[28:43] Pimble right there's there's a number of of of people um that were involved in it and you look at

[28:51] the team and you think that should be brilliant and it just wasn't so and I think that a lot of

[28:55] that's done a leadership and and I think um you know we say Pimble's hard um but it's hard if you

[29:03] don't listen to people it's hard if you don't take feedback it's hard if you kind of brush people

[29:07] off it's hard if you do stupid things that aren't really that focused on getting the game out and I

[29:13] think if you look at the history of this project it's there's um apples of evidence that says

[29:19] this was uh badly managed from start to end. Well Neil let's talk about expo 2016 because it's

[29:25] interesting Andrew actually calls out that show as a moment in time when he claims people were openly

[29:33] trying to sabotage his company he actually claims that other manufacturers who were jealous

[29:38] this is kind of his um paraphrasing who were jealous and nervous of the success of alien actually

[29:44] might have stolen parts from their booth at expo um and also around that same time period he's

[29:51] claiming that someone set up um a fraudulent account and send people bills seemingly coming

[29:59] from highway Pimble to to steal people's money and also that rubber ducks our friend Owen was

[30:05] was was emailing owners to get refunds and how much of that do you believe and how much is that

[30:10] just Andrew um coming up with excuses. I I find I find the whole thing of Pimble's

[30:17] Pimble manufacturer is trying to sabotage him just insane I just can't believe that you know I

[30:23] know that the Pimble manufacturer is reasonably well I know JGP guys I know the Stern guys I know

[30:30] CGC guys I've met a few of the guys at multi-morphic I don't know them that well but I've met them

[30:37] to even think that they would have any focus other than their own business and you know

[30:43] where frankly you know you look at all of those manufacturers and they're all pretty decent job

[30:49] wanted to you bumps in the road but they don't need to sabotage them there's just I mean the

[30:56] notion of that just it just feels very um I don't know what's the color but it feels nuts to me

[31:03] and I was there at that event I didn't see anything like that uh I mean I look at Stern they were

[31:09] busy with a 30th party party they had Adam West there the last thing they were worried about

[31:14] was alien let me tell you they were they had bigger things to be worried about right so I think

[31:19] that uh frankly ridiculous um why I think what what was there's the evidence I mean that's the

[31:25] thing where's the evidence right I think what was happening at at in 2016 I think the the

[31:33] real issue that began to surface um that was the point at which some of Andrews employees or

[31:40] ex employees started to to share information and I think that information started to get disseminated

[31:46] out into the pinball world and certain individuals I was one of them what was privy to some of the

[31:51] information that was being shared and I think that's what started to get people concerned that all

[31:58] was not well over at highway pinball that people should be concerned if they had their money invested

[32:04] in the company and you know as I as I told Andrew at expo 2016 because he accused me openly of

[32:10] trying to sabotage his company right to my face I said look Andrew if you ship the games if you

[32:15] ship the games when you promise people are gonna buy him and your company will do fine and he kind

[32:21] of never really wanted to hear stuff like that he just always wanted to find someone to accuse of

[32:27] of being the issue um and look 2016 aliens really never even went out the door right I mean

[32:34] people were still waiting far until 2017 and at that point I think we all witnessed what he was

[32:41] doing where he was sort of just sending out a handful of games that were really kind of prototype

[32:46] beta units the people like Hilton and other people he knew it cheerlead the company but production

[32:53] never really ramped up no that's right and I think when you when you see some of the games that

[33:00] went out you know some of them had various bits that were working on them and they were and

[33:05] you know they definitely were and you know if I'd got one of those games I would have sent it back

[33:09] right away and said this is nowhere near ready um but you're right there's you know there's a few

[33:14] people who were you know you know very positive about this probably more positive than they should have

[33:19] been and in some ways that's a good thing because you're trying to help people out but you've

[33:23] got to be honest about it Chris and and you know I think when when I first saw the game I was

[33:29] thinking wow you know again I've seen with loads of potential but the potential just wasn't

[33:34] being delivered and what was there um you know the room you know I had a couple of rumors when I was

[33:38] a uh expo about you know the state where things were whether they were true or not you know you

[33:45] reflect on you know other issues that were going on the whole predator of fiasco the whole magic

[33:51] girl and and jpop fiasco and you kind of you know when you start to hear about that and you hear

[33:56] another one that's potentially in trouble um you know frankly I wouldn't you know why anyone would

[34:03] pay more than say a thousand bucks deposit for a machine is just beyond me these days but it was

[34:09] clear not all not always well the game was some way off um and you know the message was

[34:16] it was imminent they're about to release and it just wasn't so um you know that that point in time

[34:22] you know as we're asked where I got some um view that this this was not all healthy um and and you

[34:30] know um there was almost a uh a streak of desperation in the whole um situation at that point in time

[34:38] there's a couple of games I think it's supposed to be three but only two turned up they were working

[34:43] in not the various points of the day they weren't they were you know far from complete there was still

[34:48] lots of changes going on there was this horrible can thing on it as I recall um that just didn't

[34:55] play right the other playfield and something I worked with starting to look good it had that

[34:59] terrible cabinet which I still struggled to understand why uh how we went down that road but

[35:06] but that's best best best best left for for another discussion so yeah I think the company was in

[35:12] trouble you know probably before 2016 um and and you know the focus on you know finishing the game

[35:22] getting game ship there are in quality state we're fit for deployment just didn't seem to be

[35:29] happening as far as I could tell it's interesting that now it went and you're keep saying that if

[35:34] you could do something differently he wouldn't have taken pre-orders and he would have waited to

[35:40] announce the second title closer to the ship date but like my question Neil is if he didn't take

[35:46] pre-orders and full throttle was a sales bomb like it didn't do well yeah how does he survive right

[35:54] how does he make any money when you you can't really launch a pinball company with your first title being

[35:59] a flop there's just no way to like survive in that climate unless you have a ton of capital

[36:05] absolutely or unless you you know unless you find a way of outsourcing just about every aspect of it

[36:11] but even then um you know if you want to do that you've got to commit to big volumes for it to be

[36:17] you know a sensible price crest so no and the thing that I take away from any manufacturer not

[36:23] just pinball but any type of manufacturer today you've got to be very well capitalized um and

[36:29] and the reality was that you know how he just wasn't well capitalized and often it was in the

[36:37] the feeling I get from it was kind of collect money spend money collect money spend money I don't

[36:41] know if that's true or not but that's how it comes across that's the perception that I would say

[36:47] and and you know in terms of you know the key thing in manufacturing is managing your supply chain

[36:55] you know Gary Stern talks about it a lot and he shows you his huge stock room and you kind of

[36:59] wonder why the hell is he all that stock well because if he doesn't have that stock he's got people

[37:03] doing nothing when he runs out of stock and you know he's look for the evidence where the supply

[37:09] chain was being managed effectively and you can see many situations where it wasn't you know

[37:14] not realizing that Chinese New Year might have an impact on delivery well everyone in manufacturing

[37:20] knows Chinese New Year unless the whole of China closes down for a week it has a big impact on you

[37:25] so you know again I point to leadership management and and and really experience where you know

[37:32] from the outset looking in you think Craig came the I think the best thing that

[37:37] Andrew could have done was probably bringing someone around the company that knew what they were

[37:40] doing frankly right you know when we when we hear from Dave Sanders sort of what it was like going

[37:44] in where there were just there were weeks upon weeks where they had nothing to do people were

[37:49] just working on side projects you know delays caused a lot of probably confusion about you know

[37:56] what are we doing every day here I think you know Neil the big problem too is and we see this in all

[38:01] of Pimble manufacturing you have to scale up slowly you have to scale your company up slowly

[38:07] and bite off as much as you can chew and I think spooky's done that successfully you know 150 games

[38:13] with game one 300 game two 500 game three and in between they're building total nuclear annihilation

[38:21] you know that's how you build a pinball company I think Andrew came out of the gate with this

[38:26] ambition of be stern level volume right we heard him say four to five hundred games a month

[38:32] without any know how absolutely and I think you know that is that goes back to my point about being

[38:40] well capitalized to build a you know you you've been a Stern's factory to build a facility like

[38:46] that requires a huge amount of capital requires strong management and managing that that whole

[38:52] conveyor belt build process managing the supply chain logistics you know just making sure you've

[38:57] got enough cardboard boxes to stick the machine and to send it off it says like a tiny thing if

[39:02] you can shoot games you can shoot games whatever the reason and and you know scaling to that

[39:08] size from day one just just isn't durable and but but you see as you said your name's spooky I

[39:16] also name CGC who you know started off by using another company to build and learn a lot about

[39:22] I think the supply chain and and got better understand that and brought it in house set up a very

[39:29] you know a small but effective manufacturing capability that could shove out you know a few

[39:37] hundred machines every every two or three months I've got one of those machines it's beautifully made

[39:45] it can be done if you know what you're doing if you learn if you learn step by step if you take

[39:50] feedback and which you know spooky and and CGC definitely take feedback and and and build it into

[39:57] the the products as they move forward and and and but if you if you're not taking feedback if you're

[40:05] not well organized if you don't delegate and I think delegation and and having the team is really

[40:10] important then you're going to end up with bits and pieces not being able to manufacture people

[40:15] sitting around doing nothing and you know and and and to some extent just that you know that whole

[40:21] thing about it's people doing nothing dates back to the Williams days you know you probably

[40:26] seen the the pinball 2000 documentary where one of their biggest fears and Williams was having

[40:31] having the workforce doing nothing and so that's not a new issue and and and you know you hear from

[40:37] the experts back then when there were shoving out you know thousands of games and you know you

[40:43] can I think that's something you need to think about you know how how productive is my workforce

[40:48] and and it doesn't feel like there were very productive as as a whole and it's a shame because

[40:52] there are some good guys very good guys that that were involved in and highway right one of the things

[40:58] that Andrew you know he's sort of he has he's apologizing for some things and I think the one thing

[41:03] he's been the most apologetic about was unrealistic timeframes right and why do you think Neil

[41:11] he ever put such unrealistic timeframes when he's got someone like Dennis Nordman who has been in

[41:17] the industry for decades basically telling him we can't get alien out in eight months it's not even

[41:24] designed yet and not only that he was also alongside those timelines he was giving volume in

[41:31] terms of production quantities that were completely unrealistic why do you think he he did that he

[41:37] sort of put himself in a huge hole but by making those promises early on I mean I struggled to

[41:43] understand why he would put himself under such pressure it's just totally unnecessary you know you

[41:49] can manage the flow of orders by say you know and Spookier a great example of this you know

[41:55] they only take orders where they know that they've got line of sight to building it and they only

[41:59] take a limited amount of deposit you know they don't oversell themselves and they're and and you

[42:04] know Charlie's very very cautious about that you see him posting him Pinside saying you know we're

[42:09] not we're gonna take one step at a time we're not gonna get too big too quickly so that we've got a

[42:13] sustainable business I've struggled to understand why you would do that and other than you know if

[42:19] you think you want to be a sure off and and think well I'm you know I'm and I know everything there's

[42:23] nothing I can learn from anyone and and and you kind of look at it and you think well I wonder if

[42:27] that's what was going on I also think and you know this is purely speculation on my part and

[42:34] not the whole funding with the investors and and managing cash flow and clearly it's was

[42:43] something that was critically important I don't know if I had something to do with that you know

[42:47] those but to me to put yourself under so much pressure when you've got when you don't have to

[42:53] everyone knows pinball's hard everyone knows building one of these machines is difficult why

[42:58] put yourself under even more pressure it just doesn't make any sense you know it's other

[43:03] other than to kind of make yourself out to be some sort of superhero pinball which frankly

[43:09] you know the one thing I've learned since getting into this community is the people who are the

[43:13] people who are the superheroes of pinball the people who deliver not not the people who just

[43:17] say they're gonna deliver right right and well then there was a lot of that right there was a lot of

[43:22] victory laps that were being taken by this company once alien was announced but all it all

[43:28] that was was an announcement and we heard back in the day if you go back and look at the conversation

[43:34] our member orc said something once he said well we had to announce alien to stay relevant as a company

[43:40] and I think it really was like Andrew's desire to feel like he belonged in the club with people

[43:46] like Stern and Jersey Jack because he had that a title that was gonna set the world on fire

[43:51] the only thing you didn't have was 30 years of institutional knowledge on how to actually

[43:56] deliver that game to customers and I think we saw the way that that went over the subsequent years

[44:03] so here we are today Neil and you know we this show has been predicting that highway pimp

[44:07] always gonna collapse for a long time some people believe those got their money out you know do you

[44:12] believe that this podcast actually was one of the reasons highway pimp all failed because we get

[44:19] we're we're part of Andrew's like lawsuit list that he's pursuing legal action again so

[44:25] do you think we're to blame or did we do our job in in reporting to people what we knew about

[44:30] the company I think I think we did our job I mean I am you know the the notion that we

[44:42] or anyone could have an impact on a company it's just tharsicle but I think you know you've

[44:49] got to you've also got to be able to look yourself in the mirror and if you know that

[44:54] people were taking money where there was a risk and I think it's right and proper

[45:00] to say that's that's a bit risky and I certainly did it I think I think others did

[45:06] I think putting your money into an unproven company and there's a lot of money it's not like it's

[45:11] you know a few hundred bucks for a you know a set of headphones it's you know six seven thousand

[45:18] dollars for a pinball machine that's a lot of money for people and and I'm you know if I

[45:24] think there's something slightly suspicious about I'm gonna send and you sure you're gonna get

[45:28] that money back because you know it feels like a long way off and and there's still people waiting

[45:33] you know there's a couple of guys from Sweden posting that they'd paid up in full and didn't get a

[45:40] game and they'd been waiting over two years so I think it's right to say be cautious with your money

[45:47] use your credit card don't put down a small deposit not don't pay for the whole game till you know

[45:52] it's ready to ship and you do that within it's in cash you don't walk into a card dealer and lay

[45:58] 50 grand down on a card until you've seen it right so and this was interesting else so pinball guys

[46:03] for the most part if you're buying expensive pinball machines you I would assume that you're

[46:08] somewhat financially stable and successful in life you have some intelligence inside your head

[46:15] it is interesting looking back on all those videos Andrew used to post about the production of

[46:22] alien when we we look at them now right empty factory nobody in it nothing being made like one

[46:29] guy with a long screwdriver wearing like a winter hat and it just looks so comical versus a real

[46:36] pinball companies production why do you think people allowed him to continue seeing those things

[46:44] in hindsight why wasn't there more people concerned and and and sort of you know raising red flags

[46:51] that this doesn't look right you know human nature Chris people don't like to be wrong they don't

[46:57] like to admit that they're wrong but I think you know we're all grown-ups you you know when you see

[47:04] something like that and to to claim that everything's okay you know just looking at it and I was

[47:12] watching one of those videos a couple of nights ago and I had to completely agree with you it just

[47:16] looked ridiculous that there was any hope that this was going to be successful based on those videos

[47:22] and I hope you know there's probably some I know some people in the UK who were who were friends

[47:28] of Andrews and prior to to highway when you know because he was in the pinball scene here for a while

[47:34] you know I think they were all giving him feedback privately as the sense I get again no evidence

[47:39] for that but I'm I'm pretty sure you know some of the people who who had who had orders in for

[47:44] machines as well were saying hey Andrew why don't you focus on this why don't you focus on that

[47:50] I'm sure that was going on but you got to listen to it Chris and I think there's there's

[47:55] you know post after post anecdote after anecdote where it was clear you know from highway employees

[48:03] from people outside from Dennis Norman you know from a lot of people who were given advice it just

[48:11] wasn't being listened to and and and and then there are people who were just you know frankly

[48:17] blowing smoke Chris and where they were saying everyone's alright the game's coming is going to

[48:22] be fine the game's going to roll and there's just no evidence to back them up and and and I think

[48:28] and you know I think some of the some of the community needs to think about that you know and there's

[48:34] a bit on some of the big forums where they're saying well you know we need to be cautious on how

[48:39] we moderate I think if people have a point of view where you know things don't look right they

[48:44] need to be able to express that and I don't think that was as evident as it should have been so I'm

[48:50] hoping that those people you know see this learn from it so that the next time someone comes along

[48:57] they are they're more balanced because I fear that there was not as much balance as there should

[49:03] have been and and quite often anyone who was negative was was kind of blew it out and and that

[49:09] that is in my mind kind of unacceptable really yeah I mean I I tried to share as much as I could with

[49:16] the pinside with I actually gave Robin and the moderators all the information I had they they knew

[49:22] that I had it they knew I had verification of of where it came from you know it led me to having

[49:29] to post some stuff anonymously on there because I was banned under my canada handle it's a shame you

[49:35] know I think everyone has learned from this and so Neil here we are today at the company is now

[49:40] in this weird place too because there's a lot of finger pointing between Andrew and the investor

[49:45] group and there's some people speculating now that it seems as if the investor group was planning

[49:50] to do this all along do you believe that their plan from the very beginning was to set a pinball

[49:55] brothers liquidate highway absolve themselves from the debt that Andrew put them in and then just

[50:01] start a new or do you think they gave it a real go over the last year and they just realized that

[50:07] Andy kind of sold them a sinking ship and there was nothing they could do you know it's really

[50:13] hard to I've been trying to figure that out there's part of me that you know I see what the

[50:21] the new the new owners or investors or the old investors renewed if you will post Andrew going

[50:29] you know it felt like they really had the right in ten at least to start off with you know they

[50:35] were they kept you know they did all the things right they got their they put a message out saying

[50:40] we're going to try and fix this give us some time they got their head down they started focusing on

[50:45] that they probably didn't communicate enough and and given up updates which you know it's a you

[50:54] can assume the pendulum to a whole lot of updates that were valueless to a few updates that show

[50:58] progress I think that spooked people's confidence you know you see the people demanding refunds

[51:05] and that that you know I look at that and think that was a you know a shared load of money there's a

[51:09] lot of money refunded there's also a lot of people who didn't get refunds there was like yeah they

[51:13] didn't tell you that like over almost fifty thousand dollars of people who who still have yet to be

[51:19] refunded and we know that's just the tip of the iceberg to Neil right that's just like people on

[51:23] inside yeah absolutely I think the so I believe they had great intentions to start with but then I

[51:32] think that they were in such a poor state and then and then and then the big you know the thing

[51:40] that kind of was the final nail in the coffin in my mind yeah they started to get games out they

[51:46] got the early done not quite as good as we all hoped it might be but it was it's you know it wasn't

[51:53] a complete disaster but the biggest issue that they didn't face into was reliability and managing

[51:59] their existing customer base you know there's stories of aliens that are down and being down

[52:04] for months because they people can get spare parts and distributors hate that they don't want to

[52:11] have people send the machines back that they and haven't to refund because they can get parts of

[52:17] the game isn't working and and I find that that part of this whole story just astonishing because

[52:23] it felt like you know the fairly the corner was being turned slowly but surely and then you

[52:31] know you started to hear about machines going down not being able to get parts and and the community

[52:36] actually fabricated in 3d printed parts to help each other out which is fantastic but but frankly for

[52:43] a you know eight thousand dollar pinball machine after you've had it a few months frankly ridiculous

[52:48] so there's still there is still no manual yeah for the game yeah I mean just

[52:55] unbelievable right absolutely so I am we have one in in our club as I mentioned

[53:02] and I was actually going to stream it and as I went to stream it and the flipper stopped working

[53:08] one of the fuses blue and just trying to figure out you know which fuse might be and what's

[53:13] got wrong and how to debug it was really really difficult and we got it back up and running but

[53:19] we still don't know what the problem was it just fixed itself which is which is quite scary but

[53:25] it's really hard to service and maintain this there's a lot of boards and there's you know

[53:30] they're all proprietary highway boards and one of them blows I don't know what you do it fix it

[53:35] you know hopefully the community can help but there but it looks looks very difficult to service

[53:40] some machine you know there's there's some software coming out here but who knows what happened

[53:45] with any other update so you probably got what you've got but you know you get to the point where

[53:52] they're not they're not supporting existing users and then and they you know the refund started

[53:57] to slow down you think maybe they you know who knows what's going on but it doesn't look good to

[54:01] look in fact starting to look worse because there is no communication either and then you hear the

[54:08] whole you know there's a story about coin ticker I don't know if it's true or false but you know

[54:13] a container of games that you know who knows if they were real or not but then I've got a friend

[54:20] Ian you're in the UK he he put a deposit on an LED down you know I think years ago

[54:26] guess a full goal saying you know machine ready to ship pay the rest and it'll ship so he

[54:31] this was literally two or three weeks ago he paid the balance and the game turned up the next day

[54:36] and so it's it's a very bizarre situation Chris I don't know how to how to position it but

[54:43] it's clear that what these I think is clear what they should have done what they should have done

[54:48] was acquire the assets and and if they if they really wanted to to save the company I believe

[54:55] and this this wouldn't have just you know there's a risk in doing this because you probably piss a

[54:59] lot people off but to some extent they needed to absolve themselves of the liabilities that they

[55:07] got with the company they tried to to to handle that in a professional way which I think is good

[55:14] but ultimately they just weren't able to do it and I wonder if it'd be different if they just

[55:18] acquire the assets liquidate the company a year ago and moved on from there and I you know

[55:24] that would be a bad taste and a lot of people's mouths but at the end of the day they're in the same

[55:30] place they've liquidated they've shipped a game people have paid more money into it and the future

[55:37] for that game and the support for that game is very uncertain and as I understand it there will

[55:42] be no more aliens because the license has expired so it's you know it's a very it's a very bizarre

[55:49] situation I think you know the pinball brothers as they become known you know as they move forward

[55:57] I think they need to step back and really think about what they've learned from this whole

[56:02] sorry tale and see how they might do things differently I think for them

[56:07] well whilst Andrew Hyve overcommunicated and over promised these guys undercommunicated and under

[56:14] promised I think they need to find somewhere in the middle where you can you can share what's going on

[56:19] you can make some commitments that don't stretch you too far but are are reasonable and then

[56:25] and then get moving but I fear that anything to do with this this whole highway thing might be

[56:31] tend to be on repair that's my fear yeah I kind of agree I look at it like do we really need

[56:38] another pinball manufacturer like just if you just ask that question because there are plenty of

[56:44] amazing pinball machines coming out from reliable manufacturers that warranty the games that

[56:49] have manuals that are you know there's a customer service person that picks up when you have an

[56:54] issue I just think that these pinball brother guys you know people are not going to forget what

[57:01] happened at highway it's going to follow them to their new operation queen pinball that they're

[57:07] probably going to make which is very old designed and then or I think also Dave centers helped out

[57:13] I just don't see this game finding open arms from the community and I think they're if they

[57:20] if I agree with you though they the only way for them to salvage all of this is to come out be

[57:26] transparent and tell us their side of the story and they're still refusing to come and I saw that

[57:31] this week in pinball tried to reach out to all of them and I don't think they're going to be able to

[57:35] do this from the shadows anymore no well I think I mean I mean they could try they could try

[57:42] and you know goal stealth build a machine and then get it out there and get lots of them you know

[57:48] turn up it x-bone 2019 was 20 games for people to play you know that that's the they need to kind

[57:56] of they need to kind of either be really transparent and come forward as you say and and tell you

[58:02] know the side of the story what they try to do be open opening up front about it if they don't do

[58:09] that I think it's very hard for them unless they go kind of big time which which you know as you know

[58:14] Chris to do that they're going to need a big factory they're going to need a lot of cash they're going

[58:19] to need a really top quality game and I have to say queen is a theme you know queen's very big here

[58:26] in Europe and the UK I'm not so sure it's such a big theme in the ux and and and and certainly

[58:33] you know back in the day queen was not that great a band over in the US they had fans but they were

[58:38] you know the sort iron maiden or aerosmiths sort of size and so that that brings a set of challenges

[58:46] with it and you know of course I believe if a game's good the theme is is kind of secondary sometimes

[58:52] but not all the time and so they'd have to come out big it feels unlikely they're going to do that

[58:58] so I think you know them coming out and positioning where what happens from their point of view

[59:02] I think would be helpful right but but I think you know if I was them I kind of think actually

[59:10] why don't we go build something else it feels very hard for them it never ceases to amaze me how

[59:18] pride will destroy a millionaires you know balance in their in their savings account when it comes

[59:27] to pinball I mean this is all pride driven these guys aren't in the pinball industry they're they're

[59:32] wealthy individuals from other industries that are simply trying to throw money and become a

[59:38] pinball company and I just don't ever think that's the way it works I mean spooky pinball he's

[59:43] 100% dedicated the people that's during our 100% dedicated these individuals this isn't their

[59:49] business they wanted to be but I just don't ever see it happening because there's not the same level

[59:55] of focus so Neil what was it like when you saw that Andrew highway was starting to just blame the

[01:00:01] UK pinball community and calling them a top-of-the-convirement because from what I've been reading it seemed

[01:00:07] like he had a lot of support that support started to erode as the years went on and you know deadlines

[01:00:13] were missed and whatnot but how do you feel as a member of the UK pinball community to hear something

[01:00:19] like that it's pretty shocking really I mean Andrew had a lot of support from the UK community

[01:00:28] you know people hosted events for him that were part of the community when he announced highway

[01:00:33] the people ordered the games you know they supported him in some events a lot of them defended

[01:00:43] Andrew when he was challenged you know that he was an honest and upfront guy and the UK I mean

[01:00:51] so I kind of think the whole thing to kind of come out of that is just staggering in my view

[01:00:57] it's and frankly it's a load of rubbish you know I've been part of this community for a little

[01:01:03] over two years now two and a half years and the the UK community is a fantastic community we

[01:01:09] get together we help each other out in fact out of friend round on Friday and last week came

[01:01:16] round to adjust something on the machine that I couldn't get right he'd done it before said yeah

[01:01:20] no problem come round couple a couple of coffee picks the machine you know I say listen you know

[01:01:25] I'll give you some money or something for your time no no no no no no way I want to help

[01:01:30] the pinball info forum is the main kind of place for the Q&A we have a couple of events a year

[01:01:38] NLP which is a huge one where you know 50 to 100 of us bring our games to this we we have a

[01:01:46] in that community we have a special evening event where we have pizza beer and pinball it's a

[01:01:52] fantastic group of people most I mean here in the UK Chris as you know there are not many places

[01:01:58] to play pinball except in people's private homes so for most of the tournaments most of the events

[01:02:04] are held in people's homes and Chris you don't invite people around to your home that you don't

[01:02:09] like right you don't invite toxic people to your house so you know I'm part of a couple of those

[01:02:14] leagues and you know a few weeks ago I was one of one of my friends houses Paul who runs a Pavlov

[01:02:23] pinball you might know him and he opened up his house for 50 people we played pinball he gave us food

[01:02:31] you know the friendliness of it yeah there's some rivalry in terms of games and and playing the game

[01:02:37] and collecting things of course there is that's human nature but it's a phenomenal community and

[01:02:43] actually I'm you know I'm hosting one round at a league in in July where there'd be 45 people

[01:02:48] around at my house and and the community is anything but toxic and I'll add another thing so I

[01:02:55] mentioned we've opened Flippa London which is a pinball club in the south of London it's the community

[01:03:00] that's opened that so 10 of us got together we've bumped chucked some cash into to our bank account

[01:03:06] we rented a place we put our machines there we open it up for the community you can come around you

[01:03:12] can become a member you can come around play our games we're open Sunday sorry sorry Sunday

[01:03:18] and Thursdays every every week and it's all run by the members we're all indexed community we're all

[01:03:24] great friends and and for him to come out and say that the community was toxic it just stands up

[01:03:32] to no scrutiny whatsoever it's it's it's immediately ridiculous right and I've been reading stories

[01:03:38] of people lending him games for different shows he had the UK pinball party he he also has failed

[01:03:44] to return someone's games someone lent him seven games that he never got back or Andrew was

[01:03:50] supposed to sell them and give him money towards highway machines so there's just I think you know

[01:03:57] it doesn't hold up to any investigation that the community is the problem right and I think

[01:04:01] people are starting to realize as more and more highway employees come forward it's like Andrew

[01:04:07] against everyone else and everyone else is sort of saying the same thing and and he's sort of

[01:04:12] deflecting and you know he's always been about surviving and saying what needs to be said to try

[01:04:18] to buy himself some more leeway but I think it's over Neil I think the highway pinball story is

[01:04:25] coming to an end I think the pinball brothers venture will probably end in a similar fashion

[01:04:32] I don't think anyone's going to pre-order any games with those guys I so we'll see what we're

[01:04:37] that goes what do you think Neil deep root and Dutch pinball like we're in a climate now where

[01:04:45] these other companies that are trying to break into the hobby you know failures like highway make

[01:04:51] it even more difficult people's scrutiny right their expectations and they're the lessons learned

[01:04:59] have made everyone a more cautious buyer do you see Dutch turning the corner do you see deep

[01:05:05] roots exceeding in this climate and I think they're very different organizations so so Dutch you know

[01:05:12] and I feel very hard for them to come back from where they are however you know it does look like

[01:05:19] they are trying their hardest to do it in a very difficult and frustrating situation would I give

[01:05:26] them any money no I think anyone given them money without having the machine already loaded in

[01:05:31] the car frankly it's crazy and if I had money invested invested in this which many folk do

[01:05:39] I think at this point I would be trying to figure out how I get that back and you know I hope

[01:05:47] that they turn around it just feels it feels impossible no it could be if I was them what I would try to

[01:05:57] is try and close out the big Lebowski by finishing off whatever they can do get the games to

[01:06:05] whoever's paid for them as best as they can then basically just stop because it's clear that

[01:06:12] they are not financed capitalized or even have the capability to be serious in this in this game

[01:06:19] and I think they're I think the only again goes back to your point I know the only time anyone's

[01:06:25] going to buy a game is if they can they're holding onto it and handing the money over no one's

[01:06:30] going to preorder a game no one's going to send any money until they've got the game in their hands

[01:06:34] right so that and they're a cash flow business where the money they get in is immediately paid

[01:06:39] to supplier so it feels really difficult you know but I have to admire them for at least trying

[01:06:47] to try and sort of this out as opposed to throwing in the towel which which a lot of people lose

[01:06:53] it still feels to me though a year from now if they've satisfied all the outstanding debts and all

[01:06:59] the outstanding people waiting on machines and they've got a machine you know and rolling I've

[01:07:05] say I'll be amazed if they pull that off it'll be turned around to the decade and it just feels

[01:07:10] very unlikely so my advice and wait until you've got a machine in your hand before giving any

[01:07:16] money that would be my advice deep root and I mean I've been following them you know quietly I

[01:07:22] think deep root of you know there's brought a lot of personalities a lot of big names they seem

[01:07:28] to have money you know although you know well that you know having money and wanting to spend the

[01:07:34] money are two always two different things but the you know they have they have a very kind of

[01:07:41] um bullish attitude and they might want to reflect on highway and think about what the best way

[01:07:47] of communicating with their future customers is I would suggest and but it feels like they may

[01:07:54] you know they may have the the resources to make something happen um but you know what's going to

[01:08:02] happen to them and they've got a game same thing's going to apply I wouldn't hand them over a penny

[01:08:07] until I've got a game that I can touch or see and then I'm very given them the money I'm

[01:08:12] unfortunately they're going to they're going to suffer because of highway because of all these other

[01:08:18] bad situations that have happened um you know having stock and having a number of games to sell

[01:08:25] and having a distribution channel with you know that's that's trusty it's going to be vital for them

[01:08:31] but the best thing they can do is get their head down focus on building great games they've got

[01:08:36] you know a big set of talented people working for them get the games done then when they've

[01:08:42] got something to show and it's and it's definitely suitable then show it and come out with something

[01:08:47] that's real not a video of a factory not a video of some artwork not a video of a license but a real

[01:08:54] game that flips there's got software there's got parts there's got support there's got a manual

[01:09:00] that's what they need to focus on and but you know it's it's very you know it's a company it's very

[01:09:07] you know it's very uncertain about what their intent is and and you know so you know get the game

[01:09:14] made and then and then blow the trumpets would be my advice right yeah I mean they're another one

[01:09:20] where the pressure they've put on themselves to deliver with their five days of deep rude I think

[01:09:25] even Robert put into the contract with the zidware people was that they had to ship the games I

[01:09:32] think it's like June of 2019 or or or like they default on on owning up to their under the bargain

[01:09:41] so it's going to be an interesting year you know I look at deep rude I've said it before with

[01:09:44] just curiosity I'm curious to see what this becomes you know J-pop is J-pop I wouldn't want to

[01:09:51] work with a guy like that I've spoken to John on the phone numerous times and he is a creative

[01:09:58] kind of lunatic in a way that needs to be wrangled in and hopefully they can accomplish that I don't

[01:10:04] think they're going to take any pre-order money which is good because they don't need it I think

[01:10:08] you know Robert has he has written some very big verbal checks and we'll see if he can cash

[01:10:14] them next year so it's going to be it's going to be interesting the thing is this Niels I look at

[01:10:19] the whole hobby and then you follow it and you're on the forums there's just so much good stuff

[01:10:24] coming out from from Stern from Jersey Jack from Chicago gaming from spooky you know I just think like

[01:10:31] the drama and the the negativity that surrounds some of these companies like home pins a good

[01:10:36] example of that I mean I don't think you could be any worse of a of a leader than the way Mike

[01:10:41] talks to people it's like what are you what are you doing man you're trying to sell games it's a toy

[01:10:47] and you're in the forums battling people acting like you don't give a shit like

[01:10:52] these businesses will have it hard enough to survive with the amount of competition and Stern is

[01:10:59] I'm telling you this when you know what Stern has coming out over the next two years

[01:11:03] everyone is in jeopardy of going under other than Stern yeah I mean I mean you just have to look

[01:11:09] at Iron Maiden I remember seeing the video of the factory with as far as the eye could see

[01:11:17] Iron Maiden's being made you know they've they've hired big names they've hired they've brought

[01:11:24] in a lot of extra people in the design front they've got the as I think it was Steve Richard it said

[01:11:29] they're up to the sort of design capability that Williams had in the heyday so they are investing big

[01:11:36] Iron Maiden's a smash hit I haven't played it yet but I've got an early on order

[01:11:43] I'm not a big Iron Maiden fan in fact I hate the music of a monies with you but the game looks

[01:11:46] fantastic Keith L ones done a great job and a lot of people that are unknowns with the right

[01:11:52] stewardship of Gomez and Gary Stern you know helping them through becoming a capable organization

[01:12:00] and a capable set of people it's fantastic to watch and yeah you think in Stern you know they're

[01:12:07] starting to listen to things you know having the service arms on the Iron Maiden pros them listening

[01:12:14] they kind of did something stupid but they realized that they've changed back it's hopefully

[01:12:19] we see more of that but the games they're building are just fantastic it's in its hard

[01:12:26] to see how anyone really challenges them for the number one spot then you know

[01:12:30] Jersey Jack I mean bit of a shame with the whole pirates circle and spinning disc thing

[01:12:37] because that was quite a cool thing that's what caught my eye you know I still think there's a good

[01:12:42] game in what they're developing and I think the team behind it are I think they're devastated

[01:12:48] they couldn't make it work for whatever reason and and you know I hope that that pirates is a success

[01:12:56] diled in as huge here in the UK it's one of the biggest games we've seen over here people love it

[01:13:01] spooky I mean you know the TNA is just a gift that keeps on giving for them

[01:13:06] they can't make enough of them and so it's kind of a nice problem to have and then Alice Cooper

[01:13:11] I played at a TPS you know it's a fun game it's and I love the kind of dungeon you know wonder

[01:13:18] around dungeons and in castles I think it's got a lot of potential in it and again they're hiring

[01:13:23] some some key people to help them in key areas and then CGC I mean you know we were both frustrated

[01:13:30] Chris that he didn't bring their game to Texas right that's why I went I was there it's a big

[01:13:34] it's a big journey for me to go from London to Texas and it was a little bit disappointing but

[01:13:39] you know I spoke to Doug and he was like you know they want it to be ready and I couldn't get that

[01:13:44] I still think they could have launched the game with even though it wasn't quite finished again

[01:13:49] depends on what wasn't finished but if it was just a software thing then surely they could have

[01:13:54] done something nevertheless they didn't I kind of in some way I was a bit annoyed by that but on

[01:14:00] reflection I think it's if it's not ready it's the right thing to do and you know they've they're

[01:14:06] developing things for for medieval madness they've got this white screen that's in test which

[01:14:10] I'm going to buy right away just because it looks phenomenal on a type of from Mars so game 3 for

[01:14:16] them I think it's going to be really important I think it's I think for a couple reasons one

[01:14:21] can you really take what the step that they take with a type of from Mars and take that step again

[01:14:26] I think they can to I think it's a big test for them and how big the remake market's going to really be

[01:14:33] and because they've done kind of two of the most demand most rare demand games as they as they do

[01:14:39] more games there's there's less demand for them perhaps and they've got competition but you know

[01:14:45] Doug and the guys there I love them I speak to them a lot Doug was over here at the UK and I

[01:14:52] had a great chat with them most they're giving them a tour of London and they're passionate about

[01:14:56] what they do and I wish them huge success and yeah you look at everything that's going on the

[01:15:03] number of manufacturers how big is the market and then yeah when you see companies that aren't as

[01:15:12] customer friendly as these should be you kind of think what are you doing and there's a few people

[01:15:18] you know I mean Thunderbirds is a big British thing and so many here in the UK is Gary Anderson

[01:15:25] and Sylvia Anderson is massive here but I've got a huge Thunderbird 2 model in my eyes as you

[01:15:30] might have might know and it's a game that you know I would love to have a look at but you know I

[01:15:37] see how you post and I mean I'm going to interview them actually in August they're coming over to

[01:15:44] we've got a UK pinfest here it's a big pinball festival in the UK the first one we've run a while

[01:15:49] I'm going to go to interview the home pin guys and see the game hopefully but you know this is my

[01:15:55] this is my thing nobody has anything to prove you want to prove something get the game out there

[01:16:00] and let people review the game and say the game is brilliant and that's that you know if I was

[01:16:04] in this business that would be what would get me high is that people love the game is that the

[01:16:09] factory can't make enough of them and you look at Iron Maiden you look at Total Nucleon

[01:16:14] Isolation people can get enough of that game that that that is you say it in what you do not in

[01:16:20] the works right elose hammer in the Formula One driver he says do you're talking on the track

[01:16:25] pinball manufacturers do you're talking in the games that you make you don't need to do anything

[01:16:29] else you just need to make games and people will buy them I I couldn't agree more you know I'm

[01:16:35] always telling my friends who don't follow this hobby at all all you got to do is put a box of

[01:16:41] blinking lights in a cardboard box and there will be people that will buy it immediately because

[01:16:47] pinball is a drug for so many people out there and it's the only way to satiate the desires is to

[01:16:54] get a new machine like every few months for a lot of people so you know I really appreciate you

[01:16:59] taking the time when's the next time you're going to be over in the states sure listen I'm I don't

[01:17:07] think I'm over till pinburg but I might be there might be a couple of other things I'm over there

[01:17:13] for and we'd like to shout UK pinfest though it's we really haven't had a big event in the UK for

[01:17:21] a while and and we've got one on 25th 26th of august here in the UK and central central part UK

[01:17:29] near Birmingham it's the only dedicated pinball event we've got about over a hundred machines

[01:17:36] hopefully close to 150 a couple of the big suppliers are there pinball heaven and until I'm sponsoring

[01:17:45] it I'm going to be there I'm doing a few of the the events and and supporting with taking some

[01:17:50] games up most of that all the games are being brought by the toxic community and not so it's

[01:17:57] going to be a great event and and check out UK pinfest.com if you want to come to anyone who's in

[01:18:04] from the US or anywhere in the world if you're in the UK and you want to play pinball that's where
