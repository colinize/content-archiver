[00:00] What becomes of the broken hearted?

[00:04] Oh, I love that's not before it.

[00:08] I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.

[00:13] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say.

[00:18] Welcome everybody to Canade's Pinball Podcast.

[00:21] It is 4.50 in the morning, Monday morning.

[00:23] I've been sleeping on the couch for two nights,

[00:26] so Killian can get a better night's sleep.

[00:28] For some reason, when I roll around, I wake them up.

[00:30] So don't ever say, I'm not dedicated to this pinball podcast.

[00:34] I took a new bird of work so I can make this show for you,

[00:37] because I couldn't sleep, and I just wanted to get my thoughts about Toy Story Pinball.

[00:41] I played it this weekend for over an hour at Jack Bar.

[00:44] Put about 15 games on it, I would say.

[00:48] And I want to share with you why I feel personally deep down in my pinball soul devastation.

[00:55] And I'm going to explain to you why this game devastates me.

[00:58] Now it's not all bad. I'm going to tell you the things I liked about the game.

[01:01] I'm going to tell you the things that I wasn't really sure about.

[01:04] But I'm going to overall sort of summarize my feelings on this game

[01:08] as being a devastating game for someone like me that loves Toy Story.

[01:13] And I'm going to explain why in a very even-kill way.

[01:20] But the whole movie is this story about that.

[01:23] It's not a movie about a carnival.

[01:26] That's a very small part of Toy Story 4.

[01:30] And to base this entire game's story,

[01:32] and most of the stuff you're doing in this game is based around the carnival,

[01:36] it's such a bad interpretation of the film itself.

[01:41] And I just don't think Jersey Jack Pinball really understands storytelling.

[01:47] And the story was right there.

[01:48] There's no better storytellers on planet Earth than Pixar.

[01:52] And so how do you take a Pixar story and you boil it down?

[01:56] You distill it down to being all about the carnival.

[01:59] This is like if you made Lord of the Rings,

[02:02] and instead of making the movies we got,

[02:04] you made Lord of the Rings about Bilbo's birthday party.

[02:08] And the whole wizard mode is to get to Gandalf's fireworks display.

[02:12] Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[02:14] All you're going to have to sign up for the Canadian Club

[02:16] to hear the conclusion for the world's worst pinball podcast.

[02:19] Just vote it, favorite five years in a row.

[02:21] Be good, everybody.

[02:22] I'll be the thing every time I know I'm only following.

[02:27] Nothing gonna stop me now.

[02:30] Out of battle.
