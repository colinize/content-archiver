[00:00] We shall fight in the hills, we shall never surrender.

[00:22] Good evening.

[00:23] Welcome to Canadian's Pimbal Podcast Episode 148.

[00:28] On this episode, I want to tell you a story.

[00:31] I want to share a story with you that I've been waiting so many months to share with you.

[00:37] And I wasn't able to until the timing was right.

[00:41] Because this story can't be told through speculation.

[00:46] It can't be told through forum gossip.

[00:49] To truly tell this story in the way it's supposed to be told.

[00:54] You have to talk to the individuals that lived through it, that experienced it.

[01:00] And it just so happens that one day, many months ago,

[01:05] I got a Facebook message request from an individual wondering

[01:12] if I knew anything about what was going on at Highway Pimbal.

[01:18] It turns out this individual was Brian Allen.

[01:23] And Brian Allen had just contributed amazing artwork to the Alien Pimbal machine.

[01:32] His artwork was being celebrated on Alien Day as the limited edition back glass

[01:39] to this highly anticipated and long awaited, Ellie version of the game.

[01:46] And he said to me, you know, I just have some concerns about Highway Pimbal.

[01:52] I was wondering if you knew anything.

[01:54] And this was our first encounter.

[01:56] He had come to me to see if I had known anything about Highway Pimbal.

[02:01] And this is after I'd been covering this company for almost two years,

[02:05] all the different hurdles and struggles they'd been going through.

[02:09] So what you're going to hear tonight on Canadian Pimbal podcast is a piece of Pimbal history.

[02:16] It is the story, the true story of what went on behind the scenes

[02:21] when Highway Pimbal created the Alien Ellie artwork.

[02:28] And for those of you out there who are still holding on to your belief

[02:33] that Andrew didn't do anything disingenuous, that he'd meant well.

[02:40] I want you all to understand one simple thing.

[02:45] That everybody was lied to on a certain level.

[02:48] When you were told back way back in October, November of 2016

[02:54] that the Ellie artwork was submitted and they were just waiting for Fox approval

[03:00] and a hundred Ellie's were going to ship in December or January.

[03:04] That never happened.

[03:06] Okay, you're going to hear that.

[03:08] I really want you to pay attention to when Brian Allen was actually commissioned

[03:14] to make the Ellie artwork for Alien Pimbal.

[03:19] I think it will shock you.

[03:21] We also heard from the very beginning that hand drawn artwork

[03:26] was not allowed to happen on an Alien Pimbal machine.

[03:31] And then lo and behold, on Alien Day,

[03:34] we see this incredible artwork done by Brian Allen

[03:39] and all of a sudden we realize just how good

[03:43] an Alien machine could be with the proper hand drawn artwork.

[03:48] And everyone's a victim in this story.

[03:51] There are no clear winners here.

[03:54] Andrew Highway is a victim of his own ambition

[03:59] or it's Lawson becomes a victim of Andrew going around his back

[04:04] and hiring an artist to do another version of the Ellie back glass.

[04:11] Brian Allen is a victim and he's not paid for his work when he said

[04:15] he was it would be paid.

[04:17] Everyone sort of loses in this story on some level.

[04:21] But, but in some strange twist of fate,

[04:25] it seems that all these incredible artists sometimes

[04:29] are discovered during Pimbal calamities.

[04:34] We cannot forget how Zambiyeti and Matt Andrews

[04:39] got their beginnings in Pimbal with Zidware

[04:42] and what that disaster was.

[04:45] And yet look at them both now.

[04:47] Zambiyeti working at Stern.

[04:50] He's on game number two now.

[04:52] Ghostbusters is one of the greatest art packages of all time.

[04:56] Matt Andrews is working with spooky,

[04:58] just reveal total nuclear annihilation with them.

[05:02] So there is, there is hope

[05:04] that when these great artists work for projects

[05:07] that don't get off the ground,

[05:09] that they will find a home

[05:12] and they will find another project

[05:13] in which their art can live on a machine.

[05:16] And for those of you who think art is not important,

[05:20] here's my take on why art is so important.

[05:25] When you look at two of the greatest science fiction franchises

[05:30] of all time, Star Wars and Alien,

[05:34] two franchises that have spawned

[05:37] some of the greatest art out there

[05:41] in the world of science fiction.

[05:43] Just go on DeviantArt and look for Star Wars

[05:46] and look for Alien, look for Geeger stuff.

[05:49] Unbelieveable artwork, both franchises have inspired.

[05:54] And then you go look at both of these Pimbal machines,

[05:58] both Star Wars and Alien.

[06:01] And it's just really sad.

[06:02] And I think all of you out there feel the same way

[06:05] that these are not the artistic representations

[06:10] that we wanted for both of these franchises,

[06:14] not even close.

[06:17] And I don't want to support Pimbal anymore

[06:21] that doesn't artistically bring

[06:24] these incredible worlds to life.

[06:27] And people like Brian Allen, Zambietti, Dirty Donny,

[06:32] Christopher Franchi, Matt Andrews, these individuals,

[06:37] these individuals are as important as names like George Gomez,

[06:43] Steve Richie, Pat Lawler, John Borg, Lyman Sheets.

[06:50] They all are super important.

[06:53] They all have a pivotal role to play

[06:56] in creating a Pimbal machine that is magical,

[07:00] that is worth collecting.

[07:02] And the art and the design need to both be stellar,

[07:07] especially for what games are costing right now.

[07:10] And I know you all feel this way.

[07:13] I can feel it.

[07:14] I can feel the hobby has woken up

[07:17] that your expectations for what you want these themes to look like

[07:23] is deservedly high, deservedly high.

[07:27] We no longer should look at a Pimbal machine and say,

[07:31] well, it looks good enough.

[07:33] I really like the way it flows.

[07:35] That's a bunch of BS.

[07:37] The game should look as amazing as the game flows.

[07:41] Okay, so let me air this interview with Brian Allen.

[07:46] I appreciate him coming on.

[07:49] And I want you to hear him talk about what he went through

[07:53] during that period where Andrew Highway was trying to convince everybody

[07:59] that the alien Ellie was just around the corner

[08:03] and they were just about to ship.

[08:05] And his story is phenomenal.

[08:08] He's an incredible person at a great time chatting with him.

[08:12] And I look forward to having him back on the show

[08:15] to talk about artwork and Pimbal.

[08:18] And I hope the other manufacturers out there.

[08:21] Those of you that need MVP new artists,

[08:24] I really hope that Brian Allen's artwork finds its way onto machines

[08:29] in the future because it's just that good.

[08:32] It just is.

[08:33] So without further ado, I give you the true story of Alien Ellie artwork.

[08:40] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian Pimbal podcast.

[08:44] A very special guest.

[08:45] I've had the honor of talking to the best artist in the Pimbal

[08:50] industry, everyone from Zambia to Dirty Donny to Christopher Fransche.

[08:55] And I want to add the latest and greatest artist in the world of Pimbal.

[09:00] Mr. Brian Allen.

[09:02] Brian, welcome to the show.

[09:04] Hey, I think it's a lot of Chris.

[09:05] It's a really nice and flattering introduction.

[09:09] A lot more than I deserve, but I appreciate it.

[09:11] I don't know.

[09:12] I think you know, for those of you out there who haven't seen Brian's work

[09:16] in the world of Pimbal,

[09:19] Brian has worked on Alien Pimbal's limited edition artwork.

[09:24] And we've seen the back glass for that game that Brian worked on,

[09:30] which I think universally people just love.

[09:33] So we, but what we want to do on this episode of Canadian Pimbal podcast,

[09:37] if we want to tell the story and we want to listen to Brian's take on the story

[09:41] because he lived it on Alien Ellie.

[09:44] And what it was like to sort of work on that art because

[09:48] we've covered Alien extensively on this podcast, Brian.

[09:52] And what I was excited about when we started connecting was I would cover Alien

[09:58] from a distance and you were working on it with Andrew Highway.

[10:01] And I think we all know where the story is today.

[10:04] But we want to rewind and go back to a few months ago to talk about what it was like

[10:09] actually working on the Alien project.

[10:12] Is that cool, Brian?

[10:13] Yeah, sure.

[10:14] Take the lead.

[10:15] All right, cool.

[10:16] For the listener of the show, because this is a little bit of a story.

[10:20] Alien Pimbal was announced a few years ago.

[10:23] And we all know the troubles at Andrew Highway encountered getting Alien Pimbal into production.

[10:29] A lot of it was just, you know, probably a little bit of finance,

[10:33] probably a little bit of manufacturing sort of troubles.

[10:37] But the big story that Andrew always sort of held on to was he was waiting

[10:42] for the Alien Ellie artwork to be approved.

[10:45] And that took a long, long time.

[10:48] And on this show, we had debated many, many months.

[10:52] This was sort of early on in 2016 that that Alien Ellie artwork had probably not been submitted to Fox.

[10:59] And it might have been a little bit of a stall tactic.

[11:02] Now, when we started to get to Alien Day 2017, which is Brian, that's in April, right?

[11:10] It's like mid-April or April 9th or something.

[11:13] I should have googled this.

[11:16] Yeah, it's beginning to mid-April sometime in there.

[11:19] Right.

[11:20] So Alien Andrew was sort of promised somewhere around March that we would finally see the Alien Ellie artwork.

[11:30] And when did you get contacted by Andrew Highway Brian to sort of work on this project?

[11:37] And what was the, like, how did the phone ring?

[11:40] Sure. Yeah. And I'll back up a little bit.

[11:43] So prior to this, I was totally unfamiliar with the pinball world.

[11:49] I'm kind of what I like to call like an art mercenary.

[11:53] My wife and I, she works with me.

[11:55] And we've been full-time freelancers for five years now.

[12:00] And we will reach out and work on just about anything.

[12:05] So we do t-shirt designs and packaging designs, logos for all different types of businesses.

[12:14] So we often do a lot of marketing in just tons of different areas.

[12:19] Somebody from spooky pinball, who I previously not been aware of, reached out to us to work on a t-shirt design for, she, what, what does that say?

[12:32] It was the Rob Zombie machine, I think.

[12:37] Unfortunately, I think the quote that we gave was a little too high.

[12:41] So we didn't get that one, but I spoke with the guys and they seemed really, really friendly there.

[12:46] They suggested that I reach out to Highway Pinball just because either he knew they were looking for artists or maybe he just thought it'd be a good fit or maybe he just wanted me to stop talking to him.

[12:59] But anyway, we sent an email to Andrew, and which we do often, you know, we probably send a dozen or so emails a month just reaching out to people we want to work with.

[13:13] And most people either don't reply or they're too busy or the quote doesn't work out.

[13:19] But in this case, Andrew came back and he called me up on the phone and throughout working with him, he's always been a really nice, a nice guy to me.

[13:33] The first project we worked on was a basically just a pitch for a property that they were trying to get.

[13:42] Unfortunately, that didn't work out because they went in a different direction.

[13:47] But when we were finished with that, and this was just like a real quick four hour illustration and nothing real, real serious.

[13:56] But after that, he called me beginning of April and said that, you know, how would you like to work on the alien pinball machine?

[14:06] And I actually, you know, I wasn't even completely aware.

[14:11] I was aware that an alien pinball machine was being built, but I had no idea about any of the, I guess, issues.

[14:20] Right.

[14:21] I really had no reason to suspect that anything was different than what Andrew said.

[14:27] I thought everything was just going along the normal mode of production.

[14:33] But anyway, the phone call said, hey, we have to, we have to get something by alien day, which was four days away.

[14:41] Okay.

[14:42] So an alien day, I looked it up, Brian, is it's April 26.

[14:45] So we're talking April around April 22nd.

[14:50] Yeah.

[14:51] Yeah.

[14:52] So I guess I was way off there.

[14:53] But yeah, so he called me, so let's say alien day was Tuesday.

[14:57] Right.

[14:58] He called me on Friday.

[14:59] So we had, I had the weekend to work on it.

[15:03] It was finished Monday.

[15:05] Then there were, well, so first of all, just working on the thing, that's a pretty tight deadline for me for a piece that big.

[15:14] Right.

[15:15] I wish I had had more time to spend on it, because when I look at it, it looks kind of half finished, but I'm still proud of it.

[15:23] But I wish I, you know, I would have spent a week on it if I could.

[15:27] Have you seen other pinball art?

[15:29] You're saying that is half finished?

[15:31] Do you must look at other stuff and be like, did they even start?

[15:35] Well, yeah, I, there's all kinds of different styles for pinball art that I've seen.

[15:41] Right.

[15:42] So some of, you know, a lot of the line art and color artwork, that's what I gravitate to.

[15:48] If you look at my portfolio, that's what most of it is.

[15:51] Right.

[15:52] That's the stuff I love, like the hyper detail and everything.

[15:55] Sure.

[15:56] But yeah, there are some other styles out there that maybe don't take as much time, but they get the job done.

[16:02] And maybe that's what people like, I don't know.

[16:04] Well, a lot of it's Photoshopped.

[16:06] I mean, so the community over the past few years, pinball used to always be hand drawn for the most part, which people love.

[16:14] And so there's a lot of excitement whenever there's hand drawn artwork.

[16:18] Now, Brian, when you came into the project, and I'll keep letting you go, but what's interesting is,

[16:23] when highway pinball first introduced alien, the message Andrew delivered to the pinball world was,

[16:32] we're not allowed to do any hand drawn alien artwork.

[16:36] So you weren't aware of that, right?

[16:38] When he asked you to do, you know, a hand drawn limited edition piece of working four days.

[16:45] Now, in fact, it was actually quite the opposite, because he told me the whole reason he was hiring me

[16:52] is that they needed somebody to do hand drawn artwork, because he said, he told me that the first table,

[17:00] which had been kind of like a Photoshop graphic design using elements from the movie, he said that the problem with that one was that,

[17:09] unfortunately, a lot of the photos they had to work with were really gritty, you know, because we're talking about a film that was released in the 80s.

[17:17] So when you blow that up on a big machine, it becomes really difficult to make a dynamic image.

[17:24] The other thing, too, is like when you watch the movie, when you see the alien queen, you only see it like in little flashes of light,

[17:32] and it's always in the dark, and you know, that's what makes it so, you know, so freaking cool.

[17:37] But that does not make, that makes it very hard to like Photoshop something from that.

[17:42] You're just working with something.

[17:44] But he told me that, you know, he really liked my art, he was a fan of it, and I guess he wanted the limited edition back glass to be very different from the first machine,

[17:56] which made sense to me, just from a branding point of view, is that you want it to, it's the limited edition, like it should be something different.

[18:06] So that is why at the time I had no reason to suspect anything different, right?

[18:12] I didn't realize that maybe they were having problems with the licensing or that another artist had been working on it,

[18:23] and you know, maybe should have done the back glass, but was not asked for whatever personal reasons between Andrew and that artist.

[18:32] We're running at this point when you got the call, and I know you did the sketches for him on the pitch.

[18:39] Were you aware of Pennside and the Penn Ball sort of community that's out there to sort of investigate what was going on with highway,

[18:47] or were you still sort of just dealing with him at that point?

[18:50] No, so I wasn't aware of Penn inside.

[18:54] I had a feeling that I'm not out there, I'm not out there.

[18:59] Yeah, I'm a new there.

[19:01] The closest I had gotten to the Penn Ball world was just I'm a fan of zombie yetis art, and I had talked to him a couple times just on social media.

[19:13] And so I knew from seeing his Ghostbusters machine, I saw that actually in place we go on vacation a lot.

[19:23] It was the first time I'd really been introduced to Penn Ball artwork for the first time.

[19:28] I'd always seen the classic stuff, but it's only when you see someone you're a fan of do something, that's when you realize, wow, you know, people are really doing this right now.

[19:42] Now as soon as there were some problems with the alien backlash, which I'm guessing might be your next question, that's when I did find Pennside just from googling things, and that's when I kind of stumbled on this whole three year long fight, or maybe it fights not the right word, but drama.

[20:06] Right, the three years ago they get the game out.

[20:10] Let's go back to the timeline.

[20:13] So when Andrew asked you to work on the game, did he say he had an existing L.E.R. package that he had submitted the Fox, or was it more, hey, I've got this thing.

[20:26] I don't think it's like, you know, it's not working with the assets they gave us, so I'd really love for you to sort of show us what you can do.

[20:33] Is it more sort of the ladder?

[20:36] My impression was that everything was done except for the backlash, and the backlash was the last piece of the puzzle that was sort of holding it back, and Andrew really, really wanted, which I understood, to release it on, on alien day, just to kind of like piggyback on that hype.

[20:56] And of course I learned later also to probably, you know, satiate some people and maybe even stall if that's the right word.

[21:10] Well, and you couldn't have known that before April of 2017, Andrew had been telling people that he had been waiting for months for the L.E.R. work to be approved by Fox, so that was a little bit of a clear stall tactic looking back on it now.

[21:29] So you do it, you have four days, right, so walk me through like, what did he give you? He gave you the dimensions of the backlash? How did, how did sort of you get going knowing this deadline was extremely tight?

[21:42] Sure, and we work on, you know, a couple hundred projects a year, so we, we have a pretty solid process.

[21:53] And to me, this wasn't really much different than any other project we work on other than just the sheer awesomeness of being able to work officially with aliens, you know, incredibly exciting, but we kind of approached it the same way we do any other project.

[22:08] And we had a questionnaire, we sent him and got all the dimensions, we got reference photos, I talked to him on the phone, and his direction was very similar to what we ended up with, because I did tell him honestly at first, I said, you know, we only have a couple days of work on this, like we just are not going to have time to go back and forth or have a lot of revisions, which isn't usually the way I work.

[22:36] And usually I like to submit a few thumbnail sketches at first and kind of build, but we just really attack this right out of the gate just because we had to.

[22:48] Luckily from his side, he, it went off really well. We knew from the beginning, we just wanted an alien queen, very big reaching out at you, we wanted the eggs.

[23:02] The thing that he was most concerned about was that everything had to be, you know, to had to be strict with alien cannon, you know, the queen had to have the same number of fingers and all that, and that was a mistake I made at first, so we had to go back and change that.

[23:19] But other than that, I mean, the whole process was very easy and Andrew was extremely easy to work with, which was great until, you know, until the end there.

[23:31] And the way you, I know we will talk a little bit about how we got connected and I think, you know, everyone who was involved in the project, all the vendors that were working with Andrew at that time period, there, you know, there was a lot of sort of delays in terms of people getting paid and I know that the deal you inked with him was a little bit of half to get started in half when it was done, right?

[24:00] And you'd finished it, you submitted it to him, you got it in by the deadline.

[24:05] Did you see on Alien Day, Brian, when he uploaded the video of the tour of the factory where he first revealed to the world your work, were you able to capture that and see that?

[24:17] Yeah, I saw that video and this was still at the time where I thought everything was going just great.

[24:24] And so, you know, and I was really grateful that, you know, he mentioned my name and it looked really cool on the video and I shared the video and everything.

[24:34] I even recorded the whole process of me illustrating the backlash to and sent that to him, but of course, he didn't publish that because of what happened next, you know.

[24:48] But to go back to, yes, I usually ask half a front that was sort of a lesson I learned as a freelancer many years ago that it's really vital to get some money upfront because it really weeds out the bad actors.

[25:05] Right. It reads out that people who aren't serious.

[25:08] In this case, however, and I hope this isn't too much detail, but they insisted on just 25% of front.

[25:18] And I didn't think really anything of it. I just thought maybe it was because we were getting started so quickly and Andrew had paid his last invoice.

[25:29] So I said, let's, you know, who cares, let's go for 25% now. And then another chunk when it's finished. And then he was going to pay the rest 30 days later.

[25:42] Right. When I reached out to you, that was because those things did not happen.

[25:47] And so for listener of this show, this is how Brian and I first got connected. You got to, you can imagine the random fate that I get a Facebook message from Brian.

[25:59] And it says, hey, do you know anything about alien pinball? And this is coming to me who's been covering this for two years. And I'm like, yeah, I know a little bit about what's going on with highway pinball.

[26:12] And I had told Brian about the complications Andrew was having with the machine and with the company and how payment might be an issue and and fill them in on the backstory.

[26:24] Brian, why don't we go back to alien day because when the art was revealed, people absolutely fell over and out of their chair and loved it. And it was almost like, wow, like this is the alien artwork we wish we had from the very get go.

[26:41] And did you know when you made the back? Well, it's, you know, I, it's incredible. And look, we, it's, it's Geeger, right? That's how you say it.

[26:51] Yeah, and he's one of my favorite artists, but I still miss pronouncing all the time.

[26:56] I always say Geiger. So he's art package. And and an alien has inspired the universe of alien and Geeger's art has inspired so much amazing art.

[27:08] I always tell people go in devian art and type in alien and and there's so much great stuff out there. And so when Andrew first revealed the alien pinball machine to the world, this was I want to say circa

[27:20] 2015, 2000, I think 2015, you know, there's a lot of

[27:27] disappointed alien fans because when you have a universe like alien that has such a distinct art style that's usually hand drawn.

[27:36] He picked an artist who isn't to do the machine, who isn't someone who's an illustrator. They're more of a graphic design or someone who works with an artist, someone who more lays out art.

[27:47] And so the story people got from the get go was this is the best we could do. This is all we could do. So it was refreshing to see your work on the machine.

[27:57] When you, when you saw the machine, Brian, did you wish after seeing the rest of it that you also could have had a chance to tackle the play field in the cabinet as well?

[28:08] Absolutely. And not not to say anything derogatory about the artist who did the first one. I'm not saying that mine would have been better, but just that I would have loved that opportunity.

[28:22] And in fact, now in retrospect, I realize this probably Andrew kind of leading me on a bit, but he had kind of implied to me that after we do this back glass, if it's well received, maybe we can go in and he would hire me to do the rest of the art, which, which really got me excited.

[28:42] Right. So I quickly found out that wasn't going to happen, but I would have loved to do that. I would have actually loved your familiar with my artwork. I love to do. I would love to do the alien queen, even more in my style, like with more line art and kind of comic book and exaggerated features and stuff. But I think in this case, that's because you got to make.

[29:11] I think that's the fact that the Fox happy that that would never have flown anyway. But that sure would have been a lot of fun.

[29:19] Well, let me let's let me ask a question because I think the the million dollar question on my mind and on a lot of people's minds listening to the show is Andrew during his video and alien day said, this artwork has been. I just got the approval from Fox.

[29:37] It sounds like he just got the approval minute ago before he held up your art. Was it ever officially approved by Fox?

[29:47] Yeah, it'll take me a second to answer this one. So, as I said, we've been doing this for a while. So it's not.

[29:59] It's not very common for people to not pay their invoices, but it does happen. I would say it happens maybe maybe once every year, there's one of these where there's something that there's a kind of a big open invoice and the people are dragging their feet and you just have to keep how many them and how many of them.

[30:19] Normally, actually so far, everybody has ended up paying those invoices. So when when I gave the final artwork to Andrew to submit it to Fox, we sent the final we sent the the second invoice that wasn't paid right away, but we had we had a million other projects on our desk and you know, I was probably pretty excited just about the release of this thing.

[30:45] So we didn't really follow up on it until a week later, right. We quickly turned into a month and then by the time a month came by the third and final invoices now due.

[30:57] And when and I'll get back to your question in a second, but when after that final follow up when I was really kind of being more aggressive with Andrew, that's when he told me, you know, I got some bad news.

[31:12] I am leaving the company and then of course I started freaking out of that a bit and that's probably when I reached out to you because I think I found it's funny. I found your name in an article somebody interviewed you in an article I found about the history of alien pinball, I guess.

[31:37] And I think I saw that you made a comment on one of my posts. So I just reached out. But it really wasn't until then like 30 days later that I started investigating and then I realized like shit.

[31:51] I didn't think I would ever get paid at that point because I thought maybe the whole company was going down.

[31:59] Right. Which I should say I should say that yeah, I should say that I did get paid eventually, but we can talk about that. But to answer you, so to answer your question, I cannot tell you 100% if it was approved or not.

[32:17] This was the process. The days before alien pinball or alien day. Andrew kept telling me that okay, it's been approved by this guy, this guy, this guy from Fox, but now it just needs to be approved by this guy.

[32:34] Right. And in retrospect, it's possible that wasn't the truth. It's possible. It's possible that it was. I don't know. But now when I talk to the new owners, which I asked in the couple of weeks ago, if it was approved or not, they told me that they believe that Andrew got the approval.

[32:59] But they don't know for sure. I do not know for sure. It's not really not really connected to it anymore to be honest. You know, I gave them the artwork. I got paid. There was no royalty deal or anything like that. So, which is pretty common. That's most of what I do is just flat fee. Here you go. See you later. Hopefully. Right. So Brian, what's interesting is so you you were paid by the new investors, right?

[33:29] They were the original investors for the company. They after Andrew stepped down, they took over the reins at highway. And that's when you were finally paid for your for your work.

[33:41] Yeah. And it took it took a very long time and it took a lot of phone calls to the UK. They were, let's see, what was the guy's name?

[33:53] Gosh, it was drawn of Daniel, I believe. And he was very helpful or maybe it was Roger. They were very helpful and polite. But the thing is, is they just kept telling me that they can't pay yet because their money is sort of frozen off out of country because that's where their bank accounts lie.

[34:18] And I saw on the inside that that was sort of what they were telling everybody. I think it took almost another two months to finally get paid. But I did get paid. So it's nice to have that behind me.

[34:33] Right. And that's one of the reasons we waited to have this podcast was we didn't want to jinx it and tell the story before Brian got his money.

[34:44] So Brian, so what's interesting when you did the back glass, another question I have, which you created probably one of the most amazing dilemmas I've ever seen in the history of pinball. And that is this.

[34:58] Andrew highways back box, the area that you did the artwork in, the majority of people who order his game, they stick a big LCD screen there, which absolutely is in the way of your art.

[35:12] And I've never seen people be so torn because they love your art. They would love to have it on the machine. But they also want to have the screen. And it's almost like, do you feel like you got a little bit of like weird direction to create something that would ultimately be covered up by an LCD screen?

[35:30] Were you like, what, like what's going on?

[35:34] Well, yeah, we were supposed to correct or maybe not correct that issue, but the plan was is that we would have this back glass for the people who did not get the LCD screen.

[35:48] And then after alien day, once we got people's reaction, then, then after I got paid for that, then we would do a second back glass that it basically, it's very similar to the one that we had planned, but I would just move elements around in a way that we can still fill out the back glass.

[36:11] And then have room for the LCD screen. So we're going to move like the Queen's head down where the eggs are now, and then move like the eggs up in the corner and put the hands reaching up.

[36:24] I had sketched out something. I'm not sure if I had ever sent it to Andrew, but unfortunately because all of this happened, I doubt that will get made.

[36:36] I really just still am sitting here with my fingers crossed that my artwork will still be used for an LED if that is ever produced or not.

[36:47] Well, what's interesting is they just put out communication this past week, the new investors saying that the alien standard additions will be going into production August 14th, and then the LEDs will start to go into production probably sometime in September.

[37:05] So what's curious to me and probably to everyone out there who's been following this story is if you order your alien Ellie without the LCD screen, right?

[37:17] And you get the back box that's full artwork. Will it be your art, Brian? I mean, I think that's still right. You're probably waiting on the sidelines with the rest of us to, you know, wondering if they're going to go with it.

[37:29] I do know this. I do know this. I do know that there is a version of the back box that was made by the original artist who worked on alien that is also finished.

[37:45] So I'm curious to see if which one they go with and what I'm going to do to I don't know. Have you seen it, Brian, because I have it. I'm going to share it on on my Facebook page tomorrow when we put up this podcast. But have you seen the original, what it looked like?

[37:59] Yeah, Andrew sent that to me when we were going through this whole process because it helped me get an idea of where things lay and we kind of talked about what things we wanted to change and all that.

[38:14] Right. So yeah, I hadn't seen it. I hope they make it the back glass because actually they are part of our contract is they're supposed to send me two back glasses.

[38:25] I don't I'm not going to hold my breath on that one.

[38:28] Right. So what's interesting is there there probably is and you you've never had any contact with and we can say his name oric loss and was the original artist that worked on the game from the get go. Have you had any contact with oric since he's also an art director or is it just been like completely Chinese wall between you guys and working on this project.

[38:50] So the contact I have and I want to say oric was actually really helpful to me. The contact I have was way after this whole process and I reached out to him on pinside.

[39:07] Once I was having the payment issues and I just told him, you know, I said, hey, I'm the guy that Andrew hired to do this back glass and I said, just wanted to let you know I haven't gotten paid for this yet.

[39:21] And I had heard a rumor which I thought it had surfaced on pinside or something that oric also had not gotten paid.

[39:31] So I kind of wanted to just reach out to him from one artist to another and say like maybe we can help each other get paid.

[39:40] And in any way, he was very nice. He responded immediately and he sent my contact info to the new owners. And at the time, I didn't have any way of contacting the new owners at all because Andrew had not not really helped in that way.

[39:58] And so oric sent an email to them and CC them and kind of just told them my story. And that I think led to the conversation that, you know, almost a month and a half later did get me paid.

[40:14] But oric did say and I feel I feel really terrible about this but he that's when I learned that really Andrew was really kind of hiring me behind orics back.

[40:26] And I did not I had no idea that I was kind of stepping on orics toes to design this. I had thought that oric designed the first machine and it was perfectly normal for another artist to design like the limited edition version.

[40:43] I just seemed to make sense to me. So he let you know that he had he had worked on an Ellie package as well. And I'm sure that wasn't.

[40:54] And I just that was you know it probably make him feel good at all now knowing that Brian you've worked on the Ellie we're not sure like which edition they're going to go with.

[41:05] I think a lot of people do prefer the hand drawn artwork if it's feasible like if Fox will let there be hand drawn alien artwork. Let me throw out a hypothetical and this is this is something that I've heard from certain people in the hobby of her.

[41:20] I've heard from people who have ordered an alien and they saw your work and they said you know what like I'd love for that artwork to go on to the play field and onto the cabinet.

[41:32] This company has now had months since Andrew stepped down if they were to approach you and said how'd you like to do a crack at the play field. Would you be open to that?

[41:45] Well I would take that opportunity but I would make sure to get maybe a larger portion of cash up front maybe make make a stronger contract.

[42:04] I don't know it's a very tricky situation I probably also have to talk with Eric to make sure that he is he's cool with this as well because he seems to I don't know much about Eric but it sounds to me like he's more than just a freelance artist they hired like me.

[42:24] It sounds like he's almost a part of the company and that he put a lot of time into the machine now for me even if I had knockout and paid remember this artwork only took me like three days so that would have been a major bummer but it wouldn't have have wrecked my business or anything like that.

[42:46] I think for the fans of Alien I think people yes and Eric did work a lot on the game the design and I believe his contract was he hasn't been paid at all and his payment was supposed to be an alien Ellie game and then I think he gets a percentage of the revenue when games go out which games haven't really gone out.

[43:12] So he's been working on this thing for a few years and you know but but here's the thing that's always like the dilemma for fans of the franchises the fact that you could create something like that in just a few days and people have watched this machine take a few years to come out.

[43:31] If I'm a fan of Alien part of me is just like man I wonder what it would look like if Brian Allen had like six months to create the art package.

[43:41] And even though like I don't think there's going to be an opportunity this time around you know Brian when we talked I've always said you know artists of your caliber should be the only hands that touch pinball machines especially where they're going with the cost of a machine because you have machines now are costing you know seven thousand eight thousand nine thousand ten thousand dollars and and artwork is such a big part of pinball.

[44:10] Once you got into this story right you you kind of didn't realize you're entering into this tale when it was already eighty percent of the way done.

[44:22] What are your thoughts on pinball coming out of this would you love to work on more pinball machines would you love to show the pinball community what you could do given more time and more freedom to sort of create your best work with pinball.

[44:39] Yeah I absolutely would I would so I made the mistake going in I didn't do enough research on the company you know or the history of the machine but to be honest I was so excited about the opportunity even if I had stumbled upon pinside and seen that there was this huge delay I probably would have still taken the job just because sometimes as a freelancer like me sometimes I'm not going to do anything.

[45:08] I'm not going to answer like me sometimes there's just these jobs that you just take them and even if sometimes maybe they don't pay enough or maybe there's a risk like you should take the job because if it's working with an official property if it's something that a lot of people know and are excited about and if it's just going to be incredibly fun like I knew this would be take it.

[45:33] Yeah I would love to do a machine where I could art direct the whole thing you know I've never designed anything as complex as a table so I I don't know if I can do that without a lot of help but I would love to design the sides and another backlash and things like that because I'm always looking for new things to do as I said I do a lot of t-shirts and logo designs and album covers and things like that.

[46:02] It was so much fun to take a different direction like with this backlash and just do something that I hadn't done before.

[46:11] As an artist in Brian when you look at a pinball playfield so when you say you would you would love would you need art direction help when it comes to laying out the art on a playfield or is it something where you would love to just explore how to bring the world of that.

[46:31] The world of that theme to life on the wood that would compliment the physical elements of the game that are there.

[46:39] I would need somebody to almost supply a blueprint of the table like somebody to help show me where the ball needs to go and what this thing does.

[46:49] Oh yeah yeah yeah.

[46:50] So that's what you mean. So yeah so typically how it works with artists I mean the designer will make a white wood of the machine which is the whole game is basically done and the the wood is white on the playfield and then you lay the art over it.

[47:05] Now your friends with and you know or I don't know how close you guys are but Zambia and you know his story where he worked with a pinball designer named John Papaduke on this game called Magic Girl where he did the art worked on it for years.

[47:19] And John ended up going bankrupt and belly up and Magic Girl is probably one of the most intricate and most detailed art packages ever and you know Jeremy like kind of got his first for a into pinball was kind of a quasi disaster.

[47:39] So a little bit similar than Andrew like two guys who ran companies into the ground but Jeremy is now working at Stern and he's doing games.

[47:48] You know Stern and we got Jersey Jack we've got spooky pinball.

[47:53] I think there's plenty of homes for a talent like you Brian in the pinball world and you know if you could if you could work on a dream pinball theme is there one out there that you would just like

[48:07] love to just illustrate Star Wars or big trouble in the Chinese or anything out there that you would just love to get a crack at.

[48:18] That's a great question. I would love to do something I would love to do something cartoon related like you know like Rick and Morty for example is a cartoon show that I'm really into a design where they're their t-shirts in hot topic right now.

[48:36] And that was that was one of my favorite projects leading up to this or like say the Simpsons or something or family guy right also.

[48:48] Oh man what about a cure I really have a cure I need to pinball machine.

[48:54] Say that again all you have a cure I mean come on canada's been I don't know I've always been waiting for a cure alive action movie but it's never happening.

[49:05] I don't know I feel like they might ruin that.

[49:08] Oh they definitely was it would be like it would be like canna Reeves is canada be a be horrendous they'd whitewash it they always do that they whitewash every like famous Asian franchise it would be like Matt Damon as like Ted suo.

[49:22] Yeah yeah and you're coming about zombie yeti. I don't I've never met him in person I just I reached out to him actually when Andrew highway was talking with me because I I wanted his help you know I I was just honest with them I said I I usually work in these markets I've never worked in pinball so I was asking for his help on how to structure a quote.

[49:51] And that's when he went he was super helpful and he went into his whole story which was the first time I heard it and then I went back and kind of read some some blog posts and things so that you know really urged me to be very careful.

[50:08] Of course didn't look like I was careful enough but it worked out for me in the end and it sounds like it worked out very well for zombie yeti to it's still such a shame.

[50:18] I hate to hear that when that happens to artists especially as somebody as skilled as him and especially when you work for years on something you know it's just it should be a crime.

[50:34] Well the ultimate crime is that John after all the work because it really is Jeremy's work is the only thing that that sort of is noteworthy on magic girl all the pieces John had to do which was like the physical game don't work but the art is amazing he didn't even give Jeremy a game when he mailed out the 25 games to different people he left Jeremy off the list which is just despicable yeah it's terrible so

[51:03] what what's interesting is the Phoenix do rise from the ashes in these sort of sort of tales zombie yeti landed in a good place Matt Andrews who is the other artist that worked with John on magic girl and his other titles Matt Andrews is the artist that just did spooky total nuclear annihilation I know Brian you were taking that what are your thoughts on pinball art in general like maybe you know there's a lot of people complaining about Star Wars I'm one of them.

[51:32] I don't know if you've seen the Star Wars artwork but I know that licenses can be prohibitive but I just still think if the art's not magic I'm really not happy with the game.

[51:46] Yeah and just a caveat like I don't I never want to get up here and and disparage any other artists so my comments are not really against the artist but just more my taste and style.

[52:00] I agree with you on Star Wars I think and you can see this happening all over the place with movie posters in general to a lot of people are aware of this a couple decades ago that was a great place for artists to work because all of the movie posters were like hand painted and illustrated and just really creative and out of the box and then eventually there was you know some talking head marketing guys said.

[52:29] No all movie posters are just going to be Matt Damon's fat floating face you know and they are they so I understand how something like the Star Wars thing happens because that license is so protected that people behind a table just say you know here you go here's the marketing package that you can use.

[52:54] So that being said I can see so I can see how it happened but I think that it was a missed opportunity because the pinball or the pinball table was such a cool canvas and it's such a niche that it's like this isn't something that millions of people are going to see this is just something that the most hardcore fans are going to see so why not.

[53:22] Not take a take a risk and put some style into it you know why not why not grab I don't know if you've read any of the Star Wars comic books I don't read them but my my kid gets them and I look at the artwork the artist is fantastic you know why not why not hire an artist from one of those books and just just make it.

[53:45] That's what I don't get that that's the part of the puzzle when you know Stern's been trying to tell the the buyers and the community and I agree with you these are like die hard Star Wars people like only die hard Star Wars people and pinball fans are going to drop this kind of money on a product.

[54:04] Why is it that I can go look at comic books I can go look at the Zen pinball which is the digital pinball platform out there and see all this amazing hand drawn Star Wars artwork all over the world and then you're telling me that on the pinball machine were relegated to this I just don't buy it I do think it's a cost cutting measure I think it's even if it's working with even if Disney's like hey here's here's what you have to work with.

[54:34] I would assume if you found a bunch of Disney comics where they had the artist listed and you said well what if we work with these guys who you work with all the time I have a hard time believing Disney would say you know we don't want you to work with these guys who we already approve their work we love their work I have a hard time believing that I think it is like money and I think you know a lot of these companies to.

[54:57] It's turns like they're the biggest guys in town so they're constantly making games and I think it's just you know keeping the line moving keeping development going you know sometimes art comes last and I think that's that's the issue I have with a lot of pinball today as I feel like the art just comes at the end when it it should receive as much attention and as much time to get right because once it's done it's done right this thing is going to live in my home.

[55:25] I want to keep it forever I want it to be beautiful forever I can't go change the art I can go add more features and toys and lights and all these things to a game I can change the colors of my legs and railings but the art is the art is the art and when it's not nice I don't care how good the game plays I wanted to look as good as it plays I think most people share those opinions.

[55:51] What did you think of total nuclear annihilation which took a different art direction is much more simple like 80s sort of vibe going to it.

[56:00] I love the I love anything he's I was born 82 so it's kind of my.

[56:06] My home there I like the art I think I made the comment to you last time talk I'm not sure if there's anything more planned for the sides of the table is right now it's just that the big floating 80s pinball right stream of fire behind it I hope that they do some more artwork on the sides but I like I really like the woman character love the like purple laser.

[56:36] I think this is what I would call a digital painting style where there's no lines in it at all and that's that's a really popular style and sometimes I have trouble competing against that because that's something that's very popular in like gaming concept or companies and things like that.

[57:02] My style sort of like stuck in time stuck in the 80s but that's what a lot of people like about it and I've been lucky enough to get a lot of work in layman's terms or to the best of your ability explain your style to someone listening to a podcast you can't quite see it visually so what.

[57:22] What is like how would you describe your style like in an audio way sure.

[57:28] I mean if anyone's listening at this moment you can go to flylanddesigns.com and look at my work let's let's spell that out for people because we said that correctly yeah how do you spell that out for them so it's fly sure I know I wish I could go back in time and pick a name that people can actually spell it's fly FLY land L A N D and then the word designs.

[57:56] Okay so flyland designs I won't make you go into the story of that okay so thanks so then this okay so then so people will see stuff so walk us through like like what your approach is to design when it comes to art.

[58:12] Yeah I think the main difference between my artwork and digital painters artwork is that most of the work goes into the line art that's where most of the details and the rendering happened and then then I like to add like a lot of bright vibrant colors underneath it so it's a very that's how comic books are typically made like you have a pencil and anchor and then someone who colors underneath the line art the line art.

[58:42] So I'm trying to hold the colors in digital painters they'll draw a pencil sketch and then they just go in and they paint over top that usually gives like a more realistic dimensional look but I always like I just enjoy doing the working on the line art.

[59:04] I often take a lot more time than a digital painting style which is kind of unfortunate so I have to take maybe more projects than a digital painter would but I do do some digital painting too and actually this alien back glass that's way more of a digital painting than a drawing really even though it does have some hard edges to it.

[59:29] So what does that mean the difference between digital painting and a drawing is it just done on computer I'm just making stuff up right I don't know what I'm saying.

[59:37] Oh sure yeah yeah well it is funny I always say that I drew this and what not but almost all my work is 100% digital. I have a way come sentique which is basically just like a giant monitor that you can draw on with a stylus.

[59:56] And I use a piece of software called Mongo Studio 5 and to me it feels so much like drawing I just there there's a school of thought out there that it's like you know digital art isn't art it's all about the traditional but I just I really see it now it's just another tool.

[01:00:19] I do still draw a lot on paper but because I'm a full time freelancer and I work with clients so much working digitally just became necessary because it's so much easier to make revisions it's so much easier to move things around faster and then ultimately the final product has to be digital so it just just makes sense.

[01:00:41] Well Brian this has been a great chat I mean I've really I've been I've been living on the peripherals of the alien Ellie art story for for many years now so it's nice to to to hear from you what it was like sort of creating that but most importantly what I wanted to do is just introduce you more to more people in the pinball world because we get about a thousand listeners on this show.

[01:01:10] And last we talked to mad Andrews before spooky sign them up to do total nuclear annihilation and I would love to see your artwork get on the more pinball machines I think that art is something that has always been part of pinball history and I think as we look at games these days the art packages remain to be remain like a hit or miss area and I don't think they should be because I think people like yourself somebody yes I think that's really important to me.

[01:01:40] I'm ready mad Andrews there's just you guys have such a incredible talent that I think pinball machines deserve this kind of hand drawn artwork so how would you I think I know the answer but you would love to work on a machine right I mean I'm going to put you in contact with all the different guys I know like Jersey Jack Charlie you know the new guys in highway like I'm going to go back to the game and you can see that I'm going to be on the other side.

[01:02:10] If they want to make a new machine that they've got your contact information Greg Ferris over at Stern there can never be enough good artist in this industry.

[01:02:21] I love it but I'm not I'm not going to hold my hopes out just because there's so few companies now in pinball and it looks like each company only puts out one or two machines a year and correct me if I'm wrong or in highways case like one every three years.

[01:02:42] So that is a very very tight window you know and since a lot of these machines are already spoken for but I was planning on trying to put together some kind of pinball portfolio and taking it around because even if I can't make a whole machine I'd love to be able to just work on market marketing materials or I don't know maybe another limited edition back glass or something.

[01:03:12] Whatever I can yeah like I think for the pinball manufacturers out there and you're right there's not that many of them and but we're at a period now where there are more pinball machines coming out then in the last 20 years we have more machines coming out now than ever before and I think when you have a great yeah when you have a great you need great artists though like great art I keep saying this about Stern I've been like beating Stern.

[01:03:42] I don't know if you've heard my last few episodes but I've been beating them down that the saving grace for Stern over the past few years has been their incredible artists they've zombie Eddie dirty Donny and Christopher Franchi without those guys work on these machines there's no way Stern could even with a straight face asked people to spend eight nine thousand dollars on these machines.

[01:04:06] So because before them it was all Photoshop we had this whole this I called like the dark ages of pinball art yeah where is all just Photoshop drag and drop assets from the studio and it looked like those shitty movie posters you talked about where it's just here it is and it's not drawn and it's not stylized and it's not laid out for pinball machine it's just cutting and pasting and dropping and we've moved past that but not fully so

[01:04:36] I would I would love to see your work on a game I'm trying to think if are you planning to go to any pinball shows and in just to sort of mingle with the manufacturers at any point.

[01:04:47] Oh man I hadn't thought about that I don't know if there's any near me I live in central Pennsylvania and I got I got two kids here so it's hard to

[01:04:59] Are you near is it's burger is that far from Pittsburgh is it's it's right it's right smack in the middle of the state it's like it's right between Eagles fans and Steelers fans like you know where the no man's land right between there so it's about three hours away from anything interesting.

[01:05:19] I shouldn't say that we're you're familiar with Penn State University that's that's where I live we're right there.

[01:05:26] I'm that's where I would school.

[01:05:29] I went to school in Bethlehem at Lehigh so I'm okay much further east but there was just a big pinball show in in Pittsburgh this past weekend called replay effects and they have this big tournament with like 800 people in it and big show so what we'll do Brian is you know I definitely want to send some emails out to the people I know in the industry and the manufacturers I know I'm always telling Jersey

[01:05:56] Jack I'm like come on. Let's get the art into the into the 21st century that they still a lot of these guys are still working with legacy artists from back in the 90s these guys

[01:06:07] who made the games then and that's cool but I think there's I think there's artists like yourself in contemporary artists and guys they've been you know young and have a new sort of vision for what

[01:06:19] pinball art can be that would be welcomed in the hobby and and I say this

[01:06:24] Brian because people just they loved what you did with alien and I think it

[01:06:27] woke people up I think people have been I think there's nothing more frustrating

[01:06:32] than a theme you love and being told this is you have to accept this is what

[01:06:39] the pinball machine will be I think when they looked at art like yours no one

[01:06:43] looks at that and says you know I could have done it better I would have liked

[01:06:46] it better now they're like I love it and that's that's what art and pinball

[01:06:52] needs to do for people it needs to make them feel like they're in love with it

[01:06:56] and they can't wait to buy it collect it and play it for years so kudos to you

[01:07:01] I think you showed people that the alien art can be something special

[01:07:06] thanks a lot man I appreciate it all right and we will go on kid I hope this

[01:07:14] isn't too for but kind of do a couple plugs or go ahead this is a this might

[01:07:19] me cause a suco on can a this pinball podcast so I did want to say I think I

[01:07:24] mentioned earlier I filmed the whole process of drawing this alien artwork and

[01:07:30] then I I sped it up I don't think they're gonna use that video so I was just

[01:07:35] gonna release it to my YouTube channel probably either Wednesday or Thursday of

[01:07:41] this week so the August 2nd or 3rd if you're interested in checking that out

[01:07:45] you just go to just search for fly land designs in YouTube I have a lot of

[01:07:52] artwork channels there and you know drawing videos and how to stuff and if

[01:08:00] anybody's interested I'm selling I printed out a hundred of these alien

[01:08:06] back glasses on some really nice thick paper and I was just gonna sign those

[01:08:13] and send them out so if anyone's interested I've got them in my shop at flyland

[01:08:17] designs dot com backslash shop and I'd love to send one out to you great and let

[01:08:25] me let me recommend something Brian now are you on pinside at all do you have an

[01:08:30] account yeah I did get an account mainly just to contact

[01:08:36] Eric when I really needed some help I there were a bunch of times during kind

[01:08:43] of the fiasco that I wanted to sort of poke my head out but I was in a weird

[01:08:49] spot because I didn't want I was in weird spot for a couple reasons one when

[01:08:55] you're owed money you don't want to upset the people who owe you money because

[01:09:01] you might not get your money which if you think about it is really terrible

[01:09:04] because I didn't do it you know when people owe you money you didn't do anything

[01:09:09] wrong it's it's there it's no longer their money they're just holding your

[01:09:14] money now and it's just a shame that you have to feel that way but the other

[01:09:19] thing is I didn't I didn't want to disrupt anything unfairly I thought that if

[01:09:27] I came out and said hey I did this artwork but I haven't been paid yet

[01:09:34] I didn't want to tip over a boat that was maybe already rocking and the other

[01:09:40] the other thing actually we didn't talk about was that our contract with

[01:09:46] Andrew had said that they are not allowed to use the artwork until full payment

[01:09:52] is received I usually put that in all of my contracts just to protect this

[01:09:57] exact situation from happening but it seemed like on Pinside or Pinside that

[01:10:04] somebody had released a picture of an LEE machine with my artwork on it so I

[01:10:11] had contacted Andrew and I had tried to contact that person too just to get

[01:10:17] some more information about it they never replied but they did actually we

[01:10:23] know we see the the way the story that that part of the story so first of all

[01:10:31] so when he showed it on the YouTube video was he allowed to do that without

[01:10:34] final payment yes the stipulation is basically they're not allowed to sell it

[01:10:42] right so they they can market it they can they can use it for promotional

[01:10:47] issues and to be honest a lot of times when I work with people especially bigger

[01:10:54] clients sometimes just because it's a bigger organization it can sometimes take

[01:10:59] 30 days sometimes even more to get paid I worked with Activision once which

[01:11:06] was a really great opportunity but it took them almost 90 days to pay their

[01:11:13] final invoice which is a pain yeah pain yeah you know you know they're not

[01:11:19] going out of business that's probably where they do it but what happened with

[01:11:22] that LEE and your art going to that customer and and we know who he he's a

[01:11:26] gentleman in Florida what Andrew did and this is sort of like his 11th hour

[01:11:31] Hail Mary pass as he realized you know shit like people are waiting for their

[01:11:37] games and no one believes that production has has begun and and the

[01:11:41] LE the LE buyers were the most sort of adamant for news because those were

[01:11:46] the people that went in the earliest you know the limited edition are the

[01:11:50] biggest fans and when he did was he sent a machine to someone in Florida and

[01:11:55] put on the box that it was alien Ellie number 94 and it was really just a

[01:12:01] standard alien but he included your artwork and the different anniversary sort

[01:12:09] of side panels that went into the cabinet as that was like his final stall

[01:12:14] tactic to basically say look the LEDs are shipping so that it would calm people

[01:12:19] down and keep them from doing a run on the bank it was later revealed that that

[01:12:24] game wasn't really a full LE that you know he was just using I think your asset

[01:12:29] to calm people's fears but all that is now water under the bridge right it's

[01:12:35] the the tail of Andrew highway will I think ends with that sort of constant

[01:12:42] manipulating of of his vendors and his customers and the new investors seem to

[01:12:48] have things on track but we'll see we'll see I think as someone keeps saying on

[01:12:53] Pinside they've got one foot on the banana peel and one foot in the grave so

[01:12:58] we'll see if they could get turned things around but here's here's what I

[01:13:02] want to say about Pinside though Brian is if you have an account and it's registered

[01:13:06] and it allows you to post inside the alien threads I highly recommend you

[01:13:14] sharing the video link there as well as the selling your hundred prints because I

[01:13:19] think you will sell them out to those fans immediately on Pinside just

[01:13:25] because it's it's it's a great environment where everyone there is all your

[01:13:31] customers are right there you know they don't think that they might not listen to

[01:13:34] not everyone in alien might listen to my podcast simply because I've been so so

[01:13:41] down and out on highway for so long following him but but if you if you go on

[01:13:46] Pinside I think you'll get a lot of warm reception and people would love to

[01:13:49] also just congratulate you for the artwork you created knowing that you're on

[01:13:53] the site so that's just my recommendation yeah I'll definitely get into that

[01:14:00] thanks Chris and then get the hell out of Pinside because everyone is also

[01:14:05] community we're like there's so many trolls and people screaming all day long

[01:14:08] about because pimples it's not healthy to to talk about something every day for

[01:14:14] hours and that's what everyone does on the forms and you know form behavior it's

[01:14:18] the same no matter what the topic is if people are just always like screaming

[01:14:21] about something but Brian we're at the hour mark I really appreciate this this

[01:14:27] has been great and again I hope to I hope to see your artwork on additional

[01:14:33] pinball items whether it's a machine or t-shirts or toppers or back glasses I

[01:14:38] think you can really add some great value to pinball and I think pinball fans

[01:14:43] would love to see your art on items in the future so thank you for joining us

[01:14:48] yeah thanks a lot man I mean it's a huge compliment to be asked to talk and and

[01:14:54] I appreciate it big time and I appreciate your help through this whole thing

[01:14:59] and we got worked out yep I'm really happy you got paid and yeah it's been a

[01:15:05] pleasure and I look forward to continuing our our conversations good stuff

[01:15:09] all right well that was Brian Allen and I really want to take my hat off and

[01:15:15] thank him for being so candid and so honest with me and with you the listener I

[01:15:21] think his story was a really important one to tell and I'm glad we got a chance

[01:15:26] to sit down and tell you the entire story completely unfiltered completely

[01:15:32] unfiltered I hope everyone learns a lesson learns a lesson that things aren't always

[01:15:39] as good as they seem that in fact a lot of deception and a lot of dishonesty

[01:15:46] goes on in the pinball world it's just the way it is but I also want people to

[01:15:52] take a look at Brian's work I'm looking at it right now and I can't help but feel

[01:15:58] really compelled to send the new investors at highway pinball in email saying

[01:16:05] you should really hit pause and this guy do the play field if I was an alien

[01:16:13] buyer why didn't they have Brian Allen work on the rest of the machine after he

[01:16:21] showed how capable he was with this backlash I mean he did this in April of 2017

[01:16:30] in four days so that's May June July three months they had to ask him to work on

[01:16:41] other elements of the game at least they've been in charge for at least a month

[01:16:45] now imagine what he could do if he was given the ability to take that beautiful

[01:16:51] artwork and spread it over the play field spread it over the cabinet artwork I

[01:16:57] think they should I think if I was in on an alien I would definitely hit up the

[01:17:01] investors and and plead with them to change the art and the ultimate irony the

[01:17:08] ultimate irony is that the art that would be replaced you know is the same

[01:17:14] person who got the artwork replaced on the hobbit and sometimes it can just be

[01:17:19] done better and that's what I hope we can avoid in the future is getting these

[01:17:25] machines revealed and everyone's like it could just be so much better if we

[01:17:31] used a better artist so I hope Brian finds more work in Pimbal and I hope all of

[01:17:37] you out there all of you out there just keep your expectations really high I think

[01:17:44] a lot of us now are starting to realize for the money we're spending you

[01:17:49] deserve to have the best possible art the best possible toys the best possible

[01:17:55] designers making these games for you they these are unnecessary toys that we

[01:18:02] want to hold on to and we want them to be as amazing as they can be so that was

[01:18:08] episode 148 of Canatus Pimbal podcast I hope you enjoyed it I'm gonna do one
