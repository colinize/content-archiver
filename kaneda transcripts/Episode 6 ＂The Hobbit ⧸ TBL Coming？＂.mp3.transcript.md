[00:00] Hey! Hey, Kinnate! Someone's got your bike!

[00:03] No way, my bike! Down there! Look!

[00:15] Episode 6 of Kinnate's Pinball Podcasts. Tonight we're going to talk about

[00:21] the Hobbit and Big Lebowski. Are these pins after all of the hype, all of the delays,

[00:28] all of the expectations? Are they going to come out soon? I want to talk about LCD screens.

[00:35] And someone asked an interesting question, are they going to devalue DMD pins in the future?

[00:42] I want to talk about Game of Thrones premium shipping and my thoughts on that.

[00:47] And then I want to leave you guys this evening with a nugget to chew on

[00:53] next time you think about pre-ordering a pinball machine. But let's start this evening with the Hobbit.

[00:59] It is impossible to really get excited about the Hobbit finally shipping

[01:06] for those people that have followed this thing over the years.

[01:15] For those people who have been struggling for three years, I feel like,

[01:19] this is how they feel when they think about going in on this game.

[01:23] I wish none of this had happened.

[01:28] So do all who live to seize its time, but that is not for them to decide.

[01:34] All we have to decide is what to do with the time of the skilleters.

[01:40] Well, Jack has sure given us a lot of time to think about this one.

[01:45] I want to go back and remind people that timeline for Hobbit,

[01:50] just so it is fresh in our inner memory as we go into this discussion.

[01:54] So the Hobbit was initially announced.

[01:57] It looks like if I'm right December of 2012, which is insane when you think about it now.

[02:05] And it was offered at a limited edition price of $7,500.

[02:12] And there was a thousand limited edition games with an additional 500 LEDs built for Europe.

[02:21] So 1,500 in total.

[02:22] And the way it worked, I believe if you had an Emerald City Waves, you were given that opportunity

[02:28] to pre-order Hobbit for $500 that was refundable up into a certain point.

[02:33] After that date, which looks like it was February 15th, 2013, the price would go up to

[02:42] $8,000 for pre-orders.

[02:47] What's interesting is let's look at the price, first of all, $7,500 in our perception of a

[02:54] $7,500 game back then and how different that is to sort of how we're looking at games now.

[03:03] One user named Gooney said, I'm sure it will be a great game, but wow, $7,500 for the

[03:11] pre-order price. I was considering a buy, but that might just push it out of the box for me.

[03:17] That's a big chunk of change for sure. And that got a lot of the up-fotes, 7-up-fotes on that

[03:23] comment. Pincroma, I might say that right? Pincroma. Everyone bitching over the $75

[03:31] price tag didn't buy in ACDCLE did they. It was 8K, $6,300 for premium.

[03:39] Another nearly 2K on top of that for the back-and-black LE.

[03:49] Pappy Boynton said, I think I'll wait until I get my was to decide for sure.

[03:54] However, I'm not too thrilled about getting pressure to make my decision before I get the first

[03:59] game. To deliver the first game, then talk about taking deposits for the second game, Jack.

[04:05] Why they're rushed to get our money before the first game ships makes me wonder.

[04:10] What clear Boynt words those were if you think about it. That was the controversy at the time.

[04:17] Jack was asking for these pre-orderers when not all of the wases were out the door,

[04:21] and he was already trying to collect money on game 2. But he said some things that really made

[04:26] people feel like they were going to get their game and it was going to happen in a timely fashion.

[04:32] Jack said, everyone can now see the type of quality games we are building and our second

[04:38] game will move along much faster than our first game did. We must ship this game as the third

[04:44] movie hits the theaters. That last line he has never really been able to live down that people

[04:50] really expected this movie to come out in 2014 because of that film coming out then.

[04:57] There's no point in beating a dead horse about this, but I'll say this.

[05:04] We all have seen this whole thing unravel. We saw the reveal at Expo. We saw the reaction to

[05:12] smoug. I think the dragon still remains an underwhelming feature of the game. But the game

[05:19] initially didn't look that great. The art was a bit of a miss and it was just a pretty much

[05:26] a yawn. But the feedback he got from a lot of people after that 2014 Expo led JJP to go back and

[05:33] really redo the game and make it much more appealing and a much nicer package all around.

[05:38] So everyone's happy with where the game was, but then it just hit this wall for a year.

[05:44] And it just felt like one thing happened. It felt like they were out of money.

[05:50] And there was a lot of concern. I mean there's a lot of speculation that JJP

[05:55] was financially under water and they weren't going to be able to make the hobbit.

[05:58] And rumors of vendors not being paid. And of course Jack denied all this stuff and everything was called

[06:04] BS. But no pin shift. So who do you believe in a situation like that where you have the company

[06:16] telling you everything's fine. There's some unforeseen delays and a year goes by.

[06:22] And then another year goes by. So here we are. It's January 2016 and it looks like a hobbit

[06:30] is finally, finally, finally in the place where everyone has wanted to see it for a long time.

[06:37] And that is on the assembly line. We've seen photos now of what look like

[06:44] the final production games being made right now. It looks like the JJP factory is freezing cold

[06:51] as the workers all have winter hats on. But the games are being made. The games are being made.

[06:58] And these are not the six sort of final prototype test units. These look like the final final games.

[07:05] And we've heard a release date of March 1st. It seems that distributors are saying this game

[07:16] is going to ship by. So fingers crossed, fingers crossed that this game finally does ship.

[07:26] I'm going to give you my overall point of view on the hobbit and

[07:31] how I think it's going to be perceived. And some of my feelings about this. So I haven't had

[07:42] a chance to play the hobbit very much. It's a popular pinnacle shows. I went to the JJP

[07:48] Open House that he had last year and they only had one hobbit. And there was always a long,

[07:55] long line to get on it. And I got about two games on it. And it was fun. I wasn't blown away by it.

[08:03] I wasn't blown away by any of the shots. I thought that the LCD screen was gorgeous.

[08:13] And I still think you need to spend more time with that size of a screen to understand

[08:17] where to look quickly. But just watching people play it was absolutely incredible.

[08:22] I've never played the pinnacle. I've never played the pinnacle and be like, I have to own this.

[08:30] It's beautiful though. And I think JJP makes pins that when you look at them,

[08:37] you almost just want to own them because of how much nicer they look than most sterns

[08:43] that are out there and new sterns that are shipping. It's just the fact. I mean, you put

[08:48] was next to anything and it's hard to deny how gorgeous that machine is.

[08:55] But more than anything, I think what's happened is the hype is lost. And we're going to talk about

[09:01] this too with like Lebowski. But the hype, it's hard to keep hype going. It's hard to keep people

[09:08] excited and really looking forward to something when you string them along for so many years.

[09:14] Because by the time it comes out, something happens. It doesn't feel new at all.

[09:20] It just feels like we've seen this thing now for years. We've heard about it for years.

[09:27] And so the hobbit has a huge hill to climb and it's really, really got to blow people away

[09:35] with with the code by Keith. There's high expectations for that. And I think we all agree that

[09:42] he's going to knock that out of the park. And there's been a recent sort of, again,

[09:50] not a false promise or misleading thing, but the rails in the game were powder coated.

[09:58] And it looks like now they're not. And now they're just silver. I think that's a mistake.

[10:08] I think they should be brass. I think brass sets off the world of middle earth like nothing else.

[10:16] Brass on the other rings looks incredible. Jack should have gone for brass. For the price of this

[10:23] game, when you put the hobbit next to Lord of the Rings, you really want to have them look like

[10:30] they come from the same world. And I'm sorry, but the silver on that, I don't know, you know,

[10:36] no way, no way. These don't need to be brass. But, but I was saying about the hype.

[10:42] It's the movies, the movies for the hobbit were never that great. You know, it's hard to

[10:49] argue that these things are even close to being as good as Lord of the Rings. They're not,

[10:53] I mean, Lord of the Rings won best picture. Lord of the Rings was a labor of love that Peter

[10:59] Jackson put into for years and years and years. The hobbit was a mess. And there's a great

[11:05] video you guys should all look for on YouTube where Peter Jackson talks about the making of the

[11:09] hobbit and how because the director who was supposed to, you know, direct to films bailed in the

[11:16] eleventh hour, Jackson had to come in and just like sort of wing the whole movie. I mean,

[11:21] there's this great line where he talks about he's filming a battle scene and he doesn't even know

[11:26] who's supposed to win the battle or what's supposed to happen or why this battle is even going on.

[11:32] But they just shot it and just like, well, heck, we're just edited and make, you know, help it make

[11:38] sense when we edit the film. But I mean, it's just a mess. So I think the hobbit for me is a theme that

[11:46] sure it's a classical theme theme, but the films themselves are very underwhelming. So

[11:53] that is a strike against this pen. When Jack started making it, he thought it was going to be great.

[12:01] The same way everyone thought episode one Star Wars would be great when pinball 2k took that

[12:08] license. And this is not as bad as that movie, but so we'll see. We'll see if hobbit ships

[12:14] March 1st. I hope it does. And my prediction is this, it's going to come out. It's going to be

[12:19] beautiful. I think it's really going to stand out and people's collections and people are going

[12:24] to be wowed by it. But I think the one thing that's really going to blow people away and we've got

[12:29] in some samples of this, but I think the sound, I think the sound is going to, I want to use the

[12:40] word revolutionized what we expect from a pinball machine in terms of how it can sound. And I think

[12:48] sound, it goes such a long way in immersing you into a pen. And it's just the package that they're

[12:56] working on. It is going to be incredible. The sound master on the game, David Teal,

[13:06] it looks like they're going to have over a thousand speech callouts that are taken from the movies.

[13:13] Over a thousand sound effects have been extracted as well with over 400 custom awards stinger. So

[13:21] I don't know. I hope all of this adds up to being an epic, unexpected journey like the film. And

[13:32] and I hope the pen delivers. But just ship it. I'm so bored of waiting for this thing to come out. I

[13:38] know everyone else is the JJP faithful or have been just completely abused. And it's time to get it

[13:46] out. I heard from someone on the line who's making the hobbit that you know, Jack recently gave

[13:54] them a speech to sort of get them motivated to get it out the door quickly. And I wanted to just

[13:58] play that for you guys so you could hear you know with the way Jack is talking to them just to

[14:04] to get them to to speed it up a little bit. We will not go quietly into the night. We will not

[14:11] vanish without a fight. We're going to live on. We're going to survive. Today we celebrate

[14:21] our Independence Day. Well, you're not going to be quite independent because you got financial

[14:27] investors that own a big chunk of that company, Jack. But get the pin out in the next couple months.

[14:33] Please. Okay. Another pin that again is just forever pending is the big Lebowski. Now

[14:46] it looks like this thing is also about to ship which is going to be interesting. These two expensive

[14:52] pins coming out around the same time. But I you know, I called over to Dutch pinball and I just

[14:57] wanted to hear from them. If indeed it looks like the recent rumors that the big Lebowski is going

[15:03] to ship soon are true and here's what they said to me. Man, I've got certain information. All right,

[15:09] certain things have come to light and you know, as it ever occurred to you that instead of

[15:16] you know running around blaming me, you know, given the nature of all this new shit, you know,

[15:23] this could be a lot more complex. I mean, it's not just it might not be just such a simple,

[15:32] you know, and he's right. If there's one thing that we've learned over the past three to four years,

[15:41] it's that building a pinball machine is not simple. So I understand why they say that.

[15:47] But here's a thing. If you're going to show something that looks like it's final and then go back

[15:58] and rework the whole thing, go back and pull elements out because you didn't have a license for them,

[16:06] you're going to lose all of the goodwill you built up with the launch and no company's gone from

[16:12] hero to zero, quite like Dutch pinball. These guys rocked in the expo like rock stars. They were

[16:17] talking shit about everybody right. They were, they had the pen house. You know, they they were

[16:23] already standing or putting themselves on a throne that they didn't really deserve and

[16:29] and they went about it in a way that you know, it was so cool to experience it when they revealed it

[16:35] and then all it's been since then is is backtracking and and and then trying to go about it

[16:41] in a professional manner and hearing them speak at 2015 expo, you know, it was really met with

[16:50] a lot of just apathy. No one really wants to give them the benefit of the doubt and I don't think

[16:56] anything, I don't think it was funny the way they were talking about the licensing issues and how

[17:03] they really didn't quite understand it and and when the licenseer was says you can't do this,

[17:10] they just thought it was his suggestions so they would do it anyway and anyway and then you know

[17:14] in the whole fill gate thing where he whistle blew about all the issues with their pen. So that

[17:19] pen has become another pen that people are just speculating will it ever see the light of day.

[17:26] The everyone's in them while every few months they'll show some

[17:31] production video. I think we saw something of robots clear coding play fields and all this stuff

[17:38] just does sort of hold people over but now it looks like they've sort of gone and they've got

[17:44] Roger Sharp and they cleared up all the issues they've got musicians to come in and and help fill in

[17:51] the musical score where they can't use official artists. They've removed marijuana leaves and

[17:57] collouabotels from the play field. The pen is gorgeous I'll say that I mean I played it for hours

[18:06] at modern pinball in New York City when they did their little tour of the pen. I don't say hours

[18:11] I probably paid it for a good half hour which is a lot of time to put on that pen and you know it's

[18:17] it's a stunning pen. I'm still curious about the modes in the game and how deep it is and the code

[18:25] because what they showed it exposed didn't seem to have any any deep code at all and it seemed

[18:32] the same same thing and that's what's making people head scratches like is this thing ready to ship

[18:38] this thing better ship with finished code or near finished code and and and and they're better not

[18:45] be features that are not available or things that aren't being utilized properly after all this

[18:52] time has passed and here's why so CoinTaker says this thing's now available for pre-order and it's

[18:58] available for $10,000 and everybody is just like what the f 10 grand and I think it's because there

[19:08] was an exchange rate issue and that's just what it's going to cost now. Here's I want to give my

[19:16] honest assessment when I see that price of $10,000 and what Dutch pinball is bringing to the table

[19:23] when I see the price of the Hobbit and the Waz and what JJJP is bringing to the table and then I see

[19:30] the price of of Stern pinball machines and what they bring to the table. When I see $10,000 for

[19:40] the big Lebowski and I look at the pin and I look at what they've done to it and I look at how

[19:45] a lot of work has been done underneath the play field and how nice that looks and how they

[19:51] re-engineered everything on it and how they need to sell the pin at a price to make money.

[19:57] I think $10,000 is where they need to be. If you want to start a pinball company to actually succeed

[20:06] and bring a high level of innovation to the game you are looking at around $10,000 to survive.

[20:18] This isn't in an industry where you can release something and take a huge loss on it,

[20:23] release the second thing, take a huge loss because you're setting yourself up for market share for

[20:27] game 3. Now you need game 1 to make you money or to do well. The point of making is these guys

[20:36] JJP and Dutch are bringing a higher level of innovation to the table and a lot of this stuff is

[20:45] you know custom made and they have to find vendors to make it and it's not cheap and it's not easy.

[20:52] That lower play field on the Big Lebowski, the pinball, sorry, the bowling alley, sorry,

[20:59] I'm doing this, it's 12.30 am and I need to get up in the morning for my trip so I'm sorry,

[21:07] I'm a little slow tonight. But that bowling alley is one of the coolest mechs to ever go in.

[21:14] Pinball machine. If you've played it and those people say oh it's going to get repetitive,

[21:21] name me a lower play field that is that freaking cool, that it's just like holy cow. And it just

[21:27] ties to the theme perfectly and that's the kind of innovation I want to see in pinball is

[21:32] something like that. And you know so it's a high quality pin and they need to make money on it

[21:42] and they spent years developing it and there's a market for it. The people who cry the

[21:49] loudest on pinside about price are usually never even in on the game. They can't,

[21:59] they may not be able to afford it or they can't afford it but it's just out of what,

[22:04] you know, out of their sort of limit for what they'll spend on a toy like this. I mean we see

[22:09] that a lot. People saying I have my threshold and anything above that I won't go. And for people to

[22:17] have seen pins go from like $5,000 a few years ago, $6,000 all the way up now to $10,000 for these

[22:26] sort of high end pins. It seems like it's getting at a hand right? Especially considering when people

[22:33] bought a Tron LE for just a few years ago. But I'll say this, the Bowsky Hobbit,

[22:44] these pins are much much nicer in terms of what's inside than Tron LE. All right? And the reason

[22:51] spooky can get away with surviving and not charging these prices is the level of innovation and

[23:02] quality of the pins. I love what spooky is doing and they're making pins to sell at a great price

[23:09] point. But you can't even compare a spooky pinball machine next to a was or a big Lebowski. You just can't.

[23:23] And it's apples to oranges, right? But I look at Lebowski and I look at was and I look at Hobbit

[23:33] and it almost looks like those things could be twice the price of what you're getting in a spooky pinball

[23:40] machine or a Stern pro. But whenever I say that, people just chastise me and look, I didn't set these

[23:47] prices guys. I'm not I'm not the one to blame. I mean, some people blame JJP. They came in and

[23:55] they they immediately said we're gonna we're gonna raise the bar in terms of quality. We're gonna

[24:00] charge this price. But you know, if Jack priced was where he needed to not to go belly up financially

[24:09] and you can't tell me they didn't on that pin, it should have been closer to 10 grand. In fact,

[24:14] I look at was and it looks way more intricate two upper play fields, all this stuff going on than

[24:22] the Hobbit does. And then maybe, you know, the Hobbit's got a lot more going on underneath. But these

[24:28] pins, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if if where the profit margin lies and and what the

[24:35] margins are on these things. Stern's loving it because Stern's got such an easier time making

[24:42] these things and pumping them out the door and they can keep they can keep raising their prices

[24:49] because they know at the end of the day, the collector who's got deep pockets is addicted to that

[24:58] new inbox feeling. You know, there's an itch that only a new inbox can scratch and they will constantly

[25:06] see how much before we go too far. And you know, there's been the whole conversation about bubble

[25:13] bursting, why not? But it hasn't. And you know, Spider-Man, Vault Edition has sold well for them. They

[25:20] hit their numbers. So back to Lebowski, it's 10 grand and everyone's flipping out and everyone says,

[25:25] like, this is going to fail and it's going to flop. And I think the complete opposite is going to

[25:30] happen. I predict that once this pin ships and they can ship in volume and people start seeing

[25:42] this pin in homes and in collections, people are going to want one. And they're going to want one

[25:49] at 10,000 and if it's 10,000 dollars, they're going to they're going to get one. I don't know what the

[25:55] you know, the resale market is going to be for a pin like this. I don't know if people are going to be

[25:59] as quick to sell pins that they spend a lot on. I think people are going to be more likely to hold

[26:08] on to a pin once you start getting to this price level. We see a lot of wazes go up for sale.

[26:16] I see them sort of for sale all the time and owners are usually trying to recoup

[26:23] sort of close to what they paid for it. And that's another thing that's going to change. If you go

[26:29] in on Lebowski and you go in on Hobbit and you go in on a waz and you go in on these high

[26:38] price pins. My prediction and this is in the future is that these things are going to go down and

[26:46] value much more than people expect because their reign at the top won't last very long. And it's

[27:01] sort of like is this I mean I'm going to use a cargument but like the way a hundred thousand dollar

[27:08] car can sometimes appreciate faster than a car that's fifty thousand dollars. Just because more people

[27:17] can can you know if you're going to spend eight thousand dollars do you want to get a brand

[27:24] say let's say eight thousand dollars becomes the used price or nine thousand dollars for Lebowski.

[27:31] Are you going to spend nine thousand dollars on a used pin that you have to ship or go pick up

[27:35] would you rather spend seventy five hundred eight thousand on a brand new inbox pinnets yours.

[27:42] I don't know I really I don't know what's going to happen.

[27:51] But I hope that this pin ships soon as well. It's good you know I think and I said this in another

[27:56] another time and I said this in a thread. The first six half of twenty the first sorry guys again

[28:07] late the first half of 2016 is going to be really interesting if Hobbit ships Lebowski ships

[28:18] I thought alien my ship I don't think it's going to but Ghostbusters looks like it'll ship

[28:23] just those you could just take those three games by themselves and man I don't think I've seen

[28:34] any time in the last few years where three like very premium high price pens have shipped and

[28:43] and like at this price point we've got to be honest we are going after they are going after

[28:49] people with money right with money to burn on these expensive expensive toys don't be an idiot and

[29:03] do everything you can to get your hands on one and and and suffer financially in other areas

[29:08] your life I just saw a post on pinside that oh we and when I and they'll you always see these a few

[29:16] you know few of these where some guy was selling a Game of Thrones Ellie with with like I think like

[29:23] 40 something plays or just brand new and people are like well like did you just get it and realize

[29:29] it's not a good pin or you're not into it and you get the response I really need the money

[29:39] I need the money when when I read stuff like that just like you dope I don't care like if you should

[29:49] never be in a situation in life where you have to sell a pinball machine to get to raise money

[29:55] for something that's more important whether it's medical bills or family emergency if you have

[30:01] the cellular pin to get that money and use a pinball machine as your liquid asset something's wrong

[30:12] something is definitely wrong you shouldn't do that so you know everyone's bitch in 10,000 my

[30:22] prediction is Lebowski if it ships it's gonna so well I would love to have one I just have a hard time

[30:35] falling in love with that theme as some other people you know some other people might love that

[30:40] theme more than I do I I have to be honest I I even I enjoy the Lebowski film I'm not like crazy about

[30:47] it like I don't I don't put it on frequently I'm not part of the cult following that film

[30:54] for some reason when that film came out I think I just I just missed it I I heard about it I probably

[31:00] saw bits and pieces but it never became sort of like part of my like favorite flicks it doesn't mean

[31:07] I don't think it's a great movie I definitely think it is I just don't have the emotional attachment to

[31:11] that theme that I do to let's say like like Ghostbusters which is a game that I

[31:16] or sorry a movie I grew up and then I've seen so many more times I know all the lines from those movies

[31:22] so we'll see what happens you know is there a room for these three to tango in the first half of

[31:27] 2016 and will they all do well I think if they all ship they'll all do well because the market

[31:35] place for these pins the market are gentlemen who have a lot of money to spend and and I think

[31:42] they'll acquire them so I want to move gears now to another topic that someone posted on

[31:52] Pinside that was just interesting I will blabber this too much I'll give you my thoughts on it and

[31:58] the question was asked will LCD devalued DMD pins and that it seems like the majority of people

[32:12] are saying no it won't and someone even said in the thread is this canada like you know like

[32:21] we're speculating on pinball prices and how technology might have impact that come on of course

[32:30] innovation and new pin technology is going to drive down the value of

[32:38] DMD's DMD's are now you have to look at them a few ways now there's dots just red dots

[32:50] that now looks so bad when I look at Game of Thrones and and I see this you know I like the

[33:01] the cabinet arts growing on me and and I see the light show and then I see those dots it's like

[33:07] like you've got to be kidding me those dots cargument coming they look like putting 14 inch rims

[33:14] on a modern sports car there's just like so embarrassing that Stern is getting away with this

[33:20] crap and and and people are buying it and so yeah like if you have LCDs in there that

[33:30] can bring HD visuals and and and awesome graphics to the to the to the pins that are going to

[33:40] happen in the next few years I don't know people are going to hold those is you know more valuable

[33:48] you look there's a big caveat here right I'm anticipating that along with the LCDs the the new

[33:55] pins coming out will also contain more innovations like like this sound that's going to happen in

[34:02] the hobby but I think you're going to hear the hobby and be like well just the sound alone makes

[34:06] all those pins from the last 10 years feel obsolete you're going to see stuff like Lebowski and

[34:14] the lower play field innovation and really no pushing the envelope but we keep hearing all these

[34:19] rumors that Ghostbusters is going to have all these toys and mechs that are you know going above

[34:25] and beyond and brings 10 times the innovation so it's not just LCD that's going to devise

[34:31] you DMDs it's Pimbal Innovation in general that will come with LCD that will be seen as like the

[34:40] new package the next leap forward HD video right stereo sound all these things are going to I

[34:55] think make the DMD air pins feel a little bit dated now what that will do to the value I it's

[35:03] hard to say I do think they'll go down but I just think they're going to go down in general because

[35:09] of one thing there's just going to be so much more volume of Pimbal and there's not there if

[35:17] Pimbal is in a resurgence right now and more new Pimbal is going to come out in 2016 then it's

[35:23] come out in the last maybe 15 years in terms of a single year like this year could produce more Pimbal

[35:29] than than 15 20 years that's insane when you think about it that this hobby is having you know a

[35:41] second coming it's not happening in the arcade business sure they're making new arcade games for

[35:48] places like Dave and Busters but I collect some arcade machines there no one's really home collecting

[35:55] any of these new ones and those machines are are also getting like really pricey but no one's

[36:03] putting them in their home very very few people are there's far more people putting new in box

[36:08] Pimbal machines in their home so if you're buying a pen and this this sort of raises another question

[36:17] and you're trying to speculate price you know I think you're you're going to be in for a shaky

[36:26] not everything's going to pan out the way people think I've seen a lot of people speculating

[36:34] that spooky Pimbal's Rob Zombie Pimbal machine will immediately be worth $8,000 because it's rare

[36:41] and the weight list for it is twice as long I don't I don't see that happening

[36:48] if nothing else was shipping maybe but you can't tell me if Hobbit, Lebowski and other Pimbs are

[36:57] shipping that someone's going to go off for 8 grand for a pen that sold for 6 grand the

[37:03] the anomaly the anomaly is Tron Ali and that's never going to happen again it's also never going

[37:08] to happen again because Stern would just make a premium of Tron and all of a sudden there is no

[37:12] there's no point in even entertaining Tron that $12,000 $10,000 $11,000 so that's just not going to happen

[37:21] again so let's all brace ourselves for what I think is going to be one of the hardest to gauge

[37:34] economic years for Pimbal machines I don't know I really don't know what's going to happen

[37:42] there's a lot of machines out there there's a lot more supply than demand happening than ever before

[37:49] and there's if you can't afford 10 grand or 8 grand or 7 grand or 6 grand I mean there's just a

[37:55] ton of pins that are cost 5 grand 4 grand 3 grand 2 grand so it's it's going to be interesting to see

[38:02] where it all nets out

[38:06] blade

[38:27] I'm going to congratulate all of the game of thrones premium buyers

[38:34] that are finally getting their pins and unboxing them. It's been a long wait for them.

[38:41] They've watched a lot of the LEDs get delivered and I know they've really been anticipating

[38:46] this. So it's cool to see those unboxings happening this week. And now that we have

[38:52] all three variations of Game of Thrones out there, we have the Pro, we have the Premium,

[38:58] the LED. It's complete. There's probably some code updates to happen and some tweaks

[39:05] here and there. But Game of Thrones is another very successful title by Stern. And it

[39:12] overcame an initial sort of backlash by the community because of the artwork. I've

[39:19] gone on record by saying I'm still not a fan of that artwork at all. I don't feel like

[39:24] I'm part of the Game of Thrones world when I look down at that pin. I don't care how

[39:29] good it shoots. I don't care how great the flow is. I don't care what the code is. I just

[39:35] couldn't own one because of that reason and that reason alone. Maybe my mine will be

[39:39] changed. I'm going down to New Orleans to hang out with Tiger Law for Marty Graal on the

[39:44] Super Bowl. And I think he might have a machine there and an LE that's going to be blinged

[39:49] out that I can play and let's see if it changes my mind. But having seen the premiums

[39:56] and then being delivered and the LEs, I have to say my favorite is the LE art package.

[40:04] I didn't think it would be when we were seeing the renders of it and the coloring and we

[40:11] all sort of complained together and then they changed it. It seemed like the winter theme

[40:17] was going to be the winner. It's still nice. It's still nice. I just think that the colors

[40:24] on the LE tied together better for me and just sort of popped more and I feel like they're

[40:30] more striking in their execution than the winter theme. And there's just so much blue

[40:40] on the play field. I know Stern listened to feedback and they made the only changes

[40:45] they could. But I just don't look down at that blue play field and feel like I'm in

[40:50] this sort of winter fantasy world. It looks like I'm looking at the ocean and the sea

[40:59] versus winter. So they did the best they could. They really were definitely putting lipstick

[41:06] on a pig with all of these art options. But it is what it is. The game seems to be

[41:18] blowing people away in terms of its fun factor. Is that really all that matters? If you don't

[41:26] like the way it looks, you don't have to get one. But if you love the flow and you love

[41:31] Richie's design and you're having a blast and then I'm glad I'm glad you're enjoying

[41:37] it. I'm just glad when people can get a pinball machine shipped to them and they get to play

[41:43] and actually have a freaking opinion about it. And they can enjoy it and they can go sell it

[41:48] if they don't like it or they can keep it in their collection. That's how it should be.

[41:51] Stern threads are all about our reaction to the plane the machine where everyone else's

[41:57] threads lately just seem to be about the constant speculating on when the hell is coming

[42:02] out. And so Kudos to Stern for getting Game of Thrones premium out the door.

[42:07] And there's one thing about the art package that I've seen interesting people talk about

[42:11] is the backlash. And I do like Kully C's backlash the best. I don't, they're sending about

[42:20] the the Necromancer, the Ice King who's got that sort of Rob Zombie his arms out. It's

[42:27] just something unflattering about that. I don't know what it is. It's just the guys, it's

[42:32] just kind of like an awkward translate. But there might be a saw for that, right? That

[42:39] I think a lot of people are excited about. And you know, I want to give a call out to

[42:46] Tinsider T800 is has has I don't know the guys have seen this but he's hand drawn.

[42:55] A Game of Thrones backlash that is just absolutely stunning. This I mean this is Pimbal art.

[43:06] You guys need to if you haven't seen it, check it out. T-800 is from St Paul, Minnesota,

[43:17] and it's just incredible what he's doing. And this is what I wanted to see from from

[43:25] from Ali and when we talk about hand drawing artwork and and and and bringing real art

[43:32] onto a Pimbal machine. But here, do people not realize there is no way you're really going

[43:41] to be able to buy this guy's translate from him. The second he offers is for sale. Stern

[43:50] is going to slap this guy with a cease and to cis immediately. Why do you think oric

[43:56] stop selling his AC DC translate because Stern pays a lot of money for the IP and they're

[44:10] not going to just let someone profit off of what they're spending a ton of money on.

[44:14] And I don't know the way around it because like I would love to have this stuff out there.

[44:23] But I think it's very unlikely that this guy is going to be able to sell these things

[44:27] to people and and and do it legitimately. I mean it's going to have to be under the table.

[44:34] But premiums out there something I'm noticing though with with just Game of Thrones threads

[44:40] and and this just speaks to the issues with buying new and boxed Stern besides the lack

[44:48] of code that normally happens. Game of Thrones seems like the code is much further along

[44:55] which people are happy about. But I'm seeing so many issues with people having to fix their

[45:03] pins like like physically work on them to get things right. I'm seeing people having

[45:11] their work on orbit issues or seems to be issues with the throne and some issues with

[45:18] with some up kicks. And look there are definitely some tweaks that we sometimes have to make

[45:26] to games. But some of these fixes are requiring people to lift off the upper play field to

[45:34] do stuff. And these aren't things that the casual collector is going to want to have to do on

[45:43] such an expensive toy that they just buy. So I think this is another really thing of concern

[45:50] when it comes to Stern quality. And if they're going to charge these prices then I don't want to

[45:56] have to be taking screwdriver to new pin and bending things or fixing things or adding screws

[46:05] or removing screws or moving things around to get it to play right. I'm sorry for this

[46:13] amount of money there should be enough R&D going on to avoid this. And that leads me to like my

[46:21] ridiculous item tonight which is someone got the Game of Thrones topper and notice that and I'm

[46:32] not making this up that the topper code isn't working properly. I mean so the way it's supposed to

[46:41] work is that the topper has a big dragon on it and that dragon's supposed to flap its wings

[46:47] as the dragon on the play field flaps to wings so it's like synced up right. Well apparently

[46:53] that synchronization is not working properly because the topper does not sync up with the

[47:01] current code and they have to wait for the next update for it to work together. So not only can

[47:06] Stern not get the code right on the pinball machine but they can't get the code right to work with

[47:10] the toppers either. So why then are you selling them until it works right? I just think it's so

[47:20] oh it's so annoying that they're asking people to spend money on things when they pull it out of

[47:26] the box they plug it in and it doesn't work right. We have to wait for an update it just defeats

[47:33] the point of buying any of these things. Yeah you know I got my Lord of the Rings and it already had

[47:42] finished code everything worked and I spent less money than people are spending on these brand

[47:48] new pins that they're always waiting for things to work properly. So why buy a Game of Thrones

[47:55] new in box if there might be mechanical things if the fix if you have to wait a long time for code?

[48:01] I don't know this new in box debate is never going to end as long as as long as I open up new in

[48:06] box threads and I see people having to like work on games and wait for code it just seems to just

[48:13] keeps it just keeps reinforcing for me and for most people out there just wait wait until the pin is

[48:21] like finished done everything's been like ironed out and then go get one probably for cheaper than

[48:29] you'll have to get one for. So I'm going to end tonight's podcast with a nugget to chew on about

[48:43] pre-orders and pre-orders seem to be the the hot thing that people were doing in the last couple

[48:54] years and most of them have done nothing but burn us and so the word is the word pre-order is

[49:02] it's tainted and rightfully so and we're all skeptical of it and look some people can pre-order

[49:10] a pinball machine and drop the money down and not worry about it that it's it's it's literally like

[49:15] they're just excess cash to burn and other people you know they freeze their money and I think I think

[49:21] they actually miss those resources and those funds and they actually could be tying that money

[49:29] up in a better a better place so I want you guys to all think about this last thing

[49:39] and this is just again it's a hypothetical but it's also like a reality of of if you put your money

[49:46] here this is what happened if you put your money here this is what would happen and I know this is

[49:51] like so this is all in hindsight so don't complain don't yell at me but this just goes to show

[49:58] the reality of investing in pinball and if you consider pinball to be an investment

[50:05] so in this on December 15th 2012 Jersey Jack pinball accepted pre-orders for the hobbit

[50:14] but some people went all in and fully pre-order their hobbit at $7,500

[50:25] those people have had their money locked up with JJP for let's see now over three years

[50:33] and I see a lot of them still boasting that well I'm going to get my hobbit cheaper than you are

[50:39] and I've saved myself a thousand dollars okay if you took that $7,500

[50:53] on December 15th 2012 and you bought netflix stock on that exact day

[51:02] do you know how much money you would have today today at today's market closed for netflix

[51:12] your $7,500 would be worth $56,440 and 38 cents think about that and the market's been going down

[51:29] recently if you had invested that on December 15th 2012 and got out when the market was higher

[51:41] just a few months ago on November 30th your $7,500 would have been worth $75,536 on November 30th 2015

[51:55] so guys look putting money in a pinball machine is never a great investment

[52:05] it is a toy it is a toy meant to have fun is a toy that we enjoy and I'm not saying you shouldn't

[52:16] pre-order a machine but let's stop thinking these things are investments and let's stop just

[52:24] to fine stop just to find what we're saving on a pre-order from what people are going to have to

[52:32] pay for MSRP when you save good congratulations you saved yourself $500 or $1500 but look you could have

[52:42] made yourself $70,000 if you put that money somewhere else again all hindsight but just a proof

[52:50] of a point there's better places to put our money than pinball but we put it into pinball for one reason

[52:56] because we love it and nothing else brings you know the satisfaction like it for many of us

[53:05] so I want to thank you guys listen to episode 6 I'm going to really try and get the Skype going and

[53:14] and get some guests on here I know that'll make this show more dynamic and I'm going to work on it

[53:19] I've got a customer service call into call burner to see what happened and I'll get this all ironed

[53:26] out and we'll keep going and I see if I do a show from the road but I just might be working too

[53:33] hard so look for something probably over the weekend if you have any feedback I would love to

[53:39] hear from you guys just send me an email at canada pinball at gmail.com that's k-a-n-e-d-a pinball

[53:49] at gmail.com but if you disagree with anything on this podcast just shoot me a note and I'll

[53:55] happily read your response and and and all the the names you call me or all the things you agree

[54:00] or disagree with but I want to give you guys as much airtime as you want in terms of discussing this

[54:07] so that's it guys episode 6 thanks for tuning in and I'll talk to you real soon bye bye

[54:14] so how's magic girl coming? very good I mean it's a lot of work people ask

[54:20] you know when you're going to be done and it's pinball is a lot of hand work a lot of hand building

[54:25] and a lot of just detail oriented things especially when you get off of paper and you start

[54:31] building metal parts wood parts plastic parts and getting it all together it's endless work so

[54:36] we're on it seven days a week 20 hours a day
