[00:00] This is gonna be Knai-tis Thanksgiving special.

[00:02] I'm gonna say something thankful about every single pinball company out there.

[00:06] I can do it. I can do it. Knai can be very positive.

[00:09] And this is the song that I bet every single pinball manufacturer is like playing and dancing

[00:15] when they see that there's a new episode of Knai-tis pinball podcasts coming out to the world.

[00:19] Picture Jack Gwinnari, David Fix, George Gomez, Gary Stern, Mr. Ryan White, all of them, Charlie Emory and Bug.

[00:27] They're all dancing when they hear that Knai-tis pinball podcast.

[00:30] Has a Thanksgiving special in which he's gonna say something nice about each of their companies.

[00:35] Here we go.

[00:36] Oh yeah.

[00:45] Six-twippy coming right here. Hit it.

[00:50] Yeah. Jack loves me.

[00:56] J.J.P. Biggest fan. Let's do this.

[01:12] Wow, that was an intro. Happy Thanksgiving week, everybody.

[01:16] I'm your host, Knai-tis pinball podcast.

[01:18] The world's only pinball podcast that just tells it like it is.

[01:21] And I'm super thankful to be here.

[01:23] I'm thankful for my beautiful wife, my beautiful child.

[01:27] I'm thankful for every single day.

[01:29] I'm above ground and I get to hang out with what I think is arguably one of the weirdest, one of the most niche,

[01:36] one of the most interesting hobbies in the entire world.

[01:40] And that is pinball and I mean it.

[01:42] And on this episode, I am gonna go through all of the manufacturers and say what I am thankful for

[01:48] with each and every one of them.

[01:50] And I mean it. There is stuff that each of these companies is bringing into the pinball world

[01:55] that we should all be thankful for.

[01:57] I know I can be the one who's always the bearer of bad news.

[02:01] I can be the one who harps on about the lack of toys in a game

[02:05] or the extreme prices from these machines

[02:08] and the ridiculous nature of the hobby at times.

[02:11] But for the most part, if you're listening to Knai-tis pinball podcasts right now,

[02:15] we each have a lot more to be thankful for in life.

[02:18] And if you're not thankful for what you have in life, just change your perspective.

[02:22] There are so many people out there with a lot less than us.

[02:26] And if we're buying pinball machines, trust me,

[02:28] we're in a much better position than most people on the planet.

[02:32] So here's what I wanna do first.

[02:34] I wanna give a shout out to each and every one of you who contributes to Knai-tis pinball podcasts.

[02:39] Now I wanna do a little bit extra for those who give a little bit extra.

[02:44] And so I wanna give a personal shout out.

[02:46] And these are people who donate more than $10 a month to Knai-tis pinball podcasts.

[02:52] I wanna give a shout out to Tony Vee, to Steve J, to Hans T, to Jordan M,

[02:59] Jason C, Dan J, arcade time, and an extra special shout out to my number one monthly contributor,

[03:09] Mr. Donald over at Oasis Arcade.

[03:13] It means so much to me and it means so much that all of you,

[03:16] I know that every single month when that Knai-tis bill comes,

[03:20] you're asking yourself, is it worth it?

[03:22] And I'm happy you're still on board the ride.

[03:24] We have 528 club members.

[03:28] I was looking through my Knai-tis Facebook post like over the last year

[03:31] and it's so exciting.

[03:32] I used to celebrate when we got to 250 club members.

[03:36] Then we were at 300 and I'm so happy we got to this place.

[03:40] And you know my goal, it's still to get to 1000 club members.

[03:43] The other people I wanna thank are those who are super generous

[03:47] during my Facebook lives.

[03:49] And those are the people that give me stars like Week in and Week out.

[03:53] Number one on that list is Mr. Pete Rose and Pete Eercrazy,

[03:56] Donald Hopkins, Jason Cummins, Thomas Roth, Anthony,

[04:01] you know who you are, Hector, Bill Brandis, Robert L, Dave Sanders,

[04:05] Brian Cos always coming at me with the 10 stars.

[04:08] Thank you so much for tuning in every week.

[04:11] And for all of you out there who tune in to Knai-tis Facebook live,

[04:14] I mean it, thank you.

[04:16] We have 2.6,000 followers on Facebook.

[04:20] And that's a lot when you think about it.

[04:22] A successful pinball company is selling about like two to 3,000 games

[04:27] a year of a title.

[04:28] And the fact that Knai-tis pinball podcast has that many followers

[04:32] is absolutely incredible.

[04:34] And it means we have some.

[04:35] I don't mean a lot.

[04:36] I don't mean a lot.

[04:37] But it means we have some influence in this hobby.

[04:40] All right, and I just have a few more personal thank yous because these people

[04:43] again have just gone above and beyond.

[04:45] I want to thank Mr. Robert Mooney for storing my Fixed Felix, Junior,

[04:50] all of these years and breaking the monitor and fixing it.

[04:54] And also for his stars contributions.

[04:56] And then an extra special thank you to a man who every time there's

[05:01] like a milestone moment in my world,

[05:04] whether it's a good thing like Brenda's birthday or something like a

[05:08] meta layoff, this man always swoops in and that's Mr. Kim Mitchell.

[05:13] And it's always so funny because Brenda will be like Chris.

[05:16] You have no idea what Kim Mitchell just did for us.

[05:18] And I'm like, you got to be kidding me.

[05:20] So Kim, thank you so much.

[05:22] We really, really do appreciate it.

[05:24] And I also want to give a shout out to Derek.

[05:27] He's always bashful when I give him a shout out.

[05:29] But Derek, you know him as the ultimate JJP fanboy and apologist

[05:33] and the guy who drives the Porsche and only can contribute $5 a month

[05:37] to get eight as big ball podcasts.

[05:38] But I've really made one of the greatest friendships of my life.

[05:42] And I'm always telling Brenda this.

[05:43] It's a sign of a true friend when someone actually picks up the phone

[05:47] when you call them like almost none of my friends pick up the phone.

[05:51] But Derek always picks up the phone and he's probably tired of hearing

[05:55] me on this podcast.

[05:56] And then he gets an earful of me almost every night on my walk home.

[05:59] But Derek, I love you.

[06:00] Thank you so much for being a great friend.

[06:02] All right.

[06:03] So here's what we're going to do.

[06:04] I'm going to go down the list of pinball manufacturers and I'm going to

[06:07] say what I am thankful for for each and every one of these companies.

[06:11] Okay.

[06:11] Now first before I do this, I want to say something real quickly that's not

[06:14] going to be a positive.

[06:15] And I just heard from one distributor who's a big distributor.

[06:19] And here's what they said.

[06:21] They said that that photo of cactus Canyon L.E.

[06:24] You know the one that Chicago gaming company shared with a bunch of games

[06:27] with toppers on top of them and then some games in boxes.

[06:31] I am hearing that that photo was somewhat staged.

[06:35] And what I mean by this is that production hasn't really fully begun on

[06:40] cactus Canyon L.E.

[06:42] Now look, I don't know if this is true or not.

[06:44] But let me ask each and every one of you a question.

[06:47] How many times in the pinball hobby have we received a photo when companies

[06:52] want to proclaim that production has begun and then they share a photo in

[06:56] which what don't we see?

[06:58] We don't see an assembly line.

[07:00] We don't see many people in the photo.

[07:02] And so is this another example of a company trickling out a few games and

[07:08] staging a production photo that isn't actually a production line in motion.

[07:14] I'm going to let you decide.

[07:16] So we will see how many cactus Canyon L.E.

[07:18] is get unboxed between now and the end of the year.

[07:21] But I don't think you're going to see like 30 or 40 or 50 games going out a

[07:26] week.

[07:26] So we shall see if this is another example of a stage production.

[07:31] All right.

[07:31] So let's start with stern pinball.

[07:33] So what am I thankful about when it comes to stern pinball?

[07:36] Well, look, it's real simple.

[07:38] I'm very thankful for George Gomez.

[07:40] I'm very thankful for the entire team over at stern pinball.

[07:44] I mean it without stern pinball.

[07:45] This hobby would absolutely be a trotious and we saw what happened in pinball

[07:50] over 2022 when stern pinball took a break from new inbox releases.

[07:55] We saw what happens to this hobby when this company takes a pause.

[07:59] The entire industry almost like collapses because nobody else does anything.

[08:04] Stern is the center of gravity for all of pinball.

[08:07] Stern is pinball.

[08:09] I think that's the fairest way to say it.

[08:11] Stern pinball is pinball.

[08:13] Everybody else is kind of like a boutique company trying to do what Stern does.

[08:19] So effectively, I'm very thankful for Stern's design team.

[08:23] I think they have the best designers.

[08:25] I think they have the best coders.

[08:26] I think they have the best artist in all of pinball.

[08:29] We've almost been so spoiled that Stern has released so many great games over the last ten years

[08:35] that when a new game comes out, the reason why we're sort of hyper critical

[08:39] is we're comparing them to other games Stern has delivered for much cheaper prices.

[08:44] Arguably, but this company, if you were to say all the pinball stops tomorrow,

[08:48] Stern pinball would absolutely have more games in the top 50 machines

[08:54] than Bali Williams than anybody else.

[08:58] And they have consistently year in and year out delivered the best themes,

[09:03] the best code, the best gameplay, the best flow they have.

[09:08] And this company is pinball.

[09:10] And I look forward to seeing what Stern does in the future.

[09:14] And I'm very thankful that Stern is still around and is upping their production

[09:18] facility by 50 percent.

[09:20] They're moving into a new facility.

[09:22] And that means we're only going to get more games from Stern pinball as we go into the future.

[09:28] And I look forward to being the pinball podcaster that praises and critiques everything they do.

[09:34] Without them, Canadian pinball podcast would be real boring.

[09:38] I mean it.

[09:39] I need Stern pinball to have a better show.

[09:42] So thank you Stern for keeping Canadian employed in his podcast arena.

[09:47] Let's go on to spooky pinball.

[09:49] How am I thankful for spooky pinball?

[09:51] Well, I'm very thankful for spooky pinball.

[09:53] And the thing I'm very thankful for when it comes to spooky pinball is a few things.

[09:58] I am very thankful that they are the one boutique company that did it right.

[10:03] I think they showed everybody else out there how you do boutique pinball.

[10:08] We've seen many companies come and go and none of them realized what spooky realized early on.

[10:14] To throw your hat into the pinball ring, you need to start small.

[10:18] You need to learn how to do it.

[10:21] You need to manage your own ability before you can manage customer expectations.

[10:26] Right.

[10:26] We saw deep root be like we're going to make more pinball machines and everybody in a single year.

[10:31] Spooky pinball started with America's most honoured.

[10:34] They made 150.

[10:36] Their next game was like 300, then 500, then 750.

[10:41] And now they are making 1250 games in an 18 month period.

[10:47] I'm very thankful that spooky pinball is still the most transparent pinball company on the planet.

[10:53] Let me repeat that.

[10:54] This company is the most transparent company on the planet.

[10:59] One of the reasons why is they use hot glue guns and glue is transparent.

[11:02] No, I'm just joking.

[11:03] But now, but this company from day one has always been very honest and truthful about how many games they can make a week

[11:11] when you can expect your game and everything they've done.

[11:15] Even from the non-refundable deposits, they've always been very upfront with us about how it's going to work.

[11:22] And every single person who's ever ordered a spooky game got their game.

[11:27] There was no shenanigans, there was no like year long delay.

[11:31] They got you your game when they said they would get you your game.

[11:36] So I'm very thankful for spooky.

[11:38] I'm also thankful for spooky pinball because they will tackle themes that nobody else would.

[11:43] Their company is called spooky and I like that we have this sort of niche pinball company that brings out obscure themes and like little niche themes like Ultraman when nobody else would.

[11:54] They caught lightning in a bottle with Rick and Morty, arguably one of the craziest themes that everybody overlooked.

[12:01] I'm thankful they got that game and they were successful with it.

[12:04] And I really look forward to Scooby Doo and seeing what this team can do in the future.

[12:09] And I'm thankful you deliver every single year new pinball for the pinball community.

[12:14] Alright, let's go to Jersey Jack pinball.

[12:16] So why am I thankful for JJP?

[12:18] Well, look, when I'm talking about these companies, when I look at a company like JJP and I look at this logo,

[12:24] I'm very thankful that Jersey Jack pinball is in pinball.

[12:27] I'm very thankful that Jack Winari threw his hat into the ring and competed with a company he used to sell and that is Stern pinball.

[12:35] Because I truly believe that JJP since its inception has been on a mission to put as much as they can into pinball.

[12:45] I believe this company and I'm thankful for this company because they pushed pinball innovation.

[12:50] You need to go back and look at what Stern machines looked like before JJP came out.

[12:56] I'm very thankful that Jersey Jack pinball is here.

[12:59] I have one pinball machine that I own on planet earth and it is guns and roses.

[13:04] And it is a masterpiece and I'm very thankful that Jersey Jack pinball got that license and made that game.

[13:12] I'm very thankful that Jersey Jack pinball has built a following and a community and has given us all of the pins they've given us.

[13:20] They've released seven pinball machines in the pinball landscape.

[13:25] I'm very thankful for those options.

[13:27] I think these games are really unique.

[13:30] I think they're really interesting and even though all of them aren't my cup of tea.

[13:35] I think about how boring pinball would be if we didn't have JJP and up until the recent game.

[13:41] I mean it when I say this up until the recent game.

[13:44] I'm going to keep it positive and not mention what the game is up until the recent release.

[13:50] Deep down each and every one of us knows that the most exciting time of a pinball year is when Jersey Jack pinball shows us

[13:59] their new game because there's just something special knowing that this company is laser focused on just one machine.

[14:08] And they put everything they know to date in each and every game and then they release the games with these great release videos.

[14:15] And it's a moment and I think we're going to get back to another moment with the next title.

[14:19] I think everyone's excited to see what Eric does next and I'm very very thankful for guys like Keith and guys like Eric and guys like Jack and guys like Leonard.

[14:29] And Brett and people who just keep this pinball hobby going and don't let this company go under.

[14:35] I mean it. There have been so many chances this company could have gone under and I want to give an extra special thank you to the Abbas family

[14:43] because they don't need to be here. They don't need to make money in pinball and they deserve some thanks because this is a labor of love.

[14:51] It is a passion project for them.

[14:54] If it wasn't for the Abbas family, this company would have gone under during the Hobbit.

[15:00] There would have been nothing after the Hobbit.

[15:03] So thank you Leonard and Brett.

[15:05] You can adopt me as your child any day and I will happily change my name to Abbas and we can roll this planet as billionaires.

[15:14] But no, thank you guys for being a part of the pinball community.

[15:16] Alright, so what am I thankful for with Chicago gaming company?

[15:19] Well look, CGC, what can you say? I mean look.

[15:22] We have to be absolutely thankful that this company remade some of the greatest pinball machines of all time and they made each version of those games even better.

[15:33] It's really hard to improve upon a classic and they have done it time and time again.

[15:40] So I am so thankful that CGC has remade those games, open up the opportunity for far more people to enjoy those games and also this.

[15:51] This company builds the best quality pinball machines in all of pinball.

[15:56] When CGC ships a game, you don't have endless threads about quality control issues.

[16:03] You wait a long time but they make the wait worth it.

[16:07] So thank you to everybody over at CGC and I just can't wait to get more from you guys.

[16:14] I was like stop making us wait so long for stuff and please I hope that's not a stage production photo of Cactus Canyon Ellie.

[16:22] I also wanted to say thank you to Doug who runs CGC because Doug has kept the prices low and I mean it and that is something that really deserves a thank you and a praise.

[16:33] They could have easily have been very greedy and charged thousands more for Cactus Canyon Ellie and they didn't and they wanted to give the value to us.

[16:44] So thank you so much to everybody at CGC for keeping the prices at a fair point for the community.

[16:53] We really appreciate it.

[16:54] Alright what am I thankful for over at American pinball everybody's favorite mustache and pinball Mr. David fix Mr. Dennis Norman and Mr. Christopher Franchier over there working hard on a new game that I hear is going to be really interesting.

[17:11] So look I am thankful that American pinball is another company that sort of came out of nowhere.

[17:17] We didn't expect this company to be anything.

[17:19] John Papadu can launched it with them and I am very thankful that American pinball is around and I'm going to be very honest here.

[17:26] American pinball has the potential they make great quality games.

[17:30] They also know how to pack a pinball machine with a lot of fun toys right they've done it with Houdini they did it with October fest and I think this company I'm very thankful they're around.

[17:41] I'm very thankful because I think American pinball is in a great position to deliver an original IP game that is going to be packed and give us great value in pinball.

[17:52] You know I'm also very thankful that American pinball is going to give a shot to a lot of these home brew guys and is actually going to think differently about pinball right.

[18:01] Stern and Jersey Jack they're going to fight over all the big IPs but it's nice that this company is actually going to give like home brew guys like Ryan McQuade who made this.

[18:11] It's a big risk. Absolutely is a big risk. They know this but I am very thankful that we have a company that's just doing it differently and we will see if they can hit the bulls eye with an original IP game that's loaded that looks amazing.

[18:30] I think the pinball buyers are going to show up also because the IP games are costing a fortune so it gives them a golden opportunity to sort of deliver game at the right price so I'm super thankful for David and everyone over at American pinball we got a lot more to go so I'm going to keep going so p3 multi more pick look I am thankful that Jerry is still kicking it because look Jerry invented the p rock and without Jerry's p rock system we wouldn't have a lot of what's been in pinball over the years he's really been the.

[18:59] In the engine that's fueled a lot of games that we've loved he's fueled the home brew area of pinball and that's just amazing right as Jerry gave all of these dreamers a chance to make their pinball machine so I'm super thankful that Jerry is in this hobby I'm I look I'm thankful that we have multi more big p3 like I am like I'm absolutely thankful that he's given people a platform to design and create their own vision of pinball and I think he's very very on the precipice now right weird how has been successful for him and if you can just get.

[19:29] Get these games made Jerry got to hire some more workers but look it's shown that people are attracted to this platform if the right license makes its way onto the platform I'm just super thankful that Jerry's been in pinball and he has fueled so much of the boutique industry that all of us love now speaking of fueling the boutique industry and p rock Dutch pinball right Dutch pinball is big Lebowski if I'm not wrong runs off of Jerry's system so that's great we wouldn't have the big

[19:59] Lebowski if it wasn't for Jerry over at p3 multi more bigger multi more big p3 I always say it wrong but look I'm very thankful for Dutch pinball for again sticking it out they're getting it done and you know how I feel about Barry I think

[20:14] Barry is one of the most creative minds in pinball history and yes I'm saying that after just one machine because it is the greatest

[20:23] theme integrated pinball machine since I've been covering pinball I'm super thankful Barry is still in this hobby I'm super thankful he's getting it done and I really look forward to seeing what's next from Dutch pinball this is going to be the hardest one and I said I was going to say thanks to everybody the next on my list is home pin so what am I thankful about when it comes to home

[20:44] bit let me think about this one for a minute I'll say this I'm thankful that home pin is around because I think what they do is every few years they make it easy for us to keep

[21:00] our money in our wall it's I can't do it I can't do it I can't say something thankful about home but I just can't do it you can't make me do it

[21:06] everyone else is going to get a nice comment but after thunderbirds and spinal tap I just I can't find anything I'm looking at this

[21:15] porous Thai can game they may I just can't do it can it is moving on let's go on to the pinball brothers what am I thankful about when it comes to the

[21:23] pinball brothers look I'm happy these guys picked up the baton that Andrew highway dropped like Andrew highway burned so many people and the people he burned the most

[21:34] where the pinball brothers they lost so much money on Andrew highway and instead of declaring bankruptcy and walking away I'm thankful they didn't do that and I'm thankful they're now making

[21:47] alien games there at least giving people who would have lost everything a chance to get an alien and salvage something out of the raw deal that

[21:55] Andrew gave them and I think these guys are going to learn a lot right I still think Queen pinball is a leftover game from the

[22:02] Andrew highway period I think there are designers out there and artists out there and coders out there that would happily work with these guys I'm

[22:11] bringing great pinball to market so I do want to thank the pinball brothers for not calling it quits and getting everybody who was in

[22:19] on alien a chance to finally own that game haggis pinball what am I thankful about when it comes to haggis pinball well this one's easy I'm just

[22:29] thankful that these guys build what I think is probably one of the most beautiful and detail oriented machines if you lift the hood on a

[22:38] haggis pinball machine it embarrasses everybody else's machines I mean it is absolutely a work of art I think Damien and the team over

[22:47] there deserve a lot of credit and a lot of thanks for the beautiful product they are putting together it's taking them a long

[22:53] time to put it together they're not being very transparent about it but when they do get a game to a customer I think people are going to be

[23:01] very very satisfied and thankful with what they're bringing to market I'm also thankful that they're making these games over there in

[23:09] Australia because for the Australian buyers it's nice that we finally have a company over there because they don't have to pay the

[23:16] crazy import taxes on games and they can buy from a local supplier and a local manufacturer and that is haggis pinball so Damien and Marty I give you guys

[23:28] probably more arrows than anybody I would say that most of them you deserve but I am thankful you're around and I hope each and every

[23:36] one of you at all of these pinball companies has a very very healthy and happy Thanksgiving with each and every one of your

[23:43] families and I mean it when I say it it's really easy for me to get up on the mic and critique these companies insult their bonehead it moves and

[23:52] forget that almost all of these people that I critique on a weekly basis most of them they have wives they have children their family

[24:02] men they have a lot else going on in life and then they got to hear this blow hard in New York City insulting them for

[24:09] trying really hard to make pinball machines and I can't imagine and I get it and I want them to know that while I enjoy doing my show and it is

[24:19] entertaining calling all of these companies out because I do believe they make many bonehead it moves I want to let each and every one of you know

[24:26] that on a personal level I do wish each and every one of you the best I do want each and every one of you to be around many many years to

[24:34] come so we can see what you have up your sleeves in the pinball world I mean it and if I see each and every one of you at a show the words will never be an

[24:44] anger we will shake hands and have beers and have a great time and that is why this hobby is great but I'm not done with my thanks just yet I want to say thank you to

[24:54] NAPS Arcade and given extra special shout out to Jason nap who has now arguably the greatest source for pinball news in all of pinball every single day

[25:06] I'm at work I get like emails all day long new post from NAPS Arcade and it's not like it's spam like it's actual news that he is covering in real

[25:16] time and I want to take my hat off to Jason nap because without you Jason and without your site we would have to plow through the dumpster fire that is

[25:26] PINSIDE to find out what is happening in the pinball world so thank you so much Jason for all of the hard work you do we really

[25:35] appreciate it and I love your site I want to give a special thank you to all of the distributors and dealers out there many of

[25:43] which are my good friends all of us out there if you're listening right now all of us out there have a good friend who is also making a living in pinball and I want to thank each and every one of you who

[25:55] distributes and deals these machines it's not always easy even though you've had it really easy for so many years now it's going to get a little bit more

[26:03] difficult but I want to say thank you so much on a personal level I've made some incredible friendships with people in this area of pinball

[26:11] Chris and Melissa you know Joe Newhart tady tucky these are very very dear and close friends of mine and thank you so much for all the pinball hookups and it pains me that I can't flip your machines for a profit in the future but no thank you so much to each and every

[26:28] one of the dealers and distors that are out there I want to give a very special thank you to all the barcades out there all the jack bars of the world if you're operating pinball out in the world or

[26:39] at an Airbnb wherever it is if you're putting pinball in the world for people to walk in and enjoy thank you very much it really is the way pinball was meant to be played I mean it when I say it is how we were

[26:54] supposed to play pinball you take 20 bucks you order some beers you have some fun and you go home you weren't meant to spend the price of a car and be some lonely man down in your

[27:05] basement with nobody watching you play that isn't what pinball was intended to do or how it was meant to be played okay I get it you can dive into the code when you're in your

[27:16] pajamas at three in the morning but that's not what pinball was supposed to be in culture or in the world so thank you to all of you operators out there I can't wait to

[27:26] visit more of you and I have such a good time every time I go to jack bar and it always reminds me this is pinball it was always meant to be a social magnetic device that was out there in public that brought people

[27:40] together I want to end this podcast by saying thank you to all and I mean this all of the pinball content creators out there each and every one of you who

[27:50] either does a podcast or does a stream there are so many out there and we know this there are so many people out there that simply because they love pinball they're taking time away from their careers from their families to make

[28:06] content for us to enjoy and celebrate this incredible hobby thank you to each and every one of you I mean it I mean I know we get competitive during the

[28:16] twippy as well just me and francey but I mean it when I say this that like each and every one of you you are providing a great value and a service to this hobby and it's not easy right there are so many people who don't

[28:29] understand how hard it is to put a microphone in front of you in a hobby in which there is only true news five days out of the year right there's only five new games a year

[28:42] and you've got to fill the airwaves on a weekly basis on a product like this that barely has any news a year it is difficult to do it requires a unique kind of personality but luckily for us there are a lot of really awesome

[28:59] personalities and pinball and I want to say thank you to each and every one of you for doing it on a monthly basis on a weekly basis on a daily basis I'm very thankful to be amongst all of you
