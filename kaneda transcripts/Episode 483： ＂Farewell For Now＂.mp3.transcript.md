[00:00] And weeks pass, and months pass, seasons fly.

[00:09] Still, you don't walk through the door.

[00:17] And in our days, I count the silent days.

[00:27] Until I hear you sing once more.

[00:33] Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing.

[00:37] All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's going to be a while

[00:40] until you hear Canatus Pimbal podcast sing again.

[00:44] I'm taking a break.

[00:45] I'm going to put it.

[00:46] This is just going to be a tiny little episode in which

[00:49] I announced to the world that this show is going on a hiatus.

[00:53] It is a combination of everything you're probably

[00:56] thinking, a combination of living in New York City,

[01:00] cabin fever is getting to me.

[01:01] I need to focus on work more than anything else.

[01:04] And I'm so sick of reading the negativity on Pinside.

[01:07] It's a combination of there is no news in Pimbal.

[01:10] Everyone's just manufacturing news.

[01:12] Some people are saying I'm manufacturing the news.

[01:14] But there's just not a lot to cover.

[01:16] And it's not really interesting for me.

[01:18] And I'm not really excited to sort of look out

[01:21] at the Pimbal landscape.

[01:22] Now we will return when there's a reason to return.

[01:25] So I'm telling you that right now.

[01:26] I'm not going to go all Nate Chivers on you guys.

[01:29] So there's that part of it.

[01:30] The other thing is, I just want to clarify a few things.

[01:33] When I interviewed Robert Mueller, I saw some guy

[01:35] Dakota Mike saying, he knew how this interview happened.

[01:38] I interviewed Robert Mueller and I put the interview up

[01:40] right away.

[01:41] There was no permission that Robert had

[01:43] to give me to air the interview.

[01:45] And I did not hold back on asking Robert anything I wanted

[01:49] to ask him.

[01:50] And I treated him with respect.

[01:51] Because that's what I do when I interview people.

[01:53] So let's just put that stupid thing to bed.

[01:56] For those of you in on Rick and Morty, just be patient.

[01:59] And I think they're going to do everything they can

[02:01] to make these games play as great as they can from the factory.

[02:05] There might be some design issues that probably should have

[02:08] been caught in the whitewood stage.

[02:10] But it is what it is.

[02:11] Welcome to the world of Pimbal.

[02:13] People were every single game.

[02:15] I mean, every single game that comes out

[02:18] is always somewhat of a compromise.

[02:21] We just can't have it all.

[02:22] You get great theme, great theme, integration,

[02:25] but the shots are clunky.

[02:26] You get clunky game like Batman 66.

[02:29] And the theme is perfect.

[02:30] And the integration is perfect.

[02:31] I don't know why we just can't get everything put into one

[02:34] package.

[02:35] There's always a compromise in this industry.

[02:38] I got a really nice email from Butch Peele saying,

[02:40] thank you, Chris, for all that you've done.

[02:42] Your shows were amazing.

[02:44] And I didn't think anyone would pay attention

[02:46] to what happened to me.

[02:47] And I want to thank you.

[02:49] And Butch, we love you.

[02:50] We can't wait to see you land somewhere new in the Pimbal

[02:53] industry.

[02:54] And we know you will, but we know you will.

[02:57] Now finally, I think before I exit,

[02:59] before I exit stage door left, I just

[03:02] have to say something.

[03:03] I do find it funny that I'm being called a liar

[03:06] by other Pimbal podcasts.

[03:08] I do find it funny that the other shows out there

[03:11] are doing what they do best.

[03:12] They take what I report on this show.

[03:15] And it becomes the news items for their shows.

[03:17] I'm really happy I've been able to provide so many minutes

[03:20] of commentary to the other Pimbal podcasts

[03:23] out there that are in the world.

[03:25] But let me just say this.

[03:26] And they know who I'm talking about.

[03:27] It's not all of them.

[03:28] But in terms of Canadian being a liar

[03:30] about the Lord of the Rings kit that I announced

[03:33] on my last show.

[03:34] And obviously, since I put up that podcast where I said,

[03:38] Lord of the Rings was coming back,

[03:40] I learned more information and more details.

[03:42] But the fact that people are saying,

[03:44] I'm lying that this thing is going to be for sale for people.

[03:49] I'm sorry.

[03:50] But that's where I draw the line.

[03:52] If you call me a liar and you say,

[03:55] I don't know what I'm talking about,

[03:56] I want you to do me a favor, everybody.

[03:59] I want you to understand that I didn't just wake up one day

[04:02] and have this information.

[04:03] I didn't just wake up one day and report this thing.

[04:06] People came to me with information.

[04:08] And I'm sorry, but I just want to read for you.

[04:10] I want to read for you word for word,

[04:12] what I was told by the person working on this project.

[04:15] You ready?

[04:16] Word for word.

[04:17] This is what I was told.

[04:19] I will give you some details because I don't want to mess

[04:22] with Stern or the other company with wrong information.

[04:25] The guy who is making this project is a pinball fan

[04:29] who has a few machines and has the license

[04:32] to make Lord of the Rings arts for pinball

[04:35] and also for merchandise.

[04:37] He is one of the only guys who can get the license

[04:40] for this thing.

[04:41] All right, so that's what I was told word for word.

[04:44] That this guy has the license and is making this stuff.

[04:47] And here's what's happened since my show aired

[04:50] is that this guy who had all these plans to do all this stuff

[04:54] and sell kits and sell, I think he freaked out.

[04:57] I think he freaked out and I think he was trying to pull

[05:00] like what Orrick did was start track

[05:02] in which he made translates or remember

[05:04] when he made ACDC translates as well.

[05:06] This is a fan project.

[05:08] So it never should have been communicated to me

[05:11] that this was something that was happening

[05:13] with licensing approval.

[05:15] And that's what I was told.

[05:17] So you think I wake up?

[05:18] Do you think I wake up and I make this stuff up?

[05:20] Like I'm trying to mislead people?

[05:23] And I just, I really don't appreciate the tone

[05:26] of some of the other pinball media out there

[05:29] and how they're calling me a liar for this.

[05:31] So here's what I'm gonna do because if you want

[05:34] to approach Canadian pinball podcasts

[05:35] and you want to lie or mislead me

[05:38] and get me to report something incorrectly,

[05:40] I will retract it as I've just done.

[05:43] But you're gonna lose some trust with me

[05:45] and don't come to me with stuff.

[05:46] Like you're coming to the World's Number One Pinball

[05:49] Podcast with information.

[05:51] Make sure you have the information right

[05:52] because there's no way for me to source this stuff.

[05:54] If someone comes to you and this is my question

[05:56] for you out there, if someone comes to you and says,

[05:58] Chris, I'm working on this.

[06:01] Trust me, I've seen the contract.

[06:03] I'm working on it.

[06:04] Here are the plans for this thing.

[06:06] More details that come.

[06:07] Why would you do that if your details aren't even accurate?

[06:11] But maybe they are.

[06:12] And now maybe they're trying, they're trying to spin it

[06:15] and they're trying to back pedal

[06:16] because they don't have permission to do

[06:18] what they thought they were gonna do.

[06:19] If you ask me, I think the gentleman doing this

[06:22] who we heard about on another show

[06:24] is a very wealthy pinball collector

[06:26] who's putting all this effort into making

[06:27] this new Lord of the Rings game for himself.

[06:30] But he totally was not gonna put all that effort into it

[06:33] unless he could monetarily offer the kid out for sale.

[06:36] And I think they realize now that that's not so easy.

[06:39] And here's the thing.

[06:40] You want to burn Canadian with information

[06:42] that's not that accurate or you want to make me a liar.

[06:44] Fine, I'll tell you the truth of what I'm gonna do.

[06:46] I'm gonna share for you the play field.

[06:48] So you can all see it.

[06:49] My nice parting gift to all of you out there.

[06:51] I'm going to upload on Canadian's

[06:54] pinball podcast Facebook page,

[06:56] the image of the Lord of the Rings pinball

[06:59] that they are remaking.

[07:00] All right, so enjoy that, okay?

[07:02] We're gonna be back when there's actually reason

[07:04] to be back on the show.

[07:05] But until then, until then, everybody.

[07:08] Do me a favor, stay healthy, stay safe, do your part.

[07:14] I need to recharge.

[07:15] A lot of us need to recharge.

[07:17] A lot of us are gonna start to go stir crazy.

[07:19] And you know when we come back,

[07:21] we're gonna come back better than ever.

[07:23] There are more than enough pinball podcasts out there

[07:25] for you to enjoy, but I've reached a point where

[07:28] there's just not a lot of interesting stuff to talk about.

[07:31] And I'm not gonna just talk to fill the airwaves, all right?

[07:34] So we'll be back.

[07:35] Who knows how long it will be.

[07:37] But again, thank you so much for all of your support.

[07:41] Thank you so much for tuning in every week.

[07:43] Stay safe and stay healthy, everybody.

[07:45] And before I go, one final rumor for you all to chew on,

[07:49] it wouldn't be Canadian's pinball podcast

[07:50] without actually delivering rumors and news

[07:53] that the other shows will cover.

[07:55] So here, are you ready for it?

[07:56] So my final parting rumor for you

[07:59] to chew on over the next few weeks is this.

[08:01] Dirty Donnie let it slip on another podcast he did

[08:05] that he was working on another pinball project.

[08:08] Now he actually told people the theme that he was working on.

[08:11] And maybe he was drinking, I don't know, probably not.

[08:13] But Dirty Donnie is working on a Robocop pinball machine.

[08:18] Robocop by Dirty Donnie,

[08:20] which leads to a lot of questions of who would make Robocop

[08:24] with Dirty Donnie?

[08:25] Would it be, is that Chicago gaming company's sci-fi theme

[08:29] that Mark Richie's working on?

[08:31] I don't know, Robocop is sci-fi themed in a way.

[08:33] Is it not?

[08:34] Is it for the new Robocop TV show coming out

[08:37] and is it a Stern project he's working on?

[08:39] But you heard it here first on Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[08:42] Dirty Donnie working on Robocop pinball coming straight

[08:46] from the mouth of Dirty Donnie.

[08:47] All you other shows out there, now you've got it.

[08:50] You've got more information from Canada, you're welcome.

[08:53] And now you get all of the Canada listener base.

[08:55] And for all my listeners, you can go now

[08:57] and check and see what all the other shows are about.

[09:00] So everyone, have a great May, we'll be back

[09:03] at some point in the near future, future, far future.

[09:06] Who knows?

[09:07] Who knows?

[09:08] Everybody, have a good day later.

[09:09] I always feel no more than halfway real.

[09:18] Till I hear you sing, once more.
