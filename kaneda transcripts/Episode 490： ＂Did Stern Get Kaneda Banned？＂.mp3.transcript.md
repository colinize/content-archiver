[00:00] Welcome to episode 490 of Canadian Spinball Podcasts in which we're going to talk about

[00:23] what I think is the lamest move I've ever seen in the history of me doing pinball podcasts in all of my time in pinball.

[00:33] And I've had some lame things happen to me in this show, but this by far takes the cake for being the lamest thing ever.

[00:40] And we're going to talk about it right now.

[00:42] So I'm walking down the street in New York City and I get a Facebook message from Greg, Mr. Rare Hero, Colton.

[00:49] And he said, Chris, I wanted to share a link to the show we did together with a friend of mine and Facebook won't let me share the link.

[00:58] It's coming up as a abusive content and it won't let him share the link.

[01:03] And I'm like, what are you talking about? I share links to my show all the time.

[01:06] I've been doing it for over a few years now. What do you mean it's abusive content and it's flagged as not being shareable.

[01:14] So I go and I do it myself and he's right for some reason every single link to every single show I've ever done on Canadian pinball podcasts can no longer be shared.

[01:26] And so the first thing I did was I called up Jared at Stern pinball my friend of mine because the reason I called up Jared is he knows all about Facebook.

[01:35] And I said, Jared, did Stern pinball do this? Did they like, did they try to get my content removed? And he's like, no, no one told me anything.

[01:45] And then he said, I was like, how does this happen? And he said, well, what happens is, is it the file three complaints and three reports that the content you have up is abusive.

[01:57] And they'll take that into consideration. And sometimes they'll just remove the item in question, but they can also complain to Facebook to try and get the entire URL that delivers all of your content blacklisted from Facebook.

[02:14] And I'm like, oh, okay. So, but he said it wasn't Stern. And so then what Jared doesn't know is that I also have friends at Facebook and I actually went back and I was confused.

[02:23] I didn't even remember seeing any notification about who did this. And then obviously, if you were to ask the question, who's mad enough at canada to complain to Facebook that the content we make on this show is abusive, right?

[02:38] And that all of a sudden, like the list starts to get on and on and on. Was it Dr. Frightner? Was it oric? Was it Hilton?

[02:46] Was it American Pimball? Was it all the people I've pissed off over the years? Was it Andrew Highway? Like, who could it be?

[02:53] But you know what, I wasn't going to point fingers at any of those people because I don't think it was any of them.

[02:59] And then lo and behold, Brenda found somewhere in my Facebook page where the notifications came in and the specific content that was flagged for being abusive.

[03:13] Now think about this for a minute. This content in a world in which we have political hate speech going on every day.

[03:20] We have racial hate speech being shared all across Facebook in a world in which 100,000 people have perished in this country.

[03:30] Okay, think about everything going on in the world that my Pimball podcast was attacked for being abusive content.

[03:39] Now what was really funny and what was really alarming is it was one Pimball show that I did that was flagged three times.

[03:49] Now listener of the show, you tell me who you think complained to Facebook to get Canadian Pimball podcast censored on Facebook.

[03:59] You can't listen to it on Facebook, you can't share a link, you can't do anything with the links to my show on Facebook because of what this company did.

[04:10] And I'll tell you what episode it was. It was episode number 486.

[04:17] And the title of that episode is TMNT Details Revealed.

[04:24] And the post on Facebook was something along the lines of if you want to hear what's in Stern's next game, listen here.

[04:32] So when I saw that that this was the episode that led to Facebook banning people's ability to share my link or click on my links, I just asked one very simple question.

[04:44] Who would find that abusive? Who would find a show that is revealing details about Ninja Turtles Pimball to be abusive?

[04:52] And I can only draw one conclusion that it was Stern Pimball who complained to Facebook about Canada.

[05:00] And I'm a little bit perplexed by that complaint. And part of me wants to go on some expletive filled rant about how lame this is, about how lame censorship is, about how lame the marketing team over at Stern Pimball is, about how this company makes so much money.

[05:18] And is it really hurting anybody that can a dispimball podcast shared details about a magnetized pizza or Raphael on a glider or the fact that there is a Ninja Turtles van.

[05:29] And by the way, they didn't do anything in terms of stopping people from listening to this show. And this is why I think it's also double lame because it was a failed attempt to actually remove any of the content because here's why soundcloud where I list my,

[05:46] my podcast, they protect freedom of speech and they allow people to put their stuff out in the world and my, and I don't know like if I'm just saying it right now, if I feel like someone, you know when someone's like afraid someone's going to murder them, if my Pimball podcast ever disappears from the airwaves, you now know it seems like the company that really is out to take me down.

[06:10] And it's really weird to me to explain why because if you've listened to this show, I have done nothing but say positive things about teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.

[06:20] I've hyped this game from the very beginning. I've had nothing but glowing remarks about what we expect to see from Zambi Eddie and now we know he knocked it out of the park.

[06:29] Sure, I've had my questions about Dwight on code, but who amongst us raise your hand hasn't had your questions about Dwight on code.

[06:36] And so for, for me, I have to draw the conclusion that Stern Pimball is the company that cried to Facebook about Canada.

[06:45] And I just want to say something to the team over at Stern because I know they listen, I know Ed Robertson listen, Zambi Eddie listen, George Gomez listen, I bet Zach Sharp listen, gentlemen.

[06:56] You have the world's number one Pimball company. You don't need to act like lame losers because Canada has a little scoop on your game.

[07:06] You're still going to sell thousands of games and you should look at this within the context of what my show does and what my show is about.

[07:15] And even if you listen to the show, Zach Sharp, 2100 people listen to my show in which I gave them details about Ninja Turtles.

[07:26] None of those details would detract anybody from buying your toy. These are grown men buying toys.

[07:33] Again, in a world in which all these calamities are happening, you're upset that I revealed three to four positive details and exciting things to look forward to.

[07:43] And remember, I just all I did was I articulated those details of the game on a podcast.

[07:51] Right, I didn't even share images of the game. I never leaked images of this game. I never leaked videos of this game.

[07:57] Maybe he still upset because I shared the Stranger Things video early, which by the way came from Stern. Stern sends it stuff out early.

[08:07] And Zach, the reason why I knew details about your game early was because you sent it out early to people and those people talked and one of those people talked to me.

[08:19] Now, why don't you simply watermark your images and your press releases so you know who's sharing stuff or you could do this? Here's the other thing you could do, Zach.

[08:29] You could stop making that serious face on the videos. You could stop taking pinball so damn seriously and you could actually have some fun and not care that if you trivial details about a game, make it onto a podcast that only 2100 nerds and losers like me and you,

[08:48] listen to what harm is it in revealing any of these details to the world? What harm is it that a video or a screenshot of a pinball machine makes it out a day before your plans?

[09:03] And maybe, maybe you should get in the conference room, put on your grown-up pants, call a meeting and say, hey, how can we avoid this moving forward?

[09:13] How can I actually figure out how professional marketers keep stuff more under wraps?

[09:21] And I don't mean to attack him specifically. I don't even know if it was really him, but I get the sense it is because I didn't get an email from him.

[09:28] And he sort of has Jared trying to do his dirty work. And I saw this post that he sent out.

[09:34] So when Ninja Turtles after this show, you remember like images of the game leaked before, before Stern's official reveal date.

[09:43] And he had Jared go out and send the following to people. And it says this. I'm reading this word from word because other pinball podcasts and other pinball websites, they got this message from Stern Pinball.

[09:55] It goes, if images of TMNT are not removed from your page upon receipt of this message, I will move forward with a legal complaint and copyright infringement report.

[10:12] This will result spelled wrong in result was spelled RES IELTI in a strike on your page and the content being manually removed.

[10:23] This is a request direct from Zach Sharp. Thanks. Why doesn't Zach Sharp send this note out? And why is Stern Pinball doing this? Like why are they attacking?

[10:38] The few fan pages that exist who are just excited about their game for the life of me, you can draw your own conclusion.

[10:47] I think it's somewhat lame. I think it's somewhat juvenile. I think it's some, you know, and here's the reason why. Stern Pinball is so successful.

[10:56] We buy this company's games time and time again. You spend so much money on these Stern machines and we know they don't cost that much to make.

[11:07] We know we're all kind of getting ripped off on every Stern machine and we don't really care because Stern machine gets it done, they put it in a box, they make the game available by the time it's revealed you can have it in your home in a few weeks.

[11:20] And we always, we always praise Stern for that efficiency on this show. But for some reason, for some reason, Zach Sharp needs to lighten up. And he does. And you can see it like on his face when he's in that video.

[11:37] Like he thinks that's the kind of way you should approach pinball. It's like serious business to the sharps. And it's with no disrespect. And we all know why their family is pinball sort of pinball dynasty.

[11:53] But this is not how you deal with your fan base. This is not how you deal with, because it wasn't just me. Remember, these are like pinball fans sharing content, because they're excited about Ninja Turtles being threatened with a legal action by Zach and Stern.

[12:11] And I understand it, Zach. I understand you have an agreement with Nickelodeon. I understand you have a scheduled rollout. I understand you have an exclusive with Kataku or IGN. And let me tell you something. Nobody, nobody that reads Kataku who cares about pinball.

[12:28] I don't even think anyone who reads Kataku cares about pinball to begin with. I don't think anyone who reads IGN cares about pinball to be going, you know who cares about pinball?

[12:36] The people on these pages that you're threatening. You know cares about pinball, the Stern pinball enthusiast group. You know cares the most about pinball? The people on pinside who you completely ignore, who you completely refuse to engage with.

[12:51] And the number one pinball company in the world refuses to engage with the number one pinball community in the world. Just think about that for a minute, people. Think about that for a minute.

[13:02] And then draw your conclusion as to why they're now going after the number one pinball podcast in the world. And I just think it's really lame. And I think Zach Sharp should look in the mirror and ask himself what he's really trying to accomplish here.

[13:17] And there's so many different ways that Zach Sharp and Canada could work together moving forward. And I've extended a million olive branches to Zach Sharp. And I can share with you the emails every time I say to him, how about we bury the hatchet, how about we like move on? I've apologized to Tim Sex and so many times.

[13:36] I don't know what it takes. I have cordial conversations with George Gomez. I have great conversations with Jared. I have great conversations with Ed Roberts and great conversations with Jack Danger.

[13:46] Great conversations with so many people affiliated with Stern pinball. But for some reason, the marketing department just considers this stuff to be life and death. It's pinball. And who cares? Who really cares? All right. And it's not even worth it. Here's the funny part. It's not even worth it.

[14:05] At the end of the day, I didn't spoil any big marketing plan because there was no big marketing plan. There was no big marketing launch. There was no creative idea that I ruined or spoiled or like, or rained on.

[14:18] Okay. So Zach, look, what you did was lame, shutting down people's ability to share my podcast with their friends. I mean, Greg can't share this with his friends.

[14:29] He wants to share his excitement with the game and the fact that he came on my show and he wants to share that with people and you prohibited that. And I know I'm saying you as an Zach, but I mean, come on. Who else would it have been if it was all about Ninja Turtles? All right. All right. So what else is going on?

[14:49] So the I want to I want to like change gears to the best news I've had all year. And that was the lamest news I've had all year. And we're going to try to get Canada back on Facebook. I'm still on Facebook. My soundcloud still up. You just can't share links, which I think sucks. The best news of the year. This is with such pleasure that I announced to all of you a

[15:11] a Canadian pinball podcast exclusive and this is just the feel good story of the year. You could say it's the peel good story of the year that butch peel has a new job in pinball. And butch peel will be joining Chicago gaming company. And he will be serving as their lead service engineer. And you know butch. He used to be at Jersey Jack pinball. He's been heartbroken since they let him go.

[15:40] And everybody when they heard this news was like how could Jersey Jack pinball let butch peel go and like there's like I kept hearing from people like there's like one guy. If there's like one guy you don't let go. There's like one guy who's like the linchpin and the foundation of of a great pinball organization and institution. It's butch peel like he's one of the nicest guys. And I don't think you can find anybody anybody to say anything bad about this man who has spent 32 years in the electric.

[16:09] And the electronics engineering business and he's with he was with the US Army research laboratory. You know this guy is amazing he was with J.J.P. for eight years. And so when we first broke the news that butch peel was let go at J.J.P.

[16:23] I was fortunate enough to connect with butch and hear from butch after I did my show that he was thankful that I brought attention to the fact that he was let go and that he was devastated. I spoke to his daughter about this. And since then I really I've only wanted to do one thing and that's fine butch a new home in pinball. So I'm so happy today because he's not just going to be joining them. He's also going to be going to all the pinball shows when they turn back on. He is going to be present.

[16:52] He's going to be joining C.G.C. and I just want to also thank Christopher Franchi who also when he heard the news asked me to help connect him with butch and got butch through the door. I also want to thank Ryan White over at Chicago Gaming Company for seeing the value in butch.

[17:13] And I just I guess I just want to thank butch for being freaking amazing. This wasn't a hard decision to bring butch on board. It just was a stupid decision. I think to let him go. And I think everyone would agree with that. So butch we look forward to seeing you back in pinball with C.G.C.

[17:30] and I think it's a great pick up. It's a great pick up. And please butch if I say something that I don't like about a C.G.C. game. Please do not go to Facebook and say that that show was abusive.

[17:43] Okay because I already got it coming from Stern. I'm just joking butch we never do that. All right. What else is going on in pinball. So I want to also talk a little bit about the J.J.P. teaser because we were just talking about J.J.P. letting butch go.

[17:56] It was interesting that they put up that video that the game is about the change and that you asked for innovation and there was like this teaser video in which there's a question mark.

[18:07] Now I'm here to tell you a few things that I know. One is that the innovation that is going to be celebrated is not Wi-Fi. Okay. I don't it's not going to be internet Wi-Fi play.

[18:20] I also know that it's not going to be something that's going to impact the existing portfolio of games. The innovation you are going to get is going to be in their next game which we know is guns and roses.

[18:34] And so they really are beginning to start the night train. They're starting the hype train of GNR. And so people keep asking me when do I think guns and roses is going to come out and I do not know.

[18:47] If I were to take a guess I think we're going to see it in August. I would say that is the earliest I think we'll see GNR. Now if you look at the time period between when they announced Willy Wonka and when we got it it was like two months.

[19:02] So that means we could see guns and roses revealed to the world in June at some point. I don't know if that's the fact or not.

[19:12] I heard rumors that they were still exploring what the final bomb on the game would be. But if it's going to start going on the line then you would think all the parts would be in house ready to make it.

[19:24] And so those decisions have already been made. Now I do know that JJP has entered into what they are calling phase three which means they are ready for manufacturing in Chicago.

[19:38] Now you might have seen the new sign outside of Jersey Jack Pimball Chicago. It's a little bit of a different logo for them. They removed the outline of the New Jersey state but it's still called Jersey Jack Pimball.

[19:51] And some people think that photo is photoshopped. It is not. I talked to Ken. It is real. That is the actual sign that is outside of Jersey Jack Pimball.

[20:01] So life goes on in the world of Pimball but finds new home Jersey Jack Pimball has found a new home in Chicago.

[20:08] Stern Pimball doesn't like canate his Pimball podcast. It's almost like what's new in the world. We're right back to where we always were with everything.

[20:17] So I think I'm going to go check that out. I think it's a really exciting time to be back in Pimball. Things are back on. Things are turning back on.

[20:32] And I really look forward to seeing what else is coming out. I did get a somewhat of an invitation from Robert Mueller to maybe check out what's going on at Deeproot in July.

[20:44] Now I don't even know is it safe to fly to Texas in July but I am very intrigued to see what they are finally doing over there.

[20:55] Now I have a little bit of information on Deeproot for you that I've heard through the rumor mill. And I don't think this is spoiling much but I always knew that what they brought to Houston was a little bit of a sandbagged effort of what the final game would be.

[21:10] I am hearing and I'm not again this is this is rumor I am hearing that the final version of Raza will be not just in a different cabinet but the dimensions might be different.

[21:22] And by that and I don't know if the that makes the play field longer and I don't think so but it's going to be in more of a zidware like play field that is I think deeper and longer.

[21:33] So the glass on the machine is not going to be your standard glass. So if you've ordered PDI glass for your Raza machine you're at a look.

[21:42] It was always annoying when I had magic girl that that glass was longer because you really can't get non reflective glass in that size from any of the pinball companies out there that cut glass because nobody cuts it at that size.

[21:55] And I really hope that that deeproot didn't go down too much of a pop a Duke road in which so much of the standard parts of pinball have to be redone in different dimensions because that's what John wanted.

[22:11] I am working on my expose my new expose on Jersey Jack pinball and the story behind what went on behind the scenes that made Jersey Jack pinball move from Jersey to Chicago.

[22:25] It's a really interesting tale that's worthy of a movie slash documentary. There's lots of characters in play and I'm doing my best to capture some of the behind the scenes moments that you never get to hear about.

[22:40] I'll tell you this right now the world behind the world you know in pinball is so much more interesting.

[22:46] The decisions that are made that impact these games that you and I love and buy it's incredible when you hear the decisions why things were taken out of games or the decisions why things took so long to get to market or the reasons why companies started to run out of money.

[23:03] The real reason why we didn't get the map back into pirates of the Caribbean or the real reason why it took forever to get wizard of Oz out or what was Hobbit supposed to be you know there's all these interesting things that were happening behind the scenes and sometimes I have to be honest when I hear it all and you put it all together.

[23:22] I'm like why would anyone ever want to go into making pinball games and I sort of feel bad for Jack and I feel bad for some other people because to get to a point where you could turn an empty factory into a factory that shipped games as complex as pinball machines it's a miracle that it ever happens anywhere in 2020 2019 and all you know throughout all these years we've been following these companies and it's known as the real reason why we're in the world.

[23:51] And it's no mystery why so many companies fail to deliver pinball machines it really is a miracle if you can get a game in a box and for those of you out there that think like I was laughing yesterday because I saw that a company I used to work on magic leap.

[24:08] They're an augmented reality company if you think like deep roots squander tens of millions of dollars and and Leonard's pumped millions into JJP and it's still not profitable or whatnot if you think pinball companies are inefficient and vaporware and boutiques are lying and just stole people's money and Kevin Coulick is a criminal.

[24:28] Magic leap raised 30 billion dollars 30 billion dollars they raised to make this this you know these glasses that have augmented reality right 30 billion and let me tell you the CEO Rory you notice you know it is KPIs where key performance indicators he told the investors and the shareholders and the people at the company they expect it after all these years five years in development

[24:56] 1500 employees they expected to sell 1 million units of magic leap one last year okay do you know how many units of magic leap one they sold he said 1 million units they sold 6,000 company fired 1,000 employees last month he's stepping down so it happens it happens people have big dreams but they often can't execute those dreams so I want to sign off this podcast by

[25:25] saying congratulations to butch peel we are super happy I know this is going to be a great weekend in the peel household I want to say stern pinball I've been more than fair to you I do more good for stern pinball than bad I say way more nice things about stern pinball than bad things I've owned two of your machines all right you are the most successful pinball company in the world don't be lame don't stand on the side of censor

[25:54] ship and the people that want to see your stuff if they see it a little early it doesn't hurt anyone other than your marketing department's ego it doesn't hurt Nickelodeon it doesn't hurt your bottom line it's simply hurts your marketing department's ego and you

[26:14] shouldn't have an ego because you know you're selling us $3,000 games for almost nine to $10,000 with tax okay so get over yourself stern we appreciate you but lame move mr. marketing department over there all right and J.J.P you don't need to throw the word innovation out you just need to make

[26:35] awesome cool stuff happening pinball and I think Guns and Rose is is gonna deliver that I'm not gonna I'm not gonna hype it like wonka people are like it's gonna cry wolf canator all over again it's not gonna happen I think people find it really really cool and I can't wait to see what the innovation is though I mean it's like see innovations of funny word you say it and you're like well you know like we don't need

[26:54] innovation we just need cool pinball but like you know what is the innovation is it you know it's I do look forward to seeing what happens over there we all just want options it's an exciting time oh and finally I'm still checking with my building to see if I can get that Rick and Morty Morgan and

[27:14] Shocking company have been nothing but gracious and understanding it's in a box it's ready to ship so no I have not bailed on Rick and Morty I still need to find out if my

[27:23] Building management company will let me take delivery they've been slow to respond it's crazy right in a global pandemic it's

[27:29] Shocking to me that my building management company is slow to respond to my request about putting a pinball machine into my

[27:38] apartment how dare they how dare you share details about Ninja Turtle Canada have a great day everybody

[27:54] maybe we could start again
