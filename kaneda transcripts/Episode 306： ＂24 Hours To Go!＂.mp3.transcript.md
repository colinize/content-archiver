[00:00] To win a tournament, to win a ball, I was the goal.

[00:03] I won't be the baby.

[00:05] It's...

[00:06] Oh!

[00:07] Oh!

[00:08] Oh!

[00:09] Welcome to episode 306 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast with the Midnight

[00:18] Mantis mode.

[00:20] There's 24 hours to go, so get your Twippy votes in.

[00:24] If you've been listening to the show, you know what I'm talking about.

[00:27] It closes at midnight tomorrow, so make sure you vote for all your favorite pinball machines,

[00:32] designers, artwork, and of course your favorite pinball podcast.

[00:36] I just wanted to do a little bit of a shorter snackable episode.

[00:39] I don't know about the rest of you guys out there, but I've been doing a little bit of

[00:43] longer interview format shows, which I think are good.

[00:46] Sometimes you need an hour to talk to people and get their thoughts out.

[00:50] What I want to do in this podcast is I want to talk about my reactions to what was said

[00:54] on some of those interviews, because I know I just end the shows and someone said that

[00:58] in an email.

[00:59] I want to talk a little bit about the pinball news going on, and then I want to read some

[01:03] of your emails, and then I want to be done because I have a lot of work to do.

[01:07] So let's jump right into it.

[01:09] So well, go down the list of people I've interviewed in a row.

[01:11] We interviewed Ben Heck.

[01:13] We interviewed Quinn Johnson from Deeproot, and we interviewed the Black Knight.

[01:18] Let me start with the Black Knight.

[01:20] I think Christopher Thompson is a very knowledgeable person.

[01:23] He's been in his hobby for many years.

[01:25] I know there's some back and forth debate on whether or not he's sort of old school, and

[01:29] he doesn't understand the modern pinball world.

[01:32] I don't necessarily agree with that, but he did drop a little bit of a bombshell on my

[01:37] last podcast that he believes that Stern is making games designed for obsolescence, that

[01:43] they will break in the future, and they will not be repairable.

[01:47] I think when you heard me talk to him, I even said, I don't think that's going to happen.

[01:52] I don't.

[01:53] I don't think Stern is making games to break.

[01:55] I think Stern is a company making games in a way where they can ship 10,000 a year.

[02:02] I think Stern is making games in a way where they can ship four to five to six games a year.

[02:08] And so the node board upgrade, even some may call it a downgrade, I don't see it as that.

[02:15] And I do disagree that these games are just going to be built to break, and they will

[02:18] be unruly, unruly, and unruly, and unruly.

[02:21] Of course, none of us know either way because we're not in the future, and we don't live

[02:25] 15 years from now and Stern's out of business and no one can find node boards.

[02:30] But I will say this as well.

[02:32] And I've owned a Stern Batman 66 now for almost two years.

[02:37] I've had to lift the play field maybe three or four times.

[02:42] Once to adjust the Penguin crane, I did have a node board eight failed at the very beginning

[02:49] that was replaced immediately by Stern.

[02:51] And since then, it's been rock solid.

[02:55] And I have to say that Stern builds games for the most part.

[03:00] I think where most of us aren't constantly fixing them.

[03:04] And so I also don't think the biggest pinball company in the world is ever going to leave

[03:07] people hanging.

[03:08] Now, the other part is, it's not that they're going to leave you hanging.

[03:11] Are they going to make you pay lots of money to replace these boards when they fail if

[03:16] they're not fixable and make you pay two, three, four hundred dollars of board.

[03:20] And that can get really expensive for people.

[03:23] I don't know.

[03:24] I don't know if that's going to happen, but I'll say this.

[03:25] Let's say five years from now, you got games that are out of warranty and you need to

[03:29] replace a board for two, three hundred bucks.

[03:31] You're not going to care.

[03:33] You're really not.

[03:34] I mean, if you have six, seven, eight, nine thousand dollars to buy a pinball machine and

[03:39] you need to spend two, three hundred bucks to get it up and running again, I think that's

[03:43] money you'll easily spend.

[03:46] So yeah, okay.

[03:48] And again, when I look across all the other pinball manufacturers, I still think Stern is

[03:53] is shipping the most reliable games.

[03:55] Literally name a game that's more reliable.

[03:57] I said it.

[03:58] I said literally, damn it.

[03:59] Damn it.

[04:00] I'm going to put a dollar in a jar every time I do that.

[04:02] Alright, so that's that was the big takeaway from the Christopher Thompson chat that I think

[04:07] a lot of people were wondering what I thought about that.

[04:09] So let's go on to Ben Heck.

[04:11] So Ben Heck came on the show and I love the fact that Ben was very candid about his experience

[04:16] at spooky, why he left the status of his game, evil dead cough cough.

[04:22] Here's my take on the whole thing.

[04:24] I think Ben sort of broke up with a family, you know, sleep it on Charlie's couch.

[04:31] He was with them for so many days and hours and they built the company on their backs

[04:36] and they kicked their asses and they killed themselves to get these games made at the

[04:41] very beginning of the company.

[04:43] And nobody understands the pain and agony that he went through and and Chuck went through

[04:49] and the whole company went through just to survive.

[04:51] I mean, people forget sometimes how close spooky as a company was to just being dead on

[04:58] arrival.

[04:59] Nobody wanted their first game and they had a limited to get people interested in it.

[05:04] I think that Ben is a guy that works really hard.

[05:08] I think he is talented and I'm just going to say this.

[05:14] I do think Ben is possibly more talented than the people he's leaving.

[05:20] And I think that's always been the problem I see at spooky is that the B students hire

[05:26] the C students and the A students hire the A students and I've seen that in my professional

[05:31] career and I've seen it in other areas of life.

[05:36] I think when it comes to designing a pinball machine, I think Chuck is a little bit of a

[05:40] B student and I'm not saying that to be a jerk.

[05:43] I think his talent lie elsewhere, but I think Chuck has stood in front of a lot of these

[05:49] game designs and made a lot of these decisions.

[05:53] But I doubt, you know, I just don't think he's got the talent to make a great game.

[05:59] And how many games do you get before you get to make a great game?

[06:05] And have they ever made a great game?

[06:08] And I think Ben was just fed up.

[06:11] And knowing that he felt like he had a great game on the back burner, I think led him to

[06:17] want to leave.

[06:18] Now look, Ben had a chance to also make a great game.

[06:22] And he made America's most honoured.

[06:23] I think he learned a lot.

[06:24] I think he learned a lot about pinball, a lot about what people want, a lot about theme,

[06:28] a lot about artwork, a lot about the other important factors that make it pinball game

[06:32] fun.

[06:33] But I think he also never delivered that great game either.

[06:38] And would his next game have been great?

[06:40] We don't know because we won't see it.

[06:42] So it's also easy to sort of to stand on the sidelines and say stuff.

[06:48] But look, I think Ben has talented.

[06:51] I think spooky has given people games.

[06:54] You know me, you know me, you know this podcast.

[06:57] I think spooky games are just like decent games.

[07:01] But I just don't know why you would buy one in a climate where so many other games

[07:06] are better at the same price unless you want to support the smaller company.

[07:11] And that's fine.

[07:12] And I don't think saying that is unfair.

[07:15] Okay.

[07:16] So that's where we're at.

[07:17] Now I was Cooper Nightmare Castle, 500 of them.

[07:20] Is it going to be a great game?

[07:22] I don't think the reviews are going to be great.

[07:24] People are going to finally get them soon, but you'll see.

[07:27] That's it.

[07:28] You'll see.

[07:29] Some of the early owners will claim that it's incredible.

[07:32] We see that with every new release, but ultimately time will tell.

[07:36] Ultimately time will tell.

[07:37] All right.

[07:38] So that was a good interview with Ben.

[07:39] And then Quin Johnson, Deeproot, nice guy, awesome guy, fun to talk to.

[07:45] Deeproot continues to remain a mystery to all of us.

[07:50] I don't know what else to say.

[07:51] I'm excited to see what they do.

[07:52] I don't know when I'm going to see it.

[07:54] I'm almost getting tired of wondering when I'm going to be able to see anything.

[07:59] So we'll just leave it at that.

[08:02] It's one of those things where I could speculate.

[08:04] It's like if you look at a blank wall and someone's like, Chris, can you speculate at the

[08:08] artwork I bought to put on that wall?

[08:11] And I could start to go down a few things.

[08:12] Yeah.

[08:13] Maybe you're going to bring in a comic book art thing because you know, I like that or

[08:17] maybe it's going to be bulldog themed.

[08:18] And then at you reach a point where you're just, you get tired of wondering what could

[08:23] be there.

[08:24] And that's how I feel lately about Deeproot.

[08:26] All right.

[08:27] Let's talk a little bit about some pinball news.

[08:30] So those were the last three things I saw or the last three people I talked to.

[08:34] When it comes to pinball news, let's talk about American pinball.

[08:38] Where is October fest?

[08:40] And I'm just going to go down a list of the manufacturers.

[08:42] October fest, I don't know.

[08:43] I think they're just going to hold it to T.P.F.

[08:45] It doesn't make sense to release it in one of these dead months.

[08:49] So I expect to see it there.

[08:51] But probably have a bunch of games in box if they're smart, ready to ship.

[08:54] But T.P.F. will be the maker break date for October fest.

[08:59] It's really a shame.

[09:00] Remember because they launched this game at Expo and games haven't gone out.

[09:03] And now they have the way to T.P.F.

[09:04] The problem they're going to face.

[09:06] If someone else releases something amazing at T.P.F.

[09:08] that's unforeseen, I don't know, will he want to maybe?

[09:11] I don't know.

[09:12] If something happens there that makes people want to hold onto their money, it could

[09:15] be people playing monsters and loving monsters, whatever it is.

[09:19] There's just more competition now than ever before.

[09:22] And when you go to a big show, I'll say this too.

[09:25] When you go to a big show and you reveal it, you let people play your game, they're also

[09:29] playing every other pinball machine that is available almost for the history of time.

[09:35] Not true.

[09:36] But most of the games, the classic games, everything's there that your game will be compared to.

[09:40] So it becomes glaringly apparent if your artwork isn't as good, if your code isn't as

[09:45] good, if your animations aren't as good.

[09:49] So I think as much as these guys think that bringing these games to shows, to drum up hype

[09:54] is a good thing.

[09:56] I also think the part that nobody ever tells them to their face because they're standing

[10:00] there, Joe Balser, Dovel, the American pinball people, Josh Kugler, they're all be there

[10:04] and you'll shake their hand and you'll be like, yeah, yeah, it's great.

[10:06] It's amazing.

[10:07] And then someone goes off and plays like, maybe Batman and has more fun or maybe this

[10:11] and has more fun monsters or medieval madness or attack from ours or monster bash remake.

[10:16] You have $78,000 in your wallet and you're playing all these machines are incredible that

[10:21] you could own and you have to make October Fest a better experience than all of those.

[10:26] You're just hearing Bubba's feet on the ground.

[10:28] So that's what's going to happen and that's why I think it's going to be tough to get

[10:30] hyped back.

[10:31] You get one chance to get people to buy your game now.

[10:34] Alright, Jersey Jack pinball, I'm in the thread.

[10:37] I'm not making this stuff up.

[10:39] I'm in the thread, guys.

[10:40] I live there.

[10:41] I love going into the Jersey Jack Pirates of the Caribbean thread.

[10:44] And what am I reading?

[10:45] Those games have Playfieldware and people want to install Cliffy's and make total sense.

[10:50] When you buy a $10,000 pinball machine and you're a collector and you love the game.

[10:55] Here's the thing too, the more you love the game, the more you want your game to remain

[10:59] perfect for all time.

[11:01] The more you want to put protectors on it, the more you want all the areas I could wear

[11:05] to have some sort of protection in that spot.

[11:09] So people are putting Cliffy protectors on their Jersey Jack Pirates of the Caribbean, which

[11:13] is great.

[11:14] Cliffy for making these things.

[11:16] What's not so great is that people have to tear their games apart to put these Playfield

[11:21] protectors on.

[11:22] And the question I can't understand is Jack knows that people will have to do this in

[11:27] these certain areas.

[11:28] He knows it.

[11:29] He knows where the wear is at.

[11:30] He knows the Mylar is not that effective.

[11:33] When I look at a Jersey Jack game and it's just Mylar, Mylar, Mylar, that's not the

[11:38] solve.

[11:39] Mylar is a short term solution.

[11:41] It is not a long term solution to have all over the Playfield because once that Mylar

[11:45] starts to lift up, it can oftentimes take up the clear and the artwork from the game

[11:51] if you have to replace it.

[11:53] And Cliffy is just a much better option.

[11:55] And how many years do we have to see Pimball Machines wear and tear by vertical upkicks

[12:00] and scoops and other areas where the ball hits an edge of a Playfield directly with some

[12:07] velocity that a Cliffy is the best solution.

[12:11] And here is the thing that I don't understand.

[12:13] Why didn't Jersey Jack give Cliffy the Playfield a year ago?

[12:21] The Playfield was done a year ago.

[12:24] Why did they not have that done a year ago and why did they not install these protectors

[12:30] at the factory when it was on the assembly line, which would make it so much easier than

[12:36] watching all these guys pull their games apart.

[12:38] I mean, you have to take away the upper Playfield to get one of the Cliffy's installed.

[12:42] And I see this stuff.

[12:45] And again, it just begs the question, when you have a year and you're charging $10,000

[12:49] for a premium Pimball, why can't they just do everything for you at the factory?

[12:53] I don't get it.

[12:54] You can no longer get a Playfield protector at Jersey Jack Pimball anymore.

[12:57] Why is that?

[12:58] I don't get that either.

[13:00] Otherwise, how's the game selling?

[13:02] I don't know.

[13:03] I don't know.

[13:04] I'm seeing a ton of unboxings in the Pirates of the Caribbean threat.

[13:08] I don't think we're seeing nearly as many as we think.

[13:12] And I know I see guys like Yellowbird claiming it's the best game of all time.

[13:16] Then it's like comma, buy all my mods for it.

[13:19] But the reality is this game is now available.

[13:23] It is shipping to consumers.

[13:25] I don't know what the demand is.

[13:27] I don't see as many unboxings as you would a new Stern.

[13:32] It's also because with Jack, it's not the same as Stern.

[13:35] Stern's sort of got that cadence of Ellie, they ship first with the pros.

[13:40] Then you get the premiums.

[13:43] And then it's just like premiums and pros left and right being opened up by people.

[13:47] Nobody buys a Jersey Jack standard or the pro, right?

[13:52] It's like limited edition or collector's editions.

[13:54] I feel like nobody buys or wants like the base version of a Jersey Jack game, which begs

[14:01] the question, why do they even make it?

[14:03] I saw some guy out there heavily mod it, a Wizard of Oz standard edition with all this

[14:09] stuff.

[14:10] But once you see that stainless steel armor, it's basically the trim nobody wants.

[14:15] And so why would you mod the version nobody wants?

[14:18] Okay.

[14:19] So that's what's happening at JJP.

[14:21] I heard yesterday that that Willy Wonka images have leaked.

[14:25] And someone said, Chris, you have the images.

[14:27] And I said, no, I don't have the images.

[14:28] And I asked all my trusted people.

[14:30] Do you have the images?

[14:31] Everyone's like, no.

[14:32] And then I thought to myself, they're probably just making this shit up.

[14:35] How easy is it to just start a rumor?

[14:38] Willy Wonka images.

[14:39] They're out.

[14:40] People are passing them around.

[14:42] Sure they are.

[14:43] Whatever.

[14:44] I don't really care.

[14:45] I don't think they're out.

[14:47] I don't know.

[14:48] If they are, send them to me and I'll post them.

[14:50] I don't care.

[14:51] I really don't.

[14:52] I'm so sick of like the little inner circle of pinball people that just share leaked images

[14:56] and won't let anyone else in on the fun.

[14:58] I get, look, I get why they're damaging and you shouldn't share them.

[15:01] I'm sorry.

[15:02] I'm sorry for sharing photos in the past.

[15:04] But anyway, it will, will, will, you want to be at T-PF.

[15:08] We keep debating this and we'll just say it again.

[15:10] It makes no sense to bring Willy Wonka to Texas Pinball Festival.

[15:15] If Jack does that, it is just an idiotic move because there's no way they have that game

[15:21] ready to go on the line within the next couple months after March.

[15:24] There's no way they've tooled up for that game.

[15:27] They just got tooled up for Pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:30] If you don't think Pirates of the Caribbean sales will just die immediately if he shows

[15:34] Wonka you're wrong because everybody wants Wonka and Toy Story over Pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:41] All you have to do is go to Rod and Tomatoes and look at the enthusiasm for the Toy Story

[15:47] and Wonka franchise.

[15:48] Now, look at the enthusiasm for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.

[15:53] We'll see what happens.

[15:54] Did I talk about this?

[15:56] Did I talk about how plundering is so much fun and people complain about it?

[16:00] I think I did.

[16:01] I saw tournament players complaining about plundering, stealing other people's gold.

[16:06] So much more fun to do.

[16:07] It's so much fun.

[16:08] It makes tournament play fun to watch a player being able to steal another player's gold

[16:14] or multi-balls.

[16:15] I heard people were crying about it.

[16:16] It makes no sense.

[16:17] Anyway, I think I did talk about that with the Ben Hick interview.

[16:19] Anyway, what else is going on?

[16:21] Nothing else at Jersey Jack.

[16:23] We're going to have Pirates of the Caribbean as the game we have.

[16:25] How long will we have it before?

[16:26] Jack said two new reveals in 2019.

[16:29] Yeah, or do you believe that?

[16:32] Do you believe that he's going to reveal two games in one year?

[16:36] Do you think that's actually going to happen?

[16:38] Because for that to happen and Jack to do what he also said he was going to do, think

[16:42] about that for a minute.

[16:44] Jack said he will no longer show a game until it's ready to ship.

[16:47] So that's Jack saying that he's got two new games ready to reveal this year.

[16:51] Does that mean he's going to ship two games in 2019?

[16:54] I will say right now.

[16:57] Right now on Canadian Spinball Podcast, I believe there is no way Jersey Jack will ship two

[17:02] new games in 2019.

[17:05] History tells me he cannot do that.

[17:09] Unless he has hired the Avengers to manufacture these games, he's never going to do that.

[17:15] It sounds good.

[17:17] I think games are in progress for sure, but as we know, when it comes to Jersey Jack

[17:23] Pinball, what they do the best when it comes to revealing and shipping pinball games, and

[17:29] I'm going to be honest here, I think what they do the best is they find new ways to fuck

[17:33] up that simple thing of reveal your game and ship it to consumers in a few weeks and

[17:39] you'll be golden if they had shipped Pirates of the Caribbean right after revealing it

[17:45] at Expo of 2017.

[17:48] They would have sold twice as many games.

[17:50] I'm serious.

[17:51] If you don't think that year delay just crushed them, go back and read the commentary when

[17:58] he revealed that game.

[17:59] Everyone had their money out in that moment.

[18:03] Everyone was ready to buy.

[18:04] Everyone was saying a dark day for Stern.

[18:07] It was his moment.

[18:08] He did it.

[18:10] He revealed it and then he couldn't deliver.

[18:13] If he does it again and he does it again twice in 2019, I don't know how many times Jack

[18:21] gets to figure out what the right way is to launch a pinball machine.

[18:25] I've said this on the air before and I'll say it again, Jersey Jack, email me at canadapinball

[18:31] at gmail.com.

[18:32] I know a thing or two about marketing.

[18:35] You might have seen my latest idea out in the world, so I don't normally brag about myself.

[18:42] The sociopathic narcissistic canada.

[18:44] Nobody will listen to that assholes podcast.

[18:47] Vote it number one last year.

[18:49] This is a really fun idea.

[18:50] For you, Big Lebowski fans out there, one of my clients is Stellar Chwa.

[18:55] In August, I had a very simple idea, how can we get people to buy Stellar Chwa because

[19:00] everyone you buy, we donate money to water.org, which is a great foundation that helps people

[19:05] in third world countries get access to clean water.

[19:10] Every time you buy Stellar, we make a donation.

[19:12] I said to myself, why don't we get pop culture characters who are famous for drinking other

[19:17] drinks to switch their drink and choose Stellar Chwa because it's for a good cause.

[19:24] I was like, why don't we get the dude from the Big Lebowski?

[19:27] Why don't we get Carrie Bradshaw from Sex in the City, you know, Sarah Jessica Parker

[19:34] as Carrie and get them to order instead of a Cosmo, she orders a Stella instead of

[19:39] a white Russian, he orders a Stella.

[19:42] So it's out there on the internet now, but you're going to see it on Super Bowl Sunday.

[19:46] There's a little treat for you guys in that spot.

[19:49] There's a third pop culture character that will switch their drink that I think you're

[19:52] going to find awesome.

[19:53] But that came from the mind of this guy who knows nothing about marketing according to

[20:00] anyone else in the pinball world.

[20:02] No manufacturer has ever asked me to help them with marketing.

[20:05] Normal over at American Pinball asked me once and then when I tried to catch up with him,

[20:09] he just ignored me.

[20:11] Nobody else.

[20:12] Here's the other thing that's funny to me.

[20:15] Nobody has offered to sponsor this show.

[20:18] Nobody.

[20:19] Nobody.

[20:20] You go even pin stadium, go to pin stadium's Facebook page and they like spam every single

[20:25] podcast with hashtags and you guys get spam by pin stadium, by the way, I can't avoid

[20:30] it.

[20:31] It's like we get it.

[20:33] We get it.

[20:34] You make lights and they're great.

[20:35] I haven't been my Batman.

[20:36] I think they're incredible.

[20:38] The amount of ads they put out are insane and I get it every day in my feed.

[20:43] It's like they literally take every single pinball machine and show you how it's different

[20:46] with pin stadium, but they hashtag everybody.

[20:50] Poor Jack dangers, like hashtag then every single post they make and every time you get

[20:55] tagged, it notifies you that you've been tagged in a post.

[21:00] They have all these other pinball podcasts, but they didn't tag me.

[21:03] Why is that?

[21:04] Everyone wants to avoid, but I think we're going to take it again this year.

[21:08] I really do.

[21:09] I think it sends a message.

[21:11] This is why the Twippy vote for Canadian pinball podcast I think matters too because it sends

[21:15] a message to everybody else out there that wants to ignore the kind of stuff we talk about

[21:21] on this show.

[21:22] It basically says you can't ignore it.

[21:25] It's relevant and our vote shows that and that is why I appreciate it so much when you

[21:30] make that vote.

[21:31] I know the other pinball podcast out there all do different shows.

[21:33] They have different reasons why they want you to vote or don't want you to vote, but that

[21:36] is why when Canada wins, I think it's a win for the conversation about this hobby that

[21:42] a lot of people don't want to have that manufacturers don't want you to have.

[21:46] Do you think Stern pinball wants you to hear me on the airwaves telling you to hold on

[21:52] to your money, to don't chase every new game, to don't fall into the hype around new

[21:57] pinball launches that they so successfully have created, to don't buy an L.E. before

[22:02] playing it, to make sure you know you want it, to don't think that fun equals value.

[22:08] Don't be hoodwinked by an $8,000 betals, a $20,000 betals.

[22:12] Wait, think, think, live, put your health before your pinball dollars.

[22:19] Do you think they want you to hear that?

[22:21] No, it's the last thing a marketing department wants.

[22:25] Is someone like me on the air telling you that maybe you shouldn't fall victim to the

[22:31] pointless hype surrounding all these new games and maybe you should wake up and realize

[22:36] we're in an oversaturated pinball market and you can have the greatest games ever for

[22:41] much less than they were new and have a lot more fun and save a lot more money if you

[22:46] just adjust it the approach you have to this hobby and they don't want you to think that.

[22:53] And I know some other pinball podcasts out there get critical of me.

[22:55] You're being negative, Canada.

[22:57] You're not cheerleading every new manufacturer.

[23:00] You don't want every new manufacturer to succeed.

[23:04] And the answer is you're right.

[23:05] I don't want them to fail, but I don't want them around if their games are shit.

[23:09] Is that okay?

[23:12] I love movies.

[23:13] Should I just applaud every movie that comes out regardless of how good it is?

[23:16] All right.

[23:17] I got a little bit on the soapbox.

[23:19] P3 multi-morphic.

[23:20] They now have an LCD screen in the back box that they've had it for a few weeks now.

[23:24] Cosmic heart racing is shipping.

[23:26] It's been shipping for a few months now.

[23:28] I don't know how long Jerry has.

[23:31] The now he's changed the back box to be a huge screen like Alien and or Highway and Jersey

[23:38] Jack.

[23:39] Okay.

[23:42] You built this entire platform over five plus years with a humongous screen as the play

[23:46] field.

[23:47] And now you need another screen in the back box.

[23:51] I don't get it.

[23:52] I don't get it.

[23:53] What point is this it?

[23:55] This is the final variation.

[23:57] How many alterations of P3 do there have to be?

[24:01] You know, I've got, you know, I got a better move.

[24:03] If you want to sell P3 multi-morphics, the best thing he could do is just yank out the

[24:08] big screen in the play field and put a normal play field in there.

[24:11] Higher, good artist, make a normal pinball machine and sell a thousand of them.

[24:17] How about that?

[24:18] Wouldn't that be easier?

[24:19] I know.

[24:20] It's a dream crusher for Jerry.

[24:23] I get it.

[24:25] But ultimately our dreams worth it if the consumers have told you that, you know, they're

[24:30] not buying.

[24:32] His family invested in this business.

[24:34] He could just make a pinball machine and sell it.

[24:37] He's so smart.

[24:39] He's so smart.

[24:41] But he's too smart.

[24:43] He's a smart engineer.

[24:44] He tried to revolutionize something that didn't need revolutionizing.

[24:49] The one part he made a mistake on was the market research.

[24:54] If Stern is selling 10,000 pinball machines the way they do it, why would you reinvent it?

[25:00] It's like, it's like if the bagless vacuum is what everybody wants now.

[25:05] And then you go make a bag vacuum.

[25:08] No one's ever shown they wanted an interchangeable modular pinball experience with a big screen.

[25:15] There's no market research.

[25:16] You literally went all in on an idea you had.

[25:21] And I love Jerry.

[25:22] I love his passion.

[25:23] But at what point do you say it didn't work?

[25:26] And let's just go make a good pinball machine.

[25:28] And I hope they do that one day because I think they will sell an in his knowledge of P3

[25:33] and his knowledge of engineering.

[25:34] And we're seeing a lot of fun engineering in that game, right?

[25:36] I mean, cosmic heart racing, that back modular area looks really freaking cool with all

[25:40] the lights and everything.

[25:41] I would imagine if Jerry could apply his engineering prowess to an entire pinball machine, but in a

[25:47] normal way, where it's a wooden play field, but he's engineering the coolest mechs and everything.

[25:52] See, that's what's so frustrating, right?

[25:54] Is I think Jerry would be the mech fuckingzilla of pinball.

[25:58] I think he would make the coolest engineered things that we've all been craving for in pinball.

[26:04] And yet look, even like his interlocking, like the ball lock and Lexi light speed, that big wheel.

[26:09] How fucking cool is that carousel?

[26:12] He's got all these amazing ideas.

[26:13] It's just the platform is sinking his genius.

[26:18] Does that make sense?

[26:19] And I think if he just said fuck it, guys, took a sledgehammer to all those screened play fields.

[26:26] Let's put something over wood and let's make it magical and we'll succeed.

[26:31] He would.

[26:32] I know he would.

[26:33] All right, spooky.

[26:34] All the scoopers are ready to go.

[26:36] We see them in box.

[26:37] The weather is delaying them a little bit.

[26:39] We hope people get their games soon.

[26:41] I just want people who buy an ounce Cooper to tell me if it's good or not and people who

[26:45] go over to those people's houses to tell us the truth.

[26:48] All right?

[26:49] So I heard a rumor.

[26:50] Maybe it's not a rumor.

[26:51] So I heard stern fire dirty Donnie.

[26:53] I made me didn't fire him, but dirty Donnie was inactive for a while.

[26:57] And he went over and he did artwork for Suncoast Pimball.

[27:01] What is that circus carnival game?

[27:04] So that's dirty Donnie on the art package.

[27:07] I love that one this week in Pimball.

[27:09] They're like, Suncoast Pimball, hi, yes.

[27:13] That's not what I'm here and happened.

[27:14] I'm here and what happened is dirty Donnie had finished Erasmith.

[27:19] He was sort of just hanging around.

[27:21] He wasn't getting put on any of the newer stern projects, but he was still part of stern

[27:27] Pimball.

[27:28] He went off in and did artwork for Suncoast Pimball.

[27:33] Stern saw that and said, see you later, bro.

[27:36] I think that's what happened.

[27:38] I'm again, that's what I heard.

[27:41] If it's wrong, I will clarify that.

[27:43] But that's what I heard happened.

[27:45] Suncoast Pimball's carnival game.

[27:48] I mean, you've seen it, right?

[27:51] Why?

[27:52] Why do people do this?

[27:54] Why do we need a game like that?

[27:58] And I know.

[27:59] I haven't played it.

[28:00] I haven't, I don't know the guys who are working on it.

[28:03] But if you're them, literally, I get if you want to make a game in your basement.

[28:08] But the second you want to make a game to sell to people, you are opening yourself up

[28:13] to comparison and criticism.

[28:16] And I'm going to put you up against what else is out there for the money.

[28:20] So what is this game going to cost?

[28:21] Is it going to cost the price of a stern pro?

[28:23] Okay.

[28:24] When I take a look at that game and I compare it next to like all the stern pro's from

[28:27] the last four or five years, it's no comparison.

[28:31] Which one has more appeal, the stern pro?

[28:34] So I don't understand why these guys do it.

[28:36] Like what leads a man and his friends to say, let's go make a Pimball machine that's

[28:42] not as good as a game that will cost exactly the same price.

[28:47] And it'll be fun and it'll sell because people want something different.

[28:51] I'm here to say to all the boutique dreamers out there, the market is saturated.

[28:57] It's cool.

[28:58] Make a game in your basement, bring it around to show, see if people are interested.

[29:00] Do what Scott and E.C. did.

[29:02] Make one game, see if people like it.

[29:05] And then there are there are enough manufacturers out there that could make your game for you.

[29:11] Isn't that the smarter approach?

[29:14] Why would you try and make a new company, make it all yourself, make it not as good as

[29:20] what's available and then expect it to be successful?

[29:25] Am I just a jerk?

[29:27] Am I looking at this hobby all wrong?

[29:28] Am I too negative?

[29:31] Should I just get industry people on my show, interview them and let them tell you exactly

[29:35] what you expect them to say?

[29:36] Or should I say stuff like this?

[29:38] All right.

[29:39] That's just my take on it.

[29:40] I don't want more mediocre pinball.

[29:42] I'm tired of it.

[29:44] All right.

[29:45] So speaking of Stern, monsters is almost out.

[29:49] They are shipping the pro.

[29:50] I guess it is out.

[29:51] The L is going on the line next week.

[29:53] I just want to say something about all the monsters back and forth.

[29:56] And if you ordered a monster and you're excited, I got some advice for you.

[30:00] Just don't go on pin side until you get your game.

[30:04] I sort of do feel bad for people who order their game.

[30:08] And all they do is they get inundated with an army of people who have never played the

[30:16] game telling them the game is shit.

[30:18] Telling them the game is simple.

[30:19] Telling them the game is got cheap targets.

[30:22] Telling them this.

[30:23] Telling them that the code's not there.

[30:25] It's no depth.

[30:26] It's too easy to get to wizard mode.

[30:27] I've read so many complaints by people that I know have never played the game.

[30:34] And then you ordered the game and you're excited to get your toy and you've already, it's

[30:37] already been shit on by so many people.

[30:40] So annoying.

[30:41] I think when you order a game that you are excited to play, the best thing you could possibly

[30:45] do, the best thing you could possibly do is just turn off pin side until your game ships

[30:51] and you'll be much happier.

[30:53] It is people talk themselves into an endless swirl of reasons why you made a mistake.

[31:02] It's never reasons why you made a good decision.

[31:05] Now I know that most of you are not affected probably by that constant bitching and moaning

[31:10] because the LEDs of the monsters sold out.

[31:14] So it's turned into something right.

[31:16] People want it.

[31:17] I think the premiums are going to sell well.

[31:19] Whether or not it's a game worth owning is always the hardest question.

[31:24] You know someone was saying like yeah, you buy a game.

[31:27] If you sell it, you're not going to lose much move on.

[31:30] For some people that's easy.

[31:32] It's easy from a financial standpoint.

[31:34] It's also easy from a logistical standpoint.

[31:37] Moving a game in and out of my apartment is really hard.

[31:40] Some of you guys moving a game in and out of your game rooms isn't easy.

[31:43] You don't want to constantly be paying for shippers to come and pack it up and send it somewhere

[31:49] else.

[31:50] It's a lot more fun when you have a game that isn't going anywhere that's working well.

[31:54] So look, that's my advice.

[31:56] I want to play the monsters.

[31:58] I've heard everything from it's the best game ever.

[32:00] It's so much fun too.

[32:01] It's a shallow game that gets boring quickly and there's not much to do and yada yada yada.

[32:08] It's like who's right?

[32:10] You know, you get these like completely polar opposite opinions.

[32:13] So someone's got to be is the answer in the middle probably.

[32:16] I saw they have new code that just dropped point nine one.

[32:19] I have to say I wish Stern would just wait until there were significant code updates.

[32:23] There's not much in this one.

[32:25] There's like a midnight madness and something else.

[32:27] A few timer adjustments.

[32:30] I don't want there to be like a new code update every point one increase or point a one

[32:36] increase, right?

[32:37] So it's like point nine.

[32:38] No point nine one point nine two point nine three.

[32:42] It just wait Stern and give us code when there's like significant updates because as someone

[32:48] who had update Batman like multiple times, it just kind of gets unless there's a lot

[32:54] to notice.

[32:55] It's just annoying to have to like erase all your scores and constantly update your code.

[32:58] But look, we will not bitch about code updates on this show because code a code updates

[33:04] are in that column of that's a good thing in pinball.

[33:06] All right.

[33:07] All right.

[33:08] I don't know if I'm missing anyone else.

[33:09] Nothing really new at home pin.

[33:10] Dutch pinball, nothing new.

[33:12] A couple of things.

[33:13] I just saw an alien pinball machine for sale for $17,000.

[33:18] Alien Ali in good condition with spare parts $17,000.

[33:27] So seeing the wrath of Olympus for $25,000, alien for $17,000, will somebody pay it?

[33:34] I don't know.

[33:35] Probably there's some alien fanatic out there who really wants one.

[33:40] The problem is the people who really want it got burned by highway.

[33:44] So that person's not just spending $17,000.

[33:46] They're spending the $6,500 on top of that that they've maybe lost in the company.

[33:52] The whole thing is it's just a game that I get that you guys you own it.

[33:56] Love it, but how do you not feel bad about owning it?

[34:01] And I think if you got one at a decent price, cool.

[34:06] I think the guy that spends $17,000 on one is not cool.

[34:11] Because I think you're you're never going to feel great about spending that much on a

[34:16] game that who knows if you can keep it running for a long time.

[34:20] I know people are making spare parts on it.

[34:22] I think the big the big thing I'd be afraid of and someone said this with Dutch pinball

[34:26] is big Lebowski.

[34:27] I just be afraid someone's going to make another alien game.

[34:32] I think if I'm stern, the license is so strong and stern or someone else like deep

[34:40] rude, I think they should go make alien and make it better.

[34:44] That game is I get why people love that game.

[34:46] The atmospheric elements of that game, but the art is crap.

[34:51] I don't think the layout is great.

[34:53] I was not nearly as many toys as there should be for a game based on the alien franchise.

[34:57] And I would I would not spend $17,000 on a game like that.

[35:02] I'm at the point now where if you're going to go high end on a game, I just think it has

[35:07] to be a game that has a good story behind it, not a bad one.

[35:12] And then that's just my my take on it.

[35:14] All right, do I want to read emails?

[35:15] I don't want to show you to go too long.

[35:17] I have to do work.

[35:18] I'm going to get freaking fired because I owe ideas in an hour and a half.

[35:21] This is the sacrifice I make.

[35:24] You know what I'm going to do?

[35:25] I'm going to end that here because I want you to have a shorter snackable show.

[35:29] You guys have been sending me a bunch of emails.

[35:31] What I'm going to do is tomorrow on the final day of Twippy Voting.

[35:34] I'll do another podcast in which I read the latest emails I've received from you.

[35:38] So if you want to make a statement, if you want to say anything to me, I am going to do

[35:43] an entire episode again tomorrow of just reading some of your feedback on the show.

[35:49] Little snackable show tomorrow on the final day of Twippy Voting.

[35:52] So that's your chance to email me at canadapimbalatgmail.com.

[35:56] Tell me how you feel.

[35:58] Tell me what you think about my assessment of these companies, these games, am I right?

[36:01] Am I wrong?

[36:03] Should I go way?

[36:05] Should I be sponsored by Penn Stadium?

[36:09] You know, so I really, really, really would love to hear from you.

[36:13] Okay, everyone, have a great, what is it?

[36:15] Wednesday?

[36:16] God.

[36:17] Super Bowl this week.

[36:18] So exciting.

[36:19] I have to plan my food.

[36:21] Everyone have a great day.

[36:23] Enjoy your Pimbal machines.

[36:24] Enjoy this podcast and we'll talk to you again real soon.
