[00:00] All right, open your boxes.

[00:02] Open your boxes, why?

[00:03] Two, three!

[00:17] Go to your機!

[00:18] STOP!

[00:25] I was a small family-run business.

[00:28] in Benton, Wisconsin, with absolutely no marketing department.

[00:34] How are they showing the entire pinball industry how to launch a pinball machine?

[00:43] And I'm going to say this right now, the launch of Rick and Morty Pinball and the sequence

[00:49] of events that have occurred since the trailer video in which nobody was expecting it to

[00:56] seeing the game from the underneath of the play field to seeing a funny video of the

[01:02] game for the first time to opening up the order books to get a blood-sucker edition and

[01:09] the fang club to now this news.

[01:13] Well you can even add in that they're going to have content from later on in the series

[01:18] added to the game to this news last night.

[01:23] Nobody expected this.

[01:24] And I'll say this, the number one thing you always want to do in marketing to create

[01:29] customer satisfaction and customer loyalty is to give the customer something more than

[01:36] they expected.

[01:39] And I think what we're witnessing now is an absolute realization and a waking up of

[01:45] so many people in this hobby to the very simple fact of are you being treated by your pinball

[01:54] company the way you want to be treated?

[01:57] Are you being treated by big business mentality or are you being catered to and cared for by

[02:05] a family?

[02:06] I mean that's what it feels like with what spooky pinball is doing here and the shocking

[02:10] announcement last night that every single person, every single person who bought a Rick and

[02:17] Morty pinball machine is going to get a free interactive topper with a DC motor and LED

[02:25] lights.

[02:26] It looks like it's going to be the portal spinning which is going to be super cool and

[02:30] the crystals are going to light up every single person who bought a game is going to get

[02:35] one for free.

[02:37] And let's deconstruct this magnanimous move by by chucking company over there because I

[02:43] think most people were just expecting maybe a t-shirt or a keychain or maybe another sculpted

[02:49] figure in the game.

[02:51] Nobody was expecting they would get something like this and it's funny because 2019 was

[02:58] really the year of topper gate and you look at toppers and pinball machines and it's become

[03:05] something that cosmetically people really like to get in their games.

[03:08] But toppers are also a really cool thing when you do it right.

[03:11] But there are also something that has become ridiculously expensive and for a lot of people

[03:16] in pinball who have followed pinball over the years getting a really cool topper on a game

[03:22] used to be standard right.

[03:24] It was standard on games like white water.

[03:27] I mean look at the white water topper that came with the game wasn't an additional $500

[03:30] item.

[03:31] To the point in 2019 where Stern releases an R2D2 topper at something like $750 right

[03:40] and then makes you pay additional for it where we get Jersey Jack pinball charging people

[03:46] additional for the chocolate river topper.

[03:49] Spooky pinball says nope our toppers actually going to do more than a lot of those toppers

[03:54] and it's going to cost you nothing.

[03:57] And everybody gets one doesn't matter if you order to standard edition or blood sucker

[04:02] edition.

[04:03] Anyone who ordered on day one which was everybody gets one of the toppers.

[04:08] Now I don't know if this was planned or not but I don't really care and I don't think

[04:12] anybody cares.

[04:14] I think this just goes to show that Charlie and company they're trying to do one thing

[04:19] and I don't think like they're trying to I think this comes natural to them right now

[04:24] and they're creating customers for life.

[04:28] And if you're Charlie and you've got to boot a boutique pinball company that you're happy

[04:34] with the size of it and you maybe don't want to grow too large.

[04:39] If you do this and you create good will you're going to create customers for life.

[04:46] People are going to come back to you and want to buy every game from you because of how

[04:51] you've treated them and what you did for them.

[04:55] And all this is really incredible because we haven't really seen any pinball companies

[05:00] quite do it this way.

[05:02] And it's everything combined.

[05:04] It's not just like a topper.

[05:06] It's not just a good theme.

[05:08] It's not just the transparency of the company.

[05:12] It's all of those things combined.

[05:15] You know when you think about Stern pinball they're so big.

[05:18] They're a ginormous ship.

[05:20] They keep going.

[05:21] As Gary Stern said the other day they have 85% or more of the pinball market.

[05:28] But everyone knows deep down they just kept this feeling that like on an individual

[05:32] level do you really think that the higher ups and the investors at Stern pinball really

[05:38] give a damn if they lose you as a customer.

[05:40] And I think people know that like Stern pinball is so big that if they lose you as a customer

[05:45] it doesn't mean anything to them.

[05:46] You don't get the feeling that it would mean anything to them.

[05:48] They would just find some newbie guy who has no idea about pinball and they'll sell them

[05:53] a game.

[05:54] I mean that's the majority of Stern's new buyers.

[05:56] It's not pinball enthusiasts.

[05:59] It's just newbies to the hobby.

[06:01] And there's always going to be a hundred of those newbies to every one of us.

[06:05] And I say us because we're like the enthusiasts.

[06:08] Like we're the people that are on the websites that are on the podcast that are going to

[06:14] shows.

[06:15] Like we're the minority.

[06:16] We're not the majority of people who buy a new inbox pinball machines.

[06:19] And for us, for us the enthusiast you know we really want to see companies that care

[06:26] about us.

[06:28] Because if you think about it, who's advocating for pinball?

[06:31] Who's spreading the love of pinball?

[06:33] Who's getting their friends into pinball?

[06:35] It's us.

[06:36] It's us.

[06:37] I mean we do so much to awaken this hobby within our friends, within other people we know,

[06:44] within coworkers.

[06:45] I mean we talk about pinball.

[06:46] We spread the gospel of pinball.

[06:49] And all we ever want from these pinball companies is just to get this feeling like you

[06:54] know what?

[06:55] Like it matters to them that we remain customers with them.

[07:00] And look, I think Jersey Jack has done a good job in building a loyal following with

[07:06] his community as well.

[07:08] Right?

[07:09] Jack's been very transparent.

[07:10] Now I don't always feel like Jack always tells the truth.

[07:13] And I think that comes back to bite him.

[07:15] People still have not received their replacement playfields yet.

[07:18] They're still getting some spin over there about how well we want to get enough orders

[07:22] to before we actually, no, no, no, no, no.

[07:26] What's going on with that whole thing?

[07:27] I mean we're going to keep following that topic.

[07:29] People still have not received the replacement Jersey Jack playfields.

[07:33] How hard can it be to reach out?

[07:35] It wasn't like we're not talking, you know, 10,000 buyers here.

[07:38] So we're going to keep on them to make sure people get the replacement playfields because

[07:43] it's been months and months and months.

[07:45] And we know it does not take six months to order playfields for people.

[07:49] So a little bit of a stall tactic, I think going on over there.

[07:51] But anyway, spooky pinball has done the greatest pinball launch since I've been covering pinball.

[07:56] And I think they deserve to be applauded for it.

[07:59] And once again, you know, the tell of these two threads continues to be the championship

[08:04] winning team over at spooky pinball.

[08:06] And then, you know, the stranger things thread continues.

[08:09] It's funny to me because, you know, Jack Danger put up a video of the stranger things premium.

[08:15] And he announced to us that they're going to be streaming at Thursday night at some point.

[08:20] I hope it's late at night so they can get as dark as possible.

[08:24] But he pulled the shades down in the room and he showed us the game.

[08:28] And you know, like I think people are starting to realize, I really do that it's, it's,

[08:33] I look, I don't think it's going to be horrible, but I don't think it's going to, the juice

[08:38] is not going to be worth the squeeze on this technology.

[08:41] And I think people are starting to realize that that, well, wait a minute, you probably

[08:45] could have created an even cooler upside down effect with just basic lighting.

[08:52] Like look at the disco ball and in Deadpool, like you could have, they could have done something

[08:56] a lot easier to get that effect in the game and then used more of the real estate in the

[09:01] game for physical things that would have wowed people.

[09:04] I think people are also coming to the realization as stranger things enters into the pinside

[09:09] top 100 today.

[09:10] Okay.

[09:11] It entered in.

[09:12] I know there's only 17 reviews, but it entered in at number 111.

[09:19] Now, I think this is the, the highest number ever for a new Stern machine to enter into

[09:26] the top 100.

[09:27] And so I think there's just a lot of people out there.

[09:31] Maybe it's like a silent majority of people out there that are just not feeling the game.

[09:37] And maybe spooky launch of Rick and Morty had something to do with it within our community,

[09:42] right, the enthusiast community.

[09:44] Maybe the Stern shills out there, haven't been successful enough in emberating us and

[09:50] trying to convince us that we just have to like it because it comes from Stern.

[09:54] You know, and so I think what's happening here, I think Stern pinball is learning a little

[10:00] bit of a lesson.

[10:02] And I mean that when I say this, I really do mean that I think they are learning a lesson

[10:06] that we've seen enough of this, of just major theme that people love like Game of Thrones,

[10:15] like Star Wars, you know, we have seen them do this before where they take a beloved

[10:21] theme, a dream theme for many of people and they just give us an underwhelming package.

[10:28] And it's not, it's not what people really want it.

[10:32] And I know it's hard for people to say that.

[10:34] I mean, I just, I hear other podcasters telling me to shut up.

[10:38] But you know, you know, who's like, you know, actually has a good, his finger on the

[10:42] pulse of this thing is Hilton.

[10:44] I mean, I listen to his comments and he's right.

[10:46] Like that left kick out in stranger things pinball where it just, it just kicks it out

[10:53] in an underwhelming way and it maybe graces a stand up target or two.

[10:58] And that's all it does.

[11:00] And then you've got the other, the other like up kick, you know, to the left of the screen

[11:05] that the ball goes in there and then it just like farts it out the left.

[11:09] And then the pop bumpers you can't even see like there's really nothing in the game.

[11:14] They're and it's like, it's like, I don't know when people are going to admit this.

[11:17] Now look, we're still holding out hope and we're still holding out our final assessment

[11:23] of this game until we see the projector in action.

[11:26] And I think that's the only fair thing to do.

[11:29] But man, I'm telling you, I'm also holding back a little bit on my final assessment of

[11:33] stranger things because I'm going to tell you right now, no projector in the world.

[11:38] No, I don't care what that thing does.

[11:42] It's not going to change the fact that I just think that when you play stranger things,

[11:46] as much as like distributors are telling you they, I've been playing it to two in the

[11:51] morning.

[11:52] I'm just having so much damn fun.

[11:53] Let me tell you the show itself, if you've watched the show, there is a level of

[11:58] campiness and enjoyment and fun factor in that show that just is not in the pin.

[12:05] The pin is like the serious elements of the show and it focuses on that.

[12:10] But it misses out on so much of the personality and the campiness and look, maybe that's

[12:15] to come.

[12:16] Maybe they're going to code that.

[12:17] But you know what I'm saying is like this released to me.

[12:20] And when I hear them say like, well, we didn't want to show the projector yet because even

[12:24] Jack Janger says it is like, there's stuff they're still coding and it just begs the question.

[12:30] Why would they launch this game if they still need to code things that make that major mechanism

[12:38] in the game if they don't even know, if they don't even have in the game yet, the stuff

[12:45] that makes that thing worthwhile, then why was it released?

[12:49] I mean, am I the only one who just looks at this stuff and is just like, I don't understand

[12:54] why would you release it if you can't properly showcase the technology?

[12:59] And you can't do it like this anymore.

[13:01] I think people are starting to wake the F up is like, we are so tired of Stern Pimball

[13:07] releasing unfinished products, unfinished products in which they can't show us whether

[13:13] not the game is good or bad or mediocre, great or excellent or terrible.

[13:18] We're not allowed to have enough assets or coding or even like streams now, they're not

[13:26] giving us enough information to make up our minds and they want our money already.

[13:32] And I think it's absolutely, we're just tired of it.

[13:35] Now look, playing Devils Advocate, it's like, yeah, Spooky Pimball hasn't shown you Rick

[13:39] and Morty flipping yet, but it's such a different launch and everybody knows that.

[13:46] Like everybody knows that.

[13:48] Everyone can see the Scott and E.C. design.

[13:50] Everyone understands that the Rick and Morty creator is like making all these custom callouts

[13:55] for the game itself.

[13:57] And people just have faith in Scott and E.C. the same way they have faith in Keith L.

[14:01] Win.

[14:02] But I don't think people have faith.

[14:04] I'm going to say this.

[14:05] I don't think people have faith in Stern Pimball unless the game is coming from Keith L.

[14:11] Win.

[14:12] I mean, think about it right now.

[14:13] Where does your faith lie?

[14:15] Maybe George Gomez too, right?

[14:17] But he doesn't design many games.

[14:20] Maybe John Borg.

[14:21] But Keith L. Win's the only one that's like, take my money now, guy with Stern.

[14:25] And it's just, I just think Stern is, you know, Stern is like, burns people too many times

[14:30] in being the guinea pigs on these games.

[14:33] And people got burned with monsters.

[14:35] People got burned with black night.

[14:36] People have gone in and gone after and chased the tail of the dragon.

[14:42] And more times than none now, you're losing money on your Stern purchases.

[14:47] And people know that.

[14:49] And I think people are just waking up.

[14:51] I mean, I think it's pretty obvious that Stranger Things is going to be a game that does

[14:56] not hold its value.

[14:57] And I know we shouldn't talk about value.

[14:59] But it's not even that.

[15:00] I think it's not going to hold its value because it's not the kind of game that if you're

[15:05] a fanatic of Stranger Things, I don't think it's going to have long term fun for you.

[15:10] I don't.

[15:11] I just don't.

[15:12] I really don't.

[15:13] I think something happened with this game.

[15:16] They just didn't put a lot in it.

[15:18] And I don't know how you look at this and they're like, I'm just having a lot of fun.

[15:21] Like this is some so sick of like the short term, like, yeah, the shots are smooth and

[15:26] that's all it requires.

[15:27] No, people want more.

[15:29] People want more at this money.

[15:31] And this game is going to go the same route as Star Wars.

[15:35] It's going to go the same route as Game of Thrones.

[15:39] And if you buy one for $9,000 and you buy an LE, congratulations.

[15:43] You're going to be selling that game for $7,500 in six months.

[15:47] And I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now, Ninja Turtles is just going

[15:52] to blow this thing away.

[15:53] And I don't even care if you don't like Ninja Turtles.

[15:56] I think way to you see the Ninja Turtles package, it is going to be the greatest artistic

[16:02] masterpiece of all time in Pimble.

[16:05] It is.

[16:06] It is.

[16:07] And everyone I know who's seen Stranger Things and Ninja Turtles is like, dude, it is like

[16:12] embarrassingly better than Stranger Things.

[16:16] Who doesn't want you to know that?

[16:19] Think about it right now.

[16:20] Who doesn't want you to know that?

[16:21] Well, the Stern Shills right now on Pinside, you know who they are, who are just like it's

[16:25] going to be epic.

[16:26] Don't listen to K-Man.

[16:27] I already ordered my LE.

[16:28] So everyone who ordered an LE, they're going to try to convince you otherwise.

[16:32] The Stern Distributors right now are sitting on all this Stranger Things product and all

[16:36] these orders and they, you know, they want to sell it.

[16:39] They want to sell it to you.

[16:40] And I'm just here to tell you that if you just wait, you're going to be able to get all

[16:43] these Stranger Things games from much less money.

[16:46] And everyone knows it's true.

[16:48] Just think about it.

[16:49] They're still available.

[16:50] The L.E.'s have still not sold out.

[16:52] I'm telling you right now, when people see Ninja Turtles' LE, it's going to sell out in

[16:57] one day.

[16:58] And I'm just telling you, I'm just Art alone.

[17:01] I'm just Art alone.

[17:02] They will sell out in one day, but it's also a game in which John Borg has confirmed

[17:07] they took nothing out of the game.

[17:10] They did not remove anything.

[17:12] He actually had leftover bomb in this game.

[17:14] He got everything he wanted into it.

[17:17] And you know, you don't want to know why else, like Ninja Turtles, besides like the most

[17:20] incredible art package besides this besides that, you know what it also it's going to have,

[17:24] it may have internet connectivity.

[17:26] But what's even cooler, I think, is when you play Ninja Turtles, here's another news

[17:32] item for you guys, just make sure you credit Canada.

[17:35] Ninja Turtles is going to come with four player co-op mode, which means when you have three

[17:43] of your friends over, you each can play collectively and collaborate to go through the game.

[17:51] And each of you is a different Ninja Turtle.

[17:53] It makes total sense.

[17:55] Raphael Donatello, Michelangelo Leonardo.

[17:59] And so you can play a four player co-op game and play through the game that way.

[18:03] Super freaking cool, right?

[18:05] Right?

[18:06] And that actually makes me feel like, well, if they have internet connection, then why couldn't,

[18:10] then that makes sense.

[18:12] That makes sense that you wouldn't be, you know, imagine that.

[18:15] Like you're not competing against the other people that your internet connected to, but

[18:20] you're actually co-op playing with them.

[18:22] How awesome would that be?

[18:23] All right?

[18:24] I'm just saying like, I'm getting tired, right?

[18:27] It's the middle of January.

[18:29] Stern releases game three something weeks ago.

[18:32] They're still like floundering to get us like the actual like footage of what it looks.

[18:38] It's a joke launch, people.

[18:40] It's a total joke launch.

[18:43] And Rick and Morty, that's how you do it.

[18:46] That's how you do it.

[18:47] Look at the excitement level.

[18:49] It's just, I know we keep talking about this, but man, this is the big thing going on in

[18:53] Pimball now.

[18:54] Like I don't need to do a two hour podcast in which after 30 minutes of news, there's

[18:58] like another hour and 20 minutes of just like ramble.

[19:02] I'm just saying right now, we're witnessing what I think is the greatest launch in Pimball

[19:08] that I've seen.

[19:09] And I think we're witnessing one of the worst launches in Pimball at the same exact time.

[19:14] That's why I love doing this podcast because it's like, and I don't care.

[19:18] I don't care if like Brian Eddie doesn't come on the show.

[19:20] I don't care if like it's, it's the worst launch ever.

[19:22] It deserved better.

[19:25] It's like Stern doesn't know how to show this game to people.

[19:27] What a joke.

[19:29] What a freaking joke.

[19:30] And the shills on Pinside can keep saying, oh, don't worry about it.

[19:33] It's going to be epic.

[19:34] It's not going to be epic.

[19:36] I'm telling you, when you look at that rotating arcade sign that's projected, it looks like

[19:40] crap.

[19:41] Wouldn't you rather have a physical rotating arcade sign?

[19:44] Now here's the thing.

[19:46] A real physical rotating arcade sign is coming out, okay?

[19:50] But here's the problem now.

[19:52] If you put a physical rotating arcade sign in the Stranger Things game, all these mods,

[19:56] right?

[19:57] How stupid is it going to look where you've got a physical rotating arcade sign and then

[20:02] a projected one?

[20:03] You got two arcade signs rotating in the game.

[20:06] That's going to look idiotic.

[20:09] They should have made this game a more physical representation of the world we love in Stranger

[20:15] Things.

[20:16] Instead, they went all in on a gimmick that I don't think is going to pan out.

[20:21] But we'll know for sure on Thursday, but I'm telling you right now, the apologist that

[20:27] want you to think this game is going to be great.

[20:29] I'm just saying, be cautious.

[20:31] There's a reason why this game isn't blowing people away.

[20:35] Do me a favor, everybody.

[20:36] Go open up a picture of Ghostbusters, Ellie, and put it next to Stranger Things, Ellie.

[20:42] Just do that.

[20:43] Do that for a minute and see what a physical world under glass looks like with a lot going

[20:48] on in it and one that has absolutely nothing going on that's just going to project more

[20:53] images onto the game.

[20:55] Projection mapping is the future of Bimbal.

[20:57] Yeah, it's not.

[20:59] It's not this game.

[21:01] I don't know.

[21:02] I don't know, Stern.

[21:03] You're trying stuff.

[21:06] It's not always going to work.

[21:07] I'm glad you guys keep making these games, but you need to look at what Spooky's doing and

[21:12] how they're treating the customers and what they're giving people.

[21:16] I mean, for $15,000 people, you didn't even get a free topper with Elvira.

[21:23] Where is the Elvira topper?

[21:25] Where is the Jurassic Park topper?

[21:27] I mean, Stern can't even get these toppers out within six months of the game being available.

[21:31] It's a joke.

[21:33] We're sick of it.

[21:34] They're moving at the speed of the investors.

[21:37] They're moving at the speed of their line.

[21:39] We're getting left behind people.

[21:41] We are.

[21:42] We listen to this podcast.

[21:44] All of the Stern execs listen to this show.

[21:49] You know who really appreciates this show the most?

[21:51] I'm just going to say it.

[21:53] Are the designers at Stern?

[21:55] This show says what they feel.

[21:58] If you get Stern designers in a room, they'll tell you.

[22:00] If you get a couple beers in them, they'll tell you that they have not lost the creative

[22:06] magic they had in the 90s.

[22:07] They haven't.

[22:08] They're actually better now than they were then.

[22:10] They have more at their disposal.

[22:13] What they're running into is the cheapness and the corner cutting of Stern's investors.

[22:19] They will tell you that behind closed doors with a few beers in them.

[22:24] This podcast will tell you that most of the time what you're getting from Brian Eddie

[22:29] with this game, that's not what he, you think that's what he wanted?

[22:32] You think Brian Eddie, a guy who has designed some of the coolest stuff ever in Pimble.

[22:36] You really think that that left kick out is what he wanted there?

[22:41] Are you serious?

[22:43] You think this is all he could do?

[22:45] He ran out of money clearly.

[22:47] That is, I mean, why isn't that kick out?

[22:50] At least like a scoop that fires the ball out with more intensity and with more drama and

[22:55] more feeling.

[22:56] It's just like it's getting farted out the left side of the game.

[23:00] Bye bye bye.

[23:01] Zach, we don't buy it.

[23:02] I know you're up to two in the morning.

[23:04] Can't get enough.

[23:05] I can't get enough.

[23:07] Love you brother, but man, come on.

[23:09] We've seen what they can do.

[23:11] We've seen what these designers can do.

[23:13] You think this is it?

[23:15] Come on.

[23:16] I can't wait to Thursday.

[23:17] Thursday is going to be a moment.

[23:18] I mean, we already know what's going to be projected there.

[23:21] I don't understand what people are expecting to happen.

[23:24] It's like they're expecting the entire game to flip upside down and all of a sudden

[23:26] like, oh wow, that's what it was all about.

[23:29] So let's see people.

[23:31] Congratulations, Chuck.

[23:33] You've shown everyone how it's done.

[23:36] One pinball, you need to wake up a little bit.

[23:38] Deep root pinball, take some notes on all this.

[23:41] This is how you do it.

[23:42] This is how you do it.

[23:44] Who else is out there?

[23:46] Who else can, you know, I don't even know.

[23:47] Man, I'm not feeling that well.

[23:49] Can you tell?

[23:50] Am I going a little crazy?

[23:51] But anyway, everyone, if you, here's the thing.

[23:53] If you have been joined, and most of you probably have, if you have been joined, Canadian

[23:57] face, Canadian pinball podcast, Facebook page, I think you should join it.

[24:01] We have over 800 people following the Facebook page.

[24:05] I upload a lot of funny content there.

[24:07] We have a lot of debate there in conversation there.

[24:09] I don't get as many emails anymore because of that.

[24:12] But I actually think you'll enjoy following Canadian pinball podcast on Facebook.

[24:17] So please, everybody do that.

[24:19] All right.

[24:20] All right.

[24:21] What else are we going to talk about?

[24:22] I don't know.

[24:23] I don't know.

[24:24] Let's just let the show go there.

[24:25] Everyone, I can't believe we're getting free toppers.

[24:28] I'm so excited.

[24:29] I'm getting a low number.

[24:30] I'm going to let you know when I get it.

[24:32] But it's happening.

[24:33] It should happen by the end of February.

[24:34] Can you do the math on that one?

[24:35] Erie, everyone, have a great day.

[24:37] Canadian pinball out.
