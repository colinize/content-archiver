[00:00] Everybody's working for the weekend.

[00:07] Everybody wants a new romance.

[00:13] Everybody's going off the deep end.

[00:20] Everybody needs a second chance.

[00:23] Welcome, everybody, to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcaster working on Labor Day.

[00:35] We got a great show for each and every one of you. But before we do that, I want to thank some new

[00:41] members to the Canada Club and some of you out there that have been upping your membership's Rodney C.

[00:48] Went from 30 bucks a month to a $50 a month membership. Rodney, thank you so much.

[00:55] Will B went from $5 to $10 a month. Let's welcome some new members. We also got A-Rod went from $5

[01:04] to $10 a month. Welcome to the show, Shane. Welcome to the show. Let's see. We got new members, Matthew,

[01:13] Andy Palmer, Craig Young, Steve Haskell, Edwin, Robert F., Mike, Monaj Mohan. Welcome to

[01:22] Canada's Pinball Podcast, everybody. It is Labor Day week and we're all waiting on Star Wars. I'm

[01:30] here to tell you right now. It's going to be next Monday or Tuesday. The media day is on the Wednesday.

[01:39] I would have liked to have seen it this week. Everybody's off. Everybody's drinking. It is the

[01:47] perfect time to reveal the game. They should have revealed it today. They should have said,

[01:51] on Labor Day, get ready. And here's the part I don't like. And again, I don't understand

[01:58] modern pinball marketing. We still don't know the exact date and time by which this game will be

[02:07] revealed. Why? You've been working on it for over a year or two. You've got the licensing deal in

[02:13] place. And so your marketing team hasn't even set the release date or the reveal time. Everybody

[02:21] should have it on their calendar. And we're a week away and nobody knows. It's maybe the eighth or the

[02:27] ninth. That's what I got from people over at Stern Pinball. Really? It's a rolling release. It's in

[02:33] flux. I don't understand it. I don't get it. It would have been perfect to reveal it this week.

[02:39] There's no hype right now. The hype thread, because everybody already knows it, Star Wars,

[02:44] is dead. It's only 10 pages long and nobody cares anymore. You teased it with Star Wars and then

[02:51] you hit with nothing. John Borg's out there playing old games. We know it's John Borg. We know it's

[02:57] Star Wars. You could have at least done a new element of the game every few days just to get us

[03:04] excited, just to keep it going. That being said, it is Star Wars. I still think they're going to sell

[03:11] all 770 LEs. But I also think Stern needs to make the LEs special. You go back, you look at the Ghost

[03:19] Busters LE. Go look at that pamphlet. Go look at the Batman 66 LE. I don't think there's been a

[03:26] really wow take my money now LE since when was the last one? Think about it. I think actually Ghost

[03:36] Busters was really the last LE that just blew us away. It wasn't Jaws. We had debates around the

[03:45] white armor. It wasn't Godzilla. It wasn't anything James Bond. It wasn't Foo Fighters. Stern has made

[03:54] the biggest mistake on its LEs recently. The last four to five years, they have not made their LEs

[04:02] truly stand out. I mean, go look at Foo Fighter. It's the same damn art package. They just changed

[04:08] like the red to the green. Same art package. All these games are looking the same. James Bond,

[04:14] LE looks exactly like the premium. Even the trim is like the same. They just haven't gone above and

[04:21] beyond. Metallica remastered LE. That LE looked a lot different than the premium and that's why

[04:28] people gobbled it up. So it's a golden opportunity here for Stern Pinball to bring back and restore

[04:36] what makes an LE an LE. Are they going to do it? Here's my bet. Nope. I don't think they're going to

[04:42] do it. I think Star Wars Pro is going to look almost as good as Star Wars LE even though it's

[04:48] half the price. Okay. So here's what I want to do for you on this episode. I want to give you some

[04:52] exclusive confirmation news. Nobody else is saying this. It's coming at you directly from

[04:58] Canada and it is about Big Bang Bar. I'm here to confirm for each and every one of you that Big

[05:05] Bang Bar is coming back. It will most likely be revealed to the world this year, maybe as early

[05:13] as Pinball Expo in October. The company making Big Bang Bar remake is Padready Gaming. They have

[05:21] the license. They are working with Rick at Planetary on this game. Not that surprising. They made the

[05:28] Funhouse remakes that nobody really wanted. And the reason this is happening, let me give you some

[05:34] backstory because you know it's an interesting history, this Big Bang Bar. It's always been like

[05:39] a game out there in the world that was super rare. They only made one prototype and then Gene

[05:48] Cunningham went and basically it killed him. He spent his whole life remaking this game and

[05:55] getting it to the price. I think he sold the remakes. I think he made 214 remakes of Big

[06:01] Bang Bar for something like $5,500 or $4,500. It was basically over a decade-long journey.

[06:09] For him to remake this game. But the story is very interesting. So back in the day, I want to say

[06:15] it's like 1998. Let's go back then. There were two companies making Pinball. Balli Williams and Capcom

[06:24] was also making Pinball machines. Now something interesting happened. I might be like paraphrasing

[06:30] a little bit, but employees from Williams went over to Capcom. And at the same time, these companies

[06:38] both came out with similar games. Williams came out with Theater of Magic and Capcom people who

[06:45] had worked at Williams who knew that, they came out to compete with that with Pinball Magic. So

[06:51] Williams comes out with Theater of Magic and Capcom comes out with Pinball Magic. Now they get in a

[06:56] lawsuit over this and then there's a settlement. So these two companies are like connected. Now

[07:01] Big Bang Bar was originally designed by Balli Williams. How many of you knew that? I didn't

[07:08] really know this. And so when they made Cactus Canyon and then Balli Williams sort of like went

[07:14] out of business and stopped making Pinball, then Capcom got the license to make Big Bang Bar. And

[07:22] we all know the story there. They just made a handful. I forget how many like eight prototypes.

[07:28] It wasn't that many. Maybe it was one prototype and the company went out of business. Well,

[07:33] the company didn't go out of business. They just stopped making Pinball machines. Capcom is still

[07:37] alive and well today. Obviously Street Fighter, the big franchise for Capcom. So Gene goes and

[07:43] makes these games, makes 214 Big Bang Bar remakes. They are made to the specifications of the prototype.

[07:51] They take forever. He gets them out. You know, they are beautiful pins and they become instant

[07:57] collectors items in a world in which there's so much of everything. There is only 214 Big Bang

[08:04] Bars in the world on the second hand market. I've seen these things go anywhere from 18,000 all the

[08:11] way up to $30,000 to have a mint Big Bang Bar is to have a unique game in your collection,

[08:20] especially nowadays where nothing feels collectible. This is a very sort of coveted game by Pinball

[08:28] Collectors. It's not the greatest game ever, but it is a fun game and the adult theme and the adult

[08:36] nature of this game makes it really cool and it's stunning. If you've ever stood over a Big Bang Bar,

[08:43] it really does stand out in a lineup. Okay, now fast forward to today. What's happened with

[08:50] Rick in Planetary makes sense. So Rick has all of these licenses. He has all of these properties

[08:57] that he can remake back from the Bally Williams days and he's worked with CGC to remake games like

[09:04] Monster Bash, Cactus Canyon, Medieval Madness and Attack from Mars. Now he's got a lot more

[09:11] licenses than that. The thing is CGC is really slow. I don't have to tell you that. So if you're

[09:16] Rick and you want to remake all of these games, Toten, Theater of Magic, Funhouse, all these games,

[09:24] Twilight Zone, you can't give them all to CGC because CGC is so slow. So he's dividing and he's

[09:33] giving some themes to CGC. The next will be Twilight Zone. Toten and Big Bang Bar are going to be

[09:41] remade by Padready Gaming. Now, I know what you're thinking and here's the issue though, right? Is

[09:48] CGC took those Bally Williams classic games and made them better. Everything about the CGC remake

[09:56] is better than the original. Padready Gaming doesn't make games as good as CGC. They might not

[10:03] make you wait as long, but in the end all you really want is an improvement upon the original.

[10:10] You want the quality to be better. The screen is better. The sound is better. The lights are better.

[10:15] The play feel quality is better. Everything about the CGC remakes of Bally Williams games

[10:22] makes those games the ones people want. If you're going to go get a medieval madness,

[10:26] you don't want the original. You want one of the CGC remakes. Same with Attack from Mars,

[10:32] same with Monster Bash. The toppers are awesome. They're beautiful. They're stunning games.

[10:37] You know, when Padready Gaming came out with Funhouse, nobody really wanted it. They redid the

[10:43] artwork with Brian Allen. Nobody wanted it so much that like damn content creators are giving

[10:49] discount promo codes to move the games out of Distro Inventory. That's how bad the sales were.

[10:56] I heard they didn't even sell like 200 of them, but Funhouse was never this like highly sought

[11:02] after collectible. So now that Padready Gaming is going to make this game and bring it back,

[11:08] the story gets even more interesting. So do you know who had permission to make Big Bang Bar?

[11:15] Padready Gaming didn't really engineer this remake of Big Bang Bar. This remake was re-engineered

[11:24] off the original Williams files with the original mold from Williams to make the new dancer in the

[11:31] game. All of it was re-engineered by Mr. Melvin Williams, who we know from Dutch Pinball X.

[11:38] Now Melvin fully made the game, made a few tweaks, added some stuff that's cool, but in the end,

[11:45] like he just made it off of the original Balli Williams design. There was some stuff in it,

[11:50] like there's a post hole that never got used. He removed that from the game and a few tweaks here

[11:56] and there. And so, you know, you might be asking yourself, well, why didn't Dutch Pinball remake

[12:02] Big Bang Bar? Well, Barry was going down that road for a little bit and he was thinking about

[12:07] remaking some of those classic games. Remember, Barry's got like this bride of Pinbot he was

[12:12] going to remake, but Dutch Pinball made a decision that they don't want to turn their company

[12:17] into a company that's making remakes. You could argue that, well, you're remaking Alice's

[12:23] Adventures in Wonderland and you're next going to remake Raz. I'm going to talk about that in a

[12:27] second, but I get what they're saying. Raz never made it into the world. Nobody owns one. Nobody

[12:33] was able to buy J-POP's Alice. Now you can. That's different than remaking a game that's been out

[12:40] for a long time. So, Melvin engineers this game, hands it off to Pedretti Gaming. I don't know

[12:48] what the rest is, but it's now a Pedretti Gaming planetary pinball release. It's going to happen

[12:54] sometime soon. I'll tell you one interesting change. If you look at the original Big Bang Bar,

[13:00] look at the Translight on it. You know it's an interesting fact. Not sure everybody knows this.

[13:05] On the original game that came out that Gene remade, notice what it says on the Translight.

[13:11] All it says is Big Bang. What word is missing? Bar. You want to know the true story about why it

[13:18] doesn't have the bar? When they made the one prototype, they forgot when they were silk screening

[13:24] the Translight artwork. They forgot the final layer to put down to silk screen over onto the art.

[13:32] And the final layer said Bar. So, the original Williams files have it, but when they went to

[13:38] print it, they left it out. So, when Gene did the remake, it still only says Big Bang on the Translight.

[13:47] Now on the new game, you're going to see the bar. It's finally going to be the way it was always

[13:53] supposed to be. So, Big Bang Bar coming back from Prodretti Gaming. And so, then the question becomes

[14:00] this. What will this game cost? How many will they make? What will the quality be like? It's not

[14:07] going to have like a 2.0 kit in it. Like it's not going to be like the original and then a newer

[14:13] like coded game. Melvin originally wanted to do that, but it sounds like these guys want to keep

[14:20] it as original as possible. I also don't expect to see new art package. Stanley was working on some

[14:27] stuff, but what Stanley was working on, the artist, he was working on the 2.0 version with Melvin.

[14:34] What we're going to see here is a remake of a remake of the original prototype. That's what

[14:40] we're going to get. Now, the question is, how much do you think they're going to be able to charge for

[14:44] this game? What will this do to the value of the originals? And here's how I feel about this.

[14:51] If you're going to remake Big Bang Bar, you've got to make it better the way CGC would do it.

[14:57] What I'm worried about here is, Prodretti is going to make a version of the game that isn't as good

[15:04] as the first remake. The quality is not going to be there. They haven't really established a lot of

[15:10] credibility as building high quality machines and the bar has been raised. Dutch quality is amazing.

[15:18] CGC quality is amazing, but Dretti, I don't think people look at them like they're going to enhance

[15:25] what's come out before. So that begs the question then, what happens? I think unfortunately,

[15:31] when you oversaturate a limited game like this, what's going to happen is all of them are going to

[15:37] lose some of their prestige. All of it is going to lose some of its rareness and the original

[15:43] games are definitely going to go down a little bit. Now, I don't know how much I would say if a

[15:49] game is going for like 2025, I think it's going to slide down now because now they might make

[15:55] three to 500 of these. Now, I don't think they're going to sell that many. If they were smart,

[16:00] they would make no more than like 214. I would make 213. I would make one less of the new remake

[16:08] than there was of the original remake. I don't think it should ever be remade. I think sometimes

[16:14] there's a reason why this thing is special and now you're messing with history, you're messing with

[16:19] the legacy of it and you're messing with the collectability of it. It only ever existed to be a rare

[16:26] game that was really cool to have in a very prestigious collection. When you just remake it

[16:33] and flood the market with more, you could do it, but should you do it and I wouldn't have done it.

[16:40] I think it's different making Alice. I think it's different making Raza. Now, speaking of Raza,

[16:46] I'm just going to say this, save your pennies people. And I mean this, I'm just going to say

[16:52] when you see what's going into Raza and when you see the changes that have been made and you see

[16:59] the stuff and the world under glass, it is a special game coming. And I think you're going to

[17:05] want one next to your Alice. If you have an Alice, it's got more in it than Alice. Obviously,

[17:09] it was a more fully developed game, but boy, oh boy, oh boy, I hope you like magnets. I hope you

[17:16] like cool ways to ball save. I hope you like incredible sculpts. I hope you like ramps that

[17:23] have been fixed that are even steeper, that are even cooler. I hope you like UV lighting, lighting

[17:28] up a game in a crazy way. I hope you like a world under glass. This feels like the J-pop game.

[17:35] Everybody always wanted, but it's going to be made by an engineer who knows what he's doing.

[17:41] It's not going to be like that crap they rolled out in Texas and had the clipboard.

[17:46] This is Melvin knows what he's doing. I mean, seriously, I'm just going to say,

[17:49] like it's going to be a very special 2026. And so what I also heard is Raza will be coming out next.

[17:57] And I also heard back to the future. The latest I heard and I, you know, you know me, I mean,

[18:02] I know people that know people. The latest I heard is back to the future is looking insane.

[18:08] Like it is loaded. Like if you think Harry Potter is loaded, guys, where do you see Raza?

[18:15] Where do you see back to the future? There's a lot in it. The world of back to the future

[18:20] is going to be coming to life at the end of 2026. And you know, they know what they need to do.

[18:27] They know what the bar is. They know what they did with Lebowski. And I'm just hearing that back

[18:32] to the future is very, very special. And they were like, Chris, just can't wait to see it.

[18:38] Yeah, where we're going, we don't need roads, baby. You just need a lot of money. It's just

[18:43] going to be really interesting to see what Dutch pinball does to sort of deal with the demand

[18:49] of this thing. The demand is going to be insane. And you know, I don't know, they don't make that

[18:55] many games a week. And so they're going to get like 8,000 orders for this thing. So

[19:01] Dutch pinball back to the future. I love that they just kind of kept it there. I do. It's going to

[19:05] be a very special year. We're going to get Pokemon from Jack Danger and Keith Owens. We're going to

[19:10] get Sonic the Hedgehog from Steve Ritchie and back to the future from freaking Dutch pinball.

[19:17] We're also going to get Beetlejuice soon from spooky pinball. 999 units, $9,999. It's going to sell

[19:27] out in 9 minutes and 9 seconds. That's what's going to happen, people. Trust me. And as I said,

[19:33] Canada's Pinball Podcast is going to get a small number of games. So if you get locked out of

[19:40] Beetlejuice, I am going to get fully loaded games that I can offer up to some of you to buy. I'm not

[19:46] getting them for free. You're going to buy it. You're not going to have to pay a scalper's price

[19:52] and you're not going to get shut out. And that's going to be a fun perk. I'm able to offer some

[19:57] of you because of Bug and Luke and their generosity. I think they just like the fact that I've been

[20:02] saying nice stuff about spooky without having to exchange any dollars. They're going to fix the

[20:07] screen. No more washed out screens. It's going to be insane. The next three months are going to get

[20:14] a little bonkers, everybody. The bar's been raised. You know, look, Harry Potter, I get it. I get it.

[20:21] But how many of you out there might have been in on Harry Potter for 15 and you're still waiting?

[20:27] The more you look, you know, it's not packed, baby. You know, it's not packed. It's a great game.

[20:33] It's a great shooter. It's packed with assets. It's just not packed otherwise. Yeah, I get

[20:40] in these arguments with people. They're like, the game is loaded, Canadian. I'm like, where? It's got

[20:44] a lot of shots. It's got a lot of assets. But where's the loadedness in the game? Where's the magic?

[20:51] Where's the stuff happening? Where's the ball flying through the air? Where's the magnet grabbing

[20:56] it and disappearing? Where? Where? Where's any of the magic in the mechanical parts of the game?

[21:02] I love the staircase, but after that, are you really going to tell me the upper quidditch

[21:08] play field is like blowing you away? And then what else? And then what else? And then they just stare

[21:13] at me. They just stare at me and I'm like, guys, go play a Star Trek the next generation and come

[21:18] back and tell me Harry Potter's packed. Go play it dialed in. Go play Lord of the Rings and then

[21:22] tell me it's packed. I just can't. I can't with these like apologists. It's a really great game,

[21:27] but it's not packed. Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canada Club. Happy September

[21:33] 1st. In like seven, eight days, we're going to see Star Wars. A lot is riding on this game. I can't

[21:40] wait. Now go enjoy your Labor Day. Canada out.

[21:52] Come on, let it go.
