[00:00] So there wasn't even any intro music because I'm on my way to the airport in about 10 minutes

[00:12] to go to Washington DC for some work, but I really felt compelled to get up this little

[00:18] special edition of Canators Pinball Podcast and it's all about the fact that Stern is

[00:23] adding 100 LEDs to the Monster-Elly offering and you heard it here first, right?

[00:29] And I saw on Pinside people were denying it, they were saying I'm going to backtrack

[00:34] that I wasn't I wasn't I wasn't being accurate on this information.

[00:38] When are people finally going to learn that when it comes to manufacturer decisions and

[00:43] especially stuff at Stern?

[00:44] I think I've been right on stuff Stern is going to do almost 100% of the times because

[00:51] as we all know, Stern has people surrounding them that like the talk about what's going

[00:55] on.

[00:57] I don't know how anyone could look at a situation like this and not call bullshit and

[01:03] like two wrongs don't make a right.

[01:05] It wasn't right when they did this with Batman Super-Elly.

[01:09] Remember that back in the day?

[01:10] We're only making 30 Batman's to celebrate each year of the show, right?

[01:15] No, sorry, I think it was 30 to celebrate each year of Stern Pinball, right?

[01:19] It was 30 years of Stern, only 30 super limited editions and then what happened?

[01:24] They asked people to try and get the machine and all these applications came in and they're

[01:29] like, we're leaving money on the table.

[01:31] Let's just bump it up to 80 and say that the other 50 are for the 50 years of Batman and

[01:37] it was real, real ridiculous that they did that.

[01:41] People didn't care because those 80 people were happy they got their super limited editions.

[01:46] But let me tell you, if there were only 30 super limited edition machines, of course

[01:50] those 30 would be worth more than if there were 80 in the world.

[01:55] Now look, I think that was a little bit of a separate thing because paying $15,000 for

[02:00] any Stern machine is ludicrous, right?

[02:04] We all agree to that.

[02:05] I mean, it still holds collector value, but that's the only value it has.

[02:09] If you look at Batman Super-Elly, it's for the collector.

[02:13] Limited edition machines are for people where that matters.

[02:18] When I read Ten-Side and I read people commenting on this, I really don't understand, if you

[02:22] don't understand why a limited number of something adds to its value, I really think you need

[02:28] to go back and be reeducated on the principles of value and scarcity and supply and demand.

[02:37] You shouldn't criticize people that are into that, right?

[02:41] That's part of being a collector.

[02:43] You want to know how many of something are out there in the world.

[02:46] I'm sorry, but Stern had months to figure out what their marketing strategy was around

[02:53] the monsters and they said to you, they said to you, they looked at you and said there's

[02:56] going to be 500 of these.

[02:58] They brought it to a show with a plaque that said 500 of these, only 500 will be made.

[03:04] For some of you out there, I was on that boat, distributors, your money was non-refundable,

[03:11] non-refundable.

[03:13] You only learned that there would be another 100 made after your deposit was non-refundable

[03:21] with some of these distributors.

[03:22] Just think about that for a minute.

[03:24] You were told you're buying one of 500 and you need to let me know within 48 hours if

[03:30] you're committed, after you were committed and your money was locked in, they added more.

[03:36] You didn't even have all the information you needed to make sure you were making a good

[03:40] decision.

[03:41] Is that ethical?

[03:42] That's Stern did that.

[03:43] The other part that really just rubs me the wrong way and I think for all of you on

[03:47] Pinside and all of you collectors, how does this not rub you the wrong way?

[03:51] Where was the official communication from Stern on this?

[03:54] Why didn't Zack just make a post or have Jared post on either Stern's Facebook or hey,

[04:00] everyone?

[04:01] They could have done it easily, been like due to overwhelming demand to have a monster's

[04:06] limited edition, we've up the number to 100 but get them why they last because half

[04:12] of these are going overseas, whatever the messaging is.

[04:14] But no, there still was never any official communication because we saw that even though

[04:21] people were questioning whether I was right or not, Zack was PMing people that there was

[04:26] another 100 at it.

[04:29] And then for those of you out there who are saying, well, this title is one of the best

[04:31] selling in the history of Stern.

[04:32] No, it's not.

[04:34] No, it's not.

[04:35] I'm sure it's doing decent.

[04:36] I'm sure it's doing really well, but I'll tell you this.

[04:38] I've been following the path of Ellie sales for Stern machines now for years and they're

[04:43] still available to buy from distributors.

[04:46] So unlike Batman, unlike Iron Maiden, unlike Ghost Busters, which those games sold out immediately,

[04:54] there are still monsters to buy.

[04:55] Now that's not a statement of whether or not the game is good or not.

[04:59] Here's what I think happen within the Stern marketing walls.

[05:02] And I think that the black and white, while some people love it, some people don't, ironically,

[05:09] it's black and white.

[05:10] It's a polarizing offering.

[05:12] And I think they realized that a lot of people just wanted a full colored play field version

[05:18] of the game with the mini play field.

[05:20] And if the only way you can get that is the Ellie, I think they got a lot of people banging

[05:24] on the door that they wanted that that they weren't happy with like the premium offering.

[05:28] Now that being said, I'm sure a lot of people are happy with the premium offering.

[05:32] But I also think it was a stupid decision by Stern marketing to make the premium the

[05:37] black and white.

[05:38] It's absolutely ludicrous that they made the much more unique and like it's completely

[05:45] unique.

[05:46] The whole point of being limited, it's like when a car company makes a carbon addition,

[05:51] you know, or a special variation of the car, that's always the limited version of the

[05:56] car.

[05:57] You know, they don't, they don't, it's for our doesn't make a radically different version

[06:01] of a four five eight and then call it like, you know, the regular version that anyone

[06:07] can buy in unlimited numbers.

[06:10] And, and, and you know, so that just was like a really weird decision on Stern and it's

[06:14] weird.

[06:15] It's almost like they did that to push people more towards the Ellie's and they got

[06:19] more demand than they expected or the premium sales were not as strong as they expected.

[06:23] Who knows, right?

[06:24] This is all, this is where we get into the land of speculation.

[06:27] I don't know, you don't know, but what I do know is this, two wrongs don't make a right.

[06:32] Doing it on Batman doesn't make doing it on monsters anymore.

[06:36] Correct.

[06:37] And that bullshit little thing at the bottom of the matrix, like subject to change, right?

[06:42] With the asterisk, what, so everything is subject to change after they take your money?

[06:47] And it doesn't just mean it around the, the quantities of the Ellie's everything on

[06:52] that list is subject to change.

[06:54] And for those of you saying it's not on the production line, so you know, it's okay

[06:57] that they did this.

[06:58] That's bullshit.

[06:59] All right.

[07:00] When I bought a Dodge demon, where Dodge said we're only making 3,000 of these in the

[07:03] United States, that was well before the car hit the production line.

[07:07] And let me tell you something, Dodge realized there were way more than 3,000 people that

[07:10] wanted to buy demons.

[07:11] They didn't up the number.

[07:13] They could have sold 6,000.

[07:15] They could have sold 9,000, but they wanted it to make it something special.

[07:20] And people who buy Stern Ellie's, look, criticize them all.

[07:24] They want, they want to feel like they're getting something special, that they're getting

[07:27] something limited, that you're not going to see it everywhere.

[07:30] All right.

[07:31] They realized long ago that that number does matter.

[07:34] They're not doped like Jersey Jack, who makes 1,000 limited editions and then nothing's

[07:39] limited and nothing is special.

[07:41] Stern knows what they're doing.

[07:43] They know they're making a product that appeals to the home collector.

[07:46] But that stuff matters.

[07:48] And I think when they get really cavalier about it and they pull fast ones like this, I

[07:54] think people have a right to be upset.

[07:56] And for those of you who are like, warming on an LE and I really don't care, I just bought

[08:00] this game to have fun.

[08:01] If you just bought the game to have fun, go get a fucking pro.

[08:04] The pro games are always more fun than the LE's and the premiums anyway.

[08:07] They flow better.

[08:08] Everybody knows that.

[08:09] It's like a little kept secret.

[08:11] Everybody knows the upper play field and in Game of Thrones doesn't add shit to the

[08:14] game.

[08:15] The pro is the better version.

[08:16] Almost every game the pro shoots better.

[08:17] And almost every game.

[08:19] It's very rarely that the premium LE actually shoots better than the pro.

[08:23] You pinball funds what you're all about.

[08:25] And here's what's more fun too.

[08:26] Hey, you spend $5,000 on a pro.

[08:28] You get put $4,000 into your bank account.

[08:31] Isn't that more fun?

[08:32] You're having the same goddamn code, the same experience for the most part.

[08:36] It flows better and you're saving to 50% almost off the price of an LE.

[08:41] So let's stop fooling ourselves.

[08:42] The LE's are all about the collectibility.

[08:46] And what Stern did undermines the collectibility of the machine.

[08:51] And the fact that they're still not transparent with the community is upsetting.

[08:57] You know, it's just they literally this is a cash grab.

[09:00] It is a total cash grab.

[09:04] They said what they were going to make and they went back and they offered more to get

[09:07] more money from people.

[09:08] That's it.

[09:09] Sure.

[09:10] Yeah, of course you end up making more people happy because you sell more, but you also,

[09:17] you also go against your word and what you said you were going to do.

[09:22] So for example, if Dodge made 3,000 more demons next year, everyone who bought an original

[09:28] demon would be pissed off, but you have 3,000 new happy guys.

[09:32] What matters more?

[09:33] I think what matters more is that you stick to the word that you said you were going to

[09:37] do that you stick to the promise you made to the buyers.

[09:41] And I think this once again just shows an example of how you know, Stern is about the

[09:47] money and we're happy Stern is about the money.

[09:49] I want to turn the stay in business, but this is not a case where I think we applaud them

[09:54] doing this.

[09:56] And this is a case in which they literally are just like getting a little greedy and it

[10:02] boggles my mind why a company that's got 90% of the market share continues to lack

[10:07] transparency with its customers continues to pull these silly moves like this.

[10:12] They don't have to do it.

[10:14] And again, I think this is a residual move because of the black and white decision.

[10:18] That was another stupid decision.

[10:20] Okay, I'm just going to be on it.

[10:21] You don't do that.

[10:22] You don't make the premium the crazy strange variation of the game.

[10:28] People want more people want the game in color.

[10:31] It looks great in black and white.

[10:32] It does, but it's a special variation.

[10:35] It deserves to be in the Ellie and do people forget?

[10:38] Do people really forget that when the original designs for the game leaked, look at the design,

[10:45] the coffin, it says on it limited edition, the plans were to make the game in limited

[10:52] edition.

[10:53] The decision to switch that up was clearly a decision that is still I can't understand

[11:02] why I can't.

[11:04] Anyway, this is just a little Canadian pinball podcast.

[11:08] I love seeing this debate rage on because these kinds of debates should rage on.

[11:14] And if you're not happy about this decision, say something about it.

[11:18] But I really think with 90% of the market, with loyal customers who buy Stern Ellie's

[11:24] time and time again, with all of you out there who support Stern and I'm one of them,

[11:29] I just think that they need to stop doing this shit.

[11:33] It's okay if the other happens, right?

[11:36] We're going to make 600 WWE's or Guardians of the Galaxy L.E.'s if they make less, and

[11:42] then that's the case, that's people are fine with that.

[11:45] But when you add more after the fact, no, no.

[11:48] And these games are on the line.

[11:50] Don't don't fool yourselves.

[11:51] The pros are on the line.

[11:52] The manufacturing of this game has begun.

[11:55] They manufactured serial plates.

[11:57] It's really, see this is thing too.

[11:58] It's really cheap.

[12:00] The cheapest items on the game are now the ones Stern can easily change.

[12:05] Now did you notice too, they no longer have the designer sign the play field?

[12:09] How cheap is that?

[12:11] Right?

[12:12] You're supposed to sign the play field and clear code over it.

[12:14] They don't do that no more.

[12:15] So for an L.E. where's the designer signing?

[12:19] Where does John Bork sign this game on the apron?

[12:21] The cheapest place to put it?

[12:23] Because then they can just use, you know, what's the thing too?

[12:27] That's why it makes no fucking sense.

[12:30] Because if Stern was running the black and white as the L.E., then they would only have

[12:36] to have made 500 black and white play fields.

[12:39] I think this whole thing, it just, you know, I didn't want to think they're going to do

[12:44] this.

[12:45] This whole thing just reeks that they're going to make a color version of the premium.

[12:50] It just feels like the writing is on the wall that that is what's going to happen next.

[12:54] Anyway, everyone, I love seeing this conversation.

[12:56] It's an important one to have.

[12:58] You know, I'm on the side of you guys, the buyer.

[13:00] I love these manufacturers.

[13:02] I want to see them succeed.

[13:03] But when they pull moves like this and then you're just supposed to shrug your shoulders

[13:07] and be like, oh, it's okay.

[13:08] You know, they added another injury.

[13:10] Like, I'm still going to have fun.

[13:12] We could be brainless morons who love pinball and just say, if I'm having fun, it really

[13:19] doesn't matter what they do to me.

[13:21] Those matter.

[13:22] Okay, I don't know the one.

[13:23] I don't know this.

[13:24] I don't know that.

[13:25] Yeah.

[13:26] That's cool.

[13:27] I'm not going to have a walk and dead premium and then make it after I bought the L.

[13:31] Lease.

[13:32] That's cool.

[13:33] I'm having fun.

[13:34] It doesn't matter that you did something.

[13:35] I don't know why I'm even talking in this weird fucking like terrible Southern.

[13:38] I don't know.

[13:39] Mishmatch, tone of voice.

[13:41] Anyway, look, here everyone.

[13:43] I'm just going to say, if I hope, if I could have a wish for 2019, it was that stirring

[13:47] would stop doing this stuff.

[13:48] And if you're going to do it, be more transparent about it.

[13:52] You know, Zach emailing people privately.

[13:56] I mean, just wreaks of like a cowardly move.

[13:58] Just come out and say it.

[14:00] You've already told your distributors what you're going to do.

[14:02] You're not even telling your customers.

[14:05] I have a problem with that.

[14:06] Wake up, Stern.

[14:07] You've got 90% of the market because of the people on the pin side and the collectors

[14:11] who love you.

[14:13] You can't do this to them.

[14:15] And in any hobby, in any collector hobby, you've got to make sure you're enthusiast

[14:19] based.

[14:20] It are the ones who are like are on board the most.

[14:24] And this just wreaks of another cash grab.

[14:28] Two wrongs don't make a right.

[14:30] Everyone have a good day.

[14:31] We're going to be back Thursday.

[14:32] I'm talking to someone from Deep Root Pimbal.

[14:36] All right.

[14:37] It's going to be great.

[14:38] We're going to hear some new stuff.

[14:39] I'm super excited.

[14:40] This is going to be one of my most fit like, I don't know.

[14:42] One of the most exciting interviews I'm excited for.

[14:46] And by the way, if you want to hear more about monsters, go check out head to head pinball.

[14:52] They did a great interview with Dwight Sullivan that going over the game.

[14:55] So I think you guys should check that one out.

[14:57] I'm also on Facebook.

[14:59] Christopher Franche said he's so sick and annoyed of a pinball podcast.

[15:02] And he he was going to give the guy another chance and he's completely over him now.

[15:07] Let me just for the record state that that is not me he's talking about.

[15:10] I saw everyone upload photos of Canada.

[15:13] It's not me.

[15:14] It's somebody else.

[15:15] All right.

[15:16] Chris and I are friends again.

[15:18] All right.

[15:19] Everyone have a great day.

[15:20] We'll talk to you soon.

[15:21] Um, goodbye.
