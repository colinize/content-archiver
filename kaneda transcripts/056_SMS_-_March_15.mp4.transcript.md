[00:00] We are live. We are here. Let's get this screen a little cleaner. Oh, there we go. Even better.

[00:10] How's everybody doing? It is Saturday morning. Let's go get the kids in the house. We've got this is the calm before the storm.

[00:19] Everyone can feel it. We're about to get a lot. And I mean it. A lot of stuff happening in the pinball world.

[00:26] It's just beginning. First game is going to be P three. But wait for people to come through the door.

[00:34] You know how this show works. Let's get everybody here. We live. Join us Saturday morning.

[00:48] Oh man, where is that we are? Okay, here we go.

[00:56] Okay, everybody can see it. Let's get people through the door.

[01:03] Has everybody doing post?

[01:09] Carlos, what's up? We're a little early here. Kind of just getting stuff set up technically. Get everybody through the door. See if we're on.

[01:23] Oh, that's like, I don't know if that's the right link. Hold on. Facebook don't let me down. I did post.

[01:34] Uh-huh. Let's do this. Share.

[01:42] Copy. There we go.

[01:47] One day I'm going to be as good as Carrie Hardy at this. Not today though. Not today though.

[01:57] And then Patreon.

[02:03] Community.

[02:07] On the flippers. When you hit the left play field, check the leaf switches on the left and right flippers.

[02:16] Oh man.

[02:31] Oh man. I don't even want to.

[02:37] Got some GNR switch issues.

[02:41] Not, you know, never fun when the your game goes down and that's always a thing. It's, you know, you want you.

[02:50] When a Pimbo machine is, I can explain how I kind of bust a GNR or got some switch issues, but.

[02:58] It's almost 10 o'clock. We are still before.

[03:02] Before the dedicated time.

[03:05] And then we're going to go live. Let's do this. Boom SMS.

[03:12] March 15.

[03:18] Okay.

[03:26] Okay.

[03:29] Next.

[03:32] Today is the 15th, right? God, same paddy's day coming up.

[03:41] All right.

[03:50] We good. We live. We live. Thank you everybody for being patient.

[03:54] Carlos, what's up? What's up, brother?

[03:59] Saturday morning.

[04:01] We've got a little bit of a chiller day here. It's like spring is in here.

[04:06] The sun came out this week. Everyone's been having a good time.

[04:11] You're good. Josh, are you still doing marketing for Jamison?

[04:15] I am still doing marketing for Jamison.

[04:18] For some reason, they decided to sort of not do any activation this year.

[04:24] So I don't have a big same Patrick's day.

[04:28] Sorry, activation.

[04:32] Last year's was awesome. Saturday night.

[04:34] Same Patrick's Eve. I just think they, you know,

[04:37] it's not a Monday.

[04:39] And I think they wanted to take a little bit of a pause on investing in it.

[04:44] Yeah, the kids don't drink as much.

[04:46] But you know what, they're not going to drink more if you stop marketing.

[04:49] I think you got to market through some of the,

[04:52] through some of the stuff.

[04:53] Here's my guns and roses. My guns and roses.

[04:56] I'll talk about it in a little bit, but I just, I cheat it.

[05:00] And explain how I cheat it.

[05:03] And I got to not in this lifetime.

[05:05] It, but my game died.

[05:06] Like right as I got to not in this lifetime.

[05:09] So I am going to talk about that on this episode.

[05:12] We're going to talk about the calm before the April storm.

[05:16] We're going to get, I think maybe just one game out in March.

[05:19] And then the rest is going to come

[05:21] sometime in April.

[05:23] April is going to be silly.

[05:24] It's going to be silly as everybody tries to get their pinball stuff out

[05:29] to market at the same time.

[05:31] I'm, I'm excited to see it.

[05:34] I don't think every game is going to find a buyer.

[05:39] I think there's going to be winners and losers.

[05:41] And I think there is going to be,

[05:45] you know, a lot of people

[05:49] watching these releases, I think, with a lot more patience.

[05:53] Because I think now more than ever,

[05:56] the, the reality has set in for pretty much everybody that no game

[06:04] is hard to get.

[06:06] Every game has lost a lot.

[06:10] Except for like a tiny, tiny number of games.

[06:15] And the old games are just, just that in my honest opinion.

[06:19] There's a lot of older games

[06:22] that people think are worth a lot more than they really are.

[06:26] And we'll talk a little bit about the market conditions,

[06:30] what's happening in the world.

[06:31] How is that going to impact pinball sales?

[06:34] Nobody has a crystal ball.

[06:37] But we can see where things are trending.

[06:41] And I think that's how I like to look at this hobby is every week.

[06:46] We see trends happening around enthusiasm for titles.

[06:50] I love popping into the owners club and just reading what people are reacting to their new games.

[06:58] And yeah, like, you know, it's just,

[07:02] but I've had to put a, you know, a finger on it.

[07:07] I think everybody is like waiting for the next Godzilla still.

[07:12] It's just like kind of where we're at.

[07:13] Like, jaws never became the, like, the talk of the town.

[07:18] It really didn't.

[07:20] We haven't had a game in a few years that universally.

[07:27] Everybody is just like, that's awesome.

[07:29] And I think that's what everybody's waiting and hoping for.

[07:34] Still though, when you really think about the themes about the come out in the world,

[07:39] are these themes really speaking to most of you?

[07:43] I mean, are these the dream themes, as I said, in my last podcast?

[07:47] Guns and Roses dream band.

[07:49] I love GNR.

[07:51] You know, I think that it's, uh, it's interesting.

[07:56] Now, when you hear your favorite bands music over and over and over again in a pinball machine,

[08:01] I'm kind of like, you know, I'm kind of over it.

[08:05] And I'll explain my sort of feelings on GNR, you know, a little bit.

[08:11] I think a lot of you, uh, who have this machine or have had it or have played it,

[08:17] I think we all have, uh, sort of similar things we like, things we don't like.

[08:23] It's not a game that deserves the vitriol it gets.

[08:29] It's the best-selling Jersey Jack game ever.

[08:33] But it's also a game that divides people.

[08:37] And we'll talk about that in a little bit.

[08:39] How much you're going to sell guns for?

[08:42] Well, how much you got?

[08:46] Well, I'm not, I'm not delusional.

[08:48] I'm not a delusional seller.

[08:51] And I don't like things to be on the market for a long time.

[08:56] I think that Guns and Roses collector's edition,

[09:01] with an extra play field and two extra play fields.

[09:03] I have the main one and the small one.

[09:07] I think this game sells on the market right now.

[09:14] If I want to get it gone, like cash on the table.

[09:19] I'm looking at 11 firm.

[09:23] I think 11 firm is kind of where I'm at with this game.

[09:27] I don't, you know, I don't think,

[09:31] I don't think I'd get 12 right now.

[09:34] It's interesting, only 500.

[09:37] So I don't know. I don't know.

[09:41] I really don't know anymore.

[09:45] It's like this game is like, there's none for sale right now.

[09:49] The CES are right now.

[09:51] There's no CES for sale.

[09:54] What were you saying about Gina Reminds?

[09:56] I mean, very much about what happened with Waz.

[09:58] Yeah, so we'll talk, let's talk about the new stuff.

[10:03] I'll get the G&R in a little bit.

[10:05] I just cheat it on the game.

[10:07] I want to just talk about it now and then we'll get to the new stuff.

[10:09] So I just cheat it.

[10:10] And I just wanted to like get through the game to see more of the game.

[10:16] On my own skill, with three ball,

[10:22] I have been able to start all the albums,

[10:25] not in one game maybe,

[10:27] but I've been able to start albums and songs

[10:30] and get to the mini wizard modes.

[10:31] I've seen all that.

[10:33] I've started slashes solo.

[10:35] I've started the world tour.

[10:37] The only thing I wasn't able to get to was the not in this lifetime.

[10:41] No sympathy for the devil.

[10:44] So what I did, because you know me,

[10:47] I'm just getting a little tired of the outlane drains,

[10:50] is I didn't even realize this was a thing.

[10:52] You could just do the coin door, open it up,

[10:54] and it initiates the ball save.

[10:58] So I just played a game and just did that.

[11:02] It's cheating.

[11:04] It's stupid.

[11:05] It's not that fun.

[11:07] It changes the way you play.

[11:10] You're not really focused.

[11:11] And you don't need to be focused.

[11:12] You're more,

[11:14] you know, I had the coin door open, not even locking it.

[11:17] And so like I was leaning against it with my knee

[11:20] to just pop it open every time the ball would drain.

[11:22] Just I just wanted to just get through the game.

[11:26] Even with that.

[11:29] Here's this crazy.

[11:31] Even with that,

[11:34] it still was like a half hour or more

[11:38] to kind of get through the game.

[11:41] And then I started getting some weird stuff happening with the game.

[11:47] I got the upper guitar neck,

[11:51] the two pins that hold the ball up there.

[11:54] If I'm staring at it, the one on the right just started acting up

[11:59] and was firing.

[12:00] The optos were miscalibrated.

[12:03] Then I got that switch error that says

[12:06] the right and left flippers switches.

[12:09] And then in the middle,

[12:10] is this normal and not in this lifetime?

[12:14] Do the flippers in some of the,

[12:17] you got to shoot each character.

[12:20] Do the flippers switch at one point or slashes like backwards?

[12:25] I don't know.

[12:26] That's what happened on my game.

[12:27] All of a sudden,

[12:28] the flippers switched.

[12:30] Then the lower flippers all died on me.

[12:33] And only the upper flippers were working.

[12:35] This is how my game ended.

[12:37] And I got that switch error on the those two flippers.

[12:41] But now I mean the game is playing fine.

[12:43] I don't know.

[12:44] So I'm a little bummed out that I that I cheat it

[12:48] to get to the end to then not even be able to play the end

[12:51] because the game sort of cracked out on me.

[12:55] So yeah.

[12:57] All right.

[12:57] So that's Guns Your Owners.

[12:58] As I said on my show,

[13:01] I still think the game is,

[13:05] there's a great game in here if they simplified it.

[13:08] There's a great game in there.

[13:10] If they made it a little bit easier.

[13:15] And if they made it,

[13:16] you know what's hard about G and R is,

[13:19] there's times when like you could legit just start two songs could be 25 minutes.

[13:27] November rain in a strange like just two songs.

[13:30] That's not getting to those songs.

[13:33] That's not many wizard modes.

[13:35] That's one of the like the cons of this game is sometimes you're like,

[13:39] oh man, I really don't want to play this.

[13:42] I love.

[13:42] I really would swap out like a long song for

[13:48] yesterday's or knocking on heaven's door.

[13:52] Like the 10 minute opuses are brutal to you know,

[13:57] November rains like.

[13:58] Ah, like.

[14:01] All right.

[14:02] What do you think about Gary Stern announcing a price increase today?

[14:06] Did he announce a price increase today?

[14:10] I don't know.

[14:10] Did I don't did I don't think he did.

[14:12] Did he did I missed that?

[14:13] We're going to talk about all the new stuff.

[14:15] What's up?

[14:16] Albert, how's it going brother?

[14:19] We're going to talk about all the new stuff waiting for the X-Men topper.

[14:24] Man, it's like the thing about X-Men guys is when you go into that thread, it is sad.

[14:32] It's a sad state like everybody's hoping

[14:36] that that game has some sort of turnaround that there's going to be a moment where

[14:41] it's going to get this code update and it's going to become this new game.

[14:47] It's never happening.

[14:49] Kong is going to be spike three.

[14:53] Kong is going to be spike three.

[15:00] And I think it's going to come with a $600 price increase.

[15:06] I didn't make this number up.

[15:08] That is what the people have been saying.

[15:11] My source is and other sources.

[15:14] And I think it's going to be $13,604 the LE.

[15:19] And I would just add $600 to every model.

[15:22] So the premium would be $10,3.

[15:26] And the pro will be, what is the price?

[15:29] $6,600?

[15:31] Something like that?

[15:32] I don't know.

[15:32] I don't even know what a pro is now.

[15:33] $6,000, $7,000.

[15:38] I look gang, gang, the prices of everything are going up.

[15:46] I don't look.

[15:47] That price increase was coming before tariffs hit any of these companies.

[15:52] I think a lot of people are just going to make decisions that they need to slow down.

[16:00] And I'm seeing this all over the interwebs.

[16:06] I think overall, the desire to keep accumulating more of these things that men collect.

[16:18] Every year, it just loses a little bit more and more of its cash.

[16:23] And I mean that, whether it's pinball arcade machines, toys, watches,

[16:30] and you think pinball has gone through a market correction.

[16:34] If any of you collect watches,

[16:38] at the height of COVID, people were paying 30,000 plus for an Omega snoopy,

[16:46] which I think is 12 or 16 from Omega, 30 grand.

[16:51] Right?

[16:52] And now there are diamonds in everywhere for 16, 15 because supply caught up with demand.

[17:00] You keep telling price increases, kill sales, but people still,

[17:04] Bruno, I'm not sure.

[17:07] Here's the thing about all pinball sales.

[17:09] We don't know any numbers from the large manufacturers.

[17:15] And look at spooky sales.

[17:18] Like they still have not sold out of evil dead and it's been four months.

[17:23] So I think that sales have slowed down.

[17:29] I don't even know how to speculate how well D&D is selling versus X-Men,

[17:36] versus John Wick, versus Venom.

[17:39] I don't know.

[17:43] I wish Stern would release its numbers, but they don't.

[17:50] So I have to imagine that D&D is not flying off the shelves.

[17:56] They're making more Godzilla's again.

[17:58] What would I don't get is who doesn't, by now, who can't find a Godzilla premium?

[18:07] I mean, the fact that more Godzilla premiums are on the line, I don't understand.

[18:12] I mean, maybe there's just so much demand.

[18:15] Mr. Christopher Franchi.

[18:19] So Franchi, clever artwork on that spooky box has everybody talking about.

[18:26] Gremlins.

[18:27] Should have Canadian ripping through that box.

[18:30] I think spooky has Gremlins and Beetlejuice.

[18:33] I think they do.

[18:34] I think that's the next two games.

[18:35] I think it's Beetlejuice maybe then Gremlins.

[18:40] I think spooky's got a lot of fun stuff.

[18:43] I think spooky's next titles are going to sell much faster than evil dead because of the themes.

[18:49] And boutiques are in the driver's seat right now.

[18:55] I said it's just a tribute.

[18:56] So Franchi, I mean, I could ask you directly right now.

[19:00] Can you confirm that they don't have Gremlins?

[19:03] See, this is like a lot of like the news.

[19:07] Chris, you know, Mr. Franchi comes here.

[19:09] Chris, thank you for hanging out.

[19:10] And, you know, sometimes he'll just dispel a rumor and that's great.

[19:13] It's news.

[19:17] Okay, so he just confirmed that they do not have Gremlins.

[19:21] And I see, I love it.

[19:22] I love it.

[19:24] It's great.

[19:24] And it's, you know, now,

[19:28] and like I, I, I love that you come here and you give us, you know, just confirmation.

[19:38] But like a, it's smart.

[19:41] It is so smart to do what Franchi just did because the last thing you want to do,

[19:47] and I think barrels of fun needs to understand this is,

[19:51] if you don't have something that people really want you to make,

[19:57] and you have like, Dune and everybody wants GI Joe or Goonies, I mean, at some level,

[20:06] barrels of fun, I think should be a little bit more active.

[20:09] And just dispelling some of the rumors.

[20:11] Like, remember when everyone was like, it's Fifth Element.

[20:14] It's not Fifth Element.

[20:15] There's no way the Bruce Willis estate is going to sign up for that game.

[20:20] So, but they never, they never comment on rumors at all.

[20:25] I think it helps to take a rumor off the table if it's not true because you don't want to

[20:32] disappoint people.

[20:34] Anyway, yeah, Goonies, you know, I don't know.

[20:41] I mean, I think the, David Van Es said he wants to invite content creators, he wants to invite

[20:49] distributors, two barrels to see the new game before he reveals it under NDA or something,

[20:56] you know, within Bargo to coverage.

[20:58] But okay, until that invite goes out,

[21:02] and maybe they've changed their plans, but until that invite goes out,

[21:06] I think it's safe to say we're not going to see the new barrels game at T.P.F.

[21:11] I think someone held up a ramp, like a black little horseshoe ramp.

[21:15] I'm like, I don't care about this.

[21:18] And this stupid.

[21:19] Like if you're going to tease something, do it right.

[21:21] Like I don't need to see a ramp.

[21:23] Like this is a dumbest thing that T's with.

[21:25] It could be anything.

[21:26] You could put that ramp, it could be anything.

[21:28] It doesn't, and it's not even like an exciting ramp.

[21:31] You know, it wasn't like they were holding up this crazy magic girl like ramp.

[21:35] It was just a little horseshoe ramp.

[21:38] Wow.

[21:39] Wow, there's a ramp in the game.

[21:41] I don't think Kong is strong enough theme to sell great.

[21:46] Josh, Josh, come on, come on.

[21:48] I don't guys, don't say silly things.

[21:52] King Kong, Keith Ellen,

[21:56] equals sales juggernaut.

[21:58] Just that's it.

[22:00] That's it.

[22:02] I don't, King Kong is a strong theme.

[22:06] I think Stern will release a jaws anniversary this summer.

[22:09] Do I think, yes, I do.

[22:14] I do.

[22:17] What was Albert's podcast move?

[22:22] Your numbers will do well.

[22:23] Albert, where are you now?

[22:28] Did, uh, I don't, are people still talking about the Twippy meltdown?

[22:32] I mean, it's weird to me.

[22:33] It wasn't even a meltdown.

[22:34] I really don't understand.

[22:36] I think in the end, like gang, the fact that the only thing people are talking about

[22:44] from the Twippies was my 10 minute Facebook live is kind of funny.

[22:49] No one talked about anything else.

[22:50] Nobody.

[22:52] I haven't spoken to Jamie yet.

[22:54] I bet they're a little bit like bummed out that the show production was so bad and also,

[22:59] you know, bummed out that they're weighted scoring, I think, is just going to make everybody

[23:06] not care.

[23:07] I mean, it was weird.

[23:08] It was weird to almost have a hundred more votes and lose, but who cares?

[23:11] Cal is an awesome dude.

[23:14] Cal, Cal, Cal, Cal Hernandez.

[23:18] Cal and Rachel, awesome, awesome people.

[23:20] Electric bad.

[23:20] I mean, look, if I'm going to lose, I couldn't lose to nicer people.

[23:27] Really, you're on TPN now, Albert?

[23:31] That's funny.

[23:32] Well, enjoy.

[23:33] I think the days of like any pinball network kind of amplifying anybody now, like,

[23:46] Albert, what I would hope you can get to.

[23:50] My numbers are down a little bit.

[23:53] They're like 680, 685.

[23:56] My monetary amount's not really down that much.

[23:58] So it's like, it's an interesting thing.

[24:00] Like if one person who gives $100 a month joins, that's like the same as 20 people at $5

[24:10] leaving.

[24:11] So it's like, and I've had a really nice amount of people that have up their amount to 15 or

[24:18] 30 a month, which is nice.

[24:19] So everybody who's raised the roof, I really do appreciate it.

[24:23] And you know, look, I know there hasn't been much news.

[24:28] I know that a lot of people are going through a lot of bills and financial hardships.

[24:32] So I really appreciate every subscriber I get.

[24:38] Something is coming from super awesome.

[24:40] Awesome.

[24:41] Man, we love super awesome.

[24:44] The thing is, let's talk about portal.

[24:46] Let's start where the news is at.

[24:49] So gang, we've got portal pinball, not even tees.

[24:54] Jerry's like revealed it pretty much.

[24:57] Not the game, but like the theme still hasn't come out and said portal.

[25:02] Carrie Hardy has a heart on for it.

[25:04] He's seen it under NDA, secret NDA.

[25:06] Carrie Hardy has signed and he says it's a hit.

[25:10] And he says it's the best game that multi-morphics made to date.

[25:15] And multi-morphic hasn't really made great games to date.

[25:19] Not that they're bad.

[25:20] It's just I would say,

[25:24] they're there are a lot like spooky in that every game is better than the previous game.

[25:31] But it's still it's still going to be interesting.

[25:36] Here's what I don't get.

[25:38] Did have they even shipped to customers?

[25:42] The princess bride, collector's editions with the swords on the side of the cabinet.

[25:48] Have they even made like any of those yet?

[25:53] So I just don't like I feel like Jerry's going to announce this game.

[25:59] And the earliest people are going to get it again is going to be like the fall.

[26:06] Canate and I are going to start the podcast superstar's network we should.

[26:11] So I just don't like I don't really I think anyone who goes in on these though,

[26:18] like they know the delays, they know Jerry will get you your product.

[26:23] But I just don't I'm curious because people are saying they've addressed the issues with the

[26:29] lower half of the play field. Okay. I'm sure it's just more stuff floating over the screen with

[26:38] crazier ways to do that. Use arcade prices have dropped. Yeah, everything's look gang.

[26:47] I don't know about you, but my take on everything is this like the wages are having gone up,

[26:55] but the cost of everything's gone way up. And the desire to own and flex and like,

[27:03] okay, I got this. I think everyone's starting to realize like maybe,

[27:07] maybe what we should be doing is aiming for happiness and balance and peace of mind.

[27:19] And I think a lot of people are getting there. See, to me, pinball and we'll get into it.

[27:25] It's all about the people. So P3, let's talk about it. Princess, bride, orders, Jesse though,

[27:31] Jesse, did they make the ones in this the dedicated Princess bride cabinets? I haven't seen anybody

[27:40] unbox those. I heard them announce that all the I think they I think they fulfilled all the orders

[27:48] for the modular units that were ordered, but has anyone seen in unboxing with the in regalmentoya?

[27:59] Is that his name swords on the side of the game? Has anyone seen that version go out to a customer?

[28:06] The collector's edition.

[28:13] No, it won't, Albert. There will there will never be a P3 title that sells like hotcakes.

[28:24] I don't even know that that is like a oxymoron. It's it's it's just it's just for people who want

[28:38] something different. I think the game is here's what I think Jerry's done though. I think

[28:45] multi-morphic. I think multi-morphic has shown that they're engineering and their toys and their

[28:51] creativity is phenomenal. Like to me they're making everybody else look look look cheap look lazy.

[29:01] If I were to tell you that spooky pinball and multi-morphic are putting more toys in their games

[29:07] than Jersey Jack pinball and charging a lot less money wouldn't like if I were to tell you that

[29:13] like four years ago you'd be like you're crazy. Look how many toys are in evil dead. Look how many

[29:18] toys are in Avatar. I am it's just like I can't wait can't wait for spooky to get the theme with

[29:26] the toys with franchi with the rules set. Guys are man they like I I will I will

[29:37] own a spooky game within two years one of the newer titles.

[29:41] I just I just need something you know I think about all the themes coming out Pokemon.

[29:53] I'm not into Pokemon let me let me be honest King Kong yeah not really into King Kong. I know

[29:59] King Kong I met him a few times. I don't really I don't really it's not it's not really a theme I

[30:06] want. Portal no I haven't even thought about portal until it was announced that multi-morphic might

[30:12] be making it. Francis says I bet you buy the next one I probably will. I have money set aside

[30:21] for that. I don't really care about I you know I don't know what barrels this title is if it's

[30:28] doing that's an easy pass and I'm gonna buy predator. I've already said I'm buying predator.

[30:35] I'm buying predator because I love that movie it's probably my favorite Arnold movie.

[30:43] It's probably the Arnold movie I've seen the most. It's probably the Arnold movie where I remember

[30:50] the most lines from it and if they get all the assets from the movie it's gonna be good.

[31:02] I mean the assets are gonna be good. I think the game's gonna be terrible. This is like a weird

[31:10] thing to say right I'm gonna buy a game that I am fully expecting to be horrible

[31:16] because I haven't seen the pinball brothers make a game on their own that's been good.

[31:24] So I hope I'm wrong I hope it's awesome it's gonna go in my garage I'm moving the neo-geos upstairs

[31:36] and as I said on my show Guns of Roses work of art very good experiential machine

[31:50] kind of over it kind of over it I kind of I'm over I'm over it I just I just the way it shoots

[32:00] the lack of feeling reward when you get to multi balls or two modes I'm just over it yeah I just you know

[32:12] had a lot of fun with it I think Guns of Roses is a six months and it moves on machine you know

[32:20] I might be selling it Brenda I just I don't I just don't I don't know you know it's like the hard

[32:29] thing about these Jersey Jack machines is when you when you when you go stand over a stern they

[32:37] look so cheap next to Jersey Jack machines I remember the like it's the reason why I sold my

[32:44] Batman S. Ali because like I remember standing over Willie Wonka and it made Batman look like a

[32:49] tinker toy now you know Batman is in a better game but still you know very dated and cheap looking

[32:58] compared to that to to Wonka I don't know I just think I'm I just think I'm I just think Guns

[33:09] of Roses you know it um it's a game to where I wish they would they would add more songs why not

[33:17] they like slash I just Jersey Jacks got got more owners of this machine than any of their games

[33:24] and they haven't done anything they haven't done anything more and I don't understand why they

[33:31] won't surprise and delight their fans you know once a year with like a new thing like a new track

[33:40] a how hard can it be to code a new song into the game add some more call outs have a secret mystery

[33:50] mode like they don't do anything I mean they didn't even like adjust the settings from the factory

[33:56] to make this game better I had to go on pin side and and see owners doing it so I don't I don't

[34:04] know I don't know why they're done with it like do some stuff like add another few songs from

[34:09] user illusion to add some more songs from Chinese democracy like just I don't know just add another

[34:17] song from lies I you know Brenda you're on camera there it is there's the wave everybody loves

[34:24] Brenda now after she calm me down or in my mini meltdown she you know what someone said and they're

[34:30] like oh divorce is next he's gonna get divorced yeah okay you hear that Brenda they don't think

[34:37] we're gonna last after 10 years you know 10 years with a sassy Irish wife if you thought that

[34:48] we're in it we're in it we got married later in life we we we we we've vetted other people to the

[34:58] point where like we knew what we wanted yeah it's um you really I don't know I don't know I

[35:15] have um I'm like really excited for April what do you guys think the barrels of fun theme is

[35:25] yeah right in the chat I want we got 91 people here what do you think the barrels of fun theme is going to be

[35:35] yeah dude I know it's dude David how do you know it's dude I don't think it's GI Joe I mean I look

[35:55] I doon is the one that a lot of us have heard I hope it's goonies I can't tell you how come

[36:03] these guys like let me tell you gang let me tell you something when you have a pinball you have

[36:08] pinball info let me tell you how much the world cares about your pinball info 99.999 don't give it down

[36:20] you could run into any barn america and be like I know what barrels of phones next pinball

[36:26] machines gonna be and nobody would even lift their head and look at you they'd be like get this

[36:33] jackass out of here now I'll tell you this I'll tell you this barrels to me has they've got some

[36:44] they've got they need to prove something on this game I'll tell you why libranth has no real toys in

[36:49] it and I when you when you when you play libran you know don't be fooled by little pes dispenser heads

[36:56] popping up all over the place there's no toys in that game really so I'm I'm like I'm hoping this

[37:05] company has up their engineering game because spooky has multi more pig has turns got a big army

[37:13] of engineers jersey jack better up it man they can't be empty freaking Harry Potter you know I like I

[37:22] I did feel when I played labyrinth I automated it was a little you know just a little like

[37:31] it was like neither here nor there for me right it was neither here nor there like I didn't I didn't

[37:36] like hate it I just didn't do anything for me and I haven't seen the movie in years and

[37:45] there was no Jennifer Connolly there there I just I I just it's just didn't grab me

[37:54] and because I just don't know the theme that well like you know when I when I turn on predator

[37:58] regardless of how crappy the game is it's gonna pull me into the predator movie because I know

[38:04] that movie so well Chris is it true the best toy in Harry Potter is this snitch scram

[38:12] what what is that I don't even know what that is spooky is king right now um no they're not

[38:23] they're not king right now I mean Stern Pimbo makes more games in a week than spooky has sold

[38:30] of evil dead I think spooky is the best uh it's the they're the best boutique right now they're the best

[38:41] uh at community relations I think they're the best at transparency I think they're having the most

[38:49] fun and that's addictive and when you see a team having fun you know I don't think Jack

[38:57] Danger's having fun I don't I remember when I saw Jack at the Stern factories like he looked like he

[39:05] was like like without sleep for weeks uh I don't think uh yeah I just the vibe over at Stern feels more

[39:16] of a corporation and pressure it's not like it's not fun it's fun making Pimbo but I don't feel like

[39:25] they get to do what spooky gets to do which is as a team you know no one's internally they're

[39:33] competing with each other I don't think there's like egos and a holes I think they're all like

[39:39] in it together to make each game special and then when they get uh the ability to reveal it and

[39:45] they have a good sales day then they're set for the rest of the year hey you Stern Pimbo doesn't have

[39:51] that luxury like they got a like they got to manage three to four new titles a year they've got a

[39:58] huge line they've got hundreds of people that they have to pay salary for they have to deal with

[40:04] the logistics of sending products all over the world of sourcing materials and parts from all

[40:10] different countries now that are about to impose tariffs they they've got investors who demand a

[40:16] certain bottom line and expectations on return on that investment it doesn't seem like

[40:24] the gang in Benton that can just close up shop at five and all go have some brisket and beers and

[40:32] and celebrate the fact that we just put five million in pre-order money in the bank you know I just

[40:37] feel like all right so I don't know like I think the fun guys are doing great

[40:46] I think barrels is a company that uh they haven't shown us behind the scenes they're they're a company

[40:53] that's more secretive what's going on at barrels ironic because their name is barrels of fun uh so

[41:00] if they're not having fun then they don't have the right company name but I don't see barrels of fun

[41:06] having fun you know it's like hey if I be serious like I don't see barrels of fun showing us them

[41:12] having fun every week and that's that's it like I think David David just runs a different kind of

[41:21] company not that it's not fun but it's just not the same Jersey Jack pinball is no it's I think

[41:28] Jersey Jack pinball is more fun to be at than stern from what I've heard from people who have

[41:34] done both but I think at JJP it's it seems a little more sedated and you can feel that when you

[41:44] walk around JJP it just doesn't have the energy or the wow of stern and doesn't have like the

[41:51] campiness and the coolness of spooky I feel like JJP you know I let me just I just feel like they're

[41:58] company that's that is what they are like they're a company where they're all salaried employees

[42:06] they know it and they're I just I just don't feel like they have the swagger they should for the

[42:19] the kind of product they make and the the resources they have I feel like JJP hasn't really had

[42:29] any swagger since GNR they haven't they haven't had a hit since GNR they haven't had a round of

[42:39] applause from everybody they haven't won you know like best game and best this and best that like

[42:46] they just they just have had disappointment after disappointment and again the games are not

[42:55] terrible but you know they took stuff out the toys weren't there the creativity wasn't there the

[43:02] themes were not there stern are these terrors man what is going on in the world with these terrors

[43:11] with the economy with your 401k with your crypto it's very volatile you know very volatile I don't

[43:19] pretend to be an expert on these things and I know I'm very happy when I sold my New York City

[43:26] apartment and I took all of the cash and I'm put a hundred percent of it against the mortgage on

[43:36] this house so this house is now like 75 80 percent paid for that's that's good to have a house in one

[43:44] year which is basically 75 percent paid for I'm feeling good I'm feeling good I'm I'm I have a

[43:54] later start in life and I I want to be out of housing debt I I still I have enough money to pay

[44:03] off the house in fall but I've got that money invested and we are putting money aside for the

[44:09] children's education and you know I always like to have like like 30 or 40 grand in my checking

[44:16] account just to have you know take say which a weird thing it's a weird thing it's not smart but I

[44:21] just like to have like 30 grand I like to have like two two pinball machines I could buy like

[44:26] just like that I just like to have it just sit in the hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but you know

[44:31] but not not the smartest place is not really you know it's not a saving it's just my checking

[44:41] yeah yeah now my problem is you get me you get me a little tipsy on espresso martinis and

[44:47] canada walks into Tiffany's and buys Brenda a bracelet that costs more than a Jersey Jack C.E.

[44:53] And then I'm like well you know looks great on her she's happy I'm happy I'd rather her have that

[45:01] actually the value in that won't go down as much as a pinball machine so if we ever need it to

[45:05] sell it times got tough it's Tiffany diamonds not bad um I made 230,000 in six months on Tesla stock

[45:14] before Elon went nuts well yeah well you don't make it until you sell it brother

[45:22] yeah you know my you know I won't say this um

[45:28] um my dad once told me the most amount of money he made in the market in one day

[45:34] I'm like wow wow and he's like yeah he's like let me also tell you the most amount of money

[45:38] at loss in the market in one day it was like the same amount so it is what it is them the breaks

[45:45] um them the breaks so bill brand is in the house

[45:52] how you doing Billy you know look I live in a town so many people working finance money money money

[46:03] money money you know what you know what I love this town about my town has got this really great

[46:09] restaurant where when you go to the bar you're gonna make a new friend that night and no matter where

[46:15] you come from you're not gonna talk finance but you see him saying you walk up to somebody you're

[46:21] not gonna talk finance you're gonna talk about hobbies you're gonna talk about other stuff

[46:26] but I love that we live in a community where people are so friendly and so nice I mean it is

[46:31] it is a dream come true it's quiet I can walk to the train I can walk to the village to not have

[46:38] to get in a car and live in a town where everything is accessible by foot kids can play outside no

[46:48] no double yellow no trucks going by I'm in heaven I'm in heaven until I turn on this guns

[46:55] or roses and it jimulti ball now it's fun look um I love G and R I hate G and R it's it's like

[47:05] it's just those day the out I will say this when I I for those of you who just joined I cheated I did

[47:12] the open coin door ball save for like 40 minutes just to get through the game to see not in this

[47:18] lifetime the game had some issues it kind of broke on me at the end but I just wanted to see like okay

[47:27] and I will say the um it's it's laborious it's it's it's it does get a little chopping wood after a while

[47:36] and I wish that it just had better layout like the that's just my thing

[47:47] oh let's see bill brand is well bill the thing is is when you when you have I didn't really have

[48:00] an option I had a pregnant wife and uh and yeah like people who bought in these burbs years ago

[48:10] they made out but the thing is is you're not really making out if you want to stay in the town you

[48:15] love so for example like these houses might have gone for six seven hundred thousand now they go

[48:21] for one five and like five six years we just got it appraised but if you love your house in

[48:30] row eight and and you even if you made eight hundred thousand dollars you know on top of what you

[48:37] paid for it you you'd have to pay one five to live in the house you're currently in so what do you

[48:43] get it wait unless you're like retiring and you're caching out or you came in as a you know a developer

[48:49] or you bought these properties to flip which most people don't and you know my dad always said this

[48:56] like you need you need a home and the equity you put into your home pays you back in in priceless

[49:02] ways and and that's the thing is like I wake up every day in a good mood for the most part in this

[49:07] house for the most part not every day I love where I live I did not love my Murray Hill apartment

[49:15] I did not love Murray Hill I loved things about New York City but I didn't wake up in New York City

[49:21] and say I love this place I loved it when I was 22 and I had an apartment in New York City

[49:28] I loved it when I was you know in my 20s going out late having a place to sleep always having a

[49:35] lot of room at my own place my own bathroom my own bed it was great but this is a home and when I

[49:42] wake up in the morning and I hear the voices of killing and Cassian and Brenda and we're down there

[49:49] having a cup of coffee and you hear the birds chirping and the sun's coming through the windows

[49:54] and fading your cabinet although it's not fading because I got UV film I'm happy you know it's I don't

[50:02] I don't need anything more um that's it you don't need a home you need the next home

[50:12] you know it's funny uh you know my dad would always say when my dad was in his prime of his career

[50:19] and you know he probably should have diversified some of his wealth into some real estate or maybe

[50:25] just one piece of property like he always loved the Jersey Shore he didn't but I will say I love

[50:32] watching my dad's decisions in life because he always lived well below his means

[50:39] and now he's also very happy he's been retired since he's been 55

[50:46] and that's a baller I mean he was kind of forcing to early retirement but to be retired by 55

[50:55] to never have to work a day in your life again make money every year off of your money

[51:01] and then do good for society like my dad drives elderly people around who can't get to things he

[51:09] helps them there he does other things for the community and and it's like

[51:17] you know he's like in a really good space and I talk to my dad every day I love my dad I think he's

[51:23] I think he's a great human being and he's made a lot of sacrifices for his family

[51:28] and if we ever needed anything he'd be there for us and that's the kind of dad I want to be I

[51:33] will never make what my dad makes right now I did not work in finance or M&A I did marketing I mean

[51:41] I mean my job's fun but it does not deliver the equity so it is what it is

[51:48] is that you know he's helping out he's helping out

[51:51] the uh think about corporate American nowadays is with these companies is like they don't give

[51:58] you the equity they used to so you know my dad's day like much way more stock options way more

[52:06] uh you know they did 401k's my dad did one early on when nobody did and and then he also

[52:12] they got he has a pension the concept of a pension now in these corporate jobs does not

[52:20] exist see we've replaced pensions with 401k and that's dangerous you know many people I know my

[52:28] age and I'm there you know when they they get cut loose they get cut loose right before their kids

[52:34] are going to college they get cut loose they still got that mortgage payment they get cut loose

[52:39] they've got all those luxury car payments not where you want to be

[52:44] saving money is smart I just had to drop 10k on surgery for borrow though yeah you know dog surgery

[52:53] man and france I hope he's doing okay dog surgery is like it's like it's a must like there's no

[53:00] question like you it's you love these pups like they're your children you know someone once said

[53:07] something to me about just life and value what we value like if someone knocked on my door right

[53:12] now and said I'll give you 10 million dollars for killing it I mean like no like that's it if

[53:18] someone knocked on my door and said I'll give you $10,000 for guns and roses collectives edition

[53:24] I'd probably take it I'd probably take it yeah I just get it out of here I'll just take it 10 yeah

[53:32] I'm I'm definitely getting this thing down this stairs is going to be a lot easier than getting

[53:37] it up because I just slotted down all right so gang how many of you think you're going to buy

[53:46] one of these games in April we got predator we got King Kong we've got Harry Potter let's talk

[53:51] Potter let's talk Potter I think there's an 80% chance Jersey Jack's gonna mess up Harry Potter

[53:59] I think I think the reason Potter is gonna be messed up I think it's gonna have muted clips

[54:05] and I think there's gonna be a lot of toys and I think it's gonna be more wide open and fast like

[54:09] Godfather I don't think it's gonna be loaded I don't think there's gonna be upper playfields lower

[54:13] playfields I don't think it's gonna have like the magic it needs that's and I'm basing that

[54:21] on seeing everything Jersey Jack has made over the last four years I think Potter is gonna

[54:30] Disappoint I hope I'm wrong I will be the first to admit I'm wrong

[54:37] I'm gonna order one anyway because I'm gonna

[54:41] I you know what I'm saying like I'm still think you're gonna be able to scalp the CE for money

[54:46] I'm on the record saying

[54:50] Um, I'm on the record saying

[54:53] John what is an EOS switch

[54:55] I don't

[54:57] John can you call me after and let me know where I need to look on this guns or roses to fix those two switches I'm having problems with

[55:07] I what I don't get

[55:09] Hey like I don't think anyone's still ordering avatar

[55:16] I just wonder now

[55:19] But if hans if those switches weren't working wouldn't

[55:23] And

[55:24] Wouldn't the um flippers not work right everything's everything plays fine. So I don't understand like what's up with the end of stroke

[55:33] Well, I like I think if they make a thousand at 15k pop like come on

[55:39] I don't think they're gonna be hard to get but I think right away Harry Potter CE sells out instantly because no one's gonna want the Ellie for 12

[55:46] Jersey Jack has made the 12,000 Ellie a fool's purchase

[55:51] It's like look at avatar Ellie's are already already in the $9,000 range

[55:58] I don't think there's no way they sold a thousand avatar CE's there's no way

[56:05] Oh, by the way, I was happy to see jeng is chimed in on on my Facebook page. It was nice. It was just like a

[56:10] It's just nice like a normal pinball thing like no jabbing no this just hey man like talk to you and art just

[56:17] Come back hang out

[56:20] You know

[56:22] Um

[56:25] I think they're nervous

[56:27] Because the pressure right there's no pressure on king Kong there's no pressure

[56:32] There's no pressure

[56:34] I mean stir needs a hit and and it'll be a hit

[56:38] But there is gonna be so much pressure on Jersey jack because with Jersey jack Harry Potter

[56:45] We are gonna know right away if they nailed it or not like I mean like right away

[56:51] You know what I'm saying

[56:52] Like we're gonna know right away

[56:55] And and we're we've become really good at seeing through the BS of their launch videos

[57:02] Like through the BS of their launch videos. Let me see if I can pull up

[57:05] Because I I'm let me see if I can do this. Let me see if I can pull up

[57:10] the um

[57:12] That let's let's look at the launch video. So Jersey jack jjp avatar launch video

[57:18] And I want to pull up the blue light

[57:21] Avatar launch

[57:24] Video

[57:25] Video

[57:27] Because it's like I haven't looked at it in a while

[57:32] and

[57:34] Where's yeah, yeah, I mean

[57:38] You can see it in the 30 seconds

[57:40] Okay, hold on. Let me see if I can do this. I mess up every time I try to share screen share screen

[57:47] All right, let's do this

[57:54] Can you guys see this when I go to this avatar screen? Did you see the avatar screen?

[58:00] Can can you see it now?

[58:05] Let's play it

[58:10] It's

[58:16] In the idea

[58:18] You know, I want to go back to that one shot.

[58:40] Let's see.

[58:41] Hold on.

[58:42] I think my screen is back to the...

[58:49] Hold on.

[58:52] Yeah, they have...

[58:57] It also shows you your multi-ball progress for both multi-balls, your song cord, mode progress, for both movies.

[59:10] And it also shows you your Savaco mode progress.

[59:13] Avocado mode is the challenge.

[59:16] All right, here we're lighting.

[59:17] One thing I really wanted was to be able to play this game in the dark.

[59:22] On Pandora, you see everything in the daylight.

[59:25] It's not until nighttime comes and you can see all that glow.

[59:29] So we needed to bring that into the game.

[59:32] So we introduced red, green, and blue UV inks on the play field.

[59:36] It doesn't look like that, though.

[59:37] UV spotlights everywhere.

[59:39] UV hot rails.

[59:41] UV back panel lighting.

[59:43] We have ultraviolet inks.

[59:45] And ultraviolet lighting.

[59:47] And really it brings the world of Pandora right to you.

[59:49] On the CE, three colors of UV to get the full bioluminesse experience.

[59:54] Yeah, it doesn't look like that.

[59:55] It doesn't look like that.

[59:56] They never get that amazing.

[59:58] They're bright.

[01:00:01] The Avatar franchise.

[01:00:03] It's come to light when the lights are dimmed around you.

[01:00:06] And the lights on this play field come up and you're seeing the bioluminescence.

[01:00:11] You see any inserts getting lit up from underneath.

[01:00:15] Each insert.

[01:00:17] There is UV lighting.

[01:00:19] So they can light individual inserts with UV light as well as flood lights.

[01:00:22] There you go.

[01:00:23] Okay, right.

[01:00:24] It's an unbelievable lighting package.

[01:00:25] Right.

[01:00:26] Yeah, it's with UV light as well as flood lights around the play field.

[01:00:28] Okay.

[01:00:29] So you see how.

[01:00:32] Do you see all this here?

[01:00:37] Like look at all of the tattoos on their bodies are lit.

[01:00:42] You this doesn't it the game never delivers this level of of any of it.

[01:00:48] It's crazy.

[01:00:50] It's crazy.

[01:00:51] That I mean, that was such a bait and switch.

[01:00:54] Such a bait and switch.

[01:00:57] So I don't know how to get a

[01:01:00] number.

[01:01:02] Carol Hardes in the house So carry.

[01:01:04] Carry so you're now the the only one in here who is seeing portal.

[01:01:10] So carry your you're saying this game is going to be a hit.

[01:01:13] What carry.

[01:01:14] Come on describe something.

[01:01:15] What would you see?

[01:01:16] Did you see a ball go into one portal and come out the other.

[01:01:20] Did you see that.

[01:01:21] What are we going to get?

[01:01:22] What are we going to get.

[01:01:23] I mean, we're all gonna see it on Monday.

[01:01:25] You've got 48 hours of exclusivity.

[01:01:30] What are we gonna get?

[01:01:31] I mean, I hope Jerry gave you some exclusivity here.

[01:01:35] I'm a carry Patreon member.

[01:01:39] I subscribe to Carrie Hardy's show.

[01:01:41] He subscribes to mine.

[01:01:42] Carrie, thank you for being here.

[01:01:44] What are we gonna see?

[01:01:47] Give us something.

[01:01:48] Give us just write out what you saw.

[01:01:51] We don't have to, I don't expect any images.

[01:01:58] He's not saying anything.

[01:01:59] Where'd Carrie go?

[01:02:01] Where'd he go?

[01:02:04] I wish we could invite people on camera to hear.

[01:02:08] It'd be fun.

[01:02:09] Why don't they let you do that?

[01:02:12] I don't know why.

[01:02:13] Maybe is there an option to do that?

[01:02:15] I don't know.

[01:02:17] Eight thumbs ups.

[01:02:19] Watch the trailer last night looking good.

[01:02:29] Okay.

[01:02:30] Do you get to release it a little early?

[01:02:33] I'm just curious.

[01:02:36] When you get in bargoed,

[01:02:42] that's how I'm like, okay, we'll give us something more.

[01:02:48] Yeah, Jerry's going into a portal

[01:02:50] and actually making a normal pinball machine.

[01:02:52] That would be the smartest move.

[01:02:58] Yeah, I don't know.

[01:02:59] Look, if Jerry asked me to sign an NDA to see the game,

[01:03:04] I would.

[01:03:06] Of course.

[01:03:08] I love hyping games.

[01:03:09] I love getting people excited about games.

[01:03:11] The thing is, I just, it's almost like to me,

[01:03:18] haters will at least golf clap at this game.

[01:03:20] Well, the thing is with P3 man is the problem is

[01:03:25] that you can't look at any single P3 game in isolation.

[01:03:28] Right?

[01:03:29] Like if I look at Dungeons and Dragons,

[01:03:32] I can just have an opinion about this game.

[01:03:36] I can decide whether or not I want it 100% based on what's

[01:03:41] in that game.

[01:03:42] When portal comes out and I might want one,

[01:03:46] I can't look at just portal.

[01:03:48] I got to ask myself, do I also want the other games

[01:03:52] and do I have, because if you don't want the platform,

[01:03:56] it's not worth buying for just one game.

[01:03:59] So you have to want a variety of what he offers

[01:04:03] and then you have to do the math on that.

[01:04:05] So then you're in like, 10, $12,000 for the platform,

[01:04:11] 15 for two games, 18 for three games.

[01:04:14] I get it's cheaper than buying three Stern Ali's

[01:04:17] or three Stern premiums, but it's a big buy,

[01:04:21] but you don't get this like uniquely beautiful thing

[01:04:29] that is beautiful when it's on, when it's off,

[01:04:31] it's dedicated.

[01:04:33] I just think that's the quagmire of what Jerry

[01:04:38] brings to the market.

[01:04:39] Yeah, I mean, look, Carrie, I haven't heard people talk

[01:04:47] about portal in maybe 15 years.

[01:04:54] Has anybody played portal in the last 10 years?

[01:04:59] So that's my thing is I just, I don't think portal

[01:05:03] is as relevant with this target audience,

[01:05:07] as Sonic, as Super Mario, as I mean, even Halo's

[01:05:12] got more current day appeal.

[01:05:15] So I just to your point, yes, it feels right

[01:05:20] for the platform, but a lot of people in Timbara

[01:05:25] like nothing feels right for the platform

[01:05:27] because the platform isn't right for most people.

[01:05:35] All right, cool.

[01:05:36] Now, I guess the thing Carrie, like what I'm excited

[01:05:39] to see and we saw this with Princess Bride,

[01:05:42] it's seeming like Jerry is offering

[01:05:45] what seemingly looks much more like a dedicated cabinet

[01:05:49] in a game for these new launches.

[01:05:53] Like there's a dedicated Princess Bride

[01:05:57] collectors edition available.

[01:06:01] You know, I'm just thinking,

[01:06:02] I think this game's gonna have like a topper

[01:06:05] that's playable.

[01:06:07] I think this game is, I think something's gonna go

[01:06:10] into a portal on the lower below the glass

[01:06:12] and I think there's gonna be a game above it,

[01:06:15] or maybe in the back box event, because think about it.

[01:06:18] That whole back box area is, I think,

[01:06:22] I think this is gonna, I think they're gonna have

[01:06:23] something unique.

[01:06:25] I mean, if I'm thinking about how you would do portal,

[01:06:28] I'm like a bonsai run though damn thing, all right, maybe.

[01:06:32] Oh, Halo's not a good theme for Pimble.

[01:06:38] I, 90% of the Pimble buying demographic

[01:06:43] would rather have the A team or Magnum PI over Halo.

[01:06:50] One day people are gonna actually realize

[01:06:52] what nostalgia does, how nostalgia buying power is,

[01:06:56] French he gets it, Superman's from the 70s Wonder Woman,

[01:07:01] this stuff is what people want, purple rain.

[01:07:04] Nostalgia will sell way better than video game properties

[01:07:10] that are kind of fatigued a little bit, that are newer.

[01:07:14] Sonic is nostalgic, but like Sega Genesis, Sega, like Sonic.

[01:07:19] If Jersey Jack makes the Sonic movies, not so much,

[01:07:22] I don't want the Sonic movies, I don't connect with that.

[01:07:31] Kevin and Buffalo Pimble.

[01:07:41] Yeah, I mean, look, I hear good things about final resistance,

[01:07:43] but again, I don't hear it from many people.

[01:07:47] It's like D&D, you know, it's like,

[01:07:49] doesn't it feel like D&D hype is gone?

[01:07:52] Is it just me?

[01:07:54] I'm just not, I don't know, that hype lasted for like,

[01:07:58] a couple of weeks.

[01:08:00] And maybe it was the motor problems,

[01:08:02] but like, I just don't feel like D&D.

[01:08:06] Is it me?

[01:08:07] I don't know, like I just don't see the conversation,

[01:08:11] snowballing around how amazing D&D is.

[01:08:15] And I don't know if like the randomizing has happened.

[01:08:18] I think there's a lot of buggin'-ish in the code.

[01:08:21] Well, is D&D good?

[01:08:23] Is it like, is it like,

[01:08:25] in comparison to the stern machines

[01:08:29] that have become iconic is D&D,

[01:08:33] like, I get, look, there's always launch parties everywhere.

[01:08:37] And I could even drive to automate it today.

[01:08:39] I might even do that, to be honest.

[01:08:40] I might just go after this, just go for an hour.

[01:08:44] I'm just curious, I'm just curious.

[01:08:48] Did John get one at Jack Bar?

[01:08:55] Yeah, I've just heard a lot of like,

[01:08:57] buggin'-ish in the code.

[01:08:58] I'm, gang, I'm not knocking D&D, as I've said.

[01:09:01] I'm just, I'm just not hearing the overwhelming

[01:09:07] like, love for the game.

[01:09:09] And again, I think it's because a lot of people are like,

[01:09:13] realize what's coming in April.

[01:09:15] I do, I think, I think there's like,

[01:09:18] a lot of curiosity with every new stern,

[01:09:20] but I just don't think D&D

[01:09:24] is gonna push a lot of people to pay and fall

[01:09:26] for a new-in-box version.

[01:09:29] Evil dead is 10 times better?

[01:09:33] No, I wouldn't, no, Albert, Albert,

[01:09:35] I'm never buying a D&D.

[01:09:38] I'm never buying a D&D, it's not my thing.

[01:09:42] We put D&D kids in headlocks in school.

[01:09:46] Yeah, is that, is that, is that called bullying?

[01:09:49] We bullied them?

[01:09:51] I mean, see, I was like the geek

[01:09:55] who made fun of the D&D geeks,

[01:09:57] and then the jocks beat us up.

[01:09:58] You know what I'm saying?

[01:10:00] Everyone was like on the pecking order of who bullied you.

[01:10:07] At the bottom of people that got bullied the worst,

[01:10:10] it was D&D kids.

[01:10:12] You know what I'm saying?

[01:10:14] Like, the street fighter kids,

[01:10:16] and the transformer kids, like,

[01:10:18] put the D&D kids in headlocks.

[01:10:22] And then the jocks put us street fighter kids

[01:10:25] in headlocks when we would kick their butts

[01:10:27] with our street fighter characters.

[01:10:49] Bullying?

[01:10:51] Are we still making fun of the way I announce

[01:10:54] the eight certain words I think we are?

[01:10:59] I'll tell you this.

[01:11:01] When we were kids though,

[01:11:03] like getting bullied a little bit and made fun of,

[01:11:06] like, people developed some grit and ability

[01:11:09] to sort of take the punishment.

[01:11:12] We all got it.

[01:11:15] Kids these days, like,

[01:11:17] they can't handle anything.

[01:11:19] Let me tell you a quick story real quick.

[01:11:21] I'm working with some like junior talent at work.

[01:11:24] And the moment it's not going smoothly,

[01:11:27] they send you notes how,

[01:11:28] unless you make it more comfortable for them,

[01:11:30] they're not sure they can work on the business with you.

[01:11:34] Okay.

[01:11:37] Not sure that's how it works.

[01:11:39] Not sure that's how it works.

[01:11:41] I'm not sure you tell your senior,

[01:11:44] the senior leads on the account that they,

[01:11:48] you need to change to appease them.

[01:11:51] I think it's the other way around.

[01:11:53] I think when you're junior,

[01:11:55] you do what it takes.

[01:11:57] You figure out the pain points.

[01:11:59] You find the solutions and you deliver results.

[01:12:02] That's how you get promoted.

[01:12:04] That's how you make more money.

[01:12:05] That's how you impress the senior leadership.

[01:12:07] I mean, I'm pretty sure that's how you're supposed to do it.

[01:12:10] I think that's how you're supposed to do it.

[01:12:13] Nope.

[01:12:14] It's the opposite now.

[01:12:16] They're telling us what we need to do to make their careers

[01:12:20] more comfortable, ridiculous.

[01:12:22] It's ridiculous.

[01:12:23] It's like it's funny to me.

[01:12:25] It's funny to me.

[01:12:26] You know, it makes me laugh.

[01:12:28] It does make me laugh.

[01:12:30] It's, yeah.

[01:12:32] Yeah.

[01:12:33] Can't say anything though.

[01:12:35] You know, you know,

[01:12:36] and the thing is,

[01:12:37] in today's day and age,

[01:12:38] you can't say anything.

[01:12:40] You got to be very careful.

[01:12:41] But you know what they, you know what they do?

[01:12:44] You know what they do?

[01:12:45] You know what they do is they,

[01:12:47] they put stuff in writing they never should.

[01:12:51] Yeah.

[01:12:52] A little advice for everybody here.

[01:12:54] If you ever want to say something

[01:12:59] that could be taken the wrong way,

[01:13:03] and context is important,

[01:13:06] and you wouldn't say it to the CEO of the company,

[01:13:10] don't put it in writing.

[01:13:13] And because people screen grab,

[01:13:17] share it with other people that are,

[01:13:19] you know, like you're just.

[01:13:24] Some advice.

[01:13:27] It's crazy what people do.

[01:13:28] And you got to know who to trust.

[01:13:30] I think that's the thing too is I think,

[01:13:33] when people are entitled and young,

[01:13:35] they, they, they,

[01:13:36] they think they're feeling,

[01:13:38] they think their feelings are valid

[01:13:41] and should be shared universally,

[01:13:43] regardless of the recipient.

[01:13:46] You ever notice that?

[01:13:47] A kid just think they can tell you how they feel,

[01:13:50] like you give it to him.

[01:13:52] Like you're not my child.

[01:13:54] You're my coworker.

[01:13:56] And, and I get it, but, but,

[01:13:59] but don't open up,

[01:14:00] don't open up to me when what you're opening up about

[01:14:03] is like flat out criticism of how

[01:14:06] we're running this business or the clients or the work stream.

[01:14:09] You know, it's like,

[01:14:11] come with solutions.

[01:14:12] It's, it's just funny to me.

[01:14:14] It's funny to me because it never works out for people who do that.

[01:14:19] Ah, what?

[01:14:21] Gang, my,

[01:14:24] my meltdown.

[01:14:26] Man.

[01:14:27] Now, let me ask you a question, Albert.

[01:14:29] If you got almost a hundred more,

[01:14:31] you, if you got almost a hundred more votes

[01:14:34] and lost a favorite pinball podcast category.

[01:14:39] Would you be a little bit like upset or confused?

[01:14:42] I don't know.

[01:14:43] I'll tell you why I lost is because my damn fans didn't even show up.

[01:14:47] The last time I won, I had over 600 votes for first place.

[01:14:50] This time only 200 and something.

[01:14:53] I don't get it.

[01:14:54] Collins, like more people voted than ever before.

[01:14:56] How, how, how did more people vote when I had 400 less votes?

[01:15:01] I think by having 30 people on the drop down,

[01:15:05] he diluted all the voting for sure.

[01:15:08] Because before we remember, it was just the top like eight or 10

[01:15:11] and then you had to write in the rest.

[01:15:15] I mean, that, that's just like, so whatever.

[01:15:18] It, it became what it became.

[01:15:21] Geno, bossy.

[01:15:24] I'm crying about this.

[01:15:26] Is that, is it in my crying right now?

[01:15:29] Weird. Like people are weird.

[01:15:31] I don't even understand.

[01:15:32] Do people even know what crying is?

[01:15:34] I'm just talking about it, bro.

[01:15:35] Relax.

[01:15:36] I don't care.

[01:15:37] I've had sexual relations since then with a super hot wife.

[01:15:40] I do not care about the Twippies.

[01:15:43] I won't be promoting the Twippies anymore.

[01:15:46] I've, I've come to peace with it.

[01:15:49] I'm glad, Cal one.

[01:15:52] And I just won't make it part of my annual thing anymore.

[01:15:56] I won't be supporting the shows.

[01:15:58] I won't, I won't be like discouraging people from.

[01:16:01] Like if people want to vote, they can vote.

[01:16:02] I don't care.

[01:16:03] I just won't be outwardly asking people to vote ever again.

[01:16:08] I think it's, I think they got exactly what they wanted.

[01:16:13] And the show has been a technical disaster.

[01:16:16] Not even about who wins or loses.

[01:16:18] The show has been a technical disaster for years.

[01:16:21] And until they can do it right,

[01:16:23] I think that it's a terrible display.

[01:16:27] It's a terrible way to reward the best in Pimble,

[01:16:31] because it's so sloppily done.

[01:16:34] And it's embarrassing.

[01:16:36] Like if you did not know this hobby,

[01:16:38] and there's millions of dollars,

[01:16:40] like tens of millions of dollars being made by these companies,

[01:16:43] like Stern, and you know, this is, this is like a $200 million industry.

[01:16:48] Right?

[01:16:49] And that's your award show for a $200 million industry.

[01:16:54] Maybe it's $150 million, $100 million, at least.

[01:17:04] But anyway, am I up for a degenerate award

[01:17:08] or whatever that is today?

[01:17:10] Is that the gennies or whatever they call it?

[01:17:12] The, the, the genges is.

[01:17:14] I should do the genges.

[01:17:18] Yeah, no, it's fine.

[01:17:19] Gen.

[01:17:20] Believe me.

[01:17:21] Believe me.

[01:17:22] I don't, when I walk in my garage and I see six twippies up there,

[01:17:25] it makes me smile.

[01:17:27] You know, it is what it is.

[01:17:30] What I, what I love is, is that we still have a great subscriber base.

[01:17:36] We've lost some people.

[01:17:38] We're below 700.

[01:17:39] I'm moving in the wrong direction.

[01:17:41] You know, look, maybe I'll do,

[01:17:43] I'm going to want to do more interviews.

[01:17:45] I got to get a new laptop.

[01:17:47] All of my MacBook Airs have broken.

[01:17:50] So I need a new one.

[01:17:52] Yeah, well, you know what?

[01:17:55] Them the brakes.

[01:17:56] Them the brakes.

[01:17:58] When you do it live, the tech can't go down.

[01:18:04] Look, if, if any of us won, you know, not just like Pimball,

[01:18:07] but like, there's awards in my industry.

[01:18:09] Like, the, the emphasis on awards is always funny.

[01:18:12] You know what matters in life?

[01:18:14] Money.

[01:18:15] If you're good at something, find a way to get paid for it.

[01:18:19] Make some money.

[01:18:21] All right.

[01:18:22] Make some money.

[01:18:23] If you put in the time, the effort, you make the content,

[01:18:27] you, you entertain.

[01:18:28] Like, I'm not, like, no one's getting rich.

[01:18:30] But just make a buck or two.

[01:18:33] The amount of effort we put into this.

[01:18:36] And look, the people who donate and subscribe,

[01:18:38] they feel good.

[01:18:39] They're kicking a little coin to their favorite content creators.

[01:18:42] It's a good cycle.

[01:18:44] The community's great.

[01:18:45] I love the Patreon chat.

[01:18:46] I love the Canadian community.

[01:18:48] I love that, you know, the Facebook community we have.

[01:18:51] It's fun.

[01:18:52] You know, people, if you're new to Pimball,

[01:18:54] and you just sort of discovered all the,

[01:18:57] the games, the manufacturers, the content that's out there now,

[01:19:00] congratulations.

[01:19:01] Like the prices suck.

[01:19:03] But you have more options than ever before.

[01:19:05] You do.

[01:19:06] And, and, you know,

[01:19:08] that's good.

[01:19:09] That is good.

[01:19:10] And most, almost everybody's,

[01:19:13] you can go find content for free and make up your mind.

[01:19:18] And I love that we've got more voices now than ever before.

[01:19:23] There's not as many carries and canadas out there,

[01:19:28] as I would like.

[01:19:30] But who cares?

[01:19:33] Who cares?

[01:19:34] Let's talk about Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[01:19:36] I was looking at the game, and I was texting Melvin.

[01:19:40] Beautiful game.

[01:19:41] Sometimes I forget how beautiful it is.

[01:19:43] I know there's not a lot in it.

[01:19:45] I know it doesn't have the greatest layout.

[01:19:47] But man, it's a beautiful game.

[01:19:50] It's a beautiful game.

[01:19:52] And there's not enough honesty in the Pimball content creator community.

[01:19:57] I mean, yes and no.

[01:20:01] You know, the thing about honesty is what,

[01:20:05] there's no, these are very subjective takes, right?

[01:20:10] And people love Pimball.

[01:20:14] And it brings them enjoyment.

[01:20:16] And it's an overpriced toy.

[01:20:18] They're all overpriced.

[01:20:19] You know this.

[01:20:20] So it's like a super expensive toy.

[01:20:22] Most of the world is living in poverty.

[01:20:24] Most of the world, the medium income,

[01:20:27] I think on planet earth, is something like $8,000.

[01:20:30] That's the, if you take everybody on the planet,

[01:20:33] the average amount of money someone has in a year is $8,000.

[01:20:37] And we are buying $15,000 toys when we already have like a bunch of them in our homes.

[01:20:43] And we're all very privileged.

[01:20:45] We're all very spoiled.

[01:20:47] And the, the, the, the, the hobby is meant to give people satisfaction.

[01:20:55] Right?

[01:20:56] You know, you don't, it's so weird to be in a hobby where you're like angry about the thing you're in the hobby.

[01:21:02] To appreciate.

[01:21:03] Now, what I love about Canadian Pimball podcast and how I look at this hobby is I look at the market of Pimball.

[01:21:12] I look at the creativity.

[01:21:13] I look at the theme integration.

[01:21:15] I look at these a little bit differently than a player who plays a lot who wants to talk about the gameplay.

[01:21:22] It's, which is good.

[01:21:24] There's balance there.

[01:21:25] I can't get access to every single game.

[01:21:28] Getting them, getting time on them.

[01:21:30] I'm going to get better at it.

[01:21:32] Trust me.

[01:21:33] But I also think for most of us, the reason why my show resonates with so many people is this is how the manufacturers treat us when they want our money.

[01:21:43] So you got to remember that that 95% of Pimball sales happen before anyone even plays the game.

[01:21:52] So just think about that for a moment.

[01:21:54] That 95% of like when it comes to like LEDs and the collectibles and the nicest version of these games, 100% of them usually are sold before anybody even has any time on the machine.

[01:22:08] So that's why Canadian Pimball podcast is kind of in it with you.

[01:22:13] Like we're sharing the same headspace when a game gets announced or revealed.

[01:22:18] You're going to get content in real time.

[01:22:21] Here's what my thoughts are.

[01:22:23] My impressions.

[01:22:24] I do.

[01:22:25] I think they nailed it.

[01:22:26] Do I think it's worth it?

[01:22:27] Do I think this game's going to lose $4,000 in six months?

[01:22:29] All that should be going through your head.

[01:22:31] All that.

[01:22:32] And you know how is the game going to play cool, but you can't play it yet.

[01:22:35] They want my money today, but I can't play it yet.

[01:22:39] And they don't care to get the content creators, the machines.

[01:22:43] So we can give you an opinion because we don't have enough.

[01:22:47] You know, we don't have enough.

[01:22:48] It's not worth it for us.

[01:22:50] People they give machines to are course are going to be positive.

[01:22:54] More on the side of showing or helping the companies sell the product.

[01:23:00] It's you know, it is what it is.

[01:23:02] It is what it is.

[01:23:03] Now, and we look, we know there's not transparency in dealers and distros.

[01:23:09] Working hand in hand with content creators to create sales like objects.

[01:23:15] You know, not editorial like content.

[01:23:20] Like I'm an editorial like show.

[01:23:24] These are, I'm opinions that are fundamentally, I arrive at my opinions not to help the companies sell games,

[01:23:33] not to help my distributor friend who's going to give me a game, move some of his units.

[01:23:39] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[01:23:40] Like there, there is, yes, there is absolutely some incentives by others to help sell product.

[01:23:50] And that's fine.

[01:23:51] As long as you're transparent about that, 100% fine.

[01:23:53] I don't mind it.

[01:23:55] Where there isn't really transparency.

[01:23:57] Sometimes, you know, you'll see the ad for the dealer in front of the content,

[01:24:01] but they're not telling you that I've also been paid for this content in the form of like maybe,

[01:24:08] you know, a machine or a discount or whatever.

[01:24:13] Ah, I hate to be a newbie though.

[01:24:16] I'd hate to be a newbie.

[01:24:18] I think being a newbie now, and you can see it on Pinside gang.

[01:24:22] You know where you see newbies?

[01:24:23] I'm a man, I bought my first pin, it's John Wick.

[01:24:25] I saw this on Pinside.

[01:24:26] I bought my first pin, it's John like, oh man, you might like who?

[01:24:29] Who buys John Wick as their first pin?

[01:24:31] And you look on Pinside and you see a whole new group of grown men with usually they've been paid.

[01:24:37] Usually they've got around 50 to 250 posts on Pinside.

[01:24:43] That's the easiest way to spot a newbie.

[01:24:46] You know, then you got these guys like Iceman with like 38,000 posts.

[01:24:50] Right?

[01:24:51] Let's look right now on Pinside.

[01:24:54] How many?

[01:24:55] Let's go into a threat.

[01:24:56] Let's do this.

[01:24:57] Let's do this right now.

[01:24:58] Let me, this can be funny.

[01:24:59] Let's go to Pinside.

[01:25:01] And let's look at like a threat.

[01:25:04] And you can see, you know, where there's just like some people that have so many, so many posts.

[01:25:16] Um, let's see stock market traders.

[01:25:21] I just love.

[01:25:30] Okay.

[01:25:38] I mean, God bless, Doug.

[01:25:42] 28,000.

[01:25:45] 387 posts.

[01:25:49] I mean, just think about.

[01:25:52] 28,000.

[01:25:54] Let's go. Let's go down.

[01:25:55] Let's get some other threats.

[01:25:56] I want to see like,

[01:25:58] I was going to John Wick thread.

[01:26:00] You see like, you can see the difference.

[01:26:04] John Wick.

[01:26:06] John Wick owners club.

[01:26:16] I mean, even when you see the John Wick owners club, right?

[01:26:20] This guy's got 279 posts.

[01:26:23] 279 posts.

[01:26:26] Now, 13,000 is a lot.

[01:26:28] This guy's got 120 posts.

[01:26:30] You know, let's go up.

[01:26:32] Let's go up and see a few more.

[01:26:37] All right.

[01:26:38] This guy is talking about he bought the game.

[01:26:39] He's got the game, right?

[01:26:40] He's got 73 posts.

[01:26:43] 73 posts.

[01:26:49] You know, and you look at all these guys, John Wick, 202, 447.

[01:26:55] You know, this is MK6, you know, it's like these guys, like these newbies.

[01:26:58] It's like they, there's a lot of new guys that have jumped into the hub.

[01:27:03] They're just getting started.

[01:27:07] These guys got his game room, you know, 202 posts.

[01:27:10] Got a John Wick.

[01:27:11] He's got a damn rush, like, you know, arcade machine.

[01:27:15] He's got.

[01:27:17] You could tell like this looks, this looks does, this looks just like.

[01:27:22] And I mean, this looks, this looks just like a dude that got into the hobby.

[01:27:26] And this is a great visual.

[01:27:28] Because to me, this is like when you get bit by the bug of, I'm going to, as a grown man, I'm going to go back.

[01:27:39] And I'm going to put arcade machines, neon signs, movie posters, like speed limit sign.

[01:27:46] Like this is what you do.

[01:27:48] You, the game room becomes the thing.

[01:27:51] It's the gateway.

[01:27:52] I'm going to turn this space into something that's me, like the inner child and me needs some, and I did it.

[01:28:02] I turned a one bedroom apartment into a freaking little arcade, that like game room that went viral.

[01:28:07] Like it's, it's what happens.

[01:28:09] Like you just get so excited that you can now create a really, really fun space for yourself.

[01:28:15] Now this is driving me crazy here.

[01:28:18] This, this like, I don't know what's happening here, but like this angle here where this is cutting into.

[01:28:27] You know, yeah, I love to, I love to like look at people's like setups.

[01:28:34] We should be nice to the newbies.

[01:28:36] Albert, don't be such a, a flake.

[01:28:41] We should be nice to the newbies.

[01:28:44] Now, man, you got to, you got to pay your dues.

[01:28:47] When you roll into a new hobby, you got to pay your dues.

[01:28:50] You see the newbies, the stir needs the newbies.

[01:28:53] You need the suckers to buy the 13,000 dollar John Wick, Elise.

[01:28:57] You need them. They're suckers.

[01:28:59] Think about like if you're, if you bought a John Wick, Elise, I'm like, oh man, I just lost 4,000 miles.

[01:29:04] Cause I didn't know any better.

[01:29:06] So in my honest opinion, being nice to newbies is quickly educating them.

[01:29:13] Don't buy a 13,000 dollar venom.

[01:29:16] Don't buy a 15,000 dollar godfather.

[01:29:18] The problem is these newbies discover the hobby more through the lens of the happy go lucky shell content creators.

[01:29:28] And they don't realize, wait, this is guy called canada that would have saved me $10,000.

[01:29:34] If I just didn't buy James Bond, Ali and X Men Ali, why didn't I listen to canada?

[01:29:40] He only charges $5 a month.

[01:29:42] And whenever he asks people to up at 10, these grown men start complaining like babies and then they'll spend $2,000 on a plastic topper.

[01:29:51] And hey, you know, he's got a point.

[01:29:55] He's got a point.

[01:29:56] We just lost 10 grand on two games.

[01:29:59] And if we just listen to canada, wait and see.

[01:30:03] We would have been able to buy those games and save 10 grand.

[01:30:07] I mean, just think about, you know, you think about the connection and $10,000 in Tesla stock like 12 years ago is now worth 1.8 million.

[01:30:16] You know, you think about it.

[01:30:17] Like you guys were in this hobby 10 years, 12 years ago.

[01:30:20] You saved 10,000 you put it in something, let it roll.

[01:30:23] It's better than letting it roll on John Wick, Ali.

[01:30:27] Love it.

[01:30:28] Hindsight's 2020 though, which we all did that, right?

[01:30:31] Heck, 10 years ago, if we just bought Bitcoin when it was like $1,000 a coin, we would now have $80,000 for each one.

[01:30:41] Like you could have put you would have a $8.8 million.

[01:30:45] Like, yeah, not but pin man, but pins.

[01:30:50] But yeah, there's a big bang bar prototype for 46,000.

[01:30:54] Let's do this.

[01:30:55] Let's do this.

[01:30:56] Let's do this.

[01:30:57] Everybody.

[01:30:58] Everybody follow canada.

[01:31:00] Let's do this pinball pinball highest price.

[01:31:07] Who wants to be under the sea?

[01:31:14] Oh, going the wrong way.

[01:31:17] Smoking crack prices.

[01:31:23] I love this.

[01:31:24] Let's see this.

[01:31:27] You know, sometimes food is hot.

[01:31:30] All right, like, like, yeah, supreme, 60,000.

[01:31:40] Big bang bar prototype, $44,000.

[01:31:47] Who's the guy smoking crack trying to sell the alvira for 37, 5?

[01:31:51] Who's the crack head?

[01:31:55] The Guns and Roses CE for 34,000.

[01:31:58] That this game, that game is a good $24,000 overpriced.

[01:32:08] I don't even understand it.

[01:32:11] I don't even understand it.

[01:32:14] Like, all these games, like, what is, what happened, man?

[01:32:19] Let's see.

[01:32:21] It gets comical, you know, you got an Avengers for 20.

[01:32:27] Let's do this.

[01:32:28] Let's go.

[01:32:29] Let's look at like where we're, where our fleacing happens.

[01:32:35] And a van search.

[01:32:39] I love looking at it from like, let's see what the, what the big, big money.

[01:32:44] Anything over 16,000.

[01:32:48] All right.

[01:32:51] All right.

[01:32:52] Here we go.

[01:32:53] All right.

[01:32:55] We got a pirate CE for 27.

[01:33:00] A medieval man is royal for 16, 5.

[01:33:05] It's also funny.

[01:33:06] It's like, this guy's selling the same big bang bar for 42.

[01:33:10] Why is it on eBay?

[01:33:11] For the eBay fees?

[01:33:13] This bonds I run is ridiculous.

[01:33:16] Like, I love the, I love this whole like, hept one of two 19,000.

[01:33:22] Again, nobody is buying a 19,000 dollar bonds.

[01:33:26] I run like, you got to actually go on a literal bonds.

[01:33:31] I run and mess up your head to then go buy this bonds.

[01:33:36] I run restored by hept for 19,000.

[01:33:38] Like, it's like, it's just like the dumbest price ever.

[01:33:41] And this is the thing is like, this hobby never was like this.

[01:33:44] Like this is a whole pricing.

[01:33:46] And this is what our community has turned into.

[01:33:51] Look, I would say, Supreme's always been a jackass game.

[01:33:54] That Tron, it's not terribly overpriced in my honest opinion.

[01:33:59] I think that Tron is like within the realm.

[01:34:03] But like, you know, you got pirates, Ellie, selling for 19.

[01:34:09] You know, that's kind of what these, but then you got this crack pipe price.

[01:34:13] 19,000 for a Deadpool.

[01:34:16] 19,000.

[01:34:19] This game was easy to get when it was 8,500.

[01:34:22] Now, my point is I get that it's a great game.

[01:34:25] But this is why the hobby has become kind of stupid in my honest opinion.

[01:34:30] Because if you bought a Deadpool for, for nine grand,

[01:34:34] you're not happy getting 13 back on it.

[01:34:37] You need 19,000.

[01:34:38] You think the demand is there in 19,000.

[01:34:40] These are COVID prices.

[01:34:43] These are COVID prices.

[01:34:46] And there's no way around it.

[01:34:48] And that's one of my issues is like, you need to get this stupid stuff.

[01:34:52] Like a hep Indiana Jones for 21,000.

[01:34:57] You know, dime a dozen.

[01:34:59] I get it to hep.

[01:35:01] But met hep restored Indiana Jones is where like 10, the 12 at most.

[01:35:06] Now.

[01:35:09] This goes busters, Ellie.

[01:35:12] The thing is these games are not moving.

[01:35:14] They're not moving.

[01:35:16] Batman, Ellie.

[01:35:19] 17, 7.

[01:35:21] Pirates, C. 35,000.

[01:35:24] This is so this game.

[01:35:27] This game set, unsold, inboxes for a year.

[01:35:32] And you could have offered 12, 5 and nobody wanted it.

[01:35:37] 35,000 dollars.

[01:35:41] The hell is this sponge bob square pants soccer short shot pinball?

[01:35:46] 150,000 dollars.

[01:35:50] What is going on here?

[01:35:52] I don't even know what this is.

[01:35:53] I can't.

[01:35:54] He's got to have another.

[01:35:58] I mean, I'm not going to be able to see more Metallica's.

[01:36:05] I mean, look at this in L.

[01:36:08] This has got to be yes, year.

[01:36:10] It's Canada, but.

[01:36:17] I mean, look at this one.

[01:36:22] Let's end on this one today.

[01:36:24] Let's just talk about this one.

[01:36:27] What is this?

[01:36:33] This 41,000 euros for a magic girl with a with a fixed kit that doesn't it doesn't make it a real game.

[01:36:44] It's still an incomplete crappy game.

[01:36:49] This is everything that's wrong with the hobby.

[01:36:53] It's like, it's like this is like because to be a collector now is no fun because it's like you're just getting fleeced.

[01:37:02] And you got to go back and remember game when Batman SLE came out for 15,000 dollars.

[01:37:06] I want to go back there.

[01:37:09] When it came out for 15,000 dollars for years.

[01:37:14] And I mean this.

[01:37:17] The games sold between 15 and 18 at most.

[01:37:21] And 15 was a crazy amount.

[01:37:24] Nobody like everyone complained about it then.

[01:37:27] And now it's like 35,000, 48,000, 42,000.

[01:37:33] Like again, because the hobbies turned into like how much money you got.

[01:37:38] You know, if you need to, you know, these rich guys really want something.

[01:37:41] We'll see how badly we can separate them from their common sense with delusional prices.

[01:37:48] And we only need to hook one whale and we're good.

[01:37:52] It's not even my people like these are just delusional people.

[01:37:57] It's delusional people and I'll tell you how somebody's own a magic girl.

[01:38:01] Someone who owns a guns and roses.

[01:38:04] Someone who owned the Lord of the Rings.

[01:38:06] Someone who's owned a Rick and Morty.

[01:38:09] I owned a tells of the Arabian nights.

[01:38:11] I think I've had a good, I've owned a Batman 66.

[01:38:14] I've had a good intimate sampling of the best pinball has had to offer a half.

[01:38:22] No pinball machine is worth more than $10,000.

[01:38:26] It's just, it's just how I feel.

[01:38:28] No pinball machine is really worth more than $10,000.

[01:38:32] We know it.

[01:38:33] We in deep down inside.

[01:38:34] We all know it.

[01:38:36] The collectible side of it is dead.

[01:38:38] It's dead.

[01:38:39] Like there's no one cares anymore.

[01:38:41] Like there's no longer that like I got an L.E.

[01:38:43] I got like even like Metallica.

[01:38:45] Like they're all sliding back down the 13.

[01:38:48] Like it's just no, but it's just the collectible side of pinball was destroyed.

[01:38:53] They overran games.

[01:38:54] They made too many.

[01:38:55] They lied about never making more.

[01:38:57] It's dead.

[01:38:58] To me, the only thing that is rare now is going to be these boutiques when they only make one version of a game.

[01:39:04] And they only make $888 beetle juices.

[01:39:07] Or or Dutch pinball only makes like 2000 back to the futures.

[01:39:11] That's the only thing left in terms of like, you know, what's going to like be collectible.

[01:39:18] But you could argue it's not a bad thing, right?

[01:39:21] We got rid of the collectibles that all the collectors are going to get burned and they did.

[01:39:25] Like all the dudes that marched in who got bit by the collector bug during COVID and went all in on pinball just got annihilated.

[01:39:33] Unniallated.

[01:39:34] All right, everybody.

[01:39:38] We've been doing this for 96 minutes.

[01:39:43] Have a great Saturday.

[01:39:45] It is St Patrick's Day on Monday.

[01:39:47] So have some Jameson.

[01:39:49] Cassian is getting baptized tomorrow.

[01:39:52] And if you are just watching this or you're stumbling upon canada or you just found this whatever.

[01:39:59] We would happily have a love to have you join the Canadian club.

[01:40:02] It's on Patreon.

[01:40:03] Just look for canada spin ball podcast.

[01:40:05] For $5 a month, you now would get unlocked something like 400 shows would be instantly unlocked for free.

[01:40:12] After you give your $5.

[01:40:14] But again, I appreciate all the support gang have a great, have a great weekend.

[01:40:20] And we'll see portal on Monday.

[01:40:22] I'm going to wait to the game is revealed and then I will do a show Monday.

[01:40:26] And then I'm not sure we're going to see anything else new at T. P. F.

[01:40:29] I think it's I think portal is going to have a week to own the spotlight.

[01:40:33] And then nothing.

[01:40:34] And then I think we're going to get the barrels game sometime in early April.

[01:40:39] Everybody later, go hang out with franchi at T. P. F.

[01:40:43] Canada out and stream.

[01:40:45] Yep.
