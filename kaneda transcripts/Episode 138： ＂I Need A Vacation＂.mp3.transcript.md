[00:00] So don't waste your time, how they prove

[00:05] How they prove

[00:10] How they prove

[00:15] Welcome to episode 138 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, the rumors are true. I am going on a vacation. That is why I played a little holiday road for all of you out there. It's been a sort of a, it's been time, it's been time, and I'm excited to go away. I'm going to be away for about a week and a half, two weeks. And during that period,

[00:45] I'm going first to Canada and then I will be going to Las Vegas and I'm going to take a break from doing this podcast during that period. This is not a, a canada of the past meltdown break where we're going away and we're never coming back. This is just so much needed R&R that I need from from from pinball podcasting and also just from thinking about anything. This show does require a lot more work behind the scenes than it might appear. It requires more work.

[01:14] It requires hours and hours of reading.

[01:17] Pen side, it requires talking to people, lining up interviews.

[01:21] And it's a good time for a break.

[01:23] And I think the reason why I think it's a good time,

[01:26] is there's just not that much news going on

[01:28] in the pinball world right now.

[01:30] We got bombarded with tons of news a few weeks ago,

[01:35] a few months ago, watching highway pinball,

[01:38] struggle, watching Dutch pinball,

[01:40] struggle, watching Star Wars get revealed,

[01:42] watching dial, then get shipped, you know,

[01:45] watching attack from Mars, all these things were going on.

[01:48] So we're gonna talk a little bit about

[01:49] what's been going on this summer.

[01:51] And what I hope happens over my two week

[01:54] or so hiatus from Canadian pinball podcast.

[01:58] But we're gonna start out this episode

[02:00] with some of my own news.

[02:03] The first thing that I want to tell you guys

[02:06] is that I am out of on Star Wars.

[02:08] I asked for a refund on the two Star Wars

[02:12] Ellie pinball machines that I had reserved,

[02:15] that I really, really wanted.

[02:17] But the time had come to just bail out.

[02:20] And I want to give you the reasons why I bailed

[02:22] on Star Wars Ellie on June 26, 2017.

[02:31] First I want to thank JJ at Game Exchange

[02:33] for helping me reserve those couple spots.

[02:36] I really appreciate it JJ is an amazing guy.

[02:38] If you're looking to buy a Stern,

[02:40] look no further than Game Exchange

[02:42] in Denver, Colorado.

[02:43] Stand up guy doesn't play around with like

[02:46] getting on a list.

[02:47] He's a straight shooter.

[02:49] And JJ was telling me like a couple of weeks ago

[02:51] you sure you wanna go out.

[02:52] Cause remember I was tinkering with leaving

[02:55] and getting a refund.

[02:56] But the reason why I ultimately decided,

[02:58] I just, you know, I want my money back a few reasons.

[03:00] Number one, as much as much as I try.

[03:05] I can't get over the looks of the game.

[03:07] And I know I haven't even seen the way the game plays.

[03:10] And I'm sure it shoots great.

[03:13] I really am.

[03:14] I'm sure it's a fun game to play.

[03:16] But for the price of the Ellie,

[03:19] I just didn't feel like it looked like a wow game.

[03:24] And once you're getting into that $9,000 price range,

[03:28] I really don't care how good a game shoots.

[03:31] It also has to look as good as it shoots.

[03:34] And I think Star Wars just doesn't for me pop.

[03:38] The way I would want a Star Wars game to visually pop.

[03:42] So that's one of the reasons.

[03:43] I just think I still think the game is kinda ugly

[03:45] if I was gonna be honest.

[03:46] I just don't think it's as good as it could be.

[03:51] And I don't care if there were limitations.

[03:53] I don't care about all that stuff.

[03:54] The end of the day,

[03:55] they're still asking me to spend my money on the product.

[03:59] And if there were limitations

[04:00] and this is the best they could do, that's fine.

[04:03] That's up for other people to decide

[04:04] if it's good enough for them.

[04:06] But as a huge Star Wars fan,

[04:08] it just wasn't good enough for me,

[04:10] from a visual standpoint.

[04:12] Okay.

[04:13] Now the other part of it, look,

[04:16] I've sort of just been annoyed by the rollout of the game.

[04:21] And this constant sort of delay and inability

[04:25] just to show us anything to excite us

[04:27] to wet our appetite on the game.

[04:30] Annoyed me.

[04:31] I don't know about how you feel about it,

[04:33] but I think that Stern really revealed it

[04:37] and then really couldn't give us anything more to go on.

[04:42] Nothing more.

[04:43] Clearly there was a game that had the ability

[04:46] to have the ball go into the hyperdrive.

[04:49] Clearly they gave IGN some access to a game to be played,

[04:53] but then it was just crickets and radio silence.

[04:55] And even as of today, there was a Stern factory tour

[05:00] and then they went on Facebook live with it

[05:02] and then they pulled the video down

[05:04] and people were all these rumors and speculation

[05:06] that there's parts delays

[05:08] and the death star parts are not in and all this stuff.

[05:10] So look, I think Stern is probably having a parts delay

[05:14] and they just had to get the news out there

[05:18] to keep people sort of waiting for it

[05:20] and lock in some money.

[05:22] But look, I was just got tired of waiting too.

[05:25] That's the other thing.

[05:26] At some point you just get tired of having your money

[05:29] frozen with distributors and it's just sitting there.

[05:34] The other part that really was probably

[05:38] the primary decision for me was I got a call

[05:43] from the Dodge dealership that they could order me

[05:46] a demon at MSRP and I decided to place an order for one.

[05:51] I don't know if I'm going to keep it,

[05:54] but I do know this.

[05:55] If I flip a demon that's impossible to get,

[05:58] I will get way more than if I'm trying

[06:00] to flip pinball machines.

[06:03] For those of you out there, you know this.

[06:05] I mean the guys who collect cars

[06:07] and want the hottest car now will pay way more

[06:10] than the guys who collect pinball machines

[06:12] that want the hottest pinball machine.

[06:15] I also, you know, the other part too,

[06:17] when we talk about Star Wars Ellie

[06:19] and I really do think Ellie should be the crem de la crem.

[06:22] It should be the game that you look at

[06:24] and it has really special features

[06:26] and things that really separated from the premium.

[06:30] And I believe Stern brought more of an Ellie feel

[06:34] to Batman and an Ellie feel to Ghostbusters.

[06:39] I believe they brought more of an Ellie feel to Star Trek.

[06:42] I mean when you really compare how much Star Trek cost,

[06:46] what was it like $6,500 to what you're getting

[06:49] with Star Wars Ellie?

[06:51] It's no comparison, all the things they've taken

[06:54] out of the game.

[06:55] Take out the shaker motor, take out the lighted armor,

[06:59] take out the stainless steel speaker panel grill

[07:05] that was special on the Star Trek Ellie's,

[07:06] take out mirror back glasses, take out,

[07:09] you know you start to take out things

[07:10] like the lasers in the game.

[07:11] Like there was just, there's absolutely nothing

[07:14] with Star Wars Ellie to me that feels that special.

[07:18] And I think it's arguably not even the nicest

[07:22] art package in the game.

[07:24] And we all know that some pinball mod company

[07:27] is gonna make armored railings.

[07:29] And there's also 800 of them, right?

[07:31] There was the rush to get,

[07:33] and the thrill to land a Ghostbusters or a Batman

[07:37] because the numbers were far fewer.

[07:39] So I know there were also 800 Star Trek's

[07:42] and you could argue that Star Wars is even a bigger property,

[07:46] which it definitely is,

[07:47] and that these games will be spoken for.

[07:49] Now here's the thing, my issues with the game,

[07:52] and my main issue that I just don't see the value there,

[07:56] regardless of how well it shoots,

[07:58] I just don't look at Star Wars pinball

[08:00] and see a $9,000 game or an $8,400 game.

[08:05] It doesn't matter, right?

[08:06] Because they're all gonna sell out.

[08:08] I've already heard from most of my distributor friends

[08:10] that they're spoken for, they're all spoken for.

[08:13] There are, you guys will gobble them up.

[08:17] But I also don't feel this fear of missing out

[08:21] on getting an LE because I also feel fully confident

[08:25] that if one day down the road, I would like an LE,

[08:28] I think they're gonna be plenty available for sale.

[08:30] And I think if I've learned anything over the last

[08:34] couple of years in this hobby,

[08:35] is that everything will eventually be up for grabs.

[08:39] You might sometimes pay a little bit more

[08:41] than it was originally, you might pay less.

[08:44] Majority of the time you'll pay less.

[08:47] And I think with where these games are at now,

[08:50] with games costing $8,000, $9,000 for the LE's

[08:53] and the nice ones, the collectible ones,

[08:56] the prices are probably all gonna go down on them

[08:58] because I don't think there's a lot of room

[09:00] for things to climb.

[09:01] Speaking of just a little segue,

[09:04] did you see the $14,000?

[09:07] We talked about this, took the Batman Super Ali.

[09:09] So look, that goes to show that some of these high end,

[09:14] limited games will hold their value.

[09:16] Now there's only 80 of those versus 800

[09:19] of these Star Wars LEDs.

[09:21] So, and also Batman Super Ali,

[09:24] they really up what you got.

[09:27] I don't think you got $5,000 more

[09:29] than you got on an LED with Batman,

[09:31] but at least you got the beautiful

[09:33] and boss decals on the side.

[09:35] You got the pinstriped armor,

[09:37] you got the Bat Topper,

[09:39] with the Bat Signal and everything.

[09:41] So I'm out on Star Wars.

[09:44] I'm still in Undyledin, Collector's Edition,

[09:47] but I'm watching the reviews of Dyleden.

[09:49] They're really interesting.

[09:50] There's, I just read Crazy Lovely's review of the game

[09:54] and I thought it was really, really well-written

[09:56] and I agreed with a lot of what Levy said about the game.

[10:00] I think if you love Pat Waller games,

[10:02] you're really gonna enjoy Dyleden.

[10:05] The long ball times are something

[10:08] that really good players will struggle with Undyledin.

[10:11] I'm not even that good of a player,

[10:13] and I also like Levy had games

[10:15] that were easily coming up on a half hour

[10:20] because you do get so many extra balls.

[10:22] I think at every, at you get an extra ball

[10:24] whenever you get to,

[10:25] I wanna say a quarter million points.

[10:28] And on average, I think if you're decent,

[10:30] you're gonna have four or five balls per game

[10:34] when you're playing Dyleden.

[10:36] The one thing about Dyleden too,

[10:38] and it was reading Levy's review of it,

[10:41] I do think that starting a mode is pretty intuitive

[10:44] when you realize you just shoot the guy,

[10:46] he charges the phone, you shoot the phone.

[10:48] But from there, I still need to learn exactly what to do,

[10:55] what the overall objectives are

[10:57] in terms of gathering the SIM cards and whatnot.

[11:00] But what's interesting is Summers,

[11:01] we're gonna have a lot of people with Dyleden in their homes

[11:05] and we're gonna get a lot of home use only reviews of the game.

[11:10] And I think that's gonna be really telling,

[11:13] it's how does Dyleden,

[11:15] how does it stack up after you own it for a few months?

[11:18] Is it still exciting?

[11:20] Is it still got that one more game quality to it?

[11:25] And does it keep people coming back and back for more?

[11:28] And because that's the thing with a theme like Dyleden,

[11:32] is it's an original theme,

[11:34] so it's refreshing to have something new.

[11:37] But because we don't have the emotional attachment to it,

[11:40] the way you do it to Star Wars,

[11:41] will it still be fun months down the road?

[11:46] And we're gonna know because people are gonna have the game

[11:49] as we go into the summer.

[11:51] So I'm waiting to see what people,

[11:52] what their thoughts are because I don't think

[11:54] the collector's edition guys are gonna get hit up

[11:57] to pay for their machines until sometime in,

[12:02] I would say August, September.

[12:04] That's what it's looking like.

[12:05] But I still think a lot of the reviews of Dyleden

[12:09] have been super positive.

[12:11] So I hope to see more and more Dyleden's going out.

[12:16] And I talked to Jack and he basically told me,

[12:18] I can't keep up with the man.

[12:20] He said he's getting more people who want games now

[12:22] and they're going full steam ahead

[12:24] and they're making games, lots of games every week

[12:27] and games are going out.

[12:28] And so production is fully ramped up.

[12:31] So again, we're happy that Jack has got a game on his hand

[12:35] where people are not waiting years, right?

[12:37] Normally at this period, after Jack revealed the game,

[12:42] there's like a two year delay.

[12:44] These guys are, they've finally figured it out

[12:47] with a game that has a lot of excitement around it.

[12:49] So that's really cool.

[12:52] Attack from Mars Remake is also going out this summer.

[12:54] So happy that you guys are getting that game as well, right?

[12:58] All these games, like, you know, a lot of options,

[13:01] a lot of options were to spend your money.

[13:03] And that's another thing too.

[13:05] It's like, I just didn't know that Star Wars

[13:08] was going to have complete code or not.

[13:10] A lot of the rumors out there, you know,

[13:13] people all we can do is speculate.

[13:15] And so, you know, the last thing I want

[13:17] is to get a Star Wars and it's to be like Batman

[13:20] and you're just waiting for the code to be finished over a year.

[13:24] You might as well just wait for the game to be out for a while

[13:26] and then buy one when the code is complete.

[13:28] But I don't think Star Wars is going to suffer like Batman.

[13:31] I think Star Wars code is going to be pretty finished

[13:33] upon shipping.

[13:35] I think the issue are parts.

[13:38] I really do.

[13:39] I think it is a parts issue that's keeping that game

[13:41] from going out.

[13:42] What else?

[13:44] What else is it?

[13:45] You know, what else do I hope goes on when I'm away?

[13:49] I hope that I do hope that Dutch and highway pinball

[13:54] come out with some positive news.

[13:55] I don't think we're going to get much news

[13:57] from either one of those over the next couple of weeks.

[14:00] I still think there's going to be another three to four

[14:03] weeks before Dutch has a quote from the contract manufacturer.

[14:07] So we'll see if they can figure that whole boondog all out.

[14:12] Alien pinball is the one that all the reports I'm hearing

[14:15] from alien are positive.

[14:17] I've heard nothing but positive things

[14:20] from the people who have had conversations

[14:23] with the new investors.

[14:25] So I think alien will see the light of day.

[14:29] Now, here's my take, though.

[14:32] I've played the game a bunch of times.

[14:34] I think we might all have to reserve judgment

[14:37] until we play a game that these new guys make.

[14:40] Because I do feel the game Andrew made

[14:43] was at times clunky, had issues, never fully worked.

[14:48] There was always some issue with the game

[14:50] and all the shows I went to.

[14:52] So hopefully all those get ironed out.

[14:55] I heard a rumor, and this is a rumor,

[14:58] that highway pinball is considering

[15:00] switching to standard cabinet sizes

[15:04] and not this proprietary cabinet that they're currently using.

[15:08] I think that would be a really good move.

[15:11] I think they should look at all of the different things

[15:14] that Andrew sort of felt needed to be updated or changed

[15:19] and scrap a lot of the ideas that made production more

[15:22] difficult, that made the games stand out,

[15:26] I think, in a bad way when you put them

[15:29] in a lineup full of games.

[15:31] I really do.

[15:31] I still think the way there's a lack of artwork

[15:35] on the back box and the back box is really thin

[15:38] and there's not artwork covering the entire cabinet

[15:42] of the machine.

[15:43] I don't think it looks good.

[15:44] I don't think it looks good.

[15:45] And we know that people who buy themes like Alien,

[15:48] they want the whole thing to be covered, head to toe,

[15:51] and an awesome Alien artwork.

[15:54] It's going to be interesting to see

[15:56] what the Ellie Art Package is.

[15:59] Because as I said on a previous podcast,

[16:02] the Ellie artwork was never fully approved by Fox.

[16:05] So I hope that Brian Allen gets that approval.

[16:09] I hope that they work with Brian Allen moving forward.

[16:12] I think he's a really talented artist.

[16:15] And look, if they switch and decide

[16:17] it to put aliens into a different kind of cabinet,

[16:20] I think it would be awesome to have Brian Allen do the artwork

[16:25] for the cabinet as well.

[16:26] Do we even go as far to say is, well, hell,

[16:30] why not just like have them redo the play field artwork

[16:32] while we're at it and make the whole thing look incredible

[16:35] and start over with the art?

[16:37] Because they might have enough time to do that,

[16:41] but they might not.

[16:43] It's hard to know who to believe.

[16:44] It's hard to know how long it really did take Fox

[16:46] to approve artwork because as we now know,

[16:50] Andrew was making up stuff.

[16:55] And that's me politely saying he was kind of lying to us

[16:58] about how long it was taking him to approve.

[17:00] Those were now stall tactics.

[17:04] Someone let the comment on my podcast comment section

[17:09] on SoundCloud and basically said,

[17:12] like, do you have to kick a man when he's down?

[17:14] Can't you just let him retire?

[17:15] And that's not like, look, I mean,

[17:18] I don't think we're kicking Andrew highway when he's down.

[17:20] I think there's just a lot of stuff that has come to light

[17:23] since he's stepped down that I can now say more freely

[17:29] and with more confidence because now I know it's true.

[17:31] You do understand that I was holding back a lot of stuff

[17:35] I was told because I didn't want to report it

[17:39] unless the things came to fruition

[17:42] and the things that people told me would happen,

[17:44] did happen and it collapsed.

[17:47] So look, we hope these new investors can figure it out.

[17:51] They've got a lot of people who are patiently waiting

[17:56] and I think the first thing they need to do,

[17:57] and I don't know if I've read that this is happening yet,

[18:00] but refunds should be going out to people shortly

[18:04] if not already.

[18:05] And as I said to people, I just think it's a smart move

[18:08] to get a refund and then if they make the game

[18:10] and games are shipping, just go back in.

[18:12] And I think these guys understand that

[18:15] and I think they're gonna honor anyone who wants to get out.

[18:19] So that's going on at highway.

[18:22] What else is going on?

[18:22] Do you see like Kevin Coolick's house?

[18:24] It looks like it's underwater now.

[18:26] He lives near a lake and someone shared a picture with me.

[18:30] Kevin Coolick is, it looks like they're like

[18:32] in a canoe to get down the block.

[18:36] Flood damage is a terrible thing.

[18:38] I never wish anyone to have any sort of natural disaster

[18:42] hit them as much as Kevin's a scumbag.

[18:45] It's terrible to see people lose their homes.

[18:48] I bet there's some people saying this is sort of like

[18:50] karma's a bitch, but look at his whole neighborhood

[18:53] is affected.

[18:54] It's not just Kevin's house that was hit by lightning

[18:56] or something.

[18:57] That court case continues to drag on.

[19:02] I, Kevin's got no money.

[19:03] You guys are just gonna watch the beating of a dead horse here.

[19:08] It's gonna be entertaining at times.

[19:12] It's gonna be sad and pathetic at times

[19:14] to hear the audio tapes of Kevin and his family

[19:17] trying to spin and trying to make themselves into victims.

[19:22] I think for most of you guys on Predator,

[19:24] at some point you're gonna have to just concede the fact

[19:27] that you're not gonna get anything.

[19:29] Any assets this guy has are gone.

[19:31] They've been funneled to other vendors.

[19:34] The money trail is all over the place.

[19:36] It's a mess.

[19:37] He doesn't have any real assets to seize.

[19:40] What he does have now looks like it's underwater.

[19:43] He's under water both metaphorically and literally now.

[19:47] So lesson learned, right?

[19:49] Lesson learned about Predator Pimball.

[19:50] Have you guys learned the lesson about Predator Pimball?

[19:53] I think you have.

[19:53] I think most of you have learned that lesson.

[19:57] What's going on in spooky land?

[19:59] So as we get closer to August,

[20:02] it gets more and more exciting

[20:04] because that's when we're supposed to start to see

[20:06] Alex Cooper's nightmare castle.

[20:09] We've said it before.

[20:10] This game needs to be a hit for spooky.

[20:13] Terry at Pimball Life said he's played the white wood

[20:16] and that it's really impressed

[20:18] and that it's gonna raise spooky to the next level.

[20:21] So that's good news, right?

[20:22] That's exactly what needs to happen

[20:25] because if we look at the used market

[20:27] for spooky Pimball machines,

[20:30] it's indicative of I think people starting to realize

[20:35] that, you know, rarity is not everything.

[20:38] The game also has to play well for a game

[20:41] to maintain its value or go up a little bit.

[20:44] And with such rare games like Rob Zombie

[20:46] and America's Most Honored,

[20:48] you know, people who bought them

[20:49] are gonna have trouble selling them

[20:52] for what they paid for them.

[20:54] And that's, look, you might lose $1,000.

[20:57] You might lose a little bit more,

[21:00] but that's gonna start to happen across the board

[21:02] with these Pimball machines.

[21:04] So if you buy a dialed in for nine grand,

[21:07] how much do you think you're gonna sell it in a year?

[21:10] How much do you think that's gonna be worth?

[21:12] How much do you think a collector's edition dialed

[21:14] in will be worth in a year?

[21:16] You think it's gonna be worth $12,500?

[21:19] Do you think of Ellie with so many of them being made

[21:22] with brand new ones and box being nine grand?

[21:25] You know, people are gonna lose a grand, two grand per game now.

[21:29] That wasn't customary for a long time,

[21:32] but there's just so many games coming out

[21:33] that that's gonna be the common sort of occurrence.

[21:38] Well, it will create a little bit of a market stall

[21:40] where people will think twice

[21:42] if there's a lot of depreciation.

[21:45] I mean, talk depreciation.

[21:47] I just saw today too, they announced a wide body Hellcat.

[21:51] So now my Hellcat's gonna go down a value.

[21:53] And it's like, so you start to realize

[21:55] that all these things, whether they're cars,

[21:57] whether they're Pimball, you know, for the most part,

[22:00] most of them are not collectible.

[22:02] Most of them are not gonna give you

[22:06] the long-term return on your investment

[22:09] that you might be looking for.

[22:10] But overall, overall,

[22:13] Pimball still yields a great return on investment,

[22:17] a great return on investment.

[22:19] There is nothing else out there that is like a toy

[22:23] that if you buy it,

[22:25] you're getting your return on in your investment.

[22:27] Maybe if you were getting one of those like,

[22:28] NES classic systems and you went to go sell it,

[22:31] or you're gonna sell your Nintendo Switch app

[22:33] or having it for like a month,

[22:34] but for the most part, Pimball holds its value

[22:38] very nicely for people.

[22:39] So that's what's going on there.

[22:42] Look, Home Pin might be coming out with their game

[22:46] in the next month or so.

[22:48] That's another one entering the game.

[22:51] Who Dini's been pretty quiet recently,

[22:53] which leads me to believe they're getting the game ready,

[22:56] which is exciting.

[22:57] I mean, American Pimball is another option

[23:01] that we're going to have.

[23:05] What a total nuclear annihilation.

[23:08] I mean, there's just so much going on.

[23:11] There's so much going on.

[23:12] Look, and another reason, guys,

[23:13] why I'm not podcasting as much,

[23:15] and I try to say this stuff.

[23:16] And sometimes I'm like,

[23:17] you know, I'm always on the fence about how much I want to just

[23:20] tell you exactly what's on my mind,

[23:22] because I think some people,

[23:25] you know, I saw someone guys say that,

[23:26] where's podcast ever?

[23:27] And I'm like, well, what do you want me to do?

[23:28] You want me to just like, always fan the flames?

[23:31] You want me to always jump into the drama?

[23:33] Look, I'm here to tell you about what's going on in Pimball.

[23:38] And then I'm here to tell you about my observations of it.

[23:40] And then every once in a while,

[23:41] I want to get some good interviews on as well

[23:42] for you guys to learn about what's going on in the Pimball hobby,

[23:45] and we'll continue to do that.

[23:47] But I also think, as I said in my last podcast,

[23:50] that summer, it's just a slower time in the Pimball hobby.

[23:54] It just is.

[23:56] Right now, you know, I think there's,

[24:00] there's even less back and forth banter.

[24:03] There's less dialogue, there's less activity,

[24:06] because it's the summertime.

[24:09] People are going on vacation.

[24:10] People are spending money on vacation.

[24:12] So let's talk about like,

[24:14] when you have to figure out where to allocate your money,

[24:17] a lot of you out there have family and have kids,

[24:20] and you're spending money on vacations.

[24:22] And God, that's not cheap, right?

[24:24] In today's world.

[24:26] And you have to figure out where you want to allocate your funds.

[24:29] And right now, I mean, it couldn't be a worse time

[24:32] for all these games to be coming out.

[24:34] I'm doing a renovation in my apartment.

[24:37] I'm being told that Dodge Demon is available.

[24:40] By the way, I had to sign a contract today

[24:42] to buy the Dodge Demon.

[24:44] I had to get it notarized, which basically said,

[24:47] you can't drive the car on the highway

[24:49] with the drag radios, that the car could kill me,

[24:53] that I can't use the track mode launch.

[24:56] That, I mean, it's like, I signed a contract

[24:58] that basically said, this car can't really be used

[25:02] on the street, but the car also can't be used on the track

[25:05] because the fact that it's below a 10 second quarter mile car

[25:09] requires a roll cage in the car, which it doesn't have.

[25:13] So I'm like, what did I just do?

[25:16] But I know that I'm not worried

[25:18] because of the demand for that car.

[25:21] And I also like wanted to put a pause

[25:24] on just chasing new-in-box Pimball machine,

[25:26] because man, I was really getting tempted

[25:29] to look at that big Lebowski, that's for sale.

[25:31] Did you see that in Florida for $16,000?

[25:36] And on some level too, I just stepped back

[25:38] and I'm like, I paid 23 for Magic Girl,

[25:42] that this game is like 12,500 Star Wars is nine,

[25:46] $16,000 for a Lebowski if you want one now.

[25:51] I got a tells of the Rabie and Knights,

[25:53] just sort of waiting to be restored.

[25:57] I've got all these arcade games sitting at a friend's house.

[26:00] Like, you know, you just reach a point sometimes.

[26:04] I don't know about you guys, but you're just like,

[26:06] I don't want that much stuff.

[26:09] And I don't want to be on the hook to buy so many things.

[26:13] And I want to diversify where I allocate my money.

[26:18] And that's just like life, right?

[26:21] We're all sort of struggling that sometimes

[26:23] when we collect pinball machines

[26:24] and we're chasing after pinball.

[26:26] You know, and I also just, I looked at the Rabie,

[26:29] I looked at pinside with a different set of eyes

[26:33] over, you know, recently.

[26:34] And it's just like, you know, you don't engage

[26:36] like the 20 guys arguing with each other all day long.

[26:40] And you know, and all of a sudden, it doesn't even,

[26:43] it's funny because it doesn't, it's not as entertaining.

[26:48] And then you obviously, you don't feel the desire

[26:50] anymore to do things that get these people going

[26:54] or impress these people.

[26:56] You just want pinball to be fun.

[26:58] And you want to play pinball in the most fun, possible way.

[27:03] And that's my new approach.

[27:04] And it's, and for me in New York City,

[27:06] it's like, I've access to all these incredible games.

[27:09] And I'm, again, I'm really struggling

[27:11] with like the need to own because I can walk

[27:14] and go play dialed in in 15 minutes.

[27:16] And I know that Star Wars Ellie, I know that game's

[27:19] going to be at Sunshine.

[27:21] I know that Star Wars Ellie would probably be at Pioneers

[27:23] or another bar like that.

[27:25] And I can get all the kicks in the world I want out

[27:28] of these games.

[27:29] You know, if Sternor was smart, they would never put

[27:31] headphone jacks into their machines because headphone jacks

[27:35] equal, you know, the full immersion out on location.

[27:40] And you wouldn't, you would lose home use only buyers.

[27:43] I swear to God, I feel like a headphone jack

[27:46] is the worst thing to try and,

[27:49] because people just want to buy it, you know,

[27:51] won't want to buy it, because they can get the same experience

[27:54] out in the wild.

[27:57] What else is going on?

[27:58] What else is going on in Pimball?

[28:01] I think that's it.

[28:02] I really do.

[28:03] I don't know why I'm still waiting to let you guys hear

[28:09] the interview with Jared.

[28:11] And you know, and you know,

[28:13] Pioneers just like, all right, like it was a great interview.

[28:17] There was nothing in it that I think people over at Sternor

[28:21] just really busy getting Star Wars out.

[28:23] And I get it.

[28:23] Like there has to be an executive at Stern who has to listen

[28:26] to me and Jared talk for an hour and a half.

[28:29] That's not a, that's not a simple asset to approve.

[28:34] But it'll come one day.

[28:37] It'll come one day.

[28:38] I don't know when.

[28:39] So we'll see when that happens.

[28:42] And we're gonna have more great interviews lined up.

[28:45] Here's what I'm gonna do for you guys.

[28:46] When I go away, because like you probably can tell,

[28:50] like I'm a little fatigued,

[28:51] like these podcasts are becoming a little redundant.

[28:54] And they are.

[28:55] I fully admit, right?

[28:57] These last few ones might be a little bit like M&M's

[29:00] like questionable albums.

[29:03] But when I go away, I am going to do you a favor.

[29:06] I am going to line up more great interviews.

[29:09] We're gonna come back with some renewed vigor and energy,

[29:14] and we're gonna hopefully have more news to discuss.

[29:18] I hope within two weeks for all of your sakes

[29:21] that there is Star Wars, Ellie and Premium Gameplay footage

[29:28] so that you can finally know what we're getting

[29:33] with the most anticipated title in the history of Stern.

[29:35] So we can stop speculating, right, on it.

[29:38] All right, so I'm going to Canada.

[29:41] I'm going to Vegas.

[29:44] I am not bringing my computer with me to do these podcasts.

[29:48] All right, if you wanna send me emails,

[29:50] if you have show topic ideas, if you want me to talk

[29:52] to someone, if you have a collector friend,

[29:54] who's got nothing but heps, whatever it is,

[29:57] just shoot me an email at canadaepimbaladgmail.com.

[30:01] I look forward to coming back to you guys

[30:03] in a couple weeks.

[30:04] I hope you don't leave my podcast shores

[30:07] because of this break.

[30:09] I'm fairly confident you won't,

[30:11] because I know that the rest of the podcast out there

[30:14] are gonna talk to you about like local tournaments

[30:17] and review old games and they're gonna do what they do.

[30:20] They're gonna just send you back to me

[30:22] because you're gonna realize,

[30:23] even though these last couple podcasts haven't been great,

[30:26] you're gonna realize that this is still

[30:29] the most entertaining pinball podcast.

[30:30] I can say that.

[30:31] I can have a little bit of an ego.

[30:33] I can, I'm allowed to, because I know that we get right

[30:37] to it every episode.

[30:38] All right, have a good one guys.

[30:40] If you're traveling, be safe, play pinball, shoot me an email,

[30:44] and I'll be back in a couple weeks.

[30:45] Have a good night.

[30:47] Let's go.

[30:48] Let's go.
