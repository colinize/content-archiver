[00:00] We got a little wind of our own, I'll tell you things no one else knows, I'll let you in when no one else goes.

[00:07] Whatever I do without you, I've been looking for, I've always been here outside of my door,

[00:14] And all of the time I'm looking for something new.

[00:17] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:21] Good morning Vietnam!

[00:24] Now welcome to Canada Spinball Podcast coming at you from Dublin, Ireland.

[00:28] I'll be back in New York this week and I will go to Jack Bar and I will play Toy Story and I'm gonna

[00:33] have fun and maybe I'll do it for my Saturday morning spectacular and then I'm not gonna buy the machine.

[00:38] I don't care because I love Toy Story 1 through 3.

[00:41] We're gonna talk a little bit about that but I want to start this show before I go around the pinball horn

[00:45] and talk about everything happening in the pinball world.

[00:48] I want to talk about price again real quickly because I've been hearing from some of you and you've been saying to me,

[00:53] Chris, look, I know that L.E.s and C.E.s of highly sought after games have gone crazy in the past couple years.

[01:01] But the real volume in pinball is not those titles.

[01:05] The real volume in pinball are the pros and premium machines.

[01:10] And if you look at that market, I'm hearing from more and more people and more and more distributors

[01:15] that the premium market is really slowing down.

[01:19] Especially the new in-box premium and pro market.

[01:23] And I think right now if you look at the prices, a $9,000 premium is really expensive.

[01:31] And also if you look at Jersey Jack L.E. which is ostensibly their premium,

[01:36] $12,000 for a Toy Story L.E. aka premium.

[01:43] Here's what I'm hearing from people is that this market is slowing down.

[01:48] And distributors are no longer going to be able to move these products at these prices super quickly.

[01:55] What would happen to the pinball marketplace if all of a sudden we've got distributors sitting on like

[02:01] hundreds of thousands of dollars of merchandise and it's a lot harder to find people to buy these games?

[02:08] Because remember, it used to be like a premium was like $7,500.

[02:13] I think premiums used to be like $7,000.

[02:15] Now they're $9,000 and it's a lot of money.

[02:18] And $12,000 for a Toy Story L.E. is crazy amounts of money.

[02:24] And I think everyone said the market was crazy and these companies would be able to price their machines higher

[02:30] and almost remove people's ability to make money on the flip.

[02:34] Now the flip only happens with the L.E.s of Stearns and the C.E.s of Jersey Jack Pinball Machines.

[02:40] But if you've been following Toy Story pricing right now,

[02:42] there's no money to be made on a collector's edition flip right now.

[02:46] People are starting to list their C.E.s for basically MSRP.

[02:50] Now here's where it's going to get really interesting is that these collector's editions

[02:54] are not even being made until sometime in the fall.

[02:58] So we're a good like three months away before any of them will be made.

[03:03] And in that time period, a lot of people are going to be buying L.E.s and getting L.E.s out the door.

[03:08] And then what happens?

[03:10] This is the scary part I think for people thinking they're going to make money on the C.E.

[03:13] What happens when you make so many L.E.s at 12K and they slide down in price to like 10K or 11K?

[03:21] Let's just say they make enough and if you want to buy one used, it's going to be like $10,000.

[03:27] It's really, really hard to justify spending 15K on a brand new C.E.

[03:34] If you can get a used L.E. for $10,000.

[03:39] That's a 50% increase in price for what?

[03:42] For different colored armor and a topper for $5,000 more?

[03:48] And for just $1,000 more, you can go get a Stern Pro basically.

[03:53] And this is where it's at now.

[03:54] Do I get two Stern Pros or one Jersey Jack L.E.?

[03:58] Do I get almost three Stern Pros or one Jersey Jack C.E.?

[04:03] But it's not even about those now.

[04:05] Now it comes down to this.

[04:07] Do we think Stern Pinball will be able to sell high volumes of premiums at $9,000?

[04:15] Do we think that will happen?

[04:16] Do we think Jersey Jack can sell high volumes of games at $12,000 for the L.E.?

[04:22] And if the premium market goes soft, right?

[04:25] If people stop running at these games because there's so much money, what's going to happen?

[04:30] I think it's going to slow down the entire hobby.

[04:33] And I think people are right when they say, Chris,

[04:35] you need to stop focusing on the high, high end stuff.

[04:38] It's the stuff in the middle and the entry level stuff.

[04:41] If sales start to slow down there, you're really going to see dealers and distributors

[04:46] in big trouble sitting on a ton of inventory.

[04:50] Because the other thing is this, when Stern Pinball releases an L.E. machine,

[04:54] and I think Jersey Jack might do this a little bit with the C.E.'s,

[04:57] but we know Stern does this.

[04:58] They actually require their dealers and distributors

[05:02] to commit to buying a certain number of premiums and pros

[05:06] in order to get their allotments for the limited editions.

[05:10] And so you might have to buy 10 premiums to get one L.E.

[05:13] And maybe it's not that bad of a ratio, but you see what I'm saying is,

[05:17] I know from a lot of dealers, they have so much money committed in games.

[05:22] And stuff like Rush Premium is not selling at $9,000.

[05:27] Stuff like the Mandalorian Premium is not selling at $9,000.

[05:31] The games are sitting.

[05:33] I hate to use a car argument, but in the car world,

[05:36] when you have last year's model, it goes on sale usually.

[05:40] Now, I know the car industry is like over sticker right now,

[05:43] and Pinball has been well over sticker for a while.

[05:46] But if these prices keep getting this high,

[05:48] I really think you're going to see dealers having to sort of finagle the price a little bit

[05:53] to find a home for these games at $9,000 and $12,000.

[05:57] It's really hard, I think, for a lot of people who have been in this hobby for a while

[06:02] to simply accept the fact that now all of a sudden,

[06:05] in L.E. of Jersey Jack Pinball is priced what a C.E. used to be.

[06:09] And I've said it, the Trojan horse in all of Pinball pricing

[06:12] is, Stern Pinball is now pricing a premium in which there is no limit to how many they will make.

[06:19] They are pricing a premium at what an L.E. used to be.

[06:23] And I think that's going to be a hard pill to swallow.

[06:26] And if the looming recession and people start looking at their Pinball collections

[06:30] and how much money they have tied up in it,

[06:33] I do think we're going to see a real slowdown of running at new and box purchases.

[06:39] Time will tell, though.

[06:40] No one has a crystal ball.

[06:41] No one knows how things are going to go.

[06:42] But I do know this.

[06:43] These prices are too high.

[06:45] I just don't think you can sustain this market at these prices for very long.

[06:49] And as I said, the silver lining in all of this,

[06:52] as all of these prices get really high,

[06:55] all of these manufacturers have dug a ditch.

[06:57] They've dug a ditch.

[06:58] And the only way for them to get out of it is to give us great games.

[07:03] See, I love the next six months to a year in Pinball,

[07:06] because I love looking at this thing and saying,

[07:08] okay, Jersey Jack, you're going to release another game this year.

[07:11] This game better be epic if you want to sell it at 15K for the CEs and 12,000 for the L.E.s.

[07:18] Like it's got to be amazing.

[07:19] Same thing with Stern Pinball.

[07:21] At these prices, everyone's expecting the next Godzilla.

[07:25] They don't want a game that's just mediocre or middle of the road.

[07:28] And if a company comes out with something that's just mediocre at these prices,

[07:33] who's going to buy it?

[07:35] Because the days are over of just jumping in and only losing a few hundred bucks.

[07:39] And we're seeing it now across the entire hobby.

[07:42] If the game is mediocre, you're going to jump in and lose like two to $3,000.

[07:47] And I don't know anyone out there who's used to losing that much money.

[07:51] And I think everyone out there is saying, well, then I'll just buy a game that I know I love.

[07:55] And that's how it always should have been.

[07:58] But it was much easier to speculate in the past.

[08:00] It's not that easy anymore.

[08:02] And I think a lot of people, I mean it,

[08:04] a lot of people are going to get burned with their Toy Story CE non-refundable deposits of $2,500.

[08:12] I think when they make a thousand of these games,

[08:15] you're going to see a lot of people, and I'm going to say this,

[08:18] I think you're going to see a few hundred go up for sale for less than $15,000,

[08:24] where people are willing to lose maybe 500 bucks on their deposit

[08:27] or $1,000 on their deposit because they're not going to want to cut a check for $12,500.

[08:33] They're not going to want to go in on $15,000 on a game they don't really, really want.

[08:39] And the easiest way to remember why people don't really, really want this game, it's so simple.

[08:44] And everyone keeps trying to act like it's because it's this, it's that.

[08:47] No, it's very simply this.

[08:49] If you're a Toy Story fanatic, this isn't the game you want it.

[08:54] If you're a Rush fanatic, you're happy.

[08:57] If you're a Godzilla fanatic, you're happy.

[09:00] If you're a Guns N' Roses fanatic, you're happy.

[09:02] If you're a Lord of the Rings fanatic, you're happy.

[09:04] You know, you go down a list of all of the greatest theme integrated games,

[09:09] and everyone who loves that theme needs to love the pin.

[09:12] And there's no way around it.

[09:14] You can't spin it.

[09:15] You can't tell me I need to just see the way the game shoots.

[09:18] I love Toy Story and I don't want four.

[09:20] 

[09:20] All right.

[09:21] Let's go down the horn and talk about what's going on in Pinball.

[09:23] There's absolutely no updates over at Stern Pinball.

[09:25] We will wait a few months until we see the next Stern game.

[09:28] Over at Spooky Pinball, there is a code update for Ultraman.

[09:32] They have fixed or adjusted the interface on that game,

[09:36] I think to use more of the screen to make the stuff more easy to read.

[09:40] And I think to show the clips a little bit larger on the LCD screen,

[09:44] so that's good news.

[09:45] I was in the thread today.

[09:46] I saw some people were still having some issues reading some of the fonts

[09:50] and some of the scores on the game.

[09:52] I will say on some of these modern games, it's not just this one.

[09:56] They really make the scores too small to read.

[09:59] And you have to have like eagle eyesight to see what's going on on the screen.

[10:04] And these LCD screens on most of these games, they're not that big.

[10:08] So if you want people to be able to read what's going on,

[10:11] you also have to make sure there's great contrast between the font and the background color.

[10:16] And I think people were saying that about the new Spooky interface.

[10:19] It's sort of like a gray background with a dark gray font.

[10:23] But man, just make the font black.

[10:25] Make it easier for people to read.

[10:27] But if you have an Ultraman, make sure you get the new code into your game today.

[10:31] Now they are quickly moving on to the bloodsucker editions of these games.

[10:36] I think Spooky is going to be done with their manufacturing of these games by the fall.

[10:41] I think they want to be done by the fall.

[10:43] And I think they want to move on to their next stuff come Expo and TPF.

[10:48] If I was a betting man, I think they'll announce around Expo the next run of TNAs.

[10:53] And I think they're going to save Scooby-Doo for some time around Texas Pinball Festival.

[10:58] So that's just my guess is we're going to see more TNAs by the end of the year.

[11:02] And then we see Scooby-Doo.

[11:04] All right, Spooky Pinball, new code.

[11:06] Haggis Pinball is next.

[11:07] So as I said on my last podcast, Haggis Pinball still struggling to get games out.

[11:12] I have some friends of mine who are series ticket holders and then some friends who are regular

[11:17] orderers of this game.

[11:18] Is that a word?

[11:19] Orderers of this game?

[11:21] I have people who have a regular order in and they've shared with me some of their correspondence

[11:26] with Haggis Pinball.

[11:27] They emailed Damian.

[11:28] It takes them a few days to get an email back.

[11:31] There's no timeline.

[11:32] Like he is not telling people when they can really expect their games.

[11:36] We don't know how many they're making a week, but what I know is this, he's waiting on parts.

[11:41] And this is always the challenge is when you're waiting on parts, you really don't know what

[11:46] to say because you don't really know exactly when you're going to get the parts in.

[11:51] Now, I always go back to what Ben Heck told me.

[11:53] He always said, like, you need to have all the parts in house before you start production.

[11:57] So then how do they even make any games if they don't have all of the parts in house?

[12:01] That's the part I don't get.

[12:02] Are they working with like a few prototype parts?

[12:05] But if you're making 250 fathom mermaid editions, wouldn't you only start production

[12:12] when you had parts for all 250?

[12:14] And so I think everyone's realizing now that Canada wasn't unkind.

[12:18] Canada wasn't the bad guy.

[12:20] That video they put up two months ago saying production began where Marty was putting his

[12:25] Marty approved sticker on the game.

[12:27] That was a manufactured stage production video.

[12:30] It was totally manufactured and totally staged.

[12:33] The last point I'll make about this whole thing is it's been a year now.

[12:36] Like Damian promised production one year ago in July.

[12:40] And here we are a year later and how many fathoms have even been built.

[12:44] Nobody knows.

[12:45] And I don't like that lack of transparency.

[12:48] And I'll say this, if you're at the end of this queue and you were told a year ago that

[12:54] production would begin in July of 2021, you deserve a refund.

[12:59] I'm just going to say it.

[13:00] Like how is it that people don't have any right to ask for their money back?

[13:05] Everything he said he was going to do, every time frame he gave, he absolutely blew by it.

[13:11] And at what point can you say, hey, I just want my money back and you should get your

[13:15] money back because he didn't hold up his end of the deal.

[13:18] Why do you then have to have your money frozen there forever?

[13:22] And I still think these 250 games are not going to be made by the end of the year.

[13:27] There's no way they're going to be made by the end of the year.

[13:29] Not at this pace.

[13:30] And I really am praying for you, series ticket holders, because you bought the next like four

[13:34] or five games from this company.

[13:36] Oh, you can't be negative.

[13:37] You got to cheerlead everything or they're going to come at you next the way American

[13:40] Pinball came at you this past week.

[13:42] All right, let's talk about American Pinball real quick.

[13:44] So there's no real update.

[13:45] I mean, they're still making the legends of the Hala games.

[13:48] That's great.

[13:49] We all know they were making up that they got a ton of orders for the standard edition.

[13:54] It's fine.

[13:54] David Ficks can create his own sort of revisionist history about the orders around this game.

[13:59] But the thing is this, there's not really going to be American Pinball news until the fall.

[14:05] And my advice to them is just be quiet, get it done, release a great game in the fall.

[14:11] And I'm as excited as everyone else is to see what this game is.

[14:16] Now we're hearing that it's not a sequel to Dennis Norman's older titles.

[14:20] Now I heard from someone who used to work at American Pinball,

[14:23] who doesn't work there anymore.

[14:25] And he said to me, Chris, this game was originally going to be a sequel to a Dennis

[14:30] Nordman game.

[14:31] So they might have reskinned it into something else.

[14:34] So I don't know what it is, but that is the word on the street,

[14:38] that it is not a follow up now to whitewater.

[14:41] So we shall see what the game is, but we still have a few months to go.

[14:46] And there is no point in doing podcasts.

[14:49] There's no point in attacking Canada.

[14:51] There's no point in taking a victory lap yet.

[14:54] They still have yet to make a hit game.

[14:58] And I was just on pin side and someone says, American Pinball is so great.

[15:01] They pick up the phone and they stay late to help me figure out problems.

[15:05] Why do you think that is?

[15:07] Because they are not that busy people.

[15:10] And I hope they create a game that is a smash hit, but they have not done it yet.

[15:15] And we heard from Joe Balser when this company was started,

[15:19] they considered the finish line to be a thousand games made.

[15:24] And I don't think they've made a thousand of any of their titles.

[15:28] If they have, guess what?

[15:29] Then tell us you have, then take your victory lap until then put your heads down

[15:35] and make a great game and then do your victory lap.

[15:38] Now we're also hearing that at the coin taker tailgating party,

[15:42] the super awesome pinball shows doing a tailgating party,

[15:45] I think it's September 24th, I want to say on that Saturday.

[15:49] I hope I get a chance to go down this year.

[15:50] Last year it got canceled.

[15:52] They're going to do a little teaser of what the next American pinball game is.

[15:55] So that will be exciting.

[15:57] And then it leads us to believe that Expo will be the moment in which they pull the curtain off the machine,

[16:03] which makes total sense because David Fix is one of the organizers of pinball Expo.

[16:08] So that's good news.

[16:09] The only thing I hope they figure out is production.

[16:12] What I hope they don't do, I hope they have enough staff and parts

[16:16] to make a lot of these games quickly.

[16:18] Because that's the name of the game now.

[16:19] Like nobody wants to wait six to eight months.

[16:22] And I hope they don't start making more Houdini's October Fest and Hot Wheels.

[16:26] And then they have to juggle four lines at one time.

[16:29] Because if the Dennis Nordman game is great,

[16:32] it's going to be the game everybody wants.

[16:34] They're not going to want the older stuff,

[16:36] especially since you can go on pinside today and save yourself at least a thousand dollars on all of their older titles.

[16:46] You can go get everything for cheaper than new in box.

[16:50] So why would you go order a new in box version of the game?

[16:53] I don't get it.

[16:54] I don't get where these orders are coming from unless David Fix is ordering

[16:58] a thousand standard editions of Legends of Ahala himself.

[17:01] But I do know that I poked the bear.

[17:03] Man, I poked the bear.

[17:04] Like when you poke AP, you get like podcasts coming at you.

[17:07] You get Naps Arcade coming after you.

[17:09] You get everyone colluding saying,

[17:11] Canada's Yellow Journalism.

[17:13] And I still fail to realize where I was really wrong.

[17:17] Like what was debunked?

[17:18] All right.

[17:19] So Dennis Norman's game is not Whitewood or two.

[17:21] That was just a rumor.

[17:22] Was I wrong on the reason why Josh Coogler left?

[17:25] Was I wrong on the fact that Joe Balser was working on a game that was licensed?

[17:29] Was I wrong on that?

[17:30] Was I wrong that they only had the ability to build 100 Legends of Ahala when they revealed the game?

[17:34] I don't know.

[17:35] I didn't hear any specific debunking of most of what I said.

[17:38] It's just the broad like, K-man's wrong again.

[17:41] K-man's the Twippy winner.

[17:43] I get it.

[17:43] I get it guys.

[17:44] But I'll say this.

[17:45] The only way you can be wrong is if you actually try to deliver the news and no one else tries to like give you scoops on anything.

[17:53] They don't.

[17:53] They don't try to give you scoops on anything.

[17:55] It's only when I say something that they think is wrong.

[17:58] They're like, see, let's swoop in and say how wrong the K-man is.

[18:02] All right.

[18:02] Let's talk about Chicago Gaming Company.

[18:03] I still don't understand what's happening over there.

[18:06] Apparently, and I keep seeing more and more people talk about this.

[18:09] Apparently the legs they're shipping with these machines are causing the decals to wrinkle on the cabinet.

[18:16] Talk about a nightmare thing for people to have to replace.

[18:20] Think about how annoying it is.

[18:22] If you buy this game and you have to replace the decals on your cabinet, how many of you out there?

[18:28] Raise of hands.

[18:29] How many of you out there would actually want to have to do that?

[18:33] To replace the decals on your game.

[18:35] This is a really weird quality control issue that is unlike what we've seen from Chicago Gaming Company in the past.

[18:43] This company has always made high quality, well built machines.

[18:48] And it's really concerning that this was not caught at the factory level.

[18:52] So hopefully they figure this out before they make the LE versions of the game.

[18:56] Who knows when the LE versions of the games are actually shipping.

[19:00] I think all the momentum and all the excitement around this game is sort of gone at this standpoint.

[19:05] It's just they've made people wait too long.

[19:08] Now the one way I think they can really get the excitement back is when the LE game is ready to ship.

[19:13] Because remember, it's been 10 months since they announced the LE.

[19:17] 10.

[19:17] So when the LE game is ready to ship, I think they need to have the Lyman sheets,

[19:21] the final code update for this game ready to go.

[19:25] And shouldn't it be ready to go?

[19:27] Right?

[19:27] It's been a 10 month delay.

[19:29] So how much more time do you need to get the code ready?

[19:32] And that's what everybody wants to see.

[19:35] This is the last code package that Lyman sheets worked on.

[19:40] Arguably the greatest pinball coder of all time.

[19:43] Now the other question is how much are they going to charge to install that code into your game?

[19:49] How much would you pay right now?

[19:51] Now all things considered, Cactus Canyon LE was only what like $9,200.

[19:57] Like it was a bargain.

[19:58] Think about it like this.

[19:59] This game being almost $3,000 less than Toy Story LE is such a bargain.

[20:07] It is almost criminal that Toy Story CE, are you waiting for this?

[20:12] Is $6,000 more than Cactus Canyon LE?

[20:17] Almost $6,000 more.

[20:19] So this is still one of the greatest bangs for the buck in all of pinball.

[20:24] It's got way more toys in it.

[20:26] It's got way more fun stuff going on in the game.

[20:30] It's a fun game to shoot.

[20:31] It's a little easy like Toy Story.

[20:33] I will say I think for a lot of you out there, I hope you play Cactus Canyon because it's pretty easy game.

[20:38] It's not that hard of a game.

[20:40] So how much though would the code be?

[20:42] Would you spend $250 on a code update?

[20:45] $500? $1,000?

[20:47] We shall see what they price it at.

[20:50] But I do know this.

[20:50] Chicago Gaming Company doesn't want to rip people off.

[20:54] They are not a greedy company.

[20:56] So I do think they're going to pass on this code update.

[21:00] If I were to guess, I would put it somewhere between $350 and $500 as the maximum they'll charge you

[21:07] to install the final code of the game.

[21:09] All right.

[21:09] So no real news from Dutch Pinball or Pinball Brothers except the following.

[21:14] I think this Wednesday, July 13th, we saw this from Mr. Pinball Australia.

[21:20] We are going to get a new game reveal and it is not going to be Spinal Tap.

[21:25] So that means it's got to be.

[21:28] It has to be.

[21:29] It's going to be Queen Pinball from the Pinball Brothers.

[21:33] Now I know that they were trying to get this game released in June,

[21:37] but now it's going to be a July release and reveal.

[21:41] So the next game from the Pinball Brothers, I think we're going to see it this Wednesday,

[21:46] July 13th, and it's going to be Queen.

[21:48] So we shall see.

[21:50] Now, if it's the game that we saw in that Queen pop-up store, I'm a little bit worried.

[21:55] It looks outdated.

[21:56] It doesn't look like it's at the same caliber of a Stern music pin or a Jersey Jack music pin.

[22:03] So it's 2022, right?

[22:05] Pinflation is crazy.

[22:06] And so many companies are asking for all of this money and you're really going to need to love a pin

[22:13] to buy a pin.

[22:14] And Queen as an act is a great act.

[22:16] Like Queen is more popular than Rush, but I don't think this game is going to be anywhere near as good as Rush.

[22:23] I don't want to say this game is going to be dead on arrival until I see it.

[22:26] And I don't think anything with the name Queen is going to be dead on arrival.

[22:30] But I also think there's not a lot of confidence.

[22:33] I mean, they still need to make all those alien games.

[22:36] And if this game gets revealed, how long is it going to take to get it?

[22:41] This is the thing with Boutique Pinball.

[22:43] The days of being excited about putting money down and then waiting forever are over.

[22:48] No one's, no one really wants to do it anymore.

[22:51] I think that ship has sailed.

[22:52] I wish I had an update on Weird Owls going out, but I don't.

[22:57] Maybe I'm wrong.

[22:58] Jerry, are you out there?

[22:59] Can you hear us?

[23:00] Good morning, Jerry Stelenberg.

[23:02] Where the hell are the Weird Owl games?

[23:05] Something must be up over there.

[23:06] Jerry, why is it taking so long?

[23:09] Even if you're just making the kits, like the modular back of the game,

[23:13] why is it taking so long to make just that?

[23:17] Like I get it's harder to get cabinets and do all the other stuff,

[23:20] but this game should be in the hands of everyone who already owns a multi-morphic P3 system.

[23:27] But it's not like it's still taking forever.

[23:30] And your guess is as good as mine on why it's taking so long.

[23:34] All right.

[23:34] Is anything else going on over at Pinball?

[23:36] A deep root now.

[23:37] We're not going to talk about deep root.

[23:39] Did you guys see that what great witch John, the guy who's looking for a $100,000 whale investor

[23:46] to make a one-off pinball machine based on a licensed theme?

[23:50] And he thinks if he gets a $100,000, he'll be able to put together one working prototype.

[23:57] He hasn't even shared with anyone where that $100,000 will be allocated.

[24:03] I don't understand.

[24:04] This guy's obviously very passionate about pinball.

[24:07] I know that he fell on some hard times financially.

[24:10] I think he was making playfields and he got them all done for people.

[24:13] But you can't make a pinball machine the way he wants to do it for $100,000.

[24:20] Now he says he's working with an older designer.

[24:22] Here's who I think he's working with.

[24:24] I think he's working with John Norris.

[24:26] I know John Norris who joined deep root is really looking to get back into the pinball designing game.

[24:31] But no one's going to do this.

[24:33] Like no one's going to go fund me a one-off one game.

[24:36] You're not going to get someone to give you a $100,000.

[24:40] The richest people out there, and I know some very rich people in this hobby,

[24:45] they're rich for a reason.

[24:47] They're rich because they're smart with their money.

[24:50] And this would be the easiest way to lose $100,000.

[24:54] Imagineable.

[24:55] And even the way he's asking for this money, it's almost like he feels like these people won't even care.

[25:00] It's like so disrespectful to say I'm looking for a whale to give me $100,000 to pursue

[25:06] my dream.

[25:07] You know what happened in the world?

[25:08] You know, just in general, let me just talk a little bit about,

[25:11] if you want to make something, go make it.

[25:13] If you need to raise money to make something, go raise the money.

[25:17] But do the hard work.

[25:18] Don't just ask for someone to give you a check.

[25:21] Like this like socialistic approach to making pinball machines has never worked.

[25:26] Look at what Bobby Mueller did.

[25:27] Look at what Andrew Highway did.

[25:29] You could spend millions of dollars and not get a game off the ground.

[25:33] $100,000 is peanuts.

[25:35] It won't get you anywhere.

[25:37] You can't afford a coder, an artist, a designer.

[25:40] You can't afford to order the parts.

[25:43] I don't think people realize how expensive it is to do one-off, custom-made parts for a pinball machine.

[25:49] You need to have a CNC machine.

[25:50] You need to do all this stuff.

[25:52] You know how hard it is to mold plastics and make ramps and do all this stuff with just $100,000?

[25:58] And so it's a little bit of a silly offer, you know, that thread is going.

[26:01] Nobody really takes it that seriously, but it is what it is.

[26:05] You know, every time people are like, well, what is there to talk about in pinball?

[26:08] Something a name like that pops up on pin side.

[26:11] You know, and the last point I'll make is this.

[26:13] We don't need another pinball company.

[26:16] We don't need another startup.

[26:17] We don't need another boutique at all.

[26:20] We've got like eight or nine companies right now making pinball machines.

[26:24] And on top of that, there are hundreds of thousands of pinball machines that are great.

[26:30] Hundreds of thousands of them in the world out there,

[26:34] both in the wild and in people's homes.

[26:37] We don't need more.

[26:39] Like we just don't.

[26:40] And you're going to see the amount of used games that are going to be on the market for now until forever.

[26:47] This hobby is over saturated.

[26:50] Everybody knows it.

[26:52] Everybody knows it.

[26:52] Everybody can feel it.

[26:54] There's just so many games out there.

[26:56] There's so many games looking for a home.

[26:58] And if you want to buy a pinball machine,

[27:01] you don't need to fall into the FOMO around the LES and the CES.

[27:06] You can go get a great pinball machine, have fun, and you have a pinball machine in your home.

[27:12] You know, you don't need five in your home.

[27:15] You don't need 10.

[27:16] You don't need 30.

[27:17] Yes, some of you might have that.

[27:19] And some of you might be able to afford that.

[27:21] And that's great.

[27:22] But ultimately, we all know that you can only play one machine at a time.

[27:26] Like you could just have an Iron Man vault edition and have fun.

[27:30] Right? You wake up.

[27:32] How many hours a week can you actually play the damn thing?

[27:35] You wake up.

[27:35] You jump on your Iron Man vault edition.

[27:38] You have fun.

[27:39] It's got some fun mechs in it.

[27:40] It shoots amazingly well.

[27:42] It's got great flow.

[27:43] It's fast.

[27:44] It's fun.

[27:44] It's a theme that everybody knows.

[27:46] And then you use the rest of your money to live a balanced life.

[27:50] You know, the more and more I think about like the amount of games

[27:53] and how much money they want and how silly it all is,

[27:57] I really do think everyone's going to start to really slow down,

[28:02] reevaluate this whole thing and make sure I'm only paying these high prices for masterpieces.

[28:08] If I just want a game that's fun, I can go get a fun game for like four or five grand.

[28:14] It's still fun pinball.

[28:16] There is no reason you need to spend 12 or $15,000 to have pinball fun.

[28:21] And everybody knows it.

[28:22] And here's the other part too.

[28:24] 99% of your friends don't have pinball machines in their homes.

[28:28] 99% of them.

[28:29] So when they come over your house, even if you just have one pinball machine,

[28:34] they will be like, cool, you've got a pinball machine and you'll have some fun,

[28:38] drink some beers and that's it.

[28:40] You know what I'm saying?

[28:41] It's like sometimes I think we forget like how to put all of this in perspective

[28:46] and it gets a little bit out of hand because you spend too much time on pin side.

[28:50] You spend too much time staring at pinball that you think having it

[28:53] that we start to overemphasize the importance of having so many of them.

[28:57] And again, I'm all about like zen and simplicity.

[29:00] Like if I have a couple of good machines in my house and a healthy family and I travel a lot

[29:06] and I have enough money to go out and eat when I want to go out and eat and I just have peace of

[29:10] mind, I can tell you right now, the guy who has the most peace of mind in pinball has like one

[29:15] machine.

[29:16] He uses it whenever he has free time and that's it.

[29:19] His mission is to set the high score on his one machine.

[29:23] The people who don't have peace of mind are the ones chasing every single new in box game

[29:27] and dealers don't want you to think this way.

[29:29] Distributors don't want you to think this way.

[29:31] Remember they want you.

[29:33] They want you to think that every new game is going to bring your life more fulfillment,

[29:36] more satisfaction and I'm just here to say at these prices, I'm not sure that's the best way to live.

[29:41] Everybody, happy Monday.

[29:43] We'll be back later this week.

[29:45] Always fun to talk to you about pinball.
