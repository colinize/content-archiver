[00:00] Oh, yes, I'm the great pretender, Pretending that I'm doing well.

[00:11] Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars.

[00:15] Ah, welcome everybody. Happy Friday. Welcome to the world's number one drama-free pinball podcast.

[00:23] There's a reason why we have five Twippies. There's a reason why every year when they ask,

[00:28] who's your favorite pinball podcast? You vote, Canada. And the reason why is this.

[00:32] I don't always get my rumors right. I don't know everything happening in pinball,

[00:37] but I will try my hardest to find out what's going on in the pinball industry.

[00:43] And sometimes I'm correct, sometimes I'm wrong, but the one thing I am always is entertaining and informative.

[00:51] Now look, I know there is another podcast out there that really wants the Twippy badly,

[00:56] and they always go about it the same way. Let's insult Canada. Let's show our cards in July.

[01:02] All the interviews we're going to do, and then let's go get annihilated when voting time happens in, like, December and January.

[01:11] Are you ready for this drama-free episode? So here's the deal. I want to talk a little bit about what happened yesterday

[01:16] and how, because I said some rumors about American pinball, all of a sudden there was, like, this effort happening all around the pinball media space.

[01:25] To sort of say how Canada's wrong. We're going to debunk Canada. So here's the thing. What was I wrong about?

[01:31] And there's two things I want to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast, as we eagerly await for Stern to release a new game.

[01:39] Please, Stern, can you get us a new game in the next couple of months so we can just move on from Toy Story,

[01:46] move on from waiting for Haggis Pinball to make more than one game a week?

[01:50] See, without Stern Pinball making new games, we get stuck in these little boutique ruts.

[01:56] And for some reason right now, all of these boutique companies have failed to live up to their promises,

[02:02] and now they're making huge hyperbolic statements like the following.

[02:08] That the legends of the Mahala game, which 500 deluxe editions are being made,

[02:15] okay, 500, we are hearing that there is twice as many orders for the classic or standard edition of the game.

[02:24] Now, I called BS on this, and the reason why I'm calling BS on this is that it is BS.

[02:29] There are not 1,000 orders for the standard edition of Legends of Mahala,

[02:35] and this is being promoted as news, as being accurate, as being a fact.

[02:41] So I went on the record and I said, if David Fix over to American Pinball can prove that there are 1,000 orders for the standard edition of Legends of Mahala,

[02:52] I will mail him a Twippy.

[02:54] Now, look, I hope American Pinball's next game with Dennis Nordman is a great game.

[03:00] I love Dennis Nordman. I think he's one of the most talented designers out there.

[03:04] We also got some debunking of Canada that maybe Dennis Nordman's next game is not a sequel to Whitewater,

[03:12] and I hope it's not a sequel to Whitewater because I don't want a sequel to Whitewater.

[03:17] Would it be cool to make one? Sure. Should they take it in a new direction? Absolutely.

[03:22] It's the smarter move.

[03:23] And so when I said it's a rumor that his next game is a follow-up to Whitewater, it's a rumor.

[03:30] I haven't seen it. I don't know if it's true or not, and guess what?

[03:33] We got the truth out because of the rumor.

[03:36] See, half of the times I say stuff, it's right all of the time.

[03:40] No, that doesn't even make sense.

[03:41] But the reason why rumors sometimes are effective in getting the truth out is that a lot of these companies won't say anything ever.

[03:49] And there are circles of people who know what's going on, and they will never tell you because they have special interests with these companies.

[03:57] So for example, if you're an artist working on an American pinball game,

[04:02] you're not going to be able to tell people what it is even though you know what it is.

[04:05] So if I say it's a sequel to Whitewater and you know that's wrong, great.

[04:09] Tell us we're wrong and we'll start speculating again.

[04:12] See, speculating about what's happening in the pinball world is fun.

[04:16] It has always been fun over the last five years to listen to this show and all of us together wonder what's coming around the corner.

[04:25] Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong.

[04:28] But I am right when I am saying that there are not a thousand orders of Legends of Bahá'u'lláh.

[04:33] And the reason why I know I'm right and I don't know why David Ficks made this up is I've talked to dealers and distributors yesterday.

[04:40] And you know what they all told me?

[04:42] They said, Chris, we haven't even gotten most of our orders for the deluxe edition.

[04:46] And some people are at the point now where they're getting very impatient and they don't even have all of those games sold.

[04:52] So while they sold through 500 Legends of Bahá'u'lláh deluxe editions, they did not sell out of them.

[05:00] So why would dealers and distributors who haven't even sold all of those games order even more games from them?

[05:08] And the other part, they haven't even priced what the standard edition will be priced at.

[05:14] You can't even order it from American Pinball.

[05:17] So it's really strange to me that I put up a rumor show about American Pinball.

[05:22] It hits some nerves, right? It hits some nerves.

[05:25] And then all of a sudden there's like three or four stories on Naps Arcade about how great American Pinball is.

[05:32] The weirdest one, which is Josh Coogler making a 3D sculpt of Octo for Oktoberfest.

[05:38] Josh Coogler got basically let go from American Pinball.

[05:42] And now he's trying to sell you a 3D molded sculpt for a game that nobody really wants.

[05:48] I mean, the whole thing is just very, very strange.

[05:52] Now look, I will say this, American Pinball, just go do the work.

[05:58] Go make the game that everyone gets excited about.

[06:02] You've never done it yet. You don't have a hit game.

[06:07] Those are just the facts. You now are four pinball machines in.

[06:12] Four machines in. Have you even made 1000 of any of these games?

[06:18] Houdini, Oktoberfest, Hot Wheels, and Legends of Vahala.

[06:23] Now look, this is the thing with all of pinball content creation lately.

[06:27] It's like you either cheerlead or you're the bad guy.

[06:31] Like they called me cancerous.

[06:33] This is a cancerous podcast because I am calling BS on the fact that they did not get 1000 orders for Legends of Vahala standard.

[06:41] You know, the other thing that's happening in the pinball world that nobody wants to bring up and this is why Canadian is the bad guy.

[06:47] So when Damien took people's money and they paid in full for Fathom, he told people they would have their games in eight weeks.

[06:55] And I am on pinside yesterday.

[06:57] There are series ticket holders who paid in full and it's been 15 weeks and they still don't have their games.

[07:05] And so what happens in a world in which there is no Canadian pinball podcast, in which we don't hold these companies accountable.

[07:11] Nobody wants to talk about that. Like where's that news story? How is that not news?

[07:17] A company told people, give me all of the money for the game and I guarantee you you will have this game in eight weeks.

[07:25] And they've gone 15 weeks and people still don't have the games.

[07:29] And we're not supposed to talk about it. We're supposed to say that's great business practice.

[07:35] We're supposed to say everyone's a marketing genius now and pinball just because they played decently in tournaments.

[07:41] Okay, you see what I'm saying? And look, I hope everybody makes the show they want to make.

[07:46] And look, this is just where we're at. You know, I mean the pinball world right now is basically this.

[07:52] Toy Story 4 came out, it underwhelmed us. Okay, it did. It didn't come out. It wasn't the game we wanted.

[07:58] We've got John at Jack Barre just trying to convince everybody that you wouldn't even know it doesn't have Toy Story 1 through 3.

[08:04] Okay, John, sure. What are you talking about, bro? How can you play that game and not miss Toy Story 1 through 3?

[08:12] Alright, cancer show right now. Oh my God, Canada's six Twippy put it in the back.

[08:16] Alright, so then we get Toy Story 4. It comes out, it's underwhelming.

[08:20] We do know that Jersey Jack Pinball has another game coming this year. It is most likely Godfather.

[08:25] Okay, so we know that. Now look, I also said on my last show that Jersey Jack Pinball might not be remaking Guns N' Roses playfields.

[08:33] And I got hit up by Ken Cromwell. We had a great conversation and he said, Chris, that's not accurate.

[08:39] I spoke to our guys and we are going to offer the ability to buy a Guns N' Roses replacement playfield, but they don't know when.

[08:48] Now look, if you go back and remember when Jersey Jack Pinball said to us that they would offer us these replacement playfields,

[08:55] they said they would be available in the summer, which is now, and they would be available when Guns N' Roses production was done, which is now.

[09:04] So should we hold them accountable for what they said to us?

[09:08] What about those hundreds, and I mean hundreds of Guns N' Roses owners that have playfield issues?

[09:15] This was Jersey Jack's offer to them. We will let you buy another playfield.

[09:20] And now nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to bring it up.

[09:24] Nobody's looking out for consumers. And this has always been my thing with this show. I have your back.

[09:31] Nobody else does. I don't want to interview Jack Guinari.

[09:35] Okay, I saw Jack Guinari is going to go on the Super Awesome Pinball show.

[09:39] I don't want to interview Jack because I know the story about Jersey Jack Pinball.

[09:43] I know what Jack went through. I know how his company went from New Jersey to Chicago.

[09:48] I've heard all of the stories from all of the people that were there.

[09:52] And guess what? When you interview Jack, he can't tell you the truth.

[09:56] He absolutely can't tell you the truth.

[09:58] And I know it hurts him that so much of the company was taken from him, but I think what's going to happen now,

[10:03] I do think the future for Jersey Jack is going to be positive because I think Pat Lawler leaving the company

[10:09] is actually going to create a much more positive and good vibes over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:15] I firmly believe that. I don't think Pat was a good influence on the culture and the vibe of Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:22] And I think his departure is a good thing.

[10:25] I wish Pat luck in life. He's given us some of the best pinball machines,

[10:29] but I think his tenure over at Jersey Jack Pinball never delivered the magic Jack thought he was going to get.

[10:34] And that's just my opinion about that matter.

[10:37] Okay, so we've got fathoms aren't really shipping. They're making like one a week.

[10:41] We've got Legends of a Hala, which is now the most successful game in the history of American Pinball.

[10:46] I don't believe it. We've also got like Weird Owl is not really making its way to customers.

[10:51] I mean, months have gone by and I think one kit went out or one modular system went out,

[10:57] not the full game, just the modular kit.

[10:59] And nobody's asking where is production? Where are the updates?

[11:04] Where is the transparency from these companies?

[11:07] And that's the thing is like, why is everyone just on the sidelines after you handed companies money

[11:13] and nobody's really asking for updates?

[11:16] Like where is Cactus Canyon LE?

[11:19] They took your money in October of 2021.

[11:23] Why did they reveal a game and it's still not on the line like 10 months later

[11:28] and nobody wants to say anything and I'm cancerous and I'm negative and I'm not cheerleading everything.

[11:34] No, I'm not going to cheerlead a game that is 12 to $15,000 and doesn't have the movies I love in it.

[11:41] I don't think we should spend $12,000 on a toy story LE that doesn't even come with a cheap plastic topper.

[11:48] For $12,000, you can put inner art blades into the game.

[11:52] I got to buy that separately for 12 grand and everyone just says,

[11:57] hey, well, that's just it.

[11:58] Canada, you have to accept this.

[12:00] You have to cheerlead it and you have to play the game first before you can have an opinion on it.

[12:04] No, I don't need to drive every car to have an opinion about whether or not I think it's worth the money.

[12:10] You don't go see every movie.

[12:12] You watch a movie trailer and you make up your mind that that's not the movie for you.

[12:16] And why aren't we allowed to do that in pinball?

[12:19] You're allowed to see a pinball machine, not play it and say, nope, I don't want it.

[12:23] I don't need to play it. I don't want it.

[12:25] It might not speak to me theme-wise. It might not have enough in it.

[12:29] I might see it on a stream and say, hey, the code looks shallow.

[12:32] I'm absolutely allowed to do that.

[12:34] And so are you.

[12:36] And I just think there's this pressure lately.

[12:38] There's like this weird thing happening in pinball right now where there's a lot of pressure now from the cheerleaders again,

[12:44] that everything that happens in pinball needs to be supported,

[12:47] that every company in pinball needs to be supported, that we need to show our support.

[12:51] So fine. If you want to show your support for American Pinball, go buy a Legends of Vahala.

[12:57] Maybe the game is as popular as David Fick says it is.

[13:00] And that's great. I'm happy for them, but it's still not the game you know you want.

[13:04] And that's what it's at.

[13:06] I can't wait for Stern to come back because Stern is going to come back.

[13:09] And I mean this. They're going to come back and they are just going to clobber everybody.

[13:15] They are going to clobber everybody.

[13:17] They've had extra time.

[13:19] Think about how scary this is.

[13:21] Keith Elwyn has had extra time to do his game.

[13:25] Zambietti has had extra time to work on his art packages.

[13:29] The coding team over at Stern has had extra time to make the games even more flushed out.

[13:34] When Stern Pinball returns, they are going to return and be at the gates of boutique pinball like Hannibal's at the gates.

[13:41] And they are going to show everybody how it's done.

[13:44] You're not going to have to wait eight months to get your game.

[13:46] They're not going to lie to you and say, hey, give us your money and in eight weeks you'll have your game and then you don't have your game.

[13:51] They are just going to do what they do best.

[13:53] They are going to reveal a game.

[13:55] They are going to get every Ellie built within a month or two.

[13:58] And then they're going to move on to the premiums and pros.

[14:01] And they will make a few thousand every month and there will be no drama.

[14:04] And then they will be on to the next game.

[14:06] And I'm telling you this right now.

[14:08] When I hear American Pinball and David Ficks get up there and say,

[14:11] we're going to have four lines going at American Pinball.

[14:14] This is a joke people.

[14:16] And I don't mean to be negative right now, but I'm going to be a little bit negative.

[14:19] How dare he get up there and say they're going to have four lines going at American Pinball.

[14:24] They haven't even made one game that's been a smash hit.

[14:27] Now they're going to have four lines going.

[14:29] Building what?

[14:31] What's going to be on those four lines at once?

[14:33] What?

[14:34] There's just new demand now for Hot Wheels, Oktoberfest and Houdini.

[14:38] And you're going to have all of those games going at once.

[14:41] See, I'm just tired of these companies taking victory laps and saying this nonsense.

[14:47] And nobody calls them out.

[14:49] We don't need four lines, American Pinball.

[14:52] You just need one line with one great game and get it done.

[14:56] Nobody wants to look to the past.

[14:58] And all of a sudden now, when David Ficks first came back,

[15:01] he's like, it's all about the future.

[15:03] And what is he doing now?

[15:05] He's making the old games again.

[15:07] I don't know if they have left over parts, but come on.

[15:09] How much demand is there still out there for the older titles?

[15:13] And maybe right now because nobody's shipping anything new,

[15:16] but I highly doubt that we are going to see four lines going at American Pinball.

[15:21] Like they're going to have half as many lines as Stern Pinball over at AP.

[15:25] No, it's not happening.

[15:26] And all of this is just words.

[15:29] Words, words, words, words, words.

[15:31] They're just speaking.

[15:33] I'm not seeing anybody really get it done.

[15:36] And that's just a thing.

[15:37] Get it done.

[15:38] Shut Canada up.

[15:39] Like there should be a big sign at every boutique company that just says,

[15:43] let's shut Canada up.

[15:46] But Canada is not wrong because we're not getting it done.

[15:49] How many legends of Ahalas have you built?

[15:52] How many of these companies are telling you how many games a week they can actually make?

[15:56] How many Toy Story 4 CEs do you think are actually sold out?

[16:00] Sold through is one thing.

[16:02] Sold out.

[16:03] And nobody is transparent with any of this.

[16:06] So I'm allowed to, and you're allowed to, speculate and wonder and think and come to our own conclusions about what's going on at these companies.

[16:16] Now, if a game is successful, guess what we would see?

[16:19] We would see it being unboxed left and right.

[16:22] We would see people rating it highly on like Pinside's Top 100.

[16:26] We would have pages and pages of threads about how great the game is.

[16:30] And not just by people who own it, but by people who just play it.

[16:35] See, that's the greatest sign of a masterpiece game.

[16:38] It's not just applauded by the owners who have to justify their purchase.

[16:43] It's applauded by everybody.

[16:45] When you walk up to Godzilla and you play it, it's amazing.

[16:49] You don't have to own it to realize it's amazing.

[16:51] And it gives you that amazing feel in just a matter of minutes.

[16:55] Like it's a home run game.

[16:57] And that's all we really want.

[16:58] We want more games like that.

[17:00] We want games with a few major mechs.

[17:02] We want games that are themes that are fun and campy and entertaining

[17:06] and bring the energy to pinball to life.

[17:08] And I just wish other people in the pinball media would stop pointing their fingers

[17:12] and their arrows at me saying, I'm the problem.

[17:15] No, the problem is so many of these companies are not living up to what they said they would do.

[17:22] And nobody calls them out.

[17:24] Nobody even mentions it.

[17:26] It's so strange to me.

[17:27] So go ahead and do your interviews and get everybody on the other shows

[17:32] and cheerlead everything in pinball.

[17:35] And I'll be sitting back in my chair having a little whiskey,

[17:38] laughing my ass off as Stern Pinball laps everybody every single year.

[17:45] And Stern Pinball is one of the only companies that actually makes a profit.

[17:49] I don't even want to get into the fact that half of these companies are bankrolled

[17:53] by stuff outside of pinball.

[17:55] They're not actually in the green.

[17:58] And they know that Churchill Cabinet's supplying CGC with the money.

[18:02] Ametron's the financial backing of American Pinball.

[18:05] You know, Jerry's not making money off of multi-morphic.

[18:08] He's making money off of P-Rock.

[18:09] Like everything's coming from somewhere else.

[18:11] The Abbas family keeping JJP afloat.

[18:13] Well, I think JJP is finally like making money, especially at these prices.

[18:18] They better be.

[18:19] But that's just it.

[18:20] Everybody do your shows.

[18:21] Do your shows.

[18:22] Interview your people.

[18:24] I'm going to keep doing Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[18:26] I'm going to keep calling these companies out.

[18:28] I will give them praise when they deserve it.

[18:31] I will question them when they don't live up to their promises.

[18:34] I will call them out on quality issues.

[18:37] I will praise them when they design mechs that are praise worthy.

[18:40] But I won't spend 12 to $15,000 on an empty machine.

[18:44] I don't care how well it shoots.

[18:46] And I don't want any of us anymore to do these non-refundable deposits before we play the game.

[18:52] We all need to show ourselves a little bit more respect and how hard we work for our money.

[18:57] And we shouldn't just throw it at these pinball companies blindly.

[19:01] I think a lot of us have woken up to that fact over the last couple of years.

[19:04] Like we can't do it anymore.

[19:05] A, these companies are pricing us out of pinball a little bit.

[19:09] And we see that the value is not there.

[19:11] But it's also just too expensive.

[19:13] Just in general.

[19:14] Like everything now is like over 10 grand.

[19:16] If you want something that's got something in it.

[19:18] That's ridiculous.

[19:19] This hobby can't sustain itself forever if these prices keep going that way.

[19:23] Everybody, I love you.

[19:24] It's Friday.

[19:25] And here's the other thing that I love is every time they come at me with negativity,

[19:29] guess what happens?

[19:30] I get more club members.

[19:32] I get more people signing up.

[19:34] And I'm just going to throw one bit of shade at the end.

[19:37] This is the only pinball podcast that people would actually pay to listen to.

[19:42] And the thing I love the most is the haters and those people who colluded against me yesterday.

[19:47] They all know what I said on my show because they're all paying to listen to Canada.

[19:52] And nobody's paying to listen to them.

[19:55] Everybody, thank you for your support, your trippy votes and tuning in every week to the world's

[20:00] favorite and most entertaining pinball podcast later.

[20:17] Ending that you're still alive.

[20:24] Still alive.
