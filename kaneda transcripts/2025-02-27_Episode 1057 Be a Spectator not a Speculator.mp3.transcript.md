[00:00] You can run and you can hide, but I'm not leaving unless you come with me.

[00:08] We had our problems, but I'm on your side.

[00:11] You're all I need, please believe in me.

[00:18] Welcome everybody to Canade's Bimball Podcast.

[00:25] What's he doing?

[00:26] I thought he was going away.

[00:27] Now he's doing back to back shows.

[00:29] Well look, I'm about to go under tomorrow and have my surgery, so I thought let me just

[00:36] give my podcast fans more episodes to listen to because it might take a few days before

[00:42] I'm back in the saddle.

[00:44] Here's what I want to talk about on this episode.

[00:47] I want to give some of my wishes for things I hope happen in 2025, but before, there's

[00:53] always Pimball news.

[00:55] Every single day it's like, oh, what's he going to talk about?

[00:57] What's going on with Mr. Christopher Franci and Dutch Pimball?

[01:03] I just don't get it.

[01:06] First he releases this teaser image of the Big Lebowski 25th anniversary game with the

[01:13] curtains opening up and it's like something's coming big to TPF.

[01:18] Alright, we know it's not going to be the Big Lebowski.

[01:21] They're winding down production of that game.

[01:24] They're not going to make another version of the Big Lebowski.

[01:27] It's clearly a misdirect and Chris knows what he's doing.

[01:33] He's trying to make us think it's that, but it's not that.

[01:37] When he posted on a Dutch Pimball Facebook page, like, way to go Barry can't wait to

[01:44] join the team for the next game.

[01:47] And I'm like, what?

[01:49] Does that mean he's joining the team to do Back to the Future?

[01:53] I hope he is.

[01:55] Everybody wants Franci's artwork on Back to the Future.

[02:00] Joe Kamnikau is like Franci's guy.

[02:04] Franci does a lot of artwork with Joe.

[02:06] They did Batman together.

[02:08] I think they did Beatles together.

[02:11] So it would make total sense that Franci would come on board.

[02:15] The one thing that you can't control with Franci, he's going to tell people before you

[02:21] want him to tell people.

[02:23] And I thought he was like an exclusive guy at Spooky.

[02:26] I don't know what's going on.

[02:28] I do know that he's got a big personality and it's hard for him not to share his excitement

[02:36] when he starts to sort of be on these projects.

[02:39] I know that he didn't want to go anywhere near Harry Potter because I love how he talks

[02:45] about it.

[02:46] He's like, no matter what you do with Harry Potter, the fans are not going to be satisfied.

[02:52] And so, you know, look, he worked on Godfather.

[02:55] He worked on Elton John.

[02:57] Elton John was the nicer version of the game.

[03:00] Still a mistake by Jersey Jack not to have the Franci artwork be the collector's edition

[03:07] of that game.

[03:08] I think if Franci's art was on the CE, they would have sold way more CEs of that game.

[03:15] And I think the CE just doesn't look as good.

[03:18] It really doesn't look as good.

[03:20] All right.

[03:21] So at least there's something Franci's going to reveal to the world at Texas Pinball Festival.

[03:26] You know, people have been hitting me up and they're like, I'm going to TPF, Canada.

[03:30] What do you think is going to be shown at TPF?

[03:33] Now, TPF used to be a show where a lot of the manufacturers would reveal their games

[03:38] and, you know, they didn't reveal the games before the show itself.

[03:42] There would be like a seminar.

[03:43] Remember those days where we were looking forward to the company seminar?

[03:48] They would march in and have the games covered up and then they would pull the curtain off

[03:53] the game and we saw stuff.

[03:55] We saw stuff like dialed in for the first time at a show like that.

[03:59] Those days are over.

[04:01] I just feel like nobody anymore uses a show to wheel a game in and show it to the world

[04:08] for the first time.

[04:09] There's also been some like really bad show reveals.

[04:12] I remember I think it was Cactus Canyon where they were going to reveal it at Expo and they

[04:18] already had the games on the floor before their seminar.

[04:23] So you could like see it there before you saw it at the seminar, which was supposed

[04:28] to be the moment they revealed it for the first time.

[04:31] But I think COVID has changed pinball marketing forever.

[04:34] You don't need to go to a show and sales during COVID were phenomenal.

[04:39] And I think some of these companies realize that if I have a good title and a good theme,

[04:45] I don't really need to spend all the money, fly all the staff, do a PowerPoint presentation

[04:51] that's terrible that looks like a third grader did it, you know, and then reveal the game

[04:55] in this room full of sweaty men.

[04:58] And the first time the world sees our game is over the shoulder cell phone footage of

[05:04] Neil McCrae playing the game.

[05:07] Like that's not the best way to show your game to the world for the first time.

[05:12] You don't have to spend $100,000 like Jersey Jack on these hyper polish videos.

[05:18] You also don't need to make these stern videos.

[05:20] You know, they're always in that dark room and it's like Jack Danger or Zach Sharp, like

[05:25] walks up to the machine and has this really serious look on his face.

[05:30] Like that's not also the best way to do it.

[05:32] So I think for the most part, the shows have no longer become the moment in which these

[05:38] companies are planning their reveals.

[05:40] So at TPF, here's what I think you're going to see something mysterious from Christopher

[05:44] Francie.

[05:45] It's probably just going to be some artwork he's going to sell.

[05:49] I don't know.

[05:50] Maybe he made some Lebowski artwork.

[05:51] He's going to sell without permission.

[05:53] I don't think so because if he now is working on Back to the Future with them, I don't think

[05:58] he wants to piss off Barry.

[05:59] Okay.

[06:00] So we've got that something from Francie.

[06:03] I think we're going to get portal from Jerry and P3MultiMorphic, even though I feel like

[06:08] he hasn't really shipped any of those collector's editions of the Princess Bride.

[06:14] Remember, Princess Bride was revealed to the world a year ago.

[06:19] And I don't think a single person has got the game with the swords on the side and the

[06:25] full collector's edition for 13 grand has a single person even like received or unboxed

[06:32] that game.

[06:34] Why are these companies doing this?

[06:36] Why are you revealing a game that won't even go on the line for a year?

[06:42] And a big question I have about this year is when Jersey Jack releases Harry Potter,

[06:48] are they going to have a ton of games made?

[06:51] My worry is they are not because they're not on the line right now.

[06:55] Remember when they released Guns N' Roses?

[06:58] They had a hundred machines already made out on location.

[07:03] And what was fun about that, both Jersey Jack and Stern were manufacturing games well before

[07:10] reveal so that on reveal day it was like everybody can enjoy the game.

[07:16] Some games are on location.

[07:18] You could go pick it up if you were near the factory and we had a lot of excitement and

[07:23] energy and a lot of instant feedback on what the game was like.

[07:29] And I think if you're going to release Harry Potter in 2025, you might as well start making

[07:34] them now.

[07:36] You could have a thousand games made on the day you reveal the game and they would all

[07:42] be going out the back door to customers.

[07:46] Now I can hear some of you saying, well, Canada, the problem is with all of these new and box

[07:52] games, what happens if there are issues?

[07:55] My response to that, you're telling me you've been working on Harry Potter for years that

[08:01] you don't have like five to ten fully built production ready games.

[08:06] You don't have like five of them at least in a room somewhere where people are playing

[08:11] them nonstop for like a few thousand plays to catch any issues.

[08:16] We all know the answer is they're not doing that.

[08:20] All of these companies are so worried about keeping the secret and it is no secret.

[08:26] It's no secret that it's going to be Harry Potter.

[08:29] It's no secret that it's going to be King Kong.

[08:32] They're not testing these games.

[08:35] And so that is why I think we've seen a retreat, if you will, of pre-making games before reveal.

[08:42] They did not pre-make Elton John.

[08:45] They did not pre-make Avatar.

[08:47] They made people wait.

[08:49] There was a long gap still between reveal and people getting their CEs.

[08:54] And I think Harry Potter is going to be maybe more of the same.

[08:58] I think they might reveal it.

[09:00] There's going to be like a two month wait to get the game on the line.

[09:04] The problem with that is by the time they reveal the game to the time they make it,

[09:09] King Kong is going to come out and King Kong will be on the line instantly.

[09:14] And I do not foresee Stern Pimbal changing their new strategy, which is the Ellie games

[09:21] get made first.

[09:22] Now we're all hoping Stern Pimbal is testing the Ellie's of King Kong right now.

[09:29] Stern's had some dicey launches.

[09:32] Look at X-Men.

[09:34] Completely not tested.

[09:35] Look at Dungeons and Dragons.

[09:37] That motor had to be replaced.

[09:39] So if you read the writing on the wall, Stern is not adequately testing these games before

[09:47] they go in box to consumers.

[09:50] And as we all hope that King Kong is loaded with mechs and toys, you know, now that they're

[09:55] going to have Spike 3 and a price increase, we really hope the game does not ship with

[10:01] any issues.

[10:02] But if we look at the new Stern factory, they've had more issues than not with new in box reveals

[10:09] from the new factory.

[10:10] So I hope that's not the case.

[10:12] But I think, and here's my prediction.

[10:14] I actually think people are going to be unboxing King Kong's before they unbox Harry Potter.

[10:23] That is my prediction.

[10:24] Okay, so let's go back to TPF.

[10:26] We might have a new game from Jerry.

[10:28] Is Cuphead going to go to Texas Pimbal Festival by American Pimbal?

[10:32] I don't think so.

[10:33] I don't even think anyone works at American Pimbal right now.

[10:37] There is no line going.

[10:39] They are sitting on a bunch of old inventory.

[10:42] Nobody wants.

[10:43] I don't think Mukesh has a real direction on where he wants to take this company.

[10:48] And also, there is not going to be a good time to release Cuphead in 2025.

[10:57] And I'm saying that because where's the window?

[11:00] At what window in a world in which all these games are so much money, you've got amazing

[11:07] designers over at Stern, you've got Harry Potter license, you've got barrels of fun

[11:12] about to drop something nostalgic on us.

[11:16] Where is a game like Cuphead supposed to launch and convince anybody to buy one new

[11:24] in box at full price?

[11:27] The only people that are going to run and buy Cuphead at full price from American Pimbal

[11:33] are Mukesh and Ryan McQuade.

[11:37] And that's it.

[11:38] David Fix feels like he deserves a free one.

[11:41] And that is going to be it.

[11:42] There is not going to be much new in box sales on this title.

[11:47] They waited too long.

[11:49] And now I think as a brand, American Pimbal is kind of like a dead entity.

[11:55] I don't think they have a fan base anymore.

[11:57] I don't think they have any support.

[11:59] And I think people are going to show that with their wallets.

[12:03] Okay, so you might get Cuphead at TPM.

[12:06] Barrels of Fun is around the corner.

[12:08] You know me.

[12:09] Barrels of Fun.

[12:10] That show is their backyard show.

[12:12] As I go down this show, I might not even talk about my wishes for 2025.

[12:17] I just realized like I'm way off, but I love doing it like this.

[12:20] I just want to talk about what's relevant right now.

[12:24] And maybe this is way more relevant than my wishes for 2025.

[12:27] So I'm going to change the title of the show to something else.

[12:30] All right, so here we go.

[12:31] So we've got barrels of fun.

[12:33] And you know, everyone's waiting to see.

[12:35] Is it GI Joe?

[12:36] Is it Dune?

[12:38] This is their backyard show.

[12:40] This is the one.

[12:41] This is the one where it's close to them.

[12:42] This is the one where all their friends and families can go to.

[12:45] And I know they want to do something sooner than later.

[12:49] I know that David Van Ness is a smart guy.

[12:52] He's a marketing guy.

[12:53] He's an engineer.

[12:54] He knows a lot.

[12:55] Like he's a really good dude.

[12:56] But he also knows that this year it's going to be very important that they get the timing

[13:02] right.

[13:03] They've capped the production of Labyrinth.

[13:06] I think it's something like 1,007.

[13:09] So they're not going to make all 1,100.

[13:12] Okay.

[13:13] Now, now is the moment.

[13:15] This is the moment for barrels of fun.

[13:17] And I think they need to get out early.

[13:20] Remember, barrels is also another company where production doesn't happen quickly.

[13:27] This is something that everyone needs to be reminded about.

[13:30] I still don't think these boutique companies that slowly make games, I still don't think

[13:39] there's any reason to order one unless you're at the front of the line.

[13:47] Because by the time they get around to making your game number 300 or 400 or 800, by the

[13:55] time that happens.

[13:57] Some of the first 300 games are going to come up for sale.

[14:02] By the time that happens, they're going to bring some games to shows that you could buy

[14:07] off the show floor.

[14:09] And also by the time, let's just say they showcase GI Joe or Dune in April of 2025.

[14:17] All right, April.

[14:18] So if you order it, you're not getting your game anytime soon, but you've just committed

[14:23] to buying a $10,000 game.

[14:26] And the deposits are non-refundable.

[14:28] Remember this.

[14:29] Okay.

[14:30] All right.

[14:31] So you're waiting, you're waiting, you're waiting.

[14:32] And then in just a few weeks, you're going to see Harry Potter.

[14:34] And in a few more weeks, you're going to see King Kong.

[14:37] So why would you jump in right away?

[14:40] That's the way I feel about all of it is just wait.

[14:44] And looking at the market recently, I would love to tell you that if you wait it, you failed.

[14:52] If you wait it, you're not going to be able to get the game.

[14:55] You're going to be spoken for.

[14:56] And if you ever get an opportunity to get one, you're going to be paying through the

[14:59] nose to get the game.

[15:01] That's not true.

[15:03] Everything's become readily available all throughout the year.

[15:07] It's first release.

[15:08] Jaws, Ali readily available.

[15:10] You could have got one.

[15:11] You didn't have to spend more than 13 every single game, even Metallica remastered Ali.

[15:17] I love seeing the game sliding back down to 13 more and more of them are going to go up

[15:23] for sale.

[15:25] Now all those speculators are realizing they're not going to get 18.

[15:30] They're not going to get 17.

[15:32] Now there's going to be a race just to put any profit in their pockets.

[15:36] So it's good.

[15:37] It's good.

[15:38] All of this is good news for us.

[15:41] And I never hear any other pinball content creators talking like this.

[15:45] Remember this is not me complaining about price.

[15:48] This is just guiding people on the new reality of what makes the most sense.

[15:55] And the other thing is this, if you want to get the next boutique from spooky, from barrels,

[16:01] from Dutch, whoever it is, if you want to get it, the best way to get it is wait and

[16:05] cut the line.

[16:06] And when you get on the back of that line, you're going to be waiting longer than you

[16:11] should.

[16:12] Okay.

[16:13] So back to TPF.

[16:14] See the next game from barrels.

[16:17] Everybody is hoping it is going to be GI Joe and not Dune.

[16:22] I think it could just be something completely different.

[16:24] It might not be either of those two titles.

[16:27] And then we're not going to see anything new from Stern.

[16:30] We're not going to see Harry Potter.

[16:31] I don't think we're going to see medieval madness remake yet.

[16:35] They are getting these pulp fictions out the door pretty quickly.

[16:39] I know they were through half of the run and they're going to be done with the run of pulp

[16:43] fiction.

[16:44] Ellie's easily by April.

[16:46] So I think we're going to see medieval madness sometime in the summer.

[16:52] Hopefully because they've already made medieval madness twice when they announce it.

[16:58] It's on the line.

[16:59] They've ordered the parts, right?

[17:01] They know the vendors.

[17:02] They know who they need to go to to make this game again.

[17:05] And so those are going to sell.

[17:07] They're going to sell.

[17:08] Nice about medieval madness remake again is that all the royal addition guys that thought

[17:14] their games were worth 18 or 20 grand.

[17:17] Congratulations.

[17:18] We're about to get more.

[17:20] Whether it's called a royal addition or not, it's going to look exactly the same and have

[17:24] the same top or the same features.

[17:26] And so that's going to happen.

[17:28] And then we get to the interesting next game from C.G.C., which will come out in 2027 or

[17:35] 2028.

[17:36] And it's going to be Mark Richie's Halo.

[17:39] It's going to bomb.

[17:40] I'm telling you right now, it's going to bomb.

[17:42] Halo as a theme isn't even a thing anymore.

[17:45] I mean, it's just a weird theme to bring to pinball.

[17:48] Let me ask you guys a side question because I've been talking to people all week and someone

[17:53] came to me.

[17:54] They said, Chris, Canada, you know, Chris, Canada, same person.

[17:56] I don't think any of these themes coming out this year are really that great.

[18:02] And when you think about 40 to 60 year old men, are we huddled around each other?

[18:07] Geeking out and dreaming of getting Harry Potter, of King Kong, of another run of medieval

[18:13] madness, of Cuphead, of Dune.

[18:18] Think about it.

[18:19] There really isn't a theme.

[18:20] And I agree with that.

[18:21] That's within the 40 to 60 year old guys that this is what we've been dreaming about.

[18:27] Like this is what if we talked socially about what would be the top five themes we'd want

[18:32] to see in pinball.

[18:34] These themes are scratching that itch.

[18:37] And I agree.

[18:38] I agree.

[18:39] I think what's happened in pinball and it's not just this year.

[18:42] Let's be honest.

[18:43] You really haven't had something like a Ghostbusters in a long time or a Batman or a Star Wars

[18:50] in a long time.

[18:51] And I think what's happened is like since 2022 on or 2023, I think what's happened in

[18:57] pinball is we still love pinball.

[18:59] We still love it tremendously.

[19:01] We still get excited about what these companies are going to do to excite us to show us their

[19:05] creativity under glass.

[19:07] But I think pinball over the last two to three years has been we just have to kind of accept

[19:11] what we get.

[19:12] I don't think these have been the themes that people like really truly, you know, dream about.

[19:17] I don't.

[19:18] John Wick, no.

[19:19] Venom, no.

[19:20] Jaws, maybe a few people, but still Jaws is not the same as Star Wars.

[19:25] It's not the same as Ghostbusters.

[19:27] And then you get stuff like Evil Dead is not that for most people.

[19:31] It's definitely not Berio's barbecue challenge.

[19:34] It's definitely not Avatar.

[19:36] It's definitely not Elton John.

[19:39] So we've just had like all of these years of we got to just accept what we get.

[19:45] The problem is through those years, the prices are now through the roof.

[19:49] Just talking to someone who's like, Chris, I got a Lord of the Rings.

[19:52] Got it for like 5,500 bucks.

[19:54] And I'm like, man, that's like Lord of the Rings with all the voices and the moments

[19:58] from the movie and mechs that are more magical than most modern pins for 5,500.

[20:04] So I think that's going to be the real question mark I have is will the buyers line up for

[20:10] these themes?

[20:11] You know, at these prices, will they line up?

[20:14] I don't know.

[20:15] I don't know.

[20:16] The other thing we never talk about is what's happening in the geopolitical world and how

[20:20] that might impact pinball.

[20:23] All the tariffs going on, what's going to happen in the stock market, what's going to

[20:27] happen to your ability to sort of buy these luxury items, what's going on with the cost

[20:33] of living everywhere else in life.

[20:36] It's getting significantly more expensive to wake up every day and enjoy the things you

[20:41] want to enjoy.

[20:43] And also I think everyone's going to start to reprioritize their lives.

[20:49] So as I think about that, you're never going to fall out of love of pinball.

[20:54] You're not going to stop enjoying watching these new games come out.

[20:58] You're not going to need to stop enjoying pinball content like Canadian Pinball Podcast, which

[21:03] is tariff free, and I'm not going to charge you more than $5.

[21:07] I'm never going to do that.

[21:09] That's my promise to you.

[21:10] I want to thank each and every one of you that has increased your subscription amount.

[21:14] It means a lot to me.

[21:15] So thank you so much.

[21:17] Some of you, it's nothing.

[21:18] You know, you've got a lot of money.

[21:20] Some of you, I know you're cutting back, but you're still here.

[21:22] So I really do appreciate it.

[21:24] You're not going to really have to stop and join this hobby very much because also most

[21:28] of you have really great games in your home and you're satisfied and you don't need more.

[21:35] And I think more and more people are going to realize that, that this entire hobby, when

[21:41] it comes to new and box, has been dominated by the FOMO marketing of pinball over the

[21:48] last 10 years.

[21:50] All of these companies, it's about FOMO.

[21:54] If they made only one version of a game and told everybody, we're going to make this game

[22:00] and fulfill as many orders as we get, the pinball sales wouldn't be nearly as good as

[22:07] they are.

[22:09] They have created FOMO amongst the collectors of pinball.

[22:13] You can only have 500 of this version.

[22:17] You can only have this many and that drove a lot of the FOMO and all of the pinball sales.

[22:25] Don't forget this.

[22:26] The way Stern pinball gets dealers and distros to buy inventory is to basically dangle the

[22:36] LE allocation in front of them.

[22:38] If you want this many LEs, that's going to make you the most per sale and you want your

[22:45] allocation to be high.

[22:47] You have to commit to buying all of these premiums and all of these pros and that is

[22:54] how it's worked for a long time.

[22:57] But what happens when you hit where we're at now?

[23:01] FOMO pins are now a hugely depreciating asset.

[23:05] Anyone who jumps in on them is getting hosed and the FOMO to get those items, think about

[23:11] it, who has a fear of missing out on a pinball machine that's going to lose you $3,000 to

[23:17] $5,000 in one year?

[23:20] How does that continue to create FOMO?

[23:23] The answer is it won't and it's not going to last.

[23:27] If you were to ask me, I think the big change that's happened over the last two years is

[23:33] the collectible side of pinball is pretty much dead.

[23:37] The value in all of those arbitrary collector versions, the LEs, the CEs is gone.

[23:45] In a world in which that is gone, it's going to create a trickle down effect that basically

[23:52] makes everybody give up the FOMO.

[23:56] When you give up the FOMO and you don't rush up these games week one, think about what happens.

[24:02] They're still going to have to make these games because they got to keep the line going.

[24:07] The dealers and distros still have to buy them because that's their livelihood, but

[24:12] they're going to sit on them.

[24:13] When they sit on them, we're going to see more and more of these dealers and distros

[24:18] allowed to sell you these games on sale.

[24:23] Ever seeing it, the manufacturers have started putting their games on sale.

[24:27] Remember that never happened.

[24:29] I've been covering this hobby for 12 years.

[24:32] You never saw dealers, distros and manufacturers alike putting their games on sale because

[24:40] we never saw these things depreciate the way they are now.

[24:45] We've never had the volume and over saturation of inventory like we do now and it is a great

[24:52] time to be a patient buyer.

[24:56] As I think about Harry Potter and Calm, it's not back to the future and die hard.

[25:01] It's not fifth element and big trouble in little China.

[25:05] I know they're bigger IPs, but I just don't know if these 40 to 60 year old men are going

[25:12] to be clamoring for these themes.

[25:14] I hope they are both great games.

[25:17] I hope they both bring a lot of magical moments to pinball.

[25:22] I hope they give us endless hours of fun.

[25:25] They're both going to be very expensive in a world that's very expensive.

[25:30] So it's going to be fun.

[25:31] It's going to be fun to watch all of this, but for me and for a lot of you, it's more

[25:36] fun to spectate and not speculate.

[25:39] I think that's going to be the theme of this show.

[25:41] The smart man is a spectator and pinball.

[25:44] The dumb man is a speculator.

[25:46] If you speculate and go in on everything right away, only do that if you're a multimillionaire

[25:52] and losing all this money doesn't matter.

[25:54] But for everybody else, just spectate along with Canada and trust me, if you really want

[25:59] it and you love it, you'll be able to get one for a lot less money and use that money

[26:05] you're going to save to do other things in your life that will enrich your life way more

[26:11] than pinball will.

[26:13] Everybody I'm about to have surgery tomorrow.

[26:15] I hope you enjoyed this show.

[26:17] Thank you for your support.

[26:18] I really appreciate it.

[26:20] Invite some more friends to the show.

[26:21] I love that we're doing it here.

[26:23] I love being off of Facebook for a while and digitally detoxing.

[26:27] It's fun.

[26:28] Now they're all wondering what's happening.

[26:29] What's happening at Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[26:31] I think we're just doing the most entertaining show that's out there.

[26:34] I don't think anybody talks like this.

[26:37] A lot of people have tried to copy me, copy my format, copy my length of shows.

[26:41] You can't copy this because they can't talk like this because they're not like us.

[26:45] Later everybody.

[26:46] I'm a strike a chord and it's probably a minor.

[26:55] They not like us.

[26:56] They not like us.

[26:57] They not like us.

[26:59] They not like us.

[27:01] They not like us.

[27:02] They not like us.
