[00:00] I love it when you're born with hip hop, but throw your hands in the air, the user true player.

[00:05] I love it when you're born with hip hop, but take it.

[00:12] Ah, this is great. This is great. See, when you do pinball rumors and you put stuff out into the

[00:17] pinball world, the point of a pinball rumor. I won't explain what a pinball rumor means. And I said

[00:22] it on my last show. I said, I don't know if this is true or not. It's just something I'm hearing

[00:28] in the grapevine. Okay. Now, I never said it was news. I never said it was 100% accurate. In fact,

[00:34] I'm already hearing that Stern is doing James Bond, but they are most likely doing a catalog of

[00:41] James Bond games and not just a new movie itself. But apparently one of my rumors about Brian Eddie

[00:47] doing Harry Potter has ignited a fat checker out in the world. And I want to say a very, very

[00:54] special thank you to Mr. Christopher Franchi, who without me even asking is our new fact checker

[01:01] on Canadian pinball podcast. We're going to call this segment the franchi fact checking. And what

[01:06] will happen is this whenever I do a show about a rumor or a speculation, he is going to. He told me

[01:12] he's happy to do it. He's going to fact check it because he's hearing directly from the manufacturers

[01:18] what's going on. And we're not. We're not on Canadian pinball podcast. Everybody knows that nobody

[01:23] over at the manufacturer's talks to canada because you know that if I have information or news

[01:29] on a manufacturer that they don't want you to know that I'm going to serve it up to you. Now,

[01:34] sometimes I might be right. Sometimes I might be wrong, but 100% of the time it's going to be

[01:39] entertaining. So here is breaking news. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. The super awesome pinball show has

[01:44] called this breaking news defunct. Now, I did not say it was news. I said it was a rumor. So if you

[01:50] want to defunct a rumor, that's kind of weird. It's kind of like when they said that nobody can give

[01:55] their first impression on a game. We're not allowed to if you listen to David fix, we have to play a

[02:01] game before we can tell you what we think of it. Even if we have a first impression, but anyway,

[02:06] here's the news. This is why rumors are great because they actually pull out some of the truth.

[02:10] So the breaking news defunct from Joe Kamikau, who by the way, who by the way, you must know this,

[02:15] that Joe Kamikau and Chris are good friends. They work together at Zingga Games. And so that is Chris'

[02:22] connection to Stern pinball. In case you didn't know that, in case you didn't know what's happening

[02:25] behind the scenes, this is a direct info from pinball makers themselves. Joe Kamikau has said,

[02:33] Harry Potter is absolutely positively 100% not being made and designed by Brian Eddie. Okay, cool,

[02:43] cool. The rumor's wrong. It's not Brian Eddie, but then he goes on to say that anyone $1,000

[02:49] or a really good steak dinner on that one. And if I did have Harry Potter and it was going to be made,

[02:58] I designed it myself. All right, so this is a great sort of defunct of not just Eddie working on the

[03:05] game, but now it sounds like that Stern and Kapau don't have the Harry Potter license. So this is

[03:12] actually really good because maybe now all of us out there can put to bed that Harry Potter is

[03:17] coming out in pinball anytime soon because I'm so sick of hearing Harry Potter coming out. And the

[03:23] only company we want to make Harry Potter would be Jersey Jack pinball. So I want to say special thank

[03:28] you to Christopher Franchi fact checking everything we do. I really appreciate the effort. And let's see

[03:34] if he can fact check this next one that Christopher Franchi is doing the artwork for Ben Hex new game

[03:39] over at Chicago gaming company. I know that's happening. Let's see if he'll admit that. Come on, Chris.

[03:45] Look, man, we're all just doing pinball news rumors and speculations. I want to just use this last

[03:51] few seconds to say this. I think everyone needs to chill out, man. Like everyone's taking this so

[03:57] seriously, like me being wrong about a rumor really always have to put up this stuff to try to shame me.

[04:04] If you think that I should be ashamed because I got pinball news and rumors wrong, man,

[04:10] there's a lot more I'm ashamed of in my life than this stuff. We're just here having fun. Anyway,

[04:14] thank you for the new segment, Chris. We're going to have a lot more Franchi fact checking going

[04:19] on because we know and you know that I'm going to get a lot more stuff wrong. But hell, it's going to

[04:24] be a lot of fun telling you what's right and what's wrong in pinball later.
