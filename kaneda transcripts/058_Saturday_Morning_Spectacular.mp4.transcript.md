[02:35] Still got my cough, but you know, I'm dedicated to the cause.

[02:39] I'm just gonna talk about what a great week in pinball.

[02:42] What a great moment for spooky yesterday.

[02:45] What good vibes?

[02:47] The pinball world that's seen this week.

[02:50] I think it's restored a lot of our enthusiasm and joy for pinball.

[02:54] Welcome everybody to the Saturday morning's spectacular,

[02:59] a little special guest here, the future pinball podcasting, the chillest baby on the planet.

[03:03] Mr. Cassie and Win.

[03:06] I love this middle name after a friend of ours.

[03:12] So we're gonna get to it in a second.

[03:14] Let me just get my glass of water. Hold on one second.

[03:21] You tracking me, buddy?

[03:26] You tracking, Dad?

[03:28] Yeah, Dad? What? What?

[03:32] You have no idea. You have no idea yet.

[03:39] How cool your daddy is.

[03:42] Yeah, daddy's pretty cool.

[03:46] Mom is even cooler.

[03:49] All right. You ready for the show?

[03:52] Ready for the show? A little man tracking me?

[03:55] All right, let's open up Audacity.

[03:58] Record this for the Patreon subscribers.

[04:01] This is open to the public, everybody.

[04:04] So go tell your friends to come hang out.

[04:06] It's fun to do it on YouTube.

[04:08] I think we're, we hit a good groove here.

[04:10] Quality is better. It's easier for me to read the chat.

[04:13] And we're gonna have a fun show today because I, again, I contrary to the haters out there.

[04:20] I actually do enjoy when we have good news in pinball and we have games that are exciting

[04:26] and games that are exciting people.

[04:28] And I think that's an awesome thing.

[04:31] So welcome, everybody, to the Saturday morning spectacular.

[04:34] November 23rd. Who would have thought, you know, on this date,

[04:37] this is the date that Chinese democracy came out like nine years ago.

[04:42] Crazy. It was 2018 or eight years ago, whatever it is.

[04:47] Like, I remember it because I launched the Dr. Pepper program.

[04:51] And I remember them fumbling the free Dr. Pepper giveaway.

[04:56] And then the front page of the New York Times on Thanksgiving was that

[05:02] Axe Rose's lawyers were threatening Dr. Pepper.

[05:05] But you're not here to talk about that.

[05:07] We're here to talk about what I believe is one of the most fun weeks we've seen in a long time.

[05:15] We've seen spooky pinball release evil dead.

[05:19] And I'm not sure if it's sold out yet.

[05:21] It's going to sell out for sure.

[05:24] It seems to be a game that has rejuvenated a lot of people's enthusiasm.

[05:30] Not just in pinball in new inbox purchases in supporting a company that is building

[05:37] passionate products from the heart.

[05:40] And I don't think I've ever seen a clearer example of that than this game.

[05:46] Then watching the video up here that Greg and Zach put together this amazing feature

[05:52] on the game.

[05:54] And there's a reason why you don't see a video like this.

[05:58] Really, remember the Avatar one that cost $100,000 to make?

[06:03] So all of that polish did not equal a game that had heart and soul.

[06:09] This video did not cost $100,000.

[06:13] But I can guarantee you the game will have a lot more passion and soul.

[06:18] And you don't need a polish video to prove that.

[06:21] I dropped his little man here dropped his little sushi hold on a second.

[06:31] All right, so we're going to talk all about it.

[06:34] Yeah, it was 16 years ago.

[06:36] Gosh, Brian, thank you, man.

[06:38] I forget how long ago 2008 was I can't do the map.

[06:42] It's nuts that there's on there hasn't been a new guns and roses out since then.

[06:47] So let's talk about everything going on in Pimbal because I think what we got this week is a shot.

[06:56] Right in adrenaline shot to all of us in the world of Pimbal.

[07:00] And it's the right thing at the right time, the right company with the right message.

[07:06] And I think everybody is really, really happy.

[07:09] And I think that's a really good thing.

[07:12] I think if we think about where we go now in Pimbal, this is just what we want more of.

[07:19] We want themes that the designers are passionate about.

[07:24] We want a team that works on a game that really loves what they're working on and puts everything in it and isn't just answering an assignment.

[07:35] We want toys that interact with the ball.

[07:39] There's not a single toy in Avatar.

[07:42] There's barely anything in John Wick.

[07:45] You know, I think we're just over the gaslighting from some of these companies that we should just accept what they give us because.

[07:55] Yeah, you know, I don't know like think about the amount of things that interact with the ball in games like Wizard of Oz in games like dialed in in games like the Hobbit.

[08:07] In games like Pirates of the Caribbean, right, then think about what interacts with the ball, right, a real interactive thing in the Godfather in toy story in Elton John, right.

[08:21] And especially in Avatar.

[08:25] And so I think everyone is at the point now where they're just over these empty games that are super expensive.

[08:33] I mean, it is crazy to me for $10,000. This game is $5,000 less than Avatar CE.

[08:43] How much is in the game?

[08:46] And it's a wide body. I didn't even realize it was a wide body until someone pointed that out to me.

[08:52] It doesn't look like a wide body, but that's exciting.

[08:56] I hope it shoots fast. I don't know how it shoots. You know, there's always that fear with the wide bodies that they might be a little floaty.

[09:04] But I think this game, I think this game is going to be nothing but pleasure.

[09:10] And the more I thought about it, too, I was like, look, I'm not the biggest evil dead fan, but I kind of want this game.

[09:16] I'll tell you the reason I want it.

[09:18] I want this game because I know the callouts are going to be so funny, so hysterical.

[09:25] It's going to be like the next Rick and Morty. And if you've ever played Rick and Morty, gameplay is atrocious.

[09:32] It is a trotious gameplay. But the callouts and the humor and the personality in that game are just incredible.

[09:43] I love my guns and roses, but there's really not callouts in that game that make you laugh.

[09:49] I think they could have gone a lot further in G&R, especially with the explicit mode on making you laugh and saying crazy stuff.

[09:58] CD isn't a genre. We're not still talking about Chinese democracy.

[10:03] It's a phenomenal album gang. Like if you listen to it now after all these years, 16 years later, it's like a fine cognac.

[10:11] You have to appreciate all the notes in those songs and the fact that Axel actually cobbled together over 17 years, those songs.

[10:22] They're just, I don't know, they're kind of special tracks. I wish there was more of them in the game to be honest.

[10:28] There's some really like kickass songs that are not in the game in the pinball machine.

[10:35] All right, so how many of you out there ordered an evil dead from spooky pinball? Let me put up a little bit of a poll.

[10:43] Let me put up a poll here. I think I can do a poll. Start a poll. Did you order? Did you order? Did I say Rick and Morty evil dead?

[10:55] Okay, let's start the poll. Start it. It's up.

[11:00] I, um, yeah, I just think it's such a good vibe moment for pinball.

[11:07] I think as people look at $1,000 Metallica Ellie topper, as people look at American pinball's inability to launch a new game,

[11:20] as people look at Avatar dead on arrival, as people are trying to fix their X-Men's.

[11:26] What a good time for this company to hit with this game.

[11:31] And as I've always said this, and I said this to Cassie, and I'll say it to Killian, I'll say it to each and every one of you.

[11:37] It's never a bad time to release a great game, and it's never a good time to release a bad game.

[11:46] And I think a lot of what we're seeing in pinball these days is proof of that.

[11:51] You could release Godzilla anytime. You could release evil dead anytime. You could release, uh, jaws anytime.

[11:59] They're going to do fine. They're going to do just fine.

[12:02] Now we haven't seen this game play yet.

[12:05] There are critics that it might be too much of a fan layout. It might be too easy.

[12:11] You know, I will say when you play some of the like Scooby-Doo, it's a very easy game.

[12:18] But I think, you know, I think this game is going to end up in people's homes for the most part.

[12:25] I think it is going to bring joy and entertainment.

[12:29] And I think it's going to be the new chapter in spooky starts.

[12:34] Now I've been saying this. I think this company has had a lot of growing pains.

[12:39] I think they've learned a lot. I think they hear the feedback. I think they want to get better.

[12:44] I think they have gotten better. And I think they care. I think bringing Christopher Franchi into the fold.

[12:50] So smart. So damn smart. Like even on just a pure.

[12:56] This is maybe one of the most beautiful looking pinball machines I've ever seen.

[13:00] When you look at the toper with franchi artwork, the whole package on this game is going to stand out.

[13:08] And you're going to stand out in your lineup like nothing else.

[13:13] And that's a good thing. And it's 10 grand.

[13:17] Great 10 grand. And hey, there will never be more of these than a sternile.

[13:22] There will never be more of these than a Jersey Jack C.E.

[13:26] These are going to be very, very sort of, you know, scarcin' away.

[13:32] And the thing about it is, and I love that Luke said this.

[13:36] Luke, I'm going to give you credit for something you didn't say.

[13:39] I love that bug said this. We want to.

[13:43] We want to maintain the second hand value of our games for our customers.

[13:52] What a novel idea that your company will do much, much, much better.

[13:59] If people feel confident when they buy it, they're not going to see it for $4,000 less in just a few months.

[14:08] Hello, James Bond. Hello, food fighters. Hello every sternile other than jaws and Metallica have lost four grand.

[14:16] Four grand.

[14:18] So if you bought food fighters, James Bond, Venom, and John Wick, right?

[14:25] If you bought four sterniles, you lost $16,000.

[14:31] And maybe more than that, $16,000. If you bought four sterniles.

[14:39] And they just keep pushing the same strategy, the same products, the same number of alleys.

[14:46] It just doesn't work. It just doesn't work.

[14:50] And they seemingly just don't want to try anything different.

[14:54] They don't want to try anything different.

[14:57] A bug hired Francia. Yeah, it was like, you know what's saddens me is it's November 23rd.

[15:06] And I was thinking about how awesome it would have been if we had the twippies this year.

[15:13] How great of a year it would have been for people to come out and vote for all of these like interesting games.

[15:21] And it wouldn't have been a runaway.

[15:23] It would have been great to see X-Men versus evil dead versus jaws.

[15:28] It would have been great to vote, Francia, best artist because he would have won.

[15:33] Well, maybe not. Maybe the Metallica art on the alleys pretty damn good, right?

[15:37] That would have been a fun thing to see.

[15:39] And unfortunately with all of the content creators and all of the energy in this hobby,

[15:47] we just don't have an ability now to recognize the best of pinball.

[15:55] And I do think we should we should find a way to get the twippies back.

[16:00] Or at least Greg and Zach should do their show and make it more of an open vote.

[16:05] That would just be the easiest thing to do if if Colin doesn't want to do the twippies again.

[16:10] Just open it up for everybody.

[16:12] Just get rid of the whole, you know, here's like only insiders or content creators can vote.

[16:20] Francia, you did it.

[16:23] You know, I texted him personally that he crushed it. He crushed it.

[16:27] Different art on both sides.

[16:30] Everyone's going to have the same beautiful game.

[16:33] And when I tell you this everybody, get the butter cabinet.

[16:37] It is so nice.

[16:40] And you will never regret having the butter cabinet.

[16:43] The only thing you will regret is not getting the butter cabinet.

[16:46] I understand if you're going to shove it into a lineup, you might not want the butter cabinet,

[16:52] but you're going to still want the butter cabinet. It's just nice knowing that it's there.

[16:56] You know what I'm saying? It's like, why wouldn't you?

[16:59] Why wouldn't you just get it with all the bells and whistles?

[17:02] It's like a top-up.

[17:04] This $1,300 top-up is really the talk of the game, even.

[17:09] It's like, it is awesome.

[17:11] It is absolutely awesome.

[17:14] You've lost all your stuff.

[17:18] There you go.

[17:25] All right, just just, I'm just throwing stuff at him.

[17:28] I'm still in Ireland. She's on a flight right now.

[17:31] I don't even know what time she lands.

[17:33] Like the communication to daddy has been a little bit less than I would have liked.

[17:41] I think it's a test if I could keep this little munchkin alive.

[17:44] Are you going to keep throwing that on the ground?

[17:49] All right, well, you know, he's doing, he's chill.

[17:53] I tell you, my two boys, I name them.

[17:56] Obviously, they're going to be the Peaky Blinders.

[17:59] And they're going to be badass is, this is Thomas Shelby here.

[18:03] Thomas Shelby is the chill, just stone cold like you're never going to read him emotionally.

[18:11] He's just going to be a badass and get it done.

[18:15] Killian is Arthur Shelby, the older son.

[18:20] He's emotionally like his daddy, a prima donna.

[18:23] He's all over the place. He can't just relax.

[18:27] So I think this is going to be the boss man.

[18:30] And he's going to keep his older brother, Killian in line.

[18:35] Yeah, so look, lots of love for Franchie.

[18:39] No, Franchie, he said, thank you back.

[18:42] So, you know, look, everyone's getting along.

[18:45] Everyone's getting along.

[18:46] The only one who still refuses to get along with Canada is Don's pinball podcast.

[18:51] He refuses. He's still got me blocked.

[18:54] He's got, he's not, I haven't blocked him.

[18:56] He's still blocked Canada's pinball podcast.

[18:59] So like when I was chatting with, in the Facebook stream last night with Bug,

[19:05] I can't see anything that Don is posting.

[19:07] It's just Don, brother, like at some point, right?

[19:13] I'm just burying the hatchet, bro.

[19:15] Like seriously, like I don't have any ill will.

[19:18] I just don't understand why he still will not do it.

[19:22] I think I know why it's, it comes down to the whole like,

[19:26] if I do this, like what that signals to my followers and it's like, dude,

[19:31] nobody cares.

[19:32] Everyone would just rather see people get along, then keep feuds going.

[19:37] And again, like I don't talk about you.

[19:40] I think I get if stuff about you, man.

[19:43] And look, I've patched things up with them.

[19:45] Everybody. I mean, he is the only one that refuses to talk to me.

[19:48] It's just crazy.

[19:50] Anyway, if you know him, you should be like, look, it'd be a good look, man.

[19:53] It's Thanksgiving. It's the holidays.

[19:56] We're all parents. We're all just, we're all just like trying to get by in this crazy world.

[20:02] You know, the world's so expensive.

[20:04] I just got a fraud charge on my credit card for like $3,800.

[20:07] And all there's like some crazy BS charge.

[20:10] I'm like, that's that's not me.

[20:13] But everything else is so expensive.

[20:16] Have you ever get your credit card bill now?

[20:18] And you're like, wow, wait, what, how did I spend like $3,000 in the last like four weeks?

[20:23] You know, getting drinks for the Tyson fight, my, my Manhattan's just the alcohol.

[20:29] Right? Just the booze. Like Woodford Reserve, some sake, some Sherri Le Corre Amaru.

[20:35] Like just all the, all the booze, $575.

[20:40] Just for, for booze, for booze like to bring into the house.

[20:45] If you had ordered those drinks out, the bill would have been like $3,000.

[20:49] Because every one of those Manhattan's would have been $25 in New York City.

[20:54] Evil Dead has the best art package ever ever said Mike Donk.

[21:00] When Donk drops a comment like that, I don't know.

[21:04] Is it the best art package of all time?

[21:10] You know, it's, I think there's no answer to that.

[21:15] It's one of the nicest for sure.

[21:18] Has the art. Wait, Evil Dead has the art package.

[21:22] Yeah, there is no word there. He's, he left out the adjective.

[21:25] That's funny. Evil Dead has the art package ever.

[21:28] What does he mean? Is it the worst art package ever?

[21:31] Is it the best? Donk, what's the adjective?

[21:34] Where's the adjective, brother? You didn't, you didn't, you didn't tell us we're all going to be waiting.

[21:41] Oh, it is the best. He just confirmed it's the best.

[21:46] Now it's good. It's, it's good. It's like, it's like way better than gardens of the galaxy if I could just.

[21:52] No, it's funny. You know, I mean, when I, when I, if I had a ranked French, he's art packages.

[21:57] I would, I would go.

[22:00] Let's see, I would go Evil Dead.

[22:05] I would go.

[22:08] Monsters.

[22:11] Then I would go Batman.

[22:13] I just think those three to me are my favorites.

[22:17] You know, I know Batman. He, he had to do like a last minute job on it.

[22:21] But man, it's still so such a fun looking game, especially the SLE.

[22:26] But you look, Avatar art looks good Ninja eclipse. Like it's been a good year for art.

[22:33] What it hasn't been a good year for our toys mechanisms.

[22:38] It really hasn't been the best year there.

[22:42] I really do think spooky pinball is is in such a beautiful spot.

[22:48] And I want to just thank the team over there for.

[22:52] I don't just personally for making me excited about pinball again because I was in a rut.

[22:57] I was kind of feeling like, man, these new inbox games are all stupid.

[23:01] Like everyone's losing money and they are like this is not like canada wakes up and says,

[23:06] I'm going to make up facts.

[23:09] Right. I'm not making up facts that everyone who buys these new inbox turn at least are losing three to $4,000.

[23:14] Like those are just the, that's just the data shows.

[23:19] I don't want to see that. I don't want to see Avatar when you ask people like what are the mechs in the game and there's nothing.

[23:26] And then Jersey Jack flies is out there and tells us this is the most loaded game they've ever made.

[23:31] I mean, just you got to just remember what what are you telling me like that's gaslighting me.

[23:38] If you're going to tell me that this is one of the most loaded games you've ever made.

[23:43] And I look down at it and there's not a single toy.

[23:47] There's nothing that interacts with the ball.

[23:50] You have an engineered a single complex mechanism in the game.

[23:55] And then you didn't even get the UV light working and then all the clips are muted.

[24:00] And then everything is coming at me in some foreign knobby language that nobody understands.

[24:06] You can't even understand what's on the inserts.

[24:09] And you play the game for a few hours and you're like, I don't, I'm good.

[24:13] Like I just I don't even feel anything.

[24:16] Sort of like when you leave the Avatar movies.

[24:19] I don't never need to see that again.

[24:22] That's how you feel.

[24:25] Well, you know, look, it is what it is and the sales are speaking, right?

[24:31] It's like Jersey Jack is not going to be able to sell that game for the next four months.

[24:36] Like it's just like it's over.

[24:38] It's absolutely over and you know, Harry Potter is going to be hopefully going to turn things around.

[24:46] It's not hard Jersey Jack put toys in your games.

[24:50] Unmute the clips.

[24:52] And if you have all the assets, stop letting Keith Johnson f up your games.

[24:58] To me, this is Keith Johnson's got this way he wants to throw code at people.

[25:03] And won't listen to any feedback.

[25:06] Okay, cool. Won't buy it.

[25:09] Won't buy it.

[25:11] I got to be completely candid everybody.

[25:14] I love guns and roses.

[25:16] The worst part of the game is the 35 or 37 patches.

[25:20] Stupidest thing ever.

[25:22] It makes playing that game so so difficult.

[25:27] Like it's like when you're even when you're just going through the patches.

[25:32] You can't memorize what each of them do.

[25:35] Nobody wants to memorize 35 different like bonuses or attributes.

[25:41] And then what's annoying is when you're playing guns and roses and you're in a song and you're trying to change your patch.

[25:50] And you have to cycle through all these patches because remember like you got to cradle the ball to do that.

[25:56] Because you're cradling the ball and hitting the patch button.

[25:59] It then turns off the concert footage and goes to like all the menu screens.

[26:06] It's so like it's like dude, this game would have been better with just 12 patches.

[26:13] Just 12 patches.

[26:15] Like why why does there need to be a bonus or not a bonus, but just like why does there need to be like a.

[26:23] Plus up for every single mode every single album every single song every like it's just like what is this anyway.

[26:35] They still need to lower the price you but Jeremy how much did you buy your godfather Ellie for how much did you pay.

[26:43] Because I mean I think those things are going now for like what they were 12 new.

[26:48] I think you're you're walking out the door of the godfather Ellie at like 7500 right.

[26:55] I mean what you know I don't know how much are you paying.

[26:59] Oh yeah we forgot about franchise art on Elton John yes absolutely it's great like the platinum art is by far the best.

[27:08] And once again it's like so Jersey Jack you should have put franchise art on the CE.

[27:13] The fact that they didn't.

[27:15] It's again it just goes to show me knucklehead move.

[27:19] You've got franchi on artwork he crushes it make that the better version of the game.

[27:26] Um eight thousand dollars for a godfather Ellie and I think you might have overpaid bro.

[27:36] You can get like C's now for nine you know that right.

[27:41] 67 total plays the problem with 67 total plays man.

[27:45] It's like I don't know like what is that is just as much as you know that doesn't matter like none of this none of that matters.

[27:53] You're you know the you'll get your dimples you'll get your this you're not going to you know it's just.

[27:58] I don't know like it's it's it just doesn't matter also I wouldn't want to buy a game that only was played 67 times.

[28:08] You know what that means it means the game's not good.

[28:11] You can use the game's not good.

[28:13] How can you play a game 60 said I played Guns and Roses yesterday 67 times one day.

[28:18] Um.

[28:25] No I mean here's a thing it's like.

[28:30] It's like when um.

[28:32] When the dust settles and and boy is the dust settling.

[28:37] This hobby is sort of becoming a lot easier to see who's who's winning and who's losing.

[28:45] Let's do that right now who's winning in pinball and who's losing in pinball.

[28:49] And I'm going to be pretty candid.

[28:52] And you know because to me if I were to define what winning is in pinball.

[28:57] Is that you consistently.

[29:00] Are releasing games that are bringing people happiness.

[29:04] That you ship your games to customers in a timely fashion.

[29:10] That you have a you've built a brand.

[29:15] You know that you're transparent with the community.

[29:25] That you talk to the pinball community and listen to their feedback.

[29:30] And when you hear feedback from your customers.

[29:34] You incorporate that into future decision making.

[29:38] Right.

[29:39] So let's go down everybody now.

[29:42] And let's talk about who's winning and who's losing in pinball.

[29:48] Okay.

[29:49] And and and I'm going to give you my reason why and please in the comments.

[29:53] Let me know if you agree.

[29:54] Now look I'm going to just start off and say stern is winning.

[29:58] They they are winning.

[29:59] You know on their terms.

[30:02] How long their win streak will last.

[30:05] Is my worry because I think their win streak is over.

[30:08] I think stern has become a little bit.

[30:11] Of a one trick pony with L win you know L win represents 40% of their sales.

[30:19] And so like I'm I'm a little worried that stern pinball.

[30:25] You know there there's sort of they've made a lot of mistakes lately about.

[30:31] The themes.

[30:34] I think they've misread the community.

[30:37] I think they've focused way too much on stern army and location tournament sort of operator.

[30:45] You know buyers.

[30:47] And I think they've absolutely abandoned.

[30:50] The home buyer the home collector which actually makes up more of their sales.

[30:57] And I think they made a lot of really greedy moves.

[31:00] And they burned a lot of long time customers.

[31:04] And they're now feeling the residual effect of some of those moves.

[31:09] Now.

[31:11] But I also still do believe that stern has.

[31:15] Some of the best talent in all of pinball.

[31:18] They make some of the most fun machines of all time.

[31:21] I don't think you'd argue that.

[31:23] And I know they do care.

[31:26] I mean that I've met with George and Seth and Gary and Jack and.

[31:31] No and I feel the passion over there.

[31:35] I think where stern struggles.

[31:38] Is you remember like the volume they need to make.

[31:41] And then the amount of games they need to put out a year.

[31:44] I think has turned that organization into a little bit of a churn in burn sweatshop.

[31:50] Versus a company that is taking their time to get it right.

[31:55] To catch the quality issues at the manufacturing level before they pass those on to consumers.

[32:01] And I also really have to wonder.

[32:05] What the heck happened.

[32:07] When they passed on back to the future.

[32:10] Right.

[32:11] I mean you really have to.

[32:13] Have everyone who was in on that decisions head examined.

[32:17] How do you pass on back to the future.

[32:20] But make John Wick.

[32:21] And I know the answer.

[32:23] Is because stern much like Jaguar.

[32:26] Stern brought in a consultancy.

[32:29] This is the truth.

[32:31] They brought in a consultancy.

[32:34] And they did focus groups on what games they should make to bring in.

[32:40] The next generation of pinball enthusiasts.

[32:42] This is this is a true story.

[32:44] And when they put back to the future in front of them.

[32:47] It didn't hit.

[32:49] Because they those kids.

[32:51] Aren't in love with it.

[32:53] You really think that they put back to the future in front of John Borg.

[32:56] Keith L. Wynn.

[32:58] Jack Danger.

[32:59] And Brian Eddie.

[33:00] And they were like no.

[33:02] Let's not do that.

[33:03] I think Stern used their consultancy.

[33:06] I think they listened to all the wrong people.

[33:09] And I think they made a call.

[33:11] And they passed on what would arguably be.

[33:14] Probably their biggest selling game of all time.

[33:17] And I you know right now.

[33:19] I don't know if that deal is going to happen with Dutch.

[33:22] Okay.

[33:23] So Stern is winning.

[33:24] Stern is winning.

[33:26] Spooky pinball is winning.

[33:28] I mean, for all the obvious reasons.

[33:30] Spooky pinball, as I've said, I think they've done.

[33:33] Everything a boutique company should do.

[33:37] I think they are good human beings.

[33:40] And I think they care.

[33:42] And I think they.

[33:43] They just make you feel good about buying from them.

[33:48] They listen to you.

[33:50] They are getting better with each game.

[33:53] I think they understand their strengths and their weaknesses.

[33:57] And I think they've made some really smart moves.

[34:00] I think you know bringing Francia on board.

[34:02] So smart.

[34:03] And I think they understand that.

[34:06] You know, he's a very passionate guy.

[34:09] Like like all of us Italians.

[34:11] And he's going to say stuff that might not be PC.

[34:15] But in the end, who cares?

[34:17] You're going to get a great product.

[34:19] And you got a guy that's passionate.

[34:21] I mean, that's great.

[34:22] That's great.

[34:23] And he's got damn good talent.

[34:25] And I think bugging Luke and the family over there and Hilton and Ben Heck.

[34:30] And there's Mr. Francia right there.

[34:33] I think they're having a good time.

[34:36] And I think when you're having a good time and you're selling machines and every game you're going to make is going to be spoken for.

[34:42] You're winning.

[34:43] You know, if there's one area of improvement, I would like to see from spooky.

[34:47] It's a theme that is a take my money now theme.

[34:51] I don't think they've had that really.

[34:54] I'm going to say this.

[34:55] I don't think they've had that.

[34:57] I really don't not in the pinball buying demographic.

[35:00] I don't think they've ever had to take my money now theme.

[35:03] Rick and Morty was obviously the closest.

[35:06] But even when Rick and Morty came out, it wasn't like nostalgic.

[35:09] It wasn't a lot of us, you know, be honest.

[35:13] Never really watched Rick and Morty.

[35:15] And so we got into it because of the game.

[35:18] But they've never sort of dropped a triple eight.

[35:22] That's gotten nostalgia.

[35:24] That triple A with us, you know, I don't mean like it's going to be matrix or top gun.

[35:30] I mean, it's like an nostalgic theme that is triple A through the lens of the buying demographic.

[35:45] And so I think they're going to get there.

[35:48] I think it's going to be an exciting two to three years for spooky pinball.

[35:54] And I know that they're not going to have like overhead issues.

[35:58] And they're probably not going to have like tariff issues.

[36:01] And they're probably not going to suffer the pressures.

[36:05] I think that you know, Stern and other companies will feel.

[36:08] All right.

[36:09] So let's let's let's let's go back and forth.

[36:11] Some blues who's who's losing right now?

[36:16] I'm not going to go into detail because I can't legally speak about it.

[36:20] But I will.

[36:22] I will just give you the initials A.

[36:25] And the other initial is P.

[36:28] So they're losing right now.

[36:30] And you know all the reasons why.

[36:32] And that's all I'm going to say.

[36:35] If they want to.

[36:36] If they want to get into the winners column.

[36:39] They need to release a new game.

[36:41] That's a winner.

[36:42] And that's it.

[36:43] That's they know they need to do that.

[36:44] I think that's a fair assessment.

[36:46] Continuing to try to sell people on old products that people don't want.

[36:52] It's just it's just not a winning formula.

[36:55] And it's just not going to it's not going to work out.

[36:57] Hold on.

[36:58] I can get this guy.

[36:59] Come on.

[37:00] Okay.

[37:01] What do we want?

[37:02] Okay.

[37:03] You know what I want to get the hold on.

[37:05] Hold on.

[37:06] This one.

[37:07] When we go down and round.

[37:09] Look at that.

[37:10] Oh, all right.

[37:11] And we're going to see the winner.

[37:14] That's a good thing.

[37:15] So this is a good thing.

[37:17] So as you know,

[37:18] Su-shi.

[37:19] Su-shi.

[37:20] Everybody like Su-shi.

[37:21] Yep.

[37:22] So AP not winning right now.

[37:25] All right.

[37:26] Let's do another company.

[37:27] That's not winning right now.

[37:29] Who's not winning right now.

[37:31] Chicago gaming company.

[37:33] You know this is this hard one.

[37:34] Right.

[37:35] It's like.

[37:36] Secondly, you could argue either way for Chicago gaming company, but I think they're really

[37:45] in an annoying company.

[37:48] They're annoying.

[37:49] They're just annoying.

[37:51] They have no public facing transparency.

[37:56] They used to make some of the best quality games.

[37:58] I'm not so sure anymore.

[38:00] They don't talk to us.

[38:03] They just don't...

[38:06] They take forever to get stuff out.

[38:09] There's no excuse.

[38:12] I'm over it.

[38:13] I think they're losing.

[38:14] I think they've lost all momentum.

[38:19] I don't think people are enthusiastic about them.

[38:22] I think they've just made everybody annoyed.

[38:29] I think that's the only word I can come up with.

[38:32] I think you're an annoying Chicago gaming company.

[38:35] You've made no moves whatsoever to improve any of the things that annoy customers.

[38:44] You've made no moves to get products out faster.

[38:47] You've made no moves to have a marketing or social media personality represent your company.

[38:54] You continue to do absolutely nothing.

[38:57] You released...

[39:01] Cactus Canyon code update, but then you didn't release the update.

[39:06] You're still working on it after three years.

[39:10] You're still waiting for a plastic topper to be molded.

[39:13] We've moved on.

[39:14] Spooky Pimble just crushed that topper with this evil dead topper.

[39:19] Chicago gaming company in my book is losing.

[39:22] I think they've lost all of their fan base.

[39:25] I just don't feel like people care about them anymore.

[39:30] That was our two losers.

[39:31] Let's go back to who's winning right now.

[39:34] Turner Pimble is winning.

[39:37] Chris Turner.

[39:40] Nice guy in Pimble.

[39:42] All of us who have young boys raise them to grow up with the kindness and the jovial

[39:50] nature of that man makes me ashamed for some of my past behaviors.

[39:55] I mean it.

[39:56] His mama raised him right as we would say in certain circles.

[40:02] So he's nice guy.

[40:03] Right?

[40:04] Came from the worst place imaginable.

[40:06] Robert Muleer's Ponzi scheme.

[40:08] That's where he came from.

[40:10] And what did he do?

[40:12] Did he try to bring out Raza?

[40:15] No.

[40:16] Sold Raza off to Melvin over at DPX.

[40:20] He sort of took what he learned and he made a game to teach himself how to make Pimble.

[40:27] And he offered a hundred of them.

[40:30] And they sold out.

[40:32] And he's going to make them.

[40:33] And there's a lot of really interesting technology in those games.

[40:37] And if you look at the platform of Ninja eclipse, sorry.

[40:41] If you look at the platform, I think he's engineered a really much easier way to make

[40:47] Pimble machines, but you wouldn't notice it when you play the game.

[40:53] He's simplified a lot of the manufacturing process.

[40:56] And I think some companies are going to take notice of Chris's innovations.

[41:01] And I think he might even become a board manufacturer for some of these other companies that want

[41:07] to streamline their manufacturing, which is good.

[41:10] He's adding positive vibes into the Pimble world.

[41:16] So Chris, turn, or you are winning.

[41:20] Just get a theme we want next, okay?

[41:23] All right.

[41:24] Who else is winning in Pimble?

[41:26] I'm like thinking who's out there.

[41:28] There's a few that I'm not sure which way I'm going to go on.

[41:35] Jersey Jack is losing.

[41:36] They're not winning.

[41:39] And Jersey Jack will losing after like 11 years.

[41:42] They pain me the most.

[41:45] Because Jersey Jack is just like, they're like a, you know, they've got all the resources.

[41:54] You know, it's like a kid whose parents gave him everything.

[41:58] This is Jersey Jack to me.

[41:59] This is the analogy.

[42:00] Parents who gave you everything, they gave you the best schools, the best opportunities,

[42:06] the best of everything.

[42:09] All you had to do was show up, use common sense and put it together and you would have been

[42:16] fine.

[42:17] You know, you would have succeeded.

[42:18] You would have won.

[42:20] You would have won.

[42:22] And Jersey Jack, with everything in their favor, managed to destroy what that company stands

[42:32] for, post-pat law.

[42:36] It's crazy to me.

[42:38] I thought Lawler leaving that joint would have made them the best.

[42:43] I thought his negativity, his Gestapo tactics, you know, his, you know, Lord Lawler,

[42:50] like his, like his ego and his, you know, his inability to mentor and coach people there.

[42:59] I thought they would have got better after Lawler and it went in the other direction.

[43:05] They just started yanking everything out of their games.

[43:10] Jack Winari has continued to select themes that only appeal to him and they continue to

[43:19] code games in an overly complex way that makes them not attractive to casual players.

[43:29] They made pirates owners wait six years, six years to complete the code, six years.

[43:39] And I know these things in isolation may seem like no big deal, but it's not true.

[43:47] They are big deals because they signify a larger, a larger thing.

[43:54] They signify how much you care about the people who own your products.

[44:00] I mean, look how long it took them to upgrade the code for guns and roses.

[44:07] They've got the best selling game ever in five to six thousand households and they slept

[44:14] on polishing that code.

[44:18] And they, and they let G and R own, even like yes, I was playing G and R and I still

[44:23] for the life of me cannot understand why they can't with software update, not make the

[44:29] game so stupid, multi ball heavy.

[44:32] It's still I did all the adjustments.

[44:35] It's still there's moments in that game where I just want to take a sledgehammer and just

[44:41] destroy it because I'm like, I want to just enjoy the beginning of patience or civil

[44:47] war.

[44:48] And like, you know, think about a song like civil war.

[44:52] But the game should feed you multi balls based on like the energy and the moments in the

[45:00] song that build up to maybe some of that like insanity.

[45:04] But when you start a like slow song where you just want to get into it, right?

[45:10] Civil war is a great example.

[45:12] And you're just flailing with six ball.

[45:14] It's just it's so not fun.

[45:19] And it's all fixable with code.

[45:24] They just don't want to do it.

[45:27] And I think Jersey Jack has really doubled down on what you see is what you're going to

[45:34] get.

[45:35] And I think in their heads, I do, I believe I think they think they're making the best

[45:41] most fun Pimball machines on the planet.

[45:44] And in and in lieu of our feedback, which if they listen to our feedback as a community,

[45:52] this isn't just can a day.

[45:54] As a community, they would be so much further along as an organization if they found a way

[46:03] to actually adapt and change some things and improve.

[46:10] Okay.

[46:11] And I'm just curious.

[46:12] You know, I think the reason they don't is nothing's at stake.

[46:17] Nobody's accountable.

[46:18] Nobody's responsible.

[46:20] When you have endless money, you can do whatever you want.

[46:25] And you know, they feel like that.

[46:28] They feel like everyone's an employee getting a paycheck and they don't have to get it

[46:34] right to survive.

[46:35] It's okay, buddy.

[46:37] Okay.

[46:38] When I come down, when I come down, okay, hold on.

[46:43] This is better for you to choose.

[46:44] Choose the radish.

[46:45] Here you go.

[46:46] There you go.

[46:47] All right.

[46:48] Let me get his dodo.

[46:49] Hold on a second.

[46:50] I know some of you are probably like Canadian needs a dodo.

[46:54] Hold on a second.

[46:56] Dodo time.

[46:57] I saw a dodo in here somewhere.

[47:04] Okay.

[47:11] They put him back down in a little bit.

[47:19] This stays up for like an hour, hour and a half.

[47:24] All right.

[47:26] So, and I just want to end, you know, my Jersey Jack feelings with, I still believe in

[47:32] them.

[47:34] I still believe in them.

[47:35] I believe in Eric Minier.

[47:37] I believe in Mark Sidon.

[47:39] I believe in Tom Capara.

[47:41] I believe in them.

[47:44] Ken Cromwell and Jersey Jack and Jack Winari and Brett Abbas.

[47:48] I believe they're tired of this.

[47:53] They're tired.

[47:55] They have to be looking in the mirror a little bit.

[48:01] Like how many avatars do we sell today?

[48:03] Probably not many.

[48:05] How many we're going to sell not many?

[48:07] Are we going to know?

[48:08] We're not.

[48:09] Are we going to hit our goals?

[48:10] No, we're not.

[48:11] I think they have to be tired of games that are, let's be honest.

[48:18] They're flops.

[48:19] Godfather was a flop.

[48:21] Elton John has been a flop.

[48:24] Toy Story 4 was like, you know, like I'm sure they sold a lot, but man, a disappointment.

[48:31] And Avatar is another flop.

[48:36] You know, so like five years of your lives, like you haven't had a hit since Guns and Roses.

[48:42] So, you know, I think Harry Potter is going to be a moment in which if they win with Harry Potter,

[48:49] and that begins the next chapter, then so be it.

[48:52] Steve Richie wants to work on Top Gun.

[48:55] I don't think they're going to get the license.

[48:57] He's not doing Sonic the Hedgehog.

[49:00] And there's a really good chance.

[49:01] His next game is not a music pin.

[49:04] They have the matrix license.

[49:05] The problem is they don't have any asset permission with that game.

[49:08] So, you know, if they make the matrix, it's not going to have assets like you need to make

[49:15] it work right.

[49:16] All right.

[49:17] So who's winning?

[49:19] Who else is winning in the world of pinball?

[49:24] Who else is a fun?

[49:27] The name that we all made fun of.

[49:29] But Barrel's a fun is winning.

[49:32] I think everyone who likes the labyrinth theme has had a, you know, a great year.

[49:43] Like you got a labyrinth pinball machine.

[49:44] Like that wasn't really going to ever be made by anybody else.

[49:49] I think Barrel is a one better theme away from really showing us what they've got.

[49:57] I talked to them yesterday and they are targeting spring of 2025 for their new game.

[50:05] It is going to be released outside of the window of Harry Potter.

[50:10] So I'm thinking Potter is going to be February March.

[50:15] And then I think we're going to see April May be Barrel's a fun new game.

[50:21] I think it might be goonies.

[50:23] I think there's a goonies movie coming out next year.

[50:29] And look, they're, they've got to raise the bar.

[50:34] Labyrinth was okay.

[50:35] But man, it didn't really have the toys in it.

[50:38] But they, you know, they sold almost everyone.

[50:43] They were slow getting games out.

[50:45] But I still think they're winning.

[50:48] I don't think they're losing.

[50:51] And I think they're just going to get better.

[50:54] So I put them up there as a winner.

[50:57] Who else am I missing?

[50:58] All right.

[50:59] So let's go to, there's some hard ones now.

[51:01] Because I get to get, I get to companies like, you know, P3 multi-morphic.

[51:09] Is it just multi-morphic and P3 is the platform?

[51:14] Winning or losing?

[51:18] You know, I think Jerry's winning.

[51:23] I'll explain why.

[51:25] I think you're winning because, you know, people who,

[51:29] people who buy your platform seem to be enjoying it.

[51:33] I think Princess Bride is obviously your best game to date.

[51:37] And people say good stuff about it.

[51:40] You're manufacturing as slow as can be.

[51:42] But you don't rip anybody off.

[51:43] And you're pretty transparent on when people

[51:45] can expect their games.

[51:48] I want to put Jerry in the winning column.

[51:56] I could easily put him in the other column.

[51:59] But I think he's definitely in his own way.

[52:03] He's achieved what he's wanted to achieve.

[52:06] Stubbornly, I would have never done this platform.

[52:09] But I think he's winning.

[52:12] Let's go to Pimball Brothers.

[52:14] So we've got Abba, we've got Alien,

[52:19] and we've got what else?

[52:21] Is that it?

[52:22] Queen, right?

[52:23] Those three games.

[52:27] You know, like Pimball Brothers to me.

[52:34] It's like, you know, I just, I just,

[52:39] I think they're more, you know, it's hard, right?

[52:45] It's hard because like, they're not like winning

[52:49] or really losing in my book.

[52:51] They're not winning over people.

[52:54] You know what I mean?

[52:55] Like are people converted over to the Pimball Brothers?

[53:00] Because I think, because again,

[53:01] Alien was still just a remake of Andrew Highway's game.

[53:04] So if I were to look at what Pimball Brothers have done,

[53:08] after Alien, I'd have to say they're losing.

[53:13] Abba and Queen, like just not there, right?

[53:19] They're just not nearly the same caliber

[53:24] of what we're getting from other companies.

[53:27] So I would put Pimball Brothers in the losing column

[53:33] because I think they've, I don't think they've gained,

[53:36] like followers and fans and collectors.

[53:39] I don't think they've innovated or elevated

[53:42] or brought to the marketplace a theme that, you know,

[53:47] people really want, you know, look at the,

[53:50] and like the Abba art package on the regular one

[53:53] is one of the worst mailed in lazy things I've ever seen.

[53:57] It's like, if you don't take more pride in your own creations,

[54:02] how do you expect us to feel pride in buying them?

[54:05] So I think they've got work to do.

[54:08] I heard that Pimball Brothers has the license for Predator.

[54:18] I don't know if you guys know that.

[54:19] I don't know if that's an exclusive.

[54:20] I don't know if I should have put that behind the paywall,

[54:23] but I heard that they have the Predator license.

[54:28] Now, that's awesome.

[54:31] And I hope they have Arnold,

[54:34] because I thought that he's really hard to get his likeness.

[54:38] But if they make Predator and do it right,

[54:43] then they could be in the winning column.

[54:46] But I think they need to get a good designer over there

[54:51] that people know and trust.

[54:54] I also think if you make Predator,

[54:56] don't get lost in the world of UV lights,

[55:00] because UV lights have been the dumbest false promise of Pimball in 2024.

[55:07] All right, who else is winning losing?

[55:09] Let's go to, I mean, home pin's losing.

[55:13] I'm not even going to go into home pin losing.

[55:15] It's a waste of air time.

[55:16] I know you don't want to hear it.

[55:19] Yeah, they're not winning.

[55:21] Pajetti gaming.

[55:23] I always forget like, Pajetti gaming is like out there, right?

[55:26] They've done the funhouse remake.

[55:30] Pajetti gaming remind me what else they've done so far.

[55:34] I'm forgetting something.

[55:37] I, gang, you know this better than me.

[55:40] I know they do the funhouse remake.

[55:43] It was at their first game, Pajetti.

[55:47] I want to say there was another game they made.

[55:52] But I will wait to see what you guys say.

[55:56] World, well, the world win like they've done like these kits,

[55:59] you know, but I don't consider the kits to be really that like great, you know?

[56:11] Okay, so I think Pajetti gaming and I mean, I want to say, I just,

[56:18] I actually want to say, I think Rick and Planetary are losing.

[56:21] Man, I think Rick has made like, Rick has taken way too long to get a lot of these games to market.

[56:30] And I just, you know, in the 2.0 kids are not where they need to be.

[56:36] And I don't know.

[56:37] I just think Planetary, you know, they got burned by Damien and Hagg is,

[56:42] they've been too slow to get the games people want.

[56:45] Like I think there's going to be some crazy hype when Twilight Zone comes out from Chicago gaming company.

[56:50] I mean, that's going to be a huge moment.

[56:53] But again, like, you know, you play some of these older games and they just, you know,

[56:56] they don't hold up against modern games.

[56:58] They just don't hold up like the themes are a lot too shallow.

[57:02] All right.

[57:03] So Dutch Pimbal, winning here losing.

[57:07] And do we separate Dutch Pimbal from Dutch Pimbal X?

[57:10] This little man, by the way, is so good, right?

[57:12] He's like, sad here.

[57:13] You got to, you got to remember, he's been here in hour now, just chilling out with his

[57:20] dodo and his daddy.

[57:23] He hasn't cried or lost his cool.

[57:25] He's so much easier.

[57:27] I couldn't do this show of killing.

[57:28] We're here right now.

[57:29] Killian would be grabbing at the mic, throwing stuff at my head, going nuts,

[57:35] going nuts, put the artwork on.

[57:39] I love this frame TV.

[57:46] There we go.

[57:51] So Dutch winning or losing?

[57:55] I want to say, and I want to be honest here with Dutch.

[58:01] They, they're so close to being in the winning column.

[58:08] They're not losing, but they're, they're at a crossroads.

[58:14] And I think Dutch is probably the hardest one, right?

[58:17] Because they, they got themselves out of the big Lebowski quagmire.

[58:22] They have the biggest license in all of Pimball secured.

[58:27] They have, you know, the ability to make Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[58:32] They can make a boutique game for a year.

[58:35] Say what you will about Alice, but, you know, it's going to keep the lights on for them for a year.

[58:45] It's all up to Barry.

[58:49] And...

[58:52] And, you know, I, I know Barry personally, I know Melvin personally.

[58:56] And so I, I want to choose my words very carefully here.

[59:03] I think Dutch doesn't know how to do this.

[59:10] Like, and what I mean by that, I just don't think they, in 11 years,

[59:17] have gained the experience of really what it takes.

[59:22] To make a game, make everybody whole on their order,

[59:29] and then make another game.

[59:32] And order parts for that second game, turn the line over.

[59:36] And while you're making that second game, you're developing game three and four.

[59:41] I don't think they know how to do it.

[59:43] I don't think they've ever had to do it.

[59:46] And now they have to do it.

[59:48] And so when I think about Dutch,

[59:51] I don't know really if they have it in them.

[59:57] And what's crazy is,

[01:00:01] you gotta remember, if it wasn't for Alice, back to the future was not ready.

[01:00:05] Dutch Pimbal would have been over.

[01:00:08] There is no other way around.

[01:00:10] There was no game ready to go.

[01:00:12] There was no game ready to go.

[01:00:13] What Barry would have done if, if, if, because Big Lebowski, like, orders are done, people.

[01:00:19] Like the games are now selling for 11,000 on the second hand market.

[01:00:23] You know, you're, you're, you're gonna, you're not going to get new 13 five orders.

[01:00:28] And my, my worry is they, you know, didn't have anything ready.

[01:00:32] Like if Melvin does in design, Alice in 12 months, what did they have ready to go?

[01:00:38] What they would have done is they would have come back out with their bride of pinbott thing.

[01:00:43] You know, and they, they still have that.

[01:00:46] They've got the Brian Allen bride of pinbott.

[01:00:50] And to me, that's like, these dudes tried to lock that thing on us like six years ago.

[01:00:56] And here we are still no, you know, there's, there's not like an awesome back to the future white wood

[01:01:04] that's behind the door right now.

[01:01:06] And they know that.

[01:01:09] And so to me, what winning for this company, what I would do,

[01:01:15] is I would partner with Stern, make back to the future with Keith Owens, get your royalty, use that money to go get another theme.

[01:01:28] And instantly start development on the game that's going to come out after Alice production is done.

[01:01:34] Keep everybody busy with Alice for 2024.

[01:01:38] And then come out with like Blade Runner, you know, come out with another,

[01:01:44] like Rambo, you know, come out with something that, you know, is available that you can get and, and make it.

[01:01:54] So that's, I think there's a, there's a pathway to winning for Dutch.

[01:02:02] I think what will be the most difficult thing for Barry to do

[01:02:07] is to not have an ego or, or to be overconfident.

[01:02:16] You know, it's, it's the hardest thing for all men to do is to actually look in the mirror and say, I can't do this.

[01:02:24] Because I may be, I'm not as good as I want people to think I am.

[01:02:31] You know, it's one of the reasons why I don't start an agency.

[01:02:34] I don't start a PR agency, a marketing agency, because I can't keep an agency running.

[01:02:40] I'm good at ideas. I'm not good at operations, but it's more of an operational job to run an agency.

[01:02:47] And so the moment I like, you know, I could be like, yeah, I'm good.

[01:02:51] Everyone's going to come to me and I'm going to create an agency and I'm going to be responsible for people's jobs and salaries and getting clients and keeping clients happy.

[01:02:58] If I had to do all of that, I would fit.

[01:03:01] It's just not what I enjoy doing. It's not what I'm great at.

[01:03:04] So that's where I'm at with Dutch.

[01:03:08] And, you know, for those who are saying, Barry, make back to the future, Barry, make back to the future, right?

[01:03:17] I guess the question is, how much of Big Lebowski to Barry make?

[01:03:22] Did he make all of it? Then sure, back to the future should be no problem.

[01:03:28] But maybe Yop was responsible for a lot of back to the future, sorry, for Lebowski.

[01:03:34] Maybe Yop, you know, maybe Barry was in a different place.

[01:03:38] Maybe he had other help, you know.

[01:03:42] So, you know, as much as people say, Barry, this is your moment.

[01:03:48] You know, you can't fake it now.

[01:03:51] You know, because back to the future has such specific things.

[01:03:56] People are going to want to see.

[01:03:58] And if you don't deliver those things, you know, way more expectations than a game like Lebowski and Lebowski nailed it, man.

[01:04:07] Nailed it. Like the mechs, everything.

[01:04:11] All right.

[01:04:13] So, Dutch, I think, I'm fairly calling them out across.

[01:04:18] I also just want to say thank you everybody for joining right now.

[01:04:21] We are at 101 people.

[01:04:23] And we've been consistently over or around 100 people, which is better numbers than I was ever doing on Facebook.

[01:04:30] So I want to just thank each and every one of you for, for hanging out today, for migrating over from Facebook or Patreon.

[01:04:38] I do want to thank everybody for your support of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[01:04:43] We had some members of the spooky family, some new members sign up for the podcast this week.

[01:04:50] So thank you, spooky family.

[01:04:51] We've got now, I think everybody subscribing to hear what I'm going to say about their new game.

[01:04:59] Hey, buddy, hold on. Let me bring him in.

[01:05:01] I don't really care about Facebook that much anymore.

[01:05:05] Okay.

[01:05:08] Okay.

[01:05:09] Gain, give me, I'm going to, I'm going to go put him down. He's been up an hour.

[01:05:13] I'm going to go put him down and I'm going to come back.

[01:05:15] So just give me a couple of minutes and we're going to finish talking about all things pinball.

[01:05:19] Is that okay? Can you guys do that for me?

[01:05:21] All right. Make sure the baby is happy because the baby, he's tired.

[01:05:25] I mean, you can tell you like he's been listening to Canadian talk to an hour.

[01:05:29] I mean, that will, that will wear down any man.

[01:05:32] I'm sure all of you are feeling the same way inside after hearing me talk for an hour.

[01:05:36] Hold on.

[01:05:39] Do it. Do it.

[01:05:41] All right, little monstance.

[01:05:43] Let's get you into your snooge.

[01:05:48] Check for poo. No, poo.

[01:05:51] Oh, I love this age.

[01:05:55] It's like, it's like such a beautiful age.

[01:06:00] I mean, by the time he's older, Jersey Jack pins will be internet connected.

[01:06:06] You need poo? I don't think you poo.

[01:06:09] Check it. Where's mom?

[01:06:13] Where's mom up there?

[01:06:17] Bye.

[01:06:47] Bye.

[01:07:17] Bye.

[01:07:47] Bye.

[01:08:17] Bye.

[01:08:47] Bye.

[01:09:17] Bye.

[01:09:47] Bye.

[01:10:17] Bye.

[01:10:47] Bye.

[01:10:54] Bye.

[01:11:01] Bye.

[01:11:08] Bye.

[01:11:15] I have changed.

[01:11:20] I have changed diaper.

[01:11:26] We had a little number two incident.

[01:11:29] Oh, look, most people are still here.

[01:11:33] I had a change of diaper.

[01:11:36] I have a change of diaper.

[01:11:43] Did I get everybody on the winners and losers?

[01:11:46] Should we just look at this game?

[01:11:50] Should we just go to hold on a second?

[01:11:54] Let's look at this together.

[01:11:57] This thing is just damn beautiful.

[01:12:02] I'm going to have a look at this.

[01:12:08] It's just a little bit of a picture.

[01:12:14] It's a little bit of a picture.

[01:12:20] It's a little bit of a picture.

[01:12:27] I mean, I just like.

[01:12:41] Oh, my God.

[01:12:45] Come on, really?

[01:12:47] Google Chrome would like to record the computer screen.

[01:12:51] You guys got to be crazy.

[01:12:56] Okay, let's see if this works.

[01:13:03] Come on, guys.

[01:13:08] Can you see?

[01:13:17] Can we see this work?

[01:13:19] Can we see that?

[01:13:20] Can you guys see this screen?

[01:13:25] Can you see it now?

[01:13:28] All right.

[01:13:31] Wow.

[01:13:34] Look at this game.

[01:13:37] Look at this thing.

[01:13:41] It's just.

[01:13:43] It's perfect.

[01:13:45] It's so awesome.

[01:13:48] It's so much fun to look at this game.

[01:13:52] I don't think, Franci, I don't think you're the balancing is perfect.

[01:14:01] I think the coloring I love.

[01:14:07] You know, it's like, you know, like Metallica premium is too green and boring.

[01:14:12] This coloring is so nice.

[01:14:17] You did it.

[01:14:20] Let me go to another photo.

[01:14:29] Let's see.

[01:14:31] There we go.

[01:14:35] What's the.

[01:14:37] What's the second flipper button for?

[01:14:40] Is that for the lower play field?

[01:14:43] I mean, look at this thing.

[01:14:46] I just.

[01:14:49] I think this thing is going to pop in a lineup.

[01:14:52] It's for the sling flipper.

[01:14:55] Oh, cool.

[01:14:58] I mean, I just love looking at this game.

[01:15:01] It puts a smile on my face.

[01:15:04] It's good to some more.

[01:15:13] Hold on.

[01:15:15] I'm not going to be.

[01:15:18] Okay, when we look at.

[01:15:21] I'm assuming a little bit.

[01:15:29] I also just love the.

[01:15:31] I love the play field art.

[01:15:34] You know.

[01:15:36] And you know, I told this to Melvin.

[01:15:39] I am the black apron on Alice is.

[01:15:41] I'm not going to be.

[01:15:44] I'm not going to be.

[01:15:47] You know, terrible.

[01:15:49] Like you need to.

[01:15:50] Like the way this art.

[01:15:53] Blends in with the whole game.

[01:15:55] And it just looks so damn good.

[01:15:58] I want one of these games.

[01:16:00] But you know, I'm going to wait.

[01:16:02] Someone's going to mod the hand on the left to have the middle finger.

[01:16:06] I'm not sure if the game is sold out yet.

[01:16:08] They've sold.

[01:16:09] He said, thank you, sir.

[01:16:11] Okay.

[01:16:14] They're around the 500 mark in one day, which is great.

[01:16:18] Look, that's where I think they would be, you know, 500 units in one day of an 888.

[01:16:24] You know, my voice just goes like I'm sorry.

[01:16:27] But, you know, it's, but it also goes to show you gang.

[01:16:30] It's like, it's a tough market right now.

[01:16:33] You know, there's just so many people have.

[01:16:37] You know, there's so many games out there and, you know, and it's hard not to.

[01:16:42] It's hard not to kind of wait and see where things sort of net out.

[01:16:47] But I think 501 day is a great day for them.

[01:16:52] And it's just going to.

[01:16:54] It's just going to keep getting better.

[01:16:56] You know, I, again, I think.

[01:16:59] The word of mouth on this is super positive.

[01:17:04] I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

[01:17:10] All right, everybody, here's the deal.

[01:17:13] I know I took a pause.

[01:17:16] Can we all give Mr. Fransche a round of applause on his art for this game?

[01:17:21] How did we just get 140 people to join?

[01:17:24] Where did those 40 people just come from?

[01:17:27] Well done, Mr. Fransche.

[01:17:30] You and I have had an interesting history, brother.

[01:17:33] I've touched it.

[01:17:34] You're very talented.

[01:17:35] A round of applause for bugging Luke.

[01:17:38] Keep getting better.

[01:17:41] Keep making games for themselves.

[01:17:43] But like they crushed it on this.

[01:17:46] A round of applause for Zach and Greg who made another great feature at video that is going to make everybody want the game.

[01:17:54] A round of applause for Canatus Pimbal podcast, the most humble Pimbal podcast are out there.

[01:18:00] I have a number of six twiffies in a row.

[01:18:03] So many that they had to take down the entire award show because of his ego.

[01:18:08] A round of applause for Bill Brand is who makes tens of thousands of dollars a day, but does not sign up for Canatus Pimbal podcast, which is $5 a month.

[01:18:18] A round of applause for whoever designed the Metallica, Ellie topper, because it makes the spooky topper look like it's worth $5,000.

[01:18:29] Look, everybody.

[01:18:32] It's a great game.

[01:18:35] We just lost those 40 people.

[01:18:37] Like what happened?

[01:18:38] Did I just get put on like the front page somewhere?

[01:18:40] Where they all go?

[01:18:43] Everybody look.

[01:18:44] Have a great weekend.

[01:18:47] Have some drinks, spooky crew.

[01:18:53] And you know, congratulations to Ben Hacken and everybody over there.

[01:18:58] I really mean it.

[01:18:59] I think good vibes and positive energy is what we need a lot more of in Pimbal enough with the gaslighting enough with the empty games enough with the ripping people off enough with screwing over your previous alley owners like,

[01:19:12] you know, spooky pimples that they never going to make more Rick and Morty's.

[01:19:18] They never made more Rick and Morty's.

[01:19:21] Even though they know there's millions of dollars there.

[01:19:25] They never going to do it.

[01:19:27] I'm sure bug and Luke are like, what did you do, dad?

[01:19:31] What the heck did you do?

[01:19:33] Why did you say that?

[01:19:34] Like if you just never said that, we would still be making Rick and Morty's today.

[01:19:40] Thank you, Chris.

[01:19:41] Glad to see everybody having this much fun around the launch.

[01:19:43] Well, you know, thank you.

[01:19:45] Thank you.

[01:19:46] If it were up to me, man, we're up to me.

[01:19:48] I'd be making games as like like like blues brothers from home pin.

[01:19:52] That's that's that's my design talent.

[01:19:54] I'm Pimbal.

[01:19:56] So thank you guys.

[01:19:57] Good week.

[01:19:59] Good vibes.

[01:20:00] Everybody.

[01:20:02] Be good.

[01:20:03] Sign up for Canatus Pimbal podcast.

[01:20:05] I'm not selling guns and roses.

[01:20:07] It took me an eternity to get it up the stairs.

[01:20:11] I still love G&R despite all of its disastrous code decisions.

[01:20:15] I mean that.

[01:20:16] Like there's like the guns and roses is like a beautiful game.

[01:20:20] If you just it's so much better when you take away the fat.

[01:20:24] You know what I'm saying?

[01:20:25] And the just just let people enjoy the best parts of the game and cut out the fat.

[01:20:31] And the game would be so much better.

[01:20:33] Like why did they even need all these like multi balls?

[01:20:36] Like why why do you need pyro?

[01:20:38] Ant multi ball lights more like why who thought that every.

[01:20:44] Like we need it for different multi balls that you can start by just hitting a few switches a couple of times who why why.

[01:20:53] The game would just be better without any of that.

[01:20:55] Just collect the band members.

[01:20:58] Get in the song.

[01:20:59] And if you get through the song then you get to the mini wizard modes which are awesome.

[01:21:03] The album modes are awesome.

[01:21:05] I just want to focus on that.

[01:21:07] I don't want all this other stuff happening.

[01:21:09] And then you you go through all of that like pyro amp like all the four multi.

[01:21:13] They don't give you any freaking points.

[01:21:16] Like I get it like oh they're just meant to help you advance.

[01:21:19] It's like that's the problem with G and R in my honest opinion is like instead of just enjoying and knowing what you're doing.

[01:21:27] You're just always flailing all day long trying to trying to randomly advance everything and none of it feels skill based.

[01:21:34] It just feels like and and it's all fixable.

[01:21:39] They could fix all of this if they just simplified the game more and and amplified the moments that matter more.

[01:21:52] Just take away the frustrating stuff.

[01:21:54] There's too much of it.

[01:21:58] I did change the settings.

[01:22:00] I did.

[01:22:01] I how many times we have to change the settings.

[01:22:04] Can I just turn off all the multi balls?

[01:22:08] Everybody be good.

[01:22:10] Love you.

[01:22:11] Canada out.
