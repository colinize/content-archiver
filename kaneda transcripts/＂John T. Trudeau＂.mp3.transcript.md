[00:00] Oh yeah.

[00:03] Oh yeah.

[00:07] Say it again.

[00:12] Oh yeah.

[00:20] Yesterday I got about three or four text messages and Facebook messages sharing a link.

[00:29] I went to a Chicago Sun Times story and I immediately didn't open it up.

[00:35] I didn't know what it was.

[00:36] I was busy doing stuff on my day off.

[00:39] And when I clicked on the link, I was absolutely shocked by the headline I saw.

[00:46] And the headline read, Glendale Heights Man, Charged with Possessing Child Pornography.

[00:54] And then there's a picture of who we all know in the Pimball world as John Trudeau.

[00:59] And the rest of the story goes on to say,

[01:02] a West suburban man was arrested Thursday after investigators found child pornography at his Glendale Heights home.

[01:10] A child pornography investigation led detectives to 69-year-old John T. Trudeau according to Glendale Heights Police.

[01:18] They executed a search warrant at his home Thursday in the first lock of Medina Circle where they see his computer equipment containing child pornography.

[01:28] Police said, Trudeau was present during the search, was arrested and charged with two counts of possession of child pornography.

[01:35] Police say.

[01:36] So I was absolutely shocked and blown away when I saw that.

[01:41] And this is something that I didn't think I'd ever see.

[01:44] This is completely out of left field news for all of us who have spoken to John at shows and new John.

[01:51] I mean, this is kind of like those deep, dark things about people you just never know.

[01:57] And you never really know the full extent of somebody.

[02:00] Now, I was struggling on how to cover this on the Canadian Pimball podcast.

[02:04] And I think everyone out there who does a Pimball podcast isn't really well equipped to discuss a topic

[02:10] of this serious of nature.

[02:12] But because I cover the Pimball world, it is impossible for me not to discuss and give my thoughts on what has transpired.

[02:21] And what the conversation is happening over this on Pinside and in other places in the Pimball world.

[02:28] First and foremost, let me just say that I'm absolutely shocked and saddened by this news.

[02:34] I don't know of innocent or guilt.

[02:37] I will go into my thoughts a little bit on that and in a little bit.

[02:41] But just on a surface level, I'm very, very saddened to see this news.

[02:46] Because if the accusations against Mr. Trudeau are true, his life is over.

[02:52] His life is ruined.

[02:53] And, you know, deservedly so.

[02:56] You know, this isn't like I don't feel bad for him if he's guilty.

[03:00] I'm sickened by people who have any role to play in the exploitation of children.

[03:06] I think if there's anyone on this planet who is innocent and deserves the protection of adults and the police and law enforcement,

[03:15] it is the children of this world that are exploited all over the world.

[03:19] You know, if he's guilty of this crime, he's a sick man.

[03:23] He's a sick individual.

[03:25] And, you know, we don't know yet.

[03:28] We don't know yet whether he's innocent or guilty.

[03:31] And I know there's a lot of people going back and forth.

[03:33] And I was kind of upset when I was reading Pinside and seeing some people try to make some sort of like excuses for the behavior.

[03:40] Not really excuses, but trying to think, oh, maybe he downloaded a computer virus and put this on his computer.

[03:48] I think it's pretty safe to say that when the police issue a warrant in a subpoena and go into your house to seize materials,

[03:56] they have very, very strong evidence.

[03:59] Okay, this isn't just you're on a porn site and all of a sudden you've downloaded 30 porn files and one of them is of children.

[04:07] And it seemed like this was an ongoing investigation, which leads me to believe that John fell into a trap set by the police and willingly and knowingly downloaded child pornography.

[04:22] I can't even say I'm believing in saying these words on a Pimble podcast, but I have to talk about it.

[04:30] So if this is the case and police have evidence and this goes before the Court of Law and John is found guilty, you know, I hope they throw the book at him.

[04:44] I have absolutely again no sympathy.

[04:46] I think nobody does. Nobody does.

[04:50] It's sad to see the man's life over. We consider this man to be a great Pimble designer and we enjoyed what he did professionally, but it's clear that personally he may be a very, very sick man.

[05:03] And I know a lot of you, because we talk about this on a Pimble forum, it's really hard not to put this in the context of what this is mean for Pimble.

[05:12] And let me just say first and foremost, Pimble is the least important thing here.

[05:17] The most important thing is that the law and the truth come out and whether John's guilty or innocent that he's either absolved of these crimes or he's punished to the full extent of the law.

[05:30] I mean that is sort of where I'm at. I'm going to say it does not look good. It doesn't look good.

[05:36] How many of you out there have known friends where the police kick in their door and seize computers because they think there's child porn on there.

[05:44] It doesn't happen very often. We've all probably seen the TV show to catch a predator where they set up sting operations and they clearly identify individuals that are sick and that are willingly trying to gain access to underage children and pornographic materials of children.

[06:03] So I just you know it just doesn't look good. But I'm you know I can't go any further than that. What I can say is that people who are saying stuff like hey I'll happily go pick up a ghost buses or Congo.

[06:18] That's also disgusting. People should not be talking about the rise and value or decrease in value of this man's machines.

[06:28] I think what he did professionally for Stern absolutely has nothing to do with the fact of you know this new accusation against him.

[06:39] If I'm Stern and John Trudeau is found guilty of child pornography possession.

[06:47] Would I release a pinball machine designed by him. Absolutely not. We all know that he's working on a game with his on be right now and that game's pretty far along.

[06:58] I would absolutely start over. I don't think you can after the fact knowingly release it if he's found guilty. If he's not found guilty. That's a different story.

[07:10] I saw the name Michael Jackson brought up a lot in the threat. You know do people stop listening to Michael Jackson music. Remember Michael Jackson was never found guilty.

[07:21] Peter Townsend was that the other one I never found guilty. There are certain very high profile people out there that have eluded what most of society would consider to be true justice because of their fame and fortune.

[07:37] John Trudeau does not have the kind of social clout. I think to avoid this if he is guilty. I think people even though they appreciate it Michael Jackson's music.

[07:49] If he was found guilty and went to jail. I think you would find record studios and record labels releasing new music from Michael if that was the case.

[08:01] I think there should be pressure on Stern Pimbal to not release a game designed by John Trudeau if he's found guilty. I think it puts them in a pickle and a bind.

[08:10] I can tell you in almost any other industry in almost any industry if an employee of that company is found guilty of a crime like this. Everything they've worked on would be in question.

[08:22] Because Pimbal machines are designed by specific people and the designer has such a big role to play. I just don't see how you could sell a game designed by a man convicted of a crime like this.

[08:35] I know that's going to be up for debate. What happens to all the John Trudeau games that people have? I think that's just a case by case basis.

[08:44] I think some people are going to be sick to their stomachs. I think a lot of people out there who have children are not going to want to look down and see a machine that was designed by someone like this.

[08:54] They're probably going to want to get rid of them. I think you're going to have people who don't care. They will separate professional designer from personal child pornography possessor.

[09:07] They might not care. They might. That's going to be just something that you have to deal with on a personal level.

[09:16] Can you own something designed by a man who has a problem like this? Again, it's a problem. If he's convicted, he's a sick man and he has a disease and he really needs help.

[09:31] He's a troubled individual. Again, it's completely separate from what he was doing at Stern Pimball.

[09:41] I know people out there who won't own a J-pop machine. When people talk about they'll never own a J-pop machine because he lost people money.

[09:51] John lost people money. John was a business idiot. John never committed a crime. This is bad. If seeing people lose money is reason enough not to ever want to own someone's machine, then I think seeing someone convicted of child pornography would absolutely keep people from wanting to own their machines.

[10:14] It's a sad day for Pimball. It's a sad day for this community. I was talking to someone else who does a podcast and they were like, I don't know if I'm going to cover this because it's bad for the hobby. I don't know how you don't cover this.

[10:24] Not everything that happens in this hobby is going to be good. As a hobby, we're not used to talking about things that are this dark and this sorted and this disgusting.

[10:36] We normally are disgusted and get bent out of shape by really trivial things like delayed code and artwork and the price of a machine. Nobody wants to ever in a Pimball hobby deal with a crime like this or an accusation like this.

[10:55] I think it starts to show people's true colors a little bit too and how they respond. You'll see people even making jokes or thinking it's time to make a joke. I think it's absolutely disgusting to even remotely joke about a subject matter like this.

[11:15] I really see people contemplating that and I think it's disgusting. I think those of you out there who do post jokes, I think those of you out there on Pimball who have a tendency to make light of serious matters, people who post racist photos on there. I think those people are disgusting and I think they should be ashamed of themselves.

[11:37] I think everyone for the most part, the majority of this hobby is much better than that and I think people will look at this equally. I think people will wait for the truth to come out and I think people will be very demanding that Stern Pimball doesn't release a game by John Churdo if he's found guilty.

[11:59] Now if he's found innocent, that's a completely different story. I've had people saying to me, Stern is so cheap, they'll release the game because they're never going to spend the money to redesign it.

[12:10] I don't know. I think Stern will act appropriately. I know they will. There are a lot of really good people over there. This is much bigger than Pimball. This is a man's life is hanging in the balance of what happens here.

[12:27] His life will be over. His life will be over if he is found guilty of this. If he goes to prison, we all know what happens to those that exploit children in prison.

[12:41] I don't know what is level. I don't know. I don't know anything else about the case. I don't want to keep speculating on it. It's a terrible day for Pimball fans. We don't have many great designers.

[12:53] That's the thing too. To lose one of the best designers in Pimball to such a horrendous and heinous accusation is sad. Nobody wishes ill will on anyone in this hobby.

[13:08] This is a life destroyed if he's guilty. This has been just a little sort of my take on this whole thing. I think that everyone should be cautious about how they communicate in threads.

[13:22] It's with the subject matter like this. I think that there is no room to joke here. I can't wait to get past this. It's a sad, sad thing.

[13:35] We all should rally around each other and behave like responsible mature adults when discussing this topic. That's it. It's a terrible day for Pimball.

[13:49] Mark your calendars on the day that John T. Trudeau was arrested for something so despicable as child pornography. I wish I never saw this day. I wish this day never happened.

[14:03] I hope justice prevails. I hope whatever the truth is comes out soon. We can all put this behind us because it's terrible news.

[14:17] I had a few more news items. I don't even feel like it's appropriate to talk about Pimball. I want to let you guys have my thoughts on this matter.

[14:30] We'll get back to our normal sort of scheduled Pimball discussion. This just had to be a separate standalone podcast. I'm not even going to have any exit music because I'm just kind of really disgusted and saddened and sick and by the whole thing.

[14:46] I just want to get this up there. Share my thoughts. If you have any thoughts on the matter, I know you're probably sharing them on Pinside.

[14:53] You can always email me at canadapimball.com. Have a good week and everyone. Give your kids an extra hug tonight because they deserve it. We'll talk to you soon. Have a good night.
