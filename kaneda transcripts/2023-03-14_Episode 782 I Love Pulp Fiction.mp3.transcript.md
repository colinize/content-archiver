[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Binball Podcast. It is the greatest time to be in this hobby since

[00:26] I've been in this hobby. It is absolutely insane. Every single week we're waking up

[00:33] to a new game that is either getting people excited or turning people off, but I think

[00:38] everyone's excited because why wouldn't you want more pinball in the world? And now we've

[00:43] got all these great pinball options and we've still got galactic tank force to go, but let's

[00:47] talk about what happened yesterday with Pulp Fiction because I didn't think this game was

[00:51] going to land with that much enthusiasm. We saw the blurry photos of the game and I

[00:57] just want to say this right now, if you have not watched the straight down the middle like

[01:02] featurette on this game, it is Greg and Zach's greatest video to date. I don't think I've

[01:08] seen a video that gets me more excited about a pinball machine than this video did for

[01:13] Pulp Fiction and when you listen to the team who made this game, Mark Richie, David Teal

[01:19] and everyone over there, these guys are so excited about this game and the fact that

[01:24] Quentin Tarantino worked on the game with these guys, I mean that's all that comes

[01:29] down to. I want to talk about this game and what I think this game is doing to a lot of

[01:34] people. I think this game is reminding a lot of people that you can have a lot of fun in

[01:39] a pinball machine and you don't need a ton of stuff on an LCD. Wait a minute, Canada,

[01:45] you don't even need an LCD screen. Like what if the music is there? What if the callouts

[01:50] are perfect? When you hear these Pulp Fiction callouts, they will transport you to those

[01:57] scenes in the movie that you love and I'm just going to say this and I'm being totally

[02:02] honest. This game is bringing out more of the theme than freaking Godfather is and that's

[02:09] what I kept feeling like when I watched the featurette on Pulp Fiction. It's like their

[02:13] passion was just oozing out as they talked about the game and everything that's going

[02:18] into it and then I remember watching the Godfather featurette and they had a more of like, well

[02:24] you couldn't just make a Godfather movie so we had to make a mobster game and then skin

[02:28] it Godfather and I'm like, nope, this game is Pulp Fiction through and through. You are

[02:33] going to hear from all of the characters in the movie that you love and everything on

[02:38] the playfield itself is a visual cue to Pulp Fiction, everything from the Royale with cheese

[02:44] to the pawn shop to the watch and look at that briefcase that opens up and my gosh, the

[02:49] scopes actually look like the actors in the movie. They don't look like some Looney Tune

[02:55] character. This game just looks cool. This game looks cool and look, there's some of

[03:00] you out there that might say it looks cheesy. It doesn't look good. It doesn't look modern

[03:04] and that's why I think people are responding to this game because Quentin Tarantino wanted

[03:11] it this way and it just oozes cool. I don't know why I keep using the word oozes, but

[03:16] when I look at this game and I mean it when I say it, when I look at this Pulp Fiction

[03:20] machine and knowing how popular Pulp Fiction is in the freaking movie world, how iconic

[03:26] that movie is from 1994, knowing that there will only be a thousand Pulp Fiction Ellie's

[03:32] with this topper. This isn't going to be like Cactus Canyon where anyone can go buy the topper.

[03:37] When you stand back and look at this machine, I think we're looking at a machine that is going

[03:42] to be timeless. I think we're looking at a machine that is going to stay in people's

[03:46] collections for a long time and I think we're looking at a pinball machine in which anyone

[03:51] who walks up to it can enjoy it and have fun and not be overwhelmed by some overly complex

[03:59] like rule system, not be overwhelmed by everything lighting up at the same time and maybe all of us

[04:05] needed a little bit of a reminder that pinball fun can come at us in many different shapes and

[04:12] forms and I'm going to be the first one to admit I was wrong. I said no display. This game is going

[04:17] to be dead on arrival, but it's not dead on arrival people. In fact, this game is selling

[04:22] really, really well. I've been speaking to some of the biggest distributors and I bet all of them.

[04:27] I mean this. All of the thousand le's are probably going to be spoken for two day and you could

[04:33] argue like, Canada, wait and see, wait and see. Well, look, here's the thing people. We waited,

[04:37] we saw pulp fiction and I think we're seeing enough and I mean this. We're seeing enough

[04:43] where a thousand dollar deposit on this game is not even much of a risk. You have to put twice as

[04:49] much money to secure a Scooby-Doo in which there's going to be twice as many Scooby-Doo's and this

[04:54] game looks more interesting to me than Scooby-Doo. This game looks more interesting to me. I'm just

[04:59] going to say it then Godfather. I just like what they're doing with this game. It just looks like

[05:04] the kind of game you're going to walk up to. You're going to hear these sound clips. You're going to

[05:09] hear these five iconic songs. You're going to see the dancing on the topper and you're just going to

[05:14] have a smile ear to ear and I just don't feel like you're going to get that from every single new

[05:19] pinball machine that comes out and I will again compare it to Godfather. If you love the Godfather

[05:24] movie you're not going to walk up to that pinball machine and have a smile from ear to ear because

[05:29] they nailed the theme and it's not really their fault because Godfather is a bad theme for pinball

[05:34] and we're seeing it and Pulp Fiction is a perfect theme for pinball and when you hear these call

[05:39] outs and they're cursing at you and I'm not going to use curse words but this game I'm hearing is

[05:43] going to have more curses in it than any pinball machine ever and it looks to me like it's going

[05:48] to be like Rick and Morty if Rick and Morty was fun to shoot which it's not. You know it's funny

[05:53] is like when you look at pinball we have so much emphasis on ramps like ramps return the ball to

[05:59] the flippers I get it and it is fun to have the ball return to the flippers and then we have so

[06:04] much emphasis on LCD screens and what's on the screen but this game is reminding everybody that

[06:10] pinball for the most part should be below the glass. Look I wouldn't argue if this game had an LCD

[06:16] screen and they showed clips from the movie but I like what they did here I like the way it looks

[06:22] and I think this game is really challenging some of our perceptions about pinball and value

[06:28] because you could ask the question Chris after everything you say in your podcast

[06:31] is this Pulp Fiction game worth $10,000 or 9,500 bucks and here's the thing now in the climate

[06:39] of pinball in 2023 I absolutely think this game which is also 50% less money than a godfather

[06:50] it's 30% less money than a stern le and I think this game with its global appeal is going to be

[06:57] a game that is going to hold a much more value than anything else in the market again if you ask

[07:04] me like would I buy this game absolutely I would buy this game for this much money because I don't

[07:09] think you're really going to lose money in fact I think this game is going to be a game people want

[07:14] for years and years and years to come and I know I haven't played it yet but I'm just looking at it

[07:19] I mean it looks like it shoots just fine I mean it's for the most part for the most part it looks

[07:23] like a fan layout I probably would have liked a third flipper in this game to hit those pawn

[07:28] shop targets we don't know if gameplay is going to be great or not I could feel it like I could feel

[07:34] the vibes in this game and I think once that music comes on and once you hear those callouts I think

[07:40] people are going to fall in love with this game and look the market is speaking on this title

[07:45] Jersey Jack's godfather didn't sell out they're having a hard time selling the

[07:49] lees of godfather foo fighters sold out so they did something right there this game is going to

[07:55] sell out by today FOMO is not dead people I mean we all know FOMO is not dead see the thing about FOMO

[08:01] is it only happens when something is put in front of us that is really really enticing and again I

[08:07] think at this price all of a sudden now 10 000 feels like the new six thousand dollars in pinball

[08:14] and it is right spooky games used to be like six grand now they're 10 000 and so I wasn't surprised

[08:20] when they announced this game for 9500 bucks it also looks like there's a decent amount in this

[08:25] game and how do you put a price and here's the hard part right how do you put a price on owning the

[08:30] only pinball machine on planet earth that Quintin Tarantino has endorsed how do you put a price on

[08:37] the only pinball machine on planet earth that the man himself was involved with how do you put a price

[08:42] with the only pinball machine on planet earth that has Samuel Jackson and John Travolta and Bruce

[08:48] Willis and Uma Thurman doing callouts Harvey Keitel and Quintin Tarantino how do you put a price on

[08:53] all this it's just going to be a special pin and I completely misread the room on it I completely was

[08:58] off saying it wasn't going to land and it wasn't going to be able to compete with all these modern

[09:03] games and it's Mark Ritchie's return to pinball and when you watch the feature ed and you see

[09:07] Mark Ritchie you see his passion 26 years he's been waiting to come back to pinball and he comes

[09:14] back with a really unique game and so I think it's going to do tremendously well I think this is bad

[09:19] news for probably galactic tank force but not really and here's why because galactic tank

[09:25] force is going to get revealed in about a week it's going to be a much more modern zany pin it's a

[09:31] much more different direction on pinball the other good news for everybody else with pulp fiction

[09:36] is they're not going to be making these pulp fiction games until October re-october October seven

[09:42] months away like is this going to be cactus canyon all over again where you put your deposit down

[09:48] and then you wait like a year and a half for the game and maybe so and maybe that's why they revealed

[09:53] it right now which begs the question why did they reveal it right now and probably cgc needs to know

[09:58] how many parts to order and they're trying to get ahead of that really strange because everyone else

[10:04] is announcing games that are on the line right now but this is a game where like you're going to

[10:08] put a thousand dollars down and you're going to be willing to wait for it and then you're not really

[10:12] going to think about it until your game is up on the line the other part I really like it's in the

[10:17] contract with cgc they will not take your final payment until your game is two weeks from the

[10:23] line so that's good because I think a lot of people paid for cactus canyon le in full and then they

[10:29] wait it forever they're also going to let people who have a deposit down on cactus canyon roll that

[10:36] deposit onto pulp fiction so you basically can hold your pulp fiction spot with your thousand

[10:42] dollar deposit for cactus canyon so I also like that move royale with cheese the pawn shop the

[10:49] watch there's a magnet there's lots of spinners ripping them spinners there's drop targets the

[10:55] other thing I thought about when I saw this game was how stupid does James Bond 60th look now for

[11:01] $20,000 I mean look James Bond will shoot better than this game we know that Keith Elwin is the

[11:07] master of flow I don't think this game is going to have the same flow of James Bond it's not even

[11:12] about the flow it's about vibes like James Bond does not have cool music in it James Bond doesn't

[11:18] have callouts from the James Bond characters throughout the movies James Bond feels like a

[11:23] half to bake idea that isn't really executed very well the LCD screen in the middle of that game is

[11:31] ugly the one scoring reel is also ugly in that game I think it was an interesting idea by stern

[11:38] but I think they failed horribly at the execution of it I feel this game is the complete opposite I

[11:44] think they took a game they had a creative direction they wanted to go in and I think they freaking

[11:50] nailed the execution of this game and if you just bought a James Bond 60th you must be staring at

[11:56] the screen being like crap maybe I should have listened to canada and waited and saw what came out

[12:02] here because this is just a much cooler game that's the other thing too it's just so much cooler than

[12:07] James Bond 60th everything about it is cooler I mean look at the topper on this game and look at

[12:13] the topper on James Bond look at the cabinet right the cabinet on this at least it looks like a throw

[12:18] back cabinet it's super cool compared to the James Bond one of the ugliest cabinets stern is ever

[12:23] assembled oh man I'm like running out of breath the March madness continues and now we get to

[12:28] galactic tank force the final game there's been like eight games revealed since like Scooby-Doo

[12:34] and batting cleanup is going to be David Fix and Dennis Norman I'm a little bit worried that some

[12:40] of us out there are not going to be responsible with our money I'm a little bit worried there's no

[12:45] more money left to go around there really isn't that much money left to go around I mean you guys

[12:50] have to pay for your James Bond and your foo fighters and your Scooby-Doo's and your godfathers

[12:56] and your queens like how is there still money left to buy these games it is the greatest moment to be

[13:02] alive in modern pinball buying history I'm not saying these games are the greatest but we have

[13:08] never experienced six to seven new games in a month and a half period of time ever before

[13:15] it is a buyer's market it is a buyer's market people and that is a good thing we're getting

[13:21] great content from straight down the middle that featurette was the best thing they've ever done

[13:26] I mean it we're getting great passion from pinball designers young and old I love it we have young

[13:31] designers like Scott Denisi and Eric Minier and older guys like Mark Richie we have Steve Richie that

[13:37] wants to make a statement over at Jersey Jack pinball I just hope it's not Elton John we've got

[13:42] companies trying to figure out how to make godfather into pinball how to make pulp fiction into pinball

[13:47] how to create a foo fighters game which we all canceled off a year ago and now it's like this

[13:52] awesome 80s cartoon foo fighters adventure Scooby-Doo is out there breaking down on location left and

[13:59] right like people forgot about spooky quality like it was all of a sudden going to change over

[14:03] night I mean come on talk to operators about Scooby-Doo and how well it's holding up on location

[14:08] and yours truly canada's pinball podcast has set a record this march for the most amount of subscribers

[14:13] 576 I'm heading to Texas Brenda got me a little goat trophy that I might have to display if I go

[14:20] six for six at the Twippies and speaking of Twippies I don't think anyone cares about last

[14:25] year's games now that we've got so many new games I mean they should just rethink the entire Twippies

[14:30] and have an 11th hour voting about what's our favorite new game and have that as a new category

[14:35] everybody I look forward to the madness continuing I'm loving this pulp fiction game and I also think

[14:40] this is going to be a game people are going to be able to scalp and flip for a little bit more money

[14:44] than they paid for the scalping days are over for the most part but here's why you could scalp a

[14:49] pulp fiction if you get one for 9500 and they sell out there's room north for this game to go if you

[14:55] buy foo fighters for 14 five with tax and shipping I'm not sure there's room for that game to go up

[15:01] there sure as heck ain't no room for godfather to go up Jersey jack is the one company and I mean

[15:05] and I'm not trying to beat a dead horse with these guys or horse head in bed they got the pricing all

[15:11] wrong they just went too high and that is why people are just waiting on the sidelines like Jersey

[15:17] Jack's new business model like Jersey Jack customers now all of them are like if I just wait a few months

[15:23] I'll save a couple thousand dollars and these games will be new in box because distributors

[15:27] have to unload the inventory you know it's funny about these companies is they have to use like

[15:32] mafia tactics to get distributors to buy the products you know that like Jersey Jack goes to

[15:36] distributors and is like you need to buy this game or you're not going to get the next game and so

[15:41] there's a lot of fear like how many godfathers do I absorb and I'm still staring at a wall full of

[15:46] toy stories stern's not having that problem with foo fighters we're not going to see that problem

[15:51] with pulp fiction because it's going to take them like two years to make it scooby-doo buyers are

[15:55] regretting going in early you're going to see those scooby-doo deposits which people spent

[16:00] 2000 on now all of a sudden you're going to start to see those deposits sell for like a thousand

[16:05] dollars like you could have saved a thousand dollars if you just wait it I don't think you're

[16:10] ever going to see a thousand off on pulp fiction I don't know it's a great time to be in the hobby

[16:14] there's so many options and now the next game is David fixes batting cleanup will this tank game

[16:21] will it be able to find customers in such a crowded market I'm loving it everybody have a great day

[16:27] we'll talk to you soon not much between despairing next to see one night in fact I can the tough guys

[16:36] tumble can't be too careful with your company I can feel the zeppel walking next to me
