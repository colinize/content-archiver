[00:00] All right, we're live.

[00:03] Oh, let's turn this up.

[00:05] Get me some volume.

[00:07] Got the fireplace going, look, hold in here.

[00:12] Fireplace, I love a good fireplace.

[00:15] What a weird angle here.

[00:16] I want to talk about this evil dead game.

[00:20] It's like really exciting to me,

[00:24] what these guys have done, what they've pulled off.

[00:27] I really do think a lot of people

[00:29] are going to be happy with this game.

[00:32] And I want to talk about why I think this game matters a lot,

[00:37] because prices are where they're at, right?

[00:42] And they've been really high for a long time.

[00:45] And it's at the point now where mediocre games are just

[00:49] not going to succeed.

[00:52] And I want games to do what this game does.

[00:56] And let me drop in the Facebook real quick, everybody,

[00:58] that we're live talking about spooky.

[01:02] It's always nice to sort of go cajole

[01:04] some people from other areas to come join the fun.

[01:07] I'd like doing this on YouTube better anyway.

[01:10] So live now talking about evil dead.

[01:16] Yeah.

[01:21] All right, there we go.

[01:26] So what a great Friday.

[01:29] I mean, what a great Friday,

[01:33] new pinball in the world, gorgeous machine.

[01:36] I mean, absolutely gorgeous machine.

[01:38] The more I look at it, and when I saw the feature at video,

[01:42] the more I wanted it to be,

[01:44] I wanted it to be big trouble.

[01:45] I wanted it to be goonies.

[01:46] I wanted it to be Beetlejuice.

[01:47] I wanted it to be something that I just wanted.

[01:52] It makes me want to want evil dead.

[01:55] It makes me want to have been an evil dead fan

[01:57] because if you're an evil dead fan,

[02:00] you're doing back flips today.

[02:02] This is like the coolest evil dead machine ever.

[02:07] You couldn't even have thought about a better machine than this.

[02:12] So I just want to say, it is so nice to see a company

[02:18] nail theme integration like this.

[02:21] Like this is what you always want in a pinball machine.

[02:26] And I think what's happening in pinball now

[02:29] is the glaring misses, right?

[02:33] A game that nails theme integration this well

[02:37] exposes games that are such colossal misses.

[02:43] And with everything asking us for 10 grand or more,

[02:48] it's just, it makes you excited to go all in

[02:51] when they nail it, right?

[02:52] When they just get it right.

[02:54] And I think a lot of people, a lot of people

[02:58] are gonna love the personality of this game.

[03:04] And I gave my first impressions, which you know,

[03:07] I don't love the theme, but again, like it's subjective.

[03:10] So I don't, I don't ding them on really like making this

[03:14] because as I said, they've got to sell 888.

[03:17] I think they're gonna with a package this nice.

[03:20] I don't think it's gonna be a day one sell out

[03:23] or a week one sell out.

[03:24] And I also do think it's really hard for any pinball

[03:29] to go up in value.

[03:30] So if you wait, you'll probably be able to get one

[03:33] for much less than $10,000.

[03:36] But man, oh, man, oh, man.

[03:38] I think for me, the big story isn't that.

[03:40] The big story is spooky pinball.

[03:43] This tiny little company in Benton, Wisconsin just nailed it.

[03:48] Just nailed it.

[03:50] They just freaking nailed it.

[03:53] And Brett Abyss, living in Miami, flying in once a month,

[04:00] letting Mark side in make Avatar with Jack Quenari's theme

[04:05] selection, missed it.

[04:09] With, struck out at the plate with Avatar, right?

[04:13] I would rather own Evil Dead.

[04:17] I would feel proud to put Evil Dead in my home,

[04:20] with done Avatar, Stern with on John Wick, with on Venom.

[04:27] All these big companies with $100 to millions

[04:31] at dollars, billions at dollars, withing.

[04:35] And these dudes in Benton, Wisconsin,

[04:39] grew up with a bad father that let them watch horror movies

[04:43] on being sarcastic.

[04:46] They grew up in love with this stuff.

[04:48] They're living a dream.

[04:51] They're making games based on stuff they love.

[04:55] And they're putting everything they love into the game.

[05:01] I can't say that about what I'm seeing over at Jersey Jack,

[05:06] from a lot of what I'm seeing at Stern.

[05:08] It doesn't feel like the love is there.

[05:11] It feels like they're answering assignments.

[05:14] It feels like they're under a crunch.

[05:17] It feels like they're under pressure.

[05:19] I don't get that when I see this game.

[05:22] I see a family run business that is making something

[05:27] that they would make for free.

[05:30] That's how much they love the stuff they're making.

[05:33] They would wake up and do this for free.

[05:37] Where everyone else, it's just starting to feel like

[05:40] they're doing it for a paycheck.

[05:42] They're making decisions for the bean counters.

[05:45] They're cutting corners.

[05:48] And I'm tired of it.

[05:49] How do you design Metallica to be as beautiful as it is?

[05:54] And then you make the topper so uninspired, right?

[05:58] You make the topper so boring.

[06:01] When are we gonna stop?

[06:03] How do you launch that Metallica topper

[06:06] and say, this is what the world's biggest pinball company

[06:09] is capable of?

[06:10] And then these dudes in Benton, Wisconsin

[06:14] just drop this topper that goes on top of Evil Dead

[06:18] and it looks like collectively Christopher

[06:23] Franchise art package, full RGB LEDs.

[06:28] The coolest topper, I want one.

[06:32] I want one of these games.

[06:36] The more I see of it, the more like I want to be

[06:39] on the hype train with the people that get one.

[06:41] It just feels like this game is gonna be a fun, special game.

[06:47] To me, this is the beginning of a new spooky pinball.

[06:50] I mean it when I say it.

[06:51] Today is the beginning of a new spooky pinball.

[06:56] It, they are no longer gonna be laughed at.

[07:00] Not that they were, but they, I think they finally are like

[07:03] getting it and they're getting it right

[07:06] and they're gonna get it right on more popular themes.

[07:11] But man, it just, it just goes, I love what I love

[07:15] about this whole thing is you're never gonna beat people

[07:20] that have passion.

[07:23] The only way you're like, like,

[07:24] Stern's got talent, man, they got talent,

[07:27] they've got money, they've got robust teams.

[07:31] But man, like Wyson Coding X-Men was not passionate.

[07:35] Like I don't feel the passion in the code in X-Men.

[07:40] I saw the passion in Jack Danger's layout.

[07:45] I just don't feel the passion, right?

[07:48] And so I don't know, man.

[07:51] I don't know.

[07:52] I feel the passion in Guns and Roses.

[07:54] I have the machine.

[07:56] I love the game, but it's not rewarding

[08:01] it's not rewarding to only have one game be a music pin

[08:05] because you just don't feel like you're going on a journey.

[08:08] It's more about just scoring and music, which is fine.

[08:12] It's like playing a very expensive jukebox.

[08:15] But man, I need something that gives me a storyline

[08:18] that has callouts that make me laugh.

[08:20] And you know, from what Zach Mani was saying,

[08:24] this game's gonna have the best, most funny callouts

[08:27] since Rick and Morty.

[08:30] I'm really feeling like, yeah, man.

[08:32] Yeah, they freaking nailed it.

[08:34] They nailed the brief.

[08:36] And I don't know.

[08:38] Every hour that goes by, I'm just more excited to know that.

[08:43] We at least have a pinball company out there

[08:45] like doing it right.

[08:47] And what I love is like, this is gonna be like,

[08:50] the balls in your court now, barrels are fun.

[08:53] Like spooky, spooky just crushed it, crushed it.

[08:59] And I'm gonna love seeing barrels versus spooky

[09:03] and how these two sort of similarly size boutique companies,

[09:08] how much they give us for around $10,000.

[09:12] And I really do feel like this game is really well done.

[09:18] It's really well done.

[09:19] Like rest in peace cup, but there's no cup head.

[09:22] There's no cup head.

[09:23] There's no game.

[09:24] There's no, you know, AP showed up at IOPA

[09:27] and they're selling games that have been out for years.

[09:31] Jersey Jack shows up at IOPA

[09:33] and they're discounting all their product.

[09:35] You know, trying to get their games into redemption centers.

[09:38] What are they doing?

[09:40] Get your games into redemption centers.

[09:42] Is that your strategy?

[09:44] For the, for, you're the high end boutique pinball company.

[09:47] You wanna give redemption tickets?

[09:49] When are they gonna start acting like the Bugatti of pinball

[09:52] and stop acting like Chuck E. Cheese people

[09:56] like are gonna learn about my games?

[09:59] Is that what you want Jersey Jack?

[10:00] You want redemption centers to buy your, your Bugatti's?

[10:05] Wake up, Brett.

[10:06] Come on, call me bro.

[10:07] Call me.

[10:09] You've got so much money.

[10:12] You've got so much money.

[10:13] You now need to hire people that understand

[10:16] how to steer your company in the right direction.

[10:18] And again, like the optics of showing up at IOPA

[10:23] with redemption game strategy

[10:26] and putting your brand new game on sale.

[10:29] Do you understand the optics of that, Jersey Jack?

[10:33] Absolute disaster from a marketing standpoint.

[10:36] If you ask me, like you're already fire sailing your products

[10:40] and what that telegraphs.

[10:43] You know Gucci, Louis Vuitton, you know what they don't ever do?

[10:47] They never put their clothes on sale.

[10:50] There's no sale at Gucci.

[10:52] There's no sale at Louis Vuitton,

[10:54] but there's a sale at Jersey Jack.

[10:56] If you're down there in Florida, big mistake, big mistake,

[11:01] the perception of value.

[11:04] I would rather have this game over Avatar.

[11:07] I would rather have this game over X-Men.

[11:10] I would rather have this game over Jaws.

[11:14] I would, I just, there's something about this game.

[11:18] It just seems like it's just different.

[11:23] And not everybody's gonna have it.

[11:25] And it's load it with stuff.

[11:28] And the team making it is a bunch of wackadoodle weirdos.

[11:32] And that's what I love.

[11:34] Like looking at Ben Heck up there.

[11:36] Like I want Ben Heck making the code

[11:39] and the rule sets for my games

[11:41] because I want the dude to go to like the local bar,

[11:44] get wasted.

[11:46] And then think about some crazy stuff

[11:48] to put into the game.

[11:49] That's what Alice is adventures in Wonderland needs.

[11:52] I told that to Melvin.

[11:53] I'm like, there's, their game's not weird enough.

[11:56] That was my feedback to Melvin.

[11:58] Your game's not weird enough.

[12:00] It's like you've got these beautiful porn star looking women

[12:05] and where's the bouncy boob mode, right?

[12:08] Where's the, where's the weirdness?

[12:10] Where's like the strangeness?

[12:12] Where's the callouts that are inappropriate?

[12:14] Like it's just not weird enough.

[12:17] And nobody wants to play this like,

[12:20] you know, it doesn't make any sense.

[12:21] Your artwork is like soft core porn

[12:25] and then everything else is just kind of playing it safe.

[12:29] Make it weird.

[12:29] Now he knows he can do it.

[12:31] You gotta do it.

[12:31] You gotta go make it weird with the software.

[12:35] But I think, you know, we need soul

[12:37] and we need personality.

[12:39] Josh said,

[12:40] oh, this is a pretty game with no soul.

[12:42] I'm not gonna disagree with that, man.

[12:44] Like the soul comes from,

[12:48] you know, the vision of the team and the individuals.

[12:53] And I feel like for Alice,

[12:54] a lot of it was just like the struggle to get it made.

[12:58] Like that journey can't be all it is.

[13:03] You know what I'm saying?

[13:04] It just can't be this like,

[13:05] we took one of J-pop's broken foam core ideas

[13:09] and made it work.

[13:10] That's cool,

[13:11] but that's not enough to make a great game.

[13:15] So I just, again, like with games like this coming out,

[13:19] $10,000,

[13:21] I would get it with the Butter Cabinet,

[13:22] I would get it with the Topper,

[13:25] I would load it up and, you know, it's super cool.

[13:29] It's super cool.

[13:30] Even if you don't know Evil Dead,

[13:32] I think you're gonna walk up to this machine

[13:35] and you're gonna like,

[13:37] I don't know, you're gonna have like a stunning work of art.

[13:39] I mean, it is one of the most visually stunning games

[13:42] I've ever seen.

[13:43] I actually think this is Christopher Franchise,

[13:45] a greatest art package to date.

[13:49] Easily.

[13:50] I think Texas Chainsaw Massacre prices

[13:53] are gonna plummet like you've never seen before.

[13:56] I think everyone who owns a TCM,

[13:58] because to me,

[13:59] Texas Chainsaw Massacre is not fun.

[14:02] Like it's like real horror.

[14:04] It's not campy horror.

[14:06] And it's like inappropriate for a lot of families.

[14:09] And it's like, it's kind of like sadistic, you know?

[14:13] That's the wrong side of the genre,

[14:15] where this game is like campy and silly and over the top.

[14:20] And I think it's gonna do way better.

[14:23] I think Texas Chainsaw Massacre plummets in value.

[14:25] I think Loonie Tunes is also gonna plummet in value.

[14:28] Because again, as I said,

[14:29] I think Spooky Pimballs,

[14:31] I think Spooky Pimball arrived today.

[14:35] I think this is a new company.

[14:37] I think they've,

[14:38] I think the talent

[14:40] and their understanding of what makes Good Pimball

[14:43] is finally aligned with their abilities.

[14:47] I think it took them a while to get there.

[14:50] I think the 888 sellout, yeah.

[14:52] I mean, I think they're gonna sell these games.

[14:55] I don't know if they sell out today, Josh.

[14:58] You know, I still don't think they'll be like,

[15:00] extremely hard to get.

[15:02] And I think there's gonna be just a lot of happy people, though.

[15:08] And if like, if the thing is this,

[15:13] and I look at this with X-Men,

[15:15] I look at this with Avatar,

[15:18] I look at all the new releases.

[15:22] You wanna be on the happiness train.

[15:25] You wanna be happy.

[15:26] Like you wanna be on board with an owner club

[15:35] where people are happy.

[15:36] Like happiness is way more infectious

[15:40] and way more desirable than unhappiness.

[15:45] You know, people always say like,

[15:46] oh, Canada, how do you have 700 and like 40 followers?

[15:50] How do you make people pay for your content?

[15:53] How do you, like, it's because my show is not about negativity.

[15:57] It's not.

[15:58] It's about getting us to a place where we're happy,

[16:03] where these companies, that's the goal.

[16:06] I want you to be happy.

[16:07] I wanna be happy.

[16:08] I want these games to deliver the joy they should

[16:13] for the amount of money we're spending.

[16:14] That's Canadian's pinball podcast.

[16:16] See, all the other shows that just,

[16:19] like they celebrate all the mediocrity,

[16:22] to me, that's how you don't get to real happiness.

[16:24] That's how you get to fake happiness.

[16:26] That's how you get to gaslighting a community,

[16:29] like they've been doing all these years,

[16:31] by basically saying everything is awesome.

[16:34] That's not a pathway to genuinely good things,

[16:39] and good moments, and good products, and great products.

[16:43] And I love the fact that people are so happy

[16:46] when you go into the evil dead thread

[16:49] and you see the vibes around this game.

[16:54] It's nothing but good vibes.

[16:57] And that's what you wanna be on board for.

[17:00] And then I go over to the X-Men thread

[17:03] and everyone's unhappy.

[17:05] Codes not where it needs to be.

[17:07] There's issues with here and there,

[17:10] auto plungers, play fields, this and that,

[17:13] wire forms, you're like, you gotta build the game

[17:15] after you buy it, you're not happy with it.

[17:18] Now you gotta wait for code

[17:20] to maybe get to where it needs to get to.

[17:22] I don't wanna be in that club right now.

[17:26] I don't wanna be in the X-Men club right now.

[17:28] I don't, it's like people are not really that happy.

[17:31] They're not really that happy.

[17:32] And also like, I don't wanna be in the X-Men club

[17:34] because the club to be in is X-Men Pro.

[17:37] In X-Men Pro is the best game option,

[17:41] and it's half the price of an X-Men Ali.

[17:44] And then I don't wanna buy an X-Men Ali,

[17:47] have all these issues, and know that a dude

[17:50] that paid half as much as me is having more fun.

[17:54] If I'm in the evil dead club,

[17:57] everyone pays the same amount of money.

[17:59] Everyone's got the same pin.

[18:01] There's no class warfare going on.

[18:04] Nobody got a better deal than me.

[18:06] Nobody got a different game than me.

[18:08] Nobody paid, it's like, you're all in the same boat.

[18:12] And it's a happiness boat to be on.

[18:14] So I think that's like awesome.

[18:16] I don't wanna be in the Avatar train or boat.

[18:23] I mean, the Avatar club is dead.

[18:25] It's dead.

[18:26] There's no enthusiasm.

[18:27] Like go to the Avatar Owners club.

[18:30] And it's like, it's like, it's crickets.

[18:35] It's cricket.

[18:36] You take one of the biggest movie properties of all time,

[18:38] and you make a game based on it.

[18:39] And it's crickets.

[18:40] You know why it's crickets?

[18:41] Because the game is soulless.

[18:43] The game's soulless.

[18:44] It doesn't have personality.

[18:45] Where's the personality in Avatar?

[18:47] You hit start in that game.

[18:49] Are you ever gonna hear a call out that makes you laugh?

[18:52] Are you ever gonna hear a call out

[18:54] that makes you wanna call your friend?

[18:57] Oh my gosh, I can't believe what this game just said to me.

[18:59] Are you ever gonna see anything happen mechanically

[19:02] in Avatar?

[19:03] Anything mechanically happened that you haven't seen before.

[19:06] Nothing, there's nothing.

[19:08] There's not a single toy.

[19:09] There's not a single bash toy.

[19:11] There's not a single motorized mech.

[19:15] There's nothing.

[19:16] There's nothing.

[19:17] There's a UV light system that doesn't really work.

[19:19] There's a bunch of wire forms.

[19:21] And there's two lower playfields that are not satisfying.

[19:24] That's it.

[19:25] There's nothing else.

[19:26] There's nothing else to write home about.

[19:30] Look at what's in this game.

[19:32] Look at what's in this game.

[19:33] You've got the bash hand that moves back and forth.

[19:36] You've got two pop-up heads from underneath the playfield.

[19:39] You've got pop-up drop targets

[19:41] that come up from underneath the playfield.

[19:42] You've got a lower playfield.

[19:44] You've got a cabin that locks balls physically

[19:46] that you can see, right?

[19:48] You've got a double barrel shotgun

[19:50] that you load the cartridges and you can shoot

[19:52] a double barrel shotgun from the shooter lane.

[19:54] I mean, just like all of those things,

[19:57] all of those things, add it up.

[19:59] Are awesome, right?

[20:01] And so like, I just think like,

[20:05] you know, the big companies, the big companies

[20:08] have to wake up a little bit.

[20:10] You know, and I've been talking to Stern

[20:11] and they're good guys over there.

[20:13] And they mean really well.

[20:14] It's just, you know, you can't sell people on,

[20:17] it's passion, you can't instill common sense,

[20:23] you know, common sense.

[20:24] Like common sense, if we're gonna make

[20:27] this beautiful Metallica game,

[20:30] are we, is the cherry on top gonna be a crappy topper?

[20:34] Right?

[20:35] Imagine making the most delicious ice cream sundae

[20:38] and you put a rotten cherry on top of it

[20:42] and you say, here you go.

[20:45] Here's your sundae.

[20:46] That's what Stern did with the topper for Metallica.

[20:50] Scarbage, garbage, $1,000?

[20:53] $1,000 for that.

[20:56] For flasher caps and just the logo.

[21:00] Nothing else.

[21:01] No artwork from that incredible artist.

[21:03] No, no sculpts, no nothing, $1,000.

[21:06] That's just like, you know, as much as I want to help Stern

[21:10] and George and Seth and Garrett, like I would love,

[21:13] I would love nothing more.

[21:16] Then to like really help these guys out,

[21:19] I just, I don't even know where to begin

[21:22] because I just think they don't understand

[21:24] the consequences of lazy moves like that.

[21:27] There's no other, because you can't have

[21:30] a tiny little company in Benton, Wisconsin

[21:35] showing you how it's done.

[21:38] You can't have a tiny little company

[21:43] like outperforming you like in a lot of these ways.

[21:47] And like I know that you make more games in a week

[21:51] than spooky pimple makes all year.

[21:55] But that's about the change.

[21:58] I don't mean about the change like volume wise,

[22:01] but who's having more fun?

[22:04] Who's having more success?

[22:06] Who's sleeping better at night?

[22:08] And I think that's the ultimate question.

[22:09] Who's sleeping better at night?

[22:12] I mean, you got all those mouths to feed.

[22:14] You got to get it right.

[22:15] You got to get it right.

[22:17] Look, I love this game.

[22:23] I mean, I didn't see the feature at video

[22:25] when I did my podcast this morning,

[22:26] so I've seen more of the game now.

[22:29] And I absolutely think it's awesome.

[22:31] I think it's a great game.

[22:34] I think it's, you know, looks like it's going to be

[22:36] an easy game to shoot, which is fine with me.

[22:40] I don't like games that are like too difficult.

[22:43] I don't understand that.

[22:44] Make the game hard with the code.

[22:47] You know what I'm saying?

[22:47] A game should be hard to get through

[22:49] because you've coded in a lot of different fun stuff.

[22:52] You have to hit combos, but don't make a game

[22:54] just like drain happy or a brick fest.

[22:59] I don't like, you know, again, I said a lot.

[23:02] It took a lot to meet a lower the post on Guns and Roses,

[23:05] but I had a lower the outlaying post.

[23:07] It just wasn't fun anymore.

[23:08] I was just so tired of like every sling was like throwing

[23:12] the ball into the into the outlames.

[23:16] Lower play field.

[23:23] Yeah, I don't know.

[23:24] Should I get one?

[23:25] No.

[23:26] Well, maybe I sold them.

[23:28] We have a contract in our New York City apartment.

[23:31] So, Canadian's about to back, I'm going to about to be back

[23:35] to being a little bit, hopefully, you know,

[23:37] high on the hog a little bit.

[23:40] Because my monthly payments will be significantly less

[23:45] when I throw my New York City apartment

[23:48] against this mortgage and then knock this mortgage down

[23:50] to hardly anything.

[23:55] So, super happy for these guys.

[23:57] And I don't know what else to say.

[23:58] I mean, I hope you guys join Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[24:02] We've got a great community over there.

[24:05] It's been a lot of fun watching these companies

[24:07] over the years.

[24:08] We're all sort of experts now on these companies.

[24:12] And, you know, I really do think,

[24:15] I really do think we're going to reach a point where

[24:18] it only, you know, we're only going to want to buy a new

[24:21] inbox from companies that bring the passion.

[24:26] And games that are beautiful, but soulless won't work.

[24:31] Games that are beautiful with no mechs won't sell.

[24:36] Games that are based on themes that the designer

[24:38] did not want to make won't be effective.

[24:42] You can't hand people assignments.

[24:45] That doesn't make any sense to me.

[24:47] And I think what spooky's going to show everybody is,

[24:51] you know, there's a level of enthusiasm

[24:53] and there's a level of commitment and responsibility.

[24:57] I think they feel to nail these themes.

[25:02] And I think we're going to see a thinning out

[25:07] of the pinball manufacturers that don't understand that.

[25:12] And, you know, I'm really looking forward

[25:16] to the next couple of years in pinball.

[25:18] I think it's going to be a brutal battle to bring magic back.

[25:26] It's going to be a brutal battle.

[25:27] The charlatans are going to fail.

[25:30] The mediocre pins are going to be worthless

[25:34] because no one's going to want them.

[25:36] You know, when you've got like a mediocre pin

[25:38] and like spooky pinball has mediocre pins.

[25:41] Like no one wants an ultra man now after this.

[25:44] Nobody's going to want your John Wick.

[25:46] Nobody's going to want your venom.

[25:48] Nobody's going to want, you know,

[25:50] filling the game that just kind of didn't hit.

[25:54] Nobody's going to want it, you know, it's hard to aba,

[25:58] you know, it's like, I just think there's like a lot of games

[26:02] out there where, you know, how are you going to sell me

[26:06] on a tank force game for 10 grand or an Elton John for 15?

[26:13] You know, I just, I just come on.

[26:15] $15,000.

[26:18] It's a whole new world.

[26:21] It's a whole new world.

[26:22] And it's a good one.

[26:23] I'm glad we have this option.

[26:25] And thank you guys for all the support.

[26:27] You know, if you're not a member of the Canadian Club by now

[26:30] and you're like new to Pimball, come on.

[26:33] I need help to pay for the fireplace.

[26:35] Like let's look at this thing.

[26:36] I love this.

[26:39] Oh, look at that.

[26:41] Spooky pinball is on fire in Vuego.

[26:48] I think it does work and heats up the house nice.

[26:50] I was like, I was like, it's chilly.

[26:51] Canada was a little chilly.

[26:53] Black Friday, Canadian Club for the cheap pinheads.

[26:58] I mean, I don't know how to get any cheaper guys.

[27:01] I mean, it's like $5 a month.

[27:04] A month.

[27:06] I just went and bought some Dunkin' Donuts coffee.

[27:10] I always use coffee as an example

[27:11] because it's your like one large cup of coffee

[27:14] is more than Canadian Spinball podcasts.

[27:17] I don't know.

[27:18] I don't know.

[27:19] Josh, I don't know what to do anymore.

[27:21] Like I don't know what I don't even know

[27:23] what more I could possibly do.

[27:25] I mean, no one does as much content as me.

[27:28] Nobody is on top of the news with the podcast

[27:32] as fast as I am.

[27:34] Nobody breaks as much news and information

[27:38] and leaks stuff more than Canada.

[27:42] Jason Napp is awesome.

[27:44] He probably does.

[27:46] So don't go running to Jason being like Canada said

[27:49] he breaks more than you.

[27:52] No, Bill Brandis has not joined yet.

[27:54] He doesn't have time.

[27:55] He only has time to hang out every time I go live

[27:57] for like an hour, but he doesn't have time

[27:59] to listen to the podcast.

[28:00] Look, again, it's not even about like listening

[28:04] to the podcast.

[28:04] Just like showing support.

[28:07] What I do love, of course I've watched the bear.

[28:10] What I do love is I've amassed.

[28:15] The most amount of subscribers

[28:17] in the history of pinball podcasting, which is fun.

[28:21] And I think there's a lot of good shows out there.

[28:25] But I think what makes the Canada Club different

[28:28] is we're not a bunch of pushovers.

[28:32] We're not a bunch of shells.

[28:33] Not that everybody is that day.

[28:34] This is just me saying like, I think my community

[28:39] has money.

[28:40] I think they're collectors.

[28:42] I don't think they're tournament players.

[28:44] I think they want to put fun stuff in their house,

[28:47] but I think they want to get what they're paying for.

[28:50] I think we love it when Stern knocks it out of the park.

[28:54] And I think we're embarrassed for Stern when they mail it in.

[28:58] Because Stern has to make three games a year plus like a vault.

[29:02] Stern's problem is consistently having

[29:05] to deliver a hit time and time again.

[29:08] It is their real issue.

[29:10] And Stern's biggest issue is basically burning

[29:14] their old buyers to create new buyers is going

[29:17] to be a huge problem for them.

[29:21] Yeah, I'm pretty much a little bit more expensive than one

[29:24] gallon of 93 octane gas.

[29:29] Canada's fans equals high IQ with disposable income.

[29:32] Yeah, I mean, my fan base is pretty well off.

[29:38] Probably most of you are well, more well off than I am.

[29:41] But you know what it is again, gang?

[29:42] I look at life and the wood it could have shut

[29:46] of is of how we all could have made more money.

[29:48] To me, it's not just about that.

[29:50] It's about how enjoyable is every day.

[29:53] And as long as you're not struggling

[29:55] and you have some peace of mind and you have your health

[29:58] and your happiness, I think you're doing pretty damn well

[30:02] in a world in which most people are poor.

[30:06] Most people are living in conflict regions of the world.

[30:12] Most people don't have opportunities.

[30:15] America's a beautiful country too.

[30:17] I've seen a lot of anti-American rhetoric.

[30:20] Ellen DeGeneres wants to go live in Europe.

[30:23] Good, don't let the door hit you on the way out.

[30:25] What are like these losers who make all of their fortune

[30:30] with the opportunities of America.

[30:33] And the second they don't get their way,

[30:35] they turn their back on America.

[30:37] Like get the F ad here.

[30:39] Like I'm sorry, but that stuff just,

[30:41] all these losers' celebrities that want to leave now,

[30:45] go ahead, go ahead.

[30:47] You never would have become who you are

[30:49] if you were anywhere else.

[30:52] So yeah, so interesting times.

[30:57] The Jaguar decided to blow themselves up.

[31:02] Bud lights finally moving back to some good advertising.

[31:07] And I want to say this over the last couple of weeks, right?

[31:11] Post-election.

[31:13] I want to say thank you to everybody

[31:15] who's had constructive conversations around it

[31:19] and hasn't lost their cool.

[31:22] I also want to say how disappointed I am in the fact

[31:27] that basically my best friend in Pimball

[31:30] hasn't talked to me since the election.

[31:33] Hasn't talked to me once.

[31:35] He's basically because I didn't vote

[31:39] the way he wanted me to vote.

[31:41] And didn't even care to hear my reasons why.

[31:44] He's stopped talking to me.

[31:46] And this is someone I talk to every single day.

[31:49] So to me, that's the real danger

[31:52] in what politics has done to people

[31:55] is they've made it so black and white, you know?

[31:58] And in the end, like I'm,

[32:01] I was gonna be fine either way.

[32:03] Like I don't really care who wins.

[32:06] No, Greg Colton is awesome.

[32:08] Let me tell you something.

[32:08] Greg Colton, rare hero,

[32:10] who I also talk to pretty much every day.

[32:13] He's like, Greg is like the greatest liberal moderate,

[32:19] like normal dude with common sense imaginable.

[32:25] So I love Greg.

[32:27] He is not, he was trying to talk some sense

[32:30] into my friend.

[32:30] And that was my friend Derek, you know?

[32:32] They'll say like, you know, Derek, if you want to ghost me

[32:36] and it's pained you so much

[32:39] that your best buddy that has been nothing

[32:43] but kind and gracious to you

[32:46] just doesn't align with your vote.

[32:51] I'm saddened that you think

[32:54] that now I'm a bad person,

[32:55] that everybody who didn't vote like you is a Nazi

[33:00] and a monster, he called those monsters.

[33:02] Anyone who voted is a monster.

[33:05] So I shared a picture of me and my family.

[33:07] I said, look at these, look at these monsters.

[33:11] Look at us just because we might want

[33:15] a little bit more for our family,

[33:17] a little bit more safety for our kids,

[33:19] a little bit more this, a little bit less that.

[33:24] You know, not everybody votes the same way,

[33:26] not everybody has the same issues.

[33:29] So anyway, that's why I love Pimball

[33:31] because at least it's a topic we can talk about

[33:34] where it doesn't lead to people.

[33:37] I mean, people do get angry and fight,

[33:40] in the DMs on Pimball and stop talking to each other

[33:44] but I would never stop being friends with anybody I love

[33:48] because of some way they lean politically.

[33:51] And I think that's a,

[33:54] you know, I think love needs to override, you know,

[33:58] pettiness.

[34:00] I mean that and especially, especially,

[34:03] and I mean this when I say this,

[34:06] people who don't have children, who are adults,

[34:11] you have no idea, you'll never know what it's like

[34:16] to have to live for somebody else,

[34:19] to have to sacrifice things you might want for somebody else.

[34:23] You'll never understand what really thinking about the future

[34:29] means when the future means more than you.

[34:33] And you know, it's real easy to like,

[34:37] to only think about yourself,

[34:38] your biggest concern is where you're gonna vacation next,

[34:42] you know, what new car you're gonna get,

[34:44] what meal you're gonna go have.

[34:47] Yeah, enjoy all that

[34:49] because you'll never know what it's like

[34:51] to look at young children and need to figure out

[34:56] how do you pay for daycare, how do you get them educated,

[34:58] how do you prevent them from falling into the rabbit holes

[35:03] of social media,

[35:05] and you just want a better life for them.

[35:09] And yeah, I'm just gonna say it,

[35:12] you wanna put more money away for your family,

[35:16] like these socialists, like get out of town,

[35:19] want to attack everyone who's worked hard for their money

[35:23] and do what?

[35:24] Build bigger government programs that have failed time and time again,

[35:29] increase the estate tax, increase the capital gains tax,

[35:33] and then launch crap like unrealized gain taxes,

[35:37] unrealized gains.

[35:40] Okay, then force, force, you know,

[35:44] women's sports to have to like compromise

[35:48] who they're playing against and it's stupid, stupid.

[35:52] I'm very socially liberal, trust me,

[35:54] I'm the most socially liberal person you'll meet.

[35:57] Anyway, I always go off in these tangents lately

[35:59] because I've been bottling it up inside for so many years

[36:03] and I'm just tired of it all.

[36:05] I literally am tired of it all,

[36:08] I'm not allowed to say how I feel.

[36:11] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[36:12] Like have you noticed that vibe in America?

[36:15] Have you noticed how all of a sudden now,

[36:18] I'm not a mega how-wearing radical, like I'm not.

[36:23] But I'm tired of always for the last 11, 12 years,

[36:28] I can never express how I feel at my job,

[36:34] I can never express how I feel in meetings,

[36:36] I can never, like no one's, I can never tell anybody,

[36:40] well actually I'm a guy, I'm a male in the demographic,

[36:45] I don't think like that.

[36:48] Like maybe I don't wanna have everything I love,

[36:52] like altered to include everybody, right?

[36:55] Maybe there's just Star Wars fans that skew more,

[37:00] male and older and maybe that's okay.

[37:04] Like everything doesn't have to be for everybody.

[37:07] And I've watched so much stuff, so much stuff,

[37:12] just be like destroyed by people

[37:15] who don't even care about those things.

[37:19] All they care about is jamming down our throats,

[37:23] their agenda and their social initiatives,

[37:27] and what they are really trying to do is 100% destroy

[37:33] so many institutions and so many things

[37:37] that have brought people so much joy

[37:39] because it didn't bring joy to them.

[37:43] And they don't care, they're not Star Wars fans,

[37:47] they're not video game players.

[37:50] Why all of a sudden do you need to jam in to every single thing

[37:56] and you need to represent everybody in everything?

[38:00] So what, so Killian has to go watch Paw Patrol

[38:04] and you're gonna have some non-binary dog

[38:07] whatever the hell that means.

[38:08] So then he has to then be confused

[38:10] about what is going on here.

[38:12] And then the dogs don't even identify themselves as dogs,

[38:15] they can identify themselves as any furry creature.

[38:21] No, no, dogs or dogs, boys will be boys.

[38:26] It's okay if boys, like attractive women,

[38:31] we don't all have to have blue hair

[38:33] and be angry at the world, we don't have to.

[38:37] Anyway, everybody, my channel, again,

[38:41] you'll never find someone with more friends that are diverse,

[38:46] I respect and love everybody for their differences.

[38:50] But I also think there's something to be said

[38:53] about authenticity and being who you are

[38:57] and not always having to apologize for being a boy,

[39:02] a man that has urges that men have

[39:05] and considers these things to be attractive

[39:09] and those things to be unattractive, right?

[39:11] Everybody's beautiful, everybody's in shape,

[39:15] everybody's sexy, everybody, get out of here.

[39:19] I work really hard to be in shape.

[39:22] You know what I'm saying is like,

[39:25] yeah, you could put an out of shape guy

[39:26] on the cover of men's fitness, why?

[39:29] Cause he's mentally fit.

[39:31] Everyone's got mental health issues now, everybody, everybody.

[39:35] If you don't wanna go to work,

[39:36] you can take a mental health day now.

[39:38] Sure, okay, cool, cool.

[39:42] Cool, you know, I used to have to go in,

[39:44] we did the job, we did job sucked.

[39:46] I spent the first few years of my career

[39:48] at a photocopy machine.

[39:49] It wasn't fun.

[39:51] It couldn't take a mental health day.

[39:52] We were strolled in, hung over from the club

[39:55] from the night before, spent my entire salary

[39:57] on bottle service at Marquay and Crowbar,

[40:01] had sparklers coming out with $400 bottles of gray goose,

[40:05] never, never once went home with a woman, never got lucky.

[40:09] But we kept doing it, somehow we thought

[40:12] something was gonna happen, nothing ever did.

[40:15] We just lost all our money.

[40:17] But we had fun, we had fun, we'd wake up,

[40:20] we'd go to like a deli or diner at like six in the morning

[40:23] and then be at work by nine o'clock, hung over,

[40:26] still drunk from the night before.

[40:29] I haven't seen anybody, no one comes in to work like that

[40:31] anymore, nobody, nobody's like struggling,

[40:33] they just don't come in.

[40:35] They don't come in.

[40:37] Anyway, Franchie, great job on the artwork.

[40:40] Getting, I got, this was my lunch break,

[40:41] I decided to talk to all of you.

[40:46] My phone's ringing, all right, love you guys, be good.
