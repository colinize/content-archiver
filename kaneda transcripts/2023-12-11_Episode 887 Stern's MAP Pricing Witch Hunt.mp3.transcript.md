[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canadi's Pinball Podcast.

[00:16] Happy Monday!

[00:18] We're going to talk all about pinball.

[00:20] Is Stern Pinball scared?

[00:21] Going after people selling games for $200 below what they want you to sell a used pro machine

[00:28] for?

[00:29] to talk about that. We got Texas Chainsaw Gameplay footage. We're going to talk about

[00:34] that. We're going to talk about where these other pinball machines go now. That jaws is

[00:39] just around the corner. I'm hearing it's going to be at CES, which is January 9th. It's going

[00:45] to happen. And I just want to say thank you to everybody who's a member of this show.

[00:50] Only if you were on Mars or the moon last week did you miss another attempt to make

[00:55] everybody that's a member of this show be ashamed for joining Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:01] And I want to say this, look, eight pages of people talking about this show and they wonder

[01:06] why I work in marketing. We've got everybody talking about Canada and the Twippies went

[01:12] and canceled themselves. And speaking of people who follow this show, it's been a while since

[01:17] I gave a shout out to everyone who's raised the roof and raised their membership pledges.

[01:22] So let's do that first on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast. I want to give a

[01:25] shout out. I'm going to tell you what these guys are raising it to, man. Andrew G who

[01:29] raised his to $80.50. I think that's Australian dollars. Josh K who raised it from five to

[01:36] ten. I want to give a shout out to Tony V who's part of the Omokase Club. Tony raised

[01:42] his from five to 30. Herk Bubba raised his from five to ten. I want to give a shout out

[01:46] to Darren who's all the way up to $15. I think that's Canadian dollars maybe. I want to give

[01:52] a shout out to Gobble Hole. I love my fans. Gobble Hole who also edited their membership

[01:57] to $14.50. I think that's Canadian as well. A huge shout out to Eric Pearson who joined

[02:02] the Omokase Club. He went all the way from five to $30. And I want to give a shout out

[02:07] to Fubir who went from five to ten dollars. I love that Pinside is so mad at me and they're

[02:12] like everyone who subscribes should be ashamed of themselves. And I'm like are you really

[02:16] saying that Fubir should be ashamed that he raised the roof from five to ten dollars.

[02:21] Everybody welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast. Let's get right to it. So let's talk about

[02:26] what I think is something we already know. We all know the fact that Stern Pinball is terrified.

[02:33] They're terrified that the true market value of the product they make will see the light of

[02:41] the day in the world of pinball. You have to understand what Stern does. They operate like

[02:45] the mafia. They control the price of their products. Even after you buy it, they control the product.

[02:54] Think about it. A dealer and a distro. They buy the game from Stern Pinball for a certain amount

[03:01] of money. Let's just use an example. If they buy Venom Limited Edition from Stern Pinball

[03:08] for ten thousand dollars, they have to write a check to get one Venom LE. This is before they

[03:14] know if the game is any good. This is before they know if there's even market demand for the game.

[03:20] And so when that dealer or distro buys that game, they don't even own the ability to price that game

[03:27] where they want to price it based on the market demand of the product. And so let's say they buy

[03:34] ten Venom LEs. That's one hundred thousand dollars in money. They have handed Stern Pinball and Stern

[03:42] Pinball still has ultimate power over them, over that investment, and over that inventory. And so

[03:49] then what happens when Venom LE has no demand because people don't want the game? Stern is telling

[03:55] this distributor, you're not allowed to sell this thing for less money, new in box, than thirteen

[04:03] thousand dollars. I think the map pricing, which is the ultimate lowest they can go on a Venom

[04:08] LE, would be something like twelve thousand seven hundred dollars. Maybe twelve five. I think that

[04:14] might be the cheapest. And that's why we always see some distributors free shipping ladies and

[04:19] gentlemen because giving that shipping to you free is what hits the map pricing for those

[04:24] distributors or dealers. Okay, so they can sell you a game and make ostensibly twenty five hundred

[04:30] dollars on top of what they paid Stern for the machine. But then what happens when you start

[04:36] seeing Venom LEs unboxed selling for nine thousand dollars? So instantly all of those games you own

[04:44] in a box are immediately underwater financially because the second hand market is indicating

[04:50] that nobody is ever going to buy this game now for twelve five when they can save themselves almost

[04:56] three thousand dollars and just buy it on the second hand market. But Stern will not allow you to

[05:02] sell it below map pricing. What we saw this weekend in this interaction was really eye opening for a

[05:08] lot of reasons. Probably the biggest reason why is that Stern would even go after a guy that's trying

[05:14] to sell a new in box Stern Pro for simply two hundred dollars less than Stern would like them to

[05:22] sell the game for. So you're telling me Stern pinball goes on a witch hunt and then put stuff in

[05:29] writing that they never should have put in writing because they want to stop a guy who bought a game

[05:34] who's not even a dealer for less than he paid for it. Doesn't this start to feel like Stern pinball

[05:41] is getting really nervous that they're feeling some pressure that they would go after a guy for

[05:48] like a hundred and ninety nine dollar issue. A hundred and ninety nine dollars when Stern pinball

[05:54] knows they're selling us toppers for two thousand dollars in which the bomb is probably like three

[06:00] hundred bucks on those toppers. I think we're starting to witness that a lot is happening behind

[06:07] the scenes in the pinball world that has both the manufacturers and the distributors very nervous.

[06:14] We're starting to see inventory pile up. They price these games at a certain point that was

[06:20] reflective of what the demand was during covid and now that that demand is no longer what it

[06:26] used to be the prices have not changed yet the supply has gone through the roof. So how can this

[06:34] pinball marketplace really survive much longer if you're going to increase supply increase the price

[06:42] of the product as demand for the product starts to go down. And then we get stuff like this where

[06:50] you see now right you normally don't get to look behind the curtain you don't get to peek behind

[06:55] the curtain because no distributor will ever be honest with us because Stern pinball and George

[07:01] Gomez will never be honest with us. But now we see what's going on and what makes this story also

[07:07] very interesting is that none of this would have happened unless a dealer did not get upset by seeing

[07:14] this gentleman trying to sell his game for less than the dealers allowed to sell it for. And the

[07:19] other thing we're starting to see more and more of have you noticed this right there are some

[07:24] distributors out there and dealers out there that make pinball content. And then I think it's

[07:28] ridiculous that for them to sell a game at the market value and I'm on the side of the distro

[07:34] here like you made me buy this game and the demand for it is not there and I can't sell it for a

[07:40] competitive price because you have your map pricing BS. And so then what these people have to do they

[07:47] have to like unbox it do a streaming of the game and then sell it as a low play version of the game

[07:53] that's been unboxed. And the moment they unbox it then they're allowed to sell it for the use market

[07:59] value. But I also want to call out something that's total BS as well because we've seen distributors

[08:05] especially during COVID they're not allowed to sell below map pricing but they sure as heck are

[08:11] allowed to sell over map pricing. Stern doesn't seem to care about that. Remember when distros were

[08:17] all of a sudden listing Godzilla LEs for like 18, 19 thousand dollars. Why didn't Stern put a stop to

[08:25] that? This is why I don't like Stern's marketing right now. They're absolutely trying to manipulate

[08:30] the markets where it only is in favor of them. It's not in favor of us the customer. We should be able

[08:37] to buy a used Venom LE in a box for the true market value. This hobby has changed significantly over

[08:46] the years now. It is now going to be more like automotive industry where a used car that's a

[08:52] year old even if there's no miles on it it's last year's model and people don't want it you should

[08:59] be able to get it for a steal from the dealership itself. And why do you think they're called Stern

[09:05] dealers? They are dealerships. They are a dealer that will ship to you a pinball machine. And so a

[09:12] year after Venom LE comes out how much do you think a Venom LE a year from now will be worth new in

[09:19] box? It will be worth like 8,500 dollars new in box. Everybody knows that. So imagine you're a dealer

[09:27] sitting on a Venom LE. You're never allowed to sell it below map pricing. And so all this does is it

[09:35] creates really shady behavior behind the scenes. Dealers selling these things for cash just throwing

[09:41] them in the back of pickup trucks. You know all these people the good old boys that canada goes

[09:46] after the good old deals that are being had by all the different dealers. I've never had that

[09:50] experience. I've never had a dealer say hey you can get a thousand off or two thousand off just take

[09:55] this game off my hands. But that's what's going on. And that's why I don't like all of this. And that's

[10:01] why I think this hobby is in for a rude awakening. And I think 2024 is going to be a year of price

[10:07] reckoning for all of these companies. Stern's not going to be able to control this for much longer

[10:14] because the games are too expensive now. These distros are spending too much money on these

[10:19] games that aren't moving out the door quick enough. And now we know. Now we know they're nervous.

[10:25] Now we know they're personally going to come after people for 200 dollars. Are we just supposed to

[10:31] forget that like Stern like released Elvira 40th had people call for price and allowed dealers to

[10:38] charge $25,000 for that game. We're just supposed to forget they did that. That they approved of that

[10:46] business practice. And then they went and screwed over everybody who bought that game by offering a

[10:52] nicer edition of the game for $13,000. We're all supposed to just forget that even happened. You

[10:59] know. And that's why like canada spin ball podcast people you know when people try to say like why

[11:03] do people listen to him. Why does he like even have a following. Why do all these people subscribe.

[11:08] Because I don't hear on any other shows anybody raising a stink about these business practices.

[11:15] And you know why because they're all feeding up towards these companies. They're all feeding up

[11:21] their content to be in good graces with the business practices of these companies because they want to

[11:27] land the interviews because they're getting money off on every machine they buy if they say positive

[11:33] things about these companies. But I think it's gone too far in the end though I ultimately have

[11:39] empathy for these dealers and distros because as Stern cranks up the supply at these prices and forces

[11:47] all of these distros to absorb every one of their decisions and every one of their games. And it's

[11:52] all fear based like if we don't take these games we're not going to get jaws. We're not going to

[11:58] get the Keith Elwin machine. So I've got to absorb every Brian Eddy game even if people don't want it

[12:04] so I can get to the one hit game a year. The only way Stern's model is going to work is if each game

[12:11] is a banger because for every soft title that's going to eat away all the profits from the hit games.

[12:17] And you're not going to be able to survive anymore just cranking out endless premiums of Godzilla

[12:22] and Stranger Things and all the old titles and you know they're going to make more Metallica next.

[12:28] I mean if you own a Metallica get ready it's coming back with a Spike 3 system with an LCD screen

[12:35] and then everybody who owns a Metallica which is like 5,000 people out there. Then what are you all

[12:41] going to do now? You're all going to want to dump your Metallicas and now we're going to have an

[12:44] oversaturation of Metallicas in the pinball world. And I just don't like this practice by Stern

[12:50] because they're just going to oversaturate every single thing that made them special,

[12:55] that made their games collectible and also just like oversaturate with the same themes over and

[13:00] over and over again. It would be nice if like a theme came out, if it was great, it had a good run

[13:06] and that's it. Imagine walking by a movie theater and they just keep bringing out movies that were

[13:11] great over and over and over again. Like every summer we're going to re-release Maverick just

[13:16] because we know people like it. No, it starts to oversaturate your product, it oversaturates your

[13:21] industry. You know and it telegraphs to your consumer, you can't sleep at night feeling like you

[13:26] have got something special, you bought something in a moment and you get to enjoy it and it's not

[13:32] going to come back around again. Like you can just go to bed at night knowing that your collection

[13:36] is not going to see your Metallica LE get trumped in a couple months because Stern Pinball

[13:42] can't just move forward. They got to go back and get greedy and remake and remake and remake and

[13:47] remake and oversupply the entire industry. Alright, well speaking about not oversupplying the entire

[13:53] industry, let's talk about the Spooky Pinball. Texas Chainsaw Massacre Stream. I just saw it this

[13:58] morning. It was about a half hour video of Bug playing the game. Did anyone else find it a little

[14:04] bit sketchy that all of a sudden we get gameplay footage? Like they announced the game on Wednesday,

[14:10] they revealed the full game on Friday, they took money on Friday for the game and they couldn't do

[14:16] this in preparation the day in which the order banks open. Just a little weird, I just noticed

[14:22] that like really you got approval for this game like in three days or you added enough to make it

[14:27] worth showing in three days. You know I think all these companies are still trying to sell on theme

[14:32] alone and we'll just reveal it. We won't show you gameplay, let's get as much money through the door

[14:37] based on theme alone. Now after watching about 20 minutes of this stream, I will say this clearly

[14:44] looks like the best shooting Spooky game to date and it just looks like a good shooting pinball

[14:48] machine in general. Like it looks like it has a lot of flow, it looks like a lot of fun to flip,

[14:53] it doesn't look like a brick fest, there's a lot of combos, there's a lot of orbits, there's a lot

[14:57] of upper flipper action, there's a lot of cool stuff happening with the lights and the modes in this

[15:02] game. I like story driven mode based pinball machines and if you love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre

[15:09] I mean you have to get this game. I mean that's what it comes down to. Now the only thing is this,

[15:14] are there 888 people out there who can put a horror themed movie into your home and that's my

[15:22] thing is like this is such an easy pass of a game for people that don't like the theme. This is not a

[15:27] theme that you're gonna warm up to, it's not like Rush Music or Iron Maiden Music, like this is hard

[15:33] core, like you need to really be a horror fanatic. This is a very morbid and disturbing film and I'm

[15:41] a little bit worried that you know I would love to have this layout on a game like Rick and Morty.

[15:47] I would have loved Scooby Doo to have shot this well. See this is the thing now, did you see

[15:52] Scooby Doo Collectors Editions with a butter cabinet are now selling for $7,500. That game a year ago

[16:01] if you ordered it like that and you had to pay tax and shipping on that game you're looking at a

[16:06] $5,000 loss on a Scooby Doo with butter cabinet in just a single year. I mean look I keep saying

[16:15] wait and see and I wouldn't keep saying it if the data and the numbers weren't in the favor of what

[16:22] I'm saying because it's true everybody. You know I was just talking to a distributor too and he said

[16:27] to me well that's funny because I just sold three new and box Scooby Doo's last week for MSRP and

[16:33] it also goes to show you that maybe the majority of people who buy pinball machines they're not on

[16:40] pinside. They're not following Canadian pinball podcast. The majority of sales just come from

[16:46] random people who buy pinball machines and that's why these distributors and these dealers you ever

[16:51] wonder why it feels like they're just spamming us to no end on Facebook. The reason why they're

[16:57] spamming Facebook every single day it's not because they want to annoy us it's because they're just

[17:02] trying to catch some newbie who doesn't have any idea what's going on and catch them in some sort

[17:08] of algorithm where some guy who's got some money maybe he's a dentist maybe he's a lawyer maybe

[17:13] he's just I don't know some random dude out there is like oh look honey a Scooby Doo pinball machine

[17:18] oh yeah maybe we just get it with everything all the options and he writes a check for 12.5 and he

[17:22] has no idea that on pinside he could get the same exact game for $7,500 and that's why they spam

[17:31] social media they're not going after us. It does beg an interesting question are we all living in

[17:37] some sort of pinball echo chamber you know when we complain about prices we complain about themes

[17:43] we complain about this and that I think we all have to admit we're all in a little bit of an

[17:49] echo chamber like this is the canado echo chamber I think this is the most fun echo chamber to be

[17:53] in but it is an echo chamber so is pinside so are the other pinball podcasts and their fan bases

[18:00] everyone's inside their own little room like imagine if this whole industry was like a karaoke bar

[18:05] and everyone's in their room singing their tunes like I sing my tune which is wait and see in some

[18:11] other room they're singing bye bye bye in some other room they're singing let's destroy the

[18:15] Twippies and remove the content creator categories in some other rooms turn pinball saying how dare

[18:21] you try to lower prices or we're gonna take away your dealer and distributor badges I mean we're

[18:27] all singing different tunes the only difference is is certain people are getting very wealthy in

[18:32] those rooms and other people are making nothing and I think that's where this hobby is at right now

[18:37] you know ultimately what we all want is to sing the same tune and the tune we all want to sing

[18:42] is this game is magical this game is amazing I see the value in this game I can't believe the

[18:49] creativity the theme integration the mechanical magic and the world under glass this machine

[18:54] brings to the world that's what we all want to sing you know we get really divided in pinball

[19:00] when something happens and I'll tell you what it is we get really divided when we're not satisfied

[19:05] with the products because when the products don't deliver that's when we focus on the price when we

[19:10] know these things aren't what we really want and we know the creativity isn't there and then we see

[19:15] this big price tag that's when we become cranky that's when we become annoyed and that's when

[19:21] everyone gets defensive and that's when the battles begin you know the dealers and the distros

[19:26] they need to defend these products even if they know they're not good I mean I've been having

[19:30] dealers tell me Elton John is just dead on arrival like nobody's ordering Elton John more people

[19:36] have ordered Looney Tunes and Texas chainsaw massacre than Elton John pinball right now

[19:42] and that's sad it really is sad it's like a Jersey Jack machine that is a more universal theme like

[19:48] Elton John is gonna lose out to Bugs Bunny a leather-faced maniac with a chainsaw is gonna

[19:55] beat out a guy that sold almost 400 million albums worldwide and that's where we're at you know it's

[20:01] like what's next for Jersey Jack what happens now when Elton John sales don't turn on what happens

[20:07] when galactic tank force sales don't come back to American pinball don't come back they weren't

[20:12] even there in the first place so right now we're at a period where I think Jaws is gonna crush it

[20:17] we're gonna see it January 9th at CES which means I think they might reveal it to the world

[20:23] sooner than that or they might hold back and release it on that Tuesday at CES but it's close

[20:30] everybody it's close like we're two to three weeks away from the next Keith Elwyn machine that's

[20:35] exciting but I don't know about you but I'm gonna spend my holidays spending money on friends and

[20:41] family and experiences that's the most important thing the days of like feeling good about buying

[20:48] every single game that comes out I don't know those days are gone for me maybe not for you

[20:54] but our expectations have to be sky high with prices being this high and nothing's exclusive I mean

[21:00] I've never seen games lose more money than they have over the last two years and I don't believe it

[21:07] when distros say sales are great I don't believe it when these companies say they had to raise prices

[21:13] to this point I don't believe them I believe in us and our ability to use our eyes and our common sense

[21:20] if you're gonna tell me something's 13 grand or 15 grand then I should look down at that game and it

[21:26] should have a lot more in it than what games just three years ago had in them like where is the huge

[21:32] jump 40% more expensive most of these games are than they were just a few years ago I'm not making

[21:38] 40% more money look I have to buy a house so the real estate market can go up 40% and I have no choice

[21:45] but I do have a choice not to buy a Rolex not to buy a pinball machine you know not to go out and eat

[21:52] fancy dinners I don't need and I think that's what we're gonna see in 2024 more and more people saying

[21:58] I don't need another one at this price and if I just wait I'll be able to get everything for less I

[22:05] even think now you know seeing the market and seeing how stern is behaving I even think you're

[22:09] going to be able to get Jaws LE for less than $13,000 like a few months after it's out it's just the

[22:15] way it is people because again I just don't think we're going to see like that much difference from

[22:20] an LE to a premium and with a thousand LE's there's just so many out there and you know and unless

[22:26] they do something truly that separates the LE I don't see the point anymore I really don't like

[22:32] they're just not scarce all right everybody have a great Monday we will be back with more shows this
