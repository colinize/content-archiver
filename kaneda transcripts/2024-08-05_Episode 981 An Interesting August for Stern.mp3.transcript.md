[00:14] Ah, happy Monday morning everybody. Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:19] On this episode, I'm going to reward all like 696 of you with some exclusive information.

[00:28] It's just going to shake up the entire debate around what's next from Stern Pinball,

[00:33] and it does feel like Stern Pinball is coming out with a cornerstone game sooner than they wanted to.

[00:40] We all know the reason why John Wick has been an abysmal failure for this major pinball company.

[00:48] They did not expect such weak sales from that game.

[00:51] So we're going to do that in just a little bit.

[00:53] Let's talk about what else is going on in pinball right now.

[00:57] We have the pinball brothers Abba is now shipping. It is on the line.

[01:03] And I don't know about you, but doesn't it feel like Abba was announced so long ago

[01:09] that finally seeing these games going into boxes just does not excite me.

[01:15] And I'm not really sure who would even order this game.

[01:20] It does feel like a very forgettable game.

[01:24] Doesn't it feel like a lot of what's been happening in pinball around the big companies,

[01:30] you know, around the companies like Stern, around the companies like JJP,

[01:35] I'll put spooky up there, I'll put barrels of fun up there.

[01:39] All the other boutique companies that have been competing for your space and for your money,

[01:45] it feels like the stuff they've been releasing is just so easily forgettable.

[01:52] And I mean that like Abba, if this game never came out, would you even care?

[01:57] No, if it never surface, nobody would even care.

[02:00] It doesn't feel like we wanted it.

[02:03] It doesn't feel like we're going to miss it.

[02:06] And when you look at the price point of Abba and you look at the artwork

[02:11] and the lack of magic in the game, it's an easy pass for almost all of you.

[02:17] And then you look at a game like Fun House Remake.

[02:20] That's another game that is out right now from Pedretti Gaming.

[02:25] And it's another game where it's like if a remake of Fun House did not happen,

[02:30] would anybody really care?

[02:32] And I think we just have a series of these kind of easily forgettable games

[02:38] that are just going to come and go.

[02:40] They're not going to find their way into your game room.

[02:42] You're not going to sell something you love to make room for these games.

[02:46] And it really does like just beg the question,

[02:50] how come all these pinball companies are getting it wrong?

[02:54] Like what are they doing?

[02:56] Like how hard is it to actually do the market research and land on something

[03:02] that you know will be received with a lot more enthusiasm?

[03:06] Just think about it.

[03:07] Like if I'm a marketer and I am a marketer,

[03:09] if I'm going to go down a road to make a pinball machine,

[03:13] bring a pinball machine into the world,

[03:16] I absolutely would make sure I nail it so that selling a thousand of them is easy.

[03:22] Like there should be more than a thousand people who are waiting to give you their money

[03:27] because you made something that they really want.

[03:30] I mean they can't even sell a thousand labyrinth machines,

[03:33] let alone ABBA, let alone Fun House,

[03:37] let alone like Ninja Eclipse.

[03:39] It's just so weird to me.

[03:41] The amount of getting it wrong, that happens in pinball.

[03:46] And I think I speak for all of us when I say,

[03:49] we all want to see great magical games come to market

[03:53] and it's not like we're against original IP stuff.

[03:58] But if you're going to go down the original IP road like Ninja Eclipse,

[04:03] you kind of have to do something that's never been done before

[04:07] or you have to really load up on the magic, on the mechs, on the stuff

[04:12] because you're not spending any money on the IP.

[04:15] Now speaking of loading up on the stuff,

[04:17] I know there's a lot of exciting stuff that's going to happen

[04:21] in Dutch pinball exes, Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[04:26] I have spoken to Melvin because I saw Carrie Hardy saw the game

[04:30] and he's like hyping it and I'm like, wait a minute,

[04:32] I haven't seen the game and Melvin said that Carrie signed an NDA.

[04:36] So I am hopefully going to sign an NDA today or early this week

[04:42] so I can also see the game and talk to you about it.

[04:46] Now, today, this Monday, you're going to see an image of this game

[04:50] on Dutch pinball exes Facebook page.

[04:52] So look out for that.

[04:54] And then next week,

[04:56] Kaneda is going to get an exclusive image to share with each and every one of you

[05:00] because remember this game is coming out September, October.

[05:03] So it is August.

[05:04] So they're moving towards launch.

[05:07] They are getting ready for launch.

[05:09] The timeframe I heard about this game is they're going to reveal it

[05:13] and then the game is going to be on the line in a couple months.

[05:17] Now, I also know from Melvin,

[05:19] he's not going to do this non-refundable shenanigans.

[05:23] So that's good news.

[05:25] I think he's seen what's happened in the hobby

[05:28] and he obviously does not want to go down a similar road

[05:31] where people are giving money

[05:33] and then they're waiting forever and they're disappointed.

[05:36] So that's good news for the people waiting for this game.

[05:40] All right.

[05:40] So what else is going on in pinball?

[05:42] All right.

[05:43] So you know,

[05:43] it's crazy about this whole haggis situation is I keep getting sent more

[05:48] documentation about what's happening between the creditors

[05:52] and it still boggles my mind that the person owed the most money.

[05:56] This is what makes no sense.

[05:58] The person owed the most money is Damien.

[06:01] Like he's down there.

[06:03] Him and Hardsko are owed a million Australian dollars.

[06:07] How is he owed the most amount of money?

[06:10] And the other really interesting thing is everybody who ordered a game from him,

[06:15] their home address is now all throughout this documentation.

[06:20] So you can actually go and see where everybody lives.

[06:25] Like that's a lot of privacy that is now out there in the world

[06:29] that these gentlemen probably wish was not public.

[06:33] I haven't done it yet,

[06:34] but part of these just curious to see how much money these individuals had to throw

[06:40] like 17,500 dollars in full for Centaur because you can see who paid for the Centaur in full

[06:48] and then their home addresses.

[06:49] So I don't know.

[06:50] Maybe these guys are so rich and they live in these like 8,000 square foot homes

[06:55] that losing $18,000 on a pipe dream, Rob Peter to pay Paul game is no big deal to them.

[07:03] Truthfully, it sucks.

[07:04] It sucks that there's all these victims and I still have not heard from anybody with any reliability

[07:10] what Ryan C. does for a living.

[07:14] Someone said he works on a mining rig.

[07:16] I don't believe that.

[07:18] So how is it that nobody knows what Ryan C. does for a living?

[07:23] What we do know is now he's sickened by the people who have lost money on his boy Marty's company.

[07:30] And I know everyone's like wondering, are we going to hear from Damien and Marty?

[07:34] Are they going to say something?

[07:35] Are they going to ask for forgiveness?

[07:37] I don't think you're ever going to hear from them.

[07:39] I think Marty will try to weasel his way back into the hobby and I don't think the community will let him back in.

[07:47] All right.

[07:48] So what else is going on in pinball on this Monday morning?

[07:51] Canada's pinball podcast always gives you more news in a short period of time.

[07:56] You don't have to listen to these long shows.

[07:58] All right.

[07:59] I'm going to tell you right now what you need to know about Stern's next game.

[08:02] And I want to discuss this because it's really, really going to be an interesting August for Stern.

[08:09] This company is sort of at a crossroads.

[08:13] It's not used to this marketplace.

[08:15] It's not like Stern pinball had the golden goose.

[08:18] Every single Stern launched, they sold out of the L.E.s.

[08:22] There was a waitlist to get on an L.E. list with a distributor and they had the hotness, right?

[08:28] Every new game, there was so much excitement and enthusiasm whenever Stern launched a game.

[08:34] Those days are over.

[08:35] Like they're absolutely over.

[08:38] They're gone.

[08:39] The entire company has been priced as if we are still living in the COVID feeding frenzy madness and it's not working out for them.

[08:48] And now we have like two years of market data and information that shows us if you go in early on these Stern L.E.s.

[08:58] You're going to lose not just a little bit of money, a lot of money.

[09:01] And not only that, they also got just destroyed with this John Wick launch.

[09:06] Like nobody wants it.

[09:07] Like it is just a sinking ship that again, I think a John Wick L.E. will be like an $8,000 game by the end of the year.

[09:16] And so do you want to lose $5,000 just to show your support for a company that is seemingly priced at a pretty greedy level if you ask me?

[09:26] So here's what I'm going to tell you right now.

[09:28] And you haven't heard this anywhere else.

[09:30] And it's just like, I'm not going to tell you everything, but it's going to lead to some speculation.

[09:33] So I'm here to tell you right now.

[09:34] Stern's next game is not X-Men 97.

[09:39] They are not releasing a pinball machine based on the new popular X-Men 97 show that is on Disney Plus.

[09:47] So you can run to pinside.

[09:49] You could tell my boy Jason Knapp.

[09:51] You can go report it on pinball enthusiasts on Facebook where Canada is BAM.

[09:56] That Canada is 100% confirming that it is not X-Men 97.

[10:02] But I will tell you this.

[10:03] They are going to make a game coming out in August that is in the Marvel Universe.

[10:09] So it is a Marvel themed game.

[10:12] And let's talk about what this means because I think this is going to get really interesting.

[10:17] So we've got Jack Danger making a Marvel themed game.

[10:23] And you know, Marvel is a well that Stern continues to go back to.

[10:28] We've had a lot of Marvel titles.

[10:30] We've had Avengers.

[10:32] We've had X-Men.

[10:34] We've had Spider-Man.

[10:35] We've had Venom.

[10:36] We've had Deadpool.

[10:38] There are a lot.

[10:40] If you are a Marvel fan, you have had a plethora of games to buy from Stern Pinball.

[10:48] And the last Marvel launch was an absolute failure in Venom.

[10:53] Now there are some people out there who think Venom is great.

[10:56] Really just one person Bond who listens to this show who I think is trying to buy all 999 other

[11:03] Ali's to corner the market.

[11:04] But for everybody else out there, they whiffed on Venom.

[11:08] So then we go from a Marvel game like Venom that whiffed even though it had zombie Eddie on artwork.

[11:14] Even though it had, you know, seemingly some interesting stuff going on.

[11:18] It just wasn't a game that captured people.

[11:22] And I think also, let's be honest, because of the price, right?

[11:25] If Venom LE was like 8,500, I think a lot more people approach that game with an open mind.

[11:33] But now that we're at this like 13 for an LE, 10,000 for a premium, a lot of people are looking at

[11:39] these things saying, Hey, is the value there?

[11:42] Do I really want this?

[11:44] Am I going to free up space for this kind of game?

[11:46] And the answer was no.

[11:48] And then we got Jaws, which was Keith Owens.

[11:51] And I think Jaws is done well for Stern.

[11:53] And then after Jaws, we have the abysmal failure in John Wick.

[11:58] So here's the crazy thing.

[12:00] Here's going to be the interesting thing to look at in August.

[12:04] Do we really think that Stern can follow up one of its biggest failures ever with a Jack Danger,

[12:13] Marvel themed game?

[12:15] Will that be enough to captivate and engage people to buy this game?

[12:21] Now look, Jack Danger is an incredible designer.

[12:24] His first designed game, Foo Fighters is amazing.

[12:28] If you've ever played the game, you know what I'm talking about.

[12:31] Yes, I wish it had a few more toys in it, but from a pure satisfaction standpoint, that game is phenomenal.

[12:39] And it was one of the first $13,000 Stern LEs that did phenomenally well.

[12:45] Like it sold out pretty quickly.

[12:47] And for almost like a year, it kind of held value.

[12:51] And then all of a sudden something happened.

[12:54] All of a sudden, like everyone just got turned off by all these high prices in pinball.

[12:59] And it wasn't just Stern.

[13:01] It was like the whole hobby, right?

[13:02] Everything was just overpriced.

[13:04] And then all of a sudden, every single $13,000 Stern LE, Foo Fighter included, James Bond included,

[13:11] Venom included, all of them just lost like $3,000 in value.

[13:16] Like you couldn't sell a Foo Fighter LE unless you sold it for $10,000 or less.

[13:22] And so that is where we are at today.

[13:25] And so here's my question for each and every one of you.

[13:29] Do you think going back to the Marvel well is going to lead to like the kind of enthusiasm

[13:35] I think Stern needs to sort of course correct after John Wick?

[13:40] Now look, personally, I don't think going back to Marvel is going to create what they need.

[13:46] If I were Stern right now, what they really need is a universally beloved nostalgic movie,

[13:56] pinball machine.

[13:58] They need something like Ghostbusters.

[14:01] They need something like Batman 89 Redone.

[14:05] They need something like Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

[14:09] They need something like Top Gun.

[14:11] They need something like The Matrix or Karate Kid.

[14:14] And yes, I will say fifth element.

[14:17] They need something like that.

[14:20] If they go back to the Marvel well and they make something and remember, look at what Stern's done recently with the Marvel games.

[14:28] They haven't gone and made the movies or the major cultural things that people are engaged with, right?

[14:35] When they made Avengers, was it based on the Avengers movie?

[14:39] No.

[14:40] When they made Venom, was it based on the Venom movies?

[14:44] No.

[14:44] With X-Men 97 being the new property out there in the world that everybody's loving is the game going to be based on X-Men 97.

[14:53] And the answer is no.

[14:55] So they're going to the Marvel well, but they're not going to the big properties and the big cultural content that has everybody's attention.

[15:05] And I think that might bite them.

[15:07] Like, I'm not sure.

[15:08] Like this is what people want more of.

[15:10] Now that being said, the greatest way out of that problem is Jack Danger is an amazing game with amazing design and amazing code.

[15:20] And I bet if it is a Marvel themed game, I bet Zambietti is going to be on it.

[15:26] So it's going to look incredible.

[15:27] And if they do something in the Marvel universe in a really interesting and unique way,

[15:33] who knows, it might be the next Deadpool.

[15:36] And I think Deadpool is the game that I would hold up as the best Marvel game they've done since Steve Richie's Spider-Man.

[15:44] I think Deadpool is bolted to the ground in a lot of game rooms.

[15:49] But here's the issue.

[15:50] How much was Deadpool?

[15:52] It was like 8,500 foreign LE.

[15:55] How many LE's did they make?

[15:57] 500.

[15:58] Now, I know that there is real concern over at Stern by the Stern Creative Department that they're making too many LE's.

[16:07] That they're too expensive.

[16:09] That the marketing side of the company has set up the creative side of the company to fail.

[16:15] And I think what we're going to see this August, it's coming out in just a few weeks.

[16:20] I think the reception to this game is going to be the ultimate moment in which Stern either realizes they need to do something different.

[16:30] If I were them and I were listening to this podcast, now is the moment, Stern.

[16:36] If you're going back to the Marvel well and it's not based on a major movie, I think you need to make only 500 LE's.

[16:45] You need to start baking back in some value to these high end games you're selling.

[16:52] And if you don't, and if you make a thousand of them and then premiums are $10,000,

[16:58] I think you're going to see another lukewarm response to your game.

[17:03] And I think it's going to be like this forever until you come out with some of those like triple A movie properties that have so much nostalgic appeal.

[17:13] So that is where we are at today.

[17:16] It's going to be an exciting month.

[17:18] I think all these pinball companies have to wake up.

[17:21] I think it's over.

[17:22] Like you can't just charge $13,000 and make a thousand.

[17:26] You can't charge $15,000 if you're Jersey Jack and make a thousand Avatar CEs.

[17:31] If you don't have a theme like back to the future or diehard or Ghostbusters, you can't price everything like it's got that kind of demand.

[17:41] I'm curious what you guys think, but we're going to see this all unfold and you heard it here first on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[17:49] And to those like 25 people that have left Canada's Pinball Podcast because I took a break for my family.

[17:55] I don't know what to tell them.

[17:57] You guys are getting the goods on a Monday morning.

[18:00] Look out for that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland picture today.

[18:04] More to come on that.

[18:05] So many forgettable games and the biggest company in all of pinball.

[18:11] Going back to the Marvel well, is it going to get them out of the John Wick hole?

[18:16] We shall see.

[18:17] Everybody love you.

[18:18] Talk to you soon.

[18:19] Canada out.
