[00:00] Does that make me crazy?

[00:07] Alright, so pinball nerds from around the world assemble tonight to see Stern pinball's

[00:19] latest and greatest creation of Avengers Infinity Quest being streamed by Jack Danger on

[00:26] Twitch and I have to say I have to say man watching someone stream a pinball machine is

[00:32] like watching somebody eat a cheese steak right so think about that it's like you're

[00:37] watching someone eat a cheese steak you know a cheese steak is tasty but you're not sure

[00:43] yourself if you'll enjoy that cheese steak and that's what pinball streams are like and

[00:49] after watching it for for over an hour and they went on for like over two hours I just

[00:55] want to say that streaming pinball machines and watching all of this like you have the

[01:00] chat you have the play field you have the the LCD screen you have all this stuff going

[01:06] on I will say this watching a pinball stream just in general in general it's a fatiguing

[01:13] exercise and so I just want to say that if you're hearing some of my fatigue in my voice

[01:19] it's because it is draining it's like this overly colorful all the music all the everything

[01:25] coming at you in this like ADD sort of like concofony and after hit all I'm just like

[01:32] I just feel like I need to take a nap but instead of that I'm going to do episode 504

[01:37] of Canadian pinball podcast so what are my thoughts on Avengers now I think if you ordered

[01:42] an Avengers Ellie you were checking out this stream to make sure there was nothing about

[01:47] the game that would make you worried and I want to say this I want to say this I'm going

[01:51] to go over to the best of my ability my feelings on this stream and what I think people are

[01:56] probably taking away from this stream after watching it now we had Raymond and we had

[02:01] Keith L. Wynn on the game with Jack Danger now I think Raymond is the number one player

[02:07] in the world and Keith L. Wynn is another one of the best players in the world so watching

[02:13] them play a game you will get no sense whatsoever if the game is easier hard like there's they

[02:20] make every game seem easy so for those of you out there that are like oh I can't wait

[02:24] to get this game and hit all these combos and hit all these shots there's a really good

[02:28] chance you will never have a single game like them so just keep that in mind because the

[02:34] game was punishing Jack Danger much more than it was them now here's the thing here's

[02:40] the thing about these streams and I said it before and I'll say it again they need to figure

[02:44] out a better way to show these games for the first time because the last thing I want the last

[02:51] thing I want when I'm just trying to absorb the game is to hear this never ending barrage of the

[02:58] rule sets of the game and why should a pinball rule set be really laborious to articulate and

[03:05] to communicate to people and it just seemed like there's just so much going on in the game which

[03:11] is a good thing don't get me wrong for those of you buying this game for your home environment you

[03:16] want a game that's deep but man it is painful to listen to the never ending sort of communications

[03:26] approach with these streams where like Raymond's trying to stitch together all the different elements

[03:31] of the code and this and that it's just you can't follow it and then your head just starts to spin

[03:38] and you're like aren't we just trying to keep Thanos from getting all of the infinity stones like

[03:44] isn't just isn't that like on some basic level collect the Avengers and keep Thanos from snapping

[03:51] his fingers like that to me that's the easiest thing to understand and I get that they've put so

[03:57] much more into this game to make it interesting and again it's a good thing it's just a painful thing

[04:05] to sit through and listen to a rule set being stitched together over and over and here's why it

[04:10] gets painful because he's trying to explain the rules as a game is being played and a game is

[04:18] random like random stuff is happening in a game so he's trying to stitch together pieces of a

[04:25] random puzzle because he's not sure what the player is going to hit next and what's going to go

[04:30] on next and you can't really follow it and I think Stern Pimball needs to figure out a different system

[04:38] by which they explain the rules to these games the best time to explain the depth and the rules set

[04:45] and go into extreme detail on how it all connects is not is not the introductory stream of the game

[04:54] I'm sorry they need to we need to figure out how to do this better and I've seen it done better

[05:00] before and I just think that some people might want to geek out and go that deep but man I've

[05:06] I've I've spent a career getting people excited about a creative thing about a creation and some

[05:14] of this stuff just needs to be in the appendix in the parking lot like we don't need to go into all

[05:19] of this detail let's figure out like a one hour way in which we're going to show people the

[05:25] exciting elements of the game but not go way too deep to the point where it's just like your

[05:30] head start spinning okay now look that's not a knock on Avengers per se that is my overall knock

[05:37] on just the way streaming happens in Pimball like they just need to figure out a way to so they

[05:42] just and just clobber you with confusion after an hour of watching it all right so okay so let's

[05:48] talk about the game so if you ordered this game are you still excited or are you anxious and have

[05:55] you felt like your decision was a good one or do you feel like your decision was a bad one and I

[06:00] want to say this I think coming out of this stream there is a lot a lot more good then bad coming

[06:08] out of this stream I mean I think if you ordered this pin and you watch them play this game I think

[06:14] you're happy and you're confident in your early order there is one big but that I'm going to

[06:20] mention towards the latter half of my assessment of this stream that I think for a lot of people

[06:28] might have them you know a little like I'm the fence and I'm going to explain what I what I mean by

[06:33] that coming up but for the most part for the most part let's go down why a lot of people are excited

[06:39] about this pin and what we saw in this stream that there is to love about this game so let's just

[06:45] start out by saying zombie Eddie completely killed it on the artwork I mean it looks amazing I

[06:50] mean the game pops I mean if you want a colorful attractive game that makes you want to walk up to it

[06:56] and has a lot of detail this game artistically looks stellar and it's almost becoming like bar for

[07:03] the course for zombie Eddie because he's a stellar artist but hats off to zombie Eddie for a

[07:09] killer art pack especially especially coming from the you know ninja turtles then to this now we

[07:14] have one two punch with zombie Eddie and someone asked him like which one took you longer and I think

[07:20] he said like he had more time to do ninja turtles but the effort that went into both of these games

[07:26] was was super super high so and I think we see it in the final product so the game looks great it's

[07:32] a Keith L.W. in game so we know the game is going to shoot great my god does this game shoot

[07:38] terrifically well I mean as I was watching this game shoot and it is more of a fan layout for

[07:44] it for a Keith L.W. in design but man there is a lot of flow in this game there's a lot of combos

[07:50] in this game I'm not going to go over all the shots you look all the other podcasts will probably

[07:54] go more in depth in canada will but the game seems to have tremendous flow and there's a lot to

[08:00] shoot at there's a lot to hit there's a lot to combo and just the speed of it I was really impressed

[08:06] you know I'm spending all the my days playing Rick and Morty so I will say I died a little bit

[08:12] inside watching how good this machine shoots like there's just it's just to see a great designer

[08:19] with a great layout to see it in motion is really an incredible site I literally was looking over

[08:26] at my Rick and Morty I'm like why is there so much more to shoot at in Avengers than Rick and

[08:32] Morty why is there so much incredible flow left and right north and south in this game all these

[08:38] wire forms and the ball whips around in those wire forms I love it I love watching the ball move

[08:45] throughout the Avengers game I really do think that oh and knocked it out of the park with the

[08:50] layout of this game so what about the animation so the animations I thought were also well done

[08:57] in the sense that it finally someone has done comic book style artwork on the LCD for a comic book

[09:04] game or a Marvel game so it integrates really nicely so what you're seeing on the screen looks like

[09:10] what you're seeing on the play field it's very like the art and the LCD you know do feel very

[09:15] cohesive in this game and so I think you know if you are looking for a game that everything

[09:21] connects visually I think this does a really good job of that now the sound in the game I heard

[09:27] people saying like a lot of it sound it like the sounds were carry over from sounds from Jurassic Park

[09:34] now I haven't played a ton of Jurassic Park but in terms of orchestration I was seeing a lot of people

[09:41] like not really blown away by the music in this game and so music I think is you know not

[09:49] not up there in terms of like one of the better elements of Avengers Infinity Quest and I've said

[09:54] this you know I said this to people I was like look I think what's gonna happen when people play

[09:58] this game they're not gonna it's not gonna click with them the way Jurassic Park would because once

[10:04] that Jurassic Park theme song comes on it puts you into that movie like it emotionally grabs you

[10:12] and puts you into the world of Jurassic Park and I was like what's Avengers gonna play or what

[10:18] are you gonna hear that's gonna connect you to the world that you love now a lot of people

[10:23] are in love with the Avengers movie but you're not gonna get the Avengers movie theme song

[10:28] which by the way isn't really an iconic theme song the way Jurassic Park was you're not gonna

[10:33] get call outs from Tony Stark and Robert Downey Jr. and you're not gonna get the clips from the

[10:38] films you love so would a comic book would a comic book Avengers game be able be able to grab people

[10:47] and emotionally pull them into the game and this is the this is the this is where I want to talk

[10:52] about the butt because I think on paper this game checks so many boxes and should just be like

[10:58] an absolute grand slam home run right Keith Elwin zombie Eddie we've got Raymond and and Rick

[11:06] doing an incredibly deep code like if you think about it like what do home buyers want they want

[11:11] a game that shoots great okay Elwin we got it check they want a game that looks great a work of

[11:16] art okay zombie Eddie check they want a deep game that has deep rule sets that won't get old

[11:22] anytime fast check this game has that so if you check those three boxes and they want to theme

[11:28] that people love Avengers like right it's like one of the biggest movie franchises of all time

[11:33] even though this is not the movie Avengers is a theme that everyone knows so this like checks

[11:38] every major box art layout theme and code right that's what we always hear like a we can check all

[11:47] four boxes this has to be an amazing game a magical game okay but here's where here's where

[11:55] the the other variable lies that is so important and that is will this game will this game

[12:03] emotionally click with gamers like will you play this machine and will you feel something that

[12:10] makes you feel something special magical and will it create those pinball moments we always

[12:16] talk about on this show and that's my big bud is after watching it for like an hour or almost

[12:22] two hours I was just wondering to myself because again I can't really say yes or no until I play it

[12:29] and nobody can so please do not take what I'm about to say as like as the law of the land as my final

[12:35] assessment of this game but my feeling was like watching it and seeing like the moments in the game

[12:42] and seeing all the animations and seeing all the different things happening I just kind of didn't

[12:48] feel like it was grabbing me like it emotionally pulled me into any of it like it's cool it's colorful

[12:56] it's it's it's everything that you know that I recognize in the Avengers world but it just didn't

[13:03] click with me and I don't know if that's the best way to say it but I'm just wondering if a comic book

[13:10] version of Avengers is really gonna grab the pinball demographic which which are 40 to 60 year old

[13:18] men if this game will have that variable if it will do it for you I mean we know it shoots well we

[13:25] know it's code it well we know it looks good we know it's got deep theme like we know it has all of

[13:29] those major boxes checked but still part of me deep down inside is like yes yes yes yes but but it's

[13:38] not gonna emotionally grab people the way that Jurassic Park song grabs people it's not going to

[13:45] emotionally grab people the way the Ninja Turtles theme song will grab people and put them into the

[13:52] world of Ninja Turtles in which they have a lot of nostalgia for and that that's a huge thing for

[13:58] me because I do think that when you buy these games and you buy these toys deep down inside we all

[14:06] want these games to sort of grab us emotionally on a level that sometimes is hard to describe it's

[14:14] also the hardest thing to design in a pinball machine right it's like why is a diamond sheets game

[14:20] better than someone else's game it's it's like this this variable that goes beyond those four

[14:26] major boxes it's like have you made a game that will click and and go through people and make them

[14:34] feel something emotionally right well stir their senses will get them excited like are they all jazz

[14:40] to play it right and I think that's the other thing with the streams too is like you're watching

[14:44] these guys play it and I don't know if they're conveying a sense of satisfaction or not but it's

[14:52] hard to tell right people are wearing masks they've worked on this game for a long time they've

[14:55] probably played this game so much that it's even hard for them to get as excited about it now as

[15:02] they did all the months they were designing it so again take all of this with the grain assault

[15:08] and none of this is going to be decided tonight on this podcast none of it will be decided when you

[15:14] watch the stream but for me the major thing that's still a question mark is just that will this game

[15:21] grab people emotionally and will they click with it on a level that I think people have already

[15:27] attributed them feeling that way with this game I mean I heard someone say it's game of the year

[15:32] ready it's this or that already and that's where I'm like wait a minute wait a minute we we are

[15:38] already experiencing you know what Keith can do what zombie Eddie can do not everything they do

[15:44] will make you feel the same way until you play it and know for sure it's going to move you that way

[15:51] okay and that's my overall take is like this is it this is a very very very very amazing

[15:57] package from Stern Stern should feel very proud about this game they made it checks all those

[16:02] major boxes I just don't know if Avengers comic book with all of this deepness and complexity

[16:10] of that comic book narrative I just don't know if people are going to like connect with it the other

[16:17] part that when I was watching it that I just kept thinking I just didn't feel like I was battling

[16:22] evil right I mean just on a very just like top line level I just didn't feel like anything was

[16:29] that steak I didn't feel like I was battling bad people it just all felt very like upbeat and colorful

[16:36] and there's just something about the movie Avengers that I love in which there feels like everything's

[16:42] at stake like Thanos like kills half of your buddies at the end of the first one and it's like the

[16:48] entire universe is at stake half of the universe at least right and I just didn't get that gravitas

[16:56] from watching this game like the tension of it it just didn't feel that way and again that is where

[17:04] that is where telling a narrative and figuring out how to like code it in a way and come at you in

[17:12] a way you know the music maybe should be darker or there should be scenes in which you just feel

[17:18] you know like it's not always everything light up at once everything be colorful at once like it

[17:24] definitely feels like if you suffer from seizures this is not going to be a game for you and there's

[17:29] just something about like I don't know those moments of battling Thanos and I just want to feel

[17:36] like there's some tension when when Thanos is at the gate right do you feel that when you watch it

[17:42] am I being unrealistic what is Keney to talking about how does this guy have 504 podcasts who even

[17:48] listens to this clown still why isn't he just telling you to buy the game no I'm not again I just hope

[17:53] this is just how I feel I've always just told you how I feel okay now the other thing I was thinking

[17:58] about tonight was where is Jersey Jack pinball where you know like it's just like here we are again

[18:04] Stern's taking everyone's money the games are out and there's nothing there's nothing I mean

[18:10] Jersey Jack had a teaser when they launched Ninja Turtles and here we are and I wish I wish

[18:15] we could have a discussion tonight about the merits of guns and roses and the merits of Avengers

[18:22] Infinity Quest I think they're both both being brought out by the two best designers in pinball

[18:27] right now and I wish they could battle it out against each other right now that's the only thing

[18:32] I kept thinking about tonight is it just saddens me that Elwyn has his title out there he's playing it

[18:39] the world knows it the world can buy it and Eric Scott this juggernaut title in guns and roses

[18:45] and he can't even enter the ring like he's just waiting for them to get their stuff together and

[18:52] I wish we could have both of these prize fighters in the ring at the same time fighting for your money

[18:58] competing for your money but it's a one horse race right now and and that's unfortunate and the

[19:04] Dark Horse is coming with deep rude in less than two weeks we're gonna see what Raza has but

[19:10] again you know and that's Ross's biggest challenge and Robert knows that you know it I know it

[19:15] if Avengers has a hard time emotionally clicking with you in the comic book form how hard is it

[19:21] gonna be for retro atomic zombie adventure land to click with you because when I was watching

[19:26] this stream I kept saying to myself too this thing does like shoot way better than what we saw

[19:31] with the Raza game in Houston in terms of flow and like man keep those how to make a game flow

[19:37] all right but how do you make that game something that I have to own it I have to have it in my house

[19:43] I have to have this thing now because this is something I love for me personally and I'm just going

[19:48] to say it you know I've experimented with like Rick and Morty I think the game has a lot going for it

[19:53] the game also has stuff it needs to work on it needs more adventures is it clicking with me not

[20:00] as much as I'd like I don't play this game as much as I like because I'm just not drawn to turning

[20:05] it on every day over and over again and and to be fair it's not their fault I'm just not the biggest

[20:11] Rick and Morty fan how many of you out there watch the Rick and Morty show when it aired in real time

[20:17] did you follow Rick and Morty every season I'm gonna be honest with you I didn't I didn't watch

[20:22] Rick and Morty season one two and three I watched it after I ordered the game and I did find it

[20:28] funny but it's not something that I I guess the best way to say this I could easily I could easily

[20:35] live my life without Rick and Morty if I had gone my entire life without ever seeing a Rick and Morty

[20:40] episode I would be okay it's not one of those things that I have to go back to and watch and I don't

[20:46] know if I really want to watch those episodes over and over and over again but bad news for me because

[20:51] that's exactly what the game will be is watching those over and over again but I could watch karate kid

[20:56] over and over and over again or top gun or toy story or wreck it Ralph or you know or there's

[21:02] like a plethora of movies that I could watch over and over again and never get tired of them big

[21:06] trouble little China G1 Transformers the Matrix just things that are dream themes and my ultimate

[21:14] takeaway is I think that's what all of us want deep down inside you just you want a pinball machine

[21:19] that's related to a dream theme of yours and I think where we're at now is like some of you have

[21:25] dream designers and that's cool like just people out there who collect the best of every designers

[21:30] creation and pinball and Heath L win his three for three if you buy everyone of Keith L wins games you're

[21:35] gonna be very happy because he's designed some great pinball machines but for me I want the total

[21:41] package I want the best theme I want the best designer I want something that's a dream theme for me

[21:45] now you know me guns and roses is a dream theme for me everyone keeps asking me to share stuff

[21:51] I've seen guns and roses I've seen adventures I think it's gonna be a great battle between the two

[21:56] of them for game of the year I really do I think people are gonna find a lot to love in both of them

[22:02] I do think guns and roses is just gonna look more premium more elevated more polished and I also

[22:08] think it's gonna give you what I think Avengers might be missing I think it's gonna like emotionally

[22:14] grab you and wake you up more like wake you up more when you hear guns and roses welcome to the

[22:19] jungle and paradise city I think it's gonna be easier for them to make moments happen in that game

[22:25] simply because the music of guns and roses emotionally grabs so many people around the world I mean

[22:32] it just does when you hear November rain patients these songs will like bring you back to a time in

[22:38] your life that was probably much better than COVID 2020 and and for some of you you might hate

[22:44] guns and roses and the theme might be a non-starter and I totally respect that I totally respect that

[22:50] but I do think this new Avengers game is giving people somewhat of a dilemma inside of like yes yes yes

[22:57] but I don't know like am I really gonna feel am I really gonna feel that way inside I want for a

[23:04] game that is you know with Ellie with toppers now 98 hundred bucks and I'll close out this episode

[23:11] by saying this good on stern for being first to the market good on stern for getting it done good

[23:18] on stern for putting this game in a box in a few weeks and getting it to people there is no denying

[23:24] the fact that there is no way most pinball people want to spend twenty thousand dollars plus in one

[23:30] month on pinball machines and so for everyone who just bought an Avengers Ellie right and you buy

[23:36] a topper you're pretty much at 10k and so if Jersey Jack comes out in two weeks and shows you

[23:41] guns and roses are you really gonna be able to like tell the wife that you're spending 20 grand

[23:48] during a global pandemic on pinball machines because you have to have both and they were first

[23:54] I love Jersey Jack pinball to death but they're sitting on their hands right now they need to get

[23:59] this game out and also Robert Mueller is gonna need you to spend money on his game I mean think about

[24:05] it if all three of these games hit it once who's gonna spend thirty thousand dollars in one

[24:09] month on pinball thirty thousand dollars on one month for three pinball machines you know years

[24:15] ago we didn't have that problem because no one could get stuff out other than stern right and I

[24:20] don't even want to tell you guys that thirty thousand dollars and Tesla stock two years ago is now

[24:24] worth three hundred thousand dollars so good job explaining to the wifey how these Ellie's are

[24:29] good investments I shouldn't say wifey you know your partner all right anyway guys that's my

[24:35] take on Avengers I had to just wake myself up with the show I just can't do these over two hour

[24:40] streams anymore they got to figure out a way to you know get the excitement level but it doesn't

[24:45] matter they sold every Ellie but I I'm curious to see what you guys think about this game when it

[24:50] arrives when it arrives because I really I really think we're getting to the point now with such a

[24:56] fast cadence of machines that you guys don't even have time to like absorb these games learn these

[25:02] rules get good at these games by the time you actually understand these games the next game is out

[25:07] and they just clobber you with the next one whatever happened to like allowing a game to actually

[25:12] have some some ability to become relevant it's all so quick we're like in this 80 D world next next next

[25:19] well what's exciting is we're about to see two new games in just a few weeks I hope so I mean

[25:24] I really hope Jersey Jack gets guns roses out soon I mean it's just the weight is just it's killing

[25:29] them it's killing them the money's going elsewhere everyone this has been episode 504 of Canadian

[25:34] Spinball podcast glad to be back if you have issues with me I'm sure you won't have a problem saying

[25:39] it on pin side you can email me at canada pinballadgemo.com happy happy to read any of your feedback on air I

[25:46] got some more Ninja Turtles feedback I'll read that next time but this was just my quick assessment

[25:51] of thank you Jack Danger thank you Stern pinball we'll talk to you guys later
