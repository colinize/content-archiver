[00:00] See Donnie Luziana close to New Orleans, way back up in the woods among the Evergreens.

[00:05] The Stoodalaw cabin made of earth and wood, where lived a country bar named Johnny Begood.

[00:10] Sitter, Sitter, Sitter, Sitter, Sitter, Sitter, Sitter.

[00:14] Oh, welcome everybody to the 6 time favorite pinball podcaster who can't win another award.

[00:21] We're here to talk about pinball happy Monday morning everybody.

[00:24] Spooky Pinballs having a good Monday morning.

[00:28] They've sold over 500 units of Evil Dead Pinball.

[00:33] Is that a success?

[00:35] Is that indicative of a softer pinball market?

[00:38] We're going to talk about that.

[00:40] We're going to talk about what I think continues to hang over the pinball world as a dark cloud.

[00:48] I think one move or lack of move is indicative of what were they thinking.

[00:56] I want to talk about this.

[00:58] I want to talk about how the biggest pinball company in the world decided not to make what would have been the biggest game of its history.

[01:11] And how did Stern Pinball come to the conclusion that we should not make back to the future?

[01:20] Instead, we'll make Venom.

[01:23] Instead, we'll make John Wick.

[01:26] Instead, we'll make Foo Fighters.

[01:29] How did they come to this conclusion?

[01:32] And where do they go from here?

[01:34] Now that we know this, right?

[01:36] Now that the whole pinball world knows that the number one pinball company in the world slept on the biggest theme they ever would have made,

[01:46] what does that mean for Stern's decision making moving forward?

[01:51] And are they going to be able to salvage that mistake and ink a deal with Dutch pinball from what I hear right now?

[01:57] It's not looking so great.

[01:58] All right.

[01:59] So let's talk about Evil Dead.

[02:01] 500 units or more have sold with a 20 minute feature at video.

[02:07] Nobody's seen gameplay.

[02:09] Most people out there, you know, you're not huge fans of the movie, but what you did get was one of the most beautiful pinball machines we've seen.

[02:18] You got an incredible art package by Christopher Francie.

[02:22] You got a game loaded with fun stuff with toys that interact with the ball.

[02:26] There's no shortage of things not to be happy about in this game.

[02:30] It's a wide body game.

[02:32] You can get one of the nicest tappers in the history of pinball for $1300.

[02:37] It's not super cheap.

[02:39] Don't get me wrong, everybody.

[02:40] The pinball world's gone crazy.

[02:42] Spooky games used to be half this much money.

[02:45] They're only going to make 888.

[02:47] I say only because it is like a sweet spot for them.

[02:52] It's not too little.

[02:53] Like 666 would have been great.

[02:56] But as they've said in my Patreon chat,

[02:58] if they did that, it's hard to make ends meet, right?

[03:02] They've got a lot of people working there.

[03:04] They still have to pay salaries.

[03:06] They still need to make a decent amount of money for the amount of time and energy that goes into making these games.

[03:11] So 888.

[03:13] Now, the reason why I think they haven't sold all of them is the theme.

[03:18] I mean, that's it, people.

[03:19] Let's be honest.

[03:20] Like they sold 750 Rick and Mortys instantly.

[03:24] Instantly 750 Rick and Mortys were sold out.

[03:27] It was like in a day.

[03:29] And the thing about Rick and Morty, it had really nothing in it.

[03:31] It was a terrible layout.

[03:33] And that game sold so quickly because of the theme.

[03:36] I would argue that Evil Dead, when you look at the themes that Spooky Pinball has put out there,

[03:42] this is one of the more like obscure, like niche, niche themes.

[03:48] You know what I'm saying?

[03:49] It's like the movies aren't good.

[03:50] Like let's be honest.

[03:51] Like if you watch Evil Dead 1 and 2, they're not really that good.

[03:56] Army of Darkness is where it gets better.

[03:59] But how many of you out there, raise of hands, have watched these movies and then felt compelled to watch them again?

[04:07] And I know there's going to be people who, because of this game, go and watch the movies for the first time.

[04:13] And let me tell you, most of you are going to be really disappointed.

[04:17] They're not good movies.

[04:19] And so that is why I think the sales of this game, even though the game is so awesomely cool,

[04:25] it's still not mainstream enough to sell as quickly as a game like Rick and Morty.

[04:31] And look, Scooby-Doo, a much more mainstream theme.

[04:35] I would argue the Scooby-Doo Pinball machine not nearly as designed as good as this machine.

[04:42] And also, the problem with Scooby-Doo is they said they were making 1,964 of them.

[04:48] So those games are not rare at all, and they're easy to get.

[04:52] So also, here's why I think they sold 500 and do I think they're going to sell 8,888?

[04:58] Maybe. The issue now is this.

[05:00] A couple of things. We haven't seen gameplay.

[05:02] So I don't know what the gameplay is going to be like.

[05:06] It's a wide-body game. It looks pretty wide open.

[05:10] So is the game going to shoot really fast?

[05:13] Or is it going to be a little bit floaty?

[05:15] I don't know.

[05:16] I have to wait to see the gameplay like the rest of you.

[05:20] The reason why I think the gameplay is going to help is when we see the gameplay,

[05:24] we're going to get all the assets and the integration is going to be great.

[05:28] We're going to get all those funny, campy call-outs in the game.

[05:31] And I think the game is just going to have so much personality.

[05:34] And I think that's really going to come through when we see gameplay.

[05:38] Now, I don't like no gameplay on the day they want you to buy the game.

[05:43] I don't like that. I'm just tired of that.

[05:45] I don't understand.

[05:47] Hasn't this game been in development for a while?

[05:50] Surely there's enough to put some gameplay together.

[05:53] And it's like when you think about the marketing around pinball these days,

[05:56] it's like they just don't want to show you enough.

[05:59] They want to show you the sizzle,

[06:00] but they don't want to show you the meat on the bones.

[06:04] And even as I'm watching the feature-rette video,

[06:06] I can see a little bit of gameplay.

[06:08] And some of it looks a little like slow motion.

[06:10] You don't really get a sense of like how the game is going to play.

[06:14] Are there combos?

[06:15] Like what is it really going to feel like?

[06:17] And when you walk up to the game, you know, how inviting is the game?

[06:21] And again, I just don't know.

[06:22] And nobody who ordered one knows either.

[06:25] And so I still dream of a pinball world in which the day they want your money,

[06:31] the game is available to play.

[06:34] The game is maybe out on location on day one.

[06:37] Remember when they used to do that?

[06:38] Remember a few years ago when the day that Stern revealed the game,

[06:43] it was already on location.

[06:45] It's kind of like they're pulling back.

[06:47] You know, Jersey Jack didn't have avatars shipping on day one.

[06:51] Like they did guns and roses.

[06:52] It's like everyone's pulling back again.

[06:55] And they want to only give us just enough to sort of pull the trigger.

[06:58] But the problem in modern pinball now and as spooky as sold 500 games.

[07:03] Here's the issue I see.

[07:05] So there's like, let's just say they sold 500.

[07:07] Now there's 388 more games for sale.

[07:12] If your number, let's say 600 on their list of games to make by the time they get to your game,

[07:20] your evil debt, by the time they get to it, we will also get Harry Potter.

[07:27] By the time they get to game number 600, we will also get barrels of funds, the Goonies.

[07:34] By the time we get to 600, we are most likely going to get Keith Elwin's King Kong.

[07:40] And that's the thing.

[07:41] It's like, so then why would you want to be further down the line on this game?

[07:48] And also we all know this.

[07:50] By the time they get to number 600, some of those first 500 games will pop up for sale,

[07:58] will be cheaper than MSRP.

[08:01] And that is why in the pinball world, you really kind of want to see a day one sell out

[08:09] on those deposits because if this was a more appealing theme for most people with this much in it,

[08:17] with that kind of art package, this game would have been an instant sell out.

[08:23] And so I look at the 500 as like, it's a good day.

[08:27] It is a really good day for spooky.

[08:29] It is a good milestone for them.

[08:32] But I also look at it a little bit like this is another labyrinth.

[08:37] It's a theme that like sure, if you like it, you're going to love it.

[08:42] But if you don't like it, it might be an easy pass for most people.

[08:47] But this is the advantage of being a boutique company.

[08:51] You don't need to make something that everybody likes.

[08:55] You don't need to make something that sells two to 3000 units.

[09:00] You don't even need to sell all your games on day one.

[09:04] And as spooky has said in the Patreon chat or on pin side, they are already working on three more titles.

[09:11] I think they have their next four titles lined up, three of which have playable white woods and they're currently coding those games.

[09:20] So maybe they make 888 evil deads.

[09:25] If they only sell 700, no big deal.

[09:27] They'll just go on to the next game.

[09:30] And so spooky pinball is very much in the driver's seat.

[09:33] The good vibes around this game are hard to miss.

[09:37] I haven't felt a week like this in a long time.

[09:40] We didn't get this with Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[09:44] As much as I tried to hype up the community around that game,

[09:47] ultimately the game itself just didn't land with magic in it that made people go, wow.

[09:54] Like I wish there was a little bit more in that game.

[09:56] I tell this to Melvin, he's going to have to code more wow into that game.

[10:02] So we'll see what happens.

[10:03] We definitely didn't get any of that with X-Men.

[10:06] I mean X-Men was a wow.

[10:08] When we first saw X-Men, it was beautiful.

[10:11] It was awesome.

[10:12] It was so cool.

[10:13] But Weisen destroyed this game with his code.

[10:16] He's just not a good coder.

[10:18] How many months later and now X-Men, they had to send out a service bulletin on a few games.

[10:25] You might have to do this fix and it seems like a complex fix for sure.

[10:30] And here's what I don't get.

[10:31] If you're making X-Men on an assembly line and every game is supposed to be made the same way,

[10:38] how is it that just a few games have issues?

[10:40] That does not make any sense to me.

[10:42] That is absolute hogwash.

[10:45] Something went wrong from prototype to final production in this game.

[10:50] And so now you've got mechanical issues.

[10:53] You've got software issues.

[10:55] And by the time they figure it out, I mean this, people are just not going to care.

[10:59] And I feel bad for Jack.

[11:01] The game was rushed and now the vibes around that game are never going to recover.

[11:07] And it's a learning for Stern.

[11:08] They really need to learn to slow down and make sure you get it right.

[11:13] What Spooky did this week, and again, I'm not going to say something stupid like Stern's in trouble because of Spooky.

[11:20] Stern Femball will make more money in one week than Spooky all year.

[11:24] They make more games in one week than Spooky can make all year.

[11:27] They are not in trouble because of Spooky.

[11:30] The only thing that can kill Stern Femball is Stern Femball.

[11:34] We're going to talk about that in a little bit.

[11:36] And they're doing a good job of seemingly killing themselves with some boneheaded decisions.

[11:43] You know, the thing about Spooky Femball is this.

[11:45] Spooky Femball is in a really good position.

[11:48] They've got a good team of people over there.

[11:50] And when you look at Franchi, when you look at Bug, when you look at Luke, when you look at Ben Heck,

[11:55] when you look at everybody sort of involved in their operation, you just want to be a part of it.

[12:02] It just feels like the kind of company where if you were to open the door and walk in there,

[12:07] you would be greeted with hugs.

[12:09] They would want to take you out for beer and brisket.

[12:12] And you just want to be a part of a company and support a company that has that kind of mojo and those kind of vibes.

[12:20] I'm not feeling that yet from Barrels of Fun.

[12:22] I got to be honest, David Vaness, I know you're on a mission to sort of do better than Spooky,

[12:28] but I don't feel the love from Barrels.

[12:30] Like they haven't really been a transparent company.

[12:33] And I think they need to work on that, David.

[12:35] I know you guys kind of keep everything close to the vest.

[12:39] You know, there's no fun happening in Barrels of Fun.

[12:42] I mean, you got to start living up to your name.

[12:44] I know the guys over there and they're all cool dudes,

[12:47] but when you look at the company on social media and how they engage with the community,

[12:51] I'm just not feeling the same vibes that I feel with Spooky Pimble.

[12:56] And that's the thing is like we're at the stage now with all the Pimble,

[12:59] where everyone realizes you don't need any more games.

[13:02] Like nobody needs more games.

[13:05] Everybody is out of room.

[13:07] The games are so much money.

[13:09] And for something to sort of take your dollars now,

[13:13] it really, really, really needs to feel like it's going to make you feel better than you already do in Pimble.

[13:21] And I want to say congratulations to the team at Spooky,

[13:24] because I think you made everybody feel good this week.

[13:27] And I think everyone who ordered one feels great.

[13:29] And I think when we see gameplay video, you're going to sell more.

[13:33] But I also don't think the game is going to go up in value, which is fine.

[13:36] And you know, not every game can.

[13:37] Will it hold value much better than Looney Tunes?

[13:41] Much better than Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[13:43] I was actually kind of feeling bad, man, because this game is going to make every Texas Chainsaw Massacre

[13:49] and every Halloween just tank in value because it's such a nicer package than those machines.

[13:56] And you got your chainsaws and you got a lot more personality

[14:00] and you're going to have a lot more fun with this game.

[14:03] And I can't wait to these guys make something like Gremlins,

[14:06] something with more mainstream appeal.

[14:08] And I will be a buyer when that day happens because I want to support these guys.

[14:13] I think they're doing great stuff.

[14:15] They just need to make a theme that speaks to me.

[14:18] All right.

[14:18] So speaking of a theme that speaks to me, speaks to you, speaks to everybody,

[14:24] one of the most iconic movies of all time, one of the most historic films from the 1980s.

[14:30] How the heck did Stern Pimble, who's got designers that are around our ages, right?

[14:37] People born in the 70s and early 80s, more likely the 70s.

[14:42] You know, I don't believe it when Stern Pimble says that nobody at Stern Pimble wanted to make back to the future.

[14:51] There was nobody over there that wanted to make that game.

[14:55] The truth is they brought in a consultancy.

[14:59] This was one of the moves.

[15:00] You know, Seth is a new CEO over there.

[15:03] They brought in a marketing consultancy.

[15:06] And they did focus groups with people that are young with a Gen Z audience.

[15:13] And they put themes in front of them because to Stern, they think the way to grow and the way to future proof their business is to focus group in age group that has no money to buy Pimble.

[15:27] Pimble buying demographic.

[15:28] It's like if you're a cruise line and you want to keep your cruise line going and nobody 18 to 25 wants to go on a cruise.

[15:36] It doesn't matter what you put on board the ship.

[15:40] They're not going to get on board.

[15:42] And so for Stern Pimble to go to people who are super young, do not have disposable income and to ask them what themes do you want to see in a Pimble machine that you can't even afford.

[15:54] Right there, they were destined to fail with their marketing efforts.

[16:00] And so apparently what I heard is that when you put back to the future in front of Gen Z kids who have never seen the movie, who don't understand any of the cultural context of the film or the significance of the film, they didn't want it to be made.

[16:17] And so Stern went off of that feedback.

[16:20] Because do you think John Borg wouldn't want to make back to the future?

[16:25] The dude is like stuck in the 1980s.

[16:27] He like rides a BMX bike around with like a Sony Walkman on and he's like still using skateboards.

[16:34] That dude would love to make back to the future.

[16:36] Oh, and by the way, I'm just here to confirm for each and every one of you that Tron remake is coming.

[16:42] He is doing the same thing to Tron that he did to Metallica.

[16:47] And I also heard that he feels that Tron could have even more in it that when he originally made Tron, you know, it doesn't have that much in it.

[16:56] So he's going to add a few more special things into the game.

[17:00] So if you have a Tron LE right now and you're not going to listen to Canada and you think you can sell it for $21,000,

[17:08] I want to tell you right now you should sell your machine for what you can get right now.

[17:14] And don't come crying to me when this new Tron hits and your machine is now worth like $9,000.

[17:20] If that, because no one's going to want any of the old machine when the new Tron comes out.

[17:26] You heard it here. I keep telling you, I told you about Metallica, smart people sold.

[17:31] Those who held on to it, you just lost $10,000 on your $19,000 Metallica LEs.

[17:37] So John Borg would want to make it.

[17:39] Now we hear Keith Elwin. It would be a dream theme of Keith Elwin's while he was over there for years.

[17:44] Did they ask Keith Elwin if he wanted to make back to the future? No.

[17:48] I'm sure Jack Danger would want to make it.

[17:51] Heck, Brian Eddy would want to make it.

[17:53] Who wouldn't want to make back to the future?

[17:55] And so here's my thing, this lack of awareness by Stern.

[18:00] To me, it's everything wrong with them right now.

[18:05] They just seemingly are out of touch with who buys their product, what they really, really want.

[18:13] And they're sort of trying to grow the company in all the wrong ways.

[18:18] You bring in these outside consultancies and you end up with garbage like the new Jaguar positioning.

[18:25] You end up with garbage like what Bud Light went through.

[18:29] You think the only way to grow your brand is to think outside of those people who love it right now.

[18:36] When George Gomez said to me, the customer I want is not the customer I have.

[18:43] That is something I would have never said.

[18:46] And the moment you start thinking like that is the moment you are headed off the rails.

[18:52] What George Gomez should have said is what I want to grow my industry is to take all the customers I have.

[19:00] And if each of them just invites one friend into this hobby, then I will double the size of my business.

[19:08] And that is our goal.

[19:10] My goal is to listen to why my customers right now buy my product, to listen to what themes they really want.

[19:20] And to deliver to them what they want and exceed their expectations of what they can expect from Stern Pimbal.

[19:28] And if I achieve that, if we drop more themes that they want and exceed their expectations on how great those games can be,

[19:36] we will double the size of Stern Pimbal.

[19:39] And that is my goal.

[19:40] I didn't hear any of that.

[19:42] Instead, they did Gen Z focus groups and landed on stuff like John Wick and Jody Dankberg.

[19:48] They got Mr. Sharp over there, one of the Sharp Sons.

[19:51] You know, this is the marketing team.

[19:52] This is the marketing team.

[19:54] And look, I've been talking to them and I would love to work for Stern Pimbal one day,

[19:58] but I would love to come in there in a position to really build a marketing department, build it the right way.

[20:04] You know, they haven't had to sort of grow up and become a modern marketing company.

[20:11] And look, when it comes to marketing, everybody, it's all about the decisions you make before you start making the game.

[20:18] The most important marketing decision you can make is making the right theme and listening to your community.

[20:26] And the reason why Stern marketing pains me so much is the one audience they don't really listen to

[20:33] are the new in box home buyers.

[20:36] Every move they've made recently is like kind of burning that community.

[20:40] They haven't listened to you.

[20:42] They're going to remake all the games you thought they were never going to make again.

[20:46] And I think it's a big mistake because Sharp is out there with the Stern army and college kids.

[20:52] You can't afford anything.

[20:53] He's out there making sure tournament players are getting excited about their insider connected achievements.

[20:59] And then I don't know what Jody's doing.

[21:00] He's at Slayer concerts.

[21:01] It's like, guys, it's time to reset this thing.

[21:04] It's time to reset this thing and missing out on back to the future.

[21:08] To me, speaks so much volume about the problems facing Stern in the future.

[21:15] I think they've learned their lesson.

[21:17] I do.

[21:18] I think they're trying to recover from this.

[21:20] I'm also hearing that 40% of Stern sales are Keith Elwin.

[21:24] And so this company, you know, as big as they are, if I had to give them a recommendation,

[21:30] I would go to only two cornerstones a year, but make them amazing, make them bangers.

[21:36] I think they're way too aggressive on their scheduling.

[21:40] I think three cornerstones, who can absorb three cornerstone games a year and a remake of a hit game from yesteryear?

[21:50] It's too many games.

[21:52] And if you make back to the future, you're going to sell more back to the futures than Foo Fighters,

[21:58] Venom and John Wick combined.

[22:00] So one real magnificent cornerstone, in my honest opinion, is better than three mediocre themes,

[22:10] three games that not everybody wants.

[22:12] And so we'll see what happens with Stern Pinball.

[22:15] I'm nervous because the other thing I'm hearing is this.

[22:18] They are about to raise prices in January.

[22:22] And if you thought you were at the top, you're not.

[22:25] They're about to raise prices.

[22:28] And I think when that happens, it's going to be met with a lot of resistance.

[22:33] Because what?

[22:33] You're going to raise prices on Dungeons & Dragons.

[22:38] You can't raise prices on a bad game the same way Jersey Jack, when they raise their prices on Toy Story, Godfather and Elton John,

[22:47] everyone was like, I'm tired of this.

[22:49] Your games now cost so much more and there's so much less in it.

[22:54] I think the only way Stern could justify a price increase is if it's on Keith Elwins' King Kong,

[23:01] and if they only make 500 LEs and they actually give you some secondhand value.

[23:06] But I think when this happens, I think overall, if I were just to look at this hobby gang, we're all kind of over it.

[23:13] Like, the games are too expensive.

[23:16] Everything's losing so much money.

[23:18] And the joy in Pinball is all going to be about buying used games.

[23:23] I mean, that's where it's at.

[23:24] This smart man is just going to wait, let all the rich fat cats like grab stuff right away,

[23:31] let the rich fat cats take the huge depreciation on the games, and then march in and pay 40% less for whatever you want.

[23:40] Nothing's hard to get anymore.

[23:42] Nothing is sort of sought after.

[23:44] Nothing is a flex game that you can't go get.

[23:47] You could still go get Alice today.

[23:49] You'll be able to get Evil Dead.

[23:51] You can go get Jaws LE for less.

[23:53] You can get every single game for less money.

[23:55] If you think Metallica LE is going to stay at 17 or 18,000, it's not.

[24:01] We all know this.

[24:02] We're going to move on to the next.

[24:04] Harry Potter's CE is going to have a feeding frenzy on day one,

[24:08] and then it's not going to be hard to get it six months later if they make a thousand of them.

[24:13] Nothing anymore.

[24:14] Nothing anymore.

[24:15] I don't know, gang, it's just kind of lost what it used to be.

[24:18] It's all overpriced.

[24:20] And look, maybe the cost of making these games has gone up,

[24:23] but the enjoyment the games are giving us hasn't gone up 40%.

[24:28] We remember how much fun we used to get for like half as much money,

[24:33] and I think it's a real dilemma for these companies.

[24:36] I think it's a real quagmire.

[24:38] A lot of you collectors are in.

[24:40] You kind of know you're just good with what you got.

[24:43] And the higher the prices go, the more pinball will turn people off.

[24:47] The less pinball will grow, the higher the prices cost.

[24:51] So we'll see what happens.

[24:53] You know, we'll see what happens.

[24:54] I think it's going to be a very interesting 2025.

[24:57] I could see this hobby being so over saturated that it starts to really collapse faster than people think.

[25:05] And even if people have money, it doesn't mean they want their money to keep going into pinball.

[25:12] You know what I'm saying?

[25:13] Like at some point, we're all going to be like, do I need more?

[25:16] Like why do I keep consuming this stuff?

[25:19] The overconsumption in America is a pathway to unhappiness.

[25:24] Everybody knows this.

[25:26] And eventually you're going to wake up and realize what did I do?

[25:30] Like why do I have 20 pinball machines and I'm only one person and nobody comes over to play them

[25:36] and nobody cares anymore on the internet?

[25:39] Like the whole social media flexing about what I got.

[25:42] No, the thing you should be showing everybody that makes you feel good

[25:46] is a great physique.

[25:47] Like you should be working out and feeling good.

[25:50] You should make sure your money is growing in a way that makes you happy and feel secure.

[25:54] You should be doing experiences with your friends and family.

[25:57] Instead of buying a $15,000 pinball machine, call up your best pinball friend.

[26:02] Go get two first class tickets to Tokyo.

[26:05] Have some amazing meals in Tokyo for 10 days.

[26:08] Come back and that trip will benefit your life way more than a pinball machine.

[26:14] And you know it everybody.

[26:15] Canada out.

[26:16] Happy money.

[26:17] I'm going to go chug some coffee.

[26:18] Go, go, go, Johnny, go.

[26:20] Go, go, go, Johnny, go.

[26:22] Go, go, Johnny, go.

[26:24] Go, go, Johnny, go.

[26:26] Go, go, go, Johnny, go.
