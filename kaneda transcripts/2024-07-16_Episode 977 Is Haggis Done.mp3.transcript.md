[00:00] So many tears I've got had, so much pain inside, but baby it ain't over till it's over.

[00:11] What if I told you it was April of 2021 when Haggis Pinball announced they were making

[00:24] Fathom Revisited, and I think even back then they said they were going to be done with those

[00:29] games by the end of the year, then we were going to move on to Marty Robbins' next game,

[00:36] which is War of the Worlds. And here we are, July and yesterday, the trucks were outside of the

[00:44] Haggis Factory, and I am hearing from my sources on the ground that they were months behind on their

[00:51] rent, and the landlord was going to lock them out of the property and seize the assets. And so what

[01:00] did they do? They loaded up two trucks and they fled for the hills. And so I just want to ask everybody

[01:06] on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, two questions. Is Haggis done for good? And how did

[01:13] we get here again? And I've been covering this hobby for 10 years. Let's start with the second

[01:19] question. How do we have another boutique company that once again has failed to deliver on its promises?

[01:27] And you got to remember, like this company made Celts, they didn't sell many of them,

[01:32] and from there they went from Celts to Fathom, and they were going to make games in Australia,

[01:39] which is also really expensive. They also made some changes to the pinball game that for a lot of

[01:46] us were seemingly beneficial, right? They were going to do that plexiglass play field with the

[01:51] art printed underneath. But then you started to hear when you go to manufacture that, it becomes

[01:57] problematic because all the standardized parts that would be available if you wanted to remake

[02:04] Fathom don't work with that thicker play field. You have to re-engineer everything. And when you

[02:11] look at this company and its totality, it looks eerily similar to what Highway Pinball went through,

[02:19] where you go from like announcing a game that nobody really wanted in Celts and Falthrottle,

[02:26] then you scale up operations after a failure. I mean, just think about that for a minute.

[02:32] What other industry? What other career? What other manufacturing company have you ever seen

[02:39] where you scale up after you fail? And that is something that's really, truly, I feel like,

[02:45] unique to pinball. It's like, if you can just screw together anything, whether or not it's

[02:51] successful. In some weird way, these founders of these boutique companies, they start to get

[02:58] delusional and these ideas of grandeur if they just scale up. If I just make more, more sales will

[03:06] come regardless of what is the theme, regardless if I even know how to scale up, and regardless if

[03:14] I've taken the baby steps necessary to build the right kind of company to absorb all of the overhead.

[03:21] If you think about Fathom and Haggis, you think about this company that basically was like garage

[03:27] building these Celts in like a tiny little factory. Then if you go look at the factory tour, you got

[03:33] to go back and watch this stuff. You got to go watch the factory tour of Damien walking around

[03:39] that big factory by himself with nobody there. Now, all of a sudden, he has to fill it with machines,

[03:46] with parts, with an assembly line, and he has no idea how to do that. Yet, the reason why we got here

[03:54] again is because the pinball community supports, for some reason, we support these delusional men

[04:03] and their ideas of grandeur. It'd be like if one day I said to you, hey, look, I'm going to stop pinball

[04:09] podcasting and I'm going to go into the business of making pinball machines. You would look at me

[04:15] like I'm crazy. And even if I did like garage build a few games, if I then asked to take like

[04:21] orders on hundreds of machines, you should look at me like I'm crazy. And yet in pinball, and it's

[04:28] not just Damien, it was Andrew Highway, it was John Papadouk, it was Kevin Kulik. The list goes on

[04:36] and on. For some reason, we always give these people the benefit of the doubt as if because

[04:43] they're making pinball, they have some manifest destiny by the gaming gods that it will all just

[04:50] work out. And we've seen it before and the most dangerous thing with these guys, because what

[04:55] they always end up doing, and it's very similar like Highway Pinball to Haggis, they always end up

[05:01] somewhat succeeding. And as long as they somewhat succeed on doing something right, everybody will

[05:08] point to that as being the reason why it's all going to work out. And ladies and gentlemen,

[05:14] that is kind of how Ponzi schemes work. And I'm not saying this is a Ponzi scheme, but it's a similar

[05:20] type of thing, because you point at something that gives consumers confidence. It's like, hey, look,

[05:27] they built those full throttles. So what could possibly go wrong as we move into manufacturing

[05:34] of alien, they built those Celts. And so what's going to go wrong when they go to build the fathoms

[05:41] and a lot goes wrong. And yet here we are again. And if I had to summarize why I think this happens,

[05:48] I think there are cheerleaders in the community. And you know who they are, they're never held

[05:55] accountable. Some of them are content creators, but most of them are people on the ground, local

[06:02] to these companies who don't do their due diligence to look out for the community. How many times,

[06:09] how many times did Iceman drive around deep root pinball? Did he ever knock on the door? No,

[06:16] if he had just walked in once and seen that there's no manufacturing going on, it would have saved

[06:22] everybody in the community from even giving Robert Mueller any deposits on a game. We never held

[06:29] those people accountable. Steve Bowden walked into deep root every day and knew there was no

[06:35] manufacturing going on. Never once was there actually an assembly line at deep root pinball.

[06:42] Did we hold Steve Bowden accountable? He went on podcasts left and right and got people to be

[06:48] confident in the company. He asked people to give money. He told people just wait until you see

[06:54] what's going to come from us. Did we hold any of those people accountable? No. Did he ever really

[06:59] apologize for what he did? No. Now he's over at American Pinball. And so when you have a community

[07:06] like this, where nobody's ever held accountable, where we just always give everybody the benefit

[07:12] of the doubt, and when these companies ask for non refundable deposits, you got to go back and

[07:18] look at the climate of when that happens. Everybody, and I mean this, when Haggis was doing this,

[07:24] everybody was supporting them but me. And the reason why I didn't want to support Haggis is

[07:30] because I don't think any company should take non refundable deposits until they can prove they

[07:36] can make it happen. You know, when barrels of fun came out, they didn't ask for non refundable

[07:40] deposits before a single game was built. They announced their company when they had games in

[07:45] boxes. But I don't think any pinball company should have non refundable deposits. I think

[07:50] it's a joke. I think it's given a lot of these companies immunity from accountability. And I

[07:56] think as a community, we should be done with them. And guess what? The easiest way for us to get rid of

[08:02] non refundable deposits is when a company announces a new game with a non refundable deposit, don't

[08:09] give a deposit. Everybody can just get together and not give a deposit. And that would make them

[08:14] alter their business models. Like maybe we need to get the theme right. Maybe we need to figure

[08:20] manufacturing out. Maybe we can't lie to customers about when they're going to get their games.

[08:25] And if we stop lying and we're more transparent, we'll be fine. Like right now, do you really think

[08:31] spooky pinball right now still needs to have non refundable deposits? They don't. They absolutely

[08:37] do not. The reason they have it right now is it's beneficial to them because if people start to see

[08:44] prices tanking on Ultramans like we did after they revealed it and after they shipped the game,

[08:49] then people can't bail out, right? They're almost not held accountable for the game not being good.

[08:54] But I'm sorry. If your game is six months away from being built and you no longer want it,

[09:01] there is no reason why you shouldn't get your money back. So like we're a community that is

[09:06] overly accepting. We're a community that just doesn't hold these companies to the fire. And

[09:12] look, 10 years ago, I would understand if there was this level of blind faith in pinball companies,

[09:19] but we're talking just a year ago when Damien came out with Centaur revisited and we did not.

[09:27] I mean this. There was not pitchforks and torches at the door of Haggis Pinball when they made that

[09:34] move. I feel like I was the only content creator that was calling them out for the utter BS of

[09:41] taking deposit money on a new game when they were so far away from fulfilling the orders

[09:48] on all of those fathoms. And yet there's no accountability. And yet we have everybody saying,

[09:54] I love pinball, pinball's fun. It's all about positivity and pinball. But I'm sorry, but someone's

[10:00] got to be looking out for the consumer. Someone's got to be looking out for the community. And it is

[10:05] a community that has shown over the years. It will not look out for itself. It will look out for the

[10:12] manufacturers over the community, over the customers. And that's weird to me. It's really weird to me

[10:19] that like, you know, people cheerlead a company like Stern charging $13,000 when they just remove

[10:25] the color from their printers and we're all supposed to just get on board. We're just going to keep

[10:30] remaking everything. They're pretty much almost charging us for a Godzilla premium, the same price

[10:35] the Ellie was just a few years ago. And we're just all okay with it. But look, Stern is going to do

[10:41] what they do. Look, I don't care if legit companies rip us off. Like that's one thing. Because then

[10:46] it's on me to decide whether or not I want to buy their product. But Haggis Pinball, I don't think

[10:52] we can consider Haggis Pinball like a fully legit, healthy company. They never were. American pinball

[10:58] has never been a fully legit, healthy company. No, they're backed by someone else's money. If they

[11:04] had to survive on their own ideas, they'd fail. And you go down a list for every pinball company

[11:09] that's been successful, there's probably three to four that have not. Now the other reason why I

[11:15] think this happens in pinball other than the community allows it to happen and like, Pinside

[11:21] allows these guys to exist. And we have all these community members not looking out for each other.

[11:27] The other reason I think it happens a lot in pinball is it takes forever to die. If you think

[11:32] about it, pinball companies, man, they go on far longer than they ever should. And sometimes they

[11:39] pull off a miracle like Dutch pinball. And that's the thing. It's like if a company like Dutch pinball

[11:45] can turn it around after like six years of failing, then people start to say like, well,

[11:52] maybe Haggis is going to be another Dutch. Maybe Damien's going to downsize, go get some investor

[11:59] dollars and figure this out. So there's like this weird lingering hope that just exists in the pinball

[12:08] world. I'm here to tell you right now, I'm going to be the killjoy. This company is done. They're

[12:14] not done this month. They're not done this week. They were done three years ago. They didn't have

[12:22] a business plan that was ever going to work. They were delusional. They were optimistic. And they

[12:29] were dreamers. They don't have games that people really want. Their games have decreased in value

[12:36] in the second hand market. Trying to compete with a centaur versus the modern pinball experience

[12:43] was never going to work. Manufacturing in Australia and having to import parts was never going to

[12:51] work. Finding cheap labor over there was never going to work. All of this was never going to work.

[12:59] I would love to see Damien's like spreadsheet when he thought he could figure all of this out for what

[13:04] he was charging for the games. And you know, probably the hardest thing in all of pinball

[13:10] manufacturing. It's not designing or prototyping a game. Really where these companies fall down

[13:17] is they're not manufacturing companies. See, that is why Gary Stern always says we are a

[13:23] manufacturing company. To really succeed in any of this, you need to have people on the line. You

[13:32] need to make your efficiencies with your manufacturing. If you don't do that, you will fail because

[13:40] every month you have to pay rent when games are not going out, you're losing money. And I think the

[13:46] other big mistake they make is they fail to realize how expensive it really is to train staff members,

[13:55] to have them stay with you, to keep them happy so you don't have to start all over again. And you

[14:02] have these people assembling a highly complex electromechanical device and they could be making

[14:09] the same money flipping burgers at McDonald's and you think you're going to make it and that's the

[14:16] thing and nobody anticipates those things. They think everybody shares their dream, but the problem

[14:22] with all these boutiques is all the equity is just with the founders, the people screwing these

[14:28] games together. They have no equity. They're not going to make more money the more games they make.

[14:33] It doesn't matter. They're just in this very low wage, annoying job. And if you don't treat them

[14:39] right and keep them busy, it's not only going to be a terrible paycheck, it's also going to be boring.

[14:45] And for these companies, when they mismanage how they order parts from their vendors, and then

[14:50] you're Damian and you're looking in your factory and you've got these five guys there that are building

[14:54] your games and now you're on a parts delay. What do you do? What do you do if you've got a two-month

[15:00] delay on a part and you can't finish the game? You got to send all those workers home and then you

[15:06] got to rehire them and you got to think about insurance and all this stuff. It just doesn't work.

[15:12] If you're going to become a pinball company that wants to sell a few hundred games a year,

[15:16] you've got to be a manufacturing company first and they're just not. I hope that we all just come

[15:22] to our senses and call it what it is. Haggis is done. And I think Damian and Marty, they need to

[15:30] make a statement. Like we now saw these trucks show up at your factory, say something, are you

[15:37] still recapitalizing? What's the progress on that recapitalization? And I think if I were them,

[15:44] just end it. Just end it, guys. It's over. And the reason why they won't is because they love

[15:51] pinball so much. And this is the problem. If you do this and you take customer money and you burn

[15:57] your customers like they did, you're no longer allowed to enjoy the hobby you love because you

[16:05] made it more than a hobby. You made it your profession and you took people's money and you

[16:10] burned them. And now you have to learn a lesson. You don't get invited back to the party. You don't

[16:15] get to roll around pinball shows. You don't get to do podcasts. You don't get to joke. You don't

[16:20] get to laugh. You ruined your own ability to enjoy the hobby you love. And that's the price you pay

[16:27] when you cross over. You know, that is why like I enjoy doing what I do because nobody's going to

[16:32] take this from me. If you people knew some stories that happened recently, people are trying to take

[16:38] this podcast from me and I'll explain that at a later date. But I'll just say this. There are people

[16:44] out there that don't want to take accountability for their bad decisions. Instead of correcting those

[16:50] decisions and thinking about a better way to run their company, they're trying to run canada off the

[16:56] airwaves. It's not going to work. It's not going to work. They're all in control of their own destiny

[17:02] and they're not going to get me to stop and they know who they are. I don't even have to name names

[17:07] because as I say to everybody, in the end, the numbers don't lie. And if the money runs out,

[17:14] you're done. And if your parent company gets tired of losing money and they want to close shop,

[17:20] you're done. And there's just too much other pinball that is working out. There's too many

[17:26] companies that are executing at a high level that we don't need these boutique failures anymore.

[17:32] I still believe that the future of pinball is boutique and it's going to be the successful

[17:38] boutique companies that I think take over pinball. I think Stern is too big. I don't think they're

[17:44] going to be able to sustain this mega factory at these prices. I think the future of pinball

[17:50] is going to be mid-sized boutique companies that need to sell just one to 2000 games a year

[17:57] where they nail the theme and they make these games really creative and they give us great value.

[18:02] I think anything else is like mass production of super expensive pinball machines where like

[18:08] half of them are going to flop and then they're just going to remake and oversaturate the old

[18:11] titles. It's not going to work everybody. Happy Tuesday, Canada out!
