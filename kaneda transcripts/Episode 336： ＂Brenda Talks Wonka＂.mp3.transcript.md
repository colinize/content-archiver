[00:00] What is love?

[00:02] Baby don't hurt me.

[00:04] Don't hurt me.

[00:06] No more.

[00:08] Well, there were two of us in the Canadian Pimball household that flipped Willy Wonka this

[00:18] week and it wasn't Bubba.

[00:20] It was me and my beautiful wife Brenda who has decided to join the show today.

[00:25] Oh, decided to join the show.

[00:27] I'm good.

[00:28] I think I feel sorry for your listeners that I'm the only other person that you were able

[00:36] to talk about this current topic and J.J.P. number five at the moment.

[00:41] So sure.

[00:42] All right.

[00:43] Now, before we jump into talking about Willy Wonka and our experience at Jersey Jack

[00:47] on Friday, I want to ask you a question.

[00:50] So I just read on Pinside that someone said that I suffer from manic, depressive tendencies.

[00:56] Now as someone who lives with me every day, do you feel that's true and accurate?

[01:01] Right.

[01:02] So when you're sitting in the corner rocking back and forth, crying over the cruel words

[01:08] that people are saying.

[01:09] Yeah.

[01:10] Yeah, I suppose.

[01:11] I know I'm in the corner in the fetal position being like, I hope Hilton does and say

[01:14] something about my ability to enjoy my life.

[01:17] I think if you suffered from manic depression, you would not be doing this.

[01:21] Right.

[01:22] It's not regular basis.

[01:23] You wouldn't be this hobby.

[01:24] Just for the listeners of this show, do I physically assault you on a weekly basis according

[01:28] to the behavior at the Bimbal Championship last year?

[01:32] No.

[01:33] Okay.

[01:34] So Brenda and I were invited by Jack to come to Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[01:38] Now Brenda, this was the first time you'd ever seen a Pimbal company behind the scenes.

[01:43] What was it like when you went through the doors of Jersey Jack?

[01:45] I'm sitting here actually sporting my very own Jersey Jack baseball cap.

[01:50] It's very comfortable.

[01:51] Loving it.

[01:52] Yeah.

[01:53] I was kind of blown away to be honest.

[01:57] I hadn't seen a Pimbal manufacturer company ever before.

[02:00] I had an idea in my mind based on just some of the shite that I've heard people talk about

[02:05] and the level of professionalism that's not really spoken about in a lot of the comments

[02:10] and stuff that you've, that I've overheard you talking about, that I've overheard you

[02:15] and your friends talk about on various different forms and stuff.

[02:18] And it was the complete opposite.

[02:20] It is so professionally put together.

[02:22] Jack is an amazing facility.

[02:24] And there were a ton of people and it really just coming from a seafood industry where

[02:28] I've seen manufacturing and I've seen companies behind the scenes.

[02:33] This was like super legit.

[02:34] I was super, super, super impressed.

[02:36] Were you impressed by the size of Jersey Jack Pimbal and all the games and parts and

[02:42] what was it like?

[02:43] I mean, because I don't think most people have a context of like what a Pimbal manufacturing

[02:47] facility looks like.

[02:49] Well, it had an operational line.

[02:50] It was very, very clearly very well thought through.

[02:53] This is someone who has not done this for, this is not the very first time he's done

[02:57] this. He's clearly been in business multiple times before.

[03:00] And he knew what he was doing getting into it.

[03:01] And it was very, very clearly well thought out about how do you start the process?

[03:06] What is the line of manufacturing that's needed?

[03:09] How do you ensure that you design the placement of each of those things to be very easy to

[03:12] transition from one to the other to optimize and to be very efficient?

[03:16] And then also to have enough space in which you can store games in which you can store

[03:20] parts.

[03:21] And then there was the whole back-of-house part, which I loved as well.

[03:24] He had a room where there was a beautiful version of each of the games that he has already

[03:29] brought out.

[03:30] And I had a lot of fun playing them while you were interviewing Jack and Joe.

[03:33] Right.

[03:34] So we did it toward the facility and then the moment happened, right?

[03:36] And we're going to talk about Wonka a little bit without giving away the details.

[03:40] So Brennan, what were your thoughts when Jack took us into the operation room and showed

[03:45] us Wonka for the first time?

[03:46] You mean JJP number five?

[03:47] Yeah.

[03:48] I signed it into you.

[03:50] I was very, very, very excited.

[03:51] I was very giddy.

[03:53] I think I was giddy for you.

[03:54] And it was also a little bit nervous because you've had such high expectations of JJP

[03:58] number five.

[04:00] And I also know that we only have room for one pin in our apartment.

[04:03] And as much as you have loved Batman 66, you have, you've crushed that game.

[04:08] You've beaten it essentially.

[04:09] I suppose that what you say.

[04:10] I'm right.

[04:11] That what you say.

[04:12] You've hit all the modes.

[04:13] You've captured all the villains, things like that.

[04:15] I've captured the villains.

[04:16] I've been to the wizard mode.

[04:17] But there's no real beating, beating Batman.

[04:19] OK.

[04:20] Yes, we've actually...

[04:21] I feel like you've personally, you've gotten out of it what you were looking to get out

[04:25] of it.

[04:26] So you've been talking for a little while about freshening it up a little bit.

[04:29] And we only have room for one pin.

[04:30] So yeah, I was a little nervous.

[04:31] I was like, oh gosh, here we go.

[04:33] If this isn't it, what's it going to be?

[04:34] Because I'm not too sure what else is coming down the pipeline.

[04:36] Right.

[04:37] Now, when you saw the game, and we saw the movie a couple days before going over there,

[04:42] are you a big theme of Willy Wonka?

[04:44] I mean, I think a big game.

[04:45] I am a theme of Willy Wonka.

[04:46] I represent each of the characters on a various different basis.

[04:49] No, I am not a theme, but yes, I'm a massive fan of Willy Wonka.

[04:53] I mean, who isn't?

[04:55] I'm not sure if you've already told your listeners, but it was surprising to me when

[04:58] you told me that when you used to watch it as a kid, you were afraid of it.

[05:01] I was the opposite.

[05:02] I wanted to live in that world.

[05:04] I wanted him to be my uncle.

[05:05] I wanted him to let me into the chocolate factory and let me have such fun with this

[05:09] super imaginative, fun world where anything and all of your imaginations and dreams

[05:14] can come true.

[05:15] Yeah, I mean, I was always terrified that the kids never came back in the movie, that

[05:18] they just sort of get sucked through a tube or turn into a blueberry.

[05:21] I didn't get any very care for any of that because I knew that I was Charlie.

[05:24] You were right.

[05:25] I knew I was going to win.

[05:26] All right.

[05:27] So you see the game.

[05:28] Now, we jumped on it a bunch of times.

[05:29] Now, each of us played the game probably five to ten times.

[05:33] I played it a bunch more because I snuck back into the room.

[05:36] Yeah, I was not impressed by that, by the way.

[05:38] You were just waiting for you to come back after finishing your podcast and you know,

[05:42] you popped back in and you're like, where have you been?

[05:43] I've been playing the game.

[05:44] Yeah.

[05:45] They were in the show and playing the older Jersey Jack titles and I just wanted to play

[05:49] walk-up by myself.

[05:50] Now, Brenna, you've flipped Batman for a long time.

[05:53] You've played other games in the city.

[05:55] What was it like just from an approachability standpoint playing this game as someone who's

[05:59] not-

[06:00] You took the words out of my mouth.

[06:01] Okay.

[06:02] Go ahead.

[06:03] Approachability.

[06:04] I mean, I looked at the game and I look at a lot of these games.

[06:06] I'm very intimidated.

[06:07] I know that I don't listen to every one of your podcasts.

[06:10] I certainly do not read Pinside.

[06:12] I am not involved in this in the level that most people are.

[06:15] So when I go to whether it's Sunshine and I mean, that's really where we go.

[06:19] Or even any of these other places where you've got friends who have machines, I'm kind

[06:23] of just like, I'm like, yeah, whatever.

[06:24] You know, some of them look beautiful, but they're very intimidating for the most part

[06:27] to approach.

[06:29] This one just, my eyes lit up when I saw it.

[06:32] It looked absolutely beautiful.

[06:33] Like the layout, the design, how open it felt just it drew me in and I wanted to play

[06:39] it, which is not something that is like you have to kind of urge me.

[06:42] You've got to give me quarters.

[06:43] We go somewhere and I'm like, okay, cool.

[06:45] Let's do this.

[06:46] But this one I wanted to play.

[06:47] And I think you guys will see on Friday when the game is revealed.

[06:50] There are just like big pieces of real estate and toys in the game that just sort of jump

[06:56] out at you.

[06:57] Pull you in.

[06:58] Now, did you feel-

[06:59] I don't know.

[07:00] I talk a lot on this show about world under glass.

[07:02] When you stand over that machine, did you feel like immediately you were transported into

[07:09] the Willy Wonka world?

[07:10] I think Chris, you were probably frustrated because I bet you to the punch and using that

[07:15] exact line in front of Jack when we saw him last week.

[07:20] It is, it very much, I could feel parts of the theme jumping out in every aspect of it.

[07:26] And it just, it almost like told a story and I wanted to be in there.

[07:29] I wanted to be a part of the play field.

[07:32] That sounds really weird.

[07:33] Yeah, you want to be part of the play field?

[07:35] You want to be part of a piece of wood.

[07:38] Now there are people on Pinside who are saying that, you know, I'm overly excited just

[07:43] because I got a tour of the factory and that- some guy actually emailed me today and said

[07:47] I've sold out.

[07:48] That I'm gonna sell out because I'm rarely into this pin.

[07:52] You've listened to me complain about pinball companies now for a few years and I've done

[07:56] it just because I don't think most of the pinball games that have come out have been that

[07:59] impressive, that innovative, you know, Brennan, like do you think I've sold out?

[08:05] Did you ever check pinball or do you think people will see what I've seen, what you've

[08:08] seen and will be converted the same way we have?

[08:12] Yes, I think there's a couple of factories.

[08:14] I think number one, you know, if you are a diehard, what was the thing that just came out

[08:20] of black knight?

[08:21] Is that a movie?

[08:22] No, no, it's a original theme by Steve Vance.

[08:25] Okay, so that example, if you're a Batman fan and like that is your number one, like

[08:28] you grow up and that's all you wanted to ever do and play and listen to and whatever,

[08:32] then that's your theme.

[08:33] You know, I think like Robert, for example, I think I read when I was catching up on some

[08:36] of your city threads this morning, said that he used to call all of his pins, his children

[08:41] and he could never pick a favorite, but growing up like Batman was his thing.

[08:44] So when Batman 66 came out and people would ask what's my favorite, he would say Batman

[08:49] without hesitation.

[08:50] So if you have that, like if there's a dream team for you out there, it doesn't matter

[08:54] who would even manufacture it, etc.

[08:56] I mean, using Jersey Jack again, the Pirates of the Caribbean, I don't personally, I've

[09:01] never enjoyed flipping that, I've done the ever actually successfully flipped that pin,

[09:05] but there are people out there who are avid, Bill, Bill at our wedding, freaking love that

[09:10] game, couldn't get him off the machine.

[09:13] So I think it's partly, if you're really into this and I know that you love this theme.

[09:17] So I think it's partly that, but I think the big part for me and I love seeing Jack smile

[09:20] in his face, watching you and other people play the game last week is that I feel like

[09:26] he knows he's gotten their right.

[09:28] He knows there's been things that have not been perfect in past games, but he has learned

[09:32] a lot from that and he has insured that he has hit the nail on the head every single time

[09:38] with this one.

[09:39] So just to go back to the question specifically, when people play this game and see it Friday,

[09:45] do you think they're going to be converted and be as giddy as I was leaving the factory?

[09:49] Yes.

[09:50] Okay.

[09:51] Now I think, and I said this to Jack, I think people are going to have a hard time standing

[09:55] back from that machine and finding stuff to write about.

[09:59] It sort of checks every single box that this show has been harping on about four years,

[10:05] which is you have to make a game based on a theme.

[10:07] People enjoy it.

[10:08] It should look beautiful.

[10:09] It should shoot beautiful.

[10:10] It should have beautiful animations.

[10:12] It should have amazing callouts.

[10:14] It should have replay value.

[10:16] You know, I really didn't walk away and see anything that I would have changed.

[10:19] You know, we see some games on Pinside where it's almost like the design team is asking

[10:24] Pinside for their opinions on how to do this and that.

[10:28] Let me tell you something.

[10:29] There's nothing I could tell Pat Waller about how to do to better design that game.

[10:33] There's nothing I would tell the artist to do differently.

[10:35] There's nothing I would tell the engineers who made all those mechs to do differently.

[10:38] And I think that's what was so exciting is I didn't feel like I immediately had a list

[10:42] of things to critique.

[10:43] Now, Brenda, some people say that I'm selling out because, you know, I'm not like

[10:49] negative and down on the game now.

[10:51] Do you feel like if I found a game like this that I absolutely adore that maybe my job

[10:57] is done in the pinball podcasting world?

[10:59] Oh, guys, he says this like every two days.

[11:02] He's like, I'm totally done with it.

[11:03] This is it.

[11:04] I'm either going out in the high or you know what, I'm so freaking over it and people are

[11:07] just so nasty and mean in this hobby.

[11:08] Like, why am I bothering?

[11:09] So no, I think you love what you're doing.

[11:12] I think that you've got to kick out of this.

[11:14] I think that you actually are serving a purpose for people.

[11:17] You wouldn't have won the second, for the second year in a row as the number one pinball

[11:21] podcast.

[11:22] If you truly were not delivering on that, I do think that and I'm hopeful that in next

[11:26] year and whatever future years that more pinball podcasters come out and they learn from

[11:31] you and they can compete with you and challenge you.

[11:34] Maybe only then if we can knock them off his horse, will you really, really retire from

[11:39] this?

[11:40] You think of it?

[11:41] Wait, you think I would retire if I finished second?

[11:42] We're not in this to win it.

[11:44] I think what's, so what gets called into question a lot too is just that do I even like pinball

[11:49] or 330 six episodes later, you live with me.

[11:54] You talk to me more than anybody.

[11:56] Do I have a genuine passion for pinball?

[11:58] And again, these aren't scripted questions, but I would just, what do you say to those people

[12:02] who are like, he doesn't even care about pinball?

[12:04] I've known you all five years and yes, you've had a pin in this in our home now for every

[12:10] day since the day we met.

[12:11] We've done a bunch of stuff on those pinball machines and not just flickering.

[12:16] Christopher.

[12:17] Oh.

[12:18] Yes, but you know, you truly, you love it.

[12:20] When I met you first of all, it was more arcades and I think I remember reading at the

[12:24] end of that article when people asked you about, well, what's next considering you had

[12:29] just brought to life the bedroom arcade and you had a new found appreciation for a pinball

[12:35] and you said, I think this is what I want to learn more about.

[12:38] And I think that's what a hobby really is.

[12:40] It's about you diving into something and learning everything about it and developing an

[12:43] opinion.

[12:44] So yeah, you do.

[12:45] You love it.

[12:46] And when you don't like it, you'll admit it.

[12:47] Right.

[12:48] And when you think something's wrong, you'll say it.

[12:50] And when you're wrong, you'll acknowledge it.

[12:52] I hope I've apologized for all my wrong doings and I will apologize right now for my

[12:57] future wrongdoing.

[12:58] So between...

[12:59] And if you weren't into it, would you really be that passionate and would you be, you know,

[13:02] if this was fake for you, you wouldn't be, you know, as expressive or as reactionary.

[13:08] And I think you've learned a lot from that as well.

[13:10] Absolutely.

[13:11] You should be so.

[13:12] Absolutely.

[13:13] Well, let me ask you a question, Brennan, because between...there's two titles that

[13:15] are on the horizon.

[13:16] Obviously, Willy Wonka, we have the order in.

[13:18] So you know I've ordered it.

[13:19] So first, let me ask you that.

[13:20] Like, what are your feelings on the fact that your husband has just decided to allocate

[13:24] $12,500 of hard...seemingly joint account now?

[13:28] It's your play money.

[13:29] But are you excited to get it?

[13:32] Yes, I am excited to get it absolutely.

[13:35] And touch on the joint account thing.

[13:37] We still don't have one guy, so please encourage him.

[13:38] I think it would be a healthy exercise.

[13:41] But you'd never...you would never invest money in something that would jeopardize what

[13:45] our plans are and what our future are.

[13:46] So that's why I tease and I call it...that's your play money.

[13:48] So if you want to spend money on that cool, I'm going to go buy an ice bag for myself.

[13:50] You're not going to question that.

[13:52] I buy you an ice bag, though.

[13:54] You don't buy me thinball machines.

[13:55] No, I'm never going to buy a thinball machine.

[13:56] What's up with that?

[13:57] It's like a pair.

[13:58] It's a double standard.

[13:59] Okay, so...

[14:00] But yes, I'm excited for it because again, you know, go back to what I said.

[14:04] It's beautiful looking.

[14:06] It's not at all intimidating for someone like me.

[14:08] I know that when my friends come over, it's going to be an nostalgic theme that they're

[14:12] going to get giddy to want to talk about and they're going to want to like play it.

[14:16] And then when they do play it, my friends are like me.

[14:20] The priority for us is can we keep the ball alive?

[14:23] Right.

[14:24] And there are...the shots were wide.

[14:26] I love that I could actually hit a ramp, you know?

[14:28] Right.

[14:29] And I love that just...I could see the ball wherever it was.

[14:32] And there were so many wonderful pieces.

[14:33] It wasn't like all this blinking lights everywhere.

[14:36] I wasn't super confused that I have been in other things.

[14:38] That's a really good point we haven't talked about.

[14:39] You know, I think that casual people who walk up to this game are going to have so much

[14:43] fun and they're going to be pulled into it immediately.

[14:46] And also to your point, the ball is always in...you always know where it is.

[14:50] Like this game doesn't feel like you're losing the ability to sort of understand what you're

[14:55] doing.

[14:56] I just think when people see like the toys and the way the world is popping out, you know,

[15:00] from the, you know, the play field.

[15:02] And they're going to know exactly what to shoot.

[15:04] And they're going to see like, you know, all what happens when I hit this.

[15:07] And then they're going to see what happens.

[15:09] Even if you don't know what to shoot, because guys, I didn't really know what to shoot,

[15:12] I was excited to keep shooting, you know?

[15:14] I had no idea.

[15:15] Like when we would come back in and you had been playing a few games on your own, you

[15:19] had talked about unlocking things and whatever.

[15:21] And I was like, yeah, that's cool.

[15:23] I jumped on not knowing how to unlock those things, but I didn't care.

[15:26] I was just happy keeping the ball alive because everything felt fresh and new.

[15:30] And I mean, obviously it was, but it was exciting to be able to know where the ball was going

[15:35] and know that I was doing that.

[15:36] Right.

[15:37] So I got a note from someone who was talking to Pat Lawler today and Pat is also making

[15:42] some changes to the game.

[15:44] They're just tightening some things up.

[15:45] I heard that the version we played is not the final production version.

[15:49] They're going to make the game maybe a little bit, not more, a little bit more difficult.

[15:54] And I don't, I mean, by that is the make the ramps.

[15:56] I mean, the ramp openings were pretty big.

[15:57] They might make those a little bit smart, which I don't think will be a problem because

[16:00] they were really easy to hit.

[16:01] Jack, if that happens, can my please have the game?

[16:03] You have the wide ramps.

[16:04] Thank you.

[16:05] It's still going to be, you know, again, that's not going to be frustrating.

[16:07] And Pat said that he's like, I'm making this game so that everyone can play it and have fun.

[16:12] I'm not making a game with super tight shots.

[16:15] They're only for tournament players who have a high level, you know, ultra high level of

[16:18] skill.

[16:19] And, you know, and again, and we always say on the show, a game should be hard to get through

[16:23] the modes and get through the game from a software standpoint, but a game shouldn't

[16:27] be frustrating to shoot.

[16:29] So let me ask you a question now.

[16:30] So Willie Wong is coming into the house.

[16:33] Batman is leaving.

[16:34] Well, first let me ask you, are you going to be sad to see Batman go or were you just pretending

[16:37] to like it as much as I did because I grew up with the show?

[16:40] I mean, I'm very familiar with it.

[16:42] I think Batman's cool.

[16:43] Yeah, but this is going to sound so cliche, but, you know, I played with Barbie dolls.

[16:47] I wasn't necessarily playing with Batman.

[16:50] So I wasn't emotionally attached to it as you are.

[16:52] No, it's beautiful looking.

[16:53] It is genuinely a piece of art.

[16:56] So that reason is amazing.

[16:57] I'm trying to sell it right now.

[16:58] Give me some sizzle.

[16:59] It's gorgeous.

[17:00] It's fabulous.

[17:01] It looks like it's never been played before.

[17:03] It is.

[17:04] You put a lot of, you know, you got it and then you started buying all these things.

[17:07] I was like, why are all these things arriving?

[17:09] Like, why do you need to put this protector on?

[17:11] Why do you need to put these side things on?

[17:12] Why do you need to dress it up more?

[17:13] And I think it was partially to protect it so that it does look like it's never been flipped

[17:18] before.

[17:19] But also to add a little bit more of the world under glass that you felt wasn't necessarily

[17:24] there.

[17:25] And people say that I never play pinball and that I'm just a troll who doesn't even enjoy

[17:29] pinball.

[17:30] You're here.

[17:31] You guys.

[17:32] Didn't even get turned on, doesn't it?

[17:33] Maybe what I'll start doing is that every time Chris is playing pinball, I'll jump onto

[17:38] like pin sight or something and just start ranting and raving and then you'll see the

[17:41] volume.

[17:42] You should start a pin sight account.

[17:44] I really should not.

[17:45] Pin sight Brenda.

[17:46] And you can actually can't ban you.

[17:48] I'm good.

[17:49] Well, they could.

[17:50] They'll probably think it's you.

[17:51] So.

[17:52] But no, yes, you play it a lot.

[17:53] But that's again because you love it.

[17:54] And you get excited and you get giddy.

[17:56] And I don't mind that because I'll sit out here and I'll watch my reruns of Sex in the

[17:58] City.

[17:59] It's going to be a good day.

[18:00] It's a happening before after I'm in the fetal position as a manic depressant who lives

[18:04] in a New York City apartment has a great job.

[18:06] A beautiful wife, a great bald dog, a dodge demon.

[18:08] All the reasons why I'm a manic depressed tendencies, you know.

[18:12] I'm also been called a sociopath and egomaniac and a lot of other things.

[18:17] Okay.

[18:18] So Brenda, let me ask you a question too.

[18:19] So between toy story and Willy Wonka, I know you love both.

[18:25] What are your thoughts?

[18:26] Like are you now that you've seen Wonka?

[18:27] It's toy story actually coming out because we've mentioned it when we talk about like dream

[18:31] pins and stuff.

[18:32] Yes.

[18:33] So toy story is coming out.

[18:34] It's also being made by the same team that made Willy Wonka.

[18:37] So like, and it's confirmed.

[18:38] Yes.

[18:39] Did you say that in NDA?

[18:40] Jack is like J.J.P. number five, six.

[18:44] So that is also happening.

[18:46] Are you now sort of like we just should own both or you're like, if you had to choose

[18:51] between the two, what would you say?

[18:57] I will say that it's Willy Wonka currently because I've seen it.

[19:00] I've played it and it's beautiful and I want to play it.

[19:04] I have no idea what this next one, J.J.P. number six or seven or whatever number down the

[19:08] line, it's going to be, it's going to look like.

[19:10] Guns and roses.

[19:11] Or what it's going to feel like or how accessible it's going to be.

[19:14] And until I see that because I love toy story so much, if it's not ticking all the boxes,

[19:21] then I'm not going to want it in nice.

[19:22] Right.

[19:23] Okay.

[19:24] So my goal with the room is to, if I can fit two in this place, maybe we move that couch

[19:30] from the couch.

[19:31] Guys, we really can't.

[19:32] I don't know.

[19:33] He's absolutely off his rocker.

[19:34] But if that couch, which is Bubba's like fifth bed in the apartment, if that moved,

[19:40] we could put two there.

[19:41] And move where?

[19:42] Lads, he's lost it.

[19:43] Bubba could sleep under the pins.

[19:45] Bubba's like, what do you do all we do about going?

[19:48] Should we talk about, let me ask you a question, how did it feel to be beaten by Brenda multiple

[19:52] times when we first flipped the pin?

[19:56] I mean, Brenda's a really good pinball player.

[19:58] Not really guys at all.

[19:59] Did you beat me at one point?

[20:00] I had higher scores than you every single time we played.

[20:03] All right.

[20:04] Well, it's because I've trained you.

[20:05] I don't know.

[20:06] No, no, no, no.

[20:07] How did you feel?

[20:08] I felt great.

[20:09] Honestly, this game was so much fun to play.

[20:11] I was in focus on score trying to beat anyone.

[20:14] I was just trying to sort of contain my excitement in front of the people there.

[20:19] So let me ask you a question to you, Brenda, because I've walked away from this whole experience.

[20:22] And a lot of people are saying, why did Jack even invite Chris over?

[20:26] Chris just slammed them at T-P-F.

[20:28] I had that whole podcast where I ran to late.

[20:30] I know, I did.

[20:31] So why do you think he invited me?

[20:33] Because I think that he knows that he has definitely not knocked it out of the park with

[20:40] some of the prior games.

[20:41] And definitely he's been things.

[20:42] He's made a lot of lessons and learnings.

[20:45] And I think he knew that he knocked it out of the park with this one.

[20:50] He really did.

[20:51] He's learned so much.

[20:52] He ticked all the boxes.

[20:53] And he was excited to show you and almost like, for us you'd fall in love with it and

[20:58] almost like try to find something that was wrong with it.

[21:00] You were so giddy.

[21:01] You were so excited.

[21:02] And you were even seeing things in the game that he was hopeful you would see.

[21:06] Yeah.

[21:07] That's so mind-flute all through.

[21:08] You know, there's a lot of people think there's some big conspiracy where Jack

[21:11] and I are in the co-heats, co-heats, co-heats.

[21:15] And we're like working together to market and height this machine and nothing of that sort

[21:20] is accurate.

[21:21] I mean, it was just a simple invite.

[21:24] We went over there.

[21:25] I played hooky from work and...

[21:26] I shouldn't say that on this.

[21:28] That's fine.

[21:29] I mean, here's my thing is, is Jack doesn't read Pinslide.

[21:33] Jack doesn't listen to podcasts.

[21:34] I mean, he listened to the show where I destroyed them at T-P-F.

[21:38] But I'll tell you this.

[21:40] Jack knows when they do stuff that is half-ass.

[21:42] Jack will be the first person to tell you that he didn't want to do the Yellow

[21:45] Brick Road reveal the way it was, but he had nothing to give people, but he had to give

[21:48] them something because the game was already on the line.

[21:51] But by the way, it's gorgeous.

[21:53] It is beautiful.

[21:54] I mean, and look, for those people out there, I think Pinslide looks at that game.

[21:57] He's like, oh, they removed the monkey.

[21:59] No one's going to buy this.

[22:00] But there's a world of like 9 billion people out there, most of which I've never even

[22:03] heard of Pinside or seen the game before.

[22:06] And there are more than enough households who are just getting into Pimball who will

[22:10] probably buy it.

[22:11] Look, look.

[22:12] And the gold glitter, I mean, beautiful.

[22:14] Right.

[22:15] But I look, and this show, I'm not showing J.J.P. I wouldn't buy 1,000, 1,500

[22:19] dollars with a mechanism being yanked out.

[22:21] I don't like companies going in that direction.

[22:23] I think you should always get more for the money, not less.

[22:26] I understand why he's doing it.

[22:28] I understand who the target is, but I would never buy a Yellow Brick Road edition.

[22:31] You're not the target.

[22:32] But here's the thing, and I said on this show, I just, I think, well, as is gorgeous,

[22:35] but when you flip Wonka, it's like it's such a better shooting Pimball machine.

[22:40] And again, but this is seven years.

[22:42] This company has learned from every game.

[22:45] And I think they're going to see that this is the culmination of everything this company

[22:49] has learned today.

[22:50] I'm not a Walsh fan.

[22:51] Now, I don't even like the wide body games.

[22:53] This is, we're going to get standard bodies from Pat Lawler, and you guys are going to fall

[22:57] in love.

[22:58] So, you know, I guess the thing now becomes the weight to get it.

[23:03] Are you okay like waiting a few months?

[23:06] Because that's jawless.

[23:07] So the big question now becomes, I hope Jack can just get the game on the line.

[23:12] I hope he can get it out in a couple months.

[23:14] That's the plan.

[23:16] What do you think people's reactions going?

[23:17] And my nervous that this, that you're going to actually sell about $66, and then you're

[23:21] going to use the void in our bedroom.

[23:23] Guys, it's in our bedroom.

[23:25] That corner is going to become the fetal position corner.

[23:27] That's it.

[23:28] It's the manic, I'm going to do a little circle.

[23:30] This is Canada's like manic depressed spot to sit in as I wait for Willy Wonka.

[23:34] Alright, so we're excited as a couple to get this game.

[23:37] And for many people out there, I know you guys go through the same journey where you want

[23:41] to get a game that your family and your wife will be into, but that you also will be

[23:44] into it.

[23:45] And I think that game is also going to check the boxes when it comes to that.

[23:49] So look, it's going to be a great summer for pinball.

[23:52] Do you think, Brendan, that if you look at the other pinball companies out there, not

[23:56] that you've studied them the way I do?

[23:58] But do you think this will be the new sort of standard by which other games will be measured?

[24:04] I don't really know what that question really means in terms of, I don't know what the

[24:07] current standard is.

[24:08] Right?

[24:09] Is there a current standard?

[24:10] Well, I mean, you saw the game on Friday, right?

[24:11] Yeah.

[24:12] Everyone will see the game this Friday.

[24:15] When people release new games now, do you think Wonka will be the game, people compare

[24:19] every new game to moving forward?

[24:22] As like, this is what we're looking for in pinball.

[24:25] Um, maybe.

[24:27] I don't think it's, it's not a black and white, yes or no answer.

[24:30] It really can't be because it depends on the team.

[24:32] It depends who's designing it, it depends on the artwork, it depends on the approach

[24:35] ability, it depends on like the flip ability.

[24:37] Is that even a word?

[24:38] Anyway, you know, how you could add the gameplay.

[24:40] Yeah.

[24:41] When people hear flipability, they think about me flipping games for a profit.

[24:45] That's also a bad idea.

[24:46] Not a bad idea.

[24:47] I'm glad you don't do that anymore.

[24:48] Um, okay, by the way, just confirm for everyone here.

[24:50] We are keeping Willy Wonka.

[24:52] I am not, I'm not pumping this game up and then flipping it.

[24:56] It's, this game will be in my apartment.

[24:59] I am not selling the collector's edition spot I have.

[25:02] It's a clear, okay, you know, I promise you brand it on our marriage on all the

[25:05] secrets.

[25:06] I also want you to have to go that way.

[25:07] Well, no, don't be that dramatic.

[25:08] I also want you to have Chicago gaming companies remaking a alien pinball.

[25:12] 100% confirmed.

[25:13] Oh, good.

[25:14] Um, oh, big lesson for you there.

[25:15] Oh my god.

[25:16] Anyway, that's not, that's not too long.

[25:18] Thank you guys.

[25:19] Yes, he is keeping it.

[25:21] Lots.

[25:22] Alright, so I guess the other thing I want to talk about and then we're going to,

[25:25] we're going to let these guys go.

[25:26] Yeah, so the one thing I want to talk about because we didn't just meet the new machine

[25:31] from Pat Lawler and team, I think a big part of our trip over to JJP was about meeting

[25:36] Jack and meeting the people inside the company.

[25:40] Now what did you think about Jack as a person and everyone you saw over there?

[25:45] I loved him.

[25:46] I want to get a cup of coffee with him.

[25:47] I would happily go over with the box of Ari's tea and some biscuits and sit down and have

[25:50] the chats.

[25:51] I mean, and he was such a gracious host to us.

[25:55] He really was.

[25:56] I mean, you, you, you think after all that I've said about Jersey Jack at times, you

[26:01] know, he even said to me, he's like, Chris, you know, I know you're passionate about

[26:04] pinball, but he's like, you've also been wrong about my company.

[26:07] He's like, I didn't go banker up three times.

[26:09] So Jack is fully aware of some of the things I've said about the company.

[26:13] I called you out on that as well.

[26:15] Yeah.

[26:16] You know, when we were walking out, even I think when we were walking in, I was like,

[26:18] this looks like a much bigger operation than you would ever kind of alluded to.

[26:23] And, you know, from what I've heard or heard you talking about in passing.

[26:26] Right.

[26:27] Certainly when we walked out.

[26:28] You know, I think what's hard for me, and this is the struggle that I go through with

[26:31] this podcast.

[26:32] And I said to Brenna, as we were walking around the factory, I said, you know, look, look

[26:36] at this, Brenna, look at all the hard work, look at all the parts, look at all the people,

[26:40] look at all the passion, look at all the enthusiasm they have.

[26:44] You know, it's really easy for me to grab a microphone and just tear down in organizations

[26:50] game, you know, tear them down as a company.

[26:53] It doesn't cost me anything.

[26:56] But I also feel like that's my, you know, that's, that's my struggle with this podcast is,

[27:02] but I want to be fair and I want to be honest and I want to give you my opinions about games.

[27:07] And you know me, and then, you know, for those of you who think, well, now I'm just going

[27:10] to say everything, J.J.P. is great.

[27:11] No, it's not about that.

[27:13] I've always been in search of the best games possible.

[27:16] I don't think you've been getting the best games possible for a very long time.

[27:21] And to me, I say this with all honesty.

[27:23] When I, after playing Willy Wonka, I did feel like part of what I've been in search of

[27:29] all these years is represented in that game.

[27:33] And I really could just put that game in my home and not go on Pinside every day and

[27:40] not be waiting to see what's next.

[27:42] I think a lot of why people wait to see what's next is they're really not satisfied with

[27:46] what they have today.

[27:48] It's kind of like when you get married to someone like Brenda, I don't wake up every day

[27:52] and be like, well, what, what woman can I get next?

[27:55] Thank God, that's...

[27:56] And I kind of want to marry Willy Wonka Pimble.

[27:59] And I think, for many of you out there, you know, who always just want to unbox the next

[28:04] game, I do think a lot of that drive to speculate what's next is not just because you're excited.

[28:08] I also think half of that is driven by your current disappointment that you know there

[28:13] could be more from Pimble.

[28:15] And I've been the most disappointed in Jersey Jack games to date because I've always felt

[28:20] like they were so close to greatness, but yet each one sort of fell down a little bit

[28:26] for me and I just didn't feel that way.

[28:28] And I feel the company has turned a corner and I can't wait for all you guys to see it

[28:31] on Friday.

[28:32] Brenda, do you think they're going to get...

[28:34] I don't know, do you think they're going to feel the same way when they see it?

[28:38] Yeah, I mean, I hope so.

[28:40] And you know, there's going to be people out there who just like to hate and love to

[28:43] hate and they're going to be people who find flaws, but sure.

[28:46] And that's with them.

[28:47] Right.

[28:48] Here's what I've done because I don't want to do another podcast between this one and

[28:53] Friday.

[28:54] He's like yesterday.

[28:56] I know there's going to be a long wait for you guys.

[28:59] And it's what, like, five days to go until you see Willy Wonka Pimble.

[29:05] Now what I've done is for me, I always feel like music is the other thing I love so much

[29:11] in life next to Pimble.

[29:13] And so what I've done is I've curated about a 45 minute or 50 minute just mix of songs

[29:20] that I think you guys will enjoy.

[29:22] For those of you who listen to this podcast, I always have like a fun intro song that's

[29:26] different each time.

[29:27] So I put together this little sort of...

[29:29] We'll call it the Willy Wonka, the wait for Wonka musical mix.

[29:33] And I'm going to upload it after this podcast and all it's going to be is the musical track.

[29:39] So you can download it.

[29:41] You can enjoy it.

[29:42] You can call me all sorts of names based upon the mix that I put together for you guys.

[29:47] But I hope you enjoy it.

[29:48] I don't think I've ever seen another Pimble podcast give people the gift of music.

[29:52] Do you think they'll like it, Brenda?

[29:54] I mean, I love your mixes and your brothers mixes.

[29:56] I think you guys come up with amazing, amazing mashups.

[29:59] So put it on in the background and enjoy it.

[30:03] I think you guys will get a kick out of it.

[30:05] And I would encourage everybody.

[30:06] Here's a deal.

[30:07] This is all about the new games we're going to see on Friday.

[30:10] It's about the Black Knight versus Willy Wonka.

[30:13] Why is it versus?

[30:14] Well, because it is versus.

[30:16] And Jack actually sent me an email this morning in which he said, you know, I think what

[30:19] people are going to see Friday is the DNA of both companies on display.

[30:25] You're going to see the best from the King, Steve Richie, the best he has to offer, working

[30:30] with Stern and what Stern's approach to Pimble is.

[30:33] And you're going to see the best from Pat Lawler and what the DNA of Jersey Jack is and the

[30:38] approach in which they take.

[30:40] And I'm not going to tell you right now what I think you're going to feel, but the reality

[30:45] is you're going to see, I think, what's at the core of each of these companies and you're

[30:51] going to make up your own mind on which one is the one for you and which one is the, you

[30:56] know, the company that is doing it the best way.

[30:58] Now, here's the other part, though, too, just to be fair.

[31:01] These are radically different games.

[31:02] I think one is going to be like fast and like a fast heavy metal concert like in Black

[31:06] Night and I think another is going to be like a trip to Disney World that you're never

[31:10] going to want to forget.

[31:11] And you definitely, you definitely can love both and you can own both.

[31:17] And maybe you want to and that's an awesome thing.

[31:20] But I think the question I'm curious to see how people respond is which one is giving

[31:24] you the greatest value.

[31:26] I think they're both going to be amazing Pimble machines.

[31:29] But when it comes to like one, they're both $9,000 sitting next to each other.

[31:33] It's going to be pretty interesting to see what the feedback is.

[31:36] But it's a great time, right, Brenna?

[31:38] We've never had two of the greatest historical designers of all time.

[31:41] Brenna's just like looking back like, yeah, great.

[31:42] She's like, she's like, oh, my friends are waiting to see what all are in which she

[31:46] do this this Friday.

[31:48] But we've never had a show in which both of the most iconic and legendary designers are

[31:53] having both of their games on display to flip for this at the same time.

[31:58] I love it.

[31:59] Like, this is like seven, eight years in the making Jersey Jack and Stern colliding at

[32:05] the Midwest gaming classic.

[32:07] Two of their best designers giving their best efforts forward.

[32:12] What a time.

[32:13] What a time.

[32:14] Are you as excited, Brenna?

[32:15] What are we doing for brunch today?

[32:17] I'm a kind of a tour of my Moses.

[32:19] Oh, I think it's great.

[32:21] I mean, guys, I've now been whether I want to or not.

[32:25] I've been exposed to this hobby for the last five years.

[32:28] And I definitely see there has been an upward trajectory.

[32:30] There's been a lot of positive movement, but there's also been a lot of like lessons learned

[32:33] and stuff.

[32:34] So yeah, maybe you are right.

[32:35] Maybe this is the point in which it all comes to life.

[32:38] You've got two different companies, two very different approaches, two great designers,

[32:42] things like that, whatever.

[32:43] Two very different themes too.

[32:44] So I mean, the people will speak when they see them both and flip them both.

[32:49] Absolutely.

[32:50] Well, guys, it's going to be an exciting Friday.

[32:52] You're not going to get another show from me.

[32:54] I swear to God.

[32:55] Does this also mean you're not going to be on responding or doing research?

[33:00] Are you taking five days off?

[33:01] No, no, no, I'm always reading.

[33:02] But here's the thing.

[33:03] We have a very special birthday party we have to go to Friday night.

[33:07] So I'm also most likely not going to be watching the reveal live of Wonka.

[33:13] So I'm excited though.

[33:14] You know what I'm going to be doing?

[33:15] Is it the way you asked if there was a TV in the room?

[33:17] No, I was booking.

[33:19] What I'm going to be doing when that moment happens, I'm going to sit in a chair.

[33:24] I'm going to get a glass of Louis Trey and a cigar.

[33:27] And I'm going to put my feet up and just light the cigar and just have the biggest grin

[33:33] in my face as all of you see for the first time, Willy Wonka.

[33:37] And you realize that it is what you've all been dreaming about all these years in Pimbo.

[33:43] And I can't wait.

[33:44] You guys are going to be just like so excited.

[33:47] You're going to want to get your orders in.

[33:49] And I think you're also going to like and love Black Knight for like, you know, it's going

[33:52] to be I think the game Richie wanted to make all these years too.

[33:55] I think it's a great time to see these two games at the same time in Pimbo.

[33:59] So everyone, enjoy the musical mix.

[34:02] If you didn't listen to this podcast and you're like, why the fuck is there a music mix

[34:06] on Canada's Pimbo podcast?

[34:07] Oh, also I just cursed.

[34:09] Someone's friend has sent me an email being like, why can't you make your podcast family

[34:13] friendly?

[34:15] This was for the most part.

[34:17] But I'm pretty good.

[34:18] I used to work for again at one point.

[34:19] Is that a curse?

[34:20] I don't know.

[34:21] I used to teach my mom with that mouth.

[34:22] My mother's a cilian.

[34:23] Like you guys have no idea.

[34:24] She would talk about assault.

[34:25] My mom would beat me with a wooden spoon my whole childhood.

[34:28] Maybe that's why I'm so manic depressed.

[34:30] Anyway, Brenda, thank you for joining any last words to the listeners of the show.
