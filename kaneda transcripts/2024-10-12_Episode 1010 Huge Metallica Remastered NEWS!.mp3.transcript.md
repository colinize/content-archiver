[00:00] Got insane from the pain that they surely know.

[00:06] For whom the bells tolls?

[00:10] Time marks his eye.

[00:14] For whom the bells tolls?

[00:17] C'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya.

[00:21] Alright, Kanata, what are you doing all these shows for?

[00:24] You're shaming people on Facebook that they spend more on a cup of coffee than Kanata's

[00:30] Bimbal Podcast costs for an entire month and you know you're getting your money's worth

[00:36] and some of you are even in the Omokase Club.

[00:38] $30 a month, we would love to go out and have Omokase with you if you are ever near Kanata.

[00:44] Alright, on this episode, let's talk about Metallica before we get to it and I've got

[00:49] some exclusive information on Metallica.

[00:53] It's why you're here, like nobody else does this, like you never hear any breaking news

[00:59] on any Bimbal Podcast like Kanata because you know people just love to whisper in my

[01:05] ear.

[01:06] Before we get there, I want to talk about Chicago Expo, what's going to be going on

[01:10] at the show.

[01:12] It's right upon us and I think a lot of people are really looking forward to this show.

[01:17] I'm so bummed out, I cannot be there.

[01:20] If you have never been to a Bimbal show, it's always a lot of fun because of the people.

[01:26] If you have never been to like TPF or Expo, you're never going to really experience the

[01:31] beauty of the community until you meet people in real life and I'm just going to say this

[01:37] right now.

[01:38] I've been to every major Bimbal show and the most prolific people that post on Pinside,

[01:44] Iceman, Rare Hero, Crazy Levy, well Levy goes to some shows but for the most part, the

[01:52] loud mouths on Pinside are usually never anywhere to be found at the shows in which people

[02:00] are all getting along.

[02:02] I reached out to Greg yesterday, Rare Hero because he's in the Alice thread every single

[02:07] day, like chiming in with how much he hates the game, hates Dutch Bimbal and I asked him,

[02:12] man, what's the end game for this with a guy like you?

[02:16] You have to really pop in every single day and then he gets a little bit upset that I'm

[02:21] policing his behavior on a forum and it dawned on me why Pinside has become so bad lately

[02:29] and over the last few years, there's absolutely no moderation.

[02:33] There's no moderation.

[02:34] It's like every time there's a hype thread, the trolls pull up in a double decker bus

[02:39] and they just park it there for like months and just slam everyone who's excited about the game.

[02:46] And here's the thing, I get it if you don't like something about a game or a company and

[02:52] you want to have your opinion heard.

[02:55] The problem with the way Pinside is set up and I know this, all these hyper posters,

[03:00] they're closet narcissistic people that just want to be heard.

[03:05] They want the attention, right?

[03:06] That's the whole point.

[03:07] They want to see how many thumbs ups they can get.

[03:10] And yeah, I know this all too well because I'm not a closet narcissistic pinball poster.

[03:15] I was that on a surface level because that's what it's all about.

[03:19] I want to take this thread and I want to make it about me and my opinions and my feelings

[03:25] need to be heard over everybody else's and the way Robin has structured the site in which

[03:30] like after a certain number of posts, you go to a new page and that is why these people

[03:36] like live there forever because if I said something that I believe to be true on page

[03:42] 43, I've got to say it again on page 44, 45 and no one's going to moderate me and I can

[03:49] be redundant over and over and over again.

[03:51] I wish these people would just start a podcast or a Facebook page because when I make a statement

[03:56] about a game, whether I like it or not or I want to make an observation, I can put it

[04:01] up on Patreon and my feelings and my sentiments, they live a lot longer than they would on

[04:07] a pin side page.

[04:09] If I put up something on my cover image on Facebook, 3,000 people or more will see how

[04:15] I feel about something and I don't have to keep writing it over and over again in a pin

[04:20] side thread.

[04:21] And I think that's what makes that site so unbearable at times, but they're not going

[04:25] to change.

[04:26] They're not going to change.

[04:27] They're going to change about the behavior by these hyper posters and I'm talking about

[04:31] the people with like 20, 30,000 posts on pin side.

[04:35] They could have penned a novel with that many posts.

[04:38] Most of them work from home.

[04:41] They're on their computer all day long.

[04:43] Some of them are retired.

[04:44] Some of them have remote jobs and they literally are just on pin side all day long.

[04:50] All right.

[04:51] So before we get to this Metallica news, let's talk about pinball expo 2024.

[04:57] Now this show and I've been to it before it's in maybe the worst area of Chicago.

[05:04] It's in Shamburg, Illinois.

[05:07] And if you've ever been there before, you're not going to Chicago, right?

[05:11] The word Chicago should be nowhere near this show and its location.

[05:17] I think it's like 30 to 40 minutes outside of downtown Chicago.

[05:22] There's nothing really around it.

[05:24] When I went there last time, I would have loved to have brought the Canada club to Omokase.

[05:29] There's no Omokase anywhere near Shamburg, Illinois.

[05:34] And also if you've been to a show before and I just mean this, like if you've been to a

[05:38] show, you have to understand one thing.

[05:41] You're going to see the entire show in just a couple hours and I mean that like not even

[05:47] like in one hour, you could easily laugh and walk the show and you'll see everything.

[05:53] You'll see the vendors and there's a lot of vendors this year.

[05:57] I mean, there's a ton.

[05:58] You'll see all the games and you're going to be doing laps around the show consistently

[06:04] to the point where your feet are hurting and to the point where you're like, do I go up

[06:09] to the room now and just take a break?

[06:11] And for the newbies, here's the mistake the newbies make.

[06:15] They go to the show on day one all the way through to the end.

[06:19] And I'm just going to say this, if you're going Tuesday through Sunday, you're going

[06:24] to be so over it by like end of day Thursday.

[06:29] I mean it.

[06:30] It's just too much.

[06:32] I highly recommend whenever you're booking a show, the most amount of time you ever need

[06:38] at any pinball show is two days max, like two full days at the show.

[06:46] You could probably get away with just one full day.

[06:49] Now I know there's different highlights and seminars and factory tours, but trust me,

[06:55] you will get burnt out.

[06:57] The fun part is seeing all your pinball friends and seeing your homies and going out to meals

[07:03] and all these grown men are acting like they are in college again and the wives are nowhere

[07:09] to be found and you're in this like convention center.

[07:11] And that's the thing I like about expo kind of because it's so contained.

[07:15] These really go in anywhere.

[07:16] Like you'll go to the factory tours, but for the most part, everyone's there most of the

[07:21] time.

[07:22] And that's what I like about expo.

[07:23] It's not nearly as big as TPF.

[07:26] So if you've been the TPF, do not expect that size of a show.

[07:30] All right.

[07:31] So here are the highlights of what's going to be happening at pinball expo this year on

[07:35] Tuesday, Chicago gaming factory tour OMG.

[07:40] Like if you're going to go into Chicago gaming company on Tuesday, how do you ask any other

[07:46] question then where the hell are the pulp fiction L.E.s?

[07:51] It's crazy to me that they're even going to let people inside that factory when they have

[07:57] spent over two years and not delivered those damn L.E.s.

[08:02] And then there is a galloping ghost arcade visit.

[08:06] I don't know how that's a highlight.

[08:08] The galloping ghost arcade is amazing, but it's always open to the public on Wednesday.

[08:14] We've got October 16th Logan arcade.

[08:17] Okay.

[08:18] Another just arcade open to the public.

[08:20] Not sure why that's a highlight.

[08:22] There is the company I will not speak about factory tour.

[08:26] I just, I won't even speak about this company.

[08:29] And then there is enterium bumper blast, whatever that is some tournament there.

[08:35] And then on Thursday, right?

[08:37] Tuesday is really where the show starts.

[08:39] I mean this, if you go Tuesday and Wednesday, you really are sort of like, just why did

[08:45] I come here so early?

[08:47] You can see it.

[08:48] Like when you go to the show on Friday, you can see which people arrived on Tuesday and

[08:54] which people just arrived.

[08:56] Like when people come in Thursday, you're coming in fresh, you're coming in hot, you're coming

[09:00] in on the right day.

[09:01] I would even argue Friday, Saturday is the best.

[09:03] But when you look at people on a Thursday who came in on a Tuesday, they're already

[09:08] wiped out.

[09:09] So Thursday you've got the Jersey Jack pinball factory tour.

[09:12] I think you guys will enjoy that.

[09:14] And then the seminars begin on Friday.

[09:17] You've got the Stern pinball factory tour.

[09:19] And I'm just going to say this right now.

[09:20] For those of you going back and forth between JJP and Stern, I think there is going to be

[09:27] no greater way for you to really understand how it is still David versus Goliath.

[09:35] I mean, it's no comparison.

[09:38] The moment you step foot into the lobby of each company, you will understand and you

[09:45] will just be blown away by Stern pinballs facility, its factory.

[09:51] It is so legit on every single level.

[09:55] Not to take anything away, but Jersey Jack's place is more of just a factory.

[10:00] There's no real lobby.

[10:01] You walk in, there's a few games on the left, and then there's just a cubicle farm, and

[10:06] then it's the factory.

[10:07] It really is all factory.

[10:08] Like there's absolutely no showroom.

[10:11] There's nothing else.

[10:12] When you go to Stern, Jersey Jack's entire facility could fit inside the lobby of Stern

[10:19] pinball.

[10:21] That's how big Stern pinball is.

[10:23] I think when you see them both, you're going to realize why nobody should even try to go

[10:28] at Stern when it comes to volume and mass producing games.

[10:33] Jersey Jack should become the company that it needs to be, which is limited high-end

[10:38] games.

[10:39] I still think Jersey Jack should never even say in a million years they're going to make

[10:42] 5,000 units of anything.

[10:45] They need to stop that.

[10:46] They need to say we're going to make 500 CEs and maybe 2,000 LEs, and that's it.

[10:51] We're going to make 500 games max on anything we make and move on to the next.

[10:56] They still will not embrace that.

[10:58] You don't want to sell 6,000 games if you're Jersey Jack of one title, because then you'll

[11:02] be making it for three years and it messes everything up.

[11:06] Stern can sell 6,000 games because they can make those games in six months.

[11:10] All right, so then we go.

[11:11] There's more seminars.

[11:12] Here's the thing is, I don't even think the event hall is open until Thursday.

[11:18] If you're in early, I don't even think there's much for you to do.

[11:22] The event hall opens at noon on Thursday and then it goes all the way to midnight.

[11:28] I think they changed that, which is good because it used to open later or something on these

[11:32] days and people complain.

[11:33] On Friday, you've got the Stern Factory tour.

[11:36] You've got the event hall opens on 10 a.m. to midnight.

[11:39] Then Saturday, by Saturday, man, everybody is just wiped, but everyone's going to be

[11:45] there.

[11:46] You're going to be a really banger of a show.

[11:49] You're going to have all these people from Stern, JJP.

[11:53] I heard Abba's going to be there, the Pinball Brothers.

[11:56] I think every single game that you can buy new in box will be represented at the show.

[12:03] Of course, Alice will be there, Avatar, X-Men, Abba.

[12:07] Man, even as I say these themes and these titles, where are the great themes?

[12:13] Where are the great themes?

[12:14] I also want to just, for people who have not been to shows, just reiterate, we're going

[12:20] to get a lot of feedback from people playing all these new games.

[12:24] The one problem with playing a game at a show for the first time, do you know what it is?

[12:30] It is actually the worst environment imaginable to experience a new pinball machine.

[12:37] It is so loud and deafening, you can't really hear the game.

[12:42] That'll go to the benefit of Avatar because you can't hear the clips anyway because they're

[12:47] muted and now it kind of sucks because if they added voices into those clips, you're

[12:52] not going to be able to hear them.

[12:54] Everybody going to the show, bring headphones that can be plugged in with a wire because

[13:00] you can plug into Jersey Jack games at a show.

[13:03] I can't underscore enough that that is a game changer if you want to hear and experience

[13:10] Avatar for the first time.

[13:12] You cannot do that with X-Men.

[13:15] You cannot do that with Alice.

[13:17] You cannot do that with mostly any other game on the market.

[13:21] It is a huge benefit that Jersey Jack allows you to experience their games in the best

[13:27] way in person.

[13:29] Just realize that is you're going to be playing these games.

[13:32] There's going to be people behind you, anxious to get on.

[13:35] That takes away from some of the enjoyment.

[13:38] There's going to be Wankos who start a four player game by themselves.

[13:41] Yep, that happens at a show.

[13:44] There's just going to be a lot of noise and your feet are going to hurt.

[13:47] What you will get a sense of gameplay, how does the game move?

[13:52] How does the game feel?

[13:54] There's always that excuse that at shows there's so much power happening at the show.

[13:58] All those games are on.

[14:00] The show's power might drain the flipper power of the game.

[14:04] We hear that a lot when games have weak flippers at shows.

[14:08] It's the excuse that the power and the wattage can't handle all these games.

[14:13] But I do think it's going to be really good to finally get time on most of these games

[14:19] because I think with most of these games, all we've had from everybody on Pinside is

[14:24] a bunch of opinions and nobody's played them.

[14:27] Now, if I were these pinball manufacturers and I don't think anybody really does this,

[14:32] there should be when you look at the list of things that are happening at the show.

[14:37] You know the one thing that's not happening at Pinball Expo?

[14:40] It's the biggest problem I have with all of these shows.

[14:45] Think about it like this.

[14:46] There are more people that will ever follow what's happening at Expo on the internet.

[14:53] There are more people not going to the show than are going to the show.

[14:59] Here's what the show does not provide.

[15:01] For all of the pinball content creators and pinball media that have thousands of people

[15:06] that follow them, there is no moment where the media get to get in early and are allowed

[15:14] to play these games for like an hour or so.

[15:18] They're not allowed to play these games, uninterrupt it while they speak to the company and their

[15:23] representatives.

[15:25] They don't get to have an experience that's any different than the mass public.

[15:30] If you remember a few years ago, I snuck into Expo before it was open to the public.

[15:37] I paid for my ticket.

[15:38] The reason I snuck in early and was hanging out with all the manufacturers and the vendors

[15:44] and that pissed off the show organizers is I wanted to capture footage before all the

[15:50] people came in.

[15:52] I wanted to play the games and get an opinion about them in the right way so I could hear

[15:57] them and I could feel them and I could sense them and it was so much more rewarding.

[16:02] I think that is a big thing that's missing.

[16:04] You just don't give any of the media an opportunity to see these games properly.

[16:10] If I was a pinball manufacturer and I knew that all these pinball media and influencers

[16:16] and people were converging on Expo, I would open up early and I would talk to the organizers

[16:23] of the show.

[16:24] If the show opens at noon on a Thursday, I would invite all the media in there at 11.

[16:30] If the show opens at 10 a.m. on Friday, Saturday, then have media come in early on so they can

[16:38] experience the game in the right way.

[16:41] That's that.

[16:42] All right, Chris, what the heck show is this?

[16:45] You're making me listen to 20 minutes of you ramble on about how Greg Colton won't shut

[16:52] up in the Alice thread about how Pinball Expo is way too many days in a row and they don't

[16:58] cater to the media.

[16:59] We want to hear about Metallica.

[17:01] I know how to do content, gang.

[17:03] You leave the best for the end.

[17:05] It's why the weather is always at the end of a news show because most people tune in for

[17:10] the weather.

[17:11] All right, so here's the deal.

[17:13] Hot off the press.

[17:14] Nobody knows this.

[17:15] I haven't heard this anywhere else.

[17:17] So what we do know is this.

[17:20] Metallica Remastered is next.

[17:22] It will be shown at Pinball Expo.

[17:25] Will it be on the show floor?

[17:27] I don't know.

[17:28] I think it might be shown during the Stern Factory tour.

[17:32] I am not sure it's going to be on the floor at Expo and for obvious reasons, they still

[17:39] want to sell as many X-Men's as they can.

[17:43] So showing it at the Factory tour is a lot smarter, I think, than bringing it also to

[17:49] the show.

[17:50] I think they're going to want to let Jack Danger and his amazing game have the center

[17:54] stage.

[17:55] If they wheel out a new Metallica on top of that, I think it takes a lot of thunder away

[18:01] from Jack Danger and no pun intended.

[18:04] But if this is an anniversary edition for Ride the Lightning, are they going to steal

[18:08] Jack Danger's thunder?

[18:10] It is definitely happening.

[18:12] It is definitely being shown.

[18:13] Now you know this because I've told you this for months.

[18:17] Now something else we know is that it is going to come out in a premium form, $9,500.

[18:24] It's not going to be more expensive than the current premium trim.

[18:28] We also know there's going to be a new artist on the game.

[18:30] It is not Dirty Donnie.

[18:32] We know it will have an LCD.

[18:34] It's not going to have a DMD.

[18:36] But here's what you don't know.

[18:38] And here's why you subscribe every month.

[18:41] And now, knowing what you're about to know, it's worth a discussion about what is this

[18:46] game really going to be?

[18:48] So I'm here to tell you for the first time ever as a world exclusive from Canada's Pinball

[18:53] Podcast, take this to Pinside and make sure you spell the name right, that Metallica will

[18:59] be coming out with two different versions.

[19:03] It is going to come out as a studio game.

[19:06] And what they mean by that as a studio game, it just means that there's no pro version

[19:11] of the game.

[19:12] So it's going to be a studio game like Elvira.

[19:16] There's no Elvira pro, right?

[19:18] They didn't yank anything out of a pro version.

[19:20] There's going to be a premium of Metallica.

[19:23] And now I'm here to tell you people, there's going to be an LE of the game.

[19:28] Yes, there will be a $13,000, LE limited edition version of the new John Borges Metallica remastered.

[19:40] Now, that changes everything in my honest opinion.

[19:46] Because Stern Pinball said that they will never, ever, ever make a limited edition game

[19:53] if they've already made a limited edition version of that game.

[19:59] It's why Godzilla 70th, which was supposed to be an LE, ended up becoming a Godzilla

[20:07] premium because they didn't want to screw over the LE buyers.

[20:11] Now the original John Borges Metallica has an LE version of the game.

[20:17] I feel like there were two LE versions of the game back then.

[20:21] So if Stern is on the record for saying they're never, ever doing that again, releasing a new

[20:28] LE when existing LEs exist, what does that mean?

[20:32] It either means they're lying about that statement and this is going to be a remake of the classic

[20:39] Metallica game with new artwork, or it means that this is a fully new Metallica game.

[20:47] I mean, it's not a remake of the John Borges game that John Borges went and made an entirely

[20:54] new Metallica game.

[20:57] Now I think the latter is going to be what we see this week.

[21:01] I don't think it's going to be a one-to-one remake at all.

[21:05] I think Borg might have gone and redid the game.

[21:09] I think it could be an all-new Metallica game and that sort of makes more sense.

[21:15] You've got 6,000 people that already own the old Metallica.

[21:19] Does the world need more of that layout and of that game?

[21:23] There's so many out there.

[21:25] So this changes everything.

[21:28] If it's an all-new game, is it going to still have the Lyman sheets code, which is one of

[21:33] the greatest codes in the history of Pimbal?

[21:37] And the answer is maybe, right?

[21:39] Maybe because think about it.

[21:41] They might have been able to take that code, take those moments and connect it to the new

[21:46] game.

[21:47] And I'm thinking what Borg might have done is this.

[21:49] I think he might have taken the original game and just made changes.

[21:54] Maybe he added some toys or mechs to the game.

[21:58] Maybe he changed the way the ramps work.

[22:00] Maybe Sparky's in there.

[22:02] Maybe he's in a different location.

[22:03] You know what I'm saying?

[22:04] I think he might have done an all-new layout and it might be heavily inspired by the original

[22:09] game, but I think he's taking it up a level.

[22:12] He's taking it up a notch.

[22:14] It's like Metallica 2.0, Metallica Remastered.

[22:17] Like we're taking elements you loved in that game, but we're designing an all-new game.

[22:22] And look, because there's going to be an LE, Stern would be flat out lying to us when they

[22:28] said they're never doing more LEs on top of old designs.

[22:32] They did it on Metallica.

[22:34] And I don't think George Gomez is going to be caught in a bold face live.

[22:38] So I'm here to tell you right now.

[22:40] Metallica at Expo, a premium and a $13,000 LE.

[22:45] This means there is most likely going to be an all-originally new designed Metallica game

[22:51] that everybody sees at Expo next week.

[22:54] This is why you subscribe to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[22:57] This is why you love this show.

[22:59] And I just want to say for the record, it's also why you should

[23:02] join the Patreon chat.

[23:03] Because unlike Pinside, it is the best place to talk about everything going on in pinball.

[23:09] I mean it.

[23:10] It is so much fun being on there.

[23:12] We debate everything.

[23:13] We talk about shoes.

[23:15] We talk about art.

[23:16] We talk about beer.

[23:17] We talk about pinball.

[23:18] Now, it's mostly about pinball until Canada starts sharing his shoe collection.

[23:22] But everybody, look, have a happy Saturday.

[23:24] I'll be back in just a couple hours with the Saturday morning spectacular.

[23:29] I give you way too much for the money.

[23:31] I think everyone who's at $5 a month right now, you know who you are.

[23:34] You know who you are.

[23:35] You're at $5 a month for all of this content that keeps coming.

[23:40] I came at you guys, even when I was on OxyCodyne and I was recovering from surgery.

[23:46] That was painful.

[23:47] And you know, you know, you want to just go from five to 10.

[23:52] I'm not going to force you, but it would be really nice on the next few shows for me

[23:57] to give shout outs to the Raise the Roof Club.

[24:00] Yes, I will give each and every one of you who raises their subscription from five to anything,

[24:06] five to 10, five to 30, 30 to 100.

[24:08] If you do it, I'm going to start doing the Raise the Roof shout outs and give each of

[24:12] you a personal shout out on the show.

[24:15] Thank you so much.

[24:16] I love you guys.

[24:18] Have fun at Expo.
