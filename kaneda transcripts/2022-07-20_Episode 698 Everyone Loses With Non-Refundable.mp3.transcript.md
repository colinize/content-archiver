[00:00] I'm lying to bed, just like Brian Wilson did.

[00:04] Oh, well I am, I'm lying to bed, just like Brian Wilson did.

[00:13] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:30] We hit the nail on the head.

[00:31] Stern doesn't do this, right?

[00:33] They don't release a game at a show.

[00:35] They normally put out a teaser, then they have a call with all the dealers and distributors,

[00:41] and then they reveal the game.

[00:43] So they are obviously coming back to conventions with their big sort of pinball setup, like

[00:49] they've got that Stern arcade, and that's why the image that they're teasing is a blurred

[00:55] image of the Mandalorian.

[00:58] So Stern Pinball is going to be a comic con.

[01:00] They're going to be with Ozzy Osbourne and Todd McFarland, and maybe a little tease Venom,

[01:06] but I don't think we're going to see the game, and that means we're going to have to wait.

[01:11] And I know we were all so excited to finally get past this period of waiting for Stern to

[01:17] get us a new game, and we're not going to talk more about Toy Story, so what do I want

[01:22] to talk about on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast?

[01:25] The thing I want to talk about on this episode is I think we've all learned a lesson in pinball.

[01:31] And I think, you know, as I look at what's happening with some of these companies and

[01:35] the news over at Multimorphic that Jerry's having a hard time finding workers, and if

[01:40] you ordered a weird owl, you have no idea when you're getting your game, and yet you

[01:46] gave a $2,000 deposit.

[01:49] Some of you gave $2,000 on Ultraman and Halloween, and you don't want the game now.

[01:54] Some of you gave $2,500 on Toy Story, and you might not want the game now.

[01:59] I want to talk a little bit about two things.

[02:01] I want to talk about the ethics of a manufacturer announcing and revealing a game, taking your

[02:08] money, and then giving you absolutely no real timeline on when you can expect your game,

[02:16] and basically turning consumers into kick starters.

[02:20] Like you are no longer buying a product, you are now investing in a company.

[02:25] So I want to talk about that, and I also just want to talk about the history of nonrefundable

[02:31] deposits.

[02:32] For some of you out there, you might not remember when it all started, and I want to talk about

[02:36] where do we go from here.

[02:38] Because obviously this system is set in place to try to prevent people from like scalping

[02:43] machines.

[02:44] I get that part of it.

[02:45] You can protect manufacturers from over-ordering parts, or maybe making custom machines that

[02:50] people then don't want.

[02:52] And you could argue that for consumers it's meant to sort of secure your spot.

[02:56] But I think over the last year and a half, I think all of us are now realizing that these

[03:01] nonrefundable deposits aren't really working well for anybody.

[03:06] Like everyone's losing.

[03:08] I'm going to explain why everyone's losing in this situation.

[03:11] And I know it might not seem obvious that the manufacturers are losing as well, but

[03:15] I'm going to explain why I think they're losing as well.

[03:18] Now let's go back to sort of P3 Multimorphic, because I was listening to Zach's show, and

[03:23] I know Jerry's been telling people that they're having a really hard time finding people to

[03:28] join Multimorphic, work in the middle of nowhere Texas, probably work for minimum wage, and

[03:36] then do a very highly skilled job like putting together a pinball machine.

[03:41] Why would anybody want this job?

[03:43] It is really hard to find line workers to make pinball machines.

[03:49] It's a lot easier to design a prototype, to get people excited, to bring said prototype

[03:55] to shows, and then to get like 300 orders on the machine.

[03:59] It's a lot harder to then find people to put together those 300 machines.

[04:05] When you look at a pinball machine and you think about all the elements that have to

[04:08] go together to make an assembly line, it's a really, really ginormous headache on a manufacturing

[04:15] level.

[04:16] And that's why Stern Pinball does it so well.

[04:18] I think Jersey Jack has learned the hard way how to become more effective and efficient.

[04:24] There's still nowhere near where Stern is at.

[04:26] And everyone else, when you look at the photos, like look at the photos at American Pinball.

[04:30] Have we seen any photos from CGC?

[04:32] You know, I think Spooky's the other one who actually has like their assembly line figured

[04:36] out.

[04:37] When you see Spooky Pinball and they show you behind the scenes, there's always people

[04:41] there.

[04:42] There's always machines lined up.

[04:43] But when it comes to everybody else, when it comes to all the other boutiques, when

[04:46] we see their assembly lines, you never really see people.

[04:50] You never see a lot of activity.

[04:52] It feels like a very, very slow burn to make a game.

[04:56] But here's the part that I'm taking issue with.

[04:58] If you're Jerry Stelenberg and you know you've got weird Al, you know you're going to sell

[05:02] like a few hundred of them, you finally have a licensed theme, it overlaps nicely with the

[05:08] Pinball fan base, you know you're going to sell the machines.

[05:11] So why did you reveal a game when you knew you were like maybe six or more months away

[05:19] from being able to really turn on the assembly line?

[05:22] And here we are almost six months later since the game was revealed.

[05:26] I think it's been like five months, right?

[05:28] He revealed it right before TPF.

[05:30] So it's like March, April, May, June, July.

[05:34] So five months later, we are now hearing that they're having issues getting people to work

[05:39] at Multimorphic.

[05:41] Shouldn't you have figured out those issues before he revealed the game?

[05:45] And now if you put a deposit down on this game, you didn't buy your game.

[05:50] Your money is now going to try to find like resources to actually build your game.

[05:55] Your money is going to go to rent.

[05:57] Your money is going to go to vendors.

[05:59] Your money is going to go to a human resource person trying to find temp workers.

[06:03] Like all of that costs money.

[06:04] Like it costs money to go to a temp agency.

[06:07] It costs money to train people.

[06:09] It costs money to find employees.

[06:12] And so then your margins get smaller and smaller and smaller.

[06:15] But my thing is this, I think it was just unprofessional.

[06:19] And on some level, it's just getting to this point.

[06:21] On some level with these boutique companies that keep taking your money so far in advance,

[06:27] it's becoming unethical to do it that way.

[06:30] And look, everyone is a buyer.

[06:32] You guys have all the power, right?

[06:34] This holds true for not just this topic, but also for the nonrefundable deposit topic we're

[06:39] going to talk about is that we ultimately have all of the power.

[06:42] Like nobody's making us buy these things.

[06:45] Nobody needs to put a deposit down.

[06:47] Like right now, you could still go get a weird owl LE.

[06:51] There are distributors that still have a spot for sale.

[06:55] But what's the point in even like putting your money up or waiting a year and risking

[06:59] it all?

[07:00] Why?

[07:01] Why?

[07:02] You know, I was talking to a friend yesterday about Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition, right?

[07:04] Remember all the hoopla, how hard it was to get one and it was like $18,000 and you

[07:08] felt like you missed out?

[07:09] Well here we are a year and a half later and you can go get a Guns N' Roses Collector's

[07:14] Edition for just a couple thousand dollars more than it was new.

[07:19] Like the prices come all the way back down and you could have invested that money.

[07:23] You've could have made money off of your $12,500 and then you wouldn't even have had to really

[07:26] spend anything more.

[07:28] But you would have removed a few things from the scenario.

[07:31] You would have removed a few things.

[07:33] You would have removed the risk, right?

[07:35] You would have removed the risk of maybe like paying way more than the game is worth.

[07:38] Like if you paid $18,000, $19,000 for a G&R CE, right now you're probably regretting

[07:44] it a little bit because you can get it for cheaper.

[07:46] You also would have known you liked the game because you could have waited for the code

[07:50] to be finalized.

[07:52] You could have jumped on the machine and you could have played it for a year and then decided

[07:56] if you wanted to buy it.

[07:58] Pretty much every single pinball machine remains available.

[08:02] And I think we're all starting to realize that like maybe, just maybe, chasing after the

[08:07] new and box craze is actually biting us all.

[08:11] It was a lot of fun years ago to chase after all the new and box games and to think about

[08:16] buying them and to think about the potential to enjoy them.

[08:19] And look, yes, there was always the potential to flip the machines and make some money if

[08:23] you wanted to do a quick flip.

[08:25] Those days are over.

[08:26] It's just not really happening anymore.

[08:28] Now look, is there still room to quick flip some things for a few thousand dollars?

[08:32] Yes, but only if the game is amazing.

[08:35] Like only if the game is like Godzilla.

[08:38] Like nobody's flipping Rush Ali for a few thousand dollars.

[08:41] But if you have Godzilla new and box, you can flip it for a few thousand dollars over

[08:44] a sticker.

[08:45] You might get three to four thousand dollars, but we're also talking about one of the best

[08:48] pinball machines of all time.

[08:50] That's not going to happen with Venom.

[08:51] You're not going to be able to flip Venom for the same price as Godzilla, right?

[08:55] You're not going to be able to flip.

[08:56] Let's say they make Foo Fighters.

[08:58] That's not going to be a game you're going to flip from like 11.5 for 16.5.

[09:02] It's just not going to happen, especially with the fact that now everyone's realizing

[09:05] there's a thousand of them with a thousand le's out there, a thousand CEs.

[09:10] There's no room to flip.

[09:11] And my point being is if you just wait, you can go get the game.

[09:15] You'll be able to go get a fathom from Haggis a year from now for not much more than sticker.

[09:20] You'll be able to go get weird out a year from now for not much over sticker.

[09:24] And so it begs the question as a community, aren't we over being kick starters for all

[09:30] these boutique companies?

[09:32] Aren't we over these companies revealing games way too early?

[09:36] And it's not just Haggis.

[09:38] It's not just multi-morphic.

[09:40] It's CGC.

[09:41] This practice of revealing a game and then making your customers wait almost a year to

[09:47] get it is absolutely a name.

[09:50] And I don't know about you, but I would totally be exhausted and over this practice.

[09:56] And the other part is this.

[09:57] It's like if you're going to take someone's money and then make them wait forever and

[10:01] a day and then there's no way to get a refund, that's the part that I just don't like.

[10:08] You all remember where non-refundable deposits happened in Pimbal?

[10:12] Now I've been covering this hobby for like seven years now.

[10:14] And there was one game in which it started it all.

[10:17] There was one company that started it all.

[10:19] Do you know which company it was?

[10:21] It was Spooky Pimbal.

[10:22] It was Spooky Pimbal.

[10:23] And I believe it was Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle was the first game where it was non-refundable

[10:29] deposits.

[10:30] It might have been Rob Zombie, but I think it was Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle in which

[10:34] they made, I believe, 500 of them.

[10:37] And the reason why they did it, because on Rob Zombie, they allowed people to customize

[10:43] their games.

[10:44] They allowed people to pick different armor and different this and different that.

[10:49] And what was happening was people were ordering their games a specific way and then they bailed

[10:55] on the game.

[10:56] And Spooky was left with a spot that they needed to sell, but more importantly, they

[11:01] were left with a customized version of the game.

[11:04] And they basically said with Alice Cooper's, all deposits are non-refundable because we're

[11:10] going to order your game parts specifically for your game.

[11:14] So if you wanted a butter cabinet and you wanted the different colored armor, we were

[11:18] going to make that many and then you can't get your money back because we're basically

[11:22] building a custom machine for you.

[11:25] And so that's where it all started on Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[11:29] And now we've seen this practice adopted by more companies.

[11:34] We're seeing Jersey Jack do it.

[11:36] We're seeing Haggis do it.

[11:37] We saw Dutch Pinball do it.

[11:40] We've seen a lot of people do this.

[11:43] People forget like back in the day, Andrew Highway, when he was giving everyone run-arounds

[11:48] on alien production, all the deposits were refundable.

[11:52] Now he blames the refunds on the reason why the company went under.

[11:55] He doesn't blame himself for his own inefficiency or his own ineptitude.

[12:00] He blamed it on the fact that people wanted their money back.

[12:03] But I just haven't seen another industry.

[12:05] And I think I'm over this whole thing where like in Pinball, we now have no ability to

[12:10] get our money back.

[12:11] We also have basically no warranty on any of these products.

[12:15] If you read the warranty on your Pinball machine, there is absolutely almost nothing covered

[12:22] in the warranty.

[12:23] Okay?

[12:24] But let's get back to the refunds.

[12:25] So here we are today in 2022.

[12:28] And I think what's annoying me about this whole nonrefundable deposit is these companies

[12:33] aren't building custom games for you.

[12:35] Like you're not ordering your Ferrari with brown leather seats and like yellow exterior

[12:41] and this is a very specific item.

[12:44] They're making like a thousand collector's editions of Toy Story.

[12:48] They're making 1,250 Halloween's and 500 Ultraman's.

[12:52] These aren't highly customized games anymore.

[12:55] So let me ask you a question.

[12:56] So if you ordered Ultraman on day one with a nonrefundable deposit and I'm number 500,

[13:01] I'm the last person on the list and I know a year and a half out that I don't want the

[13:07] game anymore, that I put my deposit down and I know this is on me.

[13:11] I put my deposit down and then I see the game and I play the game in one week and then I

[13:15] don't want it.

[13:16] They're a year away from making my game and you're telling me that they can't refund

[13:21] me my money or better yet, well why not just give me credit for a future spooky game and

[13:27] then not make that game?

[13:29] Do you think they already ordered all the parts for that game?

[13:32] No.

[13:33] Do you think they already made the butter cabinet for my machine?

[13:36] No.

[13:37] I mean the game is so far out.

[13:38] The same is true with the collector's editions of Toy Story.

[13:41] They haven't made them yet.

[13:43] There's plenty of time to find new buyers if you want out and this is why JJP is like

[13:47] bumping their chest.

[13:49] Is this whole system guys?

[13:51] It's absolutely 100% skewed for the benefit of the manufacturer and there's nothing about

[13:57] this that is good for the consumer.

[13:59] Here's what happened on day one I think and I'm just making a few assumptions but on day

[14:03] one when Jersey Jack Pinball launches Toy Story, they're basically going to all of their

[14:08] distributors and saying if you want your allotment, you've got to give us $2,500 for each of your

[14:15] CEs and that will secure your allotment of Toy Story CEs.

[14:21] And that money went over to Jersey Jack Pinball probably on day one.

[14:25] So let's just say hypothetically a major distributor has 100 collector's editions they've been

[14:30] promised.

[14:31] So that means, let's say automated as 100.

[14:34] That means they're cutting Jersey Jack a check for $250,000 for those 100 games and

[14:41] then they invoice their list of people who are interested in Toy Story collector's editions.

[14:47] And that's how it's working.

[14:48] And then what's happening is this is that if you said you want it won, your money is

[14:53] being sent to Jersey Jack Pinball and even if you haven't really seen the game yet and

[14:58] if you want to cancel your order on day one, right, you see the game, you realize it's

[15:02] not for you, you don't want Toy Story 4, a lot of people are being said nope, can't get

[15:07] your money back.

[15:08] And we've already sent your money to Jersey Jack Pinball to allocate your spot because

[15:12] you said you wanted one and we paid for our allocation and yet this game is not even being

[15:16] made until the fall.

[15:18] So we've got four months before the game's actually made and you have some people that

[15:21] don't want it anymore and now those people have to try to sell their spot to somebody

[15:25] else and don't forget that the warranties are non-transferable.

[15:29] And so all of this is just weird to me and this is why I think it's a lose, lose, lose

[15:34] situation.

[15:35] It's a lose for the manufacturers even though they're putting money in the bank which is

[15:39] a win for them, right?

[15:40] It's a lose for them because they are basically now locking people in to a product of theirs

[15:47] that those people might not really want.

[15:49] I was talking to one of my friends who's in on a collector's edition of Toy Story and

[15:54] he's like, Chris, I can't get a refund, I got to take the game.

[15:57] And he was talking about it in such a sad way, like he was kind of like dejected, like

[16:01] oh well, shoulder shrug, it's on me, I made that decision, I have to take the game.

[16:06] I would rather just go get it used, Ali, but there's nothing I can do.

[16:10] And hearing him talk about this is why it's a lose because you basically have people who

[16:15] are spending $15,000, the most they've ever spent on a pinball machine, new and box ever,

[16:21] and they're dejected or they're backing up into the purchase and I get it, it's all

[16:25] of our faults.

[16:26] We all could have said no and waited to see the game and then made a decision but we've

[16:31] almost been engineered this way.

[16:33] Like this hobby has engineered all of us to have this FOMO and run at it and guess who

[16:39] engineered all this FOMO?

[16:41] The manufacturers did, they absolutely did and they love this, like this absolutely benefits

[16:47] them, but where it's starting to eat away and this is why it's a lose for the manufacturers

[16:52] is they're also starting to create a lot of ill will between the consumer and them because

[16:57] the consumer feels like they don't like this anymore.

[17:00] They don't want to be locked in and they don't want to feel like disappointed that you're

[17:05] now forcing them to buy from you.

[17:07] And then the distributors, right?

[17:09] It's a lose for the distributors because a lot of them are putting up a lot of money

[17:12] up front and they might be left holding the bag if they can't find a thousand people to

[17:18] buy these collector's editions.

[17:20] You know, they've been starving for inventory but I can tell you this, what distributors

[17:24] did not want was there to be a thousand of Toy Story 4 at $15,000 a pop because the more

[17:32] money you charge for these machines, the harder it is for these distributors to find buyers.

[17:38] It's just the law of economics.

[17:40] The more you charge, the less consumers you have potentially.

[17:43] And also the other part is this, the last thing a distributor wants to do is tell one

[17:47] of its long time customers, sorry, I can't give you a refund.

[17:51] Sorry, I can't give you your money back because I put out your money.

[17:56] Like basically it's like, let's just say hypothetically I bought this game through Zach.

[18:00] Zach will be like, Chris, I took your $2,500 and I gave it to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[18:05] They have your money, they haven't made your game yet, you don't want the game anymore but

[18:10] I can't give you your money back because they have it.

[18:13] Now I do think it begs the question, why can't you just have credit with Jersey Jack Pinball?

[18:18] Like if I get it if you don't want to give me my money back, but at least give me credit

[18:21] towards a future Jersey Jack game that I might want.

[18:25] It's not like there's that many games coming out every year from this company where that

[18:28] would be a clerical nightmare to figure that part out.

[18:31] So I think the distributors are losing too because they're disappointing some of their

[18:35] customers and ultimately as customers we're all losing out on this non-refundable shenanigans.

[18:42] We are, like we're the biggest losers in all of it because we were engineered to have all

[18:46] of this FOMO and these companies took advantage of us.

[18:49] They did.

[18:50] You're telling me when Spooky Pinball announces two new games and doesn't even show us the

[18:57] game and requires people to put non-refundable deposits before they even show you the game

[19:03] itself that that's not taking advantage of people's addiction and excitement and FOMO

[19:09] around this hobby, they absolutely knew what they were doing.

[19:13] Jerry knew what he was doing when he revealed the game six months before he even has people

[19:17] there making the games.

[19:19] Damian knew what he was doing at Haggis Pinball when he lied to everyone and said games were

[19:23] going to start in July being made.

[19:25] I'm glad he's making games now.

[19:26] I'm seeing mermaid editions go out the door, but he absolutely lied to people.

[19:31] He knew he was not going to have games on the line in two months.

[19:34] And yet your money's non-refundable.

[19:37] If you're at the end of that mermaid order and you want your money back, you still can't

[19:41] get your money back.

[19:42] And here's the part I don't like about any of this.

[19:44] Nowhere in the contract.

[19:45] Nowhere in the contract is there anything that says like if the game doesn't ship by

[19:49] this date, you can get your money back.

[19:51] Nowhere in the contract does it say if we have play field issues with the game, you

[19:55] can get a refund.

[19:56] And I think what we need in these contracts with these non-refundable deposits is a little

[20:01] bit of a window.

[20:02] Like give people a window to make up their mind and then you give it non-refundable.

[20:07] The reason why these manufacturers don't want there to be a window, they don't want you to

[20:12] play the game.

[20:13] They don't want you to see too much of the gameplay.

[20:15] It's absolutely in their best interest to get us to fall in love with wanting these things

[20:20] without seeing enough to make us change our minds.

[20:23] Look, it's smart marketing.

[20:25] Don't get me wrong.

[20:26] When you can sell something without even showing people it, like you've crossed over into the

[20:31] supernal realm of marketing and it actually made suckers out of all of us.

[20:37] But I do think people have woken up.

[20:39] I think people are tired of it.

[20:41] And I do think Toy Story Collector's Edition will be the final burn.

[20:45] Like this burn is going to burn people hard.

[20:48] And it's not just scalpers getting burned.

[20:50] Yes, our scalpers getting burned absolutely.

[20:53] Scalping in pinball is almost done.

[20:56] The only scalping left.

[20:58] And I'm just going to say it right now.

[20:59] The only machine I ever think you're going to be able to scalp for like a decent profit

[21:04] will be the machines from Keith Elwin.

[21:06] And I think everything else, I don't know.

[21:08] James Bond, maybe.

[21:10] But again, I think if Capow and Gomez make James Bond, I think they're going to price

[21:14] it extraordinarily high.

[21:15] I think they're going to do another Batman SLE thing on some of the limited editions of

[21:19] the game.

[21:20] It's like Elvira 40th.

[21:21] I mean, they sold them to distributors for 15K.

[21:25] And then you had people spending like 20,000 to get one.

[21:28] I think these days are coming to an end.

[21:30] I really do.

[21:31] I think we didn't just hit the pinball ceiling.

[21:33] I think we flew into it and we crashed beyond it.

[21:37] The only place to go now, and I keep saying it, the only place to go now is to make extraordinary

[21:41] games.

[21:43] At these prices, every game needs to be extraordinary.

[21:46] But I do implore all of you, don't give non-refundable deposits again.

[21:51] I'm not doing it again.

[21:52] I'm done with it.

[21:53] I'm tired of it.

[21:54] There's no money to be made unless I see a spectacular pinball machine.

[21:58] Only when I know there's going to be more demand than supply, like back to the future,

[22:02] like Matrix.

[22:03] But you're not going to see it with Godfather.

[22:05] You're not going to see it with Toy Story 4.

[22:07] You're not going to see it with Halloween and Ultraman.

[22:10] You're not going to see it with Scooby-Doo.

[22:12] You're just not going to see it.

[22:13] Like we're all smarter now.

[22:15] You guys realize that the team that's making Scooby-Doo is the same team that made Ultraman

[22:20] and Halloween.

[22:21] Why do we think it's going to be like amazing?

[22:23] Why?

[22:24] Like if you use the same team to make the next product, why is it going to get so much better?

[22:28] Did they learn how to code much better?

[22:30] Did they learn how to design much better after just one game?

[22:33] They quickly moved on to Scooby-Doo after Ultraman and Halloween.

[22:37] But I really think the software department is where things are going to fall down with

[22:40] Spooky.

[22:41] I just don't know if they can code a game as good as everybody else in the industry.

[22:45] But we'll see.

[22:46] We'll see.

[22:47] We've got a few months to wait.

[22:48] Alright, so that's just my take.

[22:49] I think it's unethical to reveal games like a year before you're ready to make them.

[22:53] I think we need to wise up as consumers and stop chasing after this stuff.

[22:57] I know we've been engineered to have all the FOMO, but I don't like these nonrefundable

[23:02] deposits.

[23:03] I think a lot of people are going to be walking away losing money.

[23:06] I also think a lot of people are going to be losing a lot of money when they realize

[23:10] how much in value these games are going to lose now.

[23:13] The more these games cost, the more you're going to lose.

[23:16] It's not the other way around.

[23:18] This is a really fun hobby when you can get LEs for $7,000 and pros for five.

[23:23] Remember when a pro machine used to be like $4,500, $5,000 and LE was $7,500?

[23:29] A premium was like $6,500.

[23:31] Remember those days of halcyon days of old?

[23:34] It's all too much money.

[23:35] Everyone's realizing that.

[23:37] You're now paying almost double what you used to pay like six, seven years ago.

[23:42] It's not worth it.

[23:43] I think everyone's realizing that.

[23:45] Who the hell wants to lose $2,000 to $3,000 every time they buy a Pimble machine now?

[23:51] It's just not going to work out.

[23:53] Everybody, happy Wednesday, happy hump day.

[23:56] We've got more time to wait for Venom.

[23:58] It's going to be Venom.

[23:59] I was right that it's Venom.

[24:00] Yeah, I didn't think it was going to be a Comic-Con.

[24:02] I was just responding to what other people were saying.

[24:04] But here we are.

[24:05] Okay, so I called that it was Venom.

[24:07] I was wrong about Comic-Con.

[24:08] The other thing I'll say is this.

[24:10] We're having a lot more conversation happening on the Patreon comments section, which is

[24:15] nice.

[24:16] I like this debate.

[24:17] And welcome to the party, freaky guys, 666.

[24:20] But I just want to say this, guys, play nice with each other.

[24:24] If I see you personally attacking other people or calling people like mental midgets, I'm

[24:30] going to ban you.

[24:31] I'm giving everyone a warning at the same time right now.

[24:35] Have a debate.

[24:36] It's okay if you disagree with me.

[24:38] It's okay if you disagree with each other.

[24:40] But don't get into a personal attack territory.

[24:44] This isn't pin side.

[24:45] I won't tolerate that.

[24:47] This is a fun place to spread all of your toxic positivity about Toy Story 4.

[24:52] Okay, everybody have a great day.

[24:54] We'll talk to you soon.
