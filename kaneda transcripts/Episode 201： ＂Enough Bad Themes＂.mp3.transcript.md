[00:00] Oh baby, it's the day, made up for romance.

[00:20] Welcome to Canadian's Pinball Podcast.

[00:23] This is Episode 201 of Canadian's Pinball Podcast.

[00:28] I hope you enjoyed the 200th episode with our very special guest, Brenda, by the downloads

[00:34] and the amount of listens I can tell you did.

[00:36] So maybe we'll have her on more often.

[00:38] Maybe I have to Joel Herta to join the show as much as possible.

[00:42] Look, we're going to start off this podcast with a correction.

[00:47] As you guys know, I've sort of built a career around anunciating and pronouncing pinball terminology

[00:55] all incorrectly.

[00:56] And apparently, I might be a little dyslexic because I called it the Bat Sui in Multi-Ball

[01:05] when it is in fact the Wat Tussi.

[01:09] And I must have mixed up the U and the S's and came up with more of a Chinese sounding

[01:14] Batman dance versus a pop culture dance from the 1960s.

[01:19] So I apologize for all of my incorrect pronunciation of the Bat Tussi Multi-Ball.

[01:26] It is not the Bat Sui Multi-Ball.

[01:30] That being said, it's an awesome multi-ball.

[01:33] And I hope they do a little bit more with the clips though.

[01:35] For those of you who have got to that part in the game, you don't really see Batman dancing

[01:41] that much.

[01:42] You obviously see Robyn sort of in the Bat Mobile staring at the screen.

[01:46] And if you watch the original clip from the show, it's like this great three-minute scene

[01:51] where Batman orders and orange juice and gets drugged and then starts doing the dance,

[01:55] I wish a little bit more of that scene came through in the game itself.

[01:59] Now, I still think they're polishing off a lot of the clips and a lot of the sounds in

[02:04] that game.

[02:06] I'm going on record for auto correcting my own idiocracy and it's the Bat Tussi.

[02:13] All right.

[02:14] What I want to talk about on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[02:17] Look, there's not much news.

[02:19] So I want to talk about some of the things that are really percolating through the

[02:21] hobby.

[02:23] And first and foremost, I want to talk about a subject that I don't have firsthand experience

[02:28] on yet.

[02:29] But I want to talk about American Pimball.

[02:31] I want to talk about Houdini and I want to talk about some of the feedback that I've

[02:35] been reading about the game and that is about how tight are the shots in Houdini.

[02:42] And I think it's a very interesting question.

[02:44] The whole notion of tight shots versus frustrating and fun when it comes to Pimball.

[02:51] Now, the problem is this.

[02:54] There are so many different skill levels of Pimball people out there that some people prefer

[03:01] games to have tight shots that are not easily makeable because to those people, it makes

[03:08] the game challenging.

[03:09] It makes them want to come back for more.

[03:11] And it actually improves their Pimball skills.

[03:16] Some people out there, they just don't like shots that are really hard to make because

[03:20] they find it frustrating and they spend the entire game breaking the ball, trying to

[03:25] progress through the game.

[03:27] Because the problem when a shot is really tight is chances are that that shot is required

[03:33] to complete a mode or to go through the game and progress through the machine.

[03:37] And if you have a consistently hard time hitting a shot, it can become very, very frustrating.

[03:44] I want to read a pin-side post by Mr. Russell and he started a thread which is really like

[03:53] a very controversial thing to say.

[03:56] He said, either I can't shoot or Houdini is poorly designed.

[04:00] Now, this is a great example in my mind of why Pimball's side moderation is bad.

[04:08] So this one person has one thing he wants to say about Houdini.

[04:13] And instead of this being, why isn't this inside the Houdini thread itself?

[04:20] The problem with allowing this to be its own thread is it almost creates more of a

[04:26] dramatic sort of controversial, oh my god Houdini is not good because one guy doesn't

[04:31] like it and that guy has the ability to create an entire thread and headline.

[04:37] It's like he's putting this at the top of the newspaper headline.

[04:41] This is the number one story on Pimball.

[04:43] It's at the top of Pimball when I went to it this morning that Houdini is poorly designed.

[04:47] And I think that's wrong and I used to do this and I was wrong in doing it.

[04:51] You should not be allowed to make a personal opinion about one game be its own thread that

[04:58] then becomes the talk of the entire machine because it's bumped to the top of the thread

[05:05] list.

[05:06] So anyway, he writes, I choose to believe the latter.

[05:09] I had my first opportunity to play Houdini.

[05:12] The shot architecture is laughable.

[05:15] These shots are so tight it completely destroys any potential fun of the game.

[05:20] It's beautiful but that's about it.

[05:22] Who designed this game?

[05:24] Alright well Russell, he actually got 21 down votes and 7 up votes.

[05:29] Now when someone says something like this, okay who designed the game?

[05:33] Russell is, he's on Pinside a lot.

[05:37] He's not some newbie to Pinside.

[05:39] You know why I know this?

[05:41] Because the guy has something like 75,000 Pinside trophies and like I don't know, like he's

[05:49] been on here for a long time.

[05:51] So at least go do a little research and find out who designed Houdini.

[05:55] It is Joe Balser for all of you out there who don't know.

[05:59] And so this question of Houdini and are the shots too tight and what does that mean?

[06:05] Now look, I also was following Steve Bowden on Facebook yesterday and he sort of said

[06:10] something similar that the shots are tight but they're findable.

[06:16] And so if you play it like you start to learn how to hit the shots.

[06:19] Now here's the thing.

[06:21] Here's the thing.

[06:22] I think Houdini has very, very tight shots.

[06:25] Now I've played it a few times.

[06:26] I haven't played it recently.

[06:27] Now I heard they opened up some of the shots on the final production version of the

[06:31] game but if you simply just look at the Houdini play field, you can see that there's not

[06:37] a lot of opening in the shots themselves.

[06:41] And what does that mean?

[06:42] What does that mean?

[06:43] And is that going to detract from the fun factor of the game?

[06:46] Now I think what it means is very simply for all of you out there who are in the market

[06:51] for a Houdini.

[06:53] It probably means you should play the game first.

[06:56] And I'm saying this in all fairness to my friends at American Pimball and to everyone

[07:01] who worked on this game to get it out in such a short period of time.

[07:04] You know, this is advice for any Pimball machine.

[07:07] If you're concerned about the shot geometry, if you're concerned about the layout of the

[07:12] game, then you should play it first.

[07:15] You shouldn't order it just based on pictures, just based on artwork, just based on other

[07:20] people's opinions of the game.

[07:22] Now I've heard from people who are playing Houdini and absolutely loving it but I have

[07:26] to say this.

[07:27] When I watched the straight down the middle sort of the review by Greg over there, I did notice

[07:35] that it seemed like it was really hard to hit the shots.

[07:38] Now for really good players, people who play a lot, the shots brick back and you can

[07:43] control the ball and you keep going at it.

[07:46] But for a lot of you guys out there that are not that good, this game could be really

[07:50] frustrating for you.

[07:51] So again, you're going to have to spend time on it.

[07:54] A shot I was talking to Jack Danger about yesterday because it's fun to hash these things

[07:59] out.

[08:00] I don't think it needs to be negative.

[08:02] I think if I were Russell, I would not have used the word laughable.

[08:07] Because I think that's insulting and I think that's derogatory and I don't think anything

[08:12] about Houdini is laughable.

[08:14] If you want to call something laughable, John Papadouk's Houdini was laughable.

[08:20] There were shots that went nowhere.

[08:22] There was geometry that didn't even work.

[08:24] Everything that's in Joe Balser's Houdini functions, it works.

[08:29] It's not laughable.

[08:30] It might be difficult and it's okay.

[08:32] It's okay that we have pinball machines out there that might have a high degree of difficulty

[08:37] like everything doesn't have to be a walk in the park.

[08:40] But right, the fine line is you don't want to end up like Ghostbusters.

[08:45] You don't want a game that when people get it, it's more frustrating than fun.

[08:49] And regardless of how good the theme is, I know people who are the biggest Ghostbusters

[08:53] fans on the planet and they won't go anywhere near a Ghostbusters machine because of how

[08:58] bad the machine shoots.

[09:00] I'm not saying Houdini is there at all.

[09:03] But I think the shots are tight.

[09:05] Now the shot I was talking about and again, because I don't have tons of games, the right

[09:09] orbit in Batman continues to be the most difficult shot for me to hit.

[09:14] For some reason it's really difficult to time it off the left flipper.

[09:18] But the right orbit shot is absolutely necessary to start multi-ball in Batman.

[09:24] So what I have to do is I have to lean a little to the left, sort of as the balls coming

[09:28] down the left flipper, I have to look and almost like see the shot versus timing the shot.

[09:33] It's difficult.

[09:34] Now I can look at that as being, well why is it so hard to do this?

[09:38] But I also think it probably was kind of necessary to make the shot that locks the balls for

[09:45] multi-ball a little bit more difficult because you don't want to be starting multi-ball all

[09:50] the time because it's really, really easy to light lock in that game.

[09:54] All you have to do is start a villain mode and then shoot either the bat computer or the

[09:58] bat analyzer, which is basically a straight up the middle shot near that center road

[10:03] rotisserie thing or turntable.

[10:06] Really easy to light lock, really difficult to shoot a lock shot.

[10:10] And that's fine.

[10:11] That's like a nice trade-off.

[10:12] It's a nice balance.

[10:13] I hear the shot in Houdini that people are having a really hard time hitting is the scoop

[10:17] shot.

[10:19] But look, play the game.

[10:22] There's a lot of people saying it might be too tough.

[10:24] There's a lot of people saying the shots are fine-able.

[10:26] The jury is out.

[10:27] The jury is out.

[10:29] We will see.

[10:30] I hope more people get their Houdini soon.

[10:32] So staying on American Pimball, something that I emailed Josh.

[10:37] I emailed Josh and I asked him a question because I read this on this week in Pimball and

[10:41] I wanted to get clarity and I really for the life of me, I'm so confused by this.

[10:47] So the rumor is that their second title might be October Fest, okay?

[10:51] The beer festival that goes on in Germany, October Fest, they have filed for a license for

[11:00] that game.

[11:02] And I emailed Josh and full transparency and said, hey man, just saw this.

[11:08] Are you serious?

[11:09] I really think you should come out and say, no, absolutely not, are we making that game?

[11:15] We're exploring a whole bunch of titles.

[11:17] He kind of gave this vague answer that it was like, we heard that people were kicking

[11:22] this around so we decided to secure the license but we also have other titles that

[11:26] were pursuing as well.

[11:28] When I asked him, I said straight up, like dude, don't make October Fest, he was kind

[11:33] of like, well why not?

[11:34] Like don't you think people will like it and enjoy it?

[11:36] And Josh, instead of going back and forth on email, I'm here to tell you, in front of

[11:41] my entire listener base, do not make October Fest.

[11:45] What is wrong with Pimball companies and themes and licenses?

[11:51] Why can't people understand how to make a product that will sell?

[11:57] Do you think October Fest is a game that is going to make people say take my money now?

[12:03] I don't understand it.

[12:05] I don't understand it.

[12:06] What market research has anyone done to think that October Fest is the kind of theme that

[12:13] guys who spend $7000 to $8000 on a Pimball machine want to permanently have inside their home?

[12:19] I get it, people like to drink beer but that doesn't mean I want like a course light

[12:24] Pimball machine.

[12:26] It's just this, it's so head scratching to me how these themes and these licenses are

[12:31] even considered and look it sounds like they're seriously considering it.

[12:35] So what I want you to do listener of the show, if you know anyone in American Pimball, please

[12:40] reach out to them, do not do it, do not even consider October Fest.

[12:44] I would happily help you guys find a new license.

[12:47] I would happily apply my marketing skills to American Pimball and help you guys identify.

[12:53] A theme that is affordable to make but would also sell like hotcakes.

[12:58] I don't think these guys understand marketing very well.

[13:02] I think it's like an epidemic throughout Pimball that people just make what they think their

[13:07] gut tells them will sell.

[13:10] And so if you know anyone at American Pimball, send them an email, do not make October Fest

[13:15] and you're follow up game to Houdini.

[13:18] Title number two and I told this to Josh.

[13:21] Title number two is so important for them to come up with a theme that is also exciting

[13:25] and enticing because you have to look at your company like you're building a family of

[13:30] titles that the games will go next to each other.

[13:33] Houdini to the left.

[13:35] My next American Pimball title will be October Fest.

[13:39] Whaa, whaa.

[13:41] You know what I'm saying?

[13:42] That title, that theme is as bad as Andrew Highway trying to make animal house and then

[13:47] it's as bad as full throttle.

[13:48] It's as bad as WWE.

[13:50] It's as bad as Mustang.

[13:52] Why pick a game like that?

[13:54] There are so many original, not even original.

[13:56] There are so many stories and IPs out there that are open IPs that you can use without needing

[14:02] permission that are far better than October Fest.

[14:06] I really, I can for the life of me understand what motivates, you know, these people to say

[14:11] these things about the games they're considering.

[14:14] I was also saying that, let's see, Charlie Emmery got interviewed and was talking about their

[14:19] next titles and I think they were considering something like Halloween or Saw or Friday the

[14:27] 13th as their next pins.

[14:29] Now look, spooky is another company where they're like in this really weird situation because

[14:34] of how they're branded.

[14:35] You know, spooky Pimball like Charlie loves like horror movies.

[14:39] It's like the theme that is defined as company.

[14:42] You know, first title was America's most honoured Rob Zombie.

[14:45] All the games fit into this sort of genre.

[14:49] I've said it from the very get go.

[14:50] It's like naming your company spooky Pimball.

[14:54] It's limiting because do you only make games that are in that category?

[14:59] Now we know they have and they've made Jetsons.

[15:01] They've made Domino's.

[15:02] They've made total nuclear annihilation.

[15:05] But it's also a little bit weird from a branding standpoint because you have a game like

[15:09] total nuclear annihilation or a Domino's and Jetsons and then the logo on it is a ghost.

[15:15] It seems like well maybe that should be the name of the company that only makes the

[15:20] spooky thing game.

[15:21] Now here's some marketing advice for Charlie Emory.

[15:23] Take it or leave it Charlie.

[15:25] I think the games that are your sort of horror inspired games or your spooky games or you

[15:31] know, like Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[15:34] Good example of that.

[15:35] Those are the titles that should carry the spooky moniker.

[15:39] Okay, you should, those should come out from spooky Pimball because spooky Pimball is

[15:43] dedicated to bringing some of the most chilling and horrific and amazingly fun horror themes

[15:48] to life through Pimball.

[15:49] If you want to make other titles, why don't you simply just make a different brand or

[15:54] within your company?

[15:56] There's Honda and then there's Acura.

[15:58] There is infinity and Nissan.

[16:01] You could simply make another sort of version or handle to release other games underneath,

[16:09] which would be I think completely acceptable.

[16:11] Then you could really play up the spooky theme even more in some of those names.

[16:15] Now, do I think that Halloween saw or Friday the 13th would be good games to make for

[16:23] Pimball?

[16:25] I mean, I don't know.

[16:27] I think the one title that Charlie keeps throwing out that I think would be the best would be

[16:30] Godzilla.

[16:31] I think that's the game he's dying to make.

[16:33] I know that that license is probably not cheap because it's still a very popular theme

[16:37] out there in the world.

[16:39] But I really, I always say this.

[16:42] It's like I think Charlie's dilemma is I think they want to make games for them.

[16:48] They don't necessarily make games where there is a buyer in mind.

[16:53] Him and Bug and the family, they love these themes so much that it's like they're making

[16:58] Pimball for them.

[16:59] I'm not necessarily sure they're making Pimball for everyone out there.

[17:03] So I'm not sure they're doing any market research to know if there's a demand for these things.

[17:09] And we're going to see how well Alice Cooper does because this is going to be the turning

[17:14] point for spooky.

[17:16] Alice Cooper is definitely not a theme that everyone's like I really want to know.

[17:19] It's Cooper Pimball machine.

[17:20] I do applaud the fact that they're not just making another music pin that this is going

[17:24] to be more of a nightmare castle kind of monster bash kind of a viral kind of scared

[17:29] stiff kind of game where Alice Cooper is like the castle gatekeeper or the landlord who's

[17:37] going to like guide us through this like nightmare castle.

[17:41] So it's much different.

[17:42] I actually like that approach better because I don't think there's that much of a demand

[17:44] for purely Alice Cooper music pin.

[17:48] But again licensing in this industry continues to be the one thing that I just can't understand

[17:54] why people can keep getting it wrong.

[17:58] They keep getting it wrong.

[18:00] So speaking of licensing, I've been getting a bunch of emails from people about my P3

[18:06] coverage.

[18:07] And I was going back and forth with with a nice gentleman.

[18:11] His name is Hugh.

[18:12] Hugh thank you for reading or sorry thank you for listening and thank you for writing

[18:16] to me about P3.

[18:18] And we were just going back and forth on on Jerry and the P3 platform and how you know

[18:23] Jerry's done a lot for the pinball hobby by making P rock and P rock is really you know

[18:28] he's like Jerry is the father of home brew pinball and Jerry made the engine that allowed

[18:33] people to make pinball machines.

[18:35] It was used before it was like ripped off in the big Lebowski.

[18:40] It's used in I think it's using total nuclear annihilation helps Scott build that.

[18:45] You know so look I give Jerry all the credit in the world for making P rock.

[18:49] I think it's amazing what he did.

[18:51] He sort of made the unreal engine for pinball machines.

[18:55] Okay for those of you unfamiliar with video games unreal was a game.

[19:00] The unreal engine was sort of like the operating system or the engine that allowed the designers

[19:07] to build the game and what Epic games did was they would sell and license out the unreal

[19:14] engine to other game developers because they had built the entire architect on how to make

[19:19] a game and they would license that out.

[19:21] So every single game that used the unreal engine they would make money.

[19:26] I know this because I used to work with Clippy B and Mark over their Mark Reigns over there

[19:33] and these guys made millions of dollars licensing out the unreal engine.

[19:38] I remember once sitting in the W Hotel and the head of Epic games just holds up a glass

[19:43] of Dom P and it's like we make like $200,000 a day on our license alone and I'm just like

[19:49] okay can have another glass.

[19:52] But it's incredible right.

[19:54] And so I went back and forth with this gentleman on email because look I'm not denying that

[19:59] Jerry has worked really hard.

[20:01] I'm not denying that you know Jerry put a lot of like blood and sweat and tears into like

[20:06] this new platform and into his engine.

[20:09] But the bottom line is this and this is just a question for everyone that we all have to

[20:14] deal with in our own lives is what good is all the you know the sweat equity and what good

[20:20] is the hustle and the hard work and the labor.

[20:24] If the outcome of all of that hard work doesn't equal profit.

[20:29] Okay it's business.

[20:31] Like intentions are one thing and unless you make profit unless you actually apply all

[20:38] that hard work to something that people want the simple question is what good is it.

[20:43] So you made this engine that all these home brew guys can use are you making money?

[20:48] Is it generating revenue for you?

[20:51] You know the real where the money would be made is if Stern or Jersey Jack or you know

[20:57] another major manufacturer like highway would use your system in license to use it but

[21:02] they're not.

[21:03] So there's probably not much money coming in after all that hard work.

[21:07] And then you spend all this time making a platform that you know it's hard to sell to people.

[21:14] So I respect Jerry as a person I respect you know people who try to make innovation happen

[21:21] I respect people who actually do create innovation but ultimately you have to apply the most

[21:27] respect and the most admiration to the people who don't just like try to do stuff that's

[21:33] new but the people who do stuff that actually breaks through and I just think that this

[21:39] hobby has shown us what they want.

[21:42] I mean it's if you were to like if you were to say Chris forget the podcast for a minute

[21:47] everyone forget pinball as you know it just pull people into a room and say to them what's

[21:53] the most important part of a pinball machine that would make you excited to play it go.

[21:59] You know you would probably get a combination of the theme or the license and the layout

[22:05] right.

[22:06] So are the shots fun to hit and is the theme when I want to play.

[22:10] Lower in there would come up like modular systems would come up with like the ability to

[22:16] swap out games the limited room I have you know see they started they started at like

[22:24] number 899 and 10 of like a consumer's wish list for pinball and by starting all the

[22:30] way down there in terms of like the things people look for you then have to work twice

[22:36] is hard to get back up that desire list by consumers you see the number one is probably

[22:42] theme as theme is number one reason why people buy pinball machines and so you come out with

[22:48] a theme people don't want and this is not just America this is not just P3 this is like

[22:52] Andrew highways decision to make full throttle to make animal house was his first consideration.

[22:58] You know look Dutch pinball they got it right people would buy the big Lebowski people

[23:01] love that theme it is the perfect theme for pinball fanatics they would sell everyone

[23:06] of the big Lebowski's if they decided to make 500 or a thousand they would sell every single

[23:10] one okay look and we know theme is so important so then theme and then you go to like design

[23:16] and layout and shots then you go to code probably as a third who is anyone out there even

[23:21] discussing the code in like multi morpher or the code in Jetsons or the code in Rob Zombie

[23:26] or the code no no because if you don't hook people on one and two they don't even care

[23:33] anymore like you've lost them you have to get them at the top of their wish list okay and

[23:39] again this is just basic marketing it's basic marketing that continues to allude all these

[23:45] people who spend years doing this stuff and look if I was going to spend I can tell you

[23:50] right now if I were to spend six years making a pinball company all right I guarantee you

[23:57] like when my product came to market it would sell out immediately without a doubt or I wouldn't

[24:02] do it or it wouldn't start the company you know what pinball manufacturing reminds me of have

[24:07] you ever seen the the the gnome meme from South Park where it's like phase one it's like collect

[24:13] underpants phase two question mark phase three profit that's pinball companies for the most part

[24:20] phase one announce your pinball company phase two question mark phase three profit I mean that's

[24:26] like deep roots business model right now phase one announce we have a pinball manufacturing

[24:32] pinball company with all these you know designers from yesterday years phase two nobody really

[24:37] knows what the fuck they're talking about like quiet manufacturing right this up phase three we're

[24:41] going to make money we're going to sell for our ease for the price of of kias see it's all the

[24:45] same and your highway did the same exact thing touch pinball did the same exact thing you know they

[24:50] don't know phase two and phase two is what makes stern pinball so successful which is figure out how

[24:58] to actually make the game at a cheap enough cost and employ enough people to actually get the

[25:04] assembly line going so that you can actually make a profit all right so look look I get it you

[25:12] guys want to like email me saying like I'm wrong about this that certain individuals deserve

[25:18] more respect from the show and whatnot and I'm here to call it like it is I am I mean what am I

[25:25] getting wrong here what am I getting wrong here I just I just wish that people would understand

[25:32] how simple it is to make a pinball machine license that people actually want okay all right what

[25:40] else is going on in the world we saw the first images of Lucy vault edition from stern which looks

[25:46] almost exactly like the old vault edition from stern and it looks great it looks fine I mean it's

[25:53] it's got even nicer artwork around the display it's got sort of like the red and black sort of

[25:58] lightning bolts in a circular fashion it's got the the lower play field window that can now be removed

[26:04] if you need to clean it which is great and if I owned in acdc lucy before I think you now own the

[26:12] one that's going to be less desirable that's just the case I don't think people care that the

[26:16] drummers no longer on it I also think who cares if you like acdc and you like the lucy art which

[26:22] has always been a little bit controversial that art package enjoy your game enjoy your game I'm glad

[26:28] that you know stern sort of remade it because I think it's going to force more and more people to

[26:33] stop thinking about these things as collectibles and start getting people to focus on buying the

[26:39] games that they really like all right what else is going on going down the the pin sides so start

[26:47] there's a start trek limited edition for sale for eight thousand dollars that's not going to sell

[26:53] sorry the old these games they're starting to seem really old aren't they I saw someone want

[26:59] to trade their alien pinball machine for a big Lebowski talk about like with that guys really

[27:08] stuck in the like just think about that trade for a minute I want to trade my alien pinball machine

[27:14] a company that is questionably going to survive and you might never have a long term support

[27:20] for a big Lebowski pinball machine a machine that probably almost will never get additional support

[27:25] because the version of that game will never be remade and it's it's been really quiet let's talk

[27:32] about Dutch pinball like it is crickets crickets we haven't heard anything and here we are February

[27:39] of 2018 and I haven't heard a damn thing now are they waiting for tpf to surprise us with some good

[27:47] news that games are starting to be manufactured I hope so because I think if they go past tpf

[27:53] without any positive news or momentum I think people will just finally give up on this whole thing

[28:00] I can't understand like why it's taking so long to get these games out the door I'm trying to

[28:08] think what else is going on let's let's click on pin side for sale thread and see what comes up

[28:13] and how much people think their their pins are worth so let's see oh look at this a wizard of

[28:19] vase a one of one for nine thousand four hundred and fifty dollars how is this possible but it says

[28:27] look one of one history of was development available this beautiful game was made especially for

[28:33] Alex levy for his efforts in creating was there is a picture of an email attached from jersey jack

[28:39] attesting to this being the sole game of its type of course the back is signed by jersey jack

[28:45] emerald city finished I was fortunate to have been able to acquire this pin I then put in a brand

[28:50] new jj display and added some great mods including cliffy protectors throughout and worked with cliff

[28:57] on developing the protectors for the castle playfield edges I'm trying to think like what's special

[29:02] about this machine you will have a true one of a kind was machine let's see I'm going to open it up

[29:08] and I'm looking at it and I don't know okay where but where where what what is different about this

[29:16] machine I I'm looking at it right now and oh look there oh wow there's like a which that's on

[29:23] there that looks like she's holding an hourglass which is cool um but I'm just not I'm not he

[29:30] doesn't like explain what the differences are in the machine itself so that's interesting maybe

[29:41] let's see if I can go into the thread and find some stuff based and okay I like this I think

[29:50] you need to take money off since it's related to Alex levy and a few more hundred options jack

[29:55] scribbled on it yeah like I don't I don't know I don't know what you guys think but like I can't

[30:03] even see the differences if you if you know the differences in this machine please email me I can

[30:09] need a pinball at gmail.com but there you go if you see that's another thing if you're going to sell

[30:14] this one-of-one machine made for someone that's supposed to be special and you're asking a huge

[30:18] premium for it like how how better you at selling your game that you're not listing the differences

[30:24] in this game I mean I I don't get it there's a dialed in le for sale for $8,500 okay so here's

[30:33] the problem with these people these I mean honestly I'm so sick of people who buy a machine and

[30:38] then they try to sell it for exactly what they paid and it's used like like can people stop like

[30:45] 8,500 I guess the or best offer um ridiculous I mean you can get a brand new dialed in le for

[30:52] $8,500 in a box probably a little bit cheaper now because they probably have more inventory sitting

[30:58] around circus Voltaire let's see what this guy wanted for $6,600 for circus Voltaire all old J

[31:06] pop games you know they're beautiful to look at they get a little boring over time but that's

[31:11] unless you absolutely love it this one was crazy so Guardians of the Galaxy LE this guy

[31:17] ASOA was selling it like 20 days ago he says Guardians of the Galaxy Limited Edition 7 days old

[31:25] from my private home game room 32 plays on the game home use only original owner mint condition

[31:31] price with the following options $7,500 firm okay let's think about that for a minute this game

[31:38] was $9,000 new which I think the street price might have been like $8,200 this guy buys the machine

[31:44] puts 32 plays on it and wants to sell it see this is pinball this is the problem with all of pinball

[31:54] when it comes to collectors and people like what's wrong with this guy why would you buy a pinball

[32:00] machine play it 32 times and then sell it you could go play it 32 times in a bar and realize you

[32:06] don't want it and now he's just losing money it's because it's this kind of mentality these people

[32:11] are addicted to opening up boxes and just getting what's new seeing if they want it then then

[32:16] shipping it out it I don't know about you guys but it is such a fucking hassle to have to ship a pin

[32:23] to have to prep it to have to get it picked up to have to move it out to have to like do all

[32:27] the and then lose money on top of it like you just you're just fine pissing away hundreds of dollars

[32:33] I think it's idiotic I think it's idiotic look I hope in 2018 2019 we get to a point where people

[32:41] play pins more before they sell them where people have themes that they don't want to let go it feels

[32:46] better to have a theme they're like I don't want to let this go it's more fun right having a game

[32:51] that you're like this game is bolted to the floor I enjoy it every day versus a pinball machine where

[32:55] you're constantly scratching your head and be like ah should I should I get rid of it should I trade

[32:59] up should I get something new it's like in life when you meet someone that's amazing that you

[33:03] love that you want to spend the rest of your life with that's so much more rewarding than dating

[33:08] someone who you're always wondering like is now the day I should like break up with her okay that's

[33:13] the way I feel about pinball machines um well look look again I hope people get the themes right

[33:20] this is gonna be a little shorter episode of Canadian's pinball podcast I gotta run the work I'll

[33:24] tell you why I'm in the middle of another one of my teams amazing executions I'm gonna tell you

[33:30] what it was at the beginning of the year we made a bet that if the Philadelphia Eagles would win

[33:37] the Super Bowl I think Lane Johnson was the athlete who announced that he would buy everyone in

[33:41] Philadelphia free beer and we responded to him and said if it happens will buy everybody a free

[33:47] but light it happened when we made that promise the the Eagles were a 50 to one shot at winning the

[33:55] Super Bowl and it was amazing when they actually did it on Sunday night what an amazing game right I

[34:00] feel bad for all the Europeans who watched that game thinking that's what football is always like

[34:05] so he they they they're successful the victorious now we owe everyone in Philadelphia a free

[34:11] bud light and we're figuring out how to do it it's not easy it's like you're giving people a

[34:15] free pack of gum their laws regarding alcohol distribution but this is what I do for a living if

[34:21] you google news search bud light and Philadelphia that's what my team at work does every day and we

[34:29] love creating newsworthy moments that spread that get talked about that put our clients you know

[34:36] into the spotlight and that's that's what I do for a living if you ever wonder what I do for a living

[34:41] I don't operate pinball machines I don't I'm not some crazy psychofin or hermit like some people say

[34:49] I'm not a joke at work my my team creates I think some of the most kick ass earns media and PR campaigns

[34:56] out there and it's fun it's fun I get to go in every day and look for the next opportunity

[35:02] for a brand to jump on top of and believe me I've tried to get more brands involved in pinball but

[35:07] it's so small it's hard for me to justify a brand activating around pinball I really I tried to

[35:13] get Verizon to do stuff with dialed in and god they Verizon oh they sometimes my clients flush right

[35:20] me because they it's it's it's the first pinball machine that you can play with your cell phone I

[35:24] think any telecommunications company any cell phone manufacturer should have been all over that

[35:30] in terms of like creating a pinball tournament where you have to play on your phone just

[35:34] the media would be all over that it's the first time ever you can play pinball using a cell phone

[35:39] I mean that's not a hard story to pitch anyway um this has been episode 201 of Canadian

[35:44] pinball podcasts I'm glad you guys listen you must have some feedback for me that you want me

[35:49] to read on air here I am like I mean I've been throwing some smack talk down if I've said anything

[35:54] that you disagree with if I said anything that you think I should clarify if you want to you know

[35:59] come on the show I know I've got some of you guys who are coming on soon but hit me up at

[36:04] canada pinball at gmail.com if not let's all get drunk this weekend and and sing and dance to

[36:12] the bat to see I even have to like stop myself the bat to see have a good day everyone
