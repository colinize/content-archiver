[00:00] What up?

[00:01] We are live.

[00:03] We are streaming.

[00:05] We are talking pinball.

[00:07] We are gonna spend, I don't know,

[00:09] maybe a little bit over an hour today.

[00:11] There's not a ton of news going on in the pinball world.

[00:14] Everybody knows that,

[00:15] but we're gonna go around and talk about everything happening.

[00:18] Let's get people on Facebook here.

[00:20] I think I might be moving this back to Facebook live.

[00:23] People I got to be honest.

[00:26] It just doesn't really make any more monetary sense to be here.

[00:32] I'm basically losing so much money doing it here.

[00:39] I mean that.

[00:40] I don't know what to tell you.

[00:41] I don't even know how to figure these damn super chats at.

[00:43] Nobody does them.

[00:45] I had a good thing going on Facebook live.

[00:47] I was making a few hundred bucks a Saturday more.

[00:49] Not meant nothing.

[00:50] Nothing.

[00:52] Nothing.

[00:54] So, you know, I don't know.

[00:56] I don't think it makes much sense to keep it here.

[00:57] I mean, I do like the quality of this,

[00:59] but I don't know.

[01:00] Well, we're gonna test it both ways

[01:02] because in the end, what would you do?

[01:05] Would you stay in the platform where you've lost all revenue

[01:08] or would you go where you have made a few bucks

[01:10] every Saturday morning?

[01:11] Cause I spend a decent amount of time

[01:13] making this content be all.

[01:16] Remember, one distro sells one only,

[01:18] makes more than 90.

[01:19] And two, three LEs makes more than I do all month.

[01:21] What's up, Barcelona?

[01:23] What's up?

[01:24] We're gonna talk about what's happening.

[01:26] What's shaking in the pinball world?

[01:29] Saturday morning, spectacular.

[01:31] The time slot, many have tried to copy.

[01:34] Nobody can replicate.

[01:37] We definitely have like sort of evened out here

[01:41] at the 660 subscribers.

[01:44] I mean, I don't know what else to do.

[01:46] Man, there's nothing else to do.

[01:47] I guess I could try some more interviews.

[01:50] I guess I could sell my soul to the pinball devil,

[01:55] but it's fine.

[01:56] I'm happy with where we're at.

[01:58] Facebook sucks.

[01:59] I could do both.

[02:00] I could always do both.

[02:02] I could just put the camera here

[02:03] and just do them both at the same time.

[02:07] Maybe that's the way to do it.

[02:09] I really could.

[02:11] I could do it right now.

[02:13] Should I do it right now?

[02:13] And just, it's gonna be like reverse though.

[02:16] I need to get this like mirror screen

[02:19] to go on the back of the camera

[02:21] because the way they do it now, it's so silly.

[02:28] Apparently Cuphead will be released

[02:30] with fully completed code.

[02:33] Okay, well, that, I don't even think

[02:36] that's the issue with Cuphead.

[02:39] The issue with Cuphead is Cuphead.

[02:41] I don't just don't think anybody wants it.

[02:43] I don't think with all these themes

[02:45] and how much everything is now,

[02:47] I just don't think Cuphead moves units.

[02:49] Cuphead or Guns and Roses.

[02:51] Cuphead or Harry Potter.

[02:52] Cuphead or Jaws.

[02:53] Cuphead or King Kong.

[02:54] Cuphead or D&D.

[02:55] Cuphead or Evil Dead.

[02:58] Cuphead or Medieval Madness.

[03:01] Cuphead or Lord of the Rings.

[03:02] It's just like, I've never met anybody.

[03:05] I've never met anybody.

[03:06] And I'm being sincere when I say this.

[03:09] I've never met anybody.

[03:11] And I'm a gamer.

[03:12] I'm a nerd.

[03:13] I'm a geek.

[03:14] You know, I get in a lot of nerdy conversations.

[03:17] I've never in my entire life met anybody

[03:20] that wanted to talk about Cuphead ever.

[03:22] Or even like mentioned they were playing it.

[03:25] Ever.

[03:27] Never, ever, ever have I met anybody

[03:29] where Cuphead was a topic.

[03:31] I've never even met anybody who talked about it socially.

[03:38] Something like Jones is a Brian.

[03:42] No, Brian, I don't think any gamers are in the Cuphead.

[03:44] It's like that meat boy game, you know?

[03:46] Like, I guess you could play it, but most don't.

[03:49] Lord Olaf and Barcelona.

[03:52] Please learn how to activate super chats.

[03:55] Manuel, is super chats not activated here?

[03:59] I mean, is it not on now?

[04:01] Can you guys super chat me?

[04:06] Let me know.

[04:09] Is it not on?

[04:11] Cause I had super chats once.

[04:16] Let's see.

[04:22] I don't know, I don't see it.

[04:27] Dana, what's up?

[04:30] We got Mr. Dave Sanders in the house.

[04:34] There's no super chats.

[04:36] I don't know why not.

[04:42] Probably your view count fell too low.

[04:46] I don't think it's that.

[04:47] I think it's based on how many subscribers.

[04:52] But who knows?

[04:56] So, yeah, I'm just like, I might have to bring it.

[05:01] I might be going back to Facebook, guys.

[05:05] But here's the thing, Manuel, like, I don't know.

[05:07] I'm tired of trying to figure out YouTube.

[05:08] I don't like trying to figure out this platform anymore.

[05:11] It was a great idea.

[05:13] I'm not going to be a fan of it.

[05:14] I don't like trying to figure out this platform anymore.

[05:16] It was so easy for me.

[05:17] Also, when I do Facebook Live,

[05:18] I don't have to wear this headset and mic.

[05:20] I can like move around more.

[05:21] It can be more animated.

[05:23] I know some of you don't like,

[05:25] but I'm also, I'm just going to be candid here.

[05:27] When I do a Facebook Live now, 4,000 people see it.

[05:31] When I do one of these, it's like 1,500 at most.

[05:35] This, they don't push my content to people

[05:38] the way Facebook does.

[05:40] So Facebook for me is far more reach, far more money,

[05:46] far more money, a lot more money.

[05:49] More engagement, I don't know.

[05:51] You don't push your content.

[05:54] I'm not going to pay to push my content.

[05:56] I don't have to pay to push it out on Facebook.

[06:00] I don't know.

[06:01] I don't know.

[06:04] If I can figure out super chats, like, let me see.

[06:07] Let me Google.

[06:08] I had to set up, like, where are my super chats?

[06:12] Are my super chats.

[06:21] Super chats are visible within live chat during the stream.

[06:25] After the stream, you can find them

[06:26] in YouTube Studio under monetization.

[06:29] Okay.

[06:33] But like, I don't, what I don't get is it's so easy.

[06:38] It's so easy to turn on Facebook stars.

[06:40] Why isn't it that easy to turn on super chats?

[06:45] You know, again, like, I just, I'd like,

[06:48] I think this platform, yeah, but why is that desalic?

[06:54] Why is it based on anything?

[06:57] Why can't I just make money whenever I go live?

[07:00] Why do they have a threshold by which I'm allowed

[07:05] to monetize my work, my content?

[07:08] Do you understand how annoying that is?

[07:11] Like, seriously, how annoying it is

[07:13] that I have to meet a criteria

[07:17] to make my own monetization.

[07:21] Why?

[07:23] Stupid.

[07:23] I could go on the street

[07:25] with an acoustic guitar, no criteria, it makes money.

[07:31] I'm just saying, I'm like, I'm not doing this anymore.

[07:35] I'm basically losing like almost $1,000 a month now

[07:40] on YouTube.

[07:41] Just saying, just saying, that's like easy for you

[07:45] to say, stay here.

[07:49] I will call Kerry Harding, but I had him go in one night.

[07:55] Let me try something real quick.

[07:56] Hold on, hold on.

[08:00] Hold on.

[08:01] Let me try something real quick.

[08:06] I'm going to try another live stream.

[08:10] Wait, did I just turn on paid digital goods?

[08:20] Hold on, here we go.

[08:28] All right.

[08:36] All right, hold on.

[08:42] All right, here's what I'm going to do.

[08:43] I think I turned it on.

[08:46] I went on this other thing.

[08:49] How about everybody do me a favor?

[08:51] Come right back.

[08:54] All right, I'm going to relaunch this show

[08:57] with a super chat to see if we can get super chats on.

[09:01] All right.

[09:03] Can you do me?

[09:04] Can we all pay attention?

[09:09] And we'll come right back.

[09:12] All right, I'll be back in 30 seconds.
