[00:00] Welcome to episode 105 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:28] This is your host, Canada.

[00:30] I wanted to give you guys a little bit of a breathing room.

[00:34] I've had a lot of podcasts and rapid fire since T.P.F.

[00:38] And I think we're caught up.

[00:40] I see the numbers getting around 700.

[00:42] And that kind of shows me that most of my listeners are caught up with where we're at.

[00:47] So, first thing I want to ask you guys to do, and this is me being a little bit selfish.

[00:52] So, this show gets between usually 7-8-900 listens per episode depending on what the topic is.

[01:00] George Gomez, we're at like 1200 listens, which is great.

[01:03] I love it. I love seeing numbers like that.

[01:05] And then I go to iTunes, and I see I only have 34 reviews of the show.

[01:11] Are you guys kidding me? 34!

[01:13] So, some of you could go on there and share some love for this podcast.

[01:18] I would much appreciate it.

[01:20] If you don't like the show, go on there and tell me that I sucked onky balls.

[01:25] But whatever it is, I would love to see more reviews from you guys on iTunes.

[01:30] I think that bumps me up on the list.

[01:32] I mean, I feel like Nate has got the number one spot forever.

[01:35] I can never reclaim or not even reclaim.

[01:38] I can never claim that number one spot.

[01:40] It's like Nate, I think the pinball podcast.

[01:43] And then I'm always like up in that like 3, 4, 5 range.

[01:45] So, anyway, on this episode, I want to start with Dutch.

[01:48] Because we talked a lot about Dutch in the last podcast.

[01:52] And I woke up the next day and I hit up Yop on Facebook.

[01:56] And I just said to him, you know, I proactively reached out.

[02:00] And I was like, you know, like I really think I don't know what the issue is.

[02:04] I don't pretend to know what the issues are.

[02:07] But if I were you, I would find out what number ARA wants

[02:13] and take that numbers to the buyers and give them a chance to pay whatever the extra amount owed is

[02:20] so they can get their games.

[02:22] You know, I really, I really think that's the only way out of this.

[02:25] And, you know, I actually had a, he hit me back.

[02:28] He hit me back.

[02:29] And I invited Yop on the show.

[02:31] I also hit up Barry.

[02:33] And he also talked with me for, you know, a few minutes on Facebook chat about the whole situation.

[02:41] And they were both understandably upset with me that I told people to go sue Dutch pinball.

[02:48] And a lot of people wrote back to me saying, not a lot, but I heard from people saying,

[02:54] like, if you tell people to sue, then no one's going to get their game and that's just going to end in disaster.

[02:59] And it reminds me a heck of a lot of the zidware situation where it was the same type of stuff.

[03:05] People are just recommending a lawsuit and everyone would say if they folded zidware, then no one would get anything.

[03:12] So what was the point?

[03:14] So are we in a similar situation?

[03:16] I don't think this is similar to zidware really at all.

[03:20] But I do think that buyers need to figure out a way to try and get an answer, to try and get a response.

[03:29] So I don't want to beat the dead horse again when it comes to this topic.

[03:35] Yop and Barry both know.

[03:37] They both know that they have an open invitation from me to come on the show at any point to explain what's going on.

[03:47] And what I really sold them on was I will give you the stage to simply explain what the options are moving forward to the consumers

[03:57] and to the buyers of the big Lebowski.

[04:00] And I said it to Yop and I said it to Barry.

[04:02] I just don't think the TPS seminar is really the right medium to explain everything.

[04:10] I'll tell you why because you're not really having a conversation with them.

[04:14] They're presenting to you.

[04:15] Yes, there is a Q&A period, but I also feel like the Q&A period of these seminars is not exactly the ideal time to ask some of the difficult questions.

[04:26] And I also told Yop straight up because he said, I've listened to your podcast and it's negative.

[04:33] And I don't want to deal with the negativity.

[04:35] And I think all of you out there who listen to this show and I also asked Yop to do this, listen to all of my interviews.

[04:44] None of my interviews have ever been negative.

[04:47] They've never been disrespectful.

[04:49] I've always allowed people to have the floor and make their points and I've never really slammed anyone or made an interview in an uncomfortable situation.

[05:01] That being said, I haven't had an interview that's been where the people I'm talking to have been embroiled in such a sticky, icky situation.

[05:11] But look, I wouldn't do anything disrespectful.

[05:16] The questions I want to ask them are, what are the options?

[05:20] Is it a money issue?

[05:22] Is it a larger issue than money?

[05:24] Is there an opportunity for buyers to pay the additional amount owed to ARA to free up their games?

[05:31] Is there an opportunity to free up those 40 games first and then maybe figure out where to go from there?

[05:38] What would make a buyer feel comfortable about this situation?

[05:45] Is it just a waiting game?

[05:47] All these things, I just want to have a dialogue with these two gentlemen about the future of their company.

[05:52] And as I told them, this dialogue is really important to have right now because I think there are a whole company hinges on what they do over the next few months.

[06:03] I really do.

[06:04] I love the game. I've always said Lebowski is a game that was really innovative and took some risks and brought really cool things to pinball.

[06:15] I think you out there really love the big Lebowski.

[06:18] And I think this is a really unfortunate situation.

[06:22] But I also think it's a situation where communication has always been lacking.

[06:28] And we are willing to forgive the things they've said and whatever was the mistruths that were put out there.

[06:38] But I think now is a period where there needs to be ultra transparency, ultra-cherns' parents.

[06:43] And the threat has become the new toxic zone.

[06:46] It isn't an amazing how we always seem to have these toxic zones that pop up.

[06:53] Remember when Magic Girl and Zidware was the toxic zone for a really long time, we've got the toxic zone that is predator and skit bee.

[07:02] And for some reason this hobby can exist without these areas that are just really frustrating, they're really sort of the bad side of pinball.

[07:14] That dark underbelly of the pinball hobby which is pre-order and companies having financial issues and buyers finding themselves in quagmires where they're unsure if they're going to get their game or not.

[07:28] And we never want to see that happen.

[07:30] So the invitation is out there.

[07:32] The invitation is out there.

[07:34] I also find what's funny about these toxic zones is how quickly people move from one to the other.

[07:41] Do you ever notice that?

[07:42] How there's sort of like an angry mob that won't let these threads die down?

[07:47] Like you don't get to wait for a resolution with any peace of mind because people won't stop talking about it.

[07:56] Remember just a couple weeks ago?

[07:58] Like remember a month ago?

[08:00] A little over a month ago.

[08:01] Remember how the Magic Girl thread was inundated with certain individuals saying, we've got to go after these guys and we've got to contact your lawyer.

[08:10] And we've got to repossess all the Magic Girls that go out and we need to make the Raza owners whole.

[08:15] This is a great injustice.

[08:17] We can't not fight for this cause.

[08:20] Where are those people right now?

[08:22] Where is the Hilton of the world?

[08:24] All these guys who were so adamant, the Ice Man is about bringing down and getting a resolution for Raza owners.

[08:32] They have all just disappeared.

[08:34] That thread is dead.

[08:35] That thread is no longer active.

[08:37] And now that mob has moved over to the Lebowski thread.

[08:40] And they will kick and scream and bring their pitchforks to that thread.

[08:46] But look, I don't think waiting it out is an answer.

[08:51] I know that Jonathan over at Pimbal Magazine is trying to talk to ARA about this situation.

[08:58] I don't know what they're going to tell you.

[09:00] If this is a legal situation, there's only so much information.

[09:04] They're going to pull from ARA.

[09:06] I know he was trying to talk to them this week.

[09:09] But the person he was supposed to speak to is on vacation, I believe, and is not back to next week.

[09:14] So we won't get that answer for a while.

[09:17] I know certain people are reaching out to Universal to let them know about the situation.

[09:22] I can't see any situation in which Universal is going to jump in and provide any resources to get a resolution here.

[09:32] Why would they spend any money?

[09:34] I guess what I'm saying in a nice way is why would Universal care?

[09:38] They got paid for the license.

[09:40] And from what I'm hearing, you don't need to worry.

[09:43] People don't need to worry.

[09:45] I believe 300 games were part of the license.

[09:48] Those 300 games can be made whenever now.

[09:51] Like they paid for the license to make those 300 games.

[09:55] If the license expires, I think that goes.

[09:58] The expiration comes into effect after those amount of games are built.

[10:03] So if you're within one of the 300 big Lebowski's that are promised, you don't have to worry about the licensing issue.

[10:11] It is kind of crazy to think only 300 Lebowski's will make it out there one day.

[10:17] That's a very, very limited run.

[10:19] It's the same amount of rob zombies out there.

[10:23] So to have a very limited premium game like this out there, we'll talk about that value at some later date.

[10:29] But I really want to encourage Yop and Barry to come on the show.

[10:32] I really think you guys would love to hear them explain themselves.

[10:36] I think you would love to hear what is actually going on in their head.

[10:40] And I actually really want to get Barry on too because I said this and this is not me being mean.

[10:44] But it's a little hard at times to understand what Yop is saying.

[10:48] He's got a very thick accent and he talks very quickly.

[10:52] And I get it English.

[10:53] English is not his first language.

[10:55] You would think it's not even my first language the way I sometimes talk and a non-seated things.

[11:00] But so let's hope they come on the show.

[11:02] If you guys know them, hit them up.

[11:04] Be like, go on, Canada's show.

[11:05] It's not going to be as bad as I think it is.

[11:09] All right, so that's Lebowski.

[11:12] What else is going on in the Pimble world today that I want to talk about?

[11:16] That is news.

[11:18] So this happened and I'm really on the fence about how I want to talk about this.

[11:23] And if I even wanted to talk about this and I'm not going to go into detail because I made up my mind

[11:30] when I came back to this show a few months ago that I wasn't going to go on these crusades to go after companies to share sensitive information about companies that people send me.

[11:43] And I wasn't going to just expose all this stuff and bring down a ship.

[11:50] That's not what I want to do anymore.

[11:53] I think all of you guys out there know very well which companies I believe are in good shape and which companies I believe are on rocky ground.

[12:02] And it's your money.

[12:04] It's up to you as grown adults to decide where you invest your money in Pimble.

[12:10] And that's on you.

[12:13] If you want to invest in Stern, you want to buy a Stern game.

[12:16] I think there's no doubt you'll get your machine.

[12:19] If you want to go buy a spooky game, I think there's no doubt you'll get your machine.

[12:24] After that, I think you have to have doubts.

[12:29] I would say that Jerzy Jack, I would put him now safely in the...

[12:35] I think you're going to get your machine.

[12:38] What I like about where Jack is at now is remember no one has had to buy dialed in for the full price.

[12:45] There was none of that shenanigans of pay and fall and you'll get it at a reduced price.

[12:50] None of that. There are simply refundable deposits that are being held with distributors.

[12:55] So again, I would say Jack, Gary and Charlie are the three guys where I wouldn't be nervous about buying a game from.

[13:04] I wouldn't be.

[13:07] I would be nervous that I'm going to get attacked for Mars on time after seeing what happened with medieval madness remake.

[13:13] I would be nervous about getting alien on time considering how long and how delayed production has been with highway.

[13:21] I would be nervous.

[13:24] It goes without saying that I would ever get my big Lebowski anytime soon.

[13:29] Would I be nervous if I went in on P3?

[13:33] Yes, I would be nervous.

[13:35] They haven't shown that they can produce games and how fast they can produce games.

[13:40] I don't think I'd lose my money with Jerry but I say you have to be a little bit anxious with whenever you're giving money to these new guys.

[13:48] That's sort of the way it is now.

[13:52] The thing is this though, no matter how much information you give pinball people,

[13:57] it doesn't matter how much you give them.

[14:00] I think people are still so driven by emotion and driven by the desire to have something new that they throw all logic out the window.

[14:09] So what I wanted to just sort of allude to today is that someone is passing around a link that has financial information about highway pinball.

[14:21] I don't know how to read all of it.

[14:25] I know it's a P&L, it's got assets and liabilities and all these things.

[14:32] Someone sent it to me and I saw other people passing it around.

[14:39] Again, I think I've said it from the very get go.

[14:44] It's got to be hard for them.

[14:46] It's got to be hard financially to have such a delay.

[14:49] When you look at the numbers, it is hard.

[14:53] Now that being said, everyone who goes into making pinball machines for the first time has to expect to operate at some sort of operating loss to get your base level of sales before you get into the green.

[15:13] That's true of any company.

[15:16] Because they haven't shipped Alien yet and Alien hasn't gone on the production line, I think everybody would fully expect highway pinball to be in the red.

[15:25] You can't expect them to be profitable yet.

[15:29] But we're right at that point now where people want to see them turn the corner.

[15:35] They want to see production of Alien start and they want to see more than just a few games trickling out the door.

[15:42] I have some good news. I'm actually going to talk to Brad, who is in Houston, who brought home from T.P.F.

[15:50] One of those Alien machines and it's in his home.

[15:53] I think it's the first home use only Alien that's out there in the world.

[15:58] He's going to come on the show this weekend and we're going to record his impressions of the game.

[16:03] I can tell from his feedback on Pinside that he's very happy with the game and he has nothing but glowing remarks.

[16:12] I also found out that at T.P.F. this is for you guys who are wondering that the Alien head was turned off at T.P.F.

[16:21] Remember I was complaining that I kept bashing it over and over again and why the hell wouldn't it work?

[16:26] Andrew had turned it off. I don't know why it was turned off.

[16:30] There might have been some issues that they're working on with it but it was turned off.

[16:34] Which again leads me to believe that final production versions of Alien are not on the line yet.

[16:42] These are still the betas. I said this before.

[16:46] These are the kinds of units that he's putting on location and when Brad brought it home he knew full well that this is sort of like a beta version of Alien.

[16:57] This is not the final final game. He was willing to take that risk and take the game home.

[17:02] I can guarantee you the game is far further along than my magic girl so he probably made it better by.

[17:09] But the game is not on the line and it's April in a few days.

[17:14] So April 2017.

[17:17] I really think the smartest approach for all these companies is to just wait and see.

[17:25] Wait and see. Cost you nothing.

[17:28] Wait and see. Never keeps you up at night.

[17:32] Wait and see. Never makes you hate Pimbal.

[17:35] Wait and see. Never makes you want to get out of the hobby.

[17:40] But running in and paying for something in fall and then having to wait while your money is being frozen.

[17:50] I've only seen that approach lead to anger, lead to frustration, lead to doubt, lead to months of waking up in the middle of the night wondering what's going on.

[18:04] I've never seen that approach really work out for people.

[18:08] I really haven't. I would say it didn't even really work out for people who threw money at Batman 66 before playing the game.

[18:18] After playing Batman versus Erasmus, I still think I think if people had played Batman 66 in its current form, I don't think there would have been such a rush to get a super-eleversion of it or get an eleversion of it.

[18:32] I don't think the game play is there and I don't think it may never be there to warrant what that game costs.

[18:39] You see what I'm saying? My point is when you rush and you just want to give your money because you feel good that the whole reason is I want to feel good that I have one, that I'm not getting locked out, that I'm going to get an alien-ally and I'm on the list.

[18:55] Let's just play this scenario up because I saw on Pinside some guy today, maybe it was yesterday, within the last 48 hours, said, I'm in.

[19:06] I just paid in full for full throttle and alien-ally. This guy just bought both highway machines and paid in full.

[19:17] I see stuff like that and for the life of me, I just can't understand why anybody would do that. What would drive you to feel like I have to pay in full?

[19:30] I know why what he's thinking is I'll pay in full and that bumps me to the front of the line so I should get my alien-ally before people who just have deposits down.

[19:43] That's the promise. That is the promise and that is why Andrew now has from this gentleman what 8,000 for an alien-ally plus what another 6,000, 7,000 full throttle.

[19:58] You just gave Andrew highway $15,000 and now you're expecting to get a game soon. Are you going to get your game soon? Do you care? What's the definition of soon?

[20:12] You see, this is the problem because there is no release date. There is no alien-ally.

[20:19] Let me repeat that. There is no Ellie still. You don't even know what you bought. You haven't seen an Ellie yet.

[20:27] And the fact that you haven't seen when an alien-ally looks like by April of 2017, how is that not just a red flag?

[20:38] It doesn't mean I think a highway is headed for disaster. It just means why didn't you wait?

[20:44] Even like why didn't you wait until Andrew shows what the final Ellie package is and then the next day, why don't you go pay in full then?

[20:53] At least you'll know what you're getting. We all know one thing. The alien-ally hasn't sold out. And the reason it hasn't sold out is two-fold.

[21:03] One, people haven't seen it. So this is that. And two, people are not sure that they're going to get it anytime soon.

[21:13] When Stern announced his Batman-ally, the reason why it sells out the next day and the reason why Ghostbusters sold out before it was even announced, the Ellie's, is that nobody doubts that Stern is going to get them their pin while they're still alive and within a timely period.

[21:30] So that is the information and the news. It's that alien is still not in production and the financials of highway, of course, are going to be in a strange place as they struggle to get ramped up.

[21:49] I think it's a very like, it's got to be shaky ground. It's got to be shaky ground. And all I'm saying guys is you just need to approach this stuff with caution. You need to approach it with caution.

[22:00] And if you do that, you'll be in good shape. Do I think a lot of people are approaching it with caution and that's why the Ellie's aren't sold out.

[22:10] There's going to be that outlier, dude, who just loves the theme so much and wants to pay in full. But Bill Brandness asked a really good question of Andrew Highway on there on Pinside.

[22:22] You should go look at his question. And it's a very polite question of just, hey, I'm really interested. Where are things in terms of production? When do you think stuff will come out and how are things looking?

[22:35] And we'll see if Andrew answers that question. But I think the next couple of months are really going to be it for highway. Like if you see them coming out and coming out in volume, I think then you should think about getting the game if you enjoy the game.

[22:53] I think if you still see no alien Ellie and you still see no Ellie's on the line by April, I think you just have to wonder like what's going on and is everything okay.

[23:06] And if it's not, you know, then maybe it's going to be time to think about getting my money back or putting it somewhere else because as we've been saying, come May June.

[23:16] Come May June when Star Wars gets revealed in that time period and money is going to go in that direction. Money is going to go in that direction.

[23:27] So what else is going on? You know what I haven't done in a while? I haven't read some of my listener feedback to the show and I should because I've gotten a lot of great notes from people.

[23:39] So I'm going to pull up my email and I'm going to read some listener feedback and we're going to discuss what people have to say.

[23:47] So I will pull up first Gregor Weissberger says, hey Chris, thanks for the great recap episodes. Now I almost feel like I was there and he's talking about T.P.F.

[24:00] And he says, I know Aerosmith Pro is totally awesome at the price point, but I got to play it at a local distributor.

[24:07] Wouldn't you be afraid that the toy box gets old soon and then there are not really that many shots to shoot at?

[24:14] And the thing with the music pin is there's no story to follow and then after a while you just hear the same songs over and over again.

[24:21] I mean it's fantastic for a location pin. I enjoy playing ACDC Pro at my local bowling center, but I wouldn't put it in my small collection of two because I would get bored pretty fast.

[24:33] I guess what I'm trying to say is the dialed in really lose first place to Aerosmith, Quantum City got crushed by the dude who looks like a lady.

[24:45] Alright, so Greg, I appreciate the note. Greg, thank you for listening to the show. I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying about the toy box in Aerosmith is such an immediately gratifying thing.

[25:00] It has that sort of magical component to it that excites people who jump on instantly and would that get old?

[25:10] Yeah, of course. I mean everything in pinball gets old. Every single toy, every single wow moment we have, each time we see it, we're less and less wowed by the thing that is occurring.

[25:24] Do I think Aerosmith will get old in a home environment? Possibly. I think with all music pins though, it comes down to what you're saying.

[25:35] You need to love the band to buy a music pin. You need to more than love a band. You need to be like a humongous fan of a band to spend five, six, seven, eight, nine, thousand dollars on a pinball machine because yes to your point, you are going to hear those songs over and over again.

[25:53] So you have to have an extraordinary love affair for the band. I can listen to Guns and Roses songs over and over and over again. So a Guns and Roses pinball machine would never would never bore me or irritate me.

[26:05] Would I get bored of Aerosmith music over and over again? Probably. Probably. But I would argue that Aerosmith would always be a great pin for a home collection simply because it has the total package.

[26:20] It's beautiful. Like the artwork is incredible. It's got fun things to shoot at. It's got a magical toy. It's got great music. And for people who come over, right? For people who come over your house and want to play pinball, it's really awesome pin to hop on and have immediate fun.

[26:37] There's music and drinking beers and playing pinball. It all goes together so nicely. So I kind of think that for the right person, it would be a great home use game.

[26:50] So but Greg, thank you so much for listening to Canada's pinball podcast and I appreciate the note. All right. I want to read a note from Glenn. Glenn Chatfield. Glenn first. Thank you. Thank you for listening to Canada's pinball podcast.

[27:06] So Glenn wrote, Hey, Chris, two to three weeks ago, I found your podcast when you released Episode 90. I've loved every damn episode since your insight and commentary are spot on. You asked the tough questions about the industry. You call out pinball babies and the way the world looks at the pinball people of all levels, including me. You're the hurrah the Rivera of the pinball world.

[27:30] I don't know if you're working off notes or edit the show, but I find your ramblings and interviews very cohesive and insightful educational and most of all entertaining and funny and no senseless tournament talk.

[27:43] Thank you, Glenn. I really appreciate the note. Wow. I'm still getting people discovering the show at Episode 90, which is really cool. I don't, you know, I can't imagine starting at 90 and going backwards in time, listening to the show.

[27:58] You're probably like, what the hell is he doing? Like, why is he going off on this artist for alien and the earlier episodes are a little, they're not that great. I went back and listened to like my first few. But Glenn, we appreciate having you. And I don't do any show notes anymore. I emailed this back to Glenn. I actually just go with it. I've always wanted this show to sound informal and like a conversation and a real time commentary.

[28:26] And also you just get a hang of it. You know, when you, when I earlier on, I had a had to take more notes when I read pinside. But now I commit this stuff to memory. It's not that hard to memorize what's going on in the pinball world. But Glenn, thank you so much. And I hope you listen to another 90 episodes. All right. So this is actually a really good note that I got from, from David. David and I were hanging out at T.P.F. And David asked me and I want to read this because this, this brings up an insight.

[28:55] This brings up an interesting discussion for, for all of you pinball guys out there. All right. So he said, I want to put, he said, okay.

[29:04] Will the collectors say enough is enough with the crazy prices when so many games are intentionally manufactured in scarce quantities? Of course there are always exceptions like Big Bang Bar, Kingpin, King Kong, Magic Girl, etc.

[29:19] As you indicated, these games all have a story for, for how America's most honoured and Rob Zama have regressed in their demand. Batman's 66 Super Ali is no story. It was a cash grab.

[29:34] What are your opinions on where the Magic Girl market is headed, especially after a few games all went up for sale quickly at obnoxious prices?

[29:43] Where do you think the big Lebowski will fall if Dutch pinball can't pull a rabbit out of their hat? A friend of mine sold his Kingpin for 50 grand a two years ago.

[29:54] Finally, I appreciate the invite. So I invited him to play Magic Girl if he's ever in the city. So David, I think it's Paz, Paz, David. Thank you for the note. I appreciate it. And I'm glad you asked because this leads me to something I've been wanting to talk about.

[30:07] So, first and foremost, where do I think Magic Girl is going to fall? I honestly don't know knowing that there's only 25 and it is still super rare and it has that story. My gut tells me that Magic Girl ultimately will end up being somewhere between a 30 and a 35,000 dollar pinball machine.

[30:26] Now, when it hits that price, I don't know. Do I think they're going to sell for 30, 35 right now? Absolutely not. There's too many up for sale, too many are stolen box and they don't work.

[30:37] It's kind of have to be crazy to say, honey, I'm going to go buy something for 30,000 dollars that doesn't function. What the f are you going to do? Right?

[30:50] Now, if Magic Girl gets working, that's the real question. If someone gets it working, if John sort of helps us out and gives us the enchanted hair magnets and we get the center mechanism working, I could see Magic Girl easily being worth 50,000 dollars easily if it's fully functioning.

[31:08] And the reason why, and I get like Big Bang Bar and Kingpin and all these games, even though they're rare, Magic Girl, it's like just as rare 20 versus 10, not that big of a difference, but it's so much more of a modern pin and so much more beautiful and colorful.

[31:27] I would say Magic, or maybe Kingpin, but look, it's such a far distance to get there that I don't know if it'll ever get there. So I wouldn't bank on it. If you want to buy a Magic Girl now and you spend 20, 25 and you think it's going to be worth 51 day, good luck. You could be waiting a decade or more.

[31:47] So, Batman 66, SLE, yes it was a cash grab. Do I think that game is worth that? I can't even begin to tell you guys whenever I stand in front of a Batman 66. I don't see anywhere near a 15,000 dollar pinball machine. If you stand in front of Magic Girl, you can easily see how this thing could be worth 15,000 dollars.

[32:13] If you put it next to everything, if you lined up Magic Girl, Batman, Big Lebowski, dialed in, blah, blah, blah, blah, put it down the list. When I got back from T.P.F. and I looked at Magic Girl, I said, damn Brenda, damn it's still the prettiest and most interesting looking pinball machine I've ever seen. Nothing even comes close to it in terms of a work of art, in terms of a light show. It just doesn't. And sound and music, it's incredible. And Batman, it just feels like another stern to me. It does. It's like a prettier version.

[32:42] But it's still another stern. Now, Lebowski, if Dutch folds tomorrow, absolutely big Lebowski's will be worth a ton of money. Absolutely. If they never come out, if they never come out, the guys who have them, I think, are sitting on pinball machines that are insulin worth 20,000 dollars. Good luck getting one. Good luck getting one. That's only if we feel like Dutch has collapsed and no more are being made. Now it's interesting there. If Dutch Colour

[33:12] collapses, those 40 machines that are made now become prize sought after Grail Games. What happens to those? Do they go to the 40 owners or Dutch

[33:27] Clare's bankruptcy? Do those 40 games go to the auction block? Do we pull the Hilton here? Does Hilton start going into that threat and demanding that those 40 games go up for auction to make the other Lebowski buyers hold?

[33:41] Would be pretty hypocritical of him not to demand that if that happened. I hope it doesn't happen. I hope they make everyone that was ordered.

[33:51] But absolutely, I think Lebowski would become a very, very sought after pin. The code is not nearly done. The game play is still average at best.

[34:05] But we're talking scarcity. That's a story. There's a real story there. These guys tried to make a game. They were... they innovated a lot of cool things. They put a bowling alley into a pinball machine.

[34:17] They're from the Netherlands. They got in a fight with their manufacturer and they couldn't afford to make the games. They went belly up. That's a story. That's a story that will always hold value.

[34:30] The things that almost were... those become the rare items in a lot of collectible hobbies. This was the Boba Fett with the spring rocket launcher on his back. They realized they couldn't make it because it was not safe for kids and they stopped producing it.

[34:51] They were saying that that's the rare one everybody wants. They couldn't make this game. That's the rare one that everyone's going to want. I think Lebowski prices will skyrocket if that happens. It'll be ironic because Mr. Kimitjo, who I bought his magic girl from, I probably should have bought his Lebowski instead.

[35:12] I got an email from Michael Alexander. Michael, thank you for listening to Kineta's pinball podcast. Michael said, Kineta, first, my wife and I love the podcast. Thank you. I appreciate it. I love the fact that people's wives also listen to this show. Can I count that as two listeners instead of just one?

[35:33] He said, keep them coming. Nice to hear someone with candor and a brain talk about pinball. I think a lot of people with dispute if I have a brain or not, but I do think the candor is delivered.

[35:44] Regarding the topic of Jetsons content versus price, I think you hit on something in the podcast. Do any pin companies really promote their product outside of the existing batch of enthusiasts?

[35:56] You mentioned the pinball company promoting their Facebook Jetsons post. Could it be part of that? Assumed higher margin is for some advertising to bring in outsiders and grow the pinball base. Seems to make sense. You can justify our higher price when your potential customer base grows.

[36:15] Again, love your work and thanks for putting in the effort to keep us engaged and entertained. Michael, I definitely know that they sponsor that post. There's no way the pinball company is getting 1.2000 likes on a simple Jetsons Facebook post. No way.

[36:34] They want to show more people this game is available. It makes sense. They're business. They're in the business of selling pinball machines. Do I think that pinball companies factor in marketing into the price of the game?

[36:49] I don't think marketing is a real thing in pinball. As a marketer, I say that because I don't really think you need to put much money into marketing. All you need is a game.

[37:03] If you put a game inside a cardboard box, that's all the marketing you need to make money. Marketing exists to sell.

[37:12] Sales is the number one goal of marketing. I do it to sell more of my brand's products and services. I've seen time and time again that all you really need when it comes to marketing pinball is a game in a box and it'll sell.

[37:26] There's only been a few occasions when games go in boxes and don't sell. That's usually because the games are freaking terrible. No one wants it.

[37:38] WWE, full throttle, come to mind. As games that even though they're in box, nobody really wants to buy the game.

[37:46] Let's see what happens with Jetsons. Do I think Jetsons is worth $6,000? Absolutely not. Do I think they'll sell every one at that price point? I gotta be honest. I don't. I really don't.

[37:59] I don't think there's that many people out there that if they want to get a pinball machine for their home and they're going to spend $6,000 that this is the machine they're going to pick.

[38:11] Simply because I don't think if you play it, you'd really want it. Is that fair? To say that, if you played it and then you said to the guy or the pinball company, okay what else you got?

[38:26] He's like, well here's this Erasmith and here's Attack from Mars Remake and here's this and here's Heck here's even like your kids like cars, here's Mustang, here's WWE.

[38:37] Like any Stern Pro, any Stern Pro is better than the Jetsons for kids to play in terms of the game play being there and aren't you also as a parent or a buyer of this machine going to want to play it?

[38:54] And to me that's the issue with the game. If you like pinball and you're knowledgeable about pinball and you buy pinball machines, there's no way in hell you're going to find any satisfaction in owning the Jetsons. You're just not.

[39:07] You're not going to find satisfaction in owning Domino's. Domino's was made to sell to Domino's franchisees owners, the company commissioned it.

[39:17] Now the pinball company commissioned the Jetsons, right? Spooky didn't make this game to appeal to the diehard pinball person. The pinball company used marketing to determine there's a market for this sort of simpler version of a game that would be more family friendly.

[39:35] So let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. I personally when I hear them saying stuff on Facebook, like there's tons of shots and there's so much to do in this game.

[39:44] I don't know. I get it's kind of like sleazy salesman talk that just doesn't seem honest or accurate. And I think people might see through it. If they ask a friend who knows pinball, hey, what about the Jetsons?

[39:56] You know, wouldn't you ask a friend if you're thinking of being a casual pinball buyer who knows something about pinball, what their painting is? And I don't think it's going to be that positive.

[40:05] So we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens. I expect to see the Jetsons for discount sometime in the near future if that's going to be the price.

[40:14] All right, let's see. We got an email from Tim went. I hope I pronounced that right. Tim said, he said, canada 104 was epic. Not so much the Dutch part, but the rap of TPS was fun to listen to.

[40:28] In fact, the shaming of the Dutch pre-orders was pretty harsh. I'm sure they're feeling pretty bad about now. Yeah, I look, I don't think any, I don't think the Dutch people should feel good at this point about what they put people through.

[40:44] So look, there's going to be times when I think this show is going to be somewhat harsh and critical of what a company does. And I do think that announcing the Bob game at TPS was irresponsible, foolish, and made no sense.

[40:59] I really do. And if that makes people feel bad, so be it. And I know you guys agree with that with that sentiment that I have around that. All right, he wrote, anyways, the Erasmith review was a blast.

[41:10] I love the analysis of the game. I'm probably going to have at most two, maybe three machines in my collection. I already have one new box stern.

[41:19] So my next purchase is going to be tough with all the choices on the horizon. Right now, I'm saving up for dialed in or Houdini.

[41:28] I'm a big magic history buff so the Houdini theme is probably my holy grail. But I'm not a theme for buyer. I want depth and great feeling shots.

[41:38] Houdini seems to be the hot topic on Pinside. So I'm surprised that you saw less enthusiasm in person than for dialed in an alien.

[41:47] By the way, how the hell do these people keep a 14 new in box machines? Okay, so Tim, thank you for listening to the show.

[41:53] Let me tackle what you're saying here. So dialed in or Houdini. Now, if you really want a game that has flow and has depth without a doubt, I mean, you got to go dialed in.

[42:08] There is no way. There is no way someone is going to beat Pat Lawler and his and the flow of dialed in in 2017.

[42:21] I've never played a game that's so buttery smooth. I really haven't that also has so many shots. That's also not just like the typical like looping ramps flow. Right. It's a unique layout with incredible flow, no brick shots, no air balls, tons of stuff going on. I think it's great. It's also $9,000.

[42:44] So it's $2,000 more than Houdini. Now, if you're a magic buff and magic's your thing, then I don't know what saving Quantum City does for you.

[42:54] And if you're not a theme for buyer, then yeah, we're back to dialed in. But if you love magic, how can you not gravitate towards a theme that is Houdini? Right.

[43:05] I think American Pinball has worked to do. Look, and don't get me wrong people. There were lines all week and long for Houdini, Alien, and dialed in. Those were like the three hottest pins at the show.

[43:18] So, and I see people putting up threads already that's like what's better Alien or Houdini? And it's just so stupid and so early to have these debates. And I love to how 99% of Pinside has been played Houdini yet they all have an opinion about Houdini. When you play Houdini, here's what I think you guys are going to know is right away.

[43:41] I don't think you're going to be blown away by the artwork. I think there's work to be done on the artwork. I think it looks computer clip-arty and CGI'd and drop down. It feels flat and uninspiring. So, I hope they tackle that.

[43:54] I also think you'll notice that the shots are extremely tight. I think they're too tight. I think the game bricks way too much. I literally have like a 30 seconds of just brick, brick, brick, brick, brick, brick. When you play dialed in, man, it's like cutting through butter with a hot knife.

[44:10] The way Lawler laid that game out. So, I think it's going to be hard for a for Balsa and a company's first pin to play better than you know, then a Pat Lawler JJP pin where they've got decades of experience under the belt.

[44:28] But these are good. You've got good problems to have and I would recommend just waiting to see where things shake up. The good news is if you just wait, dialed in will be out. It'll be in people's homes. You won't have to worry if you want to get an Ellie or a standard. They're going to be available throughout the entire year.

[44:45] By the time Houdini comes out, you'll know everything you need to know about dialed in and then you can make your decision then. And I think that's a great position to be in. And it's once again, wait and see. Wait and see and you'll be happier if you go that way.

[45:00] Alright, what else do I want to talk about? We're getting, these are also getting a little longer guys. Let me know. Email me if you think these are getting too long. But I think you guys enjoy episodes that are at least less than an hour but not too long.

[45:13] There's a really cool.

[45:15] A cool. A pin-side post about circus Voltaire and the differences between the prototype circus Voltaire and the final production game. I'm not going to go into too much detail but I always find it interesting the little things they change as they're getting the game ready for production.

[45:32] You know, insert changes here, the color of this changes. This one is really cool too because the ring master, his voice is actually much different than the final ring master. And he they've uploaded video into that thread that lets you hear the differences and it's a major difference, major difference.

[45:49] So it's really cool to see the different stages that these games go through to get them to production. So I think you guys should definitely check out that thread.

[45:57] Did you guys see the wizard blocks at T.P.F.? So wizard blocks was the third pinball 2000 game that was supposed to come out. So it was Reventra Mars then John Papadouk's Star Wars episode one. And then wizard blocks was the Pat Lawler machine that never made it out.

[46:17] And there was a wizard blocks at T.P.F. and there's all these pictures of what this is what wizard blocks would have been and someone's working on the game. What's really interesting if you look at wizard blocks is the lights and the layout are like really similar to dialed in.

[46:34] So especially those like those series of lights that sort of crisscross each other from the flippers. Really interesting that Pat Lawler sort of carried over something that's been in his head and been one of the designs he's wanted to try out for really long time.

[46:52] So that that's cool. That's cool. I wonder if don't ever get the wizard blocks fully functioning but it's really cool to see that.

[47:01] Lastly let's end on this. Well also just for you guys in Madison was constant dialed in is in Madison was constant. So if you're in Madison was constant now you can play dialed in on location. So it's exciting to see more and more of the game being tested in public and tweaking before Jack goes into production.

[47:21] So the last point I saw this thread I just had a laugh because once again this was started a year ago is people speculating on whether or not there will be a fast and the furious pinball machine by Stern.

[47:33] And I know that fast and furious is like this billion dollar franchise. I love the films they're just like stupid fun movies right I love cars.

[47:44] The fact that they're like racing a submarine is absolutely the most ridiculous concept ever. I can't it's almost like they don't know how to one up themselves.

[47:56] Remember though was the last or a few movies ago where they had or they were racing down an airplane runway and and someone figured out the length of that race or that scene the runway would have had had had been like 20 miles long for that scene to have taken.

[48:13] And they keep trying to one up themselves in the last movie they jumped a car between two skyscrapers in Dubai and now they're out running a submarine.

[48:24] So it's stupid fun. I also think it's the worst theme ever for a pinball machine. I don't think people who are into pinball are into fast and the furious really that much.

[48:34] I don't think it would sell. I think there's a lot cooler movie themes out there that would would sell much better. I just want someone to make a fifth element pinball machine and on that note.

[48:46] So ladies and gentlemen thank you for listening to episode 105. I didn't even get to the main topic I wanted to talk about. I'll do this in a later podcast but I really want to talk about how difficult it is for machines to be celebrated for very long.

[49:02] The way when I was at T.P. if I just noticed like we've already moved on from Ghostbusters we've already moved on from Batman 66.

[49:09] These games have such a short shelf shelf life of excitement around them that I really think it's becoming I don't know as a pinball lover.

[49:20] If you're a collector and you're a buyer I think it's really hard to justify just keep going after every new thing.

[49:27] I think the smart thing is to wait and buy maybe one game a year and just get the best one that comes out.

[49:32] But we'll talk more about that on a later episode. I appreciate you guys for listening. You saw what I did. I read your emails to me.

[49:41] So if you want to email me canada pinball at gmail.com I will read out your statements and your feelings and you can hear yourself out in the airwaves.

[49:57] And then I will give you my response. If you ever want to come on the show let me know I've got a bunch of guests backlog that I'm excited for you guys to hear coming up soon.

[50:06] We even have Mr. Rare Hero will be joining the show. I wanted to talk to a big Lebowski owner about what his feelings are.

[50:15] So Rare Hero, awesome guy Greg is coming on the show. J.J. from the game exchange we're going to find time to talk.

[50:22] Jared from Stern is coming on. Brad who's got an alien machine is coming on the show. So we've got a lot.

[50:29] And yes I've been hounding Jersey Jack to come on the show. I will get him. I will not stop. I will threaten him that I will I will duck out on my dialed in deposit if he doesn't join canada pinball podcast.

[50:43] Nothing like a little threat to get someone to do something right. 105 signing off. Have a great rest of your week people and we'll talk to you real soon.

[50:59] you
