[00:00] Well, after being accused of buying votes from Brazil, if we do win the sixth Twippy for

[00:06] favorite pinball podcast, we're gonna play this song.

[00:09] Oh, welcome everybody to the world's legitimate Twippy award-winning podcast for favorite pinball

[00:34] podcast over the last five years.

[00:36] We're gonna talk about the Cornerstone games at Stern.

[00:39] We're gonna talk a little bit about Scooby-Doo.

[00:41] Hopefully we're gonna see the code this month.

[00:44] But first, I do want to quickly address this notion that somehow we are cheating to win

[00:50] the Twippy for favorite pinball podcast.

[00:53] And this week, someone put up a post about how it looks suspicious that there are like, I

[00:59] don't know, something like four or five percent of the total Twippy votes came from Brazil.

[01:05] More from Brazil than Australia, more votes from Brazil than the UK.

[01:10] And so I just want to say this, nobody has ever paid for votes.

[01:14] Nobody has bought any votes.

[01:16] And all of my votes, whether they come from listeners of the show or their wives, every

[01:22] single person who votes for a canada's pinball podcast is doing so because they wanted to,

[01:28] not because they were paid.

[01:30] And I just want to say to my fans in Brazil who reached out to me after this

[01:34] accusation and said, Hey, look, Stern makes pinball machines down here.

[01:39] This is a very hot market for pinball.

[01:41] There are a lot of people down here who love pinball and follow the forums and follow

[01:46] podcasts.

[01:47] They might not be as present as some other personalities or other countries in pinball,

[01:53] but there's a legitimate pinball following in Brazil.

[01:56] And I just want to say, I think it's absolutely ridiculous that some people are trying

[02:01] to undermine that pinball has support in Brazil.

[02:04] And the ultimate thing is this, I think it's ridiculous that people are still trying

[02:09] to undermine this show and my hard work.

[02:13] And it is nothing short of just being a sore loser.

[02:16] And I'm going to say this right now, and then I'm not going to say anything about this again.

[02:19] If you want to accuse someone of cheating, then you better show the damn proof and you

[02:25] better validate that proof.

[02:27] And I haven't seen any proof and there is no validation in any of it.

[02:31] And we're going to have a damn good time down in Texas and we're going to have a

[02:36] lot of fun, win or lose.

[02:37] And I mean this when I say this, if I don't win, I'm not going to cry about it.

[02:42] I'm not going to say here we go again.

[02:44] Someone bought votes.

[02:45] I will be the first person to stand up and clap for whoever wins in the streaming

[02:51] category or podcast category.

[02:53] I will be the first person to congratulate whoever takes the trophy.

[02:58] In life, there's no room for sore losers and babies.

[03:02] And nobody works harder than me at making pinball podcasts.

[03:06] I have 762 freaking episodes.

[03:10] I think we need to just move on from this narrative that is just making people look

[03:14] absolutely silly.

[03:16] All right.

[03:16] Now, speaking of silly narratives, did you see this thing now?

[03:19] The new lows that distributors have to sink to to try to get rid of these James

[03:24] Bond 60th anniversary edition games.

[03:27] So here's the deal.

[03:28] This game is on the line now at Stern pinball.

[03:31] This game is going to be shipping to distros next week or the week after.

[03:36] So Stern pinball is going to make all 500 of them.

[03:39] Now I'm seeing something I've never seen before.

[03:42] Distributors are actually posting ads on like Pinside and Facebook offering.

[03:48] They're offering to trade this game for your other games.

[03:52] Like basically I'm going to have this game and we will accept trade ins to get this

[03:57] $20,000 overpriced joke.

[04:00] I've never seen this before and I've been covering this hobby for seven years.

[04:04] There's never been a stern alley where distros needed to offer you trade in opportunities.

[04:10] This is starting to sound like a car, right?

[04:12] Like car dealerships.

[04:13] Trade in your old games and get the new overpriced Keith Elwin 60th anniversary

[04:19] included exclusive, not exclusive topper.

[04:22] The whole game is a joke.

[04:23] It's absolutely exposed everything that's wrong with pinball sales in 2022-2023.

[04:29] And what's sad about this is distributors have no wiggle room to spin this thing.

[04:33] The other thing we're seeing distributors do and they won't admit this,

[04:37] they're basically having their customers sell the game for 17.5 to get around

[04:41] the stern's rule that they can't list this game for a certain price.

[04:44] So look, this game is going to come and go like a fart in the wind.

[04:47] And I think we're going to see some unboxings.

[04:49] But I think when people unbox it and see how little code there is in this game

[04:53] and how ugly it is in real life, that this thing is just going to be like on to the next.

[04:58] We're going to start getting excited about Venom and then we're going to get

[05:02] excited about Foo Fighters or not excited about Foo Fighters.

[05:05] We're going to talk about that.

[05:07] We're going to talk about Indiana Jones.

[05:09] We're going to talk about Jaws.

[05:10] And then we're going to talk about whether or not we're going to see this scooby

[05:13] stream. All right, so let's just go over these cornerstone games for stern Pimble.

[05:16] And I was thinking a lot about this.

[05:18] I just put it up for everybody to see.

[05:19] These are the next four cornerstone games I'm hearing stern Pimble is going to make.

[05:24] And I think it's Venom, it's going to be Foo Fighters, Indiana Jones and Jaws.

[05:28] Now, Indiana Jones was the big sort of surprise for most people.

[05:31] I think we've been hearing a lot about Venom.

[05:33] The game is done.

[05:34] We've been hearing a lot of rumors about Foo Fighters.

[05:37] We've been hearing a lot of rumors about Jaws.

[05:40] But nobody was talking about Indiana Jones.

[05:43] So let's start there.

[05:44] Stern is going to make another Indiana Jones Pimble machine.

[05:48] Now, look, if you're like me and you're like a child of the 80s and 90s, Indiana

[05:55] Jones is an incredible IP.

[05:57] Now, what I'm hearing is this.

[05:59] I'm hearing that Indiana Jones might be a Kapow game.

[06:03] And that's good news because if it is Kapow, they might get more of the movie assets.

[06:08] Now, look, my big fear is this and we've seen this.

[06:11] While Indiana Jones is a great IP, the last movie was terrible, like terrible.

[06:18] And Harrison Ford didn't get any younger.

[06:21] Now, when you look at this movie, I think it's like the dial of destiny.

[06:25] It looks like they're going to be time traveling to different periods in Indiana's life.

[06:31] So I do think it's going to be a mixture of old man Indiana sort of reminiscing

[06:36] and reliving some of his older adventures.

[06:38] And I think the game is going to try to bring that to life.

[06:41] Now, my concern is this.

[06:43] When you try to make a Pimble machine with too many movies involved and the

[06:47] movies are separate from each other, right?

[06:49] It's not a trilogy like Lord of the Rings or the Star Wars movies.

[06:53] Like James Bond is like that.

[06:55] Like you've got six or seven different movies with different villains and different

[07:00] like vehicles and different weapons and different jetpacks.

[07:03] And so when you put it all together, I think sometimes it gets harder to sort

[07:08] of capture the essence of a storyline in the pinball format.

[07:13] So I'm a little bit nervous if this game is based only on the new movie and the

[07:18] movie tanks.

[07:19] What's that going to mean for the pinball machine?

[07:21] Right.

[07:22] So we shall see.

[07:22] Like I'm not sure.

[07:24] Are we going to see the boulder from Raiders of the Lost Ark?

[07:27] Are we going to see like the Temple of Doom?

[07:29] Are we going to see some of those things in this game?

[07:31] I probably doubt it.

[07:33] I think it's going to be based more on the new movie, but it still is an incredible

[07:38] IP, so more to come on that.

[07:39] I also think it is going to be a John Borg game.

[07:42] So we shall see.

[07:43] If we look at this year's games, right?

[07:46] And we look at Foo Fighter and Venom as the 2022 titles, I think everyone's doing

[07:51] a little bit of a shoulder shrug on whether or not these are big enough themes

[07:56] to carry this kind of price point.

[07:58] And we're going to see what the market will bear on these titles.

[08:01] But as I was thinking about these four cornerstones and especially Foo Fighters,

[08:05] where a lot of people are like, well, are they a big enough band to base a pinball

[08:09] machine off of?

[08:10] And I would say this, they do have a fan base.

[08:13] Pinball hasn't really made a ban from the 90s.

[08:16] If you think about most pinball, it's like old dad rock or bands from the 80s.

[08:22] So the fact that we're dipping into 90s like rock and roll, I think you're going

[08:26] to find some audience like in people in their 30s and 40s.

[08:29] So I think that will have appeal.

[08:31] And look, all Stern needs to do is keep their line moving.

[08:35] As long as they sell like 2000 or 3000 Foo Fighters, I think it will be like

[08:42] a successful run for them.

[08:44] And then they're on to the next.

[08:45] Unlike everybody else, Stern pinball doesn't need to live or die by each game launch.

[08:51] Like as long as they're making games, the company is making money.

[08:55] And unlike everybody else, they're the only pinball company.

[08:59] That has like a portfolio of like 75 IPs that are tremendous IPs.

[09:06] And at any given point, they can just run more of older IP that people want.

[09:11] Nobody else does this.

[09:13] Like you can't go get a pirate to the Caribbean from Jersey Jack.

[09:16] You can't go get anything right now other than maybe some guns and roses is that

[09:21] are left over that nobody wants to spend 11,000 on an LE because you can get it

[09:25] used for 8000.

[09:26] So there's no guns and roses on the line.

[09:28] And right now there's a game on the line that nobody really wants in Toy Story.

[09:32] And the sad thing is this, if they were to make more dialed in, more Wizard of Oz

[09:37] games, more Pirates of the Caribbean games, there's more demand for those three

[09:42] titles new in box than there is for Toy Story, but they won't do it.

[09:46] And then you got like American pinball.

[09:48] Nobody wants like more Oktoberfest and Houdini's and that's what they're going to run.

[09:52] Now, Stern pinball is a completely different story.

[09:55] Like people would love to get more Metallica's or ACDC's new in box.

[09:59] Like even though they made a lot of those games, new people coming into the hobby,

[10:03] they want to unbox a brand new game that they know is great.

[10:06] And Stern pinball doesn't even need to do that.

[10:09] Like they're busy making backlog orders.

[10:11] I mean, they're making Godzilla.

[10:12] They're going to make more Elvira's like the games they're going to make in 2023.

[10:17] Half of them are still going to be backordered games.

[10:20] And then they're going to throw Venom on the line.

[10:22] And then they're going to throw Foo Fighters.

[10:23] I think we're going to see Venom in March and Foo Fighters sometime in September.

[10:28] And then I think we're going to see Indiana Jones like early 2024.

[10:32] And I think they're going to bring out Jaws in the summer of 2024.

[10:35] So that's my guess.

[10:36] I'm not 100 percent sure on the order of all these games,

[10:39] but I definitely think we're going to see Venom next.

[10:42] And look, I think everyone's starting to have a sort of general feeling.

[10:47] And this is just me reading the hobby, reading between the lines, reading the forum.

[10:52] I think a lot of people are starting to feel like New Inbox is now a not very

[10:58] popular thing to run after.

[11:00] And if you look at New Inbox prices, I think that's the main reason.

[11:04] And I think with the volume of games, just think about this for a minute.

[11:08] Let's say Stern Pimbal in its current factory is making 600 machines a week at full capacity.

[11:14] They're moving to a much larger facility.

[11:17] Let's just say hypothetically, Stern Pimbal gets to a point

[11:21] where it can make a thousand games a week.

[11:24] OK, that's 52,000 games a year.

[11:29] They will be putting into the world.

[11:31] 52,000 games.

[11:34] And then you start to realize nothing is really rare.

[11:38] Nothing is that limited.

[11:40] And if you just wait and see, you'll be able to get all of these games at a better price.

[11:45] And when the code is finished, you know, I just saw James Bond has a code update to 0.84.

[11:50] I'm not sure what that means.

[11:52] I'm not sure how much is in the game.

[11:54] But I don't think anyone is really celebrating these code updates.

[11:57] I think everyone's kind of waiting until there's like a significant update.

[12:01] I don't know if this is a significant update.

[12:03] I haven't seen anything on the code yet.

[12:05] But it does feel like James Bond has a long way to go before the price can be

[12:10] justified with what's in the game right now.

[12:12] And look, James Bond sales are not great.

[12:14] I feel like I'm getting spammed with more for sale ads by distros than I ever have before.

[12:20] There's a lot of distros with a lot of inventory and they need to get these games

[12:25] sold before they take on more inventory with Venom, before they take on more

[12:29] inventory with Scooby Doo, before they take on more inventory with Godfather.

[12:34] You know, distros aren't used to this.

[12:36] And as much as some would like us to believe that games are flying off the shelves,

[12:40] we know they're not.

[12:41] Like you can see the softening in the pinball market.

[12:44] It's good for all of us.

[12:45] I think we're all going to be able to wait and see and get pinball at a much better

[12:49] price over the next few years.

[12:51] And I feel very liberated.

[12:53] I mean, I know I just bought a super expensive Batman SLE, but I really do feel

[12:58] great knowing that there's nothing in those cornerstone games or there's nothing

[13:02] coming out that really makes me have to have it now.

[13:06] Like I'm happy to wait.

[13:08] I'm happy to wait and see if like these games are any good.

[13:11] I'm happy to play them at shows.

[13:13] I'm actually really happy that location pinball is bigger than ever.

[13:17] Like more and more people are starting to realize that playing on location is a lot

[13:22] of fun. You can save yourself a lot of money.

[13:26] I would rather put $500 into Toy Story at Jack Bar than buy one and lose $5,000.

[13:33] You know, I really do think people are going to lose like $5,000 in like a year.

[13:37] Maybe not $5,000, but you're definitely losing $2,000 to $3,000 if you own the machine.

[13:43] So I'd rather just play it on location, have a few whiskeys, play some pinball,

[13:47] have some fun. I mean, that's what pinball was always supposed to be about.

[13:50] You know, just looking at Venom and Foo Fighters,

[13:52] I think the demand for these games is going to be somewhat softer than usual.

[13:57] Like I don't think either one of those is a triple A game.

[14:00] I think these are sort of B themes and they're going to be priced like A themes.

[14:04] And you know, we'll see how that works.

[14:06] I mean, again, the market will ultimately dictate for everybody, you know,

[14:10] whether or not these companies have hit the ceiling and they need to start either

[14:14] lowering the price or lowering the volume of these games to sort of bake some value

[14:20] back into these purchases.

[14:22] All right, so we shall see, but it's going to be fun.

[14:24] It's going to be fun to see people starting to talk about these titles.

[14:27] I'm always happy to deliver these rumors to the world.

[14:30] I probably won't get credit for these rumors in most media places,

[14:35] but you heard it at Canada Spinball Podcast first, what Stern's next cornerstone

[14:40] games are, you know, and there's a lot happening.

[14:42] Like there's a lot of buzz that at TPF,

[14:44] there's going to be a lot of new games shown at TPF.

[14:47] There's also like this buzz that, you know,

[14:50] a brand new pinball company we haven't heard of before is going to be at TPF and

[14:55] show us a game.

[14:56] I think it might be the company who maybe is making Twilight Zone or Big Bang Bar.

[15:01] I'm not sure.

[15:02] I heard that it's not raw thrills making Twilight Zone.

[15:05] So even though I rumored it might be raw thrills,

[15:08] I'm here to tell you on Canada's Pinball Podcast, I got that wrong.

[15:12] Okay, I am wrong sometimes, but it seems to make sense that it might be raw thrills.

[15:17] So we shall see, but I do know this raw thrills is throwing its hat into the

[15:21] pinball space, and then there's a whole new player coming into the space.

[15:25] And then we have all these other pinball companies in the pinball space.

[15:29] It's about to get very crowded during a period in the economy when it's getting

[15:34] very soft. So I don't know what's going to happen.

[15:37] I think we're going to see a couple lean years in pinball.

[15:40] I think a lot of us are going to be tightening our belts and we're going to be

[15:44] closing our wallets and we're going to be enjoying the machines we have.

[15:48] This is always the funniest part. None of you need a new game.

[15:51] I mean, if you're listening to this right now and you're into pinball,

[15:55] you know, deep down inside, you don't really need a new game.

[15:59] To buy a new game, you're going to need to really see something special.

[16:04] Let's talk about just enrolled in real quick,

[16:06] fired by the Cartoon Network for inappropriate behavior with women.

[16:11] And now he is leaving disgraced.

[16:14] What does this do to the value of Rick and Morty machines?

[16:18] Does it go up in value or down in value?

[16:20] I don't think it's going to have any impact on the value of Rick and Morty

[16:24] machines, but I do think it's really going to significantly hurt the Rick and Morty brand.

[16:29] I mean, people are going to move away from that property knowing that he just got

[16:33] canceled, basically. So if you have a Rick and Morty, it's always going to hold value.

[16:37] There's only 750. It's still one of Spooky Pimball's best machines.

[16:42] It's still a fun Rick and Morty adventure.

[16:45] Even though I don't like the way it shoots,

[16:47] I understand why you have one if you have one.

[16:50] And I do understand how it can be a fun Pimball machine in a lineup of games,

[16:55] because it is like a brutal game. Like if you have one,

[16:58] this game is fast and it is brutal.

[17:00] It's not a great machine if you only have one in the house.

[17:03] All right, what else is happening in Pimball?

[17:05] So let's just end this show with Scooby Doo.

[17:07] I'm really looking forward to seeing the stream of this game.

[17:10] I don't understand why anyone would sell their spot now for a loss.

[17:14] I'm seeing just a few people, not a lot of people,

[17:16] just a couple for sale threads where people are losing 500 bucks to get out.

[17:20] My advice is why get out before the stream?

[17:24] I would wait to see the stream.

[17:26] If the stream really impresses people,

[17:28] I think they probably will sell even more of the inventory.

[17:32] The only thing is this, if you order the game now,

[17:35] you're probably going to be waiting a while.

[17:37] But I also think, as I've said before,

[17:39] distros are going to get a lot mince that they haven't sold yet.

[17:43] And they might sell some of those to new customers.

[17:46] So you're not going to have to wait like a year or 16 months to get your Scooby

[17:50] Doo if you didn't order like on day one.

[17:53] But it's refreshing.

[17:54] It really is refreshing seeing that that game has not sold out.

[17:58] TNA has not sold out.

[18:00] James Bond sales are weak.

[18:02] Distros can't sell this 60th anniversary game.

[18:05] And even though some of my friends in the UK are, you know,

[18:08] they're saying stuff like, oh, every distro here is trying to get more.

[18:11] No, they're not. No, they're not.

[18:13] We don't need to make up lies about this James Bond 60th.

[18:17] There's no demand.

[18:18] I bet they've only legitimately sold 200 out of the 500.

[18:24] I bet these games are going to sit forever.

[18:26] Everybody, thank you so much for the support.

[18:29] I woke up this morning and we are now at five hundred and sixty club members.

[18:34] I really do appreciate the support.

[18:36] We have grown so nicely this month.

[18:39] You know, in the month began, we dipped a little bit below 500.

[18:42] We got to like four hundred and like 98.

[18:44] And I started to get a little bit worried.

[18:46] And here we are.

[18:48] Everyone's back.

[18:49] Everyone's having a good time.

[18:50] And I do mean it when I say it.

[18:52] I want this to be a really fun place for everybody to hang out.

[18:56] No personal attacks, no personal attacks happen on my Facebook page.

[19:01] If other people want to attack me or complain about me, that's their prerogative.

[19:05] You know, as I say, the hate you give lives inside you forever.

[19:09] We've got nothing but love for pinball and nothing but love for all the fans of

[19:13] Canada's pinball podcast.

[19:14] And this show means the world to me.

[19:16] It's such an important creative outlet for me.

[19:19] And if my voice sounds a little hoarse,

[19:21] I'm just really tired.

[19:22] It's hard being a new dad.

[19:23] And even though I'm tired, I love making you weekly pinball content.

[19:28] And if you just signed up for the show, trust me, you're going to get your money's worth.

[19:32] We do this at least two times a week and we hit what's relevant and what's timely

[19:37] in pinball and we do it in a way that's not trying to sell you anything.

[19:41] We're just trying to have fun talking about the hobby in an objective way.

[19:46] And that is what I think real pinball love is about.

[19:49] Everybody have a good day.

[19:50] We'll talk to you soon.
