[00:21] Welcome everybody to the home edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast. I'm your host

[00:27] Canada. This is episode 372 and man it seems like people are really mad at

[00:34] Canada. We're going to talk a little bit about that and how it pertains to

[00:38] October Fest. I'm reading this thread and once again I'm completely being

[00:43] vilified by the fan base over there but we're going to talk about the

[00:47] ultimate factor with that game but we have to start with the news this week.

[00:52] We all thought that Stern Pinball was going to reveal something very special to

[00:57] the world at Comic Con in San Diego only to find out that the big reveal was

[01:03] no other than Star Wars home edition and I want to talk about what you know

[01:10] it I don't even want to call it a letdown because it's not even a a game for

[01:14] us. It's so weird to me watching all these pinball people get so bent out

[01:19] of shape about the Star Wars home edition. It almost makes me want to do a

[01:23] pin-side baby episode because the fact that people can't realize that this game

[01:29] is nowhere nowhere in the ballpark of a game designed for people who are on

[01:35] pin-side who are like die hard enthusiast pinball fanatics. I see people saying

[01:41] like but you can get a used Star Wars pro for like the same price. You don't

[01:45] think Stern knows that but here's the thing you know who doesn't see a penny

[01:50] when a game sells on the second-hand market the manufacturer. Yes so it's great

[01:56] that you can go pick up a used Star Wars pro but Stern is not going to make any

[02:00] money off of that. It's like when I see Jersey Jack Games trade on the second

[02:04] hand you can get all these amazing Jersey Jack games for $7,500 that were once

[02:09] $9,000 great for us out there as consumers not good for Jersey Jack because

[02:16] people can experience Jersey Jack greatness and none of that money on the

[02:20] second-hand market ever makes its way to Jack and company. All right so what do I

[02:25] think about the Star Wars home edition? I think it's it's Stern testing the market

[02:30] that's all it is it's Stern is testing to see if they can lower the price and

[02:35] make a new-in-box pinball experience just for the home with it with a juggernaut

[02:41] theme like Star Wars they're just testing to see if they can pull people in and

[02:46] look and look if one company if one company is trying to get more people into

[02:52] pinball and make more attractive offerings to people around the world to get

[02:58] into the hobby that you love its Stern pinball and I just want to say something to

[03:03] all the owners and groaners out there that are complaining about Star Wars

[03:07] home edition I think all of you out there need to really really get a little bit

[03:12] of a life because again why are you complaining about a game that's not even

[03:16] designed for you? It's like if you like video games and a video game comes out

[03:22] that's designed for the non-hardcore video gamer do you go on to video game

[03:28] forums and complain that someone made a video game that's not for you and how

[03:32] dare they do that and there is this underlying current in the pinball community

[03:37] and I'm gonna tell you the best word for it is entitlement people feel like

[03:43] they're entitled that every single game that every single manufacturer makes

[03:48] has to be something that satiates everything that the die-hard pinball person

[03:52] wants deep code great artwork great theme great animations well maybe for the

[03:59] die-hard but for the casual person who just wants to put something fun in their

[04:04] game room for their family that's gonna be reliable this is what they're going

[04:10] for with that game all right so when someone walks into a distributor and is

[04:16] shown all the games and and you know they might say hey how much do you want to

[04:19] spend well I don't want to spend five six seven eight nine twelve thousand five

[04:24] hundred dollars well we've got this game for four thousand dollars it's a great

[04:28] entry level game it's a great gateway drug into the more complex games that are

[04:35] out there I've always said I don't understand how anyone who's a casual person

[04:40] who wants a pinball machine for their home how almost any of those people ever

[04:46] really figure out how to play these games and I'll say this when I was watching

[04:49] the streams of Star Wars home edition I was almost like this game plays better

[04:55] than the damn real version of the game because it's easier to figure out what to

[05:00] do I will never ever ever forgive Dwight for turning Star Wars movies into

[05:06] complete complex chess and math and not the movies that we love all right but

[05:12] anyway I'm happy stern is doing this I don't think it really deserves that much

[05:16] conversation it's not for any of us if you listen to the show the game is not

[05:21] for you all right all right what else is going on over at Stern pinball well they

[05:24] updated the code on a game that probably nobody really cares about anymore they

[05:32] did a major code update on game of thrones and I'm not sure why they did this

[05:38] game of thrones once again seems to be one of those games that was based on a

[05:44] huge property but it was a humongous misfirstearn I get that you tournament

[05:51] players love shooting the game because of the flow but game of thrones when

[05:55] you think about that TV franchise you think about the world under glass that

[06:00] they could have created around game of thrones and we have what I think is quite

[06:05] honestly one of the ugliest art packages one of the most uninspired playfields

[06:11] of all time in game of thrones I'm not I am really surprised that Stern went

[06:17] back and applied effort to making more game of thrones code when the one game

[06:25] which is actually beautiful that they actually nailed it when it came to world

[06:31] under glass that needs code didn't get it which is ghost busters and both of

[06:35] those games were coded by Dwight so I am just really shocked that they revisited

[06:40] game of thrones now why do I think they did this I think Stern most likely

[06:45] because game of thrones was a huge property for them remember they had to pay a

[06:50] lot of money to get the game of thrones property my guess is this my guess is

[06:54] that they want to run more game of thrones games and I think they have a lot

[06:59] they probably have a lot of parts lying around in the Stern factory that are

[07:05] game of thrones parts so what better way to drum up new excitement in the game

[07:10] then to revisit the code and if you've read the code update it's it's it's

[07:15] pretty robust they did a lot of balancing out of the different houses in the

[07:19] game so that is why I think they are doing that I think it's a day late and a

[07:25] dollar short on this game I don't see a lot of new people running to go by a

[07:30] game of thrones especially now it doesn't really matter what they do to the

[07:36] code I think game of thrones will always go down as a pretty ugly redheaded

[07:41] stepchild in the Stern portfolio okay because you can go get a used one too I

[07:48] mean I don't know are they gonna try and run more who knows who knows why

[07:51] they're doing this but yeah really curious to see them address that game or

[07:56] anything else going on in the Stern world so look what does it mean about the

[08:01] cornerstone titles I heard Jack Danger on the stream for Star Wars ask I think

[08:06] was asking Tim Sexton how many cornerstone games have you released so far this

[08:10] year and he said to the monsters and black knight do you consider black knight to

[08:16] be a cornerstone game I hope not because the whole building is gonna collapse if

[08:20] that's a cornerstone remember cornerstone is is a juggernaut that keeps the

[08:24] structure up a black knight is not a cornerstone title well if they think it is

[08:29] they really really miscalculated because the sales are not there oh but you

[08:34] know you can go get the black knight record right they keep making these vinyl

[08:37] records why who wants a vinyl record who who I want I don't understand

[08:44] Stern's tactics with some of these accessories to these games okay so they

[08:50] said there's two cornerstones already now we know that Stern's approach is

[08:54] usually to release three cornerstones a year now here's why people are

[08:59] wondering if there's going to be another game revealed before Elvira because

[09:05] Elvira has to be considered a cornerstone title so then does that lead us to

[09:11] believe that well we're not gonna see anything between now and Elvira and I'm

[09:16] here to tell you on Canatus Pinball podcast for those of you who still can

[09:20] listen to me who don't hate my guts and call me all sorts of nasty names I'm

[09:25] here to tell you that Stern will have another big release in the next two to

[09:32] three weeks that it's coming I don't know exactly what it is dress like

[09:36] world ninja turtles it's not ninja turtles even though we do know that

[09:40] Zambieti is working on a teenage mutant ninja turtle game for Stern Pinball

[09:46] which is really gonna be cool but I still think it's gonna fall somewhere

[09:50] into that Jurassic World Jurassic Park area we just heard that game so much that I

[09:56] will be shocked if it's not one of those two everyone is hoping it's Jurassic

[10:01] Park which means it'll probably be Jurassic World but you're gonna get that in

[10:06] the next two to three weeks it is Keith L wins next game lots of excitement

[10:10] around that one I hope Stern does the reveal on that game justice and doesn't

[10:15] just do the typical IGN reveal Jack Danger Stream it and that's what we get now

[10:21] I love I love you Jack I think you're the best part of the streams you know I

[10:24] love you all right so that is what is coming from Stern anything else going on

[10:30] in the world of Stern so one thing that is interesting is I think this is proof

[10:35] in point that Beatles was a a big flop for Stern and what I mean by that is we

[10:41] are now seeing Beatles games for sale from distributors now Stern doesn't

[10:48] normally allow distributors to do this in which they can price a game below

[10:53] what Stern would like them to because once a distributor undercuts the MSRP

[10:58] from Stern or the suggested retail price that really starts to probably

[11:05] earn Stern as a company and earn the other distributors because then you're

[11:10] setting the price right if you price it below market value now I'm looking

[11:14] here I think it's great American who's selling this game here I want to find

[11:20] the distributor because let me see hold on I get it like it's game room guys

[11:25] calm okay so the game room guys calm they are selling new in box brand new

[11:33] Beatles Pimball gold for $6,999 which is a savings of $1,700 remember the

[11:44] game was initially looks like $8,699 now maybe they were priced a little bit

[11:51] over the street value on the game but it just goes to show that Beatles is not

[11:56] selling and it is still there are so many diamond additions on eBay and it's a

[12:02] little comical I really feel bad for the guys who dropped $25,000 on that

[12:08] diamond addition all right but look I just want to close this by saying Stern

[12:14] Pimball and you listen listen to all of you listen people Stern Pimball in the

[12:19] next six to twelve months is going to open up a can of war pass so big on the

[12:27] rest of the industry it's going to be funny and I and I say that not having

[12:33] seen any of it I haven't seen any of it but I have a few trusted sources in the

[12:38] inner circle who have seen what is next they have seen what is coming and they

[12:44] have said to me I wouldn't pull your chain Chris they are about to dominate and

[12:52] they're about to put everybody in their place and are we surprised and you're

[12:59] going to get your game and you're going to get your support and you're going to

[13:02] get your great artwork and you're going to get your great code and they're

[13:06] going to continue to improve what they give us and I I'll say this like Stern's

[13:12] going to drop the mic they're going to drop it in two to three weeks and you know

[13:16] what will that do to the other manufacturers that are out there that are trying

[13:21] to get people excited we'll see it's going to get very very competitive and I'm

[13:26] very excited because it's going to be a a freaking amazing fall to follow all

[13:31] these companies trying to make money in Pimball speaking of trying to make money

[13:34] in Pimball did you see some guy I think it was over in Europe somewhere he was

[13:38] trying to sell his alien Ellie from Pimball Brothers and Andrew Highway it was

[13:45] number 429 which I believe is Alien Day right the month and the day for 18

[13:51] thousand five hundred dollars this alien Ellie was still new in box crazy

[13:57] amounts of money for an alien Ellie machine that has the alien date I've said it

[14:03] before I'll say it again I'm very very positive this game is going to be

[14:07] remade and if you just wait you will get a better built version of Alien Pimball

[14:14] if not you can go take 18 thousand five hundred dollars buy a box buy a game like

[14:20] that new in box have to go you know hunt down all the you know new parts for the

[14:26] game to fix all the issues and all that jazz I don't know there's too much

[14:31] good stuff coming that's reliable that's got a manufacturer backing it that

[14:37] actually has a good story attached to it right that to roll the dice on this

[14:42] stuff now speaking of rolling the dice on this stuff the big Lebowski's they

[14:47] are sold out with coin taker all 38 spoken for pretty immediately I know a

[14:52] bunch of you who are getting them lucky lucky lucky gentlemen what will

[14:57] happen with this when will they go to people that's my big question is now

[15:02] that coin taker has accepted people's money they were wired transferred money

[15:07] by people then now what happens right how how does it proceed from here and when

[15:13] does it happen is it gonna happen in a week is it gonna happen in a month are

[15:18] people gonna get tired of waiting and want their money back the games are being

[15:23] sold as is I'm not sure if the money's refundable I don't even know if it is so

[15:31] it's going to be a really interesting development to see what happens and if

[15:36] these people will get their games what condition the games will be in I think it

[15:41] goes without saying that these games will skyrocket in price there's no way

[15:45] around it there are way more people that want the big Lebowski than don't want

[15:49] the big Lebowski if you go and watch big Lebowski streams you'll understand

[15:55] immediately why people love this game so much it is I think the greatest

[16:00] world under glass we've seen since the Valley Williams era and it also has

[16:05] phenomenal coding in it I mean you get the clips from the movie that you want

[16:09] to see with the voices from the actors in the film and I think the way they did

[16:14] the game and the way they integrated the theme into the game is probably I

[16:20] think the best theme integration I've ever seen since I've been covering this

[16:24] pinball hobby maybe the best movie theme integration of all time and here's

[16:30] why they were just two dudes who love this movie more than anything I mean

[16:35] Barri and Yop love this movie it's their favorite movie of all time and they

[16:39] poured their heart and soul into integrating the theme into pinball and they

[16:43] even built the game remember this they built the game before they even had the

[16:47] licensing permission from the studio so they put everything that they wanted

[16:52] to into the game and I think it showed and I think that's why people were so

[16:56] excited the rest is history the story became so sorted over the years but these

[17:01] machines are still a big question mark for everyone waiting for them all right

[17:06] Jersey Jack pinball will we want get Ellie's are on the line right I just pinched

[17:13] my nose that's why I sounded weird they're on the line and I think that's

[17:15] exciting and I want to just say look people are really enjoying this game people

[17:20] are enjoying this game people are excited by this game people are waiting for

[17:24] their games to come on or you know come out it's really a great time if you're

[17:28] in on Willy Wonka pinball a few things I want to you know I'm I'm curious about

[17:32] one is how many of these games can they build in a week it doesn't feel like a

[17:37] lot of these things are going out it just doesn't I I don't know what Jersey

[17:43] Jack's capacity is on a weekly basis is it 20 games is it 50 games is it a

[17:50] hundred games it feels more like they're doing something like 20 to 30 games

[17:56] go out a week maybe 50 at most I don't feel like they're they're they're

[18:01] making many more we know we know Stern can do over 50 games a day I mean

[18:06] Stern's just a juggernaut I feel like in like two weeks Stern can do it spooky

[18:10] pinball doesn't a year which is incredible when you think about it right so how

[18:15] many are going out when will the Ellie's go out will the Wonka Vader will the

[18:20] Wonka Vader mechanism make a big difference for people or will they see the

[18:24] SC at 7500 bucks to be the greatest bang for the buck in pinball right now we

[18:30] shall see here's my my take on the reviews I'm reading from people game is

[18:36] still really hard game is a difficult game you're not going to get very far

[18:39] into this game I don't think collecting the Wonka bars extremely difficult but

[18:44] it has it has that one more game appeal to people I think people find the game

[18:49] gorgeous I think when you stand over Willy Wonka you will find it to be one of

[18:53] the most beautiful pins to stand over and all Jersey Jack games are sort of

[18:57] like that I mean they they just look better than anything else out there right

[19:02] now in terms of the overall package now Jersey Jack artwork if you ask me is

[19:08] nowhere near as good as Stern artwork right now that's the one you kill these

[19:12] heel of Jersey Jack's overall presentation to me is the artwork I don't know

[19:16] why it's not that great you would think for a company that wants to be the

[19:20] premium that they would have found away by now just to get better hand drawn

[19:24] artwork on to the games but but it is what it is okay it is what it is so you

[19:31] know curious to see the LEDs in the wild and how many of them get out there and

[19:35] how quickly they get out there now the next thing Jack has to do he eventually

[19:40] has to show the collector's editions what they're getting like what is the

[19:44] actual collector's edition going to look like what will the sparkle look like on

[19:50] a play field what will the top or look like how will the overall package how

[19:55] will it be delivered to consumers and will consumers see the value in those

[20:00] collectors editions now you know me he waited too long to sort of get those

[20:05] 500 into people's hands I think there will be collectors editions of Willy

[20:10] Wonka available for a long time what I think will happen is distributors will

[20:15] stock up on them but you will still be able to get them for a very very long

[20:20] time now I think it's a little bit of a race here's the race I see going on

[20:24] you've got Willy Wonka is in the lead right now in terms of great game of the

[20:29] summer you know it shoots phenomenally well people are people are really enjoying

[20:33] it it's in the lead now there is a dark horse not a black night there is a dark

[20:38] horse that is going to come out and enter this race and will it catch and

[20:44] exceed people's excitement that has been building for Willy Wonka and that's

[20:48] Stern's next title now I think Jersey Jack always gives you a little bit more

[20:54] maybe a lot more you could argue then Stern does in terms of overall sort of

[20:58] premium pinball experience but man Stern's got the themes Stern's got a lot

[21:04] going for it and I heard this next game is going to be a phenomenal game from

[21:09] Stern so I'm just excited to see those two battle it out it's really going to

[21:12] be Stern's next game which we think is Elwyn's game versus Willy Wonka and

[21:17] made a Victor get the spoils on this one right it's going to be awesome to see

[21:21] those two go head to head and will will the Willy Wonka sales start to decline

[21:26] will they start to sort of freeze a little bit as more and more people get the

[21:31] game more and more streams go up will there start to be wonka fatigue now we

[21:36] know fatigue always sets in there's only so much time in which you can keep a

[21:40] game exciting now I think what they need to do to keep the game exciting is to

[21:44] keep going back and exploring some new code updates and you know what I want in

[21:49] those code updates I'm not even gonna say it but there's a golden goose golden

[21:54] egg opportunity for Jack to get people even more excited with Willy Wonka if

[21:59] they touch the code and polish it and add those voice clips in all right what

[22:03] else is going on in pinball so here's here's where I've been reading some some

[22:07] really negative stuff about me a really negative stuff I want to read maybe I

[22:12] got something wrong and if I got this wrong I do apologize I think I said in my

[22:17] previous podcast that American pinball had a sale 10% off everything if you

[22:23] spend a hundred dollars or more and apparently I think I was incorrect in

[22:28] stating that that 10% discount applied to the games themselves so maybe I was

[22:35] wrong on that and if I was wrong I'm sorry I apologize for getting that fact

[22:40] wrong I didn't know all the details of the sale I just assume that if you can get

[22:46] 10% off at American pinball what are you really buying other than the game

[22:51] itself okay I didn't realize I had a huge portfolio of products available from

[22:57] the company that cost you know over a hundred dollars so here's the thing here's

[23:02] the deal and I want to read what someone wrote and I just want to say something

[23:05] once and for all in this topic because I I did something I did something because I

[23:11] think it was the thing to do just to get some facts and information and I want

[23:15] to share with you my findings on it but at first I want to read what someone wrote

[23:19] this is a pin cider archaed him and he says for what it's worth I think

[23:25] canada suffers from confirmation bias and we'll say anything that seems to

[23:31] buttress his assertion that October fest is a failed theme any fool should have

[23:38] known that the sale applied only to merchandise in AP's online store but

[23:44] canada runs with a totally fallacious story that AP is having to discount

[23:50] October fest to get rid of them that that is goes right along with his saying

[23:55] that only 43 posts are on the October fest owner string and so that proves his

[24:01] contention of low interest in the game while he admits mentioning the more than

[24:06] 3,000 posts about the game in the ballser thread for some reason unbeknownst to

[24:12] me he seems to want to see October fest to be proven as a failure maybe because

[24:18] AP did not follow his perfect marketing formula who knows but one thing is

[24:23] certain his opinions are his alone and not to be instantly accepted despite

[24:29] canada's fake news my personal opinion about October fest is that it's a great

[24:35] game and many of canadas guests on his podcast have told him the same thing and

[24:40] yet he continues his same old tired song well archaed him I did one thing I

[24:47] read your post but I want to give you a little bit of information and I want to

[24:52] just put a pin in this one and I want all of you out there who have told me

[24:57] October fest is a great game I want you to listen to what I'm about to say and

[25:01] I've never said October fest is not fun I've never said October fest isn't

[25:08] packed with toys I've never said October fest doesn't give you a lot for the

[25:13] money because it does I've said a few things I said the art package I think is

[25:18] pretty pretty mediocre if not poor with where we are with artwork I think the

[25:23] animations are also very lackluster and poor where we are with animations and

[25:29] pinball I think the rules said is great I think Josh has put a lot of fun stuff

[25:34] into the game I think ballser packed a lot into the game but what I said from day

[25:39] one what I said before we even saw this game was it wouldn't sell that October

[25:44] fest in America would not sell let alone trying to sell October fest in July and

[25:51] August a festival that takes place in October it wouldn't sell so here's what I

[25:57] did I called up the two biggest distributors I believe that are that are

[26:03] handling October fest and I asked them how is it selling and guess what they

[26:09] said it's not selling much at all so maybe they're lying to me maybe they're

[26:15] just you know they've got confirmation bias but the game is not selling and the

[26:21] game that so so then why is the game not selling if everyone says it's so much

[26:27] fun and everyone should experience it and jump on it you know we'll find but

[26:33] the bottom line is sales are the only thing that matters in pinball at the end

[26:38] of the day if you want a pinball company to be successful and you want to see

[26:44] them around for many years to come and you want to see the next creations from

[26:48] ballser and Josh and and the AP team how long can a company continue to make

[26:56] marketing decisions that lead to poor sales and that is my main issue if they

[27:04] have all this ability to staff up to hire all these people to expand the

[27:10] warehouse and the factory and they're you know they're built they're building up

[27:13] their capabilities and yet the sales are not there so I think they're prematurely

[27:20] increasing the size of their company while their products have yet to click

[27:26] with the pinball buyer and I'm not I'm just saying that look regardless if it

[27:34] was stern or Jersey Jack or American pinball if any manufacturer said we're

[27:39] making October Fest I would have said that's a horrible theme to make and again

[27:45] some of you just failed to realize all pinball is fun all pinball is enjoyable on

[27:51] some level and I think they put a lot into the game but it's still not gonna sell

[27:56] and to me that's the ultimate bad decision like that's even worse is when you

[28:03] make a game that's great that doesn't sell then it all came down then it all

[28:08] came down to the bad marketing insights that you that you incorporated into your

[28:15] product like why did we make this October Fest if we were going to do all this

[28:19] work and we were in a design all these mechanisms why would we waste the

[28:23] effort to do it on something that's not going to land with an impact you know

[28:29] in any industry in any job in anything you do in life when you apply a lot of

[28:34] effort and passion into something that should succeed but doesn't you have to

[28:39] then look in the mirror and say where did we make the mistake and if you look

[28:44] at the the other four themes that American pinball is considering they're

[28:51] going down the same mistake road so instead of going on pinside and saying

[28:57] can it has got confirmation bias and he's rooting for this game to fail what

[29:02] you should be doing if you want to see American pinball succeed and you like

[29:08] where they're going you should be calling them up and saying stop get a

[29:15] theme people want don't even start going down a Sherlock Rome you Sherlock

[29:21] Rome Sherlock Holmes Road don't even bother going down you know a Robin Hood

[29:27] Road don't even bother going down a Valkyrie Road or a poker run road but they

[29:33] probably already are down that road far down that road and what have they

[29:41] done what have they done in terms of market research how do they know those

[29:45] themes are going to be popular I I'm telling you right now all four of those

[29:50] themes all four of those themes will get a obliterated by a licensed theme that

[29:56] people have a connection to they will get obliterated by it and so then what's

[30:01] the point like do you really want to see this company fail in fact there is I

[30:07] want to see American pinball be successful I want to see them make good

[30:12] decisions I want to see them apply their efforts in the right areas but you know

[30:17] what you know what and I'm gonna say this and I'm gonna say this do I have a

[30:21] little chip on my shoulder about American pinball yes I do you know why I do

[30:26] because normal hit me up and said he wanted to talk about marketing and he

[30:32] wanted to discuss what they could do and I was excited I was excited to help

[30:35] them out and you know what he did he ghosted me he ignored he didn't follow up

[30:41] and so I'm sorry but in the real world when you ignore someone who you said you

[30:47] wanted to work with and talk to you about stuff I'm allowed to then not be a fan

[30:53] of that company and not care as much anymore and and have a little bit of a

[30:59] bias if you call it that so what he's the one who reached out to me all right I

[31:04] didn't reach out to him and then he decided to no longer talk to me you know so

[31:10] what do I know about marketing look and I'm looking I'm not some look and I'm

[31:15] gonna say I'm not something like guru who like everything I do works no but I

[31:19] do know that this hobby is not hard to get the right theme for a pinball

[31:25] machine it's not it really isn't it most likely comes down to one thing do you

[31:30] have the money to get what people want and I think these companies just don't

[31:36] understand like they're they're they're making games for themselves they're

[31:40] designed they're making games they want Joe Balser wanted to make October fest

[31:44] he says it it's a game he always wanted to make and they wouldn't let him make it

[31:49] why do you think Valley Williams when Joe wanted to make that game years ago why

[31:54] do you think nobody wanted to make it because it wouldn't sell we've seen the

[31:58] black knight experiment fail okay we've seen the dialed in experiment for the

[32:03] most part fail all right we've seen this time and time again people do not want

[32:08] original IP games so good luck retro atomic zombie adventureland right good luck

[32:17] to all those original IP games it's the mountain you have to climb is so much

[32:23] harder and so much higher than just giving people what they want like what's

[32:28] gonna sell more raza or bill and Ted's excellent adventure raza or Jurassic Park

[32:33] raza or teenage mutant Ninja Turtles raza or Elvira it's just it's just the way

[32:40] it is there's no way you can make up people's emotional attachment to themes

[32:46] with your mechanisms you just can't do it you know people say they want like a

[32:50] whitewood or they want fun house yet those games would tank today tank I don't

[32:56] care if they have all those mechs in them they would tank in terms of sales

[32:59] next to Star Wars or Batman or Godzilla or Ninja Turtles or Batman you know

[33:06] they would tank in sales okay so call up the distributors ask them how

[33:12] October Fest is selling you know what sucks is is I've had conversations

[33:16] directly with distributors who have told me that they have sat down with

[33:21] Davo and normal and they've sat down until they're blue in the face and they've

[33:25] tried to talk to them about how to do things differently and and their advice is

[33:31] not followed it is somewhat ignored and what but they don't say that they say it

[33:36] to me on private chats but they don't say it out on Pinside so I'm the bad guy

[33:42] Canada wants again has to take all the arrows and people have to call me all these

[33:46] nasty things look let me read you what someone said about me on Pinside right now

[33:51] let's see let's go there's the last one's funny says um okay let's see someone

[33:58] said he's a destructive lying moron that was Roost King on Pinside well how

[34:04] would you know I'm a lying moron unless you listen Roost King thanks for listening

[34:07] to the show and then what Westman said he's not sold on Wanka anymore he has

[34:12] seen the error of his hype ways and well the game not being what he hoped it

[34:17] to be I'd say all right all right someone else says never believe a word that

[34:22] idiot says he also thinks the game stinks but a pin about a chocolate factory

[34:28] is a golden ticket wrong oompa the polka oompa version is better and that's

[34:34] from vegan 900 yet but vegan here's the deal they're gonna sell at most 500

[34:41] octoberfest probably jack will sell 500 Willy wonkas he already has 500

[34:47] plus orders he'll sell a few thousand Willy wonkas if you think octoberfest is a

[34:52] better theme than Willy Wonka you just need your head examined and again it

[34:57] just comes down to sales all right well look look you know people can get

[35:02] really mad at me speaking of getting mad let's change topics look if you love

[35:07] octoberfest so much get your friends to buy it I just don't see the unboxings

[35:11] I don't see them am I missing them can someone send me a link to all the unboxings

[35:16] that I'm missing all right all right speaking of let me read something that we

[35:20] normally don't get to see or get an insight into now you know pinside pin

[35:25] sides gone through a little bit of a rough patch the last few weeks and and

[35:29] mainly because of the Dutch pinball stuff now what happens is when Dutch

[35:34] pinball comes out and does another one of these shenanigan deals with a

[35:38] ray and getting people's money and you know the whole letter from Barry you know

[35:42] sort of woke up a lot of people's anger and when it comes to whose side is

[35:48] pinside on sometimes I'm like you know Robin is sort of leans a little bit

[35:53] more towards like he's on Dutch pinball side and you know some of the people

[35:58] who got burned in the Dutch pinball fiasco they're very vocal and they have

[36:03] every right to be these people have every right to call Barry and Yop every name

[36:09] under the sun and I know some people are even questioning whether or not Yop was

[36:16] really sick and I and you know I don't condone that at all I mean I you know

[36:21] like what we know is he has cancer it came back and it spread and there's no hope

[36:27] for for cheering him now and that sucks and I heard someone say like oh you

[36:33] know I didn't like play up yeah that's horrible right and I would never wish

[36:38] ill-help on anyone even if you screwed someone out of a pinball game I'm

[36:44] them I'm them I'm not gonna then cheer if someone gets sick but people were

[36:49] speculating whether or not these health issues were real and and or they were

[36:54] just trying to like you know weasel their way out if you will but again can

[36:58] you blame some of these buyers who were lied to so many times they don't know

[37:03] what to believe right a liar doesn't get the lie about everything pinball

[37:06] related but then you just take him for his word if it's something outside of

[37:10] pinball but anyway they banned rare hero from the big Lebowski thread in which

[37:17] he was very vocal I want to read something someone sent to me it wasn't he didn't

[37:21] send it to me but he must have sent it to someone they they passed it along to me

[37:24] I want to read you what the pinside staff wrote to him when they issued his

[37:30] ban word for word because I love it because you know why the pinside staff always

[37:34] annoyed me you can never question them remember you can't question the

[37:38] pinside moderation staff you cannot you can never do that they here's what they

[37:43] wrote to him dear rare hero we are consistently revisiting similar

[37:49] concerns with your posting style you are both aggressive and dismissive of

[37:55] other users and you repeat yourself in threads consistently well for all stop

[38:01] right there they pretty much described every single pinside user right there okay

[38:06] okay okay but then they go on to say the following even your avatar calls people

[38:12] names and it's designed to belittle others you seem to feel that you are

[38:18] entitled to stand in judgment of others and name call and degrade them one

[38:25] observation everyone on our team shares is you do not seem like you are having

[38:31] any fun at all on pinside I'll stop there for a second I love the fact that

[38:38] the pinside moderation staff gets together to talk about whether or not

[38:44] another grown man in the world is actually having fun on pinside and I want to

[38:51] tell the pinside moderation staff something it's not fun getting ripped off and

[38:56] lied to by Barry and YAH so can you blame this dude for not having fun in the

[39:02] big Lebowski thread all right they then go on to say the following given the

[39:08] fact that we do not appear to be able to make any headway with you and are

[39:15] constantly in this predicament based on your misconduct we are issuing a 30

[39:22] day all forum ejection for you should you elect to return after serving your

[39:29] suspension with a new perspective on things and appear to enjoy this site

[39:34] again you will be welcomed back if you return with the same posting style you

[39:41] will be permanently banned please try and enjoy your weekend pinside staff okay

[39:49] what do we think about that you got to love it grown men on a forum talking

[39:56] about pinball arguing about pinball getting mad about Barry and YAH this is so

[40:05] stupid on every level the fact that they need to police people like this and

[40:13] and pick sides like we all know like hilton you know wise snow on pinside like

[40:21] come on repeating yourself being negative not having any fun like constantly

[40:26] stirring the pot it's what every single hyper poster does on that site and I

[40:33] just think it's healthy for guys like Greg to step away and just don't even

[40:38] bother just read same thing with ice man he got banned too they ban his ass too

[40:43] that you know they're on maybe the purge is finally beginning but look I've

[40:49] always said it it's so you know people ask me all the time like how do you get

[40:52] banned from a pinball form and it's like that's how you've got this moderation

[40:58] staff that is so pathetic and so weak and so hypocritical and and so on the

[41:06] side of some of these like complete liars and thieves you know part of what I was

[41:12] trying to do during the Andrew highway error and you remember this I was trying

[41:16] to give you the information you needed to get your money out of highway pinball

[41:21] and and Robin and his pinside staff would keep yanking down the post I would put

[41:26] up and and they led people to lose money but you know what look everyone should

[41:32] just not be on a site if you're not having fun right but here's the thing

[41:37] to it is fun doing everything the pinside staff just described it is fun

[41:43] repeating yourself it is fun stirring the pot it is fun watching grown men get

[41:49] their panties in a wad arguing about pinball it's fun you know this is the

[41:53] thing about like this show and this thing about my personality on these forums

[41:57] is people don't understand I do this show for entertainment value I get

[42:04] entertained when people can't seem to just not pay attention to me like it's

[42:10] funny to me that all these people who think I'm so bad clearly listen to

[42:16] every single show like I I have so much other stuff going on in my life that

[42:22] it's not the if not that important to me but to them it's very important that

[42:27] they make their point about me heard and they continue to talk about

[42:31] canada and vote canada number one pinball podcast in the world all right maybe

[42:38] maybe Ryan's gonna come back he was on head to head it was great it was also

[42:42] like a little awkward it felt like you know Marty and Ryan have a good chemistry

[42:47] and then they I think he's got this new guy Joe who just it's just not the same

[42:51] and they were all together it's kind of like you're with your new girlfriend but

[42:55] you're really like still have feelings for your ex-girlfriend and they're kind of

[42:59] like all in the same room just just pretending like it's nothing's happened

[43:04] but it has happened you need to get Ryan back anyway but Ryan's not he chimed in

[43:10] and said no pill do it every once in a while and I think that's the healthier

[43:13] thing because I know I know my boy is looking for balance in in life and it

[43:16] it's better not to go too deep into this world all right let me read a few

[43:21] emails and then I'm gonna let you guys go how's that sound okay let's do this

[43:26] is pull up my email and canada pinball at gmail.com guys it's good to be back in

[43:32] the saddle I know I got stuck in Atlanta because I was traveling for work and

[43:37] the weather was terrible in New York okay I got an email from Mark felt he says

[43:41] canada drives stern's business decisions again you ever want you ever

[43:46] wonder if stern just sits back listens to canada and then responds canada thunder

[43:51] birds is crap Joe Newhart but the customers love the price point stern people

[43:57] like Star Wars more than thunderbirds Gomez the bar in thunderbirds are better

[44:02] wait I don't even know what this means okay he then writes the real tragedy is

[44:08] that stern is just sitting back watching jjp drown in their own incompetence

[44:13] waiting for their bankruptcy if wonka was any real competition it would have

[44:18] forced stern to up their hand instead we have a catastrophe of canceled orders

[44:25] and crushed dreams while stern casually looks to siphon ever even more money

[44:31] out of the lower end of the hobby well look mark I don't I don't agree with

[44:35] that I don't I don't know where you're getting that I don't think people are

[44:38] canceling wonka in droves I don't think stern is releasing Star Wars home to

[44:43] make it even harder for Jersey Jack to sell his standard edition game I don't

[44:47] think any that's the case I think stern is just doing what stern does best I

[44:52] think stern is focused on making the best games they can I don't I think they

[44:56] could care less I really do I think they could care less what other people are

[45:00] doing I don't think they see anyone as a real competitor and I think they're

[45:04] right and I think Jersey Jack continues you know to try to figure it out and I

[45:10] think wonka will be a great seller for Jersey Jack I really do all right so

[45:15] Neil Shelton who by the way pinquest is sponsoring Canadian pinball podcast and

[45:20] if you've listened to these episodes since Neil donated I'm not really like

[45:24] welcome to Canadian pinball podcast we're now sponsored by pinquest but

[45:29] Neil you know I love you and thank you for sponsoring the show we'll have to

[45:33] figure out how I actually articulate that but this is funny pin-side user CNK

[45:38] KAY he writes remember folks he's the first sponsor for Canada so support or

[45:46] boycott as you see fit I'm doing the latter CNK I don't know who that is from

[45:52] Easterroro maybe that's the guy who booed me it might be is that CJ's

[45:57] account it might be anyway I don't think anyone should boycott pinquest because

[46:02] they donated some money to Canadian pinball podcast I think that's really silly I

[46:06] mean Neil is a really just great guy who worked really hard on making pinquest

[46:11] something that benefits all people who play pinball out on location if you

[46:16] want to boycott people who just like my show there's a lot of boycott and you

[46:23] gotta be doing because I'll tell you who else who else listens to Canadian pinball

[46:26] podcast on a weekly basis mr. Lyman Sheets probably mr. George Gomez a lot of

[46:34] people that stern listen mr. Ed Robertson so are they all bad people because

[46:39] they support the show and I consider people who support the show it's not just

[46:44] with your money it's with your time I mean your time is worth way more money

[46:48] than kicking Canada a few bucks I know guys like Ed Robertson time is worth

[46:53] more money it's not like Ed wrote me a theme song for the show I could just

[46:57] take some of his music and put it as my intro I'm not gonna pay you royalties

[47:01] Ed watch Ed's got like his lawyer like ready to go now all right so I got an

[47:06] email from Michael so I put up on Facebook my Batman super early for $20,000

[47:12] just for a shits and giggles to see what would happen started a whole huge

[47:16] debate about people arguing about the value of that game and Michael Mullen he

[47:21] writes and he says great show I listened to everyone that being said I'm very

[47:26] disappointed you spent half of every episode saying the market is too saturated

[47:31] there's too many choices you don't get back what you invest into a game

[47:35] limited machines aren't really that rare manufacturers are charging too much

[47:41] private sellers are chain are charging too much mods don't make a game more

[47:47] valuable the pinball hobby is slowing down a little etc etc and you're listing

[47:53] it in opened Batman SLE for $20,000 you might as well store it in your friend's

[47:59] game room now because it ain't selling for that much I don't care how great

[48:02] your marketing skills are was that 18,000 offer you talked about even real for

[48:08] $20,000 I could get a Jersey Jack C E and a Stern premium WTF one Michael Mullen

[48:15] let me tell you right now right now Michael yes the 18,000 dollar offer was

[48:21] real I also had people asking me after I took down the 20,000 dollar listing if

[48:25] it was still available let me explain to you real simple while Batman SLE is

[48:30] worth 18,000 dollars and especially my version on day one it's got a playfield

[48:36] protector no dimpling nowhere I've got even got the plastic playfield protector

[48:41] in the shooter lane games men looks like it's brand new games got every mod

[48:45] imaginable all right and they're beautiful mods if you if you don't know what

[48:49] the mod couple did to Batman you have to go look because it changes the way

[48:54] the game looks for sure doesn't change the way the game shoots absolutely not

[48:57] game shoots fine game is one of the greatest coded games lineman has ever

[49:02] done the in terms of theme integration and clips and integrating the show into

[49:07] the pinball experience it's the greatest like TV show movie integrated in

[49:13] terms of the audio visual of any game ever easily hands down it's it's

[49:19] magical what lineman did with the game people want this game here's the most

[49:23] important thing though and here's why I could get 18,000 dollars all day long

[49:27] for this game and maybe 25 now I'm not 25 at least 18 to 20 here's why there

[49:33] aren't zero for sale in the entire world zero there are none and there are

[49:39] only 80 in the world most of which are owned by people who have Adam West

[49:46] personally calling out their name in the game you tell me who's running to let

[49:52] these games go you tell me how often an SLE comes up for sale and lineman is

[49:58] about to revisit the code and make it even better so Batman SLE all day long

[50:04] will hold its value and then some so yeah get ready I'm not selling mine I

[50:10] would have regretted it if I had sold it for 20k I might think about it all

[50:15] right let's see I got an email to do do do do oh I got an email from Nathan

[50:21] Nicholson Nathan I will get back to you on your question about talking about

[50:25] content and the pros and cons you know I let's see RCD wrote words to avoid I

[50:34] alluded to this on the in my interview with Greg here here's the he says love

[50:38] the podcast I'm not trying to be mean but please avoid using these cringe worthy

[50:44] words in the future number one snackable he says it's douchey scopes douchey

[50:51] frustrated it's frustrated mispronounced and frustration frustration and grown

[50:58] men redundant no it's not grown men is not redundant because the men in this hobby are not grown by

[51:05] by any means all right gaining credibility this will be the last thing and then I'm

[51:10] gonna let this show go because I want to go watch the new corvette be revealed said hey Chris

[51:15] this is from Kevin Clements really enjoying your podcast lately sounds like you are being taken

[51:21] to task unfairly for allowing the progression or lack thereof of the wonka code to influence your

[51:29] excitement around this title in my opinion your credibility has gone way up over the past few

[51:36] months you have laid out a solid argument and have highlighted exactly how Jjp has apparently

[51:46] gone out of their way to cheat future game owners out of a mode based game complete with audio

[51:53] synced video clips you have every right to have gone from level 10 excitement to where you are

[52:01] and I wish those in the community criticizing you could see that no one wants to live in a world

[52:07] without excitement and your enthusiasm in the weeks following your visit to Jjp was infectious

[52:14] I couldn't stop dreaming about how amazing this pin was in the days before the reveal

[52:20] then played at mgc and arrived at many of the same opinions you have now too bad for Jjp and for us

[52:28] hopefully they knock gnr out of the park that is a dream theme for me and I can't wait to see

[52:34] what slashes involvement yields all right I just pray they don't hold back with regard to artwork

[52:41] due to the environment we find ourselves in today all right I believe you when you say that you

[52:47] just want to see great pinball one of these days the stars will align for one of these manufacturers

[52:53] and we will see a great theme translate it to pure magic under glass until then what's the day

[52:58] where's the damn star wars topper keep fighting the good fight all right Kevin thank you so much

[53:03] look I don't I don't really care if people feel like I've lost credibility because I flip flopped

[53:09] on wanka I don't care I love the way the game shoots I don't like the way the game was coded

[53:15] that's that's just where I'm at with it okay if you like it go buy it I'm happy you enjoy it

[53:20] that's it I'm not going to say anything negative other than you know my feelings on the game

[53:25] I think gnr is going to be a home run for for Jersey Jack I really do I hope they get the artwork

[53:30] right as well I think the art in Jersey Jack games has just just continues to be the weakest link

[53:36] right now and other than theme integration for me but I'm glad you listen to to to canateus pinball

[53:42] podcast guys I really enjoyed I'm really tired I got to go it's almost an hour we're not going to

[53:48] get over an hour everybody enjoy the games that are out there we're going to see stern's new game

[53:54] in a few weeks I think that is going to be a huge reveal that will have us talking all the way

[54:00] into expo and into raza and into you know Houston's gaming expo and all the it's going to be

[54:08] it's going to be like the fall before we know it and we're going to watch all these companies battling

[54:12] for your dollars and now we've got a star wars home and you've got a twelve thousand five hundred

[54:17] dollar woolly wonk collectors edition and you've got everything in between to choose from good time

[54:23] to be alive and pinball everyone have a great night
