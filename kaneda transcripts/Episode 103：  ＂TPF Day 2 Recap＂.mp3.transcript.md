[00:00] It's day number two of Texas Pimball Festival and it's about what is a ten-fourth

[00:30] 41 at night and I'm going to do my day to recap I was gonna do tomorrow morning

[00:33] But then I looked and I realized that my flight back to New York is at eight in the morning

[00:39] Which means I will be in a taxi, around six in the morning

[00:42] Which means I want to make sure you guys hear?

[00:46] What day to used like before I get back to New York as I kind of want to capture it in the moment in the moment and we heard

[00:54] We heard

[00:55] the intro to this podcast give away our first news item that happened today and that is

[01:03] spooky pinball

[01:05] revealed game number three and it is Alice Cooper as we predict it

[01:10] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle and i know charlie was kind of pissed at me he came up to me he's

[01:14] like i heard you announced on your podcast this morning

[01:17] Alice Cooper and i told him i told him straight up charlie you know like i heard from

[01:22] multiple people that that's what it was going to be and i'm going to report it i'm going to

[01:26] report it if you want something to be a secret at these shows it's almost impossible

[01:32] so much stuff gets talked about and shared at these shows before your seminar and i think i think

[01:39] it's just a lesson for all these companies if you want to keep something absolutely secret

[01:46] the best way to do it if you don't want the information to be spread at the show is

[01:51] reveal before the show most companies when they go to major trade shows they get ahead of the

[01:57] actual physical show itself and they get just get the news out there but no harm no foul i hope

[02:02] charlie's not really that pissed i didn't keep people from going to his film i heard the film

[02:06] was terrific i i definitely want to catch it as soon as i can and i think i've shown spooky

[02:12] nothing but love on this show nothing but love uh so let's start there with uh this Alice Cooper

[02:17] game and i think i alluded to it earlier they didn't show much they showed the artwork uh some

[02:22] hand drawing artwork that's going to be done for the game and look i mean so much of what we're

[02:27] talking about with a lot of these pinball companies is artwork and artwork and artwork because we

[02:31] don't see final games and we don't see full games yet so i i i'm not going to judge this game on

[02:37] this artwork it's too early i need to see how it all ties together uh i think it's a it's an

[02:43] interesting theme for sure the nightmare castle so how are they going to bring that to life

[02:49] with a pinball machine i have no clue i have no clue i love when i see guys on the form be like if it

[02:54] has a magnet i'm in if it doesn't i'm out i i don't have any idea what i do know what i heard from

[03:01] the seminar was there gonna there's gonna be 10 songs of Alice Cooper in this uh they're making

[03:08] 500 games and i believe there are like 6300 dollars i want i want to say that price uh but here's

[03:17] here's the thing and this is going to be a really interesting moment for spooky to see uh if this

[03:24] title will get them uh the pre-orders because we know that uh with the new model in place where your

[03:31] money is non-refundable how will that impact people what do they think it means what it's supposed to

[03:37] is that you shouldn't pre-order a game unless you really want it and i do commend Charlie and

[03:42] company for implementing basically a model that is is is trying to prevent people from flipping the

[03:47] games i don't think spooky games will flip for more than they were originally i i i i think the

[03:55] anomaly that was america's most haunted is over i think people realize with the amount of games

[04:01] coming out this is like a theme that i'm gonna i'm gonna keep hitting on there are so many games

[04:06] coming out that it's almost impossible for things to stand out it's almost impossible for things to

[04:13] feel really special and it's almost impossible to have the spotlight on your game for very long

[04:20] and when i'm walking around the show remember just like a year or two ago how many people thought

[04:25] america's most haunted would be worth eight nine thousand dollars and how rare it was there's a bunch

[04:29] of them on the floor there's like two of them on the floor i saw here at texas um there's there's no

[04:34] lines to play the game there will be no lines to play batman next year there will be no lines to

[04:39] play ghost busters in six months um it you know the attention goes to the new titles when it comes

[04:45] to where the lines are at at texas pinball festival uh and i also think those lines are indicative

[04:52] of how popular a game is and a theme is right now so there were constant lines for alien

[04:59] all throughout the show constant lines for dialed in not as much of a line not as much attention for

[05:06] attack from Mars remake because people have played that game right you don't have to jump on that

[05:11] game to get a new experience uh what else there those were like dialed in an alien really were the

[05:17] two machines that had the longest lines it there weren't that many long lines to play aero smith

[05:22] uh so those are definitely the two hot titles that are coming out so let's let's see what happens

[05:29] let's see what happens i i i think it's looking like spookies going to ship this game sometime in

[05:36] 2017 i'm not exactly sure when but rob zombie production is ramping down so it it's it's

[05:43] going to be interesting to see when this game comes out i like i i don't know why they threw the

[05:50] theme out so early i i've said it i i think a lot of these companies are pressured to show something

[05:55] new at these shows and why bother why you don't have to that's the thing you don't have to make

[06:02] announcements at all these shows uh and i think people feel pressure to do so and and i i know

[06:08] that spookie wasn't originally planning to reveal and then they weren't and so it's out there

[06:14] the feedback will come in on the inside you're gonna have people who love the theme you're

[06:17] gonna have people who hate the theme personally i i don't like Alice Cooper enough to go in on a

[06:24] machine but it's subjective i'm not going to sit here people and tell you i think Alice Cooper is

[06:29] a bad theme and i'm gonna tell you why i'm not gonna say that because i also learn this weekend

[06:34] that as a marketer and someone who always harps on well you better know the market and you you

[06:40] better know what the interest level is or it's not going to be successful i would have told you

[06:46] with with full confidence that i think alvira is an old school theme that nobody cares about and

[06:51] there's not much interest in alvira and if they make an alvira pinball machine in 2017 nobody's

[06:58] gonna care right i would have told you that because i i work with a lot of young people i work in

[07:04] in an agency that's helping brands become contemporary nobody would mention the name alvira in a

[07:11] million years on how to help a brand get conversation going and to get awareness right so in new york

[07:18] city right with all the hipster marketers that are that in date that city and all the

[07:23] Brooklyn creatives that make up most ad agencies alvira is a name that's never spoken

[07:29] the line the line to get an autograph from alvira was humongous it was ginormous

[07:39] i was wrong there is a lot a lot of people who love alvira the character is classic

[07:47] is timeless cassandra was amazing i watched the panel with her dentist normen uh Greg Ferris

[07:56] and it was it was really awesome it was really awesome to sort of see them walk through scared stiff

[08:03] alvira in the party monsters i hope i'm getting these names right i think i am but they

[08:09] they walk through the creation of those games and it was awesome just seeing like the the error right

[08:13] is like this 80s this 80s error where they would go into vagus and reveal the game and it one best

[08:20] game at the show best amusement product and and they had this great video of alvira

[08:26] planting through the vagus hotel on the way to reveal a machine and i it also brought up memories

[08:33] when i was a little kid and i used to get like really excited when i would see alvira for obvious

[08:37] reasons uh and she still she still like attractive it's i'll say it like she's still very very

[08:44] a good looking woman so the line was huge and they when people went to the seminar it was like

[08:50] all right come on come on are are they going to show like the third game they didn't show the

[08:55] third game they announced that they're going to be making a third game with her uh which is cool

[09:00] i i i i definitely think after seeing the attention she got at the show that if there's a new alvira

[09:07] pinball machine it's going to sell i i fully i fully take back my earlier comments about alvira

[09:14] being an old theme that nobody cares about i i i i i was wrong i was dead wrong on that i

[09:20] think there's interest now when will that machine come out i have no idea i have no idea i i

[09:27] can't there's so much machine there's so much coming out in the near future i can't even

[09:31] possibly get excited about alvira three at at this stage okay so let's talk about dutch pinball

[09:39] now i'm just trying to catch my breath here because in dutch pinball i feel like i should start

[09:44] screaming how weird it was to hear yop get up there and and deliver what he delivered so

[09:50] so what what happened with the dutch pinball uh seminar was this and i i have to start this by

[09:59] having a little bit of a caveat went when yop talks he has a very thick accent and it's really hard

[10:07] to understand him it it really is i had a hard time following everything he was saying but here

[10:13] was my takeaway from what he presented my takeaway is this a-r-a and dutch pinball just don't see

[10:22] eye to eye it's a he said she said scenario where basically yop is saying they had a contract to make

[10:29] the games at a certain price and somewhere along the line a-r-a wanted more money for each game

[10:36] being made and they basically were couldn't hold dutch pinball hostage and and keep raising the

[10:46] price basically screwing dutch pinball's ability to to manufacture the game at the agreed price and

[10:52] and and so you know dutch is at the mercy of a-r-a right and so they haven't they haven't figured out

[10:59] a resolution i heard from some people that they're working with a new contract manufacturing firm

[11:05] or they're looking to work with a new one that makes parts for bmw i when someone told me that i'm

[11:12] like what doesn't bmw make the mw's they were like they're going to make it with the people that make

[11:17] bmw's i'm like bmw makes bmw's bmw's not going to say hey hey guys let's stop making those like m3's

[11:23] and m4's and we we we got to run a few big Lebowski's before we uh we make more of those bimmers you

[11:28] know no that's not happening um so they're in talks they're in talks but he but the way yop started

[11:36] he explained how a-r-a and and and dutch got into this quagmire and how the legal advice in the

[11:43] Netherlands is sort of like don't sue you get one chance to sue in the Netherlands and you

[11:47] better make sure your your case is airtight or else you're screwed so they can't do that and the

[11:53] lawyer is like just take your time like take a step back let's see what happens so they're in that

[11:59] limbo period with a-r-a and and they're waiting to see how things pan out it doesn't sound good

[12:06] it doesn't sound good and then yop admitted he openly admitted and then what we did was wrong

[12:12] we tried to cover our asses a little bit and buy some time and we made up the story about the

[12:18] boards being the issue okay so he made it he's like we lied we lied and we shouldn't have done it

[12:25] and and that's that now i believe in in forgiveness i believe if someone makes a mistake and they

[12:30] come clean about it that they should be forgiven that does not mean you regain credibility though

[12:36] that's the problem is so he said that and then what are we to believe

[12:43] you know when he keeps talking about the plans for the future how are we to believe any of it

[12:47] so there's just just incredibly stressful situation going on with big labowski we didn't hear

[12:54] about a solution instead they did i think the most idiotic thing you could possibly do

[12:59] and that's announced another game i can't believe they put bob 2.0 or 3.0 whatever they're calling

[13:06] at the 25th anniversary they said they're gonna make 150 of them they said that something like

[13:13] only 75 are coming to the united states and they also said they're gonna try and make 25 of them

[13:18] by end of May but here's the crazy part you then starts to show photos of it and shows a photo

[13:27] of the of the prototype and says see look it's real and then he says the only problem is the prototype

[13:35] is at a.r.a they can't even physically get to the prototype they made because that's also held

[13:42] hostage by a.r.a along with he admitted there are 40 big labowski's made sitting in a box

[13:49] that a.r.a has possession of that they can't get and so i just think the whole timing is

[13:55] absolutely enane i don't think you could do a worse move when it comes to restoring the credibility

[14:03] of your company it is like a surgeon who's got one patient dying on the table and then asking someone

[14:10] else if they can start operating on them you've got to finish one thing at a time one game at a

[14:17] time and it's it's it's crazy it's absolutely crazy to think that he now wants people to buy

[14:26] game two and and the way they're positioning it is this guys we can't build anymore labowski's

[14:32] because labowski is frozen with a.r.a like they can't go and have another manufacturer make labowski's

[14:40] tomorrow even if they wanted to because then dutch would be in breach of the contract they had

[14:45] with a.r.a so it's basically it's like a mexican standoff with a.r.a right now neither side can move

[14:52] so what dutch is trying to do is say well let's put a freeze on labowski production and then

[14:58] start producing we can produce this bride a bride a pinbott anniversary edition they're calling it a

[15:05] super le we can make this with another manufacturer because we're not contracted to make this with

[15:11] a.r.a i just think the movie is idiotic i think it's strange i think it couldn't be worse timing

[15:17] and i think it it really feels like a new cash grab to sort of raise some capital and and i

[15:24] don't get it i really don't get it how they can how they think this is going to work like this

[15:30] they they're they're looking for $250 deposits on it on this super le and you get a translate when

[15:36] you give your deposit for it and also the fact is this super le super le don't call it a super

[15:46] le stern pinball made the first super le that's stern's thing if you want to make a new version a

[15:53] special anniversary edition why are you calling it a super le i i just think that just it just

[16:00] reeks of a lack of imagination and i think these guys are scrambling and i don't think they have

[16:06] their feet underneath them i don't think anything happening over a dutch is on stable ground and i

[16:11] said it to a few people and i'm going to say it on this podcast if you have your money in dutch

[16:17] i would get it out i would get it out of le balski if you can get it out i know a lot of you guys

[16:25] have your money with coin taker and you're like well i'll just wait it out and i'll i'll see what

[16:29] happens why why are you going to lock your money in for months when there are going to be games

[16:36] inbox shipping that you could go buy you could go if you if alien is in a box and you can buy it

[16:42] why would you have your money frozen in in dutch pinball i also think there's just a principle at play

[16:47] here and i know this is the part that eats away at people it eats away at so many people the

[16:54] principle about these guys lied to you lie to your face about why there was a delay and then only

[17:02] when they got publicly shamed by a ra did they come out and tell the truth i i think it's wrong

[17:08] i i don't feel good about these guys i really don't i i don't trust them i don't believe what they're

[17:14] saying and i can't believe they're moving on to the the bride of of pinbot it's like it's like

[17:21] no you don't get to go on to game two until game one is finished we've seen this happen so many times

[17:30] how can you trust giving dutch pinball money at this stage how someone explain it to me either

[17:37] you're the biggest bride of pinbot fanatic and you don't care and you're willing to take the gamble

[17:42] but i think anyone who goes into dutch at this stage and gets burned has nobody to blame but

[17:49] themselves and i'm not saying it's gonna happen i just don't see any upside you're basically basically

[17:55] going to enter into an agreement with a company that has proven to lie that has struggled to get

[18:01] games out that rocked into expo a couple years ago like a bunch of rock stars cursing out gary stern

[18:08] making fun is stern pinball let's let's let's ask um let's ask stern pinball how many machines they've

[18:13] shipped since libousky run it out the penthouse of the embussy sweets let's ask them how many millions

[18:19] of dollars they made let's ask them how happy stern customers have been let's ask them how many

[18:25] stern customers got burned over that that that tune a half year period so that these guys they

[18:31] they were all they were all bragging and and hot shots of the industry and look how far they fall

[18:39] in and seeing yop up there by himself with nobody else trying to explain this try to talk himself out

[18:45] of the situation i'm not buying it and i don't think you are too i'll say this though in the room in

[18:51] the seminar room nobody really gave him hell nobody really yelled at him or complained it's

[18:56] really easy on pinside because it was funny going back and forth between pinside and the actual

[19:01] seminars the seminars people are respectful as much as i think the guy was lying through his teeth

[19:07] or should not be trusted i'm not going to get up there and tell him that hey i think you're a liar

[19:11] if i had money in on it i might be a little bit more angry but i probably pull them aside at the

[19:16] show versus saying something in front of the big group okay let's like take it off line right if

[19:21] you're gonna really get in a fight with someone take it off line uh but i'm pinside everyone's like

[19:25] you know is anyone screaming is everyone giving him hell no nobody gave him hell he wasn't beat up

[19:31] he wasn't cornered he wasn't threatened he nothing nothing terrible happened to him and people

[19:37] didn't behave terribly uh it's a lot more civil in the real world that it's why i think more of you

[19:43] should get off of the forums during these shows and sort of just check in after texas pinball

[19:49] festival the thread but to be refreshing during these you know seminars i stop people doing with

[19:54] spooky and it's like everyone wants like real time real time you guys work yourself up into a frenzy

[19:58] at the actual show itself people don't really care there's so many games and so much stuff

[20:03] happening here that no one thing really gets talked about or has people going crazy it's just

[20:08] the reality it's like the real world and in real life uh this stuff is not that important

[20:13] alright people are like cool alaskooper like dial then looks cool like alien looks better than i

[20:18] thought like that that's like how people talk nothing is like blowing people away per se um

[20:24] alright let's talk about highway pinball because i had a chance to go in and see i i missed the

[20:30] beginning of that seminar just because i got actually ran into one of my old clients my doctor

[20:35] pepper client was like i heard someone say like caloris and i look over and it was it was the

[20:40] client that i had executed the doctor pepper guns and roses campaign with and he was just randomly

[20:45] here coming out of a random exit of the embassy suites i was just sitting outside enjoying the sun

[20:50] and so i walked him around the show and someone reminded me they said shouldn't you be at

[20:54] highway pinball like listening to andre so i i quickly went in there and when i got there

[21:00] i miss i must have missed like 20 minutes of the of the beginning i was there just to see him show

[21:05] the early artwork that didn't get submitted to fox he put it up there uh it was had a lot of

[21:13] colorful stuff going on i i didn't get a great look at it i know he asked people to raise their

[21:17] hands if they liked it and and only like one person raised their hand so uh we still didn't get

[21:23] to see the the the early artwork and i've said it a million times guys i've been telling people

[21:29] at the show i don't think the le exists they never made it they've never made an le there is no

[21:35] alien le he may make one one day but his inability to produce the alien le is it just it continues

[21:43] to boggle my mind i'm not going to keep beating the dead horse uh it didn't seem too kind to put up

[21:49] a work of orics that didn't get accepted that was kind of like a little weird i'll tell i'll say

[21:56] this out the biggest telltale sign for me and i've been to a bunch of shows over the years and i've

[22:00] seen andrew and the highway crew at a bunch of shows what really stood out for me is that andrew

[22:06] was up there by himself there was nobody else from highway joining him there was nobody sitting

[22:13] next to him i felt kind of bad for the guy him and yeah both of them they both were up there just

[22:19] by themselves no company around them no people this is like alien is finally shipping after all

[22:27] these years every time they would talk about alien the team was up there oric was up there the

[22:32] us team berry was there everyone would always be there talking about the game talking about what

[22:37] they're going to put into alien and then the moment it actually ships the moment the game is

[22:42] inbox going out to people there's nobody up there with them and i was like why is that and i

[22:49] been hearing like rumors that some of the us team is is not planning to work on any future highway

[22:55] games and in this and that and i don't know it's true all i did notice was that nobody was up there

[23:01] with them and i thought that was a little a little strange uh but that being said the the feedback

[23:08] from alien has been great during the show uh and the lines for it have been long throughout the

[23:14] show and i hope you guys who are in on it get it i do think that you guys who are in on an li

[23:21] man how do you feel good how do you feel good about an li at this point i i think they really have

[23:28] they've not shown you something that they have promised you now for months for months do you believe

[23:35] that fox is holding up the approval has it been submitted for approval i don't trust any of the

[23:43] conversation that i hear around the li i don't think there is an li i really don't uh i also don't

[23:49] understand why people are so like excited about the the light it ramps like right the light it tubes

[23:55] there's a reason why tron has that elie lighting on the on the ramps is because in the movie tron

[24:03] the light cycles create that visual there is nothing in the design aesthetic of alien and aliens

[24:13] that has this lighted fiber optic look to it so i just don't even i i i don't think the game

[24:20] even freaking needs it i kept saying that the people the game now looks like a freaking elie i think

[24:26] Andrew sort of kind of put as much as he could into it and and it looks like a really freaking good

[24:35] regular version of a game with with the lighted decals on the inside of the cabinet and the

[24:40] lighted art on the sides i just don't think there's an elie per se like in the normal sense i don't

[24:46] think he has it figured out and i and i think you guys deserve to see it because i i talked to a lot

[24:52] of frustrated elie owners or just like well at least he didn't say two weeks so uh you know

[24:57] that's it i heard 20 highway games or had it possibly towards coin taker soon so you guys who are

[25:04] early on the list you should be getting the game soon and i did notice i did notice i think

[25:09] Andrew listens to this podcast i really do i did notice that the black plastic under the flippers

[25:14] is now black did i say black plastic that the plastic under the flippers is now black and not white

[25:20] so that was the look that was the that was the one piece i was looking forward to signify that

[25:26] they are in final production and those final boards in these games so let's see what happens with

[25:31] alien all right what else happened on day two of tpf i have to be honest i didn't go to the stern

[25:41] i didn't go to the stern presentation today i think it was that i want to say like seven o'clock

[25:46] i didn't go to hear stern talk the the fellows from stern uh i i think it was i know i saw go man as

[25:54] i saw trudeau i saw richi i i didn't go because i know that they weren't going to talk about

[26:00] star wars and i i i don't want to i don't really want to hear more about aero smith i i just

[26:07] not the game for me so i kind of just skipped out on stern i also skipped out on stern because i

[26:12] i i i know stern's about to make huge waves and this was not going to be the show where that

[26:18] happened other than putting batman and aero smith out there for people to play and most of the pinball

[26:24] machines uh that we see out in in you know our stern's there's so many stern's on the floor so

[26:31] it's i skipped that i skipped the seminar like something about like growing what it was like

[26:36] growing up a richi i i skipped that one i i'm i'm i'm in it for more of like the news of the games

[26:41] and i kind of duck out on the ones that don't reveal new games uh i have to say this i had an

[26:47] unexpected very very good time in a most unlikely of places uh i played i went to the seminar for

[26:56] gerry and p3 in multi-morphic and afterwards i jumped on he's got this game is it head-to-head

[27:04] heads up i think it's called heads up you basically play against someone else the two machines are linked

[27:09] and it's kind of like puzzle bobble in a reverse way where all those he's got like at the top after

[27:15] the screeners like those bricks that light up uh and those are the things that pop up and down

[27:20] that you can hit uh they either light green or red in this game and when they're green you want to

[27:25] shoot over one of those bricks and that scores you points now when the brick turns red if you shoot

[27:32] that shot that sends the ball over to the other game like it's super cool like it physically comes

[27:37] out of the person next to use game which gives them more balls which gives them more opportunity

[27:42] to hit green shots and score points super simple like as simple as a rule set as simple a game as

[27:50] you can ever have with pinball and it's so much fun it's so much fun it's like i love it because

[27:56] i just think that pinball is a place where you can have competitive game versus game action

[28:03] that just changes the dynamic see to me pinball is still stuck in like the way our cades were like

[28:09] in the eighties where it's just one player games trying to get through the code trying to get to

[28:13] the end of the game very donky-kong you know very punch out very uh what am I saying my thinking

[28:20] of like oh somebody gave like Pac-Man like you're trying to just get to the level level level level level

[28:24] level level one player right one player is all you really need you can play multiple players but

[28:27] you're not competing against other players i always love games there are more like street fighter

[28:32] two and fighting games i loved competing next to people it was so addictive playing the person next

[28:38] to me knowing i only had ten seconds left i was down by ten points uh i i think it's great i think

[28:44] it's great honestly i was like man Jerry i was kind of thinking to myself you should have just made

[28:49] this game for like five thousand dollars and launched within i mean the most simple addictive game

[28:54] ever look how look how simple tetris is people look how addictive it is look how simple minecraft

[29:00] is look how addictive it is the addictive fun nature of that game uh it's hard to deny it's

[29:06] hard to deny do i say i actually had much more fun playing that than lexelite speed yeah i kind of

[29:12] did um i kind of did but it's but it also speaks to the platform and i do think Jerry could be on

[29:19] the something because his old point is like we can we can keep experimenting with these games and

[29:25] you can pop it in and if a game like this just sort of serendipitously becomes an addictive fun

[29:31] experience uh you can have it and then you can swap in lexelite speed and you can have that

[29:36] and then you can swap in this game and have that so i i think it's really it was really fun having fun

[29:43] with p3 i i i i i i i i went up to Jerry i'm like i'm not just pulling her leg like i really really

[29:48] enjoyed uh competitive pinball it's like a modern version of jowse were like both you know both

[29:54] players are hitting the ball back and forth at each other so it was super fun uh i played a lot

[29:58] more dialed in i went to jack seminar her jack talk i kind of knew that jack wouldn't

[30:06] talk anything about the next game everyone yeah look it's that jack asked the question

[30:11] does anyone know what the original title was for dialed in and it's killer app the reason we know

[30:17] all this is because everything jack has been working on was leaked that time when that employee left

[30:22] so killer app became dialed in uh pirates are the carabane and toy story are the next rumored

[30:28] two titles i think they're really bad kept secrets uh but jack that he talked a lot about dialed

[30:33] and he talked a lot about his company and i'll say this i really enjoyed jack's seminar there's

[30:39] no denying the fact that jack is a great spokesperson he he's entertaining he's a salesman right he's

[30:47] the ultimate salesman and he's got a great sense of humor he's got a great sense of humor it's very

[30:53] sarcastic it's very witty he knows how to make fun of himself and he knows how to engage

[30:57] the crowd so many of these seminars they don't know how to work the crowd they don't know how to

[31:03] do power point jack did it right other than running the presentation off someone's phone don't

[31:09] never do that again but even jack got up there and said hey remember when we launched dialed in at

[31:15] expo he's like well we're never gonna launch a game like that again he realizes like the way they

[31:19] launched it was they fumbled like the way they presented it uh and he was great today he was great

[31:25] i enjoyed it he he he really keeps the energy level high and he didn't show anything on the

[31:32] collectors edition that's really the main reason i was there was to to see if he would show

[31:37] what was gonna be in it and maybe have a picture here there he did show new artwork on the back

[31:42] box it's different instead of the guy holding up the cell phone hand on the back box it's got like a

[31:48] a UFO it looks like and and and it says quantum city on it looks much better it looks much better

[31:54] because we already have the guy in two places we don't need that hand everywhere um so i dialed in

[32:01] jack said it best he's like he's like on my first two games people came up to me and and would

[32:08] would give me honest feedback that they didn't like the game like you know that both games i think

[32:14] was and hobbit are polarizing experiences some people love them and swear by them some people can

[32:20] stand them i think everybody who shoots dialed in loves the game and he said it i i haven't heard

[32:26] anyone say i don't like the way the gameplays that it's not fun um what i noticed about dialed in

[32:31] other than the fact that i think it is really fun other than the fact that i think it shoots

[32:35] better than anything out there right now what i noticed was this when i watched it i watched people

[32:41] play for a long time i didn't see any bricks any brick shots and i didn't see any airballs i didn't

[32:48] see one airball and that just goes to show the genius that is pat lawler that this game has got so

[32:56] much going on on a standard body game and things are all right next to each other and there's no airballs

[33:04] there's no brick shots and i think about watching people play ghostbusters and the balls flying

[33:09] all over the place i think about who deenie which is a real it's got really tight shots and a lot of

[33:15] it is going you know it needs to be worked on because it gets clunky gets bricky and same thing

[33:21] with like alien suffers from some of that like a lot of the shots just don't flow there is a

[33:26] magic art that pat lawler understands and in i understand now why jack was so adamant about

[33:33] getting pat to join the team because nobody nobody really can make a game flow and and and has see

[33:41] what's great about see look i i'll i'll step back and say like richie for stern he his flow is great

[33:47] but pat gives you flow and toys and magnets and everything like he knows how to create

[33:54] everything that you want in a game a bash toy everything's there everything is there and it

[34:00] and it plays brilliantly brilliantly am i starting to shell dialed in i i start i feel like i'm

[34:08] starting to sound like the jersey jack version of hilton but but that's not good right i need to like

[34:16] not sell it so hard i i'll say this my deposit is still down on dialed in nothing has changed my mind

[34:25] did i miss anybody did i miss anybody attack from arms remake still looks really good uh what else

[34:32] what else am i missing i'm trying to just like go around the room in my head and think about

[34:37] certain things that i'm saying uh i think that's the that's the big stuff i don't think i've missed

[34:43] anybody uh i i got to say i my main takeaway from this show uh besides the thing i always say

[34:50] which is everyone's awesome the people are great i i think i think all the people who came up to

[34:55] me and said they enjoyed the show i think all of you listeners out there who have who really

[34:59] enjoyed the gomas interview in the night interview i went up to george i talked to him he's such a

[35:04] class act that just thanked him for coming on and he said he's like he said Chris i got a lot of

[35:08] good feedback on the show a lot of good feedback so i i'm happy and i said look we'll do it again

[35:13] when it's the right time and i really appreciate it i appreciate what he did and and coming on and

[35:18] being very candid i i think he i think he impressed a lot of people with how honest his answers were

[35:24] and i think i impressed a lot of people that i've matured and grown into a podcaster that

[35:30] will get good guests and also ask the right questions and get you guys valuable information

[35:36] you know and again like Charlie guys like i love spooky but if i hear this is going to be the next

[35:41] title i'm you know i'm gonna say it unless people ask me not to say anything i'm gonna say it

[35:47] i don't break confidentiality agreements i have with people i know stuff that i don't tell people

[35:53] on this podcast because i respect those relationships but it's hard at this show because a lot of people

[35:59] see stuff it's like remember when ghost busters all that stuff leaked that was being passed around so

[36:05] many people at at last years i think it was tpf like people had it on their phone like oric was

[36:11] looking at the backlash for ghost busters like months before or people even saw anything like people

[36:15] had it there's this inner circle and these guys are very like selfish and protective over it but

[36:21] if it gets out to canada and no one asked me not to say anything i will speculate i'm a new i'm

[36:25] a media outlet it says media impress on my packet this is what media does we want to scoop things we

[36:32] want to reveal things we want things to be exclusive um i'll say this my major takeaway from the show

[36:38] other than all the great people and the great job that came and ed did putting this show on it

[36:42] continues to be the best pinball show that i go to uh there's a lot of games there's a lot of

[36:48] games coming out and that was the prevalent conversation of this tpf and i think the hobby in general

[36:55] is that my god what happened there's so much coming out at once there's so much coming out at once

[37:02] there's so much to be excited about but there's also the other side of the coin

[37:07] they're not all gonna make it there's not enough room for all these titles i some people think there

[37:12] is some people think there is i don't think i don't think there is i i do think there's a limit

[37:19] and i think at the end of the day what's gonna win what's gonna win is theme theme is gonna be

[37:27] how the cream rises to the top theme is gonna be what drives people to have to have something right

[37:33] theme uh after theme right because i know people are like well then you just said dialed in is not

[37:38] gonna sell well uh i don't know how well dialed in is gonna sell it has a fighting chance to be a great

[37:46] seller because of how damn good it is if you say you love pinball uh and you love fun pinball

[37:53] and you love games that have the following like good flow good music good art good shots like a

[37:59] world in her glass it's got everything you want except for the theme you want so it strikes out on

[38:05] theme but gets it in every other category that should be enough for people to want this if you

[38:10] love pinball uh star wars though it has been hanging over this show like nothing else it is so hard

[38:18] to look at everything here uh who deenie and i didn't talk about them because i talked about them

[38:23] yesterday who deenie alien um attacked from Mars remake aero smith uh p3 dialed in you know all

[38:34] these games spooky you know coming out with a new one all these games all these games still

[38:44] have failed to generate the level of conversation and excitement and anticipation that is star wars

[38:52] star wars is is the one everyone's waiting for star wars is the game that people are nervous about

[38:59] when it comes to whether or not they're gonna be able to land one star wars is the game that

[39:04] people are phoning their distributors to put them on list for uh the rumor for star wars that there

[39:09] might be like a light side of the force and a dark side of the force i think star wars they're

[39:14] gonna make a ton of them i think they might have light side dark side i think they're gonna do

[39:17] character special additions i i think they're gonna make so many variations of star wars and they're

[39:24] all gonna be the same game that none of them are gonna truly be special and i think for the first

[39:29] time you might see guys actually by multiple versions of the same game because they want to have

[39:34] a boba fit and a Darth Vader version next to each other who knows it could happen it could happen

[39:41] what would be cool is if stern looked at what p3 is done imagine having a light side of the force

[39:49] and a dark side of the force where you could actually connect both games together whether networked

[39:54] or in the same room and actually had people battle each other like because you could create what

[40:00] gerry is doing where when you have the network play going though it lights up where you need to shoot

[40:08] like this is where you need to use the force and hit here and if you do then it makes the other

[40:13] players game more difficult to beat you and it's almost like imagine a lightsaber duel between Luke

[40:19] and Vader that's controlled by hitting your shots and your networked see i think that's the next to

[40:26] me that's the most exciting thing that could come to pinball is that competitive play where you're

[40:30] playing against someone else and you each have the same machine i think that's that would add a whole

[40:37] new element to pinball that is sorely missing um but star wars is it and i keep hearing star wars maybe

[40:44] in june i i i just think that manufacturers need to get games in box soon and if attack from

[40:53] Mars can get in a box soon of course that's going to hurt highways ability to sell more aliens

[40:58] of course it will they can't be happy with where attack from Mars is priced at the regular one

[41:04] being sixty five hundred there's no way they can be happy about that there's no way that's good

[41:09] news for spooky who wants to sell five hundred machines of alice kouper uh because there's just so

[41:15] much competition and arosmith is a thousand dollars cheaper than alice kouper will be imagine like

[41:24] think about that stern has arosmith for a thousand dollars less it is a difficult market it is

[41:32] really difficult it's an exciting time for the buyers and and really what people have to do is they

[41:37] have to up their game you're really going to have to give people a very compelling reason to buy

[41:43] your product because there's a lot of competition and competition drives innovation up and price down

[41:49] and it is a beautiful time to be in pinball i've had an amazing time at texas pinball festival i've

[41:55] got to get up in in like six and a half hours to take a taxi maybe that wasn't such a good idea

[42:00] but i love sleeping on the plane then waking up and and i will have uh most of my day in new york with

[42:07] brinda and bubba but everyone out there i want to say tpf is the shit you gotta go if you can

[42:17] and there's so many exciting games coming out and let's see if if everyone gets the production

[42:24] properly let's see if star wars uh creates a ripple effect through the hobby that has a lot of

[42:31] people asking for refunds to go get their bubba fed edition that's it for episode there's i'll just

[42:37] say this is like 103 i guess these are really special edition from tpf but episode 103 signing off

[42:44] god bless

[43:01] uh
