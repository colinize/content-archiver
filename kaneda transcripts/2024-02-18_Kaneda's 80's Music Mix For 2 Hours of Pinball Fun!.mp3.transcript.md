[00:00] I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see.

[00:03] Oh man, Peabody.

[00:05] On all of this.

[00:06] You had this crazy idea.

[00:08] About breeding pine.

[00:09] Listen, Centauri, I'm none of those guys.

[00:11] I'm a kid from a trailer part.

[00:12] If that's what you think, then that's all you'll ever be.

[00:16] This is...

[00:17] This is...

[00:18] M-M-Max Hadron.

[00:20] And what you're about to witness is one of the most sinister sounding intros to a trailer

[00:23] to one of the greatest epics ever produced.

[00:27] Intruder's beware.

[00:56] Wax off.

[00:57] Left hand.

[00:58] This, this, this, this, this...

[01:00] Speak cold.

[01:01] Listen to them again.

[01:02] If you're so lovely to be here tonight, what a beautiful...

[01:04] Give yourselves a round of applause.

[01:06] You're so lovely. Everyone should be lovely.

[01:08] Anyone?

[01:08] I'd like to give a big round of applause to my band.

[01:10] Anyone?

[01:42] We have clearance, Florence.

[01:43] Roger, Roger.

[01:44] What's our vector, Victor?

[03:51] Don't look to a stranger

[03:56] You know in the end

[04:00] I'll always be there

[04:04] And when you're in doubt

[04:08] And when you're in danger

[04:12] Take a look all around

[04:16] And I'll be there

[04:21] I'm sorry but I'm just thinking

[04:23] I've been right

[04:24] Where's the promise?

[04:26] I know they don't sound

[04:27] The way I planned them to be

[04:29] But if you wait around the while

[04:31] I'll make you fall for me

[04:33] I promise

[04:35] I promise you I will

[04:42] I will

[04:46] I will

[04:50] You were working as a waitress

[04:52] And I cut tail for

[04:55] When I met you

[04:58] I picked you out

[04:59] I shook you up

[05:00] And turned you around

[05:02] Turned you into someone new

[05:06] Now five years later on

[05:08] You've got the world at your feet

[05:10] Success has been so easy for you

[05:14] But don't forget

[05:15] It's me who put you where you are now

[05:19] And I can put you back down too

[05:40] Here I am in silence

[05:43] Looking round without a clue

[05:47] I find myself alone again

[05:51] All alone with you

[05:55] I can see behind your eyes

[05:59] The things that I don't know

[06:03] If you hide away from me

[06:07] How can I no longer grow?

[06:11] I won't know what you're thinking

[06:15] There are some things you can hide

[06:19] I wanna know what you're feeling

[06:23] Tell me what's on your mind

[06:45] You are an obsession

[07:01] I cannot sleep

[07:03] I am an obsession

[07:05] I'm an open-edged feet

[07:07] And so balanced

[07:09] No equality

[07:11] You still are one night

[07:13] I will not accept defeat

[07:16] I'll have you

[07:17] Yes, I'll have you

[07:19] I will find a way

[07:21] And I will have you

[07:23] I'll fly to life

[07:25] Oh, I'll fly to life

[07:27] I will collect you

[07:29] And capture you

[07:31] My calculations are correct

[07:35] When this baby hits 38 miles per hour

[07:38] You're gonna see some serious shit

[07:43] I'll be with you

[08:05] I'll be with you

[08:07] I'll be with you

[08:09] I'll be with you

[08:41] Every time I think of you I feel a shot right through in the bow of the hood

[08:51] It's no problem in my hood, it's a problem I find

[08:55] Living a life that I can't leave behind

[09:00] But there's no sense in telling me

[09:03] The wisdom of the hood won't set you free

[09:07] But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows

[09:11] Well, every day my confusion grows

[09:15] When I dock, are you telling me that you built a time machine?

[09:19] If you're gonna build a time machine, why not do it some style?

[09:22] Style

[10:36] I travel the world and the seven seas

[10:40] Everybody's looking for something

[10:44] Some of them want to use you

[10:47] Some of them want to get used by you

[10:51] Some of them want to abuse you

[10:55] Some of them want to be abused

[11:02] You know there's gonna be sex, drugs, rock and roll

[11:14] Rock, rock, rock and roll, rock and roll, rock and roll

[11:17] I just died on your own, it's tonight

[11:22] You must've been something you said

[50:55] Baby, I would rather leave you dead

[50:59] This is Don Bruz, the cameo parkway records

[51:20] You just put the needle on a really unique record album

[51:23] Here is a complete disc jockey show

[51:25] With all the modern pace of today's exciting radio

[51:34] Looking in your eyes, I see a paradise

[51:38] This world that I found is too good to be true

[51:42] Standing here beside you

[51:45] Wants so much to give you this love in my heart

[51:49] That I'm feeling for you

[51:52] Let them see what's crazy

[51:54] I don't care about that

[51:56] Put your hands in my hand baby

[51:58] Don't ever look back

[52:00] Let the world around us just fall apart

[52:04] Maybe we can make it if we're hard to hard

[52:09] And we can build this thing together

[52:13] Standing strong forever

[52:15] Nothing's gonna stop us now

[52:19] If this world we're gonna love us

[52:22] We'll still have each other

[52:24] Nothing's gonna stop us

[52:26] Nothing's gonna stop us now

[53:28] I'm gonna beat the door

[53:29] Taste it like a raindrop

[53:30] You know it's not

[53:31] She's a girl that's locked in the door

[53:33] She's a raindrop

[53:35] What do you think?

[53:43] You mean love

[53:44] Love is really light

[53:45] You mean love

[53:46] Heavenly burn

[53:47] Cause heaven's got a number

[53:48] Won't you spin me around?

[53:49] Kissing is a color

[53:50] Loving is a wild dog

[53:51] She's got the look

[53:54] She's got the look

[53:55] She's got the look

[53:56] She's got the look

[53:57] She's got the look

[53:58] What do the world can make

[54:00] A brown-eyed girl turn blue

[54:02] When everything I'll ever do

[54:05] I do it for you

[54:07] And I go la la la la la la

[54:09] She's got the look

[54:11] It's not town, It's not town

[54:14] It's very like another

[54:15] When you're heads down

[54:17] Over your beases, but again

[54:18] It's really, It's really

[54:19] 

[54:19] 

[54:19] 

[54:19]

[54:19] 

[54:19] 

[54:19] 

[54:19] 

[54:19] 

[54:19] Sweet is that you're painted to be looking at the world but looking at the city

[54:23] What do you mean?

[54:24] You see one crowded polluted new thinking town

[54:28] Sweet is that you're a small and sweet summer set up

[54:30] Big is that you're a dead-nosed pig

[54:32] Get tied, you're talking to a tourist who's every move's among the purists

[54:37] I get my kicks above the waistline, such a...

[54:43] One night in fact that makes a heart man humble

[54:47] Not much between despair and ecstasy

[54:51] One night in fact I've been the tough guy's cumbo

[54:55] Can't be too careful with your comfort need

[55:00] I can feel the devil walking next to me

[55:11] Every one of you, every one of you, every one of you, I clap

[55:14] You're DJ from this party, you're DJ from this party

[55:35] Maybe I'll treat you quite as good as I should

[55:43] Maybe I'll love you quite as often as I could

[55:51] Little things I should've said I'm done, I never took your time

[55:58] You were always on my mind, you were always on my mind

[56:05] DJ, DJ, you do, you do this, you do this

[56:09] Tell it to my heart, tell me I'm the only one

[56:13] In the middle of all the stinking air

[56:17] Tell it to my heart, I can feel my body long

[56:21] Every time you call my name

[56:27] Tell it to my heart, tell it from the start

[56:31] Tell it to my heart, tell it from the start

[56:39] Tell it to my heart, never make it stop

[56:45] Take it to the heart

[57:01] DJ, DJ, you do, you do this, you do this, you do this

[57:10] Check this out, check this out, check this out

[57:17] I'll bring my love to you

[57:25] I'll bring my love to you

[57:28] Did you know there's a guy living in our closet?

[57:30] You seen him too?

[57:32] Getting kinda weird around here, you know?

[57:36] Moving forward, choosing all my breath

[57:42] Making love to you was never second best

[57:49] I saw the world rushing all around your face

[57:54] Never really knowing it was always mesh and light

[58:00] I'll stop the world and melt with you

[58:07] You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time

[58:13] There's nothing new and I want to

[58:19] I'll stop the world and melt with you

[58:24] You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time

[58:32] So, so, so, so, so

[58:34] Now you know what we are, now you know what you are

[58:38] You'll never go on like a, and you'll never die

[58:42] But you must feed

[58:55] Sailor to the night, lost in the shadows

[59:02] Sailor to the night, lost in the loneliness

[59:08] Sailor to the night, lost in the shadows

[59:14] No one knows

[59:18] There's a number on the back and pray you never need to call us

[59:25] I'll pray I never need to call you

[59:30] Sure

[59:47] Having a bridge, listen to her howl

[59:53] Met her under tension, making you the taxi girl

[59:59] I went through the gang zone

[01:00:05] Riding through the gang zone

[01:00:17] On the floors of Tokyo, I've done it London, towns of go-go

[01:00:34] I went to record selection and the mirrors reflection

[01:00:37] I'm a dancer, I'm with myself held

[01:00:39] I wonder's no one else inside

[01:00:42] I think the crowd is lonely like

[01:00:45] Well, I've been so long for my love vibration

[01:00:48] And I'm dancing all with myself

[01:00:51] I'm dancing all with myself

[01:00:53] I'm dancing all with myself

[01:00:56] Oh, and we're stopping to boo, we're saying there's nothing to prove

[01:00:59] I'm dancing all with myself

[01:01:02] Love is a

[01:01:18] Love is a

[01:01:23] Love is a fantasy

[01:01:32] Oh, we are strong

[01:01:35] Oh, we are strong

[01:01:37] Oh, we are strong

[01:01:39] Oh, we are strong

[01:01:41] Oh, we are strong

[01:01:43] Oh, we are strong

[01:01:45] No one can tell us where we're at

[01:01:48] Searching our hearts for love

[01:01:54] Both of us knowing

[01:01:57] Love is a fantasy

[01:02:09] You and I, love is a delusion

[01:02:13] My bag of balloons with the money we've got

[01:02:16] Set them free at the break of dawn

[01:02:19] To one by one they were gone

[01:02:22] Back at base, box in the software

[01:02:25] Flash the message, something's out there

[01:02:29] Floating in the summer sky

[01:02:32] 99 red balloons go by

[01:02:36] 99 red balloons floating in the summer sky

[01:02:41] Panic belts, it's red alert

[01:02:43] There's something here from somewhere red

[01:02:46] The 99 decisions tree

[01:02:49] 99 ministers meet

[01:02:51] To worry, worry, super scary

[01:02:54] Car the troops out in a hurry

[01:02:56] This is what we've waited for

[01:02:59] This is advice, this is war

[01:03:01] The president is on the line

[01:03:04] 99 red balloons go by

[01:03:18] Walk like an Egyptian

[01:03:41] All the old paintings on the tomb

[01:03:44] They do the sand and stones, you know

[01:03:46] If they move too quick, oh, hey

[01:03:48] They're falling down like a domino

[01:03:51] All the fun is on men by the night

[01:03:53] They got the money on a bed

[01:03:55] All crocodiles, oh, hey

[01:03:58] They snap their teeth on your cigarette

[01:04:00] Falling tight to the hooker, say, hey

[01:04:03] Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh

[01:04:09] Walk like an Egyptian

[01:04:12] You're unbelievable

[01:04:16] Hey, whoa whoa

[01:04:18] Hey, whoa whoa

[01:04:21] Hey, whoa whoa

[01:04:24] Hey, whoa whoa

[01:04:26] Hey, whoa whoa

[01:04:28] You've been me with your questions

[01:04:30] You haven't turned our lives

[01:04:32] You always ask me what it's all about

[01:04:34] I listen to my replies

[01:04:37] You say to me that I'm talking out

[01:04:39] But when I'm too out of the pool

[01:04:41] These times I spent out real life

[01:04:44] Shoot through and leave you

[01:04:46] The things you say

[01:04:48] Your path was just to scare you away

[01:04:50] The things you say

[01:04:54] You're unbelievable

[01:04:58] You're unbelievable

[01:05:07] You're unbelievable

[01:05:14] You're unbelievable

[01:05:30] This is my only profile

[01:05:35] Out of the line, one of the minds

[01:05:39] This is my only profile

[01:05:44] Out of the line, one of the minds

[01:05:48] In my mind, I am dying

[01:05:53] One little boy, one little man

[01:05:57] On the house

[01:06:04] Life, life, life moves pretty fast

[01:06:07] You don't stop and look around once in a while

[01:06:09] You could miss it

[01:06:11] Excuse me, Lieutenant

[01:06:14] Is there something wrong?

[01:06:16] Yes, ma'am, the data on the MIG is inaccurate

[01:06:19] How's that, Lieutenant?

[01:06:22] Well, I just happened to see a MIG-28 do

[01:06:25] We do?

[01:06:26] Sorry, Miss

[01:06:27] We happened to see a MIG-28 do a 4G negative dive

[01:06:32] Where did you see this?

[01:06:35] That's classified

[01:06:36] What?

[01:06:38] It's classified?

[01:06:40] I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you

[01:06:42] Now hear this

[01:06:44] Now hear this

[01:06:46] This should not be a shot

[01:06:48] We should be in the shot

[01:06:50] We'd be in the shot

[01:06:57] Come on

[01:07:01] Come on

[01:07:04] Come on

[01:07:08] Come on

[01:07:11] She was a fast machine

[01:07:13] She cocked the load and the cleans

[01:07:15] She was a fast damn woman

[01:07:17] At her ever since

[01:07:19] She had a cyclist's eyes

[01:07:21] Telling me no lies

[01:07:23] She's knocking me out for those American thoughts

[01:07:26] Taken more than a share

[01:07:28] Had me fighting through her

[01:07:30] She told me to come

[01:07:32] But I was already there

[01:07:34] Cause the world's got chicken

[01:07:36] The earth was quaking

[01:07:38] My mind was aching

[01:07:40] We weren't thinking of you

[01:07:43] Should be on and on

[01:07:49] Yeah, you

[01:07:51] Should be on and on

[01:07:57] Rockin' double time on the seduction run

[01:08:01] She was one of the kinds

[01:08:03] To just remind her of me

[01:08:05] Why no applause

[01:08:07] Adjusting now that it caused

[01:08:09] Me and me a lot of me

[01:08:11] And come back for more

[01:08:13] I had to cool it down to take her

[01:08:15] Now the round, now we're back in the ring

[01:08:18] To take her, now the swing

[01:08:20] That the walls were shaking

[01:08:22] The earth was quaking

[01:08:24] My mind was aching

[01:08:26] We weren't thinking of you

[01:08:29] Should be on and on

[01:08:35] Yeah, you

[01:08:37] Should be on and on

[01:08:41] Rockin' double time on the seduction run

[01:08:44] Should be on and on

[01:08:49] You never said you were me

[01:08:52] Should be on and on

[01:09:00] I got my first real sick string

[01:09:03] Boiled out the fire and died

[01:09:06] Played it till my fingers bled

[01:09:09] Was the summer of 69

[01:09:13] Me and some guys from school

[01:09:16] Had a band and we tried real hard

[01:09:19] Jimmy Quinn, Jody got married

[01:09:23] Should've known we never could fall

[01:09:27] Oh, and I'll look back now

[01:09:30] The summer seemed to last forever

[01:09:33] And if I had the choice

[01:09:36] Yeah, I always want to be there

[01:09:40] Those were the best days of my life

[01:09:48] Back in the summer of 69

[01:09:56] My real care is up

[01:09:59] If I'm young and reckless

[01:10:01] I need it to win

[01:10:03] I guess nothing can last forever

[01:10:07] Forever

[01:10:09] When the night falls down

[01:10:13] I wait for you and to come around

[01:10:16] And the world's alive

[01:10:19] With the sound of kids on the street outside

[01:10:24] When you walk into the room

[01:10:27] You pull me close, I was starting to move

[01:10:31] And I spin it with the stars above

[01:10:34] And you lift me up, you're a world full of love

[01:10:37] Through, baby, through the past world

[01:10:41] Through heaven is the place on earth

[01:10:44] The same heaven that comes first

[01:10:47] Through the heaven of past on earth

[01:10:51] Through heaven is the place on earth

[01:11:03] Won't you take me to a funky town?

[01:11:07] Won't you take me to a funky town?

[01:11:10] Won't you take me to a funky town?

[01:11:14] Won't you take me to a funky town?

[01:11:17] I think we're alone now

[01:11:20] It doesn't seem to be anyone around

[01:11:24] I think we're alone now

[01:11:27] The cheating of hearts is the only sound

[01:11:36] Everybody have fun tonight

[01:11:39] Everybody have fun tonight

[01:11:45] Everybody have fun tonight

[01:11:48] Everybody have fun tonight

[01:11:52] Everybody have fun tonight

[01:11:56] Body works drunk tonight

[01:12:16] I still love you, star, baby

[01:12:19] Open your heart to me, baby

[01:12:23] I hold you like that, you won't love me

[01:12:27] The one thing your heart can't be, got away

[01:12:31] I'll be with you, but I'll be with you, you don't love me

[01:12:53] I want you to know that you're true, you're not to me

[01:13:01] That I wanna be, that I'm not to be, oh, to be

[01:13:09] Trust my broken heart, boy, trust my broken heart for you

[01:13:13] I'm gonna stay this time, trust my broken heart, boy

[01:13:19] I'm never part of you, I want you to be mine

[01:13:25] What have you done for me lately?

[01:19:42] Giving everything inside an alarm

[01:19:46] I know it's strange to be in the dark

[01:19:50] Think of the tender things that we were working on

[01:19:54] Slow change, it put us apart

[01:19:58] When our life gets in any of our baby

[01:20:02] Your blood runs like a movie tonight

[01:20:09] You don't know

[01:20:11] If you don't see the writing on the wall

[01:20:17] As my movements get ahead and you're done

[01:20:24] But maybe sometime if you feel the pain

[01:20:28] You'll find you're all alone

[01:20:30] Everything has changed

[01:20:32] Play the game

[01:20:46] I know what you do

[01:20:48] Fire on the tender, fire on the tender, fire on the tender

[01:20:54] Fire on the tender, fire on the tender, fire on the tender

[01:21:02] Fire on the tender, fire on the tender, fire on the tender

[01:21:08] Sometimes you better off dead

[01:21:10] There's a gun in your hand that's pointing at your head

[01:21:12] You think you're mad, too unstated

[01:21:14] Picking in chairs and knocking down tables in a restaurant

[01:21:17] In a western town, call the police as a madman around

[01:21:20] Running down underground till we die for a western town

[01:21:24] In a western town, a dead end world

[01:21:26] The eastern boys and western girls

[01:21:30] In a western town, a dead end world

[01:21:33] The eastern boys and western girls

[01:21:37] In a western town, call the police as a madman around

[01:21:42] When your body burns and your mind's lame

[01:21:46] And the underwear between the soles of machine

[01:21:50] And that's where I find myself again

[01:21:54] Cutie ladies on the boat that I must travel

[01:21:58] Cutie ladies under the darkness of the night

[01:22:02] Cutie ladies away like gold when we're in the fire

[01:22:06] Cutie ladies along the fire when you're in the fire

[01:22:10] There's a heart for the being, right on my lawn

[01:22:14] Down on my roof

[01:22:16] And it feels like love got the real

[01:22:21] And it's all over me

[01:22:25] There's a heart for the being

[01:22:29] And it feels like love

[01:22:33] There's a heart for the being

[01:22:37] And it feels like love

[01:22:49] And now in the street there's violence

[01:22:52] And now in the dark some work is done

[01:22:57] No problem, I know no washing

[01:23:00] And I can't take all of this stuff

[01:23:03] Oh no, we're gonna run down to electric

[01:23:07] I ran you, I said we'd take it higher

[01:23:13] I can't sit here while I stay in the rain

[01:23:16] Chased my dreams through the polluted air

[01:23:20] Walking on a white running out of time

[01:23:24] There's no room in this old heart of mine

[01:23:28] They'll collect us waiting down below

[01:23:32] Neighbors screaming crack the bedroom wall

[01:23:36] Birds jump off the pavement

[01:23:38] Pass the gates to the streets

[01:23:40] Angers cooking in the safety heat

[01:23:44] So I love how I fight

[01:23:47] Just when the invitation would have been just fine

[01:23:51] They'd know to him again and again

[01:23:55] Felt like this is my heart and he passed

[01:23:59] No one knows how I feel

[01:24:03] What I'm saying lets you breathe between my lines

[01:24:07] One hand walking away from me

[01:24:11] Felt like this is my hand

[01:24:14] Stand back, stand back

[01:24:18] In the middle of my room I did not fear from you

[01:24:23] It's alright, it's alright

[01:24:26] We'll be standing in a line

[01:24:30] We'll be standing in a line

[01:24:33] I'm a cry

[01:24:38] La la la la la la la la la

[01:24:43] La la la la la la la

[01:24:49] I'm still not sure, they way my friends

[01:24:53] It's like a weirdo, I can't bear

[01:24:57] No man called my name

[01:25:01] No man came

[01:25:04] No I walked no doubt away from you

[01:25:09] Baby you're a treasure for all that you can do

[01:25:13] One man sitting on the floor

[01:25:17] He asked me for my love and that was all

[01:25:21] Stand back, stand back

[01:25:24] Buddy you're a young man, hot man shouting in the street

[01:25:28] Gonna take on the world someday

[01:25:30] You got blood on your face, big disgrace

[01:25:33] Waving your banner over the place

[01:25:36] We will, we will rock you

[01:25:41] Sing it out

[01:25:42] We will, we will rock you

[01:25:48] Buddy you're a young man, poor man breathing with your eyes

[01:25:51] Gonna make you some peace someday

[01:25:53] You got mud on your face, big disgrace

[01:25:56] Somebody better put your bag into your place

[01:26:00] We will, we will rock you

[01:26:04] Sing it out

[01:26:05] We will, we will rock you

[01:26:10] Everybody

[01:26:17] We will, we will rock you

[01:26:22] Beaches sick for this one

[01:26:24] Beaches and gentlemen, it's showtime

[01:26:27] Hurry, hurry, step right up

[01:26:30] You wouldn't want to be anyone else in the world right now

[01:26:33] So without further ado

[01:26:40] Can you got a gun?

[01:26:44] Can you got a gun?

[01:26:48] The world's come undone

[01:26:52] Stayin' at the sun

[01:26:56] What did her daddy do?

[01:27:01] What did he or what did he do?

[01:27:04] They said when Jamie was arrested

[01:27:07] They found him underneath the train

[01:27:13] But man he had it coming

[01:27:15] Now that Jamie's got a gun

[01:27:17] She ain't never gonna be the same

[01:27:30] We will, we will rock you

[01:27:54] She's got a smile that it's deep in me

[01:27:57] Reminds me of childhood memories

[01:28:01] Where everything was precious

[01:28:04] Bright blue skies

[01:28:09] Now and then when I see her face

[01:28:12] It takes me away to that special place

[01:28:16] And if I stay too long

[01:28:18] I'll probably break down and cry

[01:28:27] I'll change out of mind

[01:42:01] Where my party people at

[01:42:04] Where my party people at

[01:42:07] When I came into the game, ain't you letting me doubt me?

[01:42:09] Now the whole game's changing it ain't nothin' without me

[01:42:12] Picking up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown

[01:42:15] Only reason you own that song is cause I turned that down

[01:42:17] Went from Hot Wheels to Big Wheels, time dies to Bentley

[01:42:20] At five course meals no more Popeyes and Blemby

[01:42:23] From all right to handsome, from one room to mansion

[01:42:26] From hangin' on the block to throwin' parties in the Hampton

[01:42:28] From smokers to jelts to wrenches to bits to butter

[01:42:31] Plain in a boat and sticks out the whips and no water

[01:42:34] From dice on the curve to sackin' up chips but harder

[01:42:37] From birds on my nerves to chicks on my dick

[01:42:39] Where my party people at

[01:42:42] Where my party people at

[01:42:44] Where my party people at

[01:42:47] Where my party people at

[01:42:50] Where my party people at

[01:42:52] Where my party people at

[01:42:54] Motherfucker, I make power moves with the power of zoos

[01:42:57] A pack of rabbit gorillas that just look at em in zoop

[01:43:00] But not in zoop, will he really be the eater?

[01:43:02] Make food and these suckers fool us, leave food with me

[01:43:04] Better stop them before we got Maluna tick, literally

[01:43:07] But loony been loony, see how the Nata-Luna reclips

[01:43:10] I lose all my shit, catch me on the moon with ya bitch

[01:43:12] I'm fueling my shit, I'm drooling my trip to Jupiter

[01:43:15] Where humans are rooming to be like humans

[01:43:17] I'm using a fireball that I'm shooting out of my palms

[01:43:20] Like bombs, I'm napalmin' a song

[01:43:22] I play big pong with Cusfield up

[01:43:24] Where Anagion is the reason why me and Megatron don't get along

[01:43:27] I'm the evilest whiner, it's ribbon after my stop

[01:43:30] And this pussy lugs in your mug, she more blood than rubata

[01:43:32] The summer bottom was pit, after obvious pic

[01:43:35] When asking who would appear uniform, the obelisk tip

[01:43:38] But I'm ready to get the knowledge

[01:43:40] I'm the evilest whiner, it's ribbon after my stop

[01:43:58] Slime, I'm the evilest whiner, it's ribbon after my stop

[01:44:07] So I set the world on fire, with a brighter than the sun

[01:44:19] Tonight, we are young

[01:44:27] So I set the world on fire, with a brighter than the sun

[01:44:37] Look for me, young B, cruising down the west side

[01:44:41] Highway, doing what we like to do, highway

[01:44:45] Eyes behind shades, this necklace to reason

[01:44:47] All of my days been blonde days, but today, I got my barrel with Skrull with me

[01:44:51] I'm mashing the gas, she's grabbing the wheel, it's trippy, how hard she rides with me

[01:44:55] The new Bobby and Whitney, only time we don't speak is done

[01:44:58] Sex in the city, she gets, Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over

[01:45:01] She's right back to be in my soldier, cause my me's a rider

[01:45:05] And I'm a roller, put us together, how they gonna stop both of us?

[01:45:09] Whatever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder

[01:45:11] When I'm off track, mommy is keeping me focused, so less

[01:45:14] Like this sound like it's supposed to be, the old three, Bonnie and Clyde

[01:45:18] Holdin' B, power

[01:45:20] So I set the world on fire, with a brighter than the sun

[01:45:35] Tonight, we are young

[01:45:46] So I set the world on fire, with a brighter than the sun

[01:46:00] You dudes treat the one that you lovin' with the same respect that you treat the one that you humping

[01:46:04] That ain't bout nothin', if ever you mad about something, it won't be that

[01:46:08] Oh no, it won't be that, I don't be that, places where we coffee at, but no be that

[01:46:13] Oh no, you won't see that, and no, I ain't perfect

[01:46:16] Nobody walkin' in Earth's surfaces, but girlfriend, work with the kid

[01:46:20] I keep you workin' at her main birkin bag, Manolo Blonnie Timbs

[01:46:24] AVA the lands, six hundred drops, her Sadie's bands

[01:46:28] The only time you were a burberry to swim, and I don't have to worry, only worry is him

[01:46:32] She do anything necessary for him, and I do anything necessary for her

[01:46:37] So don't let the necessary occur, yup

[01:46:40] Tonight, we are young

[01:46:48] So I set the world on fire, with a brighter than the sun

[01:46:59] Tonight, we are young

[01:47:08] So I set the world on fire, with a brighter than the sun

[01:47:20] I hope I got your head up, even when the road is hard, never give up

[01:47:25] Baby, don't cry, I hope I got your head up, even when the road is hard, never give up

[01:47:30] Now here's a story about a woman with dreams, her picture perfect at 13 and every knee queen

[01:47:35] Beneath the surface, it was more than just a quick smack

[01:47:38] Nobody knew about her secret, so it took a while

[01:47:40] I can see her tear fall slow down her black tee, settin' quiet tears in the back seat

[01:47:45] So when she asked me, what would you do if it was you

[01:47:48] Couldn't it such a horrible pain to live through?

[01:47:51] I tried to trade places in the tragedy, I couldn't beat your three crazed niggas grabbing me

[01:47:55] For just a moment I was trapped in the pain, no comment taken for niggas violated

[01:48:00] They shake and they break me, even though it wasn't me

[01:48:03] I could feel a grief sticking with your brain flow, that would make the pain go known

[01:48:07] You gotta find a way to survive, cause they win when your soul dies

[01:48:11] Baby, please don't cry, you gotta keep your head up

[01:48:14] Even when the road is hard, never give up, baby don't cry

[01:48:18] You gotta keep your head up

[01:48:32] Get him girl, he ain't gonna never change

[01:48:35] I ain't no hater, but that nigga lost in the gang

[01:48:38] After the bright lights and big thangs

[01:48:40] He probably could love you, but he ain't love with the struggle everyday

[01:48:43] His mind on getting moved, and that was your feelings, it tasted means to show

[01:48:47] Uh-oh, now you got the habits baby, another wild ass nigga that's gonna drive you crazy

[01:48:52] You got too much more living to do, we spend this to you

[01:48:56] Cause you deserve more than what it give to you

[01:48:58] Beautiful black precious, it's complicated

[01:49:00] An unmalignity, a bad piece of fine shit

[01:49:03] Got them all stuck, standing still, when she come through

[01:49:06] Baby take a little more time, love can find you

[01:49:08] And show us the scars, look somebody other than me

[01:49:11] Don't give a lie, we think we live it

[01:49:13] Baby don't cry, you gotta keep your head up

[01:49:15] Even when the road is hard, never give up, baby don't cry

[01:49:19] You gotta keep your head up

[01:49:35] I'm trying to do all that I can from junk

[01:49:37] Now you're losing, you was choosing the wrong man

[01:49:39] Delft the wrong hand, you was junking beautiful

[01:49:41] Lost and turned out, but you let the nigga do to you

[01:49:44] I knew a single elementary, she blew a Kiss to me

[01:49:47] Rolled me in Logan Frey on one to get with me

[01:49:49] We was kids, now she got three kids

[01:49:51] They see they father, they ain't they now know we is

[01:49:54] Seen them last night, homie roller E-Class

[01:49:57] Matty's in a sad, silly death, he dead

[01:49:59] I bring up, Pamper the fool, just to stop through

[01:50:02] But those, ain't my fees, nothing really I can do

[01:50:04] I feel pity for you, you ain't even this wife

[01:50:07] 17 with three kids, locked down for life

[01:50:09] City told me, she bought the OG from the pressure

[01:50:12] Hell nah, I won't let her

[01:50:14] Please don't cry, you gotta keep your head up

[01:50:16] Even when the road is hard, never give up, baby don't cry

[01:50:20] You gotta keep your head up

[01:50:22] Even when the road is hard, never give up, baby don't cry

[01:51:06] But hey, what daddy always tell you,

[01:51:10] Straighten up, little soldier.

[01:51:13] Stiffen up that upper lip.

[01:51:15] It's your friend, Bob.

[01:51:17] You got me.

[01:51:19] DJ Mark, come on.

[01:51:36] Let me go this fall.

[01:51:41] When the heat is enough tonight,

[01:51:47] I must let you rest.

[01:51:53] It's enough to make kings and mega-hounds

[01:51:58] to leave the mess there.

[01:52:03] Haley, I know you miss your mom,

[01:52:05] And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone,

[01:52:07] But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had.

[01:52:09] I can see you sad, even when you smile,

[01:52:11] Even when you laugh, I can see it in your eyes.

[01:52:13] Deep inside, you wanna cry, cause you're scared.

[01:52:15] I ain't there.

[01:52:16] Daddy, switch you and your prayers,

[01:52:17] No more crying, wipe them tears.

[01:52:19] Daddy's here, no more nightmares.

[01:52:20] We gon' pull the guzzer through it, we gon' do it.

[01:52:22] Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he?

[01:52:24] Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it.

[01:52:26] Well, we got in this world, when it spins,

[01:52:28] When it swirls, when it quirls, when it twirls.

[01:52:30] Two little beautiful worlds, looking puzzled in the days.

[01:52:32] Haley was confusing you, daddy's always on the move.

[01:52:35] Mama's always on the news, I try to keep you sheltered from it,

[01:52:38] But somehow it seems the harder that I try to do that,

[01:52:40] The more it backfires on me.

[01:52:42] All the things growing up is daddy, daddy had to see.

[01:52:44] Daddy don't want you to see, but juicy, just as much as seeded.

[01:52:47] We did not plan it to be this way, no mother and me,

[01:52:50] But things have got so bad between us, I don't see it.

[01:52:52] It's ever being together ever again,

[01:52:54] Like we used to be when we was teenagers,

[01:52:56] But then of course everything always happens for a reason.

[01:52:59] I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something we have,

[01:53:01] No control over and that's what destiny is.

[01:53:04] But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep.

[01:53:06] Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream.

[01:53:09] When you see my love tonight,

[01:53:15] Is where we are.

[01:53:21] It's love, because why did I wonder,

[01:53:25] When we got this far?

[01:53:31] When you feel the love tonight,

[01:53:37] I must let you rest.

[01:53:43] It's enough to make keys and a bag of hearts,

[01:53:47] To leave the purpose.

[01:53:52] It's funny, I remember back when you and daddy had no money.

[01:53:55] Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck them under the tree,

[01:53:58] Until some of them were from me, because daddy couldn't buy them.

[01:54:01] I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying,

[01:54:04] Because daddy felt like a bum.

[01:54:05] See daddy had a job, but his job was to keep the food on the table,

[01:54:08] Where you and mom at the time.

[01:54:10] Every house that we lived in, either kept getting broken into and robbed.

[01:54:13] A shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar.

[01:54:17] Trying to start a piggy bank for you, so you could go to college.

[01:54:20] Almost had a thousand dollars, till someone broke in and stole it.

[01:54:23] And I know it hurts so bad, it broke your mama's heart.

[01:54:26] And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart.

[01:54:29] Mom and dad was arguing a lot, so mama moved back on the charmers in the flat.

[01:54:33] One bedroom apartment and dad moved back to the other side of 8 M.

[01:54:36] Myla, N'Vara.

[01:54:37] And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Drake.

[01:54:41] He flew you and mama off to see me, but daddy had to work.

[01:54:44] You and mama had to leave me, then you started seeing daddy on the TV.

[01:54:47] And mama didn't like it, and you and Lainey were too young to understand it.

[01:54:51] Papa was a woman stone, mama developed a habit, and it all happened too fast for you.

[01:54:55] The one of us that grabbed it, I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it for a second.

[01:54:59] Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud.

[01:55:02] Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing, looking at your baby pictures.

[01:55:06] It just chits me out to see how much you both abound.

[01:55:08] It's almost like your sister's now.

[01:55:10] Wow, I guess you pretty much are.

[01:55:12] And daddy's still here, Lainey and pumpkin, so you too.

[01:55:15] Daddy's still here, I like the sound of that chair.

[01:55:17] It's got a ring to it, don't it?

[01:55:19] Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment.

[01:55:21] When you feel the love tonight

[01:55:27] Is where we are

[01:55:33] It's love, cause it's the white I had on the road

[01:55:37] Let it pick up this fall

[01:55:43] When you feel the love tonight

[01:55:49] I'm just letting you rest

[01:55:54] It's love, cause it makes kings and magamonds

[01:55:59] Believe in the mercy

[01:56:05] It's love, cause it makes kings and magamonds

[01:56:10] Believe in the mercy

[01:56:14] I'm gonna feel like a moth fight

[01:56:18] I'm gonna feel like a moth

[01:56:21] Straight from the bottle, I will need a glass

[01:56:23] Pretty girl riding shotgun with a flash

[01:56:25] Climb to the bonnie, same old story

[01:56:27] Headed to the west for the fame and the glory

[01:56:29] Look up at the sunshine, chasing the rainbow

[01:56:31] Gotta get away from the same old same old

[01:56:33] I don't need much from my girl in the radio

[01:56:35] Living on a crepe, we ain't no angels

[01:56:37] Pedal to the metal when we're breaking free

[01:56:40] Doing 95, 99, 95, cause it's 95

[01:56:42] And shit ain't for me, I'm earning the swage

[01:56:44] Burning with wage, it's our story

[01:56:46] I'm turning the page, born in America

[01:56:48] The home with the brave, and I wanna feel young

[01:56:50] And I'm thrown in my grave

[01:56:52] So turn it up, cause me and you baby gonna burn it up

[01:56:54] Breaking out of these chains, I gotta make a change

[01:56:56] We're living this American dream, I don't wanna wake up

[01:56:59] Never no regrets, I got a green eyed girl with these old cassettes

[01:57:02] Hip hop to the rock and I'm driving to top

[01:57:04] This is it, like we only got a moment left

[01:57:07] You and I, I wanna feel free

[01:57:12] I wanna feel young

[01:57:15] I wanna feel like I'm on fire

[01:57:19] I wanna feel like I'm alive

[01:57:23] We're gonna feel free

[01:57:27] We're gonna take the room

[01:57:30] We're gonna feel like we're on fire

[01:57:33] Get my finger, beat up with a line

[01:57:37] Nothing but chucks in the black of the jacket

[01:57:39] Levi's jeans and I thought that I'm packing

[01:57:41] We don't need GPS, it'll be beefy

[01:57:43] Fill up the tank and burn it to ashes

[01:57:45] My ladies, American made, tearing up flames

[01:57:47] With a hair and a braid, American honey

[01:57:49] With them blue jeans shorts and a ray pan, pair with them shades

[01:57:52] We're kinda like Jack and Diane, sipping on jacket

[01:57:54] The back of my band, sharing a dream

[01:57:56] She's on a silver screen and I'm rocking the stage with my band

[01:57:59] We're living in the land to the free

[01:58:01] So I'm paunching this clock when it lands on a three-handed mile

[01:58:03] Look up to the fountain to youth, cause I gotta find a man

[01:58:05] And a came here to be

[01:58:07] So we gon' live it up, you and me never gon' give it up

[01:58:10] We gon' laugh till we cry, live till we die

[01:58:12] We're living this American dream, I don't wanna wake up

[01:58:19] We gon' live like we only got a moment left

[01:58:31] I would feel like you're gonna find

[01:58:35] I would feel like you're gonna lie

[01:58:39] And we gon' feel free

[01:58:43] And we gon' take the room

[01:58:46] And we gon' feel like we're gonna find

[01:58:50] We're gonna live like there's no tomorrow

[01:58:53] Die like a desperado, breathe like the air ain't free

[01:58:56] And I don't give a damn what's comin' with me, but no

[01:58:59] I ain't flyin' solo, you, baby you're my yoko

[01:59:02] All I need is my girl and my radio, let's turn it up

[01:59:05] We're gonna live like there's no tomorrow

[01:59:07] Die like a desperado, breathe like the air ain't free

[01:59:11] And I don't give a damn what's comin' with me, but no

[01:59:13] I ain't flyin' solo, you, baby you're my yoko

[01:59:17] All I need is my girl and my radio, let's turn it up

[01:59:30] I would feel like you're gonna find

[01:59:34] I would feel like you're gonna lie

[01:59:38] And we gon' feel free

[01:59:42] And we gon' take the room

[01:59:45] And we gon' feel like we're gonna find

[01:59:49] We gon' feel like we're gonna lie

[01:59:59] You and I

[02:00:03] You and I
