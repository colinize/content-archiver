[00:00] We can't at all, we can't at all!

[00:02] It seems that everything's gone wrong since Canada came along!

[00:06] We can't at all, we can't at all!

[00:09] They're not even a real country anyway!

[00:12] SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT!

[00:16] Welcome, everybody, to episode 616 of Canadian Spinball Podcasts,

[00:21] the only pinball podcast giving somebody a godzilla-elly at MSRP $10,500.

[00:30] It's going to go to someone Saturday morning during my spectacular,

[00:34] we are going to find the biggest godzilla fan,

[00:37] and there are going to be names inside a hat,

[00:39] and Canada is going to pull a name out of a hat at 11am,

[00:43] Eastern Standard Time, at Automated Pinball.

[00:46] I'm going to be there with Mike, and if you are a fan of Godzilla,

[00:50] and you can prove it to me, email me at canadapinballatgmail.com

[00:54] to get your name into the hat.

[00:56] Now here's the pressure.

[00:57] When your name gets pulled, you have five minutes to call automated to claim your game,

[01:02] or we go on to the next name,

[01:04] and you can't sell this game for a year.

[01:06] We're going to check in on you,

[01:08] and we're going to make sure you share pictures of this game,

[01:10] because it better be bolted to the floor,

[01:12] because I don't want no scalpers getting this game.

[01:15] Okay, on this episode, I'm super happy to have Orbiter Albert,

[01:19] the host of the now sort of inhygidious forever pinball nerds podcast.

[01:24] He's a great guy, he's up in Canada,

[01:26] he knows what it's like to pinball podcast and get burnt out,

[01:31] but he's a really good dude.

[01:33] And when I was supposed to go on his show,

[01:35] all of these haters that are supposed to be these chill people that are into pinball

[01:40] were so upset that canada was going to join his show,

[01:43] that they made Albert not want to do the show.

[01:46] And so I'm happy he came on to my show,

[01:49] and for all you haters out there, I want you to listen to this.

[01:52] And this is all it was ever going to be,

[01:55] just two guys talking about pinball having a good time.

[01:59] This is what the hobby is all about.

[02:01] Let me air this for you.

[02:02] We talk about a lot of stuff.

[02:04] Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Orbiter Albert.

[02:07] All right, ladies and gentlemen,

[02:08] this has been like a five years in the making chat I have on this episode of

[02:14] Canada's pinball podcast, a dear friend of Canada's pinball podcast,

[02:18] Orbiter Albert, he was the host of pinball nerds podcast.

[02:21] That's correct, right Albert?

[02:23] Yes, pinball nerds podcast as well as top three with Orbion TPN of course.

[02:27] Awesome. And so Albert, I've been wanting to talk to you,

[02:30] and we've been saying for a while, let's just come on the show and talk about what's going on

[02:34] in the pinball world. How does that sound?

[02:36] I can't wait. I've listened to every single solitary Canada's pinball podcast show.

[02:41] And to get to come chat with you is just incredibly awesome.

[02:44] It's a it's a rare opportunity for me.

[02:46] So well, thank you. And that's a lot of episodes.

[02:49] So you've listened to all what 615?

[02:52] All 615 when I got into listening to pinball podcasts about what three years ago you were at

[02:59] somewhere around episode 200 and slowly over the years whenever I was doing a road trip or something,

[03:03] I would go back and listen to kind of 10 in a row or so.

[03:06] And I've really I've really seen you grow over the years.

[03:10] And I've said this before I'll say it again.

[03:12] Anyone who says this show has not got a hell of a lot more positive over the last year

[03:17] is wrong. They're just wrong. So thank you for that.

[03:20] From time to time, I'm not going to lie.

[03:22] I would I would turn off your show sometimes a couple years ago.

[03:26] Sometimes it would go down a route that just would get me in a negative space about pinball.

[03:29] And of course, I like to use pinball as kind of a positive mental palette refresh.

[03:35] Because I love pinball so much. I try to stay in a positive space with pinball.

[03:39] But you know, it's hard. You know, you want to be critical and help the the hobby grow,

[03:44] but at the same time try to do, you know, more positive than negative, I guess.

[03:48] Yeah, absolutely. Now it's been a really what do you think has it been

[03:51] a positive year for pinball? Let's talk about Godzilla because I know this is the hot game.

[03:57] Stern just dropped it. And I know you wanted to talk. And I want to talk about

[04:01] the art package on the game first. So we start there because this seems to be the topic of

[04:06] most conversation. Whether or not they got the Godzilla artwork. Correct. What do you think?

[04:11] What's your opinion? Oh, well, I'll be honest. I'm not exactly an art critic per se,

[04:18] but is the marketing manager of my small little T-Cumping Angrile Packa? We work our butts off

[04:23] on getting the best possible Canadian artist on the covers. And I can tell you this,

[04:28] that if you have a product with a good art package, it just sells phenomenally better

[04:33] than a crappy one. And first of all, numbers don't lie, right? We've already heard how well

[04:38] Godzilla is selling and how quickly it's sold out. So therefore the art package can't be horrible.

[04:42] Second of all, I played the old Godzilla and my old league all the time. The art package was

[04:48] incredibly dull, boring, it didn't pop, it didn't stand out. It did everything wrong that Jeremy

[04:54] Packer, Zombie Yeti, killed it on this art package. I love this art package. If someone is saying that

[04:59] it's slightly oversaturated, sure, fine. I hear that. Well, I can tell you right now, if we look

[05:05] at the just over 3,000 pinball machines created, there's no panel of incredible artists on the planet

[05:11] who wouldn't look at the Scudzilla art package and say, it's incredible. None of them would tell you

[05:16] that like Game of Thrones artwork package is more beautiful than this, is more skilled, is more

[05:22] time, more energy. The odd one might look at Jeremy's other artwork, they might look at Ghostbusters

[05:28] or something, or they might look at Avengers or TMNT and go, yeah, I don't like this as much as TMNT.

[05:34] Sure, fine. If you're arguing which one is Jeremy Packer's best art package,

[05:40] maybe it's not Godzilla. I would like to see this in person, you've said this before.

[05:44] Even if it's not his absolute best art package, anyone complaining about this art package,

[05:50] operators are going to love it because it's going to stand out better than the old Godzilla.

[05:53] There's no way the old Godzilla makes more money in arcade. Maybe now, if it's side by side with

[05:58] the new Godzilla, right? I love the package. I think Jeremy killed it. I think if I'm Jeremy

[06:03] and I'm listening to everyone can bitch, moaning, complain, I think you're almost going to say,

[06:08] you know what guys? I don't need to be here. He's such a talented artist. There's so many other

[06:12] places he could go do art packages for where he wouldn't get complaints. Not if he stays in Pimbal,

[06:18] though. I mean, this is what Pimbal does. We're very hyper-critical community. So let me ask you

[06:23] a question though, because it seems like the main complaint, a couple things I've heard, right? It's

[06:27] that the color palette is too similar to the other game. So it's sort of blending in with Avengers,

[06:33] and then it's Godzilla himself, the super bright green, sort of more like a piece of fruit than a

[06:40] lizard. What do you think? I mean, to people who are saying that, do you see it or do you think those

[06:43] people are sort of grasping for something? I think if you take Godzilla and you make him a more

[06:49] dull green and it doesn't match the rest of the art package, it doesn't like why would you have your

[06:55] main character be dull and boring in the background? You know, like this, the same color is the plastic.

[07:00] I would rather the plastic be, you know, the sculpt in the back be the same color, but there is,

[07:05] there is some nitpicking you could do. And like I said, I want to see it up in person first. I don't

[07:10] think it's maybe his best art package. What do you think is best is? Let's stop there. Let me stop

[07:14] you there. What do you think is best is iron made in Ninja Turtles, Avengers, Godzilla, Ghostbusters?

[07:20] Ghostbusters? Ghostbusters or maybe Ninja Turtles? It's interesting, right? Because when you look at

[07:24] Ghostbusters, and this is something I don't think people have really talked about, the color palette

[07:30] in Ghostbusters that Zombie had used is much more inspired by the color palette that he came from

[07:37] over at the world of John Papaduke. I mean, it was very much like the J-Pop oranges and not

[07:42] oranges purples and greens. And that's not like how Ghostbusters color palette would be, right?

[07:49] But because there's not a lot of illustrated Ghostbusters work out in the world, I think it just

[07:56] worked. And it was so beautiful. It was just aesthetically so amazing. So after Ghostbusters,

[08:01] what would you rank as number two? Probably TMNT. My local arcade has Avengers and TMNT

[08:07] sitting right side by side. And of course, on the other side of that's Jurassic Park. And I mean,

[08:11] in comparison to Jurassic Park and comparison to Game of Thrones and comparison to even like

[08:16] Aerosmith. Like I just think this is leaps and bounds ahead. But when you listen to people's

[08:21] complaints, it's like, well, the one piece of the entire artwork is a slightly different color

[08:27] than I would prefer. If that's your biggest complaint, you're just looking for reasons to complain.

[08:32] Right. And that's just what you're just a complainer. You're just that's what you're going to do.

[08:36] And now that we've seen the gameplay, right, it's like this game seems to be, in all the years I've

[08:41] been covering Pimball, this seems to be the best streamed game Stern has ever shown on day one.

[08:47] What were your thoughts when you saw Elwyn showing the world this game?

[08:50] Well, I do have Elwyn cuddled up here on my lap, but of course, that's a different Elwyn. That's

[08:55] my dog here. So if you hear her bark or something, it just means someone's came here to drop off

[09:01] a package or something. But as Elwyn's biggest fan and also a massive Jack Danger fan,

[09:06] I quite often think how could the live stream be better? Because I do agree with you. I love

[09:12] Dwight. I am a fan of Dwight, but I do agree with you. The other live streams where they take the

[09:17] glass off and it goes on for too long. You're losing too many people. It's horrible.

[09:21] Horrible. Horrible. And also like you spoil the very experience of walking up to a machine for

[09:26] the first time. It's almost like we're living vicariously through Keith Elwyn who is also one of

[09:31] the world's best players. And that's the way you want to see it. It'd be like, the way Dwight

[09:35] does it, it would be like if Tiger Woods wants to show you a golf course instead of swinging the ball

[09:40] and showing you like this beautiful course, Dwight would pick up the ball, walk it down the course

[09:46] and put the ball in the hole and be like, this is what happens when you get the ball in the hole.

[09:52] No, I hear you. Also the other thing is too. Lots of times movies nowadays that have two,

[09:57] three different trailers. If it's a movie I know I want to see, I will like in the first 10 seconds,

[10:03] I will say stop. I don't want to see anymore. I just, some movie trailers, they show the best

[10:07] parts in there. I thought the live stream was very well done. There's so many mechs in this

[10:13] that if your biggest complaint is the artwork, it's like I would say there's maybe five artwork

[10:17] packages on the planet possibly even arguably better than this art package. So if your biggest

[10:23] complaint is that the art sucks, then don't buy it. Just enjoy playing the hell out of it in arcade.

[10:27] The art does not suck. It's very, very good. And Jeremy is the greatest artist in Pimball right now.

[10:33] Right now, Pimball with Jeremy Packer, Christopher Franchi and Dane Henry Jr., who did the Guns and

[10:40] Roses art package, which is phenomenal as well. We have got some of the most talented artists in

[10:45] Pimball. And if you look at any game, you know, over the 80s, 90s and early 2000s, it blows all of

[10:51] them away. So Albert, let me ask you about the price because obviously you're right. This game is

[10:56] selling out. People are still looking for LEDs and they're making a thousand. What about the price

[11:01] increase? Because I know you've talked a lot about this on your show and Pimball prices, they're not

[11:06] cheap. They're not cheap anymore. And so what do you think about Stern raising all the prices on the

[11:09] pros, premiums and all these? And do you think this hobby is just getting way too expensive?

[11:15] You know what? I can't even say much about this because you nailed it on the head on one of your

[11:20] earlier shows. If you're someone who owns 10, even five Pimball machines and they're all brand new,

[11:26] like Sterns or JJPs. And so let's say just say your collections worth 25 to 30K and you're

[11:32] complaining because the next machine is 10% more for you or 5% more depending on which model you're

[11:37] getting. Right. Come on. Give me a break. You could sell two of your machines by an L, any LEU

[11:43] you want, maybe short of pirates of the Caribbean. And then now you've got an extra space in your arcade

[11:48] and you've freed up an extra $5,000 cash. When it comes down to it, for someone like me,

[11:53] if my dream theme comes out, like I've never bought a new Mboss Pimball machine. The most

[11:57] expensive machine I've ever bought was Roller Coaster Tycoon at 5K. If I'm going to buy a new

[12:01] Mboss Pimball machine one time in my life, if I'm going to like step out, I'm going to have to

[12:05] sell some other collectibles. I'm going to have to sell a couple of my games. You know, my sandbox

[12:09] of fun collectible money is around 20K. So I've got to either get rid of two or three other

[12:14] less expensive bins or start selling some of my friggin like Michael Jordan rookie guards or something.

[12:20] Like, you know, I like to keep my fun money at that same amount. For me personally, if back to

[12:26] the future comes out in January, I would buy it regardless of if it's $1500 more or not. And in

[12:31] Canada, that's closer to like $2,500 more. Now back when, you know, when I got into Pimball,

[12:35] when you could buy a Stern Pro for $4,900, if they increased the price by $2,000,

[12:42] they would see sales astronomically drop and at that time they couldn't afford to do that.

[12:47] Stern can easily, people don't think about this and they say, oh, Stern would never do that.

[12:52] A year from now, if Stern is caught up on their entire backlog and all the Pimball nerds on the

[12:57] planet are still trying going, I would buy more Pimball machines if only you lowered the price.

[13:02] George Gomez is smart. Gary Stern is smart. They will go, okay, well now we're going to, you know,

[13:06] maybe we're not going to do a price increase for two years or maybe they would say something like,

[13:10] you know, what? Maybe we did go a little bit overboard. This next one coming out, it's got a little

[13:14] bit less in it. We're going to make it $500 less. Stern is smart. We're never going to see a price

[13:18] decrease. I'm not suggesting that would happen. Look at what American Pimball said. They said,

[13:22] hey, if things get back to normal, we will drop that price down again because they are a company that

[13:26] so small with sales so small that that could make a difference between someone buying or not.

[13:32] Let me ask you a question about Jersey Jack because if you're Jersey Jack, clearly their bomb in

[13:37] their game is way higher than a Stern machine and now Stern is priced right at JJP. Do you think

[13:44] JJP is looking at this and seeing these Stern machines sell out on day one, a thousand units of

[13:51] $10,500 Godzilla? Do you think JJP raises its prices on its next game? I almost think they have to.

[13:58] And the reason they have to is because the backlog is too long. The reason when people are now

[14:02] willing to pay the same amount of money as a Stern is specifically because they know they can

[14:06] a, typically get it quicker or b, they just love the theme. I mean, if you just love the theme

[14:11] Mandalorian, you're going to probably get it. But I think it's smart for JJP to raise their prices.

[14:17] I think at the same time that would lower their backlog, I think at the same time it would drastically

[14:22] increase their margins because we know that the bomb, let's say, I don't know what the bomb is,

[14:26] let's say the bomb is $4,000 for an alley like $4,000 US, it's $1,000 more than a Stern alley. I don't

[14:32] know what to say it is. By them increasing the price by even an extra thousand, they're increasing

[14:39] their margins by a huge significant amount, right? So it just makes sense because if you're selling

[14:44] out day one every time, it's just, it's supply versus demand. You're a dumb, you know, you're a bad

[14:49] business person. If you keep selling out every single time that you had a new release, you sold out

[14:54] day one and you never increased your prices, it's stupid. It doesn't make sense. You're leaving

[14:57] meat on the bone. Yeah, the goal in business, especially with a thing like a toy like this,

[15:02] you really want to make one less than the demand. If you're selling out of a thousand LEs on day one,

[15:09] you know, Stern's probably looking at this like, all right, well, we kind of have to figure this

[15:13] out now because yeah, we probably could have made 1500 Godzilla LEs, but I think what Jersey

[15:18] Jackson and probably be looking at, they usually make 500 CEs and they made that of Guns and Roses

[15:24] and we saw that thing sell out day one at 12.5. I predict toy story might be 750 CEs at 15 grand.

[15:33] Because why not? Why would you leave all that money on the table and you know that people will

[15:38] gobbled up immediately? Exactly. For someone who has, you know, an honors degree in market,

[15:44] even from a local community college, the first thing you learn is how to maximize profit per item

[15:50] sold. It's the exact opposite of the McDonald's model where, you know, you just, you make a couple

[15:55] cents per burger, but you sell trillions of them and you make most of the money on the real estate.

[15:59] It's the opposite of that, right? So I think you are right. Now, if they raise the prices to 15,000

[16:04] and they see tons of kick back there and they don't sell out for weeks on end, then maybe they go

[16:09] back to 14,000 or 14,000 or maybe they add in an extra, you know, they already have the free

[16:13] topper. So it already makes sense. If you add in the cost of a stern topper, stern are actually

[16:18] like 500 to a thousand dollars more now. I agree. Like 15K is not even a ceiling. I mean,

[16:23] when I see some of these homes and these game rooms, you go into any great neighborhood where the

[16:28] houses are million dollars or more, right? If anyone on that block is into Pimball, it's nothing to

[16:34] them. It's a drop in the bucket. And now you imagine all across America, 365 million people,

[16:40] and that's just America, right? How do these games go overseas? They go to Australia, they go to Europe,

[16:45] a thousand. All I need to do is find a thousand rich dudes who love Pimball. No, there's like 10,000

[16:50] rich dudes who love Pimball. So the sky's the limit. They haven't even come close to the ceiling.

[16:54] Albert, let's, let's change gears from price to American Pimball. David Fix is coming on the show

[16:59] soon. American Pimball is a company in transition. And all the rumors are indicating that the next game

[17:06] is going to be possibly legends of Vahala, an original IP. Do you think that game can succeed in

[17:12] the marketplace right now with everything that's in the market? Again, it depends on your goals.

[17:17] If stern came out with that, it would sell worse than the black night. If J.J. P came out with that,

[17:22] it would sell worse than dialed in. If American Pimball comes out with legends of Vahala,

[17:27] it will sell worse than Houdini and even beer fest. Like it just, it just blows my mind. Like that,

[17:34] like at least Houdini is something, like growing up I saw, you know, a couple, the old Houdini shows,

[17:40] you know, of him doing magic tricks and escaping and stuff like that. At least, you know, beer fest,

[17:44] I, I like the idea of going to a beer fest. Anyone who says the art package on beer fest is

[17:50] better than Godzilla is confusing to me, but I don't think, are you making fun of October fest

[17:54] by saying beer fest? Are you just think it's beer fest? Well, here, no, no, here's the thing,

[17:58] here's the thing. To me, that game could have been beer fest. Like the movie beer fest from

[18:03] the super trooper guys, it could have been a funny, it could have been like, you have to drink,

[18:06] you get in the multi ball and you have to drink your way out of there. That's what I always wanted

[18:10] October fest to be, right? But to me, October fest is just a generic term for you're going to

[18:14] basically a beer fest in the fall. Like, you know what I mean? It would have been interesting,

[18:18] it would have been interesting, Albert, if they had a camera in that game, like Jersey Jack,

[18:21] Pimball Machines, and it actually can detect when you're drinking. Yeah, and I think that they

[18:27] did add some neat stuff onto it. I mean, it's not a good shooter. That's the thing is like,

[18:31] hot wheels, it's weird because American Pimball keeps getting different things right. Hot wheels

[18:35] is a great shooter, but much like Aerosmith, Aerosmith, the game looks great, but it just sounds like

[18:41] garbage, because I just hate Aerosmith. I also can't get over the air tool sounds. If you say anything

[18:46] to David Fix, just say, frickin' orbital, Albert over there in Canada. He wanted to buy a hot wheels,

[18:51] but those, the air tuning sounds constantly. I was over at a friend of mine's house playing hot wheels

[18:59] a couple weeks ago, and there was like music on the background. There's 15 other pins around,

[19:04] and still, if I was in 10 feet of, I was over playing darts. I wasn't even near the Pimball Machines.

[19:11] Where are you? Where are you? Where are you?

[19:13] F off. Who is in your sound apartment there? It would be better for it to be the very first

[19:18] muted machine and have no sounds in the background. Now, that being said, I still think hot wheels

[19:23] is their best art package, and it's definitely their best shooter. Even though the game plays like an

[19:27] EM, it's very slow, it's very floaty. I don't know what's up with that game. My buddy had it set up

[19:32] like as steep as you can get it, and the game's still just very like, you have time to sip a beer

[19:36] between each shot on hot wheels. Like, you hit the ball and then bounces around, floats over

[19:40] your fur bit. It's just very strange to me. And the crazy part is American Pimball is making the

[19:45] best highest quality pins. As far as we know, thereby far the best pins on the market. Why can't they

[19:51] bring it together and have like an okay art package like Houdini or hot wheels with like, you know,

[19:57] a good shooter and also have snappy flippers because it seems like they're on the right path,

[20:03] but Legend of All Hall, you are sometimes you're on Canada, and I will call you out, Chris,

[20:06] can I, I don't know what you prefer to be called, but you're not wrong. You're not wrong,

[20:10] but Legend of All Hall, they might even sell like a hundred of them, but is that really a success?

[20:15] Yeah, what I think they're going to have to do with that title, right, is they're going to have

[20:18] to manufacture some FOMO and scarcity. So they might have to say we're only making 500, and I think

[20:24] if they do that, they will eventually cross that finish line. But if they say they're making an

[20:29] unlimited amount, that won't work. If they say they're doing a three tiered system of like an

[20:34] Ellie premium pro, that's not going to work. So I think they're going to have to say like

[20:38] on our junior designer games, and it kind of makes sense, right, this is a game that's already

[20:42] been developed. So it's not a lot of cost to them to put it on the line. Let's just say this is

[20:47] going to be a run of 500, and you know, everyone will make some money on, but it's got to be very

[20:52] limited. So we'll see, we'll even see if that's the game. I mean, it hasn't been confirmed.

[20:56] The other thing when people talk about American pinball quality, I'm curious, right, because they

[21:01] don't sell a ton of games, right? This isn't a company that's selling thousands of games. And

[21:06] you know, we see all the issues with Jersey Jack machines. We'll talk about that. Stern sells

[21:11] thousands of each title, and we really don't see many people having a lot of quality issues with

[21:15] Stern. So I would argue probably that Stern is the best quality pinball machine. And if you look

[21:21] at the amount of games they sell, I don't go into Stern threads and see page after page of like

[21:27] issues. We're seeing that more with Jersey Jack. And so hopefully, you know, American pinball can

[21:32] get to that level when they start selling many, many titles. Albert, let's talk about JJP in

[21:37] Mirko, because this has been probably the story that I've covered so many times. I know you're

[21:41] sick of hearing about it. So I want to bring it up. What do you think? What do you think Jersey

[21:45] Jack's way out of this is? Do they continue to work with Mirko? What would you do as a marketer

[21:51] if you're giving them advice? Okay. All the way through college, I worked for Nestle Ice Cream.

[21:55] And I worked on a machine called the Hagen Doss 8 Wide. And my job as the chocolate man was to

[22:00] make sure that the chocolate was within half a degree Celsius or a third of a degree Fahrenheit

[22:05] of the exact same temperature when the ice cream is getting dropped down in the chocolate. If it's too

[22:09] hot, too much chocolate drips off, if it's too cold, too much chocolate sticks on it, and then

[22:13] your nutritional information in the back is screwed. And then we, you know, Hagen Doss gets mad at

[22:17] Nestle and they lose their biggest contract. So my job was just to, you know, do that. It's pretty

[22:22] easy job. But then the quality control person's job once an hour is to come get 10 bars and it's

[22:26] very boring, but they cut the burn half. They measure the chocolate. If one of my 10 bars was off,

[22:31] they didn't say boo. If more than two was off, they said, Hey, you got to like work. You know,

[22:36] go, you got to test a couple more and you got to really nail this dial us in. If more than three was

[22:39] off, they closed down the line. And it was costing the line $5,000 an hour to close down that line.

[22:46] So my whole thing is we don't know the exact numbers. It's what you're saying. If we knew,

[22:52] it's seemingly we know Jersey Jack sells less pins than Stern. And we hear about more issues.

[22:57] But think about it. More of Stern's machines go to bars and locations and location buyers. They

[23:04] just don't go over with the fine tooth comb. In fact, the pinball bar that I grew up going to all

[23:08] the time, the guy knew how to like move an unstuck ball. But that was about it. He didn't look over all

[23:13] the machines, you know, when one was brought in and say, Oh, is there a tiny bit of pooling here or

[23:16] something? So I think Jersey Jack owners are more likely to look over the machines with a fine

[23:21] tooth comb. You're more likely to hear about it. And until recently, because you paid so much

[23:26] fricking more for these things, of course, people are going to care more about it. Now that being said,

[23:30] my issue with you talking about it was not that not that I didn't love listening to you talk,

[23:34] because I'm not going to like Chris. There's three men in my life that have entertained me the most.

[23:39] Number one is Jerry Seinfeld. Number two is Steve Carell in the office, of course, Michael

[23:46] Scott's character. And you're probably number three because I've, you know, you've entertained me

[23:50] for hundreds and hundreds of hours. But I've only turned off maybe half a dozen shows. And they were

[23:55] the shows where, for you said, Okay, and I'm not going to talk about it anymore. Then the next show,

[23:59] you were like, I got another bit. And then the next show, you. And for me, it was like, I like you

[24:03] complaining about it. I like you bitch moaning complaining because when that happens, obviously more

[24:07] people talk about it. And there's a better chance Mirko fixes the BS they're doing. However, when I

[24:13] don't know statistically, the numbers as a numbers guy, if, if, if one in a thousand JJP machines

[24:18] are having play field issues, who cares? That's probably better than Stern's numbers. It's,

[24:23] it's definitely better than, you know, American Pimbles numbers. But if it's like one in ten or coming

[24:28] out with serious issues, then we need to talk about it. But because we can't have an honest conversation

[24:32] about how many of each level was sold, now we don't know what percentage of them have issues.

[24:37] Now it's hard to say if it's a good quality product or not, right? Well, I would argue that

[24:42] unlike a bar of ice cream, one machine deteriorating. And we've seen the photos. I mean, the photos

[24:50] don't lie. It's too many at $12,500. And it's not just one, right? It's a lot. And yes, we don't

[24:55] know the exact numbers. There was supposed to be a, this week in Pimble, a story about this in

[25:00] which Jeff was trying to get some more data. It's impossible. It's impossible to really know.

[25:05] What we do know is that three games in a row, there have been significant play field issues with

[25:11] these Jersey Jack machines. And so let me get back to the question. What would you do if you were them?

[25:16] What you do is you look at the product coming in before you put it into the machine. It's too

[25:22] late to have quality assurance go through a play field after they've done all that work. It's just too

[25:26] late. I think they arrive in perfect condition. Like it's obviously the, the impact of the ball on

[25:32] the posts is what's causing it. So I think these games are leaving the factory looking perfect.

[25:38] And then over time, they're falling apart. So do you think they should figure out a way to sort of

[25:46] do more quality control testing and figure that part out? Do you think they should just stop the

[25:51] line until they actually know the problem? Because they really have it. Obviously you can't stop the

[25:57] line because it's going to cost a lot of money. But they either need to switch who's doing it or

[26:02] obviously Miracle needs to step it up. You know what I mean? But again, I don't know. I don't know how

[26:07] to fix those issues. I don't. I never worked. I worked in a soap factory and an ice cream factory. But

[26:11] I never worked in a pimple factory yet. We were talking about backlog and JJP Albert. So what do

[26:18] you think their timeline is to reveal the next game? Because I put out a rumor that it might be

[26:22] sometime soon. It's just a rumor. I'm not sure. But do you think they're going to do something this

[26:28] October? Or we're going to have to wait until 2022 to see the next title from Jersey Jack Pimble?

[26:34] I don't know. You follow that aspect of it a lot more than I do when you're doing your

[26:39] investigative journalism, which no one else seems to do in Pimble Media. So thank you for that.

[26:43] But I don't know. It would be smart for them to at least announce it before Christmas because it

[26:48] seems to be that that's when a lot of people are willing to do fork out a little bit of extra

[26:54] money. But I also think it's smart to not start a new pin until you can actually start shipping

[27:01] within. It doesn't have to be two weeks, but you know, you want to be shipping within. I would say

[27:04] two months. So if they know they can start shipping a machine within two months of Christmas,

[27:10] sure. I don't think they can. Like don't they have guns and roses on the line till next summer?

[27:15] Yeah. They got way more orders and they must have known GNR was going to be huge. But let's say they

[27:21] get five or six thousand orders of that game. You know, they can't make games like Stern. So that is a

[27:27] backlog of pretty much two years for them. Speaking of backlog and waiting for new titles. Let's talk

[27:34] about Chicago gaming company, cactus Canyon remake, the worst kept secret in Pimble. What are your

[27:40] thoughts on cactus Canyon remake? Do you think they've waited too long? Do you think it's a day one

[27:45] sell out? What do you think? Well, I actually think that cactus Canyon has a hell of a better chance

[27:49] than legends of Val Fela. Like honestly, like just really just because first of all, cactus

[27:55] Canyon has years and years and years of nostalgia built up and following. And if you're a tournament

[28:01] player like me, you've seen this. Like, you know, from me traveling across tournaments across

[28:05] Canada, the United States, you've seen this. Not that it was a tournament darling, but a lot of

[28:09] collectors love this. You know, they love the story of it, not the code not being finished and then

[28:14] someone else working on the code. It's a fun game to shoot. It has cool mix in it. You know,

[28:19] a franchy help to even clean up the artwork. You know, it's going to be even better. So I think that

[28:24] this could sell. I just think if they like you said before, I think if they had released this

[28:28] like a year ago, you know, or in that big dip there for six months when no pins were released.

[28:33] If they had released a pre Godzilla, they would have sold more. Well, they're definitely going to

[28:37] sell out of the top of the line version. And then, you know, we'll see how much the demand is,

[28:43] uh, for me and again, I say this Albert as someone who's somewhat successful in the world of

[28:49] business, but I look at all of these games hitting at once. And I think for most people out there,

[28:55] if money's not the issue, space will be the issue because if you just bought an Ultraman or a

[29:01] Halloween or a Godzilla or a Mandalorian, you know, you can't find room for six new pins or

[29:07] four new pins a year. And for a lot of us, like we can't afford it, but for many people, even if

[29:12] you can, you got to find room. I think it's going to do well. I think the game is going to be loaded.

[29:16] I think it's going to look spectacular. And I think we should see it by Expo. That's that's my

[29:22] feeling on this game. Let's talk about spooky pimp on next. Have you played Halloween or Ultraman yet?

[29:28] No, I'm not even entirely sure there's any in Canada yet. I mean, I would absolutely love to.

[29:33] I'm hoping too soon, but have you followed sort of what's been going on in the thread with

[29:38] Halloween in terms of the code in the game, the animations? And are there going to be more assets?

[29:45] Do you think spooky pimp on in the coding department needs to really nail this game? What are your

[29:49] thoughts? Because right now people are locked in, non-refundable deposit. And it's pretty clear

[29:54] that codes got a lot of work to do. And they might not have the ability to put in a lot of the movie

[30:00] clips that I think people would like to see, especially now that spooky games are nine to ten thousand

[30:05] dollars. I hear where you're coming from that. I too would have liked the code to have been

[30:09] further along. And I honestly think if you're Charlie Emory, you're seeing there saying,

[30:13] you know what, next time we release a game, we're going to make sure the codes a little bit

[30:16] further along because I know that they've definitely had some people pull back on their deposits.

[30:21] And well, they just posted yesterday, they've got 15 more movie clips that are coming out on the

[30:25] next huge code release. So first of all, I think there's a chance there. But what you were saying is

[30:29] that it's how they're implemented as sort of the issue. And you know, they're going to work on

[30:33] that stuff. I think they nailed it with Rick and Morty. Maybe they were a little bit overconfident

[30:37] thinking, well, we did a TV show, so it'll be easy to do a movie. But of course, they had way less

[30:42] access with Halloween than they did with Rick and Morty. So I mean, I think that overall

[30:46] spooky is doing really, really, really good. I do agree with you though the codes that one thing

[30:51] that's just got to be stepped up. I mean, you know, they don't have the same people as Stern or even

[30:55] J.J.P. doing code. I think you're right. I think the code's got a ways to go. That's the thing that

[31:00] that's got to work on the most. And the people who are being rude and giving kickback to you for

[31:03] you just giving your honest opinion, they're just hating for the sake of hating. And that's unfortunate

[31:08] that that happens because I actually do believe 99% of the time you do give constructive

[31:13] criticism now in like a not rude manner and that you're you genuinely are wanting the pinball

[31:19] machines to be better so that we can all enjoy playing pinball more often, right? I'm curious why

[31:25] David Van S who did the animations on Alice Cooper, which I love the animations on Alice Cooper,

[31:31] the pinball machine. I'm curious why he's not over there. And I think that spooky pinball has like

[31:37] the most sort of enthusiastic fans the way they interact with the community. And I think now with

[31:43] all these games at the price point, I think Chuck just needs to invest and double down on coders

[31:48] and animators. And you got to be at the level, the standard by which the industry is at. And when

[31:54] I'm looking at the animations right now, they're not at the standard. And there's no way around it.

[31:58] And maybe they need to sort of maybe think about redoing some of that work or going in a different

[32:04] direction. But we'll see the game shoots great though, Albert, when you do play this game,

[32:07] they really nailed it in the hardware department. It is a very satisfying game to shoot.

[32:13] And I think if the software can catch up with the hardware, I think these are going to go down

[32:17] as the most enjoyable spooky pins to play because of how well they shoot. And you know, pinball needs

[32:23] to shoot well. Doesn't matter how good the code is if the game is not enjoyable to flip.

[32:28] Oh, you're right. You're right. I guess what my wish is for a lot of people on

[32:33] Pinside. And back when I had a pinball podcast, I don't know, three, four months ago,

[32:37] I used to find myself on Pinside like 15, 20 hours a week. And more times than not, I'd be in a

[32:42] good mood before I went on Pinside. And more times than not, I'd be a little crusty, a little

[32:47] great. I would end up closing my laptop because I would just read something that made me shake my

[32:51] head so hard. I almost got a concussion. You know what I mean? It's like, whoa, I like pinball

[32:57] as a hobby because it adds value to my life. Pinball is a hobby for me, which is supposed to be a

[33:03] relaxing, you know, side part. And when I was into the podcast, the thing is I was spending probably

[33:08] about 30 hours a week. I wouldn't doubt that you spend even more than that, especially leading up

[33:12] to the release of a new pin. When you're spending this amount of time and energy on Pinside because

[33:17] you feel like you want to give all of your listeners the best time and energy, you're also going

[33:22] to gravitate towards, unfortunately, some of the hottest takes and some of the most busy,

[33:28] you know, threads that go to the top. And those threads, like the deep root thread,

[33:32] all often have a lot of, you know, a lot of back and forth, a lot of people either being negative

[33:37] or being rude or trying to posture, letting their ego get in the way. And that's kind of what

[33:42] Pinside has became. And so now I just, I've limited myself to like half an hour here, half an hour

[33:48] there. If I start to get even a little bit annoyed by what people are saying, I just get the hell

[33:53] off there. My whole point with Pinside is people, if they just went to the gym 10% of the amount of

[34:00] time they spend on Pinside, this hobby would be ripped. Like we would be going through the shows

[34:06] and everyone would be in the best shape of their lives. And it's like, it's toilet bowl entertainment.

[34:11] You know, you get on the toilet, you open up Pinside and you see a bunch of people arguing about

[34:16] the same thing they all love. It's kind of a weird dynamic when you think about it. So Albert,

[34:21] as a podcaster, right, do you want to get back on the airwaves one day? Do you miss it? Or do you

[34:25] feel more balanced in your life that you've sort of taken a hiatus from it? Hiatus is the good term.

[34:31] I was, I basically ended the podcast and I was live streaming on Pimble Nerd's podcast, my Twitch

[34:36] channel. The thing is, do I want a podcast again? Not yet. Not really. Will they ever come back

[34:41] with a podcast show? I don't think so. I do plan on doing a very shorter segment where I don't go

[34:47] off topic and talk about my freaking goats all day or whatever. And I want to do a YouTube channel

[34:52] that's like five rad one bad. And I talk about the five rad things that I like about a machine and

[34:57] maybe one that they could have done better on or the five rad things I like about Canadian Pimble

[35:01] podcast. And the one thing, you know, maybe I think you could work on or something, right? But I

[35:04] want them to be short little videos. So if anyone wants to see any of my future content, they can

[35:09] always like Pimble Nerd's podcast on Facebook. But don't assume you'll ever hear from me again,

[35:13] because short of coming on to your show whenever you ask me or possibly going on other Pimble

[35:17] podcast, no, I don't plan. I did dust off the microphone today, but I don't plan on going back

[35:22] to it. I think what I do works out better visually and we're supposed to have high speed internet

[35:26] here by the end of the year. So if I don't have my YouTube channel going within the next month or

[35:30] two, I probably will be back to live stream by the end of the year. But I will never, ever, ever

[35:35] jeopardize my mental health, my physical health, time with my family, time with my friends.

[35:39] It wasn't like my children would get home from school and I go, sorry kids, I, you know, I wouldn't

[35:44] talk to them about their day and just do Pimble, but it was like my whole morning was gone from like

[35:48] 9 a.m. until noon, you know, it's gone. I'm taking my fricking mornings back. Now if I've got the

[35:53] listens you got, if I got two, three, four thousand listens per show and, you know, a little bit of

[35:58] financial backing, I would maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe like more into keeping doing it. But I thought

[36:03] my show would grow to getting four, five hundred listens, but like you even mentioned earlier,

[36:07] I'd go off topic so fricking off and that it turns off the people who are just there for the Pimble.

[36:12] It's, it's always been my advice to everyone who Pimble podcasts is just like get to the point.

[36:17] It's all, it's all people want to talk about is the Pimble speaking of kickbacks. Do you find

[36:22] the Viva Laraza t-shirt the one of 122 on making? Do you find that shirt offensive and would you ever

[36:28] wear that incredible limited edition can a dispimble podcast merch? All right, so I have to be honest

[36:35] here. I am going to go buy one. I'm going to buy one. I don't, I don't necessarily think it's like

[36:41] the coolest art package I've ever seen on a pin and I know it wasn't meant to be that. I'm not buying

[36:46] it because it's limited edition because I don't necessarily think it's going to go up in value.

[36:49] Although it's cool that there only be 120 of us on the planet with them, but I was actually a

[36:54] little bit offended and it takes a lot to offend me when I heard my buddy, I know you guys aren't

[36:59] best buds, but my buddy talking about how it's not cool to have a rousa shirt that is kind of like

[37:05] making people feel bad about what happened to you. First of all, you already said you were going to

[37:10] do this shirt way before we found out how evil Robert was. We all knew Robert was like not a good

[37:15] business person and not ever going to make a decent Pimble machine, but we didn't know how bad it

[37:20] was. He's now the second worst guy in Pimble. Like, short of John Trudeau, one of them was

[37:23] abusing children, the other ones abusing senior citizens. Both are just deplorable and just the scum

[37:28] of the earth. But my thing is, is that you are poking fun at Robert. You're poking fun at him being

[37:35] a jerk. You don't even say anything negative or rude on there. If it's like Steve Bowden was wrong.

[37:39] If your shirts had that, I would never support you because I love Steve Bowden and although I think

[37:43] maybe he showed us out coming earlier and I do think at this point he should maybe say like,

[37:47] hey, I was fricking wrong even though, you know, I think that would be nice. I don't think he has

[37:51] to do that. And I'm sure there's some type of gag order. And Robert Mueller, I think he's got like

[37:55] into their heads and he's almost like he's like, it's like an abusive relationship where like,

[38:00] you know, you don't want to bite the hand that feeds, but you're also afraid he's going to sue you

[38:03] if you say anything. I'm going to buy the shirt A because I want to promote you because you've

[38:07] given me hundreds and probably now thousands of hours of entertainment. B, I want to get the shirt

[38:12] because I think it's funny. It's poking fun at the most boisterous person in Pimble who never

[38:17] was able to complete what they wanted to do. And see, it's going to ruffle some feathers. Some people

[38:22] are going to be like, we could believe you're supporting Canada. And I'm going to be like, yeah,

[38:25] what do you want to say about it? Like if I'm going to show and I'm wearing that and someone

[38:28] gets in my face, I'm going to laugh with them. I'm going to be like, dude, you got bigger issue.

[38:32] Viva LaRaza was always, always. And it was more of a joke at J-Pop and is 11 year in the making

[38:39] ridiculous game called retro atomic zombie adventure land. And Viva LaRaza, I know what the

[38:45] cultural meaning means, but it's long live J-Pop's never ending debacle game, which is Raza. It's

[38:52] a joke and it's not meant to poke fun at the people. I have so many friends who have lost money

[38:57] on this game, many of which are in on the joke and are going to be buying this t-shirt. So what color

[39:02] are you going to get? Black, white or gray. I got to get the black. It looks great. And if I had to

[39:06] choose a number, it would probably be 99 for Mr. Wengerets, either gray one or 23 for Michael Jordan,

[39:11] or of course my favorite current hockey player, Leon Drysidle number 26. So those early numbers

[39:17] are gone, but I will get you number 99. So don't worry about that. We'll do that after the show.

[39:22] Wayne Gratsky's number. Let's talk about Steve Vowden in Deeproot real quick, because I've

[39:26] sort of stopped talking about Deeproot because it's over. Like it's done. Like there's nothing

[39:30] needed to discuss, but I think the only thing left and you were talking about this is for

[39:34] Bowden and Barrio, like why haven't they just been like, look, we also got Hoodwinked by this guy,

[39:41] it's over, but they haven't called it. Why do you think they're still holding on? I don't know.

[39:45] I'll be honest, Steve Bowden and I have never been super close. I did get to hang out with him at

[39:50] the final Pimberg. I did go to the, you know, the dead flip after party with him. And I did message him

[39:55] once last fall and I said, look, is there any way you would come on the show and talk

[39:59] what everything going on? Because I just don't want to deal with Robert anymore. I just, you know,

[40:03] a long time ago I said, Steve Bowden should have been the communications manager. It shouldn't

[40:08] have been Robert going on all those shows. Now that being said, maybe that, you know, it wouldn't

[40:11] have mattered. The machines wouldn't have been made. But if I were Steve, what I would do is I would

[40:15] want to disassociate myself with everything Deeproot as soon as possible to show the other Pimberg

[40:20] companies, like, hey, I'm open for business. I want to work with you guys. I want to help with

[40:25] rules design. I think I did a decent job with Ross even though no one will get to see it. But yeah,

[40:29] I do agree with you. I just, the problem is I don't want to jump to conclusions because

[40:33] who knows? Like, what if Steve Bowden's mom invested her entire life savings in this and

[40:37] Steve Bowden's mom is like, and maybe, like, so maybe it's just so close to him, he can't talk

[40:41] about it. I don't know. I wouldn't put it past Robert Mueller telling all the Pimball people, like,

[40:45] oh, contact your friends and family. We're going to make 5% guaranteed per year. That you can't do

[40:50] that. That doesn't happen. You could have a million dollars in a bank won't give you 5% guaranteed

[40:54] per year. So if I make a Steve Bowden shirt that says just wait, which is what he said, you wouldn't

[41:00] wear that. We won't do it. We won't do it. Steve's like, I wouldn't wear that. I wouldn't

[41:03] support it. And I'd probably call you out on it. These guys all had stars in their eyes. It's a

[41:07] dream job to wake up and be able to work on a Pimball machine. And I understand why he went down

[41:13] to Texas. And it all seemed really good at the beginning. But, you know, I was just talking to a

[41:17] friend of mine yesterday who paid for Raza in full. Like, this is a guy who's out $10,000, I think

[41:23] $200. And he's like, Chris, I was new to the hobby. I didn't really know what I was doing. I

[41:29] couldn't imagine that a game that was out because he saw the Houston show. He's like, the game's

[41:34] there. Like it's going to happen. And I said to him, and I want to, I don't want to name his name.

[41:37] I said, man, I got to tell you right now. If you were to ask anybody when you paid in full for

[41:43] that game in the community, should I do this 99% of people would have said, what are you doing?

[41:49] You're crazy. So I kind of don't even feel bad because all you had to do is ask anybody who

[41:56] knows anything about that story and that company and J-Pop. And they would have told you, stay away.

[42:01] And that's why they got so few orders. Exactly. I mean, you said it before. I'm sure, again,

[42:07] on one of your shows, if J-Pop had somehow co-herst American pinball or CGC or one of these other

[42:13] companies, they're even spooky into making Raza, it would have came out and it would have sold more

[42:18] than a hundred and something. Like, Raza is an, especially for 11 years ago, Raza's a good enough

[42:23] game that it would have sold pretty well, especially if it came out. Like, you said, a decade ago,

[42:28] wow, that's actually got quite a bit to it in decent shots and neat rules. And a couple neat

[42:32] little mechs you don't see that often. Cool. But with the reason Raza didn't sell is because no

[42:38] one trusted deep route. There might be one dude who doesn't listen to pinball podcasts, never been

[42:43] on Pinside and was like, oh, I saw this game at a show and did no research and paid for the game

[42:47] in full. I feel sorry for that dude, I guess a little. But I'm sure 99.9% of the people

[42:52] knew that there was a good chance they didn't get a penny back. I don't know why. It doesn't

[42:56] cost more to just pay a deposit. Why would you not just pay the deposit? Yeah, I think the people that

[43:01] are just kicking themselves are the ones who had a chance to get a refund and they didn't take it.

[43:06] And it's like, oh my god, they got burned like four times. So this is it, right? J-pop's done,

[43:11] right? There's no, there's no returning of J-pop in this hobby. I wouldn't let J-pop design

[43:16] a pinball machine for me on a napkin. I'm serious. Like, yeah, no, I think he's done. I think he's

[43:22] done. I think it's good that you're not talking lots about deep route because there's definitely

[43:25] deep route fatigue. Yeah, when I see a game like Godzilla, right? It's beautiful. It's got all this

[43:30] fun stuff in it. Keith L. Win has got more talent in one finger than J-pop does in his whole body.

[43:37] And I think that the jig is up like people realize the guy is kind of like a hack who stood on

[43:43] the shoulders of Valley William engineer geniuses and took credit for everything. Like, I firmly

[43:48] believe J-pop went to bed at night and he woke up and all those engineers figured out everything we

[43:54] love about his games because look at what he created when he was on his own. It was all stuff that

[44:00] didn't work or stuff that he stole from other people's ideas. Nothing was original, nothing worked,

[44:06] nothing functioned and nothing was that impressive. So we're done with deeper. This might be Albert

[44:11] the last time I ever talk about deep route. Other than yeah, other than what happens in the court

[44:18] of law when Robert Mueller has to walk in and now face the music. Hopefully the law throws the book

[44:23] at him and we never hear from him again too. Who would we miss like Alien Pimball? This Friday,

[44:29] we're going to see the LV version of Alien by the Pimball Brothers. What do you think they're going

[44:34] to make in terms of changes to that special version of the game? I don't know what they're going to

[44:39] change. I do know that part of the reason why I ended my show. It wasn't originally it was because

[44:45] I was going to have you on and I was getting a lot of kickback from people. I remember the morning I

[44:49] was supposed to have you on. I had like seven people arguing with me and chat. Six of them were

[44:53] specifically saying like, why would you have them on sports show? And I said because he's my buddy,

[44:58] he's interesting and frankly doing a Pimball podcast. Like I was at 488 episodes. Like it's boring

[45:04] talking by myself. Me sitting here talking with you is fun. It's exciting. It's you know, you have to

[45:08] go do all the editing now, which I don't envy. I just don't care about the theme. Like when you look

[45:13] at Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, it's stayed relevant because there was new cartoons. There was new

[45:18] shows. Even with hot wheels, it stayed irrelevant. But Alien has not stayed relevant. There's no new

[45:24] video games. There's no talk of a reboot. There's no if there was a reboot past the first three. I don't

[45:28] even care. I liked the movie back then. I watched it once or twice back then. But again, I'm not into

[45:33] horror movies. I'm not giant into like sci-fi stuff like that. So it just did nothing for me.

[45:39] I would say that it's an iconic movie and the two movies people love. I would also say like back

[45:44] to the future. It's like if you say has it stayed relevant, I don't know. Like there's not a lot of

[45:49] like new stuff happening around that franchise. But because it's so iconic, the love of it never

[45:54] goes away, right? For the target audience that loves that theme. So I think they're going to probably

[45:59] powder coat it black, put some beacons on top and call it a day. I hope they change the artwork

[46:04] because I just think it looks really dull and flat. And they should have like tapped Mr.

[46:09] Franci on the shoulder and said, Hey, can you help us out here? Um, Franci's got like three or four

[46:14] games coming out next year. And I know you're a good friends with Mr. Franci. I'm happy to say

[46:19] that him and I are friends again. And I'm happy also to make a correction. Yes. Yes. Let's let's

[46:26] you know, even Hilton and I, Hilton came into my stream on Facebook live on the morning of

[46:30] Godzilla and we had a good back and forth. And I like that. I like that a good game brings everybody

[46:37] back together. But I want to do a correction too because I'm one of my previous shows. I said that

[46:43] Christopher Franci takes older artwork and he enhances it. And I want to make a correction because

[46:48] it's like Chris, I illustrate everything in my artwork. So I want to just say, yes, you do. Yes,

[46:54] we can't wait to see your work on new games. What titles do you think he's working on? Because I

[47:00] want to just throw something out there. I think I know he's working on Eric Minier's next game.

[47:04] And I think it's going to be Matrix or Avatar. But what do you think his efforts are going to fall

[47:09] on to in 2022? Chris has never done a bad art package. So Chris, Christopher Franci is maybe the

[47:15] only person on the planet who could have done a package that might have appeased even more people

[47:20] than zombie Eddie on Godzilla. Like he's the only person who might have been able to do a better

[47:24] package. And I say, might. And I love Franci's art, right? Like Monsters Premium is my favorite art

[47:28] package on the planet. I don't know what he's working on. Whatever it is is going to be awesome.

[47:32] I did want to clear the air quickly because right before I had Franci on my show, I had said,

[47:38] you know, the only thing that we're not going to do on the show is we are not going to talk

[47:41] negatively about anybody. And like the week before he was coming on, you and Chris the pen turn

[47:47] got into it a little bit in a live stream. And I thought maybe a couple of the things you said were

[47:52] you know, a little bit out of out of bounds. And it's not that I don't ever I say dumb stuff all

[47:57] the fricking time, right? But I kind of like the only reason before Franci and I went on air, I said,

[48:01] look, he's been so rude to Chris the pen turn, who's my pen turn for my show, who gets paid nothing,

[48:06] yet does interviews for my show goes out to you saw him dressed up as Willie Wonco and you guys sat

[48:10] together for the twippies, right? So you know how hard he's out there working for my show. He got to

[48:14] go run up there and grab the twippy for my buddy, Mark and city. And he's doing all this stuff to help

[48:19] him. I'm gonna podcast for free. And then you were kind of having beef with him. So I felt obligated

[48:24] to all my listeners and to Chris the pen turn to kind of like, you know, stick up for him. So but

[48:28] anyways, long story short, the biggest regret I have in 500 episodes of Pimbal podcasting was that

[48:34] 10 minute segment where we were rude to. So honestly, if I could have taken it back, that's something

[48:38] I would do because you didn't deserve it. I dish it. I take it. I understand that we were all very

[48:43] like heated and in the moment and and it's fine. My whole approach and since being back and you'll see

[48:48] like, I don't talk about other shows. I don't talk about other personalities. I just want to talk

[48:53] about Pimbal and have a good time. I hear a lot of other people still talking about me, still making

[48:58] fun of me. And that's cool. Like that's other people's agenda. This show is more popular. We do have

[49:03] more fans. We have more support. The more we focus on the machines and we keep the personal attacks out.

[49:08] Nobody wants to hear people screaming and complaining about Pimbal. What they want to hear is a

[49:14] combination of our enthusiasm for it. But they also want us to hold these companies accountable,

[49:19] right? To make products that are reflective of these prices and also have quality at these prices.

[49:26] Albert, who else have we missed? So P3 Multimorphic. Jerry, he's got a licensed theme with Scott Dinesi.

[49:31] I think Scott Dinesi is kind of out of the spooky picture now. What do you think that's going to be?

[49:36] Does Jerry need a licensed theme to get it going? What do you think? I guess my problem is and I hear

[49:41] you say often that it needs a licensed theme and I don't think you're wrong about that. However,

[49:46] have you played a P3? Yeah, I actually enjoyed it at the show. I think the thing with the game is

[49:51] it's always fun when it's connected to other P3s next to each other. I like the simplicity of

[49:56] some of those versus games he has. I really like that. My whole thing is my favorite machines are

[50:01] Keith Ellen machines because he uses the whole play field. He makes shots on the far left and the

[50:05] far right important again. There's just more shots on an Ellen machine, which is why he usually has

[50:10] to have three or four flippers. For me, they're just like everything's happening at the top of the

[50:15] the pinball machine and I don't like that. I like there to be some reason to have to shoot lower.

[50:20] It sounds dumb, but it just doesn't feel like pinball to me. I don't know why. I think you almost have

[50:26] to have three or four pins to have that as one of your pins. If that's your only pin at home,

[50:30] I feel like sometimes you would almost feel like I need to play like fast, stern pinball for it to be

[50:35] pinball. I don't know. I also think for that platform, what I really think it's good at is for

[50:41] kids. I mean, I think when you walk up to that machine and a lot of those games where it's just like,

[50:46] you have to shoot those blocks that pop up and down and they're green or red and it's really simple

[50:51] to understand and it's really inviting for a younger pinball demographic. I think that really

[50:56] is the sweet spot because I would argue that almost every other pin is impossible for casuals or

[51:03] kids to understand what to do in it. And I know that some people are probably screaming at me right

[51:08] now, be like, Chris, my eight year old nose, the whole rule set, the pirates of the Caribbean.

[51:12] That might be so. But I think for the most part, most pinball machines are very, very difficult for

[51:17] someone who just walks up to it to know what to do and to feel some satisfaction in what they're doing

[51:23] in the game. So I think Jerry has something there. We'll see. I'm excited to see his license theme.

[51:27] I want them to do well. I want P3 to do well. I hope they do well. I think you're right. It's really

[51:31] good for kids who are used to like digital technology and large screens on everything. I think P3

[51:36] has a place. I think that they're doing most things right. I can't be too judgmental. But me

[51:42] personally, if I'm in our arcade, I would rather go play an EM from 1950s like Singalong by Ed

[51:48] Crinsky, one of my favorite EM designers, then go over there and play at P3. I'm sorry. Well,

[51:52] Albert, we're at the hour. This has been a pleasure. It's been long overdue. I really thank you for

[51:58] coming on. Hopefully the people, those seven or eight people that were just utterly disgusted by us

[52:02] talking about Pimball. We'll listen to this and understand this is what it's always been about.

[52:07] This is why you love talking about Pimball. It's why I love talking about Pimball. It's why Pimball

[52:12] brings all of us together from different walks of life and demographics. And I think they should give

[52:17] this show a chance because as you know over the past 100 or so episodes, it's just this every episode.

[52:23] There's nothing that would make you be disgusted to hear. Canada talk about Pimball. So thank you

[52:28] for joining. Chris, it's been my pleasure. Before I go, I just want to say I'm really missing Ian

[52:33] from Poor Man's Pimball podcast. I miss so it that dude. If he ever comes back to social media,

[52:39] I would love to have him back. I don't know if he'll ever come back to Pimball media, but I'm

[52:43] missing that dude. And the last thing I want to say is I hope all of your listeners are excited

[52:47] because although my podcast is gone, I'm still following through with the Pimball nerds podcast

[52:52] trading cards. And like you say to every single Pimball product, it needs to be limited edition.

[52:57] Mine are going to be limited to 50 of each card. Probably one of the most limited edition

[53:01] card sets on the planet. And because Ian and Drew are no longer in there, the very first hologram

[53:07] was supposed to be of Ian and Drew that obviously can't happen now. So there might be a spot for

[53:12] Canada or Canada's socks to get a hologram. Who knows? Oh, there you go. We might have some Canada

[53:18] socks end up in the merchandise line coming soon. And that's that. So people look out on Silverball

[53:23] Swag for that people. Well, Albert, thank you. My brother from the North, enjoy your weekend in Canada.

[53:29] And will you be at Expo for people who might want to say hi? I am not allowed to go to Expo. I

[53:33] actually had already paid for a plane flight back to Ontario. And then I was going to drive to Expo,

[53:38] but weren't Canadians. It was announced on the 21st are not. And that's why Canadians are not going

[53:43] to a lot of big tournaments coming up even this weekend because you cannot drive across the border,

[53:48] even if you're double-vaxed, even if you say you're going for business like you just you can't

[53:52] drive across the landlord. You can fly, but then you've got to do all these testing and isolation

[53:56] when you return and crazy stuff. So no, I won't be going. But someday, Chris, you and I are going to

[54:01] hang out. We're going to have a beer together. We're going to play a game of pinball. And if I don't

[54:06] ever see you at a show because I'm sure I will. First time I come to New York City, I'm going to

[54:10] bring my wonderful wife, Drop Target Danielle. We're going to go out for a nice dinner with you and

[54:15] Brenda. Maybe get Killian a sitter for the night. And by the way, my wife thinks that your son is like

[54:20] the cutest baby on the planet. Whenever you're doing the Saturday morning, a spectacular, she always

[54:25] goes, where's Killian? Where's Killian? And I always call her over. So she thinks, you know,

[54:29] my sons are so much older now. They're 12 and 16. So hey, did you know, and aren't as cute as

[54:33] they used to be, right? And I almost forget what it's like to have a baby. But keep doing the

[54:37] Saturday morning spectacular. My only favor is just one of the shows in October. Can you call it

[54:42] the Saturday morning spook,acular? Yeah, we can do that. And for those of you listening to this,

[54:46] because I'm going to upload it today, this Saturday morning at 11 a.m. I'm going to be live at

[54:53] automated pinball. And we're going to pick the winner of that Godzilla Ellie spot. So you can buy

[54:58] it at MSRP, which Albert, I mean, I'm, I even even get that many people. I mean, this thing is

[55:03] in demand. And I want to make sure this goes to a diehard Godzilla fan. And so for those of you

[55:08] saying, can it is a bastard who flips every game for money? Uh, uh, I'm doing the right thing.

[55:13] I'm getting it to a fan. And we're going to do it live on the spectacular, or this Saturday morning.

[55:18] The show starts at 10 a.m. on Facebook. If you haven't been a part of it, I think you should

[55:22] join. And at 11 a.m. we do the drawing. Everyone's name goes in a hat. It's the fairest way to do it.

[55:27] And then they have five minutes to call automated to claim the spot. Or we go to the second person in

[55:32] the hat. Canada, you're a changed man. It's it. Man of the people. Well, Albert, thank you so much.

[55:37] It's been a pleasure. And we will definitely do this again soon and have a great week in my friend.

[55:41] It was great to chat, buddy. I'll talk soon. Awesome.
