[00:00] Now your best river, none of us dare you.

[00:05] Now your best river, none of us dare you.

[00:12] Now your best river, none of us dare you.

[00:15] Now your best river, none of us dare you.

[00:21] All right, we got part two of the Ben Hick interview

[00:26] about to air.

[00:27] And I have to say after after listening to this, I was I was trying to edit it down and I sort of just threw up my arms and I was like,

[00:35] can you know what the hell are you doing having all that red wine talking to Ben Hick late at night.

[00:41] It's clear that I started to get a little tired and when I get tired I start to really talk like an idiot valley girl and just say the word like every fifth word.

[00:49] And you should do a little drinking game with this one.

[00:52] If every time you hear canada say like you should take a shot I guarantee you you will be in the hospital with alcohol poisoning.

[00:58] But you'll get used to it.

[01:00] Please forgive me.

[01:01] I was a little buzzed and it's a good chat.

[01:04] This is where we talk about six different pinball themes that people talk about a lot on the forums and we discuss whether or not we think they'd make good pinball theme.

[01:13] So without further ado, I give you part two of my basement talk with Mr. Ben Hick.

[01:20] Roll the tape canada Ben has comprised the list of themes that you guys out there have said would make great pinball theme.

[01:30] So let's go down it and let's let's discuss whether or not we think these are viable and we make great games.

[01:35] One caveat if you do a a keyword search on pinside you can't concatenate words.

[01:40] So I couldn't search for toy story for instance, which apparently a lot of people want.

[01:45] I don't know why.

[01:48] I think that's one of the most overrated animated series of all times there.

[01:52] I said something this is controversial as you for a change.

[01:55] Yeah, no, I disagree on that but go on to an in-beyond.

[01:59] Okay, all right.

[02:00] So these are the top six.

[02:02] These are just ones I could think of out of my head to search for.

[02:04] But if you have something you want to throw in.

[02:06] Yeah, we'll throw them in.

[02:07] But let's go let's go on your list.

[02:08] Number six.

[02:10] In number six in six place we have dukes of hazard which has two Z's in it.

[02:15] I don't remember that as a five year old.

[02:17] With a hundred and eighteen references.

[02:19] I think someone was making a home brew of it.

[02:22] That was a really popular show in the early eighties.

[02:25] Yeah, so I whatever.

[02:28] So what do you think dukes of hazards?

[02:30] Dukes of hazard?

[02:31] Well, we've got the Confederate flag problem for starters.

[02:34] That's so you're done.

[02:36] Oh, the whole industry is old white men.

[02:39] So that plays well with the pinball by hers.

[02:42] Yeah, but still and also as a theme like what the hell would you do?

[02:46] It's like you what did they do in the show even they just draw it?

[02:49] No, so no, so I wish that all the time when I was a kid but I don't remember anything.

[02:52] They were moon shineers, right?

[02:54] Oh, they were okay.

[02:56] We're in there and they were always like evading boss hog in the law.

[03:00] So I think I was five.

[03:01] I probably thought it was jars of water.

[03:03] I think what would be fun about dukes of hazards is like the whole the whole show always ended up with the generally,

[03:12] which was the car.

[03:13] Yeah, always making like some epic freaking jump to get away from the law.

[03:18] So there's something about like a ramp that goes up in the middle that like you have to jump away from boss hog to maybe the rampant.

[03:29] The ramp can transform like it almost sounds like a cartridge so it can rotate like right up in about his head.

[03:35] It's like, oh, here's this jump.

[03:36] Now you have to make this jump like a good change.

[03:38] And then it'd be like, and when you make the jump it's like, do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do whatever the sound was of their sign.

[03:43] Yeah, you'd have to get like a boss hog sound alike to like say damn, cause dukes of hazard.

[03:49] Obviously was a TV ripoff of smoking the bandit and then he'd be like,

[03:53] like, damn duke boys, be cool if you connect the magnet stop and mid air like the freeze frame like the show had like well,

[04:00] they're pickle of a situation now, aren't they?

[04:03] And then after the commercial break at lands like you could like have the Mac the ball hover.

[04:06] I don't know if anyone would get would get that.

[04:08] Well, you could have Daisy Duke inner Daisy dukes.

[04:12] And then so that would give you the TNA factor.

[04:14] Yeah, I still think it's too old.

[04:18] Yeah, I think it's also like I think it's a really thin storyline that would get old quickly.

[04:25] I can't see their being like, you know, you know what that reminds me fast and the fear is another one people talk about a lot on

[04:31] Pinside and I completely disagree with that as a as a pin thing.

[04:35] Well, well, let me ask you a question.

[04:36] Is that on your list? We're going up this list.

[04:38] No, I didn't put that on my list.

[04:40] All right, so so dukes of hazards.

[04:42] Let's just say, let's just say I'm a scale of one to ten.

[04:46] We'll give our own ratings, Ben. I'll do.

[04:48] Oh, you do Ben's on a scale of one to ten.

[04:50] I think dukes of hazard is like a like a five in terms of potential.

[04:56] Uh, potential.

[04:58] Pintential.

[05:00] I would give it a three.

[05:02] Okay, I just think it's too old.

[05:04] So we don't I agree.

[05:05] If it's never made, I will never care.

[05:08] And I don't think you would either.

[05:10] So I'm going to make a column for Kaneda and Ben Hack.

[05:13] All right.

[05:14] What is that?

[05:16] I like making spreadsheets.

[05:18] Number five was number five in the list.

[05:20] The monsters.

[05:22] Oh, Jesus.

[05:24] This fucking title always comes up.

[05:26] So that was that was, yeah, it was in black and white, right?

[05:30] And then, uh, and then grandpa monster.

[05:33] He he was kind of a thing, right?

[05:35] Like he was kind of beyond the show.

[05:38] And then the father was a Frankenstein rip off,

[05:41] or I'm sorry, universal studios version of Frankenstein rip off.

[05:45] Right. And his son was like the wolf kid.

[05:47] Yeah. And then Yvonne de Carlo was in it, right?

[05:50] Yeah. She was hot the way.

[05:52] Yeah. Yeah. From ten commandments.

[05:54] Yeah. Um, and then that's all I know about it.

[05:58] I mean, right.

[05:59] What I think I storyline in that show.

[06:01] I don't even know.

[06:02] It's it's it was kind of like a low budget Adams family.

[06:05] It was an Adams family rip off.

[06:07] That's what I'm saying.

[06:08] Like I just think this pin would be a re-themed Adams family.

[06:10] I don't even.

[06:11] I I I haven't family was based off of a new movie.

[06:15] So it had like more energy, you know, and it was within the context of the movie.

[06:19] I mean, you can look at something like a TV show.

[06:21] I'm like, oh, we got all this stuff to draw for them.

[06:23] And then you're like, oh, we got all this stuff to draw from.

[06:25] Like, you have to, you know, you have to go through all these episodes.

[06:28] Whereas at least with Adams family, the film.

[06:30] Um, it's like, well, it's a two hour movie.

[06:32] And we bring things from the movie.

[06:34] And it's it's at least contained within that.

[06:36] And actually.

[06:37] It keeps you focused really.

[06:39] And of course, I play the game straight to the vault.

[06:44] I just think the monsters being that like.

[06:48] People are not familiar with episodes of that show.

[06:51] Like it's not like freaking like sign fell door.

[06:54] There's nothing like what would you like.

[06:57] Conjure up in a mode that like, oh, I remember that scene in the monsters.

[07:02] Like what?

[07:03] No, the monsters.

[07:04] The monsters had a Dracula didn't they?

[07:06] Isn't that where that comes from?

[07:08] I mean, I remember the car.

[07:10] I just think the monsters is a theme that like gets kind of.

[07:14] Grouped together with like the a viral kind of like fanboy.

[07:18] But like at the end of the day, nobody.

[07:20] And I mean like almost nobody.

[07:23] Gives a shit about that franchise anymore.

[07:26] Well, um, they don't even played on TV.

[07:28] It's not even on TV anywhere.

[07:30] Right, right.

[07:31] I mean, I mean, we might segue into this particular aspect a little bit later.

[07:35] But um, nostalgia.

[07:38] Nostalgia is always approximately 20 years ago.

[07:42] I think that's why Jurassic World did so well.

[07:44] It's not a good movie.

[07:45] But all the people who were 10 years old when they saw Jurassic World.

[07:49] I was older than that.

[07:50] It's a good movie.

[07:51] What are you talking about?

[07:53] It's like, it's enjoyable.

[07:55] I don't even think the original Jurassic Park was a good movie.

[07:58] Oh my god.

[07:59] I was a shade and 17 year old.

[08:01] Right.

[08:02] 16.

[08:03] No, I honestly don't.

[08:04] Because I had read the book.

[08:05] I was one of those book hipsters when I was in high school.

[08:08] And I'm like, I read the book too.

[08:10] And they left out like someone like the most major parts of the book.

[08:13] I get it.

[08:14] But the, it just, it's like to think about what during Jurassic Park is,

[08:17] why doesn't someone whip out a gun and just shoot these effing things?

[08:20] Okay.

[08:21] I mean, I know they're really expensive.

[08:22] They only had flare guns and it was like Dr. Malcolm and like the kids and like.

[08:27] Or they've got that stupid, the stupid big game hunter.

[08:30] He's a big game hunter.

[08:31] He walks out to fight a rapper.

[08:34] He's like, oh, I'm going to load my gun.

[08:36] Now that I'm out here, this is the great time to load my gun when I'm right in front of the creature.

[08:40] Sorry.

[08:41] I do not care for Jurassic.

[08:42] I don't care.

[08:43] I don't care.

[08:44] Those kind of great theme.

[08:45] Yeah, you're crazy.

[08:46] Like, honestly, you have to look at Jurassic Park.

[08:49] Not about why didn't they just shoot these f**k and die?

[08:52] Well, I do have to, the special effects.

[08:54] Like, people have never seen stuff that great at that error with a movie like that.

[08:59] I will say one of the things I hold against Jurassic World is that we were in Austin for the free scale summer conductor conference last year.

[09:07] Who wasn't there?

[09:10] Who wasn't there?

[09:11] Go on, I'm joking.

[09:12] I go on.

[09:13] That was a great conference.

[09:14] They had, yeah.

[09:15] If any conference I've been to, they had like the best booze and food by far.

[09:20] Okay.

[09:21] You're down there.

[09:22] Right.

[09:23] So I mentioned my camera guy, Max.

[09:24] He's a film buff.

[09:25] And I'm like, Max, we have to go to Alamo Drafthouse because you like movies that were in Austin.

[09:30] Yeah.

[09:31] So he had to, he had to, he woke up at like 6 a.m.

[09:34] And then he got there and then we ate a bunch of ribs because his girlfriend is vegan.

[09:38] So he's like, let's eat ribs a week.

[09:40] No, no, no, no, no.

[09:41] Anyway.

[09:42] But then we went to see Jurassic World because we didn't care what movie it was.

[09:45] We just won.

[09:46] I just said, I'm like, I've been to Alamo Drafthouse for a while.

[09:49] But like, we have to go there.

[09:51] But he fell asleep and like the third act and it's like a bar.

[09:57] So a guy actually came up and said, sir, you can't sleep here because it's technically a bar.

[10:02] So I had to keep Alamo in him though for the third act to keep him awake.

[10:06] Right.

[10:07] And I mean, he was part of, you know, obviously he was really tired, but I'm like, screw this movie.

[10:13] Oh my God.

[10:14] Anyway, these are like lame examples of why you don't like Jurassic World.

[10:18] You're a cameraman, fellas.

[10:19] See, the movie was great.

[10:20] That's a huge, there's a huge fucking fish that like eats the goddamn assistant once you get dropped by a tarot dactyl.

[10:27] It's amazing.

[10:28] Anyway, all right.

[10:29] Let's go down the list because we're side track.

[10:32] So what's number five is monsters.

[10:34] Let's talk about monsters on a pin scale of one to ten.

[10:38] I'm going to give monsters a fucking one because I think anyone who thinks that's a good thing for a pinball machine is a fucking moron.

[10:46] It is like the oldest theme ever by like overweight white dude.

[10:51] Do you think a virus still hot, but what's your score?

[10:54] I'll give it a two because some people actually seem to want it.

[10:58] Okay, so that's still very impressed.

[11:00] I'd rather have a pinball machine based on my toilet ball than the monsters.

[11:04] Okay, so what's number, what's number four on your list?

[11:07] Scooby-Doo.

[11:08] And someone on the inside was like, what do they say?

[11:12] Like Scooby-Doo should be zombie yeti's next game or something.

[11:15] It's people like type things out and they try to will it into bean.

[11:19] And something that seems to work actually like with walking dead.

[11:23] I think that one was willed into bean.

[11:25] Right.

[11:26] So that should be the new John Trudeau zombie yeti.

[11:30] Yeah.

[11:31] I loved, I mean, I watched Scooby-Doo every day of my life when I was a kid.

[11:37] Yeah, I think there is a good sweet spot.

[11:41] It's like it's something that the parents remember that say for their kids.

[11:45] I mean, that's why people go to those smurf movies.

[11:47] It's like, oh, I remember smurfs.

[11:49] Oh, I can take my kid to this.

[11:50] Here is my money.

[11:52] I mean, Scooby-Doo, I mean, our game is just like me and Evil Manus is an unlicensed money python.

[11:58] Our game is an unlicensed Scooby-Doo.

[12:00] I mean, honestly.

[12:02] I don't know.

[12:04] I mean, I think the thing is you'd have to have all custom speech.

[12:10] I don't know who's doing the voices for the newer cartoons.

[12:12] We'd have to get them and you'd have to like ride it and make it kind of meta and make it funny.

[12:16] And then have like, you know, illusions to pot.

[12:19] You'd have to make it so adults can enjoy it as well as kids.

[12:24] And yeah, I've...

[12:26] Let's talk about this.

[12:28] I don't think I don't think I've talked about this.

[12:30] I wouldn't have talked about...

[12:32] I've talked about Scooby-Doo and I was a kid.

[12:33] I like dressed up as Scooby-Doo, the dog, for Halloween once, when I was like six.

[12:37] But I would buy it as a pin.

[12:39] Here's the thing.

[12:40] I think we haven't talked about this yet with the first two themes.

[12:42] But let's talk about what the shot would be on Scooby-Fucking-Doo.

[12:47] Like...

[12:48] Well, you have to solve mysteries.

[12:51] I mean, obviously you have a mystery.

[12:53] Yeah, I know the story.

[12:54] It's always an old guy who pulls off his mask at the end.

[12:57] It's old man withers.

[12:58] And it's like, you know, you've got to get the Scooby-Snacks and you've got to get in the mystery van.

[13:04] You mean Snacks could be a hurry up.

[13:06] But like, I'm just trying to think of like, what would you shoot at?

[13:10] Like, that's the thing.

[13:11] It's like, I think games like a Scooby-Doo pinball machine leaves me confused with what would be the big toy in the game.

[13:20] What would I shoot at?

[13:22] What would be the...

[13:23] I have to get a reward shot.

[13:24] Oh, you'd have to have a bookcase that captures the ball and rotates around.

[13:29] You know, those always seeker benches like that.

[13:32] You'd have to have like some sort of floating ghost that looks like shit, just like in Scooby-Doo.

[13:37] Yeah, but other than that, yeah, I don't know.

[13:41] I guess I haven't really given it much thought.

[13:43] That's the thing.

[13:44] I mean, this will probably come up more as we get further into the top six games, inside Wants.

[13:49] But people will talk about, oh, I want monsters.

[13:52] I want Scooby-Doo.

[13:53] But none of them ever say, okay, here's an idea for a mode or he's an idea for a rule.

[13:58] It's like, they never support them wanting a pin with how it could be a good pin.

[14:02] And, granted, that's not their job.

[14:05] They're not building it, but I would like to see more people's ideas.

[14:09] Like, okay, big trouble in little China.

[14:11] That's a good idea for a pin.

[14:13] What are the rules?

[14:14] What are the modes?

[14:15] And I don't know.

[14:16] No one ever elaborates on that.

[14:17] It's like, I like X.

[14:19] I like Pitball based off X is a good theme.

[14:22] I eventually want to talk about that theme in a little bit.

[14:26] It's actually not on my list.

[14:28] We're going to talk about it later.

[14:29] So, fantastic score.

[14:31] I don't even know what we were saying.

[14:32] Scooby-Doo.

[14:33] What were your things?

[14:34] I'll give it a seven.

[14:36] A seven.

[14:37] Okay, so that's, that's it.

[14:38] I would give it like a six.

[14:40] I love, I love the music.

[14:42] Here's the, I love music.

[14:46] I love the music.

[14:47] I love the art.

[14:48] I think it's got, I think Scooby-Doo would be just a, because here's the thing.

[14:51] I think at the end of the day too, like, too long ago.

[14:53] You have to get like Batman in the Harlem Globetrotters.

[14:56] Yeah, you do want the special modes where Batman comes in and home Globetrotters.

[14:59] Because that's always what made Scooby-Doo fun was when like, you know, Scooby-Doo meets the Jetsons.

[15:04] When I was in Hanna Barbarra collided their universes, it was like, in mind blown as a kid.

[15:08] It's like, how's this even happening?

[15:11] All right, so Scooby-Doo possibility.

[15:13] Okay, so what's number three on your list?

[15:17] Oh, you didn't give Scooby-Doo a score.

[15:19] I gave it a six.

[15:21] A six?

[15:22] Okay.

[15:23] Okay, in number three, we have the Muppets.

[15:26] Oh, fuck.

[15:28] Is this like a Jersey Jack pinball?

[15:30] That's the rumor that he might have it?

[15:33] I have not heard that, although it seems like people want it.

[15:37] Again, again, something I've watched a lot as a kid.

[15:40] And I couldn't care less now.

[15:44] Not could care less.

[15:46] I couldn't care less.

[15:47] I hate when people get that wrong.

[15:49] I think there's a lot of...

[15:51] Has a new show been successful?

[15:53] Was it picked up for another season?

[15:55] No, I don't think so.

[15:57] And I think that, you know, I gotta be honest.

[15:59] Is ABC really that desperate that their idea for a show is to copy the 60th place show on NBC 30 Rock?

[16:07] I mean, I like 30 Rock, but it's not like it's set the ratings world on fire.

[16:12] I love the Muppets.

[16:14] That's what I watch Muppets when I was a kid.

[16:17] Yeah, I watched all those movies.

[16:19] I love the office.

[16:20] I watched 30 Rock, but I have no interest in that show.

[16:22] I just don't give a crap.

[16:24] It's like, oh, a Kermit reference pot.

[16:26] I don't care.

[16:27] Yeah, I think the Muppets, like the resurgence of the recent resurgence of the Muppets has been an abomination to the franchise.

[16:35] And the Muppets was fun when it was like, you know, the great Muppet Caper.

[16:40] I even like, you know, Muppets take Manhattan.

[16:43] Muppets Treasure Island was even like decent.

[16:46] But like, I don't know, they're like Disney overpaid for them.

[16:51] Yeah, and then like it became, I don't know, it just became more about like,

[16:57] like it was like a parody of itself is what the Muppets became.

[17:00] And like, I don't know, like I just, so a pinball, but let's talk about like Muppets is a pinball theme.

[17:05] So like, yeah, you do it.

[17:07] Like so is it, is it based on like the famous movies that people like from like yesterday years?

[17:12] Or is it just like, yeah, that's a question.

[17:14] Collect, collect, collect, deposit the Muppet show or is the Muppet, I mean if you were to get the license,

[17:21] I would think that the license or would want it to be based off the new show.

[17:25] Right.

[17:26] I don't think pinball people would want that.

[17:31] But yeah, but what it was kind of like a, it was like a skit show, right?

[17:35] I mean, I guess you could have those two old guys in the balcony, like commenting on your play.

[17:40] But in that case, why not just make your mystery science theater pin?

[17:43] Yeah, and like the thing is it's like I get like themes that appeal to children

[17:47] But at the end of day if you want to sell pinball machines and you want to attract like young people

[17:52] I'd much rather have a frozen pinball machine than muppets. Oh frozen with just fucking print money

[17:58] It would be insane. It's like it's

[18:02] Yeah without a doubt like I think you know muppets

[18:08] Anything anything 8-bit Nintendo related like a wreck it Ralph game would wreck it

[18:13] But I don't think a company will do that. I just I don't think there's enough

[18:18] Bat shit left field crazy thinking in the pinball industry like

[18:23] Oh like one I think I think they should make like my like bat shit crazy license idea would be Peewee's playhouse

[18:29] Like I don't think anyone would pick that but that was a huge cult hit back in the day

[18:34] And it would have tons of toy potential. That's the thing is like I may be getting this a little later

[18:39] But it's like not necessarily this is the theme you want but what theme?

[18:42] Lens itself to toy potential. I mean we can get it into this my muppets

[18:46] But like like you said we talked about jumping jumping balls like we can jump the ball at the car like what are the shots in muppets?

[18:52] Like is there a permit shots you spell permit or pig or I don't

[18:58] I would actually argue that

[19:00] Peewee's big adventure would be a better pinball machine because that's the narrative in the movie was amazing

[19:07] Okay, anything with he we all I think the whole my

[19:12] Little bit more cuz it shows like it's on one room. It's like

[19:15] It has a chair

[19:18] Mechael and I like to learn to hide me. Yep. Yep. Yep. I get all that but like what's great about the movie though

[19:24] Cuz here's what here's where I think the struggle is

[19:27] With some of these themes that yeah, they're popular themes

[19:30] But the narrative is hard to like make an immersive experience

[19:34] But if Peewee's big adventure which we're all familiar with the movie and him trying to get his bike back

[19:40] I mean that's a very very

[19:43] Easy to understand narrative that I think people could enjoy playing where like you're trying to get Peewee's bike

[19:49] Back to him

[19:52] Could be an eat you know could be a fine. Well, that's that's a good thing about licenses like oh you've seen the movie

[19:57] You know what the goal is I have to destroy the ring I have to

[20:03] Fight the walking dead, you know, it's like you don't have to explain the goals of the player

[20:07] That's a great great advantage of a license. It could be the hobbit and you have no idea what you're supposed to be doing

[20:13] But you know

[20:15] Okay, so like okay, so love it some up. It's on on a scale of one to ten

[20:20] I you know, I I love them up. It's a franchise, but as they think it's a pinball machine. I give them up into three

[20:28] I'll give it a four just because again, I think people would buy it

[20:33] But I just I'm just don't I'm really I'm really

[20:36] Stretched as to what it would actually contain as a game

[20:40] I mean, it's you know, I've had some pretty crazy ideas

[20:43] I guess we could maybe talk about like licenses. We'd like to see after we get through this

[20:46] Yeah, let's do that like what we'll do that

[20:48] So what we have two more alright what's never go here first, but I think it's like what what what can

[20:54] What works good for pinball rules like okay? I will get to that number two is

[20:59] Chaws the movie

[21:04] Which is a great movie, but I don't know how it translates to a pinball machine

[21:11] You have a Jurassic Park you're like oh there's different parts of the park. There are gates

[21:16] There are different breeds of dinosaurs, you know, jaws. There's a beach and one shark

[21:21] There's one enemy like what do you do? Is there a mode where you have to like paint signs and nail them to the beach?

[21:26] Is there a mode where you try to sleep with the the sheriff's wife like in the book of jaws again hashtag book nerd?

[21:34] See I I

[21:36] Tend to think that jaws would be an amazing pinball machine and I'll explain why I think you can have modes where

[21:44] You have to you know hit certain shots to get people off the beach. So I think that's an easy

[21:49] Oh, you can like clear the beach like clear the beach mode

[21:52] I think you have a mode where you like have to get your supplies or get your bigger boat

[21:58] You collect them, but what here's the thing I always saw jaws like the ultimate final wizard mode shot and here's the shot

[22:06] Then you ultimately have to like

[22:09] Get the shark to pop up with the oxygen taking its mouth and you get one shot to hit it

[22:15] Yeah, and that's it. Yeah, then if yeah

[22:19] You son of a bitch. Yeah, you have to like you take the shark that's it and I just think like to have one shot at hitting it

[22:26] Because that's like that's the shot in the movie you can have the music

[22:30] Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

[22:32] Yeah, because you're like oh, I've got to make the shots soon the shark is coming right and that's it and I it can be really cool

[22:39] I just if you had if you had a general purpose shark mech that could

[22:42] Buy an oxygen tank the shark would have to bite the ball if there was a ship that could be sunk like pirates

[22:50] Yeah, okay, well see you you you've talked about mode ideas. That's great. That's more than I usually see

[22:55] You're like okay here is some moza. I mean that's the thing

[22:58] I think it's great that people have pins are excited about but I would love to see just more discussion

[23:03] I'm like okay, how would you make this a good game like what are some modes and you've just enlightened me

[23:07] Oh, I mean I think it'd be a good theme

[23:09] I mean it would sell because people just have a heart on for it. I

[23:14] Again, I personally would not be super interested in it, but I would give it

[23:17] I would give it an eight because people love it. Yeah, I'm pretty old

[23:21] It's older than I am if that's possible

[23:24] Well, I would give jaws in aid as well and I also agree with you though

[23:29] I think it's a theme that has been out of the cultural zeitgeist for such a long time

[23:36] That with and there's not even like a remake on the horizon or anything. I think

[23:42] You know the last time I heard jaws was back to the future day because of jaws 19 or whatever

[23:50] But it's it's something that the old guys want but I don't think I don't think jaws sells in the volume

[24:00] That people think it would jaws is more of a

[24:04] It's kind of like a movie buff niche title

[24:08] I know that's a really weird thing to say about one of the most successful films of all times

[24:12] But it really didn't escape the 70s. I mean obviously Star Wars did

[24:17] But it's kind of a product of its time

[24:19] And this is looking against the movie. I'm just saying how relevant it is to modern audiences or people

[24:26] I agree like I would look I work it in an agency with mostly young people people between the ages of like 22 and like 30 right and I will

[24:34] I will ask people out loud

[24:36] Who's seen like who's seen Star Wars and they have the company hasn't who's seen like no one's seen like

[24:43] Indian at Jones no one's seen Jurassic Park. I mean people forget like the younger people are like completely out of all these themes

[24:53] So and eventually eventually you're gonna have to try to sell machines of those people

[24:59] And I'm maybe they won't buy it, but that's why you know

[25:02] I keep up I keep on bringing up things from the 90s because the 90s is where the hot nostalgia is right now

[25:06] And you see that with a video game like a video game industry or the I'm sorry collecting collectors market

[25:13] Atari used to be really big but once the people who played Atari get older and they've got like their kids college to pay for and they've got their motorcycle to buy it all this stuff

[25:22] They don't give a crap anymore. It's always like what was hot 20 years ago

[25:25] So right now if you're like a 30 year old and you've got your first real job and you make it some good money

[25:30] You're like, oh what made me happy when I was 10? Oh my my super Nintendo or my N64 and you go out and buy that

[25:36] And that's why if you look at the price of like nest or SNES games they go into the roof dressing world is really popular

[25:43] Mighty more from power Rangers movie reboot might be successful somehow and

[25:48] So I think you need to come forward and time a little bit

[25:51] I mean a granted pinballs and you can make a game based off kiss and it's successful

[25:56] But at certain point you need to get a little younger with the themes and make them a little mad on a little edgy

[26:02] I totally agree so okay, so what's number one on the list of white?

[26:07] Haha, themes would make a good pinball probably a surprise to no one but iron maiden

[26:13] Oh, geez really? Oh by a long oh, I have numbers too. Okay, so uh jaws was

[26:19] 1,452

[26:22] mentions iron maiden is 2400 so it's at least a thousand above second place

[26:28] Right, okay, so it was mentioned so much in the you know stern's next music pin is iron maiden or aeros method

[26:36] Hendrix

[26:39] Yeah, yeah

[26:40] Um if I had to guess I I

[26:42] I've heard aerosmith and I would not be surprised if they made that and I don't think it's as bad of an idea as everyone thinks it is

[26:49] Anyway, but iron maiden the only people the only reason people want that is because iron maiden has iconic artwork

[26:55] And people are like oh that will look cool in the game. That's it right

[26:59] I mean nothing against the music, but I mean again

[27:01] I know they're still still touring, but it's kind of old, but again

[27:05] ACDC was super successful. It's just bizarre to think these bands that were formed before I was born and I'm 40 and they're still

[27:13] Playing it's like these people are ancient dinosaurs. It's like why do they do that? I don't want to be up on stage

[27:19] Sweat my balls off on them 70 years old

[27:23] So I'm dead time I'm 70. I in general I don't like music pins at all and I'll explain why because

[27:32] I get you like the band, but like I always feel like

[27:36] There's no storyline with a band that like makes a pimbal narrative that interesting

[27:43] I mean I get like you like unlock the tracks or

[27:47] Or like are trying to like get the band on stage, but it's all stupid like it doesn't have there's like no real story

[27:55] So it's incredibly arbitrary. Yeah, and if you're like

[27:59] Like I don't I don't dislike iron made in music, but I'm not a fan at all

[28:03] So like if an iron maiden pin came out like I wouldn't even

[28:08] flinch I wouldn't even like I wouldn't even like have a moment of like I like I wish I should get this I don't care

[28:16] like and some people are like

[28:19] I would get it right away and I get why like if you love iron maiden

[28:23] Then you want to have an iron maiden pinball like in your game room and or in your like

[28:28] Man cave and that's your favorite band like I totally understand why but I think the musical pins come out now and it's like

[28:37] It's always the same kind of like classic rock sort of you know classic metal bands and

[28:44] You know, it's I don't know I'd rather have

[28:47] I'd honestly rather have a frozen pin out than an iron maiden pin

[28:53] A contemporary Disney musical that

[28:57] Is at least like my girl like my girlfriend would love to play like all off and like the frozen music versus iron maiden like it just

[29:06] And well you would have it would have the laws effects like that game looks game

[29:11] Oh my wife wants it here's my money. I mean it wouldn't matter

[29:15] It wouldn't matter what the theme is if it's a theme that the wife of the girlfriend liked the wall would come out so fast you'd have carpal tunnel

[29:23] And not that not that I would I wouldn't want I don't give a crap about frozen

[29:26] I actually I I like animated movies well at least ones that I enjoy I didn't think frozen was particularly good

[29:34] um

[29:35] Now I'm with standing the fact that it had like all these songs if people find annoying

[29:39] However, there's no denying that it would be a smash effing hit

[29:43] That's a pin are you still there you break up yeah

[29:46] No, I'm sorry. You still really know for my critique of Jurassic Park. I'm like I'm like eating walnuts like so I'm putting my mic on mute

[29:54] Why choose so so here's your soul

[29:58] Okay, so iron maiden I mean like it sounds like after arrow smith

[30:03] Stern will probably do iron maiden it I don't care when arrow smith

[30:07] I don't know that they're making this but I have heard that dirty Donny is still working with them

[30:13] So when arrow smith drops with an LCD and dirty Donny artwork

[30:17] It's just be like metallic that nobody gave a flying fuck about Metallica until they saw it

[30:22] I mean how quickly people forget I don't I don't forget that I remember that and like nope

[30:27] They're like oh they're making it in a talcade and that's so stupid that's so stupid

[30:29] Then we'll say the pictures like oh MZ want and uh I don't know I think they went

[30:34] If

[30:35] Well thing is arrow smith I know people hate when I say this on pins. I'd do it just to rob people up

[30:39] But arrow smith is very mainstream

[30:43] People actually remember them. It's still used in movies um they were

[30:47] More popular longer than most of the other bands that have been made into pins including Metallica

[30:52] I'll just say it they were on the radio longer than Metallica

[30:55] Yeah, Metallica's new stuff sucks

[30:58] But go on yeah

[31:01] Again, I'm not not judging them on the quality of their music. I'm just saying relevance socially

[31:07] um

[31:08] Yeah, I mean they're around and you know, but if they have like funky like 70s like sweet emotion kind of like

[31:13] hippie-dippy like acid trip artwork

[31:16] Um, I think people will go nuts for it and I really could see stern doing that

[31:20] I mean if if stern was making it

[31:22] Arosmith Fimbal machine

[31:24] That would probably the way to go and then it would be perceived as a weaker title

[31:28] So that's probably the one where they'd launch LCD like stern could make a game based off of

[31:33] Herpes with an LCD and then people would buy it because it was the first stern with an LCD

[31:39] Right right and the herpes game never leaves your house

[31:42] All right, so like out of I gotta be honest like out of your list of six band like

[31:48] None of them would make me go buy it

[31:51] So what what themes would

[31:54] Let's just oh I'm gonna give iron we would give iron made into seven

[31:59] How about that? I would give iron made in for me personally a one not a really no a 10 sorry

[32:05] I'm on the wrong side of scale. I there is nothing you could give me

[32:10] Money to buy iron made in Pimbal machine and I would like forcefully give it back to you because I just

[32:15] There is no I just don't care about that band at all to buy a Pimbal machine based on our maiden

[32:21] It's never won or 10 wait, so what's the worst score? I thought ten was the best all right, so then I'll give it a one

[32:28] Okay, I just think the theme for me. This is all this is personal like this is not like I get people might want to buy it

[32:36] I'm just getting tired of music pins and I think that um

[32:40] You know, it just seems to be so like expected to have like one music pin every year from stern

[32:46] That's based on a band that isn't relevant really anymore and I get they sell concerts, but like you know

[32:51] It's like it's kind of lame going to these like high-energy metal shows

[32:54] And this is coming from someone who just want to see guns roses in Vegas and they're reunited and slashes back

[33:00] But you look around the crowd and it's all these like

[33:03] 40 50 year olds

[33:04] It's like past their bedtime and no one's really into it and axel singing like these high energy songs

[33:09] And I'm like this sucks like this is cool like

[33:13] 20 30 years ago when it was like in the heyday, but like I can't get into this anymore and like it's like everyone just living in the past like and I just

[33:22] I don't know. I just kind of find it lame. Well, all right. Everything is about living in the past

[33:26] But yes, yeah, but doesn't have to be though, right? I mean like oh, so our averages your average score was four and mine was

[33:33] 5.1

[33:35] 666667666 the number of the beast iron maiden pin confirm

[33:40] That's it. That's it. Okay, so Ben like let's go back and forth like what theme would you love to see that

[33:47] Isn't on that list if I could get any license to do I would want future ammo

[33:52] That would be my number one pick

[33:55] For pin. It's great great theme. Uh, you go on to the show was about going on deliveries of different planets

[34:02] Obviously they did that because it gave the characters a reason to go to different planets like a fry woke up in the future

[34:07] And the guys like oh your job is

[34:09] You're the garbage man, you know or something like there wouldn't be anything for him to discover

[34:14] But as a delivery boy he is story wise he has the ability to go anywhere in the universe basically

[34:20] So the deliveries are modes boom uh, and you could hire I don't however much it costs every worth a to hire

[34:27] Really west because you'd get 80% of the cast by doing that

[34:31] And Matt groaning is a pinball fan as well, so you'd think that it would probably be a little easier to grease those wheels

[34:38] Plus um future ammo is enjoyed by younger people and it's one of those things where

[34:43] If you're going to demographics, it's usually younger smarter more effluent people too. So equals money

[34:50] Right uh, yeah, that's one if there was a license theme yeah if I get snuff my fingers and get any license

[34:55] That's the one I would want

[34:57] All right, well that one's still like has been done yet. So I think that that that that would be something that people would really appreciate

[35:02] I think it's a little niche, you know, I mean, but it's but to your point

[35:07] I think the niche that

[35:08] follows it

[35:10] um is sort of

[35:12] Would would love to own a pinball machine based on it so my my number one if I could do any

[35:18] I would do a g1 transformers based on the transformers movie the original g1 transformer movie of

[35:25] Oh, yes, I remember it. I think that it's it would lend itself so perfectly to a pinball machine

[35:32] Just just the music a let's start with the music like you got the touch and dare and the standbush like music and

[35:39] And the weird L song dare to be stupid weird owl um and just like

[35:44] The progression of the narrative and a pinball would be great where you start off as optimist and you got to fight mega-tron and you get killed and then

[35:53] And then your ultra magnus and you have to like try and like

[35:57] Open up the matrix and ultimately you become hot rod and you know

[36:02] Dare is playing and you got to you got to get cut to safety and you can have different modes where you have to like

[36:09] You know either like you can either choose good or bad

[36:12] So with the with the backlash sage transformers colon the real movie

[36:17] Yeah

[36:19] It's just really transformers the movie and like and then I think the whole thing like culminates with

[36:24] What's cool about that is like you could pick aught about it or to septicon but no matter which side you picked

[36:30] You had to like align with the other side to beat unicorn in the end and like the all the the final shot is like

[36:37] Unicron's head coming up from like

[36:40] Would that even would that even be obtainable from a licensing standpoint? Yeah, I mean, it's all yeah, it's all has bro

[36:46] I mean they um, I'm actually I thought has bro didn't actually own transformers. They just produced the toys

[36:53] No, that's

[36:57] Because I'm like about that because I'm talking with them right now

[37:01] um for one of the brands I work with and we're licensing

[37:06] Optimus Prime and Transformers and it's all through Hasbro. I mean oh wait

[37:11] Didn't they do like a video game recently that was styled in the way?

[37:15] You know the style original yeah, those were those were awesome those games were fucking credible like it's like war for cybertron and

[37:22] um, but yeah, I mean I think g1 ought g1 transformers. I watched I watched transformers

[37:30] I watched the hell out of it when I was a kid and uh

[37:34] But I don't well first of all I don't care about nostalgia. That's just my own personal

[37:38] The way I feel um, but then I was but you know, oh, I love I love transformers and I wasn't I was a kid

[37:45] But I got put that again. I'm like I want a ghost buster spin that's right. All right. Let's talk about ghost first so like yeah

[37:51] You ordered ghost buster's premium and I like

[37:55] Here's what I'm asking here's what I want to ask you about ghost buster's premium. This is like one of the most relevant topics

[38:00] So like the the magnetic slings which everyone is like prematurely

[38:06] freaking chastising and saying

[38:09] You know, you have a you have a podcast about yeah, cuz like everyone's like

[38:13] There's delay like like it's not coming out because there's having they're having problems with the magnetic slings

[38:19] And it's like no you fucking idiot stern has nine games on the line right now and they're like

[38:27] That like they're gonna come out with the pros and then the premium LEDs

[38:31] And it's like I don't think there's an issue with the slings. I actually love the way the slings operate

[38:37] What what are your thoughts? I mean you've seen the video probably on how they work

[38:40] I haven't actually what are you doing Ben? I get I've been like working and programming and stuff. Yeah, all the importance

[38:48] I have to do an update to Americans most wanted so I can be 10k by Christmas, you know

[38:53] So I got you order it. Oh

[38:56] Ghostbusters um well the art look really good um, you know, I want to you know support. I want to support

[39:04] The idea of doing an old license and putting custom art on it and like taking the extra steps to make that work

[39:10] Although from what I heard Sony was pretty easy to work with on that

[39:14] uh

[39:15] Yeah, it's very iconic

[39:18] Yeah, it's I don't know. I think I was

[39:22] Eight years old and then movie came out and it's kind of like that and Michael Jackson

[39:26] You really had to be alive in that time to realize just how big those things were

[39:30] I mean if you if you think back to 194

[39:32] Beverly Hills cop was actually a bigger hit

[39:35] slightly than Ghostbusters, but nobody cares about it anymore Ghostbusters stuck in the craw of

[39:42] The National Zike guys to use your term from earlier

[39:46] And it's stayed there. I mean, I think that's why you know you have so many people

[39:49] bashing the new Ghostbusters reboot because they're like oh my god

[39:53] You're rebooting our childhood which I think is

[39:56] People's real problem with that movie like if you take if you look at like the Force Awakens

[40:00] and

[40:01] Hans Solo says to

[40:04] Ray he's like the stories

[40:07] They're all real and that's really really masterful writing because Hans Solo is saying your childhood is real

[40:14] That's what he's really saying to the audience

[40:16] You're fantasy or accurate right, but what yeah, but when you remake stuff

[40:20] It's like you're you're replacing people's childhood and as we mentioned earlier

[40:24] It's all about recaption your childhood everything in life is about that whether it's you know watching a transformer

[40:29] It's movie or wanting to see a remake of something you like as a kid or having your own kids and like you know

[40:35] Taking them through life and like oh, I enjoyed this my kid will enjoy this. Oh, it's a circle of life

[40:41] etc etc

[40:43] But yeah Ghostbusters it was

[40:45] It was just a it was a phenomenon and I was a Ghostbuster for three Halloween's in a row

[40:51] I just distinctly remember that it was that big of a deal and the cartoon is really popular as well

[40:56] Maybe too popular because it kind of affected how the second movie was made in the second movie is a pile of garbage by the way

[41:01] I

[41:02] I've tried to like that movie. There's three movies. I would watch every five years trying to like wanting to like they were

[41:09] Ghostbusters 2 blade runner and Batman returns and I've grown to like blade runner like the director's cut

[41:16] It's a lot better Batman returns is horribly shotally made movie

[41:20] Also, I'm also one of those people who was like Tim Burton 89 Batman all the way

[41:24] Screw Christian bail

[41:26] Uh, and then Ghostbusters 2. No, I just can't get into it. It's just very shotally made

[41:32] But ghost but not in that one I'm standing Ghostbusters is definitely like and kind of it was doesn't think they don't make movies like that anymore

[41:40] That's why I hate about the make I'm going hold on up. I'm off of this tangent

[41:43] Um the thing that I really bugs me about movie remakes now and it goes into why Ghostbusters is important because Ghostbusters was a crazy idea

[41:53] It's like let's make a 30 million dollar movie which is a ton of money back then about people hunting ghosts and they start up a small business and all this and

[42:01] They would never make a movie like that now and now everything is about strip mining the past

[42:05] But if the 80s movies and the properties hadn't taken those chances

[42:10] We wouldn't have those things a reboot now

[42:12] I mean we'd be making a reboot of the reboot of the African queen or all about Eve or some other dried up 50s movie

[42:19] It's like there was just such such great creativity at a very high risk level back then and

[42:25] And we kind of missed that and I think that's what was so special about Ghostbusters

[42:28] And it was also a movie that your parents let you watch and then you grow up and you realize just how much like sexual and you end it

[42:33] Was in it and you're like

[42:37] I would say a lot of that but I would say a lot of that creativity now is like

[42:41] Isn't you know TV shows and the the whole medium is changed like

[42:46] You like TV uses saw compared to like movies in terms of creativity and storytelling and now it's like

[42:53] It's it's more like you pick with us where you find good storytelling

[42:58] You know whether it's TV or

[43:00] In the theaters all right, so what made you like so you ordered a you ordered a premium of Ghostbusters

[43:07] Like what like through a distributor like you have an order in like what what's what's what made you a premium and not Ellie

[43:17] Ah, you had the honest answer to that yeah, I don't want to pay a thousand dollars for a plaque

[43:24] Well, no, but but but it's not a plaque on Ghostbusters. It's you get the slimer artwork you get the

[43:29] Yes, different art. I I prefer the ecto one artwork

[43:34] Plus green is a cursed color in pinball. I don't know if you knew that but it's true. Yeah, incredible Hulk

[43:41] Um, remember slimer was barely in the original movie he became popular because of the TV show

[43:48] Yeah, no, I mean it was a character TV show in the movie

[43:52] Well, he was you know, he was the ghost of John Belushi who was supposed to be in Ghostbusters originally

[43:57] Everyone was supposed to be in Ghostbusters, but they weren't like Dan not a any Murphy was supposed to be

[44:04] Winston Winston and John candy was supposed to be Rick Moranis and I guess it's lucky that we got the

[44:11] movie did because that that would not have worked

[44:14] Yeah, you needed Winston the straight man, you know, this job isn't worth 11 five a year

[44:19] Wow, Felicia's a bitch

[44:21] But anyway, the artwork's really good the presentation is really great

[44:25] And I was just like, you know, I keep all my games in my shop, you know, because they get played more at work

[44:32] And I'm like, oh, this is something that I'm sure like my co-worker's will enjoy it. It'll look nice

[44:36] That's another big thing like when we had our merges most haunted green artwork and everyone hated it

[44:41] It's like people were like

[44:43] This needs to look nice in my home people really do care about how a game looks

[44:48] Because it's like this big object taking up space in their home and Ghostbusters looks great

[44:53] And I think Stern definitely is like, hey, we can put hand-drawn artwork and stuff and people will go ape shit for it

[44:58] And so I think we're gonna see a lot more of that going forward from them, which is great

[45:02] Um, yeah, I you know, I probably played Ghostbusters honestly

[45:06] Maybe five times and I sucked at it

[45:09] Granted some of that might but I'm a due to alcohol or all of it

[45:12] But I don't care. I'm sure it'll be a great game. I'm sure the code will be good

[45:15] Also, you know what I really like about Ghostbusters?

[45:17] Is that John Trudeau finally got a great license

[45:21] right

[45:22] uh, I mean

[45:24] Mustangs are really fun game, but it's not a super strong license

[45:28] Obviously WWE is in a strong license

[45:30] I think Stern must have just that license must have fell off the back of the truck

[45:34] I can't imagine that they paid much for it

[45:36] Congo is a great game, but it's a terrible license

[45:39] Also with Ernie Hudson and he did Ghostbusters

[45:42] Illuminati equals confirmed

[45:45] Uh, but I just like the fact that uh, I actually said that I saw John at the bar because I knew I'd run into him at the bar

[45:51] Because you know, I saw him at the bar last year when we talked. He's a really nice guy

[45:55] John Trudeau and I was like, hey John, he's like what? I'm like

[46:00] I just I said this across the bar. How does it feel to finally have a license that doesn't suck any laughed?

[46:08] Um, so you know, that's good that he finally got to have a killer license, you know after

[46:12] Slogging through some stuff and you know, he's one of those designers. He makes games that are different

[46:17] You know, his layouts are always different. They're interesting and I don't I appreciate that so uh, what

[46:23] There's lost even even I'm sorry one more thing the pro had a lot of stuff in it. I was surprised

[46:28] Yeah, it was Pat

[46:29] Yeah, and the premiums gonna have even more so why not it's it's not that and what is it like 6600 or something?

[46:35] I don't know

[46:36] Yeah, so here's what I

[46:38] Here's what I love about Ghostbusters is like I love the fact that there's like magnetic slings and they're trying to just do something different in a

[46:44] Pimmy mission because people always want different and then they like they go and they

[46:49] Wine and complain that it's not exactly the way it used to be because a lot of people are saying like

[46:55] Well, can the magnetic slings behave like regular slings? It's like well, why why would they do that like the whole point is

[47:04] When people jump on Ghostbusters, they're gonna get an experience that is very unique to that pen, right? And I think that's

[47:11] That's sort of what I miss in pinball is like designers

[47:16] Taking risks and doing things that are just completely unlike anything else you've ever experienced in another pen

[47:24] And it's and it does you know magnetic slings don't make sense with most

[47:28] themes right it makes sense to the ghost theme because the ghosts are taking possession over the ball

[47:34] um, I think

[47:36] For me what I've noticed and I'm actually doing a separate podcast in this but the

[47:39] Well slings in general slings are only there to make you lose your ball and take your money, right?

[47:45] You're there their voices, right? So why not do something interesting with them, right?

[47:50] I think who's getting the most but her is are the tournament players

[47:55] Who want to always have the exact same

[47:59] Sort of reaction from the ball with each play as they're as they're competitor

[48:05] Right because if if you have magnetic slings that's doing more randomness with it versus a regular sling

[48:12] They see that as being unfair regardless if it's more fun to watch the magnets

[48:18] Do their thing well, I mean your rubbers could be stiffer or looser or older

[48:24] Your sling mat could be worn out. I mean there's plenty of things I would cause variations in a mechanical sling system or any

[48:31] Mechanical part of a pinball. There's always gonna be variations

[48:34] Right well like I think it's great. I think it's gonna be a fun pin. I think the sales of the

[48:41] L.E.s have shown that like stern has a freaking gargantuan hit on our hands. I think they're gonna make

[48:47] This pinball machine for like five years like I it's gonna be one of those that keep making

[48:53] Like we talked about licenses

[48:56] I honestly don't think a better license can be obtained than Ghostbusters for pinball

[49:02] Right unless someone makes frozen. No that's still wouldn't do it now unless they make Justin Bieber

[49:08] Got a belief got a belief

[49:10] But that's that's for another time all right Ben. Well look. We'll get on
