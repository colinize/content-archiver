---

[00:00] I'm so excited right now.

[00:02] I am ordering this game.

[00:04] I will own this game.

[00:06] I will own this game even if the design is not great, even if the art is not great, even

[00:12] if the layout isn't incredible.

[00:14] I will own this game.

[00:16] And the reason why I will own this game, and like I said, I don't know if it's great

[00:20] or not, but I'm going to own this game on theme alone.

[00:26] This is a movie that I grew up watching with my twin brother probably about 500 times I've

[00:34] seen this movie.

[00:35] I could quote this movie.

[00:37] I could remember every single scene from this movie.

[00:41] And I remember why this movie became so forged in my little sort of brain when I was just

[00:47] maybe around like 10 or 11.

[00:50] And I remember that this movie came out and it was R rated and I wasn't allowed to go see

[00:57] the movie in the theater with my twin brother.

[01:00] My dad took my older brother to go see the movie.

[01:03] And I remember still to this day, we were not allowed to go into the theater.

[01:08] We went to go see another movie and me and my twin brother were waiting outside of this

[01:14] movie's door.

[01:16] And we just listened to what was going on in the film.

[01:20] We were so blown away.

[01:21] And then I remember watching it for the first time and everything about it just left an

[01:26] indelible impression in my little canada mind.

[01:31] And this is why ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to play for you a clip of three minutes

[01:36] of quotes from this movie.

[01:37] And then I'm going to give you more details about this game.

[01:41] And this is why I love doing shows like I did earlier today because once you put something

[01:45] out there, people knock on your door and they give you the rest of the details.

[01:51] This is also why theme is really, really important in pinball and stuff that has nostalgia attached

[01:58] to it has way more, way more appeal for you and I than stuff that's brand new like a John

[02:05] Wick.

[02:06] There's just something about things that you bond it with in a period in your life in which

[02:12] you were innocent and stuff and stuff just hit on a different level.

[02:17] And I mean it like the stuff before the internet, the stuff that you watched over and over and

[02:22] over again.

[02:24] And when we watch these things, we weren't distracted by the internet.

[02:28] We weren't distracted by like dual screening when we watched it for the first time.

[02:33] How many of you out there when you see something now at home for the first time 30 minutes

[02:37] in you're on your phone, you get distracted, you get phone calls like pin size blowing

[02:42] up.

[02:43] People are making videos about Canada on YouTube, right?

[02:45] Everything's always distracting us but nope, these things when they came out, they had

[02:50] our focus, they had our imagination and I am ordering this game and I think you're going

[02:57] to want to order this game too.

[02:59] Hopefully it's good but coming out very soon, I'm going to give you more details is the

[03:04] following.

[03:05] And by the way, if you have any young children, I'm sure there's going to be some curse words

[03:10] in these movie lines so please move them away from Canada Spinball Podcast starting now.

[03:41] Knock, knock.

[03:52] Stick around.

[03:54] Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tech.

[03:58] You're hit, you're bleeding man.

[04:00] I ain't got time to bleed.

[04:02] You got time to duck?

[04:05] But, you're 5th Central American, I'm a goddamn chatterman.

[04:08] From the looks of it, our cabinet minister was CIA.

[04:11] My orders woulda get somebody and who could crack these bastards.

[04:14] So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us into meat grinder.

[04:19] You killed a pig.

[04:21] What the?

[04:23] Do you think you could have found something bigger?

[04:25] Yeah, fuck you, fuck you.

[04:30] Maybe you better put it on a leash agent man.

[04:34] She's your baggage.

[04:35] You fall behind and you are on your own.

[04:39] It changes colors.

[04:41] Like the chameleon.

[04:42] It uses the jungle.

[04:45] You saying that Blaine and Hawkins were killed by a fucking lizard?

[04:49] There's something out there waiting for us.

[04:53] And it ain't no man.

[04:56] Hold it Dutch, I'm going after him.

[04:58] That's an indistile dillan.

[04:59] Guess I picked up some bad habits from you and I'll get your people the hell outta here.

[05:03] You're one ugly motherfucker.

[05:09] I'm here, kill me!

[05:11] Come on, kill me, I'm here!

[05:14] Come on, do it now, kill me!

[05:19] Run!

[05:21] Go!

[05:23] Get to the chopper!

[05:25] C'mon, kill me!

[05:29] Take my money now.

[05:32] Pinball Brothers is coming out with Predator.

[05:36] It is going to be based on the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.

[05:40] They have the assets from the movie.

[05:42] Now, what I don't know is if they're going to get any original call-outs from any of the actors in the movie.

[05:49] I am hoping that means, unlike Alien, that they're actually going to have Arnold in the movie.

[05:55] They're going to sync up his voice with his image and the moments in the film.

[05:59] You really can't make Predator Pinball Machine if you don't have Arnold, right?

[06:03] I mean, this isn't like Alien and Ripley where you can kind of play as Ripley.

[06:07] No, it wouldn't work well at all if you made Predator that way.

[06:11] And also, knowing that the Pinball Brothers just made the Ripley version of Alien,

[06:16] there's no way they're going to make the Arnold-less version of Predator.

[06:21] So, Predator Pinball people, this is a theme that is definitely a Take My Money Now theme.

[06:28] I'm more into Predator than Harry Potter.

[06:31] I'm more into Predator than I am into King Kong.

[06:34] And again, this is why it's so important to drop a theme into the world that makes you feel this excited.

[06:42] And now that we know this game is coming soon, I've got some very exclusive details for you right now.

[06:49] This game is coming out from the Pinball Brothers and what I'm hearing is it's going to be revealed in April.

[06:56] And the reveal date I'm hearing is April 25th, which is a Friday.

[07:02] And I was thinking to myself, oh, that's interesting, a Friday reveal of the game, but it makes total sense.

[07:08] Because a week after that date is going to be the local show that the Pinball Brothers' biggest distributor

[07:17] goes to every year, Pinfest in Allentown, Pennsylvania, which has a huge section dedicated to CoinTaker.

[07:26] And every time the Pinball Brothers goes to a show, where do you see their display in the CoinTaker booth?

[07:33] So April 25th, Predator coming from the Pinball Brothers.

[07:38] I also know the game was designed in-house.

[07:42] Of course, that makes me nervous.

[07:45] I would love this game to be designed by someone of notoriety that we know knows how to make great games,

[07:52] but they are designing this game in-house.

[07:54] I don't know who the artist is on the game.

[07:58] Does it even matter, Canada? Not really.

[08:01] I don't care.

[08:02] I want to play this movie that I love in Pinball format.

[08:06] I'm going to put it in my garage.

[08:08] I hope it's great.

[08:09] If it's not, I don't care.

[08:10] I want to own a Predator Pinball machine.

[08:13] I finally am getting a theme based on a movie that I have a lot of nostalgia for and just makes me giddy.

[08:21] And here's some more details for you.

[08:23] I am also hearing that this game is going to look really nice next to your alien.

[08:30] There's going to be a lot of symmetry there because this game is confirmed to be a wide-body machine.

[08:38] Now, you know me.

[08:39] I'm not like the biggest fan of wide-body,

[08:41] but when you make a wide-body machine, it usually means because you want to put more into the game itself.

[08:47] I think these guys know they need a banger.

[08:50] They need something really good.

[08:51] ABBA did not sell very well.

[08:53] This is such a big theme for them.

[08:55] Now, Predators not as big as Alien.

[08:58] But remember, Alien Pinball was these guys making up for all the mistakes of freaking Andrew Highway.

[09:06] And we know these guys are not making up for the mistakes of Kevin Coolick with this version of Predator.

[09:12] It is going to be an all-new game.

[09:14] There's no baggage associated with this game, and it's based on Predator.

[09:19] I think this game is going to sell really well.

[09:21] I would not want to be barrels of fun right now sitting on a theme that's not as exciting as Predator knowing that this game is coming out in April.

[09:31] I also got a few more news items for you because I get a lot.

[09:34] When I do my shows, Canada is going to come at you people.

[09:37] I also know that CGC Next is medieval madness.

[09:40] We all know that.

[09:41] What we didn't know is what I'm going to tell you right now.

[09:43] They're going to make a lot of them.

[09:45] It's not just going to be a small run of four to five hundred.

[09:48] I think they're going to make more, like, a thousand or more of these games.

[09:51] So if you want a medieval madness and you want it with all the trims and the bells and the whistles, you're going to be able to get one.

[09:57] If you've been holding on to your Royal Edition for $18,000, congratulations.

[10:02] You should have sold it.

[10:03] Your game is now going to be worth 10 when they pump a thousand more of these games into the marketplace.

[10:08] It's going to make all those go down in value.

[10:11] But who cares, right?

[10:12] Everyone's going to get a chance to get a medieval madness.

[10:15] I also heard that Harry Potter is most likely not going to be out until May.

[10:20] So now it gets really interesting.

[10:23] You're going to have barrels of fun, maybe now knowing that Pimball Brothers is coming out April 25th and they've got Predator.

[10:31] What are they going to drop?

[10:33] And is the theme going to be enough to make you not want to wait just a few weeks to see how good Predator is?

[10:40] And then we're going to get Harry Potter and freakin' King Kong on top of each other in May.

[10:47] Absolutely bonkers.

[10:49] Absolutely insane.

[10:50] I love this hobby so much.

[10:52] I love giving you guys these details.

[10:54] If I had to guess, there's going to be two versions of the Predator machine.

[10:58] I don't know how much it's going to cost.

[11:01] But if we look at Alien and we look at what Pimball Brothers charges for its games, albeit they're not the greatest games on the planet,

[11:10] it's still going to be priced very competitively.

[11:13] This isn't a company that's asking you for like 12 to $15,000 for the top of the line version of the game.

[11:21] It's more like $8 to $9,000.

[11:24] So everybody, you heard it here first.

[11:26] The title's been a rumor for a while, but you heard it here first.

[11:30] Predator Widebody Machine based on the Arnold movie with assets from the movie coming out real soon.

[11:38] This makes me so excited.

[11:40] I can't wait.

[11:41] Over a thousand medieval madness is coming back in remake form from CGC in the next couple of months.

[11:47] And then we're going to have Harry Potter and King Kong battling it out.

[11:51] This is such a fun time to be a spectator, but I am telling you right now.

[11:55] My money out of all these titles, I don't care.

[11:58] My money is going to Predator because the theme is something I love that much more than everything coming out.

[12:06] Theme is like 80% of it for me.

[12:09] It really is.

[12:10] And most of the themes have been horrible in Pimball over the last like three to four years.

[12:15] So congratulations.

[12:16] You get Canada's Seal of Endorsement on picking a theme that's perfect for the Pimball buying demographic.

[12:23] We finally get a theme that's for men 40 to 60 and we get an Arnold movie that is still to this day a classic and it kicks ass.

[12:34] Let's end with a more extended scene from that movie that I just love so damn much.

[12:40] Canada out.

[12:41] You sell stuff?

[12:42] So bullshit.

[12:43] All of it.

[12:44] The cabinet minister, the whole business got us in here to do your dirty work.

[12:49] Look, we just stopped a major invasion and three days later been across the border with this stuff.

[12:53] Why us?

[12:54] Because nobody else could have pulled it off.

[12:56] You pissed about the cover story.

[12:58] I knew I couldn't get you in here without it.

[12:59] So what story did you hand to Hopper?

[13:01] Look, we've been looking for this place for months.

[13:04] My men were in that chopper when it got hit.

[13:06] Hopper's orders would have gone and get my men and he disappeared.

[13:09] He didn't disappear.

[13:10] He was skinned alive.

[13:11] And my orders would have get somebody and who could crack these bastards.

[13:14] So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us in a meat grinder.

[13:20] What happened to you Dylan?

[13:23] You used to be somebody I could trust.

[13:26] I woke up.

[13:29] Why don't you?

[13:31] To give an asset.

[13:33] An expendable asset.

[13:36] And I used you to get the job done.

[13:38] Got it?
