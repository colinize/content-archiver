[00:00] Because the dreams bring back all the memories.

[00:02] And the memories bring back memories bring back your...

[00:06] CELESA CELESA CELESA CELESA CELESA

[00:10] Ah, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:13] It is now April, so thank you for joining the club everybody.

[00:17] Let's do this April proper.

[00:19] So look, it has been a March Madness in the world of pinball.

[00:22] March Madness, right?

[00:23] We got so many new games in March in the pinball world.

[00:27] Let's run down the list.

[00:29] Pulp Fiction was revealed.

[00:31] We got the Foo Fighters from Stern Pinball and Jack Danger.

[00:34] We've seen Scooby-Doo, which came out a little bit before March.

[00:37] We've got the Godfather.

[00:39] We've got Galactic Tank Force.

[00:41] We've got Final Resistance.

[00:43] We've also got these James Bond 60th Anniversary Editions.

[00:46] We've got James Bond Regular Edition.

[00:49] There are so many games.

[00:50] I didn't even count Queen Pinball into the mix.

[00:53] I mean, now the question is this.

[00:55] Now that we have all of these new pinball machines,

[00:57] I was thinking about it in the shower this morning.

[01:00] Yes, this is what I do in the shower.

[01:01] I was like, what happens now?

[01:03] Right? It's April.

[01:04] Like we are heading into spring of 2023.

[01:07] And the thing is this, now it's going to be a waiting game.

[01:10] We're going to wait and see how this crazy pinball market

[01:14] is going to settle down a little bit, right?

[01:16] Because what's crazy, if you were to buy all of these games

[01:19] at their top level of trim, you'd be probably writing a check

[01:22] for over $100,000.

[01:24] And the other thing I was thinking about is this.

[01:26] This is now where pinball pricing is going to be

[01:29] for a very long time.

[01:31] So I'm no longer going to moaning groan on each show

[01:33] about pinball pricing, but what I am going to do,

[01:36] because prices are this high,

[01:38] I think we're all going to start looking at these games

[01:41] a little bit differently.

[01:42] I think we're all going to start pausing before we buy a game

[01:46] to make sure it's a game we really, really want.

[01:49] And I think that's a good thing in pinball.

[01:51] I think the days of just buying everything,

[01:53] sight unseen, nonrefundable deposits,

[01:57] I think those days are going to end.

[01:58] And I think they're especially going to end

[02:00] if we're not getting a bunch of triple A themes

[02:04] that would make you buy it sight unseen.

[02:06] And when you look at the lineup of games,

[02:08] what's crazy about all of these games that just came out,

[02:11] there really is only one game that is a triple A theme.

[02:16] There's one theme that just rises above all the other themes.

[02:19] And that theme is pulp fiction.

[02:21] And we're seeing what's going on

[02:23] with the pulp fiction game right now.

[02:24] The Ellie's are sold out.

[02:26] It's going to be really hard to find an Ellie's spot

[02:29] when they do become available.

[02:30] But the real question with pulp fiction is,

[02:32] when are they going to make these games?

[02:34] Is this going to be another cactus canyon scenario

[02:37] where you're going to wait over a year

[02:39] after you gave your deposit

[02:41] and you're not going to see the game anytime soon.

[02:43] But here's the good news about pulp fiction.

[02:44] They took deposits in March of 2023.

[02:48] They didn't take full payment.

[02:50] You gave $1,000 and you're very confident

[02:53] you're going to get your game one day.

[02:55] But when cactus canyon came out,

[02:57] I remember it, it got revealed at Expo in October,

[03:00] like two years ago.

[03:02] And a lot of people paid in full for that game.

[03:04] And a lot of distributors told their customers,

[03:07] the Ellie's are going to be on the line

[03:09] in just a few weeks by the end of the year.

[03:11] And an entire year went by

[03:14] and people still did not see their games.

[03:16] So I don't think you're going to see that

[03:18] with pulp fiction, Ellie.

[03:19] I don't think you're going to see distributors

[03:21] asking you to pay in full

[03:22] until your game is near the line or in a box.

[03:25] But other than pulp fiction,

[03:27] like look at these themes people.

[03:28] We've got Foo Fighters, we've got Scooby Doo,

[03:31] we've got Godfather, Galactic Tank Force,

[03:35] Final Resistance and Queen Pinball.

[03:37] So like most of these themes

[03:39] are not a take my money now theme.

[03:42] And I think a lot of people in the hobby

[03:44] have been listening to Canada

[03:46] and you're waiting and seeing

[03:48] how it's all going to pan out.

[03:50] If you were to ask me how it's all going to pan out,

[03:52] I think what's going to happen is this.

[03:54] I think manufacturing is going to be the big issue.

[03:57] Because if you want one of these new games,

[03:59] the truth is there's really only three companies

[04:02] that are going to have a lot of physical product

[04:04] in the market and that's going to be Stern Pinball,

[04:07] that's going to be Spooky Pinball

[04:10] and that's going to be Jersey Jack Pinball.

[04:12] So if you want a game like a month from now,

[04:14] I think you're going to be most likely looking

[04:16] at Foo Fighters.

[04:17] You're going to be looking at Scooby-Doo

[04:19] and you're going to be looking at Godfather.

[04:21] Now we hear that Galactic Tank Force is on the line

[04:24] but the question is this,

[04:26] how many games a month can American Pinball make?

[04:29] Does anyone know the answer to that question?

[04:32] You don't.

[04:33] Does anyone know how many Jersey Jack games

[04:35] they can make a month?

[04:36] I would say Jersey Jack has the ability

[04:38] to make around 200 games a week,

[04:41] which would put it somewhere around 800 games a month.

[04:45] I think the battleground is all going to be about access

[04:48] to these new games but there is another thing

[04:51] that I think a lot of people are feeling right now.

[04:53] What if none of these new games is a must-own for you

[04:57] but you want a new pinball machine?

[04:59] Well the good news is there are decades

[05:02] of great pinball machines available for you to buy

[05:05] in great condition all over the place now

[05:08] in the pinball marketplace.

[05:10] So let's just say hypothetically you want to spend $15,000

[05:14] on a pinball machine.

[05:15] Okay, you could buy a Godfather Collectors Edition.

[05:18] You could buy a Foo Fighters with its topper

[05:21] that's coming out in all of its accessories.

[05:23] You could try to cajole someone

[05:25] to sell you their Pulp Fiction LE spot

[05:27] or for $15,000 you can almost go get anything else

[05:33] that's come out in pinball over the last 20 years.

[05:37] And I think that's how people are going to start

[05:39] to approach this hobby,

[05:40] that I might not need the shiny new thing

[05:43] but I want a new pinball experience in my home

[05:47] or in my collection.

[05:48] And for this much money, I mean for $15,000,

[05:51] you can go get like the best version

[05:53] of any Bali Williams game ever made.

[05:56] You can go get almost any single stern alley you want

[05:59] other than a few of them.

[06:00] And I've been noticing right when I talk about theme

[06:03] and the popularity of theme

[06:05] and how theme is so important

[06:06] in not only bolting a game to someone's game room floor

[06:10] but also theme is so important

[06:12] when it comes to value and price.

[06:13] So if you were to look right now

[06:15] and try to go find a Ghostbusters LE,

[06:19] you can't find a single one for sale.

[06:21] If you try to find a Batman 66 LE,

[06:25] you can't find a single one for sale.

[06:28] If you go try to find a Stranger Things LE,

[06:31] if you find one for sale,

[06:32] it's gonna be like close to $20,000.

[06:35] And this is never gonna change now people.

[06:37] We are never gonna go back to the period

[06:40] in which a triple A theme comes out

[06:42] and you're able to get it easily.

[06:45] You're never gonna be able to get it again easily.

[06:47] And even though the prices are climbing

[06:49] to where they're at right now,

[06:50] that does not mean it's gonna be any easier

[06:53] to get these machines.

[06:54] I mean, Impulp Fiction's a great example of that.

[06:56] It's a $10,000 single level game, right?

[07:00] $10,000 single level game with no display whatsoever.

[07:05] And what happened in less than 48 hours,

[07:08] all 1,000 of them sold out, but they didn't just sell out.

[07:12] There are now people who want them,

[07:13] who are offering $1,500 or more,

[07:16] to buy your spot on a game that's not even gonna be made

[07:20] for like the next six to eight months.

[07:22] Now that just goes to show you the power of a theme.

[07:25] And as much as I would love to say

[07:27] that all of these companies have overpriced themselves,

[07:29] and I know I say that a lot about Jersey Jack Pinball,

[07:32] and you know what the thing is this,

[07:33] Jersey Jack Pinball, and I mean this when I say it,

[07:35] it's not that they've overpriced themselves,

[07:38] is that they under-themed themselves, and they did.

[07:41] They under-themed their games for these prices.

[07:45] If Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition was $15,000

[07:49] when it came out, right?

[07:50] Remember all the fanfare.

[07:51] They would have sold every single one for $15,000.

[07:55] The problem is they under-themed themselves

[07:58] with the Godfather and with Toy Story 4.

[08:01] But mark my words, people.

[08:03] If Jersey Jack Pinball had back to the future,

[08:07] or the Matrix, or Top Gun, or Karate Kid,

[08:10] I could go on and on and on, or Die Hard,

[08:13] or Fifth Element, I could go on and on and on.

[08:16] If they had themes that people really, really wanted

[08:19] in the Pinball demographic, they would easily, easily

[08:24] be turning people away at $15,000 a pop

[08:27] for a thousand unit CE run.

[08:29] And look, if they just made Toy Story 1,

[08:31] they would have had no problem selling a thousand CEs

[08:35] for $15,000, and we all know what would have happened.

[08:38] They would be fetching 20,000 for those games

[08:41] if they made the original Toy Story movies.

[08:43] And that is why when we see a game like Galactic Tank Force

[08:46] right now, and I'm studying the Galactic Tank Force feedback,

[08:49] we've seen more streams on the game.

[08:52] People are playing the game at MGC.

[08:54] People are having fun on the machine.

[08:55] But the reason why they're not sold out

[08:58] of this like tank version at $11,000,

[09:01] it's all about the theme.

[09:03] This game is campy, it's weird, it has our curiosity peaked,

[09:08] but there's something deep down inside each and every one

[09:10] of us that's like, all right, like it's a fun game to shoot,

[09:14] it's got my curiosity going, but do I really wanna own one?

[09:19] Do I need to pull the trigger right now?

[09:21] And clearly there's no FOMO, and I think they did make

[09:24] a little bit of a mistake.

[09:25] They should have had one tank cabinet that was super limited,

[09:29] and then the other LE should have been a standard cabinet game,

[09:32] and I think they would have sold a thousand of those

[09:35] at $11,000 that didn't require them

[09:38] to put it in a freaking tank.

[09:39] I think it's a little bit of a weird offering

[09:41] because I think if you just wanna enjoy the game,

[09:44] you're just gonna end up getting the deluxe version

[09:46] of the game because that tank thing is just a weird novelty

[09:50] that's not gonna last long.

[09:51] But as I'm saying, like wait and see,

[09:53] how many of these Galactic Tank Force games

[09:55] can American Pinball make, right?

[09:58] And then how long will the demand last for a game like this?

[10:01] I'm not sure, I'm really not sure.

[10:03] And that's the other reason why a powerful theme

[10:05] is so important because you don't really ever wanna

[10:08] get rid of a theme you love.

[10:10] And that is why on a game like Guns N' Roses,

[10:13] it's my favorite band, I'll never get rid

[10:15] of that pinball machine.

[10:16] If someone made Fifth Element or Big Trouble

[10:19] in Little China, I would never get rid of the machine

[10:23] because I love the theme so much.

[10:25] And I think for Foo Fighter fans out there,

[10:27] they're feeling it.

[10:28] I think for Scooby-Doo fans out there,

[10:30] they're feeling the same way.

[10:31] Final Resisted doesn't have anybody feeling that way.

[10:35] Queen Pinball, maybe if you're a Queen Fanatic,

[10:38] you'll hold on to the pinball machine.

[10:39] Not sure there's enough of a pinball experience there

[10:42] for people to hold on to that game.

[10:44] And then for the Godfather, right?

[10:46] If you're a Godfather Fanatic,

[10:47] what's so tricky about the Godfather,

[10:50] if you love the theme so much,

[10:52] and I know they've added more call-outs and clips,

[10:55] but if you love the movie, right?

[10:56] When you're a diehard Godfather movie fan,

[10:59] I'm not sure there's enough of that movie in the game itself

[11:03] to make you not wanna get rid of it,

[11:05] but I will say this,

[11:06] and I'll say something nice about Godfather.

[11:08] The reviews about the game have been really good.

[11:10] I mean, I've been reading people's reviews of the game

[11:13] and it's definitely Jersey Jack Pinball's

[11:15] best shooting game to date.

[11:17] It's definitely a game that's rewarding people

[11:19] who like deeper code and stacking multi-balls

[11:22] and having a lot of different ways to play the game.

[11:25] So I think if you're a homeowner

[11:27] and you like Jersey Jack Code

[11:29] and you like the way Keith codes the game,

[11:31] I think this game is probably gonna be

[11:33] the most enjoyable Jersey Jack Pinball machine you ever play

[11:37] because it's gonna shoot better than Guns N' Roses.

[11:39] It's gonna have code that's familiar to you

[11:41] that you understand how to figure it out

[11:43] because that's the kind of stuff that appeals to you

[11:45] and it's gonna have flipper feel

[11:47] that doesn't feel like mush.

[11:49] So from a pinball playing standpoint,

[11:52] I think you're gonna be able to get into this game

[11:54] and enjoy it.

[11:55] Now, I also will say this,

[11:57] a lot of people have been playing Godfather

[11:59] at shows and on location

[12:01] and it's still hard to pull the trigger on one

[12:04] because I do think people understand

[12:06] that this game is gonna lose value

[12:08] and if they just wait a few months,

[12:10] they'll be able to get a Godfather

[12:12] for much cheaper than MSRP.

[12:14] But as we go into April and May,

[12:16] it's really gonna come down to

[12:18] who can manufacture these things,

[12:20] who can put games in boxes

[12:22] because with all of these games coming out at once

[12:26] and us seeing the entire industry's like portfolio

[12:30] for the first half of 2023

[12:32] in such a short window of time,

[12:34] I think what's gonna happen is

[12:35] people are gonna become impatient,

[12:37] they're gonna wanna get something new

[12:39] and they're not gonna wanna wait six months

[12:41] to get a Galactic Tank Force.

[12:43] If you got a Scooby-Doo order in,

[12:45] you kind of know exactly

[12:47] when you're gonna get your Scooby-Doo

[12:48] because Spooky Pinball is the only company

[12:51] that tells you we can make this money a month

[12:54] and we make the games in order of numbers.

[12:56] So you know exactly where you stand

[12:58] with your Scooby-Doo order.

[13:00] When it comes to Galactic Tank Force,

[13:02] if you order the game,

[13:04] you probably are guessing you're gonna get your game

[13:06] in a few months, but you have no idea.

[13:09] When it comes to multi-morphic,

[13:10] I think you have no idea

[13:12] when you're gonna get your game.

[13:13] I think Jerry is telling people,

[13:14] if you order a multi-morphic today,

[13:17] you will not get your full cabinet

[13:20] until a year from now.

[13:21] And then Pulp Fiction, you know, with CGC,

[13:24] this is what's interesting about all the Pulp Fiction hype.

[13:26] How long can it last knowing

[13:27] that Chicago Gaming Company is nowhere close

[13:30] to making this game?

[13:31] It is kind of strange that they revealed it so early on.

[13:35] Have we ever seen a game that got revealed on purpose

[13:39] so far from its manufacturing date?

[13:42] Strange move by Chicago Gaming Company.

[13:45] I don't like it because why?

[13:48] Like why did you have to show it now?

[13:50] Because now that we've seen the game,

[13:52] we know they're sitting on a really awesome machine,

[13:54] a super cool machine,

[13:56] this would have worked well whenever they launched it.

[13:59] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[14:00] Like they didn't need to get in front

[14:01] of all of this crowded space.

[14:03] They easily could have sold this game to us

[14:06] in the summer or early fall

[14:08] and definitely had all thousand games sell out.

[14:11] So I'm really curious.

[14:12] Here's what I think is gonna happen.

[14:13] I'm gonna end this show with two things.

[14:15] I'm gonna tell you what I think is gonna happen

[14:16] with all of these games.

[14:18] And then I'm gonna tell you a new rumor

[14:20] that you haven't heard anywhere else

[14:22] about what I am hearing might be the next game

[14:25] from Dutch Pinball that is a licensed game.

[14:28] So get ready for that.

[14:29] And if you're new to the Canadian Club,

[14:30] this is why people love Canadian Spinball Podcast

[14:32] because I will give you rumors like this

[14:34] well before anybody else.

[14:36] So let me go down a list of these six games.

[14:38] Here's my thing about Pulp Fiction.

[14:40] I think people are gonna get tired of the wait,

[14:42] but they're not gonna drop out of this machine.

[14:45] This machine is definitely something really sexy.

[14:48] It's something super cool.

[14:49] And this theme is so popular.

[14:51] Here's my prediction.

[14:52] I think Pulp Fiction LEs,

[14:54] and I know what you're thinking

[14:55] because I have an order.

[14:56] You think I'm shilling it, but no.

[14:58] Here's my prediction.

[14:59] I think Pulp Fiction LEs

[15:01] are gonna end up trading around $13,000 to $15,000

[15:06] when they finally get made.

[15:07] And I think that's the same price

[15:10] that James Bond's 60th will end up becoming worth,

[15:13] like $15,000.

[15:15] Did you see the James Bond's 60th got brought to MGC

[15:19] by tilt amusements and they got in trouble

[15:22] from Stern Pinball because Stern Pinball

[15:24] did not want any of its distributors

[15:26] to bring the game to a show so people could bang on it.

[15:31] They wanted to make it an exclusive thing

[15:33] for the 500 homeowners.

[15:35] Shame on you, Stern Pinball,

[15:37] for not wanting to bring a pinball machine

[15:40] to a show for people to play.

[15:42] You're still trying to sell all of these.

[15:45] Do you think they sold all 500 at $20,000?

[15:49] They absolutely have not.

[15:51] And what sucks is I hear this game is freaking amazing.

[15:55] Everyone who plays James Bond's 60th absolutely loves it.

[15:59] I really wish they wouldn't have done

[16:01] the silly shenanigans around only $520,000.

[16:06] I really wish they would have made it

[16:08] so more people could enjoy this game.

[16:10] And dare I say it,

[16:11] it sounds like people are having a lot more fun

[16:14] on Bond's 60th than they are

[16:17] on the regular James Bond game.

[16:19] Crazy, right?

[16:20] How these two single level games

[16:22] are getting such accolades by pinball fanatics in 2023.

[16:28] What is this go to show all of us?

[16:30] That pinball fun can come at us in many different forms.

[16:34] And I think both Bond's 60th and Pulp Fiction

[16:38] are proof that you don't need a bunch of ramps

[16:41] to have a ton of pinball fun.

[16:43] Heck, you don't even need screens

[16:44] to have a ton of pinball fun.

[16:46] So Pulp Fiction LE will stay very strong in price

[16:49] and people will have to wait patiently.

[16:51] Now, Foo Fighters,

[16:52] what do I think is gonna happen with Foo Fighters?

[16:54] Look, I think all Foo Fighters LEs

[16:56] are gonna get to customers in the next three weeks.

[16:59] I think that's gonna be exciting.

[17:01] I think this game shoots really well.

[17:03] I think the code and animations look incredible.

[17:05] I think Foo Fighters is gonna be a fun game

[17:08] to hold people over until Venom comes out

[17:11] in the latter half of the summer.

[17:13] I think the Foo Fighter LE will hold its value.

[17:16] I don't think it's gonna go up in value.

[17:18] I don't think you're gonna see people wanting

[17:19] to spend 14, 15,000 for one.

[17:22] I think LEs will probably stay between 11, 5,

[17:25] and 12, 5 for a game.

[17:26] I think they'll lose a little bit of value.

[17:28] You know, as Stern gets caught up on its backlog,

[17:30] I think their premiums are all gonna lose

[17:32] a little bit of value, but not a lot of value.

[17:34] I think you'll be safe if you go in on a Stern premium.

[17:37] And I think Foo Fighters is gonna be a game

[17:38] that people enjoy.

[17:39] I think if you're fans of the Foo Fighters,

[17:41] you'll end up keeping it.

[17:43] I think if you're a pinball fanatic,

[17:45] will it stay in your collection very long?

[17:47] My prediction is this thing will stay in your collection

[17:50] until Keith Elwin's new pin comes out,

[17:52] which is rumored to be Jaws.

[17:54] All right, Scooby Scooby Doo, where are you?

[17:56] What's my prediction for Scooby Doo?

[17:57] So look, I've been hearing from more and more operators

[18:00] that Scooby Doo Pinball is a little bit problematic

[18:03] for location play.

[18:05] So I think we're gonna see maybe some operators

[18:07] start to list their games for sale.

[18:09] I think Scooby Doo is gonna be a game

[18:10] that's gonna be pretty easy to get your hands on one.

[18:13] It's a really casual, easy game for pinball players.

[18:16] There's work to be done on the code.

[18:19] I think if you win it on this game already,

[18:20] you're gonna regret it because here's why.

[18:22] It's not that I don't think the game's gonna end up

[18:24] being fun or good.

[18:25] I just think we're gonna see a lot more

[18:27] Scooby Doo spots open up for sale

[18:30] for less than people bought them for.

[18:32] And again, like any savings is good savings, right?

[18:34] I think you might be able to save $500 to $1,000

[18:38] if you want a Scooby Doo.

[18:39] And I also think you're gonna be able to cut the line

[18:42] and get your Scooby Doo for like $1,000 less

[18:45] than people who paid a non-refundable deposit for the game.

[18:48] Whether or not this game stays in people's collections

[18:51] is all gonna come down to the code.

[18:53] It's really gonna come down to how much polish

[18:56] Spooky puts into this machine.

[18:58] You know, and that's what it's gonna come down to.

[19:00] Are they gonna be able to code a lot of magical moments

[19:03] into the machine that make people wanna hold on to it?

[19:06] Again, if you're a Scooby Doo fanatic,

[19:07] you might never sell it, but I think, you know,

[19:10] the code is gonna be the big thing

[19:11] about this game in the long run.

[19:13] All right, the Godfather.

[19:14] What do I think is gonna happen with the Godfather?

[19:16] Well, I've been saying this.

[19:17] I think this game is overpriced and under-themed

[19:20] for the price.

[19:21] And that's just the thing.

[19:23] Is it the best shooting Jersey Jack game to date?

[19:25] Probably.

[19:26] Is it Eric Minier's best game to date?

[19:28] I don't know.

[19:29] I would argue against that.

[19:31] I think G&R and Pirates of the Caribbean still feel

[19:33] like more cohesive packages.

[19:35] Is it beautiful?

[19:36] Absolutely.

[19:37] Have I stood over this game with my jaw dropped?

[19:40] Absolutely.

[19:41] It's a stunning machine.

[19:42] Is it the Godfather movie?

[19:44] That's questionable.

[19:46] Is it a deep game that if you have a home environment,

[19:48] you're really gonna be able to get into it?

[19:50] Absolutely.

[19:51] But my thing about the Godfather is this.

[19:53] It's only overpriced because it's under-themed.

[19:56] I think this game is gonna lose the most value

[19:59] out of all of these new machines over the next four months.

[20:02] And I think you're looking at a $15,000 CE

[20:06] will probably sell for 12 to 13,000.

[20:10] And I think these $12,000 LEs,

[20:12] they're having a hard time selling them

[20:14] because they said they're gonna make 5,000.

[20:16] I think these LEs are gonna start to trade

[20:18] for like 9,800 real soon.

[20:20] And so if you wanna enjoy a Godfather,

[20:23] I would just wait.

[20:24] Galactic Tank Force, here's my thing.

[20:25] I think after the Jack Danger stream tomorrow,

[20:28] by the way, Jack Danger's streaming the game tomorrow,

[20:30] I think after we see more great players jump on this machine

[20:34] and the more you see of the code and the light shows,

[20:38] I think all of our curiosity is gonna start to fade

[20:41] a little bit as we see more of the game.

[20:44] And I think once that happens

[20:46] and some of the novelty starts to wear off,

[20:48] I think your desire to own this game,

[20:51] if you really, really want a Galactic Tank Force,

[20:53] I think a lot of you are just gonna wait.

[20:56] I think you're gonna wait it out.

[20:57] I think American Pinball is gonna be making this game

[20:59] for a long time.

[21:01] I think the Deluxe is really the version to get,

[21:03] which is not limited.

[21:05] And so I think if you want a GTF,

[21:08] you are absolutely gonna find one to play on location

[21:11] or at one of these shows before you pull the trigger.

[21:14] And I think it's gonna be a slow burn

[21:17] for sales of this game.

[21:19] I think if you buy that Sig Edition for 17.5,

[21:22] you're gonna lose about like $4,000 immediately.

[21:26] And I think the elite tanks will somewhat hold their value

[21:29] because there's such a weird, quirky thing.

[21:32] But I also think it's one of those games

[21:34] where people aren't gonna really appreciate

[21:36] or value that quirkiness until it's long gone.

[21:39] Like five years from now when everyone's like,

[21:42] remember that Galactic Tank game?

[21:44] And it's always gonna be that kind of game

[21:46] that breaks up the monotony of a collection.

[21:48] The thing is though,

[21:49] I just don't think there's that level of urgency

[21:52] to break up your collection right now with one.

[21:55] It just feels like one of those games.

[21:56] Like we're not gonna fully want it

[21:59] until we can't have anymore.

[22:00] Final Resistance, I just don't know if this game

[22:03] is enough to sell more units of multi-morphic platforms.

[22:07] I think if you own a multi-morphic, you're gonna get it.

[22:10] For all 200 of you out there, congratulations.

[22:13] You have another game for your platform.

[22:15] But with all of these games coming out,

[22:17] it just gets lost in the mix somehow.

[22:20] And Queen Pinball, I feel the same way about.

[22:22] I just don't feel like Queen Pinball

[22:24] is ever gonna get any sales traction

[22:26] with this crowded space.

[22:28] And I think so few people are gonna be in on Queen Pinball.

[22:31] And that again, might be another game

[22:32] where there's not a long run of them.

[22:35] And maybe a few years from now,

[22:37] they become in demand because they didn't make many.

[22:39] But the big caveat to that is

[22:42] there's usually a reason why they didn't make many.

[22:44] And that's because people didn't want it.

[22:46] And you never wanna be there.

[22:47] Like if you make a Pinball machine,

[22:49] it should be magical on day one like Godzilla was, right?

[22:53] We're not rooting for games to have value down the road.

[22:57] We should be rooting for games to be magical and special.

[23:00] And I mean that.

[23:00] That's what we should be rooting for as a community.

[23:03] We wanna see great games that deliver great Pinball magic

[23:07] that create great Pinball moments.

[23:10] And that's why I want to keep it.

[23:12] That's why it's valuable to me on an emotional level,

[23:16] not just a fiscal level, an emotional level.

[23:19] And then it's just icing on the cake

[23:21] if way more people want it

[23:23] than there is supply of the game down the road.

[23:25] All right, now I'm gonna end this show

[23:27] with a real quick rumor.

[23:28] So here is the rumor I heard

[23:30] that might be Dutch Pinball's next game

[23:33] after the big Lebowski, their next licensed game.

[23:37] Now this is just a rumor,

[23:39] but my person says it's from a very reliable source.

[23:42] Now Barry over at Dutch Pinball,

[23:44] he also listens to Canadian Pinball podcast.

[23:47] So Barry, if this rumor is false,

[23:50] will you reach out to me and tell me it's false?

[23:53] Tough spot there because if he doesn't comment,

[23:56] then we're all gonna think it's real.

[23:57] So the rumored game I'm hearing is next

[24:00] from Dutch Pinball is a game that has already been made.

[24:03] It's a game that was made by Data East,

[24:06] but that does not mean this game could not be made better.

[24:09] This is one of the most popular licenses of all time.

[24:12] And this movie is a classic movie,

[24:14] but it never had a great Pinball machine.

[24:16] I'm looking at the score right now.

[24:18] It is ranked number 252 on the pin side top 100.

[24:24] It has an overall rating of 6.928, so not a great game.

[24:31] So this is the game that I hear

[24:34] that Dutch Pinball is working on.

[24:36] It is a remake of no other than Batman 1989.

[24:42] Batman 1989 with Michael Keaton

[24:46] and Jack Nicholson as the Joker.

[24:49] And my gosh, if they got the assets to this movie

[24:53] with hopefully the print soundtrack for that movie,

[24:56] I mean, this could be a humongous,

[25:00] and I mean this, a humongous hit

[25:02] if Dutch Pinball makes Batman 1989 and does it justice.

[25:07] Okay, you heard it here first.

[25:09] Now look, Barry might be writing to me right now

[25:11] being like it's not that game and I might ruin our dreams.

[25:14] But again, you see how powerful a theme is

[25:18] if they made this game and did it right.

[25:20] How many of us would not be clamoring to get one?

[25:23] Everybody have a great day.

[25:25] Thank you for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[25:27] We're gonna have a lot of fun talking about

[25:29] all these new games as they start

[25:31] to make their way into the world.

[25:32] Have a great day later.

[25:34] Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
