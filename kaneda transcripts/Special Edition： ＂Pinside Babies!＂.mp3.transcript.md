[00:00] Why are there so many babies on Pinside?

[00:21] And I don't mean babies like young little kids sucking their thumbs, I mean grown adult

[00:27] babies who just seem to cry and moan all the time.

[00:33] In this special edition of the Canadian Pimbal Podcast, I would like to examine the Pinside

[00:37] baby, that individual who constantly finds something wrong with everything.

[00:43] But when given a chance to act on his or her beliefs, that person becomes a complete

[00:49] hypocrite.

[00:50] Let's take for example this whole notion of medieval madness remake.

[00:56] Okay, everybody is crying about the display and how it's going to cost money.

[01:03] Alright, now we have a whole new army of Pinside babies that are born when something like this

[01:09] occurs.

[01:10] Whaa, whaa, you told me I didn't have to pay anything more for this and you were going

[01:16] to give me a color display and you didn't.

[01:18] And now you're saying I have to pay and I'm going to cry and moan.

[01:22] Now this Pinside baby is incapable of understanding the realities of the situation.

[01:27] That when Rick and company go back and instead of just giving you colored dots or even a

[01:33] color DMD, they are going back and recoding the entire animation around the game and what

[01:39] they've shown so far indicates that this is going to be the greatest color dot game of

[01:45] all time.

[01:46] It's super freaking cool.

[01:49] But somehow the Pinside baby thinks that all of that work that went into coding that

[01:53] should be free or at least be given to them at a discount.

[01:56] Why?

[01:57] When I ask the Pinside babies why, you get this kind of response.

[02:01] Well, I waited really long for my game, Kaneda and I don't want to have to pay more

[02:06] for the dots.

[02:07] I don't even care if they worked on it.

[02:09] I waited two years, Dammit, and I deserve it for free.

[02:13] I mean, come on.

[02:14] Give me a break.

[02:15] It doesn't matter how long you waited.

[02:17] That's not some like badge of honor.

[02:20] Nobody gives a shit how long you waited for your game or how long your game was ordered.

[02:25] Let me quickly change gears to another thread where that's taking place.

[02:29] When people make some bold comment about how they ordered their hobbit on December something,

[02:36] in 2012, and I'm just getting my game now.

[02:39] Congratulations, you're an idiot, you waited four years, nobody gives a shit.

[02:44] Okay, let's go back to medieval madness.

[02:47] So the dots, they're going to cost money.

[02:50] Who knows?

[02:51] Is it going to be 200?

[02:52] Is it going to be $300?

[02:53] Is it going to be $100?

[02:54] I don't know.

[02:55] You don't know.

[02:56] But let's make a whole ton of pages speculating about the price and moaning about it.

[03:01] Here's what's going to happen.

[03:02] Everyone who's bitching and moaning about it, everyone who says I'm not going to pay the

[03:07] price, it better be zero or nothing.

[03:09] You know what those people are going to do?

[03:11] They're going to buy it.

[03:12] Of course they're going to buy it.

[03:14] No one's going to want to have a medieval madness remake without the awesome display.

[03:19] And this is what always what happens.

[03:21] Everyone always says I am not going to pre-order again.

[03:24] And then they pre-order again.

[03:25] Let's talk about that topic, pre-orders.

[03:27] Okay, so everyone is moaning and groaning.

[03:30] And there's just that constant sort of state of bitching about the medieval madness remake

[03:34] and the insert issue and the weight issue and the whole issue with the color dots being

[03:40] an extra charge.

[03:42] So what does everyone say they're going to do?

[03:44] We got guys, we got guys like Fraleck who, you know, they put their hands on their hips

[03:48] and they say, that's it for me.

[03:50] I'm not going to pre-order again.

[03:52] And I'm going to let my money do the talking.

[03:54] And if we just all stop pre-ordering, then they'll get their act together.

[03:59] And what's going to happen?

[04:00] The second they announce their next title, Fraleck will be the first person in the world

[04:03] to get it.

[04:04] And that's the reality of how it works.

[04:07] Everyone moans and groans and they don't do anything.

[04:09] Look guys, if you don't want any of this shenanigans to go on, just don't buy the game.

[04:15] I think, personally, I think it's a terrible, terrible, terrible idea to remake 10 of the

[04:21] popular games from the past all over again.

[04:23] I don't care if there's better internals, it's going to sink this damn collecting hobby.

[04:28] If everything just keeps getting remade and remade and remade, then you wake up and nothing

[04:33] is special.

[04:34] Nothing is sought after.

[04:35] Nothing is rare.

[04:37] What's the fun in that if you just keep remaking stuff?

[04:40] But anyway, I digress.

[04:41] What's another thing people are moaning about on Pinside in the last couple of weeks?

[04:45] Oh, God forbid, Stern should make some different armor for Ghostbusters and show it to the community.

[04:53] What happens?

[04:54] Whaaat?

[04:55] Whaaat?

[04:56] I just spent $8,000 on an LE that I bought before even seeing how the game works.

[05:02] And now I'm unhappy, because they have different armor and I don't want to spend an extra

[05:07] $300 for this armor.

[05:10] I should get this instead of the Lollipop rails.

[05:14] Oh, guys, somebody give the community a bunch of Lollipops and make them happy again.

[05:21] I mean, seriously, all these grown men whining about their pinball, side armor railing.

[05:28] I mean, seriously, is there anything else less important in the world right now than

[05:33] what your pinball side armor railing is and how you feel like you're getting fleeced

[05:39] because your $8,000 pin might now require you to drop an additional $200-$300 on it?

[05:46] I mean, for fuck's sakes, who cares?

[05:49] I mean, at the end of the day, Stern is going to make a bunch of options for your pinball

[05:55] machine.

[05:56] And here's what?

[05:57] If you don't like it, don't buy it.

[06:01] It's that simple.

[06:02] They didn't do this to offend you.

[06:05] They didn't rip you off with the LE offering.

[06:08] And anyone who thinks that the Ghostbusters LE isn't enough, I mean, it's got all new

[06:14] original art from Zambietti on it and what else do you want?

[06:19] You know, Stern could easily, easily put a feature on the play field that's not in the premium

[06:26] or the pro.

[06:27] And what would happen?

[06:28] You guys wouldn't mone in bitch so much more about that than anything else.

[06:33] All those people who think they're Tron Pro fully modded equals a Tron LE.

[06:38] Nope, they're still butt hurt because of one mode, like some daft punk multi-ball they

[06:44] can't possibly get or recreate.

[06:47] What do you want, guys?

[06:49] You bitch about the fact that LEDs don't have enough to separate them to justify the

[06:54] price and then if Stern goes and actually does more, that's different from the other

[06:58] models, you'll bitch in mone about that.

[07:01] So there's a no win situation there.

[07:04] What else is going on that people are moaning and groaning about?

[07:06] Oh, this is one of my favorites.

[07:08] Someone got their medieval madness remake and there was a hand print under the cabinet,

[07:13] guys.

[07:14] I mean, what the hell is going on in the world?

[07:17] How's this world going to survive?

[07:19] If there's a hand print underneath the cabinet of medieval madness remake, I mean, stop

[07:23] the press.

[07:25] All these issues going on in the world, now, starving children, you know, countries falling

[07:30] apart, bombs falling on innocent individuals, and there's a hand print underneath the cabinet

[07:36] of my medieval madness remake.

[07:39] My $8,000 toy has to be cleaned before I can have peace of mind, before I can sleep at night.

[07:46] That hand print, I want that hand print dusted.

[07:48] I want those fingerprints removed.

[07:50] I want an investigation into that factory, ladies and gentlemen to find out who put that

[07:55] hand print there and get rid of that individual.

[07:57] That person has no pride in their job.

[08:00] This is all that's wrong in America.

[08:01] We want to make America great again.

[08:03] We need to start first and foremost with removing the hand prints from pinball cabinets.

[08:08] Where's the politician who's got that on his agenda?

[08:12] That person has my vote.

[08:13] It has pin sides vote.

[08:14] I mean, this is just getting ridiculous.

[08:16] And then there's a whole thread.

[08:17] There's a whole chain about people chiming in about dirt in a factory.

[08:23] That's how low it's gotten over the last couple of weeks on pin side where we have to

[08:30] really analyze the fact that there's dirt in a factory and that dirt to get onto a worker's

[08:34] hand who could get onto the underside of a cabinet on pinball cabinet.

[08:39] I mean, this is ridiculous.

[08:41] What else is going on?

[08:42] That's just ridiculous.

[08:43] Oh, yeah.

[08:44] How about we continue to make fun of women on pin side?

[08:47] It's the greatest pastime.

[08:49] I had a great interview with Sally Sparks.

[08:51] She's an awesome person.

[08:53] She has a big relationship to pinball and she stepped away from it.

[08:56] I thought her story was so much more interesting than just interviewing the same old story about

[09:02] women discriminated in pinball and bells and chimes and how we're trying to get a tournament

[09:06] going.

[09:07] I get it.

[09:08] I support that.

[09:09] I support all people playing pinball and having fun.

[09:10] But the fact that you got these babies in the thread continuing to make fun of women,

[09:15] really?

[09:16] You're just making broad comments and it's just a boys club kind of mentality.

[09:21] But to specifically call her out and knowing that she gave her some of her personal time

[09:26] and had an intimate conversation and then you want to make fun of her name saying she's

[09:29] a porn star.

[09:30] I mean, that's just like despicable.

[09:32] I don't look directly at guys like Beasel Boob.

[09:35] This guy has his stick on pin side where he's always in with his little jabs and his

[09:39] little like snide remarks.

[09:41] And I've met the guy in real life and he's just a grown up clown.

[09:45] He's nothing like his pin side persona at all.

[09:48] And he needs to put on that stupid act to have any sort of attention come his way because

[09:52] in real life, out in the real world, is any woman showing this guy attention?

[09:57] Did they ever?

[09:58] I mean, come on.

[09:59] It's despicable that he talks about women the way he does considering what's in the mirror

[10:03] for that dude.

[10:04] And man, just grow up a little bit.

[10:06] So what else is going on?

[10:07] What else are people whining about?

[10:08] Oh yeah, everyone's favorite baby of all time.

[10:11] Why snow?

[10:12] Please get this man a freaking coin door that accepts dollar bills.

[10:17] You know why snow?

[10:18] I got an idea for you.

[10:19] If you really want to just accept dollar bills and then the machine doesn't come with it,

[10:22] you can just stand next to your machines, bend over and put a sign on where people can

[10:27] insert their dollar bills.

[10:28] I'm sure you'll get more money that way, man.

[10:31] I bet he would.

[10:32] I bet he would.

[10:33] Well, look, it's been, it's, I think we're in this period right now in pin side and

[10:37] just in the pinball world where people are waiting.

[10:42] They're waiting for any news.

[10:44] I wish Stern would just show the damn magnetic slings already.

[10:49] Show them.

[10:50] Show us how it works.

[10:52] It's not, it was designed first.

[10:55] We know it's out there.

[10:56] I know they're waiting.

[10:57] They're waiting the rumor.

[10:58] Is that they're not going to do it until the pro start shipping.

[11:03] But man, that's going to be the thing that takes over everyone's attention when those

[11:07] slings get shown.

[11:08] Just show it.

[11:09] Show it.

[11:11] You know, some people can just stop speculating and bitching and becoming more of the babies.

[11:17] And look, here's a deal, guys.

[11:19] We're all babies.

[11:21] We're all babies.

[11:24] If you think it's just Beasel Boob, if you think it's just Weissnow, if you think it's

[11:28] just Fralik, if you think it's just Canada who is the biggest baby of them all, guys,

[11:33] we all are babies.

[11:35] It's, it's what we do.

[11:37] There's not enough news in the Pimbal world to fill the damn site and to have a community

[11:45] if we're not all going to be constantly moaning and groaning about things that nobody

[11:48] out in the real world gives a damn about.

[11:51] And you know what?

[11:52] I love it.

[11:53] I love it.

[11:54] I love listening to people moaning, groaning, complaining.

[11:56] You know why I love it?

[11:58] Because it shows they care.

[12:00] It shows they're passionate about it.

[12:02] And as much as I have a love, hate relationship with Pimbal in the community because it just,

[12:06] there's days, there's days where I just read the site.

[12:10] I just can't stand what people bitch and moan about.

[12:15] But there's days when it's great.

[12:18] And there's days where I feel like bitching and moaning about everything I read on there.

[12:21] And there's days where like I don't care just to game them, having fun.

[12:25] There's days where I wake up and I love playing Pimbal.

[12:28] There's days where I wake up and it's the last thing I want to do.

[12:32] But I'll tell you this.

[12:33] I'll tell you this.

[12:35] I'll tell you this.

[12:36] Get wise snow, a god damn dollar bill acceptor.

[12:40] Because if we don't, he may find a third way to try and sell his new inbox.

[12:46] America is most honoured.

[12:49] That's it for this crazy little rant kind of day of Canadian Pimbal podcast, special edition,

[12:55] inside babies.
