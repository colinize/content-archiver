[00:00] I am a real American, Fight for the rights of every man, I am a real American, Fight for

[00:15] what's right, Fight for your life.

[00:18] We had to let that intro go a little bit longer in memory of Hulk Hogan.

[00:46] What a difficult week for all of us in Gen X, we lost Theo Huckstable, Ozzy Osbourne, and

[00:53] Hulk Hogan all in one week.

[00:57] Terrible, terrible.

[00:58] I can't tell you when I was a little kid, we watched Hulk Hogan and Hulkamania more than

[01:04] anybody.

[01:05] I feel like Vince McMahon has guided me into adulthood and nowadays all that would be cancelled,

[01:13] my toxic masculinity, wanting to put people in a headlock, how many times I would leg drop

[01:18] my twin brother.

[01:20] It was like what we grew up, it was like what are parents, let us watch, you go back and

[01:26] watch it now, parents would never let their kids watch this stuff.

[01:30] And hey, we all turned out okay, we all got some grit, we all got some thick skin, it's

[01:37] everybody else that needs to grow up with more Hulk Hogan's in the world, more Ozzy Osbourne's,

[01:43] more Theo's, but definitely not more Bill Cosby's.

[01:47] So what do I want to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast?

[01:50] Well, it's a slow week, it really is.

[01:54] And so the theme of this show, because we're missing some of our Gen X icons, is missing

[01:59] in action.

[02:01] What is missing in action right now from the Pinball world?

[02:04] Number one, Chicago Gaming Companies, Merlin's edition of Medieval Madness.

[02:11] Where is this game?

[02:13] I feel like it's been like six months since this game was revealed, maybe not that long,

[02:19] but everybody who ordered one was expecting to get this game in the summer.

[02:25] It's July 25th and you have no idea where your game is.

[02:30] And I don't think you're getting it anytime soon.

[02:33] And once again, Chicago Gaming Company continues to throw its customers into the mulcher, make

[02:39] you wait forever, have zero communication, and take your money, and that's that.

[02:45] And they've made this game three times already.

[02:48] Three times!

[02:49] Why is it so hard to just order the same parts, put the same game together that they've already

[02:55] put together three times?

[02:57] So shame on you, Chicago Gaming Company, you know how I feel about them, I wouldn't buy

[03:01] anything from them.

[03:03] I don't care.

[03:04] I don't care.

[03:05] Even if they made, I don't know, if they made a Kira, I probably still would not buy it

[03:08] because I'm so disgusted by how these people leave their customers in the dark.

[03:13] What else is missing in the Pinball world?

[03:16] Missing Spike 3?

[03:18] Where's that?

[03:19] When is Stern Pinball going to pull the Band-Aid off and actually give us Spike 3?

[03:25] It is again, July 25th.

[03:27] The year is half over.

[03:29] We know this is their next platform move.

[03:32] We know the price increase is coming, and that is probably the number one reason why

[03:37] they're not doing it, is they don't want to raise the prices because they know if they

[03:43] did it on King Kong or they did it on any of these other games, people are not buying,

[03:50] and they don't want to hand their customers even more losses, but they're going to have

[03:53] to do it sooner or later.

[03:55] And so I fully expect Spike 3, which is still missing in action, to be sometime in August,

[04:01] early September.

[04:02] I expect it to be Star Wars episodes 4 through 6, and I think they need Star Wars to justify

[04:09] the price increase that is coming.

[04:11] I'm hearing it is $500 across every single model.

[04:15] So Pinball is getting more expensive.

[04:18] As people lose more and more money, it's getting more and more expensive.

[04:22] Does that make any sense?

[04:23] No, it does not.

[04:24] What else is missing in the Pinball world?

[04:26] Not seeing a lot of Dune unboxings.

[04:29] I think we're going to get more of them, but it still feels like this game didn't fully

[04:34] come out with volume of product.

[04:36] And so I look forward to seeing more people get it, but it still feels like it's missing,

[04:40] doesn't it?

[04:41] Doesn't it feel like, I don't know, the game's been out for a while, it's been out for four

[04:45] or five months.

[04:46] I don't feel like they've even sent out more than 100,000 dollars.

[04:52] That's not a lot, gang.

[04:56] Think about it, 100 games after four months is two machines per state.

[05:02] Now think about them going overseas as well, and you start to realize not a lot in the

[05:08] world.

[05:09] It's also kind of crazy when you think about it.

[05:10] There's 50 states in America that loves Pinball, right?

[05:13] And you can't even sell a thousand units.

[05:16] You can't get 20 people per state to buy your game.

[05:22] Think about that.

[05:24] Isn't that crazy?

[05:25] All you need to sell a thousand units is 20 people in 50 states, and you've got a thousand

[05:32] units sold.

[05:33] When you break it down like that, doesn't it get really embarrassing when you have to

[05:38] spend months trying to get a thousand people to see your vision?

[05:42] Canada gets more people watching my content every week than they've sold of Dune Pinball

[05:48] machines.

[05:49] That's not good.

[05:50] That's not good.

[05:51] Any game you make, there should be more demand than there is demand for Canada's Pinball

[05:55] podcast.

[05:56] I've set the bar real low, people.

[06:00] If you can't get more attention than me, you're doing something wrong.

[06:04] All right, what else is missing in the Pinball world?

[06:07] Predator, it's not out yet.

[06:08] I mean, I keep seeing all these videos on Facebook, but I talked to one of the biggest

[06:13] distros and they only sold two games.

[06:16] And by the time they make Predator, I don't know, man.

[06:19] I think Star Wars is going to be out.

[06:22] I think more and more people are going to be loving their Harry Potter's.

[06:25] I saw a picture yesterday of Harry Potter next to Elton John.

[06:29] Beautiful.

[06:30] Beautiful.

[06:31] Say what you will, Bond.

[06:32] I'm talking to you, Bond.

[06:34] Say what you will about JJP.

[06:36] But when you see those two machines at night lit up, it's gorgeous, man.

[06:42] It is gorgeous.

[06:43] Stern, you need to get to where these guys are at when it comes to the presentation of

[06:47] Pinball.

[06:48] So Predator is missing in action.

[06:51] What about a portal?

[06:53] Is anybody even playing portal?

[06:57] Where are the portal?

[06:58] So I heard off the record, I heard something like Multimorphic has sold north of 700 games.

[07:06] Do you believe that?

[07:08] Do you believe that there are more than 700 people in the world with a Multimorphic?

[07:15] I go in the club thread.

[07:16] Nobody's there.

[07:17] So did everybody who bought this is not on pin side?

[07:21] It's not on Facebook?

[07:22] I mean, I don't know.

[07:23] I don't know.

[07:24] I don't buy it.

[07:25] I don't buy it.

[07:26] I don't buy it.

[07:27] I can't buy it.

[07:29] Now if he has cool and that's like a decent user base if you will for every new game,

[07:35] but man, portal is like $6,000.

[07:38] You do the math.

[07:39] Like let's say even 500, 6,000 times 500 owners, it's not a bad payday for Jerry, but I just

[07:47] see portals being unboxed.

[07:50] Evil deads, those are making their way out.

[07:52] I think Spooky's probably closing in on the halfway mark and it makes sense because we're

[07:59] halfway through the year and what a great business model.

[08:03] We're going to make as many games as we can make a year.

[08:06] We're going to make one game a year and by the time we're done making this game, the

[08:11] next game gets revealed and we're off again.

[08:14] Every year we can put this much million back into the company, this much money into our

[08:19] pockets and we can stay afloat.

[08:22] We're not going to overexpand.

[08:23] We're not going to overproduce.

[08:25] We're not going to overpromise.

[08:27] What a great, I don't know, I'm going to start to talk like Scooby Doo right now.

[08:30] That's not even Scooby Doo.

[08:31] It's like Happy Gilmore and Scooby Doo.

[08:34] What is wrong with you, Canada?

[08:35] I'm a little hungover, to be honest.

[08:37] I went out last night to tell me jazz with one of my clients, really hungover.

[08:42] Not feeling great in the head today, but it's a beautiful sunny day and every day above

[08:48] ground, especially after we just lost some of our heroes, is definitely a good day.

[08:53] What else is happening in the pinball world?

[08:55] What else is missing from pinball?

[08:57] Pinball connectivity?

[08:58] How about the internet and pinball?

[09:01] Where's the internet on almost every single game out there?

[09:06] Jersey Jacks got Wi-Fi, but nothing really else.

[09:09] Stern's got their little badges that I don't know who cares about those stupid things,

[09:14] but the games aren't really connected.

[09:16] So internet connectivity, are we going to see it?

[09:18] Are we going to see it expand?

[09:19] We've got stuff like PinQuest, Neil's working on that.

[09:22] He's helping to connect all the games out there on location so operators can actually

[09:27] turn pinball into things that reward both the operator and the consumer.

[09:34] So really cool.

[09:35] I'm working with Neil on his video.

[09:36] He needs to do a little work, make it a little bit more exciting, and maybe not put everything

[09:40] into the video.

[09:42] We're not going to sit through four minutes, Neil, but we love what you're doing.

[09:46] What else is going on in the pinball world that's missing?

[09:49] What is missing?

[09:50] Is Jack Danger missing?

[09:51] No, Jack Danger is about to stream.

[09:53] I think he's streaming this weekend.

[09:54] I had a little conversation on the side with Jack.

[09:57] He's doing well.

[09:58] I think all of this is going to work out to his benefit.

[10:01] So for those of you thinking Jack Danger is never going to design a game again, that's

[10:06] not going to be the case.

[10:07] I just think the guy needs a little bit of a break and I understand it.

[10:11] And for those of you out there, when you go home at night and your job comes home with

[10:15] you, and it disrupts your family, your peace of mind, you want out like you want out.

[10:20] And I love the fact that Stern Pinball found a solution for Jack because for a lot of us,

[10:26] and I'm speaking from experience, for a lot of us, when work gets really crappy, there's

[10:31] no way out.

[10:33] We've got bills to pay.

[10:34] We've got mouths to feed.

[10:35] We've got Gucci clothes to buy.

[10:38] We've got demons to gas up.

[10:39] You can't just leave.

[10:41] You can't just walk away.

[10:43] And you've got to bite it.

[10:44] And a lot of times you bring that home.

[10:45] And when you bring it home, it's not fun.

[10:47] It's never fun.

[10:49] So what else is missing in the pinball world?

[10:51] Oh, man, I don't know, man.

[10:53] I think we're missing more nostalgic themes.

[10:56] I just want to say that.

[10:58] We are missing nostalgic themes, real nostalgic themes.

[11:03] We need nostalgia.

[11:04] Now, I'm here to tell you right now.

[11:06] Steve Richie's game, it's going to be nostalgic.

[11:09] It's going to be a game you're going to want.

[11:11] I heard a little bit more about it.

[11:12] I heard a little bit more about how they're going to handle the theme.

[11:15] I'm getting one.

[11:16] I'm 100% getting one.

[11:17] I know I say this every once in a while, but I guarantee you, when Steve Richie's next

[11:22] game is revealed, I am getting one.

[11:26] It is something I grew up loving.

[11:28] It is a theme that is iconic.

[11:31] And I think they're going to handle it the right way.

[11:33] And I'm so excited.

[11:35] I'm excited for all of you because when you see it and when you know what it is,

[11:39] you're going to want one as well.

[11:40] And I think Jersey Jack's got a lot of momentum.

[11:43] And I think they're going to be going into the next few years with some home runs.

[11:47] I think some of the older Jersey Jack games are going to lose a lot of value.

[11:50] I do.

[11:50] I saw an Ultraman for $3,500 people, $3,500.

[11:57] And I've been saying this for a while.

[11:59] Stern pros are about to hit the $3,000 to $4,000 range.

[12:04] All of them.

[12:04] I mean it.

[12:05] Like all of them.

[12:06] There is just going to be a collapsing of what the entry level price is going to be in pinball.

[12:12] It's like, you're not going to hold anymore at four or five.

[12:14] It's going to be like $3,500 to get games sold.

[12:18] We're oversaturated.

[12:19] There's too many games out there.

[12:21] And people are out of room.

[12:22] All right.

[12:23] And talk about out of room.

[12:25] I feel like it's going to be a slow month.

[12:27] But stay with it because then it's going to pick up come August, come end of August.

[12:33] We are going to get a lot.

[12:34] Now I am going to come up with other show themes.

[12:36] I'm going to try to do interviews again.

[12:38] You know, I'm going to do more stuff about my dream themes.

[12:41] And I want to talk to more of you about things you want to talk about on this show.

[12:44] And it's going to be great.

[12:45] I'm absolutely looking so forward to the shows that are going to come on Canadian

[12:49] Pinball podcast.

[12:50] Everybody happy Friday.

[12:52] The show is going to be a little bit shorter because I have to do some errands and I have

[12:56] to do some personal family stuff.

[12:58] But everybody be good.

[13:00] Kiss your loved ones.

[13:02] We lost some icons this week.

[13:04] And remember, remember, life is really short.

[13:07] You can't take any of this stuff with you.

[13:10] Any of it, not your pins, not your cars, not your friends, not your family.

[13:14] This is it.

[13:16] This is it.

[13:17] And we've lost a lot of great people recently.

[13:20] But we got to see what happened at the Coldplay concert.

[13:24] And I have to say this.

[13:25] That Coldplay moment was the greatest 10 seconds in the history of internet content.

[13:33] Because in just that 10 seconds, something happened that was real, right?

[13:37] So much is fake out there in the world.

[13:39] But that was real.

[13:41] Like, that was a real reaction to getting caught at a real concert by a real frontman

[13:47] in front of a real crowd.

[13:49] And you were really committing adultery.

[13:51] And everybody in the world could look at that 10 seconds and just say, yeah, we got them.

[13:57] We got them.

[13:58] And everybody can relate.

[14:00] I'm wondering how many office affairs is that going to blow up?

[14:04] Or is that going to empower people and just don't go to Coldplay?

[14:07] But man, it was fun.

[14:08] And also the world loves to watch these beautiful people that are ugly inside.

[14:14] That is what the world loves to watch.

[14:18] We love to eat the rich.

[14:19] We love to see rich people.

[14:21] And we love to get behind the curtain and realize they're just as evil and bad and corrupt

[14:28] as everybody else potentially, right?

[14:30] That's why White Lotus is popular.

[14:33] All of these shows, like if you watch The Waterfront, it's all wealthy people who are absolutely broken inside.

[14:39] But don't be that way.

[14:40] Stay strong.

[14:41] Achigouichi, have some values.

[14:44] Do your training.

[14:45] Eat your vitamins.

[14:47] Say your prayers and be a real American like Hulk Hogan.

[14:50] Later, everybody.
