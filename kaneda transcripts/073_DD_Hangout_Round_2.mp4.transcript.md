[00:00] All right, we're back.

[00:04] It's microphone.

[00:05] It unplugs by mistake, the cable moved,

[00:09] and then it doesn't let you just plug it back in.

[00:11] This is why I don't like YouTube.

[00:13] This never happens on Facebook.

[00:15] I might have to go back to Facebook

[00:17] because it's just easier for me to do my thing

[00:20] and go crazy and flail around the damn joint.

[00:23] But when I get onto YouTube,

[00:29] it's just always trickier.

[00:33] All right, let's share.

[00:35] We're back round two.

[00:36] Kaneda back.

[00:38] I'm like, I just, I feel like there's, you know, again,

[00:42] I just, I don't know.

[00:43] I don't have like, all right, let's, let's hang out now

[00:50] and chat D&D.

[00:52] I'm going to get everybody in here.

[00:53] I don't really have like, you know, I don't know gang.

[01:03] I don't know what to tell you.

[01:04] Like, I think pinball now has become very personal

[01:08] for everybody.

[01:10] I think it's become very personal for everybody.

[01:13] And I think, I don't know.

[01:24] It is a fiasco, Dave Sanders.

[01:26] I don't know any other way to sort of think

[01:30] about modern pinball now other than it's all become,

[01:34] it's all become very personal.

[01:36] I think you're going to warm up to things

[01:41] that you're personally excited about.

[01:44] I think the days of jumping in

[01:48] and just giving a game a whirl isn't really feasible

[01:53] for most people anymore because of how expensive the games

[01:55] are and how much money everyone's lost,

[01:57] who's done that over the last two years.

[02:00] And, you know, I think, I think the hobby is

[02:07] in a precarious place right now.

[02:12] I really do.

[02:13] I think most of you are already in ownership of games.

[02:18] You absolutely love and you don't really need more.

[02:23] And I think this model of three corner zones a year,

[02:26] plus a remake, plus all the games from all the competitors.

[02:31] I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

[02:35] it's like the new golden age of pinball.

[02:38] Like, there's more pinball coming out in the world every year now

[02:42] than there ever was before in the history of pinball.

[02:47] And that should make everybody super excited.

[02:50] I think it's, it's, it's tricky though.

[02:54] I think it's tricky.

[02:55] I think a lot of people now when you look at a game like D&D,

[02:57] you got to ask yourself, like, do I really want it?

[03:01] Do I have room to put it in my game room?

[03:04] And if I know it's not a keeper,

[03:06] then I should absolutely wait and not buy one brand new.

[03:10] That's like the new reality.

[03:12] And I know people don't always want me to talk about this hobby

[03:15] in that way.

[03:17] I don't know, I just don't get crazy excited about themes

[03:21] that don't speak to me because it's just, it's a personal thing.

[03:25] And so I just don't, and here's the thing too, it's like,

[03:30] I think there's a middle ground I do.

[03:34] I think there's themes like Godzilla where like,

[03:36] I'm, you know, I'm not a die hard Godzilla fan,

[03:40] but I can appreciate Godzilla and I can get into Godzilla

[03:45] a heck of a lot easier than I can get into Dungeons and Dragons.

[03:49] You know, D&D is like, it's like next level nerdiness

[03:53] and geekiness.

[03:53] And like, I think it's harder for a lot of people

[03:57] to get into D&D and click with D&D versus a Godzilla,

[04:05] versus, you know, I'm gonna throw out another game like,

[04:08] I think even like Iron Maiden, right?

[04:10] It's like you didn't love Iron Maiden music,

[04:12] but you love the pin.

[04:14] Jurassic Park is way easier for people to jump into it

[04:19] and feel excited about it.

[04:21] So, you know, yeah, like Chase, I, look, I think the game,

[04:26] I think the, I think the under the glass elements

[04:30] of the game look great.

[04:32] I think the cabinet artwork and translight artwork

[04:37] are pretty terrible in my honest opinion.

[04:40] I just, again, they just don't look that great.

[04:43] They might look better in person.

[04:44] It's hard with art.

[04:46] You can always tell via the computer,

[04:50] but they're not popping, you know, from a cabinet standpoint.

[04:54] I don't see the cabinet artwork is not blowing me away.

[04:58] The trans lights are really bad.

[05:01] The playfield art, not really much to speak of, right?

[05:04] I think the mech sort of dominate,

[05:06] but the playfield art itself isn't really incredible.

[05:11] So it's like, I think an A plus in the mech category

[05:15] for Stern, absolutely.

[05:18] Come on gang, like they charged us 13,000 for a John Wick.

[05:24] Okay, so like A plus in the mech department on this game,

[05:30] I think C plus in theme,

[05:36] maybe B minus in theme.

[05:40] Artwork is like a B minus.

[05:44] The code I don't know about, haven't seen it.

[05:48] Again, I just think it's gonna be a game

[05:51] where two hours from now, if you go have a boozy lunch

[05:54] with your friends and you wanna geek out about the new pinball

[05:56] that just came out in the world,

[05:58] and you're like, it's dungeons and dragons,

[06:00] it's not as easy to get everybody excited

[06:03] as if it was something more mainstream.

[06:08] And I just think that's the way it is.

[06:12] I think it's a very interesting pinball year about to hit.

[06:18] I think it's gonna be a buyer's market,

[06:22] and that's a good thing.

[06:23] I think as a pinball buyer,

[06:26] everybody that waits and sees on this game

[06:28] is gonna be, is gonna get one for a better deal.

[06:33] So I'm curious what you guys think.

[06:37] I've been doing a lot of talking, obviously,

[06:39] I'll do some shows about this,

[06:41] and it's nice to sort of absorb a game

[06:44] and think about it a little bit more wake up,

[06:47] hear some of the feedback.

[06:49] I think what's gonna happen is,

[06:51] this reminds me a lot.

[06:54] This stern army is big, man.

[06:56] I think we're gonna see a lot of people say the game is awesome,

[07:01] but they're not gonna buy it.

[07:04] I fully expect that to be the response on Pinside

[07:08] that stern knocked it out of the park,

[07:12] and then if you ask people if you're buying one, they're like,

[07:13] nah.

[07:16] You know, it's weird, right?

[07:17] It's like you can like something,

[07:18] but not want to buy it.

[07:22] So I like this Dungeons & Dragons game, right?

[07:25] I highly prefer this kind of innovation,

[07:31] and this kind of, these kinds of toys,

[07:33] like there's no toys in Avatar.

[07:34] Like I would rather have D&D over Avatar.

[07:39] I think they put more into it, more passion,

[07:42] more creativity.

[07:43] I would rather have this game over Avatar.

[07:46] Now that being said, I don't want to own either

[07:48] because of theme.

[07:50] It's the same way, like I don't want to own an evil dead

[07:52] because of the theme.

[07:53] I get that spooky put so much passion into it,

[07:56] but I just don't want the theme.

[07:59] I think the music is going to be good.

[08:05] I'll spend money on it in location.

[08:08] I don't need to.

[08:09] So let me ask you guys a question.

[08:11] Have any of you seen enough?

[08:15] Have any of you seen enough to say like,

[08:19] I'm in on an Ellie right away?

[08:22] I'm just curious.

[08:24] I'm curious if anybody saw enough to order an Ellie right away.

[08:38] I'm just reading some of my Facebook messages.

[08:48] I don't know.

[08:49] I don't think that's the right thing.

[08:52] I don't know.

[08:53] I don't think people are by-by-by anymore.

[08:57] I don't think that's the vibe anymore

[09:00] of the pinball community.

[09:01] I don't think that's the vibe anymore on pinside.

[09:04] I actually don't get that vibe.

[09:07] I don't even hear Zach say bye-bye-bye much anymore.

[09:11] I don't feel like that is a good,

[09:16] sort of advice anymore for people.

[09:18] I'm happy the reveal was early

[09:20] because now I get to go take my beautiful wife

[09:22] and her sister, beautiful sister as well.

[09:24] Sarah's probably hearing this to a lunch.

[09:27] We can go and get lunch earlier.

[09:28] I thought this was gonna be later in the day.

[09:32] What's up, Sarah?

[09:34] You're welcome.

[09:37] You know, man, we might find you a boyfriend,

[09:40] slash husband, slash visa, slash green card, slash.

[09:46] Come on gentlemen.

[09:47] Let me tell you what's better than D&D.

[09:50] Authenic off the boat Irish woman

[09:56] who's pretty with a great heart, who's a nutritionist,

[09:59] who's a doctor, is a doctor, a doctor.

[10:04] You know what she doesn't play, dungeons and dragons?

[10:07] Doesn't play dungeons and dragons.

[10:15] I mean, I don't, Kevin Smith on callouts or sweet,

[10:19] I don't care who's doing the callouts guys.

[10:21] I know it like yeah, the calls are gonna be great.

[10:23] The calls are gonna be great.

[10:26] I think the, I don't see much I don't like in this game.

[10:32] I just don't see most of you wanting to own it.

[10:38] To understand the two things can be true.

[10:41] Stern could have crushed making a great D&D game

[10:46] which is I think they did.

[10:48] But it's a D&D game.

[10:50] It's the same way spooky made an amazing evil dead game.

[10:54] But it's an evil dead game.

[10:56] And with Harry Potter, with King Kong,

[11:02] with you know, a lot more emotionally,

[11:06] like exciting themes coming.

[11:10] I just worry if you buy this game this week,

[11:16] I can already see D&D Ellie's for $9,999.

[11:21] I can already see it like inbox, inbox when King Kong comes out.

[11:28] But it's like, it's weird to me because it's like,

[11:30] it's not a good game for a bar or for location

[11:33] because you can't hear it.

[11:36] You know what I'm saying?

[11:37] Like how is that good for a bar location?

[11:40] Like I don't know like role playing games.

[11:43] You need to hear it.

[11:44] You need to be immersed in it

[11:46] and you can't have distractions.

[11:49] I don't think D&D is good for location.

[11:55] That's why you play D&D like in your basement

[12:00] where there's not many distractions.

[12:13] Yeah, I don't know.

[12:15] I don't know.

[12:16] Look, I don't know how the market's going to respond.

[12:20] I mean, I like reacting to how the market responds.

[12:23] I'm curious to go to Pinsai now.

[12:25] Let's just go to Pinsai now and see what people are saying.

[12:28] Hold on.

[12:29] Hold on.

[12:30] I do think the, again, I think the hype flame on this is

[12:34] the same thing.

[12:35] I'm not going to respond.

[12:37] I'm not going to respond.

[12:39] I'm not going to respond.

[12:41] Again, I think the hype flame on this is going to burn out pretty quick.

[12:46] I think people are going to say it's amazing, but they're not going to order.

[12:55] I'll read you some Pinsai stuff right now.

[12:57] Let's see this.

[12:59] Love what they love what they did with the voice acting,

[13:02] but they didn't license their characters or anything really didn't want

[13:07] didn't want this to be a critical role theme, whatever that means.

[13:12] In on an LE, okay, here we go.

[13:15] Dream theme and they had me at the gelatinous cube.

[13:19] Code won't be for everyone, but my jaw dropped

[13:22] at each code feature.

[13:24] Yeah, I mean, I think if you're a D&D fanatic,

[13:28] you're gonna love this game.

[13:31] All right, I've never played Dungeons and Dragons,

[13:34] but this machine seems like it could be a nice combination

[13:38] of good layout and code making it a fun game.

[13:42] Yep, I agree.

[13:44] The pro appears to be missing some kind of diverter.

[13:48] Feed the dragon.

[13:50] All right, not sure about that.

[13:51] What would it rare heroes say?

[13:53] It's a randomizer.

[13:55] Okay, I don't even wanna talk about randomizers.

[13:58] So once again, in five seconds, my question becomes

[14:01] the dragon spits out pinballs,

[14:02] but you can't shoot balls into its mouth.

[14:06] And then it immediately becomes a question

[14:07] of whether the pro is good enough.

[14:10] When a stern is, when is stern going to quit

[14:13] with the bomb BS formula and make a real multi-functioning main mech?

[14:19] They love bash toys.

[14:21] Okay, I don't know what that guy's complaining about.

[14:25] Here we go.

[14:26] This is the random generator could use the date

[14:29] of the most recent Sunday to see things.

[14:32] Then it would just require the clock to be set right.

[14:37] Early take looks really good to me.

[14:39] I'm really like the new dungeons each week

[14:41] and the key features like buying gear

[14:44] and saving progress and there too.

[14:46] One thing I'm disappointed with is only four classes

[14:50] and not being able to customize your character.

[14:54] Ideally, you should be able to pick a race species and gender

[14:59] and it would be really cool to display your character

[15:01] with whatever new gear you unlock.

[15:03] Well, that would be awesome,

[15:05] but sounds like a nightmare for them on the code size.

[15:10] It's all about the code for me on this one.

[15:12] Someone said, art package looks great on all,

[15:15] see, this is why I don't get,

[15:17] this is the, I don't think the art package looks great

[15:20] on all models, okay.

[15:22] All right.

[15:23] Frances in the house.

[15:26] I love the Pimbal nerds are suggesting no one plays nerdy D&D.

[15:34] There is a massive market for this.

[15:36] There's not gang.

[15:40] There's not a massive market for this pin.

[15:44] And do you really think people that play dungeons and dragons?

[15:49] You know what they don't play as Pimbal?

[15:53] And just because there's a Pimbal version of D&D

[15:57] does not equal a massive market for this game.

[16:04] I really think some of you don't understand how marketing works

[16:08] and how crossover works with fan bases.

[16:13] You're absolutely wrong that there's a massive mark.

[16:18] It's not massive.

[16:20] This game is not going to sell massive amounts

[16:22] because of the theme.

[16:25] So because the majority of Pimbal buying people

[16:29] are not D&D fanatics.

[16:31] And when you don't give the majority of Pimbal buying people

[16:36] a theme that they massively want,

[16:39] then you won't get massive sales.

[16:44] I don't know why this is always hard for people

[16:45] to understand.

[16:48] I really don't.

[16:49] See, you know, like, will this open up Pimbal

[16:52] to a whole massive new group of people?

[16:54] No, no.

[16:57] Let me tell you what happened when Guns and Roses,

[16:59] let me tell you what happened.

[17:00] There are more Guns and Roses fans in the world,

[17:03] probably than D&D fans.

[17:06] And when Guns and Roses Pimbal came out,

[17:09] you know what the conversation was

[17:11] on all the Guns and Roses forums and fan pages,

[17:15] where all the fans hang out.

[17:16] You know what it was?

[17:18] How ridiculously priced the game was.

[17:21] Nobody crossed over and bought it.

[17:26] So I think you guys are like at a touch

[17:28] with where the average American is financially,

[17:33] where the average nerd and geek is financially

[17:36] who plays a game like D&D.

[17:39] The average video game or out there

[17:42] can enjoy the best in video game

[17:45] for just a few hundred bucks.

[17:48] I think so many of you think that people

[17:51] just wake up one day and want to spend $7 to $13,000

[17:57] on a Pimbal machine.

[17:59] You're so out of touch.

[18:02] It's almost comical that if you think D&D opens them up

[18:08] to a massive new audience.

[18:12] And I really do love this conversation

[18:15] because this is like the wheelhouse I'm in,

[18:18] is that I get it.

[18:20] Right, John Wick is a $2 billion movie franchise.

[18:24] Did it open up Stern Pimbal to a massive new audience

[18:28] for Pimbal?

[18:34] To me, this game will sell to where there is

[18:38] existing crossover,

[18:41] where same thing with Evil Dead,

[18:43] it's gonna sell where there is existing crossover.

[18:48] Fans of the theme and fans of Pimbal

[18:53] kinda need to be both to buy a new inbox game

[18:58] that is in this realm.

[19:01] And I think that that is okay.

[19:05] I think it's a lot easier for spooky to navigate

[19:09] a theme that's nerdy like Evil Dead.

[19:13] I think for Stern, we'll see how it goes.

[19:15] I don't know how it goes gang.

[19:16] Like I don't know, like they're gonna sell out

[19:18] of the LEDs on their website.

[19:21] They're gonna sell through to every distributor.

[19:23] We're gonna get early reports that it's selling great.

[19:27] Don't believe that because that's just distros

[19:30] who ordered all their allotment.

[19:32] And it's just like again, like I don't know,

[19:35] but I will follow it all, but I'm telling you right now,

[19:38] this does not open up Pimbal to a massive new audience.

[19:42] See, this is why you guys are like,

[19:44] I don't think you get it.

[19:46] Like you do understand that Barbie would outsell

[19:48] D&D five to one.

[19:51] Do you get that?

[19:53] A Barbie Pimbal machine would actually open you up

[19:58] to new audiences.

[19:59] It would outsell this game five to one.

[20:03] Easily, easily.

[20:06] The amount of executives with daughters that love Barbie

[20:10] that also grew up as gamers would put one in their home.

[20:14] Barbie would outsell D&D five to one.

[20:17] Probably eight to one.

[20:19] Gotta be honest, eight to one.

[20:21] A Barbie Ellie would sell out instantly.

[20:27] A wicked Pimbal machine, right?

[20:29] Wicked.

[20:31] It would outsell D&D five to one.

[20:33] Maybe not wicked.

[20:35] I take that back.

[20:36] I walked that way back.

[20:44] I don't know, guys, I just, I just think you sometimes,

[20:51] I think crossover is collectors don't,

[20:55] collectors of an IP don't start collecting

[20:59] the Pimbal version of the thing.

[21:10] So,

[21:14] of course Titanic would outsell this.

[21:23] So look, look, game, game.

[21:26] I hope you run until everybody,

[21:28] Canada, I like this game.

[21:31] I think it's turned into a great job

[21:33] on this Dungeons and Dragons game.

[21:36] I can't wait to play it.

[21:38] I don't know how to recommend buying one new in box,

[21:41] though, unless you're a dot,

[21:43] look, if you're a die hard D&D fan and a fan of Pimbal,

[21:46] of course you're going to want to buy this.

[21:48] Of course, you're probably going to want to buy an Ellie.

[21:50] And of course you should buy an Ellie.

[21:53] If you're a D&D fanatic, buy an Ellie

[21:58] because you're never going to sell it

[22:01] and you should have the nicest version of the thing you love.

[22:05] That's why I own a Guns and Roses CE.

[22:08] I get it.

[22:09] I get, I get all the reasons why people

[22:11] don't like that game.

[22:14] It's my favorite band.

[22:16] And I want to own the nicest version of the thing I love.

[22:20] I played it today for an hour.

[22:23] I loved playing every minute of it.

[22:25] I encourage you if you're a D&D fanatic, go get an Ellie.

[22:31] But if you're not a D&D fanatic and you just want to have the next

[22:34] Stern Ellie because you have a lineup and you think somehow like having an

[22:39] Ellie is a flex move, which it's not anymore.

[22:42] You're going to lose $3,000 if you go to move it on

[22:46] because you don't really care that much about the property.

[22:49] To me, that's where modern pinball is at.

[22:51] It's not a, it's just, it's just where we're at.

[22:55] It's not a negative.

[22:56] It's just the reality of where modern pinball is.

[23:02] How are you guys feeling right now?

[23:06] I wouldn't fly to Stern pinball to play this game.

[23:10] You know, I didn't get invited.

[23:12] I don't care.

[23:12] I'll play it when it gets to automate it.

[23:15] I don't think this is a game where I'm going to need to do a Raffle.

[23:18] There's 740 LEs

[23:22] because D&D was founded in 1974.

[23:27] I look, I still get the sense this is a little bit of a, like, I don't, I don't know.

[23:30] I don't think you can use the term filler game.

[23:33] You know, when Brian Eddie is making a game, like he's not approaching it.

[23:37] Like he's a filler.

[23:39] You know, he's not just keeping the crowd happy until L one takes the stage.

[23:44] He's, he's, he's doing everything he can to make the best possible game he can.

[23:49] So I think using the term filler game is, is disrespectful for all the men and women

[23:54] who worked hard on this game.

[23:56] It's not a filler game.

[23:58] I think it's a pretty damn awesome D&D game.

[24:03] But it's still a D&D game.

[24:06] You know,

[24:08] like I'm an amazing podcaster, but I'm still a pinball podcaster.

[24:13] If I was a podcaster about true crime, I'd be a millionaire.

[24:17] If I was a podcaster about politics or life, I'd be very wealthy.

[24:24] I'm a pinball podcaster.

[24:28] You know, I'm saying big difference.

[24:30] This is a great game, but it's a D&D game.

[24:38] You know,

[24:45] pro, you know, it's crazy about all these modern sturns is, is, is the pro is the best buy.

[24:59] You know, the pro is the smart purchase because the pro will lose the most, sorry,

[25:05] the pro will lose the least amount of money.

[25:08] The Ellie is twice the price of the pro.

[25:10] That's stupid.

[25:13] You know, you won't have twice as much fun playing D&D, Ellie as you will D&D pro.

[25:22] But we all like that.

[25:24] You know, thanks Roy.

[25:25] I mean, look, I, I love doing this.

[25:27] So, you know, I'm happy to be here on a day off, giving you guys content.

[25:32] How long do you think the weekly game change will last?

[25:36] Well, here's the thing Jason, I think the randomizer, you know, like, think about it.

[25:42] Like if they have 20 different pathways and they randomize it, I think every Sunday,

[25:51] they, you know, there, there could be thousands of different combinations of how they

[25:57] randomize the game.

[25:58] So I, I could see it just being like for years.

[26:05] I don't, because I don't think it's going to be that rewarding because I think you'll

[26:09] just get used to what's behind those doors, because I don't think they're going to change

[26:13] what's behind the door very often.

[26:15] But the order by which you experience things will be what gets randomized.

[26:22] So I think that's how it's going to work.

[26:25] I don't know.

[26:26] I, gang, I knew I wasn't buying this game going in.

[26:29] I'm not negative on it.

[26:31] I hope you don't think I'm negative on it.

[26:33] I just, I feel bad for Dwight and, and, and, and Brian and the team over there, because I just think

[26:39] if this game is 8,500 for an LE and 7,200 for a premium and

[26:46] 59, 99 for a pro or 55, I just think if the prices were just more reasonable,

[26:52] I think we all look at this stuff with a lot more enthusiasm and, and, and that's just the way it is now.

[27:04] Thank you.

[27:06] You know, I, I think this is a really great effort on this pin.

[27:11] I think, uh, evil dead was a great effort.

[27:14] I think we're getting a lot of really awesome pins based on themes that are a little bit obscure

[27:20] for the, for the mainstream.

[27:23] And, and when that changes is, is Harry Potter, uh, back to the future,

[27:28] goonies, I think that changes with, uh, you know,

[27:34] King Kong is much more mainstream.

[27:37] So, you know, I think, um, but there's something for everybody.

[27:41] There's something for everybody and, and it's really a good time to be in pinball.

[27:45] I mean, we got tells of the Arabian nights is coming back.

[27:48] So in a pinball world in which there's so many options now, uh, you know, I,

[27:55] here's the thing with Stern, like I'm never worried about those guys because, you know, in the end,

[28:01] in the end, if, if, let's just say like they, they projected this game to sell,

[28:09] I don't know, you know, let's say four to 5,000 units and it comes up short, right?

[28:14] It comes up at like 2,800 or 3,000 units.

[28:20] And then they just remake Ghostbusters and sell 5,000 of them.

[28:24] You know, when I think about Stern, the, the, the catalog they have,

[28:30] and their ability to go back for future sales is, is uncanny.

[28:37] Like nobody else can do what they can do.

[28:39] Like, they're sitting on, like, think about it.

[28:42] Like they're sitting on titles that don't even require any development, just rerun them and

[28:51] rerun Lord of the Rings and sell 5,000 more of them with new artwork.

[28:58] Right?

[28:59] Easily easily rerun Tron, new artwork on the LCD screen better, better lighting, better sound,

[29:11] easily.

[29:13] Batman, right?

[29:16] Batman, 60th anniversary edition of Batman.

[29:19] Great, games, great.

[29:21] One of the greatest coded games of all time, one of the most fun pinball machines,

[29:25] you know, they fixed the clunk on the later editions of that game.

[29:29] Stern is like, the thing about Stern is like, like, it's all the answers are there.

[29:36] And the fact that they've got all these great titles in the portfolio,

[29:41] they're going to give us three cornerstones a year.

[29:44] Some are going to be juggernauts.

[29:47] Some are going to be like this.

[29:48] Look, gang, you know this game, this game is going to end up in the realm of Avengers,

[29:55] in the realm of John Wick, in the realm of Venom.

[30:00] Like that, that this is not going to be a, a triple A seller for Stern.

[30:07] It's not, it's not, it's just not.

[30:10] Like it's just the theme, the theme is not there for this thing to move.

[30:17] The code and the way you play this game is not going to be of mass appeal.

[30:23] It's not.

[30:27] It's just not going to be that way.

[30:33] No, this is, this isn't going to be a great on location game.

[30:38] This is a game you're going to not, why would you want this on locate?

[30:41] You're going to go back to your bar every Sunday for the randomizer.

[30:44] No, this is, this is a game much like Dungeons and Dragons is not played at Jack Bar.

[30:51] D&D has played in your basement.

[30:54] If it's played at all, I don't think this is a game for location play.

[30:58] I think Venom's easier to jump on it and pick up where you left off.

[31:04] I don't think this game is going to be nearly as rewarding to play on location as Venom.

[31:11] So I look, I think this is a great game for a nerdy D&D pinball fanatic who can now geek out in pinball form.

[31:21] The theme they love so much in D&D.

[31:25] And I want to give Stern credit for the mechanisms.

[31:28] I think the call outs are going to be phenomenal.

[31:30] I think the music is going to be phenomenal.

[31:32] I think the artwork is, and the reason the artwork is, is because we've just been spoiled with such good artwork lately in pinball.

[31:42] And in comparison to evil dead or X-Men or, you know, zombie Yeti stuff and franchy stuff.

[31:49] I don't, I don't think this like elevates any of that.

[31:53] But it does fit the theme.

[31:54] I, you know, it's, you know, it's missing from me in this or it just doesn't feel fun like the Capcom D&D art.

[32:01] I just wish it was a little bit more fun and campy.

[32:03] It feels a little bit like serious and I don't know.

[32:06] My name is what they're going for.

[32:08] So.

[32:14] Remind me a lot of smog, you know, smog, smog.

[32:18] The only thing I wish the dragon had did, I wish the mouth when it, when it talked.

[32:24] I wish it moved the way smog's mouth moved up and down to simulate.

[32:30] The callouts and when the dragon is talking to you and taunting you, I didn't get that sense that it was the mouth was actually moving with the words.

[32:40] Not sure if that's going to be how it is in the final edition or not, but I didn't get that sense.

[32:44] I just want to say something.

[32:58] Gang again, like I, you know, someone's just saying Jason was talking about a D&D location.

[33:03] It's, it's, it's, it's really hard.

[33:09] On a new pin launch.

[33:11] To not look at it in a vacuum.

[33:14] Right, we're used to that, right?

[33:15] You get into this like tunnel vision of this is the game.

[33:20] Oh my gosh, there's only 740.

[33:22] Oh my gosh, half are going to Europe.

[33:24] Oh my gosh, that means only, you know, 370 in America.

[33:31] Oh my gosh, I got to order one now.

[33:32] Oh my gosh, if I don't get one, I'm not going to get one.

[33:35] Oh my gosh, they're going to be selling for over all that's over with.

[33:38] You now have to learn how to zoom out and look at the reality.

[33:43] The majority of these $13,000 LEs are selling for less than $10,000 with any year.

[33:51] New inbox people.

[33:53] New inbox.

[33:56] Every single game now is losing money unless it's a remake of an old classic or it was designed by Keith L.

[34:03] When every single game.

[34:06] The only, again, I'm just looking at the data, the only games that have preserved value are Keith L.

[34:14] In games and remakes of classics.

[34:18] Nothing else.

[34:19] Nothing, not James Bond, not food fighters, not venom, not John Wick, nothing, nothing, nothing else.

[34:28] I don't like the Ellie at all in this game.

[34:30] I don't like the red armor.

[34:32] I don't like the artwork on the right side, which is the side.

[34:37] I think most of us usually see in our game rooms.

[34:40] I don't like the translate.

[34:42] I don't like the fact that the team holding and the armor don't match.

[34:45] I don't like anything about the Ellie of this game.

[34:48] I'm going to be candid here.

[34:50] I don't think I've seen an Ellie in a long time that has made me feel so underwhelmed in its Ellie trim.

[34:57] I think Metallica Ellie remastered was epic.

[35:01] I think this is it.

[35:02] This Ellie just does not scream.

[35:05] You need this Ellie.

[35:06] I thought X-Men Ellie was phenomenal.

[35:09] I thought Jaws Ellie was phenomenal.

[35:12] But this Ellie just does.

[35:14] This feels like John Wick Ellie.

[35:16] If I had it, like it just feels like, ah, yeah, whatever.

[35:19] You know, like, like no one who has a D&D Ellie, I think is going to have a flexworthy item.

[35:25] That is like, wow, you got how'd you get one?

[35:28] I'm never going to happen.

[35:31] I think the pro is probably going to be the game that is just good enough, right?

[35:43] It's good enough.

[35:44] You're going to get most of the code, most of everything.

[35:48] Our other podcast was shilling this release.

[35:50] I don't know.

[35:51] Hey, gang.

[35:52] Can we all can we all vote in the trippies now for Canadian Spinball podcast?

[35:56] I think that happened today.

[35:59] Um, does anyone have a link to it?

[36:01] Let me give you a link right now.

[36:03] It'd be great if each and every one of you could vote for Canada in the 2024 twippies.

[36:12] You know, I love the win a twippy.

[36:14] Um, let's see.

[36:16] Where's my.

[36:18] Now, why is it?

[36:19] Okay, here we go.

[36:22] I'm going to give you guys the link.

[36:24] Now, I think it's live.

[36:26] I was talking to Colin about this earlier.

[36:32] Enter your pen to restore it.

[36:35] Okay, here we go.

[36:39] All right, here we go.

[36:44] All right, let's do this.

[36:49] There's the twippies.

[36:56] I do not have plans to go to the twippies.

[37:02] It is $80 a ticket.

[37:05] Look, I'm going to be again.

[37:07] I'm going to be candy gang.

[37:10] I'm going to be candy gang.

[37:12] If you want Canadian to come to the twippies,

[37:16] you want me to go to wormhole.

[37:19] And you want me to like be there.

[37:24] Like, you know, this new twippies, new plays, new format.

[37:27] And like, it's not like it's not part of TPS.

[37:30] So it's not like there's all this extra stuff going on.

[37:33] I get that there's a tour of barrels of fun.

[37:35] I do not care.

[37:36] Why would I want to go to barrels of fun?

[37:37] Let me let me let me be honest here.

[37:39] Why would I want to go to barrels of fun?

[37:42] Right now, when the only thing they'll show me is how they make labyrinth.

[37:50] That's it.

[37:52] Why would I want to go do a tour of a company making a theme I could care less about?

[37:58] I get it.

[37:59] I get it.

[38:00] I've seen pinball assembly lines.

[38:01] I get it.

[38:02] I don't mean to be Larry David, but I've seen it before.

[38:05] I get it.

[38:06] Like, there's a line.

[38:07] Yep.

[38:08] You put that in.

[38:09] You put that in.

[38:10] I get it.

[38:11] I don't care to see how the sausage is made.

[38:14] I don't.

[38:16] So, you know, if they want to, if they want to invite me to the twippies and.

[38:22] You know, and fly me out there.

[38:24] I'll, I'll make an appearance, but I'm not spending my own money anymore in this stuff.

[38:28] I'm just not doing it.

[38:30] I'm not doing it.

[38:33] It's just the way I, it's just the way I can eat a rolls.

[38:36] Now that being said, I, I, I definitely want to win.

[38:39] I'm not going to be able to do it.

[38:41] I'm not going to be able to do it.

[38:43] Let's look at this ballot here.

[38:45] Content.

[38:46] Let me tell, let me see if you guys can see this.

[38:48] Can you guys, let me, let me try and share screen.

[38:51] Um, all right.

[38:53] I'm going to share.

[38:55] Can you guys see when I'm, when I'm scrolling through here?

[38:59] Can you see all that?

[39:00] I'm scrolling up and down.

[39:02] Let me know if it's black or you can see it.

[39:04] Do you see me scrolling?

[39:05] It's black.

[39:07] It's like sometimes it's black.

[39:09] Let's try again.

[39:10] Oh wait, hold on.

[39:11] How about now?

[39:15] Can you see it now?

[39:18] Can you see me scrolling here?

[39:26] Can you, can you see this scrolling up and down?

[39:30] I'm up and down right now.

[39:35] Okay.

[40:31] I'm just going to put in myself.

[40:34] Break out content creator.

[40:37] Am I in breakout?

[40:40] No.

[40:41] All right.

[40:42] I'm going to vote for breakout.

[40:44] Dude, where's my code?

[40:49] I'm going to give Vic the breakout award.

[41:11] I'm going to vote for myself, gang.

[41:13] I'm just that kind of guy.

[41:15] Wait.

[41:17] Wait.

[41:18] I'm not on streamer.

[41:19] What am I doing right now?

[41:22] How is this not a video content?

[41:24] How am I not streaming right now?

[41:27] Like what?

[41:28] I don't understand.

[41:29] I do live streams every week.

[41:33] And I'm not even eligible.

[41:38] What?

[41:39] What?

[41:40] How am I not eligible for streamer?

[41:47] It doesn't say streaming gameplay.

[41:50] Carry hard.

[41:51] You doesn't stream gameplay.

[41:55] Like, like Todd Tucky doesn't stream gameplay.

[42:02] I don't understand.

[42:06] Most of these guys do not stream gameplay.

[42:13] I'm going to give it to my boy Todd.

[42:17] I'm going to give it to carry.

[42:21] And third content.

[42:26] I mean, wait.

[42:32] Wait.

[42:33] What's going on here?

[42:40] I say I went up.

[42:44] Am I in content?

[42:47] No.

[42:49] Who should be third?

[42:55] No, no.

[42:56] I'm not in content.

[43:00] I'm not in content.

[43:06] No, no, but I wasn't in content.

[43:09] See, I'm in content now.

[43:11] Video content streamer.

[43:12] I'm not in there.

[43:13] Where?

[43:14] Is it not alphabetical?

[43:17] I don't see canada in.

[43:27] I'm going to give the third place.

[43:31] You know, because I think they do a great job.

[43:34] The flipping out stream.

[43:35] Best publication.

[43:38] Naps are kid.

[43:43] I mean, I feel like this is where it gets personal.

[43:50] Nudge and con.

[43:53] I'll give you third place vote.

[43:57] You brought the awards back.

[44:00] Game of the year.

[44:01] I'm going to show you guys all my picks.

[44:04] Oh, Jack Danger.

[44:06] Where?

[44:10] I didn't see Jack Danger.

[44:12] Jack Danger.

[44:13] What's up, brother?

[44:14] I didn't see Jack.

[44:16] Game of the year is going to be JAWS.

[44:20] Second place.

[44:22] Is barbecue challenge.

[44:25] I don't want to do second place.

[44:28] I think it's I just want to make.

[44:31] I just want to give.

[44:34] Innovation of the year.

[44:35] What does that mean?

[44:37] What is the innovation?

[44:40] Does this make sense?

[44:43] It says innovation of the year.

[44:47] And then it just has the title of the game.

[44:52] But what is the innovation?

[44:57] I don't I don't understand.

[45:00] They should have listed out.

[45:03] What the innovation was.

[45:06] I'm going to vote for innovation of the year.

[45:09] Oh, wait, there are wait.

[45:12] This is what I there is the innovation here.

[45:15] What am I I'm like sorry.

[45:17] My eyes are not working.

[45:19] The battle.

[45:20] Pandora.

[45:21] I guess the scram is the innovation.

[45:23] I thought.

[45:24] Okay.

[45:25] Okay.

[45:26] So we've got the innovations here.

[45:27] So JAWS flip lock.

[45:28] JAWS.

[45:29] The revenge challenge mode.

[45:32] I mean, that's a code.

[45:33] That's not really okay.

[45:34] I mean, I'm going to go with the

[45:36] Danger Room.

[45:37] The Danger Room.

[45:38] I mean, I'm going to go with the Danger Room as the

[45:41] Innovation.

[45:42] And then I'm going to do JAWS the revenge is number two.

[45:45] Jackson, I voted for you.

[45:46] You hang out here.

[45:47] You get a vote.

[45:48] I do think the Danger Room out of all those unique stuff is

[45:52] the most unique thing that was put in a pinball machine this

[45:54] year.

[45:55] Best theme integration.

[45:57] Is JAWS.

[45:58] I'm going to vote for you.

[46:00] You hang out here.

[46:01] You get a vote.

[46:02] And then I'm going to vote for you.

[46:04] So the game is JAWS.

[46:05] Best game launch reveal.

[46:08] Man, the avatar video was really good.

[46:12] Let me see.

[46:14] Do they even have see they should have put evil dead?

[46:18] We got this is what's so stupid.

[46:20] Like guys, these guys don't make sense.

[46:22] They don't make any sense.

[46:23] So, okay.

[46:24] I'm going to I'm going to go off on a tangent here.

[46:27] How can you have best game reveal?

[46:30] And not include evil dead.

[46:33] Like, like evil dead was launched and revealed.

[46:38] So, like, it doesn't matter if the game's shipped or not.

[46:42] That's not going to change the way the game was launched or revealed.

[46:46] My friends over at the Trippy Committee.

[46:49] Like, stop smoking that dude.

[46:51] But like guys, you need to stop making common sense of

[48:20] I don't.

[48:21] I don't know enough about any of those games.

[48:23] I don't think any of those games had a real improvement.

[48:31] You know, bad to good.

[48:32] Like, they didn't they don't have.

[48:33] They only had James Bond 60th.

[53:52] Like, I don't like voting on that.

[53:54] Okay, I'm gonna smit my ballot.

[53:56] Oh my God.

[53:58] What is this?

[53:59] I think there's a little motorcycle there.

[54:02] Is that, is that gonna verify me?

[54:06] All right, I'm gonna have to go back.

[54:09] I'm gonna have to go back.

[54:11] That was, that was a little painful.

[54:16] There's too much.

[54:18] I told him there's too many categories.

[54:20] It should be on the games.

[54:21] There's too much outside of the games.

[54:24] There's too much stuff that I don't have an opinion about.

[54:27] There's too many, you know, Jamie, Aaron and Ralph,

[54:31] you guys, like you put too much in there.

[54:33] Like I'm sorry, but like, what do you mean

[54:35] community member of the year?

[54:36] Like what is like, I don't understand.

[54:38] Like I don't want to vote.

[54:39] I don't even, like, I don't feel like anyone on that list

[54:42] deserves not to win.

[54:43] Like I just, it's like then you're just,

[54:45] you're handing out participation awards

[54:47] when you're not handing out stuff that like,

[54:50] like I get, like I, I skipped like 10 things

[54:54] that I'm still, I feel like I just went 10 rounds

[54:58] with Tyson, like it just too much.

[55:02] Too much, but that being said, go vote for her,

[55:04] or you can go vote for her, or you can go vote for her.

[55:07] I don't know, right?

[55:08] It's just like, yeah, and like they should add photos

[55:14] and like explain what these people did.

[55:16] Like there's nothing, nothing.

[55:19] Like the, I don't know, like the excitement of like the logos

[55:23] of the games and the excitement of like the podcast,

[55:26] content creator logos, all that.

[55:28] It just feels very like it, it's like you're voting

[55:31] on a spreadsheet, not on real life.

[55:35] Anyway, gang, wow, we actually made it

[55:38] like another hour on this like round two.

[55:40] I'm gonna go get some lunch or cocktail,

[55:44] got a nice dinner with Brenda tonight.

[55:47] I've already sort of, I'm already sort of over D&D

[55:50] as just like a, I don't know, I just, again,

[55:53] like I need to see more, but I get,

[55:56] it's just like, I feel good that it doesn't make me want to,

[56:01] it doesn't make me want to own it

[56:03] because the theme is not for me.

[56:04] And that's, and I need that.

[56:06] My finances need that.

[56:09] I'm happy this is not Akira, Fifth Element,

[56:12] Transformers G1, the movie.

[56:13] I'm happy this is not die hard,

[56:16] this is not Christmas vacation.

[56:17] I'm happy this is not Goonies, this is not,

[56:20] you know, this is not Bloodsport, this is not,

[56:22] again, I'm just naming things I would love to have.

[56:24] It's not Top Gun, it's not Cobra Kai,

[56:27] it's not Karate Kid, it's not, you know,

[56:31] it's just, it's not something that I just grew up watching

[56:35] or loving or needing something of in Pimball form.

[56:41] I don't, I just don't understand voting for all three spots.

[56:47] I don't, like, I've got my favorites and I got my favorites.

[56:50] Like, I don't wanna, like, I don't wanna see my favorite lose

[56:53] because I gave more votes towards number two.

[56:56] You know, the reason they put that in their gang.

[56:58] You know, you know the reason why they did the weighted voting.

[57:00] It was to try to get Kaneda to lose for once.

[57:03] That's it.

[57:08] All right, everybody, be good, chat soon.

[57:11] Thanks for hanging out.

[57:13] This, as in Dave Sanders' terminology,

[57:16] this was in a bombination today,

[57:19] Kaneda trying to figure out this technology.

[57:21] But I did buy a $26 Dungeons and Dragons T-shirt at the mall.

[57:26] So that's as much money as I'm willing to invest in D&D.

[57:30] I know, I know, later, everybody.
