[00:00] You're so brave!

[00:03] You probably think this song is about you,

[00:07] You're so brave!

[00:08] You're so brave!

[00:10] I bet you think this song is about you,

[00:14] Don't you, don't you!

[00:23] Ah, welcome to Episode 6 of The Canadian Club,

[00:26] where I get to hang out with my biggest fans.

[00:29] My contributors, thank you so much everybody.

[00:31] We are at 125 contributors on Patreon.

[00:36] There are more on PayPal.

[00:37] And I want to thank each and every one of you.

[00:39] And that's why I love doing these episodes more

[00:42] than even my main show.

[00:43] Because I'm even a little bit more candid,

[00:45] a little bit more honest.

[00:47] And I want to just talk to you as if you're sitting

[00:49] in my living room and we're discussing Pimball

[00:51] and we're having a good time.

[00:52] So let's talk on this episode about one topic.

[00:55] And the topic I want to talk about

[00:57] is who's to blame for the Pimball prices these days.

[01:02] And if you go nowhere more than just eBay

[01:05] or the marketplace on Pint side,

[01:08] the Pimball prices are astronomical.

[01:12] It's out of this world.

[01:13] This used to be a hobby.

[01:15] I bet when most of us got into this hobby,

[01:18] one of the attractive things,

[01:19] Pins were always expensive,

[01:21] but one of the attractive things

[01:23] was if you wanted a Pimball machine

[01:24] and you wanted three nice machines,

[01:26] it might cost you like $18,000,

[01:29] maybe $20,000 for three really nice machines.

[01:34] And it wasn't a hassle to get them.

[01:35] And I know for some of you listening right now,

[01:37] you're like, Chris, you're crazy.

[01:38] When I got into Pimball,

[01:40] I could get an Adam's family, a Twilight Zone,

[01:43] a World Win, a Toad Inn.

[01:45] I could get each of these machines

[01:46] for like $1,500 or $2,000 back in the 90s.

[01:50] Yes, but I wasn't in this hobby in the 90s

[01:53] and neither were you.

[01:54] And the most money people would ever spend on a machine

[01:57] was like a medieval madness restored by high end Pins

[02:01] and you'd be spending at most like $15,000,

[02:06] but that was like, they're never making anymore

[02:08] and this game is better than new.

[02:10] But I'm looking at prices now

[02:11] and I'm looking at games that nobody wanted a year ago.

[02:14] Now all of a sudden,

[02:16] Yellow brick road, Wizard of Oz went from being

[02:18] in $11,500 joke.

[02:21] Like I was there.

[02:23] I was at T-P-F when Jersey Jack himself got up

[02:27] and announced another edition of Wizard of Oz

[02:30] in which they were removing stuff from the game

[02:33] and then charging more money.

[02:35] And that game sat for a year.

[02:38] Nobody wanted it, $11,500.

[02:42] Now people are listing them for sale for $16,000,

[02:46] for $18,000.

[02:48] Willie Wonka CE, collector's edition, right?

[02:50] There was a distributor who was sitting on 35 games,

[02:55] new inbox, right?

[02:55] 35 games and nobody wanted them for an entire year.

[03:00] They sat and they were what, $12,500, right?

[03:04] COVID hits.

[03:05] Then all of a sudden people realized

[03:06] they're not making more Willie Wonka's

[03:08] because they're making guns and roses

[03:10] and everyone runs and buys them in like a week or two.

[03:13] Why did the game get any better?

[03:15] No, it didn't.

[03:17] The game wasn't any better.

[03:18] The game is still, I believe, a total miss,

[03:21] but now all of a sudden people are clamoring for it.

[03:24] And now if you want one, I'm looking at Pinside.

[03:27] It's $14,000, $15,000.

[03:30] What is going on people?

[03:32] And then I'm looking over at spooky Pimball

[03:34] the last couple weeks.

[03:35] They don't even show gameplay.

[03:36] Sold out, 1,750 games.

[03:39] Stern doesn't even need to show gameplay on any game now.

[03:43] 750 Mandalorian Elis sold out.

[03:46] And not just that in one day, now Mandalorian, $12,000,

[03:51] $13,000, $14,000.

[03:54] People are spending on Mandalorian Ellie.

[03:57] So let me get this straight.

[03:58] You're going to spend 50% more than a game is worth.

[04:02] 50% more.

[04:03] There's not 50% more mex in it.

[04:05] There's not 50% more code.

[04:07] There's not 50% more of anything.

[04:09] Why?

[04:10] Why are we doing this?

[04:11] I'm looking at Medieval Manus Royal Edition.

[04:13] It wasn't hard to get a Medieval Manus Royal Edition.

[04:16] I remember when they announced it.

[04:18] I got one.

[04:19] I didn't even want it after having it locked up with Pimball

[04:22] Star.

[04:22] And I just let it go.

[04:23] Someone else got it for $10,000.

[04:26] Now people want $18,000 for it.

[04:29] In 80% increase on the same game that was super easy to get.

[04:35] So when I asked the question at the beginning of this podcast,

[04:37] who is to blame for the price increases in Pimball?

[04:41] I want all of you to do yourself a favor.

[04:44] I'm going to do it too.

[04:45] The person to blame for all of this, go grab a mirror

[04:49] and look at the person in it.

[04:51] It's us.

[04:52] It's you.

[04:53] The Pimball Collector, the Pimball buyer.

[04:55] It's all our fault.

[04:57] We've all created this scenario in which these Pimball companies

[05:01] and Pimball buyers and Pimball sellers

[05:04] are now treating every single game

[05:07] like it's some rare, prestigious work of art.

[05:11] There is such an unbelievable amount of FOMO

[05:15] that is sweeping through Pimball.

[05:17] And I'm going to tackle this on this episode

[05:19] of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[05:21] And I know people want to say, Chris, it's just COVID.

[05:23] People are bored.

[05:24] It's not that.

[05:25] It's not that.

[05:26] This has been brewing for a while.

[05:28] It's all of our faults.

[05:29] It's like it's not even about the Pimball machines anymore.

[05:33] It's simply about acquiring something that is rare,

[05:37] that is special in your mind, that you think is limited.

[05:41] And that's an item to flex with.

[05:43] It's really becoming a lot of that.

[05:45] Because when you look at stuff like the Yellowbric Road

[05:49] and Wanka and basically stuff like Stranger Things,

[05:52] it's not because people feel the games are now great.

[05:56] It's because they're worried that they won't be able to get it.

[06:00] That's it.

[06:01] It's that fear of missing out.

[06:02] It is the strongest emotion possible

[06:06] that these companies can leverage.

[06:08] And here's the part I don't get.

[06:11] For most of you out there, the fear of missing out,

[06:14] you probably all have amazing Pimball machines

[06:17] in your collections.

[06:19] You probably have access to amazing Pimball machines.

[06:22] And these games that are skyrocketing, right?

[06:25] And you see the ones I'm talking about, $38,500

[06:29] for a Pirates of the Caribbean new in box,

[06:32] more than a Honda Civic Type R.

[06:35] I'll tell you which one is more fun in my book.

[06:37] It's not the Pimball machine, okay?

[06:39] Crazy, all right?

[06:40] The only reason that game is so expensive right now

[06:42] is because they're not making anymore.

[06:44] Each and every one of you, me included,

[06:47] could have bought that game easily.

[06:49] Why didn't we buy the game?

[06:51] Because we didn't buy the game

[06:53] because they removed all the fun mechs from the game.

[06:56] We didn't buy the game because they didn't have any assets

[06:59] from Pirates of the Caribbean movie.

[07:01] We didn't buy the game because the game took a year to come out

[07:04] and they over streamed it to the point where nobody wanted it.

[07:07] We didn't buy the game because nobody wants to choose

[07:10] from 22 characters when they start a Pimball machine.

[07:13] It's like learning a Bible to figure out how to play the game.

[07:16] And so we didn't buy the game.

[07:18] We didn't buy the game because we didn't want the game.

[07:21] And the only time we won at the game

[07:23] is when we couldn't have the game.

[07:25] And that isn't what this hobby is supposed to be about.

[07:28] Remember, the joy of Pimball,

[07:30] the whole reason these games are out in the world,

[07:33] they were always meant to go out in the world,

[07:36] play them in our Cades, enjoy them,

[07:40] put a few quarters in them,

[07:41] and then go home and do something else with your time.

[07:44] They weren't meant to sit in homes

[07:47] and be stared at and gauged at like some rare piece of artwork

[07:51] that's only in 200 locations on planet Earth.

[07:54] And that's what we're doing now.

[07:56] And these things are not even Pimball machines anymore.

[07:58] They're just collector items.

[08:01] And we've moved this hobby into the collector item realm.

[08:05] And I'm gonna tell you why this new direction of Pimball

[08:08] is gonna do nothing more than make everything so expensive,

[08:13] but the quality is not gonna get better,

[08:15] and the games are not gonna get better.

[08:17] And we're gonna end up paying through the nose

[08:19] for Pimball machines without getting more in them.

[08:22] And I wanna talk about a few points, right?

[08:25] So the first point that's really just telling these manufacturers

[08:28] just keep raising the prices

[08:30] is the fact that everyone just keeps buying Pimball machines

[08:33] site unseen.

[08:35] Think about in your world,

[08:36] what do you spend a lot of money on

[08:39] that you buy site unseen?

[08:42] Think about it.

[08:43] Do you buy your house site unseen?

[08:45] Do you buy your car?

[08:46] Do you buy an engagement ring?

[08:48] Do you buy your clothes site unseen?

[08:51] You don't even have to show me what it is,

[08:54] and I will buy it.

[08:56] There is nothing else.

[08:58] I know of in my world where I buy it site unseen,

[09:02] absolutely the most ass-in-eye behavior

[09:06] that each and every one of us,

[09:08] each and every one of us engages in.

[09:11] And as long as we create this behavior,

[09:13] as long as we tell these Pimball companies,

[09:15] we will buy whatever you're selling

[09:18] if the theme is decent without even seeing it,

[09:21] without even knowing there's magic under the glass,

[09:23] without even knowing there's a world under class,

[09:25] without even knowing what the artwork is,

[09:27] without even knowing what the mechs are.

[09:28] I mean, I can look no further than Mandalorian Ellie

[09:32] to point out a game that has absolutely no magic

[09:36] under that glass.

[09:36] I am sorry, I'm not gonna be an apologist

[09:39] like all you owners who have it,

[09:41] but that is the most uncreative, unimaginative game

[09:45] I've ever seen considering the theme.

[09:48] All of the cool stuff they could have had in that game.

[09:51] It's Mandalorian people, force powers.

[09:54] They could have had a puck that had a hologram

[09:56] that tells you who to go after with the next bounty.

[09:58] They could have had a floating baby Yoda crib.

[10:01] All the things they could have done, nothing's in it.

[10:04] Nothing's in it.

[10:05] And people wanna spend three to $4,000

[10:07] and claw over each other to get one.

[10:11] This is where we're at.

[10:12] And you're telling me Stern's not watching this behavior?

[10:15] They just jacked up the amount of Ellie's they made

[10:19] by 50% and they sold out immediately.

[10:22] I bet your bottom dollar,

[10:24] we're gonna start to see Stern Pimball

[10:27] raise the price of their Ellie's now to 10.5.

[10:30] And then they're gonna make 1,000 of them

[10:32] and this cycle's going to continue.

[10:35] It's not because Stern is doing it,

[10:37] it's because you'll all buy it

[10:39] and you'll buy it site unseen.

[10:42] And here's the other thing that always kills me

[10:44] is I saw this in a thread the other day.

[10:46] Someone was blaming Jersey Jack Pimball

[10:48] and how Jersey Jack raised the prices of Pimball.

[10:52] And Jersey Jack is the reason why games

[10:54] are so expensive these days

[10:56] and without competition who makes games

[10:58] that are full featured and not overpriced,

[11:00] Stern is never gonna lower their prices

[11:02] and prices are never gonna come back down.

[11:05] And I was like, wait a minute,

[11:06] it's not Jersey Jack's fault.

[11:08] It's not American Pimball's fault.

[11:10] Yes, it is true that there is zero competition

[11:12] in this hobby when it comes to Stern Pimball

[11:14] and everyone else who tries to make Pimball machines

[11:17] can't get their act together

[11:18] and get games out on an annual basis.

[11:20] We all know that.

[11:21] It's not that Stern needs more competition

[11:24] for prices to even out.

[11:25] It's that people need to just stop buying games.

[11:29] If a game comes out and it's not great,

[11:31] people need to stop buying.

[11:33] It's, Stern would put more into their games

[11:35] if people would just stop buying them.

[11:38] But right, that's not even the question, right?

[11:39] Cause then it gets even scarier.

[11:41] Imagine if Stern did put more into their games.

[11:44] Then people would be fighting over each other

[11:46] even more to get them

[11:48] and the prices would keep going up and up and up.

[11:50] See, this is like a perpetual motion has happened.

[11:53] Like this whole thing is now a snowball effect

[11:56] and there's no stopping it.

[11:58] Because people didn't listen to me years ago

[12:00] and I told everybody the Stern bomb on a machine

[12:03] is $3,000.

[12:05] And when you realize that

[12:07] and that Stern employees themselves

[12:09] go home with Ellie's,

[12:11] I think they were going home with Ellie's

[12:13] for like $4,000 or $4,500.

[12:15] That's what a Stern employee could walk home with an Ellie.

[12:18] Now if I'm wrong on that Stern Pimball,

[12:20] you let me know.

[12:21] But I heard from some people over there

[12:24] that that's around the price that a Stern elite cost them.

[12:27] And then it was still comical

[12:28] when they wouldn't even give like zombie Eddie

[12:30] Ellie's of his own machines.

[12:31] I mean, the contracts these people signed with Stern

[12:34] seemed pretty piss poor.

[12:36] Again, club episodes.

[12:37] So I'm just going to say stuff that maybe I shouldn't.

[12:39] When I told everybody that

[12:41] and then you started to see Stern prices go up and up and up

[12:45] and they weren't putting more in the games.

[12:47] They weren't doing much more.

[12:49] They were putting an LCD in the game fine

[12:52] and they were using artwork,

[12:53] but nothing mechanical.

[12:55] They were making the cabinets cheaper people.

[12:57] They were taking the cabinet brackets out of the games

[13:01] to save money.

[13:02] People's cabinets were cracking.

[13:05] They had to wait until people's cabinets were cracking

[13:08] to put back in a $3 part.

[13:11] And that's how Stern Pimball makes money.

[13:14] They go over the entire machine

[13:17] and they say, where can we save a dime?

[13:19] And I would love to be working at Stern.

[13:22] I would love to be an investor at Stern

[13:24] because if I'm a marketer

[13:26] and I'm walking into Stern's boardroom,

[13:28] I'm like, what are we doing trying to put more

[13:30] in these games?

[13:31] Let's not do that.

[13:32] Let's put less in these games.

[13:34] Let's get some big themes.

[13:36] And these fools will buy it.

[13:38] Let's make SLE versions of Batman and Elvira.

[13:42] And these fools will buy it.

[13:45] The more we take out of these games,

[13:47] the only thing we have to do

[13:49] is we have to make them look pretty with artwork.

[13:51] And here's the deal.

[13:52] We're gonna pay an artist a one-time fee

[13:55] to do the art package on three games.

[13:58] How easy is that?

[13:59] All right, we're gonna code the game

[14:01] so every game has the same exact code.

[14:04] These idiots spending more money on the LEDs and CEs, right?

[14:07] They're idiots because they're not getting

[14:09] any more game for their money.

[14:11] I mean, think about that.

[14:12] I know that the premium is, yes,

[14:14] and the Ellie have more than the pro,

[14:16] but think about that for a second people.

[14:18] When you spend $3,000 more,

[14:20] let's think about the SLEs.

[14:22] When you spend $15,000 on the machine,

[14:26] they can't even code a unique thing for you.

[14:30] They can't even do anything for unique

[14:32] for your Elvira game.

[14:34] They can't give you like a special wizard mode

[14:36] for that extra money you're spending on the machine.

[14:39] No, they don't need to.

[14:40] And so that's the conversation is,

[14:42] if we have a community that buys site unseen,

[14:47] that will spend $15,000 on a piece of rug,

[14:50] we're just scratching the surface

[14:53] of where we can take this hobby.

[14:55] And I'm telling you,

[14:56] the next thing we're gonna see from Stern Pimball

[14:58] is a $500 price increase in probably all of their games

[15:02] across the board.

[15:04] And then they're gonna turn on their internet

[15:06] and get ready for it, people.

[15:07] And then it's gonna be monthly subscriptions

[15:10] for all these games.

[15:12] Now the other thing I was thinking about is like,

[15:14] all right, so I understand that there are a lot

[15:17] of rich people in this hobby

[15:19] and you might be one of them.

[15:20] I'm not like this really, really rich guy.

[15:23] I'm not.

[15:23] And just to give you like a little bit of an overview,

[15:25] I do okay, Brennan, I do okay.

[15:28] We don't have any mortgage payments.

[15:30] We're able to pay our bills,

[15:31] we're able to invest money every month.

[15:33] And we're saving our way towards a retirement

[15:37] that hopefully will be south of like 65 years.

[15:40] And we are trying to generate wealth

[15:42] the old fashioned way, you know, you work hard,

[15:45] you try to eliminate your debt,

[15:47] and then you use your income for wealth generation.

[15:51] And maybe I'll have a Ureca idea one day,

[15:53] but I'm not in that kind of industry where,

[15:56] if I have a great idea that I'm gonna get a cut on it.

[16:00] You know, it was like a guy who invented Pac-Man,

[16:02] he didn't become rich off of it because that was his job

[16:05] just to help them design games.

[16:06] He was just an employee.

[16:08] It wasn't his company.

[16:09] And that's sort of where I'm at.

[16:11] Now that being said, I love what I do.

[16:12] And I like that I don't have to like worry

[16:14] about keeping the lights on every day.

[16:16] I have to worry about coming up with ideas.

[16:18] And that's the thing I'm good at.

[16:19] I've said I'm a lot like J-Pop in a lot of ways.

[16:22] I'm a creative.

[16:23] I don't wanna run the company.

[16:24] I don't wanna run the business.

[16:25] I don't wanna run the finances.

[16:27] Other people are doing that.

[16:28] My job is to come up with creative ideas

[16:31] that keep people happy.

[16:32] If I were to start my own company,

[16:34] I think it would end up a lot like Zidware.

[16:37] We're like, what happened?

[16:38] Who's doing all this others have?

[16:39] I don't know.

[16:40] I'm just coming up with the fun stuff.

[16:41] There's a lot of wealthy people in this hobby.

[16:43] Okay, I've seen your houses.

[16:45] I've seen your game rooms.

[16:46] I've seen your cars.

[16:47] And I know there's a lot of people that don't

[16:48] and just love Pimbal.

[16:49] And that's fine.

[16:50] And this is not a class war for a thing I'm about to say.

[16:53] But here is something that I think is another issue

[16:55] with Pimbal and why all of us are to blame.

[16:58] For you wealthy people out there.

[17:00] For you collectors out there.

[17:02] For those people out there who want something

[17:04] that's super expensive, you wanna flex with, right?

[17:07] For those gentlemen out there that want that Rolex,

[17:11] that want that McLaren, that want that item,

[17:14] you want that Gucci, you want that item

[17:16] of clothing or car or house.

[17:18] You buy things that show other people your taste,

[17:23] your wealth and your status in this world.

[17:25] And that's okay.

[17:27] Now for those of you out there who want a Pimbal machine

[17:30] to show that and to flex in that way, here's the problem.

[17:35] Nobody is making Pimbal for rich people.

[17:38] And yet there are a ton of rich people

[17:40] who want to collect Pimbal machines.

[17:43] And because of that, because nobody has the guts

[17:45] to make high end Pimbal machines,

[17:48] the rich people are creating high end Pimbal machines

[17:52] where it should not exist, okay?

[17:55] And this might be my most intelligent point

[17:57] of the last five years.

[17:59] It is the rich Pimbal collector who has arbitrarily

[18:04] forced the prices up of games

[18:07] that should be nowhere near the prices they are at.

[18:10] Pirates of the Caribbean is not a $38,000 experience.

[18:14] If all of us just bought that game when it came out,

[18:17] Jersey Jack would have kept making it

[18:19] and it would not be where it's at.

[18:21] It's not a $38,000 Pimbal experience.

[18:24] The legs are not dipped in gold.

[18:26] There's not some incredible mechanism in that game

[18:29] that's worth the price.

[18:30] For $38,000, they would have had

[18:32] the triple spinning discs.

[18:34] They would have had the treasure chest open and close

[18:37] and Jack Winari himself for $38,000.

[18:40] His head would have popped out of the coin door,

[18:42] singing Zipity Duda as he licked you in your privates.

[18:45] Okay, that's what you would have got for $38,000.

[18:48] But for $12,500, you don't get that stuff.

[18:52] And this game is still a $12,500 game

[18:55] until the rich people determine

[18:58] and the collectors determine, oh my God,

[19:00] it's so rare they're never gonna make anymore

[19:02] and let's go throw all this money at this stuff.

[19:05] Why isn't anybody making a $30,000 Pimbal machine?

[19:09] I just wanna throw this out there.

[19:10] Why isn't anyone making a $30,000 Pimbal machine?

[19:14] If I wanna collect a watch, I can buy a $10,000 watch,

[19:18] I can buy a $300,000 watch and all watches just tell time.

[19:23] If I wanna buy a fun car, I can buy a Mazda Miada

[19:26] for $25,000 or $30,000 or I can buy a $300,000 McLaren.

[19:31] Both fun cars.

[19:33] Pimbal's fun, it's a toy, right?

[19:35] Why can't somebody make a $30,000 Pimbal machine

[19:39] and satiate the super rich collectors

[19:43] that are out there in Pimbal?

[19:44] Why can't someone get the guts

[19:47] and create a boutique company?

[19:49] We're gonna make 250, we're gonna make 250 of Matrix games.

[19:54] And each one is $30,000.

[19:56] It's enough money for the license.

[19:58] It's enough money to pay Eric Minnum way more

[20:01] than he's making a Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[20:02] It's enough money to get the best artist.

[20:04] It's enough money to get the best mechanical engineers.

[20:07] Why doesn't someone do that?

[20:08] Like a company like Spooky, if they wanted to,

[20:11] they could do that.

[20:12] The money is there.

[20:14] If there were only 250 Matrix games in the world

[20:17] for $30,000, they would all sell.

[20:20] And I mean that, but no one's done it.

[20:23] See what's happening now is these games

[20:25] are going up to some of these prices,

[20:27] but they didn't start there.

[20:29] And that's where I think it's pathetic

[20:31] because when you look at the games,

[20:32] you don't see a $38,000 item.

[20:35] You don't see a magical never been done

[20:38] before anything in the game.

[20:40] I mean how pathetic is it to spend $38,000

[20:43] on a pirate to the Caribbean?

[20:44] And it doesn't even have clips from the movie,

[20:47] which they could have put in every game

[20:50] if the games originally were $25,000 or $20,000.

[20:54] They could have, but they didn't.

[20:56] And that's the thing that I think is just also

[20:59] stupid to me in this hobby,

[21:01] is that nobody wants to cater

[21:02] to the high end pinball collector.

[21:04] And so the high end pinball collector

[21:06] is bullying his way into the mainstream.

[21:09] They're making the mainstream games now

[21:12] super sought after and super expensive

[21:14] because that's what they do.

[21:16] That's what collectors will do.

[21:17] They will pump up and they will inflate an item

[21:22] because they need something that they deem collectible.

[21:25] And that's what we're seeing right now.

[21:28] Oh yeah, so right now like stranger things,

[21:30] Ellie is like worth $12,000 all of a sudden.

[21:34] And now this is the new one to Chase After

[21:36] and the next month it's gonna be, watch Elvira.

[21:38] Once they announce they're not making any more Elvira,

[21:41] is everyone's gonna run towards that game.

[21:43] And it's just gonna keep going up and up and up

[21:47] to the point where three stern pinball machines

[21:50] next to each other.

[21:51] We get ready for it.

[21:52] Three stern pinball machines in which the bomb,

[21:55] and that is what they put into the game,

[21:58] is around $9,000 is what they put into those games.

[22:03] You're gonna be able to line up three stern pinball

[22:05] machines soon.

[22:06] And for $9,000 your three games in the collector market

[22:12] are gonna be like $45,000, $50,000

[22:17] when there's only $9,000 in real materials

[22:20] in those things.

[22:21] Does anybody want this?

[22:22] I mean, I'm just thinking about it right now.

[22:24] You guys want this?

[22:24] Is this what we want?

[22:26] Is this what we want?

[22:27] We want to turn pinball and do a collector market.

[22:29] We don't want it to be a game anymore, right?

[22:31] Do we really want this?

[22:32] I mean, I don't see this in modern day video games.

[22:35] That's the other thing too, right?

[22:36] It's like these are new games.

[22:37] These aren't like the old games they're not making anymore.

[22:40] This is brand new stuff.

[22:42] Like I understand why people are spending a lot of money

[22:45] on vintage video games because nobody thought to collect them.

[22:49] But this is different.

[22:50] These are brand new.

[22:51] There's no brand new video games that come out

[22:53] that skyrocket like this.

[22:56] As long as everybody keeps buying like blind sheep,

[22:58] the prices are gonna keep going up and up and up.

[23:01] The other part that's happening

[23:02] is more and more of my friends.

[23:04] And I say this is impacting me too,

[23:05] is we're just kind of getting deflated by it all.

[23:08] It's just not worth it anymore.

[23:10] You start to wake up and be like,

[23:12] you know, this hobby used to be really fun.

[23:14] It was a lot more fun when you could still get stuff

[23:17] and get access to games.

[23:18] And if games were fun and you enjoyed it,

[23:20] and then you wanted to pass it on as a community,

[23:24] people would sell it to you just to give you the experience.

[23:27] And it was like we were helping each other out, right?

[23:29] That was what it used to be.

[23:31] Pinball was this tiny little niche community

[23:33] in which we all helped each other out

[23:35] and we helped each other get stuff.

[23:36] And now it's turning into like,

[23:38] who can I stab in the back to get an Ellie spot

[23:41] with the distributor?

[23:42] How many games can I buy now to flip?

[23:44] And we're seeing it.

[23:45] How many of these games can I buy

[23:47] and just make a profit for myself?

[23:50] And the reason why I've indulged in that behavior too

[23:53] is because you get desensitized to it.

[23:55] Basically, I'm like,

[23:56] there are so many rich guys who are now flooding into this hobby.

[24:00] Most of them are not on Pinside.

[24:02] Most of them have no clue.

[24:03] When I sold my Batman Ellie,

[24:05] when I flipped it to a guy,

[24:07] he didn't even know what code was.

[24:09] He put the game in his house.

[24:11] He just liked Batman.

[24:12] He would still be playing that Batman 66

[24:16] on the first code.

[24:17] And we all know there was no code in that game

[24:19] when they launched it.

[24:20] And that's where we're at, right?

[24:22] There's like, there's a handful of suckers.

[24:24] They will just spend it because they have no clue.

[24:26] I think for most of us,

[24:29] I think for most of us,

[24:30] what we're all hoping happens is somehow,

[24:33] somehow this begins to sort of even out.

[24:36] And everyone knows what will happen eventually.

[24:39] There will be an eventual recession in America.

[24:43] It's coming.

[24:44] It will come and people are going to need money.

[24:48] Unless you have so much money, it doesn't matter,

[24:51] which is not the majority of Pimball buyers.

[24:53] It's not.

[24:54] There's gonna come a point

[24:55] in which if the recession hits and inflation hits,

[24:58] and things become more expensive,

[25:01] and your investments go down,

[25:03] and your job security goes down,

[25:05] and you need capital,

[25:06] or you wanna have your money in areas

[25:09] that you feel are more stable,

[25:11] you might need money to make ends meet,

[25:13] having a lot of money in Pimball machines

[25:15] might not be that wise.

[25:17] I also think we are going to reach a point,

[25:19] and you know this, this is going to happen.

[25:22] It's just gonna get oversaturated.

[25:24] We're kind of already there.

[25:26] I see a lot of people's game rooms.

[25:28] There's not a lot of room left

[25:30] for all these new games coming.

[25:33] And there are a lot of new games coming.

[25:36] And for a lot of you,

[25:37] you're just addicted to buying Pimball just admitted,

[25:40] every time there's a new game,

[25:42] you're one of the sight unseen people,

[25:45] banging on the door of your distributor saying,

[25:47] get me one, if Toy Story came out tomorrow,

[25:50] it would sell out even if they didn't fix the play fields.

[25:54] There's something about it.

[25:55] There's something about it, but I'll tell you,

[25:57] I'll tell you, the other part I would work on,

[26:01] all of you, I would work on your mental strength

[26:04] to avoid that FOMO,

[26:07] to avoid feeling like having these things

[26:10] will make me happier.

[26:12] The better way to look at it,

[26:14] the better way to approach life.

[26:16] I'm happy with what I have, I don't need more.

[26:21] I will enjoy the games I own,

[26:23] I will explore them to the fullest

[26:25] and when I'm done with them

[26:27] and I'm bored with them, I will move them on.

[26:31] I won't hoard them, I won't ask $25,000

[26:35] for a pirate's le, I won't, yeah fine, make a profit,

[26:39] but we all know where the profit is

[26:42] and then where the ridiculousness is, right?

[26:45] My friend Justin Kelly, I think he supports this podcast,

[26:48] Justin bought his Matrix Pimball machine,

[26:50] you know they made like 12 of them,

[26:52] the guys over in the Netherlands,

[26:53] he bought it for $25,000, right?

[26:56] Great, Justin, goodbye.

[26:58] I had a chance to buy it, I didn't buy it.

[27:00] It's a re-skin of a Johnny New Monk, right?

[27:02] This wasn't a game made by Valley Williams

[27:05] back in the day where there was only eight King Pins

[27:07] or eight King Kongs.

[27:08] He's listing it for sale for $75,000 or $79,000 on eBay.

[27:16] So that's great, thank you Justin,

[27:18] $50,000 profit and I know what people do, they do this.

[27:23] He's not really trying to sell it at that,

[27:25] but my point is if you bought it for $25,000,

[27:30] why not pass it on to the next guy

[27:32] and make a $10,000 profit and everyone's happy?

[27:36] These things just can't keep going up and up and up,

[27:39] but this is where we're at, this is where we're at.

[27:41] And the one thing you barely see people talk about

[27:43] on Pinside and you barely see people discuss

[27:47] is playing the games.

[27:48] The happiest dude in Pimball has got like a beat up

[27:52] Star Trek next generation or a beat up

[27:54] last action hero.

[27:56] He's got one Pimball machine, he wakes up,

[28:00] he grabs a few beers, he jumps on it

[28:02] and he has an incredible few hours playing Pimball.

[28:05] That's the happiest man in Pimball.

[28:07] It's not the guy with 30 Pimball machines

[28:10] who can't possibly play them all

[28:12] or hardly anyone ever comes over his house

[28:15] to play the machines.

[28:16] And then like years later, he's trying to sell his stuff

[28:19] for double with only 200 plays, you know,

[28:22] that's the big thing, less than 200 plays.

[28:24] That's not the happiest guy.

[28:26] And the reason why, let's face it,

[28:28] the reason why people want to keep buying the next

[28:31] and the next is because you're not really satisfied

[28:34] with each of these new machines you're getting.

[28:35] You're not, you play them, you realize

[28:38] there's not a real world under glass,

[28:40] you realize there's not a ton of Pimball moments

[28:42] in these games and most of us have been brainwashed.

[28:45] Think about it, you've been brainwashed,

[28:47] you've been brainwashed by all the people

[28:49] that just want to sell you games,

[28:51] they want you to fall into the hype.

[28:53] No, if I were to ask you,

[28:55] what are the magical moments of the last five years

[28:57] of Stern Pimball machines, it's amazing to me.

[29:00] How short the list is,

[29:02] how hard it is for people to think of,

[29:05] oh wait, when Knaida puts it like that,

[29:08] there really aren't many magical mechs or moments

[29:11] in these Pimball machines, but hey, Knaida, they're fun.

[29:14] So here, take my money now before I see it.

[29:16] I think all of us are on our own Pimball journey

[29:20] and I do implore each and every one of you

[29:22] to find the balance that makes you happy.

[29:24] But I will never stop beating that drum.

[29:27] When I start to see these prices get to where they're at,

[29:30] it makes me angry because I know there's not magic

[29:33] put into these games.

[29:35] I know they're not giving the designers

[29:37] those kinds of budgets,

[29:39] but think about how stupid it is, right?

[29:41] If Stern knows they could sell every Mandalorian

[29:44] for $12,000, why not give Brian Eddie $3,000 more

[29:49] to make that game worth it?

[29:51] If they know they can sell guns and roses for $18,000,

[29:54] why not give Eric Minier more money

[29:56] to put more into guns and roses?

[29:58] That's why it sort of upsets me

[30:00] as these things are flipping immediately for so much more,

[30:04] but the game isn't so much better.

[30:06] And the code isn't so much better,

[30:07] and the art isn't so much better,

[30:09] and the mechs aren't so much better.

[30:11] It's like we're not getting what we're paying for.

[30:14] You're just paying for some cosmetic stuff

[30:16] that doesn't change gameplay at all.

[30:19] That's not cool.

[30:21] Give us more world under glass, all right?

[30:24] Everybody, this has been episode six of the Knaida Club.

[30:27] Thank you so much for your contributions.

[30:30] I'm gonna keep doing these shows just for you guys.

[30:32] I'm also going to be releasing my merchandise very soon.

[30:35] And as I said on my other show,

[30:37] I am going to make my first merchandise item

[30:40] exclusively available at the beginning

[30:43] to everyone who's a Knaida Club member.

[30:46] And the first t-shirt will be Viva La Raza.

[30:50] And it's to celebrate that Knaida Spinball podcast

[30:52] has sold more subscriptions than Robert Mueller

[30:55] will have sold of Raza Pinball machines.

[30:58] So look for that email at some point,

[31:00] and you're gonna be able to order,

[31:02] I'm going to the vendor today.

[31:03] I think it's gonna be like white and black.

[31:05] We'll see if that's too expensive.

[31:07] And you're gonna be able to order your size

[31:09] before I put the ordering.

[31:11] So this isn't like, I'm gonna order 122.

[31:14] And I know most of you haven't been to the gym like Knaida.

[31:17] Come on, I know, put your fitness first.

[31:19] I'm ordering a small people.

[31:20] How many of you can say that you could fit into a small

[31:23] of a Knaida Pinball podcast t-shirt, okay?

[31:26] Your contribution means the world to Brenda,

[31:28] Killian and myself.

[31:30] It's a lot of hard work doing over 600 podcasts.

[31:32] I know for a lot of you,

[31:34] you're not donating just for these special club episodes

[31:37] or for merchandise, you're donating to say thank you Chris

[31:40] for all the content you've given us over the years.

[31:43] And I know that and I super appreciate it.

[31:45] And this is just the beginning of the Knaida Club.

[31:47] So look for more fun stuff to happen as well.

[31:49] And I'm probably gonna go to Pinball Expose.

[31:52] So if you're going, we do have to have a special

[31:55] Knaida Club hang out, all right?

[31:57] Nobody else invited, just VIPs, you, me and Jack Winari.

[32:01] You won't have a hard time finding me at Expo.

[32:03] Trust me, I mean, my Knaida outfits

[32:05] sort of are pretty bright and loud.

[32:07] I'll talk to you guys soon.

[32:08] We're so lucky.

[32:10] We probably think this song is about you.

[32:15] We're so lucky.

[32:18] We probably think this song is about you.

[32:24] We're so lucky.
