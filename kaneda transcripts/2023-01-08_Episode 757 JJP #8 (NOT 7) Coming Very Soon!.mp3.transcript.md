[00:00] You know, it's been a little bit of a roller coaster week for Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:03] I think I put up my greatest Facebook Live yesterday.

[00:06] This James Bond game is divided the community, but in the right way, where like 99% of us

[00:12] are on the right side of this argument.

[00:15] And I just want to play a little bit of an extended intro to the show today that just

[00:18] captures the energy and the vibe that I'm feeling going into 2023.

[00:24] And if you're part of the Canada Club, I know you're feeling it.

[00:27] And if you're following me on Facebook, you're feeling it.

[00:30] And don't let the haters try and stop you.

[00:32] There are people going after my fans.

[00:34] It's okay, man.

[00:35] Everyone, whether you love Canada or hate Canada, you have to admit having Canada in

[00:40] Pinball is good for Pinball.

[00:43] Let's hit it.

[00:44] I've been saying it and they told me to stop.

[00:52] With these pretentious things, we just bunched and plucked.

[00:58] Sometimes the one heck of a world's so small.

[01:07] Can we ever get away from this world?

[01:11] We're living in this world.

[01:13] Take shot in the most rows.

[01:15] The mountains, the old mountains, and there's no one to save.

[01:20] I need darkness and the keys to the new lights.

[01:25] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[01:29] Oh, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:33] It's Sunday.

[01:34] I'm hungover.

[01:35] There was a really good friend of mine in need last night.

[01:39] Lots of Chinese food, lots of alcohol, lots of optimism on everyone's faces going into

[01:47] 2023.

[01:48] I'm very optimistic about what's happening in my life in Pinball, in the world in general,

[01:53] like watching the politicians not able to swear in speakers.

[01:58] It was great.

[01:59] It's great.

[02:00] Everything's starting to fall into place.

[02:02] Now, speaking of falling into place, we've beat the dead horse of James Bond's 60th enough.

[02:08] I think I'm getting reports from people who have played it.

[02:12] It's going to be a fun shooting game and it will never be worth anything close to $20,000.

[02:20] And Stern's greed and the DNA of their marketing department will leave an indelible impression

[02:28] on both customers and distributors for a while.

[02:33] As we wait and see what is the next greedy cash grab move from this company, I can't

[02:40] wait to Stern tries to do DLC.

[02:42] Why do you think they're shoving Insider Connected onto everybody's game?

[02:47] Because they're going to make you pay money to unlock the full potential of the game after

[02:52] you already spent like $14,000 on an LE.

[02:55] It's coming, people.

[02:56] It's coming.

[02:57] But we're thinking about the future and anyone who put a deposit on Scooby-Doo who did not

[03:04] wait and see is going to learn from Canada's Pinball Podcasts that maybe they should have

[03:11] waited just to see their options in the early part of this year.

[03:16] Because I'm here to tell you, first podcast, first media outlet, I have not heard this

[03:22] anywhere else in the world.

[03:24] Then you've seen it already because I posted the Killian image that Jersey Jack's seventh

[03:30] game is coming out, is rumored to be revealed on February 20th, 220, just a few days before

[03:40] Killian's birthday.

[03:41] We are going to get Jersey Jack number seven.

[03:44] Now, here's what we think we know about this game.

[03:48] It is going to be an Eric Minier game, which has everybody very excited.

[03:52] He is the best designer over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[03:55] I don't care what anybody says.

[03:57] When Eric makes a game, he puts his heart and soul into it.

[04:01] And when Pat Lawler makes a game, sure, it shoots great, but it has no soul.

[04:06] Eric's games have tremendous soul.

[04:08] So I'm really looking forward to Eric's next game.

[04:11] And even though he might have snubbed me a little bit, I still communicate with Eric Minier

[04:17] to this day.

[04:18] Right now, the Jersey Jack marketing folks are like, what are you doing talking to Canada?

[04:21] It's not good.

[04:22] He's toxic.

[04:23] He's going to turn on you one day.

[04:25] You know, the only pinball machine I own on planet Earth right now is Eric Minier's

[04:29] Guns N' Roses number 500 sitting at CoinTaker.

[04:32] So we know it's Eric Minier.

[04:34] We know Christopher Franchi is on the art package and the rumored title is Godfather.

[04:40] Now, look, we've beat up this theme.

[04:42] We've talked about this theme for a really long time.

[04:45] Is it going to be Godfather?

[04:47] We should know in just about two months.

[04:50] Now, this is really exciting because I don't think anyone was expecting Jersey Jack number

[04:55] seven to come out so soon.

[04:57] But the reason why it's coming out so soon, can you guess it's really not hard grown men

[05:03] don't want a forky pinball machine that has an LCD screen where there should be like a

[05:10] ferris wheel or some sort of toy.

[05:12] Toy Story 4 was a sales failure based on the projections of that theme.

[05:18] I mean, if you're Jersey Jack pinball, you thought Toy Story would have been one of your

[05:22] biggest hits of all time.

[05:24] I'm hearing it's not selling well.

[05:26] They overpriced it.

[05:27] It's not even selling as well as Willy Wonka.

[05:30] I'm hearing a thousand CEs at $15,000 are losing people money.

[05:35] Everybody's lost on this game.

[05:37] Look, it's fun to shoot.

[05:39] I get it.

[05:40] But this thing about pinball being just fun to shoot is not enough because here's been

[05:44] the theme with Toy Story and James Bond 60th, fun to shoot, hate the price.

[05:49] Right?

[05:50] You can't have those two things go together and have a successful pinball launch and saying

[05:55] those things that I love the way it shoots and I absolutely hate the price.

[06:00] And that is just the honest feeling of the majority of pinball people now.

[06:04] And that is why if you are a new inbox buyer, you are waiting and seeing before you plunk

[06:09] down your money on the game.

[06:11] And if you hate the price and you don't want to spend the money, then you're not going

[06:14] to spend the money no matter what's in the game, no matter how well it shoots, no matter

[06:18] what the assets are, what the toys are.

[06:20] If you absolutely hate the price and you don't see the value in it, you're not going to buy

[06:24] the game.

[06:25] And that's just the way it's going to be.

[06:28] And so with Jersey Jack games now being very high priced, right?

[06:33] $15 for the CE, $12 for the LE, we are expecting good things.

[06:37] Now look, Canada in the past would always overhype the game.

[06:41] I would get you guys super excited.

[06:43] Eric Minier, the genius is coming out with his third game.

[06:46] You know, this is going to be incredible.

[06:47] This is going to be that.

[06:48] This is going to be, and it would always get everybody very ramped up and very hyped and

[06:51] ready to go.

[06:52] And then what would happen?

[06:53] The game would come out like Toy Story 4 or Willy Wonka and it would underwhelm us.

[06:58] And then everyone would say, you're a hypocrite, Canada.

[07:01] You got us excited.

[07:02] Look, the only pinball machine that I really felt good about hyping was Guns and Roses

[07:08] because I saw it.

[07:10] And look, Willy Wonka, even though I did get excited because I played it before everybody

[07:15] else, if what Jack told me was going to be in Willy Wonka, you too would have been as

[07:21] excited as I was.

[07:24] Nothing from the movie made it into the game the way he said it was going to be in the

[07:28] game.

[07:29] Okay?

[07:30] So, I'm the messenger.

[07:31] I was told things that didn't come true.

[07:34] So, I'm not going to hype this game.

[07:36] I'm not going to tell you get your money ready, but I will tell you this.

[07:40] I think if you waited on Scooby-Doo, you were smart.

[07:43] I think if you waited on James Bond, Ali, because the code's not even nearly done, you

[07:48] were smart.

[07:49] And I think if you waited to see the next Jersey Jack game, you are smart because at

[07:53] these prices, I don't know about you, but I'm about like maybe I'll buy a pinball machine

[07:59] a year now.

[08:00] Maybe I will buy a pinball machine a year, but it really has to check a lot of boxes.

[08:07] And the recent offerings from these companies just have not checked enough boxes.

[08:12] I mean, I'm surprised a lot of people went in on Scooby-Doo so early without seeing any

[08:17] of the code yet from a rookie coder.

[08:20] Like I'm nervous.

[08:21] You really think spooky pinball on an inaugural game by a coder is going to be as good or

[08:26] at the level of the kinds of games you've been playing over the last like 15 years from

[08:32] Stern, the games from Jersey Jack.

[08:34] You know, I don't know.

[08:35] The verdict is still out on what DJ is going to do with Scooby-Doo.

[08:40] And that's why I'm going to wait and see.

[08:42] And we're going to see Scooby-Doo, I think at the end of this month, I think Deadflip

[08:45] is going to stream it.

[08:47] But putting money down before that was really weird to see a lot of people do that.

[08:52] And I say rut, Ro, because what happens if you gave a nonrefundable deposit on Scooby-Doo,

[08:58] what happens if you see the gameplay and the code is not good at all?

[09:02] What happens if you see the gameplay and maybe it could be boring and maybe the balltimes

[09:07] are super long and maybe you don't see great gameplay, rut, Ro.

[09:11] So you went in on it just because of theme and art.

[09:14] And again, like that's just not enough for me anymore.

[09:17] I'm not just going to plunk down money on theme and art alone.

[09:20] Like I need to see the code is there.

[09:22] I need to see the magical moments are there.

[09:25] I need to see the longevity is there.

[09:27] I need to see the replay value, all this stuff, right?

[09:30] I need to make sure that this has enough because at these prices, buying pinball machine isn't

[09:36] fun anymore.

[09:37] It's not fun separating from like 16.5 with taxes and tip for a Toy Story 4 only to wake

[09:45] up the next day and see people selling them for 3, 4,000 less.

[09:50] Who wants to lose that much money?

[09:52] I mean, I don't even want to get into the people who sent $22,000 to Stern on Wednesday

[09:58] only to wake up on Thursday to see dealers and distros selling James Bond for $17,000,

[10:04] $18,000.

[10:05] People lost $4,000 in one day on James Bond's 60th only to wake up on Friday to lose the

[10:13] exclusive topper of the game.

[10:16] Are you kidding me Stern?

[10:17] I mean, opening up that topper to everybody after they advertised it as being a freaking

[10:24] exclusive to the game.

[10:27] This is the sleaziest move I've seen Stern do.

[10:30] I think they should be ashamed of themselves.

[10:32] I think distributors who took nonrefundable deposits from people before the game was shown

[10:39] should really be ashamed of themselves.

[10:41] If it's one of you, I think they should refund everybody because I think and I said it on

[10:46] my Facebook post, any distributor with half a heart and half a brain would never, after

[10:52] seeing the game, because Stern didn't do the distro call before they revealed the game.

[10:56] Any distro who saw this game before never would have taken those deposits.

[11:00] They would not have wanted to upset their customers.

[11:03] Look, distros care about their customers.

[11:05] They do.

[11:06] It's Stern that doesn't care about its distros when it pulls a sleazy move like this.

[11:11] I think the whole thing has been sleazy.

[11:13] I think a lot of the sleazy tactics that have been happening have now been confirmed.

[11:19] Our worst fears about how little Stern might care about us were confirmed with this James

[11:25] Bond release.

[11:26] I think the big concern by everybody in the hobby right now is this the future of Stern.

[11:31] Okay, but let's go back to Jersey Jack number seven.

[11:34] So Godfather, is it going to be Godfather?

[11:36] The other thing I've heard about this game from people who have flipped it, I heard it's

[11:40] going to be Eric Minier's response to all the people who say he does not know how to

[11:46] design a game with great flow.

[11:49] So I expect this game to be a flow monster from Eric Minier.

[11:54] Steve Ritchie's been over there, but I think Steve Ritchie arrived after this game was

[11:58] done.

[11:59] That's the other thing.

[12:00] This game has been done for a while.

[12:03] People have been playing this game for a year, finished, complete.

[12:07] I bet Eric has finished his next game.

[12:10] He's really, really efficient.

[12:12] And so I think when we see this game on day one, what's also going to be exciting, this

[12:16] isn't going to be waiting for assets.

[12:19] This isn't going to be incomplete code.

[12:22] Jersey Jack is going to drop a fully featured game into the world.

[12:27] Prior to Toy Story, Jersey Jack pinball launches were always the most special launches every

[12:32] couple of years because it's one company who makes one game every like 18 months and their

[12:39] reveal videos are usually the best other than Toy Story.

[12:42] Everything is usually really good.

[12:44] Like Guns N' Roses was still the greatest pinball launch of all time.

[12:47] It will go down as the greatest pinball launch of all time.

[12:51] Everything about it was perfect.

[12:53] Everything looked perfect.

[12:54] The game played perfect.

[12:55] Yes, then we had the Chipping Playfields, but that wasn't really Jersey Jack's fault.

[13:00] It was that clown Mirko who's still in the industry for some reason, who still refuses

[13:05] to answer questions when Kaneda asks him what's going on man, like what happened.

[13:09] He just got up and walked out of the seminar room.

[13:12] It was unbelievable.

[13:13] Little Weasel with his book bag.

[13:15] And I will call him that to his face because he is a little Weasel.

[13:19] So I think we're going to get back on track with a really good Jersey Jack launch.

[13:24] The other thing is this, if I was Jersey Jack and I was giving Ken Cromwell some advice,

[13:29] if it is Godfather, I would announce that now.

[13:32] I would announce we're going to give you a game you can't refuse coming February 20th.

[13:37] I would break the trend of not letting people know in advance what the theme is a little

[13:43] bit.

[13:44] I think FOMO, if that's the only thing, and Jason over at Pinball Party said this the

[13:48] best, if FOMO is the only thing we've got, if that's the only marketing tool to get people

[13:53] excited about pinball, then this hobby is getting really lame and he's right.

[13:57] And I think everyone's feeling that way and he is right.

[14:00] So look, you've got Godfather.

[14:02] Just let people know.

[14:03] You know the date.

[14:04] Let people know the date in advance.

[14:06] Make a moment out of it.

[14:08] I think it's always so stupid that I know what movies are coming out when.

[14:12] I know what video games are coming out when.

[14:14] I know everything happening in the world except for the release schedule of pinball machines

[14:20] because they have to create the FOMO the week of.

[14:23] And that's all they do.

[14:24] But you don't even know the week before that the game's about to drop.

[14:28] And I think it's ridiculous.

[14:29] And I think with titles like Toy Story 4 and titles like Godfather, if they had let people

[14:35] know in advance, they would have helped themselves because we would have got out of our system

[14:42] all of the anger about it being only Toy Story 4 or all of the anger about how can you make

[14:48] a Godfather pinball machine work and let people fight that out.

[14:52] Look at the James Bond thread.

[14:54] It's a great example of this.

[14:55] Look at that thread.

[14:56] It's like 88 pages of grown, wealthy white men beating themselves up for like three or

[15:03] four days.

[15:04] But I'll tell you this right now.

[15:06] Everybody in that thread is now exhausted of the argument and they will move on to the

[15:13] next thing to complain about.

[15:15] So it is sometimes a smart marketing move.

[15:19] If you know you have a few things people might complain about, let them complain about it

[15:24] further in advance and don't let that spoil the launch of the game.

[15:29] And then come February 20th, you really have the ability to really control the narrative

[15:35] more.

[15:36] And no one's going to be shocked that it's Godfather.

[15:38] They'll be like, I can't believe you made Godfather.

[15:40] Why would you want to inundate your launch day with so many people saying, I can't believe

[15:45] they made Godfather?

[15:46] How stupid are they?

[15:47] Let them complain about that in January.

[15:50] The other thing that's interesting, right, with Jersey Jack, it's like, this is Jersey

[15:53] Jack number seven, right?

[15:55] Seven pinball machines and Jersey Jack came into the space around 2010.

[16:01] So in 13 years, they've only made seven games as of this coming February.

[16:07] Not that effective.

[16:08] In 13 years, Stern Pinball has made, I don't know, I'm just going to guess right now.

[16:13] Stern does about on average three new games a year, 13 years, 39 games from Stern Pinball

[16:20] versus seven from Jersey Jack.

[16:22] Look, I think this is really exciting.

[16:24] I think this gives us something new to look forward to.

[16:27] It definitely will give us something new to complain about or celebrate.

[16:31] And that's what pinball is, people.

[16:33] It is a toy in a box, an expensive box of blinking lights.

[16:37] We are allowed to celebrate stuff.

[16:40] We are allowed to complain about stuff.

[16:42] I'm allowed to speak my mind about it.

[16:44] Your decision is to be here.

[16:45] No one's forcing you to be here.

[16:48] Nobody's forcing anybody to watch my Facebook Live and nobody's hurting people's livelihoods

[16:53] if we tell you to wait and see.

[16:55] See, that's the thing is nobody wants to come out and say, like, it's so toxic that he's

[16:59] telling people to wait and play the game before buying it.

[17:03] That is the behavior we need to get back to.

[17:06] And Jason said it the best.

[17:07] He's like, if it's only FOMO, if you're not going to stand behind your product and its

[17:11] features and just say, hey, we're going to make this forever, we made this amazing magical

[17:15] pinball machine.

[17:16] We're so happy.

[17:17] We know you're going to want one.

[17:18] Here it is.

[17:19] And just put it on the line and enough with all of the FOMO tactics.

[17:24] Enough of saying things are worth like $30,000 because you only made five.

[17:29] Those days are never going to completely come to an end, but the problem now, look, and I'm

[17:33] not some like woke dreamer who thinks Gen Z's vapid way of living is going to bring them

[17:38] any happiness.

[17:40] But I'll tell you this as a, what am I, Gen X?

[17:42] I'll tell you this right now.

[17:44] We're never going to get rid of FOMO.

[17:46] We're never going to get rid of like scarce, limited things, driving the collector community.

[17:51] But what we would like to see if you are going down that road and you want to make a collectible

[17:57] and you want to make something special and you want to make it high priced, then make

[18:00] it as beautiful as Batman SLE as Elvira 40th.

[18:04] That's all we're asking for.

[18:06] Don't usher out this James Bond pin that looks like it costs $4,000 and slap a $20,000

[18:13] price tag on it.

[18:14] That's it.

[18:15] That's the ending and the end of the conversation.

[18:17] There's no FOMO for that game.

[18:19] And it really brought out the worst in everybody.

[18:22] Everybody I love doing this podcast.

[18:24] I love hanging out with each and every one of you every Saturday morning.

[18:27] I love my new friends.

[18:29] I'm going to give a shout out to Jengus, man, this guy in Denmark.

[18:32] Super fun dude.

[18:33] We're going to be making some reveal videos for you guys.

[18:36] I want to give a shout out to Cliff Albert.

[18:38] I don't even know if he's a subscriber.

[18:39] I think he is.

[18:40] He's a guy who's a really good guy.

[18:42] And we had a great conversation like at 1.30 in the morning just talking about pinball

[18:47] and life.

[18:48] I want to give a shout out to Billy B who's always hanging out.

[18:50] Mr. Ed Robertson, Kim Mitchell.

[18:52] I mean, there's a lot of you guys.

[18:54] I want to give a shout out to Mark Henry.

[18:55] Not even short piece of club member, but Mark yesterday on the Facebook live kicked me 5,000

[19:01] stars to contribute to Brenda's sushi dinners.

[19:05] And I'll end this podcast by saying yes, I love it when you vote for me in the Twippies.

[19:10] I don't think it's a negative thing.

[19:12] I think when we hear people complaining about award shows and how they're structured, doesn't

[19:16] that take the fun and the celebratory nature out of it all?

[19:19] I mean, the Twippies are going to be great.

[19:21] I think Amodo and Todd are going to do great.

[19:23] I can't wait to go to Texas.

[19:24] I got my cargo shorts ready if I win great.

[19:28] And I'm telling you this, if I lose the Twippy for favorite pinball podcast or favorite pinball

[19:32] streamer, I will be the first person to stand up, applaud and congratulate the first person

[19:40] to beat me in the last six years because I think it's great.

[19:43] I think it's great having competition.

[19:45] I think competition makes products better.

[19:47] Whether you're making a podcast or you're making a pinball machine, we're all grown men.

[19:52] And if you have an issue with somebody, simply reach out to them.

[19:56] I had a really, really good conversation with Mr.

[19:59] Christopher Franci and we were going back and forth.

[20:01] Like maybe you didn't see it, but sometimes it'll upload stuff at like one in the morning

[20:05] and I'll see it.

[20:06] And I'll be like, Franci, really?

[20:08] And whenever we talk, we always get to a better place.

[20:12] And I think we need more of that in pinball and I know I'm a very polarizing figure, but

[20:17] my door is always open.

[20:20] I have never shut the door on having a conversation to get to a better, more optimistic

[20:26] place about pinball.
