[00:00] My only prayer will be, someday you'll care for me,

[00:05] but it's only me, we'll live.

[00:30] New Game from Stern Pinball, it's only make believe the value of LE machines.

[00:36] I just saw today a Foo Fighter LE now for sale for $9000 with low plays, and this is

[00:44] the problem now everybody, we all know this.

[00:47] Unless you're living in a D&D vacuum, it's not about the game itself, this is Stern's

[00:52] big issue.

[00:53] It doesn't matter anymore what they put out at these prices, if we keep seeing these

[00:59] games lose so much value, how do you convince yourself to go in at these MSRP prices?

[01:06] We're going to talk about that, we're going to talk about the Dwight stream, I'm still

[01:11] confused as to why they allow Dwight to talk over the first gameplay footage we have of

[01:18] this machine, and they think that's going to sell them more games.

[01:23] Tomorrow they're going to open up the doors in Chicago and get all of the shill content

[01:29] creators to tell you how great the game is, that's going to happen tomorrow, I will not

[01:35] be there, I will be at work, I'm not spending my own money, I would rather fly to Vegas

[01:40] and watch Jody all bored sitting in his chair as media are streaming the game.

[01:46] We're going to talk about Tales of the Arabian Knights is coming back, are you excited about

[01:51] that?

[01:52] Alice parts are rolling in and Evil Deads are about to go on the line, and I think we're

[01:59] all sort of in this weird sort of place right now in Pimbal.

[02:03] Let's just talk about the overall feeling right now in the hobby.

[02:08] I think a lot of us are in a really good place and I mean that.

[02:13] I think a lot of us have come to peace with the new reality of how we can approach this

[02:20] hobby and this is a brand new year and I think it's a brand new sort of behavior for each

[02:26] and every one of us.

[02:27] I think the piece we've all achieved is that we can actually praise a Pimbal machine, we

[02:34] can give a company like Stern a lot of credit for putting a lot of awesome stuff into D&D,

[02:40] but we're also at peace with the fact that I don't need to buy the game this week.

[02:46] We're at peace with the fact that if I ever want to get a D&D and I like what I see, I

[02:51] can simply wait for the code to be finished and then I can go buy the machine for significantly

[02:57] less money than if I bought it right away.

[03:00] And that's a really liberating place to be.

[03:03] I don't need to fall victim to all of these content creators and distributors reminding

[03:10] me and spamming me all day long that they have Dungeons and Dragons for sale.

[03:15] Of course you do and here's the reality everybody, you know this, I know this, you know this,

[03:20] the LEs did not sell out, they didn't even come close to selling out and now the game

[03:26] value is in trouble.

[03:28] It doesn't matter what happens now, it really doesn't.

[03:30] These streams are not going to change people's minds.

[03:33] You can tell just by watching the Dwight stream, I saw the stream at CES, you can tell you're

[03:40] not going to see enough in a stream that's going to make you want to spend this much

[03:46] money on the game because most of you, be honest, you're not D&D fanatics.

[03:51] And so when you start to see more and more of this game like saving the miners and saving

[03:56] this and doing this and going on this journey and defeating the dragon, it's just not going

[04:01] to be enough.

[04:02] None of this stuff is going to emotionally move you.

[04:06] None of this stuff is going to feel like you have to buy this game right now and it's

[04:10] not an indictment on the game, it's just the reality of where pinball is at.

[04:16] And it's at the point now where people that proclaim they bought an LE this week, they

[04:20] look foolish.

[04:21] Like you really do look foolish because again, it's going to be a $10,000 machine in just

[04:27] a few months.

[04:29] And so look, I think while we're all at peace right now, I also think, I have to say this,

[04:34] the reason we've come to peace with all of these launches recently over the last few

[04:39] years is there really hasn't been a juggernaut theme that everybody's wanted.

[04:45] Harry Potter is a huge theme.

[04:47] I would argue that as big as Harry Potter is, let's face it people, it's not really

[04:53] our generations must have fantasy theme.

[04:57] It isn't.

[04:58] We are much more into Lord of the Rings, much more into Star Wars, much more into Star Trek.

[05:05] There's geekier things that we are into.

[05:08] Harry Potter is like the next generation's sort of Star Wars.

[05:13] And so how many of you out there have seen the Harry Potter movies?

[05:17] I bet most of us have.

[05:18] Now how many of you go back and watch them over and over again?

[05:21] You probably don't.

[05:23] How many of you out there quote Harry Potter movies all the time?

[05:27] How many of you can recite lines from the Harry Potter movies?

[05:31] How many of you think fondly about moments from those films and still think about it

[05:37] today?

[05:38] How many of you even read the books?

[05:40] So Harry Potter, it's a huge franchise.

[05:42] We're not dealing with small franchises in the world of Pimble.

[05:46] Avatar is like the number one movie of all time in terms of box office gross, not adjusted

[05:51] for inflation because then it's still gone with the wind, but it's still at the top of

[05:56] the most money a movie has ever made and they make a Pimble version of it and it flops.

[06:02] So it's going to be interesting when Harry Potter comes out.

[06:05] And King Kong also is a really cool theme, but again, it's not something that each and

[06:11] every one of us has this sort of like carnal, emotional desire to finally get a King Kong

[06:18] Pimble machine.

[06:19] It's not what you've been wishing for.

[06:22] Look, it's going to do great.

[06:23] I think both Harry Potter and King Kong are going to do phenomenally well for their respective

[06:29] companies.

[06:31] One's going to do phenomenally well because it's going to be Jersey Jack's return to

[06:35] wide body games with a lot of magic in it.

[06:38] And the theme alone is going to sell like 6,000 units of that Harry Potter game, probably

[06:44] more.

[06:45] I don't know at these prices, that's a lot of money they're making.

[06:48] And then Keith Elwin and King Kong is going to do just fine.

[06:52] And because those games are right around the corner, it's another reason why we're at peace

[06:57] with not buying a D&D.

[07:00] Now people are going to buy D&D, absolutely.

[07:02] I'm not rooting against Stern.

[07:04] I've noticed this lately this week.

[07:06] It's like, I think some of us secretly want Stern Pimble, maybe not even secretly, maybe

[07:12] publicly.

[07:13] I think a lot of us sort of want Stern to learn a lesson that you took prices too high,

[07:20] that you burned a lot of Ellie collectors with the remakes.

[07:24] I think there's like a silent, maybe it is a silent majority of people in the Pimble

[07:29] buying world that kind of are happy not spending money and buying every new Stern release.

[07:37] And I think the market is actually reinforcing those people's decisions.

[07:42] I don't think they're malicious.

[07:44] I don't think they're vindictive.

[07:46] But it does feel like just maybe people, just maybe.

[07:51] Modern Stern pricing is where it's at because we're paying for that humongous factory they

[07:57] moved into.

[07:59] And since they've been in that big factory, they haven't been cranking out hit after hit

[08:05] after hit.

[08:06] The IP and the licenses they've been bringing the market haven't been big enough to support

[08:11] that kind of factory.

[08:13] And I think Stern's in a little bit of trouble.

[08:15] I really do.

[08:17] I don't know how they're going to navigate this and keep launching machines at these

[08:22] prices time and time again.

[08:24] But that's their problem to figure out.

[08:26] It's not mine.

[08:27] We all know the solution to that problem.

[08:29] They're not going to lower prices.

[08:31] So they're going to have to bring big themes out.

[08:34] I hope they ain't going to deal with Dutch Pimble to make back to the future.

[08:37] I don't think that deal's done.

[08:39] I'm not sure it's even going to happen.

[08:41] But think about it like this.

[08:42] After King Kong, we normally know what is next from Stern Pimble.

[08:47] I'm going to tell you right now what I've heard.

[08:49] That John Borg is releasing the next two cornerstone games from Stern Pimble after Keith Elwyn's

[08:57] King Kong.

[08:58] Now, I think one of those games, and maybe they're now going to consider a cornerstone

[09:03] because of how Metallica did.

[09:05] But I think one of those games is going to be Tron coming back into the Pimble world.

[09:10] With Dungeons and Dragons sales not being great and Ellie sales being pretty flat, that

[09:15] means D&D is not going to be a game that catches on and has a lot of sales momentum behind

[09:22] it.

[09:23] And so then what is Stern going to do over the next three and a half, four months between

[09:27] D&D on the line and King Kong?

[09:30] I think we might see, as Jason Knapp says, our turn of maybe something like Ghostbusters.

[09:37] Maybe they're going to bring Jaws 50th anniversary out to sort of bridge the gap.

[09:42] But all of these moves now get really interesting from Stern Pimble because they're not used

[09:48] to any of this.

[09:49] They're really not.

[09:50] You got to remember everybody, since I've been following this hobby, it's been about

[09:54] 12 years now.

[09:55] We've never seen Stern Pimble buyers lose so much money now over the last three years.

[10:01] This is unprecedented territory.

[10:04] And I think a lot of those buyers now have woken up and they know the new reality and

[10:10] they're just waiting on the sidelines.

[10:12] And the thing is this, as they wait on the sidelines and watch all these games lose so

[10:17] much value, it's not even a conversation about whether or not the game is good.

[10:22] It's not a conversation about whether or not it's fun or this or that.

[10:26] It's just a conversation around it makes no sense.

[10:29] When something makes no sense, you know what I'm saying?

[10:32] If there is a pizzeria, let's use an analogy.

[10:35] If there is a pizzeria that every single pizza pie was $100, would you even care to know

[10:43] how those pizzas taste?

[10:45] Would you even go in there and order one?

[10:48] And imagine this, that same pizzeria that makes those pizzas.

[10:52] Imagine if the next day, I'm just kind of truncating the timelines here.

[10:56] Imagine if the next day you could walk in and order the same pizza for like $50, would

[11:03] you go the day before if the next day you could get the same exact thing for so much

[11:07] less money and that's where we're at.

[11:10] And I know a lot of people don't want to have this conversation, right?

[11:12] They want to go back to the way pinball used to be and I would love to go back to the way

[11:16] pinball used to be in which when a new game came out, we really looked at the game and

[11:21] discussed it on its own merits, but it's impossible now to separate the reality of where we are.

[11:28] Because I don't want to see anyone get burned.

[11:29] I don't want to see anyone make a mistake.

[11:31] And I think it's putting everybody at peace.

[11:33] I think it's putting everybody at peace.

[11:36] I bet a lot of you coming out of the holidays don't want to spend more money right now.

[11:40] And the good news is you don't have to.

[11:42] All right, you really don't have.

[11:43] I think that's going to be what defines the next few months.

[11:46] We're going to start to see hopefully Alice's adventures in Wonderland go on the line at

[11:51] Dutch Pinball.

[11:52] We see all these parts from Leor coming in.

[11:56] And now they need to eventually this month, there's only three more weeks left.

[12:00] Get the game on the line if they want to get all 500 people, their machines by 2025.

[12:07] Now remember what they said.

[12:08] They said if we don't get you your machine, then your deposit is refundable, which is

[12:15] good.

[12:15] And we're seeing on pin side now people are still wanting to find spots.

[12:21] And when people want a spot for Alice, it seems like a spot opens up pretty quickly.

[12:26] You got to remember 500 people have not spent $12,500 on the game or whatever it is, $1299.

[12:34] Is it $1299 or $1250?

[12:36] They haven't spent anything other than $1,500 to pause it.

[12:39] And so when those 500 people get asked to pay in full, of course,

[12:45] there's going to be spots that open up.

[12:46] I do encourage each and every one of you to just be patient.

[12:51] If you want an Alice or an Evil Dead or a D&D, all three of those titles,

[12:56] you're going to be able to get one when you want one.

[12:59] Just wait till the games are made.

[13:01] Because that's the other thing too, right?

[13:03] Stern used to sell all these games, sell the LEDs out before a single one was even

[13:08] made. And now once again, they're in uncharted territory.

[13:12] They have to go make now 740 D&D LEDs.

[13:17] And they're going to make the LEDs first.

[13:20] And those games are not spoken for.

[13:22] And now these distributors are going to have to make a little bit of a difficult call.

[13:27] How many D&D LEDs do I want to have sitting in my warehouse where Stern is

[13:33] telling me I can't sell this game for below $12,999?

[13:40] And I know this game is never going to sell over that.

[13:44] So the old days, remember these distros who put games in vaults and then all of a

[13:48] sudden six months later, they've got a $19,000 Godzilla LE for you.

[13:54] Those days are over.

[13:56] And so if you're a distro or a dealer, how many LEDs are you going to order?

[14:01] How are you going to move all those LEDs?

[14:03] And then to get those LEDs, you got to place a big order for premiums and pros.

[14:09] And you also are now worried, well, how many people out there actually want to

[14:14] drop $9,700 on a D&D premium right now?

[14:19] And knowing that when King Kong comes out, that premium will be 7,500.

[14:24] So I say this to each and every one of you.

[14:26] Let the dealers and the distros take the risk.

[14:31] Let them order the game.

[14:33] And then you're going to be able to march in in just a few months and get any

[14:39] model you want of any pinball machine you want.

[14:42] It's not just D&D, any pinball machine you want.

[14:46] Watch how much cheaper they're going to become.

[14:49] It's going to be the year of the pinball buyer.

[14:52] You and I are going to have all the power in the world.

[14:56] It's not even going to be that hard to get a King Kong LE because it's going to be 13.

[15:02] I bet they raise the price on Kong.

[15:05] It'll probably be 13.6 and they're going to make a thousand of them.

[15:10] It's going to give you some second thoughts when they do Harry Potter CE and

[15:14] it's $15,000 and they make a thousand of them.

[15:19] It's going to be the same reaction.

[15:21] You know, I was watching a D&D video, you know, let's talk real quick about the

[15:25] Dwight video.

[15:26] Then I want to talk about some of these other nerd and geek YouTube channels

[15:30] have been promoting Stern's D&D.

[15:34] But look, I watched the Dwight video.

[15:36] I just don't really understand if Dwight really knows how to communicate a

[15:43] storyline.

[15:44] I'm not really sure what's going on inside his head.

[15:47] I think he's a really smart engineer.

[15:50] I think he's a really smart coder, but I think Dwight needs to be paired up with

[15:55] someone who has a little bit more basic common sense storytelling abilities.

[16:02] I feel like he's always all over the place.

[16:05] Even as I watch the streams of the game and watch him explain it, I do feel like

[16:11] it's just jumping all over the place.

[16:13] I'll give you an example.

[16:14] The way like you can just start dragon multi-ball.

[16:17] Why?

[16:18] If this is a D&D journey, shouldn't the dragon come out in unique moments?

[16:24] And that's when you battle it.

[16:26] But the way they start the multi-ball, which is just spelled dragon and then it

[16:29] starts, it reminds me of sort of smalg multi-ball in the hobbit and how easy it

[16:36] is to start that multi-ball.

[16:38] And is that just going to get annoying over time?

[16:42] How easy it is to do that.

[16:44] And you could tell, you could tell when you saw the CES stream today, it's like

[16:48] Stern really wants to show off the dragon in action.

[16:51] Right?

[16:52] So like, okay, let me show you how you start dragon multi-ball.

[16:54] And it is something that the player, the casual player can get to and see, which

[16:59] again, is important.

[17:00] When you have a major mech in a game, you should be able to experience it every time

[17:05] you play a game.

[17:05] Now, will that be fun in the long run?

[17:08] We don't know yet.

[17:09] Will the way this game is coded be fun for you in the long run?

[17:12] It's a lot of D&D.

[17:14] It's a lot of D&D.

[17:16] It's a lot of geeky things going on.

[17:18] It's a lot of missions and modes that are all about the D&D world.

[17:23] And I don't know yet.

[17:24] 

[17:24] I haven't really seen anything yet.

[17:26] That is truly really excited me or blown me away.

[17:30] And again, I think when I look at these modern

[17:33] Stearns right now, I'm still waiting for them to get better with the lighting.

[17:37] This game doesn't have expression lighting system in it.

[17:41] You know, there's nothing really new happening there.

[17:43] The dragon's mouth doesn't move.

[17:45] So when the dragon talks to you, it doesn't really create like a dynamic moment there.

[17:51] And people were showing how like the T-Rex could open and close its mouth all the time.

[17:55] Why couldn't they make the dragon do that?

[17:58] I get the dragon tracks you and that's really cool.

[18:01] It would have been nice to have seen both things happen.

[18:04] I like the shield that pops up.

[18:06] That's cool.

[18:07] But again, like I just don't know.

[18:09] I think like everybody else, I can't wait to jump on this machine

[18:12] because most of us don't have an emotional connection to D&D.

[18:16] I'm just not sure this thing is ever going to move us the way Lord of the Rings does.

[18:21] If you think about D&D versus Lord of the Rings,

[18:24] D&D has really cool mechs just like Lord of the Rings.

[18:27] But man, is this game ever going to get your energy level going?

[18:31] Are you ever going to feel excited in D&D the way you get excited to destroy the ring?

[18:37] And that's my worry about this game.

[18:40] And if I had $13,000 burning a hole in my pocket and I wanted a fantasy themed

[18:47] pinball machine that just nails it, I would offer to buy a Lord of the Rings

[18:53] LE for $13,000 and go find someone who brass plated it and put all the figures in it.

[19:01] I would rather own that.

[19:02] You know why? Because a Lord of the Rings LE will hold much better value than a D&D LE.

[19:09] I think everyone agrees about the artwork on D&D.

[19:12] They should have made the armor brass plated.

[19:14] It needs to be more special than this, everybody.

[19:16] I don't know what to tell you.

[19:17] I get it. It just doesn't look great.

[19:20] And I think that's another reason why.

[19:21] LEs are not flying off the shelf.

[19:24] It just doesn't look great, especially after Metallica.

[19:28] So as I was watching the Sharp CES video, I also was getting served up by YouTube.

[19:34] Other content creators in the geek space.

[19:37] There's this one nerd guy.

[19:38] I think it's like nerd impressionist or something like that.

[19:41] He wore a wizard hat.

[19:42] He has like 100,000 subscribers on YouTube.

[19:46] He talks all about the release of the game, but then he gets to the price.

[19:50] And this is the thing, right?

[19:51] He's like, I would love to have one of these, but man, there are 13,000.

[19:56] There's seven to 13,000 dollars.

[19:58] And then you read in the comments section and it's funny because it's only

[20:02] pinball people that already buy pinball machines that are defending the price.

[20:08] Everyone who's just a D&D fan is like, are you kidding me?

[20:12] Seven thousand dollars.

[20:14] Someone was like shocked that it cost seven thousand dollars.

[20:17] And then someone responds being like, dude, that's only the base level with stuff

[20:21] yanked out of it. If you want the top level, it's 13,000.

[20:25] And that's the reality, people, is as much as you think there's crossover.

[20:30] It's the same thing's going to happen with Pokemon.

[20:32] I get people spend a lot of money on rare Pokemon cards, but it's because they

[20:37] understand they understand the market and those cards make them feel good.

[20:41] They're not going to drop 15 or 13,000 dollars on a Pokemon pinball machine

[20:46] because, A, they don't even care about pinball and B,

[20:50] everyone who loves Pokemon collectibles is not going to like respect or hold it up

[20:54] as something worth having.

[20:55] So I just want to say to everybody out there, be patient.

[20:58] You're not going to have a hard time getting any of these games.

[21:01] And we got Tales of the Arabian Knights coming back from Padready Gaming.

[21:05] I heard this is going to happen in the next six months or so.

[21:08] It is the follow up to Funhouse.

[21:11] Are they going to have Brian Allen do the art package?

[21:14] I think they should leave the art package as it is.

[21:18] It's one of the most beautiful games from the Balli

[21:20] Williams era, so I don't think they should touch it.

[21:23] I don't think they should make a new art package for it.

[21:26] It had much better art to begin with than Funhouse.

[21:30] But I worry that they're going to have a new art package on it.

[21:34] I'm just going to say this. I don't think most people care.

[21:37] I don't think most people care about the Funhouse remake.

[21:40] When I put up the Toden image on my Facebook page, most people don't care.

[21:44] Nobody has even started a pin side thread that says,

[21:49] Canada is confirming that Toden is coming back from Padready Gaming.

[21:54] Now, maybe people don't care because it's Padready Gaming.

[21:57] Maybe they want CGC to remake it.

[21:59] CGC is going to make more medieval madness as soon.

[22:02] Then they're going to make Twilight Zone.

[22:04] Just feels like way too many people.

[22:06] All of these old games coming back, all of these new games coming out,

[22:10] everything's ten thousand dollars or more.

[22:13] I hope you guys all get like six figure bonuses because this whole hobby is about

[22:18] to just collapse under the weight of the extraordinary prices of everything new in

[22:24] box. Everyone who's buying these things is just buying such a big depreciating asset.

[22:29] It's going to be over sooner than you think.

[22:32] I don't mean the hobby is going to go away.

[22:34] I just mean these prices are going to have to go down.

[22:37] These prices are going to have to go down.

[22:39] It's just that simple.

[22:41] All right. What else is going on?

[22:42] Speaking of prices, there's a GoFundMe that just popped up to give Steve Bowden

[22:48] some money. Now, look, Steve Bowden was just let go by American Pinball.

[22:53] I'm not sure what's going on over there.

[22:55] People are getting fired and now the company is hiring people to make games.

[23:01] I'm confused.

[23:02] I have no line of sight into what's going on.

[23:05] Steve was let go and his dream of making pinball machine seems to have been

[23:10] thwarted and that is sad.

[23:12] I think we all need to have some empathy, you know, have some empathy for people.

[23:16] I think Ryan McQuade also sounds like in his Facebook post that he's also no longer

[23:22] at American Pinball.

[23:24] But here's the thing, as someone who has been fired three times in my career,

[23:28] my wife, Brenda, got let go at 5.30 in the morning by meta.

[23:33] Sixty thousand people lost their jobs in one day.

[23:36] When you're a well able bodied adult and you get let go,

[23:41] you got to just go find a new job.

[23:44] And I don't think we should be setting up GoFundMe pages for people that are

[23:48] well able bodied and can go get work.

[23:51] This isn't a tragedy.

[23:52] OK, I understand GoFundMe is when a tragedy hits somebody, but this is not it.

[23:58] I also want to say that Steve did not set this page up.

[24:01] So I don't think anyone should say anything negative about Steve.

[24:05] It's some dude in Toronto who's doing this.

[24:07] I don't agree with it.

[24:09] I don't give money like this.

[24:10] It actually, I think, is a negative.

[24:12] I think it turned Steve into a little bit of a charity case.

[24:16] He's not.

[24:17] And again, he didn't do it.

[24:18] I hope he finds employment somewhere in pinball.

[24:21] And with so many pinball companies out there and if you can add value,

[24:25] you'll find a job in pinball.

[24:27] It's just that simple.

[24:28] I think you just have to figure out how to add value.

[24:30] And the other thing too is you got to speak up.

[24:33] You got to speak up.

[24:34] I think a lot of people went over to American Pinball and they saw the themes

[24:38] that company was working on and they should have said something.

[24:42] They should have said something.

[24:43] We can't make this game and make money.

[24:45] This game is not going to be what we need to bring to market.

[24:48] We need to bring something with a lot more mainstream appeal.

[24:52] And they didn't.

[24:53] And that's it.

[24:54] That's it.

[24:55] Everybody's accountable.

[24:56] Everyone's got to be held accountable within a company.

[24:59] You guys are the ones who made the choices.

[25:01] It wasn't a podcaster.

[25:03] It wasn't anyone else.

[25:04] The reason why you guys aren't doing well is because of the choices all of you made.

[25:08] And ultimately, the market is brutal.

[25:11] Consumers will be brutal.

[25:14] If you don't bring a masterpiece into the pinball market, your game is going to be

[25:19] dead on arrival now.

[25:20] That's just the way it is.

[25:21] And when you go visit a company like Stern Pinball

[25:25] and you see how many people are putting so much work and effort into each game

[25:30] and you want to compete with these people, every decision you make needs to be spot

[25:35] on. You can't just wing it on any level.

[25:38] Can't wing it with what the theme will be, what the quality will be.

[25:42] No, it doesn't work anymore.

[25:44] Gang, it's 2025 now.

[25:46] None of you need more pinball machines.

[25:49] It's going to get really, really hard to sell games moving forward,

[25:53] especially at the prices, especially if the themes aren't great.

[25:58] And especially because I think a lot of you are just content.

[26:01] You've seen what this hobby has been like over the last decade or so.

[26:05] You realize that the Ellie flex is over.

[26:08] The special moment of a new launch is now over with in just a matter of hours.

[26:13] Right? It's like you see a new game.

[26:15] You see the videos.

[26:16] You hear all the hype.

[26:17] Nowadays, it just doesn't mean much anymore.

[26:19] It really doesn't.

[26:20] You're kind of over it in just a few hours.

[26:23] And the only value you're really getting in all of pinball

[26:26] is five dollars a month for Canada's pinball podcast.

[26:30] That's going to give you two to three great shows a week.

[26:32] Keep you entertained on the Patreon chat.

[26:34] Do a great free Saturday show all for five dollars a freaking month for most of you.

[26:40] It doesn't get any better than that.

[26:42] Don't forget to vote for Canada for

[26:45] favorite pinball content creator and favorite podcaster in the Chwippies.

[26:51] I'm not sure why I'm not eligible as favorite streamer, but whatever.

[26:55] Two out of three ain't bad, everybody.

[26:57] Have a great Monday.
