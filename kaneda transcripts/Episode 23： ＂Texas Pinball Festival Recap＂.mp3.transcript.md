[00:00] I'm pretty tired.

[00:05] I think I'll go home now.

[00:13] You don't know what tired is until you go to Texas Pinball festival and spend

[00:19] almost two full days on your feet playing Pinball, talking Pinball,

[00:25] late into the night.

[00:27] I wanted to give you guys just a recap of the Texas Pinball festival.

[00:31] I know I did a short one after day one.

[00:33] I was planning on doing one after day two, but I was just exhausted.

[00:37] There was just not enough time.

[00:39] It's Monday morning.

[00:40] I'm back in New York.

[00:41] I got in yesterday around five o'clock at night and I just hit the couch and then I just went to bed.

[00:48] Now I want to give you guys just some feedback on the show.

[00:53] This is not going to be a long podcast.

[00:55] I want to just give you guys some overall thoughts and we'll have additional episodes coming

[01:02] of Canadian Pinball podcast soon.

[01:03] That'll go a little bit deeper into interviews and what's going on in the industry and on Pinside itself.

[01:09] So what did I think of the show?

[01:11] I loved it.

[01:12] I think this show is absolutely amazing.

[01:14] It lived up to all of the hype that I've heard from people in from previous years.

[01:19] Tiger Law really was selling it very hard to me that I had to come down and go to the show.

[01:26] I think the reason why I loved it is it was comfortable to walk around this big venue and play all these games and talk to people.

[01:35] I never felt crammed.

[01:38] I never felt rushed.

[01:40] It had a great pace to it.

[01:43] You could almost decide what you wanted to do when you wanted to do it.

[01:46] If you wanted to go listen to people speak, they had so many speakers.

[01:50] My only regret, I'll say is my only regret is I wish I went to more of the seminars.

[01:55] I just, for some reason, I didn't feel like sitting down and listening to people talk about Pinball.

[02:01] But I should have because I'm looking at the calendar of speakers now.

[02:06] I'm like, oh man, I should have went in and heard that.

[02:09] I should have went in and heard that.

[02:11] I kind of went into this weekend and with two goals in mind.

[02:15] I just wanted to play as much Pinball as possible and I wanted to talk to as many people as possible.

[02:20] Because that's what I enjoy most about the shows.

[02:23] I think all the information that's learned from the seminars is quickly distributed throughout the forum.

[02:29] So you don't really miss out on that stuff.

[02:31] People will pull the highlights out and share it with the community.

[02:34] The one I did sit through was multi-morphic.

[02:37] We'll talk a little bit about them.

[02:40] But it's just a great show.

[02:42] I don't think I can say enough.

[02:43] There's great food, there's great people, there's great pinball.

[02:48] So it's definitely worth the trip.

[02:52] If those of you who are playing a go, I think if you're one of the people who are really into this hobby

[02:57] and you're on the forums constantly, I don't think there's a better show to hang out with everyone than Texas Pinball Festival.

[03:03] So again, thanks to Ed and Kim for putting on such an awesome show.

[03:08] So when I uploaded my podcast about after the first day, my two favorite games were Ghostbusters and Rob Zombie.

[03:15] And after another day and a half of playing, do I still feel that way?

[03:21] I think the answer is yes.

[03:23] I'd nothing really sort of changed my mind again because everything that I played there has been around for a while.

[03:29] And I've played it for many eons ago.

[03:33] I've played the Hobbit, I've played Lebowski, I've played P3.

[03:37] So I'm going to talk about each of those two a little bit.

[03:40] But there's just something about Ghostbusters that I've never seen a game at a show.

[03:46] I have such a constant line.

[03:48] And I mean, there was always about 10 people on each Ghostbusters line.

[03:53] There was two of them waiting to play.

[03:57] And that was awesome to see.

[03:59] I mean, there's just so much interest in the machine.

[04:02] But it was never a short line.

[04:05] And I think that's what was frustrating for those of us who wanted to play it more.

[04:09] It was a commitment.

[04:10] I think every time you got online, you probably had to wait a good 20 minutes plus before it was your turn to go.

[04:17] And as some have said, Ghostbusters is a challenging game.

[04:20] It's not a long ball time game.

[04:23] It's a game that can be pretty brutal if you miss your shots.

[04:26] But it's very rewarding and very fun when you do hit your shots.

[04:29] I didn't have any complaints.

[04:31] I think everyone when they're standing over that play field was a bit giddy and felt like a little child sort of standing over such a beautiful and fun pin.

[04:39] And I kept trying to think about what makes Ghostbusters so damn special.

[04:45] Like, why is this game so, so, so, so applauded at this stage?

[04:52] And, and has people in such a fever.

[04:54] And, you know, there's a few reasons why.

[04:57] And I think what's interesting too before jumping into those reasons, Ghostbusters are standing next to Spider-Man Vault Edition and Game of Thrones Premium, both of which never had anyone lined up the play.

[05:07] And it, it shows how, how newness and something that's completely fresh will steal our attention.

[05:15] And, and I think as, as hobbyists and for many of us out there who are collectors,

[05:21] there's something about that. We just want new stuff.

[05:24] And I think that freshness and that I've never played this before was definitely reflective in some of the other pins that were out the show that you can play them almost, I mean, the older pins you can play anywhere.

[05:37] And, and if you're near Barcaids and you're near like large pinball venues that have stuff, all those games are typically found out in the wild.

[05:45] But, Ghostbusters, again, you, we're one of the first people in the world to play it if we played it at TPS.

[05:51] So, so I think, you know, when I think about Ghostbusters and why people are so just over the moon for this pin, I think that pin sort of just checked off all the right boxes for people.

[06:01] And when you see it in person, even more so. So, first and foremost, number one, the pin needs to look beautiful.

[06:08] Artwork is just so important. There is something about seeing a pinball machine from a distance and it pulling you in.

[06:16] And there's been a lot of complaints about artwork on pinballs over the years, but it is great to see an incredible artist like Zambi Yeti discovered through his Zidware experience.

[06:28] And now having his artwork on a mass production machine, it's just so great to see that.

[06:34] Another thing is pinball needs to be fun the moment you plunge. And there's a lot of debate about this that a game doesn't necessarily have to give you that immediate gratification.

[06:46] And some games take a wild warm up too. And I understand that I'm not saying that those games aren't great either.

[06:51] But there still needs to be an element of pinball that when you first hit start, you hear the music, you hear the call out, and stuff starts happening that you are like pulled in new way.

[07:03] I do think the first five to ten minutes of a pinball machine is like the first chapter of a book. And it should be exciting even if you don't know what's going on.

[07:14] And that's the key part. I don't think anyone has any clue what's going on with Ghostfuss right now in terms of code and what's happening there.

[07:22] But it's fun. The colors, the lights, and the slimer going up and down, the music. And again, it has an advantage because once you hear that theme song, you're instantly transported back to that universe of Ghostbussers, which I think everyone pretty much loves.

[07:42] So I think the most important point though, and this is something that I think the hobby has sort of been debating now for a few months, if not a couple years.

[07:54] But pinball is below the glass. It is first and foremost a game that occurs below the glass.

[08:01] I know we hear Stern say this, we hear other people say this. But there's always so much moaning and groaning about displays and whatnot. And yes, like red dots are terrible. Nobody wants them.

[08:13] But when you walk up to a game, you want 95% of your attention to be down below the glass. And that's what Ghostbussers is. I don't think I heard anyone say red dots, red dots.

[08:26] In fact, the dots were so exciting. And I think people realize, well, pretty soon color DMD is going to transfer those dots over to a color system. And it's going to look incredible.

[08:37] And I honestly personally, the dots for me, the color dots, the color DMD section, which by the way was right next to Jersey Jack Pinball, a Texas Pinball Festival.

[08:48] And so it was interesting to see the, you know, having color DMD games versus Jack's fall was a 27 inch LCD and having them comparable within just a 20 foot radius to see which one works the best.

[09:03] You know, it's not about quality guys. It's not about how good the visuals work. It's like, what, what display works the best for pinball?

[09:10] And I really do think color DMD is phenomenal. And that's all you need. I don't really think you need these humongous displays like on highway or Jersey Jack. I really don't.

[09:21] Yes, they bring you in from a distance, but you don't need it that big, especially when you're looking down so much in the game.

[09:27] But the ultimate thing that I took away from the show is, and this is just how I feel about all pinball companies when they talk.

[09:36] And that's another reason why I didn't want to just go to all the seminars and listen to people who have intentions to build pinball machines, talk more about those intentions to build pinball machines.

[09:47] I think that we have reached a point now in this hobby where reveals need to occur, full reveals of a game need to recur, need to occur very closely to the date it is shipping.

[10:00] So by that, the game needs to be pretty much done ready to go on the line any week, and then you reveal it. It's the stern model, and it works really well.

[10:10] Spooky obviously revealed sooner than that, but because they had production ready, they revealed pretty much a game that was built also.

[10:20] They revealed it with a populated play field. I think that that needs to become the new standard. There needs to be more of that. Here it is.

[10:30] This is what it's going to look like. It's done. You can have it on this date, and that date is in the near future.

[10:37] And I think that's why there's so much excitement around Ghostbusters, first and foremost, this isn't a pinball machine where you can have it a year from now.

[10:47] You can have it a month from now people. I think that's what people are so excited is, they played the pin, they decided they like it or not, and then they get their checkbook out or they get their cash out.

[10:58] And that's how it should be. And I know, I know, you haven't played the premium, we haven't played the LE, and people who are buying the LE have to go in before playing it.

[11:06] But I think anyone who's read any of the feedback on Ghostbusters and people's response to the game, you are not going to be disappointed.

[11:14] You are not going to be disappointed. Trust me, they pro is so much fun to play out. And the LE is not going to change gameplay at all. It's just going to add more fun features.

[11:23] I mean, there's a little bit, of course, like the magnetic slings and whatnot, but the gameplay changes are not going to significantly change the layout of the play field.

[11:31] Let's say the way Game of Thrones pro and LE had a significantly different play field without huge upper play field.

[11:40] So Ghostbusters remain my favorite, and I also still loved Rob Zombie. I didn't find a second pin that was as much fun. And I'll tell you why I love Rob Zombie.

[11:49] Rob Zombie, more than, you know, look, Spooky is, I still consider Spooky to be a little bit below like a Stern pro in terms of what they bring.

[11:59] And I think they're appropriately priced considered, you know, the quality of materials used in Spooky compared to what you're getting in other manufacturers.

[12:09] So they're in the right price point. I do think they could even charge more. And I've said this before because of how limited they are though.

[12:15] Obviously when you drive the production number down, you can drive the price off. And you want to get to that point where there's one more person you demand, so then you can supply it. And then you're gold in.

[12:24] But here's why I like Rob Zombie. It's just a fun, fun social game that is great to grab some beers and grab like three buddies and just play.

[12:36] And that's what I saw at Spooky's booth. Like Spooky's booth. The reason why I loved it. It just felt like a hangout.

[12:43] And everyone was always having fun. Charlie was there most of the time. Ben Heck was there most of the time. Like the people were there.

[12:49] And they're sold out. They're not even trying to sell you something and they were there all the time hanging out having a good time.

[12:57] I walked around that show floor so many times. I saw the Dutch guys were hanging around the basket more. I never saw Andrew around his games at highway.

[13:07] I never really saw Jack buy the hobbit very much. It didn't feel like those companies were there wanting to hang with you and bring you into the family.

[13:17] And I think that goes a long, long way. But again, you can't manufacture that kind of social behavior. It's inherent in Spooky.

[13:28] I bought a sweatshirt from Spooky because I just loved hanging out with them. They were such nice people. And it's great.

[13:37] I think, you know, lessen learned to all these companies be around your product. The P3 guys were all there at all times. Jerry was there. I always saw him there every minute in the booth talking to people.

[13:48] His guys with P3 shirts on were there. Multimorphic shirts were there all the time hanging out. That's how it needs to be if you want to sort of build a rapport with your customer embrace and sell to them.

[13:58] So those two games, I'm super happy that both of those games are very successful. They're going to be very successful. Rob Zombie can't get more successful than it is.

[14:12] And, you know, so what else did I think about the show?

[14:16] So I want to just sort of give my thoughts on what else was happening at the show. Let's talk about the tournament for a minute.

[14:27] So I entered the tournament. And this is the first time I've ever entered a Pimbal tournament at an X-Bellware convention. And I had no idea what to do.

[14:37] When I first got up there, I think I asked some guy, like, what do I do to play? I thought, you know, I signed up. I do. And he's like, well, you go to this website, you put your name in the queue, you put your pen in here. And I'm like, what, what, what?

[14:49] Like, I was so, so confused that I actually just like walked away. I'm like, I'm not doing all this. I don't care. Like, I'll just kiss the 60 bucks goodbye.

[14:58] But then I talked to some more people. This really, really nice guy Dave. Dave actually was in the tournament. Dave ended up finishing. I think he finished six.

[15:07] He's big in the street fight or awesome, dude. I saw him at the show just playing constantly. But he told me how you can do it. He's like, just walk up. Just tell, they'll put you into the queue.

[15:17] You don't have to do anything with your phone. You don't have to do anything. You play, you get in line. They call you on your ready. And then you raise your hand when your score is on. And that was simple. So I was like, all right. So I jumped in.

[15:27] So I get there. And there is pretty much long cues on all the modern games. So I think there was a game of thrones there.

[15:36] What else was there? I'm just drawing a blank now. What the row of of tournament games was.

[15:42] And so I just said like, look, just put me on whatever those like the shortest queue because I just want to play. I suck at Pimble. There's no way I was going to qualify for the finals.

[15:50] So I ended up playing like Bramstrucker's Dracula six times in a row. And then I think Demolition Man six times a row. And then some older EM games like Cleopatra and a couple other games.

[16:00] I have fun. It was good. I was just up there. And it was just me about it was more about me trying to set my top my last score on the machine. And I had a good time.

[16:11] Then you know the qualifying I think around ended at five o'clock on Saturday. Then the tournament occurred at six o'clock on Saturday.

[16:21] And it was it was fun. I saw Nate shivers and Jack danger where we're running the tournament. I'll say this though like for those guys playing in the tournament.

[16:30] My God. You guys really really really have a lot of patience because not only is there all that waiting in the line on Friday and Saturday during the qualifying rounds to like set scores.

[16:40] You're then also like waiting or not waiting. But yeah, even waiting like your the hours and hours it takes to engage in the tournament is a test of of someone's sort of physical abilities.

[16:55] We went for dinner. I think we left it around 7 30 to go eat at the steakhouse across the street with Tiger Lobhoff and a bunch of other cool people.

[17:06] And we were like, oh, we'll get back for the tournament and when the tournament ends and the tournament started at six. I think it ended.

[17:13] I want to say like after 10 o'clock at night. And when I when I got there is actually the first time I got to say hi to Nate shivers from Costa Coast Pimball.

[17:21] He just looks so tired. I was like, oh man, like you've been doing the tournament sort of commentary for for four plus hours now. I mean that is that is really really hard.

[17:35] There's there's no sporting event where the commentators have to go further than four hours on it. It's just it's a big time suck.

[17:44] But everyone looked like they have fun. There's a little bit of controversy. I heard from some people that the person who set up the tournament, he set up the games also won the tournament.

[17:53] But I don't think so. I mean at the end of the day it's you know he's also a really really good player and it's it's it's it's for $2,800.

[18:04] I think everyone had a good time playing that tournament. What I do what I do recommend though is there should be other types of tournaments during the show that are not geared towards just the the finding the best player.

[18:17] I think you can do kind of fun wacky tournaments. I can also like you know make the let the casual player jump on and compete and then have fun.

[18:25] And even like those kinds of things should should happen at like booths. You know we're going to have a tournament on Rob Zombie and whoever you know one ball each and whoever gets the best score like wins the t-shirt like just.

[18:36] Having little mini tournaments within the larger festival would be fun to sort of pull people in and and and get them to jump on.

[18:44] But that was the tournament. It was it was I didn't really watch it. I sort of saw the beginning the qualifying in the end but it's just not competitive pinball is just not for me.

[18:57] I mean I want to get better at pinball and I do want to compete with my friends but entering these tournaments I can see why people love it. I just don't think it's going to be how I'm going to use my time when I go to these shows.

[19:08] But I'll happily watch it and I and I think it's great that people are want to just keep getting better and better and better at the skill of pinball. I think I think it's just awesome.

[19:19] What else I miss the alien seminar where they showcase the xenomorph head.

[19:26] That head. People are saying that the image is true to scale. I mean it almost looks like it's the size of football.

[19:35] It looks really cool and really detailed but like others out there I just kind of have to wait to see the populated play field to make up my opinion.

[19:47] I just can't it's this game it's just I just don't want to make more judgments on it based upon little reveals here and there and I think everyone feels the same way about alien.

[19:58] You can't follow up ghostbuster reveal which was just like pull the curtain off here it is and it was amazing.

[20:05] You can't follow up your marketing efforts with these slow trickle-down reveals. I'm sorry guys like you got it got it got it just go dark for a while.

[20:15] Get it all together screw together and show us it the way it was intended to be. I heard from people who saw the video. I did not catch the video.

[20:25] We heard a lot of hype about that video beforehand I was going to blow people away. I got Luke warm responses some people thought it was cool somewhere.

[20:33] I think the main feedback I got from everybody was it's still hard to kind of see what's going on. It looked very dark the pinball machine and I know they're going for this outer space or lost in space vibe which fits alien perfectly.

[20:47] But people do get concerned when pinball machines try to go dark in the theme because it is very hard to track and see the ball.

[20:54] But there's nothing really left to say with alien I think it's in the day we all want to see the popular playfield we all want to make our opinions about the final package and it's complete form and if I could recommend Andrews just stop with like every little thing and just wait.

[21:10] Put it all together get approval from fox and then show us the pinball in the right way and do it in a way that capture the capture the game and capture those assets in the right way don't just stand next to it and take photos and take photos with camera like cell phone cameras I mean really really really capture this labor of love with the right kind of assets to to to to excite people.

[21:34] What else I want to talk about p3 for a minute because I spent the most time in that seminar and lasted about two hours.

[21:42] And we had lunch and and Jerry talked about the system and here's what I want to do I initially was going to just give my blanket feedback on multi morpheck and what I saw but I don't want to do that I want to get Jerry on the show and I want to have a conversation with him about multi morpheck for those of you who haven't seen the news they reveal that there's going to be I want to say.

[22:03] Four more games are release during or sort of released on the platform during launch and I'm just pulling up the notes on my phone because I took down what those games were.

[22:16] So there's a game called cannon lagoon which is a very sort of simple game where you're shooting cannons at pirate ships and then again these games are meant more to show that these they're more for kids and he actually brought up young kids to play in the show easy it is and simple it is the play.

[22:32] These games which I agree with because if you think about it there's no pinball out there that young kids can get into and really feel like they're accomplishing much and I'm talking young kids okay not not your not your 13 year old completely gets the code of the walking dead people I'm talking you have a six year old you have a seven year old who wants to play pinball.

[22:50] So you got can cannon lagoon barn yard which is this game where cow animals are going across the farm and you hit the ball and knock them over and then rocks which is a really cool game where rocks are floating in sort of in space and you have to shoot them before they hit your flippers.

[23:06] So Jerry showed that he talked a lot about how multi-mortem is the most innovative the most developer friendly the best price per game the best use of space is the best modular system.

[23:21] You know you also announced that p3 is in pre-production phase and I don't I couldn't help but chuckle a little bit when I hear stuff like we're in pre-production.

[23:31] I don't after the last three years of pinball I don't think anyone even knows what pre-production means anymore when you say your pre-production what what does that mean to me.

[23:40] You're about to go into production so I just I just wouldn't use terms like that anymore for people because it doesn't carry any weight anymore people have people are people always say they're about to go into production and pinball and they always miss that mark or there's delays that go into the years so I just I just think you need to not say anything any of these companies until you're saying we're all

[24:00] on the line. Okay nothing nothing else really matters the whole we're close to getting on the line doesn't mean anything anymore but the design is complete and you know so we showed off the game you showed how the modular come out and some of them are really cool like to repair the flippers the way the modular just sort of like a almost like a 16 inch panel slides out from the

[24:21] front of the machine that is the whole flipper mechanism you can just slide a new one in so that if you have any flipper issues or something you know it goes wrong you don't have to bring out the soldering iron you don't have to replace coils and I really I really think there's some cool stuff going on there.

[24:37] He also showed how the the back one third of the play field that where the ramps are and where the you know the bumpers are that that pulls up and you can pop a new one in pretty quickly it's just two cables that unlatch so that

[24:51] that is you know really cool so here's you know I don't want to go too deep and I think we've all seen P3 we've all seen multi-morphic I jumped on it a bunch I played it it it definitely is is an interesting pinball experience for sure and I and I I talked to Jerry he came over to me and I said this to him I said you know I kind of think you need a license game I think you need a game that's going to make people want to have to own it and I'm not sure those games are there yet and he was talking about you know the

[25:21] prices of the license and I understand that and so here's here's like my overall take on multi-morphic after sitting through the whole presentation I think it's really cool that there can be a platformer out there that people can design games for and bring those games to market but it all hinges on one thing and I want to ask this question when I get them on for people to take the time and to put in the effort and to invest the money to make games for it and to and to make you know that that top of the play field with the

[25:51] mechanisms which is not cheap to make those things and to engineer them and design them and make sure they work there has to be a user base okay there has to be a user base to do that it is his his model his system is very much like the video game

[26:07] industry someone is not going to develop a game for a platform that doesn't have a lot of users because if I'm going to sell let's say back in the day you had a

[26:17] tarry Jaguar and you had PlayStation and a tarry Jaguar even though it was Harold it is being like 64 bid and best graphics if nobody owned a tarry Jaguar and I'm making a game am I going to make a game that works on Sony's platform or make a game that works on a

[26:33] tarry and it's not like that because there aren't any other you know systems out there are platforms out there that are allowing people to throw games on it so he's like the only sort of

[26:43] plaque like you know open platform system in a world where everything else is closed platform where it's it's companies making their own games so that's an uphill battle and I and it's going

[26:56] to be interesting to see if you can get the user base on board and I think it's going to be hard to get the user base at the price and that's the challenge he's going to face and I and it's not it's going

[27:10] to be up to you guys out there who have your money and want pinball innovation he's given you pinball innovation so this is a different way to think about pinball this is a

[27:19] different way to think about your games he's done a lot of cool things with showing how easy it is a swap out the art the swap new games and and you know I I think it's

[27:31] going to be a challenge I think it around 10 grand that's going to be hard I also when we were at the seminar there was like a deal at the show that Jerry was doing where if you buy now you get on the weight the

[27:44] pre-order list now you get all the games for free bundled in with Lexi lights we that deals only available during the show and I just kind of was like I mean I'm in marketing and I this is what I do for

[27:58] living come up with ideas that entice people to act and I couldn't help but feel just a little bit like come on really man because here's why the pre-order list for multi-morphic is just giving them your email address there's no money down

[28:13] so all that incentive is is to build a mailing list out so if you get if you get in on it at Texas pinball festival you get all five games and all you had to do is give your email address so it's one of these like well why wouldn't anybody do that

[28:29] right okay so then it's like well but why would someone do that because they're not like pre-ordering an L.A. or something specific but but here's the thing that I feel I was like as a marketer I'm like I really like how's this going to help you guys because here's why if I'm Jerry I really feel like I need to start knowing how many people are really in on it and I believe that the reason why people do take like the deposit money

[28:57] even if it's not a big amount the way android highway took I think 1500 for alien L.E. somewhat like spooky took a thousand on rob zombie you need to have more of a clear indication of who's really going to come get your pin if he's just getting a bunch of email addresses with no money down how can he project what is potential buyer base is going to be because 99% of those people could flee the second you asked them for like a $2,000 deposit

[29:26] you know as their game is about to get on the line and then all of a sudden you're kind of screwed because you've ordered all these parts and you have no idea like who's like in on it and everyone can just flee those shores so I you know I want to talk to Jerry I think that's going to be the big hurdle is just getting the system out there on the platform out there and like all new to market innovations a lot of times you just have to have a loss leader to get it into people's hands

[29:53] the way Microsoft took every single they took a loss in every single Xbox sold just to get into the market but they could be because I billions and you know the bank from from windows so it's hard it's hard hard hard to do what he's doing but I love the passion of the enthusiasm and I love to talk to him more about how he sees for this unfolding.

[30:14] Let's see just a few more things I'll let you guys go I don't want this podcast to be too long I saw that and I'm upset by an ad I saw in the for sure that said the big Lebowski pinball now shipping it said the big Lebowski now shipping I think it was the coin take your ad it's not shipping I hate hate hate when I see companies saying they're shipping when they're not that's just complete BS they shouldn't be allowed to print that if they do print that I think it's just again.

[30:44] It's meant to get people to throw orders in on something that is not shipping so guys when you're companies out there don't say you're shipping until you're shipping don't give a release to you have a release date that means the product is on the line.

[30:58] So big Lebowski advertising to coin take your shame on you you should have changed that ad I know you could have changed that ad up to a couple weeks ago because I also put my ad in a couple weeks ago so there's no excuse for running a false advertisement that your game is now shipping as far as Lebowski goes.

[31:13] Game looks great as always there was a huge line on it I do have questions about their path to production I think it's going to be a big issue for them that their contract manufacturing the thing it's going to be really really hard for them to control price on that kind of thing and I don't know we'll see how it all goes I hope that game ships soon but I am just tired of hearing about it shipping and I've seen it for so long that I don't really get that excited anymore by it I got to be honest.

[31:39] The Hobbit I'm glad the hobbit shipping I played a few games on it yesterday I don't know what people are saying when they say I don't know what you're talking about can it plays fast it the game again played really slow really floaty there was not a lot of flipper strength everyone I played it with said the same thing so take that for what you will Jack said these games up I saw Jack there it's I don't know what to do anymore I really don't I how many times how many different hobbies do I play.

[32:08] Where are the same exact experience where the J.Y.P fanboys are going to jump on the form and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about the game Fey's fast so maybe the bass for you I don't what you

[32:21] plan I just I want that game to be and homies in farming to get reviews from people because you came there so much going on the screen and there's so much to figure out that you just can't do it at a show and can't hear properly so there's that what else

[32:34] What else what else.

[32:36] love the show, the highlight of my whole show,

[32:39] the highlight of everything for me.

[32:41] And this just happened like serendipitously.

[32:44] I was leaving and I looked over and I saw George Gomez

[32:49] just outside by the lobby area of the Embassy Suites.

[32:55] And I said, go in the airport, he's like, yeah,

[32:57] he's like, you want to share a taxi?

[32:58] Like, yeah, let's do it.

[33:00] So I got to ride in a cab all the way back to the airport

[33:04] and talk Pimbal with George Gomez.

[33:05] And it was just awesome.

[33:07] It was, the man is so smart, he's so articulate

[33:10] and just hearing about his experience in the hobby

[33:13] and I feel like Stern is, you know,

[33:15] they just, they have such great knowledge.

[33:17] A lot of times people are quick to be like,

[33:19] Stern this, Stern that and question them

[33:21] and question pricing.

[33:22] But let's be honest guys, like nobody has any idea

[33:25] how to really build and ship a Pimbal machine

[33:28] like Stern does.

[33:29] And these guys, they understand the realities of Pimbal,

[33:32] oftentimes as realities or things that people

[33:35] in the hobby and the community don't want to admit.

[33:37] Because I think everyone bought the hype

[33:39] that people could do it better

[33:40] and people could do it more innovative

[33:44] and people could bring, you know, a Stern beater to the market.

[33:47] And it hasn't happened guys.

[33:50] It hasn't happened and these guys know what they're doing.

[33:52] And now to beat Stern, to beat Ghostbusters,

[33:55] to beat Stern in their own game, the bar is so high.

[33:58] I really, really do think that these companies

[34:00] like Highway, who remember guys,

[34:03] Highway was announced in 2012.

[34:06] So they've had four years.

[34:09] And in 2012, I think Stern was much more vulnerable

[34:12] to the kinds of innovation that these guys are bringing.

[34:14] I think everyone else is severely late to market

[34:17] and realize the realities of building a new Pimbal machine

[34:21] are super difficult.

[34:22] And I think the window really did close on people.

[34:25] I think now these companies who have shown their game now

[34:28] for years, stuff just looks like tired,

[34:30] it looks a little old.

[34:32] And Stern is going to be on to the next.

[34:34] I mean, Ghostbusters ships, they're going to be on to the next.

[34:36] They're going to be on to the next.

[34:37] By the time this year ends, there's going to be two or three

[34:39] more ghosts, or not two or three more Stern machines

[34:42] that we can go buy.

[34:44] And that's amazing.

[34:46] And the rest of these guys are just still going to struggle

[34:48] to get out the pin that we've seen for years.

[34:50] So I don't want to go into that too much.

[34:52] I want to, Joe, Georgia, to come on the show,

[34:54] which I think is awesome.

[34:55] I might hold them to that.

[34:57] And I met a lot of people that are going to come on the show.

[34:59] And that's the other thing about TPS, that was great for me.

[35:01] I met a lot of people that I'm going to interview.

[35:04] I want to close by saying, if you haven't been the TPS,

[35:07] you should definitely go.

[35:09] It's a great, great show.

[35:10] It's about the people.

[35:12] And this hobby is all about the people.

[35:14] And when we can get together and talk pinball, it's great.

[35:19] It's so much more productive than when

[35:21] we go on the forums, and we talk about pinball there.

[35:24] A quick example of that before I go is someone

[35:27] will say to me, or someone will say,

[35:29] I just bought a full throttle.

[35:31] And on the forum, someone will be like,

[35:33] why would you buy that piece of shit?

[35:34] You're an idiot.

[35:35] That would be the response on Pinside by a lot of people.

[35:38] But in real life, you're like, oh, yeah.

[35:41] Why?

[35:41] Why would you buy it?

[35:42] What do you like about it?

[35:43] I wouldn't buy one, but that doesn't

[35:44] mean I'm going to tell someone who they did buy it

[35:47] that they're silly for buying it.

[35:50] And I think when you bring that forum behavior

[35:52] onto the real world, no one wants to hang out with you.

[36:00] And one last thing too, I saw that why I snow in Hilton

[36:03] said that 50% of the games that Texas pinball festival

[36:07] weren't really operating properly.

[36:09] I don't think Hilton knows what 50% is.

[36:11] Guys, go to the show.

[36:13] Most of the games were working at all times.

[36:15] People were playing at all times.

[36:16] I'd say like 90% of games were operating at all times.

[36:20] Shame on you, Hilton.

[36:20] Come on, man.

[36:21] You're making that number of.

[36:23] 50% means this game is working.

[36:25] The game next to it is.

[36:26] And this game is working.

[36:27] The game next to it is.

[36:29] How can you say that number?

[36:31] I feel like part of this podcast is going to constantly

[36:35] just help Hilton stop saying things

[36:38] and think before he speaks about some of this stuff.

[36:41] All right.

[36:42] He's a nice guy.

[36:43] But just take a little bit before you say stuff like 50%

[36:46] of the games weren't working.

[36:47] Guys, that's it.

[36:47] Monday, hope you all have a good week.

[36:50] And look for some more interviews coming up

[36:52] on Canada's pinball podcast soon.

[36:54] We'll talk to you real soon.
