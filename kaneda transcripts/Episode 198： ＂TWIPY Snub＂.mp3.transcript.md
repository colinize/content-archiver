[00:00] Good Monday morning everybody. Welcome to Knatus Pinball Podcast. I have a podcast that

[00:24] I was going to upload this morning, but I'm waiting to get final approval on the interview

[00:29] that I did. I'm really excited to air this interview with you guys because I think you're

[00:33] going to find this guest to be a very unlikely guest of the show and it was no other than Dave

[00:40] Sanders lead designer at Highway Pinball. I had a great chat with Dave yesterday. We spent

[00:45] a little bit over an hour talking, you know, somewhat about Highway Pinball, somewhat

[00:49] about the industry, but I really respect Dave for coming on the show and sharing his opinions

[00:53] and his thoughts on the hobby. You know, look, I'll say this. We've been really strident

[01:00] against a lot of the different things happening over at Highway Pinball, but there's also

[01:04] a lot of people that are working at these companies that are trying to make it work. They

[01:09] are trying to make it work and they have not been dealt a great hand by Andrew who has

[01:14] now departed from the company and all I ever wanted on this podcast, I just want people

[01:20] to get their games. I want people to get their games. I think when you pay money for

[01:24] something, you shouldn't be on a train wreck for years where you're stressed out, where

[01:31] you're anxious, you're having sleepless nights. When you pay money for a toy like a pinball

[01:36] machine, I just want people to get it. And for all the companies out there that say they're

[01:41] going to make pinball machines and take people's money, you either better deliver or go away.

[01:46] I mean, that's sort of been my point of view on this hobby since I joined it is I've

[01:51] never seen a hobby where there's so many shenanigan companies out there asking for people's

[01:56] money and then failing to deliver. So I think you're going to enjoy the interview with Dave.

[02:01] He's listening to it today. Hopefully we'll get it up sometime early this week, but I hope

[02:06] I know you're going to enjoy that. So here's what I want to do in this little snackable

[02:10] edition of Canadian pinball podcast. I want to read some of your user mail that I've got.

[02:15] I want to just go through pinside and see what news has been percolating through the hobby.

[02:21] And then I also want to talk about something that was some people I've been sharing with

[02:25] me that I just thought was a little disappointing. Maybe I'll start there. Okay. So when the

[02:32] Twippy Awards were announced, you know, it was really exciting that there was going to

[02:38] be a recognition of pinball out in the world, not only of the games that we love, but the

[02:44] personalities that help make the pinball content that we all enjoy, you know, available

[02:51] to us on a weekly basis. You know, and I've always said this, I think anybody out there

[02:56] who makes pinball content, right, who takes some of their free time to create stuff that

[03:02] either helps you learn about pinball or maybe helps entertain you about the hobby and

[03:08] just sort of gives up their free time to create something that is for other people's enjoyment.

[03:14] I salute all the people that do that. Okay. A few years ago, when I started this podcast,

[03:20] the really the only pinball podcasts that were out there, we had coast to coast with Nate

[03:26] Shivers, we had spooky pinball podcasts. I think we had the pinball podcast. We had the

[03:32] pinheads podcast with the Z or Z or however they say it. And I love them all, right. There

[03:38] was really an ability to almost listen to everything out there because there wasn't that

[03:43] much of it. And since then, I think since then there's been an explosion in people who

[03:49] are so passionate about pinball that they want to pick up a microphone or a camera and

[03:56] either record a podcast or make a YouTube channel or a Twitch stream showing their passion

[04:02] for the hobby. And I applaud all the people who do that. And I've always said this, I listen

[04:07] to so many people out there and watch so much content. Now, it was brought to my attention

[04:13] that a couple of the pinball podcasts out there that I actually listened to and enjoy

[04:17] sort of ignored or snubbed Canadian pinball podcasts when they talked about the Twippy

[04:24] results. I heard that slam tilt, who I love slam tilt. Oh my, apparently when they

[04:33] read the results of all the Twippy finalists, they simply omitted who won the best pinball

[04:39] podcast. And the same thing happened with Buffalo pinball podcast. And you know, people,

[04:45] I think people bring this to my attention as if I don't know why they would do that. I mean,

[04:51] I'm not mad at those guys. I actually enjoy their stuff. I really do. I think what they

[04:55] create is phenomenal. And I think when I won, I was very humbled that so many of you out

[05:00] there voted for me. I don't think there's like this victory, right. There's not the best

[05:06] in the world. There is so much good content out there. So I really am disappointed in a

[05:14] little bit that these guys like just sort of won't even say my name because it's not,

[05:20] it's not, I just think it's sort of funny how when I was kicked off of Pinside and when

[05:26] I was rejected by that community, everyone thought that I was just this troll who added

[05:32] no value, who would just go away. And I worked really hard. And I've worked really hard

[05:36] over the last couple years to do this podcast to evolve as a podcaster to sort of provide

[05:45] a commentary on the hobby that I think has got has got to a good place, right. I think

[05:52] some of you might have loved the more stride in sort of crazy, creative from yesterday

[05:56] years. I think most of you appreciate more of the fair and balanced and sort of emotionally

[06:02] even keel version of this podcast. That is the more recent version of it. But for the

[06:08] most part, for the most part, I just want to say to those other podcasters out there that,

[06:15] you know, I don't have any ill will against anybody. I'm glad you do what you do. But I

[06:19] also think that sometimes people fail to understand why people like this show. All right.

[06:26] I'm not I'm not the most educated on the history of Pimbal. I am not the best Pimbal

[06:32] player in the world. I am not obsessed with tournament player rule sets and all that stuff.

[06:39] I think what I do differently than everybody else out there is I try to look at this hobby

[06:43] a little bit objectively and sort of fairly. And I think I hold companies and personalities.

[06:52] I think I hold them to some sort of honest standard about, you know, I'm going to say

[06:56] stuff that's not going to always be positive about a company or people that I think deserve

[07:02] to be called out. I mean, think about it for a minute. Mike from Home Pim says all those

[07:07] things, right? Homophobic stuff, racist things. And nobody even calls them out. Not even

[07:13] not even people like on the OCR Kate form like where he's from. You know, it's like this

[07:18] little podcast that I have, I think exposed something that needed to be exposed in this

[07:23] hobby. Same is true with highway Pimbal when I talked about some of the stuff going on

[07:28] over there. Same is true with Dutch Pimbal. I don't think just cheerleading about the

[07:33] hobby off to the side is what the hobby always needs. Now, look, I think we should be mostly

[07:40] positive about Pimbal because it is a toy meant to create enjoyment. But I think we also

[07:46] have an obligation to keep people honest and to call people out when they deserve to be

[07:52] called out. So look, long story short, I love those other two podcasts. I wish they

[07:59] would have included my Twippy award mentioned when they did a recap of the Twippy awards. I

[08:04] think omitting it is unfortunate. But again, no hard feelings. If I see these guys at shows,

[08:11] I'll happily shake their hands and congratulate them on all the great episodes that they've

[08:15] put up. Because we, again, we're a friend of every Pimbal podcast that is out there.

[08:21] Alright, let's move on to what else is going on. So have you guys recovered yet from all

[08:26] the deep root stuff that we learned last week? And you know, I was sort of wondering what

[08:32] people's feedback would be. And if people really would start to see the true colors of

[08:36] Robert over there because I've seen some stuff and I've seen some stuff and I've seen

[08:41] the way he's communicated with some people behind the scenes when it comes to the Zidware

[08:46] litigation and trying to get rights for Zambi Yeti's artwork and all the stuff that he's

[08:50] talking about. And I know that when you read the interview with this week in Pimbal, you

[08:57] know, Robert comes across as a pretty, how do you say this? Err, not arrogant. I mean,

[09:03] I would say like overly confident individual who seems like very bullish on deep roots,

[09:11] ability to sort of transform this industry and do something no one's ever done before.

[09:16] But I know there's another side to Robert that is, it's very, very ego driven. And I was

[09:21] like wondering if he would do something that would expose that side of him because I've

[09:25] said it to him before. It is the ego that will get him in the trouble because as we know

[09:31] in this hobby, it's a very small community. It's a very small hobby and you need to make

[09:38] people not hate you if you want a successful Pimbal company, right? That's just the reality

[09:46] of this industry. So I'm always sort of perplexed when individuals come out like Mike did

[09:54] at home pin and just act like they don't give a shit with people think or just say stuff

[09:58] that makes absolutely no sense if you are trying to be the leader of a Pimbal company.

[10:03] So the thing that I'm referring to is Robert Mulear over at Deep Root, basically taking

[10:09] credit for Elvira 3. He's like, if you want, you know, you can thank me for that because

[10:15] I mentioned it to Dennis that he should make Elvira 3. And it's just like, really, that's

[10:21] what you're going to chime in on, on Pinside, under the Deep Root handle, you're going

[10:27] to take credit for Elvira 3. And it's just that kind of arrogance and ego that is going to,

[10:34] I believe, make this company struggle to accomplish anything because what does that even mean?

[10:43] Like you think Dennis Nordman didn't ever think, oh, maybe we should revisit Elvira since people

[10:48] love those two games. Like he needed you to inform him that making another version of his most

[10:56] popular titles, like that's just like, man, how did you ever think about that, Robert?

[11:00] How did you come up with that conclusion? Hey, maybe we should make a third Star Wars movie,

[11:04] guys, like you can thank me for that. But here's the thing too, you know, I love how like now Robert

[11:10] is actually saying, and if you read what he's saying, he's actually saying he's also a Pimbal

[11:15] designer, guys. He's not just a successful businessman, he's a Pimbal designer, he actually

[11:21] sketched out what Elvira 3 could be. Whoa, man, like is there anything this guy can't do between

[11:27] Pimbal designing, between being a financial success, between grabbing Dennis and Barry and John

[11:35] Norris and David feel he's brought everybody over. I mean, it's unbelievable. What, what, there's

[11:43] no stopping him. He's got quad manufacturing about to go on, all this stuff, all this stuff.

[11:49] And look, I think all of you, I can tell by the lack of actual conversation going on in

[11:55] Pinside, we've seen this movie before. We know how this rodeo ends. Every single time someone comes

[12:04] out and makes bold claims like this, it always ends up in the same place and that is absolute

[12:11] disaster. He has no idea how to make four to five games cheaply that are going to be the quality

[12:17] of like Jersey Jack machines and then have them all launch in 2019. Good luck. As I said,

[12:24] I hope they prove all of us wrong. I will be customer number one if they can do that,

[12:30] but I just think it's absolutely ridiculous that he's taking credit for Elvira 3. And look,

[12:35] now I bet we're never going to hear from him ever again. This is what they do. They come on

[12:40] and they get, they get bitch slapped by guys like crazy levy. You know what I love too? This is sort

[12:45] of like the good side of Hilton. And again, I said Hilton is not a bad guy, but I love watching

[12:52] Hilton troll the F out of deep roots. See, that's where like Hilton has his value. If he would just

[12:59] learn instead of shilling for guys like Andrew Highway and Kevin Cool, like if Hilton would just

[13:04] go on the offensive against guys like Robert, then he would understand his true potential as a

[13:12] pinball superhero. See, he's when he's pointed in the right direction, Hilton actually has an

[13:17] incredible value for the hobby. All right. What else is going on in the pinball world? So Houdini's

[13:23] are starting to ship. That is good. We're starting to see more and more of them go out. Not a ton of

[13:28] them. Not a ton of them. It seems that distributors are getting them first and putting them on location.

[13:34] But I would love to have a hate a I can't even talk this morning. I would love to get a Houdini

[13:42] owner on the show who gets a machine to talk about the experience with the game. I've always

[13:47] sort of wondered like, is that will I even get like objective feedback from someone who just bought

[13:54] a game on a game? Maybe, maybe not. But it would be great to have someone come on and talk to me

[13:59] about it. All right. So I want to read something that someone said to me. This is from David. I got

[14:07] an email because this is talking about getting owners on the show. He says Chris, I enjoy your

[14:11] podcasts and opinionated stances, whether I agree with them or not. You're maturing as a broadcaster

[14:18] and I enjoy the interviews and guests quite a bit. You are typically respectful of your guests

[14:23] and demonstrate real curiosity, which are hallmarks of good interviews. That said, I found an interest,

[14:32] I found it interesting that you touted your fairness and respective interviews on the 124 podcasts,

[14:39] just two days after airing the P3 owner interview. Uncharacteristically, your tone was painful,

[14:47] painfully condescending during the P3 owner interview. It was clear from your line of questioning

[14:52] that you're not a fan of the P3 platform. You were dismissive of the Aussies passion for the

[14:57] platform and followed up many of his statements with more questions, masquerading as commentary

[15:04] about the platform's limitations. I've played P3 enough to know that it sucks. It's clearly created

[15:11] by an engineer and not a designer. The machine's industrial design and games feel sterile and

[15:17] uninspired to me. So my comments are not in defense of P3, but rather a commentary on the show.

[15:25] Thanks for reading and much appreciation for your passion and investment in the podcast.

[15:31] All right, wow, David, thank you for writing in and sort of saying such candid words to me.

[15:38] And look, I had a hard time. And look, I don't think I was like combative, but I talk to this gentleman

[15:48] about his P3. And yes, do I think the P3 platform is going to struggle to take off in this new

[15:56] climate where there's so much out there? I mean, my opinions have been shared many, many times

[16:01] before. But this individual wanted to come on and share his experience about the machines with me.

[16:07] Now, I'm going to say this. I'm going to say this. The part to me that again, I think just says

[16:14] all you need to know is I think I think this individual who bought the P3. He did something that a

[16:20] lot of people did years ago and I bet he would never do it again. If the only part that I really

[16:26] actually I would have just like stopped the interview because it's like, wait, what? Like, why would

[16:30] you do that? He paid in full $10,000 for a P3 machine without ever having played it or really

[16:40] seen it. And then his money was tied up in P3, multi-morphic for five years before he got his

[16:48] machine. Five years. You $10,000 refundable locked in to get a machine. And that's just the part

[16:57] of this hobby. But I'm sorry, but it's hard for me to, yeah, I don't know, sort of empathize or

[17:05] understand why anyone would ever do something like that. You've never played the game and you're

[17:11] going to lock your money up for five freaking years. Look, and I've been an idiot. I've bought games

[17:18] without playing them before. Many of my listeners have done the same exact thing. And I think

[17:23] everyone's learned a lesson that when you do that, there's a good chance you're going to get burned.

[17:29] But I did find it hard to have that interview because I feel like, I don't know if it's Jerry

[17:34] asked him to come on the show and talk to me about owning it. But I just, you know, I don't know.

[17:40] I don't know what to say anymore about P3, multi-morphic. Well, you tell me like what's left to cover

[17:46] about the platform? Do you really think people are going to go in on this platform until a licensed

[17:53] theme comes out for the platform? Unless there is a game that makes people really want this thing.

[17:59] It's been out now. We've seen it for five years. And it's not going to be able to build enough of

[18:06] a user base for it to accomplish the main goal of P3. Because remember, the main goal of it is

[18:14] that other people in the community will make games for it and design that upper playfield portion

[18:20] to be swapped in. But that will happen by the community. It's like this open source thing.

[18:26] But nobody in the community will do that if only 40 people like own a P3 because there's no money

[18:32] to be made. Who's going to buy it? 40 people? Sturring can make it a basic EM and sell like 500 of them.

[18:41] So it's just that's the problem. And something that I just, you know, I struggle with because I do

[18:47] want to be positive. But is there a market for all these companies? All these companies that have

[18:53] tried to reinvent Pimbal to do Pimbal differently? I think they all solved a problem that did not

[19:01] exist. They manufactured the problem that they then went and solved. And in doing so,

[19:09] every company that has tried that has simply spent years not making any money while Stern Pimbal

[19:18] has spent the last five years growing, making millions of dollars, increasing their fanbase,

[19:24] and doing the one thing, the most important thing over the last five years. Stern Pimbal has

[19:31] brought way more people into the hobby and the resurgence of Pimbal that's happening in the world

[19:38] is because of them. And all these other people trying to save Pimbal and reinvent Pimbal, all they've

[19:45] done is hurt the hobby because they've removed money from the hobby. They've made people wait for

[19:52] years. They failed to deliver when they said they would. So again, I just think it's ridiculous

[19:59] that all these people use no market research to launch their companies. They literally just had a

[20:07] gut feeling that this is what the hobby needed and it rarely led to anything positive in the hobby.

[20:15] And I happily welcome anyone out there who feels I got this wrong that I don't get it, that if people

[20:22] just saw my dream, this would take off. I just don't get it. I think market research is so

[20:28] damn important and it is easily ignored. All right. All right. Speaking of market research, I got an

[20:35] email from the listener of this show. George went. George, thank you for listening to Canadian

[20:41] Pimbal podcast. He says, Hi, Chris. I hope this email finds you well. One of the reasons you are

[20:48] my favorite podcasters because we view the world through a similar lens even though we tend to come

[20:54] up with different conclusions on occasion. I teach a course in politics and we thoroughly discuss

[21:01] marketing as part of that class. I always assign the article Marketing Myopia by Ted Levitt.

[21:09] In the article, the author argues that the difference between marketing and selling is that marketing

[21:15] listens to the demand of customers and rises to meet them whereas selling is just forcing whatever

[21:22] product you have on hand onto the customer. One of the more famous examples is corning.

[21:31] When I was a kid, corning made discount plates that you bought at the outlet. Now they make a huge

[21:37] percentage of the glass found on cell phones. They define their business brought enough to meet a

[21:43] shifting demand but still narrow enough to use their comparative advantage. I think all Pimbal

[21:50] companies need to read this article because they are failing at this. I come from the arcade industry.

[21:57] A majority of us, myself included, prefer video games and Pimbals but we all have cranes,

[22:03] redemption games and other means to give prizes. We listen to the customer and meet them on their

[22:10] level. Conversely, Pimbal companies are just putting out whatever licenses they scrounge together

[22:17] and slapping a price tag on it. This won't work in the long haul. They need to better integrate

[22:23] themes, attack the market that actually exists today as compared to the one that existed 10 years

[22:30] ago and start to make machines that have far broader appeal. It is also my hope that they start to

[22:37] unveil Pimbals that will do better at FECs. Compared to many of our games, Pimbals are a steel

[22:44] and we don't bat an eye at those price tags. There should be a way to incorporate at least a few

[22:50] Pimbals into most our Cades but the Pimbal companies seem to be ignoring this market and instead

[22:56] solely going after the home user with SternPros reserve for bars. Do you have any thoughts on this?

[23:03] Again, I love your podcast and want to congratulate you on the Twippy Awards sincerely. George,

[23:08] George, thank you. I was reading the P3 email before this. This is the first time I read George's

[23:15] email in full. I've said it before and I'll say it again. I 100% agree. I think that when Pimbal

[23:26] listens to what people want and they make the game that people want, that there is a demand for,

[23:32] the sales skyrocket. There was no market research whatsoever. None. If you were to go out and ask

[23:40] people what themes you really want to see a Pimbal machine come out in 2018, nobody would say

[23:45] pirates of the Caribbean. Nobody. This is the argument I've been making is that Jack is an amazing

[23:53] salesperson. He will try to sell you on that but there is not market research that says that people

[23:59] really had a demand for it. That is why I think pirates of the Caribbean is not going to be this

[24:06] tremendous hit that everybody thinks. There is no market that said we know what we really want from

[24:10] Pat Lawler dialed in. It's the assumption that just anything new Pat Lawler makes is going to

[24:19] sell. Why do we have to keep hearing people over and over and over again say if you just remake back

[24:27] to the future, if you remake or make big trouble in little China, if you make he man, if you make

[24:33] GI Joe, the nostalgic themes that we keep seeing time and time again are what everyone is beating

[24:40] the drum to get made. Why then are we getting WWE? Why are we getting Guardians of the Galaxy? Why

[24:49] are we getting these themes that don't have a broad appeal? You know it's got a broad appeal?

[24:53] Freaking King Kong, Godzilla. Things that like everyone is familiar with that you can easily make a

[25:03] pinball world under glass happen based on that theme. And look, Star Wars, yes of course Star Wars

[25:09] is going to sell like Hawkeaks. I'm sure Star Wars has sold like Hawkeaks but I think there's very

[25:14] little market research that goes on in general. Look but I also don't think pinball will ever on any

[25:20] level be able to compete with redemption games. I hear from operators all the time, why would they

[25:27] want to have a pinball machine that is prone to having issues and can break down and when they

[25:33] can have a damn redemption game that is going to be flawless and take a dollar in just a few seconds

[25:39] and everyone who walks up to it knows exactly what they're doing. I think pinball has a really

[25:45] high learning curve. I don't think it will ever be as popular again as it was back in the day

[25:50] in the arcades and I think next to the newer like coin operated devices, I think you'd be really

[25:57] hard pressed to want to make money using pinball. I think it is a better thing to put into barcades

[26:05] because I think then you get like the league night you get the you know the people who love pinball

[26:09] frequently in your establishment. No one freqwins redemption games at movie theaters because they

[26:16] want to win that iPhone really bad but I think pinball is a more social thing but when it comes to

[26:22] making money if I'm an operator I don't care about like the social nature I just want to make as

[26:26] much money as possible on location. I do think everyone should go read marketing my opa.

[26:33] My opa. Sorry guys it's money morning. I'm trying to get this up before going to work by Ted Levit.

[26:39] But I've said it before and I constantly get ignored. No one has ever asked me for any marketing

[26:44] advice in this pinball hobby. I work for some of the biggest brands in the world. I know how to

[26:49] launch a product. I know how to market something and again you're right. The marketing starts

[26:55] by listening. I've built my entire career. My entire career just so you know I don't talk about

[27:01] my personal life very often. My entire career I've built on my own sort of approach which

[27:09] I've built a team and it's called culture tapping and what we do is we listen to what's going on

[27:14] in culture and what people want to talk about and we connect large brands to those cultural

[27:20] conversations. It all starts with listening. If I you know you know many times I get asked by

[27:25] companies here's what we're doing. Sell it for me. Get people to talk about it. Push it out into

[27:31] the world. That's not what you do. You want to create a moment where you're pulling people in.

[27:36] They want to engage with you. If Stern made big trouble in little China do you think they'd have to

[27:41] sell it or would people be pulled into that? If they made you know goonies or gremlins. Do you think

[27:49] they'd have to pull people you know push it out or would people just naturally gravitate towards it?

[27:53] So look it's it's never going to happen though because you know I'm tying there's not enough money

[27:58] probably in pinball to pay really good marketing people. Let's see what else I got from people. So

[28:05] John Morgan said hey Chris just want to say that I'm looking forward to your next podcast about

[28:11] Deeproot Pimball. Well John thank you for listening to the show. Hopefully you heard my podcast where I

[28:16] went all over Deeproot Pimball. I got an email from Rakim Sanders. Rakim thank you for writing and

[28:22] he said can you had a long time listener first time emailer. I've been hounding my wife like a

[28:28] propeller of a motorboat trying to get her to allow me a pin in my house after much back and forth.

[28:34] I've narrowed down to two pins. Exmenally and daddy East Jurassic Park. No here is the

[28:41] Canadian now here's the Canadian challenge which would you choose also do you have any plans to

[28:45] attend the Golden State Pimball Festival this May in Lodai California James Brown. I can't tell if

[28:52] it's James Brown or Rakim Sanders because I love what people sign off their email with a different

[28:57] name from where it came from. Look which would I choose I would choose Jurassic Park. I love the theme.

[29:04] I just think it's a better game. I don't plan on going to Lodai California for shows I'll tell you

[29:09] why because I'm saving up for a wedding and I've got demon payments to make. That's right my demon

[29:14] came in on on this Friday. I haven't even talked about it but if you follow me on Facebook you'll see

[29:20] pictures of it. So yeah I would go with Jurassic Park. What else is going on in the Pimball world? So

[29:27] I saw someone put up an email or thread on Pinside that says is Batman 66 a keeper?

[29:34] And I think we all sort of struggle with that is when does a pinball machine become something that

[29:40] will never let go of we hear the term it's bolted to the floor. I heard I heard people a lot will say

[29:46] that with Tron Ali that it's bolted to the floor and I think if we're honest with ourselves every

[29:53] pinball machine is a keeper until it's not and we love to feel like this is the one that's going

[29:59] to give me years of enjoyment but every game ultimately will get old you will get tired of playing

[30:05] it you will want the new stuff and that's just natural I've never it's like still playing a video

[30:11] game from 20 years ago ultimately you'll want to move on to the newer versions of those titles

[30:17] and because pinball has all these new games coming out how could you not want to experience something

[30:22] for the first time. So that's the reality but for some people look some themes will never leave

[30:28] like Batman 66 I know people who own this machine that are like I will never let this game go now

[30:34] a different question is how hard do you think it is going to be to get a Batman Ellie or

[30:40] Super Ali from people and I think people are realizing this Batman's are not coming up for sale

[30:47] at all if you have an Ellie or an SLE I think you probably have one of the most

[30:53] in demand sought after pins by collectors right now there are more magic girls for sale on eBay

[31:02] than there are of Batman Ellie's or SLE's so think about that for a minute I think people are

[31:08] going to be very hesitant to let this go and I'm going to say this and I think people who are

[31:13] playing Batman now realize this because the new code is amazing Batman will go down and George

[31:19] Gomez was right it will go down as one of the greatest Stern pinball machines if not one of the

[31:25] greatest pinball machines ever and I say this because it's going to go down as probably one of the

[31:31] greatest theme integrations or licensed integrations ever the amount of assets they have for this machine

[31:36] is incredible there are 5,000 video clips from 120 episodes there are personal callouts from the

[31:44] actors of Batman and Robin in the game and I think it makes other pinball machines integrations

[31:50] seem very lackluster you know I saw the videos of Pirates of the Caribbean and it's it's just one

[31:56] actor doing all the voiceovers and what is the point in having select you select from like 30

[32:03] characters from the movies and then you never hear from them ever you're never going to hear from

[32:08] them ever me think about that ever I'm oh my god again market market market research would have

[32:18] never said like let's land the plane on this theme because we have no access to any of the assets

[32:23] I it's it is so mind-boggling to me so mind-boggling what else is going on I saw a little teaser video

[32:30] of spooky pinballs Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle I don't know about you guys I'm excited I am

[32:37] I mean look I I've been the first to say I think spooky is like hasn't hit it out of the park yet

[32:43] I think they know that I like that they have these teaser videos getting people excited for TPS

[32:51] and it's been what's been a year right because I think at last TPS is where they announced the theme

[32:57] remember I broke the exclusive and they got mad at me for saying that but that's what that's

[33:01] where it was at last TPS is when Charlie announced the game and the translate and look it's I think

[33:07] it's great in one year in one year's time he came back and now he's pulling he's pulling the

[33:13] curtain back and showing us the pin great I love that I love that this this company's always been known

[33:19] they at least get us games at least get us games expectations will be high some of the artwork like

[33:26] it's starting to look cool like I wasn't a biggest fan of the translate but I'm starting to get

[33:29] you know warm up to what I'm seeing in those little snippets of footage so really look forward to

[33:34] that game let's see I don't know if I'm going to TPS yet I don't know so that is going to be a game

[33:44] time decision by me again I'm I'm just trying to allocate my resources this year but I would love

[33:50] to go I would love to go so I'm going to do my best to get out there all right so that's going to be

[33:54] it for this little Monday edition snackable version of Canadian pinball podcast I think the key

[34:00] takeaway from this episode everyone should do their market research and all of pinball would be

[34:06] better because we wouldn't get dud themes we would get stuff that they knew we wanted not them guessing

[34:14] what we wanted I think that all podcasts all podcasters are great who do pinball podcasts I would

[34:22] snub anyone or ignore anyone's accolades if people won awards I would happily congratulate them and

[34:29] name them if they won an award so I just a little bit disappointed to see that people were ignoring

[34:35] this podcast you know ever since I was banned by pinside the inability to recognize this podcast

[34:43] and to recognize me as a personality in the pinball community all that ever does is make more people

[34:50] listen to this podcast and it drives more people to hear what I have to say because who do you

[34:56] want to listen to the the the people who just say what you expect them to say or the or the person

[35:01] you shouldn't listen to him don't don't listen to that podcast he's going to say things that are

[35:06] controversial and offensive and no no duh duh duh duh have do we really I think we just we try to

[35:12] get to the truth of this whole hobby and we try to get to it quickly we don't ramble on for 10 20

[35:18] minutes we get right into it and I every episode look we're 35 minutes in and we're done we're

[35:23] done you know other places they're just getting started um already everyone have a great Monday

[35:28] and look for that Dave Senner's interview to go up sometime this week we're out
