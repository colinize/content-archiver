[00:00] I'll be coming for you anyway.

[00:02] Take on me.

[00:07] Take on me.

[00:08] Take me on.

[00:12] TREATED

[00:14] TREATED

[00:15] TREATED

[00:17] TREATED

[00:18] Aw, welcome everybody.

[00:19] Happy Friday.

[00:20] Welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:21] I got a really great show for you today.

[00:23] First and foremost, thank you so much everybody.

[00:25] We are well over 600 club members.

[00:27] And if you join just to get over that 600 mark and win that $100, I really hope you stick

[00:33] around next month when you get hit with that huge $5 bill on Monday.

[00:38] But everybody, thank you for being here.

[00:39] Here's what we're going to do on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:42] I'm going to talk about, will pinball machines go the way of the automobile?

[00:47] We love a good argument.

[00:49] But I want to talk about how long can a pinball machine stay at the same price when it becomes

[00:54] a year old, two years old?

[00:57] And how can these distributors move games that are selling for thousands less on the

[01:02] second hand market?

[01:04] Like imagine if you're sitting on a Guns N' Roses LE and you're trying to sell it for

[01:08] $11,000 firm.

[01:11] And meanwhile, the second hand market is selling it for $8,000.

[01:15] We're going to talk about that.

[01:16] But before we do that, I'm going to end the show with that kind of discussion.

[01:19] I'm going to go around the pinball horn.

[01:21] We're going to talk about all the news going on in the pinball world.

[01:23] You're not going to have to pay any extra for these.

[01:26] But I do want to say, I do applaud everybody getting into the Patreon ring.

[01:30] I think it's great.

[01:31] I think the one hard part is going to be when you ask people to pay money to hear just the

[01:36] scoops because the problem is after like three weeks, you run out of scoops.

[01:41] You got to just give them their own separate Patreon show like this.

[01:45] So let's start out with this.

[01:46] Let's start out with the fact that Jack Danger is going to be streaming tonight.

[01:50] Freakin' Pulp Fiction.

[01:52] The game with maybe the biggest hype other than Foo Fighters coming out of the March

[01:56] Madness, we're going to see Dead Flip.

[01:58] I think he's going over to Chicago Gaming Company or he's going to stream it in his

[02:02] studio.

[02:03] But he's going to stream for the world today at 6 o'clock Central Standard Time.

[02:08] Pulp Fiction Pinball with all of his great cameras and his audio.

[02:13] And here's why I'm really excited about this stream.

[02:16] I think everyone's forgotten.

[02:18] No one has seen this pinball machine streamed properly ever.

[02:22] We've got that great 20 minute sizzle reel video that Straight Down the Middle did which

[02:27] made everybody want to buy one.

[02:29] They brought this game to a few pinball shows in which nobody could hear a damn thing.

[02:34] And so this is going to be the first time where we are really going to hear in the best

[02:39] possible way and see the game in the best possible light.

[02:43] We're going to see if Pulp Fiction after an hour or two can keep everybody's interest

[02:49] because the part that I'm curious about is will the callouts get old?

[02:55] Do they have enough callouts?

[02:56] Because remember there's no real original callouts in this game.

[03:00] Rick and Morty was like all original pinball callouts combined with all of the different

[03:06] callouts from the show.

[03:07] We know they have five licensed songs in the game.

[03:11] I think people are forgetting.

[03:12] Guds and Roses has 22 licensed songs in the game itself.

[03:17] So will these five songs and will these callouts?

[03:20] And I hope they put this game in R rated mode and hopefully Twitch doesn't shut down the

[03:25] stream.

[03:26] But I'm really excited.

[03:27] It's also funny to me that Jack Danger once again is going over and helping a competitor

[03:35] sell its product.

[03:36] Now if you don't know the history, Stern and Churchill cabinets had a falling out.

[03:41] Churchill used to make all the cabinets and playfields for Stern Pinball and that changed

[03:46] during Ghostbusters and that's why the Ghostbusters playfields were horrible and the cabinet started

[03:52] splitting.

[03:53] It's such an indicator of how powerful Stern is.

[03:56] It's the ultimate flex in all of pinball.

[03:58] Think about it.

[03:59] You were going to let you take our designer to help you sell your game and we won't even

[04:04] care about it because he has sold us so many food fighter machines.

[04:09] It doesn't even matter.

[04:10] They will let Jack Danger sell everybody else's product.

[04:13] That's the ultimate flex happening in all of pinball and I know some of you are like,

[04:17] well, you know, he's going to stream it anyway.

[04:19] Yes, of course.

[04:20] Deadflip is a great stream and Jack has built a huge audience for pinball and I still think

[04:24] he is the greatest ambassador in all of pinball right now.

[04:28] I think he does great streams.

[04:30] I think he's very funny.

[04:31] He's very personable.

[04:33] And also he's the only man that's almost as handsome as Canada.

[04:36] All right.

[04:37] So that's tonight.

[04:38] So mark your calendars.

[04:39] I will be in that stream watching it with all of you.

[04:42] All right.

[04:43] So what's going on in pinball?

[04:44] Let's go around the horn.

[04:45] So Stern pinball.

[04:46] So food fighter LEs are arriving, but I've also noticed this.

[04:49] There are people that are upset who ordered a food fighter LE.

[04:53] Do you know why they're upset?

[04:55] Because some people are getting their premium machines before they got their LE.

[04:59] Now look, this is like, whoa, what's going on here?

[05:02] Right?

[05:03] So they make the pro, then they make all the LEs and then they make the premium.

[05:07] And I tend to look at this not like a bad thing.

[05:10] I think what's happening is simply this.

[05:13] Both LEs and premiums are arriving.

[05:16] Wait for it at the same time.

[05:18] And this is why Stern is the master of manufacturing.

[05:22] Because what's the commonality between food fighter LE and food fighter premium when the

[05:27] game is on the line?

[05:29] It's the exact same game.

[05:32] There is nothing they need to change.

[05:34] The play field is exactly the same on both all the toys, all the mechs, all the art,

[05:40] everything is the same.

[05:42] So Stern pinball can just have a country mile of food fighters being built.

[05:47] And all they have to do is change the apron and put them into a different cabinet.

[05:52] And that takes place at the end of the line.

[05:54] And then they're putting food fighters with all of its features in both LE and premium

[06:00] cabinets and they're getting them out the door.

[06:02] Super smart.

[06:03] You know, you got to think about Jersey Jack with Godfather because they change the artwork.

[06:08] They can't run them on the same line.

[06:10] They've got to like do an LE line and they've got to do a separate CE line.

[06:15] Stern pinball is so smart.

[06:17] They realize that the efficiencies in manufacturing is where all of the pinball battleground is

[06:24] taking place.

[06:25] I don't think it's a negative thing at all.

[06:27] And I think it's fun to see all of these food fighters get out to people.

[06:31] This game right now is going to be the game of the year.

[06:33] I mean, all of the feedback on it is tremendous.

[06:36] All of the good energy and vibes around this game are incredible.

[06:40] I'm really not hearing people say much negative stuff about the game.

[06:44] The upper play field does not slow down the game itself.

[06:48] This game is really a great game.

[06:50] And if it wasn't a great game, we know that we would hear from more people on pin side

[06:55] the issues with the game.

[06:57] So well done, Stern pinball.

[06:58] You are once again crushing it.

[07:01] Another thing I saw in the food fighters thread.

[07:02] This is going to be a weird thing.

[07:03] I'm going to talk about pinball and the bulge.

[07:06] So Stern pinball has two types of legs and they have legs where the bolts go into it

[07:11] are a little bit flatter and then legs where there's a bulge where the washer actually

[07:16] sits more flush with the main bolt.

[07:19] Now traditionally, Stern has given the nicer legs with the big bulge to the le machines

[07:26] and they've given the more subtle bulge to the premium machines.

[07:29] I can't even believe I'm using this terminology, but now we're seeing premiums with the le

[07:35] bulge.

[07:36] I have no idea why this even matters.

[07:39] I think I need to make a t-shirt.

[07:41] My premiums bulge is as big as your le bulge and I think I should sell that t-shirt.

[07:45] All right, the other thing happening with food fighters and if you have one coming,

[07:49] I think a lot of people are tinkering with the sound and the equalizer in the game itself.

[07:55] And so if you have one coming, I would check out the food fighter thread.

[07:59] There are people that are posting the best settings to get the best sound from the machine.

[08:05] It feels like when you buy a new TV and you're wondering like, what's the best picture?

[08:08] Like what do I do?

[08:10] And then you go on the internet and people tell you, here's what you need to have the

[08:12] brightness and the contrast and the sharpness.

[08:15] And I think that is happening with this game.

[08:17] All right, moving on from food fighters, let's talk a little bit about James Bond.

[08:22] Now James Bond is a game where every code update, James Bond fans are getting more excited.

[08:28] And I want to just say for the record, I hope every single one of you who has a James Bond,

[08:34] who is a James Bond fan, I hope each and every one of you are super happy in the end.

[08:41] I think there's this misconception that because I call out Stern Pimbal for selling you a game

[08:47] that is incomplete because I've jumped on a James Bond when it's incomplete and I don't

[08:53] have a lot of fun playing an incomplete game.

[08:57] And so I say that.

[08:58] And then you get this weird response from people who have bought the game.

[09:01] They're like, he's going to be wrong.

[09:03] And in the end, everyone's going to eat crow and this game is amazing.

[09:08] And my whole thing is this.

[09:09] I think a game should be amazing on the day they take your money.

[09:13] I think a game should be amazing on the day they sell it to you.

[09:17] And if more of these early adopters would stop buying everything before the game is complete,

[09:23] guess what Stern Pimbal would have to do?

[09:25] They would have to release the game when it is complete.

[09:28] If people just simply close their wallets on these incompleted games and they sat and

[09:34] nobody was buying them, it would make Stern learn a lesson.

[09:37] It's weird that we're always on the side of the manufacturer.

[09:41] Like we're helping them keep their line moving.

[09:44] We're helping them fulfill their contractual obligation to the license holder at the expense

[09:50] of our very own experience with the machine.

[09:54] And it's just a really weird thing.

[09:57] In no other hobby would this happen.

[09:59] All right, a couple more things about James Bond that are interesting.

[10:02] So on the playfield itself, it has the insert or it says attaché case, right?

[10:09] James Bond was a fancy spy.

[10:11] It says attaché case.

[10:14] That's when you know your baller, right?

[10:16] Ballers, they have attaché cases and they don't order filet mignon.

[10:21] A baller like James Bond orders chateau brion, right?

[10:25] It's just a more fancy way to say the same thing.

[10:28] But here's what's interesting.

[10:30] On the playfield, it says attaché case.

[10:33] Now when the call out in the game happens, it says briefcase.

[10:37] I'm just asking you, wouldn't that annoy you?

[10:40] Do you think Stern's going to fix this?

[10:42] You think the call out should actually reflect what's written on the playfield?

[10:46] I think so.

[10:48] And I think they might address it after hearing Canada's pinball podcast.

[10:51] I want this to be one of the things I correct.

[10:53] He got them to say attaché case.

[10:55] All right, another thing I've been reading in the James Bond thread and I hope you find

[10:59] a lot more interesting tidbits in this podcast because I did spend a lot of time

[11:03] going through Pinsight as painful as it is.

[11:05] Canada has extracted things you are just not going to see anywhere else.

[11:09] All right, so here's the thing.

[11:10] If you bought the Mezzel Mod rocket upgrade for James Bond, be careful because an owner

[11:17] who put it into their machine was realizing the rocket wasn't registering as well as

[11:22] the stock Stern rocket.

[11:25] And here's why the Mezzel Mod rocket is a little bit smaller than the Stern stock rocket.

[11:33] And because it's smaller, the diameter of the rocket is smaller.

[11:37] It's not hitting those switches as well as the stock Stern rocket.

[11:42] So just be careful.

[11:43] If you're going to put that mod into your machine, read the thread.

[11:47] I think you're going to have to increase the diameter of that mod so it works as well

[11:51] as the Stern one does.

[11:53] All right, that's what's going on over there.

[11:55] All right, let's talk quickly about Dutch pinball.

[11:57] So we're all really waiting for the game after the Big Lebowski.

[12:01] Like that's true.

[12:01] Everyone wants to see what Barry's got next.

[12:03] It's a sci-fi movie game.

[12:05] But here's what I've been reading about.

[12:07] People are wondering when I order a Big Lebowski today, how long is it going to take for me

[12:12] to get my machine?

[12:14] Now, the answer from CoinTaker, who is the exclusive distributor of this game, is that

[12:19] it will take 12 months for you to get your the Big Lebowski.

[12:23] Now, from owners, if you hear their stories, actual buyers are saying it's more like 15

[12:29] months from the date they ordered their machine to the date they get their machine.

[12:34] It's a long wait.

[12:35] It's a really long wait.

[12:37] It's also crazy that this game has been part of the pinball community now for the last

[12:42] 10 years, 10 years into this game's production cycle.

[12:47] And if you order one today, it's almost a year and a half wait to get it.

[12:51] Can you imagine if 10 years from now, you wanted a Foo Fighters pinball machine, it

[12:57] would take you over a year to get it.

[13:00] And if it was the only game Stern had been making for 10 years.

[13:03] Now, we know Dutch has had issues with manufacturing, but here's what makes me nervous about getting

[13:08] to their next game.

[13:09] If a Big Lebowski is over a year and a half away from getting it or over a year from getting

[13:15] your game, how are they ever going to just be done with Lebowski purchases?

[13:20] How are they ever going to just finish Lebowski manufacturing?

[13:24] One of the things everyone needs to be reminded of, they've never set what the limit of games

[13:29] they will make.

[13:30] Here's what I think Barry needs to do.

[13:32] He needs to just cap this thing.

[13:34] We have to make this many new games to then make all of the EA guys who bought their games

[13:39] whole and then he needs to cap it like whether it's 2000 units or 1500 or 1000.

[13:45] I don't know what it is, but I just think it's like this weird thing now where I wouldn't

[13:50] even order a new one and I'll tell you why I wouldn't get a new one.

[13:54] Here's why I would just get a used one.

[13:55] The new ones are going to have the new Mirko playfields that have the art removed around

[14:01] the pose.

[14:02] So that's not going to look as good.

[14:03] It might hold up better, but the original Big Lebowski's like those playfields were

[14:07] great.

[14:08] It had artwork under the pose and that's because Europe changed its laws on the formula for

[14:14] like clear codes and now Mirko games have been falling apart ever since and sure you

[14:20] could remove the art from around the pose, but come on, what's up with that?

[14:23] How is that the only solution?

[14:25] And also you could go get a Big Lebowski now and maybe pay 500 or 1000 over sticker for

[14:31] one and then have the game.

[14:34] We all think we're going to live forever.

[14:35] We all think we're going to have the next 12 to 15 months.

[14:38] You might not.

[14:39] You might not make it there.

[14:40] And I don't know about you, but waiting 15 months for a game that's been out 10 years,

[14:46] I would just go grab a used one because I want to see Dutch get to their next game.

[14:51] And that's that.

[14:52] All right, speaking of next game, so Haggis Pimbal.

[14:55] So I am hearing and I'm telling you right now their next game is Centaur.

[14:59] Marty Robbins' game is War of the World.

[15:02] I think everyone has forgotten that I told you that he is working on the War of the World.

[15:06] Only the Orson Welles Radio Address War of the World.

[15:10] It is open IP.

[15:12] I don't think they're really ever going to get to Marty Robbins' game.

[15:15] I don't.

[15:16] I think for this company to stay around, they're going to have to sell stuff where they know

[15:20] people want to buy it.

[15:22] And I don't know what Marty's design skills are like.

[15:25] Do you think he's on par with a guy like Jack Danger?

[15:28] I doubt it.

[15:29] And also this, think about it, if you're Marty Robbins and you're designing a game at Haggis

[15:33] Pimbal, who's walking into the room?

[15:37] To help you make that game better.

[15:39] Think about it.

[15:40] Who's going to help you from a design standpoint make that game better?

[15:45] He's got his design.

[15:46] He's got his white wood right there.

[15:47] He looks over and he sees the design geniuses that made the game Celts.

[15:52] You're like, what?

[15:53] Celts!

[15:54] Meanwhile, Jack Danger walks into Stern Pimbal with some design ideas.

[15:58] He walks over and there's Keith Elwin.

[16:01] There's George Gomez.

[16:03] There's Brian Eddy.

[16:04] Hey guys, what do you think of this?

[16:06] He's got the most talented people in the history of Pimbal by his side to make sure the game's

[16:12] amazing.

[16:13] And that's why Foo Fighters is amazing.

[16:15] It's not just all Jack.

[16:16] Stern Pimbal has the most talented people helping make these games amazing.

[16:21] And so look, I don't think we're going to get Marty's War of the Worlds.

[16:24] And the next game is Centaur.

[16:25] Now here's the big question.

[16:27] Do you think they're going to try to take early deposits on Centaur?

[16:31] Centaur or Centaur before they make all of the fathoms?

[16:36] Because we both know that they've still got a lot of fathoms to make.

[16:42] They probably have a few more hundred fathoms.

[16:45] So I think if they announce game two and ask for a deposit, I wouldn't do it.

[16:51] And I'll tell you why I wouldn't do it.

[16:53] We've seen this before.

[16:54] I feel like all these boutiques that are struggling with manufacturing, they're going to take that

[16:59] new deposit money and they're going to use it to build the fathoms.

[17:05] I want to see Hagus Pimbal show us.

[17:08] They don't need the next game's deposit to finish this game's run.

[17:12] So we will see what happens.

[17:14] But I would just be cautious if I were you.

[17:16] And I feel bad for those guys that bought that series ticket deposit where they already

[17:20] gave a deposit that's non-refundable for the next four to five games from Hagus.

[17:26] Wow.

[17:27] That's the biggest leap of faith in the history of Pimbal deposits.

[17:31] All right.

[17:32] Let's go on to American Pimbal next.

[17:33] American Pimbal.

[17:34] So David Fix is emailing people.

[17:36] He's emailing distributors and saying, we are working on a wait for it, a fix of Galactic

[17:42] Tank Force.

[17:43] He is telling people that they are going to fix those targets.

[17:46] They are going to create a bracket to fix those targets.

[17:49] I don't think there's anything they can do, people.

[17:51] When you think about how a target works, how a leap switch works, how are you going to

[17:57] make a bracket that stops that leap switch and that target from bending?

[18:02] In every single Pimbal game, a target will move, a target will bend.

[18:07] That is why nobody puts targets that close to the flippers.

[18:14] Nobody puts five targets in a row straight up the middle of the game where it's going

[18:19] to get pummeled.

[18:20] They've been working on this game for two to three years.

[18:23] Two to three years.

[18:24] And they never figured this out in any of the testing.

[18:28] None of the whitewood stage of this game.

[18:30] And so he's saying, we're going to fix it.

[18:32] All right, well, we'll see what they do.

[18:34] Here's the other part.

[18:35] Nobody knows when this game is going on the line.

[18:36] I saw Mr. Pimbal Australia is taking orders on this game and telling everybody production

[18:42] begins in June.

[18:44] Okay.

[18:45] I thought it was May.

[18:46] Now it's June.

[18:47] And I have a real problem with this whole thing about like, why are these distributors

[18:50] bombarding people, spamming everybody with four sale ads?

[18:54] And none of them know when the game is actually going to be on the line.

[18:58] None of them.

[18:59] It just annoys me.

[19:00] I will never celebrate a company like American Pimbal who doesn't need to do it this way.

[19:05] They don't.

[19:06] They're being bankrolled by AIM Trom and Mukesh.

[19:09] They know the way the industry works.

[19:11] If you want to get excitement for your game, you're going to have to get the game on the

[19:15] line within the first couple months of the game being revealed and they're not doing

[19:20] it.

[19:21] I don't like the way CGC is handling Pulp Fiction.

[19:23] I don't like the way American Pimbal is handling Galactic Tank Force.

[19:27] All right.

[19:28] Let's go to Spooky Pimbal now real quick.

[19:29] So Spooky Pimbal.

[19:30] So what's it like in the Spooky thread these days?

[19:32] So I've been reading it and it's a combination of two things.

[19:36] The Scooby-Doo thread can be summarized like this.

[19:39] Some people are loving the game.

[19:41] They love Scooby-Doo.

[19:43] And some people are having some quality issues with the game.

[19:46] Now we know that quality issues have followed Spooky Pimbal for a very long time.

[19:52] The good news is this.

[19:54] They are in the thread.

[19:55] They are responding to people.

[19:57] I saw that Spooky Luke himself said he listens to Canada.

[20:01] Luke, thank you for being here, brother.

[20:04] I want to say this.

[20:06] Does this game have some quality issues?

[20:08] Yes.

[20:09] Is this Spooky Pimbal's best shooting game to date?

[20:12] Yes.

[20:13] Is this their best theme-integrated pin to date?

[20:15] I would say after Rick and Morty.

[20:17] But here's the thing about quality.

[20:20] They've made a few hundred games.

[20:22] If five people's games are having quality issues, you are going to hear from those five people

[20:28] on pin side over and over and over again.

[20:32] I will say it never ceases to amaze me that when someone has an issue with the game, it

[20:37] seems like they go to pin side first and complain there and share their problem as if pin side

[20:44] will be able to fix their problem better than the company itself.

[20:49] I think the fair thing to do is if you have a pinball problem, at least give the pinball

[20:54] company 48 hours to get back to you and help you before you run to pin side with your pitch

[21:00] fork.

[21:01] Now the reason why people like to go to pin side, it's therapeutic.

[21:05] When something happens to you that you feel you've been wronged, it's nice to go to a place

[21:10] where people are going to rally around your complaints.

[21:14] That is what pin side is great for.

[21:16] My favorite is when someone gets a new stern and it's like a Sunday at noon and it's like

[21:20] I've got an issue and man, I'm going to go here right now and just scream at the clouds

[21:25] and it's like bro, it's Sunday.

[21:28] Wait to Monday.

[21:29] Reach out to stern during normal business hours.

[21:33] Turn off your machine that's having an issue and just be patient.

[21:37] But none of us in pinball can be patient.

[21:40] I've been there when something breaks in your game.

[21:43] You want it fixed in like 30 seconds or you want to raise cane.

[21:47] The other thing I'm seeing in the spooky thread is this and people are starting to realize

[21:50] this and they should have taken my advice.

[21:52] A lot of people are saying look, I'm seeing there are some quality issues.

[21:56] My game is like 1200.

[21:59] I've got a year to wait to get it.

[22:01] I want to let go of my spot.

[22:03] I should have waited and saw what the game was like and now that I'm seeing these quality

[22:09] issues, I want to back out.

[22:11] Now look, all those deposits non-refundable.

[22:14] I'm starting to see more and more people realize and say this, that this is the last time I

[22:19] will ever give a non-refundable deposit on a game.

[22:24] Especially a game that's never going to be hard to get.

[22:26] They're making 1969 of these machines.

[22:30] There will be so many Scooby-Doo's available.

[22:32] It won't even be funny.

[22:34] Then when you go to the marketplace, now it's a race to losing at least $1,000 on your deposit

[22:40] because there are so many Scooby-Doo's available to buy for like 1400 bucks, 1500 bucks and

[22:47] none of them are selling.

[22:48] Remember that none of these are selling, which means that's not even close to the price someone's

[22:53] willing to give you.

[22:54] None of them are moving.

[22:55] If you want to get out of your Scooby-Doo right now, I think you take $1,000 loss and

[23:00] you get out of it and you learn a lesson and think about how crazy it is, how these guys

[23:05] will lose $1,000 and get nothing for it.

[23:09] Yet, Canada's Pinball Podcast is $60 a year for most people and I've been telling everybody

[23:16] not to rush in.

[23:17] If they had just given Canada 60 bucks, they would have saved themselves $940 if they just

[23:26] took my advice.

[23:27] What's going on at Multimorphic?

[23:29] Nothing much over than the fact that Jerry shared a picture of people making his product,

[23:34] which is great.

[23:35] We saw the assembly line.

[23:36] We saw the people inside Multimorphic.

[23:39] He highlighted three women who were like critical to the manufacturing of the platform and I

[23:44] just want to say this.

[23:45] I just want to see more of this.

[23:47] I love seeing the men and women who make these games.

[23:51] I love seeing Stern's Factory Tour.

[23:54] If you're a pinball company, it will only benefit you to open up your factory and show

[24:02] your customers who these people are, how they are working hard, what it looks like behind

[24:08] the scenes.

[24:10] Going radio silent, not sharing any information, that's a sign that things are not well in

[24:17] your institution.

[24:19] What else is happening in pinball?

[24:21] Who have I left out?

[24:22] Godfather.

[24:23] I talked about Godfather today.

[24:24] All I'm going to say about Godfather before I talk about pinball prices being on sale

[24:28] is this.

[24:29] I don't know who to believe about how well Godfather machines are doing.

[24:34] I'm not going to name names, but I reached out to one distributor and he said it's not

[24:38] selling.

[24:39] I reached out to a distributor in Europe and he said all Godfather sales have stopped.

[24:43] Then I reached out to a distributor in the US and they said sales are great.

[24:47] I don't know who to believe.

[24:49] We will see.

[24:50] I don't see a ton of unboxings.

[24:53] I think everyone's waiting to see these collector's editions get out the door and I'm excited

[24:58] to just play the freaking game.

[25:00] There is still not a single Godfather in New York City.

[25:04] Until this game gets to where the actual movie takes place, I don't know what to do.

[25:10] I don't even know how to feel about this game.

[25:12] I can't review it for you.

[25:14] I can't do anything.

[25:15] I'm not traveling hours to play the game.

[25:19] Jersey Jack set up a freaking Godfather in New York City.

[25:24] Thank you.

[25:25] Let's end this show talking about how long can this relationship between distributors

[25:30] and manufacturers last where manufacturers require a distributor not to sell the product

[25:38] below a certain price.

[25:40] I think it's called like map pricing.

[25:43] Now that there's nine pinball companies selling games to everybody, now that these companies

[25:48] are making thousands of each game and now that there are so many marketplaces to go buy

[25:54] used pinball machines, right?

[25:56] Nobody buys a game on eBay, but Facebook Marketplace is great and with almost every game out there,

[26:03] if you want to get one, you've got two options, right?

[26:07] They might still be making this game new and box.

[26:09] You could either buy the game new and box or you could buy it used.

[26:13] Those are your two options, really.

[26:15] I think this industry is long overdue for something called a sale and we saw it with

[26:22] the pinball brothers and alien.

[26:24] I don't think I've ever seen another pinball company announce a reduction in the price

[26:29] of the game and they gave what, $426 off.

[26:34] Not a lot off.

[26:35] That's not enough.

[26:36] I mean, no one's like, now I'm going to get one, right?

[26:38] Who says, hey honey, I can save $426.

[26:41] The only thing I got to do is now write a check for $11,000 because we're not seeing

[26:45] discounts of four or 500 bucks, people.

[26:48] We're seeing games go for $3,000 or $4,000 less sometimes.

[26:53] Let's take Guns N' Roses LE.

[26:55] There are distributors sitting on those games, new and box and they are being told by Jersey

[27:00] Jack Pinball, you have to sell this game for $11,000 firm.

[27:06] Now there are distributors that will do backdoor deals.

[27:09] They will take cash on the table and they will get the game out the door and they will

[27:13] sell below the map price.

[27:16] But who in their right mind would ever walk into a distributor and give them $11,000 for

[27:21] a GNR when they could easily find one in great condition for $8,000?

[27:28] Most of these games are really well maintained.

[27:31] It's actually, I always think better when someone has set the game up.

[27:34] They fixed all the issues and you can probably get a game where someone's maybe installed

[27:39] the Cliffys, they might have soldered some things that have broken and you get a game

[27:44] that's been played a little bit, right?

[27:46] Because it's like a new car.

[27:47] It's like that breaking period.

[27:48] When you open a new pinball machine and you play it 500 times, certain things that are

[27:52] going to get loose will get loose.

[27:55] Certain things that might break will break and it's great to have the original owner

[27:59] deal with all those headaches and then buy the game and have a game that's actually probably

[28:04] more bulletproof than a brand new game.

[28:06] The only thing you won't have is a perfect play field, but who cares, right?

[28:10] We got to get over that.

[28:11] You're going to have some dimples on your game.

[28:13] But I think we're going to get to a point now where if you want to buy a new and box

[28:16] GNR, they've got to sell that game for $1,000 off.

[28:20] It's last year's model.

[28:21] It's not even last year's model.

[28:23] It's like two years ago.

[28:25] If you want to buy a toy story L.E., no way you're going to sell them for sticker price.

[28:30] And the same is true with stern pinball machines as well.

[28:33] If you want to buy a premium of Rush, who's going to go in and buy a Rush premium for

[28:39] the new premium price of like $10,000 when I'm seeing Rush L.E.s now sell for $10,000?

[28:48] And then I'm seeing stern is going to continue to make more and more Godzilla premiums, Mandalorian

[28:55] premiums, and all of those premiums are $10,000 new in box.

[28:59] I don't know how they're going to do it.

[29:01] I really don't know how they're going to maintain this whole system.

[29:04] I think the real pressure is going to be on the distros.

[29:07] I think these guys are going to start having a ton of inventory.

[29:11] Some of the stuff is going to move like hotcakes, but the stuff that doesn't move like hotcakes

[29:16] that just sits there for a while, it's going to eat away at all of their profits.

[29:21] If you're a distro, you ideally want to have as little as you can, I would assume, in the

[29:27] factory.

[29:28] The next time a game comes from a manufacturer to you, it's immediately on a truck to its

[29:32] new owner.

[29:33] And I heard that a lot of distros just drop ship the games from the manufacturer.

[29:37] The game doesn't even go to the distro.

[29:39] It goes right from Stern or Jersey Jack to the customer.

[29:42] That would be the ideal situation.

[29:45] What you don't want to do if you're a distro is look down and see 10 Toy Story C.E.s or

[29:51] 20 Guns N' Roses L.E.s.

[29:53] So I don't know.

[29:54] I think we're going to see games go on sale.

[29:56] I would love it if these sale prices could be more transparent.

[29:59] I know that distros were selling people James Bond 60th for $16,500.

[30:06] Stern would not allow that distro to advertise that price.

[30:10] That's why you see all the call for price, call for price, call for price.

[30:13] I think the call for price stuff is bogus.

[30:16] So let's say I call for price and you tell me 16.5 and then I posted on your own page

[30:20] like people ask like how much, you know, they delete your comments.

[30:24] Like we got to live in this like pretend vacuum where we're not allowed to share the price.

[30:28] You know, then you look at the auto industry and all they do is run sale prices around

[30:34] holidays, memorial day sale, labor day sale, holiday sale.

[30:38] And I think Pimball is going to come to that.

[30:40] I think a distro that's sitting on like six, seven figures in inventory is going to have

[30:45] to have like the freaking coin taker holiday sale.

[30:49] Every game $500 off.

[30:50] Why can't they say that?

[30:51] Why can't they do that just to move inventory?

[30:55] There's too much power by the manufacturers.

[30:58] And like, look, let's put the pressure on the distros to go to the manufacturers and

[31:03] say, Hey, you can't do this anymore.

[31:06] You can't tell us I can sell your product below a certain price.

[31:09] I need to be able to, even if they have to lose money on some games, they have to get

[31:15] it out the door because ultimately it comes down to this.

[31:18] Even a distro rather just break even on a game he's been sitting on for a year and sell

[31:24] it at cost.

[31:26] Some distros want to sell James Bond's 60th at 15,000.

[31:30] You know why?

[31:31] Because they cut stern a check for $15,000 and they don't want it to sit there for another

[31:36] six months.

[31:38] Just let me get my money back.

[31:39] It's clear.

[31:40] I'm not going to make the kind of profit I thought I was on the game.

[31:43] It's not worth my energy.

[31:45] I could take that 15,000 that stuck in this James Bond 60th.

[31:50] I could go order with that money a stern le that I could sell much easier.
