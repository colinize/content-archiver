[00:00] All good ain't that America, you and me

[00:05] Ain't that America, something to see

[00:09] Baby, ain't that America, hold on to free

[00:14] Little per-counts, something to me

[00:22] All ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 619 of

[00:27] Canadian Pimball Podcast, it has only taken me 619 shows

[00:33] And I've been waiting for this show because on this episode I get to wish

[00:38] Zack Sharp, the marketing director at Stern Pimball, a very, very happy 40th birthday on Wednesday, October 6th

[00:47] And Zack, I know you listen, I know you steal my incredible ideas

[00:52] And I know you implement them and I'm here to tell you 10,499 dollars

[00:58] That's not the ceiling for a Stern LE, we can easily get this to $15,000 by the time you're 41

[01:06] But happy 40th brother, we really are very happy that you're over at Stern

[01:10] And you've made incredible moves that are silent, right? You don't really hear from him that much

[01:15] But like I always say, Stern Pimball and the people over there

[01:19] And I make the really difficult seem very easy

[01:23] So happy birthday, Zack, we wish you many, many happy and healthy more

[01:27] Now speaking of happy, I was very happy that Mr. David Fix, the director of operations

[01:33] Over at American Pimball joined Canadian Pimball Podcast and I had a really great talk with Mr. Fix

[01:39] And I think a lot of people out there or some people out there were expecting this to be

[01:43] somewhat of a contentious interview

[01:45] Since David did come out and say some stuff about Canada but it wasn't

[01:49] And the reason why it wasn't is this

[01:52] American Pimball is a company in transition

[01:55] They're a company in which we have not seen the new team and what they're working on yet

[02:00] David is very honest about his feelings on the other titles but he didn't make those titles

[02:05] And also American Pimball makes a quality game

[02:08] And also this, the most important part is this

[02:11] American Pimball has never ripped anyone off

[02:14] They've never left anybody hanging

[02:17] And in a world in which most new Pimball companies end up losing people's money

[02:22] Or making them wait forever and a day to get a game

[02:26] I mean there are still alien owners who don't have their games they paid for five years ago

[02:31] There are still big Lebowski owners who still don't have their games from six years ago

[02:36] There are people who ordered Raza who will never get a game from 11 years ago

[02:40] So I would never indict a company that has always delivered a product to people who ordered it

[02:47] A company that has consistently put games inside boxes

[02:51] So I hope you enjoyed this interview with David Fix

[02:54] I did, I think he did as well

[02:56] I know he did as well and we're gonna hang out at Expo in just a couple of weeks

[03:01] And for those of you out there who are in a Pimball company and are afraid to talk to Canada

[03:06] Listen to this show, listen to this show and tell me it wouldn't be a great conversation for you to come on

[03:12] And share with my listeners the number one Pimball podcasts in the world for a reason

[03:17] Share with all of my listeners the vision of your company

[03:20] I think it only benefits when people come on this show

[03:23] And as David said we're just grown adults talking about Pimball

[03:27] There's no drama, there's no hate

[03:30] I'm very tired, I've been spending many hours to make sure the volume levels on this show are really good

[03:36] And I think you're gonna enjoy it without any further ado

[03:39] Mr. David Fix from American Pimball

[03:42] Alright ladies and gentlemen I am super excited to have our special guest Mr. David Fix

[03:48] Director of Operations for American Pimball David, welcome to the show

[03:53] Thanks Chris, this could be on the show, how are you?

[03:55] I'm doing good, we were just talking about my sleepless week with Killian and how kids take up your Pimball funds for the year

[04:02] So that's how I'm doing right now, but it's good to have you here

[04:06] And I've been wanting to talk to American Pimball for a while, obviously I've had a lot of opinions about the company over the years

[04:12] And David, the first thing I wanted to ask you and everyone who's listening knows AP, they know who you are

[04:17] First question and no pun intended

[04:20] When you walk through the door at AP on day one, what stuff did you feel like needed to be fixed immediately?

[04:26] Well, when I walked through the door on day one there was not much to AP, it had to be rebuilt

[04:33] So there was a lot of things that needed attention and I was happy that the macheche and I sat down and said this is the vision

[04:43] And we went with it

[04:45] There were some things that needed to be addressed, first of all we didn't have a mechanical engineer

[04:50] We had software, we had nobody for art direction, we had nobody for video or animations

[04:57] You walk in and say, okay, here's the Pimball company and you're at, you know, but we did have people, now listen, we had Josh Kugler who was software

[05:08] And we had Joe Ballsriss, the game designer, and then we had, we had Ferret in software with Josh

[05:14] That was about it, and we had a team of people on the four building games

[05:19] One thing that was evident, the Houdini line was dark, the October fest line was kind of like non-existent and Hot Wheels was just rolling along

[05:29] I'm happy to say that October fest, Houdini and Hot Wheels right now are all scheduled to be run, we are back quarter on all three games and we're moving along

[05:41] Obviously David, you walk in and there's three titles already in the portfolio

[05:46] What did mukeche say to you? Like what was his ask of you in terms of the vision for AP moving forward?

[05:53] Well he asked me what I thought of the game, and I said we have to definitely address the games and make it enjoyable by the players

[06:02] Three games is a good backlog to start off with, but if you're not promoting it and not selling it, you know, you don't have it

[06:09] Look at Stern, look at how many games they have in their back catalog

[06:13] They're still making Batman, so making all virus, they're still making Iron Maiden, they're still making a bunch of these games

[06:20] They're going to be going on back into runs, so that kind of helps the company that you're not always waiting for the next game

[06:26] I had to like okay, we got to get the next game out to keep ourselves alive

[06:30] Is the goal then to make games that stay within favor for years down the road, so it's not that just short sales window and then on to the next

[06:39] But something that we can sell for many many years down the road

[06:42] Any company would love to keep selling the games down the road, and I guess licensing kind of holds your hand at that

[06:48] Usually you only have a three-year window, so after three years, whatever you didn't pump out in that three years, you have to go back and get a reissue on the license and then it's a year by year

[06:57] And then it usually is a lot more money, so the deal is try to get as many as you can out in that three years

[07:02] You know, so there is some things that kind of hold you back, but yes, you definitely want to have something that continues to move games along

[07:10] And so Mukesh asks you, what do you think of the games?

[07:13] Now, were you honest or did you have the structure?

[07:15] Oh yeah! Okay, and what did you think of let's go game by game, Houdini, what are your thoughts?

[07:19] I basically said to myself, Houdini is a tough game, it's not a player friendly game, it's the hardest game that you could possibly have out there

[07:27] It needs to have a little help to it to get it to be more friendly for the player

[07:33] I know I played Houdini, I love it, I'm a big theater magic fan, I have always like you know magic theme pens

[07:41] I've played pinball magic from Capcom, you know, there's a lot of games that I have, I mean, you know, at one point I was thinking about buying a magic girl

[07:49] You know, so when Houdini came out I was like, well, I'll play it, I played it at the show and I always felt like it just kind of stepped on my foot and said get lost

[07:57] You know, I kind of think so

[07:59] And then, October Fest, I kind of, I got it, I played the games, I didn't understand what market they were trying to go at

[08:07] Because October Fest is kind of a different art package, then I would have thought they would have done with that game

[08:15] I'm German, so I've been to October Fest many times here in the States and I just kind of broke my head about it

[08:22] And right out of the bat, there was a problem with the game

[08:26] You couldn't hit the barrel lock, which is the upper left ramp, off upper right flipper

[08:33] You know, there's that magnetic grab and then you let it throw and then you lock it in the barrel lock

[08:38] And for the longest time, I said, you know, you guys have to fix this and it was like crickets

[08:44] Well, one thing when I started AP, I kind of told everybody you have to fix this and they said, oh, we did

[08:49] We have a coil, we have this, we have all this stuff that, you know, code that helps fix that lock

[08:55] And I said, how long have you had it out? And I said, oh, about a year and a half

[08:58] And I said, I've owned the game, I have a game in location and I've never been notified

[09:03] So immediately we got on the ball and told all the distributors and all the people who registered the games that there's a fix for the game to help them

[09:13] And I think that was very well received by the public because we sent out a lot of coils and it stops them

[09:18] We sent out a lot of stuff to help people who have actual professed out there, you know, and it kind of helped the image of the company

[09:25] Because here we're reaching out to people on a game that's been out already like two years and telling them, hey, you've been having problems

[09:31] Here's the fix, if you haven't already fixed it, here's how we can do this and help you

[09:35] Right. The third title, Hot Wheels, which is their first license game. We're going to talk a little bit about, you know, the difference between the license and the unlicensed games in the marketplace. So what were your thoughts on Hot Wheels?

[09:46] Hot Wheels was a great game. Let's put it this way. When I played it, the marketing rollout on that game, not so hot.

[09:57] And then of course it hit the AMOW show in Louisiana and then literally two, three weeks later we shut down the whole country because of COVID

[10:07] And a lot of things got paused and by the time they got the game on the line there were some other problems and when they got back from COVID they started rolling through and then they moved the location of the factory to another factory to the new location

[10:22] Where we have two game lines looking at a third and there was that whole period where it's just not rolled out right, you know, and when I played the game, I liked it.

[10:33] It reminded me of high speed, getaway, good flow game, nice speed, it fit that genre. And I was like, okay, what's this TV show?

[10:47] I mean, I don't understand where they got all these video clips, these are cool, but then I discovered the YouTube channel and then it was kind of like, I was like, this is a good game. It's a fun game.

[10:59] I said this on other podcasts, if American pinball would have brought out hot wheels, this is their very first game, then act or profess, then who, Dini, it would have been different because it's the progression, you know, the hot wheels was that game that kind of easy game, people know it.

[11:17] Who Dini's that players game, that game that's really tough and I like to say that and we have people who are buying these games, especially who Dini that are high players in the industry, people who are playing internaments because they like this challenge of this game with the tight game and tough to play, but they like playing it because it builds up their skills levels.

[11:40] And also I think, David, when you look at each of these games, I mean, who Dini was packed with, with mechs and toys and features and had probably one of the most dramatic incredible that milk can shot is still one of the coolest things I've seen in a pinball machine.

[11:54] And October Fest was also loaded and hot wheels, you know, arguably, I've made fun of the fact that it was stripped down more, you know, there weren't loop de loops, there weren't jumps, there weren't car washes in it.

[12:05] I think that hurt hot wheels as well. It seemed a little bit like stuff was being taken out and if you had started there, you would have been progressively adding more into the game.

[12:15] Well, here's a nice thing at Christmas. I'm just going to say it this way. The game's not over, right?

[12:20] We continue to go back and look at our games. There are things called mods. So we might do some mods for our games that people can buy that might increase the playability or the coolness factor that

[12:34] is a little wonderland under glass as you like to call it. So you're saying, you're saying, David, we might one day, and again, this is what you're just talking hypothetical.

[12:41] There might be a loop de loop or something you could add physically to a game like hot wheels. Yeah, yeah, maybe a jump room.

[12:48] All right, well, that's great. I mean, I've always wondered why they only look at the code as things you could add because the world can be added to.

[12:56] These are dioramas under the glass. And so that is going to be really interesting. So we might see a sort of hot wheels plus down the road maybe sometime in the future.

[13:05] Here's the thing. I've said this to the team and just know that, you know, I'm a collector at heart. I come from this industry. You know, I was first a collector. Then I repaired games. And then, you know, I was doing expo and then all this other stuff.

[13:19] And I just been in the hobby for a bit, but I'm still a collector. I'm the kind of guy that has pinball machines and I like them, but I don't want to be the guy who buys machine.

[13:29] And then version two comes out and my game is nothing now. You know what I'm saying? So I've always explained to the team, if we do come out with something that increases the game or helps the game, it's going to be for all the back games too.

[13:45] It's going to be a mod that can be done with hot wheels number one, the hot wheels, whatever the number is. Right. And the same thing with Houdini. We do something for Houdini. It's got to go all the way back to Houdini number one and be a mod to help all that and make it an option for all the collectors out there to upgrade their machines if they want to.

[14:05] If they don't then they don't have to, but I don't want to be the kind of guy that says, okay, you can't have this black light on your game anymore or you know, I want to make it available to everybody.

[14:16] No, it makes total sense. It's why I tell people they're never going to redo ghost busters and close the flipper gap. Stern could never do that because they would piss off all the original buyers of that game.

[14:27] This is different. This is adding stuff, which the engineers could figure out solutions to enhance the gameplay, which I think is really interesting. David, let me ask you about being a collector and you obviously I'm assuming started your collection sometime in the 90s moving forward or have you been collecting for longer than that.

[14:44] No, actually, 90, well, 96 was the first year I bought a machine kind of. It was it's a long story. I think I've shared it on other podcasts and then my wife and I we we were big pinball players in the 90s when we got married. We did the married thing, right?

[15:02] We settled down. We were responsible. We didn't go out the bars. We had pay bills. We had apartment. We had all these other expenditures. We're getting to know what it's like to live with each other.

[15:12] But about a year or two after that, we bought our first house and then we were like, you know what? Let's go out to some of our favorite places. I was in Elbrich, New Mexico. I'm a pinball and we went out that night. We were playing it.

[15:25] We cut the night short and we said, let's go back to our favorite haunt. We went back and they were all gone. So I started buying machines then. It was maybe about six months later. I got the bug.

[15:37] How much was a machine back then? So I'll tell you the first two machines I bought. I bought two machines right out of the back. I bought the husband and wife. I bought pinball and the bride pinball.

[15:47] I paid 800 or pinball and I paid 1200 or bride pinball. So $1,000. That means two.

[15:55] Right now, everyone is saying you can't even get a topper in the marketplace today and you got the entire game. David, what's interesting? Obviously prices are exploding.

[16:05] Oh, big thing.

[16:06] I want to talk about the modern collector. What are your views on the modern collector, the guy who's buying every Ellie or collector's edition?

[16:14] Because you collected back then collecting was more about collecting them in your home because nobody really did. Now it's blown up into more of the limited version.

[16:24] You know, the one of 500, the one of a thousand. What are your thoughts on modern pinball collecting? And is that something you want to weave into the marketing strategy for American pinball?

[16:34] It's an interesting question. So let me think about that for a second.

[16:38] Well, where is going? I mean, listen, I'm still a collector. I mean, I sent you a picture. I think last week when we were trying to get the show, give me on the show.

[16:48] And you know, my schedule has just been crazy because I'm doing expo and I'm doing American pinball. And then I was at Chicago and I was able to play Godzilla.

[16:58] So I got to play the premium Godzilla and I got to play the pro Godzilla and because I was at a trade show where it was that. And I will tell you that I looked at it and I was like, wow, I like the premium Godzilla.

[17:10] It was it played better. And I think it's kind of that in the heart. People are going to buy a where they're going to put their money.

[17:18] And they're going to pay that money or they're going to wait and kind of broker it. They'll sell off to other machines to get that one machine.

[17:28] Or you know, it's always been a hobby of by low and sell high kind of thing. I mean, when I was kind of in the hobby, when Craigslist started up, it was like the Wild Well West.

[17:39] People had it on their phones. People were sitting there. They're making purchases in split seconds, guys and towns were running over to somebody's house paying cash for a pinball machine.

[17:50] And I'll tell you a funny story. Chris, I haven't shared the story that often, but I had people that I dealt with and he fires. Okay, back in the day. And I said, listen, if you find any pinball machines in your roundabouts, just buy them and I'll pay him.

[18:05] Pay him back for you and I gave him price tag. You find an EM between 100 500. I'll just buy it. If anything's all at stake, up to a thousand. Okay, just just know that.

[18:15] So I got a phone call Thursday and it was one of my guys and he goes, yeah, I bought you a pinball machine. It's $400. And I said to him, I said, okay, I'm going into a meeting. Are you going to be around tomorrow Friday? And I'll swing out and pick it up. And he said, yeah, that's that's fine.

[18:34] So I go into the meeting and it was one of these I worked for a large financial company. It was a knockdown, dragout and a quarter. You know, nobody's doing their job kind of thing. We're all, you know, everybody's jobs. I don't know, you know, those, those kind of mean it just feel like you walk out. You're like, and then I go to lunch and then my phone explodes.

[18:53] And it's all my buddies in the West New York area and they're saying the deal this century just went down and some lucky S.O.B. got the best deal in town because of fun house from Williams hopped up for $400 and was gone.

[19:09] And I was like, wow, who was that? That's amazing. You know, that kind of thing. And literally I forgot the guy called me and then one day morning he calls me up. I thought you were coming over on Friday. I said, I'm sorry, I forgot all about it. I said, what did you buy me?

[19:25] Since I bought you a fun house for $400. And I was like, I walked into my bosses offices. I have something I got to do this afternoon and went right out to the bank, got $400 and went down with the truck picked up the game and I had a fun house for $400.

[19:40] You know, David, when people hear this story and I've been saying it recently, I feel like there's no more deals. Do you feel like those days are over? No, no, I still am striking deals. They're not a weird fight.

[19:52] They're not as fluff rose they used to be, but you know, you can still strike deals. My buddy Frankie, he's probably listening to this. He's going to be like, beat me up, but he he landed around this whole summer during COVID and he was picking up pins for anywhere between $500 and $1,500.

[20:12] He was buying not the top of the lines, but he was buying some good games games that I would have paid like $8,900, you know, like a meteor or, you know, a space shuttle or you know something along those lines.

[20:25] I mean, these were titles that could be picked up, but he was he was really working at hard. I mean, he was hitting like tons and tons of Craigslist all over the place and being trying the first one to call the person saying, hey, you got that Paragon?

[20:40] You want to sell it for $800 or $900? I have the money. I'll be there in about an hour and you know, and he literally got in the truck and just drove and then picked up the game. So it's just have to be kind of like, it's not the deals you can get in your city, however, but yeah, you got to do work, right? I mean, most guys are just on the internet trying to find deals on Pinside and eBay and just nothing exists there.

[21:02] So David, let me ask you about the approach by most modern pinball companies to sort of drive that FOMO with the collector base, right? The fear of missing out. I've got to get the Godzilla on day one. I've got to get Iron Maiden day one or sold out. You're seeing this and you're seeing how these men are just throwing money when the theme is right and the supply is limited. These games are selling out like overnight.

[21:25] Are you guys going to start to adopt that and are you looking at this and saying we need to jump on this train and find a way to create this kind of FOMO?

[21:34] Well, that's an interesting question because we have kind of done that since the since I've been there. One of the things we did was we are now having two versions of a games. We have a deluxe and we have a classic in the classic will be standard run of the games.

[21:51] And the next game we have coming out will be a deluxe in a classic that the luxe will be limited and when it's done, it's done. So order when you're ready. There's a couple different things going on with that because as a manufacturer, Chris, it's kind of interesting.

[22:07] You're going to run the numbers right so you're thinking, all right, am I going to sell all these clat deluxe or premiums or am I going to sell all these LE models?

[22:18] I mean, I remember when the transformers came out and they had the three models right they had the decepticon, the Autobots and then they had the dual version right and those were the ones that was really tricky for them to do and it was kind of the fear of missing out.

[22:35] And then it didn't work 100% but now I can see it working even more because the collector bases broke. It's huge. I mean, well, these guys now, David are like buying this pen site unseen.

[22:47] Oh, yeah, I'm the kind of guy that like and I've said this many times. I don't buy a game off a theme. I actually want to go play it.

[22:53] But you know that when you see these sales now that that's not happening. I mean nobody played spooky's new games. Nobody's played Godzilla. Nobody played Mandalorian.

[23:02] So on some level, seeing this in the marketplace, are you saying to your team, like we need to make these games like themes that people want. We also need to make them visually stunning that before anyone even flips the ball they want to own it.

[23:16] Like is there tap into some of that sort of just like visceral reaction people have to sing a game with never flipping it?

[23:22] Yeah, you know, there are certain things that listen Chris. I mean, I looked at Godzilla and I was like, I want to play that.

[23:31] Okay. And I think any player can look at a game and say, I want to play that. Okay. I think of one of the other games that's turned brought out. And I was like, not really.

[23:43] You know, but there's some things for every was it was it Mandalorian or was it leds upward because I'm going to read I'm going to hold off my.

[23:51] However, I will tell you I have played every pin that has been released except for the one from spooky except for Raza.

[24:01] Yeah, well, yeah, no joke. Okay, so moving forward, American pinball is going to have a classic and a deluxe edition. Let's talk about the future of AP because there's a lot of excitement.

[24:12] I know I've been critical, but I've said that I always believe the quality of your machines is top notch and that is a really important standard.

[24:21] You've got the quality, you've got the confidence in the product. Now, where do you go? Where do you go to create that demand?

[24:27] What kind of themes are you guys looking at? What's the future?

[24:30] So the future is an element. Thank you for about the product and the quality. But let me tell you, manufacturing is not an easy thing.

[24:38] And I give hats off to all the other guys. We all face challenges. We all have face problems, our play fields or whatever. I mean, we've all had those problems.

[24:47] They are they're dedicated to trying to help the customer.

[24:51] So our goal is to be that company that is there to help everybody. We really, really want to be that company that's going to be on inside.

[25:02] We want to be the company that's on other forms that the return calls within within 20, 30 minutes or even pick up the phone and walk people through their problems to make sure that they're happy with their purchase.

[25:14] We got that solid. Now we're building the core. Okay. So think about it. You have a company that's kind of I call it gutted at the beginning has really good bone.

[25:25] Okay. It's got a good good back catalog. It's got knows how to make the games needs a vision. You know, the vision is coming together.

[25:32] We have a lot of businesses on board. Sophia, you know, Jack and all these key players, Josh and and Joe show everybody is on board here. And we're now we have the vision now.

[25:43] Let me get them the budget to kind of build these games. Let's build from the ground up. You can't like this. Go out and go. Okay.

[25:50] We're going to pay a million dollars for a license. You know, you can't do it. You got to be a little bit more budget conscious. But does that mean down the road?

[25:58] We couldn't know if it's possible. We're I mean, listen, we have high hopes and we're looking at the a lot of we are looking at a lot of licenses right now.

[26:09] It's interesting because when you look at these games and you look at the volume clearly the big themes drive big volume. And at these prices now, we'll talk price in a little bit because the prices keep going up right now.

[26:21] And early from Jersey Jack is 11,000 stern. Ali is 10.5. It's crazy. These are these prices are 30 40% more than they were just a few years ago. Clearly there's millions there. If you can sell a few thousand, we've heard Joe Balsa in the past say that the target for American pinball was 1000 games sold of the first few titles was their target.

[26:43] Not going to ask you for numbers because I know that's rude and no one's going to give them out anyway. But what is your target moving forward? Do you want to be a company that sells a few thousand a year? Can you make that many or do you want to make what you can without back logging the manufacturing and getting multiple titles out of year?

[27:02] Because I think I heard you say too you want to get at least two titles out of year. So how big do you want to be? Well, we want to be big in the market. You know where the market is going to let us run. We're going to get into it. I will say that we have goals. You know, any company has to be profitable but how many machines they make? Okay. So I have a goal for next year. I have the goal for the year after that. And where we going for those goals are some nice numbers. I will just use this as an illustration. And I don't need to throw all this history into you guys.

[27:31] But Gottlieb and Paul used to say making three thousand games a year is kind of like the sweet spot. If you're making over three thousand games a year, you are in the driver's seat. Okay. And to start putting numbers together for whatever it is back catalog forward catalog, whatever it is is to have the the factory doing it. Now I'm happy to say we have two game lines and we're cranking them out.

[27:59] They have not stopped since they've been there. We don't have delays to the point where we shut down the entire game line. We've been able to crank out X amount of games every week and fill orders containers and make sure that everybody's happy and continue to move along. In fact, we have now backlog, which is surprising to, you know, Mikesh and a few people that were at American and saying we've never had this problem. But now it's a nice problem to have. You know, so we're working on it.

[28:29] David, talk to me about the people that actually build these machines. How many workers do you have at AP and are they temp workers? Are they full time full time? Okay. I can walk. I could walk you through him. Here's the nice thing. I'm the kind of guy who's always been hands on every time I'm in Chicago because I'm in Buffalo. Every time I'm in the Chicago, I walked the line and I talked every worker. I know all of them by name. And I just find out how they're all doing. We have people there that have been.

[28:59] Full time. Couple of guys were on there from Udini when it was first, but manufactured. We have some people there from Stern. We have some people from other manufacturers that are there. And they found a home. Their family. The treatment is family. We take care of them. And they're happy. You know, they want to be there. And we're growing as a family, which is a great thing. I've been fortunate work for companies that treat people like family and bring that mentality that we're all on the same team and that the president of company wants to know when they're going to be there.

[29:29] And somebody's they're getting married. Okay. Or somebody else is having a baby. You know, we let's chip in a card and get them something to babies or us. Or what are some kind of a nice little gift card to help them out. How many total employees is AP have right now?

[29:45] Like see, I think we're about 50, 50. I think there's a 15 to 20 on the line right now. We're bringing on some more. We're bringing out about another 10 people to the line to help out. So and then we have the front office. And then we have back lines that are working on like self assemblies. So we have a good amount of people in there. Now let's talk about what everybody wants me to ask is when do we think the next title from American pinball will surface when it's ready.

[30:12] I just I know everybody's asking me when is it going to happen when is it going to happen is it going to happen here is it going to happen there. Listen, this thing called COVID first of all, I want to say, and I just say this that I feel sorry for all the families in the United States who have lost loved ones due to this pandemic. And it's been a real challenge for a lot of people. There's a lot of people who've lost their lives due to this pandemic.

[30:37] Everyone knows someone everyone's been impacted. And so obviously there's supply shortages. Is that one of the issues, David, just getting parts to make the next game.

[30:45] Absolutely. It's kind of funny. I fight this little thing at American pinball. I call it the firefighter. Okay, I feel like I have a fire extinguisher. And I run around, you know, there's chip shortages. There's other problems. Listen, I was I was at a trade show. I very told you in Chicago and Gary Stern was talking about how he's having chip shortages too.

[31:04] He's not just me. It's other people and look Stern usually has three titles out. Right. Right now. Right. And they have two out. So, but they have a bad catalog. They're working. There's a lot of other manufacturers who are also facing. So when you jump in.

[31:17] And the first three months, you're like, okay, we got this. We got this. We got this. Great. We can get this done. We'll get the parts in. We can start shipping this out. We can move this on. And we'll work on the bad catalog. We get those parts in and we could do this.

[31:30] And then your stuff sitting. It's been delayed shipping problems or whatever. And it's not one week, not two week. It's eight weeks. How do you work with eights?

[31:41] And I will say that one of the things American has done really worked on. And this is one of the things I really wanted was I wanted to have two suppliers. Somebody that I could say, okay, he's making my parts maybe wherever.

[31:53] South America or wherever. But I also have a, I also have somebody here on the other side that I don't worry about a container, get stuck somewhere. You know what I'm saying? I can bring parts in from everybody. So we really started working on that. And it's not been an easy title to kind of do all that. But it's a long run.

[32:10] Is that I'm making sure enough to these lines. So I have two ways of bringing in parts. Yeah. That makes the complete sense. So let me ask broadly. Do we think we'll see a new game this year?

[32:21] Yeah, we're seeing a new game this year. Are we seeing two games this year? No.

[32:25] And you've said before and I just want to clarify for a listener of the show that next game is going to be one from the junior design team. It's not going to be denises. And I'm assuming I think you've mentioned it. It's an unlicensed theme. Correct?

[32:37] Correct.

[32:38] Okay, let's talk a little bit about that because I know that's one one of the things I talk a lot on this show is the power of theme, the power of nostalgia, the power of artwork, the power of putting something out there that people emotionally connect with. How do you market an original IP game today?

[32:56] So you market an original IP game based on the thoughts of what people want. Okay, what's the genre? Is it comedy? Is it action? Is it adversary? Is it drama?

[33:10] I'm not going out building a river run through it pinball machine where you're fishing. That just doesn't make sense. But building a game that's kind of like black night, you know, an adversary game or build a game that's kind of funny, like an attack from Mars.

[33:26] You can understand something Chris. A license isn't something you just tack onto a game. If you tack a license onto a game you end up with games like Mandalorian.

[33:36] No, I've been saving it. No, Mandalorian is designed around that theme. I'm thinking of games.

[33:44] Well, David, what's the upper play field have to do with the show? I'm just going to ask you like it's just rotating helmet. Anyway, it's a cool feature. You know, you want that little world under glare. So you want to think outside of the box.

[33:55] Right. I thought outside of the box. He gave you something. You know, I wish that idea stayed outside the box. But yeah.

[34:01] So yeah, well, okay, so walk walk me through because I'm really curious. Yeah, so you think about it. We have to take a license, right? And then you work with a license. Now I will tell you that George Gomez and I have had this discussion and a license.

[34:15] The license is like a two-edged sword. Okay. Yes, you get this awesome scene, right? But then you need the license here to give you permission for the actors and the actresses, all this other stuff because you do the contracts and so forth.

[34:30] You might not get it all. There's reasons that some games are missing characters, right? So that's the two-edged sword. And sometimes you always wait on the license. And then you have this really cool idea. You take it to the license. And they go, I don't get it. I don't like it. Take that out of there.

[34:44] Can we change that to something else? Yeah, they have full control. You're at the mercy of them. Absolutely. And we're seeing that right now with Halloween. If you've seen what's been going on there with the movie clips, it's exactly your point is the license holder is only giving them so much. And the expectations of the fans is much higher. It seems then the assets they have. And it leads to some disappointment.

[35:07] I think Charlie can work with them and he will be continuing to work. And Charlie's a good guy. I've known Charlie way back when we're men with half exposed, you know, all those years back when he had a podcast.

[35:20] And I remember watching the kids grow up. Listen, I remember when Bug was kid. I remember when he was like 12. He was Charlie time. He'll work that out.

[35:27] There was a game that was brought out years and years ago, which it was a near and dear title to me. And it was called Jetson. I loved it. But it was missing all the callouts. There was no voice actors, no characters in the entire game. And it kind of was like, okay.

[35:43] So that starts with the licensing at the beginning. So when you go to the license, you got to say, okay, this is what I need. These are all the extra things I need with it.

[35:52] This is what we're going to pay. Oh, you want a billion dollars. Okay. Then let's renegotiate and find out what we can figure out.

[35:59] Because everybody wants something. And nothing's for free anymore.

[36:02] Let's talk pricing and unlicensed theme. Obviously we're seeing these prices skyrocket over the last few years.

[36:08] How do you price your future games? Are you looking at the market seeing pretty much everything that's new in box getting consumed hand over fist.

[36:17] Are you going to be the deluxe edition? Are you guys going to be around 10 grand? Are you guys still? No, no, no, no.

[36:23] No, we're not going to be raising the prices crazy. No, listen, we're going to try. And this is a mentality with Mekesha and I to kind of continue to keep the line on the price of our game.

[36:37] We're going to try to toe the line. If the price has to go up a little bit, we'll adjust it.

[36:42] And right now I hate to say this, but we have a little surcharge on all our game. But every day and every week I meet with the team trying to get us to the point where we can cut that surcharge off.

[36:54] I want to get back to the price tags where collectors and people who are getting into this industry want to be in there.

[37:05] And it's not just Chris, I shared this with other people, but I'm going to share this with you. The collectors is a strong group of people.

[37:14] There's this whole other group of people that aren't going to buy the games at $10,000 and that's the point operators.

[37:21] And those are the guys who back in the 80s, you was extravagant to have a pinball machine in your house, right?

[37:28] And this leads me to a question I wanted to ask you. What's the first game you ever played? Where was it?

[37:33] That's a tough one because it must have been mid 90s and Nathan's arcade on Central Avenue in Yonkers, New York.

[37:43] And I remember obviously I was more of a arcade fanatic. I mean, I loved our Cates.

[37:49] But it most likely was probably like a Adam's family or a Twilight zone. I don't remember because I didn't grow up into pinball.

[37:58] I was into much more like mid 80s early 90s arcade games. And I would play pinball as I was waiting for people to get off of like street fighter too.

[38:06] And the reason why I got bit by the pinball bug, a lot of people probably grew up more into arcade games.

[38:13] I just love the randomness of it and I love the fact that you can own a machine and every game is different.

[38:19] When I built my arcade, I put video games in it and Donkey Kong and Pac-Man and it gets old.

[38:25] And then I put it Lord the Rings pinball machine in my apartment and I always enjoyed playing it.

[38:31] And ever since I've just felt that pinball has stood the test of time because of that random chaos we love.

[38:39] I give you 100% on that. And you know what? So I will tell you that as a young man, my uncle, I don't know how he knew this.

[38:46] He had heard about a new game being released at a mall at the Atlanta Castle in Eerie PA.

[38:53] And he looks it up and it's a black knight and he's like, oh, the black knight machine is there in the light.

[38:59] What's the black knight machine? You know, for the first time I was just knowing what this machine was.

[39:04] And we walked into the arcade and we see the black knight and he has a line.

[39:09] He said to the game, you know, that kind of thing and it's just crazy.

[39:12] But I said to my uncle, I said, hey, can I play the Pac-Man? He said, no, no, no, no.

[39:15] We have the Pac-Man at home on the video games. We had an Atari 2600 or whatever he had. He had the coolest stuff at the time.

[39:21] We play the unique games that you can't play at home. And then I said, okay.

[39:27] So I've always found pinball machines and I was always playing them.

[39:30] And I was playing ski ball machines and basketball machines and arcade machines that, you know, stuff that you couldn't get, you know, the famous Chuck E. Cheesehead that was at the beat the marvelous guy with the arm wrestling game.

[39:42] You know, that was the kind of cool game that I remember.

[39:45] Let me ask you about the point you raised about operators versus home buyers, right?

[39:51] Because there's a huge difference of a need state for those two audiences.

[39:57] Obviously, Stern has a really nice model that works with the pro model being most likely on operator needs to draw people in.

[40:04] The home collector likes more of the bells and whistles, more of the mechanisms you yourself said you preferred Godzilla premium.

[40:11] And that premium model, right, sort of like is designed to a piece both or be that middle ground with the Ellie being for the high end collector.

[40:19] As you see AP games moving forward, do you want to make them easier for operators?

[40:24] Will that be the classic edition? And are you going to have more features in the deluxe edition?

[40:29] Absolutely. So the deluxe is a deluxe. The classic is going to be geared more to the operator, the street location.

[40:38] Here's the nice thing. I think about it. I found pinball machines in the wild.

[40:43] Okay, I've always had. And I played them. That's how I learned all the titles and all the games that I played before even going to expo.

[40:49] Okay, and I love going to expo because that's when I was introduced to games that I had never seen because my operator wasn't carrying capcom games or he wasn't carrying Elvengees or whatever.

[40:59] So we had that chance to just enjoy finding new games and finding new worlds under glass as it were.

[41:06] So, you know, the operator wants to put stuff out and trust me, the operators are looking for machines, but they want machines that are out there that are going to last.

[41:15] Built like a tank, run, and they don't have to crack it open to fix it. So we have a game right now. Hot Wheels is out on location in a secret location from a big distributor in Maine.

[41:29] Okay, up in Massachusetts area. And it's doing really great. And I met with the distributor, the guy who's the founding guy of the distribution.

[41:39] And I said, so I see the point that the catch box is doing really good. You know what? I don't look at the catch box. This guy has been in the industry for like 50 years.

[41:48] I said, you don't look at the catch box. You know, I look at the service report. I have to tell you I haven't had to open the machine yet. And I love it.

[41:55] And that's why I'm very new game. Right. Because I didn't have to open it up. And if an operator doesn't have to open it up, just what that's more ROI. Return investment. He just got to show up and collect it and wipe it down.

[42:06] Dave, talk to me about quality. And I've always said that American pinball quality is really one of the highlights that people have felt owning an AP game.

[42:15] Who makes your playfields? Because I want to start there because that's been the major topic I've been harping on is you got to get the foundation right and nobody wants to see a play field deteriorate. Who makes your guys play fields?

[42:26] It's better. Bader kept. Okay. Those are the same ones that make Charlie's Bay play fields actually. And see what's happening right. You're witnessing a lot of people spend a lot of money.

[42:36] There's been issues with Jersey Jack games. Are you going to promote that more? I always feel like if Bader is making a playfield, it's kind of like Intel inside. I would have that as the first line item of when you buy from us, you're going to get a bulletproof play field.

[42:50] Yep. And I said this before. I said to anybody if it has a problem with one of my play fields that is falling apart. Call me. I'll buy it back. I'll fix it. I'll do whatever I need to do to get it taken care of.

[43:03] Is there anything you want to ask me about the industry and my coverage of it or my coverage of AP? No. I mean, listen, you know, we're all big boys. We're all adults in the industry.

[43:14] I mean, it's not like you're doing something a little bit different. Okay. So I mean, everybody has their slant. I know some people, you know, they're all like, oh my goodness, you're going on Canada? Oh, man, he's going to, you know, he's and I'm like, no, he's, you know, we're all adults.

[43:30] We know how to have a conversation and talk about stuff. I saw that someone was saying that I threatened you to come on. Was it a threat? I thought it was a nice invitation.

[43:40] It was an invitation, but you also threw out the invitation. So please, anybody who knows day fix, please tell me that I love to have them on the show. You know, they're kind of things.

[43:50] I've got a few phone calls from some people going, you know, Chris is asking for you to come on the show. I'm like, yeah, I know. Yeah, I've got this. I've got this crazy Facebook live following that that can go off and do my random errands for me. Well, David. So we're going to see a game this year. Will it be at expo? Yeah, I'm studying for it to be at expo. Yeah. Now this is news. I because I don't think that anyone knows that yet. And I'm going to be at expo. You're going to be at expo. The game is going to be a hopefully at expo.

[44:18] Do you guys have a seminar or a panel discussion at expo lined up? Yep. Thursday night. Thursday night, 7 o'clock. Okay, so Thursday night, 7 o'clock. I think I'm going to have to fly in early and check it out.

[44:30] Let me ask you a question. Have you been to any expo? I've been to many expos. And how did I never meet you? I mean, I run the stupid thing with a robber.

[44:39] I mean, it's because I spend the whole show in the bathroom. No, the reason why I don't know. I mean, I think that I've only been to I think I've been to two expos.

[44:51] But I think I've only been to one when I had my show. And that's when I think I had a little bit more exposure, if you will, in the hobby.

[44:59] But we're going to definitely hang out and have beers at this expo and just chat because I really look forward to just meeting folks like yourself and the fans.

[45:09] I mean, how hard has it been? Right? Just the last two years that the community is really what makes this hobby so special.

[45:15] And I've been part of this community for a long time. You know, I've been doing expo. We've been doing a lot of things. And that's the thing I'm bringing to American Bimbal.

[45:24] And I didn't have to bring it hard was that we are a community of collectors who want to be there. Listen, Josh Kugler designed his own game.

[45:35] And he brought it as a homebrew way back when and then he got a job for American Michael Grant, my sales guy.

[45:43] He was a player out in New England area and wanted to come in to be a sales guy for American Bimbal. Dave Brennan, he's a tech guy who wanted to be my service rep. Dennis, he's been in business in ball for a long time.

[45:57] I mean, there's a passion of the collectors and they want to bring and that's what we're bringing together at American Bimbal. We're bringing people together that want to be there. It's not a paycheck.

[46:09] They're trying to make this great world under glass. And is it going to be licensed or unlicensed? No, it happens.

[46:16] You know what? Some of the designers love the idea of an unlicensed game because creativity runs crazy.

[46:22] You know, I know you guys are like, did you see the last two games that were unlicensed, but really were they think about this Chris?

[46:30] And I'm not harping on anybody and I'm not going to go into details on this, but I asked yourself about those last two titles that were unlicensed.

[46:36] Where's the games that were third or a continuation? Were they really totally all new story?

[46:47] Right. And we're talking Black Knight and Dildin or am I missing one?

[46:52] Oh, okay. But think about it. If you take Dildin, you know, I know a lot of people listen to that game and they were like, okay, what is that? Is that whirlwind? Is that Earthshaker? Is that, you know, this is a combination of these games? I mean, it feels a little bit like a granted all new graphics.

[47:11] I mean, they put in a lot of graphics that looks like a beautiful game and listen, how was that expo when that was released? And there was 300 people.

[47:20] And I'm arranging this thing for, you know, Jack and saying, Jack, we're going to roll out the red carpet for you guys.

[47:26] And I will tell you that we got a little delayed because of somebody else's shenanigans, which delayed Jack getting in and then Jack, we shoved everybody out.

[47:35] We said, we're going to make this your your your fun thing. We opened the door. We filled the room 300 people. We released it.

[47:41] And listen, they had eight games. There are people were playing it. There was line out the door. People were enjoying it. It was just a hit.

[47:49] And it just little by little people, people there are people out there who love Dildin, loved it. And then they still do. And it still earns, you know, it's out on location.

[47:59] And there's people out there who love Black Knight sort of rage. I mean, it's the third one in the in the title. It has all new graphics. It had, I mean, Steve put a lot of time into that.

[48:09] So the Tim Sexton, they put a lot of time in developing the code and making that just really, really good.

[48:16] Okay. And they really gave it, but all they're all to it.

[48:20] But it was a continuation. Right. So I'm saying you come out with something that hasn't been thought of, you know, I mean, think about it.

[48:28] Mortal combat when it came out, was there something that was close to Mortal Combat? No, it was it was banned. I mean, do you remember all the problems Mortal Combat caused in schools when it came out and teachers petitioning and parents petitioning our case to take Mortal Combat out because it was too graphically violent.

[48:47] Well, everything has to have a beginning, right? And I think that's the point you're making is even all the licenses we love at one point started as an original IP.

[48:56] So talk me about, and I've said this on the show before, junior designer, because you mentioned Steve Richie and Pat Lawler to icons with a huge pedigree in the industry that have a following.

[49:07] How do you roll out a junior designer? And I've been saying on my show Dave that I wouldn't call anyone a junior designer. They're still designers.

[49:14] It feels like the JV team. Is it that or are you going to have these guys all on the same sort of plateau? No, and listen, just because I call them a junior designer, it does not mean that they're not a designer. This is their bread and butter.

[49:28] Okay, this means it's their first rollout. Okay, I mean, I think about it. You have Keith L. Okay. He brought this game to Stern, right? It was um, archer.

[49:40] And thank you. And it was just an I played archer, you know, I played archer when it was still at expo, you know, so it was this amazing game.

[49:49] They turn it into iron maiden. So and this is the thing we continue to support. And this is something I shared with Dennis is that it's a dentist.

[49:59] You're not a young man. We need to support this hobby. We need to support this with younger people and share your knowledge and he's all about it.

[50:09] So, you know, even though the next one is a junior designer, it doesn't mean they had meetings. They they did. And it wasn't like Dennis said you have to change all of it. No, he made the decisions. Dennis said we could do this. You could do that at the end of the day.

[50:22] That designer that wasn't Dennis had to make the final call. Okay, this was his vision. This is what he wanted to do. But it's his first game. And it's not the gate. It's not the JV team. Right. Right.

[50:34] You know, how's Dennis doing? So obviously Dennis got out of deep root. He's the canary in the coal mine. And his LV is people love LV. He's now over there. He's where his first game is licensed. Correct. It is not. No. Okay.

[50:50] Yeah, because because we're here's the thing. He is his his first game with us will not be licensed because it takes a year to get it. So he's literally working very hard on his game that he's bringing out with which is, you know, driving the team crazy. But it's okay. That creativity is is is a gift. And then he's already working on the next. We already have the next four games kind of lined up. And then Dennis is already working on a license. So he's got that. So we're working on things. We're just slowly bringing this.

[51:19] And we have some surprises along the way. You know, so. Okay. And who's doing art direction? You mentioned that at the very beginning because I have said critically that I thought the biggest mistake with Houdini was they should have rolled with the Matt Andrews art package because that's the one thing. J. Pop gave them on the Houdini was was a nice visual pop. I know they went more steam punk. But who's going to help make this company visually stand out, especially with like what's going to happen.

[51:49] And then he's going to be a star in God and Jersey Jack. These games now are more beautiful than they've ever been. So who's going to help you guys? It's it's Jack. Hey, Jack Hager is been in the industry for a long time. Jack Niger was one of the founding home founding art guys that he really worked on moral combat. He worked on a bunch of other games at Williams.

[52:10] Has his work appeared on anything to date at AP? Nothing yet. No, he has not done any of the original three games. Okay. And is he working on the next title coming out? Yes.

[52:18] Okay. So this is going to be a big expo. So are you excited? David, is there going to be a moment in which you pulled the curtain off? How you guys going to do this?

[52:25] You have to wait and see. Because who knows? It might be before expo. I don't know. You have to wait and see.

[52:32] You know, we've only got what three and a half weeks. So it's an exciting time.

[52:37] Well, think about it. Here I'm also working for expo. I'm the director of the vendor hall chairman. I sit down the board with Rob Burke and we sit down and we're figuring out.

[52:51] I'm in meetings at night and my wife is like, who are you? You do all these podcasts. I'm sure your wife gives you a little grief too.

[52:59] You get to slow down a little bit. Is she giving you that grief? Absolutely. Absolutely.

[53:04] And we're passionate because we want to be about it. Yeah. And that's that's the thing, right? Is I mean, we all love Pimball. And I love doing this show. And I love talking to folks like yourself, David.

[53:15] But it takes over for me. I mean, this is not my job. I mean, sometimes I wish it was. I have to go in and do a day job. Come home at night.

[53:22] My wife just put killing to bed and you might have heard him crying in the back.

[53:25] Yeah, you're right. And then I have to hop on a call with with Disney tonight to talk some business. So it never stops, especially during COVID.

[53:34] So this is sort of like my escape or my retreat from the nonstop work that we're all sort of suffering through during COVID.

[53:42] David, this has been a great hour. I really do appreciate you coming on. Is there anything else you want to talk about? The floor is yours.

[53:50] I just want to reiterate and tell everybody that I'm a collector originally. We want to make American Pimball favorable to everybody.

[53:58] I've said some things in the beginning. And one thing I want to do is I want to apologize to some other people in the industry that, you know, when you step into the role, you step on some toast.

[54:09] And I do apologize to anybody that I stepped on in their toes in that when I first got on, you know, it's kind of like I should have hit away and just quietly did things.

[54:18] But you know, you have these bypass and you're talking. That's like, you know, you're trying to make your point. And now I'm kind of comfortable in that position.

[54:27] Many people know me. They think, you know, I've known a lot of people in the industry and I know a lot of people. And it's just like, listen guys, we're here.

[54:35] We're now going to start working on these games where we we've turned the ship from American Pimball. People are loving it. We want to support it 100% of the customers. And remember, we're all collectors too.

[54:47] And there's a couple of questions I want to hit you with Chris. How many pins do you have? What was your first?

[54:54] I mean, if you may have shared this with other people, it's no, it's it's a good question. So obviously I haven't owned too many. So I've owned a Lord of the Rings, a tales of the Arabian nights, a Batman 66 super limited edition, which I sold a year or two too early, because I would have made like 30 grand on it this year.

[55:15] And I had a magic girl that was made by American Pimball. Yeah. Yeah, that was a contract game. That was a contract. No, and that whole thing. I mean, it was Scott Goldberg the whole like that note. I knew the game was not going to work when he sent out that press release saying we built the game to jump pop the Duke's specifications. I'm like, oh, right there. It's not going to work. But I live in New York City. So your point of location versus collecting. And I have room for one game. I enjoy going out though. And I can play almost every game at really good play.

[55:45] I'm like, I have a lot of places like Jack bar and sunshine. And so I've never felt like I need to bring everything into the house. That's my excuse people for having a one bedroom and not enough room. And my wife hearing me right now being like, do not say you're buying at these prices. So yeah, that's how many games I've owned.

[56:02] And you know what I understand that it's limitations. You know, I have a house with a basement because I live in Buffalo. I'm not living in New York City where rent is extremely high was the two bedroom apartment and you have a kid, right? Yep. So I'm sure childcare is not cheap in New York City. Nope. That can really kill into your pinball budget destroy it.

[56:22] Absolutely. So I understand that. Did you ever get to go over to modern pinball? Yes. Play over there many times. What was that? Were you always in the New York City area? Yeah, for 20 years. And I've went over to modern a lot. And you know, modern was like a good place to just play the machines. I think we're modern filled out a little bit in New York City is to have a successful location.

[56:49] You need to sell booze and you need to have something else other than just pins because it was like a showroom. They were sort of getting around. I think there's like a law where you have to pay taxes if you're actually operating the machines versus selling them as a showroom. But it's closed. It's sad. I mean, moderns now close down and we lost Steve. He was a pillar of the of the community. A good friend will miss him always. He was just a great guy. And before that, he had to Broadway arcade. You know, I didn't know if you had any. I don't know.

[57:19] He's back to that part and you're up in the on course. It sounds like we grew up Nathan's on central Avenue. I would just get in. My parents would let me take a taxi to go to the arcade. Wow. And I know it was like when parents were like nervous. Yeah, they were cool. But they're also like, all right. If you're going to go anywhere and stay at a trouble, just like go to the arcade. You know, it was it was a safe place because we would just sit there all day long with with 20 bucks and quarters and just played games. And it was it was awesome. I'm a huge gamer. And I still play. I'm a huge gamer. I'm just a huge gamer. I'm a huge gamer. You know, I'm a huge gamer. I'm a huge gamer. I'm a huge gamer. I'm a huge gamer. I'm a huge gamer. I'm a huge gamer. I'm a huge gamer. I'm a huge gamer. I'm a huge gamer. I

[57:49] play Xbox and PlayStation and pinball. So I have a variety of things I'm into. And the reason I just like pinball the most though, not only for the games being so unique, but this community is just like it's so charged and heated and divided, which kind of makes it interesting. I've never seen a community where everyone loves something and hates it at the same time. And just like debates it endlessly. And that makes for a good community to have a podcast where you have to do something new every week. Oh, yeah.

[58:19] It lends itself perfectly for a podcast because you never have information that you're not running into it. Yeah. And people always react like it's it's a community that you say something and they people just react.

[58:29] And did you listen? What's the first in ball podcasts that you listened to? Oh, Nate, Nate shivers. Yeah. Coast case. Yeah. He's a great guy. Nate. I hope Nate out a little bit for coming to Expo. Nate was an amazing guy. I mean, he's in the Netherlands now. He was selling guitars back in the day. And he's just.

[58:49] You know, this great guy. I remember Nate. Do you remember it was so Nate was the only one. It was any other podcast that you listen to it. You're listening to the guys silver ball podcast or even clay heroes. This old pinball.

[59:00] I didn't listen to this old pinball. I would listen to Nate. I will listen to there's like our cadroom junkies. I think was one I listened to.

[59:08] Preston. Preston and I can't think it was named. I was actually on that show. We ran out. I was I had an episode where I was on that show. It was the number one download for all those who had insomnia.

[59:21] They would download it. Listen to me and fall asleep within 30 minutes. That's what Nate was for me because I used to grow up listening to sports radio to go to bed when I was a kid and Nate has such a nice soothing voice.

[59:33] And it was fun because you discovered a show like Nate's and you might be new to pinball and then you realize, wow, he's got like a lot of shows and I would just start from the beginning and just listen and it's a great way to catch up on the hobby.

[59:44] And I loved it. And then obviously Todd Tucky. I love his content and then John's arcade. Like that was like when you when you get into it, you just realize like there's so many passionate content creators and it's such a great way to sort of get up to speed and and nerd out with all these other nerds.

[01:00:03] Right. No, you're absolutely right. And trust me, there's a lot of the guys that I still talk to where I'm those podcasts. One of my good friends was the silver ball podcast was Rob Craig.

[01:00:14] And he had a good friend Steve who we lost the cancer a few years ago. Very sad, but Rob was a great guy. And you know what?

[01:00:22] I used to work for a large financial company. And I used to sit and I would download podcasts and listen to them doing audits on Capitol one or

[01:00:31] Bank of America and I'd be sitting in my office laughing and people would be like, she's doing an audit. How can you be laughing? I'm like, well, I'm listening to this guy talk about pinball and how he went out and you know, whatever, you know, it's

[01:00:43] Yeah, yeah, I appreciate you coming on this show because this is the hardest one to join for some reason. And you see how it goes. It's just two guys talking pinball. I never understand the

[01:00:53] hesitation to sit down with canada. And I've tried to get other people on you know, but all I can do is invite them.

[01:00:58] Absolutely. And you know what? You just keep you just keep inviting just throw it out there. It's open. You can have a discussion. We can talk about stuff. We're all adults.

[01:01:07] Absolutely. Listen, we throw jabs at each other. At the end of the day, we would sit back and have a beer at X-Fo or we talk about it. We're in we're doing something we love. It's a passion. It's a hobby.

[01:01:20] That kind of thing and just remember that. I mean, there's some people that take this stuff a little too seriously. And it's like, listen, guys, you know,

[01:01:27] this is at the end of the day. It's a box. Who buttons? You know, a man world under glass. It's designed for you to escape. Okay. Right. The idea is I'm supposed to let you escape. There's a famous

[01:01:40] quotation from a guy by name, her Jones who wrote about about pinball. Okay. And it's all about him. You know, just we design these games so that you can

[01:01:51] escape into a fantasy and just forget about the craziness of the world. Have a beer, enjoy yourself and be there. Absolutely.

[01:02:00] And let me put it to this. I want to personally invite you. You want to come to American pinball. Check out the place when you're in Chicago. Let's set that up. Anytime you're in Buffalo. And I have a place here called

[01:02:14] Pocket tear billiard, which has 80 pinball machines. And we continuously go through them, clean them, get them up and running. It has a beer. If we have seven or eight beers on tap. Let me know if you're in the

[01:02:26] Washington, Yorker. I hope you bet on the bills last week. Yeah. No, you're killing me because I was just saying like your football team is amazing. And they

[01:02:32] they keep covering and then some. I mean, it was 17 and a half points and they blew by that spread. And I bet on Brady last night. And again, he doesn't cover again.

[01:02:40] Well, Dave, I will absolutely take you up on the AP tour. I'm going to be out in Chicago for expo. I might be out at a day or two early. I might be visiting a friend at work there. So I will
