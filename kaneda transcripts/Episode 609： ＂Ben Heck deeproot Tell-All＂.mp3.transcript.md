[00:10] He's falling

[00:12] Baby on the stars

[00:14] He tried that night

[00:16] Whatever you do

[00:18] Don't put the blame on you

[00:20] Baby on the rain

[00:22] Yeah

[00:24] Yeah

[00:26] I said I said I said I said

[00:28] I said I said I said

[00:30] I'm

[00:32] Welcome everybody happy Monday

[00:34] Morning, I'm back in New York City

[00:36] And this is going to be a really fun

[00:38] Edition of Canadas Pimball

[00:40] Podcasts i get to talk to Ben Heck

[00:42] About how he feels

[00:44] Finally being able to talk freely

[00:46] About deep root pimball

[00:48] About deep root pimball

[00:50] Attempting to take over spooky pimball

[00:52] Way back in the day these stories are really in good

[00:53] interesting and they've not been able to be shared until now.

[00:58] Because as you will learn over the next few weeks, a lot of people were very afraid of

[01:04] Robert Mueller, his litigious nature, and they are no longer really afraid of the big

[01:10] bad bully.

[01:11] So you're going to hear all from Ben about what it was like when Robert Mueller tried

[01:15] to become the leading partner at spooky pimble.

[01:18] But let's cover off on a few news items first.

[01:20] So first and foremost, today is August 23rd.

[01:24] P3 Multi-Morphic has been teasing that they are going to reveal their license game today.

[01:30] Now it is Monday morning.

[01:31] I wish Jerry would have given me a little bit of a scoop so I could talk about it or

[01:35] tee it up or hype it, but nothing.

[01:37] So I will find out when the rest of you find out what the license theme game is that P3

[01:42] Multi-Morphic has up its sleeve.

[01:44] I hope it's something cool.

[01:46] This platform has been in desperate need of a license theme.

[01:49] So I look forward to seeing what it is and we'll find out today.

[01:53] The other thing that happened over the weekend was Chicago Gaming Company.

[01:57] Finally, after two years of the worst kept secret in pimble, revealed to the world that

[02:02] the next game is going to be Cactus Canyon Remake.

[02:06] It's like a slow golf clap how they did it.

[02:08] Now they were at Southern Fried Gaming Expo and they were doing a PowerPoint presentation

[02:13] about CGC and they just put up a slide that said Cactus Canyon and then they had another

[02:19] slide that talked about some of the features of the game and this looked like a PowerPoint

[02:23] presentation where there was a total of 30 seconds spent on it.

[02:28] As a marketer, is it cringe worthy when I see these companies take moments like these

[02:33] and put absolutely zero effort into it?

[02:36] Yes, I could have made them such a nicer, more polished presentation and they also could

[02:41] have done something a little bit more fun with a little bit more pizzazz to get people

[02:46] excited about this being the next theme but they don't need to do it.

[02:50] I'm also not an idiot like I know that this game will sell just fine with absolutely

[02:55] zero marketing because there's a built-in audience for this stuff.

[03:00] They know what they're doing.

[03:01] They're making games that collectors want and they're remaking them better than the originals

[03:07] and when they show people how there's new code in this game and how there's fancier

[03:11] scolps and toppers and this game is going to look loaded.

[03:15] I don't think they're going to have a problem selling Cactus Canyon remake but I do urge

[03:20] people to remember one thing about Cactus Canyon.

[03:24] People need to remember that Cactus Canyon as a game is nowhere near as good of a pinball

[03:30] shooter as medieval madness attack from Mars or monster bash.

[03:35] This was an interesting remake for CGC because Cactus Canyon arguably not the best game

[03:41] and not just because of the software.

[03:43] I think everyone thinks like if Cactus Canyon just has better software it's all of a sudden

[03:48] an incredible game and maybe it will be but I was reading a someone's description on

[03:53] Pinside about how the shots in this game are the real issue with it.

[03:57] Now I have not spent a ton of time on Cactus Canyon but I do feel like when I played it

[04:02] I didn't have a huge issue with the way it shot.

[04:04] Just be aware that this isn't like them remaking one of the greatest games of all time.

[04:09] This is them remaking a game that just had high collector value and there's a big difference

[04:14] there.

[04:15] So we'll see the final package soon.

[04:18] They are going to reveal this game in the next 4-6 weeks.

[04:21] They are going to have it at pinball expo and distributors are already taking orders on

[04:26] it.

[04:27] I got an email from Joe Newhart at pinball star you can buy your Cactus Canyon and he's

[04:31] using old photography the old flyer to sell you the new game.

[04:36] Again it doesn't matter we all know what it's going to be it's going to be a nicer version

[04:40] of that so if you want to Cactus Canyon remake hit up Joe Newhart at pinball star and get

[04:45] on his list because I do think they're going to sell most of these LEDs if they make

[04:48] a thousand of them.

[04:49] But who knows there's so many exciting new games coming I wouldn't rush in and get anything

[04:53] right now I would wait to see what happens in the pinball world.

[04:56] Before I air this with Ben Heck I want to say that this whole deep root debacle the silver

[05:01] lining in all of it is it is going to bring a lot of people together I know there's

[05:07] some arguing on the pin side thread but ultimately as a community sometimes when you see these

[05:13] calamities these ginormous failures I think this is going to unite a lot of the pinball

[05:18] personalities because we all can agree on this we all can agree on something for once

[05:24] and in the pinball world it is kind of interesting how much division there really is when you

[05:28] think about it it's all these grown men for the most part who have enough money to put

[05:33] these expensive toys in their homes right and guess what when you go to the forum about

[05:38] that it's arguing and division and screaming and yelling and treating each other with absolutely

[05:44] no respect and it's so weird to me when I tell people I'm in the pinball and on the number

[05:49] one pinball form there's a bunch of bickering that's non stop he's like wait I don't get

[05:54] it doesn't everybody like pinball and yes we do but that's where it ends so I do

[05:58] think this is going to bring people together because it's finally something we can all agree

[06:02] on I mean even Christopher Franchise hanging out with canada again I feel like we've

[06:05] buried some of those issues in the past and weren't we're hanging out he's been on the

[06:08] Facebook live so Chris I'm glad you're hanging out on the show again and I can't wait

[06:12] to see your art on future titles and I think we're going to see some of Franchise work on

[06:15] cactus canyon remate I did see the most ridiculous thing last night because Barrio chimed in when

[06:20] someone asked him is deep root done this is what Barrio is saying and this just goes to show

[06:26] you how delusional how out of touch and how cultists and how these people have drank the

[06:33] cool aid Steve Boud in Barrio these people have known for a very long time they have been

[06:40] getting emails from Robert and the senior staff over at deep root they've been furloughed

[06:46] or they've mispaired many times throughout this journey and they had to have known things

[06:51] were not going well when you've blown by your deadlines by years when asked after the

[06:57] SEC story was shown to Barrio I'm not even making this up when Barrio is asked if deep

[07:03] root is over after the story broke this weekend Barrio is saying that he saw it this is going

[07:11] to be challenged and it's not over and this is the best part he said that someone released

[07:17] this as a publicity stunt let me repeat that that Barrio your famed pinball designer is

[07:24] calling this a publicity stunt Barry deep root team all of you delusional cultist members

[07:32] a publicity stunt and this is what I do for a living a publicity stunt is something that

[07:36] someone does or a company does or a brand does they do something out in the world to generate

[07:42] excitement attention and positive conversation about their brand how is this a publicity stunt

[07:49] the SEC does not do this for its own publicity this is the SEC saying that deep root has committed

[07:58] fraud okay Barry and for you to say that this isn't the end that this is someone trying to

[08:04] destroy us he said that he's like this is someone trying to destroy us and Barry I need you to

[08:09] wake up it's over the person who destroyed you is your own leader you are not going to get your

[08:17] food truck game out in the world this just goes to show that the delusion the gullible nature of a

[08:23] lot of these pinball people it goes way past just the buyers of pinball machine Barrio Barrio

[08:30] like how does Barrio read this SEC story and call it a publicity stunt this makes no sense it's

[08:38] over Barry it's over Brian the sooner you accept that it's over Barry the sooner you can move on

[08:46] with things and I don't think anyone else is holding on to any delusion anymore there's one

[08:51] fool on pinside saying that someone might pick up these IPs and make these games in the future

[08:57] that's not happening no one's picking this stuff up Bill Brand has already said he's not going

[09:02] to let anyone do that nobody wants the pin bar why would anyone want to put a pin bar on a pinball

[09:08] machine when hundreds of thousands of games have been sold and enjoyed without one this is not

[09:14] moving pinball forward if you want to buy something that's moving pinball in a different direction

[09:18] using different technology go support Jerry and p3 and multi more like and I mean that and I'm

[09:24] hard on Jerry and I cracked the whip on Jerry's decisions and I think Jerry doesn't listen to

[09:29] consumer feedback as much as he should and I think he needs themes that make this platform saying

[09:34] but Jerry has never ripped off anybody Jerry has tried to innovate pinball and only took money when

[09:40] he could figure out how to manufacture the product so Jerry as much fun as I make of p3 multi morphing

[09:46] and some of the decisions you've made you're still a hardworking person that actually made

[09:51] innovations that moved pinball forward and the p rock system is one of them so don't support

[09:56] deep route support p3 multi morphing today if you find a theme that you like when he reveals it

[10:01] today see I'm more about supporting the people that deserve it and we've spent way too much time

[10:07] in energy talking about supporting and shilling some of these charlatans in the pinball world I even

[10:14] got a message from Jeff Tielis that just said Chris you were right and Jeff I appreciate that I

[10:19] mean I don't even care about being right I mean it was almost like impossible to think they were

[10:23] going to pull this off there was no indications that they had anything figured out so nobody wanted

[10:28] to be right that deep route was a disaster but it always was a disaster it was a disaster from day

[10:33] one the moment they opened their mouth the moment they all went up on stage the moment Steve Bouton

[10:37] said just wait the other part is this we need to stop thinking because people are nice people

[10:42] that they will steer you in a good direction I don't know Steve Bouton and people say he's a

[10:46] nice guy but every time I hear people say Steve Bouton is an amazing asset to the pinball world

[10:52] and someone should scoop up his talents I can't help but think Steve Bouton has never worked on

[10:58] a single pinball machine that anyone's ever played and yet Stern is selling tens of thousands of

[11:03] games everyone is selling thousands of games do we need Steve Bouton to do rule sets for pinball

[11:08] machines is that what he's good at I don't even know we'll never know this desire to prop up Steve

[11:15] Bouton as his hugely valuable asset in the world of coding pinball machines everyone stop we need to

[11:21] stop doing this we need to come back to reality Steve is a nice person he's an amazing tournament

[11:26] player but as far as I'm concerned that's the only thing he should be getting credit for it's like

[11:31] give canator credit for being a great pinball podcaster but don't give me credit for being like an

[11:35] art director or a coder or a designer because I'm not and that's the thing we just start to think

[11:41] that anyone who gets involved in a pinball project as being great before they've shown us their

[11:45] great at it and you're not great at coding or art or design or layout into you actually do

[11:51] something and you actually put it out in the world and the final point I'll make is this I know

[11:57] there are people saying well they probably had no idea what was going on on the financial side

[12:03] of the company and even if that's true even if that's true all of those people Steve Bouton all of

[12:10] those people who got up there with deep root all of those people they heard the promises that

[12:16] Robert was making and they were in pinball long enough to know that those promises were never

[12:22] going to come true there will be some accountability that those people will have to face moving forward

[12:28] you don't just get a get out of jail free card like oh you didn't know how did you not know how

[12:33] did you walk into deep root every day a single story building and not know what was going on how

[12:39] did you not open up the manufacturing door and see nothing going on for years how did you not

[12:45] walk into Robert's office when he delayed your payroll and say hey is anything happening is

[12:50] anything happening because I'm not seeing any manufacturing I'm not seeing any assembly line being

[12:55] built and how are we going to make these games Steve Bouton is an adult Barrio is an adult John

[13:01] Norris is an adult you know Dennis Nornman and David Thiel were the first to to get the hell out of

[13:06] Dodge they quickly saw that this wasn't going to happen they were the canary in the coal mines again

[13:10] but I don't buy this that nobody else knew nobody else knew they knew they knew and the only saving

[13:17] grace for all of them is that most of us didn't lose a penny on this thing you know the pinball

[13:23] community was saved this time around all of the money that went into this came from other investors

[13:29] but unfortunately for all of those other people they've lost a lot of money and it was the pinball

[13:34] project it seems where most of the money was funneled to the pinball and the deep rude studios

[13:39] if you're going to hit your career to accompany you better ask questions you better know what's

[13:44] going on again this was not like an enron this was not like Bernie made off this was a small little

[13:51] venture they knew what was going on and they still went on those podcasts back in December and

[13:57] convinced all of us that this game was great and we were going to play it soon so I'm sorry not

[14:02] everybody just gets a pass when this falls apart all right everybody enjoy Ben hek you're going

[14:07] to love it I'll talk to you guys soon all right ladies and gentlemen Ben hek won deep root zero

[14:14] Ben welcome back to the show and this has been one we've been wanting to do for a while because

[14:19] do you finally feel comfortable talking about deep root I mean I don't have as many stories as

[14:25] the employees but I mean I can I can talk about the origins and all the red flags we saw many years

[14:30] ago we want to hear that story and that's the main reason I want to talk to you today is because we

[14:35] know about your early days with John and Ben hek's zombie adventure land and you saw there were

[14:40] problems and you got out of there but I want to know about one of the stories that has been

[14:46] circling around the industry which is this notion that Robert at one point in time walked into

[14:52] spooky pinball and Ben just tell the story like tell us what happened okay this is over six years

[14:58] ago so I'll try to remember it as much as I can and sadly I threw away I think I have oh yeah I

[15:04] have the notebook right here he gave us a notebook like a deep root notebook I've hold it in my hand

[15:10] and a pen so I've got the number but then he also gave us his perspective like his plan and it had

[15:16] all the numbers in it his sales expectations so I want to say this was March of 2015 that was when

[15:23] all spooky had was America's most haunted I think they had just signed Rob Zombie they hadn't

[15:28] announced it yet it was before like AMH really took off which was at TPS 2015 so spooky was still

[15:37] a little nubulous as far as its viability right obviously Charlie was there I won't say who

[15:42] else was there just to be discreet but there are other people there as well well who did he come with

[15:46] was it just Robert it was just Robert the first time yes okay so he walks in to spooky and tell us

[15:53] like what what's the conversation like at that early stage well I mean it's like he set up a meeting

[15:58] right so he just walked in uninvited so I don't think Charlie was like hey there's some guy who's

[16:03] talking about maybe investing or something and you know he wants to like you know hire you full

[16:08] time meaning me and blah blah blah and I'm like oh okay and so I was still doing my corporate show

[16:15] back then I think that's important to remember like I was doing that the whole time I worked on AMH

[16:20] so anyway so then we have this meeting so we go down there this is back when spooky was in like I

[16:24] think two rooms in a business incubator so 1.5 square feet 1.5 k square feet tops small small you know

[16:34] and so then we get the conference room that's in the business incubator to have this meeting

[16:38] and Robert's like blah blah blah blah and he's just fricking up here we go he's fricking obsessed with

[16:45] J-pop it's just like ridiculous it's like oh J-pop J-pop J-pop these games are beautiful so remember

[16:52] this was after empty cabinet gate it was also after that remember that Adobe had that video where

[16:57] they actually if we finally got to see what the games look like right that was like early 2015

[17:02] but also before Pintasia so I don't know if Robert was your fork off of that Adobe video or

[17:07] something but his basic idea was he wanted to buy spooky pinball for zero dollars basically we

[17:15] would just become his employees sweat equity that old bullshit and then he was going to move spooky

[17:20] into a 40,000 square foot facility immediately even though there were no games to build and then

[17:25] the idea was that we would fix and build the zidware games and what was his rationale for that he's

[17:32] obsessed with john was he even a john customer I don't know I don't think so because Robert's one

[17:38] of those guys who well formerly rich well soon to be what he's just one of those guys who's like

[17:45] hey distributor put 10 stirns in my basement and then becomes a pinball fan yeah so this was like years

[17:52] after you know zidware but I'm sure just like john's like oh belly Williams the magic the magic

[17:58] and see that's the thing I still think john is a huge part of this the whole company was basically

[18:02] built around him you know even if even if he was sidelined and not given much to do it's you know he

[18:07] was like the key okay so let's talk about he walks in he says hey we should make these zidware

[18:13] games they're beautiful and they were beautiful and at that point nobody knew how incomplete and how

[18:19] horrible they really were so what was the reaction from Charlie and you as he sells you on this let's

[18:26] steer spooky pinball to sort of resurrecting these jpop titles he was offering real money even

[18:32] though he was basically going to take the company from charlie he was offering real money real

[18:37] salary so it was tempting like how much can you say uh yeah I think you offered me about a hundred

[18:42] twenty thousand dollars a year okay for pinball which is pretty good okay so he was offering real

[18:48] money well that's the thing like okay so he offers a salary to you does he offer a salary to Charlie

[18:53] or is Charlie still managing the company we would basically become his employees that was was the

[18:58] plan well you're still leverage on his part why it just is it just the money that was it because

[19:03] we all said no we actually considered it you know like and at that point I was kind of tired of

[19:07] doing my show because I did I did my show for eight years and like the last couple years I only

[19:12] did it because I knew when I quit my co-workers would have to find new jobs as well I would have

[19:17] considered it but the thing was John was a constant no matter what he was going to hire John

[19:24] and it was like shark tank we're all like well for that we're out because the thing is I would

[19:29] have had to work under John I would have been John's bitch having to fix his game for him and if you

[19:35] know John it's like ew I'm the master teacher I'm the teacher Valley Williams days teacher

[19:42] pinball college and fuck that and here's the interesting thing I think context is very important

[19:48] for listener of the show in 2015 uh spooky pinball is not the spooky they are today in which they

[19:54] sell 1750 games in one day at that point America's most haunted was struggling to sell eventually

[20:01] it sold 150 so that money six years ago in pinball was an enticing offer which is why they

[20:08] considered it because I think people who only came into the hobby recently been and we're seeing

[20:12] that a lot and people who even got taken by deeproot they don't know the context and the history

[20:18] of how zidware was such a joke and they just saw some beautiful lights when they saw raza uh at

[20:23] san antonio like a couple years ago so you guys thought it over j pop was a sort of a constant

[20:29] and was going to be part of the deal what made you guys say no that was it none of us wanted to

[20:34] work with john because we all knew he was a worthless sack of skin did you go to robert and say hey

[20:39] if you cut john loose we're happy to get in bed with you yep no matter what john was a constant

[20:46] and then look what happened he waited for america in pinball well technically joe ball sort of

[20:51] fire him and then he scooped him right back up you could not underestimate how obsessed robert was

[20:56] with john it was it was like an infatuation it was mind boggling you just watch the videos with

[21:02] robert all he talks about is like your beautiful pin the beautiful pin beautiful beautiful beautiful

[21:06] robert in a way was the perfect mark for john he was a rich dude or felt had access to a bunch of

[21:11] other people's money and all he cared about was art that's perfect mark for john isn't it crazy

[21:16] too when you look at the raza reveal video that robert mule are actually art directed on top of

[21:22] j pop did you notice that like those aren't the colors john wanted in the extra edition that's robert's

[21:27] design i mean it's just such a thematically ridiculous game so ben that was meeting one was

[21:35] there ever a meeting with you and j pop and charlie and robert john was never involved i did

[21:41] meet with robert again at tp f 2015 that's when he stole the idea for bible adventures from me

[21:47] a valueless thing to steal but go on yeah so i'm sitting there talking to him this was when we

[21:52] were still maybe thinking about it right and uh he's like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

[21:56] blah blah blah blah and he's trying to hire some other person i won't say who they are but that

[22:01] person was like robert has crazy eyes stay away and wow that person was right you know who you are

[22:06] person who said that so we're sitting there and he's saying you know i'm talking about stuff you

[22:11] know because again we're kind of thinking about anyway then he's asking me about game ideas and i'm

[22:15] like oh i've always wanted to do an old testament bible adventure game and then his his crazy eyes

[22:20] opened wide as saucers and he's like yes fire in brimstone and i'm like what and he's like i love

[22:27] it we're gonna make fire in brimstone and i'm like are you freaking kidding me like that is the

[22:31] worst possible thing to possibly call this uh terrible terrible did robert ever want to learn

[22:37] about manufacturing from anyone like you i don't think that ever came up all he talked about was the

[22:42] games like the design and he clearly doesn't give a shit about manufacturing why and as you say like

[22:48] do you think that is fully like john's influence on him i think it's more that as bill said

[22:54] there two peas in a pod i think robert is more like he has like crippling narcissism right he's got

[23:00] he's got some traits that are so severe that it affects his ability to think clearly and yeah he

[23:05] just he only cares about art like look at deep root studios i wouldn't be surprised if half the money

[23:10] they blew was at deep root studios mean you see that picture of him and all those employees and

[23:15] looks like high school prom photos with the black backgrounds there's 48 people at deep root

[23:21] studios absolutely the majority of the money i think went to the animations i heard this is just

[23:27] what i heard i heard upwards of eight million were spent at the studio over the years eight million

[23:34] and nothing went into anything isn't that crazy let's be really cheap as cheap as possible eighty

[23:40] thousand dollars times what forty people that's three point two million dollars of burn a year before

[23:47] you get to everything else like social security insurance uh unemployment yeah i bet i bet that was

[23:53] over half the money went because remember he wanted to be like i just look at the fricking photo of him

[23:57] he's like he's like oh look i'm john laceter you know there's definitely a lot of self indulgence

[24:02] where he's like oh i want to play john laceter i want to play i want to play steve jobs but you

[24:06] ended up playing Elizabeth Holmes yeah but i think in his mind it was going to work though but we'll

[24:11] get to that later okay so we're in 2015 you and charlie make the wise decision and sidestepped his

[24:17] proposal american pinball have one more story from that period yeah go on so i'm at work one day at

[24:23] lunch and robert's like ooh Ben can we do a a conference call there's a company i think they're

[24:29] called like pixel farm in Minneapolis and that's when he was looking for like animations and whatnot

[24:35] and i'm like okay yeah so i get on this conference call with robert and i don't know one of the people

[24:40] at this pixel farm studio and uh it's like okay what do you guys need it's like well we're looking for

[24:45] pinball machine animations and i'm like yeah they need to run at this frame rate this resolution

[24:49] and they're on this kind of display and blah blah blah and then robert's like you should see these

[24:54] games they're so beautiful they deserve disney quality animations and kind of like when john said

[25:03] that i was gonna go around the country putting a game together with him i'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

[25:07] what and i was like how about archer animations but then low and behold john hires all those people

[25:13] in salt lake city utah right guess what was also in salt lake city utah i have a land studios you

[25:20] know what skylanders is the thing with little dragons and the NFC tags disney had their own ripoff

[25:25] of that called disney infinity it was a video game and there was this disc you see him all the time

[25:30] now like the readers and goodwill so it's like the new goodwill crap along with vr glasses you

[25:35] by like a captain jack sparrow figurine he said it on the disc and then he appears in the game right

[25:40] so disney cancelled that and then they shut down the studio which is avalanche studios in salt lake

[25:45] city utah and that's where john are rest were robert hired a bunch of his staff from disney quality

[25:50] animations so these guys were working on something that disney shut down they get acquired and but

[25:55] why is any of this really needed to make good pinball right because because robert wanted disney quality

[26:00] animations news flash there's tons of game studios in texas but disney quality animations okay so you

[26:07] you have another interesting moment with robert and then you walk away yes that was probably

[26:12] about the last thing i ever enter well actually no there was another time when he tried to hire me

[26:16] again but i i said no well what happened there i said

[26:23] did he up the ante did he offer you more see that was in an email so it might still be under

[26:28] like protection i never signed any n d a's before that uh but same deal i refuse to work with j pop

[26:34] like what was he looking for you to do make make john's illusions into realities i don't know the

[26:39] and i never really got that far i mean it's kind of like me at helping with zidware people think

[26:45] i was like some sort of inside like no i went to john shop like maybe four times and we like

[26:50] basically noodle yeah i'm not i'm actually not sure what robert wanted because i mean spooky at that time

[26:56] they're just putting games together one by one i mean robert probably could have spooled

[26:59] of his own stuff just as easily see it i'm saying i'm not exactly sure not to be the spirit you

[27:04] just spooky but at that time i'm not sure the value is although ironically if robert would have put

[27:09] in a just a small reasonable investment he would have made ten times his money back now so when

[27:13] you finally turned him down was there ever any parting words like you're gonna be sorry or was

[27:18] just like okay like i understand and then he just moved on now he just moved on although i did tell

[27:23] him i was pissed because he stole my bible adventures game from me here's when i'm trying to figure

[27:27] out this timing because it's weird that robert has been acting almost like jpop's agent through all

[27:32] of this and then american pinball scoops up jpop how did robert not get involved with ap i'm sure he

[27:40] was involved well not what about after the fact because of magic girl it's crazy to because magic

[27:45] will finally gets built by american pinball and turns out to be a broken box of lights you you

[27:49] would have thought by then even robert would have been like i can't avoid the obvious here which

[27:54] is this guy does not know how to make games at all john john should have been ended with penteja

[28:00] even then that was five years the people who bill had go help him they ran around for two weeks

[28:07] like chickens with their head chopped off trying to make that game and john just sit there sat

[28:10] there on a stool the thumb of his ass didn't even help and then it's like oh this is this is

[28:15] it after five years that should have been the end in the real world i mean you're you're you know

[28:20] you're in marketing if it was like a movie you know maybe guns and roses can you know work on an

[28:25] album for 13 years but in the real world you would be that would be it you'd be done or you'd

[28:29] have it taken from you uh so it should it should have ended there but then john was able to trick ap

[28:34] into starting a company okay so ap they part ways with jpop we get deep route right and remember

[28:41] the way i'd introduce it was like john somewhere new and it's deep route and you must have been like

[28:47] i've seen these guys before what was it like when you saw that they officially came out as their

[28:51] own pinball company what what what went through your head what about ap i mean um and maybe i

[28:58] shouldn't repeat the story because i like joe and i'm just hanging out with joe no let's let

[29:02] come on real simple john tricked ap and started a company if you look at the logo it's the same

[29:07] goddam logo is deep route it's all john it's john john john even the name american pinball you've got

[29:13] you've got an immigrant and then two other immigrants and the most pro-american people are immigrants

[29:18] american pinball john some canada you know so it just that even that whole thing just reaked of john

[29:23] right so he's got oh i've got this houdini game if you build magic girl i'll give you this game

[29:32] right uh pig and a poke a poke being a bag oh look at this bag there's something inside it's

[29:39] a succulent pig give me two pants and then he gives you the bag and it's actually a stray cat that's

[29:45] also a cat out of the bag comes from basically yes john tricked them and then it's expo 2016 yes

[29:53] and those guys they have john's magic girl the mad andru's art at expo and they've got to set up

[30:00] and it looks amazing it looks really cool but then you walk up and you look at it it was his

[30:05] houdini because i was there what did i say you said magic girl john's houdini game yes yes go on it

[30:11] looks amazing but then you look at it and there aren't any toys there's just like a acrylic

[30:15] representations of like a water chamber there's shots to nowhere there's shots that don't work there's

[30:20] shots that aren't fed by anything he's really good at making fake dioramas of games and if you don't

[30:26] know anything about engineering you look at it and you think it's a pinball you know it's a kind of

[30:30] pinball machine you'd see a set direction in a movie you know maybe that's what he should do for

[30:34] let me know he's too old they wouldn't hire him uh yeah so then joe's there joe balsar and he's

[30:40] and i'm like hey i'm like hey joe what's going on he's like yeah i'm just looking at this game

[30:46] john's game here and i'm like yeah this is something isn't it then what is it they rebuild the entire

[30:53] game and like what five months or something insane like that which is still one of the most

[30:57] insane impressive things in pinball history i think yeah they tried they tried to work with john

[31:02] john is unmanageable and they basically said get the f out which is unfortunate because i think john

[31:08] actually ap could use a good art director which is probably the only thing john is good at but that's

[31:13] when he was kicked to the curb now that was probably early 2017 late 2016 he didn't basically once

[31:18] everyone realized the game was fake john was gone uh unfortunately ap had already committed to the

[31:24] magic girls because they did not use google apparently he should have died with pentasia he should

[31:30] have died with the broken magic girls he should have died with the hudini that didn't work what's

[31:35] crazy been is how are those not all red flags for robber right you're saying that he was so enamored

[31:40] had stars in his eyes because of the beauty of john's games which if you were to look at those games

[31:46] that was all zombie eddie and mad andrews who made all of that stuff beautiful john's

[31:52] mechs were crap and there wasn't like incredible designs i mean you could say i mean again you could

[31:57] say john's a good art director for finding good people because remember our directors don't do

[32:02] art he's a good art director for finding good people and putting together good looking packages but

[32:06] that's all he can do so then you see deep root pimple you see it launched what's going on inside your

[32:12] head when you see robberton john are going to do it on their own well my eyes roll back at my head

[32:17] but not surprised because as i mentioned i knew that robber was just completely obsessed with john's

[32:23] game just ridiculously see all i oh yeah robberton had a quote regarding john even back in 2015

[32:30] he's a rock star man i can sell him to investors i guess i don't want to say defraud about this guy

[32:37] who like wasted a million and a half dollars of people's money yeah that's a rock star but john's

[32:43] games never sold well even back in the nineties it's crazy when you look there did okay i think

[32:49] it okay that i mean these games would sell like like two to three thousand units when lawler's

[32:54] games would sell fifteen to twenty thousand years i think world cup soccer was about six or seven

[32:59] theater magic was five then toton was maybe three and then circus full tear they had to basically

[33:06] give away but actually that's an interesting point um the prospectus and i think this goes to

[33:11] the investment part of it again i wish i would have kept it but this is again this was march of

[33:15] two thousand fifteen and it contained robberts pulled from his ass estimates of how many units

[33:21] of john games they'd be able to sell what were they okay i'm just having i'm having to guess but

[33:27] i think magic girl was like five thousand units i'm gonna have to insert the marty and ryan

[33:33] laugh track right there and and what about raza two to three thousand five thousand did you guys

[33:40] no exactly we're like well i also said this to charlie i was like we both knew that game would not

[33:45] sell five thousand units there is hard data of how many units of a full on j pop game you could

[33:50] sell it's called circus of old terror and i'm like you know what happens charlie is you give it your

[33:55] company to him you're working for him and you don't sell five thousand of this game because there's

[33:59] no way it sells five thousand and guess what it becomes your fault and you're gone and you lose

[34:02] everything but what about manufacturing again like when you talk about that many years there's the

[34:07] giant empty factory tour i didn't tell you that part yet all right tell us that part uh well wait

[34:12] just just one more thing on the unit so yes i assume he probably showed those same goals to his

[34:17] investors or maybe he did it well actually it sounds like he did it yeah because he's is

[34:22] invested thought they were buying life insurance policies or something yeah no they were investing in

[34:28] life insurance policies and and in the fun they were not investing in pinball or animations because

[34:33] they never have invested in those things well that's where the fraud is that's where the fraud takes place

[34:38] but see thing is i think and i think in robert's mind he thought those games would sell that many units and

[34:43] that way he could put all the money back in the cookie jar and no one would be the wiser but oh yeah

[34:47] but giant factory tour so yes i said i had to go on google maps and check it wasn't as big as i

[34:52] thought but um just north of benton ms council is a town called cuba city and uh there was this

[34:58] there used to be a wind turbine blade factory there so fun fact about like turbines once they

[35:05] saturate an area with turbines the plants that build the parts it's not there's a certain point

[35:11] where the cost of transporting what you build exceeds the value of what you build and the saturation

[35:17] is such that they have to ship the blades further further away than new areas and it's so expensive

[35:22] to ship them they just close up shop for listener of the show there's some empty factories go on then

[35:27] this is forty thousand square foot so robert wants to move spooky from one point five k square foot to

[35:33] forty thousand square foot overnight so i think this was like maybe the second time he was there

[35:38] so we meet him in cuba city and he's got like four or five architects with him and we go through

[35:43] this giant building and it's huge and it's like Jesus this is huge they had like overhead

[35:49] crane lifts and it was ridiculous like maybe if you thought you're gonna sell ten thousand

[35:54] zidware games it wasn't that ridiculous but it was ridiculous and then uh part well then when

[36:00] Charlie's like no robert's like well i high i spent 50 grand hiring those consultants and

[36:05] like charles are i didn't i didn't ask you to do that my hopper yeah it's put what was he gonna do was

[36:11] he uh it's like he's just gonna move well i mean he has exactly what he did in uh san antonio he

[36:18] jumps into like the super expensive building but what's the point of having the building if you

[36:22] not manufacture anything right you don't need that much room to come up with a game but robert

[36:27] just wants to play ceo and i'm just saying so his his same mentality wasn't placed in 2015

[36:33] and then he just kept doing it um later on i also think there was a filing like robert did one of his

[36:39] robber was trying to raise funds in 2015 as well and it didn't raise nearly as much so maybe it

[36:44] also took him a couple years in order to actually like start raking in the big bucks uh right yeah

[36:50] for people on pinside why are you still so invested in this i know you are you've had personal

[36:57] experiences with jpop and robert what makes you today in 2021 really lead the charge to see

[37:03] these guys go down well it's fun for one thing it's an interesting hobby i've i've seen 10 years of

[37:10] red flags like i know i've seen some people on pinside they're like well been if zid where it was

[37:14] such a failure why didn't you tell anyone and it's like no one would have listened you know you

[37:20] could have you could have been at the 1999 Oscars well Harvey Weinstein was collecting his trophy for

[37:26] Shakespeare in love and stand up and yell you're a rapist and you would have been dragged out of the

[37:30] ceremony same thing like if i would have said hey john is a super lazy sloth like person i've never

[37:37] seen him do any real work he doesn't seem to be actually creative and most of his shop is used to

[37:41] store junk they were like shut up ginger he made theater magic no one would have cared right for

[37:46] listener of the show who wasn't around back then you have to remember this is 2015 and Ben is

[37:52] completely accurate i remember when people are trying to say jpop was a hack kevin kool-ik

[37:57] andrew highway inside protection racket they ran the people yelling fire out they banned them

[38:04] canada was one of them but they silenced us even when we had information that people like john and

[38:09] andrew highway were up to no good they didn't want to hear it everyone just wants their beautiful

[38:15] pinball machine yes and that actually that goes for the moderators as well um maybe you're not

[38:20] supposed to question them on the site but i'll question them here that they those companies were

[38:25] all protected no one was allowed to question anything i mean now they are but there's a period from

[38:29] like probably like 2011 2015 nope you couldn't say anything about it i sent i'm not going to name

[38:35] i sent one of the senior people at pinside you can guess who it is information exactly

[38:41] outlining what andrew highway was up to and how everyone was going to lose their money and you know

[38:46] what he's like i'm not letting this up on the site now you know why canada has four twippies

[38:52] and rolls around these shows with a little bit of a swagger because i'm trying to help i remember

[38:56] what got you banned was when you complained about the hobbits well dramps well dramps and that was

[39:02] because they wanted to keep the jjp people on the site and they didn't want people pointing out

[39:06] the mistakes or isn't it ironic the quality issues of a jersey jack pinball machine got me banned

[39:13] and here we are still in the same narrative so ben you're you're like i saw a guy today i want to

[39:19] know what you think about when people say this to you they're like how dare you be happy that i lost

[39:24] my money on this venture what do you say to people who are mad that you're cheerleading for people

[39:28] who are losing money um there was a sea of red flags and you threw your money in anyway i'm

[39:34] going to laugh at you oh no i lost a thousand dollars meanwhile some little little lady lost a

[39:39] hundred thousand dollars yeah i'm going to laugh at you when you read the scc filing what went

[39:45] through your head as you as they outlined like in detail how robert has been running all these

[39:51] deeproot companies like what went through your head i was pretty shocked at just how i thought it

[39:56] was just a well-funded future failure of a company but it turns out the wildest conspiracies were

[40:02] the were actually the ones that were true i mean congrats to the people that figured it out

[40:07] early but again even two years ago if you would have said this is a Ponzi scheme i mean people did

[40:13] and they were allowed to but i mean they were right they were right ball long they were more right

[40:18] than i was my feeling is i don't think robert actually set it up as a Ponzi scheme i think in his

[40:25] mind the games were going to sell they were going to sell well enough that he could put the money

[40:30] back and then some and be able to pay the dividend although five percent is a pretty aggressive return

[40:36] the pinball was never set up that way but the fund when you read what the scc wrote that was

[40:43] set up it seems like on day one because they never used the money to actually buy the insurance

[40:49] policies they were using the money to pay back the early investors and the moment you do that right

[40:54] the moment you don't invest in the thing people think they're investing it's a Ponzi scheme

[40:59] see here's the part that's crazy i don't think those people realized how much money went into the

[41:04] pinball and the studio work well i mean if you look at the filings what was a 50 million total i

[41:09] i fired a guess i would say it's probably north of 40 million at least it's definitely more than

[41:14] half remember it wasn't even that long ago people were saying all they didn't even think they're like

[41:19] you really think they spent ten million dollars on deeper pinballs like of course like you look at

[41:23] the ppp why did they get a ppp loan in texas a year after who needs a ppp loan in texas in

[41:31] april 2021 apparently deep route what if they were using that money to pay back investors

[41:38] well that's where it becomes more of a criminal case because right now it's a civil case like he won't

[41:42] do jail time based on this i'm surprised at that yeah but you read up on it and it's and there's

[41:48] a reason why that these white collar crimes get prosecuted differently versus like criminal cases

[41:54] which is violent acts and murderers and whatnot even though i think a lot of people would love to see

[42:00] robert in a jail cell with those people were you scared over the years of his litigious nature

[42:05] oh absolutely okay so the real threat from a lawyer is having to spend the money to defend

[42:11] yourself robert as a lawyer can attack you for free which means the rest of us have to pay to

[42:16] defend ourselves and also very early on in his early meetings robert told us flat out one of his

[42:22] business plans was to quote hit every other pinball company with nuisance lawsuits to slow them

[42:27] down another massive red flag well that's a j pop move to the patent trolling of the industry let's

[42:34] because j pop owns the patent for screen under the glass any screen under the glass he could sue

[42:40] star wars he could sue wizard of us and that was part of john's approach was to go on a patent troll

[42:46] adventure if you will yes and that again peas in a pot so that was that was part of robert's business

[42:51] plan and we're like wow that's fricking disgusting but yeah if you look at if you look at that

[42:56] statement i don't know about a year or two ago robert's talking about who are our inventions that

[43:01] we will license out which translation is patent troll out so that's one of the reasons like he needs

[43:07] to go away he he would have been a negative for the industry there's so much under a pinball machine

[43:11] that is not patented which means if some guy comes along and becomes a patent troll that hurts

[43:16] everyone why do you think he wants to do this like be this he loves suing people he's an asshole

[43:22] but he loves pinball though why would he go into something that's his hobby he's a lawyer the only

[43:28] thing he knows how to do is sue people and when you're only tools a hammer every problem looks like a

[43:32] nail i want to say another thing though remember a year or two ago when he publicly said we will not

[43:38] work with multi morphek robert said that remember that what i think happened okay this is just

[43:43] speculation but what i think happened was robert probably said hey jerry nice p3 system you got

[43:51] there kind of conflicts with our patents over here from johnny boy but uh maybe you can kind of

[43:56] say deal on your boards and uh i bet you jerry's like pound sand and there you go i i wouldn't be

[44:04] i'd be surprised if that didn't happen to be to be more honest i feel like canada should like

[44:08] patent the shooter rod or something like really hold all you hostage until i win like 50 twitties but

[44:15] i'm gonna look into that the last common part that went out of patent was the William style ball trough

[44:21] okay i can't pronounce that word so i can't patent it yeah it would be a ball troll

[44:26] trove like i own the patent to the tro and they're like oh yes really early on robert made it

[44:31] plain as day he was gonna be a patent troll and been are you scared of him anymore seeing what's going

[44:37] on i think he's got other things to worry about i and i think everyone agrees with that i've been

[44:41] contacted by some of his ex employees now who now want to talk well don't probably be they'll

[44:47] probably be sequestered by the federal government is there going to be a point for you just

[44:51] personally when you're like all right enough is it when j pop is finally permanently out of the

[44:57] hobby like what will get you to stop you know your crusade is it to get this guy out of pinball for

[45:04] life i mean how much worse can it get i mean it's got to be over right what do you think is it over

[45:09] is someone to try to get these assets and build these games after all of this i know i know you

[45:15] i know you read these things i because even though you can't put a great witch john guy who kept

[45:20] talking about oh someone could buy these and i know people are talking and blah blah blah like

[45:24] what the heck was that about let me ask you a question so let's put j pop aside for a second

[45:29] what about burio's food truck because apparently that game is designed it's got all these incredible

[45:37] Disney style animations and i heard it's the best game that they had in their repertoire i know

[45:42] that's crazy to hear that animations on food truck were excellent so i can tell you now what the

[45:48] big mech was in food truck without getting sued right can i say that now it's up to you can now they

[45:53] gonna come after me for what for my trough patent or the trope patent i keep forgetting they would

[45:58] they would they would go after whoever told you because remember robberton also likes to sue or

[46:02] threaten to sue his own employees which he's done on multiple occasions all right i'll hold that

[46:06] for a later date until i you know i see more and more of this company crumble so here's the thing

[46:11] i think j pop's done i obviously deeproot pinball is done and for those people who want to see

[46:16] raza and magic girl and allyson wonderland made then why let me ask you something why doesn't spooky

[46:23] just go get the allyson wonderland artwork from zombie eddie and just make a working game

[46:28] yeah just pay him to redo the artwork i think that would be x i mean honestly well not only is john

[46:33] a hack and he absolutely is a hack he's a hack he's lazy he's pretty worthless but he's less

[46:39] than worthless because he's actually he actually destroys well he destroyed millions of dollars of

[46:43] wealth even the four deeproot hired him it's pathetic it's like at what point is it worth it like

[46:49] well the other thing is destroyed is people's love of this hobby and and ultimately that's

[46:54] where you start to get into a territory where you're losing even more than money like you're

[46:58] driving people out of something they love and they went into it with good intentions and you sort

[47:04] of hijacked their passion for pinball in an irresponsible way because you don't know anything about

[47:10] manufacturing you don't know anything about how to make these things and you took their money

[47:14] why do you think robber took money in December i'm still curious why he even did that because

[47:18] when that happened he knew what trouble he was in on the other side of the business why do you think

[47:24] he did it i think it was a hail marie pass to see if he could sell enough games even if that were the

[47:31] case he's still defrauded people because he spent the money in a way other than he said he would

[47:36] let me just go back to mode of a little bit i believe in robberks mind you know his nebulous mind

[47:42] he was like well pinball is going to make all this money i'm going to sell 10,000 razas or whatever

[47:48] i can take this money out and it's okay because i'm going to make more i'm going to put it back in

[47:52] it's like you know it's like stealing money from the till because you've got a sure thing from a

[47:57] bookie and you can put the money back before your boss realizes it that kind of thing so i think in

[48:02] his mind well even though he was being fraudulent with how he spent the money or how he reported the

[48:07] money i think he thought he was going to be able to put it back in the end because unless he's

[48:11] completely stupid i mean what's the end game like how do you not get caught doing this i mean

[48:16] at least robber was trying to build something like burning mad off was just straight out stealing

[48:21] the money see what's crazy to you Ben is when they only sold a hundred and 22 razas right i mean

[48:27] at that point allegedly 30 of them was bought by robber himself which could also be seen as

[48:32] fraudulent because he's trying to boost the numbers isn't that the point i don't care

[48:37] everything you've been saying about the man if you're delusional if you're this or that if you

[48:41] know whatever size his brain is but when he sees that in number how does he not look at that and say

[48:47] i was wrong they don't want this guy's games like they don't want my company they don't want these

[48:52] products it's over and then he went on podcasts the next week he went on different podcasts and

[48:59] he said everyone's gonna have their games in six to eight weeks when he knew there was no manufacturing

[49:04] this is crazy behavior i would like to know it's like robbert everyone told you not to hire john

[49:11] and you did it anyway i mean did he finally realize oh shit maybe i shouldn't have hired john

[49:17] when he saw those sales i mean that is pathetic if spooky pinball who could make games or american

[49:24] pinball actually revealed raza with you know it's beautiful game it's it's it is a remake of cyclone

[49:30] and it's nice enough to succeed in this marketplace if they announced it they would have sold

[49:35] hundreds of them maybe a thousand or two just because people have faith in the company making it

[49:41] they only are in its sold one twenty two is nobody had any faith they were going to make these

[49:44] games ever everyone's hoping for the next big bang bar that's still what it is and for them it was

[49:50] a gamble but for a lot of investors they're financially ruined over it and then why didn't people

[49:57] take a refund that was the one thing robber did he paid people out well yeah i remember back in 2019

[50:03] when robber got pissed at me that famous quote on pincide what was it well he was like well that's

[50:08] what i realized it was a scam like a scam scam because remember they had a goodwill agreement like

[50:13] you were supposed to have your game by june 2019 originally remember yep and at that point

[50:18] robber would have been in breach he would have basically had to give you your game or give you a

[50:23] refund and he's like well i'll give you a refund or if you don't take the refund you'll get credit

[50:29] for two future games and that's double or nothing scam and all i said was a bird in the hand

[50:36] as we're two in the bush and that's when he got really pissed he's like stay out of it Ben

[50:40] i consider you to be giving legal advice without a license got ratioed to hell for it and that

[50:45] was actually the last thing you ever typed on pincide hey robber robber i'm gonna have the same

[50:49] number of law licenses as you soon zero i do love that in the end deep roots final tally for the

[50:57] number of posts they put on pincide is 69 people it can't get more amazingly hilarious uh well

[51:05] okay so at least when you get screwed with the 69 it's pleasurable all right it's a family show Ben

[51:11] okay so Ben where do you go from here where do you go from here you're now making your game with cgc

[51:16] let me ask you a question about cgc real quick so you're making your game did you see the kind of

[51:21] lame way they finally confirmed cactus canyon is your game gonna be revealed in a powerpoint

[51:27] presentation designed for 65 year old men i have no idea i haven't heard anything about it in months

[51:33] i think they've been all hands-on deck on cactus canyon right i think mine is there's a game

[51:40] after cactus canyon which pope fiction i that's not what i heard and then mine would be after that

[51:48] oh okay what is it what is it can you tell i know i know i know i thought i could catch you in

[51:53] in a moment of excitement not not even when i'm drunk and i'm bright out and bush you tailed

[51:58] right now all right all right well Ben look how long do you think the deep root thread you think we

[52:03] can hit 500 pages on it it's at four sixty seven i want to say or four seventy six oh i think

[52:09] that thing will be thirty k by christmas are you gonna buy a viva la raza t-shirt from canada oh did

[52:15] you make some yep i'm only making a hundred and twenty two of them though well you know that

[52:22] t-shirts can be worth a lot of money you know Ben for being such a great guess on this show i'm

[52:28] gonna comp your canadas viva la raza t-shirt how does that sound that sounds great uh so is it

[52:34] i mentioned in that other thread but that sounds like bill is gonna like try to nuke at least two

[52:39] of the games from orbit which is great so bill brand is still owns the ip for raza and magic girl it

[52:44] was never transferred over it and bill was really smart so bill put into the contract with american

[52:50] pinball that the only way they would own the ip if they delivered to him a fully functioning game

[52:57] of raza of magic girl and it does not fully function and bill is smarter and bill has smarter

[53:05] lawyers than anyone down there had deep root i love bill he's a great member of the community

[53:10] Ben one of the things i've wondered about through this whole thing is the other people involved

[53:15] barrio steve boudin john norris do you think because they are members of the pinball community at some

[53:22] point we know Dennis nordman left but should some of these other people have spoken up when they

[53:27] realize what was happening or do they just get silenced by the paycheck no they're all under strict

[53:33] n d a's you know just like Harvey Weinstein has a Brian singer do you think they'll come out now and

[53:38] tell us what it was really like i don't know i mean robber could like all bends talking i mean

[53:43] just because robberts being sued by the scc doesn't mean he couldn't come after me of course

[53:47] i never signed an n d a with robber i mean he should have had a sign on that day but he didn't

[53:52] but yeah i i would assume they would but they're probably gonna wait until the time ticks down

[53:57] people like iceman you know they they they talk a big game but they don't hear the same rumors

[54:02] the rest of us do like robber is incredibly litigious like ridiculously litigious and you don't

[54:10] know about it because of how litigious he is so ben do you think this is it is this the last pinball

[54:15] scam or ever-gunoing counter or is this community completely gullible for this happening again

[54:20] well apparently there they are well although maybe they're not as gullible because 122 games such

[54:26] way less than they sold a predator that's way less than big libousky so maybe the community is

[54:31] learning it should be if you do not have a production line and means of production you don't ask

[54:37] where a single cent because i kept seeing it bandied around oh deep route didn't take pre-orders

[54:42] they didn't take our money well they took someone's money it doesn't matter if it's not yours it's

[54:47] still someone's money and i mean in a way it's even worse than the ppp loans like the ppp loans just

[54:51] come from inflation but robber was actually taking little ladies money and spending it on this so

[54:57] i would think you know if the barrier to entry for pinball i mean there are other companies try to

[55:03] get into it right now who else is trying to get into pinball right now i don't know who they are

[55:07] but i've heard from any sources that well think about it like it's it's uh what what is it red

[55:13] ocean blue sky this is a green ocean it's like oh my god these people will pay how much for these

[55:17] things so i'm sure that's drawn a lot of sharks i'm surprised wrought thrills hasn't got into pinball

[55:23] i think they're pretty intrinsically tied with cgc so maybe there's no need the barrier for entry

[55:29] it's like if you cannot show your ability to build games you shouldn't get a single cent and i

[55:34] think there should i think you know like you know community portals like pinside it's like uh oh

[55:39] okay uh this company is asking for pre-orders have they demonstrated an ability to show games okay

[55:44] boom they're off the forums right you know we need to we need to police that stuff deep root

[55:49] new they never showed us pictures of a factory and my thought was it's already a scam and but

[55:55] thing is again that that still implies that they sold it as a pinball business which they didn't

[56:00] right like my thought was they're not going to make games if they show pile of parts that's fraud

[56:05] because they're trying to make you think that's a going a going endeavor but it's not but

[56:09] doesn't even matter because they didn't sell it as a pinball investment in the first place so

[56:13] oh my god it's just like mind bogglingly stupid it's like it's like me getting a loan for a house

[56:18] and buying a Ferrari you know you can't do that in the real world no and people were taking ppp

[56:24] money and buying Lamborghini's and they were getting caught now Ben do you think one day in the near

[56:28] future someone will actually go into deep root pinball and open up that door to manufacturing and

[56:35] record what's inside oh it's probably all been removed I'm sure it's been gutted and emptied out

[56:41] it's like it's like that scene in patent where all the Germans are burning all the documents

[56:45] before the Russians get there I'm sure that's already happened yeah oh man it's okay so

[56:52] Ben any final words on this whole thing it does it feel somewhat good to be right on this whole thing

[57:00] not you're loving it oh my god I was teeny wept just to be honest with the last question and you're

[57:05] loving this on pinside I'm I'm actually generally surprised how bad it actually was I didn't think

[57:12] it was this much of a scam so I'm I'm even taking it back in a way like you know

[57:18] I feel bad actually for everyone involved except for of course Robert and John because you had all

[57:26] these employees and they were being paid with money that was taken under false pretense and that's

[57:33] I mean think about I mean that could incur a lot of guilt on someone that's that's a heavy toll

[57:37] to bear so so I like being right but other people were more right than me I mean I know a lot of

[57:43] people who were saying you know this is like this is like a Ponzi scheme this is a scam so I

[57:47] wasn't as right as I could have been and I wish yeah but if you said that I mean look I know one

[57:53] guy on pinside he did say it and he wasn't he was correct now but if you were saying that they

[57:58] would have came after you and I'm so you know and just because it was one dude on page like 3122

[58:04] said it if people like me or people like you were saying that and look we had no proof it was a

[58:10] Ponzi scheme so I wasn't going to say it but if we did have proof if we even reported it we would

[58:15] have been jumping in to the fire I always had to remind people this I'm not the New York Times I'm

[58:20] not the Wall Street Journal and when I jump into these heavily dramatic litigious pinball fraud

[58:27] companies they can come after my livelihood and I'm not making enough money to to play that role

[58:34] for the community yep no that's that's exactly that's the same thing I think so Ben I want to thank

[58:40] you so much for coming on and telling your story I know this is something that you've been

[58:45] personally involved in and you are a good member of the pinball community and you just want to see

[58:50] people get games that they pay for and you want companies not to take money until they know what

[58:56] they're doing right I mean is that an easy way to think about all this I think money from pinball

[59:00] I would prefer that you give me your money instead of throwing it into a sea of stupidity and because

[59:09] yeah all this money that gets destroyed by John or Robert is money that doesn't go to the rest of

[59:14] the industry that's actually creating fun games for you so yeah it's it's it's out of selfish

[59:19] mostly out of selfishness but it's just it's just ridiculous like stop supporting these people

[59:24] who destroy wealth I mean once something happens twice it's a pattern the four times for John it's

[59:29] time for it to end like one last thing you briefly we mentioned this briefly earlier but yes

[59:35] some company just needs to like higher good artist make Alson wonderland it's an ancient IP there's

[59:40] no copyright left and then make a J-pop light game it'll be like the Pied Piper it can lead all

[59:47] of the J-pop fanboys away from J-pop just give him a shiny facsimile and actually make it and then

[59:52] J-pop himself can be the one that falls off the cliff you know I'm gonna do a little spoiler right

[59:57] now and I don't talk about this game very much but my friend who is making this game called Merlin

[01:00:03] who's actually working with one of the artists who worked with J-pop when you see this game this is

[01:00:10] gonna be the kind of J-pop kind of beautiful world under glass game everyone want it from John

[01:00:16] now the reason I don't talk about it is my friend's not gonna show it to the world until he figures

[01:00:20] out how to make the entire thing and if he doesn't you'll never see it and that's the responsible

[01:00:25] thing to do but I just want to say there is a game coming if it does come I hope you guys get

[01:00:30] to see it soon so Ben thank you so much for taking the time always fun to talk to you and I am

[01:00:36] sure we will talk in the near future because uh something you might happen in deep root but something

[01:00:41] you might happen in C.G.C. and I just love hearing your take on the hobby so thanks again for taking

[01:00:45] the time this Sunday well and you know I just told stories from the beginning I mean sure there's

[01:00:50] much better stories from the last couple years and we'll see if they get told and employees will

[01:00:54] be coming on the show so Robert get your lawyer ready we're gonna hear the truth later Ben
