[00:00] You guys on Facebook, man, just join us on YouTube, man. Look at how much better it looks.

[00:08] The sound is so much better. We've got the dual Neo Geos in the picture.

[00:12] Ah, we're going to talk about the award show today. We're going to talk about everything

[00:18] happening in the world of pinball, lovely Saturday here in beautiful Row 8 in Connecticut.

[00:23] Dream. Dreams really do come true.

[00:27] How's everybody doing? We're going to wait for people to come in. It takes a while.

[00:34] The world is waiting for this show. The world is waiting in anticipation of what will

[00:41] Kenae to say this Saturday.

[00:44] How's everybody doing?

[00:48] Sunny babe. Let me close the blinds a little bit. Give me a little bit.

[00:55] Here we go. Right in my eye.

[01:03] We're going to what's up, Raymond? What's up, dudes on Facebook?

[01:10] We're going to go all through the award show winners last night. I want to discuss again

[01:15] with you guys whether you agree, you don't agree. I'm sorry, the show went a little long.

[01:20] I'm sorry for all my likes and ums. I was tired and had some in Addens in me. I don't

[01:26] really love to booze up live. I don't. People wanted it though. And I'm a people pleaser.

[01:34] I gave the people what they wanted. Got a little little tipsy at the end. Not bad, though.

[01:40] Nothing I'm ashamed of. Nothing I would be worried about if HR saw it.

[01:45] I dropped two curse words which I never do, making fun of this stern topper for Star Wars,

[01:50] which is absolutely atrocious. They should be ashamed of it. Got some nice notes from

[01:56] people post show from people within the industry thanking me for their recognition. And that's

[02:03] what the show is all about. And that's why I love doing it. And I think whenever there

[02:12] is going to be an award show, I don't think the stuff that got recognized last night is going

[02:16] to be that far off from where most people will give praise because it was a really interesting

[02:23] year. And what I what I loved about last year's games and we'll talk about it is the variety

[02:31] of stuff that was recognized, the amount of new individuals in the hobby that are being

[02:37] recognized and just the overwhelming talent that is spread out across the hobby. And it's

[02:46] really a good time to be in Pimble. Alright, let's let's copy this one. Hold on a second.

[02:53] I'm going to drop it. Alright. I'm surprised you're on this time this morning after last

[03:03] night, right? Yeah, I don't think as many people are going to join because they got they got

[03:06] their canada fill last night. You know, oh, I'm just trying to move this around. You know,

[03:13] two and a half hours of canadas a lot. It's a lot to then wake up and get another hour

[03:17] and a half of canada. But I live, I eat, I sleep, Pimble. I'm looking at my, I just booked

[03:24] them so excited. I just booked Japan for my big 50 birthday next year. Brenda and I are

[03:32] going for about two weeks. We're going to have to get someone to watch the kids. Antis,

[03:38] get ready. We have the most amazing ants. Brenda's sisters are the best. You know, look,

[03:45] I think all of us and you know, two business class tickets to Japan was the cost of, let's

[03:54] see. Hold on. Chats. Where's the chats? Guys, get in here. Get in here. Gang. Get in here.

[04:08] Was the, was the cost of, like a Winchester was the cost of the beetle juice. Sad boy,

[04:18] man, you keep docking my pay, bro. What's happening here? You might as well have been in

[04:22] Manhattan last night. Last word of a minute. We're classic. Thanks again, dude. Were they good?

[04:27] Did you enjoy it, Sad Boy? Yeah, yeah. I wasn't too bad, though. I know when I, when I've had too much

[04:36] and I don't even make sense, I was still coherent and I was still making sense. Just a little bit,

[04:42] you know, a little much in me, for sure. I, I, I, I can't wait to go to Japan. I'm glad

[04:52] you guys enjoyed the show. We're going to talk about the winners today. And we're going to talk about

[04:58] where I think pinball is going in 2026 and and really the takeaway from last night for me was

[05:04] very eye opening. I think it should be eye opening. And I think if there's one, one very big

[05:12] takeaway from last night, what's up guys? Hey, what's up, came in. Hello from our land room. My

[05:17] wife and I are going to Japan later this year as well. When are you going? I'm, I'm Mike Jones. I'm

[05:22] going to Japan the last week in September through the first week. No, September 22nd through like

[05:28] October 5th. So I can't wait to go to you guys. Everybody book. Let's all go. Let's just take

[05:35] over Japan with the Canadian club. It's going to be amazing. And it's the one place where they know

[05:40] how to enunciate Canada. They would say, Canada. It's Akira, right? It's not Akira. It's Akira.

[05:48] Let's do this road trip, baby. Drinking my coffee out of a Paw Patrol cup because

[05:55] Chase is on the mofo case, baby. Oh, man. It's good. How's everybody doing? We got Facebook.

[06:05] We've got YouTube. I think I burned everybody out. But I keep going, baby. I don't care. I'll talk

[06:12] to one person. Even just one person is watching at the height of the show yesterday. I'd look,

[06:17] there was like zero show promotion. I did a bad job. I should have been promoting the show

[06:21] for like a week or two and made more people aware. It was like day of, you know, like the morning

[06:29] of. So I was still shocked to see we got about 175 people to tune in. I think around at the height

[06:36] of the show. So that was cool. I mean, the word nano influencers. I hope everybody realizes that

[06:41] like nano. There is, there is like influencers making millions a month. There is,

[06:48] influencers making $10,000 a month. Then there's pinball influencers that most of which are making

[06:54] nothing a month. Majority are making nothing. And I think I make the most as a pinball influencer.

[07:03] Maybe I don't know. It's not a lot. It's not a lot. I don't get like the, I'm sure Ralph makes

[07:11] something decent on his YouTube stuff. He gets a lot of views. And I mean, the smart move and you're

[07:17] going to see it in 2026 is, you know, converting the, the Canadian fan base into, into a place where

[07:25] you can also place some orders for some, some hot games. Get ready for this people. It's going to be

[07:29] fun in 2026. You'll see more to come on that shortly in this new year. Let's see. Yeah, there

[07:37] were kids opening a kinder a getting 5 million views, right? It's crazy. I mean, absolutely crazy.

[07:43] So let's do this. Before we go back over, I might pull it up again and we'll see the, the winners

[07:50] real quick. I want to just give you my broad takeaway of what last nights kudos awards to me

[08:02] meant and the big takeaway because when you analyze all the winners and you see all the games

[08:09] from last year, I really think it's, it's nice to have it all packaged together like it was last

[08:15] night because it gives you a good perspective on where this hobby is, where it's going, where the

[08:21] momentum lies, where the energy lies. And I think it's an exciting time to be in Pimbal. I've been in

[08:29] this hobby now for 13, 14 years. I want to say maybe 15 now almost coming up on. I wasn't a Pimbal

[08:38] fanatic when I was a kid. I was an arcade guy. Christopher franchise in the house. The liquor hit

[08:45] you pretty hard. Yeah. No, like, well, the thing is, franchi is I haven't really had a drink all

[08:55] week and I've been tired because I haven't slept much and and Manhattan's with the sugar like you

[09:03] crash. Like they're not like, it's not like an upper drink. It really does slow you down. So

[09:09] thank you for, for thank you, everybody for having the patience to sit through it all.

[09:15] Was it my best performance by any means? But this will be a better show guarantee, but it was fun.

[09:21] I think we all had fun. I think it was fun recognizing the takeaway though, simply this,

[09:26] Stern Pimbal is in big trouble. And there is no denying the fact that Stern Pimbal

[09:33] relative to everything else happening in the hobby is one of the least exciting companies right now.

[09:40] And they need, they need to get their asses kicked a little bit. I think to turn a page.

[09:48] And I think they're going to respond. I do. I don't think they're used to the level of

[09:54] apathy towards them. I don't think they're used to really missing the mark as much as they did in 2025.

[10:02] I mean, it was a terrible year for Stern Pimbal. I don't care what anybody says. I don't care what

[10:06] the apologists say. There is no way they had a great selling year. There's just no way that games,

[10:12] the unboxings aren't there. The sellouts are not there anymore. The just the enthusiasm for their

[10:18] stuff is not there anymore. And then you look at, you see like, you know, the potential for Dutch to

[10:24] enter the race with back to the future. Roses coming back. American Pimbal is even coming back with

[10:30] God knows what, but it just starts to feel like the excitement, the enthusiasm, the energy is all

[10:37] in the boutique space. And that's a okay because there's enough boutiques now, where if you want to buy

[10:43] two or three Pimbal machines a year, you're no longer like thinking about Stern, you're thinking about,

[10:47] okay, I'm going to get Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm going to get Beetlejuice and I'm going to get Winchester.

[10:53] I mean, if you get those three games, you're going to have an amazing Pimbal year.

[10:58] Is the audio choppy? Hans, I mean, sounds good. Am I in? Is it good?

[11:05] Anyone else having choppy audio? There's no audio now. Oh, man, what happened? Hold on, hold on.

[11:19] All right, I know how to do this. I know how to fix the audio. Hold on. We're going to go back.

[11:25] Reload it.

[11:28] Maybe the cable. Is that better? We have audio now. Are we good? Yes, are we back?

[11:39] Oh, okay, I did. We good? Okay. Yeah, maybe I might have jingled the cable. Yeah, it's of course fine on Facebook.

[11:50] Yeah, so I just think there's a lot of excitement and enthusiasm.

[11:56] Let's do this. Let's pull up the winners.

[11:59] Let's see.

[12:05] We can't see it on Facebook, but you see at the top of my Facebook page.

[12:15] All right, I'm going to go real quick. Let's go.

[12:18] Oh, Harry Potter winning best theme of the year. We all agree. I just want to hear yes or no.

[12:29] If you disagree, do you think there was a better theme? I will say when I did Potter as best theme,

[12:36] I would say the other one. I think Beetlejuice would have been number two for me,

[12:42] but I, but, but Potter is way bigger than Beetlejuice. So as an IP, I don't think.

[12:48] You know, I'm just going through quickly to relax. Calm down. Let's do this. Let's go to the

[12:55] let's go to last slide.

[13:00] Because it has everything on one slide.

[13:05] I'm not sure you know this. So all right. All right. So as we can see here,

[13:12] Potter for best theme. All right. Then we have for best theme integration, evil dead.

[13:20] I think I think you guys agree or disagree with the evil dead as theme integration.

[13:26] I think there was a lot of good theme integration this year. I think I think Dune was great.

[13:31] I think evil dead though. The reason evil dead took it and not Potter is I just still don't think

[13:37] Potter has as many mechs in the Potter universe that it that I would have liked to have seen.

[13:45] And again, really difficult eight movies, a lot of stuff. But again,

[13:49] there's nothing magical happening in Potter. The staircase is really cool,

[13:54] but I would like to have there been like a few more things. Okay. So most people agree on evil dead.

[13:58] So for best animations, I gave it to Potter. Again, animations as I explained last night,

[14:05] difficult because most games are not really like animated. It's just organizing clips,

[14:14] which nobody does it better than Potter. I was on the fence about giving it to Potter and JP

[14:18] jump all the wind because I still think Potter is a little complex like overly complex on the

[14:26] screen, but it's still beautiful. Like it's you know what I'm saying? Like so I gave it more of a

[14:30] win for the the the beauty of the organization of everything. Of course, Potter is a better theme

[14:46] than Predator. I mean, it's Harry freakin Potter. Predator is like a tiny, tiny franchise compared.

[14:52] All right. So then best code. I saw people making fun of me on Pinside that

[14:56] canada giving a code award when he doesn't play pinball. I played all these games enough to give

[15:02] awards to Ben HECK and evil dead. I think deserves it. Again, I think when I play evil dead and I

[15:12] explain it last night, I love the straightforward nature of the code. I love how it just

[15:18] is mode based to put you in the movie, put you in the scenes. I love selecting which movie. I

[15:23] everything about it. I love the way spooky codes it's games now.

[15:29] Any any thoughts on best code? I would say that in this category would be King Kong, Harry Potter,

[15:38] for sure. Right? I think Dune is getting there quickly, but I haven't played the latest Dune code.

[15:45] I would.

[15:46] Woke up to us taking out Narco Terrace, but we'll still connect.

[15:56] Yeah, I didn't they extract the Venice Whale in the leader last night. Crazy.

[16:00] Like, it's like some Delta Force stuff. You know what it is, Kelly? I don't really read much

[16:05] news anymore. It's all terrible. It's all misery and gloom and doom every single day. I think if

[16:11] you read the news now, you're just going to hate life and hate the world and hate the people in it.

[16:17] And I don't want to hate the world and the people in it. And I love America. I love what this

[16:22] country's done for my family, my parents, my grandparents, the opportunities. I love this nation.

[16:28] Whenever I read the news, I feel like it's just trying to get me to hate who I am, where I live,

[16:34] and where we're going. You know, once you turn off the news and you turn off social media,

[16:39] happiness begins. It's a beautiful thing. Now, to me, this is not this, this is community.

[16:46] This is not like doom scrolling on TikTok, like everyone's doing these days.

[16:53] So Potter is better code says Bill. Okay. Well, here's the thing about Potter is like, yeah,

[16:59] but it's getting deep into its kind of difficult. So, but I do think giving Harry Potter best

[17:07] launch code that I kind of did that because I did want to recognize Potter code. And I do agree

[17:14] that we should recognize games that launch with great code should be a recognition in this hobby.

[17:21] Do you guys agree with that? That best launch code is different than best code because

[17:27] some games take a year or two to get coded. Like Batman took two years and it was by the time

[17:33] it ended. It was amazing, but it was the worst launch code. So I do like recognizing a company that

[17:38] gives you a great initial out of the box experience. Best music, I think, was one of my, you know,

[17:46] giving it to dirty pool was really, and Jeff Dotson, as I said yesterday. You know, he really,

[17:56] he really deserves it. And he, he goes by the name dirty pool. And I heard from him last night. He

[18:05] sent me a really nice note thanking me for the recognition. And I do think Jeff Dotson and his

[18:11] work that he's going to do. I believe he's working on Winchester next. He's a really, really

[18:16] awesome dude. I believe Jeff was the due to sat down at the piano with me at Expo and just start it

[18:25] like jamming out. He's got a, he's kind of like a little bit of a virtuoso is I was really an

[18:32] imposter on those keys next to him. And he just really good guy. We got David Van S in the house.

[18:39] Can we all say hi to Mr. Van S? David, how are you doing? I hope David that you, you enjoyed the

[18:46] show if you haven't seen it yet, but I hope you also feel that dune, you know, got a lot of

[18:52] great recognition last night. And you know, there was one other that I had for dune. And it was,

[19:03] it was theme integration to me was very close, but to see barrels win for music and, you know, for

[19:11] mechs. Does that not look like Travis? Because people were saying it doesn't look like him. Travis

[19:18] winning for best mech. And the warm mech in dune is really, to me, the best mech of the year.

[19:29] And I, I really want there to be a lot more name recognition for these engineers that are

[19:37] contributing their skills and their talents to making more mechs like that. And it's a really,

[19:44] really amazing thing to see. And again, I think a lot of us are looking down the aisle and you

[19:51] look at a game like Star Wars and it looks cheap. You look at a game, you know, like walking dead,

[19:59] remastered. I don't know. Those mechs are old yesterday's news are 12 years old. Where's the

[20:04] innovation? Where's the new creativity? The other mech and I, it definitely would give it a run for

[20:11] the money is the the worm. It's funny how worms are now like the greatest mechs in all of

[20:16] pinball, but the worm in beetle juice, I think is definitely going to be really up for contention

[20:24] next year. And then I also think what's in sonic the hedgehog and transformers. I'm hearing

[20:31] has some amazing mechs in it. So everyone agree with the best mech being dune because I saw

[20:39] debate about should it have been the staircase with Potter. Don't get me wrong. I love the potter

[20:44] staircase, but it is just a diverter. You know what I'm saying? Like it's cool. It's cool. And it's

[20:51] always diverting. You know, so I mean, on some level, I, you know, it's a diverter.

[21:00] Yeah, I heard just Winchester number seven just went out to somebody. I would love to buy a Winchester.

[21:14] I can't get one. I can't get one. I would love to scalp a Winchester. I'll tell you that.

[21:21] Be amazing. I would, I think you can make eight grand on the table today. 100% eight grand.

[21:27] I think people are nuts. So let's jump. Let's keep going. So the best topper

[21:36] easily beatle juice. I think second one had been evil dead. I mean, spooky's just crushing it

[21:40] with these toppers. And again, I know I went on a rant and I really did just destroy Stern's

[21:50] Star Wars topper, which I deservedly so. And I think that Stern is just mailing it in.

[22:00] On the biggest IP they have, they rush the game. The topper looks rushed. Everything about it is

[22:05] stupid. And I think they need to call a meeting and get everything together because it's just

[22:11] looking real bad over there. Evil dead topper much better than beetle juice. You think so?

[22:17] You think so? I don't know, man. I think the I think the evil dead one. I mean, they're both really awesome.

[22:28] They're both really awesome. Let's see here. Best reveal. I gave it to spooky bug in Luke.

[22:37] This one was another one I was on the fence about. Obviously the potter reveal was great with

[22:42] retro ralves video keys in the back box, baby. They both were great. The reason why I thought the

[22:51] spooky reveal was just a little bit better was how personal it was and how they pulled everybody in

[22:59] and they did more. And there was more of a build up. And there was more of an explosion of orders

[23:07] instantly like potter. And again, like part of it when it comes to best reveal is how the community

[23:16] gets energized by the reveal moment. And I think there was just like a lot more energy with beetle juice

[23:21] because everybody knew they had a grab one or they were going to miss out. No one felt that way

[23:26] with potter because unlimited CEs. So moving forward, you know, now that Jersey Jack, it's exciting

[23:32] to see their new games. I can't wait for you guys to see Sonic. I can't wait. I know some stuff I

[23:40] can't tell you guys. Man, I said I wouldn't say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm just

[23:46] going to say it's going to when you see it, you're going to be like damn damn damn. Stern's in trouble.

[23:55] All right. So most collectible. I have beetle juice here and I explained it. Look, I think Winchester

[24:01] is going to easily go to hold value. So will beetle juice. Who knows? I mean, both of these games are

[24:05] always going to sell for well above MSRP. You're never going to see any of them go for anywhere near

[24:11] what they what they sold for brand new, which leads me to, you know, the five

[24:17] Canadian club member games that we have. Who is doing Sonic James Brown? Who James? James, I love you,

[24:27] bro, like on Facebook, like are you new, bro? JJP is doing Sonic Steve Richie masterpiece. I

[24:32] heard it's his greatest game ever. Best value Harry Potter arcade edition easily. You know, I heard

[24:40] when Jersey Jack released the arcade edition of Potter with everything in it. They had an emergency

[24:45] meeting at Stern in emergency meeting to discuss the impact that this could have if Jersey Jack is

[24:52] going to give full featured games out for 10 G's. You put a Harry Potter arcade edition next to a

[24:58] $13,000 Stern LE and just then just go kick yourself in the nuts if you buy the Stern. You know what

[25:04] I'm saying? Are you getting Winchester's for Canadian club two? I do not have any Winchester's for

[25:10] the Canadian club. David, David, make five Canadian club member games. Make five show games for the

[25:17] Canadian show. So most improved company, right? Love this category, by the way. To me, these are

[25:32] the interesting categories that Colin and his crappy, trippy, you know, the new trippies is garbage

[25:40] run by a garbage man. The new trippies is just going to be terrible. He doesn't even have anything

[25:46] interesting. You didn't even add any interesting categories like no one can use their brain, but I think

[25:51] most improved company to me is a terrific new category. Pat yourself on the back, Canada. And I

[25:57] think no company deserves it more than barrels of fun. It really, David, you did it. You legit

[26:05] picked the theme that I would have told you no way. You knocked it out of the park. You've got amazing

[26:11] engineers. You got amazing sound engineer, mechanical engineers. You've got a beautiful game.

[26:16] The only thing left to be done at barrels of fun and David knows what it is is to get rid of the

[26:22] tick-tack lighting system on the sides and do what Melbourne can help them do and make it more seamless.

[26:30] You know, like the lighting analysis, like get rid of the tick-tick-tack lights, which is easy. And

[26:35] also like you could upgrade the old games to have the new lighting system in it when they do it.

[26:39] So I think once they do that, it'll be the final. I don't like LED strips that are just like

[26:46] stuck in. I think Beetlejuice has it too in the back. I... No, no, no, no, guys, you got to make

[26:52] the lighting not look like it's unfinished, if you will.

[27:00] All right, let's go a few more. Best art, Mr. Francik killed it on Evil Dead.

[27:08] Killed it on Beetlejuice. Do you guys disagree with the tie there? Because I want to say this.

[27:14] And I said it last night, I have to recognize the genius move to do that unique, so unique that

[27:23] art package on Harry Potter CE. I know the play field wasn't done. That's the only thing I'm a

[27:29] little bit disappointed in is they didn't get... Was it Mina, Mina Lima, right? Mina Lima to do...

[27:37] Imagine if they had done the play field different and the top are all in that style. It would have been

[27:43] just, you know, Chef's Kiss. But, but alas, it is stunning now. And I think it is the biggest,

[27:52] most unique, risk and artistic... Like gamble, if you will, to go in a direction like that and they nailed it.

[28:11] And then obviously Eric Minier, Minier, Minier, how do you say it? I always say it wrong.

[28:18] Designer of the year, amazing game, Harry Potter to shoot. One of the best shooting pinball machines of

[28:24] all time. One of the most stunning pinball machines of all time. It is a game changer.

[28:32] I really think they nailed it. And I think the more you get into the code, they heard the feedback,

[28:40] they've brought more of the audio from the movie back into the game more. It's just a stunning

[28:46] game. If you only have one game in your house and it's Harry Potter's CEO, you've got to...

[28:53] You've got something special. It's just that kind of game. And I think Harry Potter really got

[29:01] game of the year as well and for... It deserved it least so. They nailed it. They nailed it.

[29:08] I wish there was a few more like wow mechanical things in it. But again, it's the summer of the parts,

[29:15] the Abbas family who I've come to know more intimately over the last year really is an amazing

[29:24] family and their energy and their enthusiasm for this hobby is genuine. I mean it. I've sat down and

[29:33] I've had great conversations with them and they are genuinely in it. They are passionate about this

[29:40] hobby. They are so excited for what's coming down the road. Even though I try to get more

[29:46] information out of them, they keep me at arm's length. But I really do respect what they have going

[29:52] on. And again, I think they're going to achieve, if not have already achieved, creating

[30:00] the world's greatest pinball machines ever. And they're so close. And I think Potter and

[30:11] Elton and I think Sonic and what's after. I think we're going to see the impact that Steve

[30:20] Richie has had on this company was always the missing piece of the puzzle. They had some unfortunate

[30:27] things happening with licensing deals. They were, you know, if if Lawler's Wonka was, if Lawler's Wonka

[30:36] was able to stay as Toy Story 1, I think it's a whole different, a whole different response to

[30:45] that game. The fact that they had a quickly pivot and turn Toy Story 1 into Willie Wonka and then

[30:54] have to make what was it Toy Story 4? You know, just, you know, unfortunate that they got forced to do that.

[31:05] So I want to say like, I'm really, when I think about what's coming in 2026, I get really giddy.

[31:15] I'm nervous about back to the future. I won't lie. Just nervous. I don't know. But let's talk about

[31:23] some of the rumors I've been hearing. So I saw I'm pinstile. People are trying to like, I don't

[31:27] know why people, I'm not like making this stuff up. I keep hearing from people within Stern's

[31:34] walls, people that work there, that Pokemon isn't great and that Transformers is the only really

[31:43] cool thing happening right now. Hector, thank you so much.

[31:48] Glad to know Richie is making Michael Jackson. Well, you know, Michael Jackson is on the table.

[31:56] I mean, Michael Jackson would be amazing. You know, they had, they had, they were going to make it

[32:02] right when the documentary dropped and they just decided not to. No, that's a thousand,

[32:11] that's a thousand Mexican pesos, right? I did get a hundred dollars last night, which was the most

[32:20] ever, I believe, donated to the show, which is great. I mean, from a single YouTube live. So thank

[32:27] you guys so much. Hector, thank you for the $55. You guys are going to keep getting Brenda wasted.

[32:33] That's where the money goes. Some people, you know, donated to Project Pinball. Can we talk for a minute

[32:38] about, I don't, I don't know gang, like, what should I do here with this story that people

[32:45] keep throwing it on my desk? That Project Pinball made 840 something thousand dollars in revenue

[32:53] last year. Can we talk about that? Are we allowed to ask how the heck does a company with 50 pinball

[33:02] machines, most of which have been placed in these hospitals years ago? Why they, how they have

[33:09] $840,000 in income? And then you see the expenses is 600 and something that, how are their expenses

[33:19] 600 and something thousand dollars? The games are already, they own the games, but it's, but that was

[33:27] just one year's expenses. So I just don't understand where all the money goes. I remember when Ken

[33:36] Kromwell did his fundraiser and raised $50,000 for them and you never really heard where that money went.

[33:47] No, it's, it's like, I don't get it. Everything is public. But they, they just,

[33:57] whatever they're filing, how could it be that much, like, where does all that money go? I mean, I'm just

[34:05] saying because that's a crazy amount of money. And, you know, it's the hardest thing too is that nobody,

[34:20] I don't know, like, I reach out to them, I sent them an email, like, they don't get back to me.

[34:26] I don't know, like, so when I dig and look at the numbers, I am surprised by them. I think over

[34:33] the last like few years, they've raised like something like $4 million. And here, here, here we

[34:39] all are. How many of you are making $800,000 a year? Seriously. And, and the people that are servicing

[34:46] the games aren't charging money. They're not going to pay the services. Games are doing it.

[34:51] It's a charity. They're doing it for free. I don't, I don't know. I was just talking about

[34:59] Project Pinball Bill that they, they had $840,000 in revenue and claim that there's over $600,000

[35:07] in expenses. I don't get that part. And these raffles are shady. So you're selling a single game

[35:17] for double the price. Where does that money go? You know, so when you sell one betelgees for $24,000,

[35:27] where does that money go? Are they even paying full retail for that game? Is spooky donating them

[35:33] as a tax or I don't, I'm just the whole thing, the whole thing to me is a little sus because of the

[35:43] amount of money. Well, most of the games are at Ronald McDonald houses. Yes. And they've been,

[36:03] but they've been there for years. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, look,

[36:12] this is as much as I'm going to do on this is just say, I don't know. I'm not going to go on some

[36:21] investigative journalistic like witch hunt, but I would like to know where all that money goes.

[36:30] That's the only thing. You know, and then you look at the games that are in the hospitals. They're

[36:35] not expensive games. There's maybe one wizard of us somewhere. But for the most part, a lot of

[36:39] spider-man, a lot of spider-man home editions. Yeah. I mean, I think the guy used to have like a

[36:48] lucrative, I think he was maybe a lawyer or something. He said like a lucrative job. And now he's

[36:52] doing, and he's making a lot of money. Come on. I mean, you can't tell me that they're not

[36:57] pocketing. This is their job like six, like a lot of that money's going into their own pocket.

[37:04] I mean, I don't know. Like that's just, I just, I don't know. It gets every day's an expense

[37:12] if you're running a charity. Well, it is what it is.

[37:26] You think construction? Okay.

[37:27] The thing is, I never hear anybody else ever even question this. And yet, and here's my issue

[37:38] with it. There are a lot of people that you know very well who have pinball companies that are very

[37:46] against project pinball and will never publicly go on the record to air their grievances with

[37:58] project pinball. Right. They come to me. Like they give it all to me. They're like, look at this.

[38:01] Look at this. Like, okay. If enough people want to push this boulder, I'm cool like being, you know,

[38:10] just pushing it a little bit and asking some questions. And they're fully within their right

[38:16] to respond. I emailed them. They didn't get back to me. I don't know what else to do. I'm not going

[38:22] to like call them and blindside them. But yeah, I think I do think they owe with this amount of

[38:29] money coming out. I think they do owe the community more of an explanation of where all this money goes.

[38:34] That's my only thing. And I think, you know, people, what annoyed me this week was that

[38:49] guy that lied about getting the second topper. And then he, to make a man's, he just donated

[38:54] $1,500 to project pinball. When I saw that, I got really annoyed because I just thought, what is

[39:01] this now? So they're they're acting like any, any donation to project pinball absolves you of

[39:08] your sins, wipes clean your record, restores your credibility and your reputation. It's garbage.

[39:14] Like, why does project pinball deserve that money? And now where is that $1,500 going? So this

[39:20] guy donates $1,500 bucks. It goes right into the pocket of project pinball to their expenses.

[39:27] And the guy donating it gets a tax right off. And project pinball gets a tax right. It's just,

[39:32] how is that how you make a man's for lying that you've got a topper that you didn't pay for? And

[39:39] then you sold it like a scumbag. And there's no other way around it. And I heard the guys response,

[39:46] you know, I got caught and I like, what what? Who are these people that are in like a difficult

[39:53] financial space ordering $2,000 toppers? Project pinball first class airfare.

[40:09] I mean, I don't know. You know who? And I think you guys know, you remember Richie Ranch? You

[40:16] guys remember Richie Ranch? Remember Richie Ranch? He used to have every Jersey Jack, CE number 12

[40:25] in his front of his plumber business. He tried to do that to me years ago. It was one of the most

[40:33] frustrating moments in this community for me. I'll give you the story real quick for those who

[40:38] don't remember or didn't hear it. I bought one of Brian Allen's Rick and Morty Translites.

[40:45] He made, I think he made like 25 of them or something or 50. He couldn't sell them because he

[40:49] didn't have the IP permission, but he sold like 50 of them. I bought one. And Richie Ranch bought

[40:55] it from me. I want to say for like, I put it on eBay, he bought it for, yeah, I want to say something

[41:04] like two grand or something like that. I could go back and look. So, you know, he knew, he knew I

[41:11] knew who you was and he's like, you know, it's Richie Ranch. Like cool. I was like, all right Richie

[41:15] awesome. I'm going to FedEx it to you. I FedEx it to him. $2,000 Translite. I FedEx it to him. And

[41:26] he then, he doesn't even reach out to me. He opens. This is crazy. He opens

[41:34] a credit card dispute chargeback saying he never got it. Like this, this is, that's the first movie

[41:42] does. I never got it tries to credit card chargeback and get his money back. Okay.

[41:53] I'm like, Richie, what's up? Like FedEx says it was delivered. And he's like, I never got it.

[42:01] I want my money back. I'm like, okay, well, that's, that's, that sucks. Like, hold on a second.

[42:07] But before you do the chargeback, why didn't you come to me? Let me see what's up. Okay. Again,

[42:12] this is a guy sitting on over a quarter million dollars in pinball machines bragging about his

[42:20] Dodge Viper. Like how much money he has, right? Over two grand. You know, you talk about like

[42:26] someone's character and someone's reputation. How thinly veiled people are when it comes to anything

[42:32] like with money involved. So I reach out to FedEx and they say, we delivered it. I was like, Richie,

[42:37] what's your address? He's like, this is my address. Okay, Richie, they said they delivered it there.

[42:42] They have a picture of it. And it was signed for by somebody. Right? Okay. Now let me ask you guys

[42:52] a question. If you, if you were expecting a package to be delivered and you have a wife and two

[42:59] kids, would you not ask them, hey, did anyone get a package? Okay. So like two days go by, FedEx is,

[43:09] you know, trying to track down the package. They said they delivered it. He then hits me up and

[43:15] is like, because then they told me who signed for it. He's like, that's my wife. I'm like, Richie,

[43:21] so then he's like, oh, my bad. Like my wife had it. And this is like five days later after I had to

[43:27] do all this work trying to locate this package. The dude, the dude just didn't want to pay for it.

[43:35] And I just don't understand. Like why you would do that to somebody. And you know, I never really,

[43:45] and then he, you know, he had a whole period where he like,

[43:48] flamed out of the hobby and sold all his machines. And I don't know. But,

[43:53] you know, he never really apologized. It was just a weird thing to do to somebody.

[43:58] Look, I'm not the, I'm no saint. I've got my issues. Can't hold my liquor very well. I sometimes

[44:07] will say things I don't mean. I sometimes go on unfair, rants. But for the most part,

[44:14] just when you get caught, just do the right thing. And don't be a crook. Don't try to steal.

[44:22] You know, I went through a difficult thing with that Fixed If Felix game and, you know, like,

[44:28] and it got resolved. But I'll never do a deal like that again. I bought the game for,

[44:33] I think it was like $7,500. And I was like, I don't want the paperwork for it,

[44:38] which was the other $1,500 I owed him for the paperwork. That's how we said, like, I took,

[44:43] I left with the game $7,500. I'll give you $1,500 for the paperwork later. He's like, okay.

[44:47] And then I was like, I don't want the paperwork. He's like, well, you can have it anyway. And

[44:50] whatever. I should have just whatever. The amount of people calling me a crook in a thief.

[44:57] And I robbed this kid for like, I lived with that for years. I should have just, it annoyed me.

[45:02] I'm like, never, I'll never do a deal like that again. And even though him and I resolved it,

[45:06] people still bring it up like I'm a crook. I've done probably 50 arcade and pinball deals.

[45:13] Since then, it never had a single issue.

[45:21] So yeah, look, project pinball, whatever. Okay. So let's talk about, let's talk about

[45:28] the fact that there's not going to be Pokemon at CES. And now we're hearing the earliest we're

[45:33] going to get the next turn game is sometime in late January. Hmm. I don't understand. I don't think,

[45:42] I might not be Pokemon now. I think it might be Transformers and they might hold Pokemon

[45:48] to reveal it at Comic Con because remember, the next game would be Comic Con time frame. Why would you

[45:53] bring, I make more sense to bring Pokemon to Comic Con as the big launch? So, which is good because

[46:02] I think Stern needs a freaking hit. And I hear Transformers is the hit. And I hear Transformers is

[46:06] the game that everyone is most excited about.

[46:13] So, what do you guys, I mean, look, I'm excited for G1 Transformers. Now if they need to get

[46:25] Stan Bush's music in the game, they need to have a transforming

[46:32] something happening. They need, I just worry, I don't know, we'll see, I worry that Stern.

[46:38] They just, they just look cheap. I just, it's like nowadays, if you had to pick a company to make

[46:46] your favorite theme, it's like, now you've got like spooky barrels and JJP. I don't think anyone looks

[46:52] at, I don't think anyone looks at Stern now. I was like, I want Stern to make my dream theme anymore.

[46:58] The Pokemon 30th anniversary is February 27th. Wow, that ages me because I did Pokemon's

[47:05] 10th anniversary. 20 years ago, we had Hulk Hogan, we had a big Pikachu balloon in Brian Park.

[47:16] And we basically had the most amazing birthday bash. And because Pikachu and Hulk Hogan had

[47:23] the Pikachu colors, I'll never forget how big Hulk Hogan was standing next to him. I was like,

[47:31] dude's arm is like literally the size of my body. It was awesome. If you Google it, I got, I had

[47:38] all these like, what's crazy is I had all this like anniversary stuff, a watch and a poster. And

[47:44] just for like giggles, I put it up on eBay and like a watch sold for like $900. The poster sold for

[47:50] like 500. And these collectors are rabbit. Oh man, Zambi Eddie doesn't look man. You know,

[48:01] I feel bad for Jeremy because he's like so talented. And he works so hard. And he has to deal with us.

[48:16] Sucks. Sucks.

[48:22] You know, I don't, I don't think he has bad taste. I think, I think he just needs a little help

[48:29] and a little guidance at times. And I also just think his hands are tied on so many of the decisions

[48:34] they get made that is I bet he gets forced into going with it, right? If Disney's forcing us to

[48:42] work with this artist, then we have to go with it. But I don't know, I just feel like all of Star Wars

[48:48] was was half-assed all of it. How could you say men about Transformers? Kelly, I mean, if you're

[48:57] a child of the 80s, raise your hand. Transformers was the hottest toy line of our childhood. I love

[49:07] Transformers. I wouldn't have sent the message that Jeremy sent to me. I think that was unfair

[49:21] to say that I'm ruining his like family and his desire to work in pinball. Like that's not fair, bro. Like

[49:32] and it was me. He didn't even do the art on the walking dead. I don't know why he took it so

[49:37] personally. He wasn't even him. Because he is the art director. Like ultimately, the book stops

[49:43] at the top. But man, he should have just called me up. I mean, I would have been nicer to just

[49:48] get a phone call. Be like, Chris, come on, man. Like let me explain something to you, right? And

[49:52] then it would have been cordial. What do you like about the Star Wars top? It's terrible.

[50:04] Now, I bet Kelly Daniel was into gobots. He's one of those kids. You remember those kids who like

[50:09] they were into gobots. You're like, man, there's like the poor man's Transformers.

[50:18] Yeah, I was a kid. In the 80s, I was a kid. When Transformers was hot, I was 10 years old.

[50:28] I loved it. Man, there was nothing like walking down that aisle at Toys of Ross and seeing just a

[50:35] row of Transformers, GI Joe aircraft carrier using our imaginations.

[50:48] My 27 year old son's is Pokemon is a great pymball theme. I still don't think it hits the right

[50:53] demographic, but we will see. Look, it's the biggest IP in the world. It's a great theme.

[51:01] We'll see what they do with it. We'll see what they do with it. I had the best childhood, man.

[51:10] I miss my childhood. I want to give my kids a childhood like mine. I mean, it wasn't without

[51:18] difficulty, but what I loved about my childhood was how much we played outside,

[51:24] how much we used our imagination. And what I loved the most about my childhood of the 80s and 90s,

[51:29] besides all the great music and movies and content, I just loved that we will always be the last

[51:38] children to ever grow up without technology without technology interfering with our lives. We are the

[51:46] last generation of that. It's so sad to see what we've done to childhoods because of technology.

[51:54] We are the last. We know what it's like to see the advent of interesting technologies.

[52:04] And we got to see video game consoles go from Atari to 8-bit to 16-bit. Remember the jump?

[52:12] Remember how exciting it was to jump? Remember how exciting that was? How exciting it was to then

[52:19] have Neo Geo hit, go into the arcade every week and there was a new game and how exciting it was to

[52:26] have to go out, socialize, go to an arcade to see graphics you couldn't see at home. It's magical.

[52:37] You know what I miss too is going to the mall. I went to the mall this last weekend and I'm like,

[52:42] man, sucks now. These kids like, where is everybody? We used to go to the mall and get excited

[52:52] where are best outfits that we thought were cool but we look stupid now. We're looking back

[52:58] baggy clothes, like those long rope gap belts. Just trying to look cool at a young age is part of childhood.

[53:09] And I really miss going to the malls. When we were in school, we go to the mall and then we

[53:15] watch a movie altogether. And when a movie came out, what I miss about our childhood was how

[53:24] those movies and those films just created an indelible moment, a real sticky moment in culture.

[53:31] Everybody saw the movie. Everybody was excited for like Terminator and Jurassic Park and back to

[53:38] the future and Star Wars and there was no reserve seats and you waited online. I remember waiting

[53:45] online for hours to get tickets to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and just the excitement of being

[53:53] there. Nowadays, not only do we not have any of that anymore, but nowadays you go and rot in

[54:03] tomatoes and you hear people say the movie sucks and it sucks because all we are now is like

[54:10] as a world and I know we all contribute to it in Pimbo as well. We just become a world where

[54:14] everyone's opinion now is everywhere. And back then, we just enjoyed it. We didn't complain

[54:23] as much because there wasn't a medium to complain on and we've simply invited a cultural shift

[54:35] towards negativity and complaints and really just making money off of unhappiness is everywhere

[54:46] now and it's where the big bucks are. And I hope you don't feel that about Canadian Pimbo

[54:52] podcast and I hope last night was a good indication of how I really do think there's more good going

[55:01] on than bad in Pimbo. I think there's a lot of great stuff in Pimbo and I think Stern just has

[55:06] its work cut out for it and I think if Stern, if I'm them and I'm Seth and I'm George, I see

[55:13] I see what people are saying and I see the opportunity to improve and they need to at these prices

[55:19] they need to. You know, when I think about a toy like Teddy Ruck spin, I always use this analogy.

[55:29] Imagine if Teddy Ruck spin came out today, it would get destroyed but it was magical. You know,

[55:35] we used to see like Saturday morning cartoons and toy commercials and then want the thing and then

[55:40] go get the thing and drive to the toy store and there was no Amazon, there was no online, like you just

[55:46] you went, you went, you went and your world opened up. Absolutely.

[55:54] The fact that we as a world, we decided to close down toy stores in favor of online shopping.

[56:03] We've chosen convenience over a culture and community and this convenient world that we've created

[56:09] has made a generation of kids unhappy, depressed, suicidal, isolated and lonely.

[56:17] And now you look at what is the trend now with younger kids, Jen Alpha and now out and then beta babies.

[56:22] What is the new trend that's sweeping culture? A return to analog, a return to reading.

[56:29] They are craving simplicity, they are craving being present and they are craving the ability to

[56:37] focus on something and not be so distracted. They're craving the childhoods we all had.

[56:43] That's what I hope to give my children. We only do screen time on the weekends and

[56:53] we live in a very active town. I'm really looking forward to raising these kids to be miniature versions

[56:58] of Canada with better haircuts and better career choices. Anyway, how's everybody? Yeah, I love

[57:10] magazines, man. Well, you know, not to get way off topic, but I'll get off topic for you,

[57:15] you got to imagine when we were kids, and I'm just going to say this is a weird thing to say,

[57:22] but when you're like in your puberty years and your introduction to like sexuality is like a

[57:28] playboy in a penthouse magazine versus the what kids are seeing today, no wonder. They're messed up,

[57:36] you know, these kids think that's what intimacy looks like. Whoa, you're in for a rude awakening

[57:42] because ain't no real woman wants that done to her.

[57:49] I got lucky because Brenda is freaking hot. Like whenever I think about Brenda, I mean,

[57:55] she easily could have been in any of those magazines and you'd be like, damn, like how did I end up?

[58:00] I really scored. And it was all random. I just randomly saw her. I don't know if you know

[58:04] this. I randomly saw her on Tinder. She didn't swipe right. And in her photos,

[58:08] were a dude I work with who was gay with my friend Allen at the time. And I was like,

[58:13] Alan, I knew they weren't dating. He's like, oh, yeah, Brenda, they're childhood friends from

[58:18] Galway. He's Irish. That's how we met. Serendipitously. If I didn't even, if I didn't even go on Tinder,

[58:25] I don't see her face. I never would have met her.

[58:28] We, these kids wouldn't be here. In just one little nanosecond, I decided to stop. And also like,

[58:36] he wasn't in the photos on Tinder. She, she, she had her Tinder profile. She had a link to

[58:41] Instagram. And that's where I, if I didn't click that link, I don't see him in those photos.

[58:45] These kids aren't born today. I'm not here in Roedin with his beautiful Irish wife with this

[58:49] amazing family. I like talk about like, you know, you got to make your own luck in life. That,

[58:55] that was lucky. And I hit the jackpot because she's amazing. I mean, I, we just bought, I,

[59:02] you know, one of the gifts I gave her for Christmas was a business class ticket to Japan. So I got her

[59:06] a business class on, we're going A and A airlines. The room, it's called. It looks so awesome.

[59:13] I am so excited to get to September the room. And if you go look on YouTube, like I love,

[59:20] I love traveling when you, when you look forward, forward to the flight. It's a different world,

[59:27] a different world. Each ticket, I'll be transparent. It was like 5,500. You know what? It's worth

[59:35] it. Storm pro or trip to Japan. You know, because those of you who know Japan, that's just the

[59:42] airline costs. The hotels are not cheap. But you, but the key is don't spend a lot on the hotel

[59:48] room because they're all tiny and you're not going to spend much time in them. But we will splurge

[59:53] in Kyoto. We will stay at a traditional Ryokan. We stayed in one last time. Absolutely. Talk about

[59:59] a reset. Talk about a cleansing of your soul and your spirit. Make your way to Ryoto.

[01:00:07] Kyoto. Stay in a traditional Ryokan with sleep on the floor. Have a bento box in the morning

[01:00:14] with fish and some omelette and reset. And that is what Japan, it is to me, it is the only

[01:00:23] culture left with class. And I mean that they're the only culture left with respect and class. And

[01:00:29] I know they went through hell to get there. And they were, they had the greatest convalescence

[01:00:34] in the history of any nation ever. And when you're there, ain't no like melting pot. 99% of the

[01:00:41] population is Japanese in Japan. And nobody bumps into each other. 29 million people in Tokyo,

[01:00:49] bro. 29 million. And they can't sell a thousand dunes. Seriously.

[01:01:02] Yeah, I mean the food is just, they have the most Michelin stars in the world. But everyone

[01:01:14] also knows you don't need to go to the Michelin star restaurants to have amazing food in Japan.

[01:01:17] It is, it is the, you meander through, Kyoto was my favorite. One of our most amazing days ever was

[01:01:26] we're meandering through Kyoto. You see the gaysha's. And we just, we walk into this tiny little

[01:01:35] sake bar. And the owner and his daughter, you know, they speak broken English and they realize

[01:01:42] we're from America. And they bring out these two instruments and they start playing like when

[01:01:46] the saints come marching in on like a flute and like for us. And we spent a bunch of money in

[01:01:53] there and they just, I've never been treated. And then one night in Kyoto, we were hungry. It was

[01:02:00] late at night. And we see this beautifully dressed couple walk out of this door like no name on it,

[01:02:08] nothing. And it was a restaurant. And we knock on the door. And they're like, you know,

[01:02:16] I'm like, well, are you, they're like, we're closed for the tonight. I was like, oh, you know,

[01:02:20] we're just starving. We're on our honeymoon. Like, and they were like, come in.

[01:02:26] And we had the most amazing meal of our life in this tiny little amazing high-end restaurant hidden

[01:02:31] in the middle of nowhere. And there was just another Japanese couple celebrating some moment

[01:02:36] or anniversary sent a bottle over. We spent, you know, a good chunk in there. And then, and then,

[01:02:43] you know, I tipped like a lot. And you don't tip in Japan to sign a disrespect, but I tipped a lot.

[01:02:47] Yeah, you know, because even though that's your culture, in my culture, Sicilian, we tip. And

[01:02:54] I'll never forget it. We walk out and the whole staff comes out. They're like four or five people.

[01:02:58] They come out and they just are waving to us. Goodbye. Like thanking us. They're probably like the,

[01:03:03] you know, dumb American, whatever. But whatever. I don't know what they were saying. But

[01:03:08] would that ever happen in New York City? No. And then you could tell this is why I love my Japanese

[01:03:16] jazz bars in much in New York City because they're like that. They're so nice.

[01:03:27] Yeah, no, and if you ever go to Pissale in Tokyo, for those of you who know what I'm talking about,

[01:03:34] Pissale is this, it's just this like tiny narrow street. And it's filled with tiny bars that have like

[01:03:44] max capacity, like 10 people. And they're amazing. And there's just like one after another. And

[01:03:52] it's just like you go get drunk and then you eat like yakitori and you're just like, and you piss in

[01:03:56] the alley. No, I didn't piss in the alley, but that's why they call that because it smells like, you

[01:04:00] know, piss. But you know, we need more of that in this world and in this culture. And

[01:04:07] I mean this when I say this, I really don't know what I would do without the pinball community,

[01:04:14] because you guys are the best. And like using pinball as a connection to other people that grew up

[01:04:22] sort of in a similar time and are into similar things, there's no greater value in life.

[01:04:29] There's no greater value in life than the connections we've made and the trips we're going to take

[01:04:33] and the places we're going to see. And I really do encourage each and every one of you to make

[01:04:38] 2026 a year of adventure. I think it should be for all of us. I don't know what the future holds.

[01:04:44] I don't know what's going to happen at my company. We just got bought. I plan to go into work

[01:04:49] on Monday and show up, commit it, optimistic and energized. I am not someone who believes in

[01:04:56] doom and gloom and worrying about whether or not I'm going to have a job or not because I'm very

[01:05:01] confident in my skill set. I'm very confident in myself. And I've been let go three times in my career.

[01:05:07] And it happens. And you also learn that it's never personal.

[01:05:15] Because when you have self confidence, then they can't take it from you.

[01:05:20] And I always say this to Brenda is like, I wish Brenda had more confidence. I probably have

[01:05:24] too much for one man. But and I'm probably overly confident. And then something bad happens.

[01:05:29] I'm not planning. But I, but I'm, you know, I'm not in debt. I'm planning. I'm always planning for

[01:05:35] the future. But I'm also enjoying today as much as I possibly can as much, you know, and I always say

[01:05:40] and my old boss Gary V says it the best, you measure success by how many days you wake up in a good

[01:05:45] mood. And if you start to live life like that, how many days will I wake up in a good mood? It,

[01:05:52] it, it, it, it will, it will lead you on a path of self improvement. I definitely want to

[01:06:00] ease off like alcohol for sure because I just too much

[01:06:06] during these like winter months and you're not out and about and and and I don't like waking up

[01:06:11] feeling groggy. I'm not 22 anymore. So it was hard about socializing for me is I do this,

[01:06:23] I cleanse, I get in great shape. And then I feel good and I want a party. You know, it's like,

[01:06:28] it's like the cycle can can continue is a little bit. But look, I think, I think we're going to

[01:06:37] have one of the most exciting pinball years ever. And I've said this for a while and I'm, I mean it.

[01:06:44] Here is why 2026 is going to be, I think the best year in pinball since I've been following this

[01:06:50] hobby. Beetlejuice, transformers, let me list you. Beetle, Beetlejuice, transformers,

[01:06:58] Winchester, the next game from barrels of fun. All right, Sonic the Hedgehog.

[01:07:06] Right, the next Keith Owen game, maybe fall out. I think he's going to, I think he's going to

[01:07:12] stick the landing on fallout, to be honest. And then we're going to get goonies.

[01:07:20] And then we're going to get back to the future. Now you tell me, it's not going to be the best

[01:07:27] year in the history of pinball. It is the best year. Save your money, save your pennies.

[01:07:37] It's going to be good. And you know, I can't wait to cover it all. I can't wait to be here with you

[01:07:41] guys covering it all. I want to thank you guys who are Canadian subscribers. We always lose a lot,

[01:07:48] not a lot. We always use like on average at the end of every month, I lose 10 to 20 subscribers.

[01:07:55] And then on average, I gain 10 to 20 subscribers back. So I'm always hovering around the 700

[01:08:03] mark. What I will not do is raise the price. And I've said that and I've stayed true to that.

[01:08:16] Well, I always laugh when people, I don't even think like Bill Brandnis' subscribers,

[01:08:20] the guys got millions like, you know, Billy, I'm talking to you right now. He's like, I don't have time

[01:08:25] but I think dude, you're always hanging out here like we need to have time. And Bill, it's not about,

[01:08:30] I don't care if you even listen to the damn shows, bro, just show some support, man.

[01:08:36] You were at my wedding. You know what I'm saying, Billy? Sabrina, like Sabrina's one sushi

[01:08:44] like hand roll cost more than a year of Canadian Spinball podcast. You can do it, bro. You can do it,

[01:08:51] Billy. I believe in Billy Brandnis. I love Bill Brandnis. Never heard of him. That's not exactly

[01:08:59] true. We were like brothers. Happy New Year, Michael Grant. How you doing, buddy? Michael,

[01:09:06] how's Stern going, man? What's the vibe over there? Do they have like, Canada's face on a

[01:09:11] dart board? They're like he's ragging on the star, the Star Wars stopper again. Never got my

[01:09:18] Alice ordered 1024 getting my deposit back. Dutch needs a US manufacturing on back to the future.

[01:09:26] I would give even more if I was at the wedding. Well, maybe I should get married again. I should do a

[01:09:34] pinball wedding with all you clowns as my guests right next to the franchi dart board. Yeah, they're

[01:09:41] probably like, yeah, man, like we don't need franchi. We could do it ourselves. Open up a Skittles

[01:09:47] package. Let's make it look like this. Catch the rainbow, Stern Pimbal.

[01:09:55] You know what's funny is when we make fun of Stern for looking like a Skittles bag exploded

[01:10:01] over their games. I mean, it's like it does look like that. Yeah, Bill was on Millionaire Matchmaker.

[01:10:13] I love it. I should go on there. 100-hundred-hundred-a-err matchmaker with Canada.

[01:10:22] Now, Bill's a really good guy. He's, you know what? You know, it's interesting when I was talking to

[01:10:27] someone who has a lot of money, a lot of money. And he was like, you know, when I go to parties and

[01:10:34] and everyone says like, what they're in do? And when I say pinball, like everyone wants to sit next

[01:10:39] to me. They want to hear about it. The other stuff is just boring. Everyone has to bring a

[01:10:47] machine to the wedding. That'd be fun. Ah, man. Well, I think this, I look, I think Yeti,

[01:11:02] one of these people doing, I'm like watching these people like, I think they're lost. They're

[01:11:06] trying to find a house or something. Are they going to really park in front of my house?

[01:11:12] It's like, you know, they're just like, I don't know. Might as well just come in and say hi.

[01:11:19] Like watching these people like, I don't know, they're like, Brenner, how did people even get lost

[01:11:27] in 2026? Like, doesn't make any sense. Brenner, are you expecting anybody?

[01:11:38] It's like, oh, I don't even know these old people are doing. It's like, literally the mailboxes have

[01:11:43] the address. Oh, man. So let's, what do you guys want to talk about? Look, the Alice

[01:11:56] Refund situation. I'm worried about, I'm worried about Dutch. They didn't make enough

[01:12:04] allises and the timing doesn't even make sense. I was, I saw an AppSortKD had some Dutch exclusive

[01:12:12] where it was like, Raza's Mike going to line and like, July and I'm like, what this doesn't work.

[01:12:18] Like, it just doesn't work. And I just feel like if people asked for 100 refunds on Alice,

[01:12:26] it would just like bankrupt the company and they'd be done. I don't know, man. I,

[01:12:37] I, you know, I, I don't know. We all know it's back to the future. What are these people looking at?

[01:12:45] Like, literally, do they need help? I almost feel like I just like, there's like these two people,

[01:12:54] these two old ladies in a car and an SUV just like, like, I don't know, they're probably looking for

[01:13:01] five hundred street. But, um, goonies, I don't have any goonies information other than

[01:13:16] Hi. Yeah. I'm going to the brunch now. Is that who's up front? Yeah. Who is that? Jordan.

[01:13:21] You're going for brunch? Yeah, I texted you. What do you mean you texted me? What am I supposed to do

[01:13:25] watch the kids? Where are you going? Where's, where's Cass? All right. All right. Oh, they're waiting for

[01:13:37] Brenda. And she deserves it. I mean, she lets me, she lets me, she lets me go out with my friends

[01:13:46] here all the time while she watches the kids. So I know, do you see that? She's just like, peace.

[01:13:53] She's, should we go, um, we want to go see the little ones? They're, they're, they're so adorable.

[01:14:01] Let's go, let's go walk downstairs and you guys can say hi to Cass and kill and then what we'll call

[01:14:06] it today. I'll try not to mess up the sound on this. All right, we're walking. Whenever you contribute

[01:14:14] to Canadian Spinball podcast, it goes to the college funds for these little munchkins.

[01:14:18] I'm not, I'm not, I'm not like, I'm just not mentally prepared for what's about to happen.

[01:14:39] Uh oh. You don't want mommy to leave, but daddy's here.

[01:14:49] Say hi. What do you want? Don't know what you want. Look at this guy. Where's he going?

[01:14:59] Look daddy. Let's go. I'm going to place the dragon. Let's get Cass in here. Okay, okay, don't touch it. Don't you? Yeah?

[01:15:10] To place the dragon.

[01:15:20] Let's go back up a little bit. Let me see two. Let's go. Let him see two.

[01:15:23] And who says Cass is going up the stairs. Looks like he's in prison. Where are you going?

[01:15:36] Where are you going? He's like a dragon in prison. He looks like a, a, a dragon in prison.

[01:15:53] Okay.

[01:16:09] Okay.

[01:16:12] I have candy key. Can you please?

[01:16:16] He's at the top of the stairs. Hold on.

[01:16:18] Got me on the candy. Tell them.

[01:16:26] He wouldn't, huh? He wouldn't so fast. And he goes ahead.

[01:16:32] Let's go look.

[01:16:38] You can.

[01:16:49] Come on. Come on. Candy King. Candy King. What candy can? Yeah.

[01:16:57] Come on. Get me away.

[01:16:58] All right. Should we get the kill of candy? Can you guys say say goodbye? Kill.

[01:17:04] Say thank you. Bye. Bye.

[01:17:11] Bye bye. Look at the future. Bye bye. Bye bye.

[01:17:15] Say bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye.

[01:17:19] Bye bye. Bye bye. We're going to end the stream.

[01:17:21] Okay. Yes.
