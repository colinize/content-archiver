[00:00] Como eres de ser dia, dia, dia, dia, dia, dia, sin tu alegría seré un pringao yo no me merezco la pena, dia.

[00:30] And hey everybody, keep it friendly on the Kaneda Chat, we had a boot Scotty out of there, he was threatening people, we come to Kaneda's Bimbal Podcast to have fun with each other, to make fun of people losing $3,000 to $5,000 on LEs and CEs, we don't come to Kaneda's Bimbal Podcast community to get into fist fights in the streets of Philadelphia, Scotty doesn't know how to really be respectful so he's gone.

[00:56] I want to talk about respect on this episode of Kaneda's Bimbal Podcast and the respect between a manufacturer and consumers and how low is the bar that this hobby has set between those two entities and I think when you look at Bimbal and you look at the majority of the Bimbal companies that are successful, the formula and the respect between the company and the consumers is the way it should be.

[01:24] You reveal a game, you show everybody what's in the game, you tell people how much money the game is going to be, you tell people how they can order the game, you tell them whether or not the deposit is refundable or not.

[01:39] You know there's no mystery surrounding a game and you know if you run into some delays the better Bimbal companies will articulate those delays and explain to people what is going on.

[01:53] And I'm looking at two games right now and these games have sort of led people to wonder whether or not they should still stay in on the game.

[02:02] Now one of them is Pulp Fiction Ellie and I have friends hitting me up asking me, hey Chris, hey Kaneda, they either call me by one name or the other, they're asking me how much do I think it's worth and it's a weird question right?

[02:16] Because I'm almost like well what's it worth to you? Do you still want to take possession of Pulp Fiction Ellie?

[02:24] And I think what's making people somewhat gun shy now is it's been two years since the game was revealed.

[02:31] The hype around the game is absolutely gone, like the excitement level around this game is absolutely gone.

[02:40] And when you look at where everyone is excited right now there's a lot of really exciting games about to come out in Pimbal.

[02:49] I think we heard from Christopher Franchi on our show this Saturday that the Goonies is not the next game from Spooky.

[02:58] He said it's going to be an even bigger title and so that leads all of us to conclude.

[03:05] It's going to be Beetlejuice first then possibly the Goonies.

[03:11] So Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice coming out from Spooky Pimbal.

[03:16] That is awesome. We've got Harry Potter, we've got King Kong, we've got Sonic the Hedgehog, we've got maybe Super Mario Brothers, we've got maybe a new Star Wars pin from Stern Pimbal.

[03:26] Back to the future is looming somewhere in the future right? There's just a lot around the corner.

[03:33] And I think what's happening right now if you're an Ellie buyer of Pulp Fiction,

[03:38] you sort of are looking at the future and saying, well, if I'm going to spend $10,000 right now,

[03:46] should I put this machine into my home? Knowing, this is why I'm getting the question, knowing that this game is probably not going to hold value,

[03:56] knowing that the game is not going to be hard to get, knowing that there's going to be a significant,

[04:02] and I mean this, a significant amount of people are going to walk away from their Ellie deposits of Pulp Fiction and not take ownership of the game.

[04:11] And look, when I say significant, I even mean just maybe 10%.

[04:15] That's 100 games that will be available if 10% of people don't want it right now because they're over it.

[04:22] They're simply over it. And I'm going to tell you right now, I walked away from mine simply because of the principle of how this company treated each and every one of us.

[04:33] I don't like what they did. I don't like the bait and switch. When I mean bait and switch, it's like you reveal the game, you took all of our money,

[04:42] and then you took two years to get it to us. That's bait and switch in my honest opinion. I mean it.

[04:48] You baited us with the game and they gave like a tentative like ETA when we could expect the game and then they switched that up on everybody and I just don't think it works.

[04:56] Alright, so here's my thing. Here's my advice to everybody in on a Pulp Fiction Ellie. If you really want the game, get the game.

[05:04] You know, the good news about Pulp Fiction Ellie, it's not 13. It's not $15,000. You're not going to lose $3,000 to $5,000 on this game.

[05:13] Like some of these other games right now, we are seeing Venom Ellie's sell for around $8,000 everybody of $5,000 loss.

[05:23] We're starting to see X-Men Ellie's. Wow, already going in the $9,000 range. We're seeing a crazy collapse of these $13,000 Stern Ellie's.

[05:34] And look, I'm just going to say, ladies and gentlemen, if you're going in now on a $13,000 Dungeons and Dragons Ellie and they're still not sold out, you really have to have your head examined.

[05:45] I'm not saying don't get it. Just don't get it now. You're still going to be able to get it new in box in just a few months once these other titles hit.

[05:53] Just wait, just be a little patient and you will thank me. But I think people are going to move away from Pulp Fiction Ellie's.

[05:59] I think spots will be available. But yes, if you really want one, it's only like $9,500 or $9,700. They didn't overpriced the game.

[06:09] I think if you want one, open one up. The thing is this, there's no mystery waiting for you with this Ellie version of the game.

[06:16] We've seen the SE versions of the game. It's been out for a while. We've seen all the gameplay.

[06:23] So look, I think you should hop on an SE. If you haven't already, like if you're in on a Pulp Fiction Ellie and you haven't played it by now,

[06:31] I think you should go play one first before you write a check for the Ellie version of the game.

[06:37] All right, but that's not the game that really has me sort of scratching my head right now. The game that has me scratching my head and this sort of relationship between the company and the consumer around this game

[06:50] has me a little bit befuddled. And that is this Avatar Collector's Edition game.

[06:57] Remember, this game was revealed to the world in October of 2023.

[07:04] We got that beautifully polished 20 minute $100,000 video in which Jersey Jack Pimbal unveiled this game.

[07:13] A lot of the assets that they used to sell this game and to hook people to order a $15,000 machine was done under a controlled environment

[07:26] in which they added additional UV lighting to make those three colors pop on the SE play field.

[07:34] Since then, this company has struggled to showcase how that feature will work in a normal environment.

[07:43] In a home environment. And even when they brought this game to Expo, you got to remember they had Ellie play fields inside CE cabinets.

[07:53] They brought in additional UV lighting over the machines and they had to put pipe and draping around the machines to get that UV lighting to pop.

[08:05] So here we are now. This CE games are on the line at Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[08:11] They didn't really do much of a fanfare to announce that.

[08:15] They shared some stuff on social, but nothing really major. As I talk more about this game, I think we're all going to come to the same conclusion.

[08:24] This company feels like they've already moved on from this game. It feels a little bit like Stern and X-Men right now.

[08:30] Doesn't it feel like Stern has just kind of moved on from X-Men?

[08:34] Like they realized the damn has too many leaks in it that we might as well just let it collapse.

[08:39] I know that Jack's not going to want that to happen, but it just feels like it, right?

[08:43] Like they're just going to move on to D&D.

[08:45] D&D has all of this support in the software department and X-Men doesn't have much.

[08:51] You know what's funny about all of this is everybody thought that D&D was going to be the filler game as we waited for King Kong.

[08:59] But the nuts part is this. It's now looking like X-Men was the filler game so they could get to Dungeons and Dragons.

[09:07] Remember the reason why? The reason why they made Jack release his game early is because D&D needed more time.

[09:15] It's almost like these games should have been flipped.

[09:18] D&D was supposed to come out before X-Men so X-Men could have more time to bake.

[09:24] But anyway, it just feels like Jersey Jack is already sort of cutting bait on Avatar.

[09:30] And you know why? The sales are not there.

[09:34] I bet they've sold more CEs of Avatar than Ellie of Avatar.

[09:39] I don't think in total this game will even sell 2,000 units. I really don't.

[09:46] But look, if you ordered a CE, you don't care about that.

[09:49] There was enough beautiful stuff happening in the CE version of the game that convinced you to go in on one.

[09:58] Now the major feature of the CE, when you think about it, the topper is beautiful but it's not really the major differentiator.

[10:06] The major differentiator other than the artwork and the armor.

[10:10] The one you're going to see the most, the one you're going to experience the most frequently is the play field.

[10:16] Now news to everybody's ears was that Mirko Playfields is not making the CE playfields.

[10:23] It's Bader who makes all those amazing playfields that go into spooky pinball machines. So that was awesome.

[10:30] Then they also did something different with the artwork.

[10:33] The UV ink on the Bader playfield on the CEs exclusively was going to have three colors that lit up like a Christmas tree when that UV lighting hits.

[10:45] And it was red, green, and blue. The Ellie only has the blue ink.

[10:49] Okay, so everyone's like, all right, awesome. They show some of these features on that launch video.

[10:55] And even when the media went on the tour, even when we went on the tour at Jersey Jack, I think it was like end of September.

[11:02] The playfields, even though they already shot that video that got everybody excited about the game, the Bader playfields were not final.

[11:11] They did not show us how it looked in a final CE version of the game.

[11:16] Then we get to Expo in October, still not final. And we know that Mark Sidon was not happy with the way the playfields were printing when Expo rolled around.

[11:28] And it just begs the question, you've got a game like this. It's in development for how many months?

[11:34] And before you finalized the UV playfield in the CE versions of the game,

[11:41] you are now revealing the game to the world, taking money on it. Now look, I personally think none of this should happen like this.

[11:48] Like you should finalize something as significant as this before you reveal the game.

[11:54] And if you can't make the feature work, or it doesn't work that well, then don't highlight it so much.

[12:02] Don't make it such a big part of the game's reveal video. And also be honest with your customers about it.

[12:09] But man, once we started to see them bringing in extra UV lighting, and even when we went on the media tour,

[12:16] they told us not to take any photographs of that playfield. And then Tom Capara walks in with one of those magna flashlights,

[12:24] like the big flashlights you hold in your hand, a UV version of one, and it's like moving it up and down the playfield to show us all the three colors.

[12:32] But man, it's like Tom, nobody's going to have lighting that powerful when they have the game in normal use.

[12:40] Okay, so all that has happened in the past. So here we are now.

[12:44] CEs are on the line.

[12:47] Games are going to Europe first. I'm sorry I triggered some of you European guys by saying that's a practice that needs to stop.

[12:54] I really don't care about that that much. Okay, CEs are on the line. Let me ask you a question. Anyone in on a CE?

[13:02] Have you seen the final version of the playfields? Has Jersey Jack

[13:09] knowing that they never showed you the final playfield?

[13:13] Have they done a video going over what the final version of your CE will look like when you play it?

[13:22] Have they even confirmed? I know it's going to be beta, but there's even speculation in the thread

[13:28] that they haven't even confirmed that it's a beta playfield. Again, I don't think it's not going to be beta, but the fact that your customers

[13:37] who are spending

[13:39] $15,000 on this product are still unsure of what's about to happen because you're not

[13:47] communicating to them.

[13:48] Why would you if you're Jersey Jack and you've got these people and remember these people are your most die-hard

[13:57] fans ever. The only people in on Avatar CE have drunk the Kool-Aid people.

[14:05] They're all in on this game. Everybody else is wiser and smarter and knows that this is a game that's going to be worth

[14:13] $10,000 in just a few months and you've got Harry Potter coming out in February or March, probably by March.

[14:20] But anyway, at least treat these Avatar customers with enough respect to talk to them,

[14:27] to show them the final version of the playfield.

[14:30] You know, I don't see Mark Siden anywhere promoting this game.

[14:34] It almost just feels like they've all given up on it that he's off designing his next game.

[14:39] I don't like this. How can you have these games where you put all this effort into it and then the moment in which you're asking

[14:46] customers to send in their payments in full because that's the other part.

[14:50] Most of you guys, I mean this when I say this, if you have a deposit down on an Avatar CE, your deposit was

[14:58] $2,500. It's non-refundable. Here's what's crazy. If you walk away from that deposit,

[15:04] I guarantee you in just six months, you'll be able to actually get the game for less money.

[15:11] If you eat that deposit, lose $2,500 and then go get the game for $10,000. It's gonna happen people.

[15:20] Just look at everything else happening. But my point on this podcast is this.

[15:24] I don't think customers should ever be unsure of what the final version of their game will be like

[15:33] when they're asked to pay for full payment.

[15:37] Jersey Jack has been in this hobby now for over 12 years.

[15:44] We know they know how to make content. You can't just put up these $100,000 videos.

[15:51] The one video you really need to put up now, you're incapable of doing

[15:56] what is the UV ink like in the CE version of the game. We're gonna find out.

[16:02] These games are gonna land in Europe.

[16:04] US customers are gonna unbox them. Here's what I think is gonna happen.

[16:08] I think there's gonna be a little bit of those who buy one are gonna justify the purchase and say

[16:14] it looks amazing and the effect of the UV ink is incredible. Unless they've added more UV

[16:21] lighting to the CEs and maybe they did do that. This is another thing I've been wondering.

[16:26] Imagine if they added additional UV lighting to the CE games to make the effect better.

[16:34] They might have done that. Maybe that's why they're not promoting that.

[16:39] Because then you're gonna piss off everybody that has an LE version of the game.

[16:43] But maybe they could just mail all those LE owners whatever the additional lighting is that

[16:49] they could install in their games. Whatever it is. I don't care if it's Avatar. I don't care if

[16:54] it's Pulp Fiction. I don't care if it's the Big Lebowski. What I want everybody in Pinball to

[17:00] realize is this. Every Pinball company should treat you the way they would want to be treated

[17:07] if they were a customer. So when Josh Sharp gets all smug and starts making jokes because he made

[17:14] us wait two years to get a product. I don't want to ever buy from that company again.

[17:21] Is that how Josh Sharp wants to be treated? He doesn't care. He throws money at something

[17:25] and then for two years he waits during radio silence. Would he accept that in anything he buys

[17:31] in his own personal life? But he thinks it's funny that it happens in Pinball. I don't like any of

[17:36] this. I don't like it when a company just takes your money and most times now it's non-refundable.

[17:42] They don't give you everything you need to know before they want you to pull the trigger. And

[17:46] this is how this hobby has been for a while. It's like they want to lock in all this money right away

[17:52] and then you have no more leverage. And it's why I've always been against non-refundable deposits.

[17:59] I think it takes away the onus and the responsibility from these companies to get it right. And think

[18:05] about it. Imagine if non-refundable deposits went away. What would happen to games like Godfather

[18:12] and Elton John and Toy Story 4? All these pulp fiction LEs, avatars, all these games where people

[18:19] kind of ran at it pretty quickly. Even X-Men. I know Stern doesn't do non-refundable deposits,

[18:25] but some dealers sort of make you commit to your LE purchase right away. And if you don't go through

[18:31] with it, you're screwed. I mean everyone who spent 13,000 on an X-Men LE is feeling pretty crappy

[18:37] right now. But that's all I'm asking. I'm not asking the world. Just show people what the final

[18:44] product is before you take final payment. I think that's the best summary of this show. If you don't

[18:50] see what the final product is and are 100% clear on what's in that final product, then you should not

[18:57] make final payment. You could even argue that could extend to what code is in the game, but I'm

[19:02] willing. I'm willing to let the code get better over time. But if it's just a lighting feature

[19:08] and you can't show that, shame on you. You're going to have to show it, JJP. Come on. I did this

[19:13] show today hoping that they'll show that feature today. And remember, gang, the games are on the

[19:18] line at the factory. Is it really that hard for someone over at Jersey Jack to grab a cell phone,

[19:26] turn a game on? You can shut the lights off, turn a game on, turn the phone towards the machine,

[19:32] and let us see what it looks like. Man, if Canada was over at these companies, I'd be doing Facebook

[19:37] Lives almost every day, keeping you up to speed on what's happening each day at these companies.

[19:44] Something's got to be happening, right? It's a company. They're making stuff. What happened today?

[19:49] Everybody have a great Monday. We'll talk to you soon. Canada out.
