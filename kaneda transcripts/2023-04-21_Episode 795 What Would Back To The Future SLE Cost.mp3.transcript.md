[00:00] Hello, you fool, I love you, come on, run your life.

[00:05] CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU

[00:09] Aw, welcome everybody, it's Friday, we're doing back-to-back shows, we've got 617 club members,

[00:16] we're breaking all sorts of records, I mean if you're gonna ask people to donate to your Patreon,

[00:21] you gotta do a show every week, it's that simple, you gotta deliver what the people want.

[00:25] Alright, so here's what we're gonna talk about, we're gonna talk about Stern Pinball,

[00:29] and the code for freakin' James Bond, and how it is slowly trickling out, and I wanna talk about

[00:36] when it comes to games like this, where the code is being built while games are in owners' homes

[00:42] for like an entire year, should a pinball company let the owners know what they're planning for the

[00:48] game? I wanna talk about that, I wanna talk a little bit about multi-morphic, and the fact that

[00:53] there is a piece of furniture that all of a sudden makes this multi-morphic endeavor and this platform

[01:01] a little bit more enticing and a little bit more interesting, and I'm surprised that multi-morphic

[01:06] themselves has not made this part of their offering, we're gonna talk about that, we will talk about

[01:12] this Illinois college raffle charity thing that Stern Pinball is doing for one of two

[01:20] super collectibles signature edition Godzilla machines, we're gonna talk about what else,

[01:26] Pony Factory by Pinball Adventures is now officially a real thing, Slaughter Banks opening up on Monday,

[01:33] is everyone gonna try to grab one of those 120 units, we'll talk about that, and then I wanna

[01:39] talk about just what's next for all these new games, right? I'm hearing a lot of people just

[01:44] trying to get in touch with people over at American Pinball, trying to get in touch with people over

[01:49] at Chicago Gaming Company, and why is it hard to get in touch with anybody at a pinball company?

[01:55] I mean I keep thinking about it, like if you run a pinball company, let's start with this topic,

[02:00] if you run a pinball company, you should be answering every single email within a single

[02:06] working business day, there is no if, ands, or buts about it, there is no excuse, there is no

[02:12] reason why somebody at your place of business is in, always on call to answer any customer service

[02:19] emails, every single customer experience they will remember for life, so when a customer sends you

[02:26] an email and they're waiting for a reply, every day that goes by that you ignore them is basically

[02:32] driving that customer further and further away from supporting your company, from buying your

[02:39] products, and from being a fan of your institution, and we see this all too often in pinball, I don't

[02:45] understand what anybody does at a pinball company on a random day, like what are you doing, what is

[02:50] David Fix and Steve Bowden doing on a random Wednesday at American Pinball, they're not working

[02:56] on the assembly line, they're not designing the next game, how many customer service emails do you

[03:03] even get a day, just a handful, and even if you don't have an answer, so here's what I think goes on,

[03:10] someone might email CGC or American Pinball and be like, hey, when am I gonna get my game, and you

[03:15] should always, even if you don't have an exact ETA for your customer, at least get back to them and

[03:22] say something, just tell them the truth, hey Bob, we got your email about your inquiry, about your

[03:27] Cactus Canyon LE, unfortunately we're still waiting on a vendor for a very crucial part for your game,

[03:34] you will be the first to know as soon as we know what's going on with your order, thank you so much

[03:40] for your support, we look forward to talking to you soon, how hard is it to do that, and when I hear

[03:47] about all these emails that end up with no replies for days and weeks, it really does make me wonder,

[03:54] are these companies for real, why can't they be more professional, and there's a lot on the line,

[04:00] I mean every single customer's experience again will be remembered forever, and every single

[04:06] moment a customer reaches out to you is a moment for you either to solidify a good relationship

[04:13] or to start to turn it sour, and that's on these pinball companies, and I think some of them are

[04:17] really good at getting back to people, and I think some of them are horrible, alright, so let's talk

[04:23] about James Bond code next, okay so James Bond code is slowly trickling out, we heard Mike Vinnacor

[04:30] say hey we're planning a lot more for this game, the thing is this, nobody knows what a lot more

[04:35] even means, and with the latest code update it's like people are trying to understand like what

[04:40] really is changing in the game, and what I get is this, I've been reading the thread, I think what's

[04:44] been interesting about the James Bond code update is what they're doing to the game, I think they're

[04:48] making the game harder in certain areas, I think a lot of like the modes revolve around Q and Q

[04:54] gadgets and Q branches, I don't even know what that means, but I heard that one of the things you

[04:59] have to do to sort of start a mode or get further into the game is hit the freaking missile or the

[05:05] rocket, you gotta hit the rocket, get ready for it 18 times, 18 times to start something like

[05:12] that's way too many times, there's another thing where I think you have to do the orbit six times,

[05:18] and when you're in the thread you hear all these people being like why is it requiring so many shots

[05:24] to get anything going in the game, and if you look down at the James Bond play field there's a ton,

[05:30] there are a ton of inserts, a ton of characters, a ton of movies, a ton of stuff going on in the game,

[05:36] but as of right now I don't think people are experiencing most of it, and so it just begs

[05:42] the question look I understand that Stern Pimbalt is gonna take all the time they need

[05:47] to get the game right, I also understand that Stern's track record is that they usually do at the

[05:54] end of it all get it right, but here's what I think would be interesting if they would just

[05:58] let people know what they were planning to do in the game, would that spoil it for people, do you

[06:05] like to not know anything they have planned for the game and you just want to be surprised when a

[06:10] new code update drops, I could see how some people might want that just like maintain the mystery

[06:15] about what they have planned for the game, some people would like to just know though what is

[06:20] gonna go into this game because then if you're on the fence about buying one at least you have more

[06:25] information about what is in store for James Bond, but again this is gonna be a very slow build,

[06:31] you're gonna be waiting a very long time it seems for what they plan to put in the game,

[06:36] what I'm waiting to see too is like how much more music they put into the game, because I think music

[06:41] when it comes to James Bond and the James Bond movies is such an important part of each of those

[06:46] films and I thought they were gonna get a lot more licensed tracks into the game and also music when

[06:52] it comes to pinball like James Bond, it really is so crucial to creating the atmosphere for the game

[06:58] that really creates those pinball moments you love and I love it when like the musical score

[07:04] changes when you start a mode and the intensity of the music matches the intensity of the mode,

[07:10] that is when pinball magic really gets special, so I hope they get everything in this game that you

[07:15] want, it still feels like it's gonna take forever and a day, alright so speaking of stern pinball

[07:20] that's not taking forever and a day, I am already seeing Foo Fighter unboxing videos, this game is

[07:27] gorgeous, it is beautiful, we're already starting to see people unbox the machine and we're also

[07:33] getting what we normally get with any new pinball launch, we're also getting a few issues, there

[07:38] was a new owner who said after 10 games his right flipper died, I don't know what it is with these

[07:44] stern flippers and what is it, the coil stops that keep breaking on the machines, why can't they upgrade

[07:50] this part, it's almost like the weirdest thing that people are still experiencing this with like

[07:55] brand new games, there was also a new game that got unboxed where one of the soldering joints came

[08:01] loose and the LED light wasn't working and so the owner had to solder the connection back, now look

[08:07] for a lot of people out there, they don't even own a soldering iron and if you are into pinball

[08:12] though, everyone knows this sooner or later you're gonna have to lift the hood, you're gonna have to

[08:17] do some tweaks to a game every now and then, that is just part of the pinball owning experience, I

[08:23] am also in love when people show their unboxing videos because it's another time for us to step

[08:29] into people's homes and just see these incredible collections, like if you look on my Facebook page

[08:35] I put up a video of someone unboxing a new Foo Fighters and he just goes down his lineup of a

[08:42] quarter million dollars in pinball machines and it's almost like oh my god this guy just bought

[08:46] everything, he's bought in everything that's come out over the last like year or two and it's just

[08:51] incredible to see the amount of money, the amount of enthusiasm and the amount of passion people

[08:57] have for pinball and I also feel when pinball companies and pinball distributors are watching

[09:02] these videos, get ready ladies and gentlemen, prices are gonna keep going up, the more we show

[09:09] these companies that these individuals have 300,000 dollars in pinball machines, what do you think

[09:15] they're gonna do to the future of pinball prices, you think they're gonna go down? Absolutely not

[09:19] and again I think it's the LEs and the CEs I think we're gonna see go up and up and up, I look I

[09:24] predict Stern LEs are gonna be $15,000 within two years, absolutely, probably a year from now, I think

[09:29] we're gonna see $13,500 next then $14,000 then when we get back to the future they're gonna

[09:33] charge us like $90,000 for it and everyone's gonna be like take my money now. It is almost

[09:38] terrifying if you ask that simple question, what do you think Stern pinball could get for a back

[09:45] to the future super limited edition if they only made 88 of them? Imagine 88 DeLorean edition back

[09:55] to the future Stern super limited edition machines made by Keith Elwyn and Joe Kamikau,

[10:02] how much do you think they could charge for each one? I'm just gonna say this right now,

[10:06] don't hate me but there are enough multi-multi-millionaires in pinball that are also collectors

[10:13] around the world and don't hate me for saying what I'm about to say, Stern pinball would sell

[10:19] every single one if they made an 88 special super limited edition back to the future

[10:27] they could sell each one for $88,000, they could they would sell out instantly for $88,000, now look

[10:35] they would have to put some unique mechanism or upper play field or something in the game that

[10:40] really differentiates that model and I don't even know like even as I say that I'm like I bet they

[10:45] could just do a different art package and an exclusive topper and knowing you multi-millionaires

[10:50] out there you would absolutely run and kick each other and fight each other to get one and that

[10:55] is where we are at with pinball because pinball is the new watch collecting, the new sneaker

[11:01] collecting, the new car collecting, I mean think about it if you're into cars and you're a car

[11:05] collector you're looking at cars that are easily six seven figures and you might have the capital

[11:10] to do that have you seen inside Joe Kamikawa's garage the guy's got like millions of dollars in

[11:16] cars alone and so look you know many Joe Kamikawa's there are in the world there's enough of him to

[11:22] buy 88 of these machines now look will they do it will they take canada's advice will you hate me

[11:29] I'll tell you this too people who would spend $88,000 on a back to the future SLE would really

[11:35] struggle they would struggle to spend $5 a month to sign up for canada's pinball podcast that's

[11:41] what I love the most too these millionaires and then you're like hey you're a fan of canada they're

[11:46] like yep I'm like hey can we see your machines they're like sure I'm like how much money you got

[11:50] they're like $400,000 in machines and you're like cool are you a member of the canada club for $5 a

[11:56] month and they're like nope nope that's where I draw the line no canada club for me all right so

[12:00] let's move on to this stern auction so they're gonna auction off two of these Godzilla machines

[12:05] signed by the eight players at the University of Illinois the football players now they did this

[12:10] thing with Zach Sharp he's an alumni there so he went over there and he talked to these players

[12:15] about pinball and they made a video about it and now all of a sudden they are going to auction off

[12:22] for charity these two Godzilla premiums that are signed by the players now look I know a lot of

[12:28] people are like this is stupid this is dumb this highly collectible machine and I think everybody

[12:34] needs to realize that not everything is for you like I'm gonna talk about this when I talk about

[12:39] the puny factory not every move in pinball is meant to target you and you could go about some of

[12:46] these moves two ways you could get angered by it and say this is the dumbest thing ever or you could

[12:52] look at it and say well wait a minute maybe this is just a charity auction to alumni of the University

[12:59] that's who's gonna bid on this it's not gonna be pinheads why wouldn't anybody who's really into

[13:03] pinball want to own a machine where the players of this college have signed the translate that means

[13:09] nothing to you now the proceeds to this go to those eight players that was the part that was a little

[13:15] weird it's like shouldn't the proceeds go to the department or the athletic group I don't know right

[13:21] these are players that are on a team these aren't the only eight players on the team so it's kind

[13:26] of strange to me that like all this money is gonna go to just eight players and are they just like

[13:32] pocketing this money so right now these two games one of them is at $12,000 and the others around

[13:38] like 9900 so right now we're over $20,000 for these two machines a stern premiums $10,000 the bidding

[13:46] on these machines ends today look I'm just gonna say I don't really care about this move I know why

[13:52] they're doing it Zach is just trying to do something nice for the school he went to and for

[13:56] these players and he's using the thing he has to create a value exchange between stern pinball

[14:03] and these students the part that just rubs me the wrong way is just handing students money like why

[14:09] do they deserve to get money like that's the part I just don't get and some of these players are

[14:14] gonna be drafted by the NFL I don't think they're gonna have a hard time making much money if that's

[14:21] the case have you seen the league minimum for the NFL so look you could decide to get annoyed by it

[14:26] but I think life boils down the one simple thing you are what you pay attention to if you pay

[14:33] attention to stuff that annoys you you will be annoyed and angry all day long it doesn't really

[14:38] anger me now let's move on to puny factories so pinball adventures has finally after years in

[14:44] the making is going to release to the public to the global pinball marketplace they are going to

[14:51] release a hundred and twenty units of puny factory now we've known about puny factory for a very long

[14:58] time we've known about Andrew and pinball adventures for a very long time and now the game is officially

[15:05] for sale now look this is like the ninth game revealed over the last two months now here's my

[15:11] take on the puny factory it's not for me I'm not the target audience I don't think any of you are

[15:17] the target audience I think it's going after families and I think they're trying to make a game

[15:22] that's like approachable pinball and it's priced at what $6,500 and then the engraved edition is

[15:28] $7,000 so it's priced in line with the stern pro it's basically priced where entry level pinball

[15:36] is priced at will it be successful with pinheads I don't think so I really don't think so now

[15:43] Andrew told me they sold about 20% of their allotment already on day one and Dave Sanders was

[15:50] the designer of the game if you don't know Dave Sanders he was working over at highway pinball

[15:55] he was the designer for full throttle and for alien Dave is a fan of this show Dave if you're

[16:01] listening to this what's up brother and look it's a simple game I know the people who worked on it

[16:07] I think the big struggle with this game it's the same struggle with all unlicensed IP games

[16:12] how do you find buyers for this property right that's the biggest problem and you're not going

[16:17] to be able to create FOMO by saying we're only making like 120 it doesn't matter they only made

[16:24] 10 of Team Pinball is the mafia and those didn't sell so this is going to be the real challenge

[16:30] with this machine and ultimately the market will dictate whether or not it's successful now look

[16:35] here's the thing with pinball adventures I think this will be a moment where people are just observing

[16:40] what is their manufacturing like because with all of these boutiques it all comes down to the same

[16:45] thing for me how fast can you make a game how many games can you make a week how transparent are you

[16:51] with your customer base about how well you can make a pinball machine and I think most boutique

[16:56] companies have been really bad when it comes to that level of transparency so I hope pinball adventures

[17:02] at least opens the door a little bit and lets us in to see you know what their operations look like

[17:08] and how well they can make a game what's the quality like I don't think this is the theme for any of

[17:13] you I don't think this is the theme for most of you I really don't and then the question becomes

[17:18] like will they take this as a learning experience and will they be able to get a theme that will be

[17:25] attractive to the pinball community because we all know theme is the most important thing so I'm

[17:30] curious to see a month from now how many punny factories they've actually made and will they

[17:36] make the entire run they have some other themes on their website are they gonna move on to something

[17:41] else I'm not gonna slam these guys because they haven't done anything wrong to me they're not

[17:46] making anybody buy this game I just think it's gonna be a really tough sell simply because of how

[17:51] many games are out there how many games are out there with huge themes how many games are out

[17:56] there that have way more in it think about it like this game is the same price as a foo fighters pro

[18:02] I mean for 99.9% of people the conversation will just end there you know and foo fighters pro compared

[18:08] to this is just loaded in comparison so it's really hard like pinball is a really hard industry I never

[18:16] quite understand why anybody gets into pinball if you want to make money it seems really easy to

[18:23] lose money in pinball and really hard to make money all right so speaking about making money in pinball

[18:29] let's talk about the most profitable company in the history of pinball multi-morphic no I'm joking

[18:34] but here's the thing about multi-morphic so I saw this thing I was perusing the p3 thread that's how

[18:39] bored I was this morning I found myself in the p3 thread no but here's the thing there was a really

[18:46] interesting item that I saw that I haven't seen before and it was a display cabinet like shelving

[18:52] that perfectly allowed you to store your mini p3 playfield you know the upper playfield that's

[18:57] modular that goes in and out of the game this cabinet allowed you to store it really nicely

[19:03] really cleanly and then all of a sudden it's like wow now all of a sudden that looks much much much

[19:09] better than storing these things underneath the games putting them back in the cardboard box

[19:15] and it made me think Jerry where have you been on this all these years brother you should be making

[19:21] an official p3 multi-morphic display case and cabinet and sell it to your customers because

[19:29] all of a sudden now when you see like the game with weird owl and heist and like cosmic kart racing

[19:36] when you see it all together like that it's just a much more visually appealing thing to show how

[19:44] people could bring p3 into their home and I'm surprised that they never thought about this before

[19:51] and I think they should sort of harness this reality this new consumer insight and I think

[19:56] they should start making an official p3 multi-morphic display case so everybody can store their games

[20:03] remember back in the day when we used to store our NES cartridges like when we had these like book

[20:08] cases where we stored all of our NES games it's the same way if you want your platform to be like a

[20:14] video game console where everyone's storing different games then you got to give them the

[20:19] way to store the games it makes total sense all right have I covered off on everything a lot of

[20:25] new games people and I can see it already people need room in their game rooms like a lot of new

[20:30] games a lot of people are gonna have to start selling stuff and I'm looking at the pinball

[20:35] marketplace right now people and I'm just seeing man stern pinball and stern collectors I think

[20:40] the stern lees like the older ones are just gonna skyrocket they're gonna keep going up like you

[20:46] can't find a ghost buster's le anywhere can you even find a stranger things le for sale can you find

[20:52] a batman le or s le anywhere like these games are unobtainium and as all these guys open up

[20:59] their freaking like 300 thousand dollar pinball collections and their collectors those are gonna

[21:05] be the games people want I think ghost buster's le to me is gonna be the one that just keeps going to

[21:09] the moon regardless of how bad it shoots you can make some adjustments put in those a little bit

[21:14] longer flippers and add the stuff to the out lane so it doesn't hop over the rail but it's just

[21:19] a work of art I mean every time I see ghost buster's it's a freaking work of art and I mean this

[21:23] people if stern vaults that game and puts an LCD in it I mean get ready like they could super

[21:29] limited edition ghost buster's and charge 25 thousand dollars and we'd all be like fighting over

[21:34] each other to get one I know you hate me for saying this stuff people but every time I see these

[21:38] game rooms I mean how can you not think that a collector who's got like hundreds of thousands

[21:45] of dollars in machines and he wants to collect rare pinball machines that make other collectors

[21:53] envious how can you not think stern can't sell an 88 thousand dollar back to the future or a

[22:00] 30 thousand dollar ghost buster's super limited edition they could easily and they know this

[22:07] and yes I think they're eventually gonna do all this stuff but the real problem is it's not about

[22:12] the high end collector they're gonna make everything else more expensive like everyone's

[22:16] gonna be paying like 8000 for pros soon and like 12000 for premiums and 15000 for le's it's coming

[22:23] it's coming people and hopefully your kids are out of college by the time that happens because

[22:29] it's gonna get real real interesting and sometimes we see these games and I always wonder like are

[22:34] these million dollar houses or do people have almost as much money in pinball as they do in

[22:40] their housing price I mean I definitely know these people are not spending it on fashion like

[22:44] canada because they're not rocking the Gucci but anyway everybody have a great Friday I'm so happy

[22:50] each and every one of you are here we are going to do the raffle tomorrow during Saturday morning

[22:55] spectacular where I give to six people a hundred dollars each for joining the canada club today

[23:02] was the last day eligible to be a part of that but for each and every one of you who's here

[23:08] thank you so much for being a member and I'm going to do stuff for more of you who have been here
