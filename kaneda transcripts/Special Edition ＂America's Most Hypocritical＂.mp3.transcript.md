[00:00] Jerry, just remember, it's not a lie if you believe it.

[00:16] Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the second special edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:20] on these special editions.

[00:21] We are going to tackle a specific issue and from the response that we got from last week's

[00:27] Ghost Buster Special Edition, I can tell that you guys

[00:29] do like to enjoy short, quick, very specific dialogue around a topic that is somewhat controversial.

[00:38] So we're going to go at it right now and I'm talking about this time.

[00:42] No other than Mr. Wise Knows America's Most Honored and I'm calling this episode America's

[00:49] Most Hypocritical because what this guy is doing, it's so clearly hypocritical, he's

[00:58] talking at a bullseye of his face and it's not even hard, it's not even hard to pull

[01:05] his own hypocrisy out from his own statements within the past few weeks.

[01:10] Now let me start out by saying the background of this story.

[01:14] So Wise Knows has listed a new inbox America's Most Honored for sale for $9,000 and he goes

[01:21] on to say he has a new inbox America's Most Honored, he can bring it to Texas Pinball

[01:26] Festival to MGC, he wasn't really looking to sell but he has an investment opportunity

[01:32] that came up.

[01:35] So he has an investment opportunity, that's his story.

[01:37] He got this brand new and never opened it, never played it, it was stored inside his house

[01:41] in a climate controlled environment.

[01:44] Okay, brand new game, the last one he said sold for $9,000 and the buyer paid the shipping

[01:49] so his asking prices and line with that.

[01:53] Alright, so that's his story of why he's selling it.

[01:57] And that's fine, I think if he just listed this for sale and said I'm selling a new

[02:00] inbox America's Most Honored, it's $9,000, $1,000 just sold for this, I don't think people

[02:05] really would have an issue.

[02:07] Again, it's fair to ask whatever you want and if one just sold, of course you should

[02:14] price it around that.

[02:15] So he's fine there but here's the thing, there is an underlying lack of honesty in his

[02:22] approach and it is severely hypocritical.

[02:26] So let's just, I think to really understand how Hilton is his name, how wise snow is

[02:33] really purposely misleading people and speaking inconsistencies, all we have to do is go back

[02:42] and listen to what he said a month ago.

[02:45] Okay, a month ago when the other America's Most Honored went up for sale by Crazy Muffin,

[02:51] listed it a month ago for $10,000.

[02:55] One of the people that was most vocal in that thread was wise snow.

[03:00] And he, if you read his post now, considering the fact that all along, while he was commenting

[03:07] in that thread, he knew himself that he had an America's Most Honored, Sitting New

[03:13] In Box.

[03:15] It starts to make his comments in that thread seem really, really, you know, just hypocritical

[03:21] and disingenuous.

[03:23] The first thing he said when Crazy Muffin listed his pinball machine was, all things considered

[03:28] the price seems appropriate to ask.

[03:30] New In Box exclamation point, 150 made but let, latter part of the run, or later part

[03:37] of the run, super fun game, cost of premium firsthand and the whole supply and demand thing.

[03:43] Reality is that desirable fun, funny rare games are not cheap, especially when almost

[03:48] done with production and forever limited to 150 in total.

[03:51] Okay, so I mean, he's basically promoting the rarity and the fun nature of the game.

[03:58] I would say that he's almost a shill for the game, for saying that this price is worth

[04:03] 10K.

[04:04] I mean, he basically keeps articulating in the thread that he believes a $10,000 is a fair

[04:10] price.

[04:11] But of course he wants to say that because he has one new in box.

[04:17] So his agenda is quite clear that he wants to drive the price's high because he knows

[04:24] that he has one.

[04:25] But does he ever disclose that he has a second one new in box?

[04:29] Not once.

[04:30] Now that seems a little odd, doesn't it?

[04:34] Why am I, why is he shilling the machine and really justifying the price without disclosing

[04:40] the fact that it is of course of benefit to him that he has one new in box.

[04:46] And here's the part, and this podcast can be so much shorter than the one I did last

[04:51] week.

[04:52] Here's the part that I think just exposes why snows hypocrisy.

[04:57] And this hits America's most hypocritical right on the head.

[05:02] He goes on to say a month ago, okay, remember a month when he has one new in box.

[05:07] He goes on to say, I am a pinball player.

[05:10] I will say that all things comparable in the low supply and high demand game arena, I

[05:15] would take America's most honoured over cactus canyon, Tronelli, ACD CLE, he goes on to say

[05:21] cactus canyon again.

[05:22] I love how he can't even remember he said the same game two games ago and Big Bang Bar

[05:27] etc.

[05:28] So he's saying that America's most honoured, he'd rather have than a Big Bang Bar, than

[05:34] a cactus canyon, then Tronelli, then ACD CLE.

[05:37] Are you kidding me?

[05:39] All those games, all those games are far superior games than America's most honoured.

[05:44] I don't think people would argue that.

[05:46] Yes, AMH has lower numbers.

[05:48] But see, that is like such a shell there.

[05:50] He's saying that this game is better than some of the best games of all time.

[05:54] So he goes on to say, those other games are not even close to the fun factor of America's

[05:58] most honoured.

[05:59] I mean, really?

[06:00] I think almost everybody would disagree with that.

[06:03] But that's fine.

[06:04] Again, fun factor, completely subjective.

[06:06] But here's where it gets interesting.

[06:08] He's going on to say, for those that are pinball collectors, America's most honoured,

[06:12] obviously also offers the desirability of an extremely limited production run.

[06:17] I mean, he's so hung up on limited edition.

[06:19] He goes on to say, to me, if a limited game is fun and you want one, then you would better

[06:24] jump on one sooner than later, as the man has this amazing effect of decreasing supply

[06:30] and increasing cost.

[06:31] I mean, he's basically saying, a month ago, you better get this why you can because they're

[06:35] not going to last.

[06:36] You jump on it now, buy it at $10,000.

[06:39] Of course he wanted someone to buy it at $10,000, because he knew all along he had one

[06:43] waiting to go up for sale.

[06:45] He then says, America's most honoured is trending up with sales of home use only going for

[06:49] $7,200.

[06:51] New and box a few months ago for $7,700.

[06:54] And nobody really knows the future.

[06:56] Okay.

[06:57] Now, the last part of his statement here is the part that just sign seal deliver, this is

[07:04] America's most hypocritical.

[07:05] He says, I will say that I recommend anyone with one, open it up and play it.

[07:12] Let me repeat that line.

[07:13] I will say that I recommend anyone with one, open it up and play it.

[07:18] He said that a month ago to open it up and play it.

[07:22] Meanwhile, he had one new in box.

[07:25] He had it for months, new in box before he wrote that.

[07:28] Did he open it up and play it?

[07:30] No.

[07:31] And I know he has one on location, but did he open his up?

[07:34] He even let you know I have one and I haven't opened it up yet because I'm speculating on

[07:38] the price, which is what he was really doing.

[07:41] And then he writes, you may regret selling it without digging into it first.

[07:45] Likely, you won't be able to find it in the future for whatever you sell it for.

[07:49] See, what he's doing?

[07:51] He is basically saying you should open it up and play it.

[07:55] Then he says to the potential buyers, you should buy it no matter what it costs because

[07:59] you're never going to find it again.

[08:00] I mean, this whole thing is a shell and a hypocritical agenda because he knew he had one

[08:06] that he was going to sell.

[08:07] I mean, I've never seen anything so blatantly inconsistent and deceptive because he wanted

[08:14] to jack the price of his own machine up.

[08:17] And then in his thread from two days ago, he continues to say that he has an investment

[08:24] opportunity.

[08:25] Investment opportunity, right?

[08:27] Okay.

[08:28] I don't know what investment opportunity he has, but he continues to say that he's open

[08:34] to trades.

[08:35] And you're like, wait a minute.

[08:37] I thought you needed to free up cash for your investment opportunity.

[08:42] And if that, so he said he needs, he needs money for an investment opportunity.

[08:46] He also says he doesn't have a room.

[08:48] But then he also is saying, I'll take trades.

[08:50] How does that make any sense whatsoever?

[08:53] If you don't have room for another pin and that's why you're selling, why do you want,

[08:57] how can you trade?

[08:59] That doesn't solve your room issue.

[09:00] And then he also says, I'll take a trade, but how does that open up cash flow for your

[09:06] investment opportunity?

[09:08] So none of it makes sense.

[09:10] And it's really kind of sad that he can't even figure out his own story.

[09:15] And if you're going to do this, if you're going to go out here and try to make money on

[09:20] your pin, that's fine.

[09:22] Why snow, Mr. Hilton?

[09:24] He cares that you have a machine that has not now gone up in value.

[09:29] If you want to sell it for a profit, nobody cares.

[09:32] But stop lying about your reasons.

[09:35] Stop making up these fake stories to alleviate your own hypocrisy because you, sir, have also

[09:42] gone into the threads and called people out for doing what exactly you're doing.

[09:46] You've called out Tiki for doing the same thing.

[09:48] And there's nothing wrong with it.

[09:50] There's nothing wrong if you bought a game and you hold on to it.

[09:53] And all of a sudden you see the price skyrocket that you want to sell it and you want to make

[09:57] $3,000, $2,700 on your investment.

[10:02] Good.

[10:03] Everyone is like, damn, I should have gone on an AMH.

[10:06] But don't do what you're doing.

[10:08] You're constantly trying to make yourself out to be like the good guy who wouldn't do it

[10:11] because that goes against your entire belief in pinball that people should play it.

[10:15] They shouldn't flip it.

[10:16] They shouldn't think about it as an investment opportunity.

[10:19] But you're doing the same exact thing.

[10:20] So all I got to say is you should go back and re-edit your thread and just apologize

[10:25] for being such a hypocrite and stop.

[10:30] Your thing is laced with inconsistency and mistruths.

[10:34] So just go back and say, hey guys, I'm like the rest of you.

[10:39] If I can make a buck, I'll make a buck.

[10:40] And that's the honest truth.

[10:42] Now sell your pin.

[10:43] I hope you get as much as you can for it.

[10:45] But stop hiding behind this whole fake persona.

[10:48] It's not working and you look like America's most hypocritical.

[10:51] Thank you.

[10:52] Enjoy.
