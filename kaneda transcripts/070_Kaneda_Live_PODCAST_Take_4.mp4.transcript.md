[00:00] All right.

[00:07] So weird.

[00:09] All right.

[00:13] Not gonna touch anything.

[00:14] Just gonna let people come in.

[00:16] We're gonna go back to where we were.

[00:18] It's always hard when I'm, when I'm firing to remember where we were.

[00:22] Some, I must have hit something with the computer.

[00:24] It started lagging and started, it might be because I'm, because I'm recording with

[00:29] Audacity.

[00:31] And I'm here.

[00:33] That could be the issue.

[00:35] We have one person.

[00:36] No one's gonna join.

[00:37] No one's gonna join Brenda.

[00:38] It's over.

[00:39] Can't tell the show.

[00:41] Let's see.

[00:44] It's all right.

[00:48] Are you guys back?

[00:51] I don't know.

[00:52] I must have hit something on the mic.

[00:55] And you know, so we're gonna, where you gonna get right.

[00:57] I remember where I was.

[00:58] So I saved that part of the show.

[01:00] We're gonna splice it together.

[01:02] But you guys will get a sense of like how we do this.

[01:05] I'm just gonna run with it.

[01:06] Okay.

[01:07] Now, can you guys hear me?

[01:08] Okay.

[01:09] Now I just want to make sure because people said it was lagging.

[01:12] People said it wasn't, it was, it was, it was clipping or whatever.

[01:19] Is it working?

[01:21] Is it sound good?

[01:25] All right.

[01:26] Let's do this.

[01:27] Carl is streaming.

[01:32] All right.

[01:33] All right.

[01:34] So I want to ask everybody here because we're in front of a live audience ladies and gentlemen.

[01:39] How many examples of Dune Pimball?

[01:42] Do you think Arrows of Fun has sold?

[01:45] I think they said they're gonna make a thousand in total.

[01:48] Wasn't that the number?

[01:49] Because it wasn't 1100.

[01:50] I think it's 1000 examples of Dune Pimball.

[01:55] And so how many do you think were sold since the day the game was revealed?

[02:01] Because I've got a number in my head.

[02:02] I don't know.

[02:03] I could probably just ask David.

[02:04] I'm not sure anybody will tell the truth.

[02:08] But since the game's been revealed, there's been a lot of other games, right?

[02:13] It revealed right on top of King Kong.

[02:15] You've got Predator coming out today.

[02:17] You've got Harry Potter, which is gonna take the majority of Pimball sales.

[02:22] You've had Porto all that nobody really bought.

[02:24] So, all right, Owen thinks they sold 500 Dune's already.

[02:29] Owen, that's a very optimistic number.

[02:33] I don't think they sold out of half of them already.

[02:37] I would say Dune is probably sold between two to 300 out of a thousand.

[02:44] Have you seen anybody unbox the game?

[02:48] That's the big issue.

[02:49] And so now the strategy, the only strategy left to move these games because you only get

[02:56] one chance to make a first impression.

[02:58] The only strategy left now is to stream the game.

[03:03] And I just feel like streaming the game always.

[03:06] And I mean, as always, takes some of the FOMO out of wanting to own it.

[03:12] It's kind of like you see everything.

[03:14] And if Carl's gonna go through all the modes of the game and you see it, is it gonna

[03:20] make you want one?

[03:22] And again, because Pimball streaming is so lackluster just to begin with, it's literally

[03:27] not exciting.

[03:28] Like, I don't know any other way to say it.

[03:30] Like, watching someone play Pimball is not exciting.

[03:33] I think it's one of the worst sales tactics there can be.

[03:37] Now, look, you always want a little bit of gameplay before you order a game.

[03:41] But I believe one thing now.

[03:44] With where we're at in Pimball, I believe in one thing now is the only thing you need

[03:50] before you order a game.

[03:52] You yourself have to walk in front of the machine and fall in love with it to pay these

[03:58] kinds of prices.

[03:59] Because remember, Dune Fully Loaded is somewhere around like $13,000 plus $1,000 with the top

[04:05] where it's gonna be like $14,000.

[04:07] And so yeah, you gotta play it yourself.

[04:10] The days of needing to order these games right away on week one in the first month are

[04:16] over.

[04:17] So everyone needs to go find a Dune and play it.

[04:20] Now that's problematic because most people don't have access to a Dune machine.

[04:26] I don't even have one over at Automated and he carries barrels of fun machines.

[04:31] I should ask Mike when he's gonna get it.

[04:34] But I think it's gonna be a very, very slow burn for this game.

[04:38] And the big issue surrounding Dune, right, just hovering over it is this.

[04:45] You don't care about the theme.

[04:47] And because you don't care about the theme, you seeing more moments from the movie make

[04:53] their way into the game isn't going to do anything for you.

[04:59] Whereas when you see clips from the Predator movie you love, that's gonna do something

[05:05] to you.

[05:06] And you see more Harry Potter movie scenes coming to life that's gonna do something for

[05:13] you.

[05:14] And I think that's the big difference.

[05:17] I just worry that this theme much like Labyrinth, I think even more so than Labyrinth because

[05:24] people had nostalgic love for Labyrinth.

[05:30] Nobody in this demographic has a nostalgic love affair with this theme.

[05:36] And so I'm hoping that David understands that now.

[05:40] And the next title is coming out from him.

[05:44] Connect more with the pinball buying demographic.

[05:47] And I think that's gonna be important.

[05:48] I'm gonna say this right now, even without Arnold, pinball brothers will sell more predator

[05:55] machines than barrels of fun will sell of Dune pinball simply because of nostalgic love

[06:03] affair for the property.

[06:06] Okay.

[06:07] I mean that.

[06:08] All right.

[06:09] What did someone say?

[06:10] Like that predator is $19,500 in Australia.

[06:13] Look if you're in Australia and you're buying pinball machines in 2025, you just have to

[06:20] be loaded.

[06:21] Like load it.

[06:22] Like how can you guys drop this much on these games?

[06:25] I've always said this, it's cheaper to simply buy an airplane ticket and go to these

[06:30] pinball shows and get your fill versus 20 grand for one game.

[06:36] I mean, at least in your market though, the game's kind of whole value because you're

[06:40] always gonna have more demand and supply in Australia.

[06:44] All right.

[06:45] Let's talk about Harry Potter and let me get a cup of coffee here.

[06:50] See this is like I have some pauses every once in a while.

[06:55] Let's talk about Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Artificial Intelligence Artistic Layout

[07:07] Mode of the game.

[07:08] No.

[07:09] Everyone is now seeing what seems to be some clear evidence that the artwork on Harry

[07:14] Potter was using some sort of filter, whether it was an AI filter or some other filter,

[07:21] there's some weird stuff going on.

[07:24] There's weird stuff going on on the castle, on the train, on the hands.

[07:29] Like throughout this game, you can notice some things that look like they were manipulated

[07:34] by some computer program.

[07:37] And so I don't think the folks at Jersey Jack knew this happened or was happening.

[07:43] I think they just saw it at face value.

[07:47] It looks really good when you first glance at art like this.

[07:51] And that's the thing with AI art.

[07:53] It always looks really good.

[07:56] But then when you sort of look closer at it, a lot of weird stuff is happening.

[08:03] And I think this is, I feel bad for Jersey Jack.

[08:08] If that is the case, do they need to redo the artwork?

[08:13] Will this create a delay for them?

[08:16] I don't think they're really going to change it at this point.

[08:20] But who knows, right?

[08:22] If Warner Brothers catches wind of this and someone flags it for them, they might be forced

[08:28] to go back and fix some of this stuff.

[08:30] But also remember, Warner Brothers approved all of this.

[08:35] It's not like they didn't see it.

[08:38] It's not like they didn't go over it with a magnifying glass.

[08:41] Like they had every opportunity to make changes.

[08:45] Someone pointed out that the dragon with like two eyes on its left side, they filled in

[08:51] one of the eyes.

[08:52] So that's like maybe people are like, oh, they must have caught this and made a slight correction

[08:58] to it.

[08:59] But I just want to say this.

[09:01] I was talking to Brett yesterday, Brett Abbas.

[09:04] And they know what people are saying about the game.

[09:08] And not just the artwork.

[09:09] I didn't ask about the artwork, but they know that there's work to be done, that they

[09:14] need to wake up the connection between the movies, people love, and the pimpal experience,

[09:20] and they are working on it.

[09:22] And I just want to say to everybody out there, let's let them bake on it, right?

[09:27] Let's let them fix the things they know need to be fixed on the game.

[09:31] They're going to focus on this game for the next year.

[09:34] And I do think they're going to fix the problems.

[09:37] And I feel good that they know and are listening to the feedback.

[09:41] But I just want to say this, the people that annoy me the most are not the so-called stern

[09:47] army that's being blamed for pointing out the AI artwork.

[09:51] I don't believe in that.

[09:52] The people that annoy me the most are the JJP shills that have been saying this game

[09:58] is perfect out of the box.

[10:01] You know who they are and you know what they've been saying.

[10:04] And to those people, if the world operated on feedback from people like that, nothing

[10:10] would ever get better.

[10:13] Ever.

[10:14] I'm just tired of when people are trying to give constructive feedback, myself included,

[10:19] we get attacked by these like happy go lucky shills who are telling us to shut up that

[10:25] we're ragging on the game.

[10:26] And I'm like, you haven't even listened to my shows.

[10:29] I'm not ragging on Harry Potter.

[10:31] I'm giving a balanced feedback on the game.

[10:35] And the things that I want to see improved, I think we'll make this game maybe a masterpiece.

[10:40] So should I bury my feedback and just tow the, sorry, and just tow the, you know, sometimes

[10:48] they get a pop.

[10:49] So I redo it.

[10:50] Should I just tow the company line order two for one order two, one for each of my houses

[10:56] and say that everybody else has no taste.

[10:59] Like I just don't think that's a very constructive way to look at this game.

[11:03] So look, they know what needs to happen.

[11:06] Stern Pimbal knows what needs to happen with X-Men.

[11:09] Now Jack Danger put up a post that said they're working on new X-Men code coming soon and

[11:17] then he took the post down.

[11:19] Now people are speculating why is it removed?

[11:22] And I think it's because of the word soon.

[11:25] What does soon mean in the world of Pimbal?

[11:29] Does that mean in July?

[11:30] Does it mean by the fall?

[11:32] Is it sometime this year?

[11:34] And I think that's why they took it down.

[11:37] Because now you're going to have all these people expecting something soon and is soon

[11:43] two weeks.

[11:44] Who knows in the world of Pimbal?

[11:46] Now I really hope this game gets fixed as well.

[11:49] It's a great shooting game.

[11:51] It's a beautiful game.

[11:53] I think it's one of nicest, I think it's one of Stern's nicest games they've ever launched.

[11:58] I think it looks much nicer than King Kong.

[12:00] I actually find it to be a more interesting game to shoot than King Kong.

[12:06] And so I hope the code on X-Men gets to a good place.

[12:10] That's what we all should want.

[12:12] We all should be rooting for these companies every time they release a game to make a great

[12:18] game.

[12:19] Now what we shouldn't do, which is what 95% of Pimbal content creators are today, we

[12:24] shouldn't just say everything that comes out is awesome.

[12:27] Everything that comes out, I'm going to buy it.

[12:29] Everything that comes out is great.

[12:30] I'm going to review it.

[12:31] It's awesome.

[12:32] They did a good job and then I sell it like a week later.

[12:34] That literally is the vibe of so many Pimbal content creators.

[12:38] It's the greatest game ever.

[12:39] I just ordered an LE and it's never leaving my home a week later.

[12:44] It's up for sale for $3,000 less because they probably played the wholesale price on

[12:51] the game.

[12:52] I love it now.

[12:53] I love it.

[12:54] We've got now the content creators now are letting us know if they paid in full for the

[12:58] product or they paid out of their own money for it.

[13:00] Look, I get it gang.

[13:02] Look, take the perks if you get them.

[13:05] If you get the perks, just let us know you got the hook up.

[13:10] If I treat people like I did last night, if I treat people to dinner, I don't mind it

[13:15] if they say, hey, Chris took me out to dinner.

[13:18] It doesn't make them love me any lesser anymore.

[13:21] It probably makes them love me a little bit more.

[13:24] I got a guy like Canada, right?

[13:26] I got to buy my friends.

[13:27] You know how I wrote through his world.

[13:29] I'm just joking.

[13:30] Am I maybe not Brenda?

[13:31] What do you think?

[13:32] She's upstairs.

[13:33] She can confirm yes or no.

[13:35] Have I had?

[13:36] Have I had to use the almighty dog to make people like me.

[13:40] I don't think so.

[13:41] I think if I was broke and I was on an island and all I had was a mic.

[13:46] I'd be dropping this heat every week for you guys and you'd still subscribe to Canada's

[13:51] pinball podcast.

[13:52] Everybody comes back.

[13:53] We lose people every month.

[13:55] You know, the same people that cancel always come back because where they get the money

[13:59] going to go.

[14:00] Where are they going to go?

[14:01] All right.

[14:02] So is King Kong dead?

[14:03] Is there like a second life for King Kong or is it over?

[14:06] My thing on Kong is this.

[14:09] It's just not enough.

[14:11] It's just not enough to excite people.

[14:14] I get it shoots great.

[14:15] There's just something about the unlicensed Kong.

[14:18] There's something about the art all looking the same.

[14:22] There's just something about this game.

[14:24] The quality is not great.

[14:26] Kong's arms are falling off.

[14:28] You've got to buy some dudes mod so the Vuck doesn't shake.

[14:33] Really?

[14:34] For $13,000, I have to know.

[14:36] I have to now go buy a bracket from a dude who's making them.

[14:43] Really for $13,000, Stern hasn't fixed it yet.

[14:46] And I'm just saying.

[14:48] I'm just saying.

[14:49] I don't know.

[14:50] I just feel like Kong isn't enough to want it right now because I also think everyone's

[14:55] just so much smarter now is you know if you really want to Kong, the code's not done.

[15:03] You wait six months.

[15:04] Kong Ali's 10.

[15:06] Kong Premium 7500 and a Kong Pro is five.

[15:10] That's the way it's all going.

[15:14] If Jaws 50th comes out in two days, I don't know.

[15:18] I haven't heard anything.

[15:19] I haven't heard a scheduled meeting with Distros.

[15:21] I kind of feel like it's not happening.

[15:24] But if it does happen and Jaws 50th comes out, then what's going to happen to all those

[15:29] Jaws, Elise, they're going to go down.

[15:31] Everything's going down.

[15:32] Everything's headed south.

[15:33] It's fine.

[15:34] That's why you should buy games you love.

[15:35] You should buy games you love.

[15:37] Brian is trying to give me coffee right now.

[15:38] We're live, baby.

[15:39] 60 people.

[15:40] 60 people.

[15:41] I hope you're all subscribers.

[15:43] If you're a subscriber, you get to see now how can Ada does the show live.

[15:47] All right.

[15:48] So we've got Kong.

[15:50] The next game might be Jaws 50th.

[15:52] Then we've got John Borg, Star Wars Episode 1, 2, and 3, Darth Maul, baby, pod racing, baby.

[16:03] Guado is a Guado.

[16:04] Guado.

[16:05] Who's what's his name?

[16:06] The blue dude with the wings.

[16:07] Guado?

[16:08] I don't know.

[16:09] I forget his name.

[16:10] And you somehow you know, somehow you know, Annie.

[16:12] Meta-chlorious edition.

[16:15] What is going to happen?

[16:16] Are we going to go back?

[16:17] Are we going to go back to Episode 1 through 3 and the main guy, baby, Jar Jar Binks.

[16:24] They need to make a Jar Jar Binks super limited edition.

[16:30] Misa want that version.

[16:33] Misa want that version.

[16:34] Stern using a Vega do do Jar Jar.

[16:37] Look, I think these movies since Star Wars has had so many bad TV shows.

[16:42] I think everyone's looking back on Episode 1 through 3 with a lot more fondness than they

[16:49] used to.

[16:50] I mean, Hayden Kricensen now goes to the Star Wars conventions and he's like treat it like

[16:54] a celebrity.

[16:55] They go nuts when they see him.

[16:58] And so look, it's Star Wars.

[17:00] When that theme song hits, if John Borg makes a great game, it's going to sell.

[17:06] If you want to go up against Harry Potter, it's a good one to punch to hit back with Star

[17:12] Wars and Pokemon.

[17:15] And maybe Tron, the one game they better not make.

[17:19] And you know what it is.

[17:20] They better not make a remastered like comic version of the Walking Dead.

[17:26] Nobody wants another run of Walking Dead.

[17:31] That's not the game.

[17:32] It's Tron and then it's Lord of the Rings.

[17:37] Those are the two games.

[17:39] Everybody wants another run up.

[17:42] It's not Walking Dead Stern.

[17:45] And then Stern, you really need to get more great themes going.

[17:51] You don't have enough of the nostalgic stuff we want.

[17:56] I still can't believe we're not going to get back to the future from Stern.

[18:00] By the way, everybody, if you're following how slow Dutch Pimbal is making Alice's adventures

[18:08] in Wonderland.

[18:10] How the heck is this company going to make back to the future?

[18:16] How?

[18:17] Like what happens when they get 5,000 orders and they're making 20 games a week?

[18:24] What happens?

[18:25] How are they ever going to fulfill orders?

[18:27] 20 games a week at best.

[18:29] I think it's like 10 games a week.

[18:31] I don't think they can make even 500 games a year.

[18:35] And so what's going to happen when they try to manufacture back to the future?

[18:39] If Barry should have done, he should have inked the deal with either Stern or like JjP.

[18:46] They both wanted it.

[18:47] The thing is, is like, I know Barry wanted like a lot up front.

[18:52] You didn't want to wait for the money.

[18:53] If I were Barry, I would have taken the long payout.

[18:58] I would have said, look, we'll do the deal.

[19:01] I want 500 bucks per game sold.

[19:04] And I would have taken a plane to the Caribbean and sat on a beach and collect checks for the

[19:12] next five years.

[19:14] And I'm talking people, millions of dollars.

[19:17] We're not talking a few hundred thousand dollars here.

[19:20] I'm talking millions of dollars he would have made over the duration of that game's manufacturing.

[19:29] And I also would have said part of the deal is don't cap this game.

[19:35] Make 88 SLEs, make another L.E.

[19:38] But then the premium unlimited runs, they would never stop selling it.

[19:44] And it was going to be made by Keith L.

[19:46] Win.

[19:47] And if it was over at Jersey Jack, it would have been like Richie and Eric or somebody.

[19:51] And they would have done it justice.

[19:53] And they've got Joe Kay getting all the assets Bob Gale.

[19:57] Like he could have like just made himself set.

[20:02] And also we know this Dutch one game, one game in 12 years.

[20:09] So I'm worried.

[20:10] I'm worried because again, I just don't feel like they're going to be able to handle the demand.

[20:16] And you know, sometimes in life, you got to know your limitations.

[20:19] We all have to.

[20:21] That's what guides us in our professional careers.

[20:23] Like you just got to know what you're good at and what you need help with.

[20:27] And they're not good at manufacturing.

[20:30] It's just not their strong suit.

[20:31] They just one game in 12 years.

[20:34] You are not a manufacturing company.

[20:36] You've made one game in 12 years.

[20:39] And so we'll see what happens there.

[20:41] I mean, that's not happening anytime soon.

[20:43] We really can use Alice as a marker to see how they're doing.

[20:48] And it's not flying out the door.

[20:50] It really isn't.

[20:51] So today, predator, it's coming.

[20:54] It's coming.

[20:55] It's going to be out in like what, like three hours, six hours.

[20:59] We will see predator.

[21:01] All the teases are over.

[21:03] I'm going to get this show up.

[21:05] Everybody.

[21:06] Thank you for hanging out and watching a live recording of how Canada does Canadian Spinball

[21:11] Podcast.

[21:12] You can see how I have to edit a little bit here and there.

[21:15] But I love doing this show.

[21:16] And if you're not a member of Canada Spinball Podcast, please join the show.

[21:21] It's only $5 a month.

[21:22] And if you join today, it unlocks for you.

[21:25] I think something like 500 episodes are now on Patreon that you can go back and listen

[21:33] to.

[21:34] So you get a lot.

[21:35] You also get access to the chat on Patreon, which is so much fun.

[21:41] Every hour of every day, those who are members can test to this every hour of every day.

[21:47] If you ever just want to hang out and chat, pinball, people are there.

[21:51] It's a lot of fun.

[21:52] All right.

[21:53] So I hope you guys join and you become a, and you become a member of Canada Spinball Podcast.

[21:58] Everybody get to the chop of today.

[22:00] We'll be back here at 250 PM to see what this game is all about.

[22:06] Going to have a lot of feelings on it.

[22:08] We know Arnold's not in it.

[22:10] And that's going to manage our expectations, right?

[22:13] Because we know we are in it now.

[22:14] So I'm not going to like get like devastated by it because I know it.

[22:18] I wish they would have said it.

[22:19] Maybe he's got call outs.

[22:21] We shall see.

[22:22] Everybody have a great Wednesday and we'll be back later today.

[22:26] Canada out.

[22:27] All right.

[22:28] So you see how it's done.

[22:31] You see how it's done.

[22:32] It's not scripted.

[22:33] I don't know what I'm going to say next, which you probably get by now.

[22:41] But it's fun.

[22:42] It's like my creative outlet that his, this is why I don't want to be in the manufacturers

[22:51] back pockets.

[22:52] I don't, unless I took a job in the marketing department at a pinball company, which if,

[22:57] you know, if it was like the right job and the money was right, I'd consider it.

[23:02] I'm not going to lie to you.

[23:03] Of course, I would consider it.

[23:06] But unless it was something worth it like that, giving up the freedom to speak freely

[23:12] on my show, nothing would be worth it.

[23:15] Like a $15,000 pinball machine would not be worth it.

[23:19] Getting trips to shows or trips to see, you know, manufacturing behind the scenes, I,

[23:25] it's not worth it to me to then not be able to speak freely.

[23:30] This is, this is creativity and freedom are worth way more to me than, you know, discounts

[23:38] or free, free stuff.

[23:39] It's just the way I've always rolled.

[23:41] And in the end, it all worked out for me because where other people have to give so much

[23:45] free stuff away to sort of entice their community to join, I just do this.

[23:51] That's it.

[23:52] You don't get, I'm not giving you anything.

[23:53] There's no extra perks.

[23:55] You just get the most entertaining pinball podcasts I believe on the planet.

[23:59] And the numbers don't lie.

[24:00] Like the numbers don't lie.

[24:01] We have more subscribers.

[24:03] There's more subscribers to Canadian pinball podcasts than every single other pinball content

[24:09] creator combined when it comes to subscriptions.

[24:13] I'm proud of that.

[24:14] It's also a pathetically low number, like 600, like, you know what I'm saying?

[24:18] Like, if I was doing video games or cars, like, yeah, like literally, it would be my

[24:22] job.

[24:23] Like to be a nano, nano, nano influencer in pinball doesn't pay out for anybody.

[24:29] Okay.

[24:30] Remember, I always remember that.

[24:31] Like one distro is going to make more money selling Harry Potter's in one day than I'll

[24:34] make all year doing this show.

[24:37] Who's doing more work?

[24:38] I'm going to think about it.

[24:39] Okay.

[24:40] Everybody, love you.

[24:41] Bye.
