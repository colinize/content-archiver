[00:00] Somebody just sent Kaneda video of Guns & Roses Jersey Jack Pimball's game coming out.

[00:06] And I'm looking at this thing right now and I'm here to tell you right now, right now.

[00:10] This is the game that I've been waiting for since I got into Pimball like 5 plus years.

[00:15] This game is gonna rock so hard.

[00:18] Eric Minier, you son of a BITCH, you just did something that we've all been waiting for.

[00:25] We knew it was in you.

[00:26] We weren't sure if you're soft more effort would be as good as your first effort.

[00:31] But let me tell you people, when you see this game and you see this game in action,

[00:36] it is gonna blow you the Apple Web.

[00:38] And I mean it.

[00:39] And I'm not here to tell you this mech, that mech, no.

[00:41] It's an overall Pimball world under glass experience.

[00:45] And I'm here to tell you right now too.

[00:47] The thing you're just gonna blow you away, not just the layout, not just everything that Eric put into this game.

[00:53] This game has the coolest light show I've ever seen in Pimball.

[00:58] I mean beyond anything else I've ever seen in Pimball.

[01:01] And if you think that Rick and Morty or TNA has a light show,

[01:04] you haven't seen anything yet, anything yet.

[01:08] And to see it in motion, to see it all together today, it's just blowing me away.

[01:13] And the only question I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna confirm to you right now.

[01:16] You are gonna see Band Footage up there on that big screen.

[01:20] You're gonna see Slash and the members of G&R play your favorite hit.

[01:23] I mean it is gonna be a, I literally could just drive to Chicago now

[01:30] with my $13,000 in cash and just hand it to Eric Minier and say, just take this.

[01:38] Like keep the change brother.

[01:40] You just made a game that's about to blow everybody away.

[01:44] And this is what Pimball should be.

[01:46] This isn't no Pimball.

[01:47] This isn't no Pimpod.

[01:49] This isn't no stupid peripheral technology.

[01:52] This is what we've always wanted in Pimball.

[01:55] We wanted the passion.

[01:56] We wanted the enthusiasm to go into the game.

[01:59] And let me tell you something, for those of you out there who are not Guns and Roses fans,

[02:03] it doesn't matter.

[02:04] You're gonna own this pin.

[02:06] You're gonna want this pin.

[02:07] You can't even be into Pimball and dismiss this pin.

[02:11] I mean it's that cool.

[02:13] It's that cool.

[02:13] And I'm thinking to myself, oh, can I add, is this compared to like Metallica or ACDC or Aerospace?

[02:19] I'm telling you right now, you can't even put those games in the same sentence as this

[02:25] pin.

[02:26] This is what we've always wanted.

[02:28] We wanted Valley Williams kinds of games in the modern time with modern stuff.

[02:33] And now you're gonna have to get it.

[02:36] You're gonna get it in space.

[02:39] And it's gonna be the first cool Jersey Jack Timball machine.

[02:41] I mean, seriously, this game, I just, I'm looking at the light show again and I'm just,

[02:45] I don't understand.

[02:47] Like there's things lighting up that I've never seen light up before in a Pimball machine.

[02:51] And it's just that freaking cool.

[02:54] And the layout, the next arm with the artwork on top of it because before this I saw the

[02:58] white wood.

[02:59] I didn't get to see the game in motion and I'm telling you right now, this is it people.

[03:04] Get your money ready.

[03:06] Cancel your orders of other stuff.

[03:09] I can't.

[03:10] I mean, a friend of this is the last game we'll get.

[03:12] This is if the last game I'm playing at Earth is this.

[03:14] I love it.

[03:15] The, the, the, the, the golf it has been dropped.

[03:17] This man, Eric Minier, you're the new king.

[03:20] You're the new king and you're all gonna see it.

[03:22] You're gonna see it.

[03:23] I mean, you're gonna have to wait to Monday, but I'm telling you right now, right now.

[03:26] You ain't never seen a game like this.

[03:28] You're all gonna want it.

[03:29] And then you're gonna be like, can you do it right?

[03:31] You were right.

[03:32] You were wrong on Wampa, but you're right here.

[03:34] Guns and acting, bro, I'm just serious.

[03:36] I'm curious, you can't take Timball.

[03:37] You're paying me.

[03:38] So hype this game.

[03:39] I mean, we saw the other side of the play field, but you ain't seen nothing yet.

[03:42] Why did I flip this thing over?

[03:44] And you see a plane's gonna blow your up the mind.

[03:46] DNF and R. You got my money.

[03:48] You got everything going, Eric.

[03:49] You're the new king and town brother.

[03:51] Later.
