[00:00] You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life.

[00:04] The facts of life, there's a time you gotta go and show you growing now you know about the facts of life.

[00:11] The facts of life!

[00:13] SINNA SINNA SINNA SINNA SINNA SINNA SINNA SINNA

[00:16] I love that line.

[00:18] There's a time you've gotta go and show you've grown.

[00:22] Because that's the facts of life.

[00:24] And let's apply that to Pimball on Episode 350 of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[00:30] Wow, we've made it 350 episodes.

[00:33] Unbelievable.

[00:34] We don't have anything special here other than another great episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[00:39] Now when we talk about the facts of Pimball, that's what I want to talk about on this episode.

[00:44] There's just things that we all know to be true.

[00:47] We might wish it to be different.

[00:49] But there comes a time when we have to accept reality.

[00:52] And I think the ultimate reality in all of Pimball is that making Pimball is not easy.

[00:58] And it's something that we talk about all the time.

[01:01] Every time there's a new manufacturer, we wonder, will it be different this time?

[01:06] Will they make games quickly?

[01:08] Will they ship games close to reveal?

[01:11] Will they get manufacturing down?

[01:13] Right? All this stuff.

[01:15] Will they bring back Pimball, Magic to Pimball?

[01:17] The fact of the matter is this.

[01:19] The majority of Pimball companies.

[01:21] These are facts.

[01:23] The majority of new Pimball companies have failed.

[01:26] They fail to deliver on their promises.

[01:29] They fail the ship games on time.

[01:32] They fail to hold up their end of the bargain.

[01:35] And a lot of those failures have led many people to lose their love of the hobby.

[01:41] It's caused many people to be frustrated and to spend years wondering if they're ever going to get what they pay for.

[01:49] Now, deep root Pimball, the facts of life.

[01:53] They told us all these things they were going to do in 2019.

[01:57] And it's clear now that there are delays.

[02:00] And that's another fact about Pimball is that delays will happen.

[02:04] And delays will occur in areas in which you probably least expect it.

[02:09] Now Robert Mueller responded yesterday.

[02:11] And I want to read what he wrote on Pinside because whenever he chimes in,

[02:16] he does always get a lot of upvotes.

[02:18] He has 22 upvotes and only one downvote.

[02:22] Wow, I don't know how you downvote this post, but let me read you what Robert wrote.

[02:25] He said, I can't believe I have to remind users here on Pinside or listeners of podcasts

[02:33] to assume anything posted or disseminated as fact by anyone other than me personally

[02:40] is guaranteed to be nothing more than unsubstantiated speculation.

[02:46] Well, let me stop right there.

[02:48] So I love Robert.

[02:49] I love this arrogance.

[02:52] You have to say that this is a crazy arrogance statement that facts by anyone other than

[02:59] Robert are not facts.

[03:01] Now, ironically, I titled this show Facts of Life before even reading this whole thing.

[03:06] But the fact of the matter is this, if Robert wants to say that all of the facts will be disseminated by him,

[03:14] then what about all of those facts he gave us about 2019 and deep root pinball, right?

[03:20] Most games ever released by any manufacturer in a year.

[03:23] Everyone's going to get their games within two weeks.

[03:25] Everyone's going to see their games by June 30th.

[03:27] Like those are the facts by which he said we should believe in.

[03:32] Okay, he then goes on to say letters went out to a few Zidware customers that said nothing

[03:39] more than paraphrasing.

[03:42] Get in the contract sent to you last year by May 31st or else your claim will be denied.

[03:50] We plan to make a statement on or about June 1st regarding Zidware claims.

[03:55] A statement will also be made as to the launch date of deep root.

[04:00] A date we've spent a lot of time ensuring will be met.

[04:05] Here's the best part.

[04:06] We'll be met this time.

[04:07] Okay.

[04:08] So this time it's for real.

[04:10] Last time it wasn't accurate, but this time we're going to get it right.

[04:16] He then goes on to say and I get a shout out.

[04:18] He says lastly, I agree with Canada that it is not fair that people are holding money back

[04:23] from making other purchases pinball or otherwise expecting us to imminently launch.

[04:30] We won't be.

[04:31] I've said two things from the beginning.

[04:34] Pinball is easy.

[04:35] Everything that goes into making pinball is not.

[04:38] We will launch when we are ready and no sooner and that gets 22 upvotes and one downvote.

[04:45] Okay.

[04:46] So is Robert confirming for us that launch is not imminent.

[04:51] So now we can I think say with certainty that June 30th is not going to be a date in

[04:59] which we see deep root games end up in people's homes.

[05:03] Okay.

[05:04] Now the sort of the target is shifting again.

[05:06] Now it's about if you have a Zidware claim, you need to make your claim by June 1st or

[05:11] you forfeited.

[05:13] But the whole thing to me starts to feel a little wonky and now I'm not talking about

[05:18] Willie wonky.

[05:19] I'm talking about this.

[05:21] I'm talking about you had a contract with people.

[05:24] You promised a date by which they would have their games.

[05:27] You clearly sound like you're not going to deliver the games by then.

[05:31] Okay.

[05:32] So.

[05:34] So then what happens now?

[05:36] Wait, this becomes another guessing game by people.

[05:40] And for those of you out there in the pinball world, are you not tired of guessing when

[05:45] these new companies are actually going to deliver what they say?

[05:49] And it's not just Robert.

[05:51] We've seen this so many times before in which people are left wondering what's happening.

[05:57] Now look, the reason why this gets 22 upvotes and one downvote is nobody has pre-ordered

[06:05] a game by deep root and nobody was expecting shipment by June 30th.

[06:10] If Robert had taken consumer money and taken pre-orders, that comment would be the complete

[06:17] opposite.

[06:18] He'd have 22 downvotes and one upvote.

[06:21] So that's where we're at.

[06:24] And he's smart.

[06:25] He's smart.

[06:26] He took investor money.

[06:27] This is how it's supposed to be.

[06:28] I think everybody woke up to the reality of the customer is not also the investor when

[06:33] you're starting a business.

[06:36] You can't do pinball with some kickstarter fashion.

[06:39] So Robert realized that and he got external money to fund the company.

[06:45] So if shipping is not imminent, then when is deep root going to show themselves to the

[06:50] world?

[06:51] Is it going to be expo?

[06:52] Is it going to be Tpf next year?

[06:54] How can they keep going all these months?

[06:57] Burning all this money and then expect to sell games around $5,000.

[07:03] Now maybe $5,000 isn't the price.

[07:05] Maybe that's just the credit by which the zidware customer is given.

[07:10] And that's not what the games are going to cost.

[07:12] I don't know.

[07:13] The whole thing, the whole thing, leads me to believe that maybe we should just all go

[07:19] quiet, stop talking about deep root and just wait until they say something.

[07:24] Because there's nothing really left to speculate now, right?

[07:27] I mean, all we know is that only Robert has the facts according to Robert.

[07:32] And we have to wait for him to disseminate the facts and anything you hear on a podcast

[07:36] like this one isn't a fact because it didn't come from Robert.

[07:40] So let's leave it at that.

[07:42] And I think deep root content is going to, I don't know, part of me, if I'm going to

[07:47] be completely blunt with everybody, blowing by these deadlines and missing the mark shows

[07:53] me one thing.

[07:54] It shows me they did not know exactly what it would take to do what they said they were

[08:00] going to do.

[08:02] And it really makes me wonder why they ever even spoke at expo and why they spoke at

[08:07] Comic Con.

[08:08] And I think they're biting off probably a little bit more than they can chew.

[08:13] And now they're trying to scramble to realize like, well, 12 whitewoods, like maybe just

[08:18] two or three is good enough.

[08:20] All right.

[08:21] So we'll see though.

[08:22] I, again, I don't, this is like, I'm reviewing a blank movie, right?

[08:26] I'm, I'm listening to a song on mute.

[08:28] I don't, I don't have anything else to give you.

[08:30] I wish I did, but we can still spend the time talking about the other Pimball companies

[08:35] that are actually putting real stuff in boxes.

[08:38] So let's go on to something else.

[08:40] Let's talk about the Ghostbusters code, which is now 28 months.

[08:45] People have been waiting since Stern Pimball themselves said they would update the Ghostbusters

[08:51] code.

[08:52] And there are a lot of people who own Ghostbusters, who are really frustrated.

[08:58] And there are a lot of people who own Ghostbusters who don't care.

[09:01] I do think there's a little bit of a civil war happening between Ghostbusters owners.

[09:06] But I do know this.

[09:08] Stern said they would update the code and Dwight hasn't touched it.

[09:12] Now, it's leading people to ask a very simple question.

[09:16] What is Dwight's issue with finishing code?

[09:20] And does he have an attitude of when I consider it done, it's done.

[09:24] And even if there is stuff missing from a game, or even if there are bugs, I don't care.

[09:29] I've moved on.

[09:30] I'm on the next project.

[09:31] Take it for what it is and we're on to the next.

[09:34] Does it also indicate that Stern Pimball is a company that's run by investors?

[09:39] And why would they invest current resources in a game that's already sold thousands of

[09:45] units?

[09:46] You're not going to sell any more Ghostbusters now at this point, right?

[09:50] Everyone who has one has one.

[09:51] The reason why they know that they won't see any new Ghostbusters dollars is quite simple.

[09:57] Is look at the resale value of Ghostbusters.

[09:59] You can now get one for one to $2,000 less than they were new.

[10:05] So why would Stern, and Stern's not going to see that money if they make the code better

[10:09] and the game improves?

[10:10] So we're at the point now where financially are the investors like, no, Dwight, you're

[10:15] on monsters right now and the next game.

[10:17] You're not looking back.

[10:18] We don't look back.

[10:19] Now what I don't understand is this.

[10:21] I believe Stern hired a lot of new programmers, right?

[10:25] We've got Tim Sexton coding, but we have we have other programmers they've hired.

[10:30] Why aren't those people looking back at games like Ghostbusters and applying their efforts

[10:35] to it and just finishing it?

[10:37] And I'm just going to say this, I bet some of these new coders probably are better than

[10:42] Dwight.

[10:44] And I don't mean that to be negative towards Dwight, but Dwight is now at the bottom.

[10:49] Not the bottom of people's favorite when it comes to coders.

[10:53] And I think people are also realizing more than ever.

[10:56] And I think the coder now, when it comes to Stern games, whoever's coding it is most important.

[11:02] Almost more than the designer.

[11:04] And that speaks to where Stern is as a pinball company these days because you're never

[11:08] going to get like some radically crazy design or some radical mechanism.

[11:13] But the code is the only hope you have of the game being great.

[11:17] It really is because you're going to get cookie cutter layouts.

[11:20] So then you want to make sure you get code that's great.

[11:23] And I think the census is up on monsters.

[11:26] The code is not great.

[11:27] The objective of the game is kind of strange.

[11:30] It's all about canceling jackpots.

[11:32] But what really bums me out about monsters and I read this from people, the show you love,

[11:37] the show you love is not coming through in the code.

[11:39] It's just not.

[11:41] It does not follow the same kind of amazing path the way Batman does.

[11:45] But I think Batman 66 set the bar for how people want to see like a classic TV show

[11:52] integrated into a pinball machine.

[11:54] And I think monsters falls very, very short of that.

[11:58] And Lyman is just the all star over at Stern.

[12:02] Like there are many people me included the only Stern games I would buy are games that are

[12:08] coded by Lyman sheets.

[12:09] He's just that much better than everybody else.

[12:12] And he takes the time.

[12:13] Now that's the other part is, well, it takes Lyman years though to get it right.

[12:18] I mean, two years to get Batman where it's at.

[12:21] And there's new Batman code coming.

[12:23] How incredible is that?

[12:25] I'm super excited because now it's where like the amazing Lyman polish happens.

[12:29] The icing on the already delicious cake.

[12:32] And this is where Lyman is going to take a game like Batman and take it to an even higher

[12:37] level.

[12:38] Now, I can I kept my Batman 66 for now.

[12:41] I'm going to talk a little bit about why I did that.

[12:43] It has something to do with Willy Wonka and when I think it's shipping.

[12:46] But my Batman 66 SLE, I still have it.

[12:49] If you are interested in one, I would consider an offer.

[12:52] I had a guy on the line who's ready to buy it.

[12:54] He got impatient and bought another one.

[12:56] And I told him, I'm like, well, what'd you pay for?

[12:58] He's like, he won't tell me, which leads me to believe he was probably going to pay what

[13:01] he offered me, which was 18,000.

[13:04] But what he doesn't realize is he bought a game with absolutely nothing in it.

[13:08] So good luck on the journey now trying to put, you have to put almost $2,000 in mods

[13:13] to make it look the way mine does.

[13:16] But that's what pinball collectors are like, man, they're impatient.

[13:18] This guy also ran and bought a woe nelly right away.

[13:20] And he's like, what do you think a woe nelly?

[13:22] I'm like, I think the game sucks.

[13:23] He's like, well, I just bought one.

[13:24] I'm like, why?

[13:26] I love some of these rich collectors.

[13:28] They don't even like, they don't even research.

[13:31] Like if a game is good or not, if they like it or not, if it just looks pretty, they buy

[13:35] it.

[13:36] All right.

[13:37] So how well do you think black knight is selling?

[13:41] All right.

[13:42] But before I talk about that, I want to talk about how awesome it was that Steve Richie chimed

[13:47] in on three issues the game was having and gave people how to solve the issues.

[13:53] There was one on the right rail.

[13:55] If there was a screw sticking up a little bit, the ball would pop off the rail.

[13:59] He gave a fix for that, a fix for like the shield issue with the spring and one other

[14:04] thing.

[14:05] And I just thought it was really cool.

[14:06] I liked also that he talked about how the game is supposed to be set up at a certain

[14:10] level.

[14:11] And if you make it steeper than the game was designed to be, you're going to remove

[14:16] a lot of the back and forth or left and right action of the ball, which is what the game

[14:20] was designed for.

[14:22] And you're also making it easier to trap the ball because I guess when you make it steeper

[14:26] to, there's more time to react to the ball coming down.

[14:29] Is that, does that make me make sense?

[14:31] It's like the distance of a play field can't get bigger because it's steeper.

[14:35] But I thought that was really cool that a designer chimes in and says, Hey, we designed

[14:39] it to be like this.

[14:40] But look, once you own the game, you can set it up any way you want.

[14:44] But how well do we think Black Knight is selling?

[14:47] We don't know.

[14:48] We never know with stern games, but I have to assume that Black Knight is really not selling

[14:54] very well.

[14:55] And I think there's a few reasons for that.

[14:57] I do think the game is pretty barren.

[15:00] I think when you walk up to it, there's not much in it.

[15:02] It's hard to look over a Black Knight and be like, Yeah, take my money now.

[15:06] Look at all the stuff they put into this game.

[15:08] It's also a theme that a lot of people just don't care about.

[15:12] Unless you grew up with the Black Knight series, I don't really think this is a game that

[15:17] has a built-in audience that's very large.

[15:20] I also think stern got arrogant.

[15:23] I think they got arrogant on the number of alleys because I think stern is smart.

[15:26] I think they use the alleys as the lead duck in the sales team.

[15:34] If you think about all of stern models that they're flying out into the world, the alleys

[15:40] sets the tone for how they want to create the demand for the game.

[15:45] I think by saying they were making 600 Black Knight alleys, I think they showed their

[15:50] cards to be.

[15:53] It's like they went in and they had a pair of two and a three and they went all in on 600

[15:59] alleys.

[16:00] I think that was just a silly move.

[16:01] I think people are like, I don't need to rush to buy this and I'll just wait and this

[16:05] game is going to be available forever.

[16:07] It still is.

[16:09] When a stern alleys does not sell out immediately, it usually means that the game is not in super

[16:16] high demand because they're the only company.

[16:19] Think about it that puts games out in volume quickly after reveal and there are way more

[16:25] than five or six hundred hard core pinball collectors in the world.

[16:30] At the game is a home run.

[16:31] Those get gobbled up really quickly.

[16:34] I mean, stern sold every monster's alleys right away.

[16:37] They sold all of them right away.

[16:39] We're now starting to see monsters alleys for sale for like $8,000.

[16:44] I think again, it just goes to show that people bought monsters just because they saw how

[16:49] sexy it looked.

[16:51] Now they're realizing it's not a game they want to keep.

[16:55] But black knight, alleys, no way.

[16:57] They're selling 600 of them.

[16:59] Then in general, there's just not much in the game.

[17:02] I think that's going to keep this title from selling very well.

[17:05] I think that will lead stern to show us their next title pretty soon because this game

[17:10] is not going to be flying off the line for a very long time.

[17:14] Alright, so what else do I want to talk about?

[17:16] There's still no Star Wars topper.

[17:19] The embarrassment level of that continues to get better and better every May 4th we pass.

[17:25] It's been what?

[17:26] Now two years since Star Wars has been out almost, I think it's two years in July and still

[17:30] no topper.

[17:31] I mean, who's over at the topper department at stern that just should get fired for this?

[17:35] But isn't stern so delinquent on all their toppers?

[17:38] Think about it.

[17:39] Where's the monster's topper?

[17:40] We know it's like the cuckoo clock.

[17:41] We saw the promo of it or the prototype of it, but that's not out still.

[17:46] I don't understand why they can't get the toppers and the games lined up on launch.

[17:51] It just, it makes absolutely no sense.

[17:55] We used to get, sometimes we used to get the topper with the game.

[17:58] Now you get nothing.

[18:00] It's a revenue driver, but it just makes no sense to me that the toppers are always delayed

[18:05] by months.

[18:06] Alright.

[18:07] Alright.

[18:08] What else is going on?

[18:09] Let's sell off, tomatic entertainment, a Brazilian distribution company.

[18:14] I don't know.

[18:15] You know, there's a lot of rumors about this happening.

[18:18] Some people are saying this is significant that if stern sold off tomatic entertainment,

[18:22] then Gary is just a figurehead and things are going to change at stern.

[18:26] Let me tell you something.

[18:27] Stern was acquired by investors.

[18:28] I think it was like 2007, 2008.

[18:31] Gary's been just a figurehead for the company forever for like over 10 years now.

[18:37] So if you think Gary Stern is calling the shots over at Stern Pimball, you're wrong.

[18:41] I mean, he's, of course, he's still as say, but this company is driven by investors.

[18:46] And so if they were to sell at the peak, like right now, I think it's a smart move.

[18:52] Think about it.

[18:53] If you're Gomez and Gary, you know this is not going to last forever.

[18:56] Like this Pimball manufacturing business is at its last moment of peaking.

[19:02] It is.

[19:03] And you know this is, this gravy train's not going to last forever.

[19:05] You want to sell your company when your books look the best.

[19:09] And right now, Stern books look the best.

[19:11] They are making the most profit they've ever made.

[19:14] The games are going out across the world.

[19:16] They have more buyers, more distributors, more countries that are acquiring Stern machines.

[19:21] The volumes are probably are increasing each year.

[19:25] Now's a good time to sell.

[19:26] Now's when you sell when the market is hot.

[19:28] You don't sell when the market cools down.

[19:30] So I wouldn't be surprised if Stern Pimball has sold.

[19:32] But I also don't think that will change anything, anything.

[19:35] Because I think Stern is already driven by investors who are cutting so many corners

[19:39] when it comes to putting stuff in these games.

[19:41] They're not going to change the thing.

[19:43] They're going to keep charging you $9,000 for $3,000 machines.

[19:47] And we're going to keep repeating that on this podcast because it never gets old.

[19:50] All right.

[19:51] So here's why I still have my Batman 66 SLE.

[19:55] Because as you know, I'm buying a Willy Wonka collector's edition.

[19:59] Now, here's what I'm hearing.

[20:01] And people have asked people at JJP.

[20:03] I'll send an email to Jack.

[20:05] But I'm hearing the collector's editions of Willy Wonka will not come out until the fall.

[20:11] So we're looking at September, October for the collector's editions.

[20:16] And this is another fact of Pimball.

[20:18] And this is probably the ultimate fact of Pimball that I don't understand why manufacturers

[20:23] can't get this right.

[20:25] You sell your most expensive version of your machine.

[20:29] You sell it first.

[20:32] It makes no sense to sell the collector's editions of Willy Wonka at the end of the run

[20:40] in year one.

[20:42] Right.

[20:43] Jack is doing the complete opposite of what any smart marketer would do.

[20:46] You take the money that is the most money first.

[20:51] And here's why you do it.

[20:52] And I'm just getting to the point now where I don't even know why I do this podcast and

[20:57] give marketing advice because nobody listens to it.

[21:00] Maybe those billionaire investors, how do these guys get so smart and become billionaires

[21:04] when they don't understand the very principles of marketing?

[21:08] And here's what I think is happening.

[21:10] I think you've got Pat Lawler's decision making on one end and then you got my marketing advice

[21:16] on the other hand.

[21:17] See I get that they want to put games on location first.

[21:20] And that's what Jack is going to do with this.

[21:22] They're going to put it out there like just like dialed in and they're doing the same

[21:26] thing.

[21:27] And then you're going to have a lot of people on location and Pat's going to visit and see

[21:32] if any issues arise with the game and they're going to make any changes necessary based upon

[21:37] people playing the game.

[21:38] And look, I applaud that.

[21:40] I think it's fine if you do that because living in an era in which there is no onsite testing

[21:46] for these expensive games is stupid.

[21:49] Stern knows that they would lose hype if they did that.

[21:54] You think it's great that they do that because I still think the only people that get burnt

[21:58] out on a new title and say the hype is gone, the hype is dead.

[22:02] The only people where that really happens are just the Pinside hyperpostors and the people

[22:07] who follow every pinball podcast, the pinball podcasters who need news every week.

[22:12] These are the guys who get burned out and say the hype is gone and no one's going to want

[22:15] it.

[22:16] But 95% of people who are going to buy a Willy Wonka aren't going to care that it was

[22:21] on location.

[22:22] They're not even going to know it was really out yet or they haven't played it yet and

[22:25] the game will still be new to them when they buy it or when they see it at a distributor

[22:29] for the first time.

[22:30] Now, so they're going to do that.

[22:32] Now look, they're thinking as this, we put that out there, we find issues with the game,

[22:37] we make the standard editions, we get the standard editions out on location, then we make the

[22:41] limited edition games or bulk of them and then we make the collectors editions games.

[22:47] But here's the problem.

[22:49] You're going to sell a $12,000, $12,500 Willy Wonka collectors edition.

[22:55] You're going to make 500 of them, which is the most collectors editions you've ever

[22:58] made.

[22:59] But you're going to make those people wait to the end of the line.

[23:04] Let me tell you something about rich people.

[23:07] They want to be at the front of the line.

[23:09] They want to spend more money because they want immediate access.

[23:14] Think about it, Jack.

[23:15] When you buy a VIP concert ticket and you're buying like the unskitty, Bob VIP Poison concert

[23:24] ticket, why does every single VIP concert ticket come with one thing, early access to the

[23:30] venue?

[23:32] You get to be there first, you maybe get to meet the band, you get special things, but

[23:37] you get to experience the game first.

[23:40] It's the same thing in everything in life.

[23:42] The most expensive people should get access first.

[23:47] What did Jack do?

[23:48] The complete opposite.

[23:49] They get the back of the line.

[23:50] I know what they're saying.

[23:51] We want to make sure there are games that are going to be of the highest quality.

[23:54] That's why they're doing it.

[23:55] No, Jack.

[23:56] No.

[23:57] You have enough time to make sure the quality is there and you shouldn't reveal the game

[24:03] until you feel like it's ready to go in a box for a customer.

[24:07] The problem is this.

[24:08] You're asking 500 people to pay that amount of money.

[24:11] They're going to watch all these LEDs go out in front of them.

[24:15] How many of those guys are going to bail and just say, you know what, I'll just go with

[24:19] an LED and I'll get it tomorrow.

[24:21] I'm not going to wait.

[24:24] Then you're going to start to get them to scrutinize whether or not the collector's

[24:26] edition is worth it.

[24:29] Here's the thing.

[24:30] If you release the collector's editions first, they would sell out of all 500.

[24:35] Because yes, there are 500 people who want Willy Wonka right away.

[24:38] There are 500 people that are on the fence between a CE and an LE.

[24:43] All you're doing by delaying it is you're losing the highest profit margin version of

[24:49] the game, which is the CE.

[24:51] See how Stern does it?

[24:52] Why do you think the LEDs ship immediately after the pros?

[24:56] Stern makes the pros first so they can get games on location.

[24:59] They hook you.

[25:00] It's out there.

[25:01] You can go play it.

[25:02] They get the LE people their games immediately.

[25:04] There's one reason why they do that.

[25:06] They lock in the high ticket item immediately.

[25:10] They don't give the impulse collector.

[25:14] The rich guy who just wants the best version of it.

[25:16] They don't give him enough time to rethink his decision.

[25:21] The more time you give these guys to rethink their decision, the more customers you lose.

[25:26] The more time you give them to switch over to an LE of the game, the more CE buyers you

[25:33] lose.

[25:34] It's just such a bad decision.

[25:35] Think about me.

[25:36] I went over there.

[25:38] I went over there with a check for $12,500.

[25:41] I love the game.

[25:42] You heard me.

[25:43] I hyped the game.

[25:44] I want the game in my living room immediately.

[25:46] Jack said they're going to be on the game in four weeks to eight weeks.

[25:49] I want one within four to eight weeks.

[25:51] I feel like Veronica.

[25:52] I want it now.

[25:53] I want my game.

[25:54] I want my game.

[25:55] I have to wait six months now.

[25:57] I have to keep up waiting and my excitement for six months.

[26:00] I have to watch other people unbox a cheaper version of the game and get to enjoy it.

[26:05] Four months in front of me.

[26:07] I'm just on the sidelines with the most expensive bill.

[26:11] That makes absolutely no sense.

[26:14] That is why he's not going to sell out of the CE's.

[26:18] He's just going to sit on them.

[26:20] Here's the other part.

[26:22] This just kills me.

[26:23] This kills me because I do think Jack is a great guy.

[26:27] I really want Jersey Jack to succeed.

[26:29] Here's the other thing.

[26:30] I had a customer, not a customer, a fan of mine.

[26:34] Come up to me on Facebook and said, hey Chris, I got to tell you something.

[26:40] Jack came up to me.

[26:42] I went up to him in Alentown and Jack told me personally that Guns and Rose is coming

[26:47] out next and we're going to see it in the fall.

[26:50] It just makes me want to take this microphone, take this computer and hook it up the window.

[26:56] What is Jack doing?

[26:57] Why is he telling people that Guns and Rose is next?

[27:00] Why is he telling people when to expect they can see it?

[27:03] I don't understand this.

[27:05] You're going to reveal Guns and Rose is right when you need Willy Wonka orders to go out

[27:10] the door.

[27:11] Once again, you've completely destroyed the sales of your collector's edition of Wonka

[27:17] because then you have your next game already in people's heads.

[27:19] Jack knows that the facts of pinball are that hype disappears when the next title is shown.

[27:26] We're like a school of fish that just moved to the next new whale to attach ourselves

[27:32] to.

[27:33] I know it works in this industry and I'm at the point.

[27:38] I'm just beyond frustrated.

[27:40] Willy Wonka is not even out.

[27:42] It's not even out yet and I have to go on the pinside and see a ton of mods available

[27:47] for it.

[27:48] Have you seen this ridiculousness?

[27:50] Like the mod couple.

[27:51] I love what they create but why are they showing us all these Willy Wonka mods when the

[27:55] game is like two months away at the earliest?

[27:59] I mean, what is going on here?

[28:02] This is like the toy line being out two months before the movie is even in theaters.

[28:10] How many cards in front of the horse are we going to get?

[28:14] I don't want to look at Willy Wonka mods right now.

[28:17] I don't need the games that are even available.

[28:20] How are these mods getting made?

[28:23] They get a game to make mods for so soon.

[28:25] How are they figuring out how to attach all these things to the game?

[28:31] I think some of those mods are really cool.

[28:33] If you've seen them, but a lot of them are just not even interactive.

[28:38] They don't light up.

[28:39] They don't move like the good egg bat egg.

[28:41] If you're going to make a mod for good egg or bad egg in Willy Wonka, it needs to have

[28:46] the needle that moves between the bolt.

[28:47] It needs to be light up and be interactive.

[28:50] Not just always be stuck on the good egg.

[28:53] The worst one I just saw is that they have this chocolate river one that goes in the

[28:58] upper left corner.

[28:59] When the ball goes up the wonka Vader, it slides down the ramp.

[29:02] I actually like the way it drops through this metal bracket that the ball zigzags back

[29:09] and forth.

[29:10] It's a really rewarding thing to see the way it drops down and it slows the ball down

[29:13] that way.

[29:14] They've covered it up with what looks like someone took diarrhea.

[29:21] Someone took a crap in your upper left part of your game.

[29:25] Look at it.

[29:26] That does not look like a chocolate river to me.

[29:29] It also makes no sense is why are you putting a chocolate river?

[29:34] That's attached to the end of the wonka Vader move.

[29:37] You don't go up in the elevator and slide down the chocolate river.

[29:40] It just makes no sense.

[29:41] If anything, I would just design ramps to be the chocolate river and make decals that

[29:46] cover them that look like a chocolate river.

[29:48] Don't put a big chocolate turd at the top of the play field like that.

[29:55] The whole thing has me wanting to pull my hair out.

[29:57] It really does because once again, I think as much as we wanted them to live up to what

[30:03] they said they would do, which is not reveal a game until it's on the line, but it's just

[30:09] I don't know who's controlling Jersey Jack Pimball.

[30:13] I think Pat Lawler almost has more control than Jack and I think they're once again just

[30:19] they haven't learned the facts of Pimball.

[30:22] They haven't learned the lessons yet.

[30:24] It shows again.

[30:25] Now look, I'm still going to get a Willy Wonka, but here's the deal, right?

[30:30] Six months from now.

[30:32] What else is going to be out?

[30:33] I mean, I have to stay on the sideline with the $12,500 check for six months.

[30:40] It just makes no sense to me.

[30:43] I think Jack needs to announce that the collector's editions will be made after the standard

[30:47] editions.

[30:48] Sell every collector's edition Jack before you start making the L.E.s.

[30:53] But the people paying the most money at the front of the line, right?

[30:58] That's where they supposed to go.

[31:00] I mean, how many times can Stern Pimball show these companies?

[31:03] This is how it's done and then they go and do it their own way.

[31:06] I don't know about how you guys feel, but I'm beyond.

[31:09] I'm just beyond like frustrated with how it just nothing they don't listen to anything.

[31:14] All right?

[31:15] You don't tell people at Allentown that Guns and Rose is next.

[31:18] You don't put the C.E. at the end of the line.

[31:21] Ah, anything else going on in Pimball?

[31:23] I saw someone say like Allentown sucked.

[31:27] Did you see that thread?

[31:28] Look, I know there was a long line at Allentown.

[31:31] Isn't that a good thing?

[31:32] Isn't that where do you people want it?

[31:33] You want it more people to get into Pimball?

[31:35] I'm just lucky because Friday, I was going to try to go to Allentown, get in early and

[31:41] then drive back for a four o'clock meeting.

[31:44] My goal was to just get right in at noon and then be back in the car by two.

[31:50] But it sounds like people got online and didn't even get in until like 1-130.

[31:56] So wow, I'm glad I missed out on going there.

[31:59] I normally go, I just didn't work out this year, had too many other things going on.

[32:04] I got an email from Jerry over at Multimorphic and Jerry's going to come on the show.

[32:11] We've got a list of things he wants to discuss and this is going to be a little bit of a,

[32:15] you know, I don't want to say like no holds barred because we always treat each other

[32:19] with respect.

[32:20] But I think this is going to be a little bit of a come to Jesus podcast between Jerry

[32:24] and myself.

[32:25] And I want to tell him what I think is the hard truth and the facts of what's going on

[32:30] around P3 Multimorphic.

[32:32] I want to hear from him.

[32:33] I think it's going to be a great discussion.

[32:35] It will always be a respectful discussion.

[32:38] But I want him to bring up all the points that he wants to discuss.

[32:41] So Jerry, I know you're listening.

[32:43] That is what I want the podcast to be.

[32:45] I want you to sort of guide it.

[32:47] I want you to ask me all the questions that you want to ask and you want to discuss.

[32:52] And let's do it that way.

[32:54] All right.

[32:55] You sent me a bunch and let's just go down the list and let's talk about it.

[32:58] All right.

[32:59] I think it's going to be an amazing show.

[33:01] And I'm going to be honest with you, man.

[33:03] And I think it's a time for honesty because you know, the fact is if you're not selling

[33:09] a lot, something's going wrong.

[33:12] And the fact is you can make adjustments and you can change course and be super successful.

[33:18] A lot of companies out there tried to do it one way for many years and then they tried

[33:23] it to do it another way and look what happened.

[33:26] You know, I love the story of how Blockbuster, they had the ability to buy Netflix and change

[33:32] their business model for $20 million and they passed.

[33:36] Now there's only one Blockbuster left in the world.

[33:39] All right.

[33:40] All right.

[33:41] Let me see if I have any new emails from you guys that I'm going to get to work.

[33:46] Do do do do.

[33:47] Don't you love Canadian Pimball podcast, 350 episodes.

[33:51] Oh, there's so many podcasts out there right now.

[33:53] I'm trying to keep up with so many of them.

[33:56] But I hope you're enjoying the show guys.

[33:58] I'm back.

[33:59] I know I took a five day break.

[34:00] It seemed like a lot.

[34:02] Let's see.

[34:03] Got an email from Jay McGuire.

[34:04] He says internet connectivity.

[34:07] Why not keep it simple and start out like Zen Pimball?

[34:10] Don't leave the top scores across all of the connected machines around the world and

[34:16] wear my own score ranks on the list.

[34:19] And let me auto upgrade my machine game code without having to do manual downloads on a

[34:25] USB stick.

[34:26] Jay.

[34:27] Well, Jay McGuire, that's a smart thing, right?

[34:30] Let's just do a leaderboard and updates.

[34:31] I think the updates and why I just need to happen in every machine.

[34:35] Here's a thing though.

[34:37] If there was a global leaderboard about who has the highest score in the Pimball machine,

[34:42] I'll tell you right now whose name would be at the top of that global leaderboard.

[34:46] K-A-N-E-D-A.

[34:50] Canada.

[34:51] Yep, that's right.

[34:52] I take the glass off.

[34:53] I'd sit there all day long hidden switches all day long.

[34:56] It'd be like 10 hours.

[34:57] It'd be like I got 850 barely an unbatman.

[35:00] Don't believe me.

[35:01] It glasses on.

[35:02] No, I mean, you'd have to have a system in which you disqualify people who clearly

[35:07] are cheating or glasses off.

[35:09] I think a leaderboard would be fun.

[35:11] I think it'd be cool.

[35:12] I think it's going to happen.

[35:13] I still think people thinking that there's no internet coming to Pimball are silly.

[35:17] I got an email from Brian.

[35:19] He said, going through withdrawals, Chris, hope you and your wife are doing great.

[35:24] I'm checking multiple times a day for new episodes.

[35:27] I'm going through withdrawals.

[35:29] Looking forward to hearing some new content.

[35:31] Keep up the great work.

[35:32] Always fun and entertaining.

[35:34] Well, Brian, we're back in the driver's seat.

[35:37] I'm sorry you went through withdrawals.

[35:39] It was fun taking a little bit of a break.

[35:40] It really was.

[35:41] All right.

[35:42] Do do do.

[35:43] What else we got here?

[35:44] All right.

[35:45] It's a Doug.

[35:46] All in town show is the title.

[35:48] He says, have you ever seen a line like this to get into a Pimball show?

[35:52] It wrapped around the parking lot and was a constant line for an hour and a half into

[35:58] the show.

[35:59] I've been going for almost 15 years and never seen it this bad.

[36:04] It's like everyone knows that Friday is the day to go and they take off work and take

[36:09] their kids out of school.

[36:10] Ivan, the organizer, really needs to think about opening earlier than noon.

[36:16] I see why you guys will just bring in one pin for free play so they can get in before

[36:21] the crowd.

[36:22] Also, I wouldn't be surprised that there's also the reason for opening so late on Friday

[36:28] so that the people bringing games can get the deals and time on the new pins.

[36:33] Taka was always at least 10 deep in line.

[36:36] I am all four more people getting into Pimball but this was a little absurd.

[36:41] The place was packed and by the afternoon there was someone on every machine.

[36:47] Oh, and the prices on the used and moldy up, up, up.

[36:51] Also black night was cool but not worth anywhere near 6K.

[36:55] One toy amongst a barren play field.

[36:58] Don and PA.

[36:59] I have a picture here which I'll make this picture my podcast picture today.

[37:06] How about that Don?

[37:07] Yeah, look, it sounded like it was kind of a zoo to get in there.

[37:13] It also sounded like there aren't as many games there.

[37:17] Only two Willy Wonkas and that's where the line was so long.

[37:19] This isn't like a Marcos set up at a T.P.F where there's like 25 of them.

[37:25] It's why I avoid shows.

[37:27] The other reason why I try to avoid shows too is I can go play these games for the most

[37:31] part in New York City at so many locations.

[37:34] It's also if I want to play Wonka again, if I were anyone out there, you want to play

[37:37] Wonka, hit up Jack.

[37:38] He'll invite you in.

[37:40] He opens his door to anyone who wants to come by and play the game now and it's the same

[37:45] distance as Alan Towne.

[37:46] It's even shorter for me to go to J.J.P.

[37:49] I would just hit him up and go play it there.

[37:51] All right.

[37:52] And episode 350 of Canade is Pinball Podcast, the facts of Pinball.

[37:58] Ultimately, we all know there's one fact that nobody is going to dethrone Stern anytime

[38:05] soon.

[38:06] Everyone else continues to sort of fumble the football and can't quite cross the goal line

[38:12] with their Pinball plans.

[38:14] Spooky Pinball is doing just fine.

[38:17] We're not talking about them.

[38:18] Here's why we're not talking about spooky because I'm in the threads.

[38:21] People are getting their games.

[38:22] People are enjoying their games.

[38:23] I'm not seeing problems with the games.

[38:25] So when that happens, it's like, what else is there to say other than spooky is delivering

[38:30] on what they promised to people and people are enjoying the game?

[38:34] It's almost as if you don't hear yourself on Canade's Pinball Podcast.

[38:37] You know all is good in your company, right?

[38:40] You know, I mean, what else are we not...

[38:42] As I say that, like I haven't talked a lot about pirates, but it's the same quality

[38:46] control sort of like ridiculousness on the pirates thread.

[38:51] I still like part of me always wants to wake up and be like, today's the day I'm going

[38:54] to buy a pirate and then I read all of the issues they're all having.

[38:58] I just can't do it.

[38:59] Anyway, the fact of the matter is this.

[39:02] Stern Pinball will keep driving it.

[39:05] Jersey Jack is always oh so close, but they always make so many questionable moves that

[39:10] I just don't get it.

[39:11] Jack, call me.

[39:12] You've got my number now.

[39:14] I will come over there.

[39:16] But whoever made Jack show this game so early.

[39:19] Whoever made him do all these things, they don't know marketing.

[39:23] They don't know anything about marketing.

[39:25] I tend to believe it's the billionaire and his son, the guy reading from his cell phone

[39:30] when he's introducing his own company's game.

[39:33] That to me speaks volumes about how these guys know to market their games.

[39:38] They need to wake up.

[39:39] They need to wake up.

[39:40] It's not hard.

[39:41] It's not hard.

[39:42] They do all this hard work to make these games what they are, but then they fumble the

[39:45] release of them.

[39:47] It's amateur hour.

[39:48] And they've been in it for seven years.

[39:50] The fact of the matter is it's really easy.

[39:55] Reveal your game.

[39:56] Ship your game.
