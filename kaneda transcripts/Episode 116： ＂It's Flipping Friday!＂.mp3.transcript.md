[00:00] Take me down to the fair and I'll see you in the bright and the day when you're locked in down.

[00:05] Or you'll be taken home.

[00:09] That's it.

[00:16] All right.

[00:18] Welcome to Friday, Canada's pinball podcast.

[00:23] A little bit of a news edition.

[00:25] For those of you out there who think that Canada's pinball podcast is going to become

[00:29] this sort of investigative journalistic podcast after listening to our alien day special,

[00:36] it's not going to become that.

[00:37] It's going to we're going to go back and have a lot of fun.

[00:39] And I want to say this, I got a lot of positive feedback from that last podcast, from a lot of

[00:45] different people.

[00:46] And I think the overall consensus was thank you for delivering us the facts and presenting

[00:53] your case in a more mature and professional way.

[00:56] And I think that's something that I've been trying to do ever since coming back to this

[01:00] podcast from my older days of being a ranter and a raver and going personally at people.

[01:09] That podcast that I aired on alien day was not meant to do that.

[01:12] It was simply meant to remind people that a lot has been said.

[01:17] And let's start there when we talk about news.

[01:19] Let's talk about alien day because news did occur after my podcast was put up.

[01:24] And the news was we got a video from Andrew and team showing us the Ellie artwork to

[01:30] alien.

[01:31] And what are my thoughts on that?

[01:32] So look, I think the artwork looks really cool.

[01:35] I think hand drawn artwork, it's done by Brian Allen, looks really, really dope, right?

[01:42] I don't think anyone looks at that art and says they're not happy.

[01:45] I do think that it's really curious as to why a completely new artist was brought on

[01:54] at this late stage to do the backlash.

[01:57] And what happened to Orrick?

[01:59] I feel bad.

[02:00] I feel like Orrick must have gotten shafted with this whole Ellie and the whole thing.

[02:07] The whole thing that must suck for him is Orrick is about to get an Ellie machine as payment

[02:13] for doing all this artwork on alien and his artwork won't be what goes out with the

[02:19] final game when it comes to the backlash.

[02:21] And I think this side art, but he's still on the play field, right?

[02:25] And that's the other question.

[02:27] And that's just up for you guys because art is really subjective is looking at it and

[02:30] saying does this art package?

[02:34] Does it work?

[02:35] Is it cohesive?

[02:37] I don't think that Brian Allen's artwork matches what's on the play field, per se.

[02:44] Would I have loved Brian Allen to do the entire alien package from the very beginning,

[02:49] including play field and side art?

[02:51] Yes, I've said it from the very beginning.

[02:53] I think that Andrew made a mistake not going with an incredible hand drawn alien artist.

[03:00] And the other part that I think confuses me.

[03:03] And again, this is why I did that alien day podcast.

[03:08] I just, we heard from the very beginning, we heard from everyone involved with the creation

[03:13] of alien pinball that Fox would not let hand drawn artwork beyond the machine, right?

[03:20] We heard that from the very beginning that the reason why the play field art was the

[03:24] way it was is because Fox was so protective over the license, right?

[03:28] This was one of Fox's greatest IPs and they would not let them hand draw the play field.

[03:35] What do you believe now that we have a hand drawn back glass?

[03:40] Would they not have allowed Brian Allen to hand draw the most amazing play field and

[03:46] improve it as well?

[03:47] So that's where I, you know, again, I think I don't believe what we've heard.

[03:51] I don't believe what we've heard over the years.

[03:54] I don't believe what we see it in videos in terms of productions occurring.

[04:00] And it's not, it's, look, you guys can make up your mind in this, as I've said.

[04:03] And now also the other part of this whole thing is now that you've got this beautiful

[04:08] back glass, it kind of makes getting the LCD screen in the back box area, a difficult

[04:16] decision for a lot of people.

[04:17] I saw a lot of people saying, oh, I don't know now.

[04:21] That's so awesome.

[04:22] But if I go for the LCD, I'm going to remove that art from my package and it's sort of

[04:29] creating a dilemma.

[04:30] And I think when I saw that, I was like, yeah, like I would not know which way to go.

[04:35] It's, yeah, yeah, you'll get the translate and you could frame it and hang it next to your

[04:39] alien Ellie, but that's not really what you want.

[04:42] All right.

[04:43] That's not really the look people are going for.

[04:45] They want to have everything like on the machine.

[04:48] And I think it shows to how, how wise Stern was to have a big enough LCD screen that also

[04:56] allowed for the great artwork to be on the back box.

[04:59] I think Stern's look is the right way to go.

[05:02] I think J-Pops look was the right way to go.

[05:05] I think you want to maintain as much back box art as you can.

[05:09] Because I do think the alien screen is too big.

[05:12] I do.

[05:13] I almost even think the Jersey Jack screen is a little too big.

[05:17] And when you're actually standing in front of a game, those screens, I think are larger than

[05:21] they need to be.

[05:24] So the other question when you see the alien day video is simply production.

[05:29] And that is the question on everyone's mind.

[05:30] That is the question that we poised out there is, it's not about artwork.

[05:36] It's not about licensing and approval.

[05:39] It's about production.

[05:40] And now that the early artwork is approved, it's now there's no excuses left.

[05:45] There are absolutely zero excuses to why alien production cannot begin yesterday.

[05:51] And so that was not answered.

[05:54] Seeing a couple guys on the line with long screw drivers manually screwing together a game

[06:02] does not give me confidence that production is beginning.

[06:08] And something that I didn't see discussed on the inside, but the reason why they're using

[06:12] hand screw drivers and Andrews answered this in other forms.

[06:15] I think there's like a UK pinball form or highway form is that apparently back a while

[06:21] ago when they were manufacturing alien play fields, they were using a torque screwdriver.

[06:28] And someone over torqued it and stripped or the pressure from the screwdriver cracked

[06:35] 10 of the play fields clear coats because they over screwed with too much torque.

[06:40] And so he's banned those torque screw drivers from the assembly line and that's why they're

[06:46] doing it by hand.

[06:47] Now imagine trying to hand make all these pinball machines with manually screwing in every

[06:54] single screw because there's a lot of screws on a pinball play field.

[06:57] I don't know if you can do that.

[06:59] I think the other problem that they're going to face with production and then I'll move

[07:03] on is this.

[07:04] There's too many options.

[07:06] There's too many options when you order your alien machine to keep the assembly line

[07:11] going, right?

[07:12] Because every time you add an additional variable to how someone orders their game, you have

[07:19] to then take the game off the line or bring new parts to that section of the line.

[07:25] So for example, the way Stern does their LEDs, you order a Stern Ghostbusters LED.

[07:31] Every single LED is the same, right?

[07:33] There's no options.

[07:35] When you go to order an Erasmith Ellie, that's it.

[07:37] Erasmith Ellie.

[07:38] So the Erasmith Ellie line all has the same parts.

[07:42] The problem that Andrew has is that you can order your Ellie with Backbox LCD without

[07:49] Backbox LCD.

[07:51] The small screen on the back box, the whole back box being the back glass.

[07:56] You can order it with black trim, green trim, blue trim.

[08:00] You can order it.

[08:01] You know what I'm saying?

[08:02] Even just those variables right there must be a nightmare to have to then go down an

[08:09] order sheet and you might have the next 20 games are all ordered differently.

[08:14] So you then have to do one at a time.

[08:17] And I just think that's a mistake.

[08:18] I think they need to say here's the alien Ellie.

[08:22] It's one trim.

[08:23] It comes with everything and that's how you get it.

[08:26] I think he's going to run into this mistake where he's trying to customize each one to

[08:31] each owner.

[08:33] It sounds great, but when we talk to George Gomez, we heard that specifically it's a nightmare

[08:38] to allow too much customization because you have to then pull it off the line and have

[08:43] people hand do each one and it slows down a line.

[08:49] So let's see what happens.

[08:51] The question you guys are all asking yourselves is when will production begin and now that there's

[08:55] no more Fox excuses.

[08:58] Production should start now.

[09:00] So I hope you guys get your games.

[09:02] This is not there's no more personal vendetta's or anything against this company.

[09:07] It's time to just make the game.

[09:09] And I think we all agree.

[09:11] Speaking of making the game, it was exciting to see over at Jersey Jack Pimball that dialed

[09:16] ends are on the line.

[09:18] And I couldn't help but juxtapose the two visualizations between highways production line and

[09:24] Jersey Jacks.

[09:25] So Jersey Jacks production line really, really exciting image.

[09:29] It's sort of like this.

[09:30] There's different stations like station one, station two, station three, station four.

[09:35] And the play fields are sort of sitting above those stations and they move from one station

[09:40] to the next.

[09:41] And each person at each station is doing a very specific job building that game and then

[09:48] it moves to the next station.

[09:49] And I've heard from a lot of people out there who are in manufacturing and how important

[09:54] it is to have an assembly line set up that way so that each person only has a responsibility

[10:02] that doesn't require too many things and too many steps.

[10:05] Because if you forget one thing and you have too much on your plate, it's a domino effect

[10:10] of the game's not built right.

[10:12] So what does this mean?

[10:14] This means that dialed in is going into production in May, which is super exciting.

[10:20] It's actually happening like Jersey Jack is delivering on his promise that dialed in

[10:26] would be on the line in April and we'll go into production in May.

[10:30] And I do not think we're this is like a staged photo by Jack.

[10:34] I think we're going to see dialed in really soon.

[10:37] And it's exciting.

[10:38] I do think that we've seen dialed in now for so many months that I want to get it out

[10:44] there.

[10:46] And as someone who has a deposit down on a collector's edition, I'm still on the fence

[10:52] on whether or not I'm going to stay in or get my money back.

[10:54] And I'll tell you why, we still have not seen what the collector's edition looks like.

[10:59] And that's another thing where when is Jack going to reveal what the cremdala crem top

[11:04] dog model of dialed in looks like for consumers.

[11:08] It's almost May and it's on the line.

[11:11] And I believe what they're going to do.

[11:13] I don't think the collector's editions come first.

[11:18] I think they're going to make a few of the LEDs or standards and then move on to the

[11:23] collector's editions just to see if there's any issues at all.

[11:27] They will address those before going to the super high end models.

[11:31] I'm not sure.

[11:32] I got to check on that.

[11:33] And I want to get Jack on the show.

[11:35] Jack's been promising to come on the show forever.

[11:36] I might just drive over to his facility in New Jersey and bring my snowball Mike and

[11:42] talk to him.

[11:43] But I really want to talk to Jack about the process of going from expo to production and

[11:50] even talk to him about production in general because I really do think it's interesting

[11:55] how much work goes into getting a game from what he showed us at expo to a production

[12:00] line and all the different hurdles and oceans he had across to make this game real.

[12:06] But for you dialed in guys out there exciting time, exciting time.

[12:09] You're going to be getting your game soon and look a brand new pat law or game going

[12:13] into the homes of collectors is a really exciting time.

[12:17] All right.

[12:18] So my rumor mill is telling me that Star Wars is right upon us.

[12:26] All right.

[12:27] I've been speculating I've been right and wrong.

[12:30] But I am hearing now and this is sort of like Canada confirming it for you guys that

[12:34] May 4th yes, we were right that May 4th will be the date that a Star Wars teaser video

[12:41] will be revealed.

[12:43] And shortly thereafter I believe the next week.

[12:45] Okay.

[12:46] So May 4th I believe is like a Thursday or Friday the following week we should get the full

[12:51] reveal of the game.

[12:53] And that it's like you know it's kind of like all right enough already just show people

[12:59] Star Wars let people see what it's all about.

[13:03] The hype is huge.

[13:04] The expectations are through the roof.

[13:06] What are my what's my gut tell me about this my gut tells me that people's expectations

[13:12] are so damn high that I just don't know if the game can live up to the expectations.

[13:18] I think there's going to be a little bit of that initial like underwhelming sort of disappointment

[13:23] that always seems to happen almost with every single new Stern pinball machine that comes

[13:28] out especially the Richie machines right Game of Thrones AC DC you know there's there's

[13:34] always been that like Star Trek right people picked on these games because of of how they

[13:39] looked at first but then as they got to play them people came around nobody fully came

[13:44] around on Game of Thrones because it's still the ugliest pinball machine I think I've ever

[13:48] seen.

[13:49] We know that Star Wars will not be fully hand drawn artwork it would be more of a Batman

[13:54] where there's going to be hand drawn art that is sort of put on the play field and sort

[14:00] of the cabinets in the back box but I don't I don't know anything I don't know anything

[14:03] more than that.

[14:05] I know that there is a hyper drive is like one of the main toys in the game where the ball

[14:11] goes into the hyper drive and I think it's using magnets and it's like this rail that

[14:16] sits above the play field and the ball just keeps going faster and faster and faster and

[14:19] trying to get the light speed.

[14:21] So that's cool that's cool we'll see how that's implemented in the game but there's

[14:26] so much in the Star Wars universe that people are going to want in this game that which

[14:31] means there's going to be so much that you wanted to see in this game that probably won't

[14:35] be in the game and I think that's why it's going to be hard to sort of blow people away.

[14:39] Like for me personally I want to see like a big death star I want to see like Luke's

[14:44] X-wing lifting up from Dagobah I want to see Yoda I want to see you know I want to see

[14:49] like all these things I want to see AT-AT walkers I want to see land speeders I want to

[14:54] see you know and it's like again you can't possibly jam all the world of Star Wars into

[14:59] one machine in a way that will appease everybody but I but I really hope it's a knockout

[15:04] I really hope it's a knockout what we do know though for you collectors out there for

[15:08] you new in box pinball guys this is the game that's on everyone's radar this is the game

[15:14] that as we said before is going to see money moving in that direction so for for everyone

[15:20] else out there and I said this before there couldn't be worse timing for like Andrew it

[15:24] couldn't be worse timing for dialed in it couldn't be worse timing for P3 it couldn't be

[15:30] worse timing for Dutch pinball to be going through what they're going through right all these

[15:34] things are happening all these people are trying to get your money and Stern's going to

[15:38] say hey guys we've got Star Wars and you can have it in June and it's going to ship no

[15:44] bullshit no two-year delay no promises that aren't going to be kept you can have it you

[15:51] can have it and that's that's why Stern wins that's why Stern wins time and time again

[15:56] because as much as people want to complain about code and the decals or this or that

[16:03] or splitting cabinets for every headache that Stern has given people they've also delivered

[16:12] games and they've delivered happiness to far more people than they've delivered headaches

[16:17] so speaking of headaches versus happiness with Stern Batman code is finally out a new code

[16:23] for Batman this game seems to be the forever waiting to it's kind of like Batman's kind of

[16:32] like a girl that you're just waiting forever for her to take her clothes off and you're watching

[16:37] her slowly remove an article clothing for for what like six months now eight months now it's

[16:43] it's taken forever so we saw Batman at expo for the first time and no one could play there

[16:51] because there wasn't enough code so that's October November December January February March April

[16:58] May okay so it's pretty much May right so it's almost like eight months people have waited

[17:04] for Batman code and and Lyman just released code 0.71 I'm not going to go through all the changes

[17:11] and all the things he's done and I don't have one so I can't tell you how good this code is or how

[17:18] much more there needs to happen in this game but new code update is always a good moment I think

[17:23] the point seven one actually excites people too because it means there's more to go it means

[17:30] Lyman is got point two nine more progress so it's only two thirds of the way there in terms of

[17:37] what he has envisioned for Batman but I also believe it's kind of a joke it kind of is a joke

[17:45] that this game won't be done code wise probably like it'll be out for like a year at least before the

[17:54] code is finally complete I don't think that's right and I look it's it doesn't maybe this is just

[18:03] how it is right maybe this is just how Lyman games will be that you might as well just wait a year

[18:09] until the code is complete and then go get one I know for a fact that there are Batman SLEs Batman

[18:16] L's still in box still in boxes waiting and and I think the speculative market on Batman probably

[18:24] would have been smart hold on to your game and sell it when code is complete because if the game

[18:30] really wakes up the value of that game the value of a new inbox Batman L or SLE will will increase

[18:38] but the risk is obviously if the code is finalized and and and it can't make the game great right

[18:45] games just kind of good but it's not like a classic it doesn't doesn't get applauded as being one

[18:50] of the the great Lyman games and and one of the best Sterns ever then the value would not really

[18:57] go up that much so you might be smarter to sell the game earlier on when the hype was strong I

[19:02] mean I sold my Batman before it even you know right when it shipped right and I'll tell you

[19:09] this like the guy sold it to I keep saying this he didn't even know what code was so he would have

[19:14] played it for years on on the basic code so I want to congratulate Stern and finally getting that

[19:18] code out there takes a long time it seems though to get this code and I don't know how much point

[19:25] 7.1 will see shade people but and we'll see how far along code is on Star Wars because

[19:31] Ghostbusters code was fairly complete when it launched so was Erasmith speaking of Erasmith

[19:37] not too much to add other than the fact that Erasmith continues to get great reviews from people

[19:44] it continues to be applauded as I think Erasmith is going to go down as a real sleeper hit for Stern

[19:50] this year and you know it's the total package and there's a funny pin-side thread of iceman being like

[19:58] alien game over man aliens great but Stern you know where he just sort of just goes on it it's

[20:04] feeling he's on the drunken rant at like 10 a.m. Texas time how great Erasmith is but look

[20:12] Erasmith as I said it has it all for 5200 that art package LCD the music everything you want in

[20:20] a pinball game a great toy things to shoot at the game has everything and it's it's really really

[20:27] great experience and I'm glad people are enjoying it remember how much shit people talked about

[20:32] Erasmith people were like disgusted that Stern was making Erasmith pinball and lo and behold

[20:37] they're enjoying it so that's really good news now personally I have to say this I got to play

[20:43] more and more Erasmith my big adversion in terms of like what I want to put in my apartment my the

[20:49] thing that really holds me back is I want to love Stern pinball so much I want to really stand over

[20:56] an Erasmith or an acdc or a tron you know I really I want I want Star Wars to be the pin that like

[21:03] I just hold on to forever and I get buried inside it the thing that just always it's it's it's on

[21:10] my mind every time I'm over a new Stern it's just the feel of the machine to me just feels a

[21:16] little cheaper than I wanted to feel and it's hard to describe it's hard to describe but

[21:22] whenever I'm playing a Stern it just doesn't have that solid nature to it that I get when I play

[21:29] like dialed in or hobbit or was or a ballet Williams game or magic girl you know and I know I know

[21:37] I got to maybe get over that desire to have a Stern feel as solid as the other games I've just

[21:44] described but there's just something about it it's like I stand over an Erasmith

[21:49] and I think the way I felt this way the most is when I played Batman Super Ali a Texas

[21:55] pinball festival you know you're just standing over this game and it's 15 grand and you just

[22:01] the way it feels it just it just doesn't have the value for me and I know I got a lot of fans

[22:07] out there of this podcast who loves Stern pinball and you always the well you know you always have

[22:13] to always argue with me but yeah but like it has everything else it has everything else but all

[22:18] my asking is Stern as your prices go up why can't you make these games feel as rock solid

[22:24] as ballet Williams games and your competitors out there who who make more solid feeling games I

[22:31] don't know I'm not a pinball manufacturer I'm just a marketing flak who critiques this industry

[22:37] and this industry is a lot harder to do than what I do for a living so speaking of solid feeling

[22:43] games Dutch pinball and the big Lebowski is a very solid feeling game and I I saw the letter from

[22:53] Yoppenberry most of you guys probably saw it as well they are reconvening with a Ra on May 5th

[23:01] and and that's where we're at with this this thing continues to sort of drag out it feels like

[23:07] it's almost been a year since they halted shipments on big Lebowski's I think it was like July

[23:14] August right that people people stopped getting their games and they're like really only one

[23:21] container went out to customers so far and I hope it works out I hope it works out I think the

[23:27] timing is unfortunate that you're going to have a meeting the day after Stern shows its Star Wars

[23:35] video so cool you know the Lebowski is like a great game it's a great game it's built well I thought we

[23:43] would have seen hundreds of them in homes by now instead of 40 or 50 I don't think this company

[23:49] will ever get the hype back I don't know how they survive I don't know how they turn the corner

[23:56] and get confidence back that the bride of pinbott the new 2.5 or 3.0 version I think that was a

[24:03] horrible move I think that's not what people want it and I think they need to get all the Lebowski's

[24:09] out and built and their next theme needs to excite people but here's the thing and I forgot to

[24:16] mention this at the beginning and I think this is my ultimate takeaway when I saw how people respond

[24:20] it to my highway podcast Tuesday is it's the same thing like if Lebowski if Dutch were to come out

[24:29] and say our next theme is back to the future people would throw money at them immediately and what

[24:35] I've learned and I've learned a lot this week just just listening to people's feedback listening

[24:39] to the way people talk listening to or reading the thread on pinside and on other forms is people

[24:48] still don't care like all that information that I shared with people right all those comments all

[24:53] those promises all those missed deadlines you know all the machines that were supposed to be out

[24:58] by now that aren't out people still don't care because they love alien and and because they love

[25:05] the theme so much they're willing to forgive or forget or not even care that there's a lot of

[25:12] information out there that says you know what like you might want to be careful with your money even

[25:17] though you love the theme it's the same way you know my friend Greg rare hero it's the same way like

[25:24] he loves the big Lebowski he ordered the big Lebowski on the spot seeing it at Expo from a company

[25:31] that had never really proven they can manufacture games or building these prototypes is is not

[25:38] manufacturing it's not manufacturing on any level but again that's the problem and Greg has

[25:43] been gotten a refund yet he's been dragged over the calls for so long and he still doesn't have his

[25:50] game and and the same thing is true with fans of the alien is that these guys are so in love with the

[25:56] theme that they they have they have no other choice it's either I lose my dream theme or I or I

[26:04] like stick it out and when it comes down to it like people I feel like we'll stick it out like

[26:09] they're gonna give Andrew highway the benefit of the doubt they're gonna give yop and bury the

[26:14] benefit of the doubt all these you know all these people are are are they move towards the light

[26:21] that's that's the way I look at it like when you put a dream theme it's like all these all all these

[26:25] collectors and all these pimple enthusiasts they've become like mindless sheep who just move towards

[26:30] the light they remind me of those bugs in in wreck it Ralph right that once the beam of light goes

[26:36] up they all just swarm towards it that's what pinball people are like when you put a dream theme

[26:41] out in the world and when no matter what's going on no matter what shit show is occurring within the

[26:46] companies making these games these people just won't get out they won't get off the train that they

[26:54] they they can't there there's something weird about it so if you ever want to like steal money from

[27:00] pimball people and and create like a a con artist sort of just all you got to do is announce a great

[27:06] theme everyone loves and make a flyer with the game on it and say you're taking deposits now and

[27:12] and then go hide out in Mexico for 20 years with everyone's pre-order dollars now all right what

[27:17] else is going on I'm trying to see like there's no news really coming from spooky uh Scott is gonna

[27:22] Scott the Nesey who made total annihilation is going to be on Charlie's podcast that I believe will

[27:28] go up May 1st so that is going to be exciting I've tried to get Scott on the show but he's holding

[27:34] out for Charlie so I understand that still no p3s going out multi more thick it's uh it should be

[27:42] soon though I really think uh Jerry was aiming for for for May to have games going out so I'm going

[27:48] to reach out to Jerry and see what's going on uh I have a open offer to talk to Mike at home pin

[27:53] have you guys been following the home pin thread uh things are moving quickly things are moving

[27:58] quickly I'm seeing a lot more parts I'm actually starting to see like the game come together they

[28:03] showed an image of the topper uh that assembly there's like a sort of like a plastic casing around

[28:08] the topper uh but home pins can be a really interesting one to see when they're ready and and what

[28:15] it looks like and can it um you know can they deliver and be a real competitor in in this industry

[28:21] they're they're they're building an entire factory they're building every part so uh we love

[28:27] Mike to come on the show and explain um where they're at and and and what's going to happen in 2017

[28:32] with home pin I'm trying to think if there's any other news breaking in the pinball world I don't

[28:38] really think there is I think I've got everything covered I'm going down the list of manufacturers

[28:45] uh Jersey Jack we covered spooky highway multi more thick uh attack from Mars remake I you know

[28:50] I even even talk about that well um I think it's shipping I think it's shipping next month so the

[28:56] word I'm hearing from distributors is attack from Mars remakes are going to be going out in May so

[29:02] look add that to the mix man it is like I I don't know about you guys but man there are so many titles

[29:07] coming out there are so there are so much it's about to be available in the pinball world and I

[29:13] think I think it spells two things I think it's a great time for buyers I think it's a great time

[29:18] for buyers I think it's the worst time for manufacturers that don't have their shit together and as

[29:24] as I've predicted winners and losers this year people there's no way around it if you don't have

[29:30] production going the money will go to the production the money will go to the pinballs that are

[29:36] inboxes the money will not stay frozen anymore in this like pre-order limbo it will not it will not

[29:44] I think you got to be a fool to be putting pre-orders down on games where production's not occurring

[29:49] I think you'd be a fool the pre-order money down on Houdini right now I mean Houdini like feels like

[29:55] it's it's it's gonna be eight months by the time we get Houdini I don't think they should have

[30:00] announced or shown stuff so early I don't think it does any good why why right over the next three

[30:07] months AeroSmith inbox Batman inbox Star Wars inbox you know these you know these are all games

[30:13] you can go get you can go get hopefully a Lebowski hopefully an alien hopefully an attack from

[30:18] Mars remake hopefully a dial then I get what eight nine titles if you count them all P3 you know eight

[30:25] nine titles I can't even go eight go get eight nine titles for Nintendo Switch there's not even

[30:31] eight titles available for it and yet millions of people have it and only a few thousand people

[30:36] collect pinball and there's more titles available just right that's crazy speaking of Nintendo Switch

[30:41] Mario cards out today yes I can go have fun for less than 20 thousand dollars magic girl let's talk

[30:49] real quick about magic girl I haven't you guys gotta give me credit I don't talk that much about

[30:52] magical recently there are magic girl auctioning's happening all over the place now Dave King is a

[30:59] magical owner he has magical number seven if you're looking for a magic girl go on eBay now he listed

[31:05] it weird he listed it under like replacement parts on eBay so if you just search for pinball and

[31:10] it doesn't come up you have to search for magic girl pinball and he's auctioning off number seven

[31:16] unfortunately Dave is going through a divorce so that that is what is um provoking him to do this

[31:22] but here's the exciting part there's no reserve on this on this game so whoever whatever the top

[31:27] bit is is gonna get it so and but it's weird he put it up and the auction ends on like Monday at

[31:34] like two o'clock Eastern time and I told them like Dave man you should have this thing ending Saturday

[31:38] night at midnight but I don't know he just kind of did it a little half hazardly the way he listed

[31:44] it but that's gonna be exciting it's already at 16 grand so he's already gonna break even on it so

[31:49] the rest is all just gravy but what else is happening is like a lot of people are putting up

[31:55] magic girl items so there's someone just put up like a wooden printout of the playfield like

[32:01] it's a big wood piece that has like the playfield artwork printed on it it's a little bit larger

[32:06] size than a playfield but it's like a test screen for what the colors would look like and I

[32:11] reached out to the guy and the guy's like look you know I did some work for John I never got really

[32:16] paid I was promised a machine I never got it so I'm gonna sell this it's really interesting dirt

[32:22] I think what's gonna happen now because people saw what the zombie Yeti back last went for is

[32:26] everyone who has a John pop a Duke magic girl or zidware item is gonna cash out because

[32:34] they realize it's up man it's like john's up like there's not gonna be a raza guys there's

[32:38] not gonna be j pop games two and three coming out it's never gonna happen and everyone who he

[32:44] screwed is gonna come out of the woodworks and and and and sell their items because those items

[32:50] are valuable and it is a little sad because at the end of the day it showed that john had great

[32:55] value and knew how to create stuff that pinball people really want it but he can never put it all

[33:00] together he can never put it all together but I am I'm excited to see what comes up for auction

[33:06] next you guys know that john made a raza EM there is an EM raza that he made he put the raza artwork

[33:15] over an EM machine and it was in his shop imagine what that would sell for right imagine what the

[33:22] raza EM would go for one of one raza EM's he could sell the empty raza cabinets just the way

[33:30] they are and they would go for thousands of dollars it's just it's just this weird thing if you're

[33:35] a collector you're gonna want to have some of this rare zidware memorabilia the story is what it is

[33:42] all right that's it for this little Friday news canate is pinball podcast I hope this sounds better

[33:49] I'm looking at it as a record and someone told me like your your podcast there's a lot of clipping

[33:55] and I'm trying to avoid as much clipping as possible by lowering the mic and I'll end on this note

[34:01] canada has seeked pinball political asylum with australia I have joined the Aussie arcade forum I am

[34:11] on there they have welcomed me for the time being uh and uh and I'm excited that that I've been

[34:19] banned by clav and pinside and the american the american pinball forms I won't even it's not

[34:24] an american pinside but the the other large pinball forms out there apparently canada is is

[34:31] is too controversial is too provocative but I think I've changed I think I've changed and I think

[34:35] if you go on the Aussie arcade forum and you read the discussion happening on that forum around

[34:41] highway pinball and stern and this and that I think these guys these Aussies man I'm they tell it

[34:46] like it is they don't hold back the the conversation there's a lot more truthful uh but I but I heard

[34:52] too that they have they have their own people they protect I heard they're like they go really easy

[34:56] on mic from home pin they don't say it like it is and people get banned for saying what you know it's

[35:01] so what's new right in the pinball world right it's the same shit everywhere um I do think robin

[35:08] should reconsider canada don't you don't you you guys should hit robin up and be like you know

[35:12] what canada's a changed man let's let him back on that's it happy friday everyone have a great weekend

[35:19] and we'll talk to you real soon
