[00:00] The sound of four twippies.

[00:09] He's never won a pinball tournament in his life.

[00:15] He doesn't like to nudge machines.

[00:21] And yet, Kinatus Pinball podcast does it again.

[00:25] He's here to confirm for you all.

[00:27] Kind of confirm the next Stern Pinball title.

[00:31] It's the biggest TV show in the world right now.

[00:34] And meanwhile, some dude, Lik and Cheetos,

[00:37] stains off his fingertips,

[00:39] is typing on pin-side that it's an easy pass for him.

[00:43] Easy pass.

[00:45] This is gonna sell like hotcakes, people.

[00:49] Oh yeah, you hear it now.

[00:51] Yeah, Brian Eddie.

[00:53] Illustrated artwork.

[00:55] Baby Yoda.

[00:58] Best Garsteel.

[01:00] Kinatus Pinball podcast.

[01:03] All you fool spending $36,000 on pie or to the care being

[01:08] collect his additions, wake the F up.

[01:13] Wake up, people.

[01:16] Stern Pinball's about to clobber so many companies.

[01:19] I mean, they do it every year.

[01:21] It's nothing new.

[01:23] I'm not gonna let these big themes sleep.

[01:30] How did Kinatus find out?

[01:32] Who's the source?

[01:34] Who's the ball?

[01:36] Let's talk about Mandalorian on this episode of Kinatus Pinball Podcast.

[01:41] You knew they were gonna do it.

[01:51] You knew Stern Pinball was gonna come out with the biggest themes,

[01:55] the biggest properties.

[01:57] This company has all of the relationships with the major studios out there in the world.

[02:02] And so I'm here to tell you on this many episode of Kinatus Pinball Podcast

[02:07] that the rumored next title from Stern Pinball is the Mandalorian.

[02:12] Now, I have not seen the game.

[02:15] I am getting details about what is in the game fed to me from some very, very reliable sources.

[02:22] Now, it's been very, very good on Stern's part by keeping these rumors a secret.

[02:28] But I will say this.

[02:30] I started to hear this title from multiple sources about three weeks ago.

[02:35] So Stern Pinball, if you're looking to see what happened three weeks ago,

[02:39] you told somebody or you shared some details or you showed some distributors images of the game.

[02:44] I don't know.

[02:45] I'm not gonna reveal my sources, but this is what I am hearing is the next title from Stern Pinball.

[02:51] So let's go down a list real quick of everything we know about this game.

[02:55] It's a Brian Eddie game.

[02:57] I know that the art package on this game is illustrated.

[03:01] So it's not gonna be Photoshop drag and drop from the show.

[03:04] The illustrator on this game is not Zambi Eddie.

[03:08] Okay, so we can put that to bed.

[03:10] I don't know who is coding this game.

[03:13] That is a question mark that a lot of us have because we know that a coder can make or break a game like this.

[03:20] I'm hearing that this game is a lot more like the shadow and not a traditional fan layout like attack from Mars or medieval madness.

[03:29] I'm hearing there is an upper play field.

[03:31] I'm gonna give you more details about this upper play field on a later show,

[03:36] but I'm not gonna spoil everything I know right now.

[03:40] I know a few more details about what is under the glass in this game.

[03:44] I know this game will have more LEDs than Stern normally makes.

[03:48] I will give you the exact number I've been hearing, but I will say this.

[03:52] I will say this knowing the popularity of the Mandalorian knowing that this theme is something that millions and millions and millions of people

[04:00] love.

[04:01] I do think that all of these games are gonna sell out on day one.

[04:05] I'm the other thing I'm hearing is this.

[04:07] And this is just a broad stroke observation of what I'm hearing from multiple sources.

[04:12] And they say, Chris, you know, you're really gonna be blown away by what you see coming from Stern Pimbal.

[04:17] And I respond to these people and I say, look, a Stern's a Stern's a Stern.

[04:21] And Stern Pimbal machines don't normally blow me away.

[04:24] Their themes blow me away.

[04:26] Stern gets the best themes in Pimbal.

[04:29] But it is often the case when we see a new Stern machine, we are somewhat underwhelmed.

[04:34] And we often don't feel like, wow, they went the extra mile with these games.

[04:39] So I hope Stern machines blow me away.

[04:42] I hope Stern machines put more under the glass.

[04:45] I hope Stern machines have incredible code and incredible artwork and incredible assets and incredible theme integration.

[04:51] Because guess what?

[04:53] We're paying for it.

[04:54] And we've been paying for it for a very long time.

[04:57] So it's about time the price of a Stern machine matches up with what we get in a Stern machine.

[05:05] It's been absolutely comical that a Stern LE is pretty much the same price as a Jersey Jack LE for so many years.

[05:13] I know Jersey Jack just raised its prices, but there's a reason why they did that.

[05:17] If you put a Jersey Jack LE next to a Stern, you can't tell me they should be priced the same.

[05:23] But let's talk about Mandalorian because people out there on Pinside are saying like this is an easy pass.

[05:30] In easy pass, are you serious?

[05:33] Are people really thinking that this won't make for an incredible Pimbal experience?

[05:38] Have you not seen the Mandalorian?

[05:40] If you have not seen the Mandalorian, I hope you do because it is the best Star Wars content in the world right now.

[05:47] Let me repeat that the Mandalorian is the best Star Wars content in the world right now.

[05:52] It is for a lot of us out there who love Star Wars so much, who were super disappointed in the recent movies that came out because they were pretty horrible.

[06:01] I did love Rogue One.

[06:03] I actually liked Solo.

[06:05] I liked the Force Awakens, the first one, but then everything falls apart with Ryan Johnson's, he ruined it.

[06:14] That second movie in that new trilogy was so bad that the third one was just like, eh, it couldn't make up for it.

[06:21] And you see the reviews?

[06:23] You see how the audience score wasn't good.

[06:25] And so I think that the Mandalorian for so many people out there reminded them of why they loved Star Wars in the first place.

[06:35] It's a Western set in outer space.

[06:38] It's a fun journey.

[06:40] It's got a great storyline.

[06:42] What I love about the Mandalorian storyline, it's so simple, it's so beautiful, and it's so well told.

[06:49] And the fact that we get that quality of entertainment in a TV show format is unbelievable.

[06:57] And I don't get it.

[06:59] I don't get why some people on Pinsider are saying, eh, I'm over Star Wars.

[07:03] Eh, I'm over Disney.

[07:05] Eh, I'm over the Mandalorian.

[07:06] I'm going to tell you right now.

[07:07] If you sleep on this game, you will most likely regret it.

[07:11] The other thing I'm hearing is that this game is going to have full assets.

[07:16] So you're going to get clips from the show.

[07:19] You're going to get voices from actors in the show.

[07:22] So this isn't going to be a stern game in which we're going to get like animated stuff on the LCD and not the show itself.

[07:29] I'm not surprised by that.

[07:31] We got mostly all the assets we wanted in the Star Wars game that Steve Richie made.

[07:36] So for Brian Eddie's game to have full assets makes sense.

[07:39] It seems like Stern has a really good relationship with Disney.

[07:43] So we're going to get great assets in this game.

[07:46] I really, really would love for all of us out there to start speculating about what's in this game.

[07:51] Like we knew Guns and Roses was coming out a year before it did.

[07:55] We know that Godzilla's coming out.

[07:57] We know that Toy Story is coming out.

[07:59] We're going to talk about what spooky pinball's next title is because I don't think it's wrong for me to tell you what the themes are when we hear rumors.

[08:06] And when we hear a lot of rumors, I don't think it's wrong for me to somewhat say I somewhat predict that the next title is this.

[08:14] And that's what I'm doing right now.

[08:15] I am predicting that Stern's next title is the Mandalorian.

[08:19] And I want us all to geek out and think about what would you put into a Mandalorian pinball machine that would be so incredibly awesome.

[08:28] So let me start what I would love to see in this game.

[08:31] Well first and foremost, you need to have the armor on the Ellie be best car steal like the steal of the Mandalorian.

[08:38] That needs to be best car needs to be what the Ellie package is.

[08:42] It needs to look like best car steal.

[08:44] I was also thinking they need to and they're not going to have this.

[08:47] But this would be so amazing.

[08:49] They need to have baby Yoda's.

[08:51] I know he's like Grogu.

[08:52] I know I always forget what his other name is.

[08:54] They need to have his crib which floats next to the Mandalorian as he walks.

[08:59] They need to have that crib magnetically lift off the play field and just stay there hovering.

[09:05] How cool would that be now they're probably not going to do it.

[09:08] They're probably not going to do it.

[09:09] But I would love to have a floating magnetic crib in this game somewhere.

[09:15] Now we also have spaceships that are super cool in the show itself.

[09:19] You've got slave one.

[09:20] You've got both a fed ship.

[09:22] I just ruined it.

[09:23] Spoiler alert.

[09:24] If you haven't watched it, Boba Fett is still alive in this universe.

[09:27] The statue of limitations on spoiling this storyline is up.

[09:31] You have to go see it.

[09:32] The final episode.

[09:33] The final episode.

[09:34] I won't spoil this for you if you haven't seen it yet.

[09:36] But the final episode in episode two of the Mandalorian is one of the greatest episodes in Star Wars history.

[09:43] It is one of the most joyous moments in Star Wars history because we finally got to hang out again

[09:51] with our favorite Star Wars character in the right way.

[09:54] They ruined him in the new movies.

[09:56] They ruined him.

[09:57] He was supposed to be the star of the new films and Luke Skywalker.

[10:01] I just gave it away again.

[10:03] Luke Skywalker was so like neutered in the new movies.

[10:06] But this is the Luke that we wanted and this show is so good.

[10:10] You have to watch it.

[10:11] You have to watch it.

[10:12] And again, I don't feel like I'm spoiling it now because if you haven't seen the Mandalorian,

[10:16] it's like where have you been?

[10:17] Where have you been?

[10:18] If you call yourself a geek, if you love geek things, if you love sci-fi stuff, if you love pinball,

[10:24] if you're just a nerd, if you're a nerd, you love the Mandalorian, okay?

[10:28] The other thing they need in this game, I mean, think about it.

[10:31] In this game, when Carl Weathers, the character that plays Carl Weathers,

[10:34] when he's looking for a bounty hunter to go get someone,

[10:38] he hands them a puck and the puck has a hologram of who it is they're hunting.

[10:43] Now, this game, how cool would it be to take that technology

[10:47] that was in Ghostbusters, the Ectogoggle technology where it has the hologram?

[10:52] How cool would it be in this game if they had a puck?

[10:55] And the puck projected the mode you're about to go in because that's who you need to go hunt as the Mandalorian.

[11:01] I mean, how super cool would that be?

[11:03] What else would I have in this game?

[11:04] I mean, and then you've got Baby Yoda.

[11:06] You got the star of the show.

[11:07] You got Grogu.

[11:08] You got his Force Powers.

[11:10] You are gonna have to have.

[11:12] Please, please, please.

[11:14] This was the biggest mistake in Steve Richie's Star Wars.

[11:17] How do you have Steve Richie's Star Wars?

[11:19] How do you have Star Wars?

[11:21] A theme that's all about using the Force.

[11:23] And how do you not have a magnet in your game that allows people to force control the ball?

[11:29] How cool would it be?

[11:30] Just picture this.

[11:31] How cool would it be if there's like a bad guy in the game

[11:34] and he's shooting at the Mandalorian and the balls coming down the playfield and all of a sudden,

[11:39] Baby Yoda's hand comes up and just freezes the balls and like stops them from coming forward.

[11:46] Talk about the potential for pinball moments in this game.

[11:50] Now look, I know that I'm a dreamer.

[11:52] I know that I'm a good creative mind.

[11:55] I know that I would love to see things like I just described in this game.

[11:59] But I also know that there's realities and there's bomb.

[12:04] And there's like physical things that can and cannot be done in pinball.

[12:07] I get it.

[12:08] But I do have faith in Brian Eddie.

[12:11] Because I think Brian Eddie is a guy that loves toys and he loves to try to put wow into the games.

[12:17] Now Stranger Things was a miss.

[12:19] Steve Richie's Star Wars was a miss.

[12:22] Could this be the Star Wars pin we've been looking for?

[12:26] Could it be the Mandalorian?

[12:28] I'm super excited.

[12:29] I'm waiting to see who has the guts.

[12:32] Who has the guts to listen to this podcast?

[12:35] And go to pinside and be the one who starts the thread.

[12:40] Stern's pinball, the Mandalorian is next.

[12:43] And then you're going to have to say,

[12:45] Canada says so.

[12:47] And everyone who hates Canada.

[12:49] Everyone who says Canada is always wrong.

[12:52] Everyone who has to have like hour and a half shows or three hour shows or fireside chats.

[12:57] No, we're not going to be able to talk to George Gomez now in mid-May.

[13:00] We're not going to be able to interview the team that made it.

[13:03] Because I know that you would rather geek out with Canada.

[13:07] And think about all the awesome possibilities that will be in the Mandalorian.

[13:12] Then to keep this information private.

[13:14] Because I've signed no NDAs and it's just a rumor.

[13:17] Again, I haven't seen the game.

[13:18] Who knows it could be back to the future.

[13:20] Will this be the biggest Trojan horse ever?

[13:22] Will it be Smoking Mirrors and Will Stern come out with back to the future?

[13:26] Here's the thing.

[13:27] I think Stern is coming out with back to the future.

[13:30] I think Stern is going to come out with Harry Potter one day.

[13:33] I think if any company is going to get these properties, it's going to be Stern.

[13:37] It's going to be Stern.

[13:38] And here's the thing.

[13:39] Unfortunately, Stern isn't the company we want to make our dream themes.

[13:43] So I hope this game proves a point that Stern can up the ante and put more magical wow under the glass.

[13:51] We're going to see it in just a few weeks.

[13:53] So take it, discuss it, deconstruct it, insult Canada.

[13:58] Do what you do best, but you heard it here.

[14:01] The Mandalorian.

[14:02] Goodbye.
