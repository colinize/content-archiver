[00:00] Double-talking like a kid,

[00:02] Rulerations,

[00:04] Man,

[00:06] You dig,

[00:08] What I'm saying.

[00:14] Aw, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:16] It's my favorite time of year when I get to spoil a pinball company's plans.

[00:20] Because when you know what's coming down the road, people, it's real easy not to spend 10 or $13,000 on a Venom.

[00:27] Are you a 40 to 60 year old man or not?

[00:29] Alright, so this is confirmed, people. This is happening. It is 100% happening next year in the pinball world.

[00:36] Now look, I'm gonna lose my bet with Mr. Knapps Arcade. I don't think John Borg is gonna be making He-Man.

[00:42] He's gonna be making this title.

[00:44] Now this is a title that's been around the rumor mill in the pinball space.

[00:47] There's a lot of rumors floating around. Who's making this? Who's making that? Who has this license?

[00:52] Harry Potter? This and that. He-Man. Masters of the Universe. G.I. Joe. You name it.

[00:57] There's a rumor somewhere that someone's gonna make the game. But this is confirmed, people.

[01:08] It's now starting to make total sense to me. It makes total sense that this would be his next game because Rush was his last game.

[01:16] So this is going to be the Stern Pinball game that is almost two years in development.

[01:22] They've been working on it. They have the license and they're going to make the following game.

[01:28] And if this does not come true, I will turn off my podcast for an entire month.

[01:34] And you know me how much I love the attention and I can't live without it.

[01:39] Alright everybody, here it is. John Borg's game coming from Stern Pinball after Jaws.

[01:45] And no, there's a lot of Jaws happening but it's not gonna be Elton John but it's gonna be John Borg.

[01:51] And he's making the following.

[02:22] Yeah, I'm thinking on back.

[02:32] I'm not afraid of John Wick.

[02:34] Uh-huh.

[02:39] How good's your laundry?

[02:41] No one's that good.

[02:42] I thought not.

[02:51] You
