[00:00] These...

[00:02] Bullets games are tearing me,

[00:08] You're tearing me,

[00:10] You're tearing me apart.

[00:14] When a manufacturer puts a game in a box,

[00:22] that is the moment in which the game no longer belongs to them.

[00:27] It now belongs to us, the customer.

[00:30] Okay, when you ship something out into the world,

[00:32] the manufacturer, the designer, the coder, the artist,

[00:37] they are saying to us that they feel this game is good enough

[00:40] to give to people and we can take people's hard-earned money

[00:44] and give them this product, this entertainment device known as Pimbal.

[00:49] And so what I want to do on episode 363 of Canadian Pimbal Podcast

[00:54] is I want to read some of your early reviews of Willie Wonka Pimbal machine.

[01:00] This is coming from you, the customer, from you, the Pimbal fan,

[01:04] not from Canada.

[01:05] You know how I felt about the game when I hopped on the game early,

[01:08] but here's what I will do.

[01:10] After I read some of your feedback,

[01:12] I want to give you my feedback and where I'm at at the end of June 2019

[01:18] on Willie Wonka Pimbal.

[01:19] How does that sound?

[01:20] All right, so one of the most popular reviews right now

[01:25] is coming from Delt 31 on Pinsight.

[01:29] And he writes,

[01:30] I played a ton of Wonka today by myself, loud music.

[01:35] It was very close to a home-use experience.

[01:39] He played it at Helicon Brewery.

[01:42] He says, my biggest concern with this game was not how it shot,

[01:47] but the music affects and lack of JJP stuff and integration.

[01:53] After spending hours playing it and really taking everything in,

[01:58] I definitely have a position on this game.

[02:01] And it's not good.

[02:03] Very disappointed.

[02:05] Just one man's opinion, so play it yourself,

[02:08] but I thought I would summarize my experience.

[02:10] And here's what he says.

[02:13] First, the good stuff, shots, butter,

[02:16] I expect it, but definitely necessary to call out.

[02:19] It's a smooth shooter with clear shots that are visible right away to the player.

[02:24] I will say that my previous Butter Champion dialed in still has it over this game.

[02:30] And that's primarily due to the layout of Wonka.

[02:33] For me, who is not very good at Pimbal,

[02:36] I could sit there all day and hit those ramps on Wonka.

[02:40] The right ramp is so wide, it's a joke to hit.

[02:44] While the left ramp is still very easy, they just aren't very satisfying.

[02:49] The top right flipper is also very easy to hit.

[02:53] That top ramp while the top left flipper feels the best when you hit the ball to the spinner on the top right,

[02:59] which is the hardest shot in the game in my honest opinion,

[03:03] but also the best shot of the game.

[03:05] Surprisingly, the Gobstopper shot was frustrating because I had many times

[03:12] where the ball would bounce out of the hole.

[03:14] I will also say that although ramps are easy, it's super outlaying drain friendly,

[03:20] which at times felt cheap and reminded me of how Pat wanted this to be

[03:24] quick ball times and a good on route pin.

[03:28] Again, I'm not very good at all and I dropped some major coin during my gameplay.

[03:34] He says assets.

[03:35] Yes, many are worried about not enough speech or video.

[03:39] Maybe it's the new code, but the game definitely has enough video and speech

[03:44] that I didn't walk away saying there was a major gap.

[03:47] Now, how they use it is another story, but to say JJP didn't pack in real audio and video

[03:53] just wouldn't be accurate.

[03:56] Okay, now the negatives.

[03:59] It's funny that he says now the negatives because he had many negatives in his positives as well.

[04:04] I mean, okay, he says by far, the biggest issue with this game for me is the music and sound,

[04:11] including the narrator.

[04:13] Holy SHIT.

[04:15] JJP can update the code and add in four more toys integrated so you literally are in the

[04:21] movie, but if they don't fix the music and sound, I would still pass on this game.

[04:26] This has to be the most annoying game to play I've ever tried.

[04:31] It sounds like other areas of the game as I was hitting them.

[04:35] I said to myself, oh my god, just shut the f up machine.

[04:39] It's that bad.

[04:40] It takes you out of the experience.

[04:43] It's painful.

[04:44] I sense it the first time I played it and thought, wow, it's even worse than I thought and

[04:49] it only got worse.

[04:50] The narrator is absolutely positively the worst I've ever heard as well.

[04:55] It really pulls you out because it's so bad.

[04:58] I can't think of any other machine I've played that even comes close to having such a negative

[05:04] impact on my experience.

[05:06] Integration.

[05:07] Yes, JJP has the video.

[05:10] Yes, they have the audio speech, but it's all over the place.

[05:15] They just put in random clips here and there and it seems like it's been put together

[05:20] by an amateur versus what we expect from JJP, which is everything is in sync, like video

[05:26] and audio matching gameplay.

[05:29] This game tries to bring you into the world of Wanka, but it's so mashed up and the video

[05:34] is just that with no speech of the characters.

[05:38] It's very jarring and really takes away from the impact.

[05:42] Everything just feels like it's being thrown at you.

[05:45] You don't really appreciate it because of that.

[05:48] I know they intended it to be like that versus the modes progression, but man, it really

[05:54] takes away from the feeling like you're playing through a story and more like Wanka

[05:59] and Chaos.

[06:01] They also seem to completely forget about the dark part of Wanka and just focus on the

[06:07] happy go lucky oversaturated world.

[06:09] You feel like the game is familiar in one sense, but completely lacking in another.

[06:16] Wow, dealt.

[06:17] I mean, I appreciate the in-depth review.

[06:20] He also goes on to talk about innovation.

[06:23] He says, I stood over Wanka, then I looked to the right where Pyrr to the Caribbean and

[06:28] dialed in stood.

[06:30] The first thing I thought was JJP was able to build this game and deliver as expected

[06:35] because the game is definitely different than his others.

[06:39] The game is comparatively speaking to his other titles so much more simple.

[06:45] It's staggering.

[06:46] As a result, this is the first game from JJP that doesn't feel special.

[06:52] Just by no means a Stern Pro, but there is something lacking.

[06:56] The Gobstopper toy is a major disappointment to me in person, considering it just doesn't

[07:01] look good and the mech is just so who cares.

[07:05] The Wanka video in the back right doesn't look nice either, not visually appealing.

[07:11] And although it shows you some text, the entire Wanka vision camera trick just wasn't impressive

[07:17] in the slightest.

[07:18] The game really has nothing else that even comes close to magic.

[07:23] This is another area I was ready to be disappointed about based on online videos, but it was

[07:28] even worse in person.

[07:31] Art is extremely generic.

[07:33] Also where are the magnets that affect gameplay?

[07:35] Yes, it stops the ball for the flipper, but there is no craziness in ball action.

[07:41] Lighting.

[07:42] I'm still scratching my head trying to understand how some people could even compare this game

[07:46] to Waze.

[07:47] Really, the little LEDs that are new to pinball are just that, little lights, and they did

[07:53] nothing for me.

[07:54] In fact, the game seems to be either full seizure mode with all the lights on or just standard,

[08:00] but there isn't that elegant Waze look where it ties to the LCD like todo escaping.

[08:06] I was really disappointed in this area too.

[08:09] It took away from the magical feeling.

[08:11] This includes the umpa lumpum multi ball, which was just pure seizure mode with no finesse

[08:17] to it.

[08:18] By the way, there was what appears to be extra clear on the mylar around the slings.

[08:24] He says overall games like dialed in, which I was disappointed in upon reveal, was a totally

[08:30] different story after getting my hands on it.

[08:32] This game unfortunately is actually worse than I even thought mainly due to the sound,

[08:38] music issues, and it feels just like super wooded down version of what I expect from JJP.

[08:44] It just wasn't special, and for the first time didn't have that wow JJP feeling after

[08:50] the first play.

[08:52] Alright, well look, that was Dell 31's review.

[08:56] Let me read a few more things people are saying about this game, right?

[09:00] There's one thing that someone said here.

[09:05] So this is from user CJM, JMM, 206 or 2006.

[09:11] He says thanks for the assessment dealt.

[09:13] I will add a few things and see what your thoughts are.

[09:15] First I agree 100%.

[09:18] Aside from the magnet stopping the ball, I didn't see any action anywhere else on the

[09:22] field that showed reactions to the magnet.

[09:25] Second, I was not really able to drain out the side of the game.

[09:29] I'm not sure why.

[09:30] Look maybe.

[09:31] Games seem set too easy as far as draining on the outlines.

[09:35] Finally, I tend not to value the sound video on these games until we are at the end.

[09:40] So I am hopeful this game will get its time in the limelight either way, in its current

[09:45] form you are correct.

[09:47] Alright, so wow, that's not good.

[09:51] That's not good.

[09:52] Let's see what else someone says.

[09:55] So this is from JeffRow01.

[09:58] It's so great early reviews.

[10:00] Then again, I tend to be the kind of person who likes cheesy audio and all of that.

[10:05] So having only played it a few times where you really couldn't hear much of anything.

[10:09] I'm still extremely on the fence.

[10:12] It would be nice if JjP would hurry up and at least tell us what the full CE package

[10:16] play field was going to look like.

[10:19] Yeah, where is that?

[10:20] Alright.

[10:21] There was one thing though that someone said that I just want to read too.

[10:26] Let's see.

[10:27] I'm going down the list here.

[10:30] Okay.

[10:32] Here, this is the one.

[10:33] I think this sort of hit the nail on the head and then I'm going to read you some feedback

[10:37] about this from my master who sent me an email.

[10:40] Then I'm going to give you my opinion because I know you listen to this show to hear what

[10:43] can't have things about all this.

[10:45] But this person wrote something that I think really, really is what's been on my mind.

[10:50] Here is what it says.

[10:52] This is from Amuse2Death.

[10:54] And he writes, what blows my mind is that Wanka is a musical and you wouldn't know it

[11:01] by playing this machine.

[11:04] Am I the only one scratching his or her noggin trying to figure out why I can see for Rook

[11:11] Assault singing I want it now but I can't hear her.

[11:16] Wow.

[11:17] Wow.

[11:19] I think that is something that is really poignant and I think it's sort of the perfect

[11:26] way to capture what I've been worried about with this game since I first played it and was

[11:32] hoping they see the code advance but I'm going to talk more about that.

[11:35] I want to read something that I got from my master.

[11:38] Now I'm not going to go into my crazy master voice but I want to read you what he wrote

[11:42] me.

[11:43] Am I master sends me long, long emails that I can't read the whole thing?

[11:50] Alright but I want to read part of what he's saying here and what he's doing is he's comparing

[11:55] two Pat Lawler games and he's comparing Pat Lawler's The Adams family to Willy Wanka

[12:02] and I want to jump in at a point in his note to me and read you his thoughts on his feelings

[12:08] of Willy Wanka.

[12:10] Alright he said Jack will blame something else on Wanka's failures.

[12:16] You know like the license kid not brat Willy Wanka just wasn't a popular enough theme.

[12:23] It didn't have enough fans in the hobby blah blah blah nope.

[12:27] The game was badly designed and without enough toys and the code is weak.

[12:33] Jack will not see anything but what he wants to see.

[12:38] Alright the Adams family.

[12:41] Are there really any die hard Adams family fans out there?

[12:45] I would say no.

[12:46] We all knew the show from reruns when we were kids but there aren't the Adams family

[12:52] fans like Star Wars or Harry Potter fans.

[12:55] The Adams family pinball is the perfect example of how to handle a license theme.

[13:03] Nobody bought the game because they love the Adams family.

[13:07] They bought it because they like the Adams family and the game FN delivered.

[13:13] It has three or four really fun little toys mechs in the game.

[13:18] The fact that you knew the theme combined with the fact that you loved the gameplay meant

[13:23] that it was a crazy seller.

[13:26] It's got five pop bumpers dude.

[13:29] It was well integrated pinball masterpiece.

[13:32] The toys coincide with the parts in the movie.

[13:36] The greed book on the bookshelf revealing a hidden passageway.

[13:41] Thing popping out and grabbing the ball.

[13:43] I mean it just made some simple and fun connections between the movie and the pinball machine.

[13:51] This is why Ghostbusters was such a big seller.

[13:54] There is slimer.

[13:56] Try to hit him.

[13:57] There is a stay puff Marshmallow man, Ectogogles.

[14:00] They nailed it with that one in regards to theme.

[14:04] The flipper width and light and tight shots killed it in the long run.

[14:08] But Ghostbusters is a masterpiece too.

[14:12] Wanka.

[14:13] The everlasting gobstopper spins.

[14:16] Why?

[14:17] It doesn't spin in the movie.

[14:19] It comes out on a little conveyor belt.

[14:22] How about the Wanka Vader?

[14:24] In the movie it shoots out of the ceiling of the factory.

[14:28] What does it do in the game?

[14:30] Nothing.

[14:31] Because it doesn't even look or function like the Wanka Vader.

[14:36] You put balls into it.

[14:37] Why?

[14:38] What else is there that connects the two worlds, pinball and the movie?

[14:43] Nothing.

[14:44] It is literally that simple.

[14:47] Just make the game do a thing or two that the movie does.

[14:51] Imagine if the game had a tiny conveyor belt.

[14:54] Half of it had everlasting gobstoppers and the other half was empty.

[14:59] In the game starts, it sits empty.

[15:03] As you hit each shot to qualify the mode, the conveyor moves a step and a gobstopper appears

[15:09] to come out of the machine.

[15:12] You put out five gobstoppers and you finish the mode.

[15:15] Then the conveyor turns on and the candy roll off of it.

[15:20] It is then reset for the next time you use that mode and make the machine look like the

[15:26] machine.

[15:28] How hard would that have been to do?

[15:30] Oh my god.

[15:31] So effing easy and cheaper than the current toy.

[15:35] And it would feel like the damn game is making everlasting gobstoppers.

[15:40] They don't even need to be big.

[15:42] They can be the side of a pencil eraser and the scale of the machine would have made

[15:47] that seem perfect.

[15:49] Instead we got this.

[15:50] There is a picture of the game.

[15:52] And the Wanka Vader is the same thing.

[15:55] It does not look at all like the movie machine.

[15:58] It doesn't function like it does in the movie.

[16:01] They could have literally just had the machine shake.

[16:04] Then a graphic appear on the screen showing it shooting upwards.

[16:08] And then there is a little hole on the top of the machine.

[16:11] A solenoid fires and a tiny Wanka Vader.

[16:15] The same size as the screen Wanka Vader goes out and then rotates in a circle.

[16:20] So I want to stop right there.

[16:22] How awesome would that have been?

[16:23] If the Wanka Vader shot up through the machine, like it was breaking through the entire backbox

[16:28] of the game and it popped up, how incredible would that have been?

[16:32] Anyway, he then goes on to write that is such an easy mech.

[16:36] One solenoid and a motor to spin it.

[16:38] Instead we have a much more complicated mech that cost a lot more and doesn't even function

[16:45] like the one in the movie.

[16:47] And the code makes it nearly impossible to even use.

[16:50] Can you imagine the thing hand in the admis family was that hard to get to?

[16:56] It would suck because you would never see it.

[16:59] Why does Jack keep doing this?

[17:01] This is why Stern Games sell and J.J.P's don't.

[17:05] Deadpools sword is a ramp.

[17:08] Star Wars long ramp shot balls into the death star.

[17:11] It's no the admis family but at least the mechs have some semblance of the connection

[17:18] to the IP.

[17:19] The Hobbit has four enemy faces that pop up.

[17:23] What if there were just three pop ups and they were the trolls?

[17:27] What if instead of that stupid spinning map on Pirates of the Caribbean, it was Jack's

[17:32] compass and it pointed to the shots you needed to make?

[17:35] What if you were Charlie and you just had to get Wanka bars to unwrap them instead of

[17:41] you are collecting at all five?

[17:44] I could go on and on here.

[17:45] Alright, so look, I'm going to stop there because I think you get the point.

[17:50] I think you get the point of what some people are saying about the game and the experience

[17:54] and expectations and what yada yada yada.

[17:57] There's a lot here and I could go on and on and on.

[17:59] I could read more and more reviews and I've watched many, many streams over the last week

[18:03] because the game is now out there.

[18:04] Now we're about 18 minutes into this podcast and you're like Chris, what are you doing?

[18:09] This podcast has been nothing but you reading other people's opinions about Willy Wanka

[18:14] and so you're reading negative stuff and it's easy to take the negative but where's the

[18:18] positive and I will throw some people are playing the game and saying they're enjoying

[18:21] it and they like it and you know out of all the people in the world, out of all the people

[18:27] in the world, you are the one who got everyone excited.

[18:31] You are the one that hyped everyone saying this was pinball magic that it was going to

[18:35] blow people away that it was a game changer.

[18:38] How are you feeling right now after you read these reviews is all of your credibility lost

[18:43] and I want to talk candidly right now and I know you listen to this podcast because this

[18:47] is what I do.

[18:48] I don't hold back.

[18:50] I don't keep how I feel from you and I don't really care if what I say is unpopular.

[18:56] I don't really care if I change my mind on a game.

[18:59] I don't and I read some people out there on Pinside saying well a certain podcast or who

[19:04] was gushing about this game is now like am I not allowed to change my mind.

[19:09] You want to live in a world in which you are just only allowed to say something and feel

[19:15] something and then you are not allowed to like change the way you feel about something.

[19:19] Now look we all know in pinball it's a unique thing because games evolve, code evolves,

[19:25] but if there is one thing that doesn't change on a pinball game other than the artwork it's

[19:30] the shot geometry.

[19:32] So I still think this is one of the best shooting pinball machines I've shot and I do think

[19:36] the shot geometry is amazing and I think Pat Lawler is a genius at shot layout I do and

[19:42] I think this game is buttery smooth.

[19:44] I think this game is going to be very appealing to shoot for a lot of people because if you're

[19:50] new to pinball or you just like flipping pinball games and you're not great at pinball I think

[19:54] this game is very satisfying and rewarding to flip.

[19:58] And I say this coming from Batman 66 which is a clunk fest in comparison to Wanko and

[20:03] when I jumped on this game at the very beginning it was all about gameplay.

[20:09] I mean I could hear the music and this and that but for the most part the thing that you're

[20:13] most focused on when you first play a pinball machine is the game play.

[20:18] And also when I played the game for the first time I was told the code was like 0.40.

[20:24] So my whole thing was well look I'm happy with the way the game shoots and I thought that

[20:30] the movie would come to life way more in the code as you know the weeks and the months

[20:36] progressed.

[20:37] Okay.

[20:38] I think it's fair to say that you know I've changed my opinion on this game and I want to

[20:48] be honest.

[20:49] I want to be honest about where I'm at because I just watched all the streams.

[20:52] I've seen all the stuff.

[20:54] I'm reading the reviews from people and these people are starting to hit what's been bugging

[20:59] me for the last few weeks on the game.

[21:01] And it comes down to one simple thing one very simple thing.

[21:06] If you love Willy Wonka and you want it to see the movie that you love come to life

[21:12] in the game that you are playing I just don't see it.

[21:17] I don't see how as that person said the musical the heart the soul the things about the film

[21:28] that we absolutely love the iconic scenes it's not there.

[21:35] And I know that's not going to make people happy to hear that but I I don't know what

[21:40] to say at this point how many streams do we have to watch in which we see the video of

[21:47] these characters that we loved pop up on screen with no call outs with no audio synced

[21:54] up to their visuals it just feels like dealt said it it's all mashed together it's

[22:03] all sort of put into a blender it sort of feels like it's a pinball machine inspired

[22:09] by the world of Willy Wonka but it doesn't feel like I'm playing the Wonka movie even

[22:14] though it is based on the Wonka movie.

[22:17] And so I'm just at sort of at a loss of words on how this happened.

[22:23] And it had to have been they don't have the rights to actually use the movie clips with

[22:29] the voices of the actors and that had to have been a money decision because you can buy

[22:37] the rights to those things it just cost money.

[22:40] And so somewhere along the lines the decision was made that we were going to go with this

[22:46] level of assets we were going to invest this much and that would be enough to make Willy

[22:52] Wonka pinball.

[22:54] And it's kind of scaring me that this is like where things are at right now with the

[22:59] theme integration with these Jersey Jack games.

[23:03] I mean how do you make a game and you see the problem is with Jack and again I'm just saying

[23:10] it the problem is we the games were comparing this to were previous Jersey Jack machines.

[23:16] So not just from a mechanical standpoint where was and you know Hobbit and dialed in and

[23:21] pirate the Caribbean which is loaded mechanically.

[23:24] But the real issue for me is look at the Wizard of Oz.

[23:28] They had the right assets to make that game come to life.

[23:33] Same thing with the Hobbit.

[23:35] Now Pirates of the Caribbean is an interesting one because you could easily say well what about

[23:39] pirates Chris like that they don't have any of the assets yes but here's what pirates

[23:43] I think did masterfully.

[23:47] Because they didn't have any of the use of the video it's not as frustrating because

[23:52] you don't see the clips from the movie without their voices.

[23:57] So they found a workaround and they they went all in on that workaround and that to overcompensate

[24:04] for those lack of assets what they did was they they focused heavily on the music and

[24:10] on the callouts and the narrator of Pirates of the Caribbean for the most part saves that

[24:17] game.

[24:18] He saves it.

[24:19] It's done so well and and David's music in Pirates of the Caribbean combined with the narrator

[24:26] actually like almost right it does it saves the game and I think Willie Wonka it's like

[24:34] it's lost it's like in this in between space it doesn't know which direction it wants

[24:40] to go in it's like halfway there and that's the challenging thing for me to like wrap my

[24:46] head around right now is it does feel like when they just didn't know which direction to

[24:53] go with the game it's like you know because the old saying at a site at a mine right because

[25:00] Pirates of the Caribbean doesn't have like all these Johnny Depp clips you're not missing

[25:05] the funny punch lines from those clips but when you show me Varukas salt and you show me

[25:13] all the kids from the game and you show me them in all those rooms but then I don't hear

[25:17] it it's like it has the reverse effect it's like it's insight so I can't get it out of

[25:23] mind what I want to hear during those scenes and it it's just it's a huge issue and not

[25:32] to mention everything my master was saying about how the mechs in the game don't really reflect

[25:38] or connect to the way those things are portrayed in the movie and I have to agree with him I have

[25:43] to agree I mean the stuff is cool I mean don't get me wrong I think what they were going for they

[25:48] really were going for for location play that you would stand over that game and it looks like

[25:53] Willie Wonka I mean though those are Willie Wonka things you know the big stop stop are spinning and

[25:58] it's very attractive to walk up to that machine because of those things I also disagree with

[26:04] Delp I do think the Wonka vision looks really awesome back there I think the game visually when you

[26:09] stand over it is very fun to stand over and I I would happily take the game as it is with those

[26:17] mechs I don't have the biggest issue because I do love shooting the game my biggest issue is that

[26:22] none of what I love from the movie seems to be connected and synced up with the experience of the

[26:27] game itself and everything from the narrator which people are talking about being jarringly bad to

[26:33] the music being you know like a slot machine repetitively bad there's just something that's just

[26:39] it's just not coming together now what does that mean does that mean you never listen to

[26:44] Canada's pinball podcast again because the guy who hyped the machine who who like who's pimping

[26:49] out the machine at the beginning is now saying these things about the game I want to say that I

[26:54] don't ever not want to be excited about a pinball machine and that this game again it just kept

[27:02] going in a direction that was I feel like the wrong direction because I just feel like they need it

[27:08] to approach the integration differently and I'm it's more about the code to me than anything else

[27:15] it's more about the code than anything else so what what does that mean what does that mean now

[27:21] do I think Willy Wonka sales are gonna hurt by this do I think they're not gonna sell the collector's

[27:26] editions let me say this about the collector's edition and as I'm watching people unbox their

[27:32] standard edition games and brag about being the first to have it on the block let me tell

[27:37] let me tell something to everyone out there and I'll use a metaphor and this is real simple metaphor

[27:43] the people who buy first class tickets get on the plane first

[27:51] all right let me repeat that to everyone at Jersey Jack marketing the people who buy the most

[27:56] expensive tickets are the first ones on the plane there's a reason for that it's the same in pinball

[28:04] you want to be sitting there in the front you've already been on board you've been served your drink

[28:09] you you've relaxed everyone who buys a cheaper version has the walk past you knowing that you

[28:16] got it first that is how you need to sell collector's edition games the fact that he wants to sell

[28:24] 500 of them now all the way in the fall is never going to work if he had offered the first 500

[28:33] games or collector's editions he would have sold every single one they would have sold I would have

[28:40] one in my house today it's just that simple and the other thing you don't want to do is give people

[28:48] too much time to rethink their decision because the joy of having the toy the unnecessary pinball toy

[28:56] first will override people's scrutiny of all the things we've been talking about on this podcast

[29:02] they would people would be like you know what I'll get it I'll see if I like it I'll make up my

[29:07] mind then but they would just be so happy to get a new pinball machine from Jersey jack and they

[29:12] would have bought all 500 now if the reviews are not great if people are not feeling it and the

[29:20] L's are out there and people are selling used L's no way no way okay so here's what I think overall

[29:28] has happened I think Jersey Jack has done you know a smart thing by making a game that they can

[29:34] make quickly that they could get into production and get out into the world you know Jack must must

[29:40] look at you know he's putting all this effort into the other games and and you know productions

[29:45] a problem Stern's making all this money which with a much simpler approach on some level jack had to

[29:53] had to scale back a bit lose some of the complexity and get games out into the world they wouldn't

[30:01] survive otherwise and you can't have it both ways you can't want Jersey Jack to continue to try

[30:07] and put everything in the kitchen sink in a game and then watch the company go out of business because

[30:12] that level of complexity and that level of cost was just bankrupting the company it was it and then

[30:18] Stern complete opposite keeps removing stuff and charging more and people are buying you know Jack

[30:25] had to have seen uh that the writing on the wall was there and he had to make a game that was

[30:30] easier to make would have less issues and he could get on the line quicker and it's there so that's

[30:36] a good move uh you know the game itself shoots amazingly well the game itself I don't have a huge

[30:42] issue with the art package I will say this I will say this Pat Lawler's control over there and Pat

[30:49] Lawler's power is hurting the company is hurting the company the reason why the art package on the

[30:57] standard editions is just the is just the logo with nothing else is all because of Pat Lawler the

[31:03] reason why the games have all the part numbers on everything is because of Pat Lawler I mean I mean

[31:08] look he's an incredible designer but he has too much control when it comes to some of those

[31:13] decisions and it's hurting the company hurting the company hurting the company and I don't know

[31:19] what else to say other than that and it just it just feels like over at Jjp there's just like a

[31:25] tug-a-war of power between the investors between Jack between Pat Lawler having the design team in

[31:30] Chicago while Jack and everyone else is in New Jersey is a terrible decision it's a terrible decision

[31:36] you need to make these games all in one location I am not surprised this game feels like a mashup

[31:43] I'm not surprised it doesn't feel synchronized because the company is not synchronized the company is

[31:47] not all in one place you can have your designers off in another state while you're in the in the

[31:53] other factory New Jersey and and you're not walking the hallways together you're not having

[31:57] conversations you're not building the game together you're building it in a silo and then you're

[32:03] bringing it to New Jersey and a lot of the conversations about you know how are we going to progress the

[32:07] game I feel like they're not happening synchronized as what as much as they should you know every other

[32:12] pinball manufacturer all of it happens in one location all of it deeper in one location American

[32:18] pinball one location Stern pinball one location Jersey Jack why why Jack is paying these people the

[32:25] investors are paying these people if you want to work for Jersey Jack pinball your ass needs to be

[32:30] in New Jersey I'm sorry that's just the reality of how it should be to make a more cohesive game

[32:37] the people have to be more cohesive on this all right let's look the reviews are not great

[32:44] you know I got friends who are in a walk you know they're telling me Chris way don't say

[32:47] anything you know wait wait wait how long do we have to wait to give our opinions about these

[32:53] pinball machines you know I'm not going to wait and you know if I want to change my opinion I will

[32:57] if I want to ramble on about how like I don't feel the same level of love as I used to so what I'll

[33:02] tell you it because here's the other thing I want all of you to remember I don't really make

[33:07] money doing this podcast I'm not in this with some agenda to hype up any company I want to see great

[33:15] pinball machines I want to see pinball magic I don't care who it comes from I don't care I still

[33:22] think the greatest pinball magic that we've seen in the last 10 years is the big Lebowski by far

[33:29] I would rather own a big Lebowski than anything else out there on the market that game runs circles

[33:34] around everything else I've seen in pinball the last 10 years circles around it in terms of theme

[33:39] integration in terms of toys in terms of wow factor in terms of art the game is awesome the game

[33:46] is like that is what pinball needs to be more of that that and you look what happened to that right

[33:54] I think most pinball games that have come out have not been magical have missed the mark have

[33:58] something about it that just makes you say and the bottom line 6000 to 12500 dollars for a non-essential

[34:07] you want this thing to be magical I see you guys buying these games left and right buying them

[34:13] before you play them some of you out there have like sweetheart deals with distributors where you

[34:17] get L.E.'s for like 800 hours off street price yes stern your distributors are selling games to a

[34:23] lot of people below cost which sucks because you know what that allows those people to do is like they

[34:30] can sell it to them those people open the game they play them and then they can sell their L.E. and

[34:35] actually make money on it because they got a discount which they're not supposed to do anyway look

[34:41] little dirty secret there in pinball but here's the thing most of you go you guys are buying these

[34:46] games left and right and you want that pinball magic and there's very very very very very few games

[34:52] that have stood the test of time and if you were to ask me the test of time of whether or not a pinball

[34:58] machine is great or not is after the code is done is after everything is said and done and the game

[35:04] is like considered to be finished do you want to own it you know for six months or longer or do you

[35:11] want to get rid of it are you tired of it is it boring is it shallow or the shot's not satisfying is

[35:16] the art terrible it's a hard it's a hard hobby to hit right it's a hard industry to make magic

[35:22] you know and and there's so many available games that's the other part that just is always on my

[35:28] mind as I think about this hobby with all the options out there you know don't don't fall

[35:33] victim to like Gary Stern's like point of view buy what's available now don't wait don't he doesn't

[35:38] want you to look back he doesn't want you to look forward he doesn't want you to look at

[35:42] Valley Williams games he does not want you to look anywhere else but the stern game that he's

[35:47] trying to sell today that is a salesman he doesn't want you to look elsewhere because he knows

[35:52] if you look elsewhere you'll find a more magical game for less money that is more rewarding than

[35:58] the current game he's trying to sell you and that is where pinball is at tons of new games needing

[36:04] new buyers but why do you need to own all these games why do you need to like always run to the next

[36:09] thing and the next thing might not be better than the previous thing and that is how I want to close

[36:15] this podcast and I think that is what frustrates people about willy wonka is we expect pinball games

[36:22] to be like 9-11 porches we expect every new version of the car to be an improvement and enhancement

[36:31] upon the previous model so when willy wonka comes out people are fully expecting it to be better

[36:38] than pirates better than was better than hobbit and and better than dialed in they are expecting

[36:42] it to be everything jersey jack has learned so far and more and to push that envelope and I think a

[36:49] lot of you are looking at the game saying you know what this isn't this isn't an improvement

[36:54] upon where we've been it's just a simpler approach to a jersey jack game so for a lot of you that

[37:01] is why you're walking away I think feeling somewhat disappointed because it doesn't feel like the

[37:06] next step forward it feels more like the safest step forward and this is what they need it to to

[37:14] do to survive and that is all we ever want we just want games to keep getting better and better

[37:20] and better and see new stuff and to just look down at these games and feel like the designers

[37:25] dreamed and innovated something magical and put it into the game and if we don't see that we always

[37:31] sort of like sugar shoulders a little bit inside and say you know what it's good but it's not what

[37:36] I thought about in my head and you know one of my friends you know Ken over at special one late is

[37:42] like we know with nothing lives up to expectations we the games are always better inside our heads

[37:48] and that is true we are ultimately all of us who follow this hobby too closely we are ultimately

[37:54] always disappointed in what the offering is because you know you know something nothing short of

[38:00] like a ball levitating which just won't do it for us but might take away on all of this just to

[38:06] put a little bow on this episode is that willy wanka is out reviews will continue to roll in streams

[38:14] will now happen much more frequently and you out there jump on the machine play the machine

[38:23] make up your own opinion about the game okay I still think the game is going to sell very very

[38:30] well for Jersey Jack I don't think it's going to be a sales flop I still think 95% of people who buy

[38:37] these pinball games they are not on pinside they don't care about code they don't even all they want

[38:44] is something that looks pretty which the game does they want something that lights up which the game

[38:50] does they want something that sounds fun which the game does it has everything that a casual pinball

[38:56] buyer wants it will most likely disappoint the die hard pinball enthusiast that wants more but that

[39:04] is not who this game was designed for this game was designed for location play an immediate

[39:11] gratification for the casual pinball buyer which is the bigger market in terms of buyer base than

[39:18] anything else it is it's rich guys with game rooms who just wants something to throw in there that

[39:24] looks awesome that'll make the wiping kids happy and this game delivers on all of those fronts so

[39:30] I would take all of this negative reviews from the die hard to the grain of salt because it still

[39:35] was a very smart marketing decision to get the willy wonka license do I think they fumbled it a bit

[39:41] yes do I think they missed a golden opportunity to lay a golden egg within pinball and create one of

[39:47] the most magical classical pinball machines of all time yes I think they missed that mark I don't

[39:52] think this game will go down as that do I think pat lawler has too much control absolutely I don't

[39:58] know why he doesn't understand the formula that made Adam's family so successful it's kind of missing

[40:04] here and pat you know again these old guys I think it's time for them to somewhat retire I think

[40:10] they have the geometry down but I don't think they have the magic anymore because I just don't I

[40:15] don't I think it's missing look it's Steve Richie's a magic in black night no you want to call

[40:20] an enhancement a post an enhancement it's a post it's not an enhancement it's a post

[40:27] all right everyone have a good weekend I want to hear from you out there what do you think

[40:31] have I lost all credibility well you no longer listen to canate is pinball podcast there's a lot

[40:36] of other pinball podcasts out there you know but this is this is how I do the show and I will never

[40:42] never hold back on my feelings and if my feelings change even though they make me look like a

[40:49] hypocrite even though they make me look like I lost credibility I don't care I remember once like

[40:54] another podcast or he's no longer doing the show with his co-host used to like oh he says this

[40:58] he says Batman sucks and he buys it like try to paint me as a hypocrite as a flip flopper no I'm a

[41:04] human being my opinions change on a game and you know what I'm never gonna like not say if my

[41:10] opinion changes because I might upset the manufacturer or or it makes me look like you know I change

[41:17] my mind so I change my mind now am I still in on walk up for now I am uh because I want to see what

[41:25] happens but come the fall if it remains the way it is I'm just gonna roll over my thousand dollars

[41:31] and and put it down on like guns and roses or toy story I mean that's it's a refundable deposit
