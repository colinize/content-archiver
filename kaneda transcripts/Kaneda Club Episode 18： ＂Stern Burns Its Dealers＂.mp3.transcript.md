[00:00] It's for camping clothes to you.

[00:03] I settle for the ghost of you.

[00:07] I miss you more than life.

[00:10] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say.

[00:14] Ah, welcome to episode 18 of the Canadian Club, the only place on the planet you can listen to

[00:19] Canadian Spinball podcast.

[00:21] This November, so everybody, welcome.

[00:23] And if you're new to the club, thank you.

[00:25] What took you so long on this episode?

[00:27] We're gonna keep it very specific.

[00:29] I wanna talk about what I think is gonna be the biggest news in the pinball world next year.

[00:34] And that is the very simple fact that Stern Pinball is out of product.

[00:39] They are gonna cut the allotment with each of their distributors and dealers.

[00:43] Cut their allotments, and they are gonna introduce new titles, and they are gonna make you

[00:49] wait so long to get a game that you order the first month the game is ordered.

[00:55] And so they also want to add 25 new dealers to the Stern dealer list.

[01:02] And so Stern Pinball is about to do something that is absolutely bonkers.

[01:07] They're going to screw over the very people that expand it pinball for them.

[01:12] And what they're going to create is an environment that I predicted months ago.

[01:17] It's an environment in which you are going to be very lucky if you're ever able to buy a Stern

[01:24] Ellie machine at MSRP ever again.

[01:28] Because as you cut the allotment of your dealers and your distributors, they now are gonna

[01:34] get less product.

[01:36] So they now are gonna make less money.

[01:38] They now can't expand their business.

[01:41] How do you expand your business when you're getting less games from the company that everybody

[01:47] wants games from?

[01:48] So what they're gonna do is what's happening right now at every single Chevrolet dealership.

[01:53] If you want to get a brand new Corvette, you're gonna pay 30 to 50,000 over sticker for

[01:58] it.

[01:59] If you want to get that Godzilla Ellie and my allotment just got cut.

[02:04] Am I gonna sell it to you for 10, 5?

[02:07] Because now I'm not getting as many Ellie's.

[02:09] It's not just that.

[02:10] I'm not getting as many pros or premiums.

[02:12] So as a dealer and as a distributor, I have two options.

[02:17] I can tell more people know and put less food on my table or I could say to myself, wait

[02:22] a minute, I've got a hundred people that want this game.

[02:26] And does it do me any good will to sell it at MSRP?

[02:30] See the old rationale was this, if I sell it MSRP, I'm gonna get that good will customer

[02:36] to come back time and time again.

[02:38] But what is it matter now?

[02:39] If I'm not gonna get a lot of mints and I'm not getting allocated games, what is it matter

[02:45] if I keep that person coming back and back and back because I'm not even gonna be able

[02:48] to get new product to give to them.

[02:51] And I'm definitely not gonna be able to win new people over.

[02:54] See that's the whole thing.

[02:56] Is when a distributor or a dealer sells you a game at MSRP, it creates great word of mouth.

[03:02] And so then they recommend you to their friends.

[03:05] But the problem now is over the last few years, all of you guys have recommended pinball

[03:10] to your friends and now your friends are going to these distributors and dealers and they're

[03:14] out of product.

[03:16] They can't possibly supply the demand for these pinball machines.

[03:20] They can't.

[03:21] They're out of supply.

[03:22] And so what's gonna happen is this, dealers are gonna say to themselves, well, you know

[03:26] what, Stern is treating us now like they don't even need us to expand pinball.

[03:31] They're using this as like an excuse.

[03:33] Oh, we need to expand pinball by adding new dealers to the list.

[03:37] No, they don't.

[03:38] Why do we need more distributors?

[03:41] Why do we need more dealers?

[03:43] This isn't like you need a showroom to go play these.

[03:46] They know that these games are bought via the internet.

[03:50] But people buy these games before even seeing them, let alone playing them, let alone getting

[03:56] in a car and driving to a dealer to play it in their showroom.

[04:00] I bet going into a showroom and buying a brand new Stern is probably how less than 5%

[04:08] of games are sold.

[04:09] And if you go into a dealer now and you play a game, guess what?

[04:13] You're not getting it for six to eight months.

[04:17] If you put it in order on the first month, Godzilla Premium is available, you're waiting

[04:22] nine months to get your premium.

[04:25] If you ordered Jack Danger's new Jurassic Park home edition, guess what?

[04:29] Unless you get it right now, the next allotment for that is November of 2022.

[04:37] So you don't need more dealers to expand pinball.

[04:40] What they need to do to expand pinball is increase manufacturing, which is crazy to say that

[04:47] Stern pinball at 500 games a week is not nearly enough supply to fulfill the demand.

[04:54] And best believe it, I guarantee you, Stern pinball is looking at the market right now and

[04:59] they are going to expand.

[05:01] They are going to expand because they're leaving so much money on the table.

[05:06] There's a rumor that they have 30 million dollars in orders that they have yet to make.

[05:11] But what we're going to see is this, if you're a distributor and you're a dealer, you have

[05:16] to be looking in the mirror and saying, all right, my only option is this.

[05:21] I can't sell these at MSRP anymore because it's pointless.

[05:24] The goodwill that I'll create is pointless.

[05:27] The goodwill is not going to get you anything.

[05:29] Oh great.

[05:30] So you gave all these pins away at MSRP and then you're watching these guys sell them and

[05:35] scalp them and flip them for thousands more and you don't see a penny.

[05:40] Let's take Godzilla, for example, a thousand available.

[05:43] Let's say you get 10 L.E.'s.

[05:45] Are you going to sell them for $10,500 or are you going to sell them for the market price?

[05:50] And we're going to start seeing that market adjustment happen across the board, but here's

[05:54] the crazy part.

[05:56] I used to think that the market adjustment price was only going to be on the L.E. machines,

[06:00] but that's not the case anymore.

[06:02] We're also going to see market adjusted prices on premiums and pros, especially if the

[06:08] weight to get a premium is nine months.

[06:11] Who the hell wants to wait nine months?

[06:13] And the scariest part is this.

[06:16] Stern Pimbal is not hitting pause on new title releases to make all the games and the back

[06:21] orders they have.

[06:22] They are going to continue to release new titles, which is absolutely a name when you

[06:27] think about it.

[06:28] You can't even make the games that are ordered today.

[06:31] You can't even make the games that have been ordered for the next six months.

[06:34] So why would you release a new title?

[06:37] Why would you release a new title?

[06:39] Why would you release Rush when you can't even make the Mandalorians?

[06:43] Why would you release El Vira 40th if you haven't made the other El Vira orders?

[06:47] The answer is this.

[06:48] It's very simple.

[06:49] It's greed.

[06:50] It's absolute greediness.

[06:52] And they're going to make the L.E. versions of these games a few premiums and a few pros.

[06:58] And then that's it.

[06:59] That is it.

[07:00] It's like they're probably making only like 1500 to 2000 of each title regardless of how

[07:07] hot it is.

[07:09] That's how many they're going to make.

[07:10] And then they're going to move on to something else.

[07:12] And that's how they're going to do it.

[07:13] Because Stern Pimbal, we were used to Stern Pimbal having a portfolio of games on the line

[07:19] at any time.

[07:20] The entire world has turned upside down.

[07:23] It used to be that Stern's dealers and distributors were their sales force.

[07:27] And when you think about what a sales force is doing for you, it's going to be a

[07:30] selling out there and finding new customers.

[07:33] It's going out there and inking new deals.

[07:35] It's going out and getting you orders.

[07:37] The problem now is nobody is a salesman anymore.

[07:41] They don't have to sell you anything.

[07:43] Every game is selling itself.

[07:45] And there are more people throwing money and waving money at these dealers and distributors

[07:50] that they're not a sales force anymore.

[07:52] They now have to determine who gets one.

[07:55] This is more of a lottery than it is a sales force.

[07:58] I need to determine who am I going to hook up and give a deal to.

[08:02] And you're not going to see this below sticker anymore.

[08:05] And for the longest time, all of these people that were getting street prices on their

[08:09] L.E.s and they were getting like a thousand off the MSRP, those days are gone forever.

[08:15] It's not even MSRP days are gone forever.

[08:17] If you get a game at MSRP, congratulations, you just made money.

[08:22] But how can a dealer and a distributor watch this for much longer?

[08:25] It's over.

[08:26] It's absolutely over.

[08:27] And what's also crazy is the days of getting a dealer over, the days of Pimbal machines being

[08:33] affordable are over.

[08:35] It's now a very expensive hobby.

[08:38] And we haven't even come close to seeing the ceiling yet.

[08:41] And if you're a company like Jersey Jack Pimbal, I was thinking about this.

[08:44] If you are a Jersey Jack Pimbal, why wouldn't you sell your next collector's edition direct?

[08:49] Why wouldn't you sell it direct?

[08:51] Why would you hand money to a distributor for the game?

[08:55] You don't need them anymore.

[08:58] I mean this when I say this, you don't need them anymore.

[09:02] If you hire somebody, think about it.

[09:04] Why do you need distributors if you don't need people to go find you new sales?

[09:10] I know this is not a very popular thing because I'm friends with a lot of distributors.

[09:13] But if I'm Jersey Jack Pimbal, why do I need to give games to distributors to find customers

[09:19] when customers have already found us and won us and will pay top dollar and we can put

[09:26] every single penny into our banking account?

[09:29] Now people would argue you need distributors to handle customer service issues.

[09:33] You need distributors to be the liaison between the customer and the company.

[09:38] And my answer to that is why?

[09:40] Why don't you just hire some customer service people?

[09:43] That's all they're doing.

[09:45] If you need to send a tech out, there's a whole network of local techs all over the world.

[09:50] So why exactly do you need a distributor to sell your collector's editions?

[09:55] Why does Stern need distributors to sell its LEDs of its machines?

[09:59] Why?

[10:00] Now I get the reason why Stern uses them with the LEDs because they force those distributors

[10:05] to buy premiums and pros.

[10:07] But Jersey Jack is not like that.

[10:09] They don't do that model.

[10:10] They don't have the three tiered system and they don't do it very effectively.

[10:13] Now if you're Jersey Jack and Toy Story CEO is around the corner and you want to make

[10:18] as much money as possible, why wouldn't you sell them direct?

[10:22] Maybe you sell 500 of them through JJP and 500 through distributors.

[10:26] I think they're going to do something like that.

[10:28] I think we're going to see a thousand Toy Stories, 500 Woody editions and 500 Buzz editions.

[10:33] And that is how they're going to do it.

[10:35] And I think they're going to be $15,000.

[10:37] If Jersey Jack pinball does not price their CEO at $15,000, they're leaving money on

[10:43] the table.

[10:44] Now I've realized over the last few years, this is what I predict it would happen.

[10:47] That this hobby would grow to a point where the industry would realize that the people who

[10:52] buy these machines are very well off.

[10:54] They have a lot of money.

[10:55] They have way more money than these machines cost.

[10:58] It doesn't mean anything to most of them.

[11:00] And we're at the point now where not only are the LEDs out of supply, so are the premiums

[11:05] and so are the pros.

[11:07] And now it's crazy right now.

[11:09] A Deadpool Ellie is now a $15,000 pinball machine.

[11:14] A stranger thing is Ellie $15,000.

[11:17] A Mandalorian Ellie inbox just sold recently for $18,000.

[11:22] $18,000.

[11:25] For a Mandalorian Ellie, the machine is not even good.

[11:29] It's not even a great pinball machine.

[11:31] It doesn't matter.

[11:32] It doesn't matter.

[11:34] And the greatest news about all of this, right?

[11:36] The greatest news about all of this shortage is this is music to the ears if you're American

[11:42] pinball.

[11:43] If you're spooky pinball, if you're anybody else pinball brothers, if you're anybody

[11:48] else making games, P3 multi-morphic get those games in boxes.

[11:53] If you're anybody else and you have anything in a box, it's going to move.

[11:58] Because as we see, if Stern cuts the allocation of their games to each dealer and distributor,

[12:04] guess what's going to happen?

[12:05] They're going to need to fill in that loss of product with something else.

[12:10] And that's why we saw 500 legends of a holo go and 1,750 spooky machines go, no questions

[12:17] asked.

[12:18] No questions asked.

[12:19] Spooky showed you no gameplay, nothing.

[12:22] The games are very, very barren and yet they sold through right away.

[12:26] Why?

[12:27] Because nobody has any inventory.

[12:30] In a world with no inventory and all of these rich collectors and players and again, it's

[12:35] not just collectors.

[12:36] Anyone who wants a new in box pinball machine is banging on the door of their dealer and

[12:41] distributor.

[12:42] Guess what?

[12:43] I don't have anything.

[12:44] I have no food in the restaurant.

[12:46] I have no music on Spotify.

[12:49] If you want to hear a song, you're going to have to pay more money.

[12:52] This is where we're at.

[12:53] The demand is clobbering the supply.

[12:57] Now, Stern is about to screw over the very people, the very people that helped them expand

[13:02] pinball all these years.

[13:04] They're totally going to screw them over.

[13:06] Because now there's nowhere for them to grow.

[13:09] If you're a distributor and a dealer, Stern just cut your ability to get new customers.

[13:15] So here's what I also think they're going to start doing.

[13:18] You're going to start seeing more and more of these dealers and distributors start to

[13:22] buy back games.

[13:24] The same way a car dealership buys your old car back and then flips it for a profit.

[13:31] So if you're Zach many over at flipping out or you're coin-taker, Chris and Melissa or

[13:37] your Nick Parks over at the pinball store, you're going to want as much buy back as you

[13:42] can get.

[13:43] No hassle buy back.

[13:44] We'll pick up the game.

[13:45] We'll give you a good price.

[13:46] And they're going to buy these things back for more than they even sold them to to customers.

[13:52] It is crazy but it's going to happen.

[13:54] If you have a Guns and Roses collector's edition and your distributor gave it to you for

[13:58] 12-5 and he says, hey I'll buy the game back for you for $15,000.

[14:03] Maybe you sell it to him because he gave it to you at MSRP.

[14:06] It's a win-win and then he's going to take that game and go sell it for 18.

[14:10] And maybe people are going to do more of that.

[14:12] But we're going to see a lot more of that because that's the only way these dealers and distributors

[14:17] can have inventory.

[14:19] It sucks to say it but pinball is going to be a lot like the car industry and I know

[14:24] that you guys you hate carguments, hate this but it's happening and we're seeing it right

[14:28] now.

[14:29] And when the hot new game comes out like let's take for example back to the future rumor.

[14:33] Imagine if Stern comes out with a back to the future super Ellie.

[14:37] Do you think they're even going to put a price on it?

[14:40] No.

[14:41] They're going to do exactly what they did with Elvi, or a 40th.

[14:45] They're going to give it to their distributor at some Asinine price and they're going

[14:50] to let them set the price and I'm telling you right now if they made only 88 back to

[14:55] the future super limited edition games.

[14:59] They could sell those in this market only 88 back to the future.

[15:04] You're talking 30 to 50,000 dollars and they would sell out immediately.

[15:09] I get my popcorn out.

[15:11] I'm out.

[15:12] I am so tapped out because I don't think any pinball machine on planet earth.

[15:17] There is no pinball experience on planet earth that is even worth more than 8000 dollars.

[15:24] And I mean that.

[15:25] I've played every single pinball machine that's been out in the last five years.

[15:29] I've played the old classics.

[15:31] I love pinball.

[15:32] I love playing pinball but a pinball experience and playing a pinball machine to me.

[15:39] It's like 8000 dollars.

[15:40] That is more than any game should ever be worth.

[15:43] And yet it's not even that.

[15:45] We're valuing.

[15:46] What are we valuing now?

[15:47] What are we valuing?

[15:49] How is Ghostbusters Elvi now a 15,000 dollar machine?

[15:52] How is Deadpool now 15,000?

[15:54] How is Tron 20,000 dollars?

[15:57] What are we valuing?

[15:58] We're not valuing the game.

[16:00] We're not valuing the experience.

[16:02] We're not.

[16:03] We are simply valuing the scarcity.

[16:05] It's now a commodity.

[16:07] There's only this many in the world and there's this many people that want it equals this

[16:11] price.

[16:12] Now I'm not going to change that.

[16:14] None of my ranting and raving on my show will change that.

[16:17] That's the current pinball marketplace.

[16:19] Do I think it's going to go down anytime soon?

[16:21] No, it's going to get worse next year.

[16:24] Do I think I would sell my collection and cash out?

[16:27] Absolutely I would.

[16:28] And for those of you who are like, well you know what about them being fun?

[16:31] Yeah great.

[16:32] It's fun.

[16:33] But the more I see these prices go through the roof.

[16:36] The more I'm like, guys, these are coin operated machines where you were meant to just take

[16:42] some quarters and have fun for 10 minutes and go home.

[16:46] And now it's no longer cost effective to put these into your homes.

[16:51] Right?

[16:52] And I mean that when I say it, it's no longer cost effective to put these things in your

[16:56] homes.

[16:57] Are you going to play a $15,000 pinball machine 15,000 times?

[17:03] That's the break even point.

[17:05] That's the break even point because if you put 15,000 plays on your game, God bless you.

[17:10] And as I said before, it would be amazing if people put the same number of plays on their

[17:14] games as the game cost.

[17:17] But we're not going to see that.

[17:18] And so I'm here to just tell all of you, I think it's going to be a brutal year for your

[17:23] wallet next year.

[17:24] I think it's brutal news for dealers and distributors that Stern is doing this.

[17:28] And I think the future marketplace of pinball is going to be one in which the prices are

[17:34] going to soar.

[17:35] It doesn't mean the products are going to get much better.

[17:37] This is the scariest part.

[17:39] The products and the innovation are not skyrocketing like the prices.

[17:43] They're not.

[17:44] Look at legends of a hollow.

[17:46] There's like nothing in it, $8400.

[17:49] $8400 for a non-licensed game with nothing in it.

[17:55] And they sold through everyone.

[17:57] Look at Halloween and ultra man, right?

[17:59] Look at those games.

[18:00] You can get those up to $10,000.

[18:04] That's in those games.

[18:05] Seriously.

[18:06] I could do a whole show about how pretty they are, but I couldn't even do five minutes of

[18:11] a show about how there's magical mechs in the game.

[18:14] Or there's toys that are blowing people away.

[18:16] Or there's modes that are wow.

[18:17] No, there's nothing.

[18:19] It's all about the artwork.

[18:20] People just gush about how beautiful pins are now.

[18:23] And then you're like, well, what's actually in it?

[18:24] And you're like, wow, I don't know.

[18:26] You know, some scoops.

[18:28] And come on, there's like no real engineering feat happening in those games.

[18:32] You know, I get it's got multi layers of play fields, but come on.

[18:35] Engineering?

[18:36] Is that an engineering feat these days?

[18:38] But it doesn't matter.

[18:39] It doesn't matter.

[18:40] These games are going to sell through.

[18:42] And that's the bad part for consumers.

[18:45] When things will sell regardless of quality.

[18:48] When things will sell regardless of magic.

[18:51] When things will sell regardless of theme integration, what's going to happen is this.

[18:56] You're going to get less for your money.

[18:59] There's no competition for sales anymore.

[19:02] The only competition happening is a supply chain competition who can get the parts.

[19:08] Whoever can get the parts will win at the end of the day.

[19:11] That's all that's happening.

[19:13] But this current climate kind of sucks.

[19:15] It kind of sucks.

[19:17] And it's going to bleed your wallet.

[19:19] And you're not going to see incredible magic in the games because they know why don't we

[19:23] just take more out and sell them for these high prices.

[19:27] And what else are they going to buy?

[19:28] Because that's really where it's at.

[19:30] What else are they going to buy?

[19:31] There's nothing available.

[19:33] Everybody, this has been KnaiDa Club Episode 18.

[19:36] Thank you so much for your contributions.

[19:38] I really do appreciate it.

[19:39] And we're going to start doing it more like this.

[19:41] I'm probably going to end up doing more club episodes than main episodes.

[19:45] And if that's going to get me to lose your Twippy vote, I really don't care.

[19:49] Because I want to say thank you to those who say thank you to me.

[19:52] And so many people, so many people, tuning into all my Facebook lives.

[19:56] So many people have listened to 650 episodes of KnaiDa Spinball Podcast.

[20:01] And when you ask them for a simple $5 or a month donation for all of that free content,

[20:07] you know what they say?

[20:08] Nope.

[20:09] I'm not contributing.

[20:10] I've got 3 to 4,000 people that enjoy this content.

[20:14] And only 260 people subscribe.

[20:18] So think about that for a moment.

[20:20] And tell your kids because I'm raising Kylian.

[20:22] When you're good at something in life, never do it for free.

[20:25] All that episode 18, finito.
