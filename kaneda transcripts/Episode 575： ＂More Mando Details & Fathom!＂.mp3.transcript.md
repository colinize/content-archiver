[00:00] Here comes the young step up, bird around, I'm the living cup young, so bird around,

[00:04] Big up the green on the area, bird around, still living like that.

[00:08] Bird around, bird around, bird around, bird around, bird around, bird around, bird around,

[00:12] Happy Monday morning, Canadian calls it again.

[00:15] Fathom Pinball was announced today by Haggis Pinball over in Australia.

[00:19] We're going to talk about that.

[00:20] I'm going to share with you, never before heard details about the Mandalorian Pinball

[00:26] machine from Stern Pinball, which is coming up next.

[00:29] For those of you out there that think Canadian is going to be wrong on this one, I promise

[00:34] you it's Mandalorian, it's coming, it's coming, this huge theme is coming out in Pinball

[00:40] format.

[00:41] Will it be the greatest Star Wars Pinball machine of all time?

[00:45] The bar is not too high with Star Wars pins, it's not.

[00:48] Now I think this one's going to come down to one question and one question alone.

[00:52] Who's coding this game?

[00:53] We're going to talk about that and we're also going to talk about spooky pinballs next

[00:57] because now the question mark becomes what is the next spooky because it's not Scooby

[01:03] Doo and what will it be?

[01:05] Now it's back in the realm of it's a movie and it's somewhat of a horror themed movie.

[01:10] So what do we think it's going to be from spooky pinball?

[01:13] How can they follow up Rick and Morty?

[01:15] Let's talk about Fathom first and foremost.

[01:17] So, Canada was the first media outlet to break the rumor.

[01:21] The scoop happened on my Facebook page if you follow Canada and there was a pin side

[01:25] thread that we said that Fathom was being revisited.

[01:28] Now did we spoil anything?

[01:30] I saw someone complaining, he's spoiled all of their hard work.

[01:34] Really?

[01:35] 12 hours scoop on a new pinball machine and the rest of the world doesn't give a crap.

[01:39] It's not spoiling any hard work.

[01:41] Did I reveal anything?

[01:43] Did you see anything?

[01:44] Did I spoil their details?

[01:46] No, I'm going to give you more spoilers with Mandalorian than I did with Fathom.

[01:50] But let's read some of the things happening with this game and give you my thoughts about

[01:54] Haggis pinball remaking Fathom.

[01:56] Alright, so we got some beautiful glossy images of this Fathom machine prototype.

[02:02] It's all crammed out with the armor.

[02:04] There's a beautiful chrome coin door.

[02:07] First and foremost, if you like Fathom, this is the most beautiful looking Fathom machine

[02:12] I've ever seen and I've seen older Fathoms and so if this is the game for you then you

[02:16] are very happy when you hear that Haggis pinball is bringing this game back.

[02:20] Now I did see on Facebook that some people had recently bought a Fathom and they're like,

[02:26] damn it, I wish I knew this was coming out.

[02:28] And there isn't an argument to be said about that.

[02:31] Everybody wants to keep every title of secret but ultimately us as a community keeping

[02:37] a title secret that we know might be coming out.

[02:41] Who does that benefit?

[02:42] Think about it.

[02:43] Who does it benefit keeping a title a secret?

[02:46] It benefits only the manufacturers.

[02:48] It doesn't help out other people in the community.

[02:51] It doesn't help people out who might not want to spend their money on this game if they

[02:55] knew that other game was coming out.

[02:57] So why is it as a community?

[03:00] We're always looking out for the companies and not the community.

[03:05] And that is why on Canadian pinball podcast I have no shame in telling you what new titles

[03:12] I hear are coming out from these manufacturers.

[03:14] And if I knew it was Fathom two weeks ago would I have said it?

[03:17] Yes, if I knew it was Fathom a month ago would I have said it?

[03:21] Yes.

[03:22] The same way I told you Mandalorian three weeks before the games even coming out.

[03:26] Because I think you deserve to know what's happening.

[03:29] You get to know what movies are coming.

[03:31] You know what cars are coming.

[03:32] You know what video games are coming.

[03:34] But yet with this purchase, with pinball in general, you don't know what's next around

[03:39] the corner because they only want you to buy what's available today.

[03:42] Look, that benefits stern.

[03:44] It allows them to create FOMO because if you knew that Mandalorian was after Avengers

[03:49] you might not buy Avengers.

[03:51] And if you knew that Mandalorian was coming you might not buy Led Zeppelin.

[03:55] And vice versa you might be a huge Led Zeppelin fan and you might have passed on Avengers

[04:00] and so and so and so it goes.

[04:02] But look it's to Stern's benefit to keep it all quiet.

[04:06] And Canadian pinball podcast will always be a podcast for the people not for the manufacturers.

[04:12] I don't care about these manufacturers plans.

[04:15] I don't.

[04:16] I want to give you the news so you can make the most educated decision.

[04:20] So you have enough information on what to go on.

[04:23] So you put your pinball money where you want it to go.

[04:26] And I'm always going to be the pinball podcast for the people.

[04:29] Okay, back to this machine.

[04:31] It looks beautiful.

[04:32] It absolutely looks stunning.

[04:35] I'm looking at it with the two screens in the apron.

[04:37] I think that's a nice little modern touch with these modern lights.

[04:41] What the rest of it is the fathom you know and love.

[04:44] So let's go into a little bit about fathom and then we're going to go into the Mandalorian

[04:48] details.

[04:49] So there were 3500 fathom units produced in 1981.

[04:53] That begs the question with 3500 fathoms out there.

[04:58] Is there still a demand for this title?

[05:01] Now the question is with a game that's 40 years old 3500 of them out there.

[05:06] Now 40 years.

[05:08] A lot happens to pinball machines.

[05:10] Nobody was really collecting pinball machines in their homes in 1981.

[05:14] So most fathoms out there are probably routed.

[05:18] They're probably not in great condition.

[05:21] So if you wanted to find a fully restored fathom, you're looking at a pretty pricey machine.

[05:27] We're going to talk about the price of this.

[05:29] But the first thing is demand is the demand there for more fathoms in the world.

[05:34] Now when we get to the amount that Haggis is going to make, it's not a ton of them.

[05:40] So I do think their supply will pretty much correlate with the demand of this game.

[05:46] But for people out there too who have not even thought about fathom, the fact you might

[05:50] be able to get a brand new one, new inbox, actually makes it a lot more appealing than

[05:57] rolling the dice on a game from 1981.

[05:59] That's the other part too is I think while some people might not want older games, if

[06:04] they can get a brand new manufactured remake of an older game, that's more appealing

[06:09] to them.

[06:10] And they want the latest and the greatest with as much updated stuff in the game as possible.

[06:15] It's why people love CGC remakes.

[06:17] You could always go get the originals, but the remakes are just that good and then that

[06:22] much better.

[06:23] Alright now here's the elephant in the room, the price and the production of this machine.

[06:29] They're going to make two versions of this game, the classic edition, which is $7,360

[06:36] USD and the mermaid edition, which is a staggering $8,900.

[06:44] Now is that a good price or is that a bad price for this game?

[06:48] And to order your game, you need to put down a $1,500 Australian deposit that's non-refundable.

[06:56] Here we go again with the non-refundable approach to these games and I think it is smart

[07:02] because these companies need to lock in real orders.

[07:06] When companies were doing refundable deposits, it basically made it impossible for a manufacturer

[07:13] to know how many parts do I need to order.

[07:16] And if I get non-refundable deposits, I don't know because people could just bail at the

[07:20] last minute and people were doing that.

[07:22] You also open the door for a ton of speculators and flippers to come through your door who

[07:28] have no intention of taking the game.

[07:31] They just simply want to be in on it because then they'll try to sell it to somebody else

[07:35] and pay the deposit when they have a new buyer lined up.

[07:39] So if you give a non-refundable deposit, I think that's trying to weed out those people

[07:44] and only get people through the door who are serious about owning the machine.

[07:49] Let's talk about the price and how many they can make.

[07:51] So it's as manufacturing a schedule to begin on July 1st with the plan to build 50 per

[07:57] month at the new facility.

[07:59] Now 50 per month is a lot for Haggis Pimbal.

[08:04] Are they building 10 or more a week?

[08:06] Now remember, 10 is how many games Spooky Pimbal was saying they would make of Rick and Morty's

[08:13] when they took Rick and Morty orders.

[08:15] So is Haggis Pimbal at the efficiency levels of a Spooky Pimbal?

[08:21] I have a hard time believing they are there.

[08:24] There's no way Keltz even sold like 50 games.

[08:28] So how do they know they're going to be able to make games at that rate starting July 1st?

[08:34] Now there is a two month ramp up to getting to there but I hope they can hit this number

[08:40] because if people place orders, because here's what they're going for, they said they're

[08:43] going to make 250 mermaid editions.

[08:46] So if you say 250 and 50 a month, that means if you order a mermaid edition of this game,

[08:54] you expect to get your game within 5 months of July 1st.

[08:58] Will that happen?

[09:00] Now I don't know.

[09:01] I don't know.

[09:02] I hope it happens.

[09:03] But if history has shown us anything, it's that these companies when they put dates

[09:08] out, when they put numbers out of how many they're going to make, they rarely hit that

[09:12] number.

[09:13] And Haggis to me is just too new of a company to really take them at face value with

[09:19] a number like that.

[09:20] It's not an overly ambitious number, right?

[09:22] This isn't some crazy deeproot proclamation that we're going to ship more games in one

[09:26] year than every manufacturer combined.

[09:29] And it is absolutely comical that Haggis pinball has now lapped deeproot pinball.

[09:34] They're now on to game number two.

[09:36] They've successfully shipped game number one in a box.

[09:38] They're making deeproot look funny, which is kind of so crazy to me that these nice

[09:43] gentleman in Australia, Damien and his team, they're very humble, they're very nice,

[09:47] and they're just getting it done.

[09:49] Now whether or not they're making a game for you, that's a question in your head.

[09:53] And look, Celts is not for me.

[09:54] I don't think Celts is almost for anybody.

[09:56] I don't understand why they started with Celts, but they learned how to make a pinball

[10:00] machine with Celts.

[10:02] The same way that spooky pinball learned how to make a pinball machine with America's

[10:06] most haunted, both games are kind of terrible for each company, respectively.

[10:11] But now they know.

[10:13] And that's the thing is like deeproot just never learned how to make a game.

[10:17] And now they have to learn with Raza, which costs them millions to get to.

[10:20] It costs them so much money to get to Raza, but this is the right way to do it because

[10:24] the other part about releasing fathom and not some original game right now is they know

[10:30] there's a built-in audience for this.

[10:33] They didn't have to waste money on any R&D.

[10:36] This is a very smart move for Haggis.

[10:39] Now let's talk about the price.

[10:40] Do I think they will sell all 250 at $8,900?

[10:45] And a year ago I would have said this is crazy.

[10:48] That's the price of a Sternle.

[10:50] And this game doesn't have modern features in it.

[10:53] It's not a modern game.

[10:54] It's not the kind of pinball people are gravitating towards right now.

[10:58] Now fathom is a really fun game, but it's an old style of playing pinball.

[11:03] It's much different than what people expect with these modern games with modern displays

[11:07] and modern rule sets.

[11:08] And I get there, they're going to have like a 2.0 rule set in this.

[11:12] But 9 grand is a hard pill to swallow for a lot of people out there when you look at

[11:17] what's available for 9,000.

[11:19] Now a year ago I would have said this is crazy, but a lot has happened in a year.

[11:26] And if you look at where pinball prices are going and if you look at the absurdity of

[11:31] what people are spending on pinball machines, I might be able to confirm for you today that

[11:35] a Toronto lease sold for more than $20,000.

[11:38] So because we're living in crazy world pricing in the pinball landscape to get a new inbox

[11:44] game like this in which there will only be 250 of them.

[11:49] And these will be the nicest 250 fathoms quite possibly on planet earth out of the 3100

[11:55] that were previously made.

[11:57] To be one of 250, I think they're going to sell everyone.

[12:01] And I think this is a smart move.

[12:03] And I think people who look at this game and look at this company and look at Haggis

[12:08] and who's behind it will not have a problem supporting these gentlemen.

[12:13] And that's the other part is Damien is a great guy.

[12:16] This company is made up of great people.

[12:19] So there's a lot of good will.

[12:21] So for all of these rich people out there who want to support new pinball companies and

[12:26] support boutique pinball, when you order this game from Damien, you're not worried you're

[12:32] not going to get your game.

[12:34] You know you're going to get your game.

[12:35] You're not worried about who you're supporting because that's a huge part of this.

[12:41] Spooky pinball is successful not because the games are the best because the company is

[12:47] one of people's favorite companies.

[12:49] People love to root for the success of spooky.

[12:52] They've always been a part of the community and they've always had such good will and

[12:56] that good will goes such a long way when it comes to getting customers to feel good about

[13:02] buying from you.

[13:03] A spooky pinball machine is now around 8 to 9000 dollars and they're selling out in

[13:08] four hours.

[13:09] So I fully expect the pinball community to say, you know what?

[13:12] I support these guys.

[13:14] I support what they're doing.

[13:16] This machine looks beautiful.

[13:17] I'm going to order one and no one's going to feel bad about it.

[13:20] Nobody's going to feel bad about it.

[13:22] Nobody felt good about ordering Raza.

[13:24] Nobody feels good about Deeproot because they eroded all the good will from the community.

[13:29] And that's marketing 101.

[13:32] That's public relations 101.

[13:34] You want to be in a good standing with the target audience that you're trying to sell

[13:39] your products to.

[13:41] It's that simple people.

[13:43] Pinball buyers want to feel good about the company they're buying from.

[13:48] They feel good when they buy from Stern.

[13:50] They feel good when they buy from Jersey Jack.

[13:52] They feel good when they buy from spooky and now we're going to add.

[13:55] They're going to feel good when they buy from Haggis.

[13:57] Now look, Haggis might have some delays.

[13:59] I think Damien and company will be very transparent when they start to make this game on where

[14:06] things are going and how things are looking with production.

[14:08] I don't think they're going to go radio silent.

[14:11] They didn't promise games six to eight weeks from July 1st.

[14:14] They just said we're looking at this and we should start on this date.

[14:18] Let's go over the game Matrix sheet and then I'm going to go over some new Mandalorian

[14:21] features for you guys.

[14:23] Okay.

[14:24] So the enhanced Mermaid or Classic Edition.

[14:25] It has original sounds and callouts from the original machine.

[14:29] Has the original art by Greg Ferris.

[14:32] Haggis proprietary dimple free play field technology.

[14:36] That's music to everybody's ears.

[14:37] This game is going to look perfect forever.

[14:39] It has a tool list, head box locking mechanism and a new color, fathom, comic sign by Haggis

[14:46] team.

[14:47] Well, whatever.

[14:48] We don't need comic books when we buy pinball machines, but whatever.

[14:50] All right.

[14:51] What you get, you get a cabinet mounted 3.5 display for service menu in the classic

[14:56] edition.

[14:57] You get full RGB LEDs in both editions.

[15:01] You get full RGB seven segment score displays in both editions.

[15:05] You get brushed stainless steel trim in the classic.

[15:09] I'm not sure what's on the mermaid.

[15:10] Let's keep going on this.

[15:12] Brush stainless steel play field components.

[15:14] That's also the classic single six speaker, original rule set in the classic and enhanced

[15:20] rule set.

[15:21] You will get with new callouts and music in the mermaid edition.

[15:25] Here are all the mermaid things now mirrored stainless steel trim mirrored play field components.

[15:31] Custom five speaker 1000 watt sound system.

[15:35] Reflecto cabinet metallic reflective luminescent cabinet art.

[15:38] Dual apron integrated 6.8 inch LCD screens and ambient below cabinet lighting.

[15:44] All right.

[15:45] There's 15 drop targets in this game.

[15:48] Wow.

[15:49] Wow.

[15:50] Wow.

[15:51] Three flippers, three pop bumpers, a spinner, two kick out holes.

[15:53] I'm not going to go over all this stuff in the game.

[15:55] There's a great interview on this week in Pimball with Damien.

[15:58] I'm not going to read it.

[15:59] I think you should go there.

[16:00] There's going to be a great interview with Damien on the Pimball profile with Jeff T.

[16:04] All this.

[16:05] So you should definitely check that out.

[16:07] But I think this is a good move for these guys.

[16:09] I think it's a smart move.

[16:11] I think they're super smart.

[16:12] And this is not just the end of it.

[16:14] Did you read?

[16:15] They're going to do five classic ballet games.

[16:19] Talking with original titles by Haggis Pimball.

[16:23] So this was smart.

[16:24] This was a really smart move.

[16:26] I think them making these remakes gives them a built in audience.

[16:31] Them making original titles was most likely going to end with nothing but sales flops.

[16:36] I got to be honest.

[16:38] It's going to be really hard to make original IP games from Haggis.

[16:42] They need license themes.

[16:45] Nobody wants games like Celts.

[16:47] I don't feel like a jerk saying that.

[16:49] Their sales numbers indicate that.

[16:50] I think this is what they should do.

[16:53] And if they're going to make money off of this, use that profit to invest in a license

[16:59] theme people want.

[17:00] And then go design an original game based on a license theme people want.

[17:05] They can do it.

[17:06] They definitely can do it.

[17:08] Now the elephant in the room is this.

[17:10] What is shipping like from Australia?

[17:13] We usually hear about it the other way around.

[17:16] Games have to ship to Australia and Australians have to pay so much more money for the games.

[17:21] And that is not great for Australians.

[17:24] But we've never had to buy a game from Australia and ship it to the US.

[17:29] Now there are enough Pimball fanatics.

[17:31] Here's what I think is going to happen.

[17:33] There's enough Pimball fanatics in Australia.

[17:36] And the prices that Australians have to pay for games is ridiculous.

[17:40] It's ridiculous.

[17:42] I think the majority of these games are going to sell in Australia alone.

[17:46] And when you look at Pimball enthusiasts per capita, there are more Pimball people who love

[17:51] Pimball per capita.

[17:52] I think in Australia than even in the United States.

[17:56] So that begs the question.

[17:58] This could be really hard to get one in the US.

[18:02] So if you're in the US and you want this game, I wouldn't move pretty quickly because

[18:06] I do think these are mostly going to be spoken for on a local level.

[18:10] And I think you're going to see the Australian Pimball community step up and show support for

[18:15] their local company.

[18:17] But this is the kind of game that they won't be embarrassed to step up and buy.

[18:20] I mean, let's be honest people, if you bought Celts, you're embarrassed to show that game

[18:25] off on some level.

[18:26] I mean it.

[18:27] I mean it.

[18:28] Come on.

[18:29] This you won't be embarrassed to put into your collection.

[18:31] Okay.

[18:32] I'm sorry Damien.

[18:33] I mean, I got to call a spade of spade when it comes to Celts, man.

[18:35] You should have called Canada and said, hey, we're thinking of making Celts.

[18:39] This is it.

[18:40] And I'd be like, nope, nope, nope, nope.

[18:41] I would have just said no to it all.

[18:42] Nope, start over.

[18:43] Give me another idea.

[18:44] Throw that thing in the garbage.

[18:45] Something else.

[18:46] I can't wait to see what game number two is that they're doing.

[18:49] But maybe they should reach out to Canada and ask them, should we make this theme?

[18:52] Because I will tell you for free whether it will work or not.

[18:56] But this is a good move.

[18:57] So congratulations to everyone over there.

[18:59] All right.

[19:00] You ready for some Mandalorian details, people.

[19:01] Canada's Pimball podcast.

[19:02] Don't stop.

[19:03] We don't take breaks.

[19:04] We don't put up tombstones.

[19:06] We don't tell you.

[19:07] We're going to come back when there's a new game revealed.

[19:08] Okay, so where are they now?

[19:09] Where are they?

[19:10] Where's the new show?

[19:11] Because I thought they're only coming back when there's a new game revealed.

[19:14] Uh oh, Canada did it again.

[19:16] He's delivering the news to you guys when the news happens.

[19:18] All right.

[19:19] Five Twippies coming.

[19:20] All right.

[19:21] You ready for this?

[19:22] Mandalorian details you do not know for sure.

[19:24] So the number one thing I'm going to say today is this.

[19:28] The art package for the Mandalorian will be done by Mr. Randy Martinez.

[19:33] You know his work on the comic book edition of the Star Wars Pins.

[19:37] He made those pens look much nicer.

[19:40] So that answers the question of who's doing the artwork.

[19:43] It's not zombie Eddie.

[19:44] Now here's the thing about the Mandalorian.

[19:47] I hope it doesn't look as bright and colorful as that art package that's on the Star Wars

[19:53] comic book edition.

[19:55] I just feel like that's a little bit more lunch boxy looking.

[19:59] I do.

[20:00] I think Mandalorian is a little bit darker.

[20:03] It's a little bit warmer.

[20:04] It's a little bit.

[20:05] It's hard to explain.

[20:07] But when I look at Mandalorian artwork and the artwork from the show, it's not that super

[20:12] bright sort of comic book style.

[20:15] So I know Disney loves Randy and I know he did a really cool art package for the Star Wars

[20:21] machines.

[20:23] But is he the right artist for the Mandalorian?

[20:25] I don't know.

[20:26] I need to see it.

[20:27] Right.

[20:28] Art is so subjective.

[20:30] But he knows how to draw Star Wars.

[20:32] Don't get me wrong.

[20:33] The title isn't always the same as the one we saw on those other Star Wars games.

[20:37] So I have very good faith that Disney and Randy will do the Mandalorian art package

[20:44] justice.

[20:45] So that's who is doing the artwork on the game.

[20:48] Now what's going on in this game?

[20:50] What are some gameplay features?

[20:52] So I told you there's an upper play field.

[20:54] But I'm hearing the upper play field in the Mandalorian.

[20:58] It has flippers on the upper play field and it rotates.

[21:02] And it's got six drop targets I'm hearing and lights.

[21:06] And so I don't know.

[21:07] Think about that.

[21:08] What could a rotating upper play field be that has flippers that you have to shoot six

[21:13] drop targets?

[21:14] I don't know.

[21:15] Stars to sound really cool like something spinning up there.

[21:18] Is that going to be the casers?

[21:19] Can they be going to be wrong?

[21:20] But here's the thing.

[21:21] If can a is wrong, I'll admit it.

[21:23] But that's what I'm hearing is the upper play field on Mandalorian.

[21:27] I'm also hearing that there is a ship in the game.

[21:31] There's the Mandalorian ship and then there's slave one that Boba Fett uses.

[21:35] Now I think that this game is going to be based on season one and probably not season

[21:42] two, which does kind of suck because Boba Fett doesn't make an appearance until season

[21:47] two and Luke Skywalker doesn't make an appearance until season two.

[21:51] But if we look at season one and just overall like the Jedi don't really make any appearances

[21:56] in season one, it's season two that really has more of I think the wow moon.

[22:01] There's moments in the show, but that being said, there is going to be a ship in the

[22:06] game that has a target that hangs down from it.

[22:10] When you shoot the target, a ramp drops down.

[22:14] That's what I'm hearing.

[22:15] How cool does that sound?

[22:17] What if you shoot the target enough times the ramp comes down and then you shoot the ramp

[22:21] to lock the ball inside the ship?

[22:24] So much of the show is about getting back to the Mandalorian ship and getting off the

[22:28] planet when trouble ensues.

[22:31] That would be super, super cool if that's in the game as well.

[22:35] So there you go, three new details from Canadian pinball podcast about the Mandalorian.

[22:40] Alright, let's finish this show and talk about spooky pinball real quickly because we know

[22:45] it's not Scooby Doo.

[22:46] Now we're back to guessing and it's supposedly a movie.

[22:50] I heard from someone over there, it's a mainstream movie title that people are going to like.

[22:54] So what is it?

[22:55] Is it Friday the 13?

[22:56] Is it evil dead?

[22:58] Is it big trouble in Little China?

[23:00] I wish it was, but that's not a horror movie.

[23:02] Is it Gremlins?

[23:03] Ah, that's not a really horror movie.

[23:05] Is it Beetlejuice?

[23:07] We keep hearing that maybe it could be Beetlejuice.

[23:09] I still think Beetlejuice is the game that Ben Heck is making with Christopher Franchi.

[23:13] I'm not sure about that.

[23:15] Nobody's sure about this stuff, but I feel like Beetlejuice is coming.

[23:18] Is it going to be saw?

[23:20] What else could it be?

[23:21] You know, there's so many horror movies out there.

[23:23] What do you think it is?

[23:24] I want you to email me at canadapinballatgmail.com and let's discuss what we think

[23:30] Spooky's follow up will be to Rick and Morty.

[23:33] Now we hear they're making 1,000 of these games.

[23:36] You know, it's going to be a hard follow up.

[23:38] It really is.

[23:39] Rick and Morty was so universally loved when people heard about it, but I expect this

[23:44] game to do really well for Spooky.

[23:45] I just do is as I was saying, with the goodwill Spooky's built up with consumers, Spooky's

[23:50] at the point where unless they release a total dog, they're going to sell everyone.

[23:55] Charlie knows he's in a really good situation and it's great because I think there's a lot

[23:59] of momentum and enthusiasm around Spooky Pinball and now I hope they pick titles that really

[24:06] sing to the community because I think at the beginning, Chuck and Bug were making games

[24:11] for themselves.

[24:12] I really do.

[24:13] I think Charlie and Bug were making games that they wanted to make, that they wanted to

[24:17] own.

[24:18] They weren't really thinking about, well, what would other people love to own?

[24:22] And they were just sort of banking that people would like the campiness that was their personality.

[24:26] And I think they've seen now, well, if we go a little bit more mainstream, we go a little

[24:31] bit more pop culture, we're going to have much greater success, right?

[24:35] You don't have to spend a year trying to sell a game.

[24:39] If you hit the right theme at the right time, the game will just sell out immediately.

[24:44] And with the competition now for people's dollars and people's space, I think you need

[24:49] a title that has more of that gravitational pull.

[24:52] And I think they know what they're doing now.

[24:53] I really do.

[24:54] I don't expect them to release another dog ever.

[24:57] I think they understand what people want.

[25:00] I think they understand how fast they can make games.

[25:04] And I think they understand that goodwill will continue to propel this company forward.

[25:09] And they will continue to grow a thousand titles.

[25:12] I think we will one day see spooky pinball making two thousand titles.

[25:16] I think they're going to keep expanding.

[25:17] We see they're already expanding their location there in Wisconsin.

[25:22] And that's what success does.

[25:24] That's how you build a pinball company, deep root pinball.

[25:27] You don't just build studios that design stuff.

[25:31] You build a manufacturing facility.

[25:34] You slowly increase the size of it as your orders increase.

[25:38] You don't write verbal checks that your company's manufacturing can't cash.

[25:43] Okay.

[25:44] Mid-May is coming, deep root.

[25:46] Mandalorian is on your heels.

[25:47] I can't wait to hear the next update about Raza.

[25:52] Those were about to see Brian Eddie's Mandalorian.

[25:55] Now the final question.

[25:56] There's only one thing that can tank our love for Mandalorian.

[26:00] There's only one thing that everyone's nervous about.

[26:03] And everyone knows what that is.

[26:05] Who's going to code this game?

[26:07] And people are praying.

[26:08] I mean it.

[26:09] People are on their hands and knees praying to the pinball gods that it's not Dwight doing

[26:13] this game.

[26:15] Dwight, you had your chance with the Star Wars.

[26:17] It was a swing and a miss.

[26:19] If coded by someone other than Dwight could end up being the greatest Star Wars pinball

[26:26] machine of all time.

[26:28] And sorry Dwight, you had your chance.

[26:30] You had your chance.

[26:31] You got to work Dwight with the best source material in the Star Wars catalog.

[26:37] The best source material in the history of Star Wars, you got a chance to make the game

[26:41] the way you wanted it.

[26:43] And it just is not what you do with Star Wars.

[26:45] You don't make it all about multipliers and all this stuff.

[26:49] You lost the narrative.

[26:50] And so I hope Stern gives this to somebody new and gives Brian Eddie a game that on day

[26:57] one people love.

[26:59] Not this stranger things a year later.

[27:01] We're now appreciating it.

[27:02] No, I hope Brian Eddie has a day one juggernaut.

[27:07] We're going to see in just a couple of weeks.

[27:08] It's coming soon.

[27:09] May 11th is what I'm hearing.

[27:10] May 11th Star Wars, the Mandalorian, Brian Eddie, Randy Martinez.

[27:16] Who knows who on code?

[27:18] Upper play field, a ship with a target and a ramp that pops down.

[27:22] Lots of cool stuff.

[27:23] Great time to be in Pimbal.

[27:25] Congrats to everyone at Haggis.

[27:26] You guys are doing it.

[27:28] You're doing it.

[27:29] I might not buy every game you make, but I'm glad you guys are doing it right and you're

[27:32] listening to what you need to do to make a successful bootie company.

[27:36] Get off the ground.

[27:37] Great time to be in Pimbal.

[27:39] Everybody have a great week.

[27:40] We'll talk to you soon.
