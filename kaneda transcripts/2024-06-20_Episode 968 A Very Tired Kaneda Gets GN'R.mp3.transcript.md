[00:00] You and the Jungle, baby!

[00:02] We are...

[00:05] TRIED TO DIE!

[00:16] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast. It has been a jungle of a week.

[00:21] I can tell you know that I'm exhausted. To do all this at once, a new baby,

[00:28] move to a new house, in a new state, get two new cars, add your three and a half year old

[00:35] pinball machine into the home, have to lug it up a flight of stairs without a dolly.

[00:42] We're gonna talk about what a crazy week it's been for Canadian Spinball Podcast. I am at the

[00:47] point now where my batteries are empty, but I'm still gonna do a show. I want to say welcome

[00:53] to Canadian Spinball Podcast. To Dan Keller, to Mike Penrosa, we've got Dave in the house, Dave D.

[01:01] Krom, we've got Brett, we've got Zoe, we've got Pat's Arcade, we've got the Clown Puncher.

[01:08] That's an interesting name for Canadian Spinball Podcast. But everybody welcome to the show and

[01:13] I'm so happy to be doing this show right now and looking over my shoulder and seeing this beautiful

[01:22] Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition number 500, which me and Derek Musket, who by the way,

[01:30] if you need a pinball machine moved in the east coast of America, please consider Derek Musket.

[01:36] Now he moves one game at a time. It like fits into his tiny Honda Fit, but Derek and I successfully

[01:45] moved this incredibly heavy Guns N' Roses game up a flight of stairs and here's how the day went.

[01:52] And I just want to explain how we went from moving a pin in at seven o'clock in the morning to

[01:59] Canada fumbling over his game, trying to figure out how to update the code, destroying his record

[02:07] on the game itself. I've got more records coming in than I know what to do with. Thank you so much

[02:12] everybody. And at the end of the day, in one of the most exhausting days in my adult life,

[02:19] the thing I learned, a few things I learned yesterday, first and foremost, when you get a new

[02:24] pinball machine, just enjoy it for a few hours. That's it. Don't do anything. Don't add stuff to it.

[02:32] Don't rush to add mods and do all these changes. Just turn it on and enjoy it. I did not do that.

[02:42] Okay, so we're going to get to that lesson I learned. I also learned a lesson that if you're

[02:47] going to move a pinball machine up a flight of stairs, make sure you hire someone who's like

[02:53] six, four, like Derek, make sure you've been going to the gym for a bunch of years because I will

[03:00] tell you this, the way we did it, we got the game into the ground floor and there maybe was just a

[03:05] few inches between the end of the staircase and the window. And we basically had to lean it over

[03:12] without a dolly and go one, two, three, lift and get it onto one step at a time. This is our new

[03:21] home. And so I did not want to destroy the steps. And so we had to put towels down on the steps.

[03:28] And we went one step at a time. And I'll tell you this, even though this game weighs something like

[03:34] 370 pounds, when you get a Jersey Jack machine on an angle like that, wanting to use gravity to

[03:43] throw you down the stairs, I was really worried that at some point moving this game, that it was

[03:50] going to slide down and Derek was going to go supermaning through the window. And that would be

[03:55] it. I'd have like a tombstone on my front yard for Derek Musket. Here lies Derek killed by Guns

[04:02] and Roses collector's edition. But we went one step at a time and then we got it upstairs. He

[04:08] helped me set up the game with putting the legs on it and doing everything, putting the topper on

[04:12] it. A few things out of the box just to mention on a Guns and Roses collector's edition that has

[04:17] sat in a box for three and a half years. The only thing missing from the game is a splitter for the

[04:24] topper, which is easy to get Doris over at Jersey Jack pinball is already mailing me one. So they've

[04:30] been very amazing in getting back to me instantly on that. Derek was texting with Jack as he was

[04:37] setting up the game, which is awesome. But he's funny though, because Derek was texting with Jack

[04:41] and then he calls Jack and Jack didn't pick up. I mean, I guess, you know, sometimes people just

[04:45] don't want to pick up the phone. So we get the game up the stairs, we set it up. And I will say

[04:50] this, the game is just gorgeous. No one's going to ever argue that we set it up. It looks beautiful.

[04:56] And then I make a mistake. I make a mistake. Instead of just playing the game and enjoying it,

[05:02] I made such a mistake. What I did was, you know, we opened it up and the play field looked perfect.

[05:07] So the first thing I wanted to do before playing a single game was install like those black washers

[05:15] from pinball life. It has like three posts and all these black washers you're supposed to put

[05:21] on the game to protect the game. And here I am like a fool. I mean, Canada knows better than

[05:27] anybody that these miracle play fields that were utilized during the build of guns and roses,

[05:33] collectors edition are trash. They're total trash. And I don't know why I thought I would get a

[05:39] special one. And so I was like, all right, so everything's great. Like I'm not going to have

[05:44] issues if I put these washers down. And now if you've ever installed these washers into the game,

[05:50] let me tell you, it's not the most fun thing to do on day one, hour one of your new pinball machine.

[05:58] But here I am foolishly trying to boldly proof the game. And look, I'm also learning a lesson

[06:03] that I'm not going to be OCD about this game. You know why? Because I already bought from Jersey Jack

[06:10] a backup play field of both the lower and upper play field. So I shouldn't even care. I shouldn't

[06:15] even care. But you know, like everybody out there, you don't want to see like around the posts of

[06:20] your game, the artwork chipping off. And so here's what I discovered about 80% of these posts are

[06:27] really easy to do. I don't have like the deep socket that goes over the posts. I had to use

[06:33] like needle nose pliers to hold the post in place and then use a socket underneath. So that was not

[06:39] a lot of fun. I was very careful. I didn't scratch anything. I didn't cause any issues with the game,

[06:45] but not the most fun thing to do. Now what I realized is what you're trying to solve for

[06:50] with these crappy miracle play fields is they have like a metal washer on all those posts and

[06:56] they're sinking into the game. And the reason why I know this is this game has been in a box for

[07:02] over three years on some of the posts. And I took pictures. The washer itself had actually sunken

[07:08] so much it was like in the clear basically. And I had to like move it back and forth with a post to

[07:14] pop it out of place. And on one of them, the worst one in the entire game, it's just something about

[07:19] this section of the game by the backstage area on the upper right of the game. That washer was in

[07:26] so good to get it loose. It actually wrinkled the artwork around it. And so that area is absolutely

[07:34] a ticking time bomb. And I didn't want to take apart the upper play field. I know people said

[07:39] that was easy. So I spent like a good maybe hour, hour and a half just getting like 80% of those

[07:46] black washers down. And then I did something so stupid. For some reason, I thought the record on

[07:53] the game was black and it looked like there was like a protective piece over the record that you

[07:58] could pull off and make it shiny black. But the record itself is actually more shiny blackish

[08:05] silver. And I started to pull off the mylar on my Chinese democracy record on my game,

[08:12] which was so stupid and 100% my fault. And I chalk that up to baby brain meets moving into a new house,

[08:20] meets frustrated with having to even do this work on the play field to just not sleeping with a

[08:26] newborn in the house. And so that was all my fault. And I want to say this, the great news is that so

[08:32] many people watch me do that stupid thing. I think there's more record stickers inbound now

[08:37] that I'll know what to do with. Not only are some people sending some stickers out, Ken over from

[08:42] Jersey Jack Pimbal said he's going to try to locate a set to get to me. So I'm very thankful for the

[08:48] community. That's the second main thing I learned after don't mess with your brand new game, just

[08:53] play with it is how awesome this community is. Because as some of you were on the ride for

[09:00] yesterday, when I was trying to do the code update for this game, you know, Wi Fi would take hours.

[09:07] And so I was just trying to do the full game install 3.02 using a USB stick. And I want to

[09:16] just say this, without this community, I don't think I would have figured it out last night,

[09:21] because the instructions that Jersey Jack give you, yeah, like they're not the easiest to figure out.

[09:28] And someone was like, you got to use this program etcher. All you got to do if you use that program

[09:35] is download the file, open up etcher, drag the file over to the USB stick, it'll create a bootable

[09:43] flash drive for you. And here's what's weird is I did it on an older flash drive. And I plugged it

[09:49] into the game, it kept installing it and then installing it again, and again, and again, and

[09:56] people are like, don't touch it, let it finish. And I'm not even joking when I say this, for some

[10:01] reason, it kept going indefinitely. And so at three o'clock in the morning, I'm like something's not

[10:07] right here. And I went and I found a new flash drive, I put the code on it. And within 10 minutes,

[10:14] it worked. So this is Kaneda telling you right now, after like over three years of not owning a

[10:21] pinball machine, I have a lot of pinball ownership rust that I need to get through. But I'm happy

[10:26] to report as of Thursday, June 20, I have a fully working, fully functional, beautiful,

[10:35] multi ball heavy guns and roses collectors edition behind me. It looks so awesome in my

[10:42] game room. I'm so happy to be able to play pinball when my children are not home. And I've done the

[10:49] following since having the game here, I've put in the Lermod's light kit in the back box, I put in

[10:56] the pin monk air ball barrier, I've also changed the IO board out, you know, some people are like,

[11:03] play a bunch of games with the old IO board. And I had the freaking back box open with the

[11:09] layer mods installed. And I'm like, I'm just going to do it now. I know what mushy Jersey Jack

[11:16] flippers feel like I don't need to feel it again. And so the game is working. I'm waiting on my pin

[11:23] woofer system and hasn't come in yet. I also got a nice gift from the folks over at pin stadium.

[11:30] They sent me the atomic concert install for this game. So I'm going to give that a try eventually.

[11:38] I just want to have some time on this game before doing much more to it. I put a fresh

[11:45] code of wax down. I got new pinballs from pinball life. And now I'm just looking forward to playing

[11:52] the game. Does anyone out there know after you install code 3.0 2, do you know what the best

[11:59] settings are for the game so that it is not crazy multi ball heavy? If you have a link to that,

[12:07] because I know there was stuff floating around. I'm not sure if anyone has done that on the new

[12:12] code to make sure the game plays a little less multi ball heavy because even as I was playing

[12:18] the game and you start a song, I know it's still there, right? Where like all these balls are coming

[12:24] at you and you don't even really have time to line up a shot. And I know that's guns and roses.

[12:30] And I know I will learn to live with it and know it doesn't shoot as good as Elton John.

[12:35] The other thing about GNR that's interesting because I do love the GNR light show, but coming

[12:40] from Elton John more recently, Elton John is so much brighter. Like the whole game is lit up

[12:47] much more bright and it still has a really awesome light show. But when the awesome light show is

[12:52] not going, the GI in Elton John is much better than the GI in guns and roses. And I think that's

[12:59] because they have twice as many hot rails in the game. But there's just something about Elton.

[13:03] It's so beautifully lit up from the moment you start the game. Guns and roses a lot darker. But

[13:10] again, guns and roses is going for more of that concert vibe where the lights are setting the

[13:15] mood. So I am super happy that the game is here. There's not much else to be done. It does bring

[13:21] me great pleasure to say that this community is amazing. And you guys were watching me fumble

[13:27] over this code installation for a really long time. I don't think I've looked as tired as I

[13:34] looked yesterday on that Facebook live. And I'm just looking forward to just getting more sleep.

[13:40] For those of you who have moved into a new house and for those of you who have had a newborn baby

[13:45] and for those of you that have moved into a different state, imagine combining all three of

[13:51] those things at once. I mean the last week, I mean it's like one thing after another. And now I

[13:58] realize two things. Why city living is so appealing. And I also realize why living in the suburbs is

[14:05] so appealing. There's pros and cons to both. I say this five minutes ago. Archaia Carnival,

[14:11] this minivan I got Brenda, which we love. It's been pumping out AC so beautifully. I drive Kylian

[14:17] to camp. The car makes me do a software upgrade. I do it. There's 200 miles on the car. And now the

[14:24] air conditioning unit is kind of like lukewarm. It's not blowing cold air. I'm just so fed up. It's

[14:31] like the moment I get one thing in place, something else goes wrong. You know, it's funny. We always

[14:37] say numbers don't lie in pinball. Brenda orders a rug for the living room of our house, right? And

[14:44] we had so much time to measure the space. She came here with her friend. They measured the size the

[14:50] rug needs to be. They order it. And then we unroll the rug. It's like four feet too big. I was like,

[14:57] who measured this? She's like, well, my friend Alexander, I'm like, how did he measure this

[15:02] measurement? Like this is 12 feet. We need a rug that's nine by seven. It's just unbelievable,

[15:08] people. All right, so here's the thing. I want to make a commitment to each and every one of you.

[15:12] I am going to get back into my routine, the routine you love very soon. You don't want to hear me

[15:18] talk about mowing the lawn or air conditioning problems with the car. But I'm here to tell you

[15:24] right now, we're almost there. We are almost at the point. I'm going to be back and better than ever

[15:29] scouring Pinside, reading Naps Arcade, giving you all the pinball scoops, news rumors, and analysis

[15:36] of pinball that you love. The only difference is now there will be a pinball machine behind me,

[15:40] which is going to be great. I've been looking at what's going on in pinball this week. There's

[15:44] not much news. Butch Peale has left Chicago Gaming Company. I mean, can you blame the guy? He makes

[15:51] the greatest schematics and manuals for pinball machines, but he's working at a company that

[15:57] doesn't release pinball machines. I mean, he couldn't be at a worse place than Chicago Gaming

[16:03] Company. I really hope and there's only one reason why Butch Peale left Jersey Jack Pinball.

[16:09] It's because of Pat Lawler. And now that Pat Lawler is gone, I really hope that Jack Guinari

[16:17] and the folks over at JJP call up Butch and bring him back. I know he has missed being there ever

[16:24] since he left because he had so much pride in what he did. He loved those products so much.

[16:31] And the reason why Pat Lawler didn't want him around anymore, because Butch Peale would find

[16:37] the mistakes that Pat Lawler made. And Pat Lawler doesn't like being told he's wrong. But all that

[16:44] can be pushed aside. And I think Butch would be a great addition to Jersey Jack Pinball as that

[16:51] company rounds the corner and has some juggernaut games that all of us are going to want great

[16:57] manuals for. And I mean, real printed bind it manuals, not stuff that's on a screen. Everybody,

[17:03] thank you for still being a member of Canadian Pinball podcast. I want to just thank each and

[17:08] every one of you for being patient and allowing me to have more space between shows over the last

[17:14] few weeks. Just a lot going on with this family. But I'll tell you this, I love it. Every time I'm

[17:20] doing anything and I give people my email, I'm like, Canada pinball. And they're like, why pinball?

[17:25] And I'm like, Oh, don't get me started. It's funny because the electrician who put in my TV,

[17:30] he's like, why is your email address this? And I'm like, well, I got a podcast about pinball.

[17:35] And I love when you tell people that you have a podcast about pinball. And then he starts to

[17:39] tell me about pinball. He's like, I've got a guy that's got all these rare machines. They're real

[17:46] sparkly and they're limited. Do you know what I'm talking about? And I'm like, bro, I've got no

[17:50] clue what you're talking about. Of course, I know what you're talking about, man. Everybody,

[17:54] have a great Thursday. Join me for the Saturday morning spectacular. If you can,

[18:00] there will be a guns and roses machine all lit up in the background. And maybe the pinwoofer

[18:07] system will come in between now and then to be honest, having this little baby, I don't even need

[18:13] a better sound system in this game. When the shaker motor is going off, this entire house rumbles.

[18:20] All right. I don't know how long Brenda is going to put up with me. Everybody love you guys.

[18:24] Thanks for the support. I'll talk to you soon.
