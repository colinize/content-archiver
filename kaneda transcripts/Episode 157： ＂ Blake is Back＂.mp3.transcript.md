[00:00] I'm close about made to waste of land.

[00:03] Who the red wine do?

[00:07] And with the hand-wraith pay you to the chief.

[00:10] Who the fuck the cannon at you for now?

[00:21] Alright, welcome to episode 157 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:25] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:27] I'm coming at you from a hotel room.

[00:29] I'm with Bubba right now.

[00:31] We are a block away from where we live because they're tearing up the floors in my apartment.

[00:36] There's no Wi-Fi in my apartment.

[00:38] So that is why you're not getting as many Canada Pinball podcasts as normal.

[00:44] But I have Wi-Fi again.

[00:46] I'm going to be living out of a hotel room for an entire week.

[00:49] So I look forward to getting you guys more shows.

[00:52] I'm not going to ramble on and on at the beginning of this podcast because I interview Blake.

[00:57] He's back on the show and we cover pretty much every topic going on right now in the Pinball hobby.

[01:02] So I'm just going to air that for you.

[01:04] I think you'll enjoy it.

[01:05] This is episode 157 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:09] Alright, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:14] Blake, do miss nail from Houston, Texas.

[01:18] Now Blake, we're going to talk about Pinball.

[01:20] We're going to talk about the hurricane that hit Houston.

[01:23] How that's impacted the Pinball hobby.

[01:26] And a lot of other stuff going on in Pinball.

[01:28] We're just going to go through the whole gamut.

[01:31] Welcome back to the show.

[01:32] Hey, thanks for having me back on Chris.

[01:34] And Blake, let's start with, let's start with Houston.

[01:37] Because this has been a topic that's been on everyone's mind in the country.

[01:42] We've all watched what's been going on from a distance.

[01:45] But what has it been like?

[01:48] Did you get hit hard?

[01:50] It's been pretty crazy over the last week and a couple of days since the storm hit.

[01:56] I mean, I've lived in Houston my whole life.

[01:59] And I've been through a few storms.

[02:01] The last really bad one was almost 10 years ago.

[02:05] But this was bad in a really different kind of way.

[02:09] I mean, this impacted the city immensely.

[02:12] And it's going to take a while for the city to kind of get back on its feet

[02:16] and be fully functional, again, I think.

[02:19] I was very fortunate that I didn't have any flooding in my home.

[02:24] The Clear Lake area where I live and work is about 30 minutes south of downtown Houston.

[02:30] And even though we're really close to the water, we're literally just a few miles from Galveston Bay, you know, which ties into the Gulf of Mexico.

[02:39] We had a lot of rainfall.

[02:42] We had nearly 50 inches of rain over a four day period just in my area alone.

[02:48] And there was some flooding, but overall the houses did pretty good here.

[02:54] What really hurt Houston was the houses that were nearby any creeks or buy-users or anything.

[02:59] Those were the ones that really took a beating because the water just rose so much.

[03:04] And it just started overflowing their banks and just made a huge mess out of everything.

[03:10] Right.

[03:11] Now, did you know anyone who experienced severe flooding in their homes?

[03:18] Yeah, yeah, I do know a number of people that have had flooding.

[03:22] Some of it as a result of the storm, some of it.

[03:26] They their house survived the flooding of the storm and the rainfall.

[03:30] But then when they opened up two of the reservoirs that are in here in Houston to alleviate the levies overflowing,

[03:38] then all of that water flowing out of the dams flooded people's homes that had not flooded.

[03:45] So yeah, so it's real kickin' the teeth.

[03:50] But yeah, I do know some people, unfortunately, that had nice collections, nice games that were impacted by this storm.

[03:59] Right. Because if there's one item you just can't throw in your backpack and leave with,

[04:04] it's a 300-pound pinball machine, right?

[04:07] So I saw lots of just devastating photos of people's home arcades where water would just come all the way up.

[04:18] Sorry, Bubba's barking.

[04:19] It would come up.

[04:20] I mean, two, three feet.

[04:22] And nothing is worse than water getting in contact with a pinball machine or in our arcade machine.

[04:31] I mean, it's just devastated him.

[04:32] Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, to put into perspective for people that aren't from Houston,

[04:38] technically the city is still the fourth largest city in the country, but it's actually about to surpass Chicago in terms of size and population.

[04:46] And we have three loops around the city.

[04:50] The outer loop, which is still being built, is nearly 200 miles around.

[04:57] And it would basically equate to the size of the state of Delaware if you laid it over a map.

[05:04] And so, you know, this wasn't just like an isolated area of the city that got a lot of rainfall and flooded.

[05:10] This was the whole city.

[05:11] I mean, this was a massive metropolitan area, all getting a substantial amount of rain.

[05:18] It wasn't like any one area got really less than any other, you know?

[05:23] So, but yeah, and that's the thing, you know, like I'm in a pinball league here in Houston.

[05:29] And, you know, everybody that makes up our league, they live in all parts of the city.

[05:33] So it's like pretty much, you know, there are people representing every area of the city that are in our league.

[05:40] And man, they, you know, there were people that flooded just about every part of the city.

[05:45] So.

[05:46] Yeah, it's just absolutely devastating.

[05:48] And I saw Gerrit at Stern has been doing a lot to raise money to help people with the efforts to get back on their feet.

[05:57] So, and there's a lot of different avenues for people to donate.

[06:01] So, you know, I think pinball, it's moments like these where we realize, and we put stuff in real perspective that, you know, pinball is a hobby.

[06:09] It's something we do for fun, but this just devastated so many people.

[06:13] So our thoughts and prayers do go out for all the people in Houston and Blake, we're glad to hear that you didn't suffer any real damage.

[06:21] All right, well, we were saying that we're happy that that Blake was able to avoid any real serious damage in Houston.

[06:30] And we had, we cut out a little bit on the Y5.

[06:33] So I'm recording this from a hotel room.

[06:35] We're doing a renovation.

[06:36] So, Bubba, Brenda and myself have been displaced for the week.

[06:40] So that's why this podcast hasn't gone up as frequently because I've been living in an apartment with no Y5.

[06:49] But now I have hotel Y5.

[06:51] So hopefully it cooperates with this chat Blake.

[06:55] But there's been a lot of pinball news.

[06:57] And I want to talk about what's been going on in the hobby over the last few weeks because it's just been me.

[07:02] I've been waiting to interview someone for a long time, so I'm happy.

[07:05] I have someone to go back and forth with.

[07:08] So should we just do it? She just go down the list of what's been popping in pinball?

[07:12] Yeah, that sounds great.

[07:14] All right. Should we start with like the worst topic first, which is the John Trudeau arrest?

[07:19] Yeah, oh man.

[07:22] When I found out a friend had sent me the article, I wasn't online at the time that it popped up.

[07:29] And I mean, I couldn't believe it.

[07:31] I was honestly really surprised.

[07:33] And I had chatted with him the last couple of times at T.P.F.

[07:38] And he seemed like a great guy.

[07:41] You know, he seemed like a really nice person who sincerely appreciated the kudos that people would give him for the work he's done on these games.

[07:51] And God, it was very surprising.

[07:54] Sickening and surprising.

[07:57] Yeah, I mean, I think nobody saw it coming.

[08:00] It was, it's a little creepy now when you read that comment someone left a few years ago when it was announced that he was joining Stern Pinball.

[08:11] And someone put up a comment that basically said, I can't believe we're applauding this guy.

[08:18] I mean, the way the world finds out what kind of what he did with children under his care, which looking back now, it's really weird and creepy that someone wrote that.

[08:30] But it's also like, fuck you, dude, for not turning this guy in.

[08:35] If you knew information that would have led him to being arrested three years ago, because I can't stand people that remained silent when such a serious subject is at hand.

[08:47] Yeah, actually, you know what, I had not heard that that was the comment that was posted until you just said that to me.

[08:53] I was not aware of that.

[08:55] But yeah, I mean, if this, if this was a few years ago in allowing him to continue on doing this for a few more years, I mean, I understand somebody not stepping up and ruining somebody's career, but that's a pretty serious, serious accusation.

[09:13] You know, if he really had proof and knew that Trudeau had been doing stuff like that, then I think that you kind of sort of have a civic duty to open your mouth and say something about it.

[09:25] But I'm not going to bash the guy, you know, who may or may not have known what was really going on.

[09:32] But yeah, it's just the whole situation just sucks because I mean, I think we all respect him as a designer and we all appreciated the creativity that he would put into games.

[09:42] I mean, I think that that's the thing. There's not, there aren't many pinball designers and out of all the pinball designers out there, especially the stern designers.

[09:52] Trudeau was one of the guys that thought outside the box. I mean, clearly now we know way outside the box.

[10:00] It sucks to lose him on a pinball level, but it doesn't suck that justice is now being served.

[10:08] I think what's been, we've talked about this a lot and I think people have beaten it into the ground.

[10:14] I think what's really concerning for me more than even, not even more, but equally as the Trudeau arrest is reading the thread on pinside.

[10:23] So many creepy guys are really trying to create this gray area of what he did were like, well, maybe the girl was 17.

[10:34] He's a 69 year old man. Right. There's no 17 year old girl that would be into Jon Trudeau anywhere.

[10:43] They just love the way that he designed games. Yeah, right. They're like, oh, the magnum flipper is John, you did it.

[10:51] You're absolutely right. I mean, look, for the police to go to his home in the warrant and then to arrest him, they had a lot of damn proof to go do that ahead of time.

[11:02] Like they knew what they were doing. They're likely as no gray area here. You know, I would like to believe the police are going to do their due diligence first before they, before they go do something like that and ruin somebody's life.

[11:15] But yeah, I'm he's probably very guilty of it. Unfortunately, and you know, I actually, I guess I almost feel worse for some of the people who have been his colleagues and co-workers for decades now.

[11:32] Some of these people that, you know, this was a friend to them, you know, somebody like we knew him, you know, in a commercial way in terms of buying products that he designed and stuff.

[11:43] But there are people that were friends with him. And I can't imagine how they must be feeling. Right. And I think they're all really frustrated. And I know zombie Yeti was just like crap.

[11:56] Like I just get dealt to bad hands in a row in pinball. First John Papadu, now he's got to deal with it with someone arrested for child pornography. And he's kind of like, I'm in my cursed.

[12:09] Like what is this? Like, and I think even Steve Richie, I know I sort of lambasted Steve Richie for his comments because I thought they were sort of off-color and ill-word it in the sense that like it's a bad day for pinball.

[12:24] And I thought if we stop talking about it, it'll go away. Like I just thought that was not a great way to phrase.

[12:31] What he's probably feeling, which is these guys are all shocked. This is someone they work next to for years.

[12:38] They consider him a friend. And now it really throws a monkey wrench into, you know, Stern's future titles that he was probably working on.

[12:50] But the good news is Stern has come out. They've spoken against the behavior finally. And John Trudeau's name will never again appear on a Stern pinball machine.

[13:01] Now Blake, let me ask you a question. So there's a lot of debate about if you owned a John Trudeau machine, would you feel differently about it?

[13:09] So, I mean, you know, I've got to go, Spusters Premium, and absolutely not. I would not feel differently about owning any of his games. I think that there are still...

[13:21] The games are great because of what John contributed to it, to them. But I don't feel like that those games were a reflection of who he obviously was in his private life.

[13:33] And, you know, that doesn't take any enjoyment out of the games for me personally. I think that the games are...

[13:41] They will always be fantastic because of what they are. You know, I will not deny that John was a good creative designer that really thought outside the box.

[13:52] I won't, I won't shortchange the man that, you know. He may have been a lot of other things obviously as we found out. But, you know, you could tell he put some heart and soul and some passion into those, into those machines.

[14:04] And I still think that Ghostbusters and Creatures and Black Lagoon and other games are fantastic games.

[14:10] Do you think this will negatively impact the prices of his machines as people might want to get rid of them? Or do you think not so much?

[14:21] You know, there might be a sort of an initial knee-jerk reaction people are having right now about it. But I think in the long run, Ghostbusters is always going to be a great game. Creatures always going to be a great game.

[14:35] You know, so if people are really so upset about it and they're willing to start selling great titles like that for a huge loss, then there will be plenty of people that are ready to buy them.

[14:48] You know, so I just think it's kind of silly to say, oh, I'll, you know, I've got to dump this because of it. But if it goes against your personal beliefs and you can't separate those beliefs from your enjoyment of the games, then I understand that.

[15:03] But no, I don't expect, I don't expect it to hurt those games long-term.

[15:08] Do you think that John Papaduke put the child pornography on John Trudeau's computer? So John Trudeau would be the most hated pinball designer in the world and not John Papaduke?

[15:21] Oh, well, you know, there probably are some pinball conspiracy theorists that probably think that out there.

[15:31] I mean, there's so many broken links on zidware.com. Who knows where those links go to be right anyway.

[15:36] Okay, so this chapter is going to be behind us real soon because Stern is putting a whole new design team on the game.

[15:45] John was working on that game is most likely Iron Maiden. I feel like all of these Stern titles, the cat is out of the bag.

[15:55] So, but we know the next game from Stern is not Iron Maiden.

[16:00] It is another game that takes place in outer space and it is most likely Guardians of the Galaxy.

[16:08] John Borg and Christopher Franchie, Blake, are you looking forward to this one?

[16:14] Absolutely. You know, I think the Guardians of the Galaxy is probably one of the hottest licenses that you can get out there today.

[16:22] I mean, you know, yeah, there will always be juggernauts like Star Wars, but I think this is a property that people on all age levels are really relating to right now.

[16:32] Even more so than Star Wars to a degree, you know, I think that the next Star Wars movie looks kind of dark, honestly, kind of like Empire was.

[16:41] And I think that people were kind of looking for something that's got a little bit more humor and some excitement in it, you know, along the lines of Guardians.

[16:49] And wait, wait, I got to stop you there. Okay. From a purely like more people will go see Star Wars than Guardians of the Galaxy.

[17:02] True. It will make way more money than any Guardians of the Galaxy movie.

[17:08] In fact, it will double probably the box office gross easily. I get it to dark or movie, but Star Wars is Star Wars.

[17:16] And don't get me wrong. We're going to talk about Star Wars in terms of the pinball Star Wars.

[17:21] But I think you're right. I think Guardians is in terms of like I would have I would have associated like this. Guardians to me is like Brooklyn. It's like it's it's hot.

[17:32] Star Wars is like Manhattan. It's it's it's always going to be what people think of when they think of New York City.

[17:38] Star Wars is always going to be the biggest sci-fi franchise, but the hot one right now, the one that's kind of hip and cooler is probably Guardians.

[17:46] Absolutely. And I think that there's a and you know, we'll talk about Star Wars pinball here in a minute.

[17:52] But I think there's sort of a been there done that feeling about Star Wars being translated into the pinball medium.

[17:59] And Guardians, it's it's new territory, you know, being able to take that license and apply it to this format should be a hell of a lot of fun for these guys that have been working on it.

[18:11] And you know, you couple that with a pretty killer soundtrack if they can actually secure some of the music from the movies.

[18:18] And I think you could have another great hit on your hands like Ghostbusters where it's a good mix of great character development, interesting characters, a great looking feel for the game and an excellent soundtrack.

[18:33] Now you bring up a good point about the music because the Guardian soundtrack, it's kind of like necessary because it those songs define all those scenes from the film.

[18:47] Do you think Stern's going to be able to get the licensing around a lot of those different songs because they probably come from different studios and when you're making a movie with like a $300 million budget, it's not so hard when you're making a pinball machine much more difficult.

[19:03] Yeah, I think I think that they would be very smart to work over the money to get as much of the music off of the soundtracks as they can.

[19:13] But I definitely don't expect them to get everything. I mean, I think that will be lucky if they get maybe three or four of the major songs that were featured in the marketing stuff.

[19:22] And even if they do that, I think people will be happy with it. Now if they don't get any of it, I think that's a missed opportunity.

[19:29] Well, the good news is a lot of these songs are old music. Like, it's music from 30, 40 years ago, right? So even older, so that stuff is not nearly as expensive as if you want to throw in like a Justin Bieber track.

[19:50] Here's what excites me about Guardians. And we know that Christopher Franci is an incredible artist and he really had to do Batman in just a couple of weeks.

[20:00] And this time around, he's able to work on Guardians from the very get go. So this isn't going to be a rush job.

[20:10] And I think the artwork on it is going to be stupendous. And I think you're going to see a lot of detail and a lot of amazing, amazing art on this game.

[20:20] And I'm also hearing from a mechanism standpoint, there's going to be some awesome mechs in the game. But I'll say this with a caveat Blake, I always hear this before every new Stern game comes out.

[20:32] That it's amazing, that it's incredible, that it's going to blow me away. And half of the times it does it. But I hope it does.

[20:41] No, I mean, you know, I kind of there were so much hype surrounding Star Wars coming out and just the potential that the property had. And then when it finally was revealed and there wasn't anything really, truly special about that game.

[20:57] My enthusiasm has kind of waned and I've kind of it's kind of dropped a few levels compared to what I was feeling like before Star Wars because I felt like Star Wars was having a pretty good run of games there, you know, with kind of starting with Metallica, but then really once they got into Ghostbusters and you know, I thought Aerosmith was a great effort that really exceeded everybody's expectations.

[21:21] And personally, I know there's a lot of mixed feelings about Batman 66, but I love what Chris did for that game in the short amount of time. And I think that he added a hell of a lot of personality to that game.

[21:36] I also think that Batman 66 has actually got more unique mechanisms that fit that theme than Star Wars does in terms of the, you know, the reactor and the way that you lock a ball in terms of how the Batmobile would go into the the Batcave and the show and stuff, you know.

[21:55] Let's let's go mech from that right because I think both of those franchises are universes and worlds that have so many fun elements going on in them, you know, Batman 66 was a re-themed of the dark night so you've still got the major crane happening there.

[22:15] Now, if I think about Star Wars, like the major mechs are what the hyperloop, the hyperdrive, I always call it the hyperloop, it's the hyperdrive.

[22:25] But it's a big loop, so you got that right?

[22:28] Right. All right, let's go game per game. So let's go one, one mech on one game, one mech on the other game. So the major mech on Star Wars is the hyperdrive, the major mech on Batman would be what? Still the crane?

[22:43] Yeah, I guess it's kind of a toss up between the turntable and the crane. In terms of interactivity, they're about the same.

[22:51] So both, okay, so the turntable and the crane are probably equal because one dominates the right side of the play field of one, the left side.

[23:02] The second major mech on Star Wars, this is where I'm like, what is it? Is it, is it the...

[23:11] I think it's the Death Star, it's the Death Star cracking open, you know, and maybe...

[23:16] Which is the mechanism you hardly ever interact with, because it's like an impossible shot to hit.

[23:22] I haven't seen an LE in person yet, so I don't really know how the little two-prong ramp up into the Death Star fully functions yet.

[23:31] But I guess that's basically the second mechanism on the game.

[23:37] Okay, so... And I would say that the turntable on Batman is probably better than that.

[23:46] And then from there, from there we have... What, you've got the tie fighter on the spring, you've got...

[23:55] Batman's got two ramps, Star Wars has... The Star Wars have one ramp?

[24:01] Star Wars has got two ramps. Two ramps? Yeah.

[24:05] But okay, so let's talk about ramps. I think there was more creativity put into the ramps, just the ramps alone on Batman 66.

[24:12] If you look at the left ramp, it forms a question mark like for the Riddler.

[24:17] They at least put some thought into, how should we design this ramp in a creative way to wrap around the turntable and then form this element that at least ties back into one of the characters.

[24:28] The ramps on Star Wars, they just go straight back along the sides of the cabinet to the flippers.

[24:33] Right.

[24:34] You know, it's a little uninspired.

[24:36] Right, and it's meant obviously to be as fast as possible. And the game is fast. I mean, the game is brutally fast.

[24:45] Yeah.

[24:46] You know, and we've talked about it a lot on this podcast, but I think you're right.

[24:51] I think at the end of the day, the hype around Star Wars and the expectations for that game were super, super high.

[25:01] And I don't think I've ever seen a pinball machine received so much debate before it even came out.

[25:08] Now that it's out, it's interesting because the game is in people's homes.

[25:13] And here's the thing that I always love. Whenever a new game arrives, I always hate when people are like,

[25:20] it's the only game in my collection that's getting any playtime. That means it's amazing.

[25:25] It's like you just bought it. It's brand new. Of course, you're going to be spending the majority of your time on the new machine.

[25:32] Yeah, and it might be the next game that goes out of their collection after they've played the hell out of it and they decide they don't like it.

[25:39] Yeah. I mean, look, the thing is, I think that Star Wars is an okay pinball machine,

[25:47] I think that Star Wars needs to be an amazing machine. I won't own one. I know that I have friends who will own one.

[25:55] There's a lot on location here in New York, but I think it's going to go down as a miss over time.

[26:04] It's Steve Richie. Game of Thrones is another example. Do we consider Game of Thrones to be a great game now that enough time has passed and people got over the artwork?

[26:17] I don't know.

[26:20] I don't rank it up there as one of the great games. I've played it a lot more now than I did when it first came out.

[26:28] I appreciate the modes of the game in terms of how deep it is. I've tried to learn more of it, but I still don't think it's a great game in terms of having that unique magic that some of these games have out there that others don't.

[26:43] I mean, Star Wars is not a bad game by any means. I think I'm mostly disappointed that there was so much more you could do with the theme in terms of creativity and really honoring all the main things in the theme that they didn't do.

[26:58] And the hyperdrive, while I understand the speed aspect of it, it just baffles me because it was such a minuscule aspect of the original trilogy.

[27:07] Do you ever even see it in the movies?

[27:11] Yeah, well, you see them go to light speed, which is via the hyperdrive, but the only time it's actually a plot point is in Empire Strikes Back when they're trying to get the hyperdrive fixed.

[27:23] And that's why they end up having to go to Cloud City, you know, and to get land those people to fix it.

[27:30] That's the only time it actually factors into the plot at all, but overall, it's just not a main element, not like the forces, you know.

[27:39] I mean, I still can't believe there's no force grabbing of a ball with magnets. I mean, to me, that's just like, what is this?

[27:47] And I do believe that they pulled out some features from the game to cut costs.

[27:55] I mean, I think you're right. I don't think that Steve Richie is that bare bones and basic.

[28:01] I think Steve wants to put a lot into games, but then I think budget may end up being a hindrance in the long run.

[28:08] I mean, hell, look, he put magnets in black night, you know, and that game came out in 1980.

[28:14] I mean, I would imagine that he would love to put magnets in Star Wars. I mean, it just makes sense.

[28:20] Yeah, I mean, I guess technically he did in the hyper drive loop, but I mean, in terms of it actually doing something with the ball in the play field, that could have been a cool effect.

[28:29] It's the main, to me, that's the coolest aspect of Bram Soaker's Dracula is that magnet pulling that ball across the play field. That's so cool.

[28:38] Yeah, I'm still shocked that there's not a battle against the emperor where he's either force grabbing the ball or you're, you know, you're basically like unlocking multi balls by hitting a ball that's being like grabbed by bait or the bait or choke or whatever.

[29:00] I mean, there's so many different scenes from the movie where the force is being used. I mean, think about this.

[29:06] Like, imagine loop training to be a Jedi and you have to, you know, hit the ball as it's moving across the game.

[29:14] It would be great. It would also be awesome if it asked you to close your eyes and do it. I don't know. They kind of done like really cool things with elements from the film that just aren't happening in the game.

[29:29] And I think people are, are like saying how enthusiastic they are because the game is just fast and is like a richy machine, but it's not a Star Wars machine. It's a Steve Richie machine with Star Wars slap on top of it.

[29:45] Yeah. Well, you know, hey, I'm optimistic that that Guardians is going to be a great game. I really, really hope that it turns out awesome. There's a lot you can do with that property. And, you know, I think people are going to kind of forget about Star Wars a little bit once that game gets.

[30:03] I absolutely agree. I think Expo, I think I've come October. You're going to see a lot of Star Wars pinball machines put up for sale. I think people, and a lot of people are just waiting to, I mean, this is a great period.

[30:19] And we'll talk more about other titles coming out, but I think this out of any period since I've been following this hobby, I think this is the ultimate period to kind of just like hold on to your money for a while and see what comes out and play everything before you buy it.

[30:36] I mean, you'd be a fool not to because let's go to the next title. And I want to kind of think about what's coming out this, you know, this fall.

[30:44] So Houdini is also on the horizon. And I've been trying to get Joe Balls and Josh Pooler on the show to talk about it because I think this thing should be coming out in the next like two to three months.

[31:01] Have you ever played Houdini?

[31:04] Yeah, I actually, I've got one game in on it at T.P.F this year. And the game surprised the hell out of me to be honest with you. I mean, I really, I had a blast playing that game.

[31:15] You know, some of the shots were pretty tight in terms of the geometry on the game, but they put a lot of cool stuff in there. I mean, that catapult that fires a ball from basically the front of the playfield to the back is pretty kick ass and unique.

[31:29] And that's something that's going to surprise a lot of people when they play it. It's going to get a lot of attention.

[31:37] Right. I also think like the coding, I think Josh is going to give us a code that is not going to be too complex, too hard to follow.

[31:48] I'm really optimistic that it's going to be a game that people are going to understand how to play it because I think Stern's gotten into wacky land with how complex the coding has been on some of these games recently.

[32:02] And I want, I don't want to have to hand people a brochure to tell them how to play this pinball machine.

[32:11] Right. Now, you know, one thing that impressed me about the American pinball guys at TPS was that I feel like these guys are, they're each artists in their own way, not that there are other great designers, artists out there working as well.

[32:26] But these guys seem like they are going to fine tune this machine in until they're absolutely happy with it. And they're not going to put it out there until they're happy with it.

[32:38] And it will be done. It will be done. This won't be a game that you're going to get and then have to wait. Now, let's talk about waiting and Batman because you, I think a lot of people are comparing Batman to Star Wars and justifying the purchase.

[33:01] But it's been a really painful wait Blake for people with Batman 66. Do you think that wait will end before expo for Lyman to give 1.0 code?

[33:13] I have six weeks right? We got six weeks roughly. I have a feeling that they will because they know they're going to get asked about it in Chicago that they will probably try to crank out one more update before expo.

[33:28] Who knows if it'll be really substantial or not? I don't know.

[33:33] George Gomez emailed one of the Batman 66 customers and said we're not doing code updates every few weeks. We're only going to do a substantial code update that has been, that is very thorough and has a lot in it.

[33:53] I think it's a good thing to have a look at the game. It's going to be a whole new game by the time when they release the next update.

[34:04] I hope that's true. I mean, look, I don't think it's a bad game by any means as it currently sits. I actually feel like there's more to do on that game than there is on kiss.

[34:16] Luckily, that was another game that had a hard time getting code updates. But that's lemon in the wound.

[34:23] Like, people are still waiting for like final kiss code and something.

[34:28] I mean, what they finally got a new update about half or two months ago, maybe I guess sometime in the summer.

[34:37] But I think Batman 66 has even more potential than what it currently has. But I don't think it's a boring, unplayable game as it currently sits.

[34:48] It's a great theme.

[34:50] In some level, a great theme is a great theme. It's really hard not to just have fun when the theme is Batman, when the theme is Star Wars, when the theme is Guardians, when the theme is, I was going to have to say, erosmith, but it actually is a fun game.

[35:10] But there is, you know, as we're stirring wins, I mean, stirring already starts off each inning with a man on second nobody out.

[35:18] I mean, with the themes they have, they always have a head start. You know, who Dini versus Guardians of the Galaxy? I would...

[35:27] I mean, it's so much harder to sell who Dini at the same price as a Guardians Pro.

[35:36] Now, but who Dini's priced very competitively? I believe the price is what? $6,995?

[35:43] Yeah, I think so.

[35:45] Now, I might be a question for American pinballs production. I think these guys will get a final prototype altogether.

[35:55] But do they have the ability to set up an assembly line to get games out quick enough?

[36:01] Because I think that's going to be... And they're looking to hire. They're looking to hire people to do that.

[36:07] I get a little nervous because of these like people doing this for the first time and they kind of are.

[36:13] I mean, I know Joe's been in this circus before, but in terms of setting up a manufacturing company,

[36:22] and manufacturing pinball, it's going to be their first rodeo. So expect there to be some bumps in the road and some delays getting that game out.

[36:31] Well, you know, they have a long ways to go from having a finished prototype and what they're happy with calling a finished game to actually being able to get them into people's homes.

[36:43] And we've seen this so much over the last year and a half to two years with all these companies that have been having issues.

[36:50] And people are just going to wait and see.

[36:57] And I think that American pinball knows that they've got to prove that they can handle it or else they're not going to get any buyers.

[37:03] So there's some motivation right there for them that they've got to prove that they can handle making these things.

[37:08] I wonder what their target is in terms of sales. Is it 300? Is it 500?

[37:15] Yes, it's probably a few hundred for this first game.

[37:19] I mean, I don't, I think you need to sell more. Unless they're, I don't know their overhead.

[37:26] I think they're building these games in a space where I believe Dovel's family owns, right?

[37:33] So there might not be the same level of rent to be paid. I'm speculating here. I should, I should actually find this stuff out.

[37:41] But for those who listen to this podcast over the last couple of years, this is all we do. We speculate. There's not much.

[37:47] I don't really, I don't get paid. There's probably a bunch of fake news here. I don't get paid for this.

[37:53] This isn't, this isn't like important if I got that right or wrong. Who cares? Like it is the largest thing in things.

[38:00] But the point you're making is a good one. If, if, let's say it's a family owned facility that they're working in, then there may be a lot of overhead covered that they don't have to deal with as if they were another company.

[38:13] Let's talk about a company with, with not much overhead and that spooky.

[38:19] Total nuclear annihilation and Alice Cooper. What are your thoughts? How do you think both of those games are going to shake up the marketplace?

[38:28] We know that TNAs around, I think around 200 have been ordered so far. Maybe more.

[38:35] Yeah, I think that they're probably a little over 200 by now. And hey, I am obviously, you know, I've worked with these guys.

[38:46] And they're a great, great group of people. I'm super thrilled for them. And I think that total annihilation, total nuclear annihilation.

[38:57] I think that's, it kind of came out of nowhere and I do not doubt that it stole some Star Wars sales and stuff like that. I really don't doubt that.

[39:05] I think they came in at a killer price point. They gave a lot of people an opportunity to see the game and play the game at shows before they finally released the final version.

[39:18] I think it's really going to be the game that put spooky on the map even more seriously. And it's probably going to help fun Alice Cooper and help them do even better things down the road.

[39:29] Right. So you really think you could have done in some Star Wars sales.

[39:36] I think that there were a few serious collectors, not not just people that have families and they wanted to buy a new machine for their kids play on.

[39:43] But I think serious collectors and pitball players. I think that they probably were maybe looking at a Star Wars because of the theme.

[39:52] But then they saw what spooky has done with TNA and came in at a good price and it was probably worth their money more to get something that was fresh and unique.

[40:04] Yeah, I mean, I can see that. You know, look, I mean, Star makes 50 games a day. So if someone walks into Gary's, he turns off and says, Gary, someone else just sold 150 games that's going to take him eight months to make.

[40:20] Right. He's probably like sitting back there with his like feet upon the desk, being like, Chico.

[40:26] Like, I'm going to make that many games before days. Get out of here. All right. Go do something.

[40:32] You know, it's like, like, it's not real competition, but I think what's great about total nuclear annihilation is a different take on pinball.

[40:41] It's giving people something of a variety in their collection. If you have, I mean, if you buy stern games, you get the same kind of game over and over again.

[40:50] This is a completely different approach to pinball. And I love that Scott's focused on the music.

[40:56] And, you know, it's sort of like this gameplay element that's not cookie cutter. It's not based on a big theme.

[41:03] You know, I think it's going to be refreshing for people because I think it's going to get back to just pinball. It's not trying to be Star Wars. It's trying to be just pinball.

[41:12] It's raw pinball. Yeah. It's just raw unfiltered pinball. You know, it's not about what kind of crazy unique toys does the game have?

[41:23] It's not about any truly unique shots, even though there are some really cool shots in the game, primarily the ball lock.

[41:33] The DC lock with the trademark.

[41:36] Yeah, but the DC lock, right?

[41:39] No, I think it's just a, I think it is a fresh approach. I think we've gotten so used to fan layouts and some of these machines and having how much stuff can they cram into the playfield or not put on a playfield.

[41:52] And that this game was just way off to the side, you know, unlike anything else that's being offered right now.

[41:59] Now, you're an artist, Blake. What did you think of the art on TNA?

[42:06] I love the back glass. I really love the style that Matt Andrews went with on that and I understand why he got the direction that he got from Scott on it.

[42:19] I actually love the cabinet on it. I think it feels like just pure 80s and I absolutely love it. You know, that's what they, that's what they were trying to go for all along.

[42:28] And I thought he captured in great way. You know, it's, it's a simple ball graphic, but it's got such a great color palette that it works well.

[42:35] The, the playfield, I think the playfield looks nice.

[42:38] I think from an artistic standpoint, the only other thing maybe I would have liked to have seen a little bit more is a little bit more depth to the art work on the play.

[42:48] field. You've, you've got this top down view of, of all the reactors and the plastics look like all of the machinery and the industrial look of the reactors in that, you know, in that environment.

[43:02] But I would have liked to have maybe seen a little bit more depth and maybe character integration like you see on the back glass.

[43:13] Not necessarily with the character herself, but just more of that world fit in there, you know, versus just panels and walls and tooling and all this stuff that is supposed to look like reactors.

[43:27] I think well, we'll get a chance to stand over it soon, right, too, because I brought up that critique about the depth on it.

[43:37] I've been told that it does have more of a depth of appearance to it when you're standing over the game.

[43:44] So the game is, I think, we'll be able to see it at X-Pose soon. I think this game should be, it sounds like it should be shipping sometime October and November.

[43:54] So that's exciting me is I think for those of us who are into the hobby, we probably know someone who's going to get one nearby.

[44:01] So I'm happy to see this game made. I am. Now what about spooky's other title? Do you think Alice Cooper is going to blow us away? I mean, we don't really know much.

[44:15] You know, I'm I hope I hope so. I really hope for spooky that it does because I think it's a I think it's a title that they're really passionate about and I and I will say and I will say as a note that I have agreed with your purpose.

[44:30] I have agreed with your perspective on previous episodes about, you know, they're making games that they really want to see made and I think that that's important. You have to be passionate about what you're working on, but you also have to be able to make themes that are going to sell well and other people are going to be passionate about.

[44:47] With that aside, what I'm really hoping for with this game is that because they they they sold all their rob zombies off, they did pretty well with dominoes overall.

[45:01] They're doing very well with total nuclear annihilation. What I'm really hoping to see is that all of this build up over the last few years and the successes they've had is really going to allow them to turn that into just a fully loaded knock it out of the park kind of game with Alice Cooper.

[45:19] And that's what people been wanting to see we kind of we've wanted to see them kind of take the training wheels off and really, you know, put on the big boy tires and see what they can do with a game with a lot of unique features and stuff.

[45:34] And so I'm hoping that that's what they've been able to do with this game.

[45:40] Right. Yeah, I mean, we haven't seen anything other than the back glass and I have to say I don't love the back glass art.

[45:52] So I'm feeling like it's I'm just wondering if that same style is going to be all over the game.

[46:01] But the game I think this game is trying to be sort of like a new sort of Elvira, right. It's it's this it's not an Alice Cooper music pin. It's the nightmare castle like starring Alice Cooper fits perfectly into the spooky sort of genre.

[46:21] We know we're going to have a different layout than the other two spooky games and this is it. I mean, this is I think this is spooky's chance to show us that they can make a game that's on par if not better than Stern pro.

[46:38] It's kind of funny because I feel like Stern keeps lowering the bar. So I feel like spooky should be able to exceed where Stern has the bar right now with its pro machines and look even maybe even its premium machines.

[46:55] I Stern continues to strip out what you get in a premium and in LA. So at the price point of spooky if the game is good, I think it'll it'll do well. I think it's going to be an uphill battle though. I do because I think that Alice Cooper as a theme doesn't doesn't do you any favors. I think it makes it harder for you to to sell 500.

[47:22] It's it's a little bit more of a polarizing theme. I think that they're going to just be but but you know, I kind of felt that same way about Rob Zombie. They're either going to be people that love it or people that don't care like personally, I would never have any interest in a Rob Zombie machine.

[47:38] Regardless of the layout, the gameplay, the coding none of that matters. That's just not a theme that matters anything to me. And the same will probably apply here.

[47:48] But you're right. If for spooky's price point, if they can make a fully loaded game that's got some some true magic to it. And if it's got a lot of personality, you know, there's a good chance that Alice Cooper could have more personality and it than Star Wars does.

[48:04] I mean, and I hope that that's the case. I hope it does great.

[48:09] Well, but here's the I think the climate now is just much harder to sell. I think if Rob Zombie came out today with everything we know with being burned by a bunch of companies like highway and Dutch with all the new titles that have come out.

[48:25] I don't think Rob Zombie sells out the way it did a couple years ago.

[48:30] And I don't think so either. Right. And we've shifted our approach to new inbox. And I think everyone has had to shift how they approach new inbox machines because you know, either you were burned, either you waited a really long time.

[48:46] Maybe you didn't even get your game. Maybe you got your game and you're still waiting for a code update. Maybe you got your game and then a better theme was announced that you wish you waited for.

[48:58] I think people right now are probably as skeptical as ever about where to spend their money and when to spend their money in this hobby.

[49:08] Absolutely. I mean, like you said earlier, now is kind of the time to just hold on your money and wait and see what comes out.

[49:16] There are no doubt there are a lot of options that are currently out there and a lot of options that are about to be out there. And you know, I know a number of people that are new inbox buyers right now that could go get a new game.

[49:30] But they're just kind of holding off because they just want to see what's coming out next and there's not anything out there at the moment that truly blows them away other than a hand, you know, a couple of games.

[49:42] So, so yeah, I think it's kind of a let's wait and see. There's not this urgency to feel like you've got to to put that money down and get a game.

[49:52] The only thing that makes that urgency and I think Stern has done a really good job at this is really that fear of missing out on getting a specific version of a game which is normally like the LE right.

[50:04] Because let's say I want to get a dialed in right now and let's say I love the game. They're going to make dialed in for the next couple years.

[50:13] They the number of L.E.s that Jack said, he'll make it. I think it's something like four or five thousand, which we all know he's never going to make five thousand dialed in.

[50:22] But it's just to tell people you don't have to worry we're going to keep making these this and the collectors additions are the only ones that have that fear of missing out because he's only going to make 150.

[50:34] I backed out of it two weeks ago because I just started realizing I do like dialed in a lot. I can go get an L.E. at any time.

[50:48] And there's just not enough to justify spending 3500 hours more than the L.E. 4,500 more than the standard, which is still it's all still the same exact game.

[51:01] Right. No, I mean, you know, I think that that Jack did Jack Ampat did such a great job with dialed in that they you've got a great game.

[51:13] If you get a standard addition, you've got a really nice great game. If you get a limited edition and beyond that, I don't feel like there's anything special about the collector's addition that really justifies the additional cost or justifies you being able to point to it in your house and say,

[51:30] I've got the top of the mill version of this game. Here's what special about it that no other game has. There's nothing really there.

[51:37] It's going to surprise anybody or blow anybody away. That's that's cool and unique. So I think what's surprising to me.

[51:45] And I think you're right. What's surprising to me is on the habit on let's say the habit, for example, on the different versions of the game.

[51:55] The cabinet artwork is different. Right. But the cabinet artwork is all the same on dialed it. No matter the trim.

[52:05] And to me, that was like the main thing is you just couldn't step back and really say like the collector's addition was it's like, you know, it's like the difference between a three series BMW and an M3 where like everybody panels different.

[52:24] And you could justify like that. It's a different look. I just I didn't feel like they went around the whole machine and personalized each one to indicate the difference in trim.

[52:37] Right. I mean, you know, I applaud Jack for not truncating these games, you know, to make a standard addition. He's not he's not depriving you of getting the full experience in the standard additions of the games.

[52:52] But at the same time, when you do that, it's very hard to try to make three more, you know, three different versions of a game and try to make them also special that one truly is better than another, you know.

[53:07] So I just well, then it's just trim. It's all cosmetic. And that's fine though. But then go all in on cosmetic differences.

[53:20] It's too, they're all too similar. And when I saw the collector's addition had it's like the purple armor is really dark. It's almost more like a black purple.

[53:30] I don't even think it pops as well as the bright blue on the LE. And so, you know, I kind of think they got backed in a little bit to the CE additions. I think they threw it out there just to kind of rope in and they saw what would happen with Batman Super Ali. They're not idiots.

[53:47] They saw people just throw their money at an arbitrarily priced addition. But, but you could argue that Batman Super Ali at least gives you enough cosmetic variation.

[54:01] Yeah. I mean, if you look at a standard or a premium addition and then you look at the super early, there are some very noticeable differences.

[54:10] Oh yeah. I mean, it doesn't look the same at all unless you look at the play field. Well, so that's why I'm waiting. And I also told Brenda this is going to be news to everyone who listens to my podcast.

[54:24] I basically told her I'm not going to put a pinball machine in the living room. I'm only going to have two machines in the bedroom. And that will be that.

[54:37] And I'm excited. She's excited because we can have a normal living room and not have this because it takes a big footprint.

[54:46] Like, there's no way around it. A pinball machine is an awkward piece of furniture that you when you're living in an apartment in a city.

[54:56] Yeah. Well, and you know what? On top of that, you're going to make sure that the other machine that you have in there, assuming that one of them is magic girl, is you're going to make sure it counts.

[55:06] You're going to make sure that it's a game that you know you're going to want to have and that you're going to want to play.

[55:11] Well, maybe we'll see what happens. That would be the logical thing to do.

[55:18] That would be I understand that these things are pieces of artwork as well. And they can be equally as enjoyed just by telling it was looking at them.

[55:26] I'm on the fence about what goes next to magic girl and more will be revealed as the months go on. And like you said, I'm really looking forward to seeing what comes up down the road.

[55:39] Now one game that I would love to own this game, but I would love to own this game knowing that trying to get one wouldn't be in arduous journey. And that is the big Lebowski.

[55:52] I still think Dutch created a magical machine, but I also think Dutch is the worst business out there. Like these guys don't know what they're doing.

[56:04] And I saw the latest update where they're basically like we talked with coin taker for a couple hours and we all feel really good and all this stuff.

[56:13] I don't know. Like do you think they're going to have a prototype at expo in 2017?

[56:20] Man, there's probably going to be some smoke and mirror show that they try to put on yet again to keep people in on the game or from creating more of a shitstorm than it already is.

[56:32] I don't know what the hell these guys are doing quite honestly. I mean, it's just you know, the issues that they were having with the game were funding and with the the manufacturer.

[56:43] But at what point did they decide that they needed to start just completely redesigning mechanisms and boards and all sorts of stuff on this thing?

[56:51] Because aria has had the rights. I think aria like design the other parts. So they had to like redesign or else they would get even open themselves up to more lawsuits from a array.

[57:06] That's if that's the case and that's why they can't utilize the same designs that they've already got to me that just makes it even more ridiculous that they did not come to an agreement with this company.

[57:18] You know, you know, rather than it's just like they're so proud that they wanted to go off and do this on their own on their own and redesign these things rather than just coming to an agreement and getting the damn game is made and getting it getting over this hurdle that they've had.

[57:35] Yeah, because how could it not have looked whatever aria said Dutch Oden how could it be more financially feasible to completely start over again with any contract manufacturer versus just raise the price of the game and charge everyone who was in on it $2,000 more and everyone would just be happy that they got their game.

[58:02] The new baseline price for the big Lebowski might be like $10,000 or $11,000. It is what it is. The same way Jack raised the price on was from 6,500 to 9,000 for the same game because he needed to to stay in business.

[58:18] I don't know. I think this thing is it's fun for me because I get to make fun of all these attempts and if they if they figure it out, I can just go buy a machine.

[58:30] So I just don't think they're going to figure it out because I just I just don't understand how there's money.

[58:37] And in their latest update they talked a lot about how they have enough money to maybe even build more games and that's just bullshit then why don't you get Bill Brenness's refund if you have all this right right.

[58:49] The whole thing just feels like a huge, relax a daisicle approach to everything just like just like them going on vacation in the middle of them having all this crap going on and not being able to answer people's questions and not giving any definitive you know answers on what's really happening.

[59:08] It's just there's everything money to go to expo again. Why?

[59:13] Right. What are they going to say? It's ridiculous and just you know I feel bad for the people that have been on this and on this game for so long.

[59:23] You know I also think that we would have been really shitty if even if these guys needed to ask for more money per machine if they were having to hit people up for $2,000 more just to get the games made.

[59:36] But at the very least it would have given people an opportunity to say well yes I still want the game for that additional amount of money or know I'm out and at the very very least they could have continued on made the games and moved on from it you know.

[59:52] But no they just dug themselves into a hole.

[59:55] What happens to the people who the 50 people who own an ARA version of this game now replacement parts for these individuals will not be available are if they make these new boards are they swappable to be put into older machines.

[01:00:16] I mean screw holes even line up on on the boards probably not I mean it's you know we're coming close to seeing the same thing with highway and all these massive modifications that are being made to alien and you've got about in the whole scheme of things you've got a handful of people out in the world that have the

[01:00:37] original versions of these games versus the post Andrew highway versions and granted the same company but it's still there they're going in and they're redesigning parts there they're having to ship entirely new playfield supposedly to people it's it's a huge mess I mean yeah it's it there's a phrase like you don't build the ship in the ocean and that's what these guys now have to do it highway and that's another company.

[01:01:05] It's just I just don't see a way out I mean they're just going to keep burning money these investors I get these guys are multi million right so for them they can take it on the chin and they could go down this this pride path where yeah we'll keep losing six figures every month just to save face but at some point it's probably going to be the wives of these gentlemen are like what are you freaking doing why are you even in

[01:01:34] pinball when you have millions of dollars it's really easy to make more money with your money and the probably the dumbest thing you could do is salvage bad business decisions by Andrew highway why why are they even doing it yeah I mean it's just it's just it seems like it's a whole slew of more indecisiveness that's still going on the company that was already

[01:02:03] happening when Andrew was in charge you know our friend Brad who's also here in Houston he's got the only alien in Texas and you know he is still waiting on parts that were promised to him by Andrew at T.P.F. and March and now more things have broken on the game then then early on you know that that he was originally promised already and in the process they've also

[01:02:30] gone in and they've started changing parts and stuff so now he's just getting farther and farther behind the curb on on all of these things that are being done in the game and you know he's okay with it as long as they get him the damn stuff he needs but so he needs a whole new populated playfield I

[01:02:46] understanding the last I heard from him was that sounds like they're sending entirely new populated playfields has anyone has anyone received one yet I don't think so supposedly there was a shipment of games that

[01:02:58] was supposed to be coming in right about now I think to coin taker and supposedly with that shipment of games was going to be a bunch of parts and stuff that all of these guys were going to need but nobody knows for sure and nobody nobody

[01:03:12] knows for sure but that's what I believe coin taker told Brad okay now and and so what hopefully for Brad's sake in this container will be a

[01:03:27] fully populated playfield and aren't they also my making this up aren't they like changing the PC again yeah I think so I mean he cannot even update the code and the machine that he has because of the all the changes that have been made now I mean his playfield LCD doesn't work anymore he's got some of the GI out the one of the pop bumpers doesn't work you know it's just one thing I

[01:03:57] think after another the game is still very playable dug me wrong and it's still as fun but it's not what the game needs to be or should be you know I

[01:04:06] suppose I put the money now right for these guys are right in a lot just being and then just the fact of being shrung out all this time since March

[01:04:14] yeah I mean this is one that I thought I called it when I called Andrew highway was going to drive this company to the ground and I called that part of it right I didn't anticipate anyone to ever take the reins from him to try and salvage all of his mistakes but I mean I think this is going to be my my my theory on the new highway pinball and I've been saying it and I always keep beating my own drum on these issues because

[01:04:43] I haven't been wrong I think these guys make it until like January February then they close up shop and I I say that because this game has lost all of its luster it is not going to pull in a bunch of new buyers people are sick of it people it's it's it's not worth it why would you ever go into adventure like this knowing what you know if I

[01:05:12] had known magic girl wasn't working different story I might have still bought it because it's still amazing artwork but the point is that you just could how can you be filled with any confidence that if you buy an alien these guys are going to be around for a long time which I don't think they are that your games not going to have like tons of issues which we know they do and there's just other games out there that are cheaper and more reliable and hassle free like the other alien

[01:05:41] game out there that everyone's loving attack from Mars remake Ellie which is cheaper and and a guaranteed bona fide classic amazing pinball experience. Yeah I mean you know I do not I don't want to give these guys too much crap because I understand it probably did take some time for them to get their bearings with the company and get their feet on the ground but I feel like that times kind of pass now

[01:06:10] and they really should be able to start cranking some stuff out I mean if nothing else they should have been able to send parts to these guys I mean it's just all you are doing

[01:06:21] they don't care it wasn't money that they made off of these guys it was money that Andrew made off of them and you know yes they do still have an obligation but I do know you know there is a rumor that they are already working on game number 3 supposedly

[01:06:37] and what I've heard is that game number three is going to be the evil dead.

[01:06:43] Oh, but you know like working on a game, I'm working on a game right now too.

[01:06:50] You know it's like you can be so easy just to say that and then we all get like all excited.

[01:06:55] But I'll say working on your working on a game when your current game is a shit show means nothing.

[01:07:03] If I walk into my boss's office, right, like and I give him an activation and it's just it's horrible.

[01:07:10] Like everything that's supposed to go right has gone wrong.

[01:07:14] Nothing's working. No one's happy. And I'm like, but I'm working on my next one.

[01:07:20] Nobody would give a shit. But that's the thing about pinball play.

[01:07:25] And I think that's the thing everyone's realizing.

[01:07:27] We've got to lose this mentality that the next one is going to be the magical one.

[01:07:35] You know we're all we're all just chasing this this new period of new inbox pinball.

[01:07:41] It is nothing other than people trying to relive the 90s error,

[01:07:48] Valley Williams, Golden Era pinball where there were so many magical pinball machines that came out so close to each other that these games they don't even come close to comparing to the level of magic those games brought out.

[01:08:05] And it's the same way I look at millennials these days. They're all just trying to relive the 80s and they it's the same thing.

[01:08:12] And every time we hear there's another game coming all we're really saying is I really hope this is the one that makes me feel the way I felt when I first played like Adams family or theater of magic.

[01:08:25] You know like or medieval madness or twilight zone.

[01:08:29] Yeah, I mean, you know, I can go up to to my local distributor joysticks, which is really the largest arcade that we have here in Houston.

[01:08:39] And I can go play all the new Sterns I can go play the new Jersey Jack games I can go play a game like attack from Mars and attack from Mars.

[01:08:50] Sitting alongside all these other new Sterns with their LCDs and everything is still equally as fun if not even more fun in terms of the overall playability and the excitement that the game has and you know what I'm going to eat crow a little bit.

[01:09:06] You know back before tpf when we talked one time I was very kind of down on on attack from Mars. I wasn't very excited about it.

[01:09:17] It felt like a been there done that kind of scenario and there were other titles out there that were more exciting.

[01:09:24] But I've got to give Chicago gaming a lot of credit they they took a great game.

[01:09:29] They made it even better in terms of the lighting and the extra little things that they added to make it a better quality game.

[01:09:36] And they built a game like a tank it plays great and it has that same feel as those 90s games and I mean it's like when something is made as good as they were back in that era.

[01:09:50] It's kind of hard to screw up something that great and I think it comes down to the very simple fact that back there.

[01:10:00] It always about the world under glass because they weren't relying on screens and LCDs and other mediums on the cabinet itself to help further the experience or the story.

[01:10:15] I mean they used dots and whatnot to just be quick glances at stuff that you needed to know.

[01:10:21] But man it was all happening below you.

[01:10:24] And I think these new games it's like they're getting lost and how to create that because they're relying so much on the cheaper alternative which is just to put stuff on the screen.

[01:10:36] Yeah I mean you know I am I am actually so impressed with what they've done with attack from Mars that I am I've kind of got this renewed interest in what they're doing as a company and the fact that they have proven that they can handle manufacturing as well as stern but on a smaller scale obviously.

[01:10:54] But build a really good quality game.

[01:10:58] I'm highly impressed and honestly even though it sounds like their next game or two may be just another revisited title.

[01:11:08] It really makes me hopeful that if they're successful enough with a string of games that they will dive into games like Kingpin that so few people have ever gotten to even see in person or play.

[01:11:19] So you know that that could be their new market is that they're able to bring these these you know these almost extinct games back into existence for people to experience for the first time and it will be like a completely fresh experience.

[01:11:37] Yeah I mean I I'm this I was the same as you I was like who cares about a remake right that used to be my the way I would talk about them before tpf was you know there's no real excitement to get a remake because we played the game for so many years and there's nothing new to discover in it.

[01:11:58] But I agree these guys have proven me wrong because I think what they've shown is you know games are just better than and games were built by people and teams and companies back then that weren't concerned with cutting corners.

[01:12:13] They were all trying to outdo each other by creating the most magical machines.

[01:12:18] So we're going to bring you those games back but we're going to make them even better we're going to put modern stuff in it that just makes it a little bit more contemporary with like the bigger screen.

[01:12:29] But when you look at what you get in the early package in attack from our remake I mean that top or alone blows me away it's like that look at that top versus the ghost busters top or tell me they're they're both see if I didn't like they're both worth five in our box because

[01:12:47] they don't they don't the top or comes with the L.E. it comes with it you had to buy your ghost busters top or if you have one for five in our box and that thing looks like it's $30 piece of plastic crap from China.

[01:13:04] Yeah, I mean the the I'm not a big fan of toppers overall unless it really was purposely designed to go with the game you know and like on Adams family it was specifically designed to go on that game and it served a purpose.

[01:13:21] You know but but I also think that toppers are a great opportunity to add even more atmosphere and personality do a game and you're absolutely right what they did with the top or on attack from Mars is kick ass it's a it's a great looking interactive unique top or that adds even more excitement to the game.

[01:13:40] And and that's that's a great way to handle it you know build it into the cost the expense of the game don't try to nickel and dime people after they've already spent a lot of money on the machine you know yeah I mean they've they've sort of I think taking the award for.

[01:13:58] Best buy of of 2017 in my book I mean if I really haven't heard anything negative about that title I think I think attack from Mars remake Ellie and dialed in or sort of I think the two best games of the year in terms of build quality in terms of value in terms of what you get I mean obviously they're completely different experiences from a pinball standpoint.

[01:14:24] But I think the pressure is is God of becoming a little bit more towards Stern I think Stern still has all the themes they still have the production they still have three to four games a year but what they don't have I think is just the respect of the enthusiast community when it comes to quality when it comes to building things that are worth the money they're charging and they they have to get that together.

[01:14:54] Quickly because they can't keep doing what they're doing yeah I mean they they haven't.

[01:15:00] I don't want to say that they've completely lost their momentum that they really started building up after Ghostbusters but I think they're still kind of showing that they're not afraid to cut corners and save money where they can and take away some of the magical experience that a game could possibly have and and that's not even taken into consideration the quality issues.

[01:15:24] I mean there's a lot of things that have been going on I mean cabinets should not be splitting and you know the I'm not going to lose a lot of sleep over the ghosting thing but cabinets definitely should not be splitting I mean that's that's a problem right well they've they've they've started to put the

[01:15:41] blanket inside to yeah they've they've I hopefully that's they they've acknowledged that they've resolved it and and I think they're able to move on from that but you know they they should be leading the way and they have been leading the way in terms of showing how mass production should work but yeah I just I just think it's like if there's let's say there's like seven pinball manufacturers now all making two to three hundred.

[01:16:11] Of a game there's just there's enough quantity out there now where I don't you know mass producing and see stern should be the mass producer games I don't want my mass production company to also be making the premium and Ellie and like high end stuff because they don't know how to they they literally are not set up for white glove high end pinball manufacturing they're not it's like they

[01:16:40] they used to like like you look at a Star Trek Ellie and you look at what all they included on that game and how beautiful the package you could you could point to that game and say that game has got a lot more specialty to it then just a pro model does but when they started getting into all this accessorizing and modding stuff and they just started stripping all these games of what should have been on them already

[01:17:07] that's why I really think that they detracted from their LEDs you know well people keep buying them like I just saw that yeah AC DC premium they're removing the lollipop rails from it so it's like really like how much money you saving by doing that you know maybe they're like well we're off we're we have to

[01:17:31] off to the cost of making it so you can never move that big insert window on the lower playfield which used to fog up now like it screws you can unscrew it and get to it but I know I think look we're a little over now or we'll sort of in closing I would say that I think Star Wars sucked a lot of the life and enthusiasm out of the hobby I think people won't always

[01:18:01] admit that on Pinside because they get attacked by the Star Wars buyers but it wasn't the game we wanted I think dialed in is great but it's still not the theme people really want it they I mean they would much rather have had like toy story made by Pat Loller I think that you know there's just a lot of stuff coming out like and I think the residual or the collateral damage of the fall of skip B and pop a Duke and a highway and a Dutch I think

[01:18:31] it's just real people are just burnt I just feel this lack of enthusiasm and momentum as you put and I think the whole hobby is waiting for that game to sort of reawaken them sure you know that's the exciting thing about pinball I mean that's that's what's so great about sitting on the edges of our seats waiting for these these reveals is that we know that the potential is there with the licenses that these companies are getting to turn out some truly

[01:19:01] amazing fun games and and I think that that is that's an excitement that we will always have no matter how the games turn out whether they're good or bad but I'm still optimistic that we're in an era right now where companies are trying to make good games

[01:19:20] even though they're definitely as cost cutting going on in some areas I mean we're in much better shape in the hobby than we were 10 years ago for sure

[01:19:30] so I'm really hopeful that you know guardians is going to get announced and shown at expo and it's going to be just an amazing game I'm really hopeful that would be a great game and I think that that'll give

[01:19:44] stern some more momentum again you know I just the problem the problem is is in any other category when you're when you have like 90% of the market the hunger and the

[01:19:58] passion to prove a point isn't there when you're so successful like they are you know I'm saying like true but but where I but where I have faith is to me the hunger and the drive is coming from

[01:20:12] like guys like Christopher Franchion zombie Yeti and these Keith L wins like these new guys who want to make a name for themselves in the in the you know in the chronicles of pinball

[01:20:26] they're they'll only become like legendary pinball guys or if they make a game that's legendary yeah I mean you know I know you and I think similarly in this regard that a big part of what is so special about pinball to me is that I see this is a truly incredible art form not just how and how the games play

[01:20:49] but in the artwork itself that's on the game and then how the themes are integrated into these games and I am super excited to be seeing people like Chris and and Jeremy and dirty donny and all these guys getting to put their incredible

[01:21:05] styles and their talents into this truly unique medium you know and I'm really excited that people like mad Andrews and Brian Allen have gotten the opportunity to

[01:21:15] dabble in it as well so you know that's the kind of stuff that's really exciting me in the hobby right now is seeing how do they translate these themes that everybody loves so much so I think that you know Jersey

[01:21:28] Jack's doing awesome I think that they got past their growing pains with with the hobbit and dialed in still is one of my favorite games the year by far

[01:21:39] and I can't wait to see what they do next I'm not super thrilled that it could be parts of the Caribbean only because I'm there's so many great themes out there that haven't been done I kind of want to see something else but but I'm

[01:21:50] optimistic that if that's what they're doing they'll put their all into it and they'll try to make a really damn good game right before we let you go let's talk just for a couple of minutes T.P.F.

[01:22:02] yeah so you're working on the artwork for T.P.F right Texas Pimple Festival I am yes so you know after working with with Ed Vandervine and his lovely wife Kim on the logo design for the show last year they never had an official logo design up until last year they asked me to come back and work with them on the overall

[01:22:29] theming and the merchandising and just all the art direction for the show for this next year and can you tell us what the theme is or

[01:22:38] yeah yeah so let's yeah so actually you know the reason I wanted to talk about a little bit was because we're about to start rolling out a lot of the early marketing materials for T.P.F.

[01:22:51] for next year registration opens on October 1st and so the theme this year is going to be an original theme the last few years have been based off of like

[01:23:02] Bally Williams games this year it's a 50s sci fi pop theme called Cosmic Chaos and this actually stems from an idea that

[01:23:18] famed designer Mark Richie had and this may or may not get turned into a pinball machine well for now we'll say this likely won't get turned into a pinball machine but the idea behind it is we wanted to develop a fun space theme that had a great

[01:23:37] sci fi retro look to it for the show that for next year but then also develop it further into something that could possibly be rolled into a game one day so

[01:23:50] the shirt designs going to be getting revealed pretty soon and you know I sent you a sneak peek at it and it's it's colorful I think it's it's fresh

[01:24:03] and I really hope that people people like it there's there's more to the story behind it in terms of the plot of the game and stuff like that that we can go

[01:24:13] is another another time you can't tease people by saying there may be a new game is Mark working on a game or so so really this this all started like literally this was just you know Ed and Mark hanging out

[01:24:29] in the cargo you know cooking out and having some drinks and visiting and they just started joking about designing a game and so Mark pulled out a piece of paper and started sketching on it and after talking about a few ideas Mark said that he had this idea that he had been kind of tossing around in his head for Cosmic Chaos and basically it kind of just stopped there you know he he for fun he started developing an

[01:24:58] actual layout but a few months ago when Ed Kim and I started talking about what we were going to do for the theme for T. P. F. next year I tossed out well hey what if we did sort of a generic space theme you know space is kind of my forte just because of what I do for work but but I also felt like there hadn't been a space theme in a number of years for the show and that it could be fun to do something that was kind of in the spirit of you know some of the great early 80s

[01:25:26] space games and stuff and so they said yeah you know we really like that by the way it turns out that Ed and Mark and I also talked about doing this you know come up with this idea for a possible theme you know call Cosmic Chaos and so they they pitched the idea to me and I love the way it sounded I thought it was cool and we all agreed that the 50s

[01:25:55] pop art style would be a great approach to give it some you know visual pizzazz and so that's what we ran with so so the little bit of you know banner art working stuff that's now upon the T. P. F. website and on their Facebook page that's kind of a little sampling of what the style is going to look like and so anyways that's kind of where we're going with the game the game may never be made but we're going to pretend like it's this

[01:26:24] fresh new fake theme that you know nobody's heard of before just take pre order money on it you know hasn't stopped people in the past I'm sure there's somebody out there that'd be given well to give us some money right I mean all the 250 people who bought into retro atomic zombie adventure

[01:26:43] land and T. P. F. this year is when Blake so T. P. F. is going to be March 16 through the 18th back at the Embassy sweets hotel and Frisco Texas same same place is sold out already I don't think so they they're opening registration October 1st the hotel I bet it's getting close if it hasn't sold out already the only reason I don't think it sold out already

[01:27:12] is this kind of rub people the wrong way this year but the hotel decided to make everybody put a down payment on a deposit on a room because somebody people apparently backed out the last minute last year.

[01:27:25] So the hotel was like no we're not going to have any more of that again so there were a lot of people that were not thrilled about having a put a deposit down so the hotel may not have fully booked yet.

[01:27:39] I mean come on I mean that's the new thing I'm not refundable deposits it's it's the only way to operate with the pinball crowd you know you know how the pinball community can be about stuff sometimes so I'm on the T. P. F. site right now if you guys go to Texas pinball dot com T. P. F. you can see yeah the hour on the banner that is very cool very cool I will most likely go to T. P. F. I was Blake's late addition and ready to go to the T. P. F. I was Blake's late addition and ready to go to Texas pinball.

[01:28:08] Late addition roommate last year so if it I'll try to get my own room this year Blake so you can have some peace of mind this year.

[01:28:15] Now it was it was great it was a lot of fun I've got my room booked already so it's it's just a damn great weekend it's so much fun yes the best it's the best show I think because it's it's it's got the most amount of.

[01:28:31] I feel like the combination of all the pins that come all the people that come the weather the restaurants in the area like everything about it just is always a home run and Ed is so awesome and and just does a good job with it yeah they're a you know we're obviously very excited for the show again next year and they're already working on getting a few celebrities and stuff so they're that went very well last year and they got a lot of great feedback from having.

[01:28:59] Sam Jones and Cassandra Peterson there so I think they're they're going to try to see who else they might be able to get for next year you and I should go you and I should go into skies as Barry and Yacht this year just walk around the shows Barry Yacht heading people like checks like fake checks for like 9000 R.

[01:29:20] FUNs well you're like no I think to work on my Dutch a little bit yeah just like in Dutch we didn't realize what the word refund meant we meant we thought it meant that we keep the money and go in vacation well you know technically T.P.F.

[01:29:38] is kind of a weekend vacation for me totally well Blake thank you for coming back on the show we got to do it again more often and and yeah I mean I think it's just you know it's been a

[01:29:49] little bit of a couple slow months in the pinball world but we all know come a come like late September a lot you know a lot of the expo stuff and the leaks in the rumors start to start to get really wild and then come mid

[01:30:04] October like the damn breaks and we get to see all this new stuff so we'll definitely have you back on a talk about what's been going on the

[01:30:11] yeah so actually I'm getting to go to expo I'm going to expo for the first time this year so I'm gonna I'm gonna be in Chicago and I really look forward to meeting some new people up

[01:30:23] there and seeing what that shows all about I'm super excited about I hope there's some cool reveals and if anybody you know wants to say hi come

[01:30:34] find me I'll be there so I'll be around I'll be hanging out with Ed probably the whole weekend so nice so you'll be at expo I will be in Greece during expo so I'm gonna miss it this year

[01:30:45] well I think Greece is gonna be a little bit more scenic than the expo will be I'll be podcasting from Santa Rene it'll happen awesome well now it'll you'll have a great time so

[01:30:58] all right great well Blake thank you so much and everyone will we'll be back real soon with some more pinball news this week Blake thank you as always a great guest of the show

[01:31:09] thanks buddy I appreciate you having me on again all right anytime well that was Blake and we had a really good talk and I think we're seeing a consistent theme in a lot of my recent podcast and I think I'm seeing the same theme on

[01:31:24] pinside itself which is it is a good time to wait it is a good time to see what's gonna come out down the line and I think threads like trying to compare the price of pinball machines to

[01:31:37] did you see this thread high end kitchen appliances is completely indicative of where we are in this hobby where people are doing all sorts of mental gymnastics as my friend Jeff Rivera would

[01:31:49] say to try and justify the cost of these machines and I think what's happened and it's this is just where we're at is that these new machines just aren't satisfying people on the level that

[01:32:03] they need to for the amount of money they're costing okay no one out there can really feel great about spending $8,500 on a star wars Ellie you just can't you might feel good about

[01:32:15] your attack from Mars you might feel good about your dial then but overall overall I think everyone is having a hard time stomaching the fact that these games are costing so much that they don't have a game that's really

[01:32:27] exclusive or rare or that unique the thousands of people have the same exact game is them and the economy is going to start to dip in the prices all these

[01:32:35] games are going to start to dip and I think it's just time to realize that you know what pinball needs to go back to being about joy about fun about buying the game that you really love not about chasing these arbitrary prices with

[01:32:48] Ellie's and all this stuff because there's no real value there there's no real value if a game is truly rare if a game is truly limited then it should hold its value

[01:32:57] kingpin big bang bar king Kong magic girl it was like you you you really there's there's there's so few of these games out there that if you're a collector you're going to want them but

[01:33:09] would anyone really consider 800 star wars to be collectible 1000 Wizard of Oz and more additions to be collectible I don't think so so that's it we'll be back with some more guest of the show I hope you guys have a good

[01:33:25] week I hope you're enjoying the beginning of fall and autumn and exciting times the next couple months we're going to start to sort of figure out what's going to be coming at expo new games will be revealed in the next two months

[01:33:39] and it's a great time to be in the hobby so with that have a great day and we'll talk to you soon
