[00:00] All I do is win, win, win, no matter what.

[00:03] Got money on my mind, I can never get enough.

[00:06] And every time I step up in the building, everybody hands go up.

[00:10] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up.

[00:15] Welcome everybody to Canada Spinball Podcast.

[00:17] It's a Monday here in New York City.

[00:20] The holiday seasons are upon us.

[00:22] Brenda's sisters coming in from Ireland to celebrate with Killian.

[00:26] And thank each and every one of you

[00:28] for being a member of the Canada Club.

[00:29] Here's what I wanna do on this episode.

[00:31] First, I'm gonna go around the horn

[00:33] and just talk about what's going on quickly

[00:35] with every manufacturer.

[00:36] And then I wanna focus on a single topic.

[00:39] And that is, is FOMO fun and something we enjoy,

[00:43] or is FOMO driving this hobby in the wrong direction?

[00:46] And we're gonna talk about it.

[00:47] I don't think there's like one black and white answer

[00:49] to this question, but I wanna play a little bit

[00:51] of devil's advocate on this entire hobby

[00:53] as I look at some of the stuff happening

[00:55] in the current pinball marketplace.

[00:57] All right, but first let's go around the horn

[00:59] and talk about what's going on in the world of pinball.

[01:01] So James Bond, L.E.s are now currently shipping

[01:04] to customers, which is awesome.

[01:07] I think we're gonna see almost all of these games delivered.

[01:10] All 1000 James Bond, L.E.s will almost reach their customers

[01:14] by the end of the year.

[01:16] Remember, Stern Pinball can make about 400 games a week.

[01:20] So if they gotta do a run of 1000 James Bond, L.E.s,

[01:24] they can crank him out pretty quickly.

[01:25] Isn't that amazing?

[01:27] Like this company could make all of the Scooby-Doo's

[01:30] in just a month and a half.

[01:33] Stern Pinball, my hat goes off to you

[01:35] because when you watch these games arrive,

[01:37] it is kind of incredible.

[01:38] It's not just like one unboxing here

[01:40] and then another unboxing a week later.

[01:43] It's like in one week, hundreds of games

[01:46] are arriving to customers, which is absolutely incredible.

[01:50] Whenever Stern decides to flex its might

[01:52] and show it, it can really do.

[01:53] It is always very impressive.

[01:55] Now, if you're in on a James Bond, L.E. congratulations,

[01:59] you're gonna be waiting a while for the code.

[02:02] Everybody knows that there's not much in it.

[02:05] Is Stern gonna make this game great?

[02:07] Is Lonnie gonna put everything into this game that you want?

[02:10] We shall see.

[02:12] The track record for Stern delivering a great game,

[02:16] like if you wait a year, is really, really good.

[02:20] So I think if you have one, you're not that nervous.

[02:22] I wouldn't really even unbox mine

[02:25] until like six months from now.

[02:27] You know, other people like to unbox it, learn the shots,

[02:30] and then it's fun seeing each new code update

[02:32] and seeing how much more they're adding to the game

[02:34] every time there's a new code update.

[02:36] So congratulations.

[02:38] The other thing we're gonna see is this,

[02:39] because a thousand L.E.s at $13,000 hitting people

[02:44] during the holiday season,

[02:47] we're going to see the people who don't really want it

[02:50] try to sell their James Bond L.E.s.

[02:53] Now here's the funny part.

[02:55] I saw a guy list a James Bond L.E. for $14,000

[03:00] and he got all of these downvotes.

[03:02] And I think people are forgetting,

[03:04] James Bond L.E. was not $10,000 like Godzilla.

[03:08] This game with tax from the Stern website is $14,000 people.

[03:14] So somebody listing a James Bond L.E. for $14,000

[03:19] is actually passing that game on to a new buyer at cost.

[03:24] He's not making any money on that transaction.

[03:28] So it was really funny to see all the downvotes.

[03:31] It's like, what do people expect?

[03:32] Is this seller supposed to lose money?

[03:35] I think we're gonna see these games be available.

[03:37] I don't think James Bond L.E. is gonna go up in price.

[03:40] I think it's gonna hold steady around like this $13,000.

[03:43] Who knows, right?

[03:44] We've never had a thousand Stern L.E.s at $13,000 before.

[03:49] So the market is pretty untested on this machine.

[03:53] I played the James Bond Pro at Jack Barb.

[03:55] It shoots okay.

[03:57] It doesn't wow me, right?

[03:58] I went from James Bond to Godzilla and I have to be candid.

[04:02] Godzilla shoots so much better than James Bond.

[04:07] And my one concern with James Bond is this.

[04:10] There's nothing mechanically in the game

[04:12] that's really that interesting.

[04:14] There was nothing that really wowed me.

[04:16] And I know the differences between the Pro and the Premium.

[04:20] And there's nothing on that Premium

[04:22] that is also like a real wow thing

[04:24] that you can't wait to play.

[04:26] And that's my only like gripe with the game right now

[04:29] is like, I don't think Gomez put a mech in this game

[04:32] that lives up to some of the other stuff

[04:34] he's put into his games.

[04:35] And I just don't think there's anything

[04:37] mechanically in this game that would make people go wow.

[04:40] I think the missile is kind of weird.

[04:42] It doesn't really do that much

[04:44] and it takes up so much real estate

[04:46] and three drop targets aren't that exciting to shoot.

[04:49] And then you've got that sort of whole left side

[04:51] is weird to me.

[04:52] That whole left side by that upper left flipper,

[04:54] that whole area just doesn't feel well thought out.

[04:57] It almost feels like an afterthought

[04:59] and they ran out of time

[05:00] and they wanted to do something else there.

[05:03] There's just something about the ball going into the Vuck

[05:05] that just like shoots it out.

[05:06] It just doesn't shoot it out in an interesting way.

[05:09] And I'll compare it to like the magnet

[05:11] that Keith Elwin put on Godzilla.

[05:13] You know that magnet that grabs the ball

[05:15] and swings it into the next shot?

[05:17] Like think about how well that was thought out.

[05:20] And then you look at the James Bond area on the left.

[05:23] It just doesn't feel like it's doing anything interesting.

[05:26] Now look, people have said this,

[05:27] like maybe the code's gonna make some of these

[05:29] uninteresting shots more interesting.

[05:31] Time will tell.

[05:32] All right, so that's that.

[05:33] So I hope you guys enjoy your James Bond LEs.

[05:36] It's an expensive pin and I hope it lives up

[05:38] to all of your expectations.

[05:40] Speaking of James Bond,

[05:41] we still have no word on the Keith Elwin's 60th anniversary.

[05:45] As I predicted, I knew Stern would get all of the money

[05:48] for all of the LEs before they revealed this machine.

[05:52] It's a smart move.

[05:53] It's a dicey move.

[05:54] I don't know how it's gonna play out.

[05:56] I do feel bad for the James Bond fanatic who might want both

[06:01] because that's $40,000 for like two Stern machines

[06:05] that are on the same theme basically.

[06:07] I don't get it.

[06:08] We'll see if this experiment works out.

[06:10] I don't think if this machine is over $20,000,

[06:13] it's gonna be some day one sellout.

[06:15] I just don't.

[06:16] So Stern now is all gonna be about James Bond production.

[06:20] They're gonna make more Godzilla premiums coming up.

[06:23] And then I think we're only gonna see

[06:25] two Cornerstone games from Stern Pinball.

[06:28] I don't think we're gonna see their next game

[06:31] until sometime in March, April.

[06:33] So this is it for Stern.

[06:35] I mean, the next wave is gonna be the Elwynn pin,

[06:38] but then it's all gonna be the slow burn

[06:41] of the James Bond code.

[06:43] So that's Stern Pinball for the next six months, people.

[06:45] All right, let's move on to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[06:48] Nothing really new to report with Jersey Jack Pinball.

[06:50] Toy Story is still the game that they are pushing.

[06:53] No, it's obvious that a lot of these distributors,

[06:56] I'm getting the emails from distributors.

[06:58] They all seem to have inventory for Toy Story LE,

[07:01] Guns N' Roses LE, and Toy Story Collectors Edition.

[07:05] So that leads me to believe that if you're a distributor

[07:07] and you have inventory of those three titles,

[07:10] you are not gonna be ordering more.

[07:12] And Toy Story Collectors Edition,

[07:14] even though it's a beautiful pin,

[07:16] it's definitely not selling that quickly.

[07:19] And so now everyone is just wondering,

[07:21] when will we get Jersey Jack Pinball number eight?

[07:24] We all think it's Godfather.

[07:26] When are we gonna see it?

[07:27] Are we gonna see it sooner than later

[07:29] if Toy Story sales start to flatline?

[07:32] So that is what's happening next at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[07:35] So let's go over to Spooky Pinball.

[07:36] Obviously Spooky is owning the conversation

[07:39] in the pinball community this December.

[07:41] Lot of enthusiasm for Scooby-Doo.

[07:44] A lot of excitement in the hype thread.

[07:46] I think the Spooky haters, like, and they're out there,

[07:48] the people rooting against Spooky Pinball.

[07:51] Little weird.

[07:51] I don't think there's any place in pinball

[07:53] for that kind of behavior.

[07:54] Every pinball company, when they have a new title,

[07:57] we should look at it with a little bit of an open mind.

[08:00] Unless that company's named Home Pin,

[08:02] I think there's no reason

[08:04] why we should count anybody out

[08:06] as they make a new pinball machine.

[08:07] And look, Spooky Pinball really hit it

[08:09] out of the park with this theme.

[08:11] There's a lot of positivity around Scooby-Doo.

[08:14] There's a lot of enthusiasm around this game.

[08:16] And now the big question mark is this,

[08:19] what will the game be like when we see it in January?

[08:22] Until then, there really is nothing else to do than wait.

[08:26] And for those of you who committed to buying a game,

[08:29] I'm happy you got a theme you really wanted.

[08:32] Now, we know you haven't seen enough yet

[08:34] to know the game is truly gonna be epic and great,

[08:36] but we know the passion is there.

[08:39] We know the theme is right for Spooky.

[08:41] And we also know there's gonna be a ton of assets

[08:44] that they have access to to put into this game.

[08:48] And so I'm optimistic that they're gonna figure this game out.

[08:51] I'm optimistic this will be probably

[08:53] one of their best shooting games.

[08:55] And I'm optimistic if you're a Scooby-Doo fan,

[08:58] this game is gonna put a smile on your face.

[09:01] And I'm gonna talk about when I do Devil's Advocate,

[09:03] I'm gonna talk about why I like the way Spooky's doing it,

[09:05] the way they're doing it.

[09:06] The game is still not sold out.

[09:08] If you want one, you can still get one.

[09:10] And I think that's a good thing.

[09:11] I think it's somewhat of a refreshing thing

[09:13] in the pinball world and I'll explain why later.

[09:16] All right, so Spooky Pinball having a really good December.

[09:19] Let's go on to the Pinball Brothers next, right?

[09:21] We don't really hear about the Pinball Brothers much,

[09:24] but they are sharing photos of Queen Pinball

[09:27] about to go on the line or in production.

[09:30] I don't know about you when I see these photos.

[09:32] I'm glad this company is getting it done,

[09:35] but when I look at Queen Pinball, and it's 2022,

[09:38] we're going on to 2023,

[09:41] I just don't feel like this game can truly compete

[09:45] with what's in the pinball marketplace.

[09:47] It's about a $10,000 pinball machine.

[09:51] If you're a Queen fanatic, you might have to buy this machine.

[09:55] But I almost feel bad for you

[09:56] because this game just doesn't feel like

[09:59] it's gonna live up to a game like Rush

[10:01] or Guns N' Roses or Metallica or ACDC or Aerosmith.

[10:06] Like if you go down a list of all the music pins,

[10:09] this machine reminds me a lot of a game called Lead Zeppelin.

[10:13] And we don't really talk about how painful it is

[10:16] when your favorite musical act

[10:18] gets turned into a pinball machine, right?

[10:20] It gets immortalized in this analog device.

[10:23] And all of a sudden, like you can't change it.

[10:25] Like this is it.

[10:26] And I think if you asked anybody,

[10:28] if you're a Queen fanatic,

[10:30] who would you like to have make your Queen game?

[10:33] I don't think anybody would say pinball brothers.

[10:36] And also like this game has been revealed months ago.

[10:39] So it's gonna be curious to see how they get the FOMO going.

[10:42] You know, I think for these boutique companies

[10:44] like pinball brothers and American pinball,

[10:47] it's really critical that they reveal the game

[10:49] at the right time when the game is on the line

[10:52] because they've destroyed the FOMO around Queen.

[10:56] You never get a second chance to make a first impression.

[10:59] And this game feels like it's been out now

[11:01] for like three, four months

[11:03] and not a single game has shipped to a customer.

[11:06] And that doesn't work anymore.

[11:08] It doesn't work anymore

[11:09] unless you have something truly special people believe in.

[11:12] But pinball brothers,

[11:13] they don't have a fan base in the community, right?

[11:16] We'll see how well it does.

[11:18] I just think there's a finite amount of pinball dollars

[11:20] to be spent.

[11:21] And I just can't see a lot of people ordering this game.

[11:24] All right, let's go next to Chicago Gaming Company.

[11:27] This company, you know what's interesting

[11:29] is the thread on pin side is,

[11:30] what's next from Chicago Gaming Company?

[11:33] And I don't think anyone is asking that question.

[11:36] I think the question is,

[11:37] what the heck is going on over at Chicago Gaming Company?

[11:41] And all people are looking for is a little bit,

[11:43] not a little bit, just some transparency,

[11:46] some communication from Ryan White and team

[11:48] on what the heck is going on

[11:50] with the Cactus Canyon, L.E. Waite.

[11:53] I'm hearing from people that only like less than 50

[11:56] have been made for the L.E.'s.

[11:58] I'm hearing full scale production hasn't really begun.

[12:01] And I'm just gonna say this, I challenge them

[12:04] and we all should just ask them,

[12:06] do a video tour of your manufacturing facility.

[12:10] Can you, can you on a random Tuesday, Ryan White,

[12:12] go on your Facebook page, go live

[12:15] and take us on a tour of what's happening

[12:18] at Chicago Gaming Company on a random Tuesday.

[12:21] Are games being made?

[12:23] Who's working on the assembly line?

[12:25] What are they doing every day?

[12:27] What is the holdup?

[12:29] And I wish we just got some of that.

[12:31] I mean, people paid for this game over a year ago.

[12:34] And now those people who ordered the game,

[12:36] you know, they're seeing these James Bond L.E.'s land.

[12:39] I think we're gonna see more Scooby-Doo's in homes

[12:42] by the end of January,

[12:43] then we're gonna see Cactus Canyon remake L.E.'s.

[12:46] And that's pretty sad.

[12:47] I think CGC's probably been

[12:50] one of the biggest disappointments in 2022.

[12:53] And I really hope they can turn it around.

[12:56] I don't know what the issue is

[12:57] because they won't tell us what the issue is.

[13:00] All right, let's go over to Multimorphic.

[13:02] P3 Multimorphic or Multimorphic P3, I always get it wrong.

[13:06] And look, as a marketer, it should never be confusing.

[13:09] And the fact that I'm confused by it

[13:10] maybe means it should just be called something.

[13:13] It's the Multimorphic P3?

[13:15] Is it P3 by Multimorphic?

[13:17] Okay, okay, but is it gonna be a P4?

[13:19] Like, is there gonna be a P5?

[13:21] I'm just confused.

[13:22] Okay, this is another company where production

[13:24] just seems to be operating at a snail's pace.

[13:28] Now, here's what's crazy.

[13:29] It's like, come this February,

[13:31] it'll be an entire year since Weird Owl

[13:34] was revealed to the world.

[13:36] It's not that people don't want their Weird Owls.

[13:38] It's just that making them seems to be almost impossible.

[13:42] And this is another company where I don't even know

[13:45] if five are going out a week.

[13:47] I don't even know if like 10 are going out a month.

[13:50] It is absolutely shrouded in mystery

[13:53] how many games Multimorphic is sending out to people.

[13:57] I don't see many unboxings.

[13:59] I don't see many for sale.

[14:00] I don't know what's happening.

[14:01] I do know this, like this isn't good.

[14:04] If you're a boutique, you've gotta figure out a system

[14:06] in which you can have a consistent cadence of manufacturing.

[14:10] I have to assume that every day,

[14:12] could just think about it for a minute,

[14:13] how do you pay people to be on the assembly line?

[14:16] If the assembly line is not working every day.

[14:20] So then what do you do?

[14:21] Are you hiring temp workers that just show up

[14:24] one day a week to start to put stuff together?

[14:27] So then what do those people do the rest of the week?

[14:29] They've gotta find consistent employment.

[14:31] You can't really do manufacturing like this.

[14:34] This whole starting and stopping,

[14:37] it's more like a glorified garage build

[14:40] than it is a pinball manufacturing company.

[14:43] And then it's like this,

[14:43] why would you even try to manufacture it yourself

[14:46] if that's how it's working?

[14:48] See, I think Jerry should go to like American pinball

[14:51] or go somewhere else where there's manufacturing

[14:53] and be like, hey, why don't we combine forces

[14:56] and work together on making games

[14:58] and have one factory putting together machines?

[15:01] We can have one line making weird owl.

[15:02] We could have one line making like the remaining

[15:05] October Fest parts.

[15:06] Why not do it that way?

[15:08] It seems really silly to me that multi-morphic for its size

[15:12] is like trying to do it like on its own

[15:14] because they're looking a lot like the other company

[15:16] doing it on its own and that's Haggis Pinball.

[15:19] You know, and Haggis isn't the same boat.

[15:21] It's like they're trickling out games.

[15:23] And I mean like you could count on one hand

[15:26] how many games are being made a week.

[15:29] I don't know how you keep a manufacturing company

[15:32] viable like that, but I bet these crews

[15:35] at both multi-morphic and at Haggis

[15:38] are such skeleton crews.

[15:40] I mean, these companies probably only have like 10

[15:44] or less employees each.

[15:45] Think about that for a minute.

[15:47] 10 or less employees to manufacture a pinball machine.

[15:52] It's hard enough for me to put together

[15:53] a good PowerPoint presentation to a client

[15:56] with a team of 10 people thinking about ideas.

[15:59] And these companies are trying to make

[16:01] super complex mechanical devices with hardly anybody.

[16:05] I think Stern has 400 people making games.

[16:09] And it always begs the question,

[16:11] if you can't make it, why are you in it?

[16:14] If you can't make the games, why are you in the hobby?

[16:18] You can't be making money like this.

[16:20] There's just no way you can make money like this.

[16:22] All right, who's next?

[16:23] Okay, let's talk about American Pinball next.

[16:25] Now, well look, we're all waiting

[16:27] for this Dennis Nordman game.

[16:28] And I've heard from people who have seen it.

[16:30] They say the game is really packed.

[16:32] There's a really long ramp going up the middle.

[16:34] I think it's gonna be galactic space force

[16:37] or galactic tank force.

[16:39] I think the cabinet's gonna be really unique.

[16:41] And the question is, where is it?

[16:44] Right now, American Pinball is rerunning some Oktoberfest.

[16:48] I don't know if Houdini's next.

[16:50] I don't know if they've made all of the legends of Vahalas.

[16:53] The big question mark for American Pinball is simply this.

[16:57] Did they wait too long?

[16:59] And I mean it when I say it, like, did they wait too long?

[17:01] All of these games now, you know,

[17:03] between like nine to $10,000,

[17:05] they're gonna have to figure out a way

[17:07] to get some excitement going for this game.

[17:09] And we have no idea now, like what the ETA is on this game.

[17:14] It's even like not even that much fun to speculate.

[17:17] All we know is it's coming out sometime in 2023.

[17:21] I think it's obvious, ladies and gentlemen,

[17:23] that there are still tremendous supply chain issues

[17:27] happening in the pinball world.

[17:28] There is still a tremendously difficult time,

[17:31] like getting parts from China for these companies.

[17:34] This is not an easy time to be making pinball.

[17:37] It's actually probably the hardest time ever

[17:40] to put together a pinball machine and make a profit.

[17:43] That is why I am surprised.

[17:45] I'm just gonna say it.

[17:46] I'm surprised that all of these companies are still around.

[17:49] Like they're still hanging on.

[17:51] Some of them are financed by outside annuities,

[17:54] but some of these are not.

[17:55] If you're in it under your own investments,

[17:58] those are the companies that have the biggest chance

[18:00] of going under.

[18:01] And those are the companies like Dutch and Haggis

[18:03] and Multimorphic, you need to keep making games.

[18:07] Pinball brothers, you need to keep making games.

[18:10] You know, it's good to see Dutch pinball

[18:11] is getting games out the door

[18:13] and they're increasing their manufacturing capabilities.

[18:16] I also respect Dutch pinball now

[18:18] because they actually show us like what's going on

[18:20] behind the scenes and people are getting

[18:22] their big Lebowski's.

[18:23] Like it's no mystery anymore.

[18:25] I don't know how long it's gonna take

[18:27] to all the EAs are made whole.

[18:29] At least out of all the boutiques,

[18:30] I think Dutch pinball has really been the one

[18:33] that can show they can manufacture the best

[18:35] with all of the different variables

[18:37] everyone else is sort of struggling with.

[18:39] All right, let's talk about this real quick

[18:41] and talk about FOMO and how FOMO has been used

[18:44] as the predominant marketing tool to drive sales and pinball.

[18:47] And these companies are not foolish for doing it.

[18:49] It works so many times.

[18:51] So many of us have like bought a game

[18:54] before ever seeing much of it, before seeing gameplay,

[18:57] before seeing the code.

[18:58] All we had to see was the art.

[19:00] We got the theme, we got the layout

[19:03] and it was like take my money now.

[19:04] But I wanna play devil's advocate and say

[19:06] that I actually do like seeing the fact

[19:08] that Spooky Pinball is making 1,969 Scooby-Doo's.

[19:14] They are available and it's somewhat refreshing.

[19:18] If you want the game, you can get it.

[19:20] If you want the game, you don't have to buy day one.

[19:24] If you want the game, you're gonna be able to wait

[19:26] to see gameplay before you make up your mind.

[19:29] And it got me thinking about this entire hobby

[19:31] a little bit, a little bit philosophical.

[19:33] And if you think about it and you drill down

[19:36] to what is the point of a pinball machine in our lives?

[19:39] Like think about that for a minute.

[19:41] Why do we want a pinball machine?

[19:42] It's a toy.

[19:44] It's a lot of fun.

[19:45] And I would argue that as an adult,

[19:47] the reason why we put these things in our homes

[19:50] and go out to play them is that they cure us

[19:53] from the worst condition of living, which is boredom.

[19:57] And I've noticed this more and more.

[19:58] And as an adult with a new child,

[20:00] the boredom is really a difficult thing to deal with.

[20:03] Boredom is something that we don't really talk about enough

[20:06] as adults, just in culture in general.

[20:09] Why we get bored, right?

[20:10] How things get monotonous, how as a grown adult,

[20:14] your life can start to get repetitive

[20:16] that like every day can feel like the same day.

[20:19] I think for a lot of us out there,

[20:21] like a lot of our lives are spent

[20:23] like trying to cure that boredom.

[20:25] Some of us cure it with like trying new restaurants

[20:28] and learning a hobby or learning a new skill

[20:30] or reading a book or playing some video games.

[20:33] But so much of our free time in my world at least

[20:36] is spent trying not to be bored.

[20:39] I get antsy.

[20:40] And the older I get, the more and more

[20:41] I feel like time is really limited.

[20:44] And I wanna make sure I'm not wasting time.

[20:47] And the irony in all of my like pursuit of happiness

[20:50] and ending the boredom I feel on a daily basis

[20:53] is I end up with like repetition.

[20:55] And you think about it for a minute.

[20:56] Like how many of us like go to Pinside every single day?

[21:00] How many of us read about pinball every single day?

[21:03] There's nothing really new to learn every single day,

[21:05] but yet we find ourselves creatures obsessed

[21:08] with like a routine.

[21:10] And we get into a routine and we keep doing it

[21:12] and doing it and doing it.

[21:14] And I've noticed in the pinball space too,

[21:16] there's a lot of that.

[21:17] The thing too is like when you buy something

[21:18] like a pinball machine,

[21:20] think about the mental journey we go on.

[21:22] Like we're normally like really excited

[21:24] to like speculate about what's coming up

[21:27] from these manufacturers.

[21:28] We use our imaginations.

[21:30] We dream about the possibilities of what could be

[21:33] in a Keith Elwin back to the future.

[21:35] What could Jaws Pinball be like?

[21:37] What could Toy Story be like?

[21:39] It's fun to think about what it's gonna be

[21:41] because there's mystery there.

[21:43] And we spent a lot of like mental capacity

[21:46] imagining and dreaming what it's gonna be.

[21:48] Like, because remember these are still just toys

[21:51] and we're all grown adults who are now obsessing over a toy

[21:55] that we're not quite sure what the final toy is gonna be.

[21:58] And that's fun.

[21:59] And for the most part,

[22:00] that's what drives a lot of pinside is that speculation.

[22:04] That cures a lot of our boredom

[22:06] is just using our imagination

[22:08] about what these games are gonna be

[22:09] and all the speculation

[22:10] and all the community getting together,

[22:12] right on pinside, on Facebook,

[22:15] sort of talking about what's next from each company.

[22:17] I don't know if you guys feel this way,

[22:18] but whenever a game is revealed,

[22:20] there's always like that moment of like giddiness,

[22:22] but then there's also that moment

[22:24] where you're just like,

[22:25] well, it's still just another stern.

[22:27] It's just another pinball machine.

[22:29] There have been so few times,

[22:31] and I've been covering this hobby for eight years,

[22:34] there have been so few times where a game actually exceeded

[22:38] what I thought it would be,

[22:39] where a game had more magic in it than I thought it would be,

[22:43] where I saw creativity on a level

[22:45] that I never could have imagined.

[22:47] And maybe my expectations are just too high,

[22:50] but I would argue they're not.

[22:51] I would argue for these prices,

[22:53] we should be seeing a lot more in these pinball machines.

[22:56] And the moment you walk down a row

[22:58] of like Valley Williams games,

[23:00] and you see what they used to put into machines

[23:02] when the creative brief was this, back in the day,

[23:05] the creative brief was how can we make this world

[23:08] under glass so exciting,

[23:09] not to compete with other pinball,

[23:12] but we have to pull people away from Street Fighter II,

[23:15] from Donkey Kong, from Daytona USA, right?

[23:18] Mortal Kombat, like they were making these pinball machines

[23:21] to really be as magical as possible,

[23:24] because they needed operators to make money off of them.

[23:27] And for operators to make money off of them,

[23:29] they really needed to be a world under glass

[23:32] because they were competing

[23:33] with all of the arcade machines of the day.

[23:36] And arcade machines were still far more popular than pinball.

[23:40] 22,000 Adams families were sold,

[23:43] the most popular pinball machine of all time.

[23:45] I think Donkey Kong had like 200,000 were made.

[23:48] And Street Fighter II, forget it,

[23:50] over 2 million, I think Street Fighter IIs were made,

[23:52] iterations of Street Fighter were put out into the world.

[23:55] You know, and so like the market trend now,

[23:57] like as I see like all of these games

[23:59] and how expensive they are,

[24:01] and like we're buying before seeing stuff,

[24:03] I think it's really refreshing

[24:05] that Spooky Pinball did it this way.

[24:07] And here's the thing, I'm wondering if we're all starting

[24:09] to get a bit fatigued by this whole like Ellie model,

[24:13] because when you really drill down

[24:14] and you ask yourselves, why is it as grown adults

[24:18] who buy these machines,

[24:20] why do we need a version of it

[24:22] that is a little bit nicer than the version next to it?

[24:26] Why do we need to beat our chest and say,

[24:28] hey, I have one of these, you don't have one of these,

[24:31] these are sold out?

[24:33] Like why is it?

[24:34] Like why do we wanna live in a world like that?

[24:36] And I mean it, I'm playing devil's advocate

[24:38] because I'm always like, you know me, I love the super rare,

[24:41] I love the high end stuff,

[24:42] I love stuff that is like sought after.

[24:44] But if you really do think about it,

[24:46] owning one of these like sought after super rare games

[24:51] is not gonna make your life any better.

[24:53] Someone who's playing a medieval madness royal edition

[24:57] is having no more fun than someone who's playing

[25:00] another Ellie version of medieval madness

[25:03] from Chicago gaming company.

[25:04] And yet when someone is listing a medieval madness royal

[25:08] edition for sale on Pinside,

[25:10] they are asking $30,000 for it.

[25:13] Why is that?

[25:14] Is that person gonna have $20,000 more fun

[25:18] than the person who bought it for $10,000?

[25:21] Every single person who owns a Ghostbusters premium

[25:25] is having as much fun as someone who has a Ghostbusters LE.

[25:30] And the truth is this, we place value in vanity.

[25:34] All of that is a vanity play.

[25:36] It's all just aesthetics.

[25:38] None of it is actually changing the experience,

[25:41] especially in pinball

[25:42] because when you stand over an Ellie and a premium,

[25:46] you are usually staring at the same exact play field,

[25:49] the same exact play field art, the same exact mechs,

[25:53] the same shots, when you look up at the screen,

[25:56] you're getting the same exact code

[25:58] coming at you in the same exact way.

[26:01] There's like no real difference.

[26:03] Like I could understand like paying more money

[26:06] for these Ellie's and other editions

[26:08] if they actually gave like unique code

[26:10] or some experience in it

[26:12] that really differentiated the game.

[26:14] You know, like they did with Tron, Ellie,

[26:16] and you had like the Daft Punk multi-ball.

[26:18] But for the most part,

[26:19] we absolutely are throwing thousands and thousands

[26:23] and thousands of dollars at stuff

[26:25] that isn't really giving us any more enjoyment.

[26:28] The only thing it's doing, and we know this,

[26:30] the only thing it's doing is it's prettier on the eyes.

[26:34] And that's it.

[26:35] When you walk by an Ellie, it does look nicer.

[26:38] And that's it.

[26:39] And for some of you out there, that's what you want.

[26:41] You want to go down the row

[26:43] and you want to have the nicest looking collection imaginable.

[26:46] And I don't fault you for that.

[26:47] I get it.

[26:48] Like I was just talking to my friend Derek who bought a Porsche

[26:50] and he had a Porsche in a darker color.

[26:53] He didn't really like the color.

[26:54] And the moment he switched his color to like a brighter red,

[26:57] he's having twice as much fun with the vehicle

[27:00] because it's the color he wanted.

[27:02] And I think a lot of that is true with pinball.

[27:04] It's like you might have the premium of Ghostbusters

[27:08] and you love Ghostbusters so much,

[27:10] but you know deep down inside,

[27:12] you'd be happier if you had a Ghostbusters Ellie.

[27:15] But what I like about what Spooky is doing

[27:18] is this new model of theirs is blowing all of that up.

[27:22] It is blowing up that three tiered model.

[27:24] Even though they're offering three tiers,

[27:26] what they really want to do is make sure

[27:28] that everyone can get which version of the game they want.

[27:31] And if you want the nicest version,

[27:33] we will make it for you.

[27:34] And we won't create this like limited FOMO approach to it.

[27:39] And it's refreshing.

[27:40] I will say this, it is refreshing.

[27:42] It's refreshing to see that the game is not sold out yet.

[27:45] It's refreshing to know you're gonna be able to get it.

[27:48] It's refreshing to know that you can have exactly the game

[27:51] the way you want it.

[27:52] And maybe as a community,

[27:54] we should start demanding more and more

[27:56] of this behavior take place.

[27:57] The companies don't want it, the distros don't want it,

[28:01] they want the FOMO.

[28:03] I think pinball is gonna go through a period now,

[28:06] you know in which the flex on the super expensive stuff

[28:09] is gonna start to lose some of its luster.

[28:11] And I think for a lot of us,

[28:12] there's only so many years you can put up

[28:14] with this like chasing the LEs,

[28:16] chasing the rare versions of the game,

[28:18] watching people put these games up for sale

[28:20] for three times what they paid for them just a year ago,

[28:23] it gets exhausting.

[28:25] And I think we need to get back

[28:26] to just why these things exist.

[28:29] They're toys to cure our boredom.

[28:32] And let me tell you right now,

[28:33] and I mean this, jumping on a James Bond Pro for $6,700

[28:37] is more fun and will be more fun

[28:40] than spending $13,000 on an LE

[28:43] and trying to keep the game meant and waiting for code.

[28:46] Like the guy who buys the pro is gonna bang on it,

[28:49] enjoy it and he's gonna have

[28:50] the same exact gameplay experience you are.

[28:53] Trust me, I've seen that game.

[28:54] There's not a lot of gameplay experience

[28:56] that's gonna come with the premium.

[28:58] And that's all I'm saying is I go back and forth on this.

[29:01] Like and I like nice stuff, don't get me wrong.

[29:03] And I still like super rare versions of pinball machines,

[29:06] but man, it must have been so refreshing

[29:08] to be a pinball fanatic in the 1990s.

[29:11] You walked into an arcade and you saw Adam's family.

[29:15] You saw Toten, you saw Twilight Zone,

[29:18] you saw Indiana Jones, and when you went up to the machine,

[29:22] you just went up to play and enjoy the magic

[29:25] that that company put into that game.

[29:28] You weren't thinking about how limited was this game.

[29:31] You weren't thinking about the armor on the machine.

[29:33] You weren't thinking about playfield dimples.

[29:36] All you were doing was going up there

[29:38] and enjoying pinball the way it was meant to be enjoyed.

[29:43] And I really do love this hobby because nowadays,

[29:46] like we could enjoy it that way,

[29:48] or you could be an OCD collector,

[29:51] or you could just be a guy that makes hardly any money a year

[29:54] who loves Scooby-Doo, saves up enough pennies

[29:57] and buys a standard edition of the game

[30:00] and just puts it in his home

[30:02] and has a great time playing that pinball machine every day.

[30:05] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canada Club.

[30:07] I'm not even sure if this podcast page said so.

[30:09] I don't know if I'm just contradicting myself,

[30:11] but email me at canadepinball.com.

[30:14] If you have any questions, we will talk to you soon.

[30:16] And they stay there, and they stay there,

[30:19] and they stay there.

[30:20] Up, down, up, down, up, down.

[30:23] Cause all I do is sleep, sleep, sleep.

[30:26] And if you go in here, put your hands in the air,

[30:29] make them stay there.
