[00:00] What if babies ain't never been found to run?

[00:06] What if babies will do the same for you?

[00:18] You know, I didn't want to do another Pinside Babies podcast,

[00:22] but I've been pushed over the edge by all of you,

[00:27] crying and moaning and complaining about the Beatles' pinball.

[00:33] It is like nothing I've seen in a very, very long time.

[00:37] And I have to say this, all of you moaning and groaning.

[00:41] I think you're missing the entire fucking point of this game.

[00:47] And I'm going to break it down for you guys, real fucking simple on this game.

[00:53] And when you see this game, the way it's intended to be seen,

[00:57] I think you're going to see it in a completely different light

[01:01] and feel so stupid that you've spent the entire day moaning and groaning like a bunch of fucking babies.

[01:09] And I can't even make this stuff up.

[01:11] I want to read what some of you guys are saying about the Beatles' pinball.

[01:15] I'm going to go down a list of comments from Pinside.

[01:19] Woohoo! That's terrible.

[01:22] I'm a huge fan of the Beatles, but come on, this is rubbish.

[01:26] I wouldn't piss on that thing if it was on fire.

[01:31] Costco Batman looks better than this.

[01:35] What a turd, but still looks better than Avengers.

[01:39] Sure, it's great to have Camacal back.

[01:42] I would go out on a limb here and say it will be quite some time before they say it.

[01:48] I wouldn't push this thing off of a cliff for fear that it would make the bottom of the cliff look hideous.

[01:58] Good grief, exactly how old do they think we are.

[02:03] Seems to me they noticed the recent love for seawitch, saw the love for TNA, and missed the fucking point.

[02:10] If they spent one million on just acquiring the license, how much are they going to sell these monstrosities for?

[02:17] Seawitch is beautiful, this is utterly, unrementingly hideous, and it looks really, really cheap.

[02:25] Everyone, do you even hear what you're saying about this machine?

[02:32] Literally, none of you really get the point.

[02:35] And even in my last podcast, I was like, yeah, I think Stern's making this for the Beatles collectors.

[02:41] Yada yada yada.

[02:42] Right, it's another Compound title.

[02:44] The other Compound title was a re-skin of Batman.

[02:47] Are people fucking shocked?

[02:49] Are you really fucking shocked that Joe Camacal and Stern Pimball have once again done exactly what they did before.

[02:57] They took a game and they made a new game based on an old game with a new theme that people fucking love.

[03:05] And what happened last time?

[03:07] Now here's the thing.

[03:08] Here's the problem with this whole launch, and it's the reason why you guys are bitching and moaning,

[03:13] because you're not taking a step back.

[03:17] All right, you're not thinking about what this game is supposed to be.

[03:22] Let me break it down for you guys, because you don't want to be adults, you don't want to think about it.

[03:27] You just want to kick and scream, because this Pimball machine doesn't look like a modern music pin, like Aerospace or Stern,

[03:37] or Iron Maiden, and you think the Beatles should have received a brand new game that was like one of those games that would have all this deep code,

[03:46] that would have all these wizard modes, that would have all this shit.

[03:49] And I'm telling you, if you think that way, and you're upset because you want it Beatles to get a pin like that,

[03:56] you are a stupid motherfucker.

[04:00] Here's the thing.

[04:02] Here's what they did, and this is all Stern's fault for not revealing this thing properly, and not telling the story of why this pin is what this pin is.

[04:13] Okay, here's what the Beatles is supposed to be.

[04:17] Stern Pimball made the only Beatles Pimball machine ever made, and what their approach was.

[04:26] Here's what their creative design approach was.

[04:29] I don't even know this because I talk to them, but I think this is what they were going for, and when you think about it, it makes fucking sense.

[04:38] What they wanted to do was they wanted to make a Pimball machine that looks like it should have been what the Beatles got in Pimball format back in the 60s.

[04:52] Alright, so let me clarify that for you numbscalls on Pinside who keep crying.

[04:58] This machine is supposed to look like the Pimball machine, the Beatles would have got, if the Beatles would have had a Pimball machine back in 1964.

[05:09] If you're looking to do that lens, does it not now make fucking sense why this machine looks the way it does?

[05:16] This is Stern Pimball reimagining what a Beatles Pimball machine would have been back in the day with a modern touch.

[05:26] Alright, with an LCD screen, with modern sound system, with modern components inside it.

[05:33] But here's the other part.

[05:35] If you can't understand why this game is like a re-skin of sea witch, let me also break it down for you.

[05:42] They wanted to make probably the most popular band of all time.

[05:47] They wanted to make a collectible Pimball machine that anyone, I mean anyone, could walk up to, look at it, get excited by the colorful artwork and the Beatles theme and the music.

[06:02] Here's the novelty part. Anyone could walk up this to this machine and fucking play it and figure out how to shoot it within 10 seconds.

[06:14] And what a novelty that is, that Stern Pimball is making a Beatles Pimball machine that anybody can enjoy.

[06:21] And I hate to say this, but where you pin-side guys don't fucking get it.

[06:26] You just don't get it. 99.9% of people walk up to modern Pimball machines and they have a terrible fucking experience.

[06:33] A terrible experience. They don't know what to do. They don't know what to shoot for. They don't know what's the game's about.

[06:40] They have no idea what to hit. They have no idea. You can walk up to Beatles. And within a few seconds, you know exactly what to do.

[06:50] Thank fucking God for that. And that is the point of this machine. To be a modern version of what a 1964 version of a Beatles Pimball machine is.

[07:02] And I don't understand why you don't fucking get that. The colors, the art, the fun sort of psychedelic Austin powers, wacky sort of weird, what you're calling atrocious.

[07:13] This is what the art of the 1960s was like. It was fun. It was out there. It was colorful. It was vibrant.

[07:19] You haven't even seen what this game looks like in real life. You haven't seen what the cabinets look like.

[07:25] You haven't seen what the full package looks like. And yet you're all complaining like a bunch of fucking babies.

[07:31] So cool. Like what? You want to not have the game? You think it should have been different? I'm sorry.

[07:38] But I'm actually happy for once that there is a game out there that people can actually fucking play.

[07:44] That isn't like being deconstructed because of the code and the wizard modes and how deep is it and how, you know, how, how many like ramps are there and how many that, whatever.

[07:55] It's a fucking simple, beautiful work of art. If you don't think this game is beautiful, I mean, look, I'm not here to say like I'm not going to get an art argument with you, dang bats.

[08:06] But this game is going to look fucking nice. If you don't think it's going to look awesome, you're out of your mind.

[08:14] Do you think that Kamikaw and Kapow and Stern and Christopher Franchi are going to release like three ugly looking Beatles pinball machines and put this next to see which which you guys are like see which is beautiful.

[08:30] I get the fuck out of here. This art package blows the sea which art package away. The sea which art package looks like something I drew in the fucking third fucking grade.

[08:41] And you're talking shit about this art package. Like you are so fucking spoiled, pinside babies that you, you can't even fucking like appreciate the art package on Beatles.

[08:54] Seriously, and the fact of the matter is someone put up a fucking poll like which one October, Fester Beatles and it was like 66 votes for October, Fess and six for Beatles.

[09:07] Seriously, what mission are you guys on to prove that you are wronged that Stern fucking, you know, Stern has upset you.

[09:19] And so now you're actually going to go and vote for what people have already claimed to be one of the worst art packages that they've seen in a long time in October, Fess.

[09:28] And oh yeah, you just, you just taught Stern a lesson. Let me tell you something right now. And I hate to break it down like this because I have nothing against AP.

[09:37] Stern is going to sell more Beatles pinball machines in one week than probably American pinball will sell in like six months of October, Fess.

[09:48] And that is just like the way it is because I think when you guys see this game flipping and you see and you understand the concept of this game, right?

[09:59] That people are going to want one, right? Maybe not like 1964 of them, but this is like what just kills me about a lot of you out there.

[10:11] Is this game now gives you some variety in your pinball selection so that not every game you have like is a fucking super complex like chess game where your friends who come over that don't have beer bellies and don't fucking sit on pinside and don't want to study fucking rule sets can actually have fun playing.

[10:34] I think it's just it's amazing to me how pinball went from being such a universally like easy to understand game that gave joy to millions of people to becoming what it is today, which is just an overly complex intimidating fucking game that only a bunch of like die hards and blow hards who study these games all day long can fucking figure out like that's pinball.

[11:00] Like Brenda doesn't enjoy going up to fucking Batman because it's like it's too fucking hard. It's too fucking hard these games to fucking explain to people, but her and I could have a lot more fun playing Beatles together.

[11:12] And I think that is the point of this game. You know who's going to buy this game? Like some fucking Beatles fan who's got a fucking cool apartment who wants to throw one in. It's a fucking work of art.

[11:23] I mean shit man if you want to put a pinball game in your home as like a fucking like art piece that anyone can play when they come over what are you going to pick?

[11:36] What are you going to pick? Huh? I mean literally I say this in in in in in response to the endless hours of you guys moaning and groaning about this game like you can't understand like why this game is what it is.

[11:50] It's a throwback celebration of a pin that that is what Stern's interpretation is interpretation of of what a Beatles pin would have been back in the day.

[12:02] And also for you guys crying about it being a risk in a sea witch I don't get it. It's like Stern can't fucking win. There's only so many layouts you can do with you know when it comes to like E.M.s and I know there's tons of them, but people fucking love sea witch.

[12:16] But here's the other part 99% of people don't own a sea witch haven't played a sea witch. Why not start with the design that they know people love and then enhance it and make it Beatles.

[12:28] They've made so many fucking little changes that it literally isn't the same game and we know we're going to hear from Stern and they're going to tell us all the hours they spent changing it from what it was to what it is.

[12:40] And all the man hours that went into like everything that made this game a reality and the only thing that doesn't take any work is to log on the pin side, put one thumb up your butt and type complaints with your other thumb.

[12:53] And that's what the majority of like people are doing and it's great. I love that this game this game can't be like panned by like crazy levy because it's not good for tournaments.

[13:04] You know I all the same cast of characters complaining about everything like ice man complain about it everyone complaining about it everyone's not going to buy it everyone thinks it's stupid.

[13:14] Well it's stupid if you look at it and are expecting to get an iron maiden or a metallical and aro smith or a fucking like acdc pin that's Beatles. Yeah you're disappointed because you looked at it all wrong.

[13:30] What I'm asking all you guys to do is stop running to the flame and stop like over reacting and emotionally reacting to this pinball machine without trying to understand the concept now I also blame Stern that they literally just drop this thing into the world without explaining the concept of this pin that's on them and this is the problem with marketing why marketing and pinball fucking sucks.

[13:58] Because if you had a better reveal of this game where they explained you what their strategy was we wanted to make what looked like a nineteen sixty four pin but modernize it and we took our best old design and we created what we believe is the is the Beatles pin they always deserved and we're happy to present it and here it is you know they need to tell it and explain it instead they didn't they just released a video and it was like man it was like throwing chum in the wall.

[14:27] Chum in the water and you guys are like a bunch of fucking sharks that are going on a feeding frenzy just ripping this thing apart ripping Christopher French is art apart ripping apart the fact that it's like a re-skin you know bullshit bullshit I think it's bullshit I think you guys are over reacting you sound fucking stupid and you're not understanding what the concept of this pin is and it's so kind of unfair to Stern that they have to take all of these fun and you know what I'm saying is that they're not going to be able to do this.

[14:57] Fucking lashes when they are also about to give you fucking monsters in a couple weeks when they gave you fucking Deadpool a couple months ago and every fucking four months they give you a new fucking pin and yet you're going to lash these guys for just doing a little bit something different that's designed for a different audience and they've got to listen to you moaning grown like a bunch of fucking babies seriously if I were Gary fucking Stern I'd be like fuck you guys we're at it here close up shop let's just go make fucking slot mission.

[15:27] I'm gonna go buy fucking October Fest are you are you are you fuck all you guys in that Paul who think October Fest is just like a bunch of fucking

[15:56] overfest is the is the better pin you're not going to go buy one you're going to do what you always do all you guys out there you fucking hate on Stern you shit on Stern and then you go buy the Stern you know it's like you just want to root against them and look I'm not the biggest Stern fanboy but in this case I literally took a step back I look at the thing I'm like why is everyone acting this way why does everyone expect that Stern has to do the same thing with every penny you know what Stern has earned the fucking right to make whatever you want to do.

[16:26] Whatever the fuck they want to go in any fucking direction they want and to create different types of variety because they fucking earn that right because they are the only ones that give you like four to five pinball machines a year and I think if fucking is so pathetic that pin side reacts the way they do and I don't care if you agree or disagree with me you know I look I'm the only podcast that fucking tell Stern when they fuck up and I'm also the one that's gonna like just get on their back a little bit.

[16:56] I'm gonna get into fed them a little bit here because honestly what the fuck people you're out of control step away from the computer

[17:04] real lives what this pin is look at it through the proper light and I think you're gonna see what their intention was when you finally stop wishing this were some like modern music pin.

[17:19] It was never supposed to be that do you disagree with me or do you agree with me you know what it is what it is we are entitled to our own opinions but I think the four to five the six is seven to eight pages of all the bitching people bang in their head against brick wall saying this thing is hideous this thing is fucking hideous you guys are fucking out of your minds meanwhile some fucking dingle berries trying to sell his twelve thousand five hundred dollar tron Ali you want to talk hideous put fucking tron Ali

[17:49] next to this thing and look at what's fucking hideous put every single stern before fucking zombie Eddie francey and dirty donkeys artwork and let's talk about what's hideous you know stern is now giving you the best looking games

[18:02] Stern is now giving you the best code Stern is now giving you the most variety Stern is now giving you the best themes but let's fucking tear them apart every time they do anything all right

[18:13] so I would have to like you know what fuck you guys we can't so monsters you don't fucking get it you know what we're gonna fucking make five version of the monsters and everyone works at stern is gonna get one and they're gonna have to sign a contract that they can't sell it to any of you fucking assholes seriously you guys literally literally should be ashamed of yourselves the way you fucking carry on on this game give it a fucking chance alright and stern fucking get the reveals right seriously

[18:43] nobody should have known that it was a sea which risk and nobody should have known all the details they've they you needed to launch this thing properly you needed to tell the story of this properly if you said from the very beginning we are gonna make the Beatles we're gonna give them the pin they should have had in 1964 we're gonna take our best old game see which and we are gonna make a Beatles pinball machine and we can't wait to show it to you in a year that's all they needed to do the said expectations instead this kind of secrecy a kind of bit them this time

[19:13] it also was just another weird launch with like no real story they need to stop doing this they are just dropping and running these things and it's like they don't give a shit to tell the proper story

[19:25] they could have told this story at expo they could have set the expectations better but instead again they just let people fucking moaning grown anyway

[19:36] I think it's a good thing that there's a pinball machine out there that like the casual person can walk up to you and fucking play right seriously people think about it invite all of your friends over who don't know anything about pinball stand them in front of Beatles stand them in front of pirates of the Caribbean and tell them both hey tell me what to do in each game and watch them go up to Beatles and actually knock down the drop targets okay you got to drop the drop targets and

[20:06] it's real simple you know there's not that much to hit and then you drop the drop targets then you hit the jackpot and that's really, really what the game will be about right and and go up the pirates of the Caribbean and watch your friends just all fall over backwards and pretend to be dead because they can't figure out a fucking thing on the game alright.

[20:25] And look, it's okay that we have both.

[20:27] On one end of the spectrum, you can get a Beatles.

[20:30] And your wife and your kids and all your friends can enjoy it when they come over.

[20:33] On the other end of the spectrum, you can get a pirate to the Caribbean.

[20:37] Again, that nobody understands not even Keith.

[20:40] I bet Keith goes home every night and it was like, I don't know what the fuck I did.

[20:44] I don't even know how to play my own game.

[20:46] I mean, yeah, like, I got a wizard mode within a wizard mode within a wizard mode.

[20:50] But I'm gonna go on like, you know, and I'm gonna go on every stream every night

[20:54] and I'm gonna tell people, hey, here's, it's real simple.

[20:56] All you gotta do is you hit here, you hit here, you hit here, you hit here, you hit here,

[20:59] then you punch yourself in the dig and then all of a sudden you're in a wizard mode.

[21:02] I don't even know what the fuck movie it is.

[21:03] It's movie three, but you hit movie two and then you light the multiplier and then the dispens

[21:08] and then the treasure trunk and then you, the ship's rocking and then,

[21:11] and then you literally, literally, you should just like, take yourself and throw yourself

[21:14] to the fucking window because I designed the most complex game ever.

[21:17] But not even Jack understands.

[21:19] It's so fucking complex that I fucking told Jack had to spell his name

[21:23] with fucking 18 letters.

[21:24] That's how I do my games.

[21:26] You can spell Jack using 18 letters if you're Keith.

[21:30] That's how fucking good I am at Pinball Design.

[21:32] Anyway, people, I'm done.

[21:34] It's late at night.

[21:36] I'm not even making any fucking sense.

[21:38] The thing is this.

[21:39] The thing is this.

[21:40] Pinside is a toilet bowl.

[21:43] And don't be just another turd inside that toilet bowl.

[21:49] Think a little bit.

[21:51] You're all smart.

[21:52] You all have decent jobs for the most part.

[21:55] Just try to understand that your beautiful complex games can also coexist with this game.

[22:03] And I think when you see this thing, you're going to realize what they were going for.

[22:06] That's it.

[22:07] I'm going to bed.

[22:08] Get off of Pinside.

[22:09] You know, exercise more.

[22:11] Eat healthy.

[22:12] You guys are really angry about Pinball.

[22:15] Er, no Pinball.

[22:16] The game came out.

[22:17] It doesn't make me happy.

[22:18] I'm going to go to a forum and scream about it.

[22:21] And my life will change.

[22:23] How?

[22:24] Because other people out there, he did too.

[22:27] I'm going to say that October Fest is so much better.

[22:30] Yeah.

[22:31] Hey, okay, cool.

[22:32] Hey, I'm your local distributor.

[22:33] Do you want to put in an order for October Fest?

[22:35] No, fuck no, man.

[22:36] I'm buying monsters.

[22:37] But fuck Stern.

[22:38] No, wait, not fuck Stern.

[22:39] I need Stern.

[22:40] I'm so confused.

[22:42] My name is Crazy Levy.

[22:45] Come to Crazy Levy's where we teach you how to score high in games.

[22:50] I'll never buy.

[22:51] Welcome to Pinside.

[22:53] Fuck all y'all.

[22:54] Have a good night.
