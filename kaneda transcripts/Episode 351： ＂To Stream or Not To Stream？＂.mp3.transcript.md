[00:00] We're for without you.

[00:04] We're for without you.

[00:07] I can't live.

[00:13] We're for without you.

[00:16] That's...

[00:17] ...butch.

[00:20] We're for all of you.

[00:23] Welcome to episode 351 of Canadian Spinball Podcast,

[00:27] the only pinball podcast that will dedicate this show to the haters out there.

[00:32] You know who they are, the guys who are always on the pinside complaining about this show.

[00:38] And I love it. I want to thank each and every one of you for listening in to every episode.

[00:43] I don't think we'd be number one.

[00:45] If it wasn't for all the people who can't stand listening yet can't stop listening.

[00:51] So thank you all of you out there. You know who you are.

[00:53] You're like sitting back in your rocking chairs right now.

[00:55] You're like, damn it. He knows I listen to every episode.

[00:59] So here's the deal.

[01:01] You know I saw someone saying like he's not responding to something else that happened in the pinball world.

[01:05] I'm just going to say it like this.

[01:07] If anyone wants to call me out or say stuff about me on other pinball podcasts, that's totally cool.

[01:12] Here's the deal.

[01:14] They can email me at canadapinballadgmail.com and they can come on the show and they can air whatever issues they have.

[01:21] And we can discuss it like grown men.

[01:23] But I don't really care. I don't have too much time to listen to all these other pinball podcasts.

[01:27] So here's what we're going to do.

[01:29] We're going to do what we always do.

[01:31] We're going to go down a list of what's going on in the pinball world.

[01:33] The main topic I want to talk about today is pinball streaming.

[01:37] I want to give you some of my thoughts about it because I saw someone put up an interesting thread about pinball streaming.

[01:42] And whether or not they think it's good for pinball.

[01:46] But first and foremost, I want to congratulate somebody.

[01:49] Something really cool happened.

[01:51] It happened in my hometown in New York City.

[01:54] I want to congratulate Crazy Levy.

[01:57] It's crazy levy, right?

[01:58] Not Levy.

[01:59] On getting certification for the New York City pinball championship.

[02:04] And I think the reason why this is big is you have to understand.

[02:07] Pinball was once banned by New York City as a gambling device.

[02:10] Okay.

[02:11] Then we all know Mr. Sharp hit the shot, heard around the world.

[02:14] But I want to read what he wrote on pinside and just say good job in getting the pinball.

[02:18] And get the recognition I think pinball deserves because this is one of the greatest cities for pinball players.

[02:24] I mean, you don't have to own a pinball machine if you live in New York City.

[02:28] So he wrote today is a truly a monumentous day in pinball history.

[02:33] From once being banned in our gleaming metropolis 43 years later, pinball is now not only legal but officially recognized and decorated by the city of New York.

[02:44] Behold the official citation issued by city council speaker Corey Johnson celebrating the New York City pinball championship 2019.

[02:54] We couldn't be happier that the greatest sea on the earth is recognized as one of the greatest pastimes.

[03:00] This has recognized one of the greatest pastimes the silver ball.

[03:03] And no, I didn't write this beyond some suggestions.

[03:07] Okay, someone over at the city council did some amazing homework and had some fun with this.

[03:11] So, okay, so here's the deal.

[03:13] If you want to go to the New York City pinball championships, it's May 17 through the 19th and you can get your ticket to NYC pinballchamps.com.

[03:20] And no, I will not be attending and there will be no disruption.

[03:25] I hope we can finally bury the hatchet. Everyone involved.

[03:28] I mean, I think Levy and I are probably two of the most outspoken pinball personalities in New York City.

[03:33] I actually look forward to having a beer with the dude one day soon over at Adam's place.

[03:38] He'll know what I'm talking about and Adam will as well.

[03:41] All right, so here's what I want to talk about.

[03:43] Pinball streaming.

[03:44] Is it good or bad?

[03:45] And I saw someone raise this question.

[03:47] And it's kind of like saying, is YouTube good or bad or is the internet good or bad?

[03:51] And I think it depends on how you look at it.

[03:54] Okay, now look, I don't think pinball streaming is like inherently a bad thing.

[03:58] I don't think it's a bad thing at all.

[04:00] I think there are lots of different kinds of pinball streams that are out there.

[04:05] So I think you have to look at this from different angles.

[04:09] So one angle is this.

[04:11] You know, if you want to see a game and be surprised by playing it for the first time,

[04:16] then watching someone play the game for three to four hours will most likely ruin your surprise of the game.

[04:23] Now, I don't think people tune in to pinball streams if they want to be surprised

[04:27] because then you're like, it's like spoiler alert.

[04:29] You're already ruining the game for yourself.

[04:31] I think people tune into a game to see how it shoots.

[04:35] I think that is just, you know, but watching how it shoots does not convey how you will feel when you shoot the pin.

[04:41] Okay, but here's my thing.

[04:42] Here's the most important thing for me.

[04:44] I think streaming a game before it's done is my big issue with pinball streaming.

[04:50] All right, that is my number one issue.

[04:52] Name me one other industry that does this that shows the world,

[04:57] the product before it's complete, right, before it's done.

[05:01] I want to give you a good example of this because I do think you only get one chance to make a first impression.

[05:08] I watched Cosmic Carnival by Suncoast Pinball being streamed on YouTube.

[05:13] They put up about like a nine minute stream of the game.

[05:15] All right, after three minutes, I turned it off.

[05:18] Why did I turn it off?

[05:20] Well, games clearly not done.

[05:22] There's no callouts whatsoever.

[05:24] It's a pretty boring stream.

[05:26] You can watch after two minutes, you get the entire thing.

[05:29] There's no reason to even watch eight minutes of it.

[05:32] So why am I seeing this game with all these inserts and all these apparent modes?

[05:37] Yet there's nothing in the game yet.

[05:39] So you've shown me the game and I just see a few orbits and a few ramps.

[05:43] And now what, when am I?

[05:44] I'm just bored.

[05:45] I saw something.

[05:47] I didn't like it.

[05:48] And I'm beginning to formulate a negative opinion about it.

[05:52] And so if you're going to stream your product and your pinball game to the world,

[05:57] wouldn't you wait until it's done?

[06:00] And I think that's my big issue.

[06:02] I think a lot of stuff we see is a work in progress.

[06:06] And I don't think that's ever been beneficial to any pinball company ever, ever.

[06:13] And so I think that's one of my main issues, right?

[06:17] So what else?

[06:18] I had a little note here too.

[06:19] I don't really do notes.

[06:20] So very few games, you can't really formulate a hard, I'm going to buy this or not buy this based on a stream.

[06:28] You still have to get time on a machine.

[06:31] If you don't buy a game because of a stream, that stream must have shown you something horrendous.

[06:37] But also if people are having fun on a stream playing a game, that also does not mean that you will enjoy it.

[06:44] But I think people could see a stream like Willy Wonka and get a sense of how the game shoots or the black knight or Batman or Hobbit.

[06:51] Right? I mean, you're going to get the basic geometry down.

[06:54] Now, I also think that one of the issues with pinball is this.

[06:58] There's no game rankings system.

[07:01] So when a video game comes out, you have an aggregate of different media outlets, like a Rod and Tomatoes for movies, good example.

[07:09] There's none of that in pinball.

[07:10] So how do you know a game is going to be good or not before you buy it, unless you play it?

[07:16] Now, some of you out there have access to games early on.

[07:19] Some don't. Some of you can get to shows, some can't.

[07:22] So maybe the only place you can see a game for the first time is on a stream.

[07:27] Now, the only games we notice, the only games you have to rush to buy are the LEs and the collector's editions and anything that's limited.

[07:35] And that's very few. Right? Very few. It's like less than 5%.

[07:39] I would say even less than that, are the total number of limited edition games that you must move quickly to get or else you'll get locked out of buying one.

[07:49] And even then, the games always come up for sale.

[07:51] So there's really no need to have to sort of like formulate a hard line position on a game based on a stream of a game.

[08:01] Okay, so I think the advice is always get on the machine and find if you like it or not.

[08:05] The other thing is this, these three to four hour streams are so if you look at them just in terms of duration, it's ridiculous.

[08:11] Right? Why are we watching a pinball stream that is longer than a Lord of the Rings movie?

[08:18] But the reason why they're three to four hours long is they're not intended for any of you to watch for three to four hours.

[08:23] It's just to give people a window of time by which to tune in, which is nice. Right?

[08:29] So they start a stream at seven o'clock at night and it goes all the way to 11 o'clock at night. You have a four hour window.

[08:35] You can have dinner with your family and your kids, get some work done, watch some sports and then tune in for an hour and get a sense of the game.

[08:41] Right? I know that people sometimes complain when they set up a stream and the players aren't good.

[08:47] Well, sorry. What do you want them to do? Right? There's only some that they can like do to give you like a great example of the game being played.

[08:55] Alright, so personally, I like streams. I get excited by watching a stream. I don't think that's just me. And here's why I get excited.

[09:05] I like it because all the kukus and the neckcases that we know on Pinside and all of our pinball friends that are also tuning in.

[09:12] I love that it's the only time in which we're all chatting in real time with each other and usually everyone's name is what their Pinside handle is and it's kind of fun to do that and to write back and forth with each other.

[09:24] It's also nice to have in real time a connection to the people who made the game. So on some of these streams, it's awesome because you're typing questions and there you have the answers from the people who are making the game.

[09:35] That is awesome. It's almost like within an hour stream where people are connected to the design team.

[09:42] You are getting more valuable information there than you would reading Pinside for a month as all these people are arguing back and forth.

[09:50] And you have to weed through all the garbage to get to the real information. Now there's also going to be some garbage and trash talking on the chats.

[09:57] I will say this. I think that people are a little too overly sensitive in the chat area. Whatever. It's the internet on Twitch.

[10:04] People are going to say irreverent stuff and we're all somewhat jackasses who have nothing better to do than watch a pinball stream.

[10:11] If you have nothing better to do than watch a pinball game being streamed, then you should be allowed to be a little bit like of a jackass.

[10:18] I'm sorry. Sometimes I see like, oh, you're not allowed to ask them just to start flipping the game. You need to listen to the coder talk about the game for 10 minutes.

[10:27] Now I don't want to tune in and listen to the director talk about the movie for 10 minutes. I just want to watch the movie and talk about, you know, let's have a fireside chat while the movie is being played.

[10:37] Alright, so what else do I want to talk about? So look, at the end of the day, at the end of the day streams are a good thing.

[10:43] These people, and I want to say this, these people like Jack Danger and like Greg and Zach and Brodo even talk pinball, buffalo, you know, our friends over at Buffalo, all the people that do pinball streams, all the people that strap on go pro cameras.

[11:00] There is so much work, there's so much energy, there's so much effort to make it happen. I mean, Jack's traveling around the country to do this stuff for you guys, I think what they do is an incredible thing for the hobby.

[11:12] Now, if you're someone who wants to be surprised and just don't tune in, nobody makes anybody watch a pinball stream.

[11:19] So I just think the thing is this, if you're a manufacturer and you let someone stream your game before it's done, I think that's a stupid move.

[11:28] I think it's absolutely stupid. I think it's stupid to bring pinball machines to shows when it's not even done. I think it was stupid for Charlie to bring Alice Cooper so early. I think it was stupid for Stern to show Batman before anything was done.

[11:40] I think it's absolutely a name to show your product when it's only half done. I think it was stupid that Willie Wonka was shown with only 40% code. It makes absolutely no sense.

[11:50] Now you have all these people wondering, well, is it really going to give me the integration I want? Well, that's great. So what? You have the shots done, you have the art done, you have everything done, but the most important thing is the game's not finished. It's just not finished.

[12:03] You do not see movie studios allowing media to see the movie before it's finished. You don't see video games. See video games are a little different. They let media in, but they don't get to finally give their review until the game is done. They're unbargoed.

[12:19] You don't see car companies loaning out a car to journalists when the car is not finished. You just don't see it. And if they do do it early, they sure as hell don't do it on the internet. They sure as hell don't bring it to shows where consumers are.

[12:34] And they sure as hell embargo media to the point where they can't talk about it until it's final. So I think there's a little bit of an awakening and a little bit of sort of, I don't know, people have to be more professional.

[12:47] They don't want bad first impressions. Right. So let's see, let's go on now to Willie Wonka debate. So the Willie Wonka debate is going on in the thread because I talked about the CEO delay until the fall and what that means. Now I want to just ask all of you a simple question.

[13:03] If you're a fan of Jersey Jack Pimbal and you want them to be successful for this company to be successful, they need to sell these 500 collectors additions. They are going to make the most money. Jack will make more money and profit if he sells 500 CE's right away.

[13:22] They's going to make more on that profit margin than each individual's Ellie and definitely the SE. So that's the thing is if you want them to succeed, don't you want them to do the smart marketing thing.

[13:33] Now when do you think is the best time to release 500 collectors additions? Is it at the beginning of production or six to eight months after production begins?

[13:44] So you have to ask yourself why is Stern able to sell five or sorry 600 monsters in two days in two days. They just showed the monsters and within two days 600 of them are spoken for and sold.

[13:58] And yet Jack is not even close to selling 500 collectors additions of Willy Wonka, which I've played both. It's a far superior machine. Maybe you think it's the price point. That's the issue. I'm not necessarily sure it's that.

[14:11] Now I really do. I think it comes down to two things. I think two things are the reason why collectors additions of Wonka are still easily available and monsters sells out in two days. I think the first thing is the weight.

[14:25] There's no there's no way around this. People knew when they bought monsters Ellie, they would have the game in their home within like a few weeks. Okay. Now maybe took a little bit longer within a month and not just that.

[14:37] It's not just that Stern can make 600 monsters Ellie is quickly right 50 something a day they can make maybe more of a pen. So quickly. So you're not going to you're not going to watch one guy on boxes monsters Ellie and you have to wait like four months to get yours.

[14:52] So they go quickly. All right. There also was like you know they also knew that you were going to get them you know early on. So if I ordered one. I was going to get my Ellie right after they started making pros. There wasn't going to be like a six month. All right. Here's the biggest thing though. And I think this is the part about selling games that a lot of people don't get. This is what deep roots can you encounter to everyone. This is like Stern's secret weapon. The number of distributors. All right.

[15:19] Because the distributors in pinball what they really are there are sales force for the companies. So when the distributors are calling up their customers. They are the ones who are delivering that fear of missing out mentality with their customers. So for example.

[15:37] When monsters Ellie is revealed by Stern. There are so many more distributors calling up their customers saying hey Stern just announced today. Monsters Ellie. I'm only getting a handful. They're going really fast. Do you want one. You're going to have to let me know today because they could be spoken for tomorrow. You know what that does to these collectors to these men when they feel that way. They say I'll take one and they just feel a sense of satisfaction that they were able to get one. Okay. Now do you think that's happening with Willy Wonka?

[16:07] They tried to some of the Jack some of Jack's distributors tried to tell people that hey you're going to want to get one because I might not be able to get you one in like a like a few days. And then what happened.

[16:19] We started to see collectors additions easily for sale everywhere. It was clear that all 500 did not get spoken for. And now that people know how long it's going to take to get it. What's happening now. There's absolutely no urgency.

[16:33] There's also when you think about the number of distributors that distribute Jersey Jack games versus Stern games. It's laughable. I bet Stern has 10 times the distribution base. So that's 10 times the amount of sales people that are calling up customers.

[16:49] You know saying hey I'm only going to get allocated this many do you want one I need to know today. You know it's you can't compete with that. And that's that's a reality that Jack has to deal with.

[17:00] It's also a reality that deep roots going to have to deal with Stern's distribution channel and the number of distributors they have around the world. Not just the US. The world has a sales force that is creating that urgency.

[17:15] And that is why Stern games sell out so quickly. And that is why collectors additions are still sitting there. And will most likely still be available come August September even after they show it right.

[17:27] Even after they show the collectors addition it will still be available. So I'm here to tell you that pirates of the Caribbean.

[17:33] LEs and CEs I think are now officially sold out so finally I called automated services and asked them about their pirates CEs that they had listed on their website that were still available. And they said they sold the last one this week.

[17:48] So I think that means that pirates of the Caribbean limited edition and collectors additions which they made 200 of are now officially sold out now think about how long it took them to sell 200 of these pirates collectors additions.

[18:03] I mean the game has been out for a while. And so if you know of any other collectors additions pirates of the Caribbean or LEs that are still for sale.

[18:13] If you're a distributor and you have a few can you please email me at canada pinball at gmail.com because I'd like to clarify whether or not they're all spoken for.

[18:22] And I like to let any of my listeners know who might still want one where they can get one. So please please email me because I know it's always hard.

[18:31] There's all these distributors and it's hard reading pins. I know who still has what and I don't want people to call around.

[18:36] So and here's the thing too now that you know they're sold out be honest with me how many of you are now like crap I should have grabbed one right something simple about creating scarcity that leads a lot of the collectors out there to wish they would have moved on it.

[18:51] And hey maybe you could have just bought a pirate to the Caribbean C and kept it in box and and see where the market goes on it.

[18:58] But you know what I want to congratulate Jack on selling everyone it probably will go down as the rarest JJP game.

[19:05] But I keep hearing they're going to make more down the road they probably will I if I was a betting man that's what I would say alright so there's lots of fighting on the walk of thread.

[19:14] I saw recently and the for some reason pinside people can't just stay on topic like this is a topic about are you buying willy wonka what happens is this Saturday night happens and these guys are drinking.

[19:27] They probably haven't had intimacy with their wives in a really long time and they've got nothing better to do than pound the whiskey and start internally fighting with each other over pinball it's a rich way to spend a Saturday night really is I mean there's no better place to be than on pinside right.

[19:42] And so there's a lot of arguing going back and forth and it's senseless arguing people are arguing about the wood quality between the monsters and.

[19:53] Pire to the Caribbean you know I really want to go into a bar and walk up to a beautiful woman and say hey who do you think's got better wood quality on the cabinets pirate the Caribbean or monsters and just watch as she slowly falls backwards and plays dead okay this stuff people argue about it is so insane so but here's the thing I don't want to get into the specifics we've seen this argument left and right all day long about quality quality quality quality.

[20:22] And I think there's only one question for me yes there's quality of materials but when it comes to having a quality pinball experience there's really only one question that is the most important question that you can ask when you are talking about stern versus Jersey Jack right now and that question is simply this is your pinball machine working or not right maybe the second question is has your machine had a lot of issues or has it has a lot of.

[20:51] And I think that's a good question for you to ask is that you have a lot of issues or has it had very few issues because when I think about quality right when I think about quality if I were to think about it in car terms it's like how many days is my car in the shop and how many days am I driving my car that's a quality car right remember Jaguar is used to break down all the time Ford used to stand for fix or repair a daily right and I'm sorry but I have to say I love Jersey Jack and I love all they're trying to do.

[21:19] And look at the pirates of the Caribbean issues look at it and I was talking to Derek you know Derek are pirates the Caribbean fanboy he's telling me is like owning a pirate to the Caribbean it's a game in itself trying to keep it working properly just to change a simple rubber on a post he's got to remove the entire upper play field and he's become an expert in basically rebuilding this machine all the time because he has to keep lifting the glass and working on it I've owned Batman 66 for.

[21:49] Two years almost I've had to fix one thing on it one thing the game has worked flawlessly since I've owned it one node board went down I popped a new one in all's good nothing ever happens I play this game nothing ever happens maybe there was a stuck like target by the Joker it worked itself out it's been fine since no issues nothing to yank nothing to pull out nothing to have to I don't have to rebuild the game to me that's where quality is.

[22:19] It's most important you know you can you can over reach and put a ton into the game but if the machines are constantly breaking down I'm telling you no one wants that nobody wants it all right so let's talk about Alice Cooper nightmare castle so spooky is getting these games out the door pretty quickly they're in the number 70s now okay I think Chuck said he can make something like 12 a week or 15 a week the line is fully going on this game I'm pretty confident Chuck is going to make all 500 of these games by fall

[22:49] winter and by the year we're probably going to see Scott Denise's next game and but this is you know people are enjoying this game they're they're modding it they're having a good time with it they're enjoying the code I think that you know the weight was ridiculous I think Chuck will be the first one to tell you they probably shouldn't have done it and they're going to learn as they go and they're not going to show their next game until it's ready to hit the line.

[23:13] I forgot to mention that yellow brick road wases are getting the customers right so so knowing that that game was on the line when Jack showed it at tpf you can kind of do the math because they're not tooled up yet for wonkas so are we going to see wonka in 60 days getting the customers I bet within 60 days wonka will be tooled up but that doesn't mean it's going to go in a box again they showed it to early they just did all right so Batman 66 people are saying

[23:43] what more does Batman need in terms of code here's what I think Batman 66 needs it needs more of a light show you've got all these lights but there's no light show there never do the lights do anything that's like wow or interesting so I think they should work on that the crane integration get this big crane it barely comes out it hardly ever comes out they need to work it into the game more I want more like penguin call out I just never hear the penguin ever even when you're in the penguin modes I don't know why we don't hear him and you hear him a few times

[24:13] but I want more penguin the villain vision is this all we're going to get it's called villain vision and yet you never have the villains doing any shout outs or video clips where they're like taunting you I thought they would have you utilize that more I don't know why it's not really doing much

[24:31] some people have been calling for an ultimate wizard mode they feel that like once you go through the objectives of the game and you get to the three wizard modes there's not like a final final wizard mode

[24:42] I don't know how you would do that per se I mean yes it would be great to have it there's no way you can make it where you'd have to do all the minor villains like all of them in every season

[24:52] and the major villains it be too much if you it's way too hard for those of you have played Batman I don't think even the best pinball players could get through every minor villain and major villain and through all the wizard modes no no no I think what they could do they could possibly do is if you I don't know maybe you could do like two

[25:11] if you do two of the wizard modes and you do villain escape that unlock I don't know I don't have a liminal figured out if anyone knows how to get the right balance he'll do it and then the last thing I just want to ask for selfishly is for the mod couple and yellow bird to do something with the cat woman ramps

[25:28] can we get a nicer cat woman that's plastic so it's not the flat cats on top can we get a 3D sculpting one all right so let's talk about Beatles real quick so Beatles I think it's safe to say did not do as well as

[25:41] if you look at the price of Beatles are going now there's still a lot of these machines new inbox sitting at distributors whether it's gold whether it's platinum whether it's diamond the games are not moving

[25:56] there there is a lack of interest at the current price point for Beatles I still think the game looks great I think the game is fun I think it's a nice breaks up the monotony of the traditional stern offering

[26:12] but it's too expensive and I think the older demographic that is into the Beatles isn't as into pinball as much and not just that if they are into pinball they're too wise to know that this game is not worth that kind of money

[26:27] it's still a great game but I do think they basically they didn't give you enough there wasn't enough differentiation between the packages and I think for a lot of people out there and this is how I felt

[26:38] I just thought it was so obnoxious to charge what they charged for the platinum and diamond additions considering the fact that there was nothing different in the game there wasn't another mode they didn't do any work they basically just put a cheap plaque on the game and tried and limited it in some arbitrary artwork way

[26:57] and then saw people paying $25,000 for a diamond addition I know some people that paid that and let me just tell you if you paid $25,000 for a diamond addition God help you I hope you I hope you never sell it I hope you never try and sell it

[27:13] because I'd be really sad when you go to try and sell a $25,000 Beatles diamond addition and you get offered like 12 grand for it you you could have bought two you know as opposed to like if someone bought I saw someone just bought a King Kong did you see that a King Kong has changed hands

[27:33] I think Troy Smith posted it on Facebook that he found one I don't know if it was for him or for one of his his buyers it's so cool when it was a hepp restored King Kong how much you think that went for a hepp restored King Kong I'm going to guess and I think I'm probably accurate which is crazy I think a hepp restored King Kong sells for like $65,000 easily easily I mean I heard people turned down offers of $50,000 for a non hepp restored one

[28:02] would I pay $65,000 for a King Kong you know what the kind of guy who buys it it means more to him than $65,000 I have friends in this hobby that $65,000 means absolutely nothing to but $65,000 just won't get you a King Kong because the only way you can get a King Kong is if someone's willing to let go of one of the eight in the world

[28:26] and that makes it almost priceless right but clearly there is a price for everything but congratulations to the new owner congratulations to the seller I'll tell you guys a crazy story like a friend of mine had a chance to pick up a King Kong back when like you know no one really was collecting as much as they are today for like $6,000 he's like nah I don't want it he's kicking himself today all right what else is going on

[28:50] so the first black night limited editions are now shipping I saw one inbox congratulations Stern you once again continue to show everybody how it's done the LEDs of black night are shipping take notice Jersey Jackie gotta do it closer to reveal now I don't think they're going to sell all 600 but you know why those games are going to be available for a while like look at Deadpool

[29:10] Deadpool's a great game I jumped on Deadpool this past Thursday Deadpool Ellie is like a really really fun game the game has come a long way game looks great game shoots a lot of fun get the call outs are great I can kind of see now why I did win best call out but the game is fun you know I think but here's a thing Deadpool Ellie's still sitting right zombie Eddie our package looks incredible still sitting at MSRP

[29:40] and they didn't sell all of them it's crazy that they didn't sell all Deadpool's and you know considering that is a really you know fun theme I do think Deadpool as a theme no doesn't really hit the target demo there's a reason why like these guys are older the guys you collect him all they're just a little bit older they're not into the Deadpool comics if they're into the Deadpool movie they might be disappointed because it's not in the game but

[30:00] but look it's a great game if you want a really good stern game that's solid you could probably get a few hundred bucks off a Deadpool Ellie because these distributors are just sitting on them all right what else is going on I also played a monster bash remake Ellie now I played these games that atoms apartment in New York City he's got this amazing pinball loft Adam thank you again for having me over there and I want to give a shout out to his son Tucker awesome kid lucky lucky man I wish my dad had like a lot like that with all those pinball machines my dad just handed me like a

[30:30] stack of car magazines it was like here you go but here's a deal I learned a lot Thursday night I'm going to explain a little bit more but monster bash Ellie God the game is gorgeous I have I never stood over in Ellie in a home environment that was just like wow I mean it really is is worth the weight so I know that some of you out there are still waiting for your monster bash Ellie's let me tell you something it's going to be worth the weight you're never going to want to sell this game it's it's just kind of

[31:00] it's hard to look at monster bash Ellie and then look at monsters and be like they are the same price it it's it's not even close I mean it that game is kind of perfect it really is

[31:14] and for those of you complaining about it's too easy and this that this or that so what was interesting and atoms places the New York City tournament guys all came over and set up

[31:24] the legs in the back to be at the highest point to make the games more difficult because they're all going to be training there for the New York City pinball championships

[31:32] and I'll tell you that when you do that any easy game becomes a lot harder when you when you have the legs jacked up all the way

[31:39] all right the other thing that I learned was this and then I'm going to call today guys

[31:44] Adam has some older games and I normally don't talk about EMS or solid states but I'll tell you this when you I've no really play the old games

[31:53] and and you know this podcast is always about the new stuff but I'll say this he has a mint star gays or evil can evil I think it was a gorgar

[32:04] and I'll say I'll say that I was so surprised how much fun it was when you're playing some of those solid state games and you are just playing pinball

[32:16] in some of it's like pure as form and there's no LCD there's nothing to look up at when you explain what to do in the game to people it's all there on the play field

[32:28] and you know me I'm such like a modern sort of contemporary new in box kind of podcaster but I have to say we had more fun just playing the old stuff

[32:39] sort of getting back to the basics of pinball and I think in a group setting in a social setting those old machines are far more appealing because they're far less intimidating in terms of just knowing what to do

[32:53] and so within a few seconds 30 seconds to a couple minutes you know exactly how to play the game and then you're playing the game and the sounds are really awesome you know the artwork on these games too I mean I have to say like you look over like a star gays and you're like wow

[33:08] like the artist is so cool it's it has this like retro vibe to the games too and the sounds are so retro and I can tell why people love TNA because I feel like it's a modern version of why people love the games from the solid state error

[33:24] and it's just really really simple and fun and you you're right into it so I think it was a little bit of like a canada awakening where I sort of started to really really enjoy games from another error

[33:37] that don't cost a fortune of course Adams games are like professionally restored I mean they're they're like better than new but you get this appreciation the other thing I really love about these games and when you're playing in a social setting is even if you're good or bad

[33:54] I feel like the games are hard like they're kind of brutal in a way that kind of evens out the playing field and the reason why the playing field is really even doubt in these games

[34:06] is that there's not an advantage because you've memorized the most ridiculously complex rule sets of the game there's nothing to memorize other than I have to hit these targets I then you know shoot that spinner

[34:21] and that's when you get big points like he you know Adam would be like just just just kind of keep railing on that spinner and it's like my god I just fell in love with the simplicity of it all

[34:32] the other thing is this and I'm just going to say this the other thing you feel when you play the games you feel more like it has like this analog feel to it and it just feels much more like mechanical

[34:44] like I don't know it's just about like steel on like it's steel in a way and then you jump on the new games and they feel plasticky they just feel a little bit cheaper

[34:54] just doesn't feel like as substantial and so I'm not going to keep on going on about this but I'm going to say I'm now a fan of some of the older stuff

[35:04] I definitely think a collection should have a little bit of both and so that's all I'm going to say is that this newbie to the hobby

[35:14] sort of understands a little bit more now what pinball is all about and I think for those of you out there broaden your horizons a little bit on pinball

[35:24] and you might be surprised the kinds of games you'll really enjoy and you'll start to appreciate pinball in a way which you wouldn't you wouldn't necessarily think you could

[35:35] I didn't think I would ever really have that much fun playing those older games but I did maybe I get slammed now for being a hypocrite

[35:43] because I don't talk about them because you know you know how people get whenever can either gets excited about something people don't like it they just want me to be angry but I'm not I'm happy I love pinball I love my life happy mothers day everybody I got my mom a beautiful gift we had a nice dinner last night she is the love of my life next to Brenda my mother is the reason why this podcast exists she's an incredible Sicilian woman who taught me to always speak your mind and never hold back and don't let others tell you you can't say what you want

[36:12] to say so thank you mother for raising me and raising your son to be the world's number one pinball podcast have a great day everybody

[36:42] you
