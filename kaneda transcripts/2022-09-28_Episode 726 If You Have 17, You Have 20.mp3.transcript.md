[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast, another Pinball Podcast in the universe.

[00:28] So let me get this straight, if you have $17,000 to buy this James Bond 60th anniversary game,

[00:37] and then you say I'm not going to buy it at 20, are you reading this thread?

[00:41] This is going to happen any day now.

[00:43] I think we're going to see this James Bond 60th on like September 30th.

[00:48] And the rumor is, this is the rumor, that Stern is going to not be the bad guy.

[00:52] They're not going to set a price for this game.

[00:55] They're going to give this game to distributors and allow them to set the price.

[01:01] And in the thread itself, you have people who are basically trying to debate and speculate

[01:06] how much money they would spend on a single level Keith Elwyn James Bond game that is based

[01:14] on 25 James Bond movies.

[01:18] Okay, we're going to talk about that.

[01:19] We're also going to talk about the eight minutes of footage that we saw over the shoulder

[01:25] of James Bond gameplay.

[01:26] Like once again, the launch of this machine is the biggest head scratcher in the history

[01:32] of Stern launches.

[01:33] But let's talk about the 60th anniversary game and whether or not a game in which there

[01:38] will be only, I mean, you could argue only 500 is not only because if it's 20 grand

[01:45] and you say there's only 500, isn't that like $10 million Stern pinball will make on a 500

[01:54] run machine from Keith Elwyn.

[01:56] But that's a lot of money.

[01:58] I really hope Keith Elwyn is going to get a cut on each game sold because this is like

[02:04] not even part of his normal programming.

[02:07] He's working on another fully featured game.

[02:10] But everybody is really starting to debate like, does this make sense?

[02:14] Does it make sense from a marketing standpoint?

[02:17] Does this overshadow the Ellie version of the game?

[02:21] I mean, it's more rare.

[02:22] It's more special in the sense that it's Keith Elwyn and there's only 500, but it's

[02:28] not going to be a better game.

[02:29] Like I just want everyone to just like understand my feelings on this.

[02:32] I don't think it's going to be a better game.

[02:35] I don't think it's going to be more enjoyable.

[02:37] I don't think it's going to be more engaging.

[02:39] And if they're taking 25 James Bond movies and putting it into a single level game, I

[02:45] think you're just going to see like fun quirky modes inspired by all those movies, but you're

[02:50] not going to see clips.

[02:52] You're not going to see a ton of call out.

[02:53] You know, you're not going to see like Roger Moore, like Sean Connery, Daniel Craig, like

[02:58] all of these movies in one blender of a game.

[03:02] How much of it is actually going to come through in the game itself?

[03:05] I think all of these questions are going to be answered really soon.

[03:08] I also think this is a moment for the community to basically show us, are we going to pay

[03:15] a lot for something simply because it's rare?

[03:19] Now history has shown us we will.

[03:22] And they know this community better than we think we know ourselves.

[03:26] Stern Pinball has been testing the waters on moves like these for a very long time.

[03:32] They did it with like the Beatles Diamond Edition.

[03:36] They did it with Batman SLE.

[03:38] They did it with Elvira 40th.

[03:40] But here's where I think Stern might be getting into a little bit of a problem.

[03:45] Here's the problem I see coming if they make this move.

[03:48] And this later move is not guaranteed.

[03:51] There's a lot of people speculating that George Gomez has insinuated that there might be a

[03:57] gold finger sort of like SLE version of the game he's making.

[04:02] Now let's look at this for a minute.

[04:03] Let's unpack this.

[04:04] If Stern sells a thousand L.E.s at $13,000 a pop and these things are about almost 15

[04:12] K with tax and shipping, you're telling me that a thousand people are all of a sudden

[04:18] going to spend that much money on a Stern and six months or a year from now, they're

[04:24] going to feel like their game is second fiddle.

[04:27] And I just can't see Stern doing this.

[04:29] I can't see them making the gold finger edition.

[04:32] They have to be very careful here.

[04:34] I think there is a tipping point in which there's only so many versions of the game

[04:39] you can make before every version of the game doesn't feel special.

[04:43] For those of you new to the hobby, you probably are forgetting what Jersey Jack used to do

[04:49] with their special versions of the game.

[04:51] We had Emerald City Wizard of Oz and then he made the Ruby Red edition and then he made

[04:56] the Yellow Brick Road edition.

[04:58] And when you keep making new additions to the lineup and making the newer editions scarcer,

[05:04] more expensive and more rare, you basically are undercutting the value and the specialness

[05:11] of the limited edition.

[05:13] I think on day one and I mean this, I think on day one, a game should come out with all

[05:18] trims available.

[05:20] Have your SLE, have your LE, have your premium or your pro.

[05:24] I don't like this sort of revisiting a game like a year or two later and then coming out

[05:30] with an anniversary edition because think about it like this.

[05:33] Imagine if you bought Elvira, the Couch edition.

[05:36] What was it?

[05:37] The signature edition.

[05:38] They made 50 of those and then they made 199 of the 40th.

[05:43] Now I would argue that the SLE is really the signature edition, the one with the red armor.

[05:49] But the purple one is much nicer.

[05:51] Like they added new elements to the purple one.

[05:53] It just looks like a nicer overall package and it just feels newer and more special.

[05:58] And so it's like this weird thing.

[06:00] Now you've got like two super limited versions of a game competing with each other for which

[06:06] one is worth more money.

[06:07] You know, what's to stop Stern in five years from doing an Elvira 45th anniversary edition.

[06:13] There is nothing in writing by them that this is it.

[06:16] And I think this is on us as buyers and as collectors.

[06:20] Will Stern be greedy and make too many limited versions of each game?

[06:25] I want to know what you guys think.

[06:26] Email me at canadapinball at gmail.com.

[06:28] I just don't think Goldfinger's special limited edition makes much sense.

[06:32] I really don't.

[06:34] Because if these are the new prices and Stern needs people to keep coming back and spending

[06:39] $13,000 on every LE moving forward, how are they going to accomplish that if those buyers

[06:46] are afraid that there is going to be a version of the game that's going to trump the version

[06:51] they just bought?

[06:52] I think when you buy an LE, I think you should be able to rest at night knowing that you

[06:57] got one of the rarest versions of the game and they're not going to trump it down the

[07:01] road.

[07:02] Because here's what I think is going to happen.

[07:04] I think we're going to see anniversary editions of Jurassic Park.

[07:08] I think we might see a Tron Vault.

[07:10] I think we're going to see Stern go back to the well.

[07:13] And then all of a sudden for you collectors out there, you're in this sort of like dilemma.

[07:18] Like I've already had a lot of people come up to me and say, hey, Chris, like how accurate

[07:22] is Tron Vault edition?

[07:24] Because I might want to sell mine now.

[07:27] You also get people that say I'm about to buy one, Chris.

[07:29] I always feel bad for those guys.

[07:31] They're like, I'm about to buy this machine, Chris, for all of this money.

[07:35] And are you sure it's coming?

[07:37] And I'm honest with them.

[07:38] I'm like, I haven't seen it.

[07:39] I don't know for sure it's coming.

[07:41] So don't make your decision based upon what I'm saying is a rumor.

[07:45] But if I were you and I tell them this, if I were you, I would just wait a year.

[07:50] Because in a year, and I mean is Tron LE, regular Tron, it doesn't matter.

[07:54] There are so many new games coming out that I don't see Tron LE like spiking in value.

[08:00] I don't see DMD error games spiking in value with all of the new stuff coming out.

[08:06] There are only so many high end collectors that are willing to buy these things for $15,

[08:11] $18, $20,000.

[08:13] And I always believe this.

[08:15] I think patience is the greatest virtue in pinball.

[08:18] And I think a lot of us right now are starting to realize that.

[08:22] And we don't mind being patient.

[08:23] Like if you're patient, you'll be able to get almost any game that comes out ever.

[08:28] There are only so few games that if you miss the initial release of it, you're never going

[08:33] to get your hands on it.

[08:34] I don't think I've seen any game that has never gone up for sale again.

[08:39] And the only games that take a while to hit the market are games that are super expensive,

[08:44] super rare.

[08:45] You know, games like a Batman SLE, games like a pirate to the Caribbean Collector's Edition.

[08:50] But they will pop up.

[08:51] And for you high end collectors out there, you've shown us over the years that money

[08:56] is no object.

[08:57] Here's the thing with this single level bond game.

[08:59] I just want to put a little bit of a bow on it.

[09:01] I don't think any single level game should ever be worth $20,000.

[09:06] I don't care who's designing it.

[09:08] I don't care what the artwork is.

[09:09] I don't care how many movies it's based on.

[09:11] There is no such thing in my mind as a single level game.

[09:16] No ramps, no complex coding.

[09:18] It doesn't even have like real scoring reels.

[09:21] I mean, maybe that's just placeholder.

[09:23] But I just don't see anywhere near a game that I would throw $20,000 at.

[09:29] And I think what people are throwing money at isn't this machine itself.

[09:33] I think they're throwing money at their emotional connection to James Bond.

[09:38] James Bond has a lot of fans.

[09:40] Like a lot of fans.

[09:41] I was really blown away by the amount of interest in the James Bond LE raffle I did.

[09:47] There are so many more James Bond fanatics who collect pinball machines than Godzilla

[09:53] fanatics.

[09:54] And let's be honest, Godzilla is a great game.

[09:58] It's probably one of Stern's best.

[10:00] But most of you grown men out there, you haven't really thought about or engaged in the Godzilla

[10:05] license nearly as much as James Bond.

[10:08] And I think that's who this game is for.

[10:11] And I think Stern is basically making games for very, very wealthy people where money

[10:17] is no object.

[10:18] You know, this James Bond game, if it's $25,000, you know, it might be 50% of someone's annual

[10:25] income.

[10:26] It might be 10% of someone's annual income.

[10:29] But the market for a game like this, a $15,000 to $20,000 pinball machine, the market for

[10:35] this game is someone who this is like 1% to 5% of their annual income, maybe even less.

[10:43] They are really trying to hook the big fish with a game like this.

[10:48] And I know who the big fish are and I bet you they will buy this game.

[10:51] But here's the thing, I don't think there's 500 of them.

[10:54] I really don't think there's 500 of them.

[10:56] And if Stern overprices this game, I think you're going to see them sit with distributors.

[11:01] And here's the real danger.

[11:03] If you run and buy this game on day one for 20 or 25, I think you're going to lose like

[11:09] $5,000 to $8,000.

[11:12] Go ask the people who spent 24, 25 on Elvira, a game you can now get for like $17,000, $18,000.

[11:19] I'm talking about the 40th anniversary edition.

[11:22] Those gentlemen who did that, you don't become rich because you play loose with your money.

[11:28] And nobody wants to buy a game for $25,000 and then wake up six months later and they

[11:34] could have saved themselves $8,000.

[11:36] No matter how rich you are, you don't want to buy something at the highest price.

[11:41] People get rich in life because they buy low and sell high, not the other way around.

[11:46] So let's talk about the gameplay.

[11:48] There's not that much of it.

[11:50] There was a video that was recorded.

[11:52] And here's the thing, I'm just confused like where this even came from.

[11:56] Where is this James Bond premium machine that is being played somewhere over in the UK?

[12:02] Why doesn't Stern have this machine on lockdown?

[12:06] Where is this machine?

[12:07] It should have the back box folded down.

[12:10] It sounds like there's a party going on in the background and people are just like flipping

[12:14] away on the machine.

[12:15] Like Stern, I can't believe like what is going on with this machine.

[12:19] And yes, when I said Stern should fire their marketing department, I was joking.

[12:24] I don't really mean they should fire these people, but they definitely should be called

[12:28] into a room and figure out what is going on here.

[12:31] Like how did this even happen?

[12:33] And then the footage became private and now it's public again because I've been uploading

[12:37] it and other people have the footage.

[12:39] Here's what was interesting looking at the gameplay.

[12:41] I still think we didn't hear much like the sound in that video was terrible.

[12:46] And I think this game is really going to require like really good code because I think the shots

[12:52] are interesting.

[12:53] You know, the missile is the weirdest thing and everyone keeps pointing it out, but that

[12:57] missile just shaking back and forth.

[12:59] It really is pretty damn underwhelming.

[13:02] And here's the other part about the missile.

[13:03] I don't get.

[13:04] As you watch this footage, you see the missile on the screen and on the screen itself, you

[13:10] see the missile like the top of it opens up.

[13:13] Like that's what happens in the movie itself.

[13:15] Okay.

[13:16] So you're telling me Stern Pimble for $9,700 for a premium and $13,000 for an LE.

[13:23] They couldn't design the missile to actually open up like it does in the movie.

[13:28] And everyone's saying it.

[13:29] It just looks like this big silver sex toy that is vibrating back and forth.

[13:35] It's just there, but it doesn't really do much.

[13:38] I also would have loved for them to have engineered the missile.

[13:41] I mean, think about it like this for a minute.

[13:43] Stern can engineer a building in Godzilla that goes up and down, right?

[13:47] A building that collapses, that goes up and down, right?

[13:50] But they couldn't engineer a missile that went up and down, that maybe comes up from

[13:54] underneath the play field and then takes off.

[13:57] You know what I'm saying?

[13:58] It's just there.

[13:59] There's jetpack in motion and that's been somewhat underwhelming and there's nothing

[14:03] really else.

[14:04] I mean it.

[14:05] And you know, the thing that people are highlighting the most is being awesome and this game is

[14:09] going to be awesome.

[14:10] You know what it is?

[14:11] You know what the number one thing is?

[14:12] People are saying this game is going to be great because of this for $13,000.

[14:16] It's the ramps.

[14:17] Like all of a sudden now Stern has this right where they want us.

[14:21] We are now super excited because ramps in a game provide fast Pimble action back to the

[14:28] flippers and we'll say this, the ramps are really cool.

[14:31] I absolutely love watching those ramps be shot.

[14:34] But as I look at this game, I am sort of waiting to see where the magic is.

[14:39] Where does the magic lie?

[14:41] Because it doesn't feel like the mechs are providing that magic.

[14:44] Is it going to be in the code?

[14:46] Now what do we know about the code?

[14:47] Not too much, but I'll say this.

[14:48] You can tell by the footage that in this game it's going to have like scenes from the movie.

[14:54] Are we going to get the actors and their voices in each scene?

[14:57] I think we are.

[14:58] You can see that one scene where they're at the casino and the woman's talking to the

[15:02] man.

[15:03] I think you can hear them talking to each other.

[15:05] And I think it's going to be like Batman 66 where like they're going to sequence out

[15:09] the scene.

[15:10] So every time you hit a few shots, you progress further through that scene.

[15:15] That's how I like it done.

[15:16] It's not just going to be looping with muted clips because that's what people want.

[15:20] But then I get a little nervous, right?

[15:22] Because I'm like, wait a minute.

[15:23] So if they're going to do this and they're going to sync up movie clips with these movies,

[15:27] that's a lot of work.

[15:29] We know how much work Lyman Sheets put into Batman 66 to take those like three seasons

[15:35] of shows and chop it all up into pinball form.

[15:38] We have six or seven movies to work with on this game.

[15:42] I would argue that the total duration of content that Lyman Sheets worked with on those Batman

[15:47] seasons was probably more hours than footage that's in these James Bond movies.

[15:52] And I think what's interesting about Bond is you could probably watch each movie and

[15:57] extract like four pivotal scenes or moments from the movie.

[16:01] And that's how they're doing it.

[16:02] So then maybe you have like 24 different things to do or objectives in the pinball machine.

[16:08] So we're going to see, we're going to see real soon.

[16:11] You know, and that's where we're at.

[16:12] And I'm talking to dealers and distributors and they're sending people invoices and people

[16:16] don't know they really don't know what they're getting yet.

[16:20] And we don't know like how far along the code is.

[16:23] What I'm hearing is this though.

[16:24] I'm hearing Venom is done.

[16:26] I'm hearing Venom is done and it's ready to go because you got to remember that Venom

[16:30] was being developed to be released in April of this year and it was ready to go and then

[16:36] Stern had a hit pause because they had to fill the backlog.

[16:39] Venom is like done.

[16:41] It can go on the line at any minute.

[16:43] And so it feels like James Bond had to come out to coincide with the anniversary.

[16:48] But now the question becomes this, when do they release Venom?

[16:52] So if we're hearing that James Bond is not really going to go into production until like

[16:56] November, then I don't think we see another Stern pinball machine in December.

[17:00] I don't think we see it in January.

[17:03] I think we're going to see their next reveal sometime in February, March.

[17:07] So we got another four months to go.

[17:08] And so then if we look at this pinball year, and I've been saying this to some people offline,

[17:12] I'll say it online right now.

[17:14] I think 2022 was a really sort of mediocre year in pinball.

[17:20] I don't think there's one game that's like won everybody over.

[17:23] There hasn't yet been a game that's like the runaway game of the year.

[17:27] And if you look at the launches in this year and you look at the games that took over pinball

[17:31] culture in 2022, I don't know how you don't look at it any other way than being somewhat

[17:36] of a disappointment.

[17:37] You had legends of a Hala.

[17:38] You had Halloween.

[17:40] You had Ultraman.

[17:41] You had Toy Story 4.

[17:43] We're finally getting James Bond.

[17:45] Weird Owls have barely shipped.

[17:47] I think like five weird owls have shipped.

[17:50] Maybe 30 fathoms have shipped.

[17:52] And what else has really happened in pinball?

[17:55] So in a year in which a lot of us were getting ready to buy again and get excited again,

[18:01] I really think it's been somewhat of a little bit of a let down year.

[18:05] And if you were to ask me, I think James Bond is probably going to run away with like Game

[18:09] of the Year and Theme of the Year and Mechs of the Year and this and that.

[18:14] But then it's going to get interesting because James Bond can't win Art of the Year.

[18:17] Like how does that win Best Art in Pinball of the Year?

[18:20] Is it going to go to Toy Story?

[18:21] But those were really just generic Toy Story assets moved around.

[18:25] I'm going to call it like I think the Dark Horse.

[18:27] I think Franchi's going to win Best Art of the Year with whatever he does on the new

[18:32] American Pinball game because there's nothing right now.

[18:35] Think about it.

[18:36] What game that came out this year is going to win Best Art Package?

[18:40] Hands down the sexiest game we've seen from an art package.

[18:43] I think Franchi takes it.

[18:44] I think he takes it because also remember, I don't think Halloween or Ultraman are even

[18:48] eligible.

[18:49] They were last year's Twippies.

[18:51] Remember when they came out people because it takes spooky like 18 months to get onto

[18:55] the next game.

[18:56] That actually would be fun.

[18:57] You know, it would be really fun if Franchi wins the Twippy for Best Artist and he sort

[19:02] of snakes everybody on an American Pinball game.

[19:04] I predict that's going to happen.

[19:06] And I'm just going to say it.

[19:07] The window is still open for American Pinball to get this new game out.

[19:11] I think what's going to be interesting at Expo in three weeks or four weeks, I think

[19:16] it's going to be interesting because I think American Pinball can steal the show.

[19:20] I really do.

[19:21] Is James Bond even going to be at Expo October?

[19:25] Like what is it?

[19:26] Like the 19th through the 23rd?

[19:28] Is it even going to be there?

[19:29] Like is it on the line?

[19:30] Is Stern sending the game out or is Stern holding the game back until the code gets further

[19:35] along?

[19:36] If that's the case, I really do think American Pinball with this show.

[19:41] And it's backyard.

[19:42] And this is like David Fix's show.

[19:44] I think American Pinball could march into Expo with this new game and really steal the

[19:51] show.

[19:52] Now look, you all know and we all know you don't need a show to get sales and pinball

[19:55] anymore.

[19:56] You just need something that's like close to production that excites people.

[20:01] And look, it's going to be a tough hill to climb with an original IP game.

[20:05] But I keep hearing from people who saw this game that it is absolutely a stunner and a

[20:11] knockout.

[20:12] I haven't even talked about like Pulp Fiction is supposed to come out this year too.

[20:15] Man, it's getting kind of crazy.

[20:17] I don't know about the rest of you, but it's kind of crazy to see all of these different

[20:20] pinball machines sort of jockeying for our dollars.

[20:23] And yet doesn't it feel like we haven't really played anything that's blown us away this

[20:27] year?

[20:28] We haven't really played anything that's excited us the way Godzilla did.

[20:31] There hasn't been anything new that's just been the universally loved pinball machine.

[20:37] Will it be James Bond?

[20:38] Obviously, it's going to come down to the code and the way the game shoots.

[20:41] But I also think James Bond, 1960s James Bond isn't really the most universal theme that

[20:48] everybody loves and the younger pinball people are not really that into it.

[20:52] But we shall see people.

[20:53] It's crazy that it's almost October and we don't have a runaway game of the year in

[20:59] pinball.

[21:00] Everybody will be back with more shows.

[21:01] I fully expect to be back this week when the Elwynn pin gets shown.

[21:06] More to come on that.

[21:07] And you heard it here first, right?

[21:09] Nobody else believed Canada when I said it was going to be a fourth game made by Elwynn.

[21:13] It came true.

[21:14] Thank you everybody for the support and thank you for tuning in to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[21:18] We're out.
