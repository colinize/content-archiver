[00:00] people come through the door.

[00:02] How's everybody doing?

[00:04] Here we go.

[00:05] All right.

[00:07] So everybody, welcome to the Saturday morning's

[00:11] spectacular, I'm your host, Canada.

[00:15] You know, I say I was to try to record this on audacity,

[00:20] but it is what it is.

[00:21] We're just gonna do it here.

[00:22] I'll take the audio off of YouTube.

[00:24] Everybody, how's everybody going?

[00:25] First and foremost, I wanna say,

[00:27] I hope everybody had a really great holiday.

[00:30] I hope you enjoyed time with family.

[00:33] I think it's so important that we remember

[00:37] the priorities in life.

[00:39] So I just spoiled Brenda.

[00:40] I think I got her more than a Pimball machine

[00:43] and some nice stuff to wear on her wrists.

[00:46] So instead of buying a Pimball machine,

[00:49] I'm gonna keep the wife very happy.

[00:52] Your wife is hot.

[00:53] Yes, she is very, very hot.

[00:56] Thank you so much for saying that.

[00:58] What we're gonna do is we're gonna look at,

[01:02] on this episode of the Saturday Morning's spectacular,

[01:04] starting about 20 minutes late,

[01:08] we're gonna look at all the games that were revealed,

[01:12] basically in 2024.

[01:14] Not all of them came out.

[01:16] Some of them are gonna be eligible for categories

[01:18] because we saw maybe the artwork

[01:21] or we saw the toys in a game.

[01:23] And I'm gonna give you just my opinion

[01:27] on who deserves Acudos, a Canadian Cudule Award

[01:32] for bringing some of the best to Pimball in 2024.

[01:36] How does that sound?

[01:36] Is everybody ready for this show?

[01:38] Insert the applause, insert the twippies before the twippies.

[01:43] Insert, I don't know if Canadian's gonna go down

[01:47] to Wormhole Pimball to see the 2024 Twippies.

[01:50] All right, so just put it in the comment section.

[01:52] The last comment I got was from Kelly Daniels.

[01:54] That is at it, are we done there?

[01:56] Are you guys still typing?

[01:57] I wanna make sure my chat is refreshing automatically.

[02:00] All right, wait on John to get here.

[02:02] John Early is not in the house yet.

[02:05] All right, well, how many people we got in the house right now?

[02:07] Let's see, let's see what we got.

[02:10] All right, we're good.

[02:10] Let's get this party started, all right?

[02:13] And look, write your comments in the chat

[02:15] because I'm gonna be following along with the chat

[02:17] as we go into the Canadian Kudos Awards.

[02:22] Right now, let's see what we got here.

[02:24] We've got just 45 lonely souls watching.

[02:29] I know, when I do this on Facebook,

[02:31] we always get more people,

[02:33] but we'll get people a few minutes to come in the door.

[02:35] Before we start this, I do wanna say that it's gonna be

[02:40] an exciting couple of weeks.

[02:42] We're gonna see the new game from Brian Eddie

[02:45] and Stern Pimball.

[02:46] No, Stern Pimball has not invited Canada

[02:50] to visit on January 7th.

[02:53] Tuesday, I would not go anyway, as I've been saying,

[02:57] because it is basically the first week back at work.

[03:01] And I just don't think people should have

[03:03] the burn of vacation day to go visit Stern.

[03:06] I think they should have done it over the weekend.

[03:08] I also think all Pimball content creators

[03:10] should have their own webinar.

[03:13] So we could see this game without having to travel.

[03:17] And if Stern Pimball wants us to travel,

[03:19] I think they should pay for the travel.

[03:21] And they paid for the travel when people went in

[03:24] to see John Wick.

[03:26] Jersey Jack Pimball did the right thing

[03:28] and set up everybody with not just travel,

[03:30] but hotel room.

[03:32] I think Jersey Jack gave us somewhere around like $800

[03:35] to book our travel to go see Avatar.

[03:38] So I just don't think, but here's the thing Cody,

[03:41] it's like the webinar would be leaked.

[03:44] Well, do it all at once.

[03:46] Do it all at once.

[03:47] I don't know.

[03:48] I don't know what to tell you guys.

[03:49] I guess there's no way to prevent leaks

[03:52] in the world of Pimball.

[03:53] We're all just so damn hungry to see what's around the corner.

[03:57] All right, so let's do this.

[03:58] Let's just say 2025 is going to be a better year than 2024.

[04:04] And as we see about last year's games,

[04:08] let's first look at who the contestants are.

[04:11] These are the games that are eligible

[04:13] to win a Canadian Kudos Award in 2024.

[04:18] There are some games that are not on here

[04:20] that you might think should be on here.

[04:21] We'll talk about that for a little bit.

[04:23] And then we will get to the awards themselves.

[04:26] How does that sound?

[04:26] You guys are ready?

[04:28] All right, and I'm curious what you guys think in the chat

[04:32] as we watch the Canadian Kudos Awards 2024.

[04:36] So I'm going to give you guys all the games that came out

[04:40] in the order in which they came out.

[04:43] So if you were alive on Planet Earth starting in December of 2023,

[04:49] this is the order in which games came out

[04:52] and we learned about each of these games for the first time.

[04:56] So the first one is Texas Chainsaw Massacre December 2023

[05:01] is eligible for awards.

[05:04] Looney Tunes, same exact layout,

[05:07] different art package December 2023 came out.

[05:11] Then we got Jaws in January.

[05:14] It was a big January for Stern Pimble.

[05:16] Keith L. Wins much rumored Jaws made its way to the market

[05:20] and it's now a hard game to get.

[05:23] If you want an Ellie of Jaws Pimble, good luck.

[05:28] Then we got the Princess Bride from Multimorphic

[05:32] was revealed to the world in February of 2024.

[05:37] I still don't think anybody has in their possession

[05:42] this version of the game with the swords on the side

[05:47] and sort of like the Ellie package of the game.

[05:50] So it just goes to show you some of these games,

[05:53] the gap between reveal and delivery can be humongous.

[05:59] You're not going to see on this list Pulp Fiction.

[06:03] That game is two years old.

[06:05] I'm not giving Pulp Fiction what's wrong?

[06:07] I don't know, it just says something's wrong.

[06:10] Is anything wrong that I get something wrong?

[06:13] All right, so that's February.

[06:14] Then in March, we got Ninja Eclipse from Turner Pimble

[06:20] in its new cabinet.

[06:21] Chris Turner took the advice from everybody, put the game

[06:25] in a normal cabinet, brought it to TpF

[06:29] and has since sold all 100 units of his Ninja Eclipse game

[06:34] and at the rate at which Pimble prices are going through

[06:37] the ceiling, I think everyone feels Ninja Eclipse

[06:40] is a somewhat decent buy in the world of Pimble these days.

[06:44] Then we get barbecue challenge came out in March as well.

[06:51] I got a lot of slack from a lot of people

[06:53] because I left off barbecue challenge

[06:56] in Canada's worst of 2024.

[07:01] So I'm going to put it into the best of

[07:04] and spoiler alert, I'm just going to let you know right now.

[07:08] It is not going to win any awards

[07:11] for the best of Pimble in 2024.

[07:16] Then we had Abba Pimble from the Pimble Brothers in April.

[07:21] This is one of the most inspired cabinet artworks

[07:25] of all time.

[07:26] I can't believe this ever got approved.

[07:29] I'm not sure what they were going for

[07:31] but they definitely nailed it and failed it

[07:33] at the same exact time.

[07:36] Then we got the fun house remake from Pjody Gaming in May

[07:40] of 2023.

[07:43] We got John Wick Pimble, what a launch that was.

[07:47] No guns on the artwork, John Wick Pimble

[07:50] in May of 2023.

[07:53] Stern Pimble invited people,

[07:55] fully expense paid trip to come there and

[07:58] chill the game and we know who went over there.

[08:02] Most people didn't buy it but some people did

[08:04] but this is probably one of Stern's weakest launches

[08:08] in company history next to Venom and WWE and Mustang

[08:14] and there's not that many Stern games

[08:16] that have just been flops.

[08:18] This game really was a flops.

[08:20] Then we got X-Men in September.

[08:23] I hope we got these dates right.

[08:24] So May, nothing June, July, August, September.

[08:28] We start to see new titles.

[08:30] This is usually what happens every year

[08:33] as people get ready for expo and the end of the year.

[08:37] We saw the uncanny X-Men.

[08:38] I think this game has a really bipolar sort of response

[08:43] from the community.

[08:44] It had an incredible launch.

[08:46] It's obviously a gorgeous game

[08:49] but there is definitely Marvel fatigue

[08:51] and the issues with the game itself both

[08:56] code wise and some of the mechanical issues with the game

[09:00] have really soiled the launch and the reception

[09:04] this game has had over the last few months.

[09:06] Avatar, Jersey Jack Pimble flew a bunch of media

[09:10] myself included to go to Jersey Jack Pimble

[09:13] and see Avatar Pimble.

[09:16] It was a rumored theme for a long time.

[09:18] It was a questionable theme.

[09:20] Beautiful art package on the game.

[09:21] Very stunning game to walk up to.

[09:24] But we will see how well this game does

[09:27] when we look at the Kudos Awards.

[09:30] It's a theme that really has a gargantuan hill decline

[09:35] when it comes to is this a theme we even want it in Pimble?

[09:39] And then we got Metallica remastered in October

[09:44] and Stern just dropped the hammer down with this game

[09:48] and they went back to 500 LEDs.

[09:52] They really kind of made an all new game with it

[09:54] by adding a lot of clips and a lot of band footage

[09:57] and new artwork and we all know now this game.

[10:00] I think I just saw one on Pinside someone wants

[10:03] $25,000 firm.

[10:05] That's a bonkers ludicrous price.

[10:07] But Metallica LEDs sort of took all the wind

[10:10] out of the sales of X-Men and everything else.

[10:15] So that came out in October.

[10:18] We also got Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,

[10:21] the much debated zombie-eddy colorization game

[10:26] from Dutch Pimble, Alex, Barry, and Melvin over there.

[10:30] Lots of sort of conversation around this game.

[10:33] I believe they're all spoken for.

[10:36] That being said, every time someone looks for a spot,

[10:40] they don't seem to have a hard time finding one.

[10:43] So I think while people have given a deposit on this game,

[10:47] when they finally get their game

[10:50] or they get asked to pay for the remainder of the deposit,

[10:54] I think you're gonna see more and more of these games.

[10:57] Pop up for sale.

[10:59] It is a beautiful game.

[11:01] It is still very controversial, the fact that it exists.

[11:04] But as you can see, a very stunning piece of artwork,

[11:08] which is really the point of this game itself.

[11:11] And then we're also gonna throw Evil Dead into the mix.

[11:14] It just got revealed.

[11:16] I think we've seen enough of Evil Dead gameplay,

[11:19] of artwork, of topper, of callouts, of code,

[11:23] to include it in this year's Canadian Kudos Awards.

[11:27] I always think it's unfortunate

[11:29] when the Twippies make a game like this ineligible

[11:33] to be recognized as the best of 2024

[11:37] because we all were looking at

[11:41] and celebrating this game in this fiscal year.

[11:44] And I don't think anybody,

[11:46] I don't think anybody wonders whether or not,

[11:49] we're gonna see these games make their way into boxes.

[11:53] Yes, I thank you, Jesse, for keeping me on.

[11:55] As Alice may have been September, not October,

[11:59] but no big deal there.

[12:01] So ladies and gentlemen,

[12:03] I think this is probably the most important slide

[12:06] I also just think about.

[12:08] An entire fiscal year went by.

[12:11] And these are the themes that all of the Pinball Company market

[12:17] any year in which Pinball is the most expensive

[12:20] it has ever been, okay?

[12:23] This is what they think you and I want.

[12:28] And I just wanna say, when you look at this,

[12:31] when you look at these games,

[12:33] how bad this hobby has missed the mark.

[12:37] In overall, in giving us a plethora of themes

[12:42] that are what 40 to 60 year old men

[12:45] who buy these overpriced toys,

[12:48] these themes should be jumping off the page at us.

[12:52] These themes should have an emotional

[12:54] and a gravitational pull that makes you wanna spend

[12:59] this kind of money on these games.

[13:01] And I just think overall,

[13:03] this is indicative of an industry,

[13:06] an obahabi that does very little market research

[13:10] that has been too successful for too long

[13:14] doing no market research

[13:16] and is now sort of waking up to the sober reality

[13:20] that it's not good enough anymore.

[13:22] You've gotta really make sure

[13:25] that you put a theme out there that we want.

[13:28] So here's how we're gonna do it.

[13:30] It's gonna be real simple, real fun.

[13:32] I'm curious what you guys think in the comments.

[13:35] We've got over 100 people watching right now.

[13:38] Thank you everybody.

[13:39] Oh my God, did I, I left out?

[13:42] Did I, wait, wait, wait, David,

[13:44] I didn't leave out Labyrinth, right?

[13:46] Labyrinth came out in 2023.

[13:50] I just wanna make sure I get that right.

[13:52] So Labyrinth is a game that was not eligible

[13:56] because Labyrinth did come out in 2023

[14:00] or was revealed then in October, I believe.

[14:03] So David, I just wanna make sure we're right with that.

[14:05] I also did not include Pulp Fiction

[14:09] because Pulp Fiction is two years ago.

[14:11] So I just wanna make sure this is it.

[14:13] Is there anything missing from this list

[14:15] that you think should be here right now?

[14:17] I know there's maybe spinal tap.

[14:19] I know Blues Brothers.

[14:21] I know maybe a pinball adventures game.

[14:24] But right now I'm counting one, two, three, four, five,

[14:28] six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 pinball machines.

[14:34] 14.

[14:35] I mean, that is absolutely bonkers

[14:38] that there are so many games.

[14:40] And yet I think deep down we all know

[14:43] these are not really the themes that blew us away.

[14:46] All right, so here's, here's what we're gonna do.

[14:48] There's a little bit of a, you know what my font

[14:50] got a little messed up on this.

[14:51] So I'm gonna, I'm gonna read over this thing

[14:55] when the screen changes.

[14:56] I'm waiting for it to change on YouTube.

[14:58] Okay, it got messed up on when I converted over to this font.

[15:02] So we're gonna do best sound, best toys and mechs,

[15:05] best animations displayed, best rules, best top

[15:08] or best theme, best theme integration, best call outs,

[15:11] best launch reveal, coolest company and pinball, best artwork,

[15:15] best gameplay layout and game of the year.

[15:17] How does that sound?

[15:18] All right, all right.

[15:21] So I hope these fonts are not, they're not the fonts I used.

[15:24] So we might see some font issues on this version

[15:29] of my PowerPoint.

[15:31] So in terms of best sound and what was the best sound

[15:37] in a pinball machine, I'm curious what you guys think

[15:41] had the best sound in a pinball machine in 2024.

[15:49] You walk up to the game and what you're hearing

[15:52] from an audio standpoint, like absolutely sort of,

[15:56] and I know it's always hard with best sound is some games have,

[16:02] you know, they have music from a critically claimed artist,

[16:07] but my kudos for best sound.

[16:08] And again, there wasn't really, no, I'm not doing

[16:11] a best location award.

[16:13] I just wanna clarify this, I hate best location awards

[16:17] for pinball.

[16:18] Every pinball location is a great location.

[16:21] Some are better than others, but the fact that why would you give it

[16:23] an award like this location beat that location, right?

[16:28] No one says like, all right, no, you know what I'm saying?

[16:31] Like we don't think about locations like that.

[16:33] And the fact that there was like eight or nine

[16:35] trippy awards for best location, Northeast, Northwest,

[16:39] Southeast, it's just so silly gang.

[16:42] I just, I think it's so ridiculous

[16:45] that that is even a category, right?

[16:48] So even though I love playing on location,

[16:50] I'm not gonna give kudos awards.

[16:51] Cause again, like I haven't visited any of them

[16:53] other than one or two.

[16:55] So why would I give that an awards?

[16:57] All right.

[16:58] So the best sound kudo winner goes to,

[17:02] and I think this is flipping a little bit,

[17:04] a little bit slower than me is Metallica.

[17:07] And I know what you might be saying that Metallica

[17:11] is using Metallica music, but look,

[17:14] out of all of the games, this game just rocks

[17:18] from an audio standpoint.

[17:20] And when you stand over this game

[17:23] and the speakers are set to like volume 11,

[17:27] Metallica easily has the best sound in a game.

[17:31] And they made it even better.

[17:33] And so I don't, look, again, I know there's always

[17:36] the debate whether or not music pins should be excluded,

[17:39] but it is, okay.

[17:42] And so other than that, I wanna give this game

[17:45] the best sound winner of 2024.

[17:48] All right, best toys and mechs in a game.

[17:50] So this one is hard.

[17:52] This one is hard because I really do think

[17:55] when you look at all of these games,

[17:58] and we look at the best toys in the mechs,

[18:00] and I'm sorry that the font is going off here

[18:01] because when I uploaded it to Brenda's computer,

[18:04] she doesn't have the same fonts I have, but,

[18:07] you know, look, I just gotta say overall,

[18:10] overall, it was a horrible year for toys and mechs.

[18:16] I horrible year for toys, mechs.

[18:18] You know what?

[18:19] I know someone is saying evil dead,

[18:20] and I'm telling you right now.

[18:23] I'm telling you right now, evil dead.

[18:26] I didn't give it to evil dead, and I'll tell you why,

[18:28] because I gave it to the one mechanism

[18:31] that I think was the most creative single mech

[18:36] in all of Pimball in 2024.

[18:41] And I would say yes, honorable mention,

[18:45] evil dead had the most amount of fun toys and mechs in it.

[18:50] But again, I'm just saying right now,

[18:53] the single mech that I think does the most creative thing

[18:58] from a physical standpoint, you're gonna hate me,

[19:01] you're gonna hate me, and don't worry, don't worry people.

[19:04] But I think the best toy

[19:08] from just a pure creativity standpoint

[19:12] is the magnetic ball grab in the cliffs of insanity

[19:18] in the Princess bride, where it magnetically grabs the Pimball

[19:24] and slowly goes up the cliffs of insanity.

[19:28] I just thought out of all the toys,

[19:31] that was one of the most unique Pimball toys I'd seen in a while.

[19:37] And I also do like, yes, I have not played the evil dead.

[19:40] That is my excuse for not making evil dead the winner.

[19:43] But I just wanna see more stuff like this in Pimball.

[19:47] And I think that multi-morphic has put a lot of really great

[19:52] mechanical mechs into its games, albeit it is all pushed

[19:57] to the back of the game, but I just wanna say

[20:01] that like that cliffs of insanity mechanism

[20:05] and seeing that ball go up the rope magnetically is super cool.

[20:10] All right, so that wins my best toy or mech in Pimball of 2024.

[20:16] And again, gang, it was a crappy year for toys and mechs.

[20:19] There, nothing in Godzilla was a while,

[20:22] nothing in John Wick.

[20:24] The X-Men Sentinel, again, I think we've all seen

[20:29] too much gameplay of the Sentinel mechanisms working,

[20:34] where it doesn't really create the wow,

[20:37] I think people thought it would.

[20:39] There's cool stuff happening, but again,

[20:41] it just didn't execute in that way that I think a mech should.

[20:46] All right, so the best animations and display in a Pimball machine are.

[20:52] And as we think about everything out there and the roster,

[20:57] I'm saying, and what is the best animations or display?

[21:02] This is a hard one to me because I do think

[21:04] when it comes to best animations and display,

[21:07] I do think you need to look beyond just like the clips,

[21:11] because obviously Jersey Jack is displaying in Avatar movie

[21:16] that cost, you know, $500 million to make

[21:19] or whatever it costs to make.

[21:21] And when I think about animations and display,

[21:26] I think about, you know, I haven't played enough Metallica.

[21:31] People are saying Metallica is awesome.

[21:33] And so, but for me, the one that won this,

[21:38] just because I think about, you know, what's on the screen?

[21:42] Does it use the assets that you want to see?

[21:46] Does it arrange them in a way that lets you enjoy them

[21:50] and have they code it, you know, animations

[21:53] that make their way up onto the display

[21:56] that is really creative and really unique.

[22:00] And of course, are the clips synced up

[22:02] with what you're seeing.

[22:04] And so I think, jaws to me,

[22:07] wins the Canadian Kudos Award for the best animations

[22:11] and display, because again, I just think it's a game

[22:16] where when you look at what they put on the screen,

[22:20] it's just integrated so well.

[22:23] And I don't think anything has done a better job than jaws.

[22:27] I think jaws is one of the nicest sort of coded games

[22:32] in pinball in a long time.

[22:34] And I think Keith Owens just gets the best team out there

[22:37] to help him put his games vision into fruition

[22:42] on that screen in a way that is really, really well done.

[22:46] So, here's the thing.

[22:49] So best rules in a game.

[22:51] Now, I got to say, I got to say,

[22:54] I don't, this is really hard this one,

[22:57] because obviously, you know,

[23:01] Metallica should win this,

[23:03] because Lyman's rule sets the best and Lyman's amazing.

[23:06] But again, Lyman did that 12 years ago.

[23:10] So I do think, again, when we look at all the machines

[23:15] that came out, it has the replay value,

[23:19] which game is giving people the most fun

[23:21] to jump on time and time again.

[23:25] I'm gonna give this one to jaws pinball.

[23:30] And I think jaws does have the best rules.

[23:33] I think it has sort of the,

[23:36] I don't think the owners,

[23:37] when you watch people talk about jaws

[23:40] and what makes this game so addictive,

[23:45] you know, despite not having the mechanical magic

[23:48] I think this game should have,

[23:50] I do think what it does do well.

[23:53] And I think it does make anyone who loves jaws

[23:57] really fall in love with the rules set

[24:00] and how you progress through the game.

[24:02] And so I do think jaws pinball is the best rules.

[24:06] You guys, you know, again, I'm reading the chat.

[24:08] I'm wondering if you guys think differently.

[24:12] Some people are saying, does Metallica allow you

[24:14] to play with Lyman rules only?

[24:16] I'm not sure, I don't think so.

[24:18] This is turning into Canadian job interview for Stern.

[24:22] It is not, Donk, do you think Donk that jaws

[24:26] does not deserve to win best rules set?

[24:29] I think it does.

[24:30] What's the best for newbies?

[24:32] Godzilla 70, if you know what I didn't put in here

[24:35] and I'm gonna add it,

[24:36] I'm gonna do it right now.

[24:39] I'm gonna do it when I talk about best topper

[24:41] because I did the worst game you could buy.

[24:45] I'm gonna do the one that doesn't have a slide.

[24:47] I'll do it now with best topper.

[24:50] But before I do best topper award,

[24:53] I wanna give an award for what's the best,

[24:56] I'll do the best new in box bang for the buck

[25:00] you could buy in pinball.

[25:02] I'll do that at the end, I'll do that later on.

[25:03] Let's stay on the slides.

[25:07] topper.

[25:09] Now look, I think there is a few here going on

[25:13] that obviously, oh, I've just lost my breath for a minute.

[25:17] Let me get some coffee.

[25:17] I need some energy.

[25:19] Now, I've seen the evil dead topper.

[25:22] I've seen the metallic topper, the avatod topper.

[25:26] I've seen the looney tunes and the Texas chainsaw massacre.

[25:29] We've seen the one for Princess Bride.

[25:31] I've seen the jaws topper.

[25:33] In the end, the best topper.

[25:36] You know, when I think about this

[25:38] and what a topper, you know, there's weight, first of all,

[25:43] there's the outspoken,

[25:44] and what a topper, you know, there's weight,

[25:47] first of all, the Alice is Wonderland topper,

[25:50] is really cool, very sculpted.

[25:54] The thing is, is this, in my honest opinion,

[25:58] I think toppers have become the topic of conversation

[26:03] way too often.

[26:05] And I think this is why, looking at all these games,

[26:08] I think we've started to migrate above the damn game itself

[26:13] because so much of what's under the glass is uninspired

[26:17] that we're trying to find a way to justify

[26:20] the cost of these machines,

[26:22] and we're now celebrating something you barely will ever see

[26:26] when you, when you play the game.

[26:29] All right, if you don't pick the, like, gang,

[26:32] I'm just gonna say this right now.

[26:35] This is a tough one.

[26:37] This one came between two different games,

[26:40] but I look, I've seen the Evil Dead topper.

[26:44] It is very cool and unique,

[26:47] but I'm giving it to Avatar.

[26:51] I'm giving it to Avatar, and I'll tell you why.

[26:54] I'll tell you why.

[26:56] Look, nothing against the Evil Dead topper,

[26:58] which would obviously be the runner up here.

[27:01] But if you've never stood in front of the Avatar's CE topper,

[27:06] I don't think you understand this is easily

[27:11] the most beautiful, sort of gorgeous thing I've ever seen

[27:18] on top of a game.

[27:21] And I mean that.

[27:23] I mean that.

[27:24] It is way better than the Mandalorian topper

[27:27] and it looks insane.

[27:30] And again, this is nothing against the Evil Dead topper,

[27:34] but I just think that for me is, you know,

[27:42] it's not as like gorgeous.

[27:44] I actually like the, I'm just gonna say,

[27:48] I actually like, don't kill me.

[27:51] I like the franchy version of the Evil Dead topper,

[27:56] like even better than the $1,300 topper here

[28:01] because the art sinks up perfectly with the game

[28:05] and it just feels so connected.

[28:08] Where, you know, this Evil Dead topper to me,

[28:11] it does feel a little like aftermarket,

[28:15] like home-brewish kind of stuck on top.

[28:18] I'm just saying, I'm just saying, thank you Zach

[28:21] for saying I'm high.

[28:22] It's, look, it's a gang.

[28:24] It would easily be number two,

[28:27] but I definitely, I mean, I wish I could give

[28:30] two awards for best toppers because they're both

[28:34] really nice, but I think the Avatar topper

[28:37] is just so stunning.

[28:39] I, again, again, this is very subjective

[28:44] and I like that this has created some division

[28:47] amongst people in the chat.

[28:49] I like that we have about 100 people watching right now.

[28:53] I like that Christopher Franchi is booing me right now.

[28:57] All of this is good.

[28:59] Franchi, I'm sorry.

[29:01] Ah, they're trading their Canadian club deposits.

[29:05] Okay.

[29:07] I mean, also Jersey Jack has to win something, right?

[29:09] Just something, something.

[29:10] Okay.

[29:11] The best theme in pinball.

[29:14] What was the best theme in what is arguably

[29:19] the worst year for themes in pinball history?

[29:21] I mean that.

[29:23] This, look at this.

[29:24] This is what these companies came up with.

[29:27] 40 to 60 year old millionaires.

[29:30] This is what you think gets them going.

[29:33] Looney tunes.

[29:35] Avatar.

[29:37] Barbecue.

[29:38] Ninja clips.

[29:40] Abba.

[29:41] John Wick.

[29:42] Fun house.

[29:44] It was the worst year in a long time for best theme of pinball.

[29:51] This one was easy.

[29:54] This one was easy.

[29:56] Obviously, John's pinball is the best theme that came

[30:01] to market in 2024.

[30:06] It is an iconic movie.

[30:10] It is a Spielberg movie.

[30:12] It has everything you want.

[30:15] It has, you know, it's just such a, it's a great theme for pinball.

[30:21] It's a great theme for pinball.

[30:23] It's made a hitting it on the head with the themes.

[30:25] OK.

[30:26] So the best theme integration.

[30:31] Right.

[30:32] All right.

[30:32] John's is the best theme.

[30:35] Is John's going to win for best theme integration?

[30:39] No.

[30:40] It's not spoiler alert.

[30:42] How can I give the best theme integration in which the word

[30:45] integration is off the screen?

[30:47] I've fought issues.

[30:49] To a game about a shark that eats things.

[30:53] And the damn shark doesn't eat anything.

[30:56] It absolutely is, I still believe to this day one of the biggest misses

[31:03] when it comes to theme integration.

[31:05] I also think the upper play field doesn't look like a boat at all.

[31:09] It doesn't look like the Orca.

[31:11] Have you stood over jaws and just looked at that Orca?

[31:15] It is the cheapest, cheapest, like,

[31:19] flat plastic looking upper play field that's meant to look like a ship.

[31:24] I mean, then go look at the pirate ship in Jersey Jack's Pirates of the Caribbean.

[31:30] And you tell me that Stern is charging us $13,000.

[31:34] And that's what a ship is supposed to look like.

[31:36] It's terrible.

[31:37] It's absolutely terrible.

[31:40] So the best theme integrated pin.

[31:42] When I want to give you my criteria for what I mean, I mean a game that,

[31:48] I mean, it takes everything you love about the theme.

[31:51] It builds a world under glass that brings that theme to life with everything you'd want.

[31:57] I mean, a game that gives you all the moments from the subject matter on the screen

[32:04] with synced up audio and video.

[32:08] I mean, a game that just connects the moments from that property

[32:15] into the gameplay, into modes, into mechanical things,

[32:20] in moments of, wow, if you think about a game like, Lord of the Rings,

[32:23] how amazing is it destroying the ring or battling ballrog when he swings out to block your pathway?

[32:30] It's like, we need more of that in Pimble.

[32:33] We need more of that in Pimble.

[32:34] And there's not enough of it.

[32:36] And when I look at this game and I look at the integration of the source IP into the game

[32:43] itself without a doubt, without a doubt, the best theme integration,

[32:50] Kudo winner is spooky pinball's evil dead.

[32:54] And this game, I mean, I wish it wasn't evil dead.

[32:58] I get it.

[32:59] I wish it was goonies, goonies is coming.

[33:01] They know it's coming.

[33:02] Watch how quiet they get right now when I say goonies is next with a big pirate ship.

[33:07] They know it's next bug is not going to say anything.

[33:10] A bug, a spooky Luke, all you guys on here right now, just in the chat,

[33:16] deny that it's goonies next.

[33:18] All right, you're not going to see them deny it.

[33:21] They're not going to be able to write anything.

[33:23] But evil dead to me is what we want.

[33:28] And it is what we want when it comes to theme integration.

[33:32] And the thing is this, when you listen to the team over at spooky pinball,

[33:36] when you listen to them talk about what went into making this game,

[33:41] there is just a level of passion and connection to these themes that they are now,

[33:47] and I mean, they now have the talent to integrate the themes in the right way.

[33:53] I would say five years ago they didn't.

[33:55] They just didn't.

[33:56] I think they've learned a lot.

[33:57] I think they've grown as a company.

[33:59] And now I think they're definitely punching above their old weight class

[34:05] and they're bringing pinball machines into market with amazing stuff.

[34:11] So the spooky Luke say anything about goonies.

[34:14] I'm busy deciding goonies.

[34:16] I've won Magnet Lift Mech.

[34:18] Oh, that's amazing.

[34:19] That's amazing.

[34:20] OK, you know what, spooky Luke?

[34:22] I get it.

[34:23] I get it.

[34:24] This game also does deserve to win the Qto's for the most amount of toys in mechs in a game.

[34:31] I will give you an honorary Qto.

[34:35] If we were to go off of like total toys in mechs in a game,

[34:39] Evil Dead should get the Qto for it.

[34:41] I'm getting pressured.

[34:42] I'm getting pressured here.

[34:43] I feel the peer pressure.

[34:46] Best pinball machine in front of a window.

[34:48] Canada.

[34:48] Oh, man, you guys are brutal.

[34:51] You guys are brutal.

[34:52] All right.

[34:53] So the best call outs in a pinball machine.

[34:57] And I do believe that call outs

[34:59] is an important part of every pinball game.

[35:03] And sometimes call outs can be a unique way.

[35:06] You take the clips from the TV show or the movie, right?

[35:10] And you use them.

[35:11] Again, I use Lord.

[35:13] The Rings is an example of the way they grab the moments from the film.

[35:17] Really create an amazing journey and sort of shopping up the film to make those call outs

[35:24] so exciting is what makes Lord.

[35:27] The Rings such a fun game to play.

[35:29] The thing about, when you think about jaws and they got Richard Dreyfus doing the call outs,

[35:35] were those the best call outs in pinball?

[35:38] I know jaws definitely uses the clips from the movie in a good way.

[35:44] When we look at one of the weirdest call outs, like the call outs kind of only tell you

[35:49] what to shoot, you're not really getting excitement from those call outs.

[35:55] X-Men's call outs have been really, how do you say this?

[36:00] I mean, it's just for some reason, when they get some of those voice actors with saber

[36:06] tooth and the other Marvel characters, they're just not exciting people.

[36:13] Metallica call outs.

[36:15] Again, maybe, I think that Metallica definitely has some energetic call outs.

[36:23] This one was hard.

[36:27] I think that the best call outs in all of these games and just having listened to them

[36:34] recently.

[36:35] I went back and I watched a bunch of gameplay.

[36:38] I do think the call outs in Evil Dead, to me, are just like the best because I just

[36:45] think what they wrote and what they've told Ash to say, Bruce Campbell to say in these

[36:52] clips is just really, really great.

[36:55] A lot of, Anthony, you guys like, what the heck?

[37:00] This is open for debate, but in my honest opinion, I think the stuff they put into this game

[37:09] has a lot of really good call outs.

[37:13] That's my thing.

[37:16] The mob is speaking here.

[37:19] So I'm wondering if you guys think another game should have best call outs in it.

[37:24] I think overall, the entire Pimbo world's call outs are flat.

[37:32] I think that people should go back and listen to how the voice actors were directed in the

[37:38] Bally Williams days.

[37:40] Go listen to the call outs in Medieval Madness and attack from Mars and all those classic

[37:46] games.

[37:48] They did such a better job getting animated and getting energy into the call outs.

[37:53] So I say overall, we need to see just better energy and better call outs from these Pimbo

[38:02] companies.

[38:03] All right.

[38:04] So next game was who had the best launch and reveal of a game?

[38:12] And this one, even as I'm about to show you who won, I think this one comes down to a

[38:22] criteria that is, because I looked at this from a pure marketing standpoint, right?

[38:31] Like who, when they revealed their game to the world, like who just revealed it in the

[38:37] best way possible?

[38:40] And I also want to say that when it comes to marketing and doing something exciting,

[38:47] during your Pimbo reveal, I said this to Seth Davis, I said it to Gary, I said it to,

[38:55] George Gomez, I think all Pimbo marketing, when it comes to a move that a company can

[39:03] make that everyone would remember forever as the way they revealed and launched the game

[39:10] is something that this industry needs to sort of improve upon.

[39:14] And I'll give you an example gang.

[39:16] Like if I was working over at Storm Pimbo, how are you not having a D&D tournament to see

[39:25] who wins D&D number one, Ellie off the line?

[39:30] Like how did you not think to do that?

[39:34] And again, the reason why these companies are so, they're so stuck in a boring way of

[39:40] revealing a game is we all know it's Dungeons and Dragons.

[39:44] And so they easily could have just revealed the theme without showing you the game.

[39:51] And Storm Pimbo could have had a fun D&D tournament that took place at Expo or took place

[39:58] around different key markets where you give people the chance to win an LE by being the

[40:04] best D&D player and Pimbo fanatic.

[40:08] So D&D isn't really a game you win, how's it not a game you win?

[40:12] Nobody wins, you just keep playing?

[40:13] There's no way to make a D&D tournament.

[40:18] That's so weird to me.

[40:19] All right, so that's crazy to me.

[40:21] So you just play the game and you just level up these characters and that's it.

[40:26] So how do you win the Pimbo machine?

[40:28] Wow, this is like honestly, or okay, okay.

[40:31] So if you can't win in D&D, how fun would it be to just do a D&D tournament where Pimbo

[40:40] fans can come up, I'm going to give you a new idea, all right, a new idea.

[40:45] Of course I didn't do research on D&D because nobody I knew played D&D grown up nor did

[40:50] I, but I do know that there is a 20-sided die, right?

[40:54] All right, so imagine this, idea number two, can it as brain doesn't stop?

[41:00] Imagine if you had a tournament in which people could just go head to head against each

[41:04] other and each roll the die and whoever rolls the highest number advances to the next round

[41:11] and you do a 20-sided die contest to see who gets D&D number one.

[41:17] All right, can you do that?

[41:19] Can we do that?

[41:20] Would that be enough of a fun thing to do?

[41:24] But in the end game, like there's really not much that's ever really done.

[41:28] Now look, just on a pure marketing level, on a pure marketing level, the best launch

[41:37] was the $100,000, I mean they spend $100,000 on the launch video game.

[41:43] It should be the best reveal and launch of a game.

[41:48] And I think in the end the game didn't deliver, but when they launched it, remember, everyone

[41:55] has got to remember this, when this game launched, there was a moment in which a lot of our

[42:03] skepticism was sort of taken over by the beauty of that launch moment and that video and

[42:10] the way they put that all together was pretty spectacular.

[42:15] Now I want everybody to go do this.

[42:17] Go back and watch that $100,000 launch video and watch how they talk about the game,

[42:26] but then watch how they actually show you the footage of the game.

[42:30] What is coming out of Mark Siden's mouth and the team at Jersey Jack does not sink up

[42:36] at all with the actual footage that is so pedestrian and mediocre.

[42:42] They're like, oh, no, then you battle the kernel and then you see the kernel like cheap

[42:46] little toy that doesn't really interact with the ball just the knife going up and down.

[42:50] So it's kind of funny, right?

[42:52] And then the UV ain't didn't really work and carry hardy, like expose the fact that they

[42:57] had extra UV lighting on the ceiling.

[43:01] And so the whole thing was a little bit of smoke and mirrors in a way and they knew they

[43:06] didn't have enough of a game.

[43:09] But it still was the best video.

[43:12] And I do think when it comes to like the best vibes, yeah, the evil dead launch was great

[43:17] vibes and and and jaws was also really good as well.

[43:22] All right, the coolest company in Pimble.

[43:26] Who is the coolest company in Pimble?

[43:28] I mean, I always say this, the criteria for this one, you got Turner, you got American

[43:33] Pimble, you got Pimble brothers, Pajready gaming, you got Dutch Pimble.

[43:39] You know, when you think about who's the that is just like the one you want to open up

[43:45] the door and go have a beer with the one who's part of the community day in and day out,

[43:51] the one who seemingly cares the most now about, you know, bringing to market something

[43:58] and listening to feedback.

[43:59] I mean, it's, you know who I'm going to put up here.

[44:04] And and the reason why I think we should celebrate the folks over in Benton, Wisconsin

[44:10] and spooky Pimble, because we're not we're obviously not celebrating their Sartorial

[44:15] choices here, but we should celebrate the fact that this company just really cares a

[44:23] lot, has grown in the right way.

[44:27] And I think continues to do what all of us really want is they continue to be both a part

[44:33] of the community, but also a manufacturer.

[44:37] They continue to listen to feedback in real time and respond to people.

[44:42] They continue to make tons of content on a weekly basis.

[44:48] They continue to make strategic hires like bringing Christopher Franchion board.

[44:52] That was really smart.

[44:54] I think you got to and and they just seem like they're having fun, right?

[44:59] They just seem like they're having a good time.

[45:02] You know, when you open the door to stern Pimble, it's so damn big.

[45:05] You might not even see anybody for like a quarter mile.

[45:10] You know, look, they've got dogs in their photos.

[45:13] I mean, to me, like, that's it.

[45:16] Like they have dogs like inside the company walls.

[45:20] Like that to me is what every Pimble company should have.

[45:24] All right.

[45:25] All right.

[45:26] So spooky Pimble, you guys are pretty cool.

[45:29] Unless it's cool as Canada.

[45:30] All right.

[45:31] We got 120.

[45:32] Wow.

[45:33] We got how do we get to how do 26 people are now watching?

[45:35] Word has got out that the Canadian could was award the most celebrated Pimble award show

[45:40] the history of 2024, the only Pimble award show happening in 2024.

[45:47] Spooky Pimble, congratulations.

[45:49] All right.

[45:50] Best artwork.

[45:51] Damn, man.

[45:52] Damn, if this wasn't the one that made me, made me step back for a little bit, have a

[45:59] shot of whiskey.

[46:01] And really, this is the hard one.

[46:03] This one was like the hardest because there's like, there's a lot.

[46:10] And I think, you know, when I was like looking at all of these, I will say like artwork is

[46:19] an area where Pimble has really grown tremendously.

[46:23] And, you know, I know you don't even see Alice here, but to me, these were the four.

[46:28] I mean, Alice, Alice was not going to win best artwork people.

[46:32] I mean, it's, I do like Alice for sure, but it, you know, there's too much.

[46:40] There's too much controversy around the Alice art package for it to win best artwork.

[46:47] And I sort of, I landed on these four.

[46:52] Really, I really sort of struggled to even pick a winner because when it comes to art

[46:59] package, you know, to me, it's not just the cabinet.

[47:05] It's also what's happening on the play field, right?

[47:08] It's also on the translate on the back box.

[47:12] But sometimes she's got a step back.

[47:14] And I mean this, you got to just like step back and look at the game and just like almost

[47:22] like close your eyes and then open them up and be like, wow, is this like exciting me?

[47:28] Does this feel like fresh, original?

[47:30] Like have we seen this before?

[47:32] Is this feel like, you know, like something we haven't seen before?

[47:36] And, you know, and then every, every element you got to look at, you got to look at the,

[47:43] the apron, you got to look at, you know, everything.

[47:47] And so I had a hard time with this one.

[47:50] But in the end, in the end, again, much to my chagrin because I wish it was another

[47:58] theme, I still think that, you know, when we've seen lots of different art packages from

[48:04] Franchie and I, I mean it when I say it, like these things are just stunning and they're

[48:13] laid out in a way that I think has really shown over time his mastery of knowing how to

[48:23] lay out a pinball art package in a way that just is perfect for the theme.

[48:30] And the thing I love about Franchie is his style is so, it's like, it works on anything

[48:39] that has great source material that he can just enhance and do his thing on and it just

[48:47] looks so damn good.

[48:50] You know what I'm saying?

[48:51] Like, well, you're not, you know, we're like, and yeti, I mean, I want to say this, like

[48:56] yeti's art package on X-Men is phenomenal.

[49:01] I mean that, like absolutely phenomenal.

[49:02] I mean, I like when you watch Yeti hand illustrate X-Men line by line, there's no better illustrator

[49:10] in the history of pinball.

[49:13] And X-Men, I love the layout of it.

[49:15] But I think where X-Men, you know, falls down a little bit is as we've seen a lot of

[49:19] Marvel artwork, right?

[49:21] But it doesn't have as much originality.

[49:24] Avatar is also a beautiful game.

[49:27] But emotionally, I think there's just something about the Avatar art package that like,

[49:30] you know, it's like, you don't get excited about Avatar, the way you do about the other

[49:35] ones.

[49:36] And Metallica stunning Ellie package on the Metallica Ellie remastered.

[49:42] But he's a more of a poster artist.

[49:44] And that's why like the Translight and the cabinet for Metallica are so cool in the back

[49:50] box.

[49:51] I find the Metallica playfield though to be pretty bad.

[49:55] And I think the Metallica is a little underwhelming.

[49:58] And that's the thing about Alice 2 gang is while Alice has like a beautiful, I mean, let's

[50:04] go back to the, I'm going to go quickly here because I'm going to get back to all the

[50:08] games.

[50:09] I want to go to Alice real quick.

[50:11] You're going to see a quick scroll through.

[50:13] But out of all the games, close your eyes gang.

[50:18] The thing about Alice is the playfield is not nearly as good as the cabinet.

[50:26] You know what I'm saying?

[50:27] Like the Yeti artwork does not pull through enough for it to win best art package.

[50:32] But it's still very stunning, still controversial.

[50:35] All right, we're going to go for what are we out here?

[50:39] All right.

[50:40] All right.

[50:41] We did art, launch reveal, close company, best art.

[50:44] All right.

[50:45] Evil dead.

[50:46] All right.

[50:47] I'm going to go for the layout.

[50:52] I'm watching my little screen flip through.

[50:54] So the gameplay layout, this one man, another one where I have to be honest, very, very

[51:04] underwhelming year in this category.

[51:09] I look at all these games and I'm wondering, you know, like, where is it?

[51:15] Where is the best game play layout?

[51:18] I wanted to give this to X-Men I did.

[51:20] I did.

[51:21] I wanted to give it to X-Men because of its creativity.

[51:25] But I can't because of all the issues people are having with their games.

[51:31] And I think, you know, when you look at the issues, it's really not, it's, you know, it's

[51:37] really a shame because you can take creative leaps with a layout.

[51:44] And if it doesn't work, right, or you're having issues with the, you know, I don't know,

[51:50] like the auto plunger or the hand breaking up the wire forms is not exciting or is more

[51:57] frustrating than fun, what game do you just walk up to?

[52:03] And once you know we're all the shots are at, you're going to have the most fun playing

[52:08] it.

[52:09] And, you know, so in the end, even though I don't love the toys in it, I still think the

[52:20] layout of jaws from a pure shooter standpoint is still the best.

[52:30] When you play a dialed-in jaws, I'm seeing some people here say Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[52:37] Yeah.

[52:38] Look, I also, again, I got to be candid here.

[52:41] Like, I think Stern always has an advantage here because they've got the best flippers.

[52:47] They still have the best flipper feel.

[52:51] And I think that even though look, I know you're not seeing Texas Chainsaw Massacre win

[52:56] anything here, but it's, Elwin's just still on a different level here.

[53:02] And I think I don't think people would argue that jaws is layout, you know, and for

[53:07] a guy that has done a lot, he continues to make games that just have incredible flow

[53:14] and combos and shots.

[53:16] I'm seeing a lot of people here, maybe just a few people here, but Texas Chainsaw Massacre

[53:22] seems to be another fan favorite.

[53:24] Yeah, I mean, the layout of Spooky's, Texas and Looney Tunes is definitely worth a shout-out.

[53:31] A lot of interesting shots in those games, a lot to shoot at and shoot for.

[53:37] So, but jaws is the one that Kineata picked as the best layout in Pimbal.

[53:44] The best pin in front of Window.

[53:47] So I know this is when I snuck in here.

[53:51] And as I look at my guns and roses, which you can see, it's not in front of the window.

[53:57] You can see it here.

[53:58] There's a gap.

[53:59] There's a gap.

[54:00] I mean, I will die on that gap, people.

[54:03] I will die on that gap.

[54:07] Trust me, it kills me.

[54:08] There's nowhere else I can put my guns and roses in this room.

[54:12] I knew exactly the hate I'd get when people saw that.

[54:18] So let's look at the winner for this.

[54:26] Melvin, your name is, the fonts have messed it up a little bit, but Melvin Williams,

[54:31] I mean, he's not even trying here.

[54:34] He's got a retro atomic zombie adventure land from deep route smack dab right in front

[54:44] of a window.

[54:45] I mean, this thing is not even, it's not even in front of a window.

[54:48] It's also covering a doorway.

[54:49] I mean, this is the double whammy of where you don't put a pinball machine and it looks

[54:53] like he's got stuff stacked underneath it as well.

[54:56] So I've talked to Melvin about this game.

[55:00] And apparently he's made some changes.

[55:01] He fixed the ramp on the game.

[55:04] He says it plays well.

[55:06] So yeah, this is the worst pin.

[55:11] Maybe the worst pin in front of a window.

[55:14] You know, we get it.

[55:17] He closed the mines.

[55:18] All right, Melvin's a good friend.

[55:19] So he'll get a kick out of this.

[55:23] Game of the year.

[55:25] Game of the year.

[55:27] I mean, have you picked up the theme gang?

[55:33] I want to say like evil dead who that has won a bunch of awards.

[55:38] Really, no one's played it.

[55:41] So it's obviously not going to win here, but name here is not an indictment of the game.

[55:47] I think now is a good time to talk about what the best purchase of the year was.

[55:52] And that was easily Metallica remastered Ellie.

[55:56] If you got your hands on one of those Metallica Ellie's, you easily saw your game go up $5,000.

[56:05] Maybe more now.

[56:07] You know, it's just the truth is every other game here, a significant loss in value across

[56:14] the board on every single title.

[56:16] You know how I feel about modern pinball pricing.

[56:18] I don't think these products are worth where the pricing is.

[56:23] So as we think about game of the year and what is arguably one of the most lackluster

[56:29] years in pinball since I've been covering the hobby, the easy winner here is is is jaws

[56:38] and Keith Ellie.

[56:39] And I think it's it's easily a game that, you know, I it's so hard for me to sort of disconnect

[56:53] the pricing for what the game is.

[56:55] And I don't think jaws is better than Godzilla.

[56:59] But I think it's a really good game.

[57:03] I don't think it's like a masterpiece, but it's a really good game.

[57:08] I think the assets were we are all shocked at the amount of assets they got.

[57:15] Roy Scheider and all this stuff in the game.

[57:18] You know, it's there's enough there to really love about this game and the code in this

[57:22] game is absolutely phenomenal.

[57:26] But the thing is is that this is the best game of the year.

[57:30] And I don't think you could pick another game that's better than this.

[57:36] And look for those saying like it's not better than Metallica.

[57:39] I'm sorry, but I just have a problem giving a game that was made 12 years ago, but a

[57:49] coder who's no longer with us.

[57:51] And you know, I I don't think Metallica should win game of the year when it is a remastered

[57:57] of a 12 year old.

[57:58] Sorry.

[57:59] I just don't think that's like giving like if they re release Star Wars for an anniversary,

[58:07] giving it best movie of the year.

[58:09] It doesn't work like that.

[58:12] You can't you can't I think we need to award games that were released for the first time

[58:20] in that fiscal year and not a remastered game.

[58:25] Okay.

[58:26] So that's that was my criteria.

[58:29] Now look gang.

[58:31] I think I wanted to sort of look at some of the rumored games.

[58:38] You know, we're hearing about in 2025.

[58:43] And I want to really, really like I think this year is pivotal.

[58:49] I think it is paramount that these companies stop with the nonsense.

[58:55] Like just stop.

[58:56] Stop doing no market research.

[58:59] Stop bringing out themes that we don't really want.

[59:03] Stop charging so much money.

[59:04] You know what we want.

[59:07] You know how to make it.

[59:08] And you know how to put the magic in.

[59:10] Now do it.

[59:12] And I think a lot of us are at a point now where we're just tired of feeling like it's

[59:18] or you know, everything's around the corner.

[59:20] It's not a not it's not good enough anymore.

[59:23] Because all my friends are losing so much money in the here and now who just buy all these

[59:26] games in 2024 or 2023.

[59:28] It's just not enough.

[59:32] You know, you're not seeing back to the future on here people.

[59:35] Because you know, unless Dutch inks a deal with Stern to make back to the future, you're

[59:43] not going to see back to the future in 2025 people.

[59:47] If Dutch designs it and releases it on its own, it's you might they might review they

[59:52] might tease it in 2025.

[59:55] But you're not going to see it.

[59:56] I mean, they're not even going to be able to make all the alluses barely make all the

[01:00:00] alluses by the end of 2025.

[01:00:03] So you know, I think there's a lot happening in Pimbal and I think a lot is coming.

[01:00:13] And when I look at this list of games, I really do get excited by a lot more of what's up

[01:00:17] here than what we saw last year.

[01:00:21] So that is exciting.

[01:00:24] And as I think about creating Pimbal content in 2025, I'm a lot more excited to be making

[01:00:30] shows and doing weekly podcasts about Pimbal when I look at these kinds of themes.

[01:00:37] And the last thing I'll ask from each and every one of you, if you could please vote for

[01:00:40] a Canadian Pimbal podcast in the upcoming Twippies, which is happening.

[01:00:46] I think January 2nd or 3rd when it opens up, I'm going to stop screen sharing and get

[01:00:52] back to each and every one of you.

[01:00:55] It was a lot of fun.

[01:00:56] I'm very happy for the technical difficulties in getting this show going today.

[01:01:01] As you see, I need it to share with you the PowerPoint, all the work I put into that.

[01:01:08] I'm glad to see that there was disagreement on some of the stuff that's good.

[01:01:12] I think all of this is subjective.

[01:01:16] I think that that's what makes this hobby a lot of fun.

[01:01:20] And you look at other hobbies, ladies and gentlemen, like imagine trying to collect watches.

[01:01:26] There's hundreds of watches that come out a year.

[01:01:28] You can't really get your arms around it.

[01:01:31] There's so many cars that come out a year.

[01:01:33] There's so many bottles of wine.

[01:01:35] There's so much that happens in the video game space.

[01:01:38] But in Pimbal, as much as so many of them miss the mark, there's only 14 things you

[01:01:44] need to know about.

[01:01:46] And that's not a lot.

[01:01:48] And the way they're spaced out is easy for us to sort of absorb and deconstruct and

[01:01:54] discuss each new game when it comes out.

[01:01:58] So I think hopefully you enjoy the 2024 Canadian kudos.

[01:02:03] We will see how stuff sinks up with the trippies that opens, as Colin is saying, January

[01:02:08] 3rd.

[01:02:10] And I think it's going to be a good next year in Pimbal.

[01:02:14] I think a lot of us are going to be happy to get past this year.

[01:02:20] I do.

[01:02:21] I think a lot of what we've been sort of surviving is the right word.

[01:02:29] It's just these crazy prices and a lot of uninspired themes and uninspired games.

[01:02:37] And I think the only way to get back to the magic is if people just stop buying and just

[01:02:44] demand more.

[01:02:46] And I don't think that's being negative.

[01:02:47] I don't think that's a...

[01:02:50] I don't think that's a bad position to be in.

[01:02:54] And in a way, we all control the destiny of this hobby.

[01:02:59] If our expectations and what we demand from these manufacturers, we have the ability to

[01:03:08] control that.

[01:03:10] And I'm glad to see that this hobby has woken up.

[01:03:14] Abbott's sales are not good.

[01:03:16] John Wick's sales were abysmal.

[01:03:19] We're not seeing great sales with Elton John.

[01:03:21] We're not seeing great sales with X-Men right now.

[01:03:24] We've seen poor sales in a lot of these games.

[01:03:28] Is Abba selling well?

[01:03:29] I don't know.

[01:03:30] Probably not.

[01:03:31] Funhouse remake.

[01:03:32] You go on Pinside.

[01:03:33] There's only two pages of the Funhouse remake owners club.

[01:03:36] I think a lot of people are just sort of keeping their money reserved for when they see

[01:03:43] something that deserves your money.

[01:03:46] Reserve your money until something deserves your money.

[01:03:48] I think that's another good Canadian phrase I could start to put out there in the pinball

[01:03:52] community.

[01:03:54] But we started a little late, so I'll stay on here.

[01:03:59] I think we're going to see Dungeons and Dragons.

[01:04:02] And I think the hope for D&D that I have is the same hope each and everybody has.

[01:04:08] Each and everyone has.

[01:04:09] It's that it's a sequel to Medieval Madness kind of.

[01:04:12] That it's going to give us that those vibes of Medieval Madness has some crazy awesome

[01:04:17] mechanisms in it.

[01:04:19] And just the can't be fun of Medieval Madness.

[01:04:21] I think that is what everybody is hoping to get in Brian Eddie's Dungeons and Dragons.

[01:04:29] Elton John is still perhaps the herdeous pin of all says angry Alpaca.

[01:04:34] I think that's orbiter Albert.

[01:04:36] No, Elton John is not the prettiest game.

[01:04:39] It's a nice game for sure.

[01:04:41] But Elton flying off the piano with his butt in the air to me is not what most 40 to

[01:04:47] six-year-old men want to look at when they walk into their game room.

[01:04:52] Hey, Canadian, get some UV film on that one.

[01:04:53] I do have UV film on the window.

[01:04:56] You guys always say this, like you're like, you're going to UV.

[01:04:59] Do you understand that you can get clear UV film?

[01:05:03] There is UV film on that window on these windows in front of me.

[01:05:07] It's clear.

[01:05:08] All right, it blocks 99% of UV rays.

[01:05:11] So I'm not going to fade the cabinet on my guns and roses.

[01:05:15] Is Canada on the list for Super Mario Ellie?

[01:05:19] No.

[01:05:20] I don't know if that game is for sure or not.

[01:05:25] All right, we won't know if D&D will give us that for at least two years in the code

[01:05:30] is done.

[01:05:31] It's not going to take two years for D&D code to be done.

[01:05:33] I don't think Dwight takes that long.

[01:05:36] This Saturday morning deserves the best spectacular of the year award.

[01:05:39] Well, thank you, Eric.

[01:05:40] I appreciate it.

[01:05:43] I'm going to have to rip the audio for the Patreon subscribers.

[01:05:47] I will say, I don't know.

[01:05:50] I keep going back and forth.

[01:05:51] I like YouTube.

[01:05:52] It gives you a better video, better chat.

[01:05:56] But I do.

[01:05:57] Yeah, I don't make any money here.

[01:05:59] I made money on Facebook.

[01:06:01] Facebook stars was fun.

[01:06:02] There's nothing happened.

[01:06:03] No, I don't even.

[01:06:05] I think I got to have a certain number of videos or views or subscribers before people

[01:06:09] can even send money via this.

[01:06:11] I don't know if I have to turn it on somehow.

[01:06:15] I think that, look, in two weeks D&D is going to be out.

[01:06:22] We're going to start to get some evil deads on the line soon.

[01:06:26] Alice's adventures in Wonderland will be hopefully on the line in January.

[01:06:31] Is Canada buying evil dead raffle tickets?

[01:06:37] How much are the raffle tickets for evil dead?

[01:06:40] 100 bucks?

[01:06:43] Let me know how much they are.

[01:06:44] I probably should buy one, right?

[01:06:47] I'm kind of like, I went a little.

[01:06:50] We got a little boozy at lunch yesterday.

[01:06:53] And I may have walked into Tiffany's with Brenda.

[01:06:58] And I may have bought.

[01:06:59] They spent more than a Jersey Jack's CE on her in total yesterday.

[01:07:06] So you know, you sometimes have to pull back a little bit.

[01:07:12] You're spending when you spoil your wife, but it's a lot of fun.

[01:07:15] She looks amazing.

[01:07:16] The diamonds on her wrist look incredible.

[01:07:20] So that happened.

[01:07:23] Can't tax deduct that from my pinball Patreon money.

[01:07:29] People put a link in the chat here to the raffle.

[01:07:36] OK, so one ticket is 120.

[01:07:39] Two is 240.

[01:07:42] And three, that doesn't make it.

[01:07:43] Well, there's no deal if you buy three.

[01:07:47] Like I don't say it.

[01:07:48] Like, of course, that's just that would.

[01:07:51] Those numbers are funny because like, well, yeah, that's just 120 times one, two, and three.

[01:08:00] No, not in the doghouse at all.

[01:08:01] Like it just just kind of felt like spoiling my beautiful wife who does more, more for this

[01:08:07] family than anything.

[01:08:08] This is I feel very blessed.

[01:08:11] Brenda's sister is joining us for a little over a week today.

[01:08:16] It's been such a good holiday.

[01:08:17] I mean, just such a good mood.

[01:08:19] And the kids have had such a great holiday.

[01:08:23] And everyone is just in a really great mood in this household.

[01:08:29] And we have a lot more to be thankful for than anything else.

[01:08:32] And I think that is why you know, when you have like a couple of espresso martinis and

[01:08:39] you know, we walk into a jewelry store, it's a, you know, it's a dangerous time.

[01:08:43] It's a dangerous time.

[01:08:47] But yeah, I do that every once in a while.

[01:08:50] Like not, I don't do it as often as Bill Brennus can do it.

[01:08:53] But you know, sometimes it's like, all right, like, you know, let me spend here.

[01:08:58] I'll hold back a little bit over here.

[01:09:00] And we sold the apartment in New York City.

[01:09:02] So that's going to help out with our mortgage.

[01:09:04] And, you know, daycare is a disaster, 6,000 a month.

[01:09:09] So that's always fun.

[01:09:11] Yeah, well, probably shouldn't have done what I did.

[01:09:14] But again, probably shouldn't, we've, none of us should probably have bought pinball machines

[01:09:19] over the last 10 years.

[01:09:20] I was looking at what Bitcoin was 10 years ago, gang, it'll, it'll make you cry.

[01:09:25] It'll make you cry.

[01:09:27] If we all bought Bitcoin instead of pinball machines 10 years ago, you absolutely, like,

[01:09:31] we wouldn't, we'd be having this conversation on Mars.

[01:09:34] Yeah, but you know what, you know, there's something to be said about the experience of, like,

[01:09:41] walking into a Tiffany's and buying, and their quality is really good.

[01:09:46] And there's something to be said for that.

[01:09:48] I do believe that.

[01:09:50] Like, you're having a glass of champagne and, you know, you're, you, you, you have a moment

[01:09:55] there.

[01:09:56] You just get it from a host seller and it's not the same.

[01:10:01] I mean, I think sometimes remembering the day that that thing was put on you or on your

[01:10:08] wrist or on your neck and, and the lunch you had and the, you know, the, that's, to me,

[01:10:15] that's, that needs to be part of a day like that.

[01:10:18] And again, like, it's not, it's not just about the money, it's about the experience.

[01:10:24] Um, D&D, neckbeard, SLE, uh, okay, whatever.

[01:10:29] I, I, I don't know.

[01:10:33] Why does the chat here suck justice?

[01:10:35] I don't get it.

[01:10:36] It's the same that this chat doesn't scroll over the footage like Facebook.

[01:10:41] I think it's easier to read the chat here.

[01:10:43] What do you guys think?

[01:10:44] I think the chat on Facebook is harder to follow.

[01:10:48] Oh, man.

[01:10:55] Well, the thing about jewelry too, gang, is you buy something that you love and you hold

[01:11:04] on to it.

[01:11:05] You don't resell it.

[01:11:06] Like it's, you know, the Facebook chat is better.

[01:11:11] Hmm.

[01:11:12] I prefer YouTube.

[01:11:15] I love it.

[01:11:18] I look, gang, I'm, I'm super happy with the Patreon support that Canadian pinball podcast

[01:11:24] has.

[01:11:25] Um, you know, I, I don't want to do superfluous efforts.

[01:11:31] And I will say this like Facebook is fun when you just want like nonstop attention because

[01:11:37] it's so easy to just, just keep spamming Facebook, spam with lives, spam, you know, it's

[01:11:44] like it, it, they've made it the easiest to just be like low level lift for attention.

[01:11:53] But I still prefer doing the podcast.

[01:11:56] I still prefer the Patreon subscribers getting rewarded with the best pinball podcast out

[01:12:03] there.

[01:12:05] It is, it is.

[01:12:06] You guys know this.

[01:12:07] You know it.

[01:12:08] I mean, like 720 something people can't be wrong.

[01:12:12] It's great.

[01:12:13] You know, and we've had more people up the Annie and raise their subscription prices over

[01:12:18] the last few months, which is nice.

[01:12:21] So even though we've lost like, I think at the height, I had 750 subscribers, but we're

[01:12:27] actually, I'm making more now with 724 than I did with 750, you know, a few dudes that

[01:12:34] go from five to 30, a race, uh, the, you know, the 20 or 30 people that have left.

[01:12:40] Yes, hopefully, Ben is very happy.

[01:12:42] I mean, it's, I'm, I'm, I'm not going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to

[01:12:43] say, you know, being a parent gang, it's exhausting.

[01:12:46] It's exhausting and the weekends are exhausting and the holidays can be exhausting.

[01:12:50] Like yesterday, daycare was open from nine to four.

[01:12:54] Nobody told me.

[01:12:56] And I showed up at eight o'clock and, uh, had to bring the kids back home and back there

[01:13:01] again.

[01:13:02] But they're so worth it.

[01:13:04] I mean, this, when you see how excited a child gets around the holidays and killian

[01:13:10] just wanted pop patrol and wanted this robo dog and we got him this little power wheels,

[01:13:16] a big power wheels monster truck from he, Kole is the company that makes these, these

[01:13:21] like 24 volt things amazing.

[01:13:23] Um, it has like Bluetooth that plays like pop patrol music.

[01:13:27] It's a little loud though.

[01:13:28] Like when the things go and you can't hear the Bluetooth, but absolutely incredible watching

[01:13:33] the holidays through the eyes of a, of a three and a half year old boy reminds me of

[01:13:39] everything we're chasing in this hobby.

[01:13:41] And I've said this before, like we are chasing that feeling gang.

[01:13:44] We're all, we're all getting older.

[01:13:45] We're not getting any younger.

[01:13:47] Life gets more stressful as you get older.

[01:13:50] I think we all start to see the world so differently, especially when you have children and,

[01:13:57] and most of you know this and, and then you realize like how short life is and how few

[01:14:02] days there are to wake up in a good mood, have peace of mind and to bring joy to those

[01:14:09] who really need it the most.

[01:14:12] And I think about it too, especially during the holidays, the amount of children that really

[01:14:18] don't have any gifts under the tree and we probably next year should do some fun raising

[01:14:26] to get, to get more gifts into you know children's hands versus huge gifts for us.

[01:14:34] Like and I mean this and I don't know it should, it should really be a season where we think

[01:14:38] about giving as much as getting.

[01:14:39] I mean that.

[01:14:40] But man, life is short.

[01:14:44] You know, I'm lucky to have both of my parents still here, Brenda has her parents still here,

[01:14:49] all of our siblings are still here.

[01:14:52] It doesn't mean there's no drama in the family world, but we're all still here.

[01:14:58] Happy to still be employed.

[01:15:00] You know, as you get older, it's hard, you know.

[01:15:04] One unfortunate thing about corporate America these days is the lack of loyalty just across

[01:15:10] the board.

[01:15:11] I go on LinkedIn every day and I just see so many extremely talented people that just

[01:15:17] get cut loose, you know, in their 40s and 50s and then they can't find anything and they've

[01:15:23] got 20, 30 years of experience and and knows them and they hire all these young kids who don't

[01:15:31] even want to be there.

[01:15:33] Hegeism is a real thing and it's difficult.

[01:15:36] It makes it hard to plan.

[01:15:38] My father was, I mean he worked for 37 years for one company.

[01:15:42] I mean he was basically forced into early retirement.

[01:15:46] Guess what age my dad retired at and he's been retired since he never took another job

[01:15:51] because it kind of like depressed him like he to give 37 years to one company and then

[01:15:57] because there was leadership change, they sort of pushed you aside.

[01:16:02] He got kind of forced into early retirement when he was just 55 years old.

[01:16:07] I mean 55.

[01:16:09] I mean luckily my dad is very, very conservative with his money and and and never was a spend

[01:16:17] thrift.

[01:16:18] He never went to Gucci.

[01:16:20] He never bought expensive watches.

[01:16:23] He never bought beach houses.

[01:16:25] He never bought any.

[01:16:27] My dad never buys anything like to flex and if you met, if you meet my dad, he's the opposite

[01:16:34] of me.

[01:16:35] He's like, he's like, he's like, who had like a good career, like a much better career

[01:16:38] than me.

[01:16:39] He's very humble.

[01:16:40] He's very nice.

[01:16:41] He will never make you feel small or try to flex on you or try to show off or do anything

[01:16:47] like that.

[01:16:48] He's just a really nice guy.

[01:16:49] You know, he asked me once.

[01:16:50] He's like, he's like, he's like, should I get into watches?

[01:16:53] Cause he was looking for something just to get into.

[01:16:55] I was like, absolutely not.

[01:16:57] Absolutely not dad.

[01:16:58] Do not do not go down a rabbit hole of like something you put on your wrist that you're

[01:17:06] going to just chase this like weird flex.

[01:17:12] It's all flexing watches.

[01:17:13] If you ever got like a watch show, it is the lamest thing you could ever go to.

[01:17:18] Like it's just all dudes.

[01:17:19] Like no women.

[01:17:20] It's all dudes just like this.

[01:17:22] Like the whole like the whole play like they're just like, you know, it's like like

[01:17:26] at least with pinball like we can play the game and talk about the the gameplay and the

[01:17:31] art and the modes and like it does an experience.

[01:17:34] There's no experience.

[01:17:35] Once you put a watch on your wrist, you're still the same jackass before and after.

[01:17:41] It just signifies how much money you have.

[01:17:44] Franchi, I went down the action figure road for a long time with Transformers.

[01:17:48] The hell out of fun.

[01:17:51] You know with these little kids, it would just never would work.

[01:17:54] They would rip open those boxes and be playing with them when I went to work.

[01:17:57] So I'm kind of like, you know, much more of a minimalist.

[01:18:03] I love my little Toyota more than I do my Dodge Demon.

[01:18:08] And I, because it's just more fun to drive.

[01:18:12] And I tell you everywhere, I take that little Toyota with the Fuji Mara tofu shop on the

[01:18:17] side.

[01:18:18] And you get so many thumbs up and people love it.

[01:18:20] You know, why?

[01:18:21] Because it's the kind of car where like it disarms people.

[01:18:25] It makes them happy.

[01:18:26] It telegraphs that you all you care about is the joy of driving.

[01:18:33] And there's a beauty in that.

[01:18:35] You know, it's not this, you know, these guys in these towns, these eye bankers who show

[01:18:40] up to cars and coffees with like $300,000 like Porsche GT3 RS is, you know, they've never

[01:18:46] taken it to a track and they just, that's great.

[01:18:49] Like, and they're nervous.

[01:18:50] They're nervous about the miles.

[01:18:52] They're nervous about the rims.

[01:18:53] They're nervous about like anything happening to it.

[01:18:55] Like, I don't know.

[01:18:56] I already backed up my Toyota into the garage door and I had to repaint the rear bumper.

[01:19:01] Like it, you know, it cost me like 400 bucks.

[01:19:03] I don't care.

[01:19:04] You get a whole new bumper for like $800.

[01:19:06] You hit the rear bumper of a Porsche.

[01:19:08] You're talking like, shoot like $8,000.

[01:19:14] So yeah, have you tracked your car?

[01:19:16] I haven't tracked it yet, Carl.

[01:19:18] I don't have any time to do anything like to be completely honest with each and every one

[01:19:23] of you.

[01:19:24] I don't have time to do too much of that like extra curricular outside the house activities.

[01:19:31] You know, when you have young kids and you have daycare, it's a weird thing.

[01:19:36] Like, the only time you have to yourself is when your kids are in daycare and then you're

[01:19:42] working.

[01:19:44] So it's like, I'm excited to go into the office.

[01:19:47] Like, I'm excited to go to work and have a nice lunch in New York City because I'm like,

[01:19:51] I don't have to like, you know, do the, do the parent to stuff for a little bit.

[01:19:58] But that being said, I mean, I absolutely just love my children to death and the, and the

[01:20:04] blessing we feel, I think most of you know this, but we had a really terrible complication

[01:20:10] with our second pregnancy that we had, we had the early terminate our child.

[01:20:17] Kean Kean is his name and it's just, it devastated us and to have baby Cassian, little chubby

[01:20:28] fat man, healthy and happy and developing normally, it is everything to us.

[01:20:36] And you know, I say that because each and every one of us has has our own trauma and our

[01:20:42] own issues and our own, you know, things that we're suffering through and I think that's

[01:20:46] why I love this hobby.

[01:20:47] I mean, this, this hobby brings so many of us together in so many unique ways.

[01:20:51] And I think debating these games and celebrating them and making fun of them, I think it's healthy.

[01:20:57] I think it's healthy.

[01:20:58] I think giving an extraordinary amount of value to something as trivial as a pinball machine

[01:21:05] is a really healthy way to wake up in a good mood every day.

[01:21:10] I mean that.

[01:21:12] Happy New Year's to you as well, Nick.

[01:21:14] Pinball vibes only.

[01:21:16] Guys, I really do.

[01:21:18] I really, you know what sucks is like the only thing that I hate about the holidays, it should,

[01:21:23] the NFL playoffs should be happening now.

[01:21:26] Like why are the NFL playoffs?

[01:21:28] Like these two extra weeks are annoying.

[01:21:32] College football sucks.

[01:21:33] I mean it.

[01:21:34] College football, there's no defense.

[01:21:36] It's like the worst game.

[01:21:37] I, I try to understand the defense in college football and then I watch these games and the

[01:21:44] crowds are the best.

[01:21:46] The energy is the best in college football, but the game itself is just terrible.

[01:21:51] Like it's terrible.

[01:21:52] It's like so easy to like for the Cubes to scramble.

[01:21:56] There's no defense anywhere to be found on the field.

[01:21:59] I don't understand.

[01:22:01] I don't understand they can't shut down offenses in college.

[01:22:05] Anyway, can we see the making of the feature of your kids?

[01:22:11] Yeah.

[01:22:12] Yeah, I mean it's, I hear him downstairs.

[01:22:18] He's got all of his Paw Patrol toys from Christmas and he's going nuts.

[01:22:21] All right, everybody look, we've now done 90 minutes of this.

[01:22:26] The first four were kind of brutal, but I hope you enjoyed that.
