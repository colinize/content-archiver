[00:00] I get that more people listen to your podcasts and most others, but it's because A, you're

[00:08] usually right, not always, quite frankly.

[00:11] You know, like he's right less often than most podcasts, but he's entertaining.

[00:15] And his pace and his cadence of speaking for a solo pimp up podcast is incredible.

[00:20] And I'll keep listening if he puts out more episodes, but I listen with a grain of salt.

[00:25] Like when I step in front of an actologist, do I think that's the ugliest machine

[00:29] ever made?

[00:30] Hell no.

[00:31] It's actually not a bad looking game.

[00:33] You know, he's listed on this week in Pimble is being a Pimble promoter, but if you think

[00:39] about it, is he really?

[00:41] I would say most episodes, he's making Pimble sound bad.

[00:45] And Caddy, he's bringing up the negative parts of Pimble.

[00:48] It's like, you know what, if Canada comes back, like I said before, we started recording,

[00:53] he is the Darth Vader of Pimble podcasting with Pimble media.

[00:58] You don't even own a Pimble engine.

[00:59] I'm not sure if he was passion for Pimble engine.

[01:05] Welcome to episode 484 of Canada's Pimble podcast.

[01:12] I am your father, other Pimble podcast.

[01:15] I love it.

[01:16] I love it.

[01:17] You go away for a few weeks.

[01:18] Everyone's got to start talking smack about the world's number one Pimble podcast, but

[01:21] that's what happens.

[01:23] That's what happens.

[01:24] So everyone, we have some news in the Pimble world.

[01:27] So let's do a little episode of Canada's Pimble podcast and we'll prove to the world

[01:30] that you don't need over an hour lately.

[01:33] Have you noticed this new trend in the Pimble podcasting world?

[01:36] Is everyone asked to talk for over an hour?

[01:39] And there's no news?

[01:41] It's unbelievable.

[01:42] And they say that I'm the one who likes to hear myself talk.

[01:44] So what are we going to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pimble podcast?

[01:48] There's a new hire over at Stern Pimble.

[01:51] They put out a press release.

[01:52] We're going to talk about that.

[01:54] Stern Pimble has turned the factory back on.

[01:58] We're going to talk about that.

[01:59] There's one factory that should be turning on right now and I'm not hearing anything

[02:04] and we're going to talk about that.

[02:06] And then there's also a little bit of a mistake that happened over at Jersey Jack Pimble,

[02:11] which is really, really funny.

[02:13] We're going to talk about a Wizard of Oz limited edition mistake that has some people

[02:19] debating whether or not Jersey Jack has pulled a fast one.

[02:24] In the world of limited edition games.

[02:27] So how's that sound for a little episode of Canada's Pimble podcast, the return of

[02:31] the evil Pimble podcaster?

[02:34] So Stern put out a press release dated yesterday, May 18th at Stern Pimble, a global lifestyle

[02:39] brand based on the iconic and outrageously fun modern American game of Pimble announced

[02:45] today, the appointment of Raymond Davidson as game development software engineer.

[02:52] And then they go on to talk about how Raymond most recently worked at Amazon, Ripple and

[02:57] Smile Box.

[02:59] And in addition to his professional engineering accomplishments, Raymond is passionately

[03:04] Pimble and enthusiast and a world class player.

[03:07] He is currently ranked number one in the competitive Pimble player space.

[03:13] And George Gomez had this to say, Raymond's Pimble IQ is off the charts, which is clearly

[03:19] why he's currently ranked number one in the world.

[03:22] We are very excited to add his talents to our studio as we continue to grow our unique

[03:28] lifestyle entertainment brand and produce the most fun Pimble machines on the planet

[03:33] said Gomez.

[03:34] So here's the thing, I love that Stern is now embracing the joke.

[03:39] They know what they're doing when they call it a lifestyle brand and these press releases.

[03:43] They know that the only people who read a Pimble press release think about it.

[03:47] A press release is meant to go out to media.

[03:51] There really is no Pimble media other than us, the podcasts and the websites.

[03:55] Who's recovering this stuff?

[03:57] Nobody's covering this stuff.

[03:58] Do you think IGN's writing about Raymond joining Stern Pimble?

[04:01] Nobody cares.

[04:03] And that is why they're using this inflated language about ragesley fun and iconic machine.

[04:09] They know that they're just taking the piss out of us.

[04:12] And I find it funny.

[04:13] And I think those of you out there are missing some of the sarcasm right now.

[04:17] They're in on the joke.

[04:18] Okay, so what do we think about Raymond joining Stern Pimble as a coder and being the world's

[04:24] number one ranked player?

[04:26] What does that mean?

[04:27] To have coding skills and to be a great Pimble player is a great combination.

[04:33] And just on a surface level, I think you look at this higher as a good thing happening

[04:39] over at Stern Pimble.

[04:40] But I think there's one major caveat when it comes to coding.

[04:44] And I think it's something that means the most.

[04:47] And I want to explain what I mean right now.

[04:49] It doesn't matter how good at Pimble you are.

[04:53] It doesn't matter if you're the number one ranked player.

[04:56] It doesn't matter how good at coding you are either.

[05:00] Because what matters in Pimble coding, for Pimble coding to be magical, to be meaningful,

[05:06] to be impactful, you have to code in moments in the Pimble experience that are fun, that

[05:13] are memorable, that are long lasting with the player.

[05:17] And I'm here to tell you right now that you can't teach that skill set.

[05:22] You either have it or you don't.

[05:24] And some coders just have it.

[05:26] Like Lyman Sheets is a great example of a man who's a competitive Pimble player, but

[05:31] he also understands what makes code so rewarding for the player.

[05:37] And that is why Lyman Sheets games are so coveted and so highly praised by the community.

[05:44] It's not that he has so many hours on a machine.

[05:46] It's not that he understands coding.

[05:49] It's that he understands how to make a game rewarding.

[05:52] And you can't teach that.

[05:53] You can't teach that.

[05:54] Another person who has that special skill set is Keith L. Win.

[05:58] He's a great player competitively, but he also knows the rules set and how he wants the

[06:04] player to journey through a game.

[06:06] And I think when people play Keith L. Win games, it's like when coding is done right, you're

[06:11] just enjoying the game.

[06:13] And I think the best way to describe it is you kind of just get lost in the game.

[06:18] You're lost in the experience.

[06:19] It's like being in a movie theater and it's that moment in which you forget that you're

[06:23] actually in a movie theater.

[06:25] You're just enjoying the journey.

[06:27] And I think that's what the best Pimble coders do.

[06:31] But I just don't think one plus one always equals two in the world of coding.

[06:35] It's like when I heard that Steve Bowden was joining deep-rooted Pimble to code Raza.

[06:40] Everyone's like, this is amazing, this is incredible news.

[06:43] And I was like, yeah, like it's Steve's a great player.

[06:46] But what experience does Steve have coding a game?

[06:50] And as Steve ever coded a game that's made people say, wow, right?

[06:55] It's his first game.

[06:56] So we don't know.

[06:57] I mean, we're going to find out if Steve Bowden has that magical quality to code a game

[07:03] that's memorable, that makes people feel something.

[07:06] And that again, that's just something that you can't teach.

[07:09] Bowden Karrons over at Spooky Pimble.

[07:12] It's like great having these tournament guys on the rules set.

[07:15] But I'm here to tell you this.

[07:16] I'm here to tell you this.

[07:17] The best tournament players in the world.

[07:20] They don't care about how fun a game is.

[07:25] They don't care about the magical moments in Pimble.

[07:29] To them, that doesn't mean anything.

[07:32] A tournament player's objective is to find a pathway to points.

[07:38] Like scoring is everything to them.

[07:41] They're not about the moments.

[07:42] They're not about the light shows.

[07:44] They're not about all that stuff that makes the rest of us all giddy and excited to get

[07:50] to a mode.

[07:52] So for example, if you take a mode like they're in back again in Lord of the Rings, a mode

[07:57] in which players love.

[07:59] But imagine if that mode doesn't have the best scoring elements, then a tournament player

[08:04] is not trying to get to that mode.

[08:07] I think the best Pimble coders in the world, they do two things.

[08:12] They understand how to marry getting to those iconic moments in the game with getting high

[08:20] points.

[08:21] To me, that should always be how Pimble coding is approached.

[08:25] The stuff that's the most rewarding to see is also rewarding you with the most points.

[08:31] Doesn't that only make natural sense?

[08:34] At the moment in which you destroy the ring and Lord of the Rings, should be a big point

[08:38] moment in the game.

[08:40] Versus some of these newer approaches where there's all these multipliers, kind of like

[08:44] the way Dwight did Star Wars, it's like you chase after the multipliers versus trying

[08:50] to blow up the Death Star.

[08:51] Like shouldn't blowing up the Death Star be worth a billion points or like 10 billion

[08:56] points?

[08:57] And I don't care how hard you make that goal, right?

[08:59] I'd rather watch people struggle to blow up the Death Star and get 10 billion points

[09:05] versus always trying to go to the multiplier route to get those points.

[09:09] So we'll see how Raymond does at Stern Pimble, not sure what game he's working on, and

[09:15] the fact that he's joining Stern today or yesterday, we probably won't see his efforts on a

[09:21] game until 2021.

[09:24] But I will say it's a great hire.

[09:25] I always like to see Stern staff up with more people in the coding department because

[09:31] they could use a little bit more coding prowess if you ask me, all right?

[09:36] What else is going on?

[09:37] So Stern Pimble is back in the office to a limited capacity.

[09:41] So I heard yesterday from someone who works there that there are people back in the office.

[09:45] Now it's going to be limited and I'm not sure if that means the production has turned

[09:49] back on, but it looks like it has.

[09:52] And that means that we will most likely, I think, see a Stern game sometime in June.

[09:58] I'm not sure when, but sometime in June.

[10:00] And it probably will be the same order of games, which is heavy metal, and then we will

[10:06] see Ninja Turtles.

[10:08] Now heavy metal was ready to go.

[10:09] They even had the launch date back in March, but they moved it.

[10:13] And Ninja Turtles was also ready for early April.

[10:16] So I fully expect to see both of these games in a short window of each other.

[10:22] Now Ninja Turtles, here's what we know so far.

[10:25] It's Dwight on code, Zambi Eddie on artwork, and John Borg on design.

[10:31] Okay, those are the, that's like the trifecta team they've put together for Ninja Turtles.

[10:36] The debate still rages on on whether or not Ninja Turtles is a title that adults are excited

[10:42] to play and get and put in their game room.

[10:46] And I've heard from many people that they're like, you know what, it's just too juvenile

[10:49] for me.

[10:50] I've heard from other people that say they're just too old and they missed when Ninja Turtles

[10:54] was popular.

[10:55] And I do understand that.

[10:56] I mean, I feel like Ninja Turtles, the sweet spot for that franchise was like mid 80s

[11:01] to maybe early 90s.

[11:03] That is like that the window in which you had the movies, you had the cartoon series,

[11:09] you have the iconic four player video game or arcade game in our Cades.

[11:14] That arcade took up probably hundreds of dollars in quarters from me and my brother

[11:19] over the years, just playing it over and over again.

[11:22] I haven't really thought about Ninja Turtles very much since then.

[11:27] And I don't think a lot of grown men are clamoring to get a Ninja Turtles game.

[11:33] Now that being said, do I think it's a fun theme for pinball?

[11:37] Absolutely.

[11:38] But I can't escape the fact that one cartoon just came out that has R-rated cursing and

[11:44] swearing and is adult oriented like Rick and Morty and then Ninja Turtles, which is

[11:50] kind of juvenile cowabunga, dude.

[11:52] It's going to be very much a PG journey through the Ninja Turtles world, which is fine.

[11:58] But I just think the pinball buying demographic is more in tune with Rick and Morty just because

[12:05] of the adult nature of it, then they are with Ninja Turtles.

[12:08] Now that being said, I've heard that there are ramps and rails going up and down and

[12:14] below the play field and zombie 80s art packages out of this world and that Dwight on code,

[12:20] we're all praying.

[12:21] We're praying to the pinball gods that Dwight just finally figures out what people want

[12:27] in these games and doesn't do like some pinball math or make it to basic Dwight, please.

[12:35] Every time you think of doing something in this game, Dwight, just knock on Lyman's

[12:39] door and say, hey, Lyman, what would you do here?

[12:41] Lyman, how would you code this?

[12:42] Lyman, how would you...

[12:43] Please, just ask the other people there, Dwight, for some help on this game and don't mess

[12:48] it up.

[12:49] Please, please, please.

[12:50] But there's one major thing.

[12:52] And there's one major thing that would keep me from buying Ninja Turtles.

[12:56] And there's one major thing that I think Stern Pinball needs to figure out right now.

[13:00] And to me, it's the most important thing they need to figure out.

[13:03] You know, let me play a clip because I think this explains the number one issue that

[13:07] would keep me from buying a Stern Pinball machine new in box in 2020.

[13:11] And let's hear it from them first, what their take is on this.

[13:14] It's something that drives me crazy.

[13:16] All of us here at Stern, all of us have known Pinball for years, okay?

[13:20] For 50, 60 years, okay?

[13:22] Here it is.

[13:23] Ready?

[13:24] The subject of dimpling is ridiculous, okay?

[13:29] Everything happens on every single pinball machine ever made, whether it be made by Williams,

[13:35] Gottlieb, Stern, Valley, everybody that's ever made pinballs and used a wood play field,

[13:42] okay?

[13:43] We'll experience dimpling because the ball is harder than the wood.

[13:47] What people don't seem to understand is, oh my game, you know, it's all marked up.

[13:51] I can't stand it.

[13:52] Okay, if you want a game that isn't marked up, never play it.

[13:56] Just clean it.

[13:57] Turn on the lights.

[13:58] I admire it.

[13:59] Show it to your friends.

[14:00] Can we play it?

[14:01] No.

[14:02] That's actually not true, Mr. Steve Richie, because I'll tell you a game that has no dimples

[14:06] on it after hundreds of plays and that spooky pinball's Rick and Morty.

[14:11] So you answer me this one question, pinball people out there.

[14:14] How come spooky pinball is able to give you a machine with no dimples, a machine that

[14:20] looks like glass after a thousand plays with Rick and Morty, and yet Stern Pinball,

[14:25] their recent releases have looked horrible, have looked horrendous lately.

[14:31] Stranger Things is one of the most embarrassingly defective play field clear codes I've ever

[14:36] seen in pinball.

[14:37] And in this time off, in this time that Stern has had to listen to the feedback to hear

[14:42] from people, how can anyone out there actually open up their wallet and rush to buy a game

[14:49] unless they know that Stern has fixed this dimpling issue?

[14:53] I'm so tired of the apologists and I hear them being like it's not a big issue.

[14:58] Stranger Things looks horrible.

[15:00] Jurassic Park dimples really bad.

[15:03] Batman looks horrendous.

[15:05] When I sold my Batman 66 Super Ali, the buyer said the only reason I'm buying your game

[15:10] Chris is because it has a play field protector.

[15:12] So I'm not here to question whether or not dimpling happens on every game because I know

[15:17] that Steve Richie when he says that he's kind of lying.

[15:20] He's making up this notion that dimpling happens on every game.

[15:24] Now I will give him this.

[15:25] I will give him this.

[15:27] A few dimples forming on a game that's played a lot is that normal.

[15:32] I would agree that he is right there.

[15:34] We are not talking about a few dimples here and there in a game.

[15:39] We are talking about Stern Pinball's games of recent.

[15:43] They look like the cratered surface of a moon.

[15:47] It's not just one or two in an area where the ball is landing maybe because it bounces

[15:52] off of something or drops from a ramp or a wire form.

[15:55] We are talking about the entire play field gets cratered all over the place.

[16:00] It's cheap.

[16:02] It's not holding up.

[16:03] It looks like garbage over time.

[16:06] And so for $9,000, why is it that Stern Pinball with their L.E.s doesn't have a better system?

[16:12] I mean, people bought a $15,000 Elvira edition game that dimples like crazy.

[16:20] You think for $15,000 Stern would have sent those 50 play fields to Kruzman and had him

[16:27] do his magic with the play field and make sure that they're bulletproof?

[16:31] So that's my main thing with these Stern games is they've almost checked every single

[16:35] box to where you can buy with confidence.

[16:38] Now why can't they figure this out?

[16:40] And should I stop talking about it?

[16:42] Should it dimple gate something of the past?

[16:44] I don't think so.

[16:45] I just would not want to buy a modern day Stern machine, open it up, play it for like

[16:50] a weekend, look down on it, and it looks like garbage.

[16:54] And yet spooky pinball's Rick and Morty looks incredibly perfect after months of play.

[17:00] And I saw it at Jack Barn.

[17:01] It's like glass.

[17:03] There wasn't any dimples on the game.

[17:06] Not one.

[17:07] And we were next to a stranger thing that had less plays and it looked disastrously bad.

[17:12] So as a consumer, how do you deal with this?

[17:16] Do you not care?

[17:17] Now you could.

[17:18] Like you could absolutely not care and just think this is an OCD anal retentive way to

[17:23] look at the games or you could be like me and say, look, I want to buy your product,

[17:29] but I want you to have the best possible quality when I'm going to spend this kind of money

[17:35] on a game.

[17:36] And they just don't.

[17:37] They just don't.

[17:38] I'm telling you right now, spooky pinball's clear coat mixture is better than everyone else's.

[17:44] And I hear people already are saying like, well, my TNA was this or my Rob Zombie was this.

[17:50] I'm here to tell you right now that TNA had issues.

[17:54] Rob Zombie had issues and what did Charlie do?

[17:58] He went and he fixed the clear coat issue and they found a new solve so that Rick and

[18:05] Morty has their current solve for clear coats on pinball playfields.

[18:11] And let me tell you, it's as close to perfect as I've ever seen a pinball clear coat as of

[18:16] the last five years.

[18:18] And so why is Stern Pinball still confused about how to get these games to that level of quality?

[18:25] They are the biggest company in the world.

[18:27] They have the most engineers in the world.

[18:29] They have the brightest minds in pinball without a doubt.

[18:32] So how is a tiny company in Benton, Wisconsin schooling Stern Pinball on playfield quality?

[18:40] And I'm sorry, to me this is like one of the most important things because you just don't

[18:43] want to spend these prices and see your game look like crap so soon after unboxing it.

[18:50] And that's just something like as a buyer, that is one of the most important things I'm

[18:55] thinking about as I think about Ninja Turtles.

[18:57] Now here's my thing, stranger things was horrible.

[19:01] The quality of those playfields was so pissed poor, what makes us believe that Stern took

[19:06] this extra time to get the playfields for Turtles better.

[19:10] And it's such a shame they're going to have this beautiful zombie Eddie artwork and you're

[19:14] just going to watch the playfield crater immediately and I just think they are.

[19:18] And here's the thing about Stern, they'll never admit that they cut corners with playfield

[19:22] production.

[19:23] They'll never admit any of this.

[19:25] That's fine I get it, it's a business, but I wouldn't like to hear a Stern pinball

[19:29] sometime in the near future say that they've improved their clear coat and playfield process

[19:36] that they've made it so dimples and not even dimples just say this, this incisive cratering

[19:42] is a thing of the past.

[19:44] And that's just me, I just wouldn't want to buy these games that look like crap right

[19:47] away and you make up your mind on it.

[19:49] But man, I love what spooky is doing to the point where to the point where I'm just going

[19:54] to say this, if spooky pinball has this proprietary system in which they can make playfields

[20:00] this good and I'm Stern pinball and I've seen a couple things happen.

[20:05] I've seen spooky pinball fix one of our biggest headaches which is playfield quality.

[20:09] I've also seen spooky pinball sell out in four hours of Rick and Morty.

[20:14] Let me ask you a hypothetical question.

[20:16] Why does in Stern pinball look at buying spooky pinball?

[20:21] Why don't they look at absorbing this little boutique company that has a big fan base that

[20:26] has some really talented people and why don't they combine forces?

[20:30] Now I know Stern doesn't need them but maybe Stern needs access to some of that proprietary

[20:36] tech or process that Chuck is doing with the playfields.

[20:39] I mean that's why big companies buy smaller companies sometimes just to get access to proprietary

[20:46] or licensed materials or processes.

[20:49] So is it crazy to think that if spooky pinball has figured out one of Stern's biggest issues,

[20:55] they would buy them?

[20:56] Now here's the reason why they won't because Stern pinball won't even feel the impact

[21:00] of this because people will just run in by these games without even caring and that's

[21:05] your prerogative.

[21:06] I just don't want to own a game that looks like crap after one month of playing it and

[21:10] I'm sorry I had a lore of the rings in my apartment.

[21:13] It was already a few years old when I bought it.

[21:15] I played it for a couple years.

[21:17] It still looked pretty perfect.

[21:18] There was hardly any, any, any, maybe a dimple here or there but cratered like these new

[21:24] games, absolutely not.

[21:25] I think Steve Richie is sort of misleading us when he said that in 2017 he said that.

[21:32] Three years, that was three years ago that he said that statement.

[21:35] Three years later, look at the quality of a stranger things machine and you tell me

[21:40] that Stern cares about getting these playfields to a higher caliber.

[21:45] They just don't and it's so unfortunate.

[21:48] Alright, alright, enough about that.

[21:50] Let's talk about Keith Owens next game.

[21:52] I'm hearing pretty good rumors and pretty good reports from my inside sources of what Keith

[21:58] Owens next Stern pinball game will be and I'm also hearing that if this disruption

[22:04] didn't happen, we were possibly going to see this game at the end of 2020 and I'm not

[22:09] sure if that's still the case.

[22:11] What is Keith Owens?

[22:13] The superstar designer at Stern pinball behind Iron Maiden and Game of the Year Jurassic

[22:18] Park, what is his next game?

[22:20] So here is what I'm hearing Keith Owens is working on over at Stern pinball next.

[22:33] So you heard it here on Canadian pinball podcast, the next game from Keith Owens will be

[22:37] Godzilla.

[22:39] Now we know Stern has acquired the rights to Godzilla a while ago.

[22:43] They stole it from spooky pinball.

[22:46] They didn't really steal it.

[22:47] They just got the license.

[22:49] So Keith Owens going from one big lizard game in Jurassic Park to another big lizard game

[22:55] in Godzilla.

[22:57] So how do we feel about Keith Owens working on Godzilla?

[23:01] So I don't know.

[23:03] I mean, Godzilla is a theme that's pretty niche.

[23:06] Godzilla is obviously very well known, but it's not the same kind of mainstream appeal

[23:13] as Jurassic Park.

[23:15] I think it's a little bit of a bee level theme.

[23:17] I really do.

[23:18] I think it's more of a campy, nerdy sort of sci-fi guy's theme.

[23:22] I think Godzilla would have been a much better theme over at spooky pinball knowing that

[23:27] Shuckin Company loved that theme so much.

[23:30] Do I think Keith Owens loves Godzilla the way Charlie and Company do?

[23:35] No I do not.

[23:37] That being said, who would I rather have design a Godzilla pinball machine?

[23:42] Keith Owens or Charlie Emory without a doubt.

[23:46] Keith Owens is one of the greatest designers and he keeps showing it and he keeps getting

[23:50] better within each game.

[23:51] So I think everyone would always want to have Keith do the actual layout of a game.

[23:57] But I do think this is a little bit of a, you know, a middle of the road.

[24:00] I don't think this is a take my money now kind of theme for people.

[24:05] No Keith Owens is a take my money kind of now designer.

[24:08] Now, and that's my point is I just really wish Stern pinball would align the stars.

[24:15] Why can't they give us the in all star theme within all star designer, within all star

[24:22] coder, within all star artists all at once?

[24:26] So a dream for me would be the Matrix pinball with Keith Owens on design, Lyman Sheets

[24:33] on the code and Zombie Eddie on artwork.

[24:37] To me, like, can't we just get a game in which we get those four gentlemen together to

[24:42] make an all star game?

[24:45] That's just like the last game you ever need to own.

[24:47] It's almost like Stern on purpose does this.

[24:50] They always shuffle the deck.

[24:52] So there's always something just quite not, you know, that will satisfy you forever.

[24:57] It's an interesting thought when you think about it.

[24:59] Does a pinball company actually want to make a game that doesn't make you want to buy

[25:04] more games?

[25:05] Think about that for a minute.

[25:07] If they were to give you your dream theme that it was a grail pin that was super deep,

[25:12] super beautiful, super amazing, super magical that just satisfied your pinball itch forever.

[25:19] Does that even exist?

[25:20] Can that exist?

[25:21] I would argue that everything gets boring and that you would want new games.

[25:25] But just I don't know, maybe that's part of the strategy is to always leave you somewhat

[25:29] unsatisfied.

[25:30] So you buy the next game immediately to see if it actually fulfills you a little bit more.

[25:35] So you can just you can just trademark that.

[25:37] Canadian pinball podcast is telling everyone that Keith Owen is working on Godzilla and

[25:42] it's pronounced canada.

[25:44] It's still a rumor at this point, but look, this is now this is pinball content for all

[25:47] the other pinball shows out there and they can they can say my name canada and they can

[25:51] credit me or they cannot.

[25:53] So that's happening there.

[25:55] What else is going on?

[25:56] Alright, so this we're going to close this show with the wild and weird story over at

[26:01] Jersey Jack pinball that actually saw the first moment in which Ken Cromwell communication

[26:07] specialist for Jersey Jack pinball sort of came in front of the community and set the

[26:11] record straight on something.

[26:13] So if you haven't seen this story, the threat is actually closed down.

[26:17] But someone noticed that they had a wizard of Oz Ruby red edition.

[26:23] And they had a special number of their Ruby red edition and the number they had was 1939.

[26:30] Now that is the year that wizard of Oz movie came out.

[26:34] Now it turns out that another gentleman was selling their Ruby red edition wizard of

[26:38] Oz and they also had game number 1939.

[26:44] So the person was pissed off that Jersey Jack had given someone else a serial number limited

[26:51] edition number game that was supposed to be exclusively theirs.

[26:56] Now is it worth more money that you have wizard of Oz Ruby red Ellie number 1939?

[27:03] Absolutely not.

[27:04] It doesn't make the game worth one more penny at all.

[27:08] And a few reasons for that one Jersey Jack has made so many limited edition wizard of

[27:14] Oz games that no one considers any of them really at any number to be of any extra value.

[27:21] There's just too many of them.

[27:22] If he had only made 250 L.E.s of wizard of Oz sure, you could argue that you have something

[27:28] more valuable than the other ones but that hasn't been the case.

[27:31] The other reason why is just people don't care.

[27:34] Like on the collectible side of this hobby, this isn't like you have a numbers matching

[27:38] Shelby Cobra car or you have like a Paul Newman era Daytona watch.

[27:44] There's just for something to have value, someone has to recognize that value and the buyers

[27:50] just don't care.

[27:51] They just don't.

[27:52] They will never care that you have that.

[27:54] Okay, so it turns out Ken chimed in and said this happened by mistake that unfortunately

[28:00] Jersey Jack Pimball when they went to send someone else a sticker that had the number of

[28:06] their game, they reprinted the 1939 sticker that they gave to somebody else.

[28:12] Now here's why this whole thing could have easily have been avoided from the very beginning.

[28:17] And again, I just think it goes to show that Jersey Jack Pimball needs to figure out their

[28:22] limited edition process and make it better than it currently is because if you ask yourself,

[28:28] how is it even possible in a game in which Jack announced we're only making 1500 Ruby

[28:34] Red editions, right?

[28:36] 1,500.

[28:37] 1500 games that should be ordered numerically.

[28:43] How is it possible that a game can be made that's 1939, which exceeds 1 through 1500?

[28:51] So and according to Jack's process, apparently you can order your game to be serial number

[29:00] any four digits you want.

[29:03] It doesn't have to be between 1 and 1500.

[29:06] Now that is moreronic for obvious reasons because if you want to know you have a game

[29:12] that falls within the 1500 made, how can you possibly, how can you possibly begin to

[29:20] organize where your game falls if you can let someone be number 8,769?

[29:27] And my game is number 6,543.

[29:31] It's so stupid that Jack lets people do that, like personalized numbers that go outside.

[29:38] No, if you're making 1500 of something, sure, let people request number 1 or 23 or 27 or 19 or

[29:48] not even 9, you can't be 19 or 9, but you can't let someone request a number that exceeds

[29:55] 1500.

[29:56] Doesn't that just seem like common sense?

[29:59] So it was nice to see Ken Chiamin.

[30:01] What I'm actually happy to see is Ken's going to be part of the pin-side conversation around

[30:07] Jersey Jack Pimball.

[30:08] I think it's great.

[30:09] And I think one of the things to people, if you have an issue with a manufacturer and

[30:15] there's something that you want clarity on, it's probably best to go to the manufacturer

[30:20] first.

[30:21] In fact, I recommend that.

[30:23] Just go to them first and ask them what happened before you start a pin-side thread claiming

[30:30] that Jersey Jack is a liar and a fraud and try to burn the company's image down simply

[30:37] because of the mistake.

[30:39] And this clearly was a mistake and what happened was someone requested it and got it and then

[30:44] someone else was asked for a plaque and got sent the wrong thing.

[30:47] Okay, so that's the mistake.

[30:49] Whether you believe it or not, so be it.

[30:51] But all of this just could have been avoided.

[30:53] If Jack just stops this stupid process of making it so ambiguous and impossible to understand

[31:01] how his early model works, I mean, have we forgotten the joke that is the Yellowbrick

[31:07] Road Limited Edition game?

[31:09] I mean, think about that for a minute.

[31:11] Jersey Jack Pimball, this is why people don't trust Jack and there is validity to those

[31:16] who say Jack is just a sleazy salesman with some sleazy sales tactics because think about

[31:21] how moronic this is.

[31:23] We are making a limited number of Yellowbrick Road Edition Waz machines.

[31:29] Okay?

[31:30] Limited number.

[31:31] Alright, what's the next question you would ask?

[31:33] Well how many are you making?

[31:34] You know what the answer is?

[31:36] Well we don't know.

[31:37] And when you order a Yellowbrick Road Edition, you know what's on your game?

[31:40] It tells you what your game number is.

[31:43] So you have game number 75.

[31:45] Okay cool.

[31:46] 75 out of how many?

[31:49] Nobody knows.

[31:50] It's anyone's guess.

[31:52] That's a problem.

[31:53] This company needs to wake up when it comes to limited edition games.

[31:57] Okay?

[31:58] And it's always plague them.

[32:01] And I do see people on Pinside being like the whole limited edition collector's thing

[32:05] is stupid and we should get rid of it.

[32:07] No, those people are stupid.

[32:09] It's a great way to give collectors and people who do value these things to give them

[32:14] something that means something to them.

[32:16] Stern's three tiered model is perfect.

[32:20] And you know where it starts to fall apart is when you get Lucy Goosey with it.

[32:25] Like just make as many as you say you're going to make and don't make more.

[32:30] That's how you maintain something being special to a collector.

[32:35] If you say you know when things fall apart is when you sell 500 monsters machines, you

[32:39] get 500 orders on day one and then on day two you say what we're actually going to make

[32:44] 600.

[32:46] That's where it falls apart for me.

[32:48] It falls apart when you announce too many then it's not even limited.

[32:50] We're going to make 800 Star Wars limited editions.

[32:54] We're going to make what did Jack say he's going to make 5000 limited edition Willy Wonka

[32:59] games 5000 and then 500 collectors editions at 12.5 is also too many.

[33:06] So that's you know it's just a ridiculous item.

[33:07] It was nice to see Ken Chime in with that and you know that's what's going on in the

[33:11] world of Pimball these days.

[33:12] The final piece of news that I don't see anyone really talking about is the fact that

[33:17] the state of Texas is reopened for business.

[33:21] And with Texas reopening as one of the first states to turn everything back on.

[33:25] You know there's one Pimball company in Texas that told us that they were ready to show

[33:31] Raza in mid March.

[33:34] And here we are in mid May.

[33:36] Texas is back on.

[33:38] So when is deep root Pimball going to show us retro atomic zombie adventure land China

[33:44] is shipping parts.

[33:46] Pimball life out of Chicago is shipping parts.

[33:49] There really is no more excuses as to the delay or the hold up for retro atomic zombie

[33:57] adventure land.

[33:58] There are no Pimball shows that are going to take place anytime soon.

[34:02] There is not going to be a physical moment for Robert to show us this game.

[34:06] But when is he finally going to show us here it is you can place your order now.

[34:11] I'm just wondering now I'm going to speculate.

[34:14] I'm going to speculate and I'm going to say that I just don't see deep root getting

[34:19] this game out the door anytime in the summer.

[34:23] And I hope I'm wrong.

[34:24] I want to see this game.

[34:25] But it's just delays delays delays and I just want to believe what they tell us when

[34:31] they come on the show that he had the game ready to go in March and he had games ready

[34:35] to ship out to people by the end of April.

[34:39] So if we believe that stuff that I have to believe that manufacturing was on board and

[34:45] ready to go I have to believe that the game was finished.

[34:49] And now that we're heading into June in a couple weeks are we going to see deep root

[34:56] Pimball finally finally reveal a game offer a game for sale and most importantly manufacture

[35:04] a game and get it to a customer.

[35:07] The jig is up like where I think we're all exhausted on this wait for Raza.

[35:12] Just just tell us how many are they're going to be.

[35:16] What is the game?

[35:17] What is the platform?

[35:18] What makes it special?

[35:20] He can't keep hiding because if Robert delays this too long and he allows guns and roses

[35:27] and ninja turtles and all these other games to come out.

[35:31] It's just going to be DOA and I think now is the golden opportunity for them.

[35:37] If they're going to make a limited number of Raza games and they can actually get them

[35:40] to customers I won't even bring up what he said in the past that whenever you order a

[35:45] game from them it's going to be at your door in two weeks.

[35:49] I mean remember he said this stuff every order is going to be shipped within two weeks

[35:53] to people.

[35:54] Is that a reality?

[35:55] Or are they going to change the shipment schedule around on us?

[35:59] I don't think people care.

[36:00] I think they just want to see it.

[36:02] I think they just want to see it.

[36:03] As far as the other games I think we can all agree that ironically it's going to be really

[36:07] hard for hot wheels to catch fire.

[36:10] I don't know how they drum up excitement for this game now after this long pause and they

[36:15] haven't let anyone stream it.

[36:17] To me when hot wheels finally streams itself to the world it's going to be a moment in

[36:23] which people either get on board or they immediately write it off.

[36:27] There's going to be no slow burn.

[36:29] It doesn't matter how much Josh Kugler tries to convince us with long winded pin side

[36:35] post about how the game is great and why we should love it.

[36:38] We're going to make up our own minds when we see it.

[36:40] I am concerned because the code is all about the TV show that is for six year old kids.

[36:47] So you're playing a game that is basically bringing a six year old kids TV show to life.

[36:53] That worries me.

[36:54] But we'll see when we see it streamed.

[36:55] P3 multi-morphic the highest.

[36:57] I mean, I don't know.

[37:00] I mean how many people have platforms that can even absorb it?

[37:04] Are people getting it?

[37:05] It's definitely P3's cool this game to date.

[37:08] But then again, like $10,000 to get a multi-morphic right now seems like a really tall order

[37:13] for people as we go through this new economic reality.

[37:18] So I think Stern Pimball is going to be the first and I think they're going to reap the

[37:21] benefits of being first back on the market.

[37:24] I keep hearing that Jersey Jack's move is a little bit delayed.

[37:27] I don't think we're going to see Guns and Roses any time before the fall.

[37:31] I hope I'm wrong.

[37:32] I want to Guns and Roses more than any pin right now.

[37:35] I really do.

[37:35] It's the one pin that has me the most excited because of the theme.

[37:39] But I just can't see Jersey Jack getting this game on the line in the next few months.

[37:44] I think it's going to be a very, very slow release for this game.

[37:51] And Stern Pimball is going to swoop in and have stuff going.

[37:54] When this thing turns back on, the companies that can turn on the quickest are going to

[37:59] be the ones that are best suited to survive this.

[38:03] The companies that are still delayed and are going to have issues with supplies and parts

[38:08] and excuses and this and that, they're going to have a tremendously hard time because I

[38:13] do think a lot of people have cabin fever.

[38:16] A lot of people have money that they're not using for vacations and for travel and for

[38:22] going out.

[38:23] And they're going to want to get a new pin.

[38:25] Whoever, whoever puts up a new pin for sale is going to see I think a lot, a lot of

[38:33] demand for it.

[38:34] And if you wait, if I'm Jack and if I'm Chicago gaming company and if I'm deep root,

[38:40] you got to get your games out.

[38:42] You got to get your games out in June, July.

[38:44] If you want to capture some of this new pent up demand for new games.

[38:49] Now where there's going to be an evaporation of demand is from operators.

[38:54] So I don't think like pro models are going to be like really sought after as much.

[38:59] I think the collector and the home buyer is going to be driving the return to Pimball

[39:05] at first until location play returns.

[39:09] That's just my opinion.

[39:10] Everyone.

[39:11] At the so 484 of Canadian Pimball Podcast, the Darth Vader of Pimball Podcasting will

[39:17] talk to you soon later.
