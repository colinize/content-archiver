[00:00] We are live. I've got to go get another charger for this phone hold on a second.

[00:09] Starting a little early.

[00:13] Guns roses. Guns roses.

[00:29] Oh.

[00:44] Everybody doing.

[00:55] Ah.

[01:13] All right.

[01:14] All right, let me go see where, how you guys doing?

[01:21] Trying to get a little Facebook going here as well.

[01:27] And make this work, I can.

[01:35] Okay, little crooked.

[01:39] Use the charge, it can be a little,

[01:42] you see there's a stand here somewhere.

[01:47] On second gang, they right back.

[02:12] I know it's not the best shooter, but really when you look at guns and roses display,

[02:41] it is the greatest use of a screen and a pinball machine ever.

[02:44] Like, no game is ever done as good about,

[02:50] let's see, I think this should work.

[02:54] There we go.

[02:56] That's weird.

[03:01] Why is it?

[03:02] Just trying to like get this phone.

[03:10] I'm going to turn it around.

[03:17] I guess you just join on YouTube really.

[03:22] Do that.

[03:23] Okay.

[03:24] So it's, it really is like, can you guys hear me?

[03:31] Okay, sound okay.

[03:32] I'm not wearing the headset, so I'm just going to like talking to this and thinking,

[03:36] I think it should sound fine, but just want to let me, are we good?

[03:40] All right.

[03:45] Thank you for hanging with me for a little bit of a later start.

[03:50] I was taken kill to soccer.

[03:54] He decided not to like kick the damn ball at all.

[03:59] I didn't want to be there.

[04:02] I'm going to just have to keep this here for Facebook.

[04:04] You guys are going to have a side angle until I, it charges.

[04:07] So I would just go over to YouTube.

[04:09] We're on YouTube right now.

[04:10] It's like, it's a better sound.

[04:13] It's a better angle.

[04:14] It's better everything.

[04:15] So just,

[04:21] happy Saturday, everybody.

[04:22] It is a beautiful day here today.

[04:25] It is like a 75 and sunny.

[04:29] It is perfect.

[04:30] There is an October fest happening at the beach and row eight in today.

[04:34] So we're going to go there later.

[04:37] And you know how I always feel.

[04:40] Involves a winter sport.

[04:42] So like on a beautiful Saturday day like today, like being out there is really like where you want to be.

[04:49] Look, I've had like a fun week with my birthday.

[04:57] Little physically taxing on my body.

[04:59] I think I've been.

[05:02] Partying a little too hard to woke up this morning.

[05:04] Like we're not in the city last night.

[05:06] Tommy jazz.

[05:07] Steakhouse dinner.

[05:09] You ever had those like steakhouse dinners where you wake up the next day.

[05:12] You're like, what did I do to my body?

[05:14] Like nothing feels good.

[05:16] Nothing.

[05:17] Like I don't understand my people how they can consistently eat.

[05:20] Like steakhouse meals.

[05:22] I feel horrible.

[05:24] Like I would much rather go to like Omokase and have.

[05:28] Like the best quality seafood one bite at a time.

[05:32] Sad boy brother.

[05:33] Thank you.

[05:34] What's good brother shout out to Walt for calling out that loser.

[05:38] Imagine talking trash to more well known people throughout the community with more of an input than he'll ever have.

[05:45] Absolutely hilarious.

[05:47] I was very happy to hear Walt's video.

[05:52] It made me.

[05:54] It made my day if you will.

[05:56] I was happy to.

[06:00] To just have people be on the right side of this whole thing.

[06:04] Like it's it's it was a really weird thing that he did.

[06:08] And you know, I think what's really strange about it's still to this day is Glenn.

[06:15] Who I I don't have him blocked on Facebook or anything like I don't even think Glenn.

[06:22] I don't.

[06:26] I don't really know how much I've reached out and apologized yet for his comments.

[06:30] So really strange to sort of shoot yourself in the foot like that.

[06:34] And then I think continue to say stuff about others is a is not really a smart approach.

[06:43] about it much since all the drama unfolded like a week ago. I've been more focused on the show and

[06:50] talking about

[06:53] Star Wars and Big Bang Bar and we're going to talk all about that. I've got to

[06:59] do you guys want to see? It's funny to me like people thinking, you know the whole Big Bang Bar

[07:07] issue is kind of hysterical right now because I'm just going to go look at I think I have some more photos. Let's see

[07:19] let's see what this is. I got stuff I can't share yet.

[07:26] But this one's my favorite. Check it out. It's going to be my new one.

[07:37] This is going to be my new. He's got fake photos. He doesn't know this is going to be my new

[07:45] wallpaper on Facebook. But there you go. We're going to talk about all the games coming. Now what I'm

[07:57] hearing lately is that a Tales of the Arabian Knights will be out before the Big Bang Bar remake.

[08:06] So, toad in before Big Bang Bar by Padredy Gaming. Okay. So that is what I'm hearing. I'm also hearing that

[08:20] no, this weird angle. Let me just try to like turn it upside down.

[08:27] Let's try to do this.

[08:35] A little crooked. It's better, right? I'm also hearing. Okay. So let's talk about it. So we're going to get

[08:47] we're going to get Tales of the Arabian Knights from Padredy Gaming with Brian Allen is redoing

[08:54] the art package. Now Brian Allen did the art package on the Funhouse remake. Funhouse was a game

[09:02] that never really had like the greatest art. I'm not sure you should ever you don't need to redo

[09:11] the art on toad in. You really don't need to redo the art on that game. It is a stunning game.

[09:18] All you need to do is make toad in with a CPR gold play field. So the inserts pop more and

[09:29] just brass plate everything and then add in auto plunger to the game because at the end of that

[09:37] game you have to sort of manually plunge when you get to the final battle. Which I kind of think

[09:44] is a little bit of the charm. Yeah, Hector. So I mean obviously they're not happy with me but it's

[09:51] going to go toad in Big Bang Bar. They've got Circus Voltaire. They've got Theatre of Magic and they've

[09:56] got Adam's family which was like the big surprise is you don't look wicked planetary very smart for

[10:05] swooping in and getting all these IPs. I'm just not really sure in the current climate of Pimbal.

[10:12] The problem with Pidready games is unlike CGC they do not make their remakes better than the

[10:20] originals. If you could see the what Melvin has done to Big Bang Bar I mean chrome plating all

[10:32] the metal on the game adding so much cool stuff that like makes the game glow more and pop more

[10:40] more colorful you know more light up arrows on rams more this more fluorescent like literally

[10:47] Melvin was going to make the Big Bang Bar like the best example of it ever and Pidready and Rick

[10:59] had the license and so you know Melvin handed off to them his prototype which is honestly what

[11:05] and they're not I don't think they're going to do it. I think they're going to go back because they

[11:09] don't because they don't get it like they they they just want to like make it spec for spec identical

[11:15] when Melvin was like not only am I going to remake it but I'm going to make it better than the original

[11:20] ever looked. Kerry you know it's like it's weird right that they're like Melvin Williams has nothing

[11:29] to do with like there that's not true like that's kind of a lie like the game they're working on

[11:38] built off of his prototype like well I don't know why they're acting so cagey about it.

[11:45] I also think everybody would have loved to have had DPX make an elevated version of Big Bang Bar

[11:55] versus Pidready you know the problem with Pidready is just the the the quality and they don't have

[12:01] the reputation and I don't know why it's weird right it's like going just like parts and just

[12:08] screw the parts together the right way. What up franchi how's everybody doing? I haven't heard from

[12:21] from Luke over at spooky I hope I hope my show didn't upset I didn't upset him at all I didn't

[12:26] mean anything negative at all I just trying to give them a little bit of advice for those of you

[12:31] who saw like I think there's now kind of like a it's not a dimple gate it's like a bulge gate going

[12:39] on on the evil dead thread now of this of like the length of the screws and is are they too long or

[12:49] they're pushing through the play field and I all I was doing was just reporting on what I was reading

[12:55] and and just suggesting that us you know just you gotta always be cool and you gotta always make

[13:03] sure that you know you don't thread into leave Pinside if people are saying stupid stuff I mean

[13:09] again if you want to if you want to go to a place where people say stupid stuff then Pinside is

[13:15] your Huckleberry because there's no dumber place to like spend a lot of your life then on Pinside

[13:23] I mean it like and the people there it's funny like the the the hyper users I think they all

[13:29] uh have wasted a lot of years of their life with the tens of thousands of posts

[13:37] um yeah you know it's it's interesting too I saw my old friend Derek is back on Pinside I sent

[13:47] them a text I was just like hey man like um I just want to know you know that just every all the

[13:57] all that goes away if we just like connect he stopped talking to me because um because of the

[14:06] of Trump being elected and I really took that I really felt abandoned by one of my best friends

[14:13] over politics and and if you know me and he knows me everyone that knows me knows that I'm not some like

[14:22] Trump MAGA guy I'm I'm very moderate but I will vote with my family's best interest in mine and I will

[14:32] vote with my wallet in mind and I don't think it was fair to erase what's that smell

[14:47] do you smell that babe Brenda are you are you spraying something

[14:53] in

[14:57] I don't know maybe someone's gardening something weird I'm just like all of a sudden

[15:02] smells terrible

[15:08] oh sorry it is distracting anyway

[15:14] yeah

[15:19] oh I'm reading you guys comments

[15:27] don't need to be MAGA to be anti woke yeah of course it's not the septic we don't have a septic

[15:35] tank it's nice we're I love that this house is on like the cities septic lines so there's no

[15:43] septic tank we have propane in the backyard which is nice um and then um yeah there's like

[15:53] this woman when she renovated this house like did everything perfect so we hadn't do nothing

[16:05] what's up guys on a Facebook we got guys on youtube um all right so let's get back to the game

[16:12] so Star Wars Ellie is shipping and you know I'm starting to see I'm starting to see

[16:22] I'm starting to see that no okay so I'm just so Rob said that it didn't take it didn't take it

[16:30] as Luke saying the customer is wrong just dumbass yeah I saw that um I'm seeing the Star Wars

[16:38] Ellie's landing people's homes and look I'm happy for anyone who buys this game I'm happy you guys

[16:45] are gonna lose $4,000 in just a couple months and I'm happy to see that the Star Wars Ellie's

[16:51] are not sold out I'm happy I'm happy that the majority of people don't consider that game to be

[16:58] special enough to spend that kind of money I don't think Stern deserves to have a sellout of a game

[17:05] where that's the creative layer they're they're thinking is worthy of $13,000 in a pinball machine

[17:13] um I'm sure the game looks better in person that's great I can't wait to see one in person

[17:19] I'll see it it automated hey Brenda what's that smell yeah what's where that is like the most hideous

[17:35] oh my god we have this like rabbit rodent repellent that's I it's it's atrocious it's only supposed

[17:44] to be sprayed outside they sprayed it in the garage let me just take a moment people

[17:56] it's like atrocious smelling

[17:59] um no there's no pest control issue we I got like a rabbit repellent like a year ago because

[18:15] the rabbits would like return up my lawn you can't you know you can't kill rabbits and let me tell

[18:22] you like it didn't work they just hop right over it like whatever you spray it they just hop

[18:27] over it now you're not allowed you're not allowed to like trap rabbits here it's like a legal

[18:36] this smell of death um

[18:42] I um yeah I just think Star Wars is gonna come and go I think it's gonna be talked about as much

[18:50] as the old Star Wars game is talked about which is not very often and I think that it's just

[18:56] gonna be a game where all right like well it's gonna kill on location it's Star Wars it's an

[19:02] operator's dream but I think it's not gonna be this like sales hit for stern and I think that

[19:11] the walking dead remastered is also not gonna be the sales hit for stern what's your favorite song

[19:18] mode on G and R um you know I will say like I think my favorite when I play the game is um out

[19:32] to get me I really do I love out to get me and then I think maybe um civil war second what I

[19:41] what I'm what I'm a little disappointed in the G and R code and I've said this is on some of the

[19:47] games like november like songs like november rain I just think they gave up like coding the light show

[19:53] made way through like there's no there's no magic at the end of november rain in that outro and

[19:59] there should be like they should have coded the light to like dramatically sync up with the

[20:08] nana they didn't do any of it like I don't understand I mean I get it it's a 10 minute song you're

[20:12] not gonna get it to the end that often but like november rain starts cool but then it just it's

[20:17] the same light show repeating throughout um

[20:26] yeah um so yeah I think look I think Star Wars is gonna move nothing for stern I think the walking

[20:34] dead remastered if there's a price increase is gonna it's just gonna be funny man like I look at it

[20:43] all and I look at it and I kind of want to laugh that stern is gonna raise the prices of their

[20:52] product when demand continues to decline and it's gonna get really interesting when um you know

[21:05] I don't even think Pokemon is next like as the cornerstone game I just I don't I don't know I

[21:13] can't put my finger on what it's it's Jack dangerous game um it's one of these things we're like I

[21:21] feel like we do know like fallout transformers Pokemon like whatever order they come in it feels like

[21:28] those guesses are pretty accurate and we're gonna and again that just doesn't sound like

[21:36] what stern needs like I think people would rather hear super Mario brothers top gun and karate kid

[21:43] you know or die hard Christmas vacation and Ferris Bueller's day off I think people

[21:51] would rather hear Indiana Jones I think people would rather hear um you know GI Joe whatever

[22:04] like he man like I mean it like stuff with nostalgic appeal

[22:10] Gremlins is the dream theme for me

[22:15] demand drops raise prices yeah carry but it's like a weird decision man I think people are

[22:20] just like I think they're just kind of over it I really do I think people have lost the patience

[22:29] with losing the amount of money they're losing because like you know like the whole

[22:33] it made it like it was fun six years ago and when Zach's bye bye bye was like the joke right and it

[22:40] was like when Zach was telling everybody to buy bye bye like he wasn't wrong like back then

[22:45] you you really bought anything you kind of were good you were good it was like one of these hobbies

[22:50] were like you were good uh now the depreciation is is is is pretty um pretty significant and it's just

[22:58] the problem with the depreciation now it's so immediate whereas it used to take a much longer time

[23:05] and also you just never really lost three to four thousand dollars on any stern machine now it's

[23:10] like there's thousands of games that have significantly lost value and there's and there's also just

[23:16] like the unspoken thing that continues I think should be making everybody a little nervous

[23:23] is there just there's thousands of unsold games in boxes just piling up as inventory and that

[23:31] always continues to be the the hidden or secret sort of

[23:38] thing that's going to cripple even more pinball prices because those things have to end up somewhere

[23:44] and these distros I mean I've already heard from very legit sources that distros will take 11.5

[23:52] on the table for Star Wars do you want to know exactly what a distro makes on Star Wars Ellie do

[23:58] want to do you want to know the margin they make because I was told exactly what the margin is

[24:07] now I'm trying to remember exactly what the number was because it's I believe distros on an

[24:13] Ellie are making two thousand two hundred and like fifty dollars like something like that

[24:23] fall of the empire Ajax thank you fizzy thank you for the two dollars brother

[24:28] um Ajax can he hit it is the leader of the rebellion well I didn't name my my son Cassian so

[24:35] like I it doesn't again it's it's not even a rebellion okay so they make two thousand four hundred

[24:41] dollars on an Ellie so just think about that for a minute that there's two thousand four hundred

[24:48] dollars goes into the pocket of a distro I just just think about that why why I mean how

[25:05] many of these games are simply drop shipped from Chicago to the customer like drop shipped

[25:13] the deal like the distro gets in order gets the address that games not going to all these distros

[25:23] and dealers it's going from Chicago right to the customer

[25:35] I mean but you have to remember that's just the distro margin

[25:41] um I like it like it'd be one thing if these things have like bulletproof warranties and

[25:48] you know what I'm saying like I don't know like I I failed to see like

[25:53] the the problem is you know okay like you gotta look at it like this

[26:00] the issue really though it does become and I understand why they need to make money on these

[26:06] Ellie's like when you think about it because the problem is let's say a distro sells 10 L's right

[26:13] that's twenty four thousand dollars they make in profit okay 24 thousand now they got to pay taxes

[26:19] on that so let's say all right they're gonna net out with around like fourteen thousand dollars

[26:26] in the pocket okay fourteen thousand after those ten Ellie's are sold

[26:32] but what about the you know when they buy directly from Stern like you know all those premiums

[26:38] and pros like to buy the premium from Stern I'm sure there's shelling out like eight thousand

[26:44] dollars on each premium or eighty five hundred to sell it for you know ninety seven hundred right

[26:51] so all those unsolved premiums are sitting on you can see how quickly you know just two unsolved

[27:00] premiums two unsolved premiums would be something like sixteen thousand dollars you gave Stern

[27:08] for the chance to maybe make back like three to four thousand dollars that's the problem

[27:17] that's the problem no it's like it really is difficult like you know when you think about it

[27:26] it's tough on these distros because you know they they like it's all about cash flow and as you know

[27:35] as you're making money over here you're losing money over here and everything that's sitting

[27:40] unsolved is is loot and you know all those games sitting unsolved that are depreciating in your

[27:47] warehouse main like they may never move like you and and we know this all too well like there's a lot

[27:54] of games that dealers and distros were under water on like they were under water like literally

[28:01] like I spent you know I don't know what is it I gave Stern a check for ten five for John Wickele

[28:09] and I can't sell it and the market value on it now is like nine all those guns and roses you know

[28:26] yeah so it's not as like it's not as like easy as it looks you know like the good old days when

[28:32] dudes like Trent or just drop shipping like and like every Ellie just sold out instantly and

[28:37] everything just moved like those are the good old days you know and I hope all those guys like

[28:43] saved all their money because the those gravy train days are over for for a lot of these

[28:50] distros you and they know it they but like like in the end like I really don't care about dealers

[28:57] the distros making money I would love to make money myself like getting you the game you want right

[29:02] I mean if it makes you happy to buy from someone you like that's how it should be and in the end

[29:08] like all the dealers are distros they want the same thing we want they want great games that hold

[29:13] value they want that like I don't think anyone who's a dealer or a distro is happy with the

[29:19] mediocrity that's sort of swept through the hobby recently and also with the high prices they're

[29:25] not happy about these high prices it means less customers there there's no other way

[29:32] to to look at all this like why like I'm gonna sell way more Ellie's

[29:39] if they're 10-5 then if they're 13

[29:47] you

[29:55] also count trading games selling again with nice profit well yeah I mean retro jango in the house

[30:02] yeah no totally like whenever I see like zack lists something like um let me use an example

[30:10] something like a like a venomly exact list it for like 80 500 I'm just making up a price right now

[30:19] I'm always like damn man you know you know he bought it from that dude for like 75 hundred to

[30:27] seventy eight hundred just to get rid of it right just to credit towards another game probably

[30:32] or something like he's got to make money on it and you know and that's why like some of these

[30:38] trade-in dudes are just getting hosed and they don't want you know I mean and then these are some dudes

[30:43] who probably bought some of these games brand new 13000 and then trading it in for like 79 hundred

[30:58] you know what look the the easiest way to avoid all this is just to wait until something checks

[31:03] all the boxes and keep it forever I think that's really where a lot of people are at now I think

[31:09] people are starting to see the the forest for the trees in his hobby I think a lot of people are

[31:15] happy with their games you know look and there's new people coming into the hobby the whole all the time

[31:19] I saw this dude um I forget where it was maybe it was California or something he he put all these

[31:25] games in the basement of his wife's thrift shop and it looks awesome I'm like I love seeing like

[31:31] surprising locations where people kind of create a little pim you know pimple um

[31:37] barcade or arcade if you will it's a beautiful thing it's like this thing is so cool man like when I

[31:44] sometimes it it's easy to get overly critical um you know like Guns and Roses see man I mean this

[31:51] thing's now like 10 10 G's it's incredible the amount of like the amount of assets in this game

[32:00] the amount of creativity in this game the amount of like cool factor of this game and it's lost

[32:06] it's demand I get it doesn't shoot great I get it I get it I get it I mean there's nothing I can

[32:11] do about that there's nothing I can do about that but it's still an absolute work of art it really is

[32:19] it's funny spooky could make evil dead for C for 10 and stern selling at least for 13 doesn't make

[32:24] sense um well you know the reason why just is Stern's got like I said on my show they've got like

[32:33] hundreds of employees they've got all of that square footage they've got to pay that rent every month

[32:42] and they've got to feed all those people I heard they have something like 80 people

[32:47] that are just in the front office I mean you gotta remember like okay so imagine you work in

[32:52] the front office of Stern and what do you think you make I'm assuming most of these jobs are

[33:02] six figure jobs right I mean wait people working in Pimble for 50 grand I don't think so like

[33:08] so you've it adds up like quickly all the benefits all the people all the you know all the all the

[33:16] salaries you have to pay out and so you need to you need to move thousands of games every every month

[33:25] to to make all that work where spooky pinball family owned business looks like there's about what like

[33:34] 30 of them maybe 30 total maybe a little bit more in Benton Wisconsin I think their rent is one

[33:42] dollar a month the town basically pays them to stay there and loves the jobs they provide

[33:49] they're in Benton Wisconsin you know the average price of a home is probably

[33:55] $200,000 300,000 right I mean this isn't like New York City this isn't like Jersey Jack where he

[34:01] when he was in New Jersey how expensive that rent was I mean the money goes a long way there

[34:06] money doesn't go a long way in Chicago it doesn't go a long way in other places it definitely

[34:14] doesn't go a long way in Europe or Australia where these guys were spending like such a small

[34:19] fortune on every individual game and when I see the prices in Australia still I'm still just

[34:25] it baffles me like who who can even afford to drop like I mean everything's like $20,000 or more

[34:32] for one game one thinball machine

[34:39] oh well you know look in the end it's funny to watch it all go down I mean I'm absolutely

[34:46] gonna love going to Expo and seeing if there's any surprises uh do you guys think walking

[34:51] dead's gonna be at Expo do you think Stern's gonna do what they did last time and sort of

[34:57] steal the thunder away from the cornerstone game with the remastered game the way they did with

[35:02] X-Men and Metallica remastered I kind of feel like

[35:08] part of me feels like they would never do that the Star Wars and the other part of me feels like

[35:14] they might have to do that because Star Wars sales are not there and they just need they need to

[35:17] inject something exciting and nuanced to the line

[35:27] I hope they do too I mean the thing with Expo is like really right now there's no real reveals

[35:34] happening like if you think about it nothing's getting revealed there I think we might see a teaser

[35:41] trailer for back to the future so that would be fun why not right we all know you're making it

[35:50] we all know it's coming next year I think Barry needs to put a date out there and and need it

[35:55] I worry about I worry about back to future I worry about Barry I do I worry that Dutch

[36:02] really doesn't have experience um with switching a line over efficiently making multiple games

[36:13] designing a game while the games on the line like I just worry about Dutch I don't think they're

[36:19] going to go away at all I just I just worry about like you know that they have I mean Raza's

[36:28] next and you know I absolutely just I literally I've seen Melvin's Raza I've seen the changes to it

[36:40] wait you see how cool the translate is the top or super cool like it is absolutely stunning and

[36:46] I don't I don't mean to take anything away from Alice because Alice is is also a beautiful game

[36:52] but Raza's just so much more like comprehensively stunning it has more to shoot at it has

[37:03] and he's fixed the stuff and I hope you know all signs are pointing to some really fun use of

[37:09] magnets that he's going to put into the game that Jpop was never ever to get able to work at the

[37:14] deep root level so really really neat game and the thing about Raza's like you will see it on the

[37:22] line and you will be able to buy it next year killian don't don't hang on the window buddy

[37:31] hold on I got this I don't need a break I don't need a broken window today

[37:44] like a phone yeah it's all for you oh no no no no no no you might have been you might have

[37:57] had to throw it out no I don't know let me see we didn't have to throw it out you did it yeah it's a pink one

[38:06] it's not working do why do you need it

[38:15] but I think that might got thrown out paid because it stopped working

[38:22] yes I tried for weeks to charge you oh my god what

[38:29] okay I'm gonna get you on this I don't understand why

[38:46] I don't know why would I hold on to a broken item

[38:58] what I do wrong broken mic threw it out

[39:04] this is um you know this is why when the weekday starts

[39:16] oh

[39:29] I'll get you a new one buddy

[39:48] he just said he bisses his gold microphone that means it is adorable

[39:52] no it's funny because like he literally hasn't used it in months and now it's everything

[40:04] oh where were we um

[40:09] um

[40:17] how we felt when we got through the lamp

[40:26] oh my god did I throw it out oh no one's second hand let me just look real quick

[40:39] you

[40:56] yeah

[41:09] Oh

[41:27] God

[41:35] Oh, I guess they are

[41:39] I'm gonna open the bourbon oh my gosh

[41:48] Oh

[41:53] This is

[41:56] This is gonna be a thing this weekend now this gold microphone

[42:03] How you guys doing

[42:06] Do you guys feel like the energy levels of pimple like what you feel like we um I think what's gonna happen is this

[42:13] I think beetle juice is just gonna be like I'm just gonna blow everybody away. I mean I really do feel this way about beetle juice

[42:21] I feel like

[42:22] Franci is gonna crush it. I think they're gonna like I

[42:28] Think they're gonna drop what is gonna be probably the most stunning pimp on machine

[42:36] Maybe ever and

[42:40] I am

[42:41] I'm really looking forward to it and I think we need it. I think this hobby needs it

[42:48] You know like if you think about the games we've had recently like dune

[42:52] Didn't blow everybody away. I love the creativity and dune. I do I think the sound is absolutely incredible

[43:01] um

[43:01] I think they nailed they nailed it, but it's still dune right and it doesn't have the same

[43:09] Like I need to own this

[43:13] Unless you love dune, but if you love doing of course you're very happy with that game

[43:18] I would have loved to have had a new tron right now. I would have loved it like if if stern

[43:24] remastered tron

[43:27] I mean it just would have been so good

[43:32] You know, and I just think

[43:35] We're not gonna get that we're gonna get walking dead um

[43:39] King Kong

[43:40] I mean look how cool King Kong is now that that guy put in the

[43:45] The movie clips like it like it's almost like we all could tell something was missing from Kong and something was making Kong not special

[43:55] And it was the it was stern

[43:58] cutting corners and not

[44:01] Putting in the iconic Kong imagery

[44:07] And I'm sorry, but like the King Kong game looks

[44:11] Not like King Kong should look

[44:15] They should have they've should have done more of like old New York City. It should have had that vibe and that feel

[44:22] and it should have been

[44:24] such a differently conceived game and when you try to

[44:28] Like make a game that supposedly like paying homage to the old King Kong prototype and like this

[44:33] You've lost all of us

[44:36] You lost the narrative like now you're now you're doing stuff for um

[44:40] For like for inside pinball like reasons not what the IP deserves

[44:47] If you want to sell to the masses you have to accept that you are basically the came out of pinball damn

[44:59] Franchi don't don't tell us how you you have really feel um well

[45:04] You know franchi I mean Stern's problem is like

[45:07] I don't know why they don't just go back to making things for the masses things with mass appeal

[45:13] But also priced to sell to the masses

[45:17] You know, and this is where the the the truth lies and all of what's just happened is

[45:22] The boutiques are the companies that should be selling games for $15,000 not the mass produced company

[45:30] It's the boutique watchmakers that sell at the high price. It's the boutique car manufacturers that sell at the high price

[45:37] It's the boutique wineries that sell at the high price. It's not the mass

[45:42] Stern wants to be mass and high price

[45:46] They want to be volume and

[45:49] Command the most amount of money. I mean a stern game fully loaded is $15,000 now

[45:55] Right, it's about to get more expensive and they will not survive trying to do both

[46:03] That and and everybody feels that because when you put a stern next to a game like this

[46:08] It looks half the price

[46:11] when you put a

[46:13] Harry Potter next to a king Kong

[46:17] King Kong looks like a tinker toy and I and I mean this when I say this when you put evil dead

[46:23] next to king Kong

[46:27] Evil dead looks so much more expensive

[46:34] Again boutiques should be

[46:40] Higher price lower volume

[46:43] Instant instant collectible when you get it right and that is what we're going to see

[46:56] Stern just like

[46:57] Stern just like saw

[46:59] Everything was happening during the covid secondhand market and just thought that they could

[47:05] Adjust their entire business model to reflect that

[47:09] And I really do feel like they just felt like

[47:12] These these customers are idiots and they'll just buy anything

[47:18] Yet jaws 50th like yeah like at $9,500 like absolutely. I think jaws 50th is like a like a really

[47:30] Good game like it really is. I mean creatively. I think there could have been a little bit more done. We all do

[47:37] I

[47:38] Mean that shark still looks like something I'd put in the bathtub with killing that cost $3 like you know come on

[47:44] Like the fact that we all accept it the

[47:47] Like and I get it like they should have designed

[47:52] A better Mac the shark fin is also gang pathetic like it's a

[47:58] It's a sticker on a moving target. They couldn't design a fin to pop up

[48:03] From under the playfield and be so much cooler than that. But you know you guys have

[48:08] very very low

[48:10] Very low expectations of what should be mechanically in these games these days and you know

[48:17] It's not just jaws

[48:19] Star Wars got nothing interesting mechanically in it

[48:23] I mean Harry Potter is not got any then you know

[48:26] There's not like a lot of magic mechanically in Potter. There's I mean shoots beautifully

[48:31] There wasn't a lot mechanically in Elton John shoots beautifully

[48:35] You know shots are the new toys is kind of been the joke for the last like four years, but it's kind of true

[48:42] King Kong

[48:44] I don't know like

[48:46] No nothing really

[48:48] Right

[48:53] Let's see what we got going on here. You will see a game firing on every cylinder with spooky's next game

[49:00] They even added cylinders to fire extra wow see this is what I love I love franchise

[49:07] I love this is the kind of excitement. I just don't get from John Borg when you look at Star Wars

[49:13] When I look at Jack Danger my boy over there like he just kind of just like

[49:19] I don't know stern just feels like no one over there is like completely like oh I can't wait to see what we're doing next

[49:24] Like nobody's saying that over at stern. Do you ever see George Gomez say that you can't wait

[49:29] Like they're just kind of like we made it we you know we made what we think is a good game is kind of like the vibe over there

[49:37] MMR Merlin has it all for a decent price um

[49:43] Medieval madness is a is a phenomenal game and

[49:47] You know, I mean, I'm glad you guys are finally getting your Merlin trim versions. They'll probably make another version of it

[49:53] The CGC remakes as much as I don't like them as a company because of all their radio silence

[49:58] I mean they make phenomenal games. I mean, I'm you know, I

[50:01] Two things can happen to opposing things can be

[50:05] Occurring at the same time that they are the worst with their customer service and they make

[50:10] What is maybe the best

[50:11] Pimble in the world from a quality standpoint

[50:16] But man, you know, you heard on my last show like look at this

[50:20] But look at this cactus canyon mod like what what a

[50:24] What a disaster it's turning out to be

[50:29] The gift pimp ball brothers credit. They are excited about their games on like stern. Okay, so like

[50:35] Chinch just because you brought it up

[50:37] Of course they they're trying to get everybody into predator. I see them making content left and right. I see them

[50:44] You know really trying to get people excited about the game

[50:47] I don't know how you get people excited about predator without Arnold. I just I give them credit for trying

[50:53] I don't even think they sold 300 units

[50:57] So like I don't know how you recover from that and I as I've been just

[51:02] I don't know there's I have no facts on any of what I'm about to say next but

[51:07] I do think the Pimble brothers have to be in trouble with how bad predator sales are

[51:18] What's wrong with the cactus canyon upgrade? Have you guys where you guys been like the the damn like

[51:26] The thing is like manufactured wrong the usb cables too short the bracket on the left side is not

[51:33] engineered right the switch is not really working properly people that's like disassembly the whole thing is like it just a total

[51:41] It's a total quality control mess and just go into the cactus canyon owners club thread and read all about

[51:47] People trying to fix this damn thing people are trying to like

[51:51] Like shave off metal to get it to fit right

[51:58] Yeah, the usb's like way too tight when you lift the playfield it like gets so super tight that it

[52:04] It can disconnect and it's just again. You don't want

[52:08] Anything to be plugged in with without enough slack. It's just terrible like this like the and they and instead of like

[52:15] Instead of fixing it they passed the headache onto the consumer and now and they knew what they were doing

[52:22] And it's just it's mind boggling mind boggling

[52:37] Yeah, I mean stress

[52:39] Yes, third type is it's okay. I feel like that's like the vibe

[52:43] Um

[52:45] My facebook

[52:47] I haven't oh, sorry guys. I think I can unplug this now. I haven't been reading anything on facebook

[52:54] There we go

[52:57] Spooky Luke what's up brother?

[52:59] Luke, I hope you know, I love you brother my advice was just very simple. I think you guys

[53:05] You know

[53:07] Is there an update Luke on the guys like a game?

[53:10] Was he able to show his bulges properly?

[53:13] um

[53:15] Like and I and I said it earlier Luke if you just join now like

[53:19] it's um

[53:21] You know, pin sides the worst place, but you know as a manufacturer

[53:26] We love that you guys are always hanging with with the crew and with the community and that's half the reason why people love spooky pinball

[53:34] um i can't wait to hang with spooky at uh

[53:37] At at expo

[53:40] I might have to mail something to the hotel because I got a gift for these guys. I'm gonna mail it

[53:46] And put it under my name

[53:49] When do we get to see beetle juice

[53:53] Um, I don't know that's not I maybe maybe there might be a teaser at expo

[54:02] Uh, I I think my prediction will be accurate that

[54:07] Beetle juice will be a will sell out in nine minutes

[54:14] 999 sold out in nine minutes for 9999

[54:23] Just gonna happen just it's just gonna be one of those games man. I feel it

[54:29] I feel it like evil dead look evil deads are trading for like I think some people are buying evil deads with the top of men

[54:36] of like 15 grand bro

[54:40] And they're selling right away. It's not like

[54:42] They're not sitting they're selling right away

[54:46] I think I think everyone realizes

[54:49] That a lot of special stuff is coming out of benton and I when I hear about like the stuff that bent heck is doing with the code on the game and stuff

[54:56] That's never been done before in games and video modes that are super funny

[55:00] You know, you just feel like these guys are just like they get it

[55:04] Like they get it like they

[55:06] They get what we want as

[55:08] grown men

[55:10] That want to have fun we want personality in these games. We want fun mechs

[55:16] We want to laugh. We want to be offended a little bit like they just get it like I feel like this company goes to the bar after work

[55:24] And they just

[55:25] You know like we're doing it. We're doing it

[55:29] I feel like it's staring. They're just anxious. Why aren't the orders where they used to be how do we sell the Costco?

[55:37] Predator issues the price and maybe reliability

[55:42] No, Ajax the predator issues that Arnold's not in it. That's it. That's it

[55:49] You can't make that movie without Arnold. He's like he's so omnipresent in it

[55:55] We'll beatle juice sales send spooky light years into the galaxy

[56:02] Now I think spooky's got a strategy look and it look

[56:05] What spooky's number one challenge will be is

[56:10] With great success and with extraordinary demand the challenge for spooky will be to not get greedy

[56:22] That is it

[56:25] As long as they stay true to their laurels and stay true to their

[56:31] promises to their customers

[56:33] You know when Luke said we might make an sLE one day of a game he made a future game. They're never making more evil debts

[56:41] They're never making more rick and mortis. They're never making more of anything that they made like this is their strategy

[56:47] Unlike Stern who will keep remaking everything to the point where like then nobody wants it

[56:57] Spooky could sell another thousand won't not maybe easily another 500 rick and mortis

[57:06] Heck and you know, I know there was discussion that they were gonna like redesign rick and morti and make it a better game with all that amazing code

[57:14] But they didn't

[57:17] Stern would have

[57:20] Stern really is you know has is is like again that just the pressure to have

[57:26] Monthly volume going out the door has led them a stray on what gave them that volume in the first place

[57:36] And it's been kind of sad to see like their inability to course correct

[57:42] If Stern releases the right game they will sell just like metallic a new Batman remastered

[57:50] Uh JC I 100% agree with you

[57:53] But the problem Stern is having now is they need to get to those great games now

[58:00] And they also need a strategy of like how they

[58:04] Talk about these remastered games and you know, I liked more of like the jaws like

[58:10] We're only gonna make it to the end of the year then we're never making it again like we're gonna make metallic remastered

[58:15] Then we're putting it back in the vault for it when never making it again. They need to start baking in

[58:21] Even just a feeling of

[58:24] exclusivity back in this stuff

[58:26] Stern on

[58:29] Stern on but broken at Costco yesterday shooter rod laying in the wow that sucks

[58:36] I mean lower the rings is no brainer

[58:39] Why go back to an old game when they knew one demonstrates how much you learn every time

[58:45] Well because they don't these games are not

[58:49] They're not Dave

[58:50] El they're not showcasing like all they know as a company like the older games are just better

[58:56] Lord of the Rings is better than Star Wars. It's 21 years old

[59:01] Star Wars came out 21 years after Lord of the Rings and Lord of the Rings has way cooler mechs in it

[59:08] You're talking spooky

[59:16] Well, yeah, I mean

[59:18] Spooky's old games were like not not great. I mean they'll be like go look at like a Rob zombie or like an Alice Cooper

[59:26] I mean Alice Cooper's was better than Rob Zombie, but look the spooky's earlier games were were brick fest

[59:32] There was just like posts everywhere. They were brick fest. They were tight shots

[59:37] They were not enjoyable to shoot evil dead is a pleasure to shoot

[59:42] Scooby-Doo is a fun game to shoot

[59:46] They've they've really gotten better at geometry and understanding

[59:52] you know

[59:53] Like like Rick and Morty's one of the probably one of the worst

[59:57] I actually think Rick and Morty's worse than G and R when it comes to shot geometry like it's just terrible

[01:00:03] So much so that someone had a mod

[01:00:06] A like what's that mob that the Jerry mod that like makes the ball pass through there easier because which is cheating

[01:00:12] I mean it literally is cheating to add that into the game

[01:00:20] Texas chainsaw massacres also great

[01:00:23] Okay

[01:00:28] The Jerry ramp

[01:00:30] Any idea who has the gremlins license? I would say spooky pinball does unless franchi wants to say they don't

[01:00:38] You know franchi putting that teaser on the box. Come on

[01:00:41] Come on

[01:00:47] How's everybody doing this Saturday sorry for the kids interrupting um it happens

[01:00:54] I mean I love I mean this we're still going here with G and R concert like this crazy like what's in that game

[01:01:00] Is this November? Maraine what is this?

[01:01:05] Yeah, it's super cool

[01:01:08] Um

[01:01:10] I just wish they would have synced up the light show at the end like Denon and then like it no nothing synced up

[01:01:15] It's just it's not lazy

[01:01:19] Oh, I need to go to the gym today. I just feel a little like I need it to stay cows

[01:01:24] Oh

[01:01:26] Anyway gang um

[01:01:28] We're gonna cut the show. I think this has been a fun one

[01:01:32] Want to thank everybody for your support. I saw um

[01:01:36] I think there was some dude on pinside being like I don't know how to unsubscribe

[01:01:39] Like if anyone wants to unsubscribe from grenade is bitball podcast

[01:01:42] Just you email me and I will I will unsubscribe you um

[01:01:46] We've had a lot of great

[01:01:49] banter on the chats recently. We've I think the shows have been really fun. I don't understand

[01:01:55] I think there's a lot of people the stern army people are just I think very threatened by my show

[01:02:01] I don't I don't understand that some some dude on pins. I was complaining and and saying that

[01:02:07] My shows are an hour long and I don't understand that my podcasts are 20 minutes long at most

[01:02:14] I haven't done an hour podcast in years

[01:02:17] I don't think any pinball podcast should be an hour or more. I understand why some people do that

[01:02:22] I understand too that some people only do one every week or two

[01:02:26] And I guess if you add up all my shows, but the reason why my shows are 20 minutes is

[01:02:31] I try to capture sort of like what's the latest news

[01:02:35] throughout the week

[01:02:37] Whether it's code updates whether it's

[01:02:40] consumer problems with the game whether it's

[01:02:43] cactus canyon mods not going well, you know, like there's a lot of hours and time that goes into it. I also want to

[01:02:49] publicly hear on my Saturday show

[01:02:52] apologize for

[01:02:54] incorrectly

[01:02:56] attributing something to Jason nap that he did not say Jason never said

[01:03:02] That I was sharing fake photos of big bang bar and I said that in my free show which I deleted that comment from the show

[01:03:11] So only people who heard it like first thing heard it, but Jason and I talked

[01:03:17] um, and I miss miss red

[01:03:21] Or I attributed it to him because I read something on pinsod

[01:03:24] Where someone said that like even Jason nap is saying canators photos are fake and I was like oh, I should not have

[01:03:30] Just taken that again pinsod at face value. I should have reached out to Jason

[01:03:35] And asked him or even just I was lazy like I didn't read

[01:03:41] His story fully and he never said it so sorry Jason, you know, I love your site. I love your news

[01:03:48] He won't post photos. He won't post my leak photos if I stick

[01:03:53] Other people's faces all over them, but I love watermarking all my stuff with like Chris Turner and

[01:04:00] And Ralph and you know all of us, you know carry like I just think it's funny like canada

[01:04:07] Canada leaks things in ways that should make you laugh and I don't like because again

[01:04:11] I think I think way too many people take this hobby way too seriously and I think

[01:04:17] It's strange to me because how cool that is man like hold on a second

[01:04:48] I

[01:04:56] Mean I just

[01:05:01] Super cool it is a box of lights

[01:05:06] Um

[01:05:09] How you guys doing

[01:05:11] I

[01:05:13] Hope spooky as groundlands like I don't know. I know spookies next few games are gonna be phenomenal

[01:05:19] Pedreti I bet I bet I'm not I'm Pedreti and ricks holiday

[01:05:25] Mail or list. I don't think I'm gonna get the holiday card from those guys this year

[01:05:31] It's funny. It's funny. I love melvin man melvin and I talk like every day and I

[01:05:37] I'm glad all the Alice toppers are gonna go out and they're going out and Alice's are going out the door

[01:05:45] Melvin's a an awesome dude. We need more dudes like Melvin and Pimbal

[01:05:49] Just more straight shooters that are super talented and know how to get stuff done

[01:05:54] And the best thing that could happen to back to the future is if Melvin Williams

[01:05:59] Gets more deeply involved with the game

[01:06:03] He knows what he's doing like he does like he's

[01:06:07] You really got to see his big bang bar remake like I

[01:06:11] It's just stunning and so then he hands this like stunning remake to Pedreti who are like ignoring

[01:06:19] The enhancements he's making

[01:06:23] What will you buy next uh beetle juice?

[01:06:28] Um, that is that is absolutely

[01:06:31] Absolutely getting bought by canada

[01:06:34] I have the room waiting in the garage

[01:06:38] I um, you know, but like when I go to Expo in a couple weeks

[01:06:42] I'm I'm looking forward to jumping on everything like I would also just love

[01:06:47] For this guy making the home brew version of

[01:06:51] Big trouble in little china to just make too

[01:06:56] And I will pay handsomely for it. I just I need that game. I need it

[01:07:03] It's been my favorite

[01:07:05] That in the fifth element are the two

[01:07:09] You know if you ever want to make a home brew game and uh, I mean I I'd pay tens of thousands of dollars is to have one you know

[01:07:18] Big trouble in little china and the fifth element

[01:07:22] I don't think I could ever get more excited about two pinball themes and then third would be

[01:07:29] Akira and g1 transformers

[01:07:31] I mean those are my dreams like g1 transformers the movie

[01:07:35] Akira

[01:07:40] Big trouble in little china and the fifth element

[01:07:44] I just I just would love

[01:07:48] I would love those pins

[01:07:51] You know, and I think of like john wayak or star you know starwarsamy is just kind of like I don't know

[01:07:55] You know like the mandalorian trailer just did nothing for me

[01:07:59] The

[01:08:01] The mandalorian trailer just looks so

[01:08:04] Wah

[01:08:06] What would you put in an akira playfield? I mean come on man

[01:08:09] Like you got to have tetsu on the throne and have like kind of like the magneto multi ball

[01:08:15] Like he's got to be able to force grab the balls with his magnet powers

[01:08:19] You then definitely have to have like

[01:08:23] All like neo-tokyo under that glass and you need to have kind of like tron

[01:08:29] You need to have like the lights trailing like the bikes

[01:08:32] Like moving around the plastic ramps. So it feels like you're

[01:08:39] You're driving, you know, canada's bike through the city and you know how they do the lighting effect like you could do that

[01:08:45] You could have the light move

[01:08:47] Around and then the you know and playing that iconic song

[01:08:52] Canada's theme which is being sane

[01:08:55] And then you also, you know, definitely could have like the

[01:08:59] The the the stuffed animal that comes to life as a bash toy

[01:09:08] Um, but yeah, and I think you could have soul the um, you know the

[01:09:14] The weapon that fires down. I think you make that the topper

[01:09:18] I think you make that the topper and I think you

[01:09:20] Have it shine a light down on the game like just so much you could do

[01:09:28] Um

[01:09:29] But yeah, I think it's more about

[01:09:31] neo-tokyo under glass and just really making it feel like

[01:09:36] You are in the neo-tokyo world

[01:09:40] And I don't know, you know, I just

[01:09:43] So and when I when I look at Star Wars gang, I really see

[01:09:47] It really just looks like a Costco toy. It looks like a 5,000 dollar Costco game

[01:09:54] And I mean I get it like it looks better in person. It just it just

[01:09:59] I'm talking about what's under that glass just looks cheap

[01:10:03] Kib-john wik another shot

[01:10:06] Michael why I think I've played John wik a bunch of times and I just

[01:10:13] I'm so underwhelmed by again like the stuff in it like I don't it just feels

[01:10:18] plasticky and I don't know like

[01:10:22] That car that pops out just seems cheap. I don't I don't know John wik just

[01:10:28] And you're right like I haven't played it much, but it just it just doesn't click with me

[01:10:32] I just want I kind of want to just like walk away from it

[01:10:35] I

[01:10:40] Everybody

[01:11:39] Um, and we've been watching this really great Japanese show. We have I think we're in the last episode about a Japanese

[01:11:46] Shoemaker that gets into making running shoes. You should watch it. It's an amazing show. I think it's called like

[01:11:54] So so so choo or so so so cool. I forget the name

[01:12:00] Um, it's on Netflix. So if you just Google Japanese shoemaker

[01:12:04] So good. It's so good and you know, I love watching Japanese programming midnight diners. Obviously my favorite

[01:12:11] The reason why I love watching Japanese and Korean shows is the um is the subtitles force you to watch

[01:12:19] Like you can't do a screen. You're not the strat you're like you're in it. You're in it and I think everything else

[01:12:25] You know, we just always open up a second screen or you're just not paying full attention

[01:12:30] So have a great

[01:12:33] Saturday
