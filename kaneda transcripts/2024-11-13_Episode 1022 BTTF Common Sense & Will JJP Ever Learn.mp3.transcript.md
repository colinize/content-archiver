[00:00] I said, My My My I Once Been Two Shabby My My My I Once Been Two Shabby

[00:12] I Said I Said I Said I Said I Said I Said I Said I Said I

[00:16] Welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:19] I'm slowly getting my voice back.

[00:22] Welcome Happy Wednesday.

[00:24] What are we gonna talk about?

[00:25] Are we gonna see Cuphead from American Pinball

[00:28] at the end of this week?

[00:30] We are looking forward to a new game.

[00:32] Always looking forward to a new game.

[00:34] A new pin day is always a good day.

[00:37] There's been no teasers, there's been no lead-ups.

[00:41] So if they're gonna do this,

[00:42] they really are gonna create a moment of surprise

[00:46] and hopefully delight.

[00:47] We're all gonna be surprised

[00:49] that they just dropped it into the pinball world.

[00:51] Will it be a delightful game?

[00:54] We shall see.

[00:55] What I wanna talk about on this episode

[00:57] of Canadian Pinball Podcast,

[00:59] I really wanna focus on a few things.

[01:00] I wanna focus on Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:03] Are they finally gonna learn a lesson?

[01:06] It's been 11 years now, 12 years now.

[01:09] They're on their like 10th game

[01:11] and it's not selling at all.

[01:14] And I wonder what is next for this company?

[01:17] We're gonna talk about the Godzilla

[01:19] black and white accessories.

[01:21] We're gonna talk about X-Men thread

[01:23] and how it's become just a troubleshoot thread

[01:26] and what that means for this game moving forward.

[01:29] And I wanna start out this episode

[01:32] by talking about Dutch Pinball and back to the future.

[01:35] Some of you out there have a hard time comprehending

[01:39] what I said on my last show.

[01:41] So let me break it down real simple.

[01:43] And by the way, I've been reading Pinside

[01:46] and nobody is giving me credit

[01:48] for delivering this information.

[01:51] And I don't know what's up with that.

[01:52] But here's the deal everybody.

[01:54] It makes total sense why Barry over at Dutch Pinball

[01:58] has been talking to someone

[02:00] to help him manufacture this game.

[02:02] Remember, they're making 10 big Lebowski's a week.

[02:07] Think about that for a minute.

[02:09] That's 500 games a year.

[02:12] Stern Pinball can make 800 games a week.

[02:17] Now throw into the mix, back to the future,

[02:20] a game in which you're gonna get 10,000 orders easily.

[02:24] So if Dutch Pinball were to make this game

[02:27] on their current schedule and they get 10,000 orders

[02:31] and they make 500 games a week,

[02:34] that means it would take Dutch Pinball

[02:37] as they currently stand 20 years to make these games.

[02:42] I mean, just think about that for a minute.

[02:44] 20 years to make 10,000 units of Back to the Future.

[02:49] Now look, I don't think they would take 10,000 orders

[02:52] but you get my point.

[02:54] If Stern Pinball were to make Back to the Future

[02:57] and they got 10,000 orders

[03:00] and they're making somewhere in the vicinity

[03:02] of 2,500 games a month,

[03:05] they could make all the games in four to five months.

[03:09] And you know they could do it and you know they would do it.

[03:12] So just think about that for a minute.

[03:13] Also, I think people are under the illusion

[03:17] that Barry and the team over at Dutch Pinball

[03:20] have some incredible working whitewood of this game

[03:25] that features magical mechs that are even better

[03:28] than what you're seeing in the big Lebowski.

[03:32] And I'm here to tell you right now,

[03:33] there is no such probably whitewood

[03:36] that is elevated what they can make over the big Lebowski

[03:40] and features all of the Back to the Future

[03:42] awesomeness that you would expect.

[03:45] A DeLorean with doors that open up.

[03:47] A clock tower, a hoverboard,

[03:50] a Pepsi Perfect that comes up from underneath the bar.

[03:53] A wild gunslinger video mode in the game.

[03:56] I'm telling you, like if you think

[03:58] that there's like a working game behind a closed door

[04:02] that they've been working on for years,

[04:04] you are sorely mistaken.

[04:06] So when I said that Stern Pinball

[04:08] would like to give this IP to Keith Elwyn and team

[04:12] to make the game, they would be able

[04:15] to make this game faster

[04:17] than Dutch Pinball would be able to make it.

[04:19] They have more resources.

[04:21] Keith Elwyn is much more prolific.

[04:23] And let's also be honest here.

[04:25] I mean, Barry had some help when he made the big Lebowski.

[04:29] Yop played a big role in the development of the game.

[04:32] It wasn't just Barry and has Barry replaced Yop

[04:37] with someone else who's incredible at pinball design.

[04:40] Is he surrounded by mechanical engineers

[04:43] that know how to make mechanical pinball magic?

[04:46] What I've heard through the rumor mail

[04:48] is that Back to the Future has been designed

[04:50] but more in a digital sense.

[04:52] There's not a physical OMG game that's just ready to go

[04:56] and they're just putting the polishing touches on it.

[04:59] And so that is why it also makes sense

[05:02] to have someone come in and help out

[05:04] on the development of the game.

[05:06] Now I've heard people say, well, why would Stern do this?

[05:08] They passed on this game.

[05:10] And why would they go back and try to make this game now

[05:13] and give Barry a royalty on every game sold?

[05:17] You have to be a knucklehead not to realize

[05:20] why they would do it.

[05:21] Because they would sell 10,000 or more units.

[05:25] And even if they give Barry 500 bucks per game,

[05:28] they're still gonna make a lot of money

[05:30] on every single game.

[05:31] Here's the thing that's crazy about pinball.

[05:33] So let's say they give Barry $500 per game sold.

[05:39] They're giving distributors and dealers more money than that

[05:43] on every game sold.

[05:45] And imagine if you're a Stern pinball.

[05:46] Why don't you just sell the game direct?

[05:48] Imagine if they just sold Back to the Future

[05:50] direct to customers.

[05:52] Do you need dealers and distros

[05:54] to create demand?

[05:55] No.

[05:55] Do you need dealers and distros

[05:57] to help you move any of these units?

[05:59] No.

[06:00] I don't understand.

[06:01] I don't understand.

[06:02] When you say Stern has no incentive

[06:04] to give Barry a royalty per game,

[06:07] remember they're giving a much bigger royalty per game

[06:10] to every single dealer and distro

[06:12] that really doesn't have to do any work whatsoever.

[06:16] And a title this popular needs no marketing help whatsoever.

[06:20] All right, and then I also heard the argument like,

[06:23] well, Keith Elwin's working on stuff

[06:25] so it makes absolutely no sense.

[06:27] Of course, Keith Elwin's King Kong is done.

[06:30] It's been done for a while.

[06:32] He's working on another game already.

[06:34] And he is very prolific.

[06:36] As I said, this guy eats, sleeps, dreams, pinball.

[06:40] Stern pinball would easily, if they got this IP,

[06:44] they could shuffle some things around

[06:47] so Keith Elwin could free up to make this game.

[06:51] Remember, this would be the biggest Stern title

[06:54] since Ghostbusters.

[06:56] This would be probably the biggest Stern title of all time.

[07:00] And for some of you who think it wouldn't be, you're wrong.

[07:04] Now, to me, the big question mark are two things.

[07:07] Will they be able to get enough of the assets

[07:10] from Universal to make the game the right way?

[07:13] If they do not feel that confident in that,

[07:16] then they won't wanna make the game.

[07:19] Then Jersey Jack will probably swoop in

[07:22] and make the game with muted clips

[07:24] and you'll get some beautiful looking back to the future

[07:27] that won't have everything in it that you really want.

[07:30] I know for Stern to make this game,

[07:32] they're gonna wanna make it right.

[07:34] And the big question mark is whether or not Barry

[07:37] is gonna make a move here.

[07:39] Does he wanna personally be famous

[07:41] for bringing back to the future into the pinball world?

[07:44] And then what does it mean for the future of Dutch pinball?

[07:47] Are they gonna become more of a boutique company?

[07:50] Of course, that's all they are, right?

[07:52] There's no way out of it.

[07:53] You can't just go from making 500 games a year

[07:57] to making thousands of games a year.

[07:59] You know, I think people forget this,

[08:01] that Alice in Wonderland kind of is saving Dutch pinball.

[08:05] Think about it.

[08:06] The demand for Lebowski is up.

[08:09] Like it's over.

[08:10] There's no more people ordering big Lebowski's.

[08:13] And then what is next?

[08:14] Back to the future was not ready.

[08:16] So imagine if you're Barry

[08:18] and you don't have back to the future ready

[08:20] and demand on Lebowski is over,

[08:23] what do you do for the next year?

[08:24] What do you do?

[08:25] How do you pay those employees?

[08:27] How do you pay the rent?

[08:28] How do you keep the lights on?

[08:30] I'm telling you right now,

[08:31] if it wasn't for Alice's adventures in Wonderland

[08:34] and back to the future not being ready,

[08:37] that probably would have spelled the N for Dutch pinball.

[08:41] This company does not have outside annuity.

[08:44] They don't have a billionaire backer.

[08:46] They don't have any other money coming in.

[08:48] So they need to keep that line going.

[08:50] We've learned this, right?

[08:51] We've all learned this collectively.

[08:54] If you're a manufacturing company

[08:55] and your line is not going,

[08:57] you're losing money every single day.

[08:59] And I think it would shock some of you

[09:01] how much money on a daily basis these companies would lose.

[09:06] I would say in the ballpark,

[09:08] if you think about all the salaries,

[09:10] the rent, the equipment,

[09:12] I think you're looking at somewhere

[09:13] between three to $400,000 a month,

[09:16] Dutch pinball would be losing

[09:18] if they didn't have another game ready to go.

[09:20] So it's good that they have Alice ready to go.

[09:23] Now I think the smart move,

[09:25] and this is just me,

[09:26] Barry Inks-a-Deal gets a royalty on back to the future,

[09:30] makes all the Alice's and then thinks about

[09:33] what is my next boutique game I'm going to make.

[09:36] I would love for Dutch pinball

[09:38] to make more licensed theme games.

[09:40] I would, I don't want them to just make

[09:43] what Melvins got in John Papadook's locker.

[09:46] I want them to make other stuff.

[09:48] I think they should look at some other themes

[09:50] that are out there.

[09:51] And I think if they make, you know,

[09:53] follow suit with barrels and spooky.

[09:56] If Dutch pinball makes like a thousand or less

[10:00] of a licensed game

[10:02] and puts their magic into the games,

[10:05] they're going to do just fine.

[10:08] I'm a little worried though.

[10:09] I'm a little worried that they don't really have a plan.

[10:13] Like back to the future should be much further along

[10:16] than it is Alice kind of save them.

[10:20] What's next?

[10:21] I think a lot of this has to be going on in Barry's head

[10:26] and for the people over there

[10:27] because you don't want to have any period of time

[10:31] in which your next game is not ready to go.

[10:34] When labyrinth is done,

[10:36] barrels his next game will be on the line immediately.

[10:39] Same thing with spooky.

[10:41] When Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw are done,

[10:45] Evil Dead will be on the line the next day.

[10:48] There's not going to be like months waiting,

[10:51] burning money, lighting money on fire.

[10:54] So yeah, so a lot of you out there,

[10:56] I don't understand why it's hard to comprehend

[10:59] how easy it would be for Stern to do this,

[11:02] how embarrassed Stern is that they let this IP go

[11:06] and how much money there is to make

[11:08] even if they cut Barry a royalty on every game sold.

[11:13] It could be a win-win.

[11:15] I saw some people out there saying it would be a lose-lose.

[11:19] No, no, no, no, no, it would be a win-win.

[11:21] All right, so there's that.

[11:22] When is Jersey Jack Pinball gonna learn?

[11:25] I am in the Avatar Owners Club thread right now.

[11:30] Guess how many pages the Avatar Owners Club thread is

[11:35] as of today.

[11:37] This game has been out for a few months now.

[11:40] It's been streamed.

[11:41] The code is pretty much done.

[11:44] There's nothing new coming to this game

[11:46] that's gonna change people's minds.

[11:48] The Avatar Owners Club is only five pages long.

[11:54] There is less enthusiasm for this game

[11:58] than Elton John, then the Godfather, then Toy Story 4.

[12:03] This game is shaping up to be

[12:05] one of the softest launches in the history of Jersey Jack.

[12:10] And how are we here?

[12:12] After 11 years, when is Jersey Jack Pinball

[12:16] gonna actually listen to feedback?

[12:18] And there's one thing they have to do now.

[12:21] They have to change who's making decisions.

[12:25] They keep the same players on the field every single game

[12:31] and they expect different results.

[12:35] Jack Guinari, we love that you started this company

[12:38] but you've made some of the worst marketing decisions

[12:42] for titles in a row.

[12:44] You have set your company up for failure

[12:47] and nobody seemingly had any power to say,

[12:50] what are we doing?

[12:51] Why are we making Toy Story 4?

[12:54] Why are we making the Godfather?

[12:56] Why is it Elton John and heck, why Avatar?

[12:59] This is not a popular theme right now

[13:02] with the Pinball buying demographic.

[13:04] Culturally, it's never hit.

[13:07] James Cameron wanted this to be his Star Wars, it's not.

[13:11] There are so many other themes

[13:13] that would have sold so much better.

[13:16] Heck, big trouble in little China would have sold more.

[13:20] Karate Kid, heck, Bloodsport.

[13:22] I mean this, if you just made Bloodsport,

[13:25] there's more people into that than Avatar.

[13:28] I mean it, within this buying demographic.

[13:30] The last Starfighter, I know,

[13:32] write this weird niche movie from the 80s.

[13:36] Even that, even that, makes people more emotionally connected.

[13:40] I'm just a kid from the trailer park.

[13:42] If that's all you think you are,

[13:43] that's all you're ever gonna be.

[13:45] Even that is a more memorable line

[13:47] than anything you hear in Avatar.

[13:49] So what now?

[13:50] Does this just become what Jersey Jack is?

[13:53] You know, this company that is owned by Brett and Leonard

[13:57] and Jack's sort of like an employee now

[13:59] making all these marketing decisions.

[14:01] Ken Cromwell, it's not his fault.

[14:03] He has nothing to work with.

[14:05] He's got nothing to work with.

[14:06] He did his job.

[14:07] He invited the media over.

[14:09] He was a gracious host.

[14:11] Tom Capara over there did a great job

[14:13] walking us through the factory.

[14:14] So did Eric Minier.

[14:16] You know, Mark Sidon is a really nice guy.

[14:18] They did a great job.

[14:20] They did everything they could

[14:21] to invite people over there and see their latest game.

[14:24] The only problem is their latest game just isn't magical.

[14:28] It's just not creating any moments of wow.

[14:32] And in the current pinball marketplace, it's a lead balloon.

[14:35] If you bought one of these Avatar CEs

[14:38] which seemingly nobody wants to admit, they bought it.

[14:41] Right? It's so weird to me.

[14:42] How are there only five pages of an Avatar owners club?

[14:48] Didn't some of you order it?

[14:49] Right? If they're gonna make a thousand of these things,

[14:52] how is there not at least like 50 pages

[14:55] of people just discussing the game?

[14:58] I mean, no one's even discussing the LE

[15:00] which is out there and news flash all you CEO owners.

[15:04] That's pretty much the exact same game you're gonna get.

[15:08] If you think this UV ink that doesn't really work

[15:12] is gonna change your experience with Avatar,

[15:15] you're solely mistaken.

[15:17] So after you're done looking at your beautiful topper

[15:20] and your beautiful armor, what are you left with?

[15:23] I'm telling you, you're left with a game

[15:25] that's gonna lose you $5,000 in one year.

[15:29] And look, the next game for me,

[15:30] I would love to say everything rides on the next game.

[15:33] I think this is just a prime example

[15:36] of what happens when a company has no consequences,

[15:40] when a company has no accountability

[15:43] and nobody is seemingly responsible.

[15:46] We've got now four games in a row

[15:48] that have been sales sort of flops

[15:50] that have been underwhelming, that have been disappointing.

[15:54] The second hand market on each of those games is abysmal

[15:57] and nobody's accountable.

[15:59] Nobody got fired, right?

[16:00] Nobody got fired.

[16:01] Like if I walked into my job

[16:03] and handed four terrible ideas in a row

[16:06] into our biggest client and we needed a hit,

[16:10] I would be let go.

[16:11] But everybody at Jersey Jack is too comfortable.

[16:14] They're all acting too secure because the money's there.

[16:18] And in the end, what Brett is gonna realize,

[16:20] what he's gonna realize,

[16:21] I know they have a lot of hyperbole

[16:23] when they talk to us when we went over there,

[16:26] but in the end, he's gonna realize

[16:28] that they did not succeed in creating games

[16:32] that have legacy, creating games that are masterpieces,

[16:36] creating games that people are gonna look back on very fondly.

[16:39] And they have had every opportunity to do so.

[16:43] And look, only five pages of people

[16:46] that will admit to being an owner of Avatar.

[16:50] The game is done already.

[16:51] It's dead on arrival.

[16:53] And now we wait for February or March

[16:56] when we're gonna see Harry Potter.

[16:58] Is it gonna be everything we expect it to be?

[17:00] If history has shown us anything,

[17:03] Jersey Jack expectations have always been very high

[17:06] with each new game and they've underwhelmed us.

[17:09] I don't know, it's the same people, right?

[17:11] They didn't bring in a new designer.

[17:13] This is not gonna be a Steve Ritchie game.

[17:15] You know, Eric's had enthusiasm

[17:16] around guns and roses and pirates.

[17:18] Godfather was abysmal.

[17:20] So we'll see what happens, but I'm just sort of like, why?

[17:24] Why can't Jersey Jack get its act together?

[17:27] Why can't it figure stuff out?

[17:29] Why can't they make pinball moves

[17:31] that are adding more magic and moments of wow into this hobby?

[17:35] All right, so speaking of moments of wow, like wow.

[17:39] Some more Godzilla black and white accessories

[17:42] that are kind of black and white.

[17:45] For some reason, it's really hard

[17:46] when Stern tries to do something in black and white

[17:50] to actually remove the color.

[17:51] Because remember, black and white are not colors.

[17:54] The colors are the yellow, the red, the green,

[17:57] all the other stuff in the game.

[17:59] And so yesterday they released the accessories for Godzilla.

[18:03] There's inner art blades, there's armor, there's a topper,

[18:06] there's a shooter rod, and I think if you buy it all,

[18:09] you're somewhere in the vicinity of like a couple thousand

[18:13] dollars extra to make your black and white Godzilla

[18:17] a whole bunch of sepia, a whole bunch of grays

[18:21] and whites and blacks, not all of them sync up

[18:24] with each other.

[18:25] And I don't know, you know, I just don't know what

[18:26] to tell you, I saw it yesterday.

[18:28] And for some reason, I think the topper is more black

[18:32] and white than the photos.

[18:33] And it just makes me wonder what goes on

[18:36] with these marketing departments.

[18:38] You got a black and white game.

[18:40] Why are we gonna show the topper with all these colors?

[18:43] Why is it gonna look like it's blue here

[18:45] and it's yellow over here and it's green over here?

[18:48] Black and white.

[18:49] I just wanna see black and white.

[18:51] I don't wanna see all this other stuff.

[18:53] But I think the launch of this game, and I think, you know,

[18:57] people not being happy with the translate coloring

[19:00] has never been resolved.

[19:02] And you guys know this, right?

[19:04] Sometimes a game can just have like one headache issue.

[19:09] And because of that, nobody wants to deal with it.

[19:12] And I think that's what's happened

[19:13] with Godzilla black and white.

[19:15] It just like felt like a compromised game.

[19:18] Like it should have been an LE and then it wasn't.

[19:21] They should have been able to sync up all the tones

[19:23] in the game and they didn't.

[19:25] You know a couple other games I've been looking at recently

[19:27] is like John Wick owners, right?

[19:29] John Wick, people who own the game, hardly anybody,

[19:32] but people who do own it are now saying,

[19:35] hey, maybe it's more fun than X-Men.

[19:37] Hey, maybe this game is great.

[19:38] Hey, this game is something I'm gonna own forever.

[19:40] Well, you better wanna own John Wick LE forever

[19:44] because I love that people think they're only gonna lose

[19:47] $3,000 on their John Wick LE.

[19:49] I guarantee you by the end of this year, 2025,

[19:53] because this year is almost over.

[19:54] By the end of next year, 2025,

[19:56] you're gonna see John Wick LEs for $8 to $8,500.

[20:00] You're gonna lose about $5,000 on that game.

[20:02] We're just in a different pinball world now, people.

[20:05] You know, a game that launches with no demand.

[20:08] A game that launches with incomplete code.

[20:11] And also a game that launches with so much controversy

[20:14] and apathy the way John Wick did.

[20:16] And no one cares.

[20:18] Nobody's gonna buy it.

[20:19] Nobody's gonna buy it new and box.

[20:21] And nobody's gonna care if you own one.

[20:24] They're not gonna care about your praising the game

[20:27] because you're clearly biased.

[20:29] And I think it's gonna just be one of these games

[20:32] where people will play it on location.

[20:34] It'll still have people curious like Venom,

[20:37] but most people are just not gonna buy it.

[20:39] I think it was a big misstep for Stern.

[20:42] I think they learned a lesson.

[20:43] I think they're gonna lean more into nostalgia

[20:46] and not try to do current IP

[20:49] where they think this is gonna bring in

[20:50] like new audiences into pinball.

[20:52] And all it really did was alienate most of the people

[20:55] who buy Stern machines.

[20:57] All right, let me just close this show with X-Men

[21:00] and I'm in the thread.

[21:02] And I wish the thread wasn't what the thread is.

[21:05] The thread now is a troubleshoot thread.

[21:08] And that is where you don't wanna end up, right?

[21:10] The game's only been out for like two to three months

[21:13] and everyone's talking about issues

[21:16] and how to fix the game.

[21:17] And if there's anything you don't wanna ever be

[21:21] is in a position where the things you're trying to fix

[21:24] are hardware, right?

[21:25] If it's software, that's one thing.

[21:26] Everybody will be patient

[21:28] and wait for a game's software to get good.

[21:32] But if people are pulling the game apart,

[21:35] drilling playfields, having to like bend wire forms,

[21:39] having to try to add washers here and washers there

[21:43] and the geometry's not right

[21:45] and the auto plunger doesn't work

[21:48] and the sentinel hands are problematic

[21:50] and the ball's getting hung up here.

[21:52] It's just like when you open up a thread like that,

[21:55] that is the ultimate red flag

[21:58] because for anyone out there thinking about grabbing one,

[22:02] you know they haven't fixed any of that stuff at the factory.

[22:06] It is the easiest sort of red flag

[22:10] to just kind of like avoid the game right now.

[22:13] And again, we're in a pinball market now

[22:16] where there's just no room for this.

[22:18] This game clearly needed more time to be developed

[22:21] but they didn't lower the price, right?

[22:23] So it's like for 13 grand for an LE

[22:25] and you've got these issues

[22:26] and remember they made the LEs first.

[22:29] Like that seemed like a good move until they had issues.

[22:32] Now it doesn't seem like a good move

[22:34] and there's just no excuse for this, right?

[22:36] There's no excuse at these prices.

[22:38] Nothing should ever be rushed to market.

[22:41] It just should never have happened and it happened

[22:43] and now here we are.

[22:45] And you know, I was watching this video

[22:47] about the watch collecting industry

[22:49] and it made me think a lot about pinball

[22:51] and the ultimate summary from this guy was

[22:55] what's happened in a lot of the watch world

[22:57] is some of the brands that lost their second hand value.

[23:01] There's like a Frank Mueller watch.

[23:03] It's like the company did weird stuff.

[23:05] It didn't want people scalping its products

[23:07] or adding diamonds to its watches.

[23:09] So it started to go after the dealers

[23:11] and then all of a sudden nobody wanted to buy one

[23:15] because there wasn't much resale value on it.

[23:17] And then all of a sudden the entire market

[23:20] on a Frank Mueller watch collapsed

[23:23] and it got me thinking about pinball.

[23:25] How long do we think we're gonna go

[23:27] if there's no second hand market that's healthy

[23:30] on a Stern game, on a Jersey Jack game,

[23:33] on a spooky game, on a CGC Pulp Fiction,

[23:37] if everyone's buying pinball and losing thousands of dollars

[23:41] on every single game you buy,

[23:44] how long do you think it's gonna last?

[23:46] I mean, there is no healthy second hand market

[23:50] in pinball anymore.

[23:52] Across the board, only Metallica LE, one game.

[23:56] One game has a healthy second hand return for the buyer.

[24:00] And so now pinball is the most it's ever been.

[24:03] Everybody's losing so much money on every game.

[24:08] The world is inflated.

[24:09] Everyone's spending a lot more money

[24:11] on things they really need.

[24:13] I'm worried about this hobby.

[24:15] I'm worried about this hobby.

[24:17] Pinball prices are inflated

[24:19] so they're never gonna come down.

[24:20] This is it, like they're never gonna come down.

[24:23] The rest of the world,

[24:23] you're gonna start to see prices correct.

[24:26] Hopefully, right?

[24:27] Hopefully, maybe not hopefully.

[24:29] But yet pinball is stuck here

[24:32] in the super expensive realm,

[24:34] something you don't really need.

[24:36] And if you buy it new and box,

[24:38] you're gonna lose thousands of dollars.

[24:39] I mean, I don't have to be a rocket scientist

[24:42] or an economist to tell you

[24:44] that's a recipe for disaster.

[24:47] Someone needs to wake up either lower prices

[24:50] and sell directly to consumers.

[24:52] I mean that, someone needs to wake up and say,

[24:54] hey, if we just sell all of our games

[24:57] directly to consumers,

[24:59] I can pass on those savings to the customer.

[25:01] Why does spooky need distros to sell 700 games?

[25:05] Why?

[25:05] They could just sell them all directly

[25:07] and sell them for much less money.

[25:09] Why does Stern need to sell directly?

[25:11] Why does Stern need distributors

[25:13] to sell back to the future?

[25:14] Why?

[25:15] I'm just saying, something's gotta give somewhere.

[25:18] Something's gotta give somewhere.

[25:19] And it's a weird place now too,

[25:21] because I don't even think we need to cut out the distros.

[25:24] It's just weird now because they're losing too.

[25:27] Like nobody's winning now.

[25:28] The distros are sitting on unsold inventory.

[25:31] They're not happy.

[25:32] Distros wish that LEDs were $85 or $9,000.

[25:35] They don't want them to be $13 or $15,000.

[25:38] They're not making that much more.

[25:39] And yet it's that much harder now for them to sell games.

[25:43] It's that much harder for them

[25:45] to attract people into pinball.

[25:47] And then they're sitting on all these unsold pros

[25:49] and premiums.

[25:50] They're not happy.

[25:52] Consumers are not happy.

[25:53] Manufacturers have to be nervous.

[25:56] All of it, all of it needs to be reevaluated.

[25:59] And I don't know why nobody's doing it.

[26:01] And like we're the only pinball podcast

[26:02] that like kind of talks about this on a weekly basis.

[26:05] Everyone else, how can you avoid this?

[26:07] How can you avoid this?

[26:08] I don't understand it.

[26:09] Everybody, thank you so much for tuning in today.

[26:12] We'll be back.

[26:13] We cup head in a couple of days.

[26:14] We shall see.

[26:15] Canada out.

[26:16] Ma, ma, ma.

[26:18] I once been twice shy.

[26:23] Ma, ma, ma.

[26:25] I once been twice shy, baby.

[26:29] I said, ma, ma, ma.

[26:32] I once been twice shy, baby.

[26:37] Ma, ma, ma.

[26:39] I once been twice shy, baby.

[26:43] Ma, ma, ma.

[26:46] I once been twice shy, baby.
