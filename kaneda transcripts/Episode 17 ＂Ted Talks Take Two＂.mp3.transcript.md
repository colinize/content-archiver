[00:00] What happened to Yamma?

[00:02] He asked him if he was really the tetsule that we knew.

[00:05] Then after that...

[00:07] Oh, I'll miss you!

[00:09] You are physically repulsive, intellectually retarded, vulgar, insensitive, selfish, stupid.

[00:13] You have no taste, allows you sensitive, you know.

[00:18] You are physically repulsive, intellectually retarded, vulgar, insensitive, selfish, stupid.

[00:22] You have no taste, allows you sensitive, you know.

[00:25] You have no taste, allows you sensitive, you know.

[00:28] You have no taste, allows you sensitive, you know.

[00:30] And you smell.

[00:31] Yeah, I've been called every name in the book this week.

[00:34] It's been kind of funny to read it all.

[00:37] Just how heated people are.

[00:40] Welcome to episode 17 of the Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[00:44] And I want to, before I air the Ted interview, which is awesome, you guys are really going to enjoy it.

[00:49] I just want it to sort of address what's gone on this week.

[00:52] And it's been sort of like a world one week.

[00:54] After being banned by Pennside, I put up a podcast responding to it.

[00:59] And I have to thank all you guys, because it was above and beyond the most listened to podcast I've ever had by two folds.

[01:07] So, you know, I think a lot of people were just curious to see how I would respond.

[01:11] Yeah, I'm not upset.

[01:13] I'm really not, because at the end of the day, I walk away feeling that I was completely singled out.

[01:21] And it's true. If you read that post, there is nothing that I posted that was banworthy in the Hobbit post that I put up.

[01:28] And it's not what I'm saying that people have a problem with.

[01:31] It's my right to say it that people have a problem with.

[01:34] I find it funny that the real biggest troll on Pennside completely was on a mission to shut me down.

[01:42] And completely said I didn't have any right to post that.

[01:45] That that was such a horrible thing to post.

[01:47] And then what does he do? He goes and takes the exact same post and starts his own thread on the same subject.

[01:53] And then tries to have a civil conversation around it.

[01:56] So look, let bygones be bygones. It's happened.

[02:00] It was inevitable. The amount of complaining that the mod team would get every time I would post anything.

[02:06] I'm happy you guys got your way. I hope you're satisfied. I really do.

[02:11] It's not going to change what we do here at all.

[02:14] But I think it showed some of the true character of the people on there.

[02:18] When you're banning me for not being nice and then you just see page of the page of the page of people personally insulting me.

[02:24] And by the way, do the mods come in? Do they do anything? No.

[02:28] They just let all the cheap shots happen.

[02:32] And then I think they threw it into the into the basement now.

[02:35] But it was just funny reading what you guys were writing.

[02:37] Me and my friends were reading them all and just getting the ultimate kick out of it.

[02:41] The funny part is this. I love when people come on and say how much they can't stand me, how they want to ignore me, how they are going to drain the thread.

[02:49] And yet all they're doing is thinking about and talking about Canada.

[02:54] So you've lost. You didn't win if you're going to do that.

[02:57] But one thing I really want to clarify is this whole notion that I've been creating duplicate accounts to sneak back on.

[03:05] I haven't created one duplicate account. In fact, you guys look so silly.

[03:10] Do you really think that I would create a duplicate account called Ted Suo and sneak back on?

[03:15] I love the Salem witch hunt that's going on where every new member is being accused of being Canada.

[03:21] Here's what I want to do. I just want to set for the record straight what we're going to do in this podcast.

[03:25] We've been doing it since the beginning and we're going to do it to the very end of the Canadian Pimbal Podcast.

[03:30] This podcast exists for one reason and one reason only. We want to tackle some of the drama.

[03:36] We want to ask the hard questions that no one else will ask.

[03:40] I think it is completely appropriate to ask, does the hobbit need to not ship until they fix what could be a ramp issue?

[03:49] Should we not ask that question? I think we need to ask, is this the best artwork that could have been on Alien?

[03:58] We're going to ask those questions. If you disagree, come on the show and share your opinions.

[04:03] I hear so much loud talking but no one wants to come on.

[04:06] That's why we're here. We're going to keep asking those hard questions.

[04:10] If anyone wants to come on and dispute them or answer them or give their opinion, you know where to find us.

[04:16] This is KANEDA Pimbal at gmail.com.

[04:22] Alright, let's switch gears and talk about Ted and our interview with Ted.

[04:28] I'm going to air this in just a few seconds. This is a really fun interview.

[04:33] This interview took place Sunday night.

[04:36] This happened right when I was permanently ejected from all the threads.

[04:42] I knew I was going to get banned the following morning when Robin woke up.

[04:46] I wanted to understand the context of the timing of this interview.

[04:50] In this interview, Ted and I talk about a bunch of things.

[04:53] We talk about Pinside Drama. We talk about the trolling.

[04:57] Ted believes that if Pinside just ejected the 20 worst trolls on there, the place would be amazing.

[05:05] It's 19 now that KANEDA is gone, apparently.

[05:08] But I push back on Ted. I think that Ted goes on to Pinside and also enjoys the drama and entertainment as do a lot of people.

[05:16] They won't always admit it, but they do. It makes the site a lot more interesting.

[05:22] We talk about the new Pins coming out. We talk about Alien.

[05:25] We talk about Ghostbusters. We talk about Pimbal Circus.

[05:32] And we talk about who we think should have the Star Wars license.

[05:35] It's a great interview. I want you guys to listen. I'm just going to air it.

[05:39] I really appreciate Ted coming on. I think he's a great guest.

[05:42] I have a whole bunch of other guests lined up for you guys as well.

[05:46] I've heard feedback that you guys enjoy the interviews.

[05:48] You're going to get a bunch of interviews, but you're also going to get just me one-on-one with my point of view a lot too.

[05:55] Without further ado, here's the interview.

[05:58] I want to welcome back to the PINBALL podcast.

[06:02] My very first guest, he's returning. That is SPFX Ted.

[06:08] Ted, thanks for taking some time, Sunday night to come on and talk.

[06:12] Well, I have to be since you can't obviously communicate with anybody else.

[06:25] Right. This is the... for a quick update for all those out there.

[06:30] This evening, I was ejected from not just my own thread or the recent Hobbit thread that I put up,

[06:40] but I was ejected from all PINBALL thread threads.

[06:44] Ted, I want to talk about that because you saw the post I put up tonight and let's start there.

[06:50] Ted and I are just going to sort of... we don't really have an agenda.

[06:53] Ted was like, let's just chat again. He was like, cool. What do you want to talk about?

[06:56] We're like, let's just go down a list of what's been going on in the form and what was...

[07:00] I have an agenda. I want to push my new film.

[07:02] No, he's just...

[07:04] You know what? I don't know. I read through the stuff. I look through the post.

[07:12] I think what people are just saying is that a lot of the stuff you're posting is negative as opposed to positive.

[07:18] Hey, Grant, did you play the machine? And it broke.

[07:22] All right. I get it. I didn't think there's anything actually wrong with posting that.

[07:28] For those who haven't seen the thread, I'll just recap it real quickly.

[07:32] And so I put up a post that said, hey, we played the game. I even said I'm starting to turn around on this title.

[07:38] But the ramp broke. And I just thought that people who are in on the game would like to...

[07:44] That's a bit of information, I think, if anyone shared, would be accepted.

[07:48] But all hell broke loose. And you saw the thread, Ted. I mean...

[07:52] It happens in every one of your threads. Well, actually in most threads, it falls apart.

[07:58] You know what? I've had this problem now. And I've talked to Madera Israel. I've talked to Robyn about this years ago explaining about getting more people to actually participate on Pinside.

[08:10] It's the same 20 or 30 people, pretty much in all threads. Every now and then someone will poke their head in the list of four of them, they'll get the hell out.

[08:18] And a lot of people have contacted me about it. And it's a shame because every thread turns into a shit show after a while.

[08:27] I mean, regardless of staying on top of it. I get it. Everybody knows everybody there. You make jokes. You go off top of it. I get it.

[08:34] But it turns into personal attacks. It just gets nasty. And if they would just get rid of 15 people, I guarantee that it would be hundreds more that would participate.

[08:45] Because there's so many people now. They just only want to open their mouths because it's a very... It gets to be a very negative atmosphere. And it's a shame.

[08:54] It just seems like these people have... I mean, get a life. I mean, for Christ's sake, come on. Enjoy Pindbull. Enjoy talking about it.

[09:00] And we have a problem. Try to fix it. You know, there's a difference between constructive comments and constructive arguing. You have a problem with something and say, well, okay.

[09:10] This is how I think it could be better. You know, I wish it was like this. But not comments. I say, well, this guy's an asshole. The machines are piece of shit.

[09:16] I mean, it just turns into a shit show without it being very, you know, constructive. There's nothing wrong with constructive arguing just turning into a name calling shit show, which so many threads turn into.

[09:27] Right. But internet forms, right? Ted, I mean, it is...

[09:32] But, you know, they're not all like that. I'm on a few threads now. I never got too much into it. The Ray Harryhausen thread, you know, animation threads or whatever.

[09:41] They're moderated, but they're moderated. There's no ifans or buts. If you come on there one time and you're an asshole, boom, you're gone forever. That's it.

[09:50] You come on there, try to sell something. You come on there, do something stupid, you're gone. And so everybody gets along. We talk about what we want to talk about.

[09:57] There are arguments. Sure there's arguments, but no one comes in as you're an asshole for thinking this or that thing is piece of shit.

[10:02] They come on and sometimes they take up documents and papers saying, look, I think it's this way. And it turns into a real constructive conversation.

[10:10] And if it turns to an argument, it's a constructive one. It's never against it to a name calling shit show.

[10:16] Right. And it's because, you know, the moderators are on every poster there all the time. Granted, I understand with Pinside. There's thousands of people.

[10:25] There's only a handful of moderators. You know, I get that, but I still maintain that if they would get rid of a handful of people, it would just turn out to be a much better place.

[10:35] Do you want, Ted, it sounds like you want me off of Pinside.

[10:39] Well, that was probably what I was getting at. I'm just kidding. No, hey, everybody has their moments. You, me, we're all assholes at some point.

[10:49] But it is a difference between just like, like, what's his, I forget his name, Beasle boobs. He's, you know, he's an asshole too, but he's funny.

[10:57] And like, you know, we're all assholes, but sometimes you could do it being sarcastic and not do it with the name calling and just the nastiness to it.

[11:07] You know, just some of these threads, they just get just damn nasty. And it's just, I'll give you an example.

[11:13] A lot of my friends, you know, I live in an area where a lot of my friends have a good amount of money. You're talking about $20 million homes.

[11:20] These are big, big people. And I tried to get some of them into pinball because, oh, yeah, they don't know anything about this pinball subculture.

[11:27] They thought pinball was dead a long time ago. They really don't come into contact with it much. And when I told them about it, they all want to get pinball machines and video games and things for their game rooms.

[11:37] They had the pool tables and ping pong tables and all this kind of stuff, but maybe an arch and worried game or one of those, whatever the hell they call them, those video game things, but not pinball.

[11:45] So a lot of them went out and they just bought, I forget this place in Jersey here that's down by each other foot that it really goes to.

[11:51] And they just go down there and buy five or 10 games. And actually New Jersey Gecko went to my friend's house one time to fix one of his machines or two of them and actually bought into the buying one from them.

[12:02] And so I mentioned to these guys about pinstries. I know there's a thing and I talked about three or four guys, every one of them called me up and they said, why would you send me?

[12:11] What's the matter with you? They said, I went to five or six threads and it just turned it like a name calling horror show.

[12:18] They would, they wouldn't waste their time going back. And I felt embarrassed because I'm the one that told them to go there. And now they told me that. And again, it's just the same people that posted almost every thread that are negative.

[12:31] Why they're still around. I have no idea. So why do you want to sort of go at this from a few angles and, you know, being one of those sort of hyper users. And I'll say this, I do get negative at times on certain parts of the games, certain play field artwork. And we'll talk more about that.

[12:52] But in terms of personally insulting people, because I think there's like, there's, there's definitely a difference between sharing your opinions about a product and sharing your opinions about a person, right? And so why do you think there's, let's, let's just step back. Why do you think there's just so much extreme opinions being shared around a topic that is a toy.

[13:16] You know, it's like when you think about it, right? It's people. Well, yeah, but you got to realize for a lot of people, this is their main hobby in life. This is the thing they saved the money to do. I mean, you know, there's everyone out there. It's not a rich person that could just go and buy these machines. There are many people out there that to buy an 8,000 dollar machine. They got to, they got to save up money. They got to possibly put part of it on a credit card. I mean, this is a big, you know, a big thing for them. It's a big hobby for them. They learn how to work on these machines and do this. And I understand that they're passionate about it.

[13:45] But there's just a difference between being passionate about it and being a disrespectful asshole. And that's, that's the thing. I mean, come on here and be argumentative. You'll argue your point. Come back it up with whatever have your opinions about stuff. But there's no excuse to be just an arrogant, you know, disrespectful asshole. You have to know how to argue and still be respectful at the same time. Right. And when that doesn't happen, that's when I think people should get should get knocked off. Right.

[14:15] So Ted, knowing that like right now you enjoy pinball. It's not your number one hobby. When you go on the pin side as someone who is not buying a new pin right now and is the, your collection right now is not existed. Do you also go on a little bit to read some of that back and forth? You seem to enjoy it a little bit negative toward me right now with that comment. No, no, I'm just, I'm what I'm. I'm going to make me come over there.

[14:43] People there's there's two sides to like why people enjoy pin side though. And I hear there's some people too. I was talking to my friend tonight and he said, look, if I want to be a better pinball player, I go to the tilt forms. Like I would never go to pin side to learn how to become a better pinball player.

[15:00] But I go to I go to pin side because it's it's got so much more. He said the word drama and there's so much more going on that. So yeah, and I like I like pinball. I enjoyed pinball.

[15:12] I've been playing pinball since I was a kid down in and while we're down the shore like we discussed in the other podcast. So I just like playing it. So I'm no good at it. I just, I mean, I don't know the rules. I just love playing the game because I've been playing it all my life.

[15:26] You know, for many years. So it's just an nostalgia thing for me. I just enjoy playing pinball. I can't wait to get another pinball machine. It's just so many choices out now. It's just a matter of which one to, you know, which one to get.

[15:40] Yeah, no, I just go to pin side because you know the threads I enjoy the most are the ones and I, you know, and I posted them like and I say this is when someone is tearing down a machine and you know, redoing it, putting it all back together again.

[15:53] Just looking at those pictures of following it for months. It's sometimes months. These guys are like guy was making that pinball machine that was made out of clear plexiglass. I was going crazy. I was falling at every day. This was like the coolest thing I ever saw. But watching those threads where these guys are working on these machines and you know doing the stuff I never could do.

[16:09] And I'm putting these machines back together again and making you know an old machine like it's brand new again. Those are the threads I really like. I love the threads also where someone posts. They have a problem. I have this is my problem and he post all the things when they start posting pictures back and forth saying this is a solenoid that went what the hell they call it. This thing went here. And then they're trying to track down the part and they're replacing this. Did you try the fuse?

[16:31] Did you try this? And then finally after like two weeks they get it working. Those are the threads I love. Yeah, I participate in the other threads. I read through the drama things. It just it just annoys me some time. It's like a car crash. You just you can't look away. But those are the kind of threads that I really enjoy the most.

[16:48] Right. So switching gears because I think we could probably talk we could probably talk all night about. Pen-Fight in the drama and it's probably not going to change. You know, I think it's going to stay the way I do think the moderators do a good job. I don't I think there are kind of hands are tied a little bit.

[17:08] There's just so few of them. I mean, I love you should be one. You should be a moderator.

[17:13] And 300 people watching or something. There's almost a thousand people on there. The threads are starting. And again, I remember somebody saying they remember in the old days when I first started, you could you had a handful of topics.

[17:25] So the end of the day you go there that topic that was on the top would even be at the bottom of the page yet. Now the page if they're flying by there's so many topics. How the moderators can do it. I don't understand.

[17:37] I think that you need a hundred people to do this job rather than a handful. So and again, these are people that are not being paid. They're not getting anything that this is it's an amazing job that they're doing.

[17:49] It's a good thing they don't make me a moderator because boy, I'll tell you for Robin, wouldn't you make any money? They can't have the people that be gone.

[17:56] I feel like I feel like why feel like you'd be a good moderator. I think I think you sort of do your own sort of self moderation in the threads themselves. I always feel like you sort of calm the tensions whenever sometimes I've had bottles on pitside people have gotten me pissed off. It's gone to name calling it's gone. You know, I don't give a shit. I'm not back enough from anything. So I'm going to go right back out. I don't give a shit.

[18:19] And if they've taken it to PM's and I mean nasty threatening stuff. We're moderate to contact me. It's a talk to me about it. It was it was pretty bad. You know, for a while, you know, I'm just as bad as anybody. I can get rolled up on this stuff too.

[18:34] And if someone says something nasty, but far I'm not going to be the first one to start it to come out and call it say, hey, you're an asshole unless people are being an asshole.

[18:44] But it's a subjective thing. It's a law of averages. You got a thousand people on there. Sure out of a thousand, you're going to get 20 people are just annoying. The shame of it is it's the same 10, 20 people that posted almost every thread.

[18:57] That's the problem. But again, like you said, let's get off this topic. Let's get up to something happier in some of the new pinball machines. Did you hear about that? What's that machine called?

[19:06] Or something flying circus thing with the elephant head? What was the name of that machine? Is that pinball circus? Is that what it was pinball? What was the guy's name that did it?

[19:15] Python. Python. Angela. Yes. Yeah. That machine. I played that machine at Alan Town one time when it was just in its in its raw form. I'll tell you that looked like a really fun machine. It was really cool.

[19:29] So I know they're making I saw it at it was at expo this year and and Ted's talking about pinball circus. I want to say that they're making 13 prototypes of it. I believe that's the number and what they're going to do is they're going to produce those 13 and I think each of them might have a little bit something different on them.

[19:52] I'm not positive about that to see like how they each play. Yeah. The guy announced that there's something about that and then they're going to see if it's warranted for that to actually go into production.

[20:04] And I think that's a smart move. I think it's good to test the waters because they don't want to do the pre-order model. They don't want to say we're going to make 150 of these and we're going to sell them all prior.

[20:19] I don't remember if they were doing pre-order or not. I mean again, I know they're not they're not that's why they're doing the process and actually I like that move right they want to see like because when I was talking to Ben it seems like the best thing to do is first build a machine right.

[20:34] Know what it takes to build it know how much it costs with the materials the time the effort and and then build it and then from there prototype it and then make sure everything works before you offer it for sale because you know you want to know how much it's going to cost you to actually make and then you know figure out what volume you can make for that price.

[20:56] Yeah, well this is the way it was when I publish a magazine is a hobby called special effects magazine and back in the old days it was just sort of like a pinball you want to make your magazine.

[21:06] You know we didn't have these things like these fundraising things like Kickstarter or this prepaid thing we never heard of that where you go and ask people for a bunch of money and then do it.

[21:16] That we didn't do that we saved up all of our money we went and put the magazine together our self put a copy together sent that copy around to all the different distributors all over the world.

[21:28] They said okay well we if you do this magazine will be interested to take a thousand will take five thousand will take five hundred will take whatever and when we got enough we felt okay we might have a something going here we went out paid for it in full got the magazine had the boxes over to your house and then went to these people it's okay the magazine is here.

[21:45] You know let's let's go and that was it you had to take the chance put out all the money yourself and then hope that you're going to be able to these people are going to come through and buy the magazine so you so you break even right as opposed to having a kick started.

[21:59] So I'm reading here that they're going to make twelve sample games and then from there they're going to see how it goes.

[22:10] So and I know that it was really hard to get I think that list sort of filled up immediately but I'm excited that was four months ago they announced that I'm just scrolling down the thread to see if there's anything.

[22:22] I hope they have something down this year and an updated version because like I said it's worse form it was fun.

[22:29] So I mean I can only imagine how much fun it's going to be when it's all together.

[22:33] So it just a very cool machine.

[22:35] Yeah it was cool I remember playing it it's what's cool about it it's like this sort of Frankenstein machine of you know as if you know a pinball machine in our

[22:45] Cade machine combined because the cabinet looks more like a traditional arcade cabinet when you see it from a distance it's sort of it's what it's like.

[22:52] Yeah it's all those levels but all those levels do something cool.

[22:55] Yeah it's cool it's vertical and I remember it's got that it's got the snake in the middle and then the flippers are really really far apart.

[23:05] That was the one thing I was trying to figure out because it would like it would drain so easily but I think there's something with like the snake mechanism that's supposed to make it a lot easier.

[23:14] Yeah it comes out and maybe hits the ball. I don't remember I just remember saying this is a game I want to keep my eye on and see how it looks as it progresses.

[23:23] It just seemed like it was a lot of fun to play. So I saved crack right I never even knew that game existed before until down when I think Greg went down had his party and you had one of the games down there and I just started playing it.

[23:36] It was just such a cool game such a tiny little thing.

[23:39] Yeah it was a lot of fun.

[23:41] I played save cracker for the first time at sunshine laundromat and Brooklyn.

[23:47] Yeah it was it's like I'm trying to think of like how would you describe the scale of it it's like 20% smaller than it's it's a lot of people I was reading on pins I people saying they were playing it I guess they meant it was too easy because they said the game just went on and on and on and on and I just had to leave it.

[24:04] Well that was not that good river leave game.

[24:07] That was that was what I posted because we were playing a four player game I guess the way it works is that was you yeah you're you're playing a you're playing a four player game and you're earning more time as you go so we literally were like each of us were on like our eighth ball.

[24:23] Yes I'm not that good.

[24:25] I don't even maybe they just had the machine set on an easier setting or something happened because we were just like we had literally been playing it for like a half hour straight and we're like okay there's like 30 pins there so we're like we have to go play some other stuff but it was definitely fun and I think if you're short on room which I am in my apartment I could probably fit a save cracker in here alongside the lower the rings without making it feel too bulky but so what other pins what what else even.

[24:54] I think it about lately I know when I'm following alien I mean I know the conversation has been and actually from what you said I mean more and more people are jumping on that on that bandwagon saying that the the play field is just you know it's just so so you know with the art or whatever you know what but I still am not sure because it's a type of thing where if that game is populated with all these different toys that they're talking about and there's going to be the you know that the eggs are going to be on top of the little things go the pop things.

[25:23] The pop bumpers. The pop bumpers eggs are going to get top of that and they're going to have a thing that tongue comes out. I mean they're going to have all this stuff with lights on and everything you may not need to have that much stuff on the play field that much art.

[25:34] I mean granted hey I was like everybody else which I posted I made up a little mock machine where's the big alien head on it with the things sticking out dripping you know that's what I would thought it might be or maybe in the back glass but you know what I say we have to wait until all the toys and all lights and everything is on the machine and then we say oh well they showed you.

[25:52] So I don't know if they're trying to be part of the community they're trying to let us experience the the journey with them in making this machine and then what happens is we get all over their ass about it you know they're letting us in on this that doesn't happen with stirring well maybe it goes but that doesn't happen with stirring they don't let our pictures of this and that little thing way they wait until the whole thing is done and that's it's so these other boutique brands are thinking the sort of like getting us involved showing us the journey along the way.

[26:21] And then we crap over every single stage of the way so eventually like you said a lot of these people you know they're just not going to do it. Stern learns I don't think they don't give a shit that you think you don't have to start.

[26:33] I would I would argue though that the reason Stern doesn't do it and and Ghostbusters was in there's they don't have to well they don't have to right and that's the they have new pins coming out every three to four months they don't have to stay relevant because they're always relevant because they're the only ones who are shipping.

[26:49] So I would I would argue that alien needs to show stuff to keep people on the hook to keep orders from coming in because you know they're there a year past the first release date was supposed to be a sometime like a year ago and that's fine like everyone understands that if you don't get that it's hard to build a pinball machine by now and that every boutique estimated launch date is going to every single manufacturer never even came close to the data.

[27:18] Yeah so that's I have to know that going in if you don't know if you haven't learned that lesson by now it's like you know that that's the deal it's going to take a lot longer than you think but you know you just got to really figure out who's really going to come through with machine big Lebowski yes I think they're going to come through aliens yes they're going to come through spooky everything they do you know they're going to come through but you know anybody else has just started out you got to be you know you got to be suspect because you see how these other guys have a ton of experience and and you know we're having a big.

[27:47] You know we're having a big you know trouble so imagine what someone just getting into it like the predator thing with these guys where you know they never did it before.

[27:54] Jay Parker's not used I mean it was so I think just a close loop in alien and we can we can talk about some of the other predicts what's been going on but I think I think what's happened in the in the I agree I want to see it populated I there's a lot of mechanisms a lot of toys are going to be super fun and so what were I've questioned and is just like.

[28:17] If you're going to show something where.

[28:19] It's missing you know it's missing it's missing half of it right when we see if you just see any playfield up.

[28:25] It's very rare that you you if you just saw a playfield by itself that you go like bonkers for it I think you know some of them have incredible artwork like.

[28:34] You know I always hit the same but like magic girl when we just saw the playfield art on that you're like oh my god this is like incredible like.

[28:42] Yeah I know there's a number of playfields are having incredible art on them but you know I will probably end up you're disagreeing on this point I don't think there's anything wrong with these

[28:50] boutique guys showing us the journey they're probably not going to do it anymore after they see you know the pounding that they're going to take but I don't see

[28:56] there's anything wrong with that I mean but it's it's the criticism that needs to be constructive someone is saying you know hey look you know I know this is what you you

[29:03] do in there and this is the way you're taking it but you know gee I was thinking of it this way it wouldn't it be cool if this was there and that was there

[29:09] and then hey if they want to take that and say hey yeah maybe I'll incorporate that and say hey look this is my gig this is the way it's going to be you know this is what we're

[29:17] limited to whatever I get it as long as it's a respectful conversation you can disagree on it and that's it but I enjoy the

[29:23] journey I enjoy seeing the machines in their early form the early back last the early whitewoods the early playfields I enjoy that.

[29:32] I think I think with alien and and this can be our final point I think what was interesting now and you have to like look at the characters and play is that you know or is a very outspoken and and often times you

[29:48] know delivers strident criticisms of other playfields and other playfield artwork so I think that's what that's what's going on right now right as I saw today.

[29:57] He's taking it to now pretty good. Oh yeah people are like you said the ACDC was clip art crap and yours is just clip art too so he's taking it like I know he's

[30:07] they actually someone pointed out something to him today and he triggered him off and he's just like it don't buy it.

[30:13] Well and that's what I don't you know like I don't even want to see stuff like that too because when you're representing

[30:18] and you're just a super nice guy I mean Andrew is one of the nicest guys in the whole industry and if anyone has a chance to go up to him at any of the

[30:26] conventions or expose you know you have to because he's such a he's he's the perfect sort of leader for a pinball company and how

[30:34] approachable he is and how transparent he is but you never wanted to get to a point like you would never hear a Gary

[30:39] Stern or even when there were Game of Thrones took a shallacking on the art right but you just still would never hear a professional company like don't buy it.

[30:48] Yeah well you know you're not going to hear that because you're not going to find Gary Stern coming on Pinside and talking to anybody that you know they just don't do it.

[30:57] I mean we were so lucky we're so lucky to be able to have people have Jersey Jack have all these people from these different

[31:04] companies actually participating in Pinside something me personally I never do it in millions years have I had a company but I'm just saying we had these people there where you could

[31:12] ask them questions give them suggestions they're back and forth with you these are pinball people this would have been the

[31:18] whole if I could have had an open line to Ray Harryhausen because I'm a big you know animation fan if I could have had a

[31:24] forum where he was participating on it and I could actually ask him questions and make comments about his work and tell him what I like.

[31:30] I would be going crazy to do the greatest thing in the world but instead they alienate these people they call the names and they drive them off the site and it's a pinball site if I was

[31:40] around I'd be pulling my hair out they would make me I would want these people to please come on the site and participate.

[31:46] Yeah it's hard right I mean I mean it seems like all of JJP is now departed Pinside all the different members that were reactive

[31:55] and it's gonna keep doing that as long as people come on there and they're saying things are people going to say you're a lie right you're full of shit I this is a piece of crap as always that's the kind of conversation more and more people are just going to fall away it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's gonna be left to all the drama queens that's gonna be all it's gonna

[32:12] it's in the right I don't think I look I don't think so but it's also hard I mean you had I mean Jack was coming on there and and saying stuff that was crazy to people threatening people and what it is a human being if you

[32:24] said that to me about my work to I'm going to fuck you know but you know it don't don't tell people don't take people's money and make them wait almost four years you know I mean

[32:32] I mean that's the way that I do not believe that Jack is trying to screw people I don't believe I believe he's trying to make pitball machines I make a living and make a company and and he's doing what he needs to do to do that

[32:46] and I don't understand my people understand that he's not saying oh gee let's screw these guys and I'm giving the hobbit for another month fuck them he's believe me he wants these machines out the door just as much well actually more than anybody

[32:59] and anybody that thinks that that's not right it's got to be crazy I yeah but but Ted if you give a if you say to people this game's gonna ship and I get things slip but here's a thing every pinball company did that I know

[33:14] but only one I don't have an issue when you don't have people paying full beforehand that in any like when I got a car I don't I went to a dodged dealership and I'm giving you a car you bit I'm giving you a car you've been I put five I put five hundred dollars down

[33:42] Oh a venue for my computer five hundred dollars down I didn't if they made me pay in full I get it I understand all the arguments I understand them but how many times does this happen if you don't want to put your money down and wait until it's done right they don't do it I agree pay the extra thousand or two thousand when it comes out and buy one you'll be able to get it look I don't be right now they can't get a wizard of ours if they want it anybody out there it won't be able to get a hobbit if they want it I just think it's done I

[34:11] agree I I've said this across the board I don't you don't need to pre order you whatever five hundred dollars you might save the games will be available they always are and if they're not available from distributors people you'll get them second hand market you know a use pin and let's be honest right use pins are almost like new pins like collectors

[34:33] I get it yeah they take so I got my Lord the Rings used it looked brand new had two and a place on it you know collectors take such good care of these machines that it's you know these aren't it's not like someone back into your pinball machine where they were trying to park it you know like a car it's they stay pretty men so I think we're headed for I think 2016 those going to be a great year I in and I'll say why because

[34:58] hobbit is on the line so it's shipping so all of the moaning and groaning that ship it was broken ramps right no it's good to ship let's talk about the hellcat right I've had it out today I know I should have I should have but the charity chili fast it was great

[35:17] the hobbit the hobbit is on the line and that photos great it's it's it's it's it looks like it's going to get to people mid March which is awesome I mean I really can't wait for people to get it and play it in home environment it's you really can't appreciate that pin on location I mean all the

[35:35] worthy went into the sound effects into the music and into all the different integration elements it's hard to pick that up out on location so that's going to ship it looks like

[35:44] Lebowski is I'm more interested in Ghostbusters than any of those other ones I mean Lebowski we've played pretty much seen exactly what it's going to be how it's going to play

[35:53] alien we've seen enough I mean they have little diary on pictures of the toys we know there's going to be pop umbers I mean we have a little bit of an idea of the flow of it but we really don't know I mean we've seen those pictures of Ghostbusters but we really have no idea how it plays I mean that to me is the big mystery is what that's going to be like so I'm I hope so that I'm hearing that we might get that reveal

[36:14] any day now really I'm hoping it is this week but any day now it could be any day now I could be could be any day now I could say I was right it was any day

[36:29] and I look it's bound to happen but I just a matter of I really can't wait to see what kind of gizmo they're going to put on this machine I do know that the leaks were not

[36:38] orchestrated by Stern I know that for a fact and they are I'm going to ask you how you know that for a fact but go ahead I mean some people that no people that no people that no people and it's like it's not one of those doesn't matter it doesn't really matter

[36:57] right I think it's a no harm no foul kind of leak I think the leak is done probably a beneficial thing for a Stern in the sense that people who are

[37:05] probably on the fence who might be going towards a Lebowski or a Hobbit might feel like okay I'll just oh wait you know or maybe I'll

[37:14] pre-order the Ellie they might or the are you know they just might that pre-order everything as long as you can cancel out and get

[37:20] my back pre-order everything and see how it goes yeah my I mean as well I mean I don't mind the pre-orders I mean it sounds like

[37:27] distributors for ghost busters are taking anywhere between I've seen numbers between a hundred dollars I actually have a hundred

[37:33] dollars down on an Ellie I figured what the hell but you know my as well just put a hundred bucks down I spent more on a street

[37:42] fighter five arcades take this weekend so you know no biggie and then all the way up to I saw someone put a

[37:49] thousand dollars down on one I saw someone put all the way to 3,500 down for I guess they're paying for half of it so I hope that

[37:58] gets revealed soon because it it's just like we you know it's like we've heard so much about it and there's like 90 pages of

[38:05] speculation and that threads completely derailed that the distributors must if they're taking people's money they must

[38:13] have some kind of worry that something is is happening pretty soon because you know if this wasn't

[38:18] happening for six months down the line I can imagine where a pinball distributor would take 3,500 dollars

[38:24] whether somebody's money and and not even know what the hell is going on I guess it's possible I don't know that

[38:29] well it's it's it's it's interesting because the way that um

[38:36] Trent that TNT amusements I want to say it is I hope I'm getting that right I'm probably got it wrong

[38:42] uh the way it worked is I I hit him up and I'm like I want to give a hundred dollars towards a ghost buster's LE

[38:49] pre-order and he wrote back he never used ghost busters he would write back and say something along the lines of

[38:56] for a hundred dollars you can reserve Stern's next LE and then I would write back be like do you mean ghost

[39:01] busters and he'd write back and mean you'll have the next LE like it was like

[39:06] wouldn't it be great if it was something

[39:09] right that's how it was so I I haven't I so even till is that I don't even I don't know by exactly

[39:17] having to pass it down I go spusters because there's nothing you're writing uh who knows you know I

[39:21] mean I think if they reveal this thing and everyone starts waving tons of money distributors here's

[39:26] here's an interesting thing right MSRP and distributors have never really had to sell a game for

[39:34] over the MSRP in fact they usually sell for less but let's say Stern announces 500 ghost buster

[39:42] LE's and the demand might be three times that do distributors sell closer to the MSRP because

[39:52] it sounds like they usually knock about a grand off the street value of a game right it's just it's

[39:57] just the demand supply and demand I mean I don't think that if they think this is going to be a big

[40:04] hit I can't imagine them not doing you know decent numbers on on a ghost busters pin I mean I

[40:08] have you know friends of mine that are really not even interested in pinball that much at all

[40:13] and I told them is it ghost busters pin they mean ghost busters I had I'd be really interested in that

[40:18] so ghost busters I think is going to be a lot more popular than they think as long as the game

[40:23] is good I mean I'm hoping the game is good yeah that's the that's the the question and everyone's

[40:30] mind is what's the final game going to be because I was also reading that some of what leaked and this

[40:35] is why Stern wasn't happy with the leak is maybe not all of that makes it into the final game and I

[40:40] think that is one of the things where you know people might think they're I heard there may at first

[40:47] we are hearing rumors like ten times the innovation there's going to be like laser beams proton beams

[40:53] holographic slimer magnetic slings so all this stuff was you know thrown out there and

[41:01] some of it's probably going to be in there some of it might have been dropped out some of you know

[41:05] because Stern's you know they got to keep everything going and they they will cost cut if they

[41:10] need to make sure they can make it up at right bottom and that's I'm not even willing to speculate

[41:15] at all because quite frankly I have no fucking clue and nobody really does until it's revealed so

[41:21] you know we're just guessing you're just throwing shit out there really there's a meany thing

[41:25] unless it's all waiting till the game is out there I want to speculate on is it is it known for sure

[41:30] whether Stern got the Star Wars rights or not that's not known yet I know that they

[41:37] as I know that they were battling with with Jersey Jack to get them right someone has

[41:43] said that Stern is working on something called like project synabun right and they're

[41:50] alluding that that is Princess Leia's hair right looks like that so that's that's as well

[41:56] either that or with Domino's pizza it might really be synabun exactly well that's as close as we know

[42:02] I it's I don't know how that works I mean it's I should have asked Ben this when I was talking

[42:07] about licensing when two competing companies want to go for the license on something I'm not

[42:11] exactly sure how they handle that is it I'm sure it's just a money thing like who who who they

[42:16] probably both submit bids I would assume and whoever bids the highest gets it I mean how I don't

[42:23] know I just know they were both going after it I would guess that the studio at one point would

[42:28] have to see like what what a thing like the hobby I mean Peter Jackson I'm sure we'll be looking

[42:33] at things and say well I like the way this is done or that's done but I mean with with Star Wars

[42:37] I don't know really who is you know Abrams or who who's gonna be the guy that really decides

[42:42] it's owned by Disney so you know who really decides and you know what kind of history do they have

[42:48] with the company that then has Star Wars so you know if it's starting from ground zero when they're

[42:53] looking for stuff and they're looking at the history of these two companies you know it's it's

[42:58] it's tough you know tough decision to make I was just curious I didn't know whether anything was

[43:03] I thought I I heard that someone found out that who would you want to make Star Wars that of all

[43:09] the companies out there oh I would love to see Jersey Jack make Star Wars I mean I'd like all

[43:14] the companies but I'd like to see them do it only because you know I'd like to see the big screen

[43:19] I mean I actually Star Wars with with that big screen out there and you know the crazy stuff they

[43:24] would do I mean just for that and a wide body you know so much stuff I don't want I'd like to see

[43:29] I'd like to see Star Wars and I'm not a gigantic fan of wide body machines as I'm not a fan of

[43:33] machines that have you know three mini playfields and 18 flip or I just don't like any I crap but

[43:39] but I I would be interested I mean Halo Stern is gonna probably do a great job if they have it too

[43:46] either one of them is gonna do good if I had to pick a company I'd probably just pick Jersey Jack

[43:50] only because they would do a wide body and do a lot of the crazy you know put some crazy gizmos in

[43:56] there so yeah I think if if Stern has Star Wars and they don't go to a LCD by then people they

[44:05] definitely would if they get Star Wars they are absolutely positively gonna do that I would be

[44:09] willing to bet money on it yeah yeah because you got to figure Star Wars I don't think that pin

[44:14] is gonna come out until at least the next movie comes out if if if Jack is doing it and I I I

[44:24] I agree that the the quality of the Hobbit and the the screen it's it's it's not even comparable

[44:33] to what you get with the red dots on Game of Thrones and when you when you put a Jersey Jack

[44:37] machine next to a Stern it's it's that level above in in every way Stern is definitely catching up

[44:45] I think Stern is wot I think Jersey Jack and this is why competition is great right they've

[44:49] woken Stern up to the realities of innovation is necessary and you have to raise your bar if you want

[44:55] to yes you know what happens when you put the sleeping giant oh I know well the thing is is this is

[45:02] I'm sure Stern has every bit of ability to make machines just as good if not they haven't haven't had

[45:09] to they haven't had to they haven't had to have to have to do a wide-body machine well and the the

[45:15] the reason why Stern can quickly get up to that quality standard and succeed at a higher level

[45:22] is simply because of their manufacturing abilities they these guys they've been doing it forever

[45:26] yeah yeah they've been they they can they have that line constantly moving so they can you know

[45:33] they it the rumor pins for Stern it looks like have been Jurassic World looks like that is one

[45:40] that has been floating around there's an arrow Smith or Iron Maiden or Hendrix right those are

[45:47] the three that were considered to be the next musical pin that might come out yeah then you've got

[45:55] we know Ghostbusters people were saying fast and the furious I I would expect to see a fast

[46:02] and furious pin probably to coincide with the next film it it it just makes sense I mean Stern's

[46:08] known to to do car themes and that's the most successful automotive

[46:13] like yeah it's a mountainous mountainous

[46:16] no sort of like the last one I to tell you the truth I think I saw the first one and the last one

[46:20] so those are the only ones I actually saw and I thought the first was okay I thought the last

[46:25] was pretty good so you know I'm not really in like I said I'm really more into the you know

[46:29] science-fiction fantasy horror stuff than the than the cars and the wrestling and any of that kind of

[46:34] have you been have you been following the forbidden planet pin that someone's making oh my god

[46:39] wait can you me I have a there's a big green bell that goes off every time someone posted that

[46:43] what so talk about talk about that pink because you probably know more about the than I do that

[46:49] I caught my help and that I have probably a thousand photographs a candid photos regular photos

[46:57] studio photos from forbidden planet that I've been collecting for you know about 40 years so

[47:03] I mean I offered that to the Anthony and he helped that way you know I just hope I just told

[47:07] him I hope the machine goes into production because that's that's a no-brainer for me just put me

[47:11] down take my money now uh the hell with the pre-order I'm in yeah everybody says that no more

[47:18] pre-orders no more pre-orders as soon as they're grail pill hits exactly the boom take my money

[47:23] wherever all this air like what's the theme is something we can't live without we're like we

[47:27] everybody has that you know for me it's like Beatles and any any science fiction films Ray Harry

[47:32] Howe's and stuff uh you know but that that's the stuff that you know spooky and there's other guys

[47:37] you know should be in two is those those kind of pins you know the you know war the

[47:42] world the time machine any of their Harryhausen film seven voices in bed I think those would

[47:46] make great pins because there's a a jiky what we talked about this last time there's a there's a big

[47:50] community out there of of of collectors of this kind of this kind of material and I mean just

[47:56] if everyone I'm sure everyone I alum would buy one right there they'd be able to sell a thousand

[48:00] pins right off the bat what's that so what's the I was looking for for Ben and plan and

[48:07] what is there it's really cool right it's got they've got this it looks like a jersey jack pinball

[48:12] size monitor in the or LCD screen right in the back box area it's got like a really nice display

[48:19] and it's got this big ramp that comes up in the middle that you shoot to hit like one of the

[48:26] I saw some of some of the play on it and and I think there was one thing and maybe that was it

[48:31] that they they cut out they couldn't get it to work just right or something I mean there's still

[48:35] I mean it's a work in progress this is for now I guess it's just a one-off with these guys working

[48:40] on it but I hope if they get something together that's that's really neat I can't imagine that the

[48:46] right to would be that expensive it's a it's a 1956 film you know it's like oh so I can imagine

[48:54] this would be a big deal for them to spend the much money on the rights but it's just got it's

[48:59] got all the things that people love from like attack from Mars it's got it's got flying saucers

[49:03] and big invisible monsters well you see them and they're raygunned spaceships the girl I mean it's

[49:09] got everything in it like the the cräll tubes the the brain boost machine it's got so much cool

[49:15] stuff and it would be fantastic in a pinball that I'm just looking forward to that a lot

[49:21] right and yeah I mean I hope it looks really cool I hope they they do sort of finish that and

[49:26] it I think what's going to be happened what's going to happen as more people get into the hobby

[49:31] and even in the boutique world because people are making some decent coin uh in the boutique

[49:37] if you can get the games out it's it's when you when you start to do the math on a pinball machine

[49:41] you're like oh right we're gonna make 300 and we're gonna charge six thousand dollars

[49:48] you know what what is that that's one point eight million dollars

[49:52] is that they made money on you know the two machines they're doing they're making money on so

[49:57] whatever they're doing their whatever their percentage was I forget I think one of somebody

[50:01] said something about how much they made you know per machine but they were doing pretty good

[50:05] enough where he's continuing to do it and he built himself he's building himself on getting

[50:09] himself an additional building now and you know good for them I'm glad to see this happen

[50:14] no it's great and and I'm I'm curious this year too because we we know that in 2016 we got

[50:21] Lebowski should be coming out it looks like that's going to start ramping up more towards the summer

[50:28] I'm really did you see Ted did you watch any of the videos or the pictures from the factory tour

[50:33] that they recently had yes any any any thoughts on have you played that have you played that pin

[50:39] yet the game when it was at the at the at the Alan town I believe like uh

[50:47] what where did I play there's someone that was a curtain up and they had up behind a curtain

[50:51] I don't I don't remember but yeah the game was kind of cool you know again it's it's not my

[50:56] type of theme but I thought the game was fun yep so yeah I think I think they're gonna do well

[51:02] with it I mean again it would not it would never have been a game that I would have picked

[51:07] as my first machine for a company because I just didn't think that there would be

[51:10] that many to sell of that of that title but you know I hope I'm not proven wrong it seems like

[51:16] they're they're doing very good with it so hey more power to them right and yeah it was fun I

[51:22] mean I played it when it came to modern pinball they they did a little sort of North American

[51:28] tour with the pen and brought it to a bunch of different locations and I really enjoyed it I

[51:32] mean that was back when they had the the licensed music was playing and you had the marijuana

[51:37] leaf and the cool little bottle but honestly I've seen the new video is that in yourself yeah I

[51:42] yeah I don't and honestly the the re recording of the song sounds great and and I actually think

[51:48] it works better when you just sort of have the instrumental of some of those songs because

[51:51] it doesn't get so repetitive when you hear vocals over and over and over again I have a song so

[51:58] I think it's gonna do well I think it I think it's gonna be interesting to see how many they move

[52:02] I think to your point it's it's gonna be a real test to see how popular is the big little basket

[52:07] theme because I think that movie is very very niche uh and then it's also 10 grand which is and

[52:14] that seems like a non-negotiable 10 grand so it's gonna be interesting to see how many they move and

[52:20] and they people have seen it for two years already too so there's sometimes like it's important

[52:28] to strike while the irons hot I think when they showed that at expo in 2014 people would have

[52:34] cut a check for 10 grand immediately if they could have taken it home um so we'll see well you know

[52:38] sometimes when time passes longer time passes the more the more choices you have I'm sure every time

[52:46] there's another pin announced since yeah anyone thinking oh I'm gonna put down my money and get

[52:50] a game of thrones to ghost busters what you know anytime that happens it's it's gonna right now

[52:56] if they if someone announced they were doing Star Wars I'm sure there'd be a lot of you know people

[53:01] holding out on ghost busters to get that so you know it's yeah the timing is uh is is real interesting on

[53:08] their there there really hasn't been a year I think in the last 20 years where you've had

[53:16] new inbox pinball machines coming from I mean let's count I'm in 2016 in the next six months you're

[53:23] gonna have new inbox shipping from spooky which is one rob zombie will be out uh you will have

[53:30] hobbit you will have ghost busters you will have the big Lebowski so those are four separate

[53:39] manufacturers and alien maybe too right I I don't know if aliens gonna make it in the first six

[53:46] months of the year I hope so so let's say alien does come out and then I think also P3 should

[53:53] be out as well Lexi light speed so that's you know what the hell that is you know it's it's the

[53:59] machine that has the the whole playfield is a screen and it's modular in the back so you can

[54:05] swap out the back part that's modular oh to change the game so that's that's multi more fit who

[54:13] does the P3 so that's six different manufacturers shipping pinball machines in in the first half of

[54:22] the year which is incredible when you think about it right I mean and Captain Emo where is

[54:27] Neem oh that game is literally 20,000 leagues under the sea because I always had to bump that thread

[54:35] and no one ever responds like so I don't know have well I would they were only gonna make like what 10

[54:40] or 13 or 15 games or something did they make them all I remember someone also they had it it was

[54:44] really cool yeah no the the manufacturer the guy who created it he set up the first one

[54:52] but that was like I want to say eight months ago and I've always been bumping like any update like

[54:57] because it's beautiful I that pin is beautiful I mean the art on that is and the integration of

[55:01] the LCD screen on the playfield with the way that it connects to the art perfectly I think is

[55:08] is yeah it's very it's a very very very pretty machine so then are you are you going to Alan Town?

[55:15] I should be when is Alan Town I don't I don't think it's like April me

[55:20] April me oh April me I don't I think I'll definitely go to that because it's it's only a it's only

[55:26] like an hour and a half drive from here like it's not it's really not that far it's a pretty quick

[55:31] drive but anyway we should probably wrap this up because we're going to be going into an hour here

[55:34] and this is an hour podcast is it's not good you'll have people that are driving to work that are
