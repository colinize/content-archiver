[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:22] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:23] It is my birthday today.

[00:25] I'm super excited.

[00:26] Had a great weekend with my best buddy in pinball, Mr. Derek Stutzman, fluent from Texas.

[00:32] He got a ride in the Dodge Demon.

[00:34] He understands now why an electric Porsche will never be able to give you the visceral

[00:39] thrill of a 840 horsepower Dodge Demon.

[00:43] I want to thank each and every one of you for all of your shoutouts and your birthday wishes.

[00:48] It means the world to me.

[00:49] I really have assembled, I think, the greatest fanbase in all of pinball media history.

[00:55] I want to give a special shoutout to Neil Jay, who increased his membership this week.

[01:01] Neil, thank you so much.

[01:02] Let's welcome some of our newest members to the Canada Club.

[01:05] Let's welcome some new members to the Canada Club.

[01:08] We've got Joe Kay, we've got Corey Kane, we've got Pinchese, we've got Tommy.

[01:13] Let's do a little moment of silence for Colin over at the Connecticut.

[01:17] Here he banned Canada from the media mixer.

[01:21] He took his ball and went home and unsubscribed from Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:25] Cool.

[01:26] I lost three club members and I gained seven more.

[01:28] We're still at 610 club members on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:33] And here's what I want to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:36] I want to talk about our pinball wishes for 2024 and I want to read out what your wishes

[01:42] are.

[01:43] I say what your wishes are on my birthday in which I get one wish.

[01:47] If I could have one wish and blow out a proverbial pinball candle and just wish for one thing

[01:54] in this industry, it is so simple what I would wish for.

[01:57] No, it's not prices to come down because I don't think that's ever going to happen.

[02:02] The one thing I want to get in pinball, I want to get triple A theme that is integrated

[02:09] properly with mechanical magic under glass.

[02:13] That is what I want from pinball.

[02:15] I feel like we've been waiting for years.

[02:18] It's like they don't even understand who the target audience is.

[02:21] Just give us a triple A theme from the 80s and the 90s and put that triple A theme under

[02:29] glass in a mechanical magical world in which the ball interacts with toys.

[02:35] Why is that so hard to get for this much money in pinball?

[02:38] I don't mind spending these prices if all games were like the big Lebowski and we've

[02:44] been spending the last few years convincing ourselves that these games are worth the money

[02:49] simply because they give you nice artwork and put a lot of stealth on an LCD screen that

[02:55] you can't even see while you're playing the freaking game.

[02:59] That is my one pinball wish, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:02] Will it happen?

[03:03] Now here are your pinball wishes.

[03:04] Now I'm going to try to get through all of your wishes because there were 37 of them

[03:08] but let's do it.

[03:09] Let's jump into it real quick.

[03:11] From Jeffrey S. he said, for Stern not to F up jaws by tie dyeing the play field with

[03:16] rainbow colors and have a fun impressive game, prices to not increase at all.

[03:21] Well Jeffrey, look, I'm on the same page as you brother.

[03:24] I really hope Stern pinball does not give us a rainbow bright, Skittles inspired, Jaws

[03:31] artwork package on the game.

[03:33] I'm so tired of all of these Stern machines looking the same with the overly bright colors.

[03:39] I get it.

[03:40] Why can't they sync up the artwork with the theme?

[03:43] So Jeffrey, I hope we get that and I hope your wish comes true.

[03:46] I think the prices are not going to go down at all but I don't think they're going to

[03:49] increase.

[03:50] Eric Jackson said, for Stern, capow back to the future with Dwight on code.

[03:55] Don't care who designs it.

[03:57] Wow, Eric, look, I think everybody is hoping we get a back to the future game but I think

[04:01] if we did a poll, most people would not want Dwight on the code of that game and you don't

[04:06] care who designs it.

[04:08] I mean, come on Eric, really, the one everybody would wish to design back to the future is

[04:12] no other than Keith Elwin.

[04:14] I wouldn't want to hand this game to just any designer.

[04:17] Why not have the best theme for pinball with the best designer in the pinball world right

[04:21] now?

[04:22] So Eric, I hope some of your wish comes true but I hope it's Keith Elwin and I also hope

[04:26] it is not Dwight on code.

[04:28] So Rick V said that I feel compelled to buy only one game in 2024.

[04:34] Well Rick, I agree with that wish.

[04:36] I think a lot of us out there as we look at these prices, we almost don't want there to

[04:40] be too many great games that we want to buy because then we're going to go broke.

[04:44] I don't think people want to spend like $30,000, $40,000 a year on pinball machines.

[04:49] Let's just say $40,000 a year.

[04:51] You have to make $80,000 before taxes and have absolutely no other expenses.

[04:58] You don't have expensive family vacations you got to go on.

[05:01] I mean it's a lot of money.

[05:02] People 80k before taxes just to buy like three LE pinball machines.

[05:07] How did it come to this?

[05:09] And I don't know about the rest of you but even though I have a good salary in the real

[05:13] world, my salary has not increased with the inflated prices of pinball so I also hope there's

[05:19] only one game I really, really want to buy.

[05:22] The only thing is in 2024 Rick, I think we're going to see more than one game that's going

[05:26] to entice us to pull the trigger which is good though because over the last couple years

[05:30] I really haven't been enticed to buy much.

[05:32] Alright, Edwin P said, he said that all companies make pins that the value exceeds the price.

[05:39] Need more mechs, call outs and better themes etc.

[05:42] Edwin, I could not agree more.

[05:46] For this much money, we are looking at these games and we should be expecting more in these

[05:51] games than games like Medieval Madness.

[05:54] There should be more in these games than Pirates of the Caribbean.

[05:58] If Jersey Jack Pinball could make Pirates of the Caribbean and sell an LE of that loaded

[06:03] game for like 9 grand, how are we getting LEs now that are 12 grand with half as much

[06:10] in them?

[06:11] And I think that is where everybody is at Edwin and I couldn't agree more with your

[06:15] wish.

[06:16] Alright, Crups4 said, I like to make a purchase where I don't feel ripped off by the manufacturer.

[06:21] In other words, I like to go back to the days where it was exciting and fun to buy a pinball

[06:26] machine.

[06:27] Well, Crups, look, I think those days are gone.

[06:30] I think everybody wishing it was 4 years ago, pre-COVID when you could actually buy a new

[06:35] in-box game for what seemed like a good price, right?

[06:38] And those games were also really limited because there was only 500 LEs.

[06:42] Now it feels like the games are overpriced, there's so many of them and we're never going

[06:47] to go back to those old pricing models.

[06:49] And I think that's the biggest risk in all the pinball right now, Crups.

[06:52] I think people are going to start to say no more, they're not going to buy as many pins

[06:56] and if people aren't absorbing all of these new in-box games, who's going to take all

[07:00] the risk?

[07:01] Like who's going to lose the money?

[07:02] It's going to be the distributors and if they keep saying, hey, Stern, I'm not going

[07:06] to order these games at this much money.

[07:08] We can't sustain it at this much money.

[07:10] Hey, Jersey Jack, I'm not going to buy all these new games at this much money.

[07:14] I'm sitting on all these unsold toy stories and Godfathers and now you want me to go in

[07:18] on Elton John, a game that's probably not going to fly off the shelf?

[07:22] I just can't do it.

[07:23] So we will see what happens.

[07:25] But I think they got too greedy.

[07:26] I think we're going to see real consequences to the greed in 2024.

[07:30] All right, Peter G says, I wish we could go back to normal prices and more mechanical

[07:34] wow in machines, truly immersive machines.

[07:37] If we need to make a sacrifice, I would get rid of the LCD screens and just go back to

[07:42] dots.

[07:43] A man can wish, have a great birthday with your family.

[07:45] Well, Peter, thank you for the birthday wish.

[07:48] I don't think we're going to go back to DMD era, but it's interesting when you think about

[07:52] pulp fiction and how well pulp fiction sold and it doesn't have anything, right?

[07:56] No DMDs, no LCD.

[07:58] They put more into the game in terms of theme integration.

[08:01] They put mechs into the game.

[08:03] It doesn't have ramps, but pulp fiction is a game that has a lot of mechanical stuff

[08:06] going on or at least enough to justify the price.

[08:10] And I also think they went and got a theme.

[08:12] Everybody wanted, but Peter, you're not alone.

[08:14] I think everybody wants what Peter just described.

[08:17] We want great machines with a lot of wow in it and we're not going to be fooled by people

[08:22] telling us that shots are the new toys.

[08:25] I still can't believe we heard that.

[08:26] I still can't believe we had one of the most prominent members in the pinball media tell

[08:30] everybody that shots are the new toys in pinball.

[08:34] That if you just have flow in a game, that constitutes engineering marvel.

[08:39] Get out of here.

[08:40] Like we are not going to count diverters as toys in pinball ever.

[08:43] All right.

[08:44] Royal Jack said, happy birthday.

[08:46] Thanks for all the content.

[08:47] Thank you, Royal Jack.

[08:48] He said, first, I'd like pricing to step back towards normalcy.

[08:51] I've gotten a few friends and coworkers into the hobby lately and these prices immediately

[08:56] turn them off on the idea of investing in personal machines.

[09:00] And second, I hope all of the people who made up their mind about Canada before getting

[09:04] to know him or listening will give him a chance.

[09:07] Well, look, Royal, thank you so much.

[09:09] You know, when I was hanging with Derek this week and he said, I wish everybody could go

[09:13] out to dinner with you, spend a weekend with Canada and realize that you're not this horrible

[09:18] human being that some of these people want me to be.

[09:20] Now, look, I know why people don't like me.

[09:22] I've done stuff that make people not think of me favorably and it is what it is.

[09:27] I don't have to like everybody and they don't have to like me.

[09:29] Now in terms of pricing, taking a step backwards or towards normalcy, Royal Jack, here's the

[09:35] reality to 99.9% of Americans.

[09:39] Nothing about pinball is normal.

[09:42] One of these prices are normal.

[09:43] People would think 7,500 for an LE is stupid, let alone $6,000 or $5,000 for a pinball machine.

[09:50] If you grab the average person off the street, they probably think a pinball machine is like

[09:55] $2,000.

[09:56] I saw today that the Jersey Jack Pinball Collector's Edition ornaments that go on the legs of the

[10:02] Godfather, just two cheap plastic things that stick to the legs of the machine.

[10:07] If you want to buy those two ornaments for your game, $500 for just static sculpted plastic,

[10:16] how much money do you think it costs Jersey Jack Pinball to press two of those ornaments?

[10:20] What, $100 at most?

[10:22] How are those two things $500?

[10:26] And that's the problem with all of the pinball pricing right now.

[10:29] It was always pretty stupid.

[10:30] We kind of always complained about pinball prices, but now we're just seeing pure greed

[10:36] every time a manufacturer puts a price tag on something.

[10:40] It's almost like challenging our intelligence and our integrity as the pinball buying community.

[10:46] And again, the easiest thing to do is just don't buy it.

[10:50] Don't buy it.

[10:51] Let these distributors stock up their shelves with these Jersey Jack accessories and guess

[10:55] what's going to happen in three months?

[10:57] They'll sell you those damn things for $250 when nobody's buying them.

[11:01] They'll sell you those damn things for $250 when nobody's buying them.

[11:05] And that's what's got all of these distributors nervous is they don't want people listening

[11:08] to Canada because I'm going to get you better deals than they ever will give you.

[11:12] All right, Chase Rudd says, Stern put better cooling fans in pins and even better real

[11:17] speakers in the pen.

[11:19] Yes, there is no excuse why we should have these louder than life cooling fans that are

[11:24] disrupting people's experiences with the pins.

[11:27] It's like a $10 part at most, probably $5 part.

[11:31] And to put better speakers into the pinball machines, this is a great wish, Chase.

[11:35] I must agree with this.

[11:36] Like pinball machines for this much money should have like bang an old lips and speakers

[11:42] inside them.

[11:43] It's crazy for like $13,000.

[11:46] You know, we're spending $3,000 over the price of a premium for an LE like they should be

[11:53] putting $500 speakers into the game that blow you away.

[11:57] We shouldn't have to invest in like pin sound upgrades for the CEs or the LE versions of

[12:02] pinball machines.

[12:04] So Chase, do I think they're going to do it?

[12:06] No.

[12:07] Is your wish valid?

[12:08] Absolutely.

[12:09] All right, pinball drew said good theme integration on a theme worth integrating pinball drew.

[12:14] That's exactly what my wish is.

[12:16] We need better themes.

[12:17] They need to be better integrated.

[12:19] You know, I heard someone say on pin side the other day that they think Willy Wonka is

[12:23] one of the greatest theme integrated pinball machines of all time.

[12:26] And after reading that, I'm like, this is the problem with this community.

[12:29] How is that one of the greatest theme integrated pins of all time?

[12:33] It has absolutely none of the musical songs from the movie itself.

[12:37] They do not synchronize the clips from the movie with the voice actors in the movie.

[12:41] They don't have all the call outs from the film in the game.

[12:44] And then we have people these must be newbies or something.

[12:47] We have people saying that's the best theme integrated pinball machine of all time.

[12:51] And for anyone to say that, it's like, go play a Lord of the Rings.

[12:55] Go play a Tron.

[12:56] Go play a guns and roses.

[12:58] Go play something where there's real integration.

[13:01] And as long as we have all these newbies with no expectations driving the prices up in pinball,

[13:06] we're going to keep getting stern cutting corners.

[13:09] And I think we're going to see it with jaws.

[13:10] If we don't see theme integration done right, I don't know.

[13:13] Is everybody going to run to it?

[13:15] If all they do is animate the movie and don't give us anything from the movie, we shall

[13:19] see.

[13:20] Matt M. said, his wish is the collapse of the new and box market and maybe a manufacturer

[13:25] closing their doors for good to hopefully bring pricing down a few notches and increase

[13:31] value.

[13:32] These things should not cost as much as a car.

[13:36] Wow, Matt M. I mean, Matt, you're wishing for a little bit of doom and gloom.

[13:40] You're wishing for some consequences for these manufacturers who have really taken prices

[13:45] through the roof.

[13:46] I'm going to say this Matt right now.

[13:48] I think your wish is going to come true.

[13:50] I think we're going to see a couple of pinball companies collapse.

[13:54] If everything stays where it is at, there are too many games.

[13:57] We are oversaturated.

[13:59] I think the company and biggest jeopardy of collapsing right now is American pinball.

[14:04] Because if this new mystery company comes out and shows us a great theme integrated licensed

[14:09] pinball machine that we can have and it's built well and that factory looks really nice,

[14:14] it looks like they're going to screw together a nice machine.

[14:17] If they give us something that looks like it's something we really want, how many people

[14:21] are going to want to cancel their galactic tank force orders?

[14:24] Heck, people are not even ordering galactic tank force.

[14:27] We know that Ryan McQuade's game is not ready.

[14:29] It's not right around the corner.

[14:31] How is American pinball going to stay viable?

[14:34] They've been around for like seven years and they haven't had a single hit game yet.

[14:39] I mean, four or five games into their portfolio and they still don't know what the market

[14:43] wants.

[14:44] People are labeled for extinction.

[14:46] If you don't know how to give this community what they want and you're going to go through

[14:50] the effort to make a game, you're going to be out of business in 2024.

[14:54] Because again, at these prices, people are not going to buy two or three games.

[14:58] They're going to buy one only.

[14:59] And so then you're competing with the best from Stern, the best of Keith Elwin.

[15:03] You're competing with Steve Ritchie and Jersey Jack Pinball.

[15:06] You're competing with Dutch Pinball.

[15:07] You're competing with everybody.

[15:09] You're competing with Pulp Fiction.

[15:10] And then you're going to come out with galactic tank force and think there's going to be a

[15:13] room in someone's collection for that.

[15:16] And the other thing I'm hearing mad is like people are out of space.

[15:19] So they got to get rid of stuff.

[15:20] People are not going to just run at every single new and box game.

[15:23] I think we're going to see a company or two close in 2024.

[15:26] All right.

[15:27] Ken Chilada says, I want to see just one new game packed with impressive mechanical

[15:31] features that is worth its sticker price.

[15:33] I want to finish restoring a few games and sell before they use market completely tanks.

[15:39] I want my pin side ignore list to stop growing.

[15:41] All right.

[15:42] I hear what you're saying.

[15:43] Look, we're seeing a common theme here.

[15:45] A lot of people just want more mechanical magic in these games.

[15:49] I think we're all on the same page.

[15:51] I think we're going to see some mechanical magic in Jaws.

[15:55] If Steve Ritchie and Jack Guinari are to be believed, I think we're going to see a lot

[15:59] more mechanical magic in Steve Ritchie's Jersey Jack Elton John than we did see in Godfather.

[16:05] I think we're going to see way more in it than we saw in Toy Story 4.

[16:09] So we shall see.

[16:10] All right.

[16:11] My good friend, Derek Stutzman chimed in.

[16:12] His number one wish is peace and harmony among pinball creators.

[16:16] Derek, I can tell you right now, your wish is never going to come true.

[16:20] There are just certain people in this industry that do not like me.

[16:23] And hey, maybe I don't like them.

[16:25] And every time I try to reach out and bury the hatchet, guess what?

[16:28] They don't want to bury the hatchet and they want to hold on to their anger.

[16:32] And so my point of view is just let them stew.

[16:34] We're having a good time here.

[16:36] Nobody's disrupting this show.

[16:38] We're just growing in popularity.

[16:39] And meanwhile, we've got more subscribers than all of them combined.

[16:43] Derek, they're never going to want to get along with me.

[16:46] Most of the pinball creators that are out there are content creators.

[16:50] They're in the back pocket of these manufacturers.

[16:52] They're just shilling and they're getting kickbacks and they know that and they don't

[16:56] want you to know that.

[16:57] All right.

[16:58] Number two is wish for manufacturers to realize they went too far and reduce prices to the

[17:02] pre-COVID levels.

[17:03] Derek, you're on the same page as everybody else.

[17:06] We all want to see either the mechanical magic go through the roof or we need to have a price

[17:11] adjustment.

[17:12] I don't think they're going to do it.

[17:14] I'll tell you why because I think they're embarrassed.

[17:16] I think it's highly embarrassing if they lower the price, even though Elon Musk will do it,

[17:21] even though Ford Motor Company will do it, Sony and Microsoft will do it.

[17:25] There's something about these pinball companies.

[17:28] It's like they can never admit they ever make a mistake.

[17:30] The only people in this industry that admit they make mistakes is yours truly, Canada.

[17:34] I make a lot of them people.

[17:36] All right.

[17:37] Rakim Sanders says, happy B-day.

[17:39] I'd like to see one of these titles to be made so I can retire from pinball machine purchasing

[17:44] since these pinball companies have killed my interest this year with their stupid pricing.

[17:49] Then he lists He-Man, Masters of the Universe, Beavis and Butthead, Megadeth, G.I. Joe, they

[17:55] live, Lost Boys or the Goonies.

[17:58] Is it they live or they live?

[17:59] I don't know.

[18:00] Someone make one of these so I can peace out.

[18:02] Look, Rakim, I understand what you're saying here, man.

[18:04] I think we all have that dream theme where if somebody makes it, we'd be good.

[18:09] Like we would just get it and we'd be good.

[18:11] For me, it would be Akira or it would be Generation One Transformers, the movie.

[18:16] If someone made either of those, Akira or G1 Transformer, the movie, I would never buy

[18:21] another pinball machine again.

[18:23] I would simply own it and be happy and spend the rest of my days and the rest of my money

[18:28] taking my pinball friends out for amazing dinners like Derek and I did.

[18:32] I mean, Omakase dinners left and right.

[18:35] Derek was getting tommy jazz.

[18:37] We went to Korean barbecue, Michelin star restaurants.

[18:40] We had so much fun in 48 hours.

[18:43] We went through New York City and you know what didn't cross our mind?

[18:46] How can we go play pinball right now?

[18:48] No, we live life the right way.

[18:50] There's a time and place for pinball, but it is not when you are trying to have a

[18:54] good time with your friend in a city like New York.

[18:57] All right, Stefan B said, prices that are affordable for average earners.

[19:01] Stefan, that is not going to happen.

[19:03] And number two, a new Rocky pinball machine built by a decent pinball company.

[19:08] Well, Stefan, if we could get Rocky for, I think that is a buy it now theme for many,

[19:14] many of us.

[19:15] I mean, if they get the soundtrack in that game, there's no easy way out.

[19:19] I hope someone like Dutch pinball could look into something like that.

[19:22] I would much rather have Rocky for than Elton John.

[19:26] I don't think your wish is going to come true because it's probably an expensive

[19:29] license to get.

[19:30] But again, at these prices, go get it.

[19:33] Go get the expensive license because you're charging us so much money for these games.

[19:38] All right, and Yong said, Stern to fix their reset issues.

[19:41] I can deal with coil stops, but hard reboots are really bad.

[19:45] Yeah, I've been hearing more and more whenever Stern does a code update,

[19:48] there's reboot issues.

[19:49] I don't know how many machines it's impacting, but I do hope your wish comes true.

[19:54] Stern has the most robust coding department in all of pinball.

[19:58] So I think if anyone's going to figure it out, it's going to be Stern.

[20:01] I mean, let's talk about these Foo Fighter owners.

[20:03] They just got a new code update this week with a new wizard mode and a new song.

[20:07] And I was thinking to myself, can you imagine being a guns and roses owner?

[20:11] And you've gone over seven hundred and fifteen days without a code update.

[20:16] And Stern's been updating the code to Foo Fighters since the game came out in March.

[20:21] It's absolutely embarrassing what it's like to own a Jersey Jack machine.

[20:25] And if you own a Stern machine, you have to be feeling good that they're not going

[20:29] to stop until they make that game perfect.

[20:31] And nobody has a better track record of updating games than Stern Pinball.

[20:35] All right, Kelly Daniel says that the pinball market sinks and leaves only Stern

[20:40] pinball cranking them out at a lower price.

[20:42] Rest in peace boutiques.

[20:44] Damn it, Kelly. Throw in some mad shade on the boutique industry.

[20:49] I actually don't hope your wish comes true, Kelly.

[20:51] I'll tell you why.

[20:52] I think we need boutique pinball, but we need boutique pinball like Dutch.

[20:56] We need boutique pinball that does it right.

[20:58] We need boutique pinball that is like the Bugatti of pinball.

[21:02] They need to show us what can be done when they don't try to sell volume.

[21:06] They need to show us what can really be in a machine if you want to charge people

[21:10] fifteen thousand dollars.

[21:12] The only people that are really going to load up a machine for thirteen to fifteen

[21:17] thousand dollars is going to be a boutique company that actually has a

[21:22] talented team of designers and engineers.

[21:25] We haven't really seen that happen other than Dutch pinball.

[21:29] Spooky pinball has been making games all these years, but we don't see the talent

[21:33] in the design department and the mechanical engineering department.

[21:36] They keep getting better, but not a single spooky game is even at the same level

[21:41] as the big Lebowski was ten years ago.

[21:43] And they've been making money and been successful.

[21:46] They now need to invest in more mechanical engineers and more designers and more

[21:50] coders, but we're waiting.

[21:52] And you know, and as we've been waiting for spooky to get better and better,

[21:55] their prices have gone up and up and up.

[21:57] But I wouldn't say the product has gone up and up and up.

[22:00] I think they figured out if you just make the game sexy and you have a decent

[22:04] theme, you're going to sell enough of them to keep the line going for a year and a half.

[22:08] All right.

[22:08] Bev said his wish is Elvira's fourth pinball machine.

[22:12] Bev, that is a great wish.

[22:13] I don't think we're going to see it, but I think if they made another Elvira,

[22:17] I think it would be successful.

[22:19] JB Sweet says, happy birthday, Chris.

[22:22] Wishing for lower prices, better mechs, assets and toys, bad ass masculine themes,

[22:26] more loveless hate on pin side between members and peace between content creators.

[22:31] Ah, you know, we can all wish for that.

[22:34] And it could happen.

[22:35] You know, look, crazier things have happened in the world.

[22:37] Major world powers have settled their differences.

[22:41] If they can do it, we all can do it.

[22:43] I feel like this is like a Rocky Forest speech.

[22:45] If I can change, you can change.

[22:46] We all can change with Canada, with the American flag draped around him.

[22:50] But JB sweets, thank you for your wishes.

[22:52] I think you're again, mirroring everything everyone else is saying.

[22:55] We want more in the games.

[22:56] We want people to get along more in the hobby.

[22:59] And we just want to go back to having fun in pinball.

[23:01] It's not fun when pinball content creators are arguing with each other.

[23:05] It's not fun when these prices go through the roof.

[23:08] It's not fun when we feel like we're being ripped off.

[23:10] All right.

[23:11] Espy says his wishes are to keep traveling to new locations, to play new pins versus owning.

[23:16] I think that's great for more under the glass and new machines at current prices.

[23:20] Unfortunately, Stern proved it doesn't have to example Jurassic Park anniversary

[23:26] FOMO edition with only bling and a higher price versus making standard premiums.

[23:30] Oh, well, still wishing folks will just say no, but won't happen in 2024.

[23:34] You know, Espy, you know, we'll see what happens, Espy.

[23:37] I think more and more people are going to hit pause on this stuff.

[23:39] You know, Espy, here's the thing.

[23:41] Stern came out right with that FOMO edition of Jurassic Park.

[23:44] And Jurassic Park is one of the best games they've ever made.

[23:47] It's one of the most popular games they've ever made.

[23:49] And I'm happy to report as of my birthday, September 25th.

[23:53] Stern has still not sold out those Jurassic Park 30th anniversary editions.

[23:58] And they probably were thinking, oh, we're just going to make 500 and they're

[24:01] going to sell out instantly.

[24:02] We're seeing people wait.

[24:04] We're seeing people wait it out.

[24:05] And we know those games are going to go down in price.

[24:08] And now we're seeing all these older LEDs flood the market because people now want

[24:12] the new shinier version of the game.

[24:13] Because if you love Jurassic Park, you're going to want this newer version of it.

[24:18] I think the whole move stinks.

[24:19] I don't like that they made more LEDs like this.

[24:22] And I think, again, they don't really respect the collectors.

[24:25] And I think if the collectors start to turn away from these companies,

[24:28] they're going to be in big trouble because it's always been the pinball collector

[24:32] who buys every new and box game, regardless of what the game is.

[24:36] That's what's kept pinball going all of these years.

[24:39] And I think that community has really been abused by these pinball companies

[24:44] over the last couple of years.

[24:46] All right, Todd Tucky says, I wish to see the pinball community prosper with

[24:49] the enthusiasm and interest and camaraderie.

[24:52] I saw at the Massachusetts pinfest a couple of weeks ago, everyone had so much

[24:57] fun simply enjoying pinball and a mix of people from all over the world.

[25:02] Todd, I think that's a great wish.

[25:03] World peace, everybody.

[25:05] Come together.

[25:06] Kumbaya.

[25:07] We're all at a pinball event.

[25:08] Having a good time.

[25:09] And Todd, here's the thing.

[25:10] I've been to many events with Todd.

[25:13] I've been to many pinball shows.

[25:14] And when everyone just gets to the show, it doesn't matter if there's differences.

[25:19] Everyone gets along.

[25:20] There's nobody fighting.

[25:22] There's nobody throwing drinks.

[25:23] There's no drama.

[25:25] And that is what's so disappointed me about the Kinetis is banning me from the

[25:29] pinball media mixer, because if they just invited me, it would have been a good

[25:33] time for everybody and they should have known better.

[25:36] But once you start banning people and putting them in a prison cell, especially

[25:39] when they're the number one freaking pinball podcaster for the last six

[25:43] freaking years and you're going to throw a media mixer and say, you're not allowed.

[25:48] Then what do you think you're going to get?

[25:49] You think you're going to get an understanding, Canada, or you're going

[25:52] to get Canada upset and then you get exactly what you wanted from him.

[25:55] And now he doesn't get to enjoy the greatest pinball podcast because he took

[25:59] his ball and he went home.

[26:00] All right.

[26:00] PJ Delay wishes for a price correction.

[26:03] PJ, you and everybody else wants prices to go down.

[26:06] Dave Sanders wishes for getting another big release game out.

[26:09] Unlikely end of 2024 and it depends on what IP I can get and who's on

[26:14] board with the project, but it's something to at least aim for.

[26:18] And all the criticisms about lack of magic are being taken on board.

[26:22] All right.

[26:22] So Dave Sanders, who's a designer, he designed alien pinball.

[26:25] He designed full throttle.

[26:27] I think he designed Pony Factory.

[26:28] Dave, look, we all hope you get that big IP and someone's on board for it.

[26:33] The thing is this, Dave, these new companies are starting to develop.

[26:37] You know, they're starting to develop and they know what the bar is.

[26:39] And I think we're going to see some of this stuff.

[26:41] And I do hope, my friend, that you get your hands on an IP that you truly love.

[26:46] And you can show us what you're truly capable of working with someone whose

[26:49] first name is not Andrew.

[26:51] Okay.

[26:51] We hope that for you, brother.

[26:53] All right.

[26:53] A few more.

[26:53] This is fun.

[26:54] I haven't really read your stuff in a long time.

[26:56] So it's really nice to give all of my listeners a chance to have their thoughts

[27:00] aired out on an episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[27:03] William Morris says, a vault of stranger things, Ellie.

[27:06] Well, look, William, I think you're going to get a vault of stranger things premium.

[27:09] I don't think they're going to make more.

[27:12] A matrix or an Akira pin, both well done with mechs and toys.

[27:16] William, I think we're going to get the matrix.

[27:18] I don't think we're going to get Akira because the people who run these pinball

[27:22] companies are old curmudgens who don't understand the power of the Japanese anime

[27:28] market and they don't understand the overlap of Akira with the kind of people

[27:33] who buy pinball machines.

[27:34] And there's much more overlap with Akira than there is with Octoberfest or

[27:40] Galactic Tank Force.

[27:41] Heck, I would say there's more Akira geeks out there than even Rush fans out

[27:45] there in the world.

[27:46] And for you Rush fans, please do not email me.

[27:49] I get it.

[27:49] You like Rush.

[27:50] You like going to a concert where it's all guys wearing khaki pants.

[27:54] Don't reach out to me.

[27:55] I get it.

[27:56] All right.

[27:56] Richard Burnham says a JAWS title will be a litmus test for price tolerance.

[28:01] Blow out your candles in hopes of an enthusiastic pause, sending stern a clear

[28:06] message after Venom's failure.

[28:08] They feel it and need it.

[28:09] Well, look, Richard, Richard, I've been saying this for a while.

[28:12] Like all of this wait and see, there's going to be FOMO around JAWS.

[28:16] There's always going to be FOMO around a Keith Elwin title.

[28:19] So I fully expect people to be banging on the doors of distributors to get their

[28:24] hands on a JAWS LE or SLE machine.

[28:27] And I think that game has the power to override the wait and see philosophy.

[28:32] But I've been saying this, there's only two things that you need to move quickly

[28:36] on right now in the pinball industry, a Keith Elwin pin or a triple A theme.

[28:41] That's a buy it now title.

[28:43] And I think JAWS has kind of both of that.

[28:45] And that's why I fully expect this machine to sell out day one.

[28:49] I don't think Steve Richie's Elton John is going to sell out day one, no matter

[28:53] what's in it, because the theme just isn't there.

[28:55] Resonate said a wide body game that allows room for more mechs and layout innovation.

[29:00] Well, wow, Rez, thank you for this wish.

[29:02] This is the first time we've heard someone say they want wide body games back

[29:06] in the pinball world.

[29:08] I don't think we're going to get it.

[29:09] I think the only way we would get a wide body game is if Eric Minier wanted to go

[29:13] back to wide body layouts.

[29:15] You know, Jersey Jack was really the only company that was doing this.

[29:18] Spooky as a wide body Scooby Doo, but it's not really a wide body.

[29:22] It's just got a wide upper play field.

[29:24] But the rest of that game is in a standard play field size, just in a wide

[29:28] body cabinet. I don't know.

[29:29] I think these companies are trying to cut their costs while they charge us more

[29:32] money. So I don't think we're going to see a wide body game next year.

[29:36] All right, Bond said first and foremost, a pinball pause of no buying till

[29:40] sanity on price versus value comes in alignment again with bombs equal to asking

[29:45] price, Stearns, sixty five hundred pros, eighty five hundred dollar premiums

[29:49] and ten thousand dollar five hundred L.E.s.

[29:52] Well, that's what the pricing was when we had Godzilla.

[29:55] Bond, I don't think we're going to go back to that.

[29:57] He then says still plenty of money for the manufacturer.

[30:00] JJP, nine thousand dollar L.E.s.

[30:03] eleven thousand dollars C.E.s.

[30:04] Well, look, Bond, C.E.s were never eleven thousand dollars with Jersey Jack.

[30:08] They were always twelve thousand five hundred dollars.

[30:11] So I do think Jersey Jack's sweet spot is ninety five hundred for L.E.s and

[30:15] twelve five for the C.E.s.

[30:17] And then he writes spooky competing with the pros sixty five hundred S.E.

[30:21] Eight thousand dollars C.E.

[30:23] Pinball will pick up again with new inbox to home use only values being

[30:27] restored for buying then secondary selling when new games come out.

[30:30] Basically what Bond is saying and all of that, I want prices to go back to what

[30:35] they were before COVID and it's not going to happen.

[30:37] It's not going to happen.

[30:38] I think these companies are going to learn a harsh lesson as they keep prices this high.

[30:43] J.W. says for prices, new inbox to come down or much more bang for the buck.

[30:48] J. We all agree.

[30:49] Jeff S. says Stern's biotechnology laboratory to clone Keith Elwin.

[30:54] Well, that is the first time I've heard someone ask for a clone of Keith Elwin.

[30:57] Well, the good news is this, Jeff, the good news, Jeff S.

[30:59] is we're going to see two Keith Elwin games in twenty twenty four.

[31:03] So whether or not both of those games are coming from Keith Elwin or the second

[31:07] game is coming from his clone, I think you're going to be very happy with Keith

[31:11] Elwin and what he delivers for the pinball world next year.

[31:14] All right.

[31:14] Alex M. says, give me Texas Chainsaw Massacre in a limited 500 release and

[31:19] packet spooky.

[31:20] I think you're going to get that, Alex.

[31:21] I think you're going to get Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[31:23] I don't think it's going to be 500.

[31:25] My guess is they're going to make 750 of them.

[31:28] They're going to go back to the number they did with Rick and Morty and they're

[31:31] going to give some secondhand value back to the pinball buying community.

[31:35] I think they're going to make 750 evil deads and I think they're going to make

[31:39] 750 Texas Chainsaw Massacre games for a grand total of 1500 games.

[31:45] And I think they're going to have two lines and two machines.

[31:47] And I don't think they're going to share the same design like they did with

[31:51] Ultraman and Halloween.

[31:52] And I think it's going to be a smart move for spooky.

[31:55] All right.

[31:55] Will Ware said lower prices.

[31:57] Will, we are all on the same board.

[31:59] I don't think it's going to happen.

[32:01] And then our HK said hoping for more dad rock and 70s titles.

[32:05] I think he's joking.

[32:07] Everybody, thank you so much for all of these wishes.

[32:09] We saw a lot of overlap.

[32:12] Everybody wants prices to come back to reality.

[32:15] Everybody wants loaded games.

[32:17] People want triple A themes.

[32:19] We all kind of want the same thing.

[32:21] And the question now is this, are they going to give us what we want?

[32:26] This is a really good sample size of people who buy pinball machines.

[32:30] If you're listening to Canada's pinball podcast, you're a pinball collector.

[32:34] You probably own a bunch of machines.

[32:36] Your wishes need to be heard by these pinball companies.

[32:40] Nobody wants more expensive games.

[32:42] Nobody wants baron games.

[32:44] Nobody wants themes that don't resonate with us, that we don't have an emotional

[32:49] connection to. And yet when you look at what the games have been over the last few years,

[32:53] the majority of the games that have come out have not checked the boxes that all of you

[32:58] just said, and that's a problem.

[33:01] And nobody else talks like Canada.

[33:03] Nobody says this industry needs to wake up.

[33:05] This industry needs to change.

[33:07] Everyone else is just out there shilling these games and shilling these companies.

[33:11] And it makes no sense to me.

[33:12] Why would we root to put money in the pocket of stern and distributors?

[33:17] Shouldn't we be rooting that we get the magic, that everything gets passed on to us,

[33:22] that the value to us is so great that we don't even care about making our distributor

[33:26] friends rich. We don't even care about making stern multimillionaires because we're

[33:31] all so happy. And I think that's what I've noticed in pinball is like the balance is

[33:36] not there right now. We're making all of these people money,

[33:39] but we're not getting what we really want in return.

[33:43] I hope in 2024 we start to see more balance in the pinball world.

[33:48] We start to see games that justify these prices and we start to talk more about how

[33:53] much we love these games and a lot less about how much we don't like each other

[33:58] in the pinball content creator world. That's what we want, everybody.

[34:03] Get your Twippy votes ready.

[34:05] The greatest birthday gift you can give me will come later this year when the Twippy

[34:09] voting happens, everybody. I can't wait to everybody else slams the Twippies.

[34:13] And we head up there for number seven. Everybody have a great day.

[34:17] Thank you for all of your birthday wishes.

[34:19] And I mean it when I say it. Take care of yourselves.

[34:22] Take care of your health. It's the most important thing.

[34:26] As we get older, we're going to want to enjoy the short time we have on this planet

[34:30] more and more with the people we love. And if you don't take care of yourselves,

[34:35] you're not going to have fun playing pinball.

[34:37] You're not going to have fun going on vacations.

[34:40] You're not going to be able to enjoy the best years of your life and the best years

[34:44] of your life, they really do happen when you get over that Rubicon, right?

[34:48] You start to get in front of your finances.

[34:50] You get in front of everything. You have a little bit more wisdom.

[34:52] You look at these vapid Gen Z kids taking stupid Instagram photos.

[34:56] And you laugh at them because you know what's valuable in life.

[35:00] But man, your health is the most valuable thing you can do.

[35:03] Everybody, I love you.

[35:05] Take care of yourselves and we'll be back with more episodes of

[35:07] Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[35:09] And thank you for all your wishes and thank you for all your birthday wishes for me.

[35:12] Peace.
