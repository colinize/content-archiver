[00:00] Because every time we touch, I get this feeling and every time we kiss, I swear I can fly

[00:06] Can't you feel my heart beat fast? Oh, oh this is last, need you find my last

[00:20] Welcome to episode 229 of Canada's Pinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada. It's Sunday morning. It's New York City

[00:28] It is a beautiful beautiful day out. It's the kind of day where the last thing you should do is be inside playing any

[00:35] Pinball, but we'll talk a little bit about pinball. I'm going to air an interview on this episode where I talk to a listener of the show

[00:43] Scott about pinball and marketing and Scott works in marketing so we want to have a little discussion and where it's a fun interview

[00:50] We're gonna go down and talk about

[00:53] What's going on in the pinball world from a marketing perspective and some advice we would give to every pinball man

[00:58] You factor out there if we were to give them some free marketing advice, but before that

[01:03] Let's talk a little bit about some news going on in the pinball world and then I'm gonna read some of your emails and then I'll air the

[01:10] Interview so this this should be a little bit like an hour 20 minute podcast

[01:15] So I hope you have that much time to dedicate to canada. All right, let's talk about pinball news

[01:20] So I think the thing that was blowing up sort of at the end of the week was highway pinball and

[01:28] There are a couple developments that have a lot of people really nervous that the highway pinball

[01:35] The ship is about to sink and I don't think it's quite there yet

[01:39] I mean we've been we've been saying this company is gonna fail and they are gonna fail

[01:43] It is it is just a matter of when not a question of if like there is just no way this company is gonna survive

[01:51] But you know as we've seen in the pinball world

[01:54] The amount of time it takes for a pinball company to die is

[01:59] Unnaturally long right pinball companies can survive for years without making anything happen

[02:06] And I think it's just pinball that does that but here's what here's what's happened coin taker the main distributor for

[02:13] Highway pinball in America has decided to no longer

[02:18] Take orders on alien pinball they have stopped taking any money on the games

[02:24] They also are not going to pay

[02:27] Highway pinball anymore money for games that were ordered and I and I called up Chris at coin taker

[02:34] Just to get some clarification on on what was going on and here's what he told me and and Chris is a great guy

[02:39] Chris and Melissa are awesome

[02:41] Coin taker is a great distributor and for you guys out there

[02:44] You should always buy from a distributor because your money will never be in jeopardy if you gave it to a distributor

[02:51] When you give your money to a manufacturer

[02:53] Then you're in real trouble if you want to get a refund, but so here's what Chris told me

[02:57] He said look the problem is this we have had nothing but issues with alien pinball machines and the company themselves has been

[03:08] pretty

[03:10] How do I say this highway pinball has been very slow to give us any sort of manual or assistance in helping us fix games of

[03:20] consumers so

[03:22] Coin taker actually had a buy back a couple alien pinball machines from

[03:28] Customers because they were having so many mechanical issues and think about it if you're in their shoes if you're a distributor

[03:34] The last thing you want to be doing is selling people a product that is having nothing but

[03:41] Issues and quality problems and then you and you can't help them fix it right?

[03:46] This isn't like stern pinball where

[03:48] Stern will immediately help you get what you need to get your game running again

[03:52] Okay, so they've said you know what I can't we can't sell

[03:58] Damage goods we can't sell a game. That's a ticking time bomb

[04:01] And because of that and because of highways ultra slow

[04:06] Response to getting them help with with with customer games that have gone down

[04:10] They've said we're done. We're not selling these games anymore. It's not worth it

[04:14] It's a headache and so that is a huge blow to the future of highway pinball

[04:19] The other huge blow is that helmet the quality control guy over there

[04:23] He's left the company and he was the one guy that was always constantly helping people out and getting back to people

[04:30] He was like the only only one responding

[04:33] You know the highway owners over there the you know the dream team that that assembled themselves and you know

[04:39] They were all these amazing businessmen. They don't talk to anybody. They don't respond. They're not on the forums

[04:44] They're not emailing owners. They literally have everyone

[04:48] Completely in the dark about what is going on over there and for those of you out there who really thought you were very very close to getting your

[04:56] Alien Ellie pinball machine. I think now you probably feel like you're just as far away today as you were a year ago

[05:04] When Andrew highway was still promising Ellie's we're gonna go out in two weeks, all right?

[05:08] So the future for highway pinball we all know it

[05:11] We all know which direction this company's going in and it's not north. It's the opposite of that

[05:17] And it's just you know, I look I've said it before I don't want people to lose money

[05:21] But I also don't want these companies to stick around forever and can make crappy products and that's the thing is this is

[05:29] It's a crap it the product is not working well. It is not working well and there

[05:34] I really think they need to just stop trying to make Andrew highway's game and

[05:40] Stop the production line and re-engineer the thing to work work well

[05:45] I mean that is the only way out for this company. They can't keep shipping games that are breaking all right

[05:51] So we'll see I still predict that this company not gonna make it into 2019

[05:55] I mean I would I would be shocked if I see them turn the corner all right

[05:59] Some other pinball news out there. So

[06:02] Did you read that people are actually paying one thousand dollars or more

[06:08] Over MSRP for total nuclear annihilation

[06:11] They are basically buying other people's spots in line to get the game sooner. I think that's pretty awesome

[06:18] I always love it when when and when a game is so popular that people are willing to pay more than

[06:25] MSRP to get it faster

[06:27] All right, I think that's that's another great feather in the cap for Scott Denise that people are

[06:33] valuing his game even more than spooky price to that

[06:37] Speaking of I'll jump to this one

[06:40] So I had a laugh that

[06:42] Zach over at straight down the middle pinball is selling his Houdini for

[06:48] $8,200 that was kind of like wait what like the game is used

[06:52] $8,200 the game knew is

[06:55] $7,000 and I don't think there's

[06:58] $1200 in

[07:01] Upgrades on this machine. I know that Houdini's backlog so if you want it now you can get it now

[07:07] And he's got stuff like pin stadium lights in it and pdi glass and whatnot

[07:11] I also just kind of found it funny that you know these guys were all in on Houdini Houdini so great

[07:17] I love when I see that right where people are like this game's amazing. It's incredible

[07:21] I love Houdini. I love it. I love it. I love it and it's for sale like in two weeks like you know games awesome

[07:28] Time to move on from it, right?

[07:30] And I don't know like what does that say they haven't had the game that long why they get why they get why they parting ways with Houdini so quickly

[07:36] I mean maybe these these guys do go through a lot of games because they're they they're really

[07:41] In the pinball they have their show. I love them. I love Greg and Zach

[07:45] But I don't know I always kind of find it funny when people like less than 200 plays, you know

[07:51] And now I got to get rid of it and it's sort of not always the best way to sell your game, but

[07:57] Houdini is up for sale if you're really looking for one tomorrow

[08:00] There's one for sale from Zach. All right. All right. What else is going on? So

[08:06] Deeproot

[08:07] says that they have first dibs on

[08:10] Harry Potter from Warner Brothers if the pinball machine is going to be made apparently there was a memo that was sent to me by Robert Mueller

[08:19] That I apparently didn't get

[08:22] Robert talked to me about licensing. I said I didn't know what I was talking about

[08:27] But it seems that he's got first dibs on Harry Potter

[08:31] Not exactly sure why Warner Brothers are universal who has the rights to Harry Potter would give first dibs of one of the most

[08:39] Or you know one of the biggest franchises in the history of franchises gives first dibs to a pinball manufacturer that hasn't actually made one game yet

[08:49] So I don't know how that worked out

[08:51] I can tell that Robert like probably needs to start showing something

[08:55] I think it's at the point now where he jumps into a thread

[08:58] He said this inside the Jersey Jack pinball pirates the Caribbean thread and immediately got 15 downvotes

[09:04] So my advice for Robert and we're going to give Robert some advice on on this episode when we talk about the different manufacturers

[09:11] But I think Robert is going to realize that tpf is going to come up sooner than he expects

[09:17] And for him to start getting goodwill going here's what I would do Robert. I know you listen to this podcast

[09:23] Show us. I challenge you to show us

[09:28] Something that you have fixed in magic girl. Okay about 14 to 1500 people

[09:34] Listen to this podcast. They talk about this podcast. I challenge you to show me

[09:40] That you have fixed something on John pop-a-dooks game

[09:44] That wasn't working

[09:46] When it shipped from American pinball so have you fixed the center mechanism?

[09:49] You know that big automaton have you fixed that have you fixed the levitating ball chamber the king's chamber

[09:56] Show me something that you fix have you added a ball octah magic girl

[10:00] Because I think it's at the point now

[10:02] Where you're less than a year away from your big reveal but at least show us a work in progress something something that you're going

[10:10] That's going on and here's the thing because magic girl we've already seen it

[10:13] So I want to see like what you guys have done. I want to see some real progress because

[10:18] Uh all that big talk

[10:20] And so just back it up with a little bit. All right nothing big just show us that's it. Canada challenges. Robert Mueller to show us one thing on magic girl

[10:29] That is now working that wasn't previously working as a sign that deep-roo pinball can actually do what they say they're going to do

[10:37] So Robert will you accept that challenge?

[10:39] Let's see. I'll give you a month. I'll give you a month surely

[10:43] Surely you can sit John down long enough to figure out what the hell he was trying to do with magic girl. All right

[10:49] All right, let's see so iron maiden iron maiden hype. I don't think I've seen anything like it. I really don't

[10:56] I've never seen a game

[10:59] So much universal praise and accolades and this is from people who are playing it right?

[11:05] This isn't just like this isn't in art contest anymore. I really and you know and zombie Yeti

[11:10] It's isn't it amazing how we're now used to incredible artwork like zombie Yeti

[11:15] I think we're sort of becoming almost a little

[11:17] Decentitize to the art packages like cool cool cool

[11:21] But the game still needs to shoot amazingly well and all I keep seeing from people is how much they love the way

[11:29] Keith L wins game shoots and then and I think we have to just

[11:33] say stern has a home run on their hands a home run

[11:35] I mean I haven't heard anyone who's played the game was like it's not good and here's the thing too

[11:39] It's not just like the rewarding nature of the shots that I keep hearing about I keep hearing the code is great

[11:46] And I keep hearing that even if you're not an iron maiden fan

[11:51] What makes the game fun and addictive is the pinball experience?

[11:55] All right, there's one person who's not an iron maiden fan and they won't shut up about it

[11:59] And that's our good friend oric he just keeps going into the thread and reminding people almost on a daily basis that he is not a fan of iron made in music

[12:07] And we get it and he keeps saying it again and again and again and again and again

[12:13] So you know hopefully we'll hear him say it some more this week because it never gets old

[12:18] But what I do know is this a couple things one is the artwork is approved

[12:24] So they are taking photos of the Ellie and the Ellie should be going on the line probably any day now

[12:30] So we are probably going to see the Ellie premium art packages this week

[12:35] Which I think everyone is waiting for you. We have never seen such a delay in getting that

[12:39] The other thing I think that is absolutely stupid is people who say they're gonna get this pinball machine

[12:46] And change the music using like pen browser to another band's music

[12:52] I just for the record

[12:53] I think if you take a music pin and you swap that band's music for another

[13:00] band's music

[13:01] That is the dumbest thing you could possibly do that is like that is like me taking a dodge

[13:07] Challenger and putting forward badges on it

[13:11] It is the equivalent of that it is so

[13:15] Stupid leave it as iron maiden if you really don't like iron maiden then don't get it all right

[13:22] Okay, let's go on so pirate to the Caribbean the spinning discate fiasco continues to go on

[13:28] I think people will get over it. I do I gave you my reasons why I got a refund on pirate to the Caribbean collectors edition

[13:36] I also just think like in general

[13:38] The collector's edition packages are kind of ridiculously overpriced

[13:43] I don't think anyone feels like yeah like it's worth it

[13:46] And I also just don't think that david jones art package

[13:50] It I don't want to look at that squid guys face. I kind of well

[13:54] I just wish Jack would have made the black pearl edition be the collector's edition

[13:58] I think for those of you out there who who love this game who like from the you know this this change is not gonna destroy it for you

[14:07] But I do think it's a big it's a big deal and I do I think some people who are saying it's not a big deal

[14:12] I think they're wrong. I think they have to go back if you go back and watch the way they market at this game

[14:18] The removal of those discs is a huge deal. It was a huge feature and it was a huge selling point

[14:23] Um and like I gave Eric some advice and and I just think they have to be more careful jurzy jack pinball and how they

[14:31] position stuff

[14:32] You don't want the one piece of content up there to be your designer bummed out like making you know sort of like deflated like

[14:41] Like again like you have to you have to present this stuff in a better way

[14:46] But where's jack in all this so I heard jack is in he's in Europe and what I keep hearing is like jack is desperately trying to get

[14:54] More sales going on the European front and get his distribution channels built up more because

[15:01] You know, I'm starting to hear those rumors again that like not all is financially super duper over at jurzy jack pinball

[15:07] But I think it's always been that way. I don't think jurzy jack is really like made money on like any of these games

[15:13] I think that without this billionaire investor

[15:17] The things can't be going so well over at jurzy jack pinball and you know any day any day that guy could just decide he's he's done with it

[15:26] And what makes me sad is that jack should make money on every game like jacks games are

[15:32] So much you know, there's so much more than what everyone else is doing

[15:36] But again as you'll hear in this podcast

[15:38] I just think from a marketing standpoint

[15:40] That's where he gets it all wrong and we we're not gonna keep going off on that

[15:44] But you know, he should be releasing themes that make people want to just throw their money at him immediately

[15:49] All right

[15:50] Any other news in the pinball world. I'm trying to see here

[15:54] Ah nope. I think that pretty much covers what is going on a few p3s have shipped

[16:01] Who deenies are still backlogged

[16:04] Alice Cooper is ramping up. So let's read some of your user feedback. All right, let's see

[16:10] I got an email from

[16:15] Okay, let's do Todd so Chris Todd enters says

[16:19] Chris you are right on a lot of what you say, but you're wrong about Wizard of Oz

[16:24] All agree that was doesn't align with this perception that pinball themes need to cater to the

[16:30] edgy or culture of our society

[16:33] But if you've ever had a chance to camp on a was in a home environment

[16:36] I think you it would change your opinion you want innovation mex a world in her class like the 90s

[16:42] It has it spinning house with flip-down door to reveal the which

[16:47] Crushed by the house diverter multiple interactive magnets a spinner an interactive crystal ball with a video screen two different ball locks

[16:55] One that includes flying monkey a saucer hidden behind doors that you bash

[17:01] He goes on and on it also has a well-integrated shaker and one of the best light shows

[17:07] Yada yada yada all right the only feature I just like on my machine was the red slippers glue to the main flippers

[17:13] People like to say it's clunky, but it's only clunky because the shots align differently than other games

[17:21] A little time on the machine and that clunkiness goes away

[17:24] Oh, did I mention incredible code incredible and it all starts with multiple options on your plunge

[17:30] Plunge around to the forest and hope to light winged monkey targets

[17:34] Plunge the rollovers and hope to light to get a multiplier short plunge the upper flipper

[17:39] All right a lot of different plunging options here people can hate on the game for theme fine

[17:44] I'm not a huge was film fan either and tournament players seemingly like to ignore it too, but the game is awesome

[17:50] It's an evil machine. It's a game that fights back every step of the way

[17:54] Whether the witches casting spells are trying to ram the ball down your throat play the game in a room without distractions

[18:00] Turn up the sound and literally transports you on all right

[18:05] It's total eye candy. Okay, so Todd Anderson. Thank you

[18:10] You're not the only one who loves Wizard of Oz okay. I've heard from

[18:15] Many people who have it that they love it

[18:17] I also have heard from many people that they think it's a total clunk fest and they're and they don't like Joe Balser's design on the game

[18:25] I've played Wizard of Oz many times. I've played it on location. I've played it in home environments

[18:29] I do think Wizard of Oz is

[18:31] Probably one of the most beautiful pinball machines of all time. There's no denying it

[18:36] I mean, I do think the artwork on the play field is a little uninspired. I do. I don't think it's that

[18:43] I don't know it just doesn't do anything for me

[18:45] I also think was was is LCD integration is a little all over the place like I don't know what I'm looking at

[18:52] Like there's I get I get that you get used to it

[18:55] But that's the problem. I've always had with Wizard of Oz is

[18:58] Pinball machines shouldn't require a manual by which I need to now learn to then

[19:05] Enjoy the game like they should be pretty self-explanatory what I'm doing and what's going on

[19:10] And I don't think Wizard of Oz has that

[19:13] I and I think that's the problem with the Hobbit as well as like and I think that's gonna be the problem with Pirates the Caribbean

[19:18] I think that's a problem with almost all Jersey Jack games other than dialed in because dialed in was Pat Lawler's creation

[19:23] Dialed in it's pretty easy to understand what to do right away like shoot the guide and shoot the scoop in your in a mode

[19:29] Like I get it these other games. I just think it's like

[19:33] I you need a tutorial to learn how to play them and I think that's why these games

[19:39] Miss the mark and Wizard of Oz look look as beautiful as it is

[19:44] Why would Jack?

[19:46] You know launch a company with the theme like Wizard of Oz. I mean, that's the whole thing. It was a license too

[19:52] I mean, it's just it's just kind of weird to me

[19:55] There there are so many other properties that I think would have been more popular than Wizard of Oz and I

[20:02] And again, he sold it for 6500 bucks

[20:05] So he was losing money and everyone made but I do agree man. It is Wizard of Oz has everything in it

[20:10] I don't think you'll ever see another Jersey Jack game with as much in it as Wizard of Oz because that will always be Jack's statement game

[20:18] I mean everything to the the wood apron to the screen printed cabinets to all the stuff you mentioned Todd

[20:25] I still think was Wizard of Oz if you can get one for like a good price is a great buy all right

[20:32] I got an email from bill dot bill said canators pinball podcasts piece out and he wrote mother fuckers

[20:37] Which I said he said sitting muted on a soul crush conference called that line made my day. Thank you

[20:44] Well, I'm glad that I made you laugh bill. Thank you for writing and and thank you for listening to the show

[20:48] I got an email from Matthew Robinson Matthew. Thank you for listening to Kenny's pinball podcast

[20:54] It's very hard at the end of today's podcast while walking at wait

[20:58] He said okay, so his subject was just laughed out loud and then he said very hard at the end of today's podcast while walking outside

[21:04] You're the best as a new pinball fan just want to say I enjoy your pod more than all the others

[21:09] You make that long wait for my my iron maiden premium to be delivered a little easier

[21:14] PS

[21:15] I'm the host of a podcast called get up on this on the earwolf network

[21:20] We are general pop culture comedy podcasts, but I've talked a lot about pinball in the last few episodes as I'm recently obsessed

[21:28] Well, Matt Robinson. Thank you

[21:30] I would probably dial down the pinball talk on your pop culture podcast because you'll probably lose all your listeners

[21:36] Because nobody really cares about pinball except for us losers who are on pinside and listening to shows like this every week

[21:42] But thank you for listening to the show, Matt. I really appreciate it. I got an email from Joe Perino

[21:47] He said iron maiden hype is crazy

[21:50] He said so your prediction was right just got the titles wrong

[21:54] I I like you thought that Star Wars and Guardians of the galaxy was going to be the take over the pinball universe Star Wars

[22:02] Well, we have talked about it how the game came up short and Guardians of the galaxy is too much like Metallica

[22:07] But here it is Stern has an absolute hit could you imagine if they did show iron maiden at Texas pinball festival

[22:14] Nobody would be talking about Alice Cooper speaking of Alice Cooper. Oh my god the callouts are flat

[22:21] The good thing is they can bring him back and change that I wonder if that was a

[22:26] Product of working with somebody you see as a legend and you're afraid to critique the way they're calling out the script

[22:33] Love the show

[22:34] PS stop using jaws as your example for stern to charge us

[22:38] $20,000 and make it super early because I can't afford a $20,000 joss pinball machine

[22:44] Not hating on those that can't I just don't get I don't got it like that

[22:48] PPS peace out mother fuckers. You got me laughing at that one bro

[22:53] Man, maybe I should curse more on the show. It seems like you guys like it. Well Joe. Thank you

[22:58] Look I don't think anyone saw iron maiden coming. I don't think anyone thought that iron maiden would be the juggernaut title that it is

[23:05] I thought we all predicted Star Wars would be the one that would sell out right all the Star Wars

[23:10] Ellie's would be in demand and Guardians of the galaxy like yeah

[23:15] Right no no iron maiden is the one iron maiden is the game that I think people have been waiting a long time

[23:23] To get from stern. I'm seeing people say and maybe this is too early to say this

[23:26] But people are writing this not this is not me saying it that this is the best layout in 20 years

[23:32] That's a that's a bold statement. This is the best layout since the 90s

[23:37] So I don't know man people wouldn't say that if there wasn't some truth to it

[23:41] But I also think there's a little bit like

[23:43] People are going a little too crazy, right? I mean there's not really many toys or anything in iron maiden

[23:50] And so does it just come down to you flow and code for people and I think it comes down to this

[23:55] I think if you were to break down

[23:57] What makes a pinball machine so much fun? It is a combination of the flow

[24:02] It is a combination of the music at the callouts. I heard the callouts on maiden are amazing. I haven't heard them yet

[24:07] But I think what it comes down to is a pinball machine just needs to be god damn fun

[24:13] And it needs to be easy to jump in and you need to get lost in the experience quickly

[24:18] And I think the games that do that and do that best are the ones that provide you with one thing and that thing is this

[24:26] They provide you with rewarding shots, right? It just it feels rewarding

[24:32] To hit the shots in the game and that is why when you make a game clunky or two the shots are too tight and they're bricking back

[24:42] To me games that are brick fest are the worst

[24:45] Games in my opinion never design a game with shots that are just frustratingly bricking back in your face

[24:52] And that is why I was like when I played Houdini next to dialed in

[24:57] I'm like this is why one guy is the greatest designer of all time

[25:01] And this is why the other you know the other game is just like it's just doesn't

[25:05] It just doesn't feel rewarding to hit those shots. It's just I just feel like I got lucky

[25:10] And I think iron maiden is making people feel like the shots are ultra rewarding

[25:14] All right, so I think that's that's the case and yeah

[25:16] Like I think everyone's lucky that maiden didn't get unveiled at Texas pinball festival because I think it would have definitely put a damper

[25:24] On everyone else's ability to create hype from the show. So Joe. Thank you for writing in

[25:30] All right, I got an email from

[25:33] A matte retray retray

[25:36] Hi Chris. I haven't written in a while. I'm still really enjoying listening to your podcast with over

[25:42] 228 episodes. I guess I've spent 9.5 days of my life

[25:48] Listening to you time wise. I think that's equivalent to three or four head-to-head episodes

[25:56] Love listening to them too. I thought I'd bring up the subject of your idea of a premium pinball

[26:02] I've tried to work out the feasibility of this. I have a few samples below

[26:07] I believe if a boutique company attempted this it could work

[26:11] But from a profit standpoint. I don't think it would be feasible for a major company like Stern to do this

[26:16] Below is my conclusions

[26:18] When Twilight Zone as an example was released the product

[26:22] I'm produce they produce 15,000

[26:25] 235 units from what I can tell the sale price was 2500 bucks

[26:31] If we use that figure of 60 percent of the sale price is what it costs to be made

[26:36] And develop the machines I worked out the total sales of Twilight Zone

[26:42] were

[26:42] 3,087,500 dollars was the cost to build equals

[26:49] 1 million eight like 1.8 million bit roughly in profit

[26:54] So that's 1.235 not bad for 1995 figures

[26:59] In today's market a 25,000-hour game times 100 machines equals 2.5 million

[27:06] So the build cost is 60 percent means the profit is 1 million

[27:11] Average Stern at the moment is 7,500 times 2,000 machines which is 15 million the build cost is 60 percent

[27:20] And that's 9 million dollars

[27:23] Profit okay, no so 9 million dollars to make so profit will be 6 million

[27:27] As you can see I think the amount of work required would make sense for Stern

[27:31] The idea does sound good keep up the good work and

[27:35] And keeping us up to date with the latest news so Matt thank you

[27:38] I'm sorry because numbers are really hard. It's hard to talk about numbers

[27:42] It's easier to see what you're saying here, but here's the thing

[27:45] Here's the thing of course it's easy for Stern to just you know make a limited high run game because Stern is also making

[27:52] You know the pros and Stern can corner every aspect of the market if they want to because they have manufacturing down and they can make the game the cheapest so

[28:02] I would I do think though that

[28:04] Here's the thing I'd think that games

[28:09] You're saying that a game is like 60 percent of the game goes into the development cost

[28:14] So you're saying 40 percent of the game is profit. I think your way off there

[28:18] Matt I don't think these companies are making 40 percent on top of what the manufacturing cost is of the game

[28:25] In fact, I think these companies are hanging on by razor thin margins

[28:29] I mean, I think spooky is probably making like 500 to a thousand dollars a game not they're not making 40 percent on each game

[28:37] Profit I think that numbers way off

[28:40] My point was this though for a new for a new to pinball manufacturer to survive

[28:46] I do think the high end low-run games are the way to go

[28:51] And I also don't think these companies have to make these promises of making you know a thousand games like that's a lot of games to make

[28:59] You know American pinball they've used it as an example

[29:03] They have to make like they have to make a lot of games to stay to make profit

[29:07] And I'm just not sure the the space is there for them to sell a thousand who deenies while at the same time Jersey

[29:13] Jack is trying to sell you you know thousands of pirates the Caribbean while at the same time

[29:18] Chicago gaming companies trying to sell you thousands of like their remakes while stirring selling you thousands of four different games a year

[29:25] I just don't know how you compete with that many options

[29:28] But we'll see what happens man. I'm still waiting for the day when someone comes out with a high end game

[29:34] Very low numbers and it's like a bespoke

[29:37] Premium pinball experience that is you know that is not trying to compete on a volume level all right

[29:45] All right

[29:46] Let's see I got an email from Michael Shaulis the subject was pirates at dinner time said dear canada

[29:54] It is not unusual for me to bring up pinball during our family dinner usually as the way to annoy my 18 year old daughter

[30:00] To put this in perspective. I once told my daughter that when I died

[30:03] She would inherit all my pinball machines her response was and those will be the first things I sell

[30:10] With that let me share a snippet of a conversation that went on at dinner

[30:14] Me there was a big announcement in pinball that is blowing up and totally upsetting the entire pinball community

[30:20] They are making changes to the pirates of the Caribbean pinball machine that I am buying

[30:25] They are taking out the three spinning concentric rings in the middle of the play field and replacing them with one disc that will spin

[30:31] My daughter so they were replacing one spinning thing with another and this has blown up pinball

[30:38] Me you'd be surprised daughter pauses and then says that's all kinds of stupid

[30:45] Perhaps the entire pinball world

[30:47] Sorry, perhaps the entire pinball hobby is a world inner glass as always my best to bubba mic

[30:52] Well, Mike I agree that the second you tell anyone outside of this hobby the things we talk about complain about

[30:59] Their eyes just roll over in their heads. They just don't care

[31:03] I it who cares right people don't even care about like pinball in general let alone that a spinning disc

[31:10] That was once three is now one nobody cares all right

[31:14] I got an email from john

[31:16] Esel john. Thank you for listening to the show. He says dear canada

[31:20] Can I say I'm always in agreement with you, but I'm writing you because yours is the only podcast that actually reads interesting male

[31:27] Okay, so somebody crunched data from pinball map and found that the number one location machine in the us was ghost busters pro

[31:35] Well congrats to stern on this

[31:37] This means your average casual dork who might want to get into pinball is going to start with one of the least fun

[31:44] Shittiest and cheapest piece of shit games ever made you often bitch about dumb themes

[31:49] Yeah, I agree, but I don't hear much discussion of popular themes having a drawback

[31:54] Yeah, the art looks okay as far as what passes for pinball art these days

[31:58] But if I'm a kid and I put three dollars in ghost busters on location

[32:02] I don't think I'm ever playing

[32:04] Ethan pinball again

[32:06] It's good thing jontrado is in jail because I would love to drive to a convention just to unleash my pit bulls on him and have them

[32:15] Gobble his face off while he screamed okay who brought the dog

[32:19] Over and over again this game has made me want the entire pinball industry to collapse and I fucking love pinball

[32:27] All his like all his like his dronik venting aside. Do you see any drawbacks to the visibility of stern vis-a-vis companies that make good shit and are old good shit

[32:37] All right, well john. Thank you for the spirited email first. All john charto is not in jail yet

[32:42] I think he's still waiting his court date

[32:45] Do I think pinball is three is pinball three dollars anywhere on location?

[32:49] I just think I think you'd be disappointed if you put three dollars into any arcade game anywhere

[32:55] Look, I think ghost busters is a beautiful game. I think the game looks incredible

[33:00] I think it is one is turned greatest sort of worlds under glass. Marty. I said it

[33:05] I just think the game's crap fest. It's a turd everyone agrees

[33:09] So look there's nothing we can do you know like I can't make a game good

[33:14] I can't make stern make every great theme into a great pinball machine

[33:18] But ghost busters being number one on location

[33:20] It just doesn't surprise me if you are newbie and you walk up to that game and you've got ghost busters and you see slimer

[33:27] It looks like such a fun game to get into and then you plunge the ball and it drains down the middle

[33:33] Immediately it hops over the out lanes and you walk away dejected in like 15 seconds. So yeah worst game

[33:39] I think it's I think ghost busters is the the most disappointing game

[33:43] Next to star wars. I still think star wars is far more disappointing because at least ghost busters has like

[33:48] Awesome like fun toys and I think it brings the world to life better than star wars does I just I

[33:54] That's that's my two cents, but thank you for writing in I don't encourage violence on your pit bulls on any pinball designers

[34:01] But you know what

[34:02] Such as life he also wrote another email

[34:04] Can one of those companies that makes custom shit like a warning sign

[34:08] Warning this pinball machine is opposite of amusement. Okay, John

[34:12] No, no one's gonna make a sign that this game in this arcade sucks

[34:15] But thank you again, please do write in though frequently because I do like the spirit. All right. I got an email from

[34:22] James about alien we were to I'm gonna read this on the next show. I'm getting too many emails

[34:27] We're gonna do we're gonna run this interview now because I don't like my podcast going too long

[34:31] Oh, I feel like it been nonstop. It's like a half hour. This like a show in itself. I'm getting to head to head pinball level here

[34:39] Ha

[34:50] All right, let's hear the interview ladies and gentlemen Scott and canada talking about pinball marketing enjoy

[34:56] All right, ladies and gentlemen. I want to welcome to canada's pinball podcast a listener of the show

[35:01] Who actually hit me up to talk about pinball marketing, which I know

[35:06] We talk a lot about on this show and his name is Scott Dregard. The sky that I get your last name correct

[35:12] Yeah, that's perfect. Canada. Thanks. Scott welcome to the show and and thank you again for for reaching out because I think pinball marketing

[35:19] Is something that we are seeing right now today so many companies

[35:25] Either succeed or struggle at marketing their pinball products now. What what makes you

[35:31] Interested in marketing is this something you do for a living Scott

[35:34] Yeah, I work product marketing on the VP for suffer product marketing at a company that does

[35:41] Global customer communication software. So I live and breathe marketing

[35:44] Okay, and pinball is this is a hobby. It is something that you've been into for a long time

[35:50] Yeah, I'll serve as a bad example for you from your advice actually

[35:55] I purchased my first machine in 1998 when I was still at my parents house that bought a guns and roses

[36:01] Well, I love guns and roses. So that's that's okay. Yeah, I still have it

[36:05] So I've been lugging that thing around for four states since you know for 20 years now

[36:09] So you have a home use only

[36:11] guns and roses

[36:13] Pinball machine

[36:14] It's not a home use only

[36:16] It had a few years out in the field, but it is an early production so it has some mistakes on the play field

[36:21] doesn't have the G&R logo by the

[36:24] By the coma of you okay

[36:26] Okay

[36:27] Well, we'll have to geek out about guns and roses at a later date

[36:31] So you're into pinball you work in marketing as a professional and

[36:37] What are your thoughts Scott just on a macro level as you look at pinball and how these pinball companies market their products

[36:46] Do you ever just find yourself being like what are they doing or or the other side of the coin because I hear people say

[36:52] Well, you don't really need marketing in pinball because people just buy this stuff regardless

[36:57] So

[36:59] Actually both sides are true

[37:01] It both sides can work, but you have to make it a deliberate choice

[37:05] I think that's what we're not seeing. I think we're seeing a lot of things that just happen

[37:10] I see a lot of

[37:11] Kind of unrehearsed or unprepared reveals it looked like they could have just been planned a little bit better

[37:19] And it wouldn't have taken much more time or effort right and and Scott when you have you been to like some of the pinball shows when these companies

[37:26] Actually do reveal their games to the world for the first time

[37:30] Yeah, I go to a Chicago pinball expo every year

[37:32] I'm glad that it's back on it kind of normal for 2018

[37:36] Right

[37:37] And so Scott at these shows and I've sort of harped on this a lot where

[37:42] You've worked on this product for years and you're about to show the world your product and it's like these guys walk in

[37:50] with sort of chicken scratch powerpoint presentations

[37:53] And they don't even create like an atmosphere in the room

[37:57] It's very much just like here's our slideshow of making the game and then here it is and and it's just sort of like

[38:05] You know, it's like there's no real effort to create any buzz

[38:12] I see some of that uh my favorite reveal that I ever saw was Pirates of the Caribbean

[38:18] I like that one because it was a solid

[38:20] It was a solid presentation Aaron got up and explained what it looked like and they had the box there

[38:26] Now you and I might might differ

[38:28] From your earned media perspective and my product perspective on whether that was a good idea or not

[38:34] Um, but I thought that was nice because they got to stream it. It was real

[38:38] And it wasn't just a picture. Right. I thought that one was pretty amazing

[38:41] So let's let's talk about pirates because that this is the hot game right now that everyone is talking about and when I say hot

[38:47] I mean hot topic. I don't necessarily mean

[38:50] Things are heating up over there in the right way. So let's let's break it down

[38:54] That um from a few from a few different angles scots so they revealed this game in October of

[39:02] 2017 right seems like a really long time ago

[39:06] What do you think of that decision to show that game so early on

[39:12] Uh, and we're still not shipping products and it's

[39:16] You know April of 2018

[39:20] One thing I definitely respect about that plan is they got some demo units out in the field that they learned from it

[39:28] Right, so I am seeing and I do respect that they put a they put a product out there to get beat on

[39:33] I know you had Dave Faulgren on the show um, I sometimes played the same level 257

[39:38] Dave helped me get a pile of 13 in my basement a couple weeks back

[39:42] Um, but we go and they had a pirate so that Caribbean out for a while and it was nice for us to beat on it that place

[39:48] also had it dialed in

[39:50] For a number of months before it was generally available and I'm glad that companies like Jersey jack up putting those out in the field to get beat on so they can look at the reports

[39:59] right so there's

[40:01] The other side of the coin is the stern approach where you they don't show you anything until the games about to go on the line and for people who get a stern early on

[40:11] There's none of that you know in the field testing that goes on so that is a good thing

[40:16] But but let's talk about duration right because I feel like when they revealed dialed in

[40:21] They then put it out in different bars and in locations out there in the world and they uncovered some things like certain sections need to be my lord a cliffy here a cliffy there

[40:33] But look what's happened to pirates like let's talk about that so they put it out in the field

[40:38] And now it looks like some of the major mechanisms in the game

[40:43] Have to be altered in a way that people are perceiving as for the worse now

[40:49] What you have you been following?

[40:51] Scott what's been going on with with pirates of the Caribbean?

[40:54] Oh, yeah, I have been following that when I see pizza call people calling the pizza spinner

[40:59] um

[41:00] Now my wife is not super supportive of the pinball hobby

[41:04] Um, she'll go out sometimes with me and we'll go some places

[41:07] But she really like playing pirates because of the chaos around the around the spinner

[41:12] Right because I think she felt that was like an equalizer her other favorite is Batman 66 by the way

[41:17] Oh, right. It's good to test. Yeah

[41:20] But watching that pirates ball I'm I'm not a great player. I do the tournament every once in a while over at

[41:27] level 50 level 257

[41:29] But there's top 100 players there so I never do very well

[41:34] But they don't like that machine

[41:37] Right that one always it's too chaotic for a lot of the tournament players

[41:41] I'm okay because I'm not used to long ball times. I don't feel bad about it

[41:45] I just like watching it goes where is it gonna go because with three spinning discs

[41:48] That's five times the ball changes direction in less than eight inches. I think that's exciting

[41:53] Yeah, there's

[41:56] The randomness is fun for

[41:59] Everyone is not a tournament player because we know that these guys like to predict and and know where the ball is gonna land and and and and and and they

[42:07] They they hate the chaos every time I talk to tournament players about stuff like that. They don't like it

[42:13] But for everyone else out there and I think the jersey jack buyer is probably more of your collector and enthusiast and not so much of like your tournament player

[42:22] Because I never really see tournament players

[42:24] Saying they really want to you know have have a jersey jack game being the tournament

[42:28] um

[42:29] So now that that's gone scott and he's replaced it and Eric had to replace it with a single spinning disc

[42:36] Which we saw more of that today and that's that's it like that's the the final version of the game

[42:42] Do you think that decision from a marketing standpoint is gonna make it really hard for these guys to get the hype back that they had when they revealed this game at at

[42:51] Expo to all that fanfare

[42:54] Sorry, can you know this one's gonna this one hurts me

[42:56] Um because I've done this before where I've had a software feature that we've talked about that for a reason of cost or licensing had to be pulled from a release

[43:05] There was in it was a little bit different than what we originally thought

[43:10] Usually very minor and those I take very personally because I'm I'm from the product side

[43:14] So you're from the earned media side where something comes out the back end

[43:18] On the product side everybody strives to deliver the right thing on time

[43:22] um

[43:23] On that one I thought that was one of the major features of the game. I thought that was amazing

[43:27] I am a jersey jack buyer. I have a home use only

[43:31] Wizard of Oz 75th anniversary edition and I love it. So I'm a wide body guy right

[43:38] Um, but I love that they have a lot of extra technology. I'd like games with more than two flippers

[43:45] Right

[43:46] Well, so we'll hate that though right but Scott like but let's get back to the question because like yeah, but do you think

[43:53] Like

[43:54] Obviously it's gonna hurt. I mean, do you think it's how bad do you think it's gonna hurt him because obviously when when we read on Pinside right and

[44:00] I know there's a little bit of like the skies falling mentality sweeping across the the pinball forms right now over this news

[44:07] How bad do you think it's gonna hurt him because I don't think it's even a question of like nobody wants to ever remove a feature people really like this right

[44:15] The chest is no big deal the disc is probably a big deal

[44:19] I was not on the list for a pirates. I think this will mesh with one of the other topics

[44:24] I hope we get to about now and refundable deposits. We're gonna talk about that. Don't worry

[44:29] But but on the on the disc I think that was a big mess. I wasn't I wasn't ready to buy pirates

[44:35] I'm also I'm also a sucker. I'm on the I'm on the Lebowski list

[44:39] Um, did you pay for your Lebowski? I got my refund back while I go lucky man

[44:46] I'm not proud about the way I did it, but you know, oh yeah, I owed you up on apology

[44:50] But I and I gave it to him last year at Expo

[44:52] But I did get my deposit back. So where were you anyway? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you?

[44:56] Scott you can't introduce a story like this. We're gonna go on a little bit of a tangent here

[45:00] So what did you have to do to get your refund that

[45:04] You're not proud of

[45:06] Oh, I

[45:07] I asked for it back

[45:09] well before I believe that went into production and of my 8500 that I paid um

[45:15] I got offered back that we'll just give you eight because we're already in production

[45:19] And then a couple weeks later. I was still on the email list. I received a marketing communication says hey, here's some testing

[45:26] I said what I email back. I say wait a second um, I

[45:31] Believe that it was in production, but then we're clearly seeing testing videos

[45:35] That doesn't sound like production for me. Give me my 500 bucks back

[45:39] right

[45:40] And that I thought that was a fair position. We had some disagreements on that over a long period of time. I wound up

[45:47] Oh, so they basically said to you you've you've got to lose 500 almost like I'm looking like that's the non-refundable portion

[45:54] If we're in production you lose that because right and then they really weren't in production. Okay. I got it

[46:00] So you and I didn't see an introduction. That was three years ago

[46:04] So every when you know there I guess you know the word production and if you put one word in front of that

[46:11] Ramping or maybe ramping up to production always seems to be where all these companies are in a

[46:16] Sort of like a frozen state in in how they communicate where things are at

[46:20] So you and did you end up getting all of your 8500 back?

[46:24] Yeah, I did I did

[46:26] But now now I'm on the list. I'm gonna pay 10 for the machine if they can get one to if they can get a box to my house

[46:30] I'll pay to the 10 it's a great game and I think you you will probably get your game if they figured out far

[46:38] In front of the early achievers who are still waiting because they're gonna take you money now

[46:44] I was not nice. I was not nice a bike head in that back and I did apologize to yop over there at the at the expo

[46:50] And we had a good game and we talked about it and I think we're okay

[46:54] And I believe they're gonna I believe they're gonna get the games out. Well, let me ask you a question scoffic is

[46:59] When you went in on big Lebowski, right

[47:03] The agreement between you bearing yop was that

[47:06] Deposits were refunded or were not refundable were refundable

[47:11] In completion up till the time of production and then you would lose 500 or no there is no there is no terms like that

[47:17] It was just a till production

[47:19] so I

[47:21] I'm almost like my point is I feel so bad for people like you who have to feel bad about fighting to get

[47:28] Your money back because they failed to deliver

[47:31] What they promise within the time frame, but I'm glad you're out all I'm saying is be very careful with that $10,000

[47:38] Hopefully you have it with coin taker and it's with a distributor. I hope you know

[47:42] I hope you're not in on did you give it to them or coin taker?

[47:46] No, I'm just on the listed coin taker

[47:48] I stocked them all the time I

[47:50] Want to I want to put something on there because I want to I want to make it real right?

[47:55] Okay, I want these guys to win

[47:57] I think everyone's learned that lesson that the only place in which you should have your money

[48:01] Tied up is with a distributor and just a quick side note for for the listeners of the show

[48:06] I want to actually give a real great shout out to

[48:10] Joe Newhart at pinball star

[48:12] I had a $1,000 deposit down for pirates of the Caribbean collectors edition

[48:18] I hit him up today and I said I just would like a refund

[48:21] I'm just not as interested in the game

[48:24] Anymore, I'm going to put that money towards the iron maiden elite that I'm getting or

[48:28] Getting then selling we'll see what I do with it

[48:31] And Joe refunded my money within an hour not even it was like within 20 minutes of sending him a text

[48:36] So I just want to give him a shout out. That's how it should be

[48:40] Maybe we can talk a little bit about refundability since we're on the topic now

[48:44] And then we can go back to some other things Scott so

[48:46] We we are seeing spooky pinball

[48:49] Do a marketing strategy around

[48:51] Your money is non-refundable now. What do you feel about that because nobody else really has an initial

[48:59] deposit that is not refundable at any point

[49:05] I think it's a great idea

[49:08] For who I think for them or for the for the buyer I think it's a great idea for everybody

[49:12] Okay, make sure the buyer it make sure the buyer is even

[49:15] interested in the machine which helps the

[49:18] manufacturer accurately forecast production needs

[49:22] And it helps them if they do order some parts to

[49:26] You know at least at least understand that the buyers do have an intent and not a refundable where somebody can wait until the last second pull out

[49:34] You know, especially once production begins

[49:37] I don't think it's fair and I think a lot of people flip flip the pinball machines which

[49:42] That's cool

[49:43] If you can do it, but it's kind of like ticket scalpers ticket scalping is kind of gone away because it got corporate

[49:50] right well and and I think the point you're making and the way you're looking at it

[49:56] It's kind of fair in the sense that because I go back and forth on this where

[50:00] I it's great for charling company because they're not going to get screwed by people bailing in the 11th hour after they've ordered parts for that person's specific game

[50:10] The other part that it's going against and this is new for pinball right it is really attacking

[50:17] The fear of missing out I need to like just buy it now without even knowing I want it without ever playing it

[50:24] It's really forcing

[50:27] To call those people's bluffs that you you can't really do that with our product

[50:33] You better know you want it and when you're in you're in and if you want to get out

[50:38] It's not going to be as simple and so I could see how that will actually

[50:43] Try to create new behaviors from pinball buyers that they need to be patient and make sure they want it

[50:48] Yeah, not a full payment upfront like a decent hefty bigger than 250

[50:52] Somewhere in the thousand dollar range seems like a very fair deposit

[50:57] I really like the Dutch pinball model of you got an early achiever edition and it was

[51:03] You got something special it looks like some of the some of the rumors and the threads say that

[51:08] everybody

[51:09] Can get a rug now, but that was initially an early achiever you got a badge and a rug

[51:14] um

[51:15] You know what you know what most people got scott nothing

[51:19] They didn't get a rug they didn't get a game they got nothing

[51:23] I do think the early achiever model was great and look it seems like many many years ago scott where

[51:29] Sort of

[51:30] Spicing up the offer was needed because these companies

[51:36] Required pre-order dollars to actually get off the ground and I think we've seen you know that

[51:43] Frequently fail now as as the only financing a company has to make pinball machines

[51:48] So you think the non-refundables good you think other companies out there scott are gonna watch what spooky's doing and adopt that

[51:56] Sort of model

[51:58] Yeah, I love that model. I would like to see um, I know a lot of iron maiden fans out there

[52:03] Um that one of my friends is gonna

[52:06] Grab one of those machines

[52:08] Uh, I think he's getting the premium because all the alise are unobtainium except for you, you know

[52:12] Hey, it's a sale if you want to let's deal 12k right now

[52:16] by it now

[52:18] If you take that like I think all the people are doing some individually brilliant things

[52:23] But nobody's put everything together yet

[52:26] Jersey jacks dialed in limited editions that said or the collectors that said you could get these until

[52:31] Was it December 31st?

[52:34] Right, so they they set their alise

[52:37] Uh, they said they're they're more limited premiums

[52:41] On a certain timer

[52:42] Whereas stern did another good thing by setting the limited editions at 500 to 50 for Europe 250 for

[52:50] America's

[52:52] But I really like the

[52:53] Jersey jack model probably would have made stern a little bit more money

[52:56] But I don't need to tell Gary stern how to make money you know

[52:59] He's been doing it for longer than I've been alive the problem I have with jacks

[53:05] Uh approach is this it it wasn't real you know what I'm saying if like if you're gonna market something

[53:11] We're only gonna make as many dialed in collectors edition orders um

[53:17] That come in you know by new year's eve okay

[53:21] And that's all we're gonna make and you and you're gonna pay 12,500 and you might have a really rare game

[53:27] And then they're like we're making 150 so you're telling me that exactly

[53:32] 150

[53:33] Orders can you know what I'm saying like the number needed to be like not at not so

[53:39] Clearly like a made up number and

[53:42] And but here's when you look at the marketing between stern and Jersey jack it's interesting because

[53:47] Stern's model is you know roughly four to 800 LEDs of a title depending on popularity of the title right then

[53:56] unlimited premiums

[53:58] And then pro now Jersey jack is kind of trying to follow that model

[54:03] But I think the issue is he's charging way too much for the collector's edition

[54:09] It doesn't have enough to warrant that much more over the limited because the limited is already

[54:16] The crem de la crem of what you need in in jack's games

[54:20] So I think he's leaving money on the table and I also think he struggles because of the themes he has

[54:25] Let's talk about themes Scott because I think that's interesting

[54:28] Why do you think iron made in as a theme

[54:32] Sold out site unseen 500 of them like as a marketing move clearly they did something amazingly well

[54:39] I

[54:41] And maiden has an amazing visual brand that transcends music

[54:45] You might not be to kiss levels, but if you're outside of the United States

[54:49] It's similar in scope that that is a that is a brand that has a visual identity

[54:53] That goes far beyond just the bands music they got a ton of classic albums

[54:58] um, I can definitely see that one selling out instantly. I bet they could have sold 1500 limited if they did the

[55:06] Up until a certain day model and people could have taken a look at it. Right now

[55:10] Do you think so the thing is it's that with iron maiden it didn't people knew that was the next theme right it wasn't sold out

[55:18] Until people saw Keith L. Wins design as well with it

[55:23] And I think that's the difference between maiden and ghost busters and Batman those two titles

[55:29] They were all spoken for before people saw anything

[55:33] Iron maiden took about three hours after it was actually revealed because I think people realized

[55:38] Wow, it's gonna have all this and the layouts amazing and the theme is something

[55:43] Um, that is also like very popular now

[55:47] Jersey jack let's go back to them

[55:49] Do you think

[55:50] Jack's big issue like why can't jack get a game from a marketing standpoint

[55:56] That creates a frenzy where it like the limited expensive version sell out immediately

[56:01] Do you think he's just not landing on the right themes for his machines?

[56:07] I think there might be a time a time stretch in there because I've been on the the stern factory tour

[56:13] And you can see what what a place that knocks out 50 games a day does

[56:17] Um, and I've seen some of the pictures of the other places jack's got a great factory, but it's not a 50 machines a day factory

[56:24] So they have to wait and you want to send out full crates and it takes you know

[56:29] It takes stern four hours to fill up a shipping crate with pinball machines, right?

[56:32] But but but if we look at it to the lens god of just like theme alone right like why

[56:38] Jack has never had a game that you ever hear the words it's sold out

[56:43] like yeah ever and

[56:45] Stern has hit her miss on on themes that sell out site unseen

[56:52] But if you look at the themes wizard of Oz

[56:55] Hobbit

[56:56] Pirates of the Caribbean and dialed in right

[57:00] Any of those do you think any of those have the like oh my god?

[57:04] I I just need to own this machine like I don't even need to see it like take my money now

[57:11] From a theme level no, but I tell you what the machine that my honestly gets the most play is the wizard of Oz

[57:17] Yeah, it's a great and then I think that is still jack's best selling game right to date

[57:21] I mean, I don't know the numbers, but it seems like they're still actually making wizard of Oz aren't they?

[57:26] Oh, yeah, and that's just because he's crams like he crammed amazing technology in there

[57:32] I think he raised the bar for the industry so I'm super glad that he has machines coming out

[57:36] I think he unfairly gets beat on dialed in for the comic book people say oh you have to

[57:41] You have to read a comic book to understand what the theme is. No, it's not you hit the electric guy and start a mode

[57:47] But the comic book was he was doing something extra and I thought

[57:50] I thought a lot of the people on pin sight a lot of the discussion

[57:53] It's kind of penalized him for doing something extra and kind of building up something around it and

[57:58] I thought that was a little bit disappointing to see people pile on that where I thought it was a cool movie

[58:03] He's like hey, yeah, the comic book is an advertising device. I know people who pitch film scripts who do the same thing

[58:08] They make the a graphic novel version instead of a script treatment because it builds up their pitch a little more

[58:14] I thought it was cool, right?

[58:17] And yeah, I mean I love Jersey Jack pinball and I think he does bring such a higher level of

[58:26] Pinball manufacturing to the table

[58:29] But I do think like marketing is his weakest point and I and what I mean by that Scott is

[58:36] It I think sometimes when we talk about marketing. I think people mistake

[58:41] Marketing being the moment by which you bring a game to market right and there is that element of it

[58:46] But that is the very tail end of

[58:49] Of marketing the first thing you do is market research like what themes

[58:55] Will sell and create that frenzy with pinball enthusiasts. So that's market research

[59:01] And I don't know what market research makes you land on

[59:06] the hobbit

[59:07] Makes you land on wizard of Oz makes you land on you know, especially makes you land on pirates the Caribbean

[59:13] Which is a movie franchise that has been pretty irrelevant even within mainstream culture

[59:19] For the past few years now. Maybe he had to get that just to get Disney on board for some future titles

[59:24] But I think the problems start there and then what you then have to do

[59:30] Is you have to work twice as hard if you're trying to market

[59:34] Pirates of the Caribbean in 2018

[59:37] Versus marketing iron maiden

[59:40] Which is an evergreen band that's got you know 100 million fans around the world

[59:46] And it's kind of timeless as a theme because they're just a classic act same thing with Batman 66 right how

[59:54] Not not really the most present day relevant show, but Batman as a property and that

[01:00:00] And the fan base of pinball grew up with the show

[01:00:04] No brainer as to why people are like take my money now in a $15,000 stern

[01:00:09] Which probably caused jack half as much money to make as his machines

[01:00:14] so

[01:00:16] Do you think toys so do you think pirates is gonna be where do you think it falls like in his

[01:00:22] In his portfolio do you think this is gonna outsell dialed in or was or hobbit?

[01:00:27] I

[01:00:28] Think dialed in is gonna sell pretty well

[01:00:31] Hobbit I probably I don't see that one has his top selling title wizard of Oz because I had a several year head start

[01:00:39] And I think that's an amazing theme

[01:00:41] It's a surprising one, but I think I remember listening to some podcasts where

[01:00:46] Discussed that the license really came from a slot machine license

[01:00:50] There was also had language that allowed it to be used for other things

[01:00:54] Which a pinball machine fell into the categories that one kind of

[01:00:58] Looks like fell into

[01:01:00] fell into an opportunity to make wizard of Oz which

[01:01:03] Happens to be a good thing pinball theme

[01:01:06] But I think where

[01:01:08] You know if I don't want to get in to anybody's head because I don't know anybody at Jersey jack

[01:01:12] I'm not personal personal friends with anybody

[01:01:15] I met a met him a few times

[01:01:17] Did a podcast with him one time for a work related thing

[01:01:21] But if you look at hobbit and you look at pirates of the Caribbean

[01:01:24] Those are derivative both of those are derivative of previously done themes

[01:01:28] You have Lord of the Rings which is an amazing game and you have pirates of the Caribbean which is a great

[01:01:33] Stern game. I put my high score in one two weeks ago and

[01:01:37] Deleven Wisconsin

[01:01:41] But in 2015 to 2018 those were themes that were already used right and they came out

[01:01:48] They came out at the height of the popularity. I mean I kind of feel bad for jack on the hobbit because

[01:01:55] The hobbit is probably one of those where you're like we can't

[01:01:59] This is like

[01:02:01] We can't lose you know the Lord of the Rings is so popular Peter Jackson's gonna be directing it

[01:02:06] It's kind of it's the same way that

[01:02:08] Pinball 2000 was banking on

[01:02:11] Phantom menace and Star Wars coming back right? I mean

[01:02:15] What could go wrong? Everyone loves this franchise

[01:02:18] And then the movies themselves are really underwhelming which leads people to not

[01:02:24] Want to really own

[01:02:26] Something based on on a mediocre film

[01:02:29] Yeah, you can't beat up hobbit for you know at the time they made the business decision

[01:02:35] All bets would have said that that was a that all parties would have said there was a safe bet based on the information available at the time

[01:02:41] Yeah, nobody thought a two hour movie about hobbits and dwarves eating breakfast was gonna work right

[01:02:46] Yeah, well, let's talk about like

[01:02:48] Hype and marketing like hyping these machines because I know with hobbit

[01:02:52] We heard a lot about it's gonna have the most interactive dragon ever in a pinball machine. I think people's

[01:02:59] Managing people's expectations Scott in this hobby

[01:03:04] It's it's kind of important right that you don't want to

[01:03:07] Overpromise and under deliver and I think that's what's happening with the concentric ring issue with pirates

[01:03:14] Um, but how do you think these companies, you know, how long would you think the hype window lasts in in the pinball hobby?

[01:03:22] That's very closely related to your view on non-refundable deposits, I guess

[01:03:27] Well, I mean, it's like I think you know what you're marketing like you want to you want to reveal something in a time period in which the most

[01:03:33] amount of people are gonna want to buy it

[01:03:35] Yeah without backing out so you have basically

[01:03:38] You in pinball world. I think you have six months max before

[01:03:43] Between when you announce something in between it better you announced it and it better be in people's

[01:03:48] Unboxing feeds on you to right to be better have put something together on it

[01:03:53] You know

[01:03:54] six months, which is

[01:03:56] I would even argue that I would say like

[01:03:59] That's even like it's that's long right and here's the thing right is I can't be three to six that that makes sense

[01:04:05] Yeah, and I can have a little bit of time Batman was a little bit long because I remember seeing that just drooling over it at

[01:04:11] Chicago pinball I expo when it was not playable. I was like why did you bring it? I just feel

[01:04:16] I think I want to do it looks awesome

[01:04:19] Yeah, they shipped it to people in December even though it wasn't really working even when they shipped it

[01:04:24] And I think that's what's hard right is if if you're a company in pinball

[01:04:30] You're competing in the marketplace that is dictated by stern right mean stern has probably 90% plus of the market

[01:04:38] And if stern can reveal a machine when hype is hot

[01:04:42] Take orders when hype is hot and get people the machines when hype is hot

[01:04:47] Uh, and hopefully deliver those machines with pretty finished code and and the you know the experience is satisfactory

[01:04:54] It's really hard to compete against a company that can do that

[01:04:58] And then you want to go you know, then someone else thinks they have six months to keep the hype going

[01:05:03] Hey, and I think that you know the more stern shrinks that window

[01:05:08] Uh, the harder and harder it becomes I think for companies like Jersey Jack and other companies out there

[01:05:13] To make people wait a long time

[01:05:16] Yes, they're amazing

[01:05:18] Stern has the brute force they got the videos of the production line. That's amazing

[01:05:23] Sometimes when I think about the industry I think about parallels to the industry I'm in where there's different competitors that do different types of things

[01:05:30] Um, I definitely see the pinball industry stern is a shark and a lot of the other ones are kind of those fish

[01:05:36] The the clean up the shark without the shark. They would all die

[01:05:40] Yeah, no, I mean they're they're all hanging on. I mean stern is definitely carrying the entire industry on its back

[01:05:48] And like a shark I feel like at any moment

[01:05:52] They could decide to get rid of anyone else in the industry and if they really wanted to they could

[01:05:59] I don't I don't think that they they'll do that

[01:06:01] I don't think they're like mean spirited and I do think they feel that it is good to have some competition

[01:06:07] And because it brings more people into pinball

[01:06:09] Um, but I also feel like they they probably feel like they don't really have any competition when it comes to

[01:06:14] Uh, you know, can they they don't I mean I are there many industries Scott where like one player has

[01:06:20] 90% of the market. I mean, none of the clients I represent and I work with all fortune 500 companies

[01:06:26] No one no one's even close to that much

[01:06:28] That you have to get to um

[01:06:30] Military budgets for the world before you find anything similar

[01:06:34] Where like the US spends as much as the nine

[01:06:37] nine

[01:06:38] Next countries in line for military spending that's how strong stern is the pinball industry

[01:06:43] Well, it would it would probably be considered like a monopoly right by the government

[01:06:48] If any company had that much market share in any industry

[01:06:53] um

[01:06:54] Let's do this guy. This would be fun

[01:06:56] So

[01:06:57] let's go down the list of manufacturers and

[01:07:01] Let's each of us give one piece of marketing advice that we would give to that manufacturer in 2018

[01:07:08] Sure, how's that sound

[01:07:10] All right, let's start let's start from the bottom up because we'll get to stern

[01:07:14] let's start with

[01:07:17] Deeproot pinball

[01:07:19] What marketing advice would you give deeproot pinball?

[01:07:22] Change a damn logo

[01:07:25] I know people are saying that right it kind of looks like I mean people have said some really crude things

[01:07:30] Um

[01:07:31] The logo itself right it's just this it looks like

[01:07:34] Of

[01:07:35] People are saying like a butt plug and all sorts of that different things but

[01:07:39] Yeah, it's just confusing about if I had to give them like a legitimate piece of business advice

[01:07:44] I like a lot of the themes. I like a lot of the j pop's work when he's in a

[01:07:49] supervised environment and

[01:07:52] Helped held accountable for a full production run of something. He's done some amazing things

[01:07:57] Um, I just I was at somebody's house and saw them restoring a

[01:08:02] Tazly raviant nice beautiful stuff

[01:08:04] Um, just make sure the stuff comes out quick don't leave us hanging on that otherwise. We'll think it's more of the same

[01:08:10] Right

[01:08:11] Yeah, I mean, I think the natural thing people expect when you give marketing advice to deeproot is to like drop j pop

[01:08:19] He's toxic, but I actually do think that j pop

[01:08:22] Makes games that will sell I my marketing advice would be to just don't show us anything

[01:08:29] Until it's production ready

[01:08:31] I just don't think these guys are are gonna like win people over with like

[01:08:38] You know here's three four games and now it's gonna take forever to get them into production

[01:08:42] I think when we get the five days of deeproot at next year's tpf

[01:08:46] um

[01:08:47] I would I would expect those things to be ready for production

[01:08:52] And if I were to cheat and do a second piece of advice for them it just be like

[01:08:56] Just don't try and take on stern. Yeah, it's just that's just

[01:09:00] To me that seems like lunacy to go from nothing to competing with someone who is 90% of the market share

[01:09:07] But

[01:09:08] That's me. All right. Let's go on to

[01:09:12] American pinball Scott what advice would you give American pinball?

[01:09:16] I

[01:09:17] Wouldn't be I wouldn't be afraid of you dis an october fest

[01:09:21] No, you're you so your marketing advice would be to make october fest

[01:09:25] um

[01:09:27] This is a little bit different a different thing. I think some of the boutiques could

[01:09:32] Make multiple themes for the same machine

[01:09:35] I think that's a way that some of them could get to a scale

[01:09:38] Instead of doing le's that require a certain design every time

[01:09:43] Think of make a pretty cool design and themit and skinder to a couple different ways

[01:09:46] You could have an october fest you could re themit for sports bars tiki bars

[01:09:50] You could do a bunch of different themes off of one design because the big sunk cost is the initial design

[01:09:57] Right, I know you were talking about that with um iron maiden being the archer design

[01:10:02] Yeah, that was so that was a big advantage that brought stern a lot of speed over there

[01:10:06] I think original themes are a good idea

[01:10:09] So I would tell American pinball stick with the original themes

[01:10:12] All right, I'm gonna give a contrarian bit of advice

[01:10:17] And I think original themes for

[01:10:21] boutique startup pinball companies are almost like a one-way ticket to bankruptcy

[01:10:27] And I actually think you should pick a theme that people are familiar with and would

[01:10:33] Go bonkers for and so here's what I would do if I were them. I would pick a theme that

[01:10:38] Everyone knows about would be really awesome to translate to pinball

[01:10:41] It's not a because who do you need not even original right to begin with neither is october fest these are like

[01:10:45] They're original theme is like dialed in right the quantum cities fictional doesn't exist

[01:10:50] I wouldn't make if I were them I would make king Kong pinball

[01:10:55] I would remake I would make and that remake I would make a new version of king Kong based on the

[01:11:01] King Kong franchise everybody loves

[01:11:04] I would do it in the art style like the old king Kong with the old movie poster and

[01:11:09] I kind of like art deco-ish and I would make that game a million times before I would make october fest

[01:11:15] So that's that's my bit of marketing advice and then I would also make sure Joe ball

[01:11:18] So it doesn't make the shots so goddamn tight where people are frustrated versus having fun. I

[01:11:23] could

[01:11:24] I could get on board

[01:11:26] With some licensing if they understand what they're getting into so if they get good legal advice if they invest as much in the legal advice as they do on the white

[01:11:34] Would I just don't want to see some of the boutiques get

[01:11:37] pulled under water by some very tough licensed negotiators on the other side because they're never going to outlaw your

[01:11:43] outlaw your hasbro or some of the big theme owners

[01:11:46] Absolutely, I totally agree and I think you know we're seeing this with pirates the Caribbean right it's

[01:11:52] If you go after a franchise where there's so many restrictions on what you can do with the machine

[01:11:59] You know, I think it makes it really hard to translate that theme into a pinball experience that

[01:12:04] That is that people are going to love I think the bars been raised too high with games that have great theme integration that

[01:12:10] You don't want to like have your hands tied

[01:12:13] If you're a pinball manufacturer

[01:12:15] All right, so what what marketing advice would you give to Dutch pinball?

[01:12:20] I'd like to see a little bit more information because the threads and pin sight are mostly speculation

[01:12:25] If they order some parts, I just I'd like to see it

[01:12:28] I really want to game as fast as as fast as I can and I would

[01:12:31] Participate in anything as a

[01:12:34] sponsor future owner to get that thing made in

[01:12:38] Made it and brought to market as quick as possible

[01:12:41] I don't know exactly what that means, but I think they have a user base or a client base that's willing to

[01:12:46] Yeah, either pay up or do something to participate to make things happen faster

[01:12:51] Yeah, I mean I still consider the big Lebowski to be one of the coolest pinball machines

[01:12:57] Since I've even started following this hobby

[01:12:59] Which is like three maybe four years ago?

[01:13:02] I love that game every time I stand over it. I still it still pains me

[01:13:07] that it's it's it's been sort of

[01:13:10] Crucified in such a bad way because of all these bad business decisions

[01:13:14] my marketing advice to Dutch pinball

[01:13:17] would be to

[01:13:18] fall on your sword

[01:13:20] settle things with a Ra

[01:13:23] And charge $12,000 for the game because you know what when I look at the big Lebowski

[01:13:29] I think it's

[01:13:30] Worth every penny of what a collector's edition

[01:13:34] Jersey Jack game is and every penny of what a stern super le is and I think that game is really special

[01:13:41] Lower play field upper play field or rug that rolls out. I mean it has the toys. It has the flow

[01:13:46] It has the shots. It has so much in it and it's such a high-end premium machine

[01:13:51] And I just think they they got stuck thinking they needed to charge what they promised people instead of making air

[01:13:59] And then work it out and that that would be my advice. It's wishful thinking is a bonus because I love it. It's my favorite 90s game

[01:14:09] What about

[01:14:10] Allowing them to ship some version or what about doing a version without the lower play field for a little less

[01:14:17] Yeah, I mean, it's I think I think what would happen? Scott is exactly what we're seeing with pirates right now

[01:14:23] Once you see how cool it could be I think it'd be really hard

[01:14:29] To accept it in in it in a different form and also because that boring alley is so freaking cool

[01:14:34] It's like it is when you're not even playing the game. It's like one of the I think that is the coolest

[01:14:39] I would say that is the coolest toy or mech that that has come out in the last like 10 years

[01:14:45] I mean maybe ever I mean you could argue that is the coolest lower play field ever. I mean it really is

[01:14:51] Um, it is gorgeous. I mean it's absolutely gorgeous. All right, let's go on to Chicago gaming and pps

[01:14:57] What marketing advice would you give these guys? I?

[01:15:00] Think I would give them something different than you

[01:15:02] I think they did something brilliant from a business perspective now me as a me as a player and watching some of my friends in the market

[01:15:08] I might disagree but from a business marketing perspective

[01:15:11] I think they did the absolute right thing about announcing the next themes they would do

[01:15:15] In a vague order with a long list because they absolutely own the right to do that to the market

[01:15:21] And I understand what it does to the used machines values

[01:15:24] But I think they did a brilliant move by saying any of these could come out at any time because they're owning that piece of the market

[01:15:30] They paid money to do it. Well, they froze

[01:15:33] They froze the value of all those machines and all that money now will go to them regardless of when they make those titles

[01:15:40] I think it was genius

[01:15:41] It's like they bought mineral rights to the top 10 titles of the retro

[01:15:46] So you like that move I like that move too. I might have you know

[01:15:49] I might have just said it kind of sucks for people who own those machines

[01:15:52] But I like it from their vantage point

[01:15:54] What what marketing advice would you give these guys right now?

[01:15:59] I like festival releases. I know one of my friends was super excited to see one at Texas pinball festival

[01:16:06] And he was disappointed that they didn't announce

[01:16:08] But if they have a good reason not to announce that's probably better than having to

[01:16:14] Temporer manage expectations later on in the event that you do have a licensing issue or a Mac that couldn't be reproduced for

[01:16:21] Some legal reason whether it's a license hold a reason or a patent reason

[01:16:24] I'm just a speculating here, but any sort of reason you have to have that

[01:16:30] Pretty set in stone before you show it to the world

[01:16:34] Yeah, no, I think that's good marking advice. I think people really bummed out and there's like this big question mark of when we're gonna

[01:16:40] See the next title. I mean tpf seems like a really long time ago and where there's still nothing on the horizon

[01:16:46] They probably should have got the word out before iron maiden

[01:16:49] But my marketing advice for them because I love what they've done

[01:16:54] With the toppers and the new LCD. I think they've made they've remade these games

[01:16:59] But made the right kind of improvements that make these games pop like nothing else

[01:17:04] My marketing advice for them would be to revisit or re you know recreate new

[01:17:11] Amazing artwork that takes these games to an even higher level of

[01:17:16] Visual awesomeness. They did it with the screen. They've done it with the toppers

[01:17:21] But imagine when you look at you know the art on the cabinet of monster badges very like mediocre

[01:17:28] Imagine if they got like a zombie level a zombie Yeti level artist

[01:17:32] To make like hand drawn like incredible artwork and even like revisit the playfield art

[01:17:38] Because the game would still play the same. It would just look much better

[01:17:40] So that would be my advice they can make like

[01:17:43] Almost like two-plane-o version of the game you love with with new art

[01:17:48] Um

[01:17:49] All right, let's see the next one multi-morphic p3 Scott what what can you do for them as a marketer?

[01:17:58] That's a tough one. I would probably I would probably put

[01:18:03] 10 or 20 machines on location if I was them

[01:18:06] I would invest in getting them out somewhere so people could play them to generate demand because it's

[01:18:11] It's one of those things if it takes too long to explain that's a problem

[01:18:15] But if you can get them out where people can have an opportunity to try them and love them

[01:18:19] That's not a festival. They might have a better chance. Right

[01:18:23] Yeah, yeah, and I think you know the obvious marketing advice is always like get a theme that like people love and shows off the platform

[01:18:31] But what I would say my marketing advice for them because

[01:18:34] Where I think this platform really shines and is the real differentiator

[01:18:40] Is in head-to-head play

[01:18:42] I love it when they connect the machines at different shows. I think there is so much fun there

[01:18:47] That is hard to explain. It's like competitive pinball and it's it's amazing. It's like

[01:18:52] Sort of like what I love about 90s fighting games is I can play against someone at the same time

[01:18:58] I think what Jerry needs to do is figure it out of way

[01:19:01] So who for people who buy p3?

[01:19:04] They can play over the internet against other p3

[01:19:08] Owners, I think he needs to make this the first connected

[01:19:12] pinball experience

[01:19:14] Because then it sort of wakes the game up in a way that no other pinball machine

[01:19:19] You know does

[01:19:20] So the pinburg

[01:19:23] Yeah, send four or five machines to pinburg and

[01:19:26] Get them out there and get some people looking at them that are some of the more serious players

[01:19:30] Because I think people look at it and they don't understand how it's gonna play right right

[01:19:35] All right marketing advice for the most successful pinball company of all time highway pinball

[01:19:43] Um, I went I went on location

[01:19:46] The I went on location to pinbar and calgary a couple weeks back

[01:19:51] I was there for work and one of the reasons I went is because it said they had a tna

[01:19:56] And it said they had an alien and I wanted to play the alien machine

[01:20:00] And I went there and I talked to the owner and alien machine was gone

[01:20:03] Within the first week of it opening because it was mechanical issues

[01:20:08] Right, so lots of issues with the game

[01:20:11] Yeah, you can't you can't release it unless it's not mechanically perfect in a social age where people are doing unboxing

[01:20:18] Any flaw that's scalable is going to percolate to the top of the boards on pinside which is gonna make it hard for you

[01:20:25] So double check it measure twice cut once

[01:20:28] right

[01:20:30] My marketing advice for this company is really simple. It's I would scrap all of the

[01:20:38] All of Andrew highways

[01:20:40] You know modular kit system popping in and out like I don't like the way the cabinet looks

[01:20:46] I don't like the way the back box looks

[01:20:49] I would put their game inside a standard normal cabinet

[01:20:54] Let the artwork fill the entire thing and I would drop his name from the company and call it something else and make game number two

[01:21:03] wait, sorry game number three

[01:21:05] Look like a normal pinball machine in a lineup and get rid of all the stuff that just has made this thing

[01:21:11] Equality control nightmare

[01:21:14] So that's what I would do if I were them

[01:21:16] All right, let's go to spooky pinball and what marketing advice we would give them

[01:21:22] I

[01:21:23] Love the deposit. I love the production runs of 50 if I have to give them some advice get another denisi machine

[01:21:31] right

[01:21:33] And you release that from a marketing standpoint do they wait to the run is up on alice Cooper Scott or would you release that?

[01:21:41] Sort of midway through the life cycle of alice Cooper production

[01:21:45] I think they'll do I think they'll do 500 alice Cooper's no problem. So I would probably announce it a little bit later

[01:21:50] Um, hey every once in a while I you know, I try and pitch for serosum new technology and I think maybe spooky might look at it

[01:21:58] I like how you talk about your play field protector on your Batman SLE

[01:22:05] Why aren't we just starting to make plastic and carbon fiber play fields they can be cut carbon fiber is not all that expensive compared to

[01:22:12] Normal pinball machine parts. It's not the wood that's expensive. It's the printing process if you move to a plastic or carbon fiber

[01:22:20] The printing and curing process becomes very easy. It's just normal kind of paint materials

[01:22:24] I'd like to see them experiment with some cool things like that

[01:22:28] right

[01:22:30] I try to think of like and I agree, man. I mean like I think it's silly

[01:22:35] That we're still manufacturing pinball machines in a way that leads to so many

[01:22:40] Issues with play fields if you look at like from a marketing standpoint, right? You would you would look at what are customers complaining about and how can we innovate to solve those issues and probably the number one thing

[01:22:50] That we see the most complaints around is issues with wood play fields

[01:22:55] Easily chipping ghosting all that stuff. It's all like in archaic way to create a flat surface in which a ball can roll over it

[01:23:03] Um, so for spooky. I think my marketing advice for these guys

[01:23:09] You know, it's like

[01:23:11] On one level I want to say like

[01:23:14] I would hire a designer. I would really try I think they need to get

[01:23:19] You know different designers on board. I think the other marketing thing I would do for them is

[01:23:28] Maybe change the logo

[01:23:30] I just for something about that ghost on it. I just feel like

[01:23:36] I don't know it sort of they're like but I kind of an on the fence because

[01:23:40] When you market your company a spooky pinball. It's like are you only gonna make sort of horror themes?

[01:23:47] You know, I'm always like I just when I see it on like Jetsons or tna just feels off

[01:23:53] But there's like this ghost on something that's not in that

[01:23:57] Theme so I'm just not sure like maybe

[01:24:00] Spoo maybe they create a different division within spooky. That's not called spooky pinball

[01:24:05] So that it I don't know it just seems weird to me

[01:24:08] That I think that's I think they might be too small that might be too expensive for yeah using

[01:24:13] But they do love the horror themes and they're doing a great job with those

[01:24:16] Yeah, I mean, it's their passion and and I get it. It's like

[01:24:20] You know, there's like film directors who only make horror movies and I get why they're taking that approach

[01:24:26] all right, what

[01:24:28] Advice we give the Jersey Jack pinball

[01:24:34] Yeah, this this this is a tough one because there's a lot of there's a lot of things. They're really awesome man

[01:24:39] and it's

[01:24:41] It's like they're close. They're really close

[01:24:44] and

[01:24:45] That's one of the difficulties. I would say pick a theme that's kind of outside

[01:24:50] I'm very much looking forward to toy story. I'm not as I'm not as connected as you so I don't see any pictures or anything

[01:24:57] But I would like to see some cool things with toy story because I think they could pull that off

[01:25:01] But they got to get the max right

[01:25:03] In the short term I would probably say just do what you could to get that pirates mech back in there. It can be perfected

[01:25:09] I think they're that good they could do it

[01:25:11] um

[01:25:12] By one small advice is on the on the super limited or the collector's edition of toy story

[01:25:18] You know you got your Batman call out on your S. L. E. for Batman

[01:25:22] I want to see the limited editions of toy story get Andy painted on the bottom of the cabinet right

[01:25:27] But the owner's name on the super limited collector. That's really cool

[01:25:31] You know, we haven't even talked about that right those little details

[01:25:35] Jack owns that it's beautiful. Right the little details like Adam West is gonna

[01:25:40] Personally call out your name those little things and I think we overlooked this a lot right

[01:25:46] The little details that make people feel like they're getting a personal touch

[01:25:52] Can make the difference between someone saying I don't want something that everyone else has

[01:25:58] Versus I'm gonna have something that's uniquely mine

[01:26:02] And it doesn't always have to be expensive right to get that unique touch and I think that's a that's just like across the

[01:26:09] The entire pinball hobby Scott

[01:26:11] I think that is something that all these companies need to look at more is how can I make this game something that

[01:26:17] um, you know

[01:26:19] These collectors would would would buy because of that and never like go because of that well you're a concert guy

[01:26:25] Right you like you like you like to go out and see some music I love concerts anytime like I went to Metallica last summer

[01:26:32] And we just got a regular regular tickets is great time

[01:26:35] But we walked through all the line of people who are going through an extra experience where they may have paid two

[01:26:40] $200 to over a thousand dollars to have some sort of interaction with the band

[01:26:45] Now that's not part of the value if you did that with pinball machines like something that was special for the original owner

[01:26:51] That does make it harder to resell which is something that's cool for the collectors or they got some special event

[01:26:56] But it has to be really cool and they could charge a ton more money for some of that right right

[01:27:01] I don't know if Tom Hanks is gonna shake your hand if you buy toy story, but um

[01:27:06] Something that's really special would be pretty interesting right outside of the pinside Eric pinball community

[01:27:12] Because you look at the pinball community where a bunch of nerds

[01:27:15] Absolutely, absolutely if you could you could sell to the other

[01:27:18] 298 million people that live in this country and the other you know almost seven billion in the world

[01:27:24] If you did something more experiential that got the theme out better

[01:27:29] Right definitely

[01:27:31] I think my marketing advice for jack

[01:27:33] is to

[01:27:35] higher

[01:27:38] A marketing VP because I think he needs someone there

[01:27:42] To ink the right theme deals because everything else they're doing is right

[01:27:46] I mean they are like they're making the premium pinball experience come true

[01:27:52] They're making the modern day value Williams game

[01:27:55] But I just I think he has

[01:27:58] He needs more marketing help and I also think jack needs to lose the

[01:28:04] aversion to making games that appeal to the grown-up men

[01:28:08] I he's got this family fend friendly approached every game has to be this family friendly theme

[01:28:14] And I really think he needs to realize

[01:28:17] You know

[01:28:19] That's not your target like your target is a little bit more

[01:28:25] Our rated sort of adult male and I think he's trying to make pinball that appeals to everybody and in doing so

[01:28:33] He's managed to come out with themes that

[01:28:36] Aren't really driving the pinball buyer, you know crazy the way stern is doing it with you know with made in and and and other themes like that

[01:28:45] So that's my advice

[01:28:47] All right, let's end up with stern pinball the the big guys who probably don't need much marketing advice

[01:28:53] Scott because they have like 90 plus percent on the market

[01:28:55] But if we were to get an audience with Gary Stern or George Gomez

[01:28:59] What would we tell them is something they should consider?

[01:29:04] I would probably ask for two simple things

[01:29:08] One maybe experiment with some new technology or offer

[01:29:13] offer

[01:29:14] Playfield protectors

[01:29:16] Some things like that because one of the big issues people complain about is the dimpling which

[01:29:20] Dimpling and ghosting which I think is dumb that people complain about because it is the high velocity metal ball hitting wood

[01:29:27] In the rock paper scissors world pinball beats wood every time

[01:29:31] so

[01:29:33] Do something to fix that in the second one is

[01:29:36] Okay, there's a little bit of a challenge from the design and complexity of some of the the boutique vendors

[01:29:43] I just want to see some more games with more than two flippers

[01:29:48] Iron maiden

[01:29:50] Yep, get forward see more of it

[01:29:52] Right, right it's the button you know the the middle of the button and the locked down bar god that thing

[01:29:58] Everyone is for a third flipper. I

[01:30:01] Talk about like I hate it empires the way it's like you're slapping that thing like all day long

[01:30:06] I don't get it. I don't get it

[01:30:09] um my marketing advice to Gary Stern in George Gomez is very simple it would be to

[01:30:16] make more super L's

[01:30:18] and

[01:30:20] I would

[01:30:21] I would corner the high-end market if I were them because they can do it like nobody else and might and the way I would do it

[01:30:28] is I would offer

[01:30:31] exclusive coding and programming to those super le machines the second you make the experience

[01:30:39] of those super limited edition games different

[01:30:43] than the premium or le version of the game

[01:30:47] you could charge so much more and people would pay because why do we always

[01:30:54] Like glorify tron le as being worth 10,000 11,000 12,000 dollars

[01:31:00] It's only because the code is different

[01:31:03] That's it

[01:31:04] nothing else and coding is

[01:31:07] Is not that expensive where you couldn't get imaginative lime input

[01:31:13] You know a special like villain modes into all the sLE is people would lose their minds

[01:31:18] They would be like this is why it's worth what it is

[01:31:21] So that's what I would do I would use code as a way to create unique experiences

[01:31:25] Um for super limited edition owners and I think you could sell those games for

[01:31:30] Heck 15 to 20,000 depending on how many you made and I know people I love my I love my Avengers

[01:31:36] Ali machine. I know that that game gets a lot of heat doesn't get a lot of love on the threads

[01:31:40] But I picked that one because I really like the Ali it has an extra ramp on it

[01:31:45] It's got that cool arrow that goes across

[01:31:47] There's a lot of extra dimension to the game and I felt like that is a different game

[01:31:51] So I thought that was worth more than the standard edition

[01:31:54] So I like to see that the games are different right well that you get what you pay for

[01:31:59] Stern Stern is genius

[01:32:01] The the early premium model that they have is genius

[01:32:04] It's genius because the

[01:32:06] Ellie is like for the die hard has to have it like guy who really values that sort of exclusivity

[01:32:15] And he really is not getting anything really exclusive from a gameplay standpoint right

[01:32:21] And and then they sell the premium to the guy who wants the same gameplay experience but doesn't care so much

[01:32:28] about all the visual and

[01:32:31] cosmetic bells and whistles and so they're making money off the twice off the same

[01:32:37] Game without any gameplay enhancements

[01:32:41] Genius I I think they they will never change that model

[01:32:46] I don't think you can come up with a better model for pinball when when pinball companies got come out like American pinball

[01:32:52] They're like well, we're not going to do any Ellie's or premiums or pros and they start bragging

[01:32:57] About how that's good. I always shake my head because I'm like

[01:33:02] You fool you just left a ton of money on the table

[01:33:06] You just they just did because if they had a limited edition of Houdini that was even more dressed up

[01:33:12] That's the one that the guys who want the different kind of experience would buy

[01:33:18] Uh-huh they leave him money on the table and they think they're doing it for like the good of pinball

[01:33:23] But they're actually hurting themselves because they don't understand that human beings like we like collectors collect humans in a collectible hobby

[01:33:33] They're driven by having something different than the other guy

[01:33:37] They want the rarity they want the exclusivity not the tournament players they think those people are are idiots

[01:33:44] I had an interesting day um

[01:33:47] Oh it must have been almost a year ago. I was looking at consider I was considering a wo nelli machines and I didn't play one

[01:33:54] So I took I took your advice and said I want to play the machine before I start I go buy one

[01:33:58] And I looked up on pinside I found a pin cider who had on his home collection

[01:34:02] I reached out to him and I said I was considering buying one of these

[01:34:05] Would it be possible for me to come and play and he brought me in and he had a beautiful collection over in

[01:34:10] suburban Chicago

[01:34:12] And I got to play the game and I didn't like it

[01:34:15] But

[01:34:16] It was he was a guy that had limited editions of everything. It was a beautiful home

[01:34:21] He had a beautiful collection and those people that who will pay more for limited edition make it possible for a lot of other players to get something at all

[01:34:30] So I don't think I think some of the the pro players may diss the um the s le

[01:34:36] Market but the s le market is funding some of their games

[01:34:40] Absolutely, I mean it's

[01:34:42] Like I love so many of my friends who are like tournament players because they're never in on like new inbox purchases yet

[01:34:49] They're so vocal on like pinside every time a new inbox thing is revealed and it's like

[01:34:54] You guys don't even care like you just care about like how to exploit the code in a tournament and like multipliers like the that's not what a home

[01:35:02] collector who's into like

[01:35:05] You know a Jersey Jack machine is about

[01:35:08] I mean some some of them are but that's the minority the majority people want an amazing theme

[01:35:13] Beautiful artwork and that world under glass and magical stuff happening in the pinball machine

[01:35:19] That that just brings them enjoyment. They're not there to like sit five billion point scores

[01:35:25] That's not the reason why they own pinball machines. It's just not

[01:35:29] Um

[01:35:30] Well, Scott I really appreciate you coming on the show because we're happy we do one more what we are what am I missing?

[01:35:37] Or what I have more I have more than pinball machines than anything else. Oh you do

[01:35:44] And I travel a lot for my job

[01:35:46] So I have pinball arcade and then pinball on the on the iPad so I goof around in those sometimes when you

[01:35:53] Yeah, we take off and landing so I play a lot of those machines

[01:35:57] They can get a lot of machines to market very quickly

[01:35:59] And they don't seem to have some of the theme issues. There's a jaws. There's an e-t

[01:36:03] There's a new back to the future. They just released two Star Wars tables this week for last Jedi

[01:36:09] And why do you think Zen pinball like they look amazing like the theme integration in those things is incredible

[01:36:17] Compared to like fire behind the the ball and back to the future you got smoke you got crazy stuff in in Rome

[01:36:24] Those are some pretty amazing themes and I love I love playing those games

[01:36:29] Why can they get the licensing together that some of the the physical manufacturers can't I understand is licenses a video game

[01:36:36] Which is a different legal category and different approval process

[01:36:39] But man, they're tranking out themes and I don't know how many other people are buying you know

[01:36:44] But every time I see a new table I pop my $299, $399 for it

[01:36:48] I think you know that really hurt alien pinball when

[01:36:51] On alien day the Zen pinball came out and had like Sigourney Weaver in it

[01:36:56] The artwork was incredible all the assets they got and then Andrew highway is like well

[01:37:01] This is all we could get for their physical machine and it was just kind of like a like a went-wam moment where it's like

[01:37:08] Why can't the artwork be at least as good in the physical machine as in the digital machine?

[01:37:14] I don't understand the excuse for that

[01:37:17] But no Zen pinball is cool. I mean and the other thing is it's so much cheaper than

[01:37:23] Then plunking down 5 to 15,000 dollars on a big wooden box

[01:37:28] Well Scott thank you so much for joining. I really appreciate it. We'll have to do this again

[01:37:34] I think your take on pinball and marketing is

[01:37:38] Really some good insight and I think that people that listen to the show they do appreciate that we do sort of look at pinball

[01:37:45] Through the marketing lands and I think you know both of us doing it professionally. It's nice to sort of combine

[01:37:50] Our professional hopefully expertise with our pinball passion

[01:37:55] Yeah, I just want to thank the manufacturer for doing it

[01:37:57] So even though sometimes we bust at them. They're doing a great job. They're making games for us most of the time

[01:38:02] Some are not all some are

[01:38:05] Well, you can leave it to me to like you know kick them between the legs when they're when they're fn up because

[01:38:11] I have love and love and hate for the pinball manufacturers out there

[01:38:14] I love the ones who get people what they pay for and I've not I love the ones

[01:38:19] That have given people years of pain and suffering and we all know who's who in within those two camps

[01:38:26] So I will keep it honest and I'll keep it fair

[01:38:30] But you know we will never just universally love all pinball manufacturers on this show

[01:38:35] And I think that's probably why people listen to this show. That's why I listen all right awesome

[01:38:40] Well, Scott. Thank you so much. I appreciate it enjoy your time in Orlando

[01:38:44] Enjoy the warm weather hopefully and we'll talk to you real soon

[01:38:47] Thanks, Canada. All right
