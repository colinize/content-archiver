[00:00] What is thy biggy, my master?

[00:07] Out of the blue last night, I got an email from my master.

[00:22] For those of you who didn't hear my previous special edition, there is an individual

[00:27] out there that I consider to be probably the most well-educated, intelligent, and articulate

[00:34] follower of the pinball hobby.

[00:37] And this master will reveal himself one day, but it's not this day and it's not yet.

[00:45] But he sent me a note about his feelings on Expo and I just wanted to share that with

[00:50] you today.

[00:52] I got some additional feedback from people that I'm going to read on my next podcast,

[00:57] but for this special edition, let's hear what my master had to say about Expo.

[01:05] Kaneda, have you learned nothing since we last spoke?

[01:14] Running around Expo with your silly t-shirts on?

[01:21] Nobody cares Kaneda.

[01:26] It's strange to see this hobby evolve.

[01:32] Expo was weird.

[01:35] I felt like it sucked the life out of me watching Expo reveals.

[01:46] MGC feels a hundred times more fun than Expo Kaneda.

[01:57] It's very different.

[02:00] There are games with a split between pinball and arcane machines.

[02:10] Not to mention rooms of council games from the 70s onwards to today.

[02:22] There are people there that are selling newly designed Atari 2600 games and they are

[02:33] fucking amazing Kaneda.

[02:38] They even have the new shoot-em-up Gemma Arcade game Sky Cursor.

[02:48] It is not every day you see your wife go crazy because she spots a turbo graphics council

[03:00] playing Bunk's adventure that she had as a kid.

[03:10] Let me tell you Kaneda what I thought of Expo 2016.

[03:19] Jack's whole thing honestly just pissed me off.

[03:28] All of it Kaneda.

[03:31] I am just fucking sick to death of that guy constantly lying about everything.

[03:45] Not from a competition point of view just as a pinball hobbyist.

[03:55] He is such a fucking con man.

[04:02] So hard to deal with his limited numbers and ridiculous prices on a fucked up game.

[04:15] So hard to believe that they went this far, Kaneda with such a ridiculous theme.

[04:26] Whatever JJP was expecting to happen never happened.

[04:33] It was a disaster.

[04:36] Jack needed a slam dunk to even think about making it to game number 4.

[04:45] They are going to fail Kaneda.

[04:50] If walls and the hobbit weren't good enough and meant Jack needed 3 bailouts, dialed in

[05:02] is like a sure fire nail in the coffin.

[05:10] Stone on the other hand had a rousing success with Ghostbusters.

[05:18] They followed it up with a sold out Batman 66.

[05:26] Gary is fucking killing it right now.

[05:31] Looking at it from that perspective really shows how badly Jack is doing.

[05:40] He should have started a pinball.

[05:43] He should never have started a pinball company.

[05:48] He just doesn't get it on a basic pinball level.

[05:54] Okay.

[05:56] I am just going to say it.

[06:00] Jack is not smart.

[06:04] He has more balls than brains and he doesn't know what the fuck he is doing.

[06:14] I am just tired of his shit and JJP's deadline missing shit show.

[06:23] All he produces are games that have expensive toys but aren't that fun to play.

[06:35] Stern Ghostbusters pros are around $5,500.

[06:44] Dialed in is $9,000.

[06:51] The price gap there is pretty alarming.

[06:57] Even if dialed in was a knockout, it would not work at $9,000.

[07:08] Almost nothing would because it costs too much.

[07:14] Jack's whole fake limited edition shit and pricing is old.

[07:23] That $12,500 L.E.

[07:29] Once the orders are taken and shipped for that machine, he will make another L.E. model.

[07:40] That is what he does.

[07:44] Only how I don't even care about DMD vs LCD.

[07:51] A bad game is a bad game.

[07:56] I would rather have a Ghostbusters over a dialed in L.E.

[08:03] Any day of the week and twice on Sunday's Kaneda.

[08:13] We are basically back to 2011-2012.

[08:19] Stern is making and selling games.

[08:23] JJP is struggling and everybody else is small potatoes.

[08:33] Spooky is chugging along at a slow pace but it feels like the cheapness of their games

[08:41] is starting to catch up with them.

[08:46] Dominos was awful.

[08:50] I can honestly say I wouldn't even want that pin for free.

[08:58] I hated it that much.

[09:02] Boring, irritating sounds and I don't know it was just bad.

[09:12] DP is just a memory at this point.

[09:18] Nobody thinks about Dutch pinball anymore.

[09:23] Highway is still highway from 2012.

[09:29] Alien is not done.

[09:33] People are waiting and Andrew can't produce a smash hit.

[09:40] It was popular at the show because of JJP and Stern's high prices.

[09:47] It felt like some kind of weird 80s game.

[09:53] But let's be fucking honest, Kaneda.

[09:58] Alien is one of the most desirable licenses ever.

[10:08] We should all be dry-humping our computer screens right now for an alien game at 6500.

[10:19] We are not.

[10:22] It is not a knockout game.

[10:26] It is not immersive like they promise.

[10:32] It doesn't pull you into the alien world.

[10:37] You know what it looks like to me?

[10:41] A late 80s themed trapper keeper.

[10:47] Dole grey black plastic covered photoshopped bullshit.

[10:55] It is the trapper keeper of pinball machines.

[11:00] I would rather have the bally space invaders than alien.

[11:07] The ramps are these big fat ugly hunks of screws and plastics.

[11:17] Do you know why?

[11:20] Because he can't afford to pay for plastic thermoforming molds, Kaneda.

[11:29] Those ramps are a guy who doesn't have enough money left.

[11:37] If someone else is tooling your ramps for you, it costs a small fortune.

[11:46] Everything about that game feels cheap.

[11:50] The giant alien head is just as clunky as that ridiculously slow mech that grabs the

[11:59] ball.

[12:01] Honestly, Kaneda, I wish they figure it out.

[12:11] But I don't think it's going to happen.

[12:15] The whole highway situation is a ticking time bomb.

[12:22] This company is going to fail and you know what it should fail.

[12:31] Andrew is not capable of making a knockout game.

[12:38] That is the biggest problem with all of these guys.

[12:43] They all seem to think that because they make a game, everybody has to buy it.

[12:51] It has toys and necks and it is good theme.

[12:57] So go get in line for one because you are supposed to buy my game now instead of a stern.

[13:08] No thank you.

[13:11] We are seeing that with dialed in.

[13:15] It is thread after thread of everybody being told why they are supposed to buy one.

[13:26] We are being told that the price is fair because X, Y and Z.

[13:34] We are being told to put a deposit on it just because we are supposed to.

[13:42] This has great toys.

[13:45] Sorry but this is the biggest lie of all.

[13:50] Dialed in does not have a single killer toy.

[13:56] Not one.

[13:58] A phone with a screen is just a screen, Kaneda.

[14:03] We have already seen that in the Hobbit, the Was Crystal Ball, in WWE for fuck's sakes.

[14:16] This is not a toy.

[14:18] Bob the Builder is not a toy.

[14:23] We have seen that in Monster Bash, Rolling Stones.

[14:28] The Giant Woman's Arm is not a toy.

[14:33] There are no toys.

[14:37] Drone's that spin.

[14:40] Police, Kaneda.

[14:42] Give me a fucking break.

[14:46] Dialed in doesn't have a single new feature that we haven't seen somewhere else on something

[14:54] else.

[14:56] At least Batman Ellie has a little rotating room with a TV set on it.

[15:03] That is something that actually interacts with the player.

[15:11] I understand Kaneda your love for John's games.

[15:19] J-pop and I but heads a lot.

[15:24] These games have toys and ideas that are magical.

[15:30] Dialed in has a cell phone and a box with a label on it.

[15:36] The Walking Dead has a jail and a fat wood or log zombie that basically looks like a repranded

[15:45] X-Men.

[15:48] Where is the magic in that?

[15:51] Some of Thrones had just a throne.

[15:56] Ghostbusters pushed a little further with Slimer.

[16:02] John's themes are almost all identical but they have neat concepts and small toys.

[16:12] Too bad he is mentally broken as a person and a designer.

[16:21] The market needs this magic, Kaneda.

[16:26] That is why X-Bow was such a bust.

[16:31] Walsh had this magic.

[16:33] The big Lebowski had this magic.

[16:37] Pinball circus had some of it.

[16:40] Predator even had some of it.

[16:44] But zombie had a little bit.

[16:49] Even Woolly had more magic than dialed in.

[16:55] X-Bow 2016 was just a pair of games you couldn't buy that cost $10,000.

[17:06] Where is the magic in that, Kaneda?

[17:10] You couldn't even pay Batman.

[17:13] And all their excuses were total bullshit.

[17:19] And Alien didn't have any magic at all.

[17:24] It was drab and there were no characters in the game at all outside of a couple crappy call-outs.

[17:35] Domino's Pizza the Game.

[17:39] Anyone really?

[17:43] I will bring magic back to Pinball one day, Kaneda.

[17:50] I honestly think that Stern's strength is its biggest weakness.

[17:57] There are too big.

[18:00] They are too big.

[18:02] It allows them to make killer games, but it also makes them follow a script for every

[18:11] game.

[18:13] Just like I predicted, Batman SLE just looked like another Stern Kaneda.

[18:22] I didn't follow those pin-side threads and I didn't know the history on it.

[18:29] I saw it with my own eyes on Facebook.

[18:35] There is no way I would say that game is $15,000.

[18:43] It honestly just looked like Austin Powers to me.

[18:49] Gaudi and Clunky.

[18:53] It sounds like I am unfairly disparaging these guys, but I just can't shake the feeling

[19:02] after Expo.

[19:04] They all let us down.

[19:09] Everybody.

[19:10] To think I was worried about this Expo making it impossible for new people to come into

[19:19] the hobby.

[19:22] But it's all talk.

[19:24] Jack, Gary, J-Pop, machines that we cannot even play.

[19:33] I hope you interview Iceman and I hear from him on your show, Kaneda.

[19:40] I enjoy your podcast tremendously.

[19:45] The 2016 is not the golden age of pinball.

[19:52] We are back in the bronze era, struggling to get back to the magic that Bali Williams

[20:00] brought.

[20:03] So make more of your T-shirts, Kaneda.

[20:06] I'll even wear one one day.

[20:11] Until then.

[20:14] Be brave and listen to your master.
