[00:00] Good morning everybody, it is your Venerable Pinball Podcaster, Kanata, at four o'clock in the morning.

[00:05] And I want to do a little bit of a longer musical intro to this episode of Kanata's Pinball Podcast.

[00:10] And I want you to close your eyes, I want you to listen to the lyrics of this song,

[00:15] because I think it captures how I feel about Jersey Jack Pinball.

[00:19] I think it captures how I feel about Steve Richie saying he was going to bury what his friends over at Stern did to him by yanking everything out of his game.

[00:27] And then we see this game and there's not much in it, there's plastic tiny dancers,

[00:32] and there's like Siri, Apple, boring sterile callouts in the game.

[00:37] And it's just another Steve Richie game, nothing really magical.

[00:40] I want you to listen to this and I want you to think about where pinball pricing is at,

[00:45] and how much money these companies want to ask for these new games.

[00:49] And it's not just Jersey Jack, it's everybody.

[00:51] I want you to think about people making games only for themselves.

[00:55] They're not thinking about the pinball marketplace and what you want.

[00:58] They're just making what they want.

[01:00] That's not how it's supposed to be.

[01:02] You know, I want you to think about what's happening to the world of Stern LEs,

[01:05] in which they're just going to keep making new versions of games so that LEs now mean nothing.

[01:10] And people seemingly don't even care.

[01:12] This entire hobby needs to look in the mirror and ask itself, what are we doing here?

[01:17] What are we really doing here?

[01:18] And how can you really put a game like Elton John for $15,000 next to a game like Wizard of Oz

[01:25] that was $6,500 and with a straight face tell me that this is going to be one of the best-selling

[01:31] Jersey Jack pinball machines of all time.

[01:33] So close your eyes and listen to these lyrics and tell me this is not what's going on in the pinball industry.

[01:48] Why even try to change?

[02:12] You're Steve Ritchie.

[02:13] Are you going to try something new?

[02:15] Are you going to do a new design layout?

[02:17] Are you going to think about pinball a little bit differently?

[02:20] Now that you've had three years since Stern pinball,

[02:23] are you going to really do all these new magical, amazing tricks that you've said to us

[02:28] that Stern pinball kept you from doing?

[02:31] And then I look down at this Elton John game and when I saw those three drop targets straight up

[02:37] the middle where there's nothing behind them but a rubber, there's no movement, there's no magic,

[02:43] there's nothing happening in this game that's any different than previous Steve Ritchie games.

[02:48] In fact, it's very similar to what he's done before.

[02:52] So then you have to ask yourself why even try to change?

[02:56] Are you the king because you're just going to keep recycling idea after idea after idea?

[03:01] This is just another Steve Ritchie game that is wrapped up in more artwork and glitz and sparkle

[03:09] and lights but there's nothing of real substance in this game that even remotely warrants what

[03:16] they're charging for this game and that is the universal feedback on this game.

[03:21] It's another launch where we're like, it looks fun.

[03:24] I can't wait to shoot it.

[03:26] It looks beautiful.

[03:27] The Christopher Franci artwork is absolutely stunning on this game.

[03:30] But then you look down at the game and you're like, do you see a $15,000 game?

[03:35] Do you see a $12,000 game?

[03:38] You absolutely do not.

[03:40] And put this game next to ACDC.

[03:42] Just do me a favor, put it next to ACDC and tell me there's a lot more in this game.

[03:47] Put this next to Led Zeppelin and be like, oh, he really put a ton more into this game.

[03:51] If you remove that Elton John toy, right, the little toy in the back,

[03:56] which is probably the only thing I really like in this game or feels creative,

[03:59] the plastic Elton John that locks the balls.

[04:01] I mean, I feel like that looks like something that would be on a topper,

[04:04] but now it's the main thing underneath the glass.

[04:07] If you look down at this game, what is in it?

[04:10] What took him so long and what creativity went into this game?

[04:15] And I hate to say it, but Steve Ritchie, this has to be it.

[04:18] Like I think he just needs to retire now.

[04:21] I think this needs to be his final game.

[04:23] And look at a guy like George Gomez.

[04:25] He's been designing games all these years.

[04:27] And look at George Gomez's James Bond.

[04:29] He tried something new.

[04:31] He didn't go back to the well.

[04:32] He's not just making the same game over and over and over and over and over again.

[04:36] And that's how you're supposed to do it.

[04:37] And look, when you run out of ideas, when you run out of ideas, it's just time to stop.

[04:43] There's too much money at stake in pinball to get it wrong.

[04:47] There's too much money at stake to come out with stuff like this that is just not that inspired.

[04:53] It's not that creative.

[04:55] You can see the passion is not there.

[04:57] Imagine if you gave Elton John to Jack Danger.

[05:00] Imagine if you gave Elton John to Keith Elwyn.

[05:03] Imagine if you gave Elton John to Scott Denisi.

[05:06] There's just a lot of younger designers in the world of pinball that would just tackle this

[05:11] so much differently.

[05:13] And Steve Ritchie, I hate to say it, but it's just more of the same.

[05:17] And you can't just bring out more of the same if you want to charge these prices.

[05:22] Now look, if this game was $8,500 for the premium edition of the game,

[05:28] or what are they calling it now, the Platinum Edition,

[05:30] if it was $8,500 or $9,000 for that and $12,000 for the CE of the game,

[05:35] and they made only 500 CE's, it's a much different conversation, but they didn't do that.

[05:41] And they're putting, again, once again, much less in these games than games like Pired to the Caribbean

[05:48] and games like Dialed In and games like The Hobbit and games like Wizard of Oz.

[05:52] And I would even say Guns N' Roses, when you just look down at Guns N' Roses,

[05:55] of course this game is going to shoot better because it's got a wide open play field with

[06:01] nothing in it. Of course, it's going to have better flow and better speed, but then look down at

[06:06] Guns N' Roses and you tell me where the passion is in both of those games.

[06:11] And you look at the Guns N' Roses code, how much better integrated Guns N' Roses is into that game.

[06:17] I mean, I'm looking at the Keri Hardy footage and Keri, by the way, I think it was so disgusting that

[06:22] David Fixed revoked Keri Hardy's media credentials at Pinball Expo simply because Keri Hardy

[06:30] said some truthful things about Galactic Tank Force, so David Fixed yanked his media credentials.

[06:36] This is disgusting, people. This is where we're at in Pinball. Let's shut down anybody who wants

[06:43] to tell you something truthful or something that is not just another shill in the Pinball content

[06:48] space and we're going to take away his media credentials. We're going to ban Canada from

[06:52] Pinside for 10 years. I mean, it's absolutely shameful what is going on and the sort of echo chamber

[06:58] they're trying to create, but we're not going to fall for it and people aren't falling for it.

[07:02] And the reason why I know they're not falling for it is I just have to look at the numbers who

[07:06] are joining Canada's Pinball podcast every single week. And so I'm watching Keri Hardy,

[07:10] man, I'm listening to it and I'm like, oh my gosh, I can't believe it. They're once again using these

[07:15] really cheap like slot machine sounds throughout the game. And the worst part about this game are

[07:21] the callouts. It's like this monotone, sterile. It sounds like Siri from iPhone. This British

[07:28] sounding robotic AI sounding voice is doing all of the callouts in the game. And if you just closed

[07:35] your eyes and you walked up to this machine, you would think you're in Las Vegas standing in front

[07:40] of an Elton John slot machine. And once again, Jersey Jack, they just keep doing the same things

[07:46] over and over and over and over and over again. And they are expecting different results. Like,

[07:50] why don't they try anything new? Again, they've heard this feedback on every single game over the

[07:56] last five years. Stop using these cheap slot machine sounds, stop it. Nobody likes it. And

[08:04] instead of going to get David Thiel and going to get the guy who does the best sound in all of

[08:09] pinball, instead of using their billions of dollars to make their products stand above everybody

[08:14] else's, instead of going to get real voice actors, giving you animated callouts, like go play a

[08:21] Balli Williams machine and listen to the way the pinball callouts should be. They need to have some

[08:27] passion, some animation. And then you listen to this game. And then you realize this is it. This

[08:32] is all Jersey Jack is going to be now this uninspired stuff with these generic sounds, these

[08:37] generic callouts. And where is the heart and the soul of this company? And the truth is this,

[08:42] it's gone because Jack is out of it. This is not his company anymore. He's simply a salaried

[08:48] employee. And I'm just going to say it. Look, some of you might buy this game. Most of you are

[08:53] waiting for it to go on sale because anyone who buys this game right now, you just lost a few

[08:58] thousand dollars. And I don't understand why you would pre ordered. Let's talk about that for a

[09:02] minute. How ridiculous it is that Jersey Jack revealed this game at Expo when this game is not

[09:08] on the line. I love it. Some of the big distributors you asked them, when is this game going to be

[09:12] made? You know, if they're saying Q4, Q1, it's not going to be Q4. We both know that this game is not

[09:17] going to be shipping Q4. It's going to be shipping Q1. It's going to be shipping four to five months

[09:22] from now. So then why did they show the game at Expo? If the game is not in a box, freaking barrels

[09:27] of fun rocked up with 10 machines, 10 machines in boxes that people could go home with. And I

[09:34] want to give a big shout out to barrels of fun. Yes, I'm not going to make fun of their name today

[09:39] because they did something amazing. They showed up at the show with 10 games in boxes, which Jersey

[09:45] Jack Pinball couldn't do. They revealed their game at the right time. And they also put more toys in

[09:50] their game and more passion into labyrinth than I see in Elton John. And they're not hiding their

[09:56] passion with lights and artwork and other stuff. They actually put stuff where it counts. And Steve

[10:01] Richie just made another game. At least you can see they put a lot more passion into the game. The

[10:06] other thing I want to do is congratulate Aaron and Fast Pinball and the team over there that made

[10:10] this game because the labyrinth games were played for 14 hours straight at Pinball Expo. 14 hours

[10:16] straight. And they didn't have any single issues with the games. The games didn't crash. They didn't

[10:21] go down. And I want to say congratulations because that's amazing. So if you're buying one, you know

[10:26] you're getting a quality product. This is the thing. It's like now people feel a lot better about

[10:30] supporting this brand new company than they do Jersey Jack Pinball. You know, I predicted that

[10:36] Elton John was going to win Expo. It didn't win Expo. It didn't even come close to winning Expo.

[10:41] And again, the reason why they revealed the game when they did is because they are terrified of Keith

[10:47] Elwyn. They are terrified. They are trying to lock your money in now because they know when you see

[10:53] Jaws, you're not going to want this game. They know when Pulp Fiction goes on the line, you're not

[10:58] going to want this game. This is such a desperation move if there ever was one by Jersey Jack Pinball.

[11:05] And people are not going to fall for it. I mean, Todd Tucky, I love you Todd. But Todd texted me

[11:10] is like, this game is going to sell out Todd. It is not going to sell out Todd. You felt that way

[11:14] about Toy Story 4. There is no way this game is selling out. What fool would run to this game now

[11:21] and give a nonrefundable deposit on a $15,000 game, a game that has plastic $3 tiny dancers.

[11:30] Go look at the crocodile in this game. I thought Steve Ritchie would have made a big crocodile

[11:35] that you could lock the ball in its mouth. And it was a much more impressive mechanism.

[11:39] Go look at the crocodile represented in this game. It's this cheap little $5 toy that just

[11:44] wiggles back and forth. That's all it does. You know, and look, Jersey Jack has the most

[11:48] polished launch videos ever. Like that launch video was spectacular. A little strange when you

[11:54] watch it, you're like, do you know your demographic? We're watching Gen Z women stand over $15,000

[12:00] pinball machines doing ballet moves. And you tell me that Jersey Jack Pinball has not lost the

[12:05] narrative. You tell me that Jersey Jack Pinball has no idea who the pinball buying demographic is.

[12:11] And these have all been Jack Guinari's selections. These have all been Godfather, Toy Story 4, Elton

[12:18] John. Jack Guinari has sent this company down a road in which he doesn't know what people want.

[12:24] Where's the Matrix Jack? Where's Harry Potter? How are you going to get to Harry Potter with

[12:29] three misses in a row, Jack? I don't know. Maybe the Abbas family, this whole thing is just a tax

[12:35] right off and it doesn't matter. But man, oh man, oh man, when I saw this game and you saw me on

[12:40] Facebook Live, I was so excited to be blown away. I'm absolutely deflated by this offering.

[12:48] And the only thing I really love about these games, the only thing that I look down and I love

[12:52] about these games is I love the Christopher Francie art package on the Platinum edition of the game.

[12:58] It is a much nicer art package than what's on the collector's edition. John Yousey did that. Now,

[13:04] look, Francie is a better artist than John Yousey. And here's why they did this. Like instead of

[13:09] putting Francie, which they know is the better artist on the collector's edition, I think they

[13:14] swapped it this time because they didn't want the nicest package to be the CE because I think they

[13:19] need to move Ellie's of this game because they saw what happened with Godfather. Sure, they might

[13:24] sell a thousand CEs, but then all these $12,000 Ellie's are going to sit. I think they tried to

[13:30] juggle it a little bit with this Elton John. And hey, look, I think I can summarize this game

[13:35] real quickly. It's beautiful looking. The music is great because it's Elton John. But then I look

[13:40] up on the screen and it's not like G&R, right? You're not like at an Elton John concert. You don't

[13:46] hear the whole song play. You're not seeing Elton John in concert sing the song when you start the

[13:52] song. So it's not like G&R. You've got Elton John music competing with these slot machine sounds.

[13:59] And then you've got this sterile callouts coming in throughout the game. And I don't know. Like,

[14:04] if this is for you, sure. But I'm telling you the reason why they dropped it when they dropped it,

[14:09] they're terrified of Jaws. They know Keith Elwin is going to clobber the sales of this game.

[14:14] They know many of you are going to want to order Stranger Things and the new Elvira game. And they

[14:19] knew that. And they're trying desperately to lock in sales right now. But again, if you ordered this

[14:24] game yesterday, you just lost $1,000 to $2,000 instantly because by the time these games are

[14:31] on the line, Jaws will be out. Pulp Fiction will be on the line. More games are coming.

[14:38] And they know that. And this is all they got. And they have no more Godfather sales. This company

[14:45] is not just on the ropes. It's three strikes in my book. I think they're out. I think Jersey Jack

[14:51] is out. I think they've lost all their mojo. I think they have no answers. I think their only

[14:56] answer right now is to give Eric Minier a theme people want like Matrix or Harry Potter. I think

[15:02] their only answer right now is to rerun more Pirates of the Caribbean. I mean, how silly is

[15:07] this company? They are sitting on games people would much rather have than their latest three

[15:13] offerings and they won't give it to you. What does Stern Pinball do? And the reason why Stern

[15:18] Pinball dominates, they know you want it more Stranger Things, so they're making it. They

[15:23] no demand for Elvira is through the roof. So they made another LE of Elvira that is gorgeous.

[15:29] It is gorgeous. This new Elvira edition. I don't like what they're doing. They're three LEs now

[15:34] with Elvira. I don't like it. You know, they're going after the newbies and they just burned

[15:38] everybody who bought the other editions of the game. I still think the purple one, the 40th

[15:43] anniversary is my favorite. I think if you put them side by side, I'd much rather have the 40th.

[15:48] But hey, this is only $13,000, right? The damn 40th people were spending $25,000 on that 40th

[15:56] when it dropped. Look, and we now know that Stern will not respect what an LE is. So like, if you

[16:01] buy a new Stern LE, I think, you know, I just be prepared to be disappointed. I mean, that's it.

[16:06] Now they've made sure that all these LEs mean nothing and they're going to go back. If they

[16:09] make a Batman 60th anniversary, I kind of might get out of pinball altogether. And I don't understand

[16:14] people defending these Stern moves. Like, we can't, why? Why as consumers, would you be on the side

[16:21] of a greedy company move? It's a greedy company move. If you make a game and say, hey, this is the

[16:27] only limited edition version of Elvira we're going to make. That is the reason why you're buying it.

[16:34] You're buying it for the scarcity and for the beauty of it and saying to yourself, hey, they're

[16:37] not going to one up me. Like, I'm going to spend the most amount of money and they're never going

[16:41] to one up me. And then they one up you. And then they one up you again. And we have people saying,

[16:46] who cares? Don't buy pinball as an investment. Who cares that they're doing what do you mean? Who

[16:50] cares? The people who say who cares aren't the people who bought the LEs. So stick to your last

[16:56] because you don't understand what it feels like to be burned by a company who's going against

[17:00] what it promised you. That this was it. This was the limited version of this game. Move on to the

[17:06] next game. It's not like Stern needs to do limited editions of Jurassic Park and other games in Elvira.

[17:12] Again, they don't they've sold enough. Move on. Oh, Canada, you know, part of me is glad I didn't

[17:17] go to Expo seeing some of the walkthroughs and seeing Elton John and hearing those slot machine

[17:23] sounds would just send me into a tizzy. Also, I don't even want to see these people. I don't want

[17:27] to see David Figgs. I don't want to see Steve Ritchie. I don't want to see the people. I really

[17:31] don't. I'd rather just sit at home and text with Jason Knapp and have an amazing time talking about

[17:36] what we're seeing at Expo than spend like over $1,000 to be there when I could use that money

[17:41] and take Brenda out for an amazing meal or two. Alright, so I also said yesterday that I would

[17:47] let you know the next title from American Pinball that Ryan McQuade is working on. Alright, so let's

[17:53] do this. Let's do what Canada always does. I'm going to tell you right now the title Ryan McQuade

[17:58] is working on. And here's the crazy part. American Pinball just did a factory tour in which they

[18:03] teased He-Man and 300 and they showed us this brand new factory with all of these galactic tank

[18:10] forces and all of these Houdinis. Who the heck is ordering a new and box Houdini when you can get

[18:15] one for $2,000 less in mint condition right now? I don't know. Looked a little bit like a staged

[18:21] photo, but here's the thing. We've been hearing they have a video game license and they do. We

[18:26] know that Ryan McQuade wanted to make Sonic the Hedgehog and he did. And we know that David Figgs

[18:32] lost the license to somebody else. We know that David Figgs has been in charge of American Pinball

[18:37] now for many, many years and the decisions he's made have not worked out. And I'm here to tell

[18:42] you right now, this is going to be another decision that doesn't work out because it's not He-Man,

[18:48] it's not 300, it's not Sonic the Hedgehog. It is a video game, it is a cartoon, but this is another

[18:55] example of someone making a game for themselves, not making a game for the pinball buying audience.

[19:03] This is the equivalent of making Dennis Norman's Galactic Tank Force. You made a game that Dennis

[19:09] Norman wanted to make for a decade. There's a reason why that game sat in a garage for a decade

[19:15] and Spooky Pinball didn't want to make it. There's a reason why David Figgs sees that game and says

[19:20] let's make it. And that's the reason why David Figgs hasn't fixed American Pinball. And that's

[19:25] the reason why this company is out of touch and they don't get it. And I'm just going to rip the

[19:29] band-aid off and you heard it here first. Get ready Jason Knapp and get ready, Kinet assist,

[19:34] to copy me and Jason Knapp and then not give us credit you little weasel. Are you ready for it?

[19:39] Are you ready for it? I'm just going to say it. Kinetist Pinball Podcast is here to tell you

[19:43] that Ryan McQuade's game and American Pinball, this is what I'm hearing. Now look, you could call

[19:48] this a rumor but my person said this is 100% what it is Chris. Congratulations on having this scoop.

[19:54] I love you. I trust this guy. So get ready for it. Ryan McQuade's game is a video game which I

[20:00] haven't really played. I guess it's popular with certain people. It's niche. It's not something

[20:04] that everybody's like oh my god I can't wait to get this. Ryan McQuade's American Pinball game is

[20:09] Cuphead. Yes, you heard that right. Cuphead, C-U-P-H-E-A-D. Cuphead. If you've been clamoring for a

[20:21] Cuphead Pinball machine, congratulations. You're about to get one. Guess who hasn't been clamoring

[20:29] for a Cuphead Pinball machine? Almost everybody. Can you tell why I'm deflated? At these prices

[20:38] there is no room for this anymore. This hobby is too expensive. It is not the cute, cheap,

[20:45] and cheerful hobby it was eight years ago. You cannot come out with games like Cuphead. We need

[20:53] to get back to making themes people want. I bet you could get the Bloodsport license in front of

[21:00] Cuphead but this is the thing is Ryan McQuade probably didn't grow up watching Bloodsport even

[21:04] though most of us did. So Ryan McQuade wants to make what he wants to make and he's making a huge

[21:11] gamble with this and David Ficks has gambled with Mukesh's money I think for the last time.

[21:18] Because here's the thing. The other thing David Ficks wants to make over at American Pinball

[21:21] is a Barry Osler game that is just untitled as Barry-O. They want to release a Barry-O game

[21:28] that is single level. What is wrong with these people? You don't gamble with other people's money.

[21:34] Nobody wants a Barry-O game. We're all sad that he's no longer with us but this isn't what you do.

[21:40] You've got to start doing market research. People would rather buy Matrix than Elton John. You've

[21:46] got to do market research. What's selling in the pinball market? Games designed like Keith

[21:53] Elwin games. That's also part of market research people. What kinds of pinball games are working?

[21:59] What kinds of designs are leading to sales? And then Steve Ritchie comes out with another

[22:04] generic Steve Ritchie game. It's over. It's over. These legacy people that have no ideas. Pat Lawler

[22:12] was one of them. Steve Ritchie is another one. It's time to get out of the hobby. Retire gracefully.

[22:19] Handed over to the next Jack Danger, the next Keith Elwin. My friend designing Merlin. I wish

[22:25] you could see this game. There's real creativity in it. It has real passion. I hope he can get the

[22:31] game to market. He's not going to bring it into the market until he's ready but that's what we need.

[22:36] We need new blood in pinball. It's over. Everybody, I love you guys. I'm not going to stop. I know it's

[22:42] coming. There's a lot of exciting stuff coming down the road in pinball. This is another sort of

[22:47] off year. It's going to be labyrinth and Foo Fighters sort of battling it out at the Twippies.

[22:52] I think Foo Fighters might win Game of the Year. It might battle it out with James Bond people

[22:56] because the new James Bond code I hear is incredible and a lot of people are loving James Bond. So

[23:02] James Bond, even though the code stunk when it came out, it might have enough fandom now by the

[23:09] time we get to December that it might have a chance to beat out Foo Fighters for Game of the Year.

[23:14] But I think everyone's going to give it to Jack because it's Jack's first game

[23:18] and there's nothing you can give to George Gomez that he doesn't already have.

[23:22] Elton John might win Best Art Package. Maybe it'll go to Venom. I think it's going to go to a

[23:26] stern machine because again, there's not many JJP fans and it's a vote by the populace and I

[23:31] think Zambietti's going to win it with either Venom or Foo Fighters. There's nothing else that's

[23:36] really going to surprise us unless Jaws comes out when it's still eligible for Twippy votes. See,

[23:42] that could be the dark horse. Everybody have a great day. Have a great Friday. Pinball Expo seems

[23:49] like it's turning out to be a bust in terms of what we thought we were going to get. We didn't get a

[23:54] new game from Pinball Brothers. We got a new code update for an old game. We didn't get anything

[24:00] from Turner Pinball. What a joke that reveal was. I'm not even going to talk about it. I feel like

[24:04] Turner Pinball needs to be a nepo baby. Like he needs to just be a guy that's got so much money.

[24:09] He doesn't need to make smart moves because that's exactly what he's showing us and it's so weird.

[24:14] It's like he's battling it out with Home Pin for the most irrelevant pinball company in the world.

[24:19] Everybody have a great day and trust me, we're going to be fine. We're going to still have fun in

[24:24] this hobby. We're going to keep the pressure on these companies. Let the distros buy these games

[24:30] and let them sit on them. Trust me, you'll get Elton John for $3,000 off by the time it hits the line

[24:37] later.

[25:07] You know, that's what's exciting about Steve being at Jersey Jack. You know that he's going to be

[25:20] given all the toys and this is a man who loves toys. Jack, we're excited for him. Well, we let him

[25:26] loose and he made something that, and I don't know if he used them and do all that stuff, but I will.

[25:32] He made a really great game and I think a lot of people will say Steve Richie is back, really.
