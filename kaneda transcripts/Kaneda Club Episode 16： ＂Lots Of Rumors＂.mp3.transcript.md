[00:00] I heard a girl laugh

[00:04] They say you got a broken heart

[00:15] Welcome to the Canada Club episode 16

[00:18] You know you can't say that canada doesn't give you a lot of content. We've done 16 of these

[00:24] 627 of the main show I've got merchandise coming

[00:27] I want to thank each and every one of you and I always try to talk a little bit more intimately on these club shows

[00:32] And I do mean it this show takes a lot and just from the regular show the Facebook live the club episode

[00:40] Reading pin side the amount of hours I would say I put into this hobby the amount of hours it takes to do this over a five-year

[00:47] Period of time I will never make it back Ed Robertson could inside me over all of his money

[00:54] And I would never be able to make back the hours of my life

[00:58] I've put into this and do I do it because I love it

[01:02] Absolutely do I do it for the money clearly not five dollars is like the minimum to get into the door of the Canada Club

[01:09] And that's nothing but I thank each and every one of you who contributes that it means a lot and it does and every month

[01:17] This does help and it helps my family out tremendously

[01:20] So I really do appreciate it and that's why on this club episode

[01:25] I'm gonna give you some juicy things to think about and these are some rumors from the pinball world

[01:32] Some of them I'm very confident about some of them are more sort of stretch rumors

[01:37] But I want to tell you what I'm hearing because this is what's fun right?

[01:41] It's fun to talk about what these companies have coming out next we pretty much know every single thing

[01:47] Happening this year John Borg's rush is 100% happening next at Stern

[01:53] That's not a rumor and while it's not confirmed

[01:56] I hate to say that that's a great rumor. I'm giving you you know

[01:59] It's rush if you're a rush fan. I would absolutely get on a list for this machine

[02:05] Do I think it's gonna sell like hotcakes? It'll be lukewarm

[02:09] Rush does not have a lot of mainstream popularity

[02:12] There's no way you're gonna sell as many rush machines as AC DC as guns and roses as Metallica as kiss

[02:19] You're just not you're just not gonna do it now

[02:21] There is crossover between the rush fan base and pinball

[02:25] But will it sell tremendously well? I don't think so I do think there's gonna be a lot in this game

[02:30] I talked to someone who saw it and there's a really big circular mech almost like the stargate that takes up

[02:37] So much of the play field and his smack dab in the middle of the game or in the middle back area of the game

[02:43] But I heard that it pops so I think this game is gonna be much more of a world under glass

[02:49] Then we ever got from Led Zeppelin, but that's not saying much because Zeppelin was baron

[02:53] But John Borg likes to put a lot in the game another rumor

[02:57] I heard that was really interesting was that the bomb the bill of materials between Led Zeppelin and Godzilla

[03:04] Was pretty much identical and that's pretty scary right how could Steve Richie only put that much in Led Zeppelin and

[03:12] Look at everything that was put into Godzilla and I'm talking very close

[03:17] It just goes to show you that I think another reason why Steve Richie left was I think he was kind of tired of being

[03:24] Upstage by Keith Owen and Elwyn's the king at Stern so we shall see what Steve Richie can do at Jersey Jack pinball

[03:31] Let's go down the distributor list and I'm gonna do my best to tell you what I'm hearing and what the rumors are

[03:37] So Stern let's start with them rush is next. I know what is after rush. I know what it is

[03:43] I know what the theme is I can't tell you yet. I'm sworn to secrecy

[03:48] But I will tell you on January 1st January 1st

[03:52] I will reveal the next Stern pinball machine. It is not back to the future

[03:58] It is not James Bond. It is not the matrix. I think this one's gonna be a brine any title

[04:04] I also think Randy Martinez is gonna be on artwork

[04:08] I also think that a lot of you are gonna feel like Stern is going back to the same well again

[04:14] I'll leave it at that

[04:15] But I don't think this is gonna be an oh my god take my money now theme for them

[04:20] I think it's gonna be fine

[04:22] I think it's gonna be a fun thing to play

[04:24] But I don't think that this is like oh this is what we want or need more of so that's enough to go on like as

[04:31] For his categorical what is Stern keep doing more and more of do we need another one?

[04:36] You're gonna probably say we don't we're good

[04:39] There's also the rumor that James Bond is coming now James Bond was a game that Steve Ritchie was working on Stern

[04:45] Does have the James Bond license and it is most likely gonna be finished by George Gomez

[04:50] So look for that sometime in 2022 the one rumor that I just don't have any confidence in is back to the future

[04:57] I almost feel like back to the future is meant to throw us off the scent that they keep putting that out there

[05:02] But it's not I don't think anyone seen it back to the future whitewood

[05:06] Obviously people would love this game obviously if back to the future happens it would be a kapout title

[05:12] But I'm just not hearing a lot about this game coming out anytime soon

[05:17] So let's go over to Jersey Jack Pimble. I hear it a rumor that JJP does in fact have the matrix license

[05:25] So that is awesome

[05:27] But I'm also hearing a rumor of what Eric Minier's next game is and it's not the matrix

[05:34] I'm also hearing a rumor that Eric's game is pretty much done his follow up to G&R is done and that it's gonna be a game

[05:41] That's very fast pace right?

[05:43] He's known for like tons of mechs and tons of toys

[05:46] But I think this next game is gonna be one where he really tries to show us that he can make Pimble flow and speed part of his repertoire

[05:55] I know what the theme is it's way too early to tell you it is based on a popular film series

[06:02] Alright, I'll give you that much of a hint and no it's not Harry Potter

[06:07] But Pat Lawler's Toy Story is next, okay?

[06:11] Now I thought for a moment what if Pat Lawler isn't doing Toy Story and it might be the matrix

[06:17] Maybe Pat's been working on the matrix because it would make total sense to get a new matrix Pimble machine out

[06:23] With the movie coming out this December

[06:25] But I heard from very reliable sources that Pat Lawler's machine is going to be toy story

[06:32] Which does make me happy and I actually like the toy story movies more than I like the matrix movies

[06:39] The first matrix movie is great the second one is interesting and the third is horrible and collectively

[06:48] Have these movies aged amazingly well not so much

[06:52] Toy Story those movies are classics all four of them are amazing

[06:58] But after this right so Jersey Jack like after toy story Jersey Jack has done a good job

[07:04] You know keeping a lid on what their future titles are

[07:08] Unfortunately can he to nose Eric's next game. I'm gonna hold it

[07:12] I'm not gonna spoil it yet. It's way too soon. Alright, let's go over to spooky Pimble

[07:17] So what's the rumor with spooky Pimble so as many of you know David Van S is not doing the animations on these new games

[07:24] And David Van S was part of the spooky family for a lot of titles and people loved his animations in al this Cooper

[07:32] And so the question is is like why is David Van S on the sidelines now?

[07:37] I heard a rumor that this is why he is on the sidelines because David Van S

[07:43] brought a title to spooky that he wanted to make so he went out and he got a theme and he started designing a game

[07:50] And he wanted to make a game for spooky that they said nope

[07:55] We're not making this and I have to say after watching the movie this weekend

[08:00] I don't disagree with spooky's decision to say dude

[08:04] We're not making this game. This is not what the Pimble community wants

[08:09] The game that David Van S wanted to make the game that he was working on the game that they said no to that might be the reason why he's no longer working with them

[08:19] Is no other than the 1980 something movie you know as

[08:25] Labrith with David Bowie and Jennifer Connolly now

[08:29] I watched labrith this past weekend and as I was watching it

[08:33] I was saying would this make for a good Pimble machine?

[08:36] Is this something that men 40 to 60 years old want to buy?

[08:41] Is this the right way to go and it might be interesting to design a game that is like a labrith like a maze to get through

[08:48] This isn't what people want. This isn't the kind of theme that's a take my money now kind of theme

[08:54] It's probably a theme that's affordable

[08:56] It's a theme where you could get a lot of the assets for it but

[09:00] But I don't disagree with spooky that this isn't where we're gonna place our bets like Halloween is a better theme than labrith

[09:08] So is ultra man

[09:09] So is this the reason why David Van S is on the sidelines now and not working on spooky's games

[09:15] That's what I heard it was labrith and he wanted to make it and they were like nope

[09:19] And it's a big issue with spooky Pimble right because the problem is spooky Pimble's problem is

[09:24] It's hard for them to keep these guys happy because the people that worked on all these games

[09:30] Ultimately you're learning how to make Pimble machines together

[09:33] And then you want it to be your turn to make your machine

[09:37] But they can't make games fast enough

[09:39] So if you're Scott Denise, you might have to wait two three years to get to your next title

[09:44] Same thing if you're David Van S and you want to become a Pimble designer

[09:48] See, I think the same thing happened with Ben Heck

[09:51] They don't want to wait in the batter's box to get a chance at the plate

[09:54] Because they might never get a chance at the plate

[09:56] Because if spooky's on this 18 month design schedule

[10:00] Then the next game might be bugs next game and then it's bugs company right

[10:04] It's Charlie and his family's company

[10:06] So they might never let these designers have their moment in the sun

[10:11] And I think that's what's happened

[10:13] I think some of these guys are just leaving because they're like I'm not going to sit around waiting

[10:17] While you keep putting my game up on the shelf and you keep making your games

[10:21] So I'm going to end this Canadian Club episode with probably something you've never heard

[10:26] Two other rumors and I'm going to end this episode

[10:28] So I'm hearing a rumor again not confirmed a rumor that American Pimble

[10:34] Possibly has the license for he man masters of the universe

[10:40] Now if you're like me and you grew up loving he man

[10:44] This would be amazing castle grayschool

[10:47] The he man theme the music all the characters in it

[10:50] And it's an animation so you can get all the clips from it

[10:53] Is it based on the new Netflix show I don't know

[10:56] But that is the rumor and I think he man masters of the universe

[11:00] If it was made by someone like Dennis Nordman

[11:03] Would be incredible

[11:04] Remember how cool the castle was in Alice Cooper's nightmare castle

[11:08] Imagine if that were castle grayschool

[11:11] So I think any any super popular 80s cartoon is a great candidate for a Pimball machine

[11:19] All right now my final rumor

[11:21] Chicago gaming company what's coming next from them

[11:25] What is going to be a non remake game that they make

[11:28] Now here is the rumor you're hearing it here first on Canadian Club episode

[11:33] I hope this justifies your monthly cost of joining the club

[11:38] Chicago gaming companies next game I believe after cactus canyon will be

[11:44] Mark Richie's pulp fiction

[11:47] Now you probably feel like you knew that

[11:50] But here's what you don't know what I'm hearing again a rumor

[11:54] Is that mark richie's pulp fiction is going to be a single level system 11 game

[12:01] They're going to do like a throwback Pimball machine

[12:04] Allah the Beatles

[12:06] That is what I'm hearing it is going to be

[12:08] It is going to be more of a single level throwback approach to Pimball

[12:13] And it's not going to feel like a modern game per se

[12:16] I also heard that they have a lot of assets in the game

[12:19] So does that excite you and if you think about pulp fiction it's interesting right

[12:24] Because to create a physical world under glass from the movie pulp fiction

[12:28] Kind of difficult right kind of hard

[12:31] It's not like it's an action adventure movie

[12:33] It's not like it's a movie that has like heroes and villains per se

[12:37] It's a very complex story pulp fiction

[12:40] So that's maybe why they're going the way they're going

[12:42] Because maybe it's more about the music and the modes from the movie

[12:45] But it's so iconic like the soundtrack of pulp fiction

[12:49] And so what is it going to be like a single level pulp fiction game from mark richie

[12:53] Do you think that's what people want?

[12:55] Is that what it's going to be?

[12:56] Is canators room are going to be right or will canators room are be wrong

[12:59] But you heard it here first and that is what I'm hearing

[13:02] Is we're going to get a throwback game pulp fiction system 11

[13:06] Single level game from mark richie

[13:09] All right that's kind of everything I know right now

[13:11] Now I know some more stuff but you know all in good time people all in good time

[13:16] I want to thank you on behalf of my family for being a member of the canada club

[13:20] I hope this stuff excites you

[13:22] I hope all of you hang out on my Facebook lives and I really mean it

[13:25] It means a lot I know that you're giving a little bit more than everybody else

[13:28] You're giving more than just your time

[13:30] You're giving some money to the show and I super duper appreciate it
