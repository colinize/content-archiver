[00:00] We broke into a million pieces and we can't go back, but now we're seeing all the beauty in the broken glass.

[00:08] The stars are part of me, darkness and harmony. My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like.

[00:15] CELESA CELESA CELESA CELESA CELESA CELESA

[00:20] Uh, welcome everybody to the world's pinball podcaster that is having a better week than a director of sales at Stern Pinball.

[00:30] Eric Gilley, man, I've heard some more stuff about this whole thing, so he's still over there at Stern Pinball

[00:36] and apparently Seth is about to bring in his own guide to run Stern Sales North America

[00:43] and they're asking John Buscaglia to move to Europe to run European sales

[00:49] and to try to create a market there. And John is Eric's boss, so I don't know man.

[00:55] Do we really feel like there's a lot more sales to be had of Stern machines in Europe,

[01:01] especially at those European prices when I hear from my friends overseas?

[01:06] I mean, how can you increase Stern sales in Europe and you don't even allow them to sell Star Wars in Europe?

[01:13] Now I'm hearing that Disney has yanked a lot of people's licensing ability to sell product in Europe.

[01:20] That's also the reason I'm hearing, other than the low demand, why predator can no longer be sold after December

[01:28] because Disney is removing the pinball brothers license and their ability to sell the predator product.

[01:35] So, lots of interesting stuff happening.

[01:38] This is going to be a big thing people because if Seth is bringing in his own company to handle Stern Sales,

[01:46] what does that mean for the future of Stern Pinball? What does that mean for the decision making that's going to happen over there?

[01:54] I think the problem happening at Stern is that they're not looking internally to solve this issue.

[02:02] I think they think they can find an outside consultancy or an outside firm that does sales

[02:10] and they think they're going to turn that on and all of a sudden they're going to ignite new demand for this product.

[02:18] But the answer is a lot easier than that. The answer is in the past.

[02:23] The answer is what made Stern as big as Stern is today.

[02:28] And I think they don't want to acknowledge a very simple thing about this hobby.

[02:35] There's only so much you can grow this hobby.

[02:40] And the only way to grow this hobby is to make amazing products.

[02:46] You're not going to get more Star Wars sales because you hire an outside third party sales company

[02:54] to shove this game down people's throats. It's not that simple.

[02:58] And they want to buy their way out of this hole. And what I mean by that is Stern actually thinks

[03:05] they're going to get more customers if they do more advertising and they spam more people on Facebook.

[03:14] It's not going to work. And I work on brands that are super, super big.

[03:21] And I work on brands that spend hundreds of millions of dollars.

[03:24] I just had a brief yesterday where the spend the media buy for this brand is 100 million dollars.

[03:32] Okay. But these are brands reaching hundreds of millions of customers.

[03:37] When you're just trying to reach like five to 10,000 potential new inbox buyers,

[03:43] it's not advertising that's going to make it work. It's word of mouth and earned media.

[03:51] More so earning the attention, earning the demand from the people that love this product.

[03:58] You know, and I don't think Stern quite gets that. You can't make a mediocre Star Wars and then spend

[04:05] a lot of money marketing it and expect a lot more of them to be sold. And the thing about

[04:12] bringing in an outside anybody, and I mean this, an outside anybody to help fix Stern Pimbal,

[04:18] they've already tried that. Seth comes from outside Pimbal. The new CMO comes from outside Pimbal.

[04:27] Why is it that all of these hires from outside Pimbal who have come in now and been part of

[04:35] these organizations for years have done such a poor job making the company successful? You know,

[04:43] it took the Abbott family a really long time to figure it out, but I think they finally figured

[04:48] it out, but it took them a long time and they didn't need to sell so many products to figure it out.

[04:56] And even with all the money and all the resources, they also learned that it's not like how much money

[05:02] you have. It's not how much money you spend. It's not how many Facebook ads you do. It ultimately

[05:09] comes down to how well do you know the community and the people that want to buy these products,

[05:15] and how well is the product itself? How well is the quality? How much fun is it? How awesome is the

[05:23] theme? What is the thing about this game that makes it special? Because so many people are out of

[05:30] room and you need to give them a very compelling reason why they should put your latest offering

[05:37] in the game room. So you want to hear something else? I heard that's really, really funny. The

[05:41] guy that Seth brought in to replace John Bruscaglia, I heard that this guy thinks that Stern should be

[05:49] able to sell a hundred million dollars in merchandise, in merchandise. These are the people

[05:56] that think that Stern is a lifestyle brand. These are the people that when you go on the Stern

[06:03] marketplace, who do you see wearing the product? Does it look like anybody that's had a pinball show?

[06:08] Does it look like anyone that's ever done an unboxing of a single pinball machine in their

[06:14] entire lives? These people are delusional. The only people making a hundred million dollars

[06:22] on merchandise sale are called Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, Demon Hunters. I just bought

[06:29] 400 bucks worth of Demon Hunter merchandise. Zach Bryant, you know, you're not going to make this

[06:34] kind of money. You're not a lifestyle brand. You are a pinball machine and of course we will buy

[06:42] t-shirts but here's the deal. They don't even make good t-shirts. The merchandise is crappy. It's not

[06:49] even like they're making great merch. All of it is so funny to me. It's like they're so lost.

[06:55] They're so lost and in one hour I pointed these guys in the right direction and they're just headed

[07:02] all over the place. I've seen this so many times. I've seen this time and time again. The only thing

[07:09] that's going to happen when Seth brings in all these outside people, they are going to destroy

[07:15] the culture of stern pinball. They are going to jam mediocre products down our throats and they are

[07:23] going to destroy the morale of the very people that made stern pinball. Great and I mean it.

[07:30] There's just one or two simple moves that would be the kill shot to stern for the community.

[07:36] If Keith Elwyn or Jack Danger left, that would just be like a kill shot. Like that would just

[07:44] telegraph that this company can't hold on to the very people that are really keeping this company

[07:52] in exciting entity because think about it. Like Brian Eddy and John Borg's games aren't lighting

[07:58] the world on fire. It's really Elwyn and Danger that have made the most exciting new games over

[08:05] the last five years. I think Keith's been around for about six years but those are the guys and

[08:09] man yeah. Obviously Elwyn, if he jumps ship, it's really not looking good. So that's the state of

[08:16] stern pinball these days people and even though we're not internal over there, I think we're

[08:22] feeling it as a community and I'm here to tell you right now some brand new news. We are 100%

[08:29] not going to see anything other than Star Wars at Pinball Expo 2025. There will not be the

[08:38] walking dead remastered. So when will stern release it? I think they're going to hold it till

[08:45] after the show. I would assume they want to get walking dead remastered out before Halloween

[08:51] but that's what I'm hearing. It will 100% not be at the show. Okay so nothing new and all we're

[09:00] going to get is mediocre Star Wars but hey we're also going to get Drinks with Jack on the stage

[09:06] at Pinball Expo Thursday at 3pm. He'll interview Brian Eddy, Elliott Eisman and Keith Elwyn and

[09:15] then at 5 o'clock George Gomez and then Friday at 3, Seth and Gary and then Saturday at 3pm,

[09:23] Zambietti, Chuck Ernest and Steve Martin. Okay cool cool here's the thing right now. I just don't

[09:31] care anymore to hear stern pinball interview itself. Think about that for a minute. Do you really

[09:37] want to hear stern pinball on its own panel moderated by its own people talk about what

[09:44] what are they really going to tell us the truth? Okay hey Seth are you bringing in an outside

[09:50] organization to help you sell games? Have you booted John Buscaglia to Europe? Why did Eric

[09:57] Gilley write that post about how this company was so much better off seven years ago and how eight

[10:04] years of hard work for nothing? Why did he write that? Why did your director of sales write that?

[10:08] What is happening over there? Why didn't you put all of your resources on Star Wars? Is there going

[10:15] to be a price increase with Spike 3? What will be in Spike 3? Why has the Spike 3 rollout been so

[10:21] sloppy? Why are you guys still still after all these years thinking you can raise prices when the

[10:27] demand for your product is soon going to be at the lowest it's been in a long time and you're not

[10:33] going to like sell more to Costco and get out of it that way nobody walks into Costco and just starts

[10:40] dropping five six thousand dollars on a game that's like the same price as almost every single Stern

[10:46] Pro that's ever been made used like if you know anything about pinball why would you buy that game?

[10:52] Gosh happy Friday everybody let's go hear stern interview itself about stern pinball no they need

[10:59] a great game they need a great game you know Seth comes from Disney look at Disney's moves lately

[11:06] look at Disney's moves the neutron movie is atrocious it's getting slammed left and right

[11:13] all the money all the talent that IP they continue to make horrible movies the soundtrack's probably

[11:20] the only good thing anything with Jared Lido in it is going to be terrible we know this culture

[11:24] knows this anything he's in people don't like he's not a good joker he's not a good this why do people

[11:29] keep casting this guy every time I see him at a movie premiere I'm like why this guy again we're

[11:35] back with this guy again he's cast a Skeletor in the new he-man movie I don't understand how this guy

[11:41] keeps getting these gigs is he bankable I don't get it so the new Tron movie flopped and now when I

[11:47] saw that I'm like well you know bringing back Tron right now wouldn't have had all this cultural

[11:52] hype because no one's talking about even the Tron movie but we do know the Tron pinball machine

[11:58] is much better than the new Tron movie and so what else is going on in the world of pinball

[12:03] I'm looking at pinball brothers right now people are getting their predator machines I think in

[12:08] total I heard this rumor they might only be making 200 before they have to stop making the game so

[12:14] this is going to be a very rare machine whether or not you want it I would jump on it I look forward

[12:21] to playing it I also want to say for the record and this is 100% the truth it was not the pinball

[12:29] brothers that sent a message to Rob Burke complaining about me being at expo I've said it wasn't them

[12:38] it isn't them they are going to be there they don't care that I'm gonna be there the predator machine

[12:44] will be there I think whoever sent this it reads more like pinball adventures than it does pinball

[12:52] brothers everybody else is gonna be there okay so I don't know you know maybe Rob just should not

[12:58] have sent me it and should have just found out who it was and said hey look like that's on you

[13:05] he's coming let's have a party baby speaking of predator pinball if you get your game take a look

[13:11] at the gap between the lockdown bar and the play field there's a bracket that gets bent during

[13:18] shipping so you're gonna see about a quarter inch gap between the play field and the lockdown bar

[13:23] you're gonna have to bend that bracket back it's an easy fix more concerning though is how the

[13:30] lockdown bar fits over the game go look at some people's games right now it is rubbing against

[13:38] the decals and it is causing those decals to scratch and wrinkle and so you're gonna get

[13:45] damage now that damage will be underneath the lockdown bar when it's closed but when you take

[13:51] it off you're gonna see some damage to your decals again not the best quality should have been caught

[13:58] earlier on but you know how pinball is everyone's just willing to be a guinea pig and accept quality

[14:04] issues left and right speaking of quality issues all these merlin's editions of cgcs medieval madness

[14:12] are going out i think they're around like 250 which means they're still gonna be making these games

[14:17] into early 2026 there's been like a mixed bag of quality issues with those games going out

[14:26] some people are having some issues some are not that's typically not cgcs thing normally their

[14:32] quality is top notch i don't even know who's over at cgc anymore i really don't i think doug runs the

[14:39] shop but other than that have any of us heard from anybody over at cgc i mean think about it have you

[14:45] ever seen like a facebook live from cgc hey i'm so-and-so the sales director at cgc hey eric gilly

[14:54] man maybe go over to cgc and be their sales director i don't know like i don't hear from anybody over

[15:00] there they are the weirdest company in my honest opinion when they get something out it's usually

[15:06] high quality it takes forever but for a lot of you out there the weight is worth it okay no walking

[15:14] dead anything happening in the harry potter world i mean i feel like potter just keeps going out

[15:19] let's see how the pinball marketplace is going right now and let's ask ourselves is this worth

[15:24] the money or not you know me i like to look for games that are 12 000 or more like what's collectible

[15:30] because we're about to get beetle juice which i think is going to shoot up to 15 000 or more

[15:36] instantly if we look at evil deads have gone up to 15 k and it's beetle juice a much more popular

[15:44] theme i think beetle juice is going to be i'm just saying it i think it's going to go all the way up to

[15:49] 18 so here's some interesting games we have at a high price there's an elton john c e which was

[15:56] originally 15 is now 13 000 firm so what do i think about that well i think with harry potter out

[16:07] and with sonic the hedgehog richie's next game pretty much confirmed i think that's a theme a lot

[16:14] more people are going to want i think elton john c e originally 15 is now closer to really in 11 000

[16:26] to 11 5 game if you want to ask firm you're not going to get 13 i don't think anybody's like

[16:32] needs it that badly and i just don't think $2 000 off is enough all i think people are looking for

[16:39] better deals than that uh there is a harry potter's collectors edition i think it's like the first one

[16:44] i've seen for sale it's a routed game though with a dollar bill acceptor on it 14 000 firm okay so

[16:53] that's $1 000 off but is it a routed game i think it is because i see an exit sign of where this game

[17:02] is um i don't think anybody would want to rout it harry potter for just a thousand off i think once

[17:08] your game's been routed you got to take off some more money than that a medieval madness merlin

[17:14] edition for 14 000 or best offer get out of here you're not going to be able to flip these games

[17:19] there's too many of them they're going to make over a thousand of them and you know i know it's in a

[17:24] box and you can have it today i just don't think anybody anybody wants it here's a game that i thought

[17:30] was well bought a hep restored edition of twilight zone for 15 5 i think this was a great buy let me

[17:38] explain why there are not many hep twilight zones out there they make this game better than it ever

[17:44] was new every single component is cleaned everything is like silver plated or like chrome plated it's

[17:52] just gorgeous it has every mod you want for this game installed that are hard to find these days

[17:58] i would much rather have bought this because think about it it's a lot harder to find a

[18:03] hep restored twilight zone than a harry potter c e than a star wars le so you know when you think

[18:10] about it now like yeah hep games at 15 5 used to sound like insanely priced but now mass produced

[18:18] games are the same price and so i absolutely think this was well bought a wizard of os yellow brick

[18:26] road le for 13 000 or best offer not happening nowhere close that for wizard of os the problem

[18:33] with was beautiful game just doesn't shoot well so you can have a beautiful museum piece but i just

[18:39] think uh jersey jack's future is going to make games that are a lot more fun to play than wizard of

[18:45] os is to play el virus house of horrors man 40th anniversary edition i remember when these games

[18:54] were selling for 25 000 when they first came out 12 000 firm that is insane people legit paid 25

[19:07] 000 for these games when it first came out 12 000 firm uh i actually think it's not a bad buy

[19:13] i'd much rather have el virus 40th for 12 then star wars le for 13 it's a much better game

[19:22] the code is much better and overall the package it's still a beautiful game i mean

[19:27] this is one of the most beautiful games and it's got christopher franci on artwork and i mean it

[19:32] franci's stern machines are so beautiful after all these years a deadpool le for 12 5

[19:41] i don't know maybe maybe it's uh it's hard to tell right it's hard to tell i just don't know man i feel

[19:48] like deadpool you don't really hear about it much anymore i don't know i wouldn't really go for it

[19:54] and this is what i don't understand there is an el virus house of horrors le this is an le which is

[20:00] not as nice as the 40th and he wants 13 5 firm like what's wrong with people i don't get it there's

[20:08] like the nicer edition of the game is selling for 12 and you want 13 5 for the lesser edition

[20:16] Jurassic park le for 12 i wouldn't go near that elton john c e 12 5 or best offer jaws le

[20:26] 12 5 or best offers even jaws le's are now losing money i thought they were going to hold and you

[20:32] know why the jaws le's are going down a little bit uh it's because of the 50th anniversary i mean it's

[20:38] just that simple i feel like people are really loving the 50th it's $9700 and you know are you

[20:45] having any more fun if you're playing jaws le than the 50th and you could save $3,000

[20:53] pirate to the carabin man these games are always for sale there's always like three or four pirate

[20:58] machines for sale uh $25,500 i don't know i just don't think anyone cares anymore if you own a

[21:06] pirate because they're always for sale a tales of the arabian knights this thing is so gorgeous

[21:12] hepre stored 16 5 i mean absolutely if i was tempted to spend around 15 k i'd be looking at

[21:21] this game um it is absolutely stunning the only problem is and again it's a beautiful beautiful

[21:28] machine the only problem with owning a totin and everyone knows it is it just gets boring because

[21:35] it's so easy like you could legit beat it in like a half hour and you know there's not much else to

[21:42] do it is very very easy to get to the end of that game time and time again all right i'm trying to

[21:48] find some other stuff even godzilla le's 12 five with mods that's losing money d and d le in a box

[21:56] for 12 three firm you can't you can't say any d and d is firm i mean if you have a d and d le you

[22:03] are not firm here's a sale pending on an attack from mars le for 14 five wow well you don't see

[22:10] those come up very often that's why i mean some of these other games they come up all the time a big

[22:16] bang bar remake for $28,000 i mean here we are that's never happening with the remake which is

[22:23] absolutely coming oh look at this baby look at this baby brand new pirate to the caribbean c e no games

[22:31] have been played on this machine but it has been removed from the box and placed in the game room

[22:37] why would you do that why would you do that this dude in california el tizel takes it out of the box

[22:47] and says he's never played a game $40,000 he wants for this game you have to have your head examined

[22:56] because here's the problem if you spend $40,000 on this game because it's never been played

[23:04] what happens the moment you play it that first plunge you're losing $10,000 because a played

[23:11] pirate to the caribbean c e is no more than $30,000 but he does have all the leor mods so i don't know

[23:18] maybe that's why he wants so much money getting funny people it really is getting funny here's a

[23:25] lord of the rings that's not even in le this is crazy not even in le he wants $12,000 for a non le

[23:37] lord of the rings what are we doing here avatar the battle for pandora c e 14,000 or best offer

[23:45] him all these games another avatar c e 13 5 tron le 16 5 yeah i'm just gonna stop right i'm gonna

[23:55] stop because what's funny about it all is you can see you can see the delusion is still it's still

[24:01] here everybody's become delusional this hobby hasn't grown over the last three years it's shrunk

[24:09] and the boutique companies are about to eat stern's lunch beetle juice is about to change the game

[24:15] it's gonna be an awesome three months because there is going to be the changing of the guard

[24:20] and everybody else that's holding on to these covet prices and these covet strategies they're

[24:27] gonna lose and i think the enthusiasm and the excitement is gonna only happen when we get games

[24:34] like beetle juice nobody wants to buy your used game for these prices anymore it's over because

[24:41] there's no flex anymore there's no oh i got one of those alvira le's nobody cares oh i have a Jurassic

[24:47] park le nobody cares i have a jaws le nobody cares anymore because they just keep remaking them and

[24:54] remaking them and you know nobody cares if you if you buy a 40 000 dollar prior to the care of bnc

[24:59] like nobody cares it sucks but that's the new state of pimbab the entire collector base there's

[25:06] no flexing anywhere anymore nowhere and i think beetle juice will bring back the fomo and sell

[25:12] out instantly and yeah that will be a game that everyone's gonna want to get their hands on as

[25:18] all these guys are trying to sell these old stern le's out their back doors for like 14 5 obo no try

[25:25] 11 now try 11 all right the days are over gang you're not gonna get close to 15 14 000 dollars for

[25:32] these mass produced games happy friday everybody canada out see you at expo next week

[25:42] can't help but let the jagged edges meet the light is that show me what's underneath

[25:48] i'll find your harmony feel this is not to find this is what it sounds like
