[00:00] First Prime.

[00:03] Then Ultra Magnus.

[00:05] And now you...

[00:08] It's a pity you Autobots die so easily.

[00:11] Where I might have a sense of satisfaction now.

[00:18] You got the time!

[00:22] You got the time!

[00:23] The Rides not in the sky.

[00:26] Optimus.

[00:29] Yeah!

[00:30] No!

[00:31] Sincere, sincere, sincere, sincere, sincere, sincere, sincere!

[00:35] Welcome to Episode 327 of Canatus Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast who had its fact checker quit two weeks ago.

[00:44] So on this episode, we're gonna talk to Pinside.

[00:48] I believe he goes by the name of Dr. Frightner. His name is Larry in real life.

[00:52] And I talked to him about a week ago about themes and pinball games.

[00:56] And what we thought were the best themes for pinball machines that have not been utilized so far.

[01:02] And I think you're gonna be shocked about one of the themes that Larry thinks would be a terrible theme in pinball.

[01:08] Now, look, before I do that, I wanna talk about a couple things.

[01:11] I wanna read some of the stuff, some of the fallout from yesterday.

[01:15] And the rumors that I talked about on some previous shows that you know have been deleted.

[01:22] As I said, look, this shit annoys me to no end.

[01:25] And if it turns out that the second rumor I talked about is fake, I'm telling you, I'm just gonna reveal to you who told me this information.

[01:33] Because I got all this information from the same person.

[01:36] And they were adamant that it was accurate. And they said to me 100%. It is true.

[01:42] And now here's what I'm hearing. And again, I'm totally gonna be transparent with you, the listener of the show.

[01:47] I am now hearing that it might not be CGC, that it's probably, I don't know, it's gonna be someone else.

[01:53] And so that begs the question, is it American pinball?

[01:56] We know that they said they were ramping up to a larger facility that would be able to contract, manufacture the games.

[02:02] But I'm done with these two fucking rumors. I'm sorry. I take it for what it's worth.

[02:08] But the person is still saying adamantly that alien pinball will be coming out, made in America in a wide body.

[02:16] And so that is what they are still sticking to. And I know I said I would stop the show and get a name of Hilton Tatutamah but if that turned out to be false.

[02:28] Now remember that alien, alien still has not proven to not be shipped or released or manufactured in the United States.

[02:36] So until that happens, we'll see, we'll see about those other things. All right.

[02:41] Now look, I woke up this morning, a lot of passionate people chiming in saying all these mean nasty things about Canada.

[02:48] And look, I want to read something that someone wrote like 53 minutes ago.

[02:52] It goes, this is from solar value on Pinside. He writes, it almost seems as though some people who work for any of the pinball companies whose secrets Canada has threatened to reveal decided to invent some false information to feed Canada.

[03:07] Perhaps this is a way to get a little bit of revenge and also to ensure that if he does reveal their secrets, his credibility will be tarnished to the point that the community is less likely to believe the real news if so brilliant plan.

[03:21] Well, solar value, it was not a consortium of people conspiring against me.

[03:27] This was information from one person that I trusted who is very vocal and very popular on Pinside and I trusted his information and I took his word for it at face value. That is all this is. This wasn't some huge conspiracy.

[03:42] And so I have all the text messages where I was asking, hey, can you make sure this is 100% and then even afterwards I was like, man, what's going on? Like people are saying this is not accurate and it's still, I'm still getting that alien will be coming back 100% guaranteed.

[03:59] So again, it wasn't a whole bunch of people. I love Mitch from Wellesley on Terry O he writes simple solution stop listening to the spoil Bratz podcast.

[04:10] Alright, well guys, if you don't want to listen no more, that's cool. There are about 35 other pinball podcasts out there and you can happily stop tuning into Canada's and you can listen to so many other options.

[04:23] There are there you do not have a shortage of pinball podcasts. Alright, so one thing I want to talk about before I air this interview with Larry is Larry is one of the most passionate guys I've ever talked to and pinball and this morning I woke up to Larry once again because I read a thread on Pinside where he's just like, can he has been bowling Jersey Jack pinball and he doesn't understand.

[04:43] Jersey Jack pinball deserves more respect and more credit and the game he kept going back to was dialed in he kept saying you need to stop talking shit about dialed in it is the most successful original IP game since the Valley Williams days.

[05:00] And if you think about that for a minute is dialed in the most successful original IP game since the Valley Williams days and the answer is yes in terms of volume and this is the thing I was trying to tell to Larry you can't look at volume and then consider a game a success you have to look at how successful was that game for the company.

[05:24] Okay, what were Jersey Jack's sales goals for dialed in I would bet if I was a betting man that they were expecting to sell far more dialed in than they actually sold and here's the problem with all of this it's really hard to understand how many games actually sold so Jack told us that dialed in sold around 1500 units.

[05:46] Now do you believe Jersey Jack who do you believe right these aren't publicly traded companies where the information is out there I would say though if you were to ask me if you were to say canada what is the most successful original IP game since the Valley Williams days I would not say it's dialed in I think the game that actually blew expectations away I think the game that exceeded what people were expecting from it I think a game that exceeded the sales goals of the game.

[06:16] And I would consider this to be the most successful original IP game since the Valley Williams error I think it's total nuclear annihilation by Scott and E.C. and I think there here's why I think that I think it exceeded its sales goals I think people love the game I think Scott and E.C. being a rookie designer coming out of nowhere and creating a game that went on to become spooky pinballs number one selling game of all time is far more impressive to me.

[06:46] Then Pat Lawler who is the most heralded pinball designer of all time is the man behind the greatest selling pinball machine ever in Adam's family his return to pinball any only manages to sell 1500 games.

[07:02] I mean how do you not look at that as a failure and the other part is this is Wizard of Oz sold four to 5000 units the hobbit sold at least 2000 units.

[07:13] So dialed in is still the still you know until we see how many pirate cells it's still the worst selling of the first three offerings from Jersey Jack pinball and the other thing I was talking to Larry about is why like why to dialed in become that and you know look we do harp on theme and we're going to talk all about them on this podcast but if you have to ask me why I think that dialed in the theme didn't help it but the thing that really hurts dialed in and this is what I told Larry.

[07:42] The thing that really hurts dialed in is not just the theme it's the it's the implementation of the theme it's how the theme is brought to life in the pinball experience we love so many games from the 90s that are original IP games look at medieval madness for example like look at monster bash but medieval madness is a great one to look at it's it's an original theme right the reason why we love medieval madness is the game is filled with one theme.

[08:11] One thing it has it in space it has personality the game has so much personality and it's so much fun to play because of that personality and yes it has all the mechanisms yes it has the rewarding shots and yes it's an original theme and yes I would argue that medieval madness and dragons and castles and trolls are much better for pinball then a guy with a cell phone and a subway station and a quantum theater and drones all right okay but we're dialed in failed.

[08:41] Is the is the integration of personality in the game and to me that is why it didn't become a a success like a huge hit again Pat Lawler's return with a Jersey Jack pin in a standard body game all the things were lined up to be incredibly successful and I think that number of sales is is where it's at because the game just lacks personality and it's sort of numb and sterile to play the game and that's my opinion now look I think you're going to see

[09:10] I think you're going to see when you get a standard body Willy Wonka game with all the personality from the Willy Wonka films in that package from Pat Lawler design let's see how well Willy Wonka sales are next to dialed in I'm going to go out on a limb and say I bet the sales are two to three times greater than the sales of dialed in without a doubt and I know we're all looking forward to seeing that game and I hear we're going to have Jack give a teaser video of it at tpf.

[09:39] All right what else is going on that's pretty much it I hope you enjoy this if you have any questions or feedback email me even if you like you know if you're upset if you want to just air your grievances out I'm happy to hear from everybody you know it's hard on this show and I have to be honest I'm just one guy with with a headset on doing a podcast for your entertainment every week and I get about you know close to 2000 people listen to every episode and then you go on pin side and there's like 30 guys that are just complaining about me.

[10:09] All the time and you know what it's easy for me to read that stuff and be like well maybe I should just hang it up you know I'm looking at Brenda right now and she's always like dude what why would you hang it up there's like 1900 and 70 dudes out there who really enjoy it so I'm not going to rob you who enjoy this show simply because there's some people out there that just think I'm an asshole and I bet if you met me in person and many of you will at tpf this weekend I bet you will see that that spoil brat psycho fan asshole who's just a jerk

[10:38] who lied to the whole community that not that is not really the case alright so everyone enjoy this interview

[10:45] canate at pinball edgmail.com and thank you everyone who donates to the show on patreon I really appreciate it and I'll see you guys in Texas no more shows

[10:53] until I get down to Texas later all right ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome to canate his pinball podcast a special guest Larry who is a pinball fan

[11:03] but also a man who has an interesting job for living Larry what do you do for living well I own

[11:10] escape rooms haunted houses in fact the world's biggest Halloween haunted house shows next weekend

[11:18] so that's coming up but I also build attractions and design attractions and I worked for everybody from

[11:25] universal studios, sea world, bush gardens I mean like amusement parks all of the world I even built a

[11:32] was kind of a dream job I built a there's only two dark rides ever built based on spider-man I built one of them

[11:39] the other ones in universal studios so I've done quite a bit of stuff what an interesting dark rides

[11:46] mini golf all kinds of stuff so I come from a little bit big different background than most

[11:52] and as I was telling you before I go to all the same trade shows as a stern and jersey jack and

[11:59] I was the one who put the first video up of the Beatles because I was my booth was right down the aisle from the stern

[12:07] did they make you yank it down now all right I mean anybody could have done it I mean like when when I was

[12:13] there at the show they didn't even have code on the game I mean they were literally putting the code

[12:19] on the night before the trade show so Larry you're in the pinball and I know on pinside your doctor

[12:26] right now and and for for this show what I want to do is I want to talk about sort of what's

[12:32] your overall feeling of where pinball is right now as a hobby right and you're not a tournament player

[12:37] right you're more of a buyer collector right exactly but I have a lot of friends who are tournament

[12:42] players and I think that people buy pinballs for different reasons and people like them for different

[12:47] reasons so when you talk to somebody who's a tournament only player I mean they like a game

[12:54] and they don't like a game based on different variables and so I think that this hobby

[13:01] in industry has totally different types of people who buy them right absolutely absolutely so

[13:08] what what kind of pinball buyer would you consider yourself to be well you know it's really funny

[13:13] because I got into this like I had pinballs I mean I used to buy them back when they were like

[13:18] 800 to a thousand dollars and the ones that I bought back then were the ones that interested me the

[13:25] most the ones like creature from the black lagoon Dracula Adams family things like that that were

[13:32] the horror based and I had those games forever tells from the crypt and didn't do anything with them

[13:37] and I met this guy who was living here not far from me here in St. Louis and then I just started

[13:44] buying them like crazy and then I acquired I went from having like four to like having 34

[13:52] in a short period of time and then after I got to like that many I started realizing wait a minute

[13:57] why did I buy Star Trek next generation because I don't like Star Trek you know right and so

[14:03] then I started to figure out like I really just want to buy games where I like the theme and I like

[14:09] the detail of the game because all the games that I have I've taken extensive to process of

[14:17] restoring them powder coating them putting mods on them color screens and making them look

[14:22] collector type okay right and so that's kind of where I'm in that's why I like the Beatles because

[14:28] I think they actually did a really good job of making the games seem like it was a pinball right

[14:33] out of the 50s so how many games do you have now in your collection like 30 2 or 3 okay

[14:41] and what was the last new inbox game you bought monsters at Lee did it did it arrive yeah I already

[14:50] got it okay and so are you primarily in your collection now you got 90s you got stirring games

[14:56] you got a little bit of everything yeah and every old game I have is totally restored powder coated

[15:02] mods color screen the whole nine yearns everyone okay you know I've seen layers collection I mean

[15:08] it's it's really nice I mean these are they are collector quality games you mod them up they look

[15:13] they look beautiful so for for the show today I know you wanted to talk about what themes you think

[15:21] are missing from the pinball world you know there's a lot that has been done but what do you think

[15:27] hasn't been done that you think would be a hit seller in pinball and I'm going to play the role of

[15:33] marketing guy at pinball company I want you to pitch me on one you think would be great and I'll

[15:39] say if I think that I agree or if I think they wouldn't sell very well how's that sound yeah you

[15:45] know it's very interesting because I posted a post because there's a thread on ten side about

[15:50] Jersey Jack is it the next game will he walk on it's kind of morphed into this whole other thing

[15:57] and you know and I put up a really interesting post about Jersey Jack because obviously that would

[16:01] be my favorite pinball company but I do understand the problems there being from somebody who manufactures

[16:09] and gets things done and has deadlines I understand it very well but you know I I think that there's

[16:19] a lot of games a lot of themes that would fit for a lot of different people okay so you have your

[16:25] companies that are small and then you have your companies like Stern yeah look but a theme is a

[16:30] theme is a theme I mean I think a hit theme is a hit theme no matter who has it right so we obviously

[16:36] would like to see a big theme be done by a company that will do it justice but irregardless of that

[16:44] talk to me sell me you walk into my room right now and I'm like Gary Stern or I'm Jersey Jack

[16:50] just assume I'm a pinball manufacturer that will do a theme justice go down a list

[16:55] and we'll do one at a time tell me what games you think would make for a great pinball machine

[17:01] going into 2019 and beyond yeah and one of the things I would tell them is you know when I was a kid

[17:08] everybody was 40 to 60 wanted a 57 Chevy okay you know now nobody wants a 57 Chevy you know what's

[17:15] old is new again because like when you get to 45 50 60 years old you want the toys from when you

[17:21] were a kid and people grew up on Pac-Man Donkey Kong people who are between 45 and 60 and I think

[17:28] that that's where the sweet spot is that's where the themes are and that's why for example I don't

[17:33] think back to the future would be a good theme because I don't think the movie survived well oh my

[17:38] god Larry Larry you're out of your mind if you think back to the future would not crash it absolutely

[17:44] nine absolutely let me tell you something let me tell you something as someone who recently launched

[17:50] the Pepsi perfect product the enthusiasm for those movies is astronomical like like nothing I've

[17:58] ever seen in terms of people of all ages dressing up like Marty McFly it's a generational film okay

[18:05] so I'm already getting worried Larry that if you think back to the future is bad I'm terrified

[18:11] what do you think is great so I just don't think people my age would be care that much about

[18:16] back to the future because how old are you though if you're gonna how are you 49 49 okay 49

[18:24] oh so here let me give you all right let's let's one at a time like this this should be

[18:28] happy hard every time I want you to just do one at a time and I want you to start with a game I

[18:34] don't want a story I don't want a back story of when you were a kid and old Chevy's I'll just

[18:39] what's number one I'll tell you number one I think that everybody should consider doing is

[18:45] and I talked to Chicago gaming because we were having a conversation I don't have a family

[18:53] but base it on the TV show or the movies and it's not a game that I think should be remade I

[18:59] think it's a game that should have a part two okay I think people don't crazy I just have to

[19:06] like process what you just said you you walk in and you're gonna pitch me that the first game

[19:11] that should be made is the best selling pinball machine of all time yeah but when you go back and

[19:16] you think about the original Adams family there's no you know the technology wasn't there to show

[19:22] the clips like the monsters okay so it's the best selling pinball of all time and it doesn't show

[19:27] any of the clips from the movies or anything like that so obviously that's a game that you could

[19:33] totally redo okay so I would okay I'm gonna I'm gonna what's we're gonna go type our title so I

[19:40] would say if there's one game that the the world does not need more of it is the game that there is

[19:46] the most of in the world which is Adams family and I would also say that the reason why people

[19:51] love Adams family so much it's not about the lack of clips I just think the game has everything

[19:57] people want from a mechanical standpoint from a layout from a you know shot geometry I would say

[20:04] Adams family isn't necessarily where I would start so what what else what's next on your list three

[20:10] stewdges so you think the three stewdges would outsell back to the future absolutely the three

[20:17] stewdges is something that transcends generations I can just hear my listeners like screaming at their

[20:24] speakers right now at three stewdges would make an amazing okay so what age group does that appeal to

[20:33] I think three stewdges appeals to everybody there's nobody fathers watch that with their kids I

[20:40] mean it's like transcendent it's still rebranding it's like a oh yeah you can watch three stewdges all day

[20:46] alone three stewdges are funny but I think that parents today when they're watching content with

[20:52] their kids are watching the three stewdges I have a T-vote on my TV and I know I mean there's

[21:01] people I mean across the world still watch the three stewdges today okay so I'm gonna assume

[21:08] that any generation I'm gonna I'm gonna assume your data is a focus group of one and okay so three

[21:14] stewdges all right okay what's next because I I also think that that would be a a sales disaster

[21:24] I would disagree I'll tell you three and I'll take any one of the three and they're all in the

[21:29] same vein caddy shack blues brothers are animal house all right well look I like all of those

[21:36] better than your first two caddy shack animal house and what was the third one blues brothers okay

[21:43] all right now now I think we're talking a little bit better I think I'll I'll tell you why because all

[21:50] of those are classic movies they're comedies they have they're I think they've been passed down

[21:59] over the generations I think people still watch them out of the three of those which one do you

[22:04] think would be the best selling probably if I ranked them it'd be tough because you got caddy

[22:12] shack in animal house but I can see Bluto right now going food fight and then a multi ball starts

[22:19] probably animal house okay oh man I would I would say I would probably go with caddy shack just

[22:28] because I think there's a lot of people who are also you know goffers love the movie it's one

[22:35] of Chevy Chase's greatest movies you got Bill Murray in it it's I no good goffers was based on

[22:41] caddy shack correct I mean I don't think it's that great of a game but okay so all right that's

[22:47] why I picked animal house by the way because it's not been intended at all on any level right so okay so

[22:54] all right those are those are like I would put those in like more of a a B range of themes that

[22:58] have not yet been made so what what else you got the godfather they did some pranos but there's

[23:05] nothing bigger than the godfather but isn't that like a slow drama like how do you make godfather

[23:10] into pinball well I mean it is the one of the biggest movie franchises in history it's never been

[23:18] done I think there's a lot of godfather fans I'm actually thinking about it from the standpoint of

[23:23] theming and selling it right but so is gone with the wind yeah you're that's the number one movie

[23:31] of all time I mean would like Lawrence of Arabia I mean I just think there's I think for pinball

[23:37] to work though I think you need a movie that has some pace to it I think it needs some humor I think

[23:42] it needs some energy and I think godfather while a very good movie I think would translate pretty

[23:49] poorly into pinball okay what else you got planted out the apes the tim Burton or the original

[23:56] troughts original the original okay it's very retro uh Stern's been doing a lot of retro stuff

[24:04] it's never been done I think it would be great uh I mean I grew up on plan of the apes I mean it

[24:10] was created by the same person who created Twilight Zone I do I do again another classic movie we are

[24:17] definitely getting to wait it's got to be what like early 70s that film late 60s well they the

[24:22] first one was 68 okay but there is like like there's like the apes there's like ten of them there's

[24:29] like fanclubs where people just do nothing but dress up like the the apes right I mean it's still a

[24:35] huge huge deal for people that's the only way that Andrew highway can get back into expose if he

[24:41] dresses up like that we'll never see him coming you know a pinball that's never been done which would

[24:49] really relate our movie that's never been done that I think would make a great pinball would be

[24:54] Min and Black that would really really good to pinball look I mean okay so I think the first movie

[25:01] is fun I would say that Min and Black as a franchise it it probably hasn't carried over now I'll

[25:08] I'll tell you why because I think Will Smith as an actor he went from being a darling actor that

[25:14] people loved very much like Johnny Depp I feel like both of them their careers kind of just fell off

[25:19] and people's enthusiasm for them sort of fell off and doesn't take anything away from

[25:25] Min and Black being a great movie I'm just not sure that people are as enthusiastic about that

[25:33] but it would make for a fun pinball experience but I do think there are better films

[25:39] than Min and Black if I were to make a game today because here's the thing too Larry's like you

[25:42] have to think these games would be released in 2019 and Min and Black if I had to choose a movie

[25:49] Min and Black is what like early 90s like mid 90s I think they're just right right and there's

[25:58] also what three of them are ready or two of them and I think you'd be three yeah so you'd kind of like

[26:04] you know do you make one based on all them so I would put Min and Black on the shelf I don't think

[26:09] it would be like again I still think like man everybody wants back to the future okay what else

[26:14] is on the list let me throw you a curveball yeah how about Greece I actually I actually think

[26:21] Greece would be really cool and and I'll tell you why it's we we haven't really had a musical

[26:28] made into a pinball machine and I do think if you ask me the untapped kind of pinball machine

[26:35] that would do well it would be something based on a very popular musical franchise and I think

[26:40] Greece is is sort of does both of that right so I you know every woman I know every wife out there

[26:48] I know loves Greece and and and every guy for the most part enjoys the movie too so I think it's

[26:56] I think Greece would be really freaking cool how about this one's an obvious and I don't even know

[27:02] why it hasn't been done faster and furious right well and then that's just a no brainer you know

[27:09] it's interesting because I think fast and furious is a juggernaut of a franchise you know it's

[27:15] a billion dollar a movie now franchise but here's the thing here's why I don't think it would be

[27:20] good for pinball I don't think it connects with the older pinball demo and I also you know I don't

[27:29] think it's it's weird to me but like car culture even though a lot of pinball guys are also in the

[27:34] cars I don't think cars as a theme has ever translated very well into pinball and like Corvette and

[27:43] Viper and Mustang and the fast and furious franchise I think it's very limiting what you can do in

[27:49] the pinball game because I think when it comes to cars right and driving fast I'd much rather have

[27:56] that be a video game experience versus a pinball experience I just think the pinball medium and

[28:02] driving fast just doesn't go that well together well obvious another one that everybody screams

[28:09] about is matrix I think that would make a great pinball game see now we're talking you walk into my

[28:14] office Larry and you say Chris we should make the matrix and I say fuck yeah we should like

[28:21] absolutely the matrix is so cool the I know we only got maybe six or seven of those guys

[28:28] reskin the Johnny Newmonic game but that is one of the most immersive and just totally cool sci-fi

[28:35] movies of all time and I think it would be a juggernaut hit in the world of pinball I'll tell you

[28:43] another one that I think would be great just because the theme of the movie is mission impossible

[28:52] there's a lot of because you have to you have to hit certain shots to solve things and I just

[28:57] think that would make a great pinball game the problem is there's so many of them it we're on like

[29:03] the eighth with Ethan Hunt and Tom Cruise right so here's here's my question for you would you

[29:10] want to make it like an original narrative starring you know Ethan Hunt and and and the MI6 crew

[29:19] or you know how do you do it right because there's just so many movies to pull from I think James

[29:24] Bond to me has the same problem it's just it's based across so many years that I think it would

[29:32] just be difficult to make it cohesive within one pinball machine well I mean you bring up a great

[29:38] point because James Bond has never really been done correctly as a pinball and there's a lot of

[29:43] material to work there like you have so many different James Bones it's like how do you do it

[29:48] let me ask your question what do you think of this of things like signfold friends and things

[29:56] like that or Saturday Night Live doing a pinball based on certain alike if you can do monsters and

[30:02] games like that do you think those would work no no you don't think people would want that game no

[30:10] no I mean no no like and I think that there are popular TV shows that would make a great pinball

[30:19] experience I don't want like a sitcom pinball machine again because I just think it's just so

[30:26] you're not a fan of monsters it's a monster was two seasons of just hilarity and same thing with

[30:34] Batman 66 it was just three seasons but if you look at the subject matter of the monsters it

[30:41] you know it's very much similar to Adam's family and Batman and Robin is just an iconic thing

[30:46] but look I get there's a lot of iconic scenes in signfold but I just I just can't see people

[30:56] flipping a pinball machine to then get through like storylines of signfeld

[31:02] do you think people I guess the the pinball everybody would want is a Harry Potter obviously that's

[31:10] one that hasn't been done but I wouldn't want it if Stern did it I would only want it if Jersey Jack did

[31:16] right so I keep hearing that the person who has the option to make the game is neither one of them

[31:23] and I also think that is a challenging pinball game to make again because there's what like eight

[31:31] eight or nine movies where do you begin I kind of think they would need to make a Harry Potter pinball

[31:40] machine I don't know it just be challenging and be I mean if there's anyone who could do it justice

[31:46] it would be Jersey Jack that game would be the deepest code of all time but okay so Harry Potter yes

[31:53] that's just that's just like in that's like in the supernal realm of just things we could wish about

[31:59] like jaws for example yeah jaws would be cool I will tell you though and you know we could move on

[32:07] to music pins but of all the pinballs and I would probably buy it would either be catashacar

[32:13] animal house okay those would be the two that I would love to see and I would buy in a second

[32:19] because and I when I play the monsters I don't really feel like there's anything different about

[32:24] it than any other certain game but the one thing that really makes you laugh is like when you lose

[32:29] the game some permanent does something funny and you laugh and I don't think there's anything wrong with

[32:36] you know having a laugh playing pinball and making you remember when you were 15 years old

[32:42] right all right let me ask you some themes because if we look at and again we're talking about

[32:48] what do we think is going to sell the best and if we look at all the recent themes that

[32:53] Stern has put out there the best selling game in the recent few years for Stern is definitely

[33:01] Ghostbusters and so I'm looking at the 80s as being a real sweet spot for pinball that is very

[33:09] untapped in terms of modern games based on themes from the 80s so back to the future right so back

[33:17] to the future which you dismiss I think would be beyond big I think it would actually outsell Ghostbusters

[33:23] what about Ferris Bueller's Day off well you know that's just one of those sweet sweet sweet

[33:30] sweet 16 breakfast club type of movies and I don't know that there's so many of them okay and to

[33:39] me they're not bigger than Caddy Shacker Animal House or Blues Brothers I mean or even like a movie

[33:45] like Airplane okay so I wouldn't I wouldn't do Ferris Bueller over those themes right well there's

[33:53] data the I mean look there is there is data the backup whether or not Ferris Bueller's earned more

[34:00] at the box office or had a larger following and and stuff like that and we could even check to see

[34:05] how often these games or these movies are streams now with with current technology so I you know

[34:11] again but I think you you bring up a good point and this is the hard part right is you got to

[34:17] remove yourself from the equation of whether or not I think this pin would sell right and so

[34:23] that's the challenging part I think for a lot of these pinball companies is they need to do the

[34:28] market research to know hey if I make a game based on this will this align with not just the pinball

[34:35] buying public but will it bring in new people to pinball because it's a dream theme so let me let

[34:41] me throw out a few more of them the first terminator I just don't think anybody the you know what

[34:51] I was listening to your podcast you were talking about pirates of the Caribbean and whatever actually

[34:56] that franchise is one of Disney's biggest ever you're talking about over ten billion dollars

[35:02] that franchise is generated even though the last movie didn't do it very good it did really good

[35:07] overseas still so pinball is like when when when stern made iron maiden they didn't necessarily make

[35:13] it for United States you know it's like Europe too but at the end of the day there's certain movies

[35:20] you take like a movie like smoking the bandit right it's one of the highest grossing movies of all

[35:26] time people don't realize that when you adjusted for box office but catty shack did not do very well

[35:32] fairest buller didn't do very well they became called classics and so what matters is how they've

[35:37] lasted over time and catty shack I think in most people's world is either the first second or third

[35:44] best comedy in history in another good one is blazing saddles but I don't think you get away with that one

[35:50] right I'm I'm googling smoking the bandit box office gross because I have a hard time believing

[35:58] it's one of the highest coasting movies of all time hold out a second Larry it is right now

[36:05] let's see smoking the bandit it was second to star wars okay it came up the same year as star wars

[36:11] 1977 right all right box office mojo domestic total gross

[36:18] for you know 1977 it made a hundred and twenty six million dollars

[36:24] yeah and it was released piecemeal not like today right so all time okay this is adjusted all time

[36:33] adjusted 513 million it is the 75th most popular movie of all time based on adjustment okay so that

[36:43] that's that's good to know we've validated your opinions with some real data so okay let me

[36:49] throw out a few more and then I think we'll keep talking about again these are all exciting themes

[36:53] what about die hard you know die hard I think would make a good timball game but like when you think

[37:00] about the theme I mean like I mean you gotta kill the terror is it's perfect you you be kai

[37:06] mother fucker like the knock at home me plaza yeah you know just they haven't made you know when

[37:12] they've come out with a few movie since you know they haven't done very well I don't know I think

[37:17] I'd rather see a rambo than a die hard well just make it I would just make it the first die

[37:21] hard just die hard one it is like it's a Christmas movie it's got the most iconic lines John McLean I

[37:28] think it would be perfect and it's it's the perfect storyline for pinball so you were saying what was

[37:33] the one you just mentioned rambo absolutely so rambo one right yeah and they got another rambo movie

[37:41] coming out this year yeah the last one was bad ass I mean if you haven't seen the last rambo

[37:46] movie that still loaned it like a few years ago where he goes to Burma holy shit it was it was

[37:52] awesome I loved it when he used like a like a missile launcher and he blew up one of those guys

[37:58] in the middle he has a 16 caliber gun and he's shooting guys pulling blank and he's like

[38:03] chopping him in half it was pretty funny any movie that ends with him like coming up from behind

[38:09] you and like disemboweling you like incredible all right what about the princess bride that's

[38:16] mostly considered the number one called classic movie of all time I don't know it's hard to say

[38:25] it's definitely I'd still put it in the same category as catty shack in animal house and I would

[38:30] say those would be bigger sellers right okay here's an interesting one because the new one's coming

[38:34] out this year or next year sorry they're filming it now but top gun well you know top gun one of

[38:45] the great things about top gun is Kenny logins right he's like the king of sound tracks and he

[38:51] also did foot loose and he did the theme the catty shack and I don't know it's like that's the song

[38:58] like one of the big songs in the 80s I think that helped really drive the movie but when you think

[39:03] about like the jacks are outdated everything's outdated I don't know I'm talking about from a military

[39:09] standpoint I don't know right you know it has though and I think when you when you think about

[39:15] pinball and being fun man it's got a killer soundtrack it's like the other I was just thinking I

[39:20] would just make a pinball machine I would make just rocky for like no easy way out like I that

[39:29] movie just is so iconic from the 80s yeah you know I'll tell you what's really funny is I was

[39:36] I was making a list of pinball games that if I was one of these smaller companies I'd go after a

[39:40] license to like rocky or evil evil can evil right you hit the shots he doesn't crash the only

[39:48] the shots he wrecks I mean because evil can evils a game of all those old pinball games still sells

[39:54] for four or five thousand dollars when they're restored it's like that's probably the king pin

[39:59] of old pinball games yeah I but I don't think you know if they made it again we're we're talking

[40:06] 2019 viability evil can evil is is kind of out of pop culture what about beetle this that's one

[40:16] that's been built juice would make a great pinball game and I actually had that on my list you know

[40:21] when you're talking about comedies I'll tell you something that I think are really missing is that

[40:25] these pinball companies don't understand how much like Friday the 13th or Halloween those would be

[40:32] huge huge huge huge I guarantee you there's more people would want a Halloween game than the pirates

[40:39] of the Caribbean uh that was just released I there's just a lot of people who love that franchise

[40:45] they made almost 10 movies Friday 13th they've made like 12 I mean these would be great pinball

[40:51] games like if you said because I would listen to one of your podcasts where you say hey we're

[40:55] only gonna make a thousand this is it that's it whatever I think you would sell a thousand

[41:00] Halloween's or Friday 13th and 10th suckers yeah I mean I would definitely put Friday the 13th

[41:07] in front of Halloween I don't know why spooky pinball isn't just like going down a list of

[41:12] horror movies and making the ones people want uh yeah I hope he doesn't do it I cannot I think his

[41:18] games look terrible how do you feel how do you really feel about spooky Larry well I just think

[41:25] the games don't look good okay and if the graphics on the games they just look amateur and I don't

[41:32] understand why the guy doesn't go out and find a really good graphic artist and subcontract that

[41:37] workout is somebody who's really good at it well the graphics though they do look much better on

[41:42] how's Cooper the display well probably because Alice Cooper has a lot of good graphics and

[41:49] supplied him to him but like when they had an artist do it they spent a lot on how's Cooper's

[41:55] display I mean like I've never seen a worse back glass ever okay I mean you'd have to go back

[42:01] to the 30s if they even made pinball games that far back I know I'm not a fan of spooky pinball

[42:07] games I think they look amateur okay all right well thank you for that let me go into a few more

[42:14] titles and then the other thing I want to do is talk about TV shows because we're going through

[42:19] the movie list that I think would be you know we think it would be good a few more like what about

[42:26] spinal tap well you know when you start to mop spinal taps of like that you started asking

[42:32] yourself wait a minute spinal tap really that popular or just do something like clockwork orange

[42:37] right you're talking about cult classic stuff and I think the markets for something like that

[42:42] would be very limited right I'm going on the list of the top crossing movies of all time that

[42:48] that we have not seen a pinball game on that would actually make sense ET the extra terrestrial

[42:55] nobody would want that here's one that I think actually people would want and and it's kind of

[43:01] like to me this movie is a guilty pleasure for men I think women love it I think it's kind of like

[43:08] the back street boys it's like you watch it and you're actually it moves you in a way that you're

[43:13] not comfortable in articulating and that is Titanic yeah you know I actually said that to somebody

[43:20] a pinball company and they said well why would anybody want to gain about where everybody dies

[43:25] that's kind of sad although I think it would be cool um but even when you start talking about

[43:31] Titanic and the theme the exercises people don't realize the exercise is the ninth biggest movie of

[43:37] all time okay that that movie had more effect on people than anything it made people go to church

[43:45] make people believe in the devil you know right uh and I'll tell you another thing and I took

[43:50] I pitched this to Jersey Jack because I take it back though game that I would love to see more

[43:53] than anything would be universal studio monsters okay so you have a mode for Dracula wolf man frankenstein

[44:01] fan the opera invisible man creature in black ogoon you do the whole game in black and white

[44:06] and all the modes are based on the movies and they intertwine those characters so many times

[44:11] the movies like frankenstein versus Dracula mean that game I think would be like amazing

[44:18] you know it's awesome it's called monster bash and it's available to you know monster bash is silly

[44:23] like that's a campy theme I'm talking about a theme where you integrate Bellagosi you integrate

[44:29] Boris carloft as the mummy okay I'm talking about a game more like that right yeah I mean let me

[44:35] let's keep going on the list so jaws is the seventh highest grossy movie ever exorcist as you

[44:41] said was number nine uh I'm trying to think of ones that would work I think for pinball I think

[44:46] Benher is two old school avatar we have Jurassic Park is up there the lion king is interesting

[44:56] but that's super expensive franchise is but godfather's at 25 and forced gump is at 26 what do you

[45:04] think of four is gump I just think it's again that's just like too slow of a movie like the call

[45:10] outs I don't know I just I don't think it would translate too well in the pinball much rather have

[45:15] let's see I'll say a game that was never done right is the dark night series all three movies

[45:22] that was not done right right go spusters comes in really far down the list at 36

[45:30] just how about jimangie or jungle book I'm not really sure about that homelone

[45:38] homelone would be great they have two movies it's totally hilarious I'll tell you what if you're talking

[45:45] about ninchy movies what about christmas or what about national lampoon's vacation they have a ton of

[45:51] movies and you can enter 20 christmas vacation the original vacation what would you think about that

[45:59] yeah I mean I I think the you know there's the vagus vacation sneaks in on you and that wasn't

[46:04] that good the christmas is incredible the first two were incredible you know the european and the

[46:10] regular one I would but I would just make it yeah I'm a fan about focus when it comes to a game like

[46:17] feeling it's like when I watch a movie I can watch one at a time when I play you know it's almost

[46:23] like I would I'd want to select from the very beginning of the game do I want European vacation

[46:28] christmas because the problem is when you have europe and you have christmas and you have

[46:36] you know wally world you you have so such a how do you make the toys on the game reflect all of them

[46:43] I mean I guess you could you could light the house up on christmas you know you could you could have

[46:48] around about that you can't get the ball out of like magnetized like I can't get over there's big

[46:52] bend in parliament you know then you could have wally world and the roller coaster at the end so

[46:58] I guess you could pull it off it would be an interesting table yeah you know what sitting at number

[47:03] 66 all time and nobody would even believe it unless we told it to them national ampune's animal house

[47:10] yeah it's actually adjusted it's actually it's actually a above back to the future it's above Superman

[47:19] so yeah I mean like it's above rocky uh so there's look there's a lot on this list and

[47:26] what so do you think Larry I mean obviously any almost anything can be made into a pin for the

[47:34] for the right price we all know the issues people face with getting the right assets to make the

[47:40] game properly uh but do you think like stern is going to you know keep going back to games that are

[47:48] from the 60s and 70s we haven't seen much modern themes brought to life I mean we saw

[47:56] guardians of the galaxy I think the game was kind of a miss they they they completely messed up

[48:02] Star Wars they haven't really hit it out of the park with theme integration in a long time I

[48:09] would say people are enjoying monsters I think they appreciate the theme integration there

[48:15] but I think the elite looks good it looks great I mean it looks great I'm not going to knock the

[48:20] elite of that game so what about TV shows well I mean you know I think you go right back to what I

[48:27] said before Adams family I mean if you could do monsters you can do Adams family but when you come

[48:33] to TV shows I mean the biggest ones out there have already been done really game of thrones

[48:39] but unless you want to start getting into the comedies like big bang theory sign-failed friends

[48:46] so this is why I think there's an opportunity because I think the TV shows that have been made into

[48:51] pinball machines are more of the recent TV shows that are big so you've got game of thrones

[48:59] what do we what do we have recently we're hearing stranger things is going to be made

[49:03] yeah I don't want to see a pinball based on we had sopranos there was never a pinball

[49:07] machine for lost there was never watched lost a dexter there was never one for

[49:17] Battlestar Galactica but I think the 80s again becomes another interesting period and I'm not

[49:24] talking about the golden girls I'm talking about what about Knight Rider now I don't think it stands

[49:32] up okay what about I don't think Alf stands up what about you know Magnum P.I. does not really stand up

[49:39] what about the 18 well they're remake they're remaking that right now yeah no one cares about it

[49:44] what about 18 oh by the way you know another pinball game that would be incredible as young Frankenstein

[49:49] which is sitting at 132 all time with 412 million dollars that would be a great pinball game yeah I

[49:57] mean like those campy movies are great for pinball I mean pinball and campiness just go together

[50:02] so nicely which is why the A team what do you think a team the old school B.A. Barakas

[50:10] well the TV shows I think would make a fun pinball game I think that's Duke's a hazard

[50:17] although now you're questioning whether or not oh it sets a racist TV show because of the confeder

[50:23] flag but that would it would struggle it would struggle it's just like Michael Jackson Michael Jackson's

[50:30] the biggest recording artist in history and you know it's like obviously he would make a great

[50:35] pinball game but like there's gonna be so many people who would say kick leave you did that right

[50:43] about psycho psycho yeah what you know Hitchcock right so we how Hitchcock movies are classics how

[50:51] about just a Hitchcock pinball game where the modes are like psycho the bird that's where I was

[50:55] going with it I think an Alfred Hitchcock pin that's sort of stylized and that sort of like film

[51:02] noir kind of way would be really cool I'll tell you another one that would be a fun Pimball game

[51:09] is sorry and I fever because the soundtrack is so awesome right what about he man and the

[51:16] masters of the universe well you know I would wait because they have a new movie coming out

[51:23] I think comes out in December so I have to see what what what what you know what happens there

[51:30] we keep hearing about the the the muppets being a possibility with Jersey Jack do you think that

[51:36] would do well no no Air Force one would make a fun pinball game right porkeys so here's here's

[51:46] my thing Larry and we've got we've already listed enough themes to get us through the next 20 years

[51:53] of pinball if you could have one theme that you could just snap your fingers like Thanos and it

[52:01] it would be made which which would it be well you know I'll tell you before I say that you know

[52:06] another game that's never been done and I can't even believe it although Aquaman and Wonder Woman

[52:12] would make a pinball but war of the worlds has never been done which one the Tom Cruise one or the

[52:19] original original right that's a classic right there yeah I mean it's it's niche it's niche I mean

[52:29] you're you're it definitely does not have the same level of impact as some of the other titles

[52:35] you've mentioned and even some of you know the other like horror movies or sort of like

[52:40] campy sci-fi movies there's a lot of campy sci-fi out there right and and we haven't even talk sci-fi

[52:47] as a genre but it is it is a genre that I think correlates nicely with the pinball buying public

[52:55] but I still think something like the Matrix would just blow away that title if you if you put them

[52:59] against each other so what would but what would be your dream one you know that's a tough one

[53:07] because I would probably say comedy and do catty shack or animal house I think those either do either

[53:12] one or we can blues brothers you have a massive solar because it goes beyond pinball right there's

[53:19] so many fans of catty shack and animal house and those movies and I would buy it in a second like

[53:25] you know we talk about Toy Story I'm sold on anything Jersey Jack does and I am I have an

[53:31] approach on Toy Story it's like wait and see because I don't know that I want a pinball game based on

[53:37] and I love the movies I just don't think that I would want a pinball game based on Toy Story

[53:42] why not well I mean because like it's it's definitely a kids movie and you know and I'm 49

[53:52] years old I mean that's that's a movie that my kids saw I think there was the other things I'd

[53:58] rather see long before you would ever give me a Toy Story I don't think anything Pixar makes is

[54:04] is a kids movie I think it's them they're all movies for adults that are very brilliantly written

[54:11] that kids can enjoy but all the themes in all their movies go way over the head of kids well I think

[54:18] this is what you have to ask yourself so when people announce they're doing James Bond people are

[54:25] already lined up five miles deep when you say they're doing the matrix they're going to line up

[54:30] five miles deep and I think the same for animal house catty shack whatever and then you got your

[54:35] themes like mission impossible oh that might be cool I mean see how it looks you know and I think

[54:40] if it doesn't like have that bam out of the box don't even have to see it I want it

[54:45] um I'd move on to something no I don't think James Bond I mean I don't I don't think it's I don't

[54:53] think it would be that successful I don't I think it would be a I mean you've you've got all these

[54:59] different James Bond actors like what is it based on I just don't think it would be it's easy for

[55:04] me to understand what I would be getting because if you said to someone we're gonna make a Toy Story

[55:08] pin I know what I'm getting if you say I've James Bond pin it all it leads me to is more questions

[55:14] okay so here so you gave three roughly I'm gonna give these are my three that I would I would

[55:21] sell any game I had to get it I would I would I would go broke I would take out a credit card

[55:28] and I would max it out to get these not that I need to but if I had to regardless of my economic

[55:34] situation I would have to buy generation one transformers the movie the one from 1987 with

[55:41] Orson Wells and Leonard Neymoy with Unicron cartoon yeah that is the greatest yeah

[55:46] cartoon ever the soundtrack of that what about heavy metal you yeah you got the

[55:51] well let me give you my three you got the touch and dare and the theme song and just like working

[55:59] together with the decepticons to beat Unicron it would be the most incredible pinball experience

[56:03] then I have said this before a big trouble in little china I know it that's campy that's niche

[56:10] I just think it's the perfect theme for pinball and it's so much fun and then the third one for

[56:14] me would be the karate kid I just think that first movie is so amazing and it's it's it's relevant

[56:24] again too with the kobra kai tv show being so damn good I I just all the quotes from it wax on wax

[56:31] off it would be so easy to understand the modes you teach Daniel how to how to get good enough and

[56:36] then you're you culminate in the all-valley tournament and you got the you know you're the best

[56:40] around is playing it's being credible yeah you know what I'll tell you I wouldn't buy a karate kid

[56:47] pinball game but I'll tell you what I would probably buy is a Bruce Lee pinball game with

[56:51] uh Fissa Firi enter the dragon stuff like that now that would be cool okay Bruce Lee pinball game

[56:58] can I tell you what the karate kid would need to just win it over they need to have a mode and

[57:03] when you have to catch like he catches the fly with the chopsticks the book you have to the

[57:09] actually the flipper the flipper paddles they move closer together during that mode and you have to

[57:15] catch the ball in between them well what do you think of Bruce Lee yeah I mean like you got

[57:22] enter the dragon you got Bruce Lee movies it's just again he's got a portfolio of films I think

[57:30] it's cool but again I again I don't think it's just not I don't think again it's at that level of

[57:36] take my money now I have to in a Bruce Lee game I mean how often do people start talking about

[57:41] Bruce Lee when you're at the bar well the one thing I will tell you is Bruce Lee is the martial arts

[57:46] and combat uh what the Beatles are to music uh when you think about it from that perspective I mean

[57:53] you only have two icons probably that you can put above everyone else that's Muhammad Ali and Bruce Lee

[57:59] I mean those are that's one and two right there right um and people I mean Bruce Lee is everything

[58:06] to everybody in martial arts but I just think I think every yes but I there's far more people

[58:12] these movies are fun yeah but there's far more people into action I mean I don't know they don't

[58:17] hold up as well you go watch the old Bruce Lee movies and it's just like horrible sound dubbing and

[58:22] like the storylines are stupid you're just there to see this like shredded Asian dude take on like

[58:27] 50 guys you know and hey he killed Chuck Norris and cream up doldger bar yeah but I mean

[58:35] those movies are just weird it's like these like rich guy invites them all to an island for a

[58:40] tournament and it's like they talk you know there's like a second and a half delay between their

[58:44] mouth moving and the actual dialogue yeah so but I just think the action movies that like Arnold did

[58:51] and Stallone did and you know maybe a Von Daan movie in there I don't know those movies to me

[58:57] have more mass appeal so okay so Larry what do you think music pins well music pins like we've

[59:04] had almost everything and we were what do we missing Led Zeppelin we're missing Queen

[59:10] right Nirvana Nirvana Black Sabbath slash Aussie Chili pepper I mean we're missing far more in the

[59:16] hailing you too you know you can keep going I wouldn't one one one I'll tell you I'll

[59:22] then tell you a curveball that I think would be fantastic is do a pinball based on B.C. Boys you

[59:28] do a Brooklyn theme the B.C. Boys pinball that's gonna sell huge yeah I mean absolutely I think

[59:35] those fan bases are huge I think also B.C. Boys has a little bit more of a you know hip hop rock

[59:40] sort of different vibe than most of the pins we normally get when it comes to music but here's

[59:45] the thing I'm using like music pins I'm a huge just guns and roses fan I hope they do it justice

[59:50] Jersey Jack I I'm kind of you know they don't they don't excite me because simply because

[59:57] music music does not music bands don't represent like a world under glass the way movies do and

[01:00:03] and I you you're not like there's very few bands were like you're not really progressing through

[01:00:08] something like a storyline and and yeah they created in different ways but it's I don't think

[01:00:14] music pins are as enjoyable to flip as as as film sorry as pins based on films and TV shows

[01:00:21] and other properties so okay so Larry we have about like 10 more minutes I want to get your thoughts

[01:00:26] on 2019 and pinball right we got 10 minutes yep then I got I got to go walk Bubba okay so what

[01:00:33] do you know anything that's going on in this hobby that nobody knows do you want to share with us

[01:00:38] well I mean you know when I go to the trade shows I talked all those guys and anything juicy you've

[01:00:45] heard well like a lot of the stuff you know that that I know you know like people already

[01:00:52] have guessed okay you know like Jersey Jack when I he talked to him I mean you know he he did he

[01:01:00] was running around the eye appa show showing people pictures of Wizard of Oz a yellow brick road

[01:01:06] so it looks like what did it look like well I didn't ask to see it okay but I was standing there

[01:01:12] and I he was showing people you know to pictures of it and people I mean when I was standing there

[01:01:19] everybody was like that's amazing so obviously you know that wasn't a secret I don't think

[01:01:26] Willie Wank does a secret and I think that's going to be huge I think that's going to be the

[01:01:30] biggest pinball I mean to me he should have done that right out of the box because Willie Wank

[01:01:35] and Wizard of Oz are in the same fantasy children's you know like realm and he did so good with

[01:01:43] Wizard of Oz I think just think was Willie Wank is going to be a home run and you know what's

[01:01:50] stern you know obviously you know you hear different things the same things that you hear Chicago

[01:01:58] gaming told me that they were going to make their own original game and I don't think from

[01:02:04] Chicago gaming you're going to see anymore the remakes that have to be licensed because I think

[01:02:09] that was one of the biggest reasons why monster bash it and come out sooner and so I think from

[01:02:15] Chicago gaming you're going to see what you expect cactus canyon theater magic tails from

[01:02:22] a radio night so I think it's going to be in that lane and you're not going to see no Twilight

[01:02:26] zone remade or that's what they give any hint about what their original license game would be

[01:02:36] now he just said that they were going to make their own game okay that wasn't one of these remakes

[01:02:42] right and I think that that's where they're going to see the thing about what people don't

[01:02:46] understand about these companies is you know like what Chicago gaming they had stern making the

[01:02:52] games okay and so then when they had that falling out they had to learn how to process okay and so

[01:02:58] and they had to learn to walk and chew gum and like one of the things he told me was one of the things

[01:03:03] that was really time consuming for them was to create their own program that could take these old

[01:03:09] games and you know reformat or whatever the graphics into a higher res look okay and so now that they

[01:03:16] done that now they can produce them a little faster if you get what it mean right now that they

[01:03:21] have their connections on where they're going to get you know like stuff made or order or how they're

[01:03:26] going to get it you know they've streamlined so when people sit out there and they say well these

[01:03:32] game you know they their history is one every year and a half well I don't think you're going to

[01:03:36] I think you're going to start seeing Chicago gaming being able to put out two a year okay and I

[01:03:41] think Jersey Jack is saying deal they've learned from their mistakes and those mistakes are going to

[01:03:46] help them in the future and they realize they need to do more than one game a year right Chicago gaming

[01:03:52] has a huge advantage over Jersey Jack when it comes to sales because with these like home entertainment

[01:03:59] places you know they sell a lot of games into those places that are like arcade retro arcades okay

[01:04:07] so they have a much better sales position with those people and they can kind of push their

[01:04:12] pinballs on them a lot easier than Jersey Jack can and Jersey Jack has a lot of challenges

[01:04:20] because you know like a lot of these places don't want to sell Jersey Jacks because they could sell

[01:04:25] two stones and make $2,400 and make like very little off of a Jersey Jack and so I think really

[01:04:34] to be honest with you I love Jersey Jack they're my favorite pinball company but I think the one

[01:04:38] who's really going to give Stern run for the money is going to be Chicago gaming right what about

[01:04:44] deep root you know I think that you know what I've seen is like when you look at American pinball

[01:04:53] and you look at their ratings on Facebook they're like blow three and it's all because they hired

[01:04:58] that pop a dude right to work on Houdini and so like people are brutal in this industry and so

[01:05:05] I really don't think that people are gonna you don't want to give them a chance

[01:05:11] but there's so much but there's so much more than J-pop and from what I'm hearing

[01:05:16] Johns games are not if you're going to be part of like the lineup early on with the company so

[01:05:21] I mean I think they're gonna be able to sort of deflect and circumvent that negativity and you

[01:05:32] know so I think that'll be the case because they have a huge team there if it was just John and a few

[01:05:36] guys releasing Zidwares old titles I think yes I think the negativity would remain but that's not

[01:05:42] the case this company is much bigger well let me let me tell you something that has to happen okay

[01:05:48] and I told Jack this in fact I said look you're making Willy Wonka I said first off if you wanted

[01:05:54] to go in family fun centers and bowling centers because bowling centers when people remember them

[01:05:59] from the 80s and 90s they'd be like you know some smoky place with like a few arcades off in the

[01:06:05] corner but now they've literally taken out half their lanes and built family fun centers and you

[01:06:11] know when you look at the Dave and Busters and the the big thing now is like this place called

[01:06:16] uh and Dreadies you know and Dreadies doesn't have a single pinball game you know and and I was

[01:06:22] telling uh Jersey Jack I was like you know why don't you make like a four-player pinball game where

[01:06:28] it's a you know like we're peat four people like there it's one game connected and you see them all

[01:06:34] the time at Dave and Busters where then four people walk up they know how to play pinball and you try

[01:06:38] to score as many points as you can in 60 seconds and you get the most tickets right you know

[01:06:44] you have to figure out a way to get pinballs into family fun centers if you're going to have

[01:06:49] this many pinball games because you're going to have to find a market outside

[01:06:54] but I think the the P3 is set up perfectly for that kind of connectivity all next to each other

[01:07:01] simple game like you know where the colored boxes pop up and you have to shoot them you know

[01:07:06] everyone can recognize green and red and where to shoot and then it so I think P3 out of all the

[01:07:12] companies they're they're platform I think would work the best for that kind of environment uh

[01:07:18] all right so here's the thing though Larry and then we're gonna I'm gonna let you go we're gonna

[01:07:22] get you back on the show because I know you're passionate you get a lot you want to talk about

[01:07:25] pinball we're gonna we're gonna have you on uh again so do you think the market though I mean I

[01:07:30] keep when I look at 2019 it's just so much coming out and are we gonna get to the point where it's

[01:07:36] just oversaturated yeah I do think so because like when I went to the amusement expo last year

[01:07:42] and I was talking to I build mini golfs for a lot of family fun centers they don't buy pinball

[01:07:47] games because they said they don't make money okay and so they might make buy one they might buy two

[01:07:53] just for you know it looks cool but the the games that make money are the ones that spit out tickets

[01:07:58] and I think that all pinball companies are gonna have to figure out a way where people can interact with

[01:08:03] these pinball games I'll give you a perfect example before you go like I don't understand why

[01:08:08] pinball games can't be Wi-Fi ready and you got these big screens on a jersey jack machine right

[01:08:14] so down in the bottom right hand corner why can't it show people where you can put money in the

[01:08:18] machine and wait for four other players around the world to play with you okay and win the game

[01:08:24] right there's no reason why you can't have a home game and you turn on the game and it says

[01:08:30] hey your game needs an update or you can log into like the same thing Fortnite does you know

[01:08:34] like a game network online and you can play with people and you so you can get beyond a pinball

[01:08:39] game in your basement and I think that's the only way you're gonna see these games like go past that

[01:08:45] that main demo that they're hitting right now and you have to sell the games in the family fun

[01:08:50] centers and if you don't and I can tell you that jersey jack will have a really hard time doing

[01:08:55] that because no one wants to pay nine thousand dollars they would rather buy a fifty two hundred

[01:08:59] dollars stern so I think there's a lot of challenges to grow the market but you're gonna definitely

[01:09:04] have to look at the amusement industry and what they need to do to pinballs to get those machines

[01:09:10] into those facilities right now I agree and it's gonna be interesting to see who actually

[01:09:16] evolves pinball because the games we're playing today are still just very very small

[01:09:24] you know evolutions of where pinball was 30 40 years ago very very small changes I mean

[01:09:30] we got LCD screen and everyone acted like we you know the pinball made it way into the next century

[01:09:37] and it's like LCDs have been around forever so we've simply caught up but the one thing is pinball

[01:09:44] has not implemented connectivity I think it's stupid you buy a nine thousand arc game and all your

[01:09:49] friends have it and you can't connect to each other and and and have some fun even if you're

[01:09:54] separated from you know by distance where every other entertainment device it's all about

[01:10:00] connectivity and they're a fraction of the price of pinball so the technology is there it's just

[01:10:06] the desire they have dart boards they have dart boards now that you combine connect with people all

[01:10:11] over the world and play darts against somebody there's no reason you can't do their pinball and I'll

[01:10:15] tell you another thing is when you watch ESPN and you see like darts dart world championships or

[01:10:21] whatever right and badminton there's no reason you can't have pinball they need like a world series

[01:10:27] a pinball tournament right where you could be like the champion justice star wars or the champion

[01:10:32] justice Deadpool and you can get you know bracelets and rings and people buy in and they need to like

[01:10:39] create something where it's not everybody working against each other but there's like one central

[01:10:44] thing that happens at a tracks like ESPN or something like that so that you can start like moving

[01:10:51] out of the sandbox when when I'm when I'm done trolling the pinball community for years I'm going to

[01:10:59] troll the dart board community next it's gonna be canators dart board podcast I mean this dart

[01:11:04] boards a piece of shit this guy Andrew highway doesn't know how to make dart boards he only knows

[01:11:09] how to make you know and I think that's gonna be my next stop on my never ending mission to

[01:11:14] infiltrate from the from the outside in these these communities but Larry first of all thank you so

[01:11:20] much for coming on this was fun talking about all these titles and all these themes we'll get you

[01:11:24] back on the show again sometime soon any final words you want to say to the people who tune into

[01:11:31] this podcast yeah you know you know I would say a couple things like you know some people go crazy

[01:11:38] about like what people are gonna make or whether or not gonna make I mean I would just you know take

[01:11:42] it one day at a time and I wouldn't one thing I've learned about pinball is just patience is a virtue

[01:11:47] the more patience you have the better off you're gonna do and so you just need to calm down sometimes

[01:11:53] but I will tell you this though my two we I want to come back on your show and talk about parts of

[01:11:58] the Caribbean because I agree with a lot of stuff you're saying about Jersey Jack and parts of

[01:12:04] Caribbean but really at the end of the day it has nothing to do with that if you just judge pirates

[01:12:10] the Caribbean on its own merit and I really do think it's the greatest pinball game of all time and I

[01:12:15] like to discuss that with you but I will tell you though even though I think it's the greatest

[01:12:19] pinball game ever created because of everything that went into it my favorite game to play is Batman

[01:12:24] 66 so it's one of those types of things but I would love to come on and talk to you right you know

[01:12:31] I'm gonna have to think about it because I've been getting emails from people that are just like

[01:12:36] enough pirates I agree and I agree with them too this show is not this I never start this podcast

[01:12:45] with the with the goal of giving my opinion about a game and then completely handing over my show

[01:12:52] to every single person who disagrees to come on and tell me why but ultimately a few months from

[01:12:58] now nobody's gonna give a shit about pirates the Caribbean everyone's gonna move on to Willy

[01:13:03] Wonka and all the new games coming out that's just the nature of this industry nobody cares about much

[01:13:08] you know even like a month after release it's funny too because like everyone's getting their

[01:13:12] monsters and you don't really even see people like talking about it it's like we're already waiting

[01:13:16] for the next game it's it's it's crazy how short the window of relevancy is in this hobby and

[01:13:24] that is why people are so addicted to the next game because once you own a game nobody gives a

[01:13:29] shit once it's out it's like we care so much before it's released you know I just would say one

[01:13:34] thing to you is like you know I like Stern okay I do think that they've got like a sketch up type

[01:13:41] program where you know it's like you know they can literally make these things on a computer but what

[01:13:46] I I do like Stern I think they're great but I really like Jersey Jack and I I think

[01:13:54] Jersey Jack is the only one out there that's trying to think I'll start to create every game from

[01:14:00] scratch and you know and it's hurting them financially because his passion is just so high

[01:14:06] but that's what happens when you put like a director of a movie and make him also the producer right

[01:14:12] and so they kind of go crazy with how much money they spend and they can't be controlled and

[01:14:16] bring in that's why you have producers on films I just think that Jersey Jack needs a good producer

[01:14:22] to try to like say no no we can't do that because you know money you know it's like whatever but

[01:14:26] I love Jersey Jack then how they're trying to make every they're the innovative company they're the

[01:14:33] only ones with cameras on their games or you know interact with with an app I mean they're really

[01:14:39] trying to change football and they deserve a lot of credit for it right well you know they've

[01:14:46] done a lot the sales are not there and they have to figure out a way to do all that while at the same

[01:14:53] time creating demand for the product because Stern will sell more deadpools than then Jack will

[01:14:59] sell the pirates the Caribbean and that is a tragedy of miss under mismanagement and not

[01:15:07] understanding the market but anyway Larry I have to go walk the big boy I appreciate you coming

[01:15:15] on and I want to thank you for joining canadus pinball podcast hey no problem you take it easy man

[01:15:20] all right well that was an enjoyable conversation with Larry and what's interesting when you

[01:15:25] when you discuss themes and we talk about how important it is to get the theme right it's not

[01:15:30] easy right because you can go to an analyst of the most popular movies and TV shows of all time and

[01:15:35] and music acts of all time and you can land at some places that have humongous fan bases but then

[01:15:42] you have to ask yourself the difficult question would this translate well into a pinball machine

[01:15:49] and even from there right so it might be a theme that would work well in terms of how pinball

[01:15:55] works is a medium but then you also have to ask like would people buy this like would this be

[01:16:00] something that people want to put in their game room so for example citizen can or gone with the

[01:16:07] win as a good example the most popular movie of all time but very outdated right so that probably

[01:16:11] wouldn't work but a movie like men in black like that was successful at the box office but how do

[01:16:17] people think about men in black today right the franchise is sort of exhausted and I think the

[01:16:22] same thing happened to pirates the Caribbean it was big ones but not anymore where a film like

[01:16:28] Gremlins you might say yeah Gremlins is definitely something that would be a sales home run but I'm

[01:16:33] not sure because the younger the younger age bracket of pinball players and collectors they probably

[01:16:40] didn't grow up loving Gremlins see it's really difficult and I still think that if you look at

[01:16:46] pinball in general and where the majority of people will gravitate towards when it comes to a theme

[01:16:53] I still think you're looking at the 1980s I think the 1980s is the sweet spot because most people

[01:17:00] who were children of the 80s are now in the prime earning of their careers and so you know

[01:17:06] and like late 70s even early 80s and those people have even more money but even people who are

[01:17:11] around in the 80s who were a little bit older they still enjoy the 80s tremendously and enjoyed all

[01:17:18] those movies and so I think films from the 80s would be the go to place for me if I were a pinball

[01:17:24] company that was looking to make a splash now that being said there are also juggernaut themes from

[01:17:30] the 90s and 2000s that would work really well if if someone made the matrix how well would that do

[01:17:36] I think it would do tremendously well we saw there was an avatar pin any recent movies that we

[01:17:42] think that would do really well you know it's hard right it's hard because Stern has a lockdown

[01:17:48] on most of like the Marvel stuff I don't think any of those games have been too magical recently

[01:17:53] but it's a great it's a great exercise and what I would love to do and I would love it it I

[01:17:59] would love to sit in the in the boardroom of a new pinball company like American pinball or CGC

[01:18:05] or Jersey Jack pinball and I would love to really explore this kind of exercise because I think if

[01:18:11] you get it right and you pick the theme that really is like on the nail what people will buy and

[01:18:18] what people want in pinball that will lead and open the door to incredible sales because so much I

[01:18:25] think so much is all about the theme and so we'll see we have a lot of exciting themes on the

[01:18:30] horizon with Willy Wonka with Toy Story with Guns and Roses you know there's rumors of Superman 78

[01:18:38] there's rumors of what else is their Jurassic World so a lot of stuff coming out you know what

[01:18:44] Robert I think Robert Mueller said deep route got an 80s theme that they were super excited to get

[01:18:49] and before I sign off and head down to Texas the theme from the 80s that you know me and I know

[01:18:55] people use this term and it's so cliched as their grail theme but I want you as I prepare and pack

[01:19:02] my bags to go down to Texas I want you all to think about over the next couple of days how awesome

[01:19:08] would it be if there was a pinball game that was based on this theme from 1987 it was the last movie

[01:19:15] in which Orson Wells ever played a role and he played the role of the planet of Unicron I want

[01:19:21] you to imagine a wizard mode at the end in which you collect all the Autobots you make it into the

[01:19:28] eye of Unicron and I want you to close your eyes and imagine that what you're about to hear is the

[01:19:33] entire mode of that final wizard mode six balls are going all the lights are going crazy all the

[01:19:40] call out to from this scene I'll see you guys at tpf this is the end of the road galva drawn
