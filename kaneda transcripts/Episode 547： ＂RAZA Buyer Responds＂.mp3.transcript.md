[00:17] Happy Holidays ladies and gentlemen, San has favorite pinball podcast,

[00:21] Canadian pinball podcast is back episode 547.

[00:25] I hope you had a great Christmas break with the family.

[00:28] Let's talk a little bit about pinball and then let you get back to your holidays.

[00:32] Do not ruin this week talking to your relatives about pinball.

[00:36] They don't care. Trust me.

[00:38] I spoke to each and every one of them.

[00:40] They don't care. Okay, so here's the thing.

[00:43] On this episode, I'm going to be joined by Dave Peck.

[00:46] Now I talked about Dave Peck on my last episode.

[00:49] He's the gentleman who went in on a rasa pre-order.

[00:53] He's the gentleman whose fingers crossed is hoping it might become a collectible.

[00:58] It's a great conversation we have with Dave.

[01:00] I want to step into the mind of a man who would give Deeproot Pinball a pre-order deposit.

[01:05] That's non-refundable and I ask him why did you do it?

[01:09] What do you hope to get out of it?

[01:10] And his answers are very candid and I think his approach to pinball

[01:15] is what a lot of people in this hobby have.

[01:17] They look at it as a toy.

[01:19] They look at the money they put towards pinball as disposable and they just want to have fun.

[01:24] They're just in this to buy stuff that brings them enjoyment.

[01:27] And the moment the game doesn't bring them enjoyment, they flip the game on and they go get a new game.

[01:32] So great conversation with Dave Peck. I think you're going to enjoy it.

[01:35] But before that, is there any news in the pinball industry that we have missed?

[01:40] There's really not that much.

[01:41] One thing I want to talk about is David Field, the musician who's contributed his great musical talents

[01:47] to pinball machines.

[01:48] He put out a statement that said his work will appear on four games in 2021.

[01:55] Now what four pinball games will feature the work of David Field?

[01:59] Now let's try to guess.

[02:01] So we definitely know one of them is going to be alien because he did the music for alien.

[02:05] We definitely know one of them is going to be Raza.

[02:08] So that's two games down.

[02:10] So what are the other two games that David Field's music will appear on?

[02:14] Now here are my guesses.

[02:15] I think he is probably contributing work to Chicago gaming companies remake of cactus canyon

[02:22] because we know they are expanding the code in that game and the rules set in that game.

[02:27] And I also think that the fourth title will be the next title from CGC as well.

[02:33] I expect CGC to get two games out in 2021 and maybe we will finally get after all these years

[02:41] of waiting. We're finally going to get the Mark Richie game that he's been working on or maybe

[02:46] it's Ben Hex new game with CGC but I expect CGC to get two new titles released in 2021

[02:53] and David's work will be featured on both of those games.

[02:57] What else is going on?

[02:58] So this is not a news item but this was an interesting thing I saw on Pinside.

[03:03] This was a thought provoking post by Mr. Iceman on Pinside.

[03:06] He wrote that once a year,

[03:08] Stern Pimball should make a game in which they absolutely throw out the bomb.

[03:13] They put their all-star team on the game and they should just make the best game possible

[03:18] and price it accordingly.

[03:20] So that would lead me to believe. Imagine Keith L. Win,

[03:23] Zombie Yeti and Lyman Sheets once a year get to make a game in which they're not making it to a cost

[03:31] but they're making it the best possible game imaginable and they could price it at 15 or 20 grand if

[03:37] bomb were no issue. And we know that in this market with all of these wealthy gentlemen buying

[03:43] these games that if Stern did that right imagine if Stern made the Matrix or Harry Potter or

[03:49] Jaws or Star Wars with an unlimited bomb and priced it accordingly.

[03:54] Imagine if Star Wars was jam packed with toys and everything you would have wanted.

[03:59] Would you not have spent 15 or 20k on it if they made like 500 or a thousand Star Wars like in

[04:06] some platinum series version of the game? Now here is why this will never happen and it won't

[04:11] happen for two reasons. The first reason is this. Stern Pimball would never show us what they could

[04:18] really do. They would never want to do that because it would make everything else they make look

[04:25] really boring, plain and pedestrian. If they showed us the potential of Stern Pimball we would

[04:32] demand it in every game. We would want to see that level of creativity, that level of mechanical

[04:39] engineering. We would want to get that with all of these games because everybody deep down inside

[04:44] knows that we are already paying for that kind of full featured game right now. At $9,200 we should

[04:51] be getting full featured games that have tons of toys and mechs and amazing worlds under glass but

[04:56] we don't get it. We really aren't getting it right now. Stern doesn't want to show us what it

[05:02] would look like if they actually put the extra effort into the games because they're happy doing

[05:07] what they're doing right now and this is the second reason why they would never do it because

[05:11] they don't have to. Look how easily they sold out of El Vira with a piece of couch for $15,000.

[05:18] Look how easy they sold super limited editions of Batman, how they sold the LEDs of El Vira and

[05:24] Batman so easily. Stern doesn't have to do this. They don't have to put more into these games to

[05:31] make a lot of money on these games. Now would I like them to do this? Would I like them to throw

[05:37] the bomb out and make the most magical world under glass for the best themes in Pimball? Absolutely

[05:43] but it'll never happen. They'll never do it. Again I just think I think they would never want to show

[05:49] what could have always been. They want to keep us down in this area now where people are

[05:54] celebrating games like Led Zeppelin when there's barely anything in it. They've got everyone in

[05:58] the perfect position right now. It's almost like everyone is forgotten what used to be in Pimball

[06:04] and now looks at these things and is cheerleading stuff that looks completely barren. It's unbelievable

[06:10] to me but it is what it is as long as people keep buying these Stern machines and keep selling out

[06:15] of the LEDs that don't have much in them then they're never going to change. They're never going to

[06:20] do this. Now I would love for them one day to put all their all-stars on the field at the same time.

[06:26] I would love to see a Lyman and a Zambi Yeti and a Keith L-Win game together. It's so frustrating to

[06:32] me that Stern does it the way they do it. It's like they've got this all-star team and they keep half

[06:38] of them on the bench for each game. Why would you do it that way? I would much rather have Stern

[06:44] only make one or two games a year with their all-star team. You can't tell me that if Stern only

[06:51] released two games a year but it was their all-stars on each title that they wouldn't sell way more of

[06:57] each. Why do you need four or five? Why wouldn't the line keep going if the games you made were

[07:03] much better if they had much more in them? The way they do it now they just hedge their bets but

[07:08] all the players are dispersed all over the place and it's unfortunate. It really is unfortunate.

[07:14] At least over at Jersey Jack Pimbalt you've got the best designer with their code or like it's

[07:19] like they only have all-star people at Jjp. It takes them forever to get games out. It takes

[07:24] them forever to make the games but that's what I would love to see over at Stern is have their A-Team

[07:30] on the field more frequently and together. Before I air this interview I just want to just read

[07:36] something for you that was making me laugh because Led Zeppelin is the new game. Stern's marketing

[07:41] around Led Zeppelin is something that's pretty funny to me so I watched the stream of Led Zeppelin

[07:46] before it got taken down. I saw 30 minutes of the gameplay. Now here's the part that I just find

[07:51] really hysterical. I want to read for you how Stern Pimbalt markets this game and this is word for

[07:57] word they're messaging around Led Zeppelin and you tell me that this is not their reaction to

[08:02] Guns and Roses and they're trying to market this game exactly the same as GNR. So let me read it

[08:08] for you right now. In this high energy rock and roll Pimbal concert experience Pimbal and music

[08:15] are fused together. Players are transported back to Led Zeppelin's early days and tore the world

[08:22] from 1968 to 1980. As if players were members of the band playing its music their play updates

[08:29] game features at the start of each verse and chorus of 10 iconic Led Zeppelin songs. Okay let me

[08:35] stop right there. How is Led Zeppelin Pimbal a concert going experience? How is it? When you watch

[08:43] the gameplay I get that they play a song and then it plays another song. You know what I didn't

[08:48] hear? If this game were supposed to transport you a member of Led Zeppelin in their early days

[08:53] on tour. Okay when you see this game being played the one thing I never hear in this game if you're

[09:00] on tour. Do you ever hear the crowd cheering? Do you ever hear like an applause? Do you ever hear

[09:05] the band members talking to the stadium? Talking to the people at the concert? So I get that they're

[09:11] saying that this is what this game is but is it really this? When you just have one song going

[09:17] after another that's not a concert that just feels like a Spotify playlist. So I really do think

[09:23] that Stern Pimbal's marketing department is communicating something that's not really accurate

[09:28] and I think they saw what GNR did. I think they saw how Guns and Roses is a concert in a box

[09:34] and they're just saying that their game is the same thing but it is absolutely nowhere near that

[09:41] and the game itself if you were to ask me if you look at the Led Zeppelin Pimbal machine what about

[09:45] that game signifies a concert right? What on the play field signifies being at a show? Do you see

[09:54] any instruments as mechs? Do you see I don't understand it? Like they even could have had the

[10:00] magic part that lifts up in the middle be the drum set lifting up. You know it just makes no sense

[10:05] to me that they're trying to market this game completely copying the GNR strategy without any of it

[10:11] being actually in the game. I love the quote from Gary Stern there's nothing more energizing and

[10:17] fun than bringing Pimbal and music together. Nothing there's nothing in the world that's more

[10:21] energizing than that. Partnering with Led Zeppelin we created a one-of-a-kind Pimbal experience.

[10:27] Okay let's stop there. A one-of-a-kind. Every single Pimbal experience is one-of-a-kind unless

[10:34] the exact same thing has been done before. It's our dream goal to create a Pimbal machine with this

[10:39] iconic rock band. I love this too. The Pro Premium and Ellie models all feature a custom-molded

[10:46] Hindenburg Zeppelin toy based on the iconic imagery from the Led Zeppelin 1 album. When

[10:53] lit the Zeppelin toy scores speed locks on the player's musical journey to Zeppelin multi-ball.

[10:59] Really are we really considering that a toy? I mean I don't know anymore people. I really don't

[11:04] know anymore. I really don't know anymore. The more I look at Led Zeppelin the feeling I come

[11:10] away with is this. This game just feels like it was designed before they even knew Led Zeppelin

[11:16] was the theme. When I look at these Steve Richie pins you ever watch like a baking show

[11:20] when you bake a cake and you make the insides of the cake and then you pull the fondant over the

[11:24] cake and that becomes your icing and that becomes how you decorate it as a theme. To me that's what

[11:30] Steve Richie does with Pimbal. He makes a game. He designs it to have shots that he likes and then

[11:36] he just pulls the theme over the game itself and I feel like they just pulled the Led Zeppelin

[11:41] artwork over his design. They just dropped a Zeppelin arbitrarily in that ramp area and that's it.

[11:48] There was absolutely nothing that he designed that feels like it was inspired by Led Zeppelin.

[11:54] Guns and Roses is the complete opposite. Slash and Eric designed everything in that game to be

[12:00] reflective of the band Guns and Roses and reflective of going to a Guns and Roses concert. So I do

[12:07] find Stern's positioning of Led Zeppelin as being that exact same thing. I find that to be

[12:13] insulting to all the hard work that Slash and Eric Minier did because I'm not seeing that with

[12:19] Steve Richie's pin and as much as they want us to believe their pin is that just because they're

[12:24] putting words on a page when you look at that game. How can you look at that game and tell me that

[12:29] this thing was designed by the ground up with a partnership with Led Zeppelin to bring this

[12:35] iconic rock and roll band to life in pinball format. And if these are the worlds underclass that

[12:40] you guys are accepting, if you look at Led Zeppelin and say that's the Zeppelin world underclass

[12:45] that this iconic band that is sold 300 million albums, this is as good as we can do for a pinball

[12:50] machine paying tribute to this band. If this is good enough for you, if this is good enough for you,

[12:56] then really your standards and pinball are so damn low. And I mean that. And I mean that. And it's

[13:02] not just because I've had too much egg knock. I just the more I look at it, the more I wake up and

[13:07] I'm like this stuff is uninspired. It's not that creative. And there's no way to make apologies

[13:13] for this stuff anymore. And I think stern pinball needs to hear this feedback. They do. And I'm not

[13:18] just trying to be negative. I'm just saying you have this great act. You have the ability to make

[13:24] something way more magical than this under the glass. And this is what you give us. And I get

[13:29] that distributor. Is and everyone else out there who's a stern apologist and the stern army will

[13:33] come out of the woodworks and defend this thing and say this is the best we can get. But when I go on

[13:38] Amazon and I type in Led Zeppelin and I see the exact same art package on $3 match box cars and

[13:45] Hot Wheels cars. It's lazy. This is lazy. This is it. This is it. This can't be it. As we go into 2021

[13:52] people, you got to start demanding more from these games. If you buy these games and if these games

[13:58] keep selling at these prices with this little under the glass, you have nobody to blame but yourself.

[14:05] You have nobody to blame but yourself. And I really mean that. I'm starting to get a little

[14:09] bored with some of these games that just feel very cookie cutter. And I don't know why some of you

[14:14] get so excited by this stuff. Go back and look at the games people. Do we have to take a time

[14:19] machine back to the mid 90s to see what we're put into these games for $2,000. And now you want to

[14:25] tell me this is the best we can do. We know we can do better. I'm looking at a guy's sonic,

[14:29] the hedgehog homebrew machine, a homebrew sonic game built in a guy's garage has way more fun

[14:36] stuff in it than Led Zeppelin built by a humongous team over at Stern Pimball. That's called embarrassing.

[14:43] Why is a guy in his garage able to embarrass a big team over at Stern Pimball that's got Led Zeppelin

[14:50] that they can legally work with embarrassing people wake up. Canators Pimball podcast episode 547.

[14:58] Let's air this interview with Mr. Dave Peck. I think you're really going to enjoy it. Happy

[15:02] holidays everybody. We'll be back with my best picks of 2020 as we head towards Twippy Voting which

[15:08] opens up January 1st. So get ready it's voting season people. All the big guns are coming out later.

[15:14] All right ladies and gentlemen Mr. Dave Peck who I quoted on my last show who went in on

[15:20] Araza because he thinks it might be collectible. Dave is going to join the show and explain to us

[15:26] some of that rationale and also talk to us a little bit about a consumer viewing Pimball right now.

[15:31] Welcome to the show first and foremost. Hey thanks a lot. Thanks for inviting me. Now Dave,

[15:35] you're in South Carolina. How many games do you have right now? Right now I'm only

[15:38] got four but anybody that knows me on any of the group sites etc. and knows that I find cell

[15:45] pretty regularly. I don't have a whole lot of space so I swap them out quite a bit. One of the games

[15:49] that you are in on right now and that's no other than Retro Atomic Zombie Adventure Land. Now Dave,

[15:54] I want to start there. What made you order this game? You know it's it's kind of funny. I mean I've

[16:00] been talking to a friend of mine. You probably know Kelly Daniel over at Pimball Palace. He actually

[16:05] sent me the first clip of it and sent it to me and said what do you think of this? And I kind

[16:08] of responded to that. You know it's all right. It kind of looks cool you know but I didn't really

[16:13] do any digging and then probably two weeks later I started digging around and looking into it and I

[16:18] just saw it and they finally posted some pictures more pictures I would I should say. I loved the

[16:24] floating back glass. I loved what they call the pin bar on the front which is the touch pad. I

[16:29] loved the small horizontal display in the front. I thought it was really cool with the lit side panels.

[16:34] I thought the lighting was really good. The gadgets were good. The theme looked fun and funny.

[16:38] It looked fun to play. So I just took a dive to be honest you know and thought you know this

[16:43] this is pretty cool. I like the way it looks. It looks like they're only producing around 300 of them

[16:47] at least the extra version and that they call it. Now you said in your statement that you're scared.

[16:53] What are you scared about? Because it's you know everybody's kind of talking a lot about it. They're

[16:59] talking about losing their money. They're talking about when Deeproot had a had a different company

[17:04] a while back. One of the guys in the group said he's been waiting 10 years for them to deliver a

[17:08] machine. Well that was a different company a while back and Deeproot's different now obviously

[17:12] they're a different company anyway. And so I'm just kind of scared with a startup company. I'm

[17:17] scared that you know they're going to take my money or they're going to take everybody's money

[17:20] because highway, highway pinballs. Same thing happened you know they they made a lot of promises.

[17:24] They delivered a few machines. They shut the doors. People lost a lot of money so that's why.

[17:28] Now what version of Raza did you order? I ordered the extra. Okay so you're all in. So

[17:33] did you pay in full or do you give it deposit? No I gave it deposit. My reason was because I want to

[17:40] make sure they deliver a game. I want to see some people actually say hey my games here it works

[17:44] you know because they actually have a strange contract with with that game right now that you

[17:48] have to actually look through and you have to sign before you can before you can see a little deal

[17:51] and have your deposit taken etc you know and part of that I don't know whatever you want to call it

[17:56] that thing that they wrote up for everybody to sign basically leaves you hanging if they don't

[18:01] deliver or if the machine's not you know everything they said it would be etc you know it's kind

[18:05] of sketchy let's just put it that way. So Dave this is this is the point that I'm so curious about

[18:10] and I'm so happy you're joining the show and being a good sport you get this contract that is

[18:14] sort of like an indemnification clause right that if anything goes wrong or we don't deliver your

[18:19] game you lose your money and that's it you have no recourse is that how is that not a red flag how

[18:25] did you still push forward and then send money. You know it's it's I'm a gambler I guess people

[18:31] in the past have gotten games from startup companies and I'm and I'm kind of going out on a limb hoping

[18:35] that I'm going to be the same guy that does but I am a gambler you know and I didn't have to put

[18:39] down a huge amount I mean it's a huge it's not some change don't get me wrong it's like 1500

[18:43] bucks you put down but you know I'm also going out on a limb thinking okay that you know they seem

[18:48] pretty serious about it they seem like they're ready to do this this time I guess even those been

[18:53] delayed three times and I'm just kind of going out on a limb I don't know what else to say other than

[18:57] that really I'm a gambling man what do you think your odds are that you're going to get a game

[19:02] when they promised it to you oh wow when they promised it to me when did they promise it to you

[19:07] uh they promised it to me in February or March okay so you think that good and I don't think

[19:12] that's going to happen I really don't I hope it does but I really don't at what point on this

[19:17] journey will you start to worry uh you know probably not till summer to be honest um it's summer

[19:24] wait wait that's a while wait so you put down a non-refundable $1,500 deposit on a company that

[19:33] promised you a game in March and you won't worry until summer well because I didn't put down

[19:38] the whole thing if I had had ten grand on this thing I'd be worried March 3rd probably right

[19:44] now I only put down a little bit so you know I'm giving them some time obviously it's been delayed

[19:48] three times I expect it's going to be delayed a fourth time and the reason for that is I watched

[19:52] a YouTube tour of their their facilities three weeks ago you know they've got something called a

[19:57] pin box now that they want to pack these things in and they want to charge you a thousand bucks

[20:00] for that to pack the machine and get it to you undamaged you know otherwise they're not going to

[20:06] take any responsibility if the machine gets damaged unless you spend a thousand bucks on this

[20:09] crazy thing that they've built so you know they they've demonstrated that another red flag no

[20:14] Dave at Dave still in I here's what I love about Dave you just like all the red flags it's like all

[20:19] the roads are closed signs you're just plowing through them and so pin pod is the only way a little

[20:25] guarantee the safety of the machine it's a thousand dollar box it's a wooden box that they're branding

[20:30] what do you think about the guys who put down nine k do you think that was that's too much of a risk

[20:35] I do yeah I do and some of these guys bought multiple games you low bird bought two on day one

[20:42] and so let me ask you a question raza 300 we haven't seen any manufacturing now as a buyer were

[20:50] you able to talk to robberter anyone over a deep route when you sent your order in and did you

[20:54] ask any questions about manufacturing and when you might see stuff I did send them an email the

[21:00] next day after placing my deposit asking you know what their timeline was and where I would be in the

[21:05] queue I just wanted to see where I was you know maybe it's not too late to grab my deposit back if

[21:09] they give me the wrong answer sorry I put my phone on sign up but and so I sent them an email and

[21:14] I asked those questions and they did respond they're responding in about 10 minutes they said you

[21:18] know thanks for your order if you look on our website you know we we've kind of designated how we're

[21:22] going to release these machines and the way they're doing it according to them is that they're going

[21:26] to give the people that paid all the money up front first dibs on the machines once they're ready

[21:30] and then they were going to get down a line after that to people who put it down on the deposit and

[21:34] they told me that you know my machine was expected to be released sometime in February or March

[21:39] it does feel like a gamble because even according to them whoever risks more gets rewarded faster

[21:45] with their sort of you know you kind of cut the line if you pay him fall so all right so you're

[21:49] in on a deposit now that deposit is non-refundable right like you can never you can never ask for that

[21:55] money back ever yeah no I could probably ask that I'd get it from what I understand you know

[22:01] that the only option you have would be to take it as a store credit when it comes down to it if

[22:07] you've got 1500 bucks laying down and you're going to try to fight over it you're you're wasting

[22:11] your time you're wasting your money I mean you know even a lawyer's going to charge you a few

[22:14] hundred bucks to send them a letter and by the way you've thrown 1800 bucks in so it's a big

[22:18] gamble it is now what number raza are you I didn't even look Kelly told me his number and I was

[22:24] going to check my email and see what number I was and I didn't even look when I looked this morning

[22:28] a friend of mine had order one and he was number 186 wow okay so they're getting up there

[22:33] and they said 300 will be the maximum and no matter what they get by the 30th of December so

[22:39] we've only got a little more than like a week away from this thing being closed order banks are

[22:46] and then they're going to get to building the game do you hope you see some time in January

[22:50] Dave the manufacturing line will that make you feel better it would yeah okay well we we hope so

[22:56] too so the other part I want to talk about is you said that this thing might be collectible right if

[23:00] they only make 300 razas what did you mean by that if you go in and you get it you think this game

[23:05] will be worth more than the nine thousand dollars it costs it could possibly I mean you know

[23:11] not necessarily when I say collectible you can interpret however you want you know I looked at the

[23:15] word collectible just so I make sure I was understanding exactly what you were looking at possibly

[23:19] you know and and just a definition is worth collecting of or of interest to a collector or it's

[23:25] able to be collected that's what collectible the definition is now very broad it does not necessarily

[23:31] mean it's going to be more valuable one day but you know it's going to be sought after possibly

[23:37] it might be a rare item that people are looking for because there were so few out there and then

[23:41] hopefully yeah hopefully the value goes up same thing happened with alien when highway you know

[23:46] went under they only released I think I want to say around 200 machines before they shut the doors

[23:50] half of those stayed in the US half of them stayed overseas roughly and it created a demand a lot of

[23:55] people like me love the theme they love the machine and that drove the price up and so it became

[24:00] what I consider to be a collectible item and I'm kind of hoping that deep route becomes something

[24:05] similar and the reason for that is because I think that they've got a very unique machine I think

[24:10] they've got a machine that is unlike anything that's on the market with the pin pad with the

[24:14] raised back glass she'll be floating back glass the game looking fun the lit side panels haven't

[24:18] been around since alien they need to hire me for marketing because it's the pin bar not the pin pad

[24:24] it's the pin pod not the pin box Dave you're yeah you're renamed all these things okay so Dave on

[24:30] some level and I I'm just curious because I would be this way do you hope they don't sell too many

[24:35] because then you have a rare version of raza are you sort of wishing it doesn't get the 300 that

[24:40] is maybe just two I don't think so you know and I'm just gonna compare apples to oranges I mean if

[24:44] you look at Jersey Jack some of their games you know are thousands you know some of them they're

[24:48] making five thousand you know I mean it's you know 300 isn't that many when they've already sold

[24:53] I'm guessing probably 200 by now you know 100 more no I'm not really it's not on my radar really

[24:57] for them to to go under 300 or one way or the other I don't think it's gonna matter too much just

[25:01] ma'am now I told deep route that I would buy raza game number one but my conditions were different

[25:08] than their conditions my conditions were I would buy the extra edition if it was made and put in a

[25:13] box I would buy the first game or the first one of the first few games off the line Dave do you

[25:18] think Robert has heard my offer and do you think he will sell me a raza without me putting a deposit

[25:24] down I have no idea do I think he's heard it probably you know I mean he responded to my emails

[25:31] you know I can only imagine if you went through the same channels I did he probably sold it a year

[25:35] from now are you gonna hate Kelly Daniel are you still gonna be friends no absolutely not you know

[25:40] everybody's entitled to their opinion Kelly and I are on the same page for a lot of things I think

[25:43] you know well maybe not Led Zepple and he likes he's more fan of a theme than I am I think but uh

[25:48] but everybody's entitled to you to pin you I don't have a problem with anybody's opinion we'll be

[25:52] friends so what other games are you in the market for right now right now I'm in the market for

[25:57] the deep raza and the alien so you have a deposit down on alien yeah walk me through how you came

[26:02] to that well I'd heard back at the beginning of summer that there were whispers about this game

[26:07] being remade of course they had been whispered about it for years but I heard from more of a

[26:10] reliable source that sent me some pictures that may actually happen and um so I just kind of

[26:14] sat around and waited and you know eventually it popped up hey your uh Pymal brothers is back and

[26:19] they're gonna be re-releasing alien and they obviously made some changes to it everybody's

[26:23] aware of that probably by now I just saw it coming and you know again I know it's a game we'll

[26:27] just decided to go for it because it was one of my favorite games to be honest um it was one of my

[26:31] most expensive games I have to be original highway alien and so I was kind of excited that I might

[26:35] have the opportunity to get another so do you still have your highway alien I didn't I sold it

[26:40] okay and did you probably profit it off of that sale now I didn't actually um I'm just about

[26:47] broke even on it did you have an LA or or standard standard okay so you saw Pymal brothers is bringing

[26:52] it back and so you've gone in with coin taker correct to get this game right okay now there's not

[26:58] bunch of a gamble there because coin taker is not gonna send the Pymal brothers your money

[27:02] until your game is ready to shit yeah and then you know I mentioned that one of the forums because

[27:07] whenever you start talking in the forums everybody's got a lot of different opinions etc and you

[27:11] know some people are agreeing some people don't and a lot of people mentioned oh you're gonna

[27:14] lose your money on alien again and you know my response was the same I was like you know I'm not

[27:18] buying from Pymal brothers directly but I want to add that I think Pymal brothers mentioned they

[27:22] didn't want to take deposits on this game and well I guess they didn't lie they're not taking them

[27:26] coin takers taking them so I'm putting my faith in coin taker that if they don't get the machines

[27:30] they're gonna give me my money back right and nobody's been burned more than coin taker over the

[27:35] years they're the ones who gave John poppiduke a ton of money for razas back in the day I think

[27:40] they were out a couple hundred grand in in raza pre-orders so they've been more careful because they

[27:45] also got burned by berry with lebowski's they've learned their lesson now Dave were you around when

[27:51] the whole highway Pymal big lebowski fiasco was going on and people were losing money on pre-orders

[27:57] no I've read a lot about it in the forums and I was part of the forum once I got my machine so you

[28:02] know people were talking about it okay so you weren't there to feel the sting of this thing and

[28:07] do you feel that you might be going down the same road that some of those people went down way back

[28:12] then when they got stars in their eyes because they really wanted these games but the lessons

[28:17] everybody learned was the companies have to be sound and you have to really understand the

[28:24] complexities of manufacturing Pymal before you take people's money like knowing that and you must

[28:29] know that now that's why people when when you say like I pre-ordered raza people are jumping on you

[28:33] or a pre-ordered alien do you feel like if you were around back then you might be more hesitant to do

[28:39] this right now I mean it yes and no I mean with alien I don't feel that way because I think

[28:45] coin takers are solid company and you know I think they're holding the money as well and they

[28:49] want to see machines before before they're going to pull the trigger themselves but with deeper yeah

[28:54] you know I'm a little more nervous and but I you know again it's a small investment compared to

[28:59] 10 grand I think so I'm taking my chance let me ask you a speculators question because I'm a gambling

[29:04] man myself you know I like to put money down on the on football every weekend I bet against the

[29:08] jets I've made enough money to buy a Pymbal machine betting against the jets how about you and I

[29:13] we go in on a second gamble let me run it by we go half and half on an extra edition deposit

[29:20] was at like 750 each yeah and then we flip it if it if it actually comes out if it's collectible

[29:27] and they make only 300 you and I brother work will flip it we take what we get would you be for

[29:32] that canada and gave becko in on one I flipped my guns and roses and I made a little bit of money

[29:38] because people got it the demand was there so yeah I'm all over that all right so we're going to do

[29:42] it so you're her to hear first canada and Dave Packer going to go split see on a raza extra edition

[29:47] right now Robert Mueller's like you get any email from canada you hit the lead and we're canceling

[29:53] that order we're going to tell me's order number 301 so wait you flipped a guns and roses jersey

[29:57] jack machine are ready good yeah what do you take what talk to me about that all right um you know I

[30:04] wanted it I wanted it I've got an acdc I love my acdc I wanted it right next to it um I loved

[30:09] everything about the way it looked um everybody was giving it great reviews and I worried one and

[30:15] mine was delivered probably three weeks ago before I opened it I've messaged Kelly and I was like

[30:22] you got a gnr over there you got I got the Ellie and I was like okay I need to come play it before

[30:26] I want to before I decide if I want to flip this thing or keep it and so I went over to his place

[30:30] and you know what I played it once um and I know that's not the right thing to do I mean I

[30:34] eventually played it more don't get me wrong but I played it once then I want to play stranger things

[30:38] I wasn't thrilled about it right away you know so I was like all right you know I went back somebody

[30:42] else was playing it and it to me I had more fun watching somebody else play it then I had playing it

[30:47] and the reason for that is because there's a lot going on there's lights galore which it's a really

[30:53] cool looking machine and they've got these rotating light cannons that come on at certain parts of the

[30:58] game the music's awesome there's so much happening that it's almost confusing I had a had a better

[31:02] time watching people play so Dave are you a gnr fan oh yeah absolutely okay so I'm a little

[31:08] surprised to hear that a diehard are you diehard van or just a casual fan they've got a lot of

[31:12] fans I love you know classic rock and roll I love the 80s rock and roll I'm an 80s kid so all right so

[31:18] I do agree that gnr is probably the most fun pinball machine you can watch someone else play because

[31:24] of the experience and how visceral it is but one play and you're you moved on to strange

[31:29] your things which is arguably one of the worst games of 2020 and yet that's all you needed to

[31:35] make up your mind to bail on it as I said I as I said I'm gonna go or a few seconds ago I did go

[31:40] back and played a few more times and it still didn't click for you it didn't click now um you know

[31:44] I thought it was it was okay um I loved I loved everything about it but the way it played I mean

[31:49] I thought it was kind of a little mundane I suppose I had a lot of cool tricks it had a lot of

[31:55] the ball locks cool the the back glass video audio everything's awesome um but to really appreciate

[32:01] it's it's better to watch them though well look I mean Dave I'm not gonna fight you on this because

[32:05] this is pinball it's subjective everyone has a different experience with every machine some people

[32:10] love Star Wars some people hate it some people love gnr some people hate it so different strokes

[32:14] for different folks so I completely understand if it wasn't clicking with you what better time to

[32:20] flip it then right now because people are paying over 9500 for it so how much did you get for your

[32:25] gnr le I got 12 five day oh see not a bad day people three thousand dollars profit and now if you

[32:35] want to go buy another le you've just saved yourself a lot of money and now there's your

[32:41] riser deposit right there well yeah and I did you know I did contact a guy bought it from

[32:45] the say hey if I get back on the list you know if I change my mind when can I get it he said

[32:48] mark so you know it's about the same thing and I did the same thing with Led Zeppelin to be honest I

[32:52] was excited because I won all three of them I'm a classic rock fan as I mentioned and I put

[32:56] put my name on the list for a Led Zeppelin and I pulled my name off why didn't you stay in and flip

[33:01] Led Zeppelin Ellie I didn't flip it I never got it obviously um but I did I pulled my name off the

[33:06] list I was excited about it I thought you know what a great thing you know greatest rock and roll band

[33:10] of all time you know I've got AC DC I was considering gnr why would not be all over Led Zeppelin I

[33:15] love Led Zeppelin and they released the teaser video that was enough to hook me a lot of places

[33:20] were already sold out and I happened to be number 11 on a list of 10 at one company and they said

[33:25] you know what you know you got a pretty good shot at it you know you're one of 11 people now that

[33:29] that want this thing and somebody might back out and we'll call you next couple days later as

[33:33] when they actually released the gameplay video I got a call like an hour after that thing came out

[33:38] to be honest and I think some people felt the same way I did you know it didn't look exciting I

[33:43] expected a lot more when I saw the gameplay video I thought that the cabinet was just ugly it just

[33:49] kind of looked like a carbon copy of El Viro without the house in the back and um and I thought

[33:54] that Led Zeppelin deserved a lot more than that I think a lot of people agreed the game is it

[33:59] just feels a little pedestrian and mediocre for that kind of theme and people would have loved

[34:04] to have seen you know Stern go a little bit more creative and over the top on a Led Zeppelin

[34:08] pinball machine and so I don't think that game's gonna skyrocket in value I think there's gonna

[34:14] always be some decent demand for it but I also don't think if you got Led Zeppelin Ellie you could

[34:18] sell it for 12.5 I just don't think I don't think so either you know in the way that way that

[34:23] Jersey Jack nailed guns and roses with theme I really thought that Stern would come out with something

[34:29] comparable it's not even crazier and I was disappointed but why would you expect that when is

[34:34] Stern ever gone above and beyond what Jersey Jack puts into a game you know I mean I guess that's

[34:39] just me my expectations you know when you're in a in a market where you've got competitors and

[34:43] somebody you know puts out guns and roses awesome looking you know when somebody does that and

[34:48] then you put Led Zeppelin next to it it's not even comfortable well here's why Stern doesn't do

[34:52] it right and you sort of answered this question when you were saying there were 10 people already

[34:57] on a list to buy it before they even saw it and that's what's wrong with this industry right now

[35:03] and I keep saying this if nobody test drives a car and nobody even sees the car and yet the car

[35:09] is already sold out people love car arguments by the way why would a manufacturer improve the product

[35:14] and that's what's happening in Pimbal is everyone just runs at every new Stern machine regardless if

[35:19] it's good or not sells out the Ellie on day one and then by the time the dust settles and we actually

[35:25] know if we like the game or not they've already sold through the entire allotment of Elise and

[35:29] they do it every time you know they do the game has to be a total stinker for that not to happen

[35:35] stranger things by the way they do they sell out all the time I I overpaid for an Elvira how much

[35:40] you pay paid 11.5 for for the Ellie yeah they're popping up again on eBay the Ellie's but this

[35:47] was new in the box that's why I never wanted you know the only ones that were in that phase at that

[35:52] right and is that one that's going to be bolted to your floor no sold it you know actually I

[35:58] traded it on a on a Willy Wonka which I don't have any longer either but Dave right now people are

[36:03] listening to this and they're like Dave Peck is everything that's wrong with Pimbal right now you

[36:09] are you're sort of like I'm a short attention span why why Pimbal Dave why not bottles of wine why

[36:16] not watches like it doesn't feel like is it Pimbal or is it just the excitement of unboxing playing

[36:22] so I've got a short attention span I've had motorcycles I've had an aerial atom I put a deposit

[36:26] down on the new cyber truck it's just the way I roll you know I mean when it's no longer fun it's

[36:30] time to get the next toy and that's one of the rules at our house you know I can't keep buying all

[36:34] this without getting rid of some of it because then and I'm stuck so you got money to burn and

[36:38] you're just having fun well I don't know if I've got money to burn I you know I try to make sure

[36:42] that I rotate my toys so that I don't come out of pocket too much right okay and like there's

[36:47] nothing wrong with it Dave I think you represent a large portion of the Pimbal buying community that's

[36:53] often underrepresented in the community do you ever feel that way that there's sort of like this

[36:58] let's attack all these newbies with money who buy these games and let's make fun of them for doing

[37:03] this it's just a toy like you don't have to be in a good financial place to even begin thinking

[37:07] about buying these machines no I mean I don't necessarily yes the new ones absolutely you know

[37:12] you can't get into them for less than 10 grand anymore if you want to you know there's there's

[37:16] plenty old machines we don't care about the old machines on can you just bimbal podcast you know that

[37:21] so yeah the new machines aren't cheap you you definitely have to pay to play right

[37:25] in more ways than one now what's your dream theme Dave you seem like a guy that if I'm if I'm a

[37:30] Pimbal company I want to make a game that you're not going to flip you're not going to sell right

[37:34] away I want to give you the game that Dave Peck says both this thing to my floor you know I'm a

[37:39] sci-fi fan I'm really excited about alien I'm not excited about the the SE I'm more excited to see

[37:45] what the Ellie's all about but in any case overwhelm me with gadgetry overwhelm me with sensory stuff

[37:50] and and make it fun to play without me getting too confused all right but what theme what theme I

[37:56] mean I love alien but you sold alien Dave I have to push back here you had an alien you just I

[38:03] just asked for the theme that you would never sell it why sold it what okay why'd you sell it

[38:08] because it's a fourteen thousand dollar pinball machine and the company's no longer in business

[38:13] parks were getting really hard to find I was really nervous every time I turned the thing on

[38:17] that thing was going to be broken and I'd be stuck with a fourteen thousand dollar paperweight

[38:20] I did hear rumors that you know possibly another one was going to be coming out so I felt like you

[38:25] know maybe it's time to find a collector to put in their collection and you know play it periodically

[38:30] and I wouldn't worry about all that anymore so that was my reason okay collector or someone who

[38:36] has a gluttony for punished me wants to keep fixing Andrew highway's mistakes with all the

[38:40] different issues in the game so Dave you're a dream come true for a pinball manufacturer I want

[38:45] nothing but customers like you because I feel like I could sell you anything just enough to get you

[38:51] to buy it you get bored of it in a few months you'll probably sell it you won't lose your shirt

[38:55] because that's the other good thing about pinball is you never lose too much money you get your fun

[39:00] sometimes you might make a profit sometimes you might lose a few hundred bucks and then I want

[39:04] to sell you the next game and the next game there must be a picture of you at Stern Pimball Day that's

[39:09] like this is our guy I hope so and I hope they go sending one so no I mean it's the truth you know

[39:16] I don't I don't make any mistakes about it people give me grief all the time there's a few of us

[39:19] not just me I mean there's a bunch of other people that are just like me you know that

[39:23] room for three machines you're gonna keep rotating and keep flipping them and make some money lose some

[39:27] money have some fun move on to the next one right nothing wrong with that let me ask you Dave how

[39:32] often do you play pinball every day how long give me minutes damage minutes right sometimes three or

[39:39] four games sometimes a whole six pack these games like do you have most fun when people come over are

[39:44] you playing them solo like what's your ideal pinball playing experience you know I buy myself I

[39:49] just enjoy being immersed taking my mind off of it I own a few businesses and to me it's a

[39:54] release to get in there and play some pinball and and just think about you know what's going on

[39:58] in front of me and get immersed in that absolutely you know I wish I could have more than one machine

[40:02] I don't even have any machines right now but it is something that when you're locked into a pinball

[40:07] game the rest of the world sort of fades away a little bit and you're just sort of in that world

[40:11] flipping that game you've got an alien s c coming you mentioned that you weren't quite satisfied with

[40:17] the alien s e but they didn't have any details on the led you think that was a mistake that they

[40:23] should have some details to get people excited and more people but they also want to sell

[40:27] L.E. so they didn't want to give too many details or see me s's they didn't want to give too many

[40:30] details and have people wait till the L.E. came out if I were pinball brothers I would have probably

[40:35] gone on the opposite approach I would have put out the L.E. first you owned the highway version

[40:39] do you think they improved it or did they remove stuff that you're going to miss they improved it

[40:44] a little bit and then they removed things I'm going to miss what I'm going to miss is the small

[40:48] monitor in the play field and they replaced that with some weapons lights that show you where you

[40:54] are in the game that was the one thing I really liked about that game and that you know I thought

[40:58] was really cool because as I said you know there's so much going on in these games sometimes you

[41:02] don't look up who looks up at the back glass you know unless you're getting ready to shoot the ball

[41:05] again or it's locked you know you might get three seconds to look at it well the cool thing about

[41:09] alien was that you can always see what was going on because you had that little monitor in the

[41:13] screen right in front of you at the play field and they took that out I think every pinball

[41:17] machine should have that to be honest Dave I want to see you keep this game and here's I know if

[41:21] you love alien you're probably going to want the L.E. here's what I think is going to happen you're

[41:25] going to get an early S.E. you're going to realize that it's fun but then you're going to want the

[41:29] L.E. and you're going to flip it and make a couple grand and I'm not going to blame you on this

[41:33] and then you can put that money towards the L.E. you're a reminder what's going to happen to me in

[41:38] 20.5 you're going to own a couple businesses and buy a lot of pinball machines and look I don't

[41:44] begrudge you at all and Dave I mean this I think there's too much finger pointing at the people

[41:49] who actually keep this hobby alive and it is gentleman like you you're buying multiple products

[41:54] from multiple companies and that's what has kept pinball thriving over the years so you'll get a lot

[42:01] of arrows in your back when you flip machines for a profit people hate that for some reason but you

[42:05] know what capitalism people we didn't invent capitalism we just take advantage of it I mean it's

[42:10] you know it's what the market demands you know do I expect to make money on every game no

[42:13] you know do I only sell games when I'm going to make money no I've lost money on games I will

[42:17] say that you know one thing that was a little going back to pinball brothers real quick one thing

[42:21] that was disappointing to me like you mentioned was that they did not show any gameplay and to me

[42:25] I was like okay well you show me those pictures of it you know you probably don't have a machine

[42:30] built yet you know that's kind of crazy yeah you know and if they do it's probably in the stages

[42:34] where they don't want to show anybody so you know that's scared me a little too you know and then

[42:37] I remember okay coin takers gonna take care of me so I calm down well I'm surprised a guy like

[42:42] you didn't get in on guns and roses collector's edition which is where the real money is this year

[42:47] you don't have one I don't you know I looked at it that's that thing sold out really quick very quickly

[42:52] before I could even figure out they had it I bet Kelly has one he doesn't know or you guys locked

[42:58] out of the big money maker this year you guys picked two decent stocks but you missed out on Tesla

[43:04] oh well yeah you're right I didn't find any Tesla stock but they've got my money for a cyber truck

[43:08] that I'll probably never get yeah well you know what why buy Tesla stock two years ago just buy

[43:13] pinball machines you know it's much better investment I'm kidding people well Dave I want to thank

[43:17] you for joining canateus pinball podcast have you been a listener of the show for a while

[43:21] no fairly recent to be honest okay are you enjoying it any tips you can give me

[43:25] absolutely absolutely any tips for the show because I'm always looking to improve

[43:30] no I mean I you know I always say do what you love and love what you do and you know as long

[43:34] as you're doing that people are gonna have opinions you know let them have their say and go

[43:38] from there it's not a big deal great are you voting in the twippies and no not at this time what

[43:42] why not you know it's just not on my radar to be honest I mean you know it's just I'm a pinball

[43:47] enthusiast but try not to get into the politics too much right can we ask for your vote right now

[43:52] on the air Dave come on I don't have a choice yeah no it's all right it's all right well Dave I

[44:00] really appreciate you taking the time to join us this is always fun to get people on the show and

[44:05] I also just like getting a different vantage point and you're obviously a collector who gets
