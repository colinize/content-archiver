[00:00] ["Celestia of the Universe," by The Ceremonies plays.]

[00:18] Aw, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only Pinball Podcast that is giving you three shows in one week, two of which will be good!

[00:28] Maybe this is one of those two.

[00:29] Everybody, here's what we're gonna do.

[00:31] I'm turning a new leaf over.

[00:32] I am starting a new chapter.

[00:34] I'm not gonna complain about Toy Story anymore.

[00:36] I'm not gonna mention it.

[00:38] I'm gonna play the game.

[00:39] I'm gonna enjoy it.

[00:40] I'm just never gonna buy it.

[00:42] And if you enjoy it, I'm happy for you.

[00:44] But what I wanna do on this episode

[00:46] is I wanna look towards the future.

[00:48] What's coming out in Pinball that we're excited about?

[00:51] What are the next titles, right?

[00:53] If we're gonna say, hey, take my money,

[00:56] which titles are the ones that are gonna take our money?

[00:58] And I wanna say this, you can't have hits in Pinball

[01:02] if you don't have misses.

[01:04] And what's fun about this hobby

[01:06] and covering this hobby for me

[01:08] is I will call a game a hit when I think it's a hit.

[01:11] And if I think it's a miss, it's a miss.

[01:13] But the good news is,

[01:14] we don't only have one game a year or one manufacturer.

[01:18] So if a game doesn't work for you

[01:20] or it doesn't work for me,

[01:22] the good news is there are many games

[01:24] coming down the pipeline for us to consider.

[01:27] And that's why this hobby is fun.

[01:30] That is why we love it so much because everything,

[01:33] everything doesn't ride on just one game.

[01:38] And so let's talk about each manufacturer

[01:40] and what they have coming down the pipeline.

[01:43] And whether or not I think it's gonna be a successful game

[01:47] or whether or not I think it's an exciting title

[01:49] to put into the market.

[01:50] And for a lot of these companies,

[01:52] they've done a really good job of keeping things a secret.

[01:56] The days of me seeing games before they came out are over.

[01:59] Like I used to be able to have guns and roses in my phone.

[02:02] We all saw the Ghostbusters before it released.

[02:04] We saw Deadpool before it released.

[02:06] But these companies have done a very good job

[02:09] on keeping what's coming a private mystery.

[02:13] Now there are still loose lips in pinball.

[02:15] And so I will do my best to tell you

[02:18] what I think is coming from each company.

[02:20] And let's start with Stern Pinball.

[02:22] So Stern Pinball has taken this like six month break.

[02:25] And the word on the street is they are giving more

[02:28] of their designers and coders time

[02:30] to make these games even better.

[02:32] So I expect the next games that come out from Stern Pinball,

[02:36] they are going to be probably code finished

[02:39] and they probably are gonna have a little bit more in them

[02:42] because they've given their designers more time

[02:44] to tinker and play with the games.

[02:47] Now, have they increased the bomb?

[02:49] This is probably the most important thing

[02:52] for all pinball companies to figure out right now

[02:54] because I keep saying it.

[02:55] If you're gonna charge these prices

[02:57] and a Stern premium is now 9K and an LE is like 11.5.

[03:02] If you're gonna charge these prices,

[03:04] the games have to be great.

[03:05] And this is why I said it on my Facebook Live today.

[03:08] I think all these companies have dug a financial ditch

[03:11] they're now standing at the bottom of.

[03:13] And the more expensive your game is,

[03:15] the deeper that ditch is.

[03:17] And they're gonna have to make magical games

[03:19] to fly out of that ditch and find customers.

[03:23] And that's a really exciting thing.

[03:25] It's also gonna make or break a lot of these companies.

[03:27] So Stern Pinball, do we think they've increased the bomb?

[03:31] Are we gonna see more games like Godzilla?

[03:34] Rush didn't have as much as Godzilla had in it.

[03:38] I think we're gonna see Stern Pinball

[03:39] release some very impressive machines over the next year.

[03:42] And so what is next from Stern?

[03:44] So George Gomez is working on James Bond.

[03:47] And I expect George Gomez's James Bond to be pretty awesome.

[03:51] I think it's definitely gonna be based

[03:53] on the older James Bond franchise.

[03:55] Probably maybe Sean Connery

[03:58] and Roger Moore James Bond era films.

[04:01] I don't think we're gonna see the newer James Bond,

[04:03] which is fine.

[04:04] That is the challenge with James Bond

[04:06] is there's just so many films.

[04:08] What do you make, right?

[04:10] Now look, do I think James Bond

[04:12] is gonna be a smash hit for everybody?

[04:14] I don't really know.

[04:16] It's hard for me to know

[04:17] because I think James Bond appeals

[04:19] to the older pinball demographic.

[04:21] Like I grew up watching these James Bond movies,

[04:24] but how many of you out there have continued

[04:26] to watch these James Bond movies over the years?

[04:30] And sometimes I think it's more challenging

[04:32] to make a pinball machine

[04:33] when you have too much source material, right?

[04:36] You have too many movies

[04:37] and it's almost hard to sort of land the plane.

[04:40] I actually like it when a pinball machine

[04:42] only has to make like one movie in pinball form,

[04:46] like The Big Lebowski or Willy Wonka, right?

[04:49] It can be done.

[04:50] It can be done.

[04:51] Like Lord of the Rings is great

[04:52] and that's three movies in one game.

[04:54] And that is probably the most brilliant game

[04:57] that took three films that were three hours long each

[05:01] and made it work.

[05:02] But for the most part,

[05:04] I think sometimes it's a struggle

[05:05] for these designers to make a game

[05:07] when they have too much to pull from.

[05:09] So I think James Bond is gonna be a game

[05:11] that appeals to the older demographic of pinball.

[05:14] I think George Gomez is one of the best designers

[05:17] of all time.

[05:18] I fully expect George Gomez

[05:19] to make this game pretty special.

[05:21] And I also fully expect there to be some clunkiness

[05:25] because that's always a thing with Gomez designs.

[05:27] There is always a little bit of the clunkiness in them.

[05:30] We saw it in Deadpool.

[05:32] So I hope this game doesn't have it,

[05:33] but it seems like George always has a little clunkiness

[05:37] in the flow of his games.

[05:39] So when are we gonna see James Bond?

[05:40] So the two games I keep hearing are next

[05:42] are James Bond and Venom.

[05:44] So Venom is coming from Brian Eddy.

[05:47] It's got Zambietti on artwork,

[05:49] and it is comic book Venom.

[05:51] It is not the movie Venom.

[05:53] And I am hearing that this game is still on.

[05:55] They are still going to make it.

[05:57] And so Venom, I think, is going to be the next title.

[06:00] I think we're gonna see Venom sometime in August or September.

[06:04] And then I think we're gonna see James Bond revealed

[06:07] by the end of the year.

[06:08] I don't think we're gonna see what's next

[06:10] from Keith Elwin this year.

[06:11] I also don't think we're gonna see

[06:13] Jack Danger's first Cornerstone game.

[06:15] And do I think Venom's gonna be a smash hit?

[06:18] I don't know, you know, Venom's another weird one, right?

[06:20] Think about how at the opposite ends of the spectrum,

[06:23] James Bond and Venom are.

[06:26] But that just goes to show why Sturmpinball is so successful.

[06:29] They give something for everyone.

[06:32] And if you like comic books and you like Spider-Man,

[06:35] of course you're gonna like Venom.

[06:37] They don't care if one title doesn't appeal to you

[06:41] because they know when they do four games a year

[06:44] or three games a year and every four months

[06:46] there's a new game, they know they're eventually

[06:49] going to make a theme you want.

[06:51] And at Sturmpinball, it's not about the themes.

[06:53] It's just keep the line going, keep making games.

[06:57] See, Sturm can put out a game.

[06:58] And even if it only sells 2,000 units,

[07:01] it doesn't matter because they're on to the next

[07:03] and they've made all their money with the LE sales

[07:05] just to begin with and pay for all the development

[07:08] and then they're on to the next.

[07:09] Now, if the game hits, then they're gonna make like

[07:11] five to 6,000 of them and they'll keep making premiums

[07:14] for years.

[07:15] It's such a smart business model

[07:18] and no one has done it better than them.

[07:19] So I think Venom is gonna also be a title

[07:22] that's not gonna light the world on fire.

[07:24] It's a little bit obscure for a lot of people

[07:26] but we will see.

[07:27] Well, Brian Eddy finally give us like a mech

[07:30] we've been waiting for.

[07:31] That's my main thing with Brian Eddy.

[07:32] The guy made the medieval madness castle.

[07:35] He knows how to make these games sing.

[07:38] I hope Brian Eddy finally makes something engineering wise.

[07:41] That's impressive.

[07:43] I think Mandalorian was a total miss.

[07:45] I think the mechs in Mandalorian were uninspired

[07:48] and I'm hoping he does something fun with Venom.

[07:51] All right, so after these two games,

[07:53] I'm hearing that Keith Elwin's Jaws is down the road.

[07:56] Now, Keith Elwin's team is the greatest team

[07:59] in pinball right now and I really do think it's Jaws.

[08:02] I don't think Jaws is a metaphor for something else.

[08:04] And so I think Jaws is gonna be a huge hit

[08:08] because if you think about the movie

[08:10] and you think about the theme of Jaws

[08:12] and hunting this great white shark,

[08:15] it is going to be the perfect theme for pinball.

[08:18] Now, I don't think they're gonna get any assets

[08:20] from the movie other than the theme song and the shark.

[08:24] Right, the dun-un, dun-un, dun-un.

[08:27] And if this game does not have a shark

[08:29] that comes up from underneath the play field,

[08:32] that eats the ball, then what are we even doing here?

[08:36] I keep saying like the greatest shot ever in pinball could be

[08:39] and this needs to happen in this game.

[08:41] There needs to be a shark that comes up

[08:43] from underneath the play field

[08:44] and it's got like the what, the yellow oxygen tank

[08:47] in its mouth and you get one shot to hit it and blow it up.

[08:52] If you miss the shot, you lose.

[08:54] That's it, game over.

[08:56] I think more pinball machines need to have a moment

[08:59] in a game where that's it.

[09:01] Like you either hit it and win or the game is over.

[09:04] There's too much of like you miss the final thing.

[09:07] You can't beat the final boss character

[09:09] and then the game keeps going.

[09:11] Why don't pinball machines have that moment?

[09:13] Like you get it?

[09:14] Here's your chance to show your ultimate skill

[09:17] and if you don't hit it, game over,

[09:18] you have to start over again.

[09:20] I wish there was more of that instead of you just keep going,

[09:22] just keep going, just keep getting multipliers

[09:24] and stacking stuff even though the storyline

[09:27] just told you you failed at the very end.

[09:29] Keith Elwin's Jaws is gonna be a juggernaut.

[09:31] Anything Keith Elwin puts out, he's got the Midas touch.

[09:35] It's gonna sell like hotcakes.

[09:37] I think Keith Elwin's game is gonna be the game

[09:40] that comes out in March, April.

[09:42] I think this is gonna be the game we see at TPF.

[09:45] I think this is gonna be the big first game of 2023

[09:48] from Stern Pinball and so look for that.

[09:51] Now, Jack Danger is also making a game, right?

[09:54] They've got so many designers, Jack Danger

[09:56] and John Borg is already working on his next game

[09:59] and he's been working on it for a while.

[10:01] I don't know what John Borg's next title is

[10:03] but here's my guess.

[10:04] I think that Jack Danger's game is going to be either

[10:08] He-Man Masters of the Universe or Foo Fighters.

[10:12] So those are the two games that I think he's working on.

[10:15] I think I would rather see He-Man Masters of the Universe

[10:19] than Foo Fighters.

[10:20] I actually have no interest in Foo Fighters.

[10:22] I know some of you like them.

[10:24] I don't get the appeal.

[10:25] I don't, I try to listen to them.

[10:27] It's not that exciting to me

[10:29] but I understand they have millions of fans

[10:31] and Stern does this.

[10:32] They understand, again, all they care about

[10:34] is selling a few thousand of Foo Fighter fans.

[10:36] They will achieve that goal.

[10:38] Now, He-Man Masters of the Universe.

[10:40] The reason why I'm excited about this pin

[10:42] is Castle Grayskull and He-Man and I've got the power

[10:46] and you've got Skeletor, you've got many faces,

[10:49] you've got all the different characters from the show

[10:52] but for He-Man to work,

[10:53] here's the thing, it better not be based

[10:55] on the new Netflix He-Man.

[10:57] They need to base it on the original TV show

[11:00] and they need clips from it.

[11:01] It's also like, I hear people say this,

[11:03] the same, we're gonna talk about Scooby-Doo

[11:05] in a little bit, but I hear people say like,

[11:07] why are we going back to these kids' cartoons?

[11:11] The reason why is that nostalgia sells

[11:14] and the reason why all of us have an emotional appeal

[11:17] to some of this stuff but I also do agree

[11:20] a lot of us have grown out of these properties.

[11:22] I think Ninja Turtles was a good example of that.

[11:25] When it finally came out, I think a lot of us were like,

[11:28] I'm a grown adult, I really don't care about Ninja Turtles,

[11:31] I don't want these kiddie themes.

[11:33] And I would say that there are more people

[11:35] that don't want these kiddie themes

[11:37] or cartoons from the 80s than there are buyers, okay?

[11:41] And if you're gonna go after like 80s cartoons,

[11:44] I still think the ones we need are Transformers and G.I. Joe.

[11:48] It's like, start there because both of those properties

[11:51] were more mature for their time and they were just cooler.

[11:55] Like Transformers G1 and G.I. Joe,

[11:57] much cooler than He-Man Masters of the Universe.

[12:00] So we shall see, but I think Jack Danger is working on those

[12:04] and this is gonna be interesting to see what Jack brings.

[12:07] Now I've been talking to Jack off the record, right?

[12:09] And I don't share our private conversations,

[12:12] but I will share this.

[12:13] Jack is feeling some of the pressure and I'll explain why.

[12:17] He's reading how we're tearing a Pat Lawler game

[12:22] and he knows that when he releases a game,

[12:25] he's cross the Rubicon and he's gonna either be praised

[12:29] or like insulted and it's really hard, right?

[12:32] You don't wanna make a game that's mediocre.

[12:34] I think that's the biggest fear of every designer

[12:37] or any artist in general.

[12:39] You never wanna make something

[12:41] where people are just apathetic about it.

[12:43] You want to get a reaction and it's really hard in Pimball,

[12:46] like to get that uber positive universal reaction

[12:49] that everyone loves it.

[12:51] Eric Miniers felt that, Keith Elwyn is felt that.

[12:54] You know, all the great designers out there

[12:56] have had those games that when they release them,

[12:58] everyone for the most part loves them.

[13:01] And I think no one's getting that love more now

[13:03] than Keith Elwyn and I think it's rightfully deserved.

[13:06] But we shall see if Jack Danger can hit it out of the park.

[13:09] Okay, so here's what I think is gonna happen.

[13:11] I think it's gonna go Venom, James Bond, Jaws

[13:15] and then He-Man or Foo Fighters.

[13:17] So that's Stern Pimball.

[13:18] All right, what is next from Jersey Jack Pimball?

[13:20] So we are hearing that Jersey Jack

[13:22] might release another game this year.

[13:24] I don't see it happening.

[13:25] Here's why I don't see it happening.

[13:26] It might happen, but here's why I don't think so.

[13:28] Because they still need to build all these toy stories.

[13:30] And so the hard part for them is this now,

[13:32] if they are building the toy stories in Q3, Q4,

[13:36] like October, September, October, right?

[13:38] And then how are they gonna release another game

[13:41] if they have not built every single CE of toy story?

[13:45] The problem is I don't think the optics are good

[13:48] if they show another game

[13:50] and you've got a thousand people that are locked in

[13:52] for a $15,000 toy story,

[13:55] I think it's gonna create a real dilemma for them

[13:58] because what if those people see the new game

[14:00] and they want it more?

[14:01] Because you made them wait too long.

[14:03] Remember people, when Stern releases a title,

[14:06] they make a few pros,

[14:08] they might put a few premiums on location,

[14:11] but they get every single LE built within two months.

[14:15] And there's a reason why they do that.

[14:17] They don't want anyone to see the next title

[14:20] before every single LE is made and shipped to customers.

[14:25] And it's a strategic decision and it works

[14:28] because you don't want people to change their mind,

[14:31] you don't want them to see something they'd rather have

[14:33] because you don't want them to feel disappointed

[14:36] if they're spending this much money with your company.

[14:39] You have to do it that way.

[14:40] I really think Jersey Jack made a mistake

[14:42] by not putting these CEs on the line right away

[14:46] by the time they make them,

[14:48] I think there's gonna be a lot of people

[14:49] that are either satisfied with an LE,

[14:52] they might not want it anymore,

[14:54] or they might see CEs trading for below 15,000.

[14:58] But I think what's next from Jersey Jack

[15:00] is gonna be Eric Minier's godfather.

[15:03] For some reason, the JJP rumors always come true.

[15:06] No one's ever really wrong.

[15:08] Once we start hearing stuff from multiple places,

[15:11] it's usually true.

[15:12] So I think it's gonna be Eric Minier's godfather

[15:14] and I can't, for the life of me,

[15:16] understand how he's gonna make this game amazing

[15:19] because it's such a weird theme for pinball.

[15:22] If you go watch the godfather movies this weekend,

[15:25] you will walk away and say,

[15:27] there is no way that you can make godfather into pinball

[15:31] and make it exciting because it's a slow drama.

[15:35] I don't know how they're gonna do it.

[15:37] I don't even know what the mechs would be.

[15:39] I don't even know what the clips would be.

[15:41] I don't even know how you get exciting callouts.

[15:44] Every line in that movie is like a whisper

[15:47] or a very soft, delivered line

[15:51] that's supposed to put fear in you.

[15:53] Pinball is fast-paced.

[15:55] Pinball is high energy.

[15:57] Pinball is high action.

[15:58] It's this incredibly fast-paced kinetic game.

[16:02] Godfather is the complete opposite.

[16:05] So if it is that, we shall see.

[16:07] The other rumor I heard is that this game

[16:09] is gonna show people that Eric Minier

[16:11] can design a game with flow and speed.

[16:14] So I expect this game to be pretty wide open.

[16:17] The quagmire now for Jersey Jack Pinball

[16:19] is if it's not packed,

[16:22] I think they're gonna be in trouble

[16:24] if 12 to 15K is the baseline

[16:27] for all of their games moving forward.

[16:29] But if there's any hope

[16:31] that someone over at JJP can pack a game,

[16:34] it's Eric Minier.

[16:35] So we shall see because the Pat Lawler period is over.

[16:39] But we both know that Pat influenced this game.

[16:42] He had to have.

[16:43] He's not gone yet.

[16:45] And so I think we're gonna see a game

[16:47] that's gonna be pretty wide open.

[16:49] I expect it to be somewhat barren.

[16:51] And I expect it if it is Godfather

[16:53] to be a theme that lands

[16:55] with lukewarm response at best.

[16:57] And I don't know if Jersey Jack

[16:59] can handle two misses in a row,

[17:02] especially at these price points.

[17:04] So we shall see.

[17:05] Now, where it gets more exciting

[17:07] is after Godfather, if you ask me.

[17:10] Because what's coming from Jersey Jack after this

[17:13] is Steve Richie's music pin,

[17:15] which I'm gonna let you know what it is real soon.

[17:18] But I'll just tell you this.

[17:19] It's a great theme for pinball.

[17:22] It's the right music for pinball.

[17:24] It's the right high energy for pinball.

[17:27] It's almost comical that they might go

[17:29] from Godfather to this act.

[17:32] And I think this game is going to be a hit.

[17:35] I think it's a band that has so many fans

[17:38] and so many hits and has remained relevant

[17:40] over the decades.

[17:41] Are they as cool as Guns N' Roses?

[17:43] No, but nobody's as cool as Guns N' Roses.

[17:47] But I fully expect Steve Richie's music pin

[17:50] to be a hit for Jersey Jack pinball.

[17:52] Now, after his game is Mark Satan's Matrix.

[17:56] So that is what he's making people.

[17:57] Like I'm here to tell you right now

[17:59] that the Matrix is coming out from Jersey Jack pinball.

[18:02] I mean, I'm hearing from my very good sources

[18:04] they have the Matrix license

[18:06] and that is what Mark is working on.

[18:09] You know, and I think everyone just wants them

[18:11] to make the first movie or the first three movies.

[18:14] If this game is Matrix four

[18:16] and they inked a deal for Matrix resurrections,

[18:20] it's over.

[18:21] Like it's over.

[18:22] Like you can't do it.

[18:23] At least Toy Story four was like a good movie.

[18:26] It wasn't our favorite, but it's critically acclaimed

[18:29] and it got like a 97 on Rod and Tomatoes.

[18:33] But Matrix resurrections is so bad

[18:36] that I started watching it and I had to turn it off.

[18:40] It's that bad.

[18:41] Like it is not good at all.

[18:44] I would also argue that the third Matrix movie

[18:47] is also terrible.

[18:49] And what happened with Matrix,

[18:50] it's like the first movie was groundbreaking and incredible.

[18:54] The second movie teed up all of this interesting

[18:56] philosophical stuff that we thought the third movie

[18:59] would pay off and it didn't pay off any of it.

[19:02] It was just a stupid like action flick

[19:04] that absolutely I think destroyed

[19:07] what the first movie created.

[19:09] So if you're gonna make the Matrix,

[19:10] just make it based on the first movie.

[19:14] But I think what has everybody really nervous

[19:16] is Jersey Jack always finds a way

[19:18] to make licensing mistakes.

[19:20] Like they never really get the licensing right.

[19:23] And it's weird to me when Jack gets up there

[19:24] and says we always get everything for our games.

[19:27] It's like the complete opposite.

[19:29] It's like they never get everything for their games

[19:31] but we'll see what happens.

[19:32] But that's what's gonna happen.

[19:33] Godfather, major music pin,

[19:36] and then we're gonna have the Matrix.

[19:38] Okay, Spooky Pinball, their next game is Scooby-Doo.

[19:41] Like 100% confirmed.

[19:43] Scooby-Doo, it is happening.

[19:44] We might see a few TNAs run again,

[19:47] like in the new cabinet, TNA 2.0, they're calling it.

[19:50] And I think they probably will run like 250 TNA 2.0s.

[19:56] They'll probably price them around $10,000.

[19:58] So if you want a TNA, it's coming.

[20:01] Like they're making TNA 2.0.

[20:03] And then they're moving on to Scooby-Doo.

[20:05] So here's what I heard about Scooby-Doo.

[20:07] I heard that they've heard all of the feedback

[20:10] on these two games right now.

[20:11] I know they are bummed out that they disappointed

[20:14] so many people on these two titles.

[20:16] And I am hearing that Scooby-Doo is absolutely packed.

[20:21] That Spooky Pinball wants to show you what they can do.

[20:25] Now look, you know this and I know this.

[20:27] I don't believe it until I see it.

[20:30] This game is not gonna be bought sight unseen anymore.

[20:33] Spooky Pinball needs to do the following

[20:36] to win back the goodwill of us.

[20:38] And Scooby-Doo as a theme for Spooky is perfect.

[20:41] I know some people don't like it.

[20:42] It is the perfect theme for a company called Spooky Pinball.

[20:46] And I think it's a lot of fun.

[20:48] It's the right kind of campy humor.

[20:50] It's absolutely perfect for Pinball.

[20:52] But what they need to do next time around,

[20:54] they need to have the code pretty much complete

[20:57] when they show the game.

[20:58] They need to make sure the design of the game is spot on

[21:02] and they need to let us see this game

[21:04] and let people play the game

[21:06] before they ask for non-refundable deposits.

[21:08] This is how Spooky needs to get the goodwill back.

[21:11] They burned everybody with Ultraman and Halloween.

[21:13] They did.

[21:14] They really burned everybody.

[21:15] They willingly didn't show you the game

[21:18] because they knew how unfinished it was

[21:21] and they got everybody to put deposits down

[21:24] because we had faith in them and we got burned.

[21:28] And I know we can't really blame them

[21:30] because nobody made us do it, but we had faith in them.

[21:34] And I think for them to get the faith back,

[21:36] they need to show Scooby-Doo, show us why it's amazing,

[21:39] let people play it and say it's amazing

[21:42] and then open the order banks.

[21:44] I think that's the way to go.

[21:46] So Spooky's got to get themselves out of the ditch.

[21:48] They're in their own ditch.

[21:50] But their ditch is like people have moved on

[21:52] and they've lost all of that goodwill

[21:54] they built up over the years.

[21:55] And it just goes to show in this hobby,

[21:58] at these prices, you're only as good as your last game,

[22:02] especially for these boutiques.

[22:03] Like if you look at Spooky Pinball,

[22:04] they're only as good as their last game

[22:06] because the only thing you can buy is their last game.

[22:09] They're not gonna rerun America's Most Haunted.

[22:11] They're not gonna rerun Rob Zombie.

[22:13] They're not gonna rerun Rick and Morty.

[22:14] Probably the worst business decision they ever made

[22:17] was to get the hottest license they'll ever have,

[22:20] Rick and Morty, and they would say this,

[22:23] idiotically limit Rick and Morty production to 750.

[22:29] Charlie could have sold 7,000 Rick and Morty's.

[22:32] I mean it, he probably could have sold 7,000 Rick and Morty's

[22:35] over a 10 year period if he just kept it on the line

[22:39] and remade them every once in a while.

[22:41] That's what's next from Spooky Pinball.

[22:43] Let's go to Chicago Gaming Company.

[22:45] So they're still trickling out the Cactus Canyon remakes.

[22:48] The LDS are gonna be on the line soon.

[22:50] But this is about what's next.

[22:52] So what's next from them is Pulp Fiction.

[22:55] And we've heard about this Mark Richie game forever.

[22:58] It's a single level game.

[23:00] And I think this game is gonna come out

[23:03] and it's gonna be like, what?

[23:05] Like what is this?

[23:06] Like it's gonna be kinda like the Beatles,

[23:08] but it's gonna be single level.

[23:10] It's not gonna have any ramps.

[23:11] It's not gonna have like a lot of toys in it.

[23:14] And I think it's gonna be a miss.

[23:16] I do.

[23:16] I think it's gonna be a miss.

[23:18] I think it's gonna look cool.

[23:19] I think it's gonna sound cool.

[23:22] But there is no way around the fact

[23:24] that pinball and modern pinball

[23:27] needs to have more modern stuff in it.

[23:30] And for it to be a truly rewarding pinball experience,

[23:34] we want more.

[23:36] Like I get it.

[23:37] Like you could have a single level game

[23:39] and single level games can be fun.

[23:42] But a movie like Pulp Fiction

[23:44] deserve to have a full featured game.

[23:47] I think the way they're gonna combat

[23:49] the fact that it's single level,

[23:51] I do think they're gonna make it scarce.

[23:53] I think they're gonna make it rare.

[23:54] And I think they're gonna have a high price tag.

[23:56] And I think they're gonna try to make it more

[23:58] like a work of art.

[24:00] I think that's what this thing is gonna be.

[24:02] Like a Pulp Fiction movie poster that you can play,

[24:06] but it's really meant to just be

[24:08] like this cool throwback looking thing.

[24:10] It's confusing to me because Pulp Fiction

[24:12] didn't take place in the 70s.

[24:14] When you look at Pulp Fiction,

[24:15] it looks like it took place in the 90s.

[24:17] And if it took place in the 90s,

[24:19] the pinball machines of the 90s

[24:22] were fully featured multi-level games.

[24:24] And so it's just weird to me that it's like a throwback,

[24:27] but the movie's not a throwback.

[24:29] Like it made sense that the Beatles was a throwback pin

[24:32] because it was based on the Beatles from the 60s.

[24:34] So really confusing that they did it this way.

[24:37] And I know that Tarantino wanted it that way,

[24:39] but they should have said Quinton.

[24:41] What are you thinking, man?

[24:43] That doesn't make any sense and let us explain why.

[24:46] So after this is Ben Hex game.

[24:49] Now look, Ben Hex keeps telling me

[24:51] that they're letting him put all this stuff into the game.

[24:54] And I feel like the years are going on and on and on

[24:57] and we're no closer to this game.

[24:59] Ben Hex has made one game in pinball.

[25:02] America's most haunted.

[25:04] Arguably one of the ugliest games,

[25:05] but probably Spooky's best shooter to date.

[25:08] I mean it, it's probably the best shooting game at Spooky,

[25:11] but the art package and it was their first effort.

[25:14] So the question is, will Ben Hex be able to show us

[25:16] he's capable of making a game at the caliber, right?

[25:20] Of our designers of these days.

[25:21] And I hope so.

[25:22] I hope so.

[25:23] Ben gets it.

[25:24] Ben is a very smart guy.

[25:26] He knows what people want.

[25:28] He is dialed into this hobby very well.

[25:31] And so I expect this game to be good.

[25:33] What is the theme?

[25:35] I think, and I'm just guessing here,

[25:37] I think it's gonna be Evil Dead.

[25:38] I really do.

[25:39] I think it's gonna be Evil Dead.

[25:41] I might be wrong.

[25:43] I don't know if that's the case,

[25:45] but I think we just need to get an Evil Dead game out

[25:48] for all the Evil Dead fans out there

[25:50] and just satiate and scratch that itch.

[25:52] If it's not Evil Dead,

[25:54] I could see this being something like a Monty Python game,

[25:57] like something along those lines.

[25:59] But the real question is like,

[26:00] I don't even know when this game is gonna come out,

[26:02] because I'm also hearing that they're gonna remake

[26:05] Twilight Zone.

[26:06] Like that's gonna be the next official remake

[26:09] from Chicago Gaming Company.

[26:11] The problem with CGC,

[26:12] they really are on no schedule whatsoever.

[26:16] It's really hard to get excited

[26:18] about Chicago Gaming Company.

[26:19] Out of all the pinball companies out there,

[26:21] they're the one where you kind of get excited

[26:23] and then like three years go by and you're like,

[26:25] wait, where is the game?

[26:27] And that's what they've been like.

[26:28] I also expect them to do another run of medieval madness.

[26:31] Like they're gonna do it.

[26:32] Like they absolutely are gonna do it.

[26:34] And you're gonna see all those people

[26:36] who spent all that money on the Royal Editions

[26:39] kicking themselves if you paid 20 grand for one,

[26:42] because they're gonna rerun it.

[26:43] And then you can just buy this stuff that makes it Royal.

[26:45] Like it's so weird the way the Royal people went nuts

[26:48] when you could just powder code your game

[26:50] and then put the topper and everything else on it.

[26:52] And voila, you've got the exact same game.

[26:55] We've got CGC, we've got Twilight Zone coming,

[26:58] we've got Pulp Fiction and we've got Ben Hex game.

[27:01] Let's go on to Multimorphic.

[27:03] So Multimorphic, here's the deal.

[27:04] This is gonna be real short.

[27:05] He's gotta get the weird owls made.

[27:07] It's gonna take Jerry all of this year

[27:09] and all of next year.

[27:10] I mean this, all of next year to make these weird owls.

[27:14] Like it takes them two years to make like 400 games.

[27:17] So I don't think we're gonna see another license pin

[27:20] from P3 Multimorphic for like another 18 months at least.

[27:25] And I'm hearing no rumors

[27:27] about any future licenses coming onto the platform.

[27:30] And so I have nothing else to report

[27:32] other than it's gonna be all about

[27:34] building weird owl for them.

[27:35] All right, next is Dutch Pinball.

[27:37] So Dutch Pinball, they're gonna keep making

[27:39] the big Lebowski's.

[27:40] And I talked to Barry and they have no set limit

[27:43] on how many they're gonna make.

[27:44] I don't think they have another game in development.

[27:47] I don't know, like right,

[27:48] who's gonna help Dutch Pinball secure a license?

[27:51] And who's gonna pre-order a game from this company

[27:55] until they make every EA hole?

[27:57] There is no way they can even announce another game.

[28:01] And to get every EA hole,

[28:03] I think we're still another maybe two years away from that.

[28:06] I'm happy they're getting it done.

[28:08] I hope every EA gets a game.

[28:11] But Dutch Pinball sadly cannot release another game

[28:14] until they accomplish that feat.

[28:16] And why it's sad to me is I still to this day,

[28:19] I think Barry is one of the greatest pinball designers

[28:22] and one of the most creative minds

[28:24] we've ever seen in pinball.

[28:25] And I'm saying is based on just one game,

[28:28] but if you look at that game,

[28:30] I really wanna see what he can do next.

[28:33] Like I would rather have him make back to the future

[28:37] than half the people over at Stern.

[28:39] I mean, I would just love to see this guy do something.

[28:41] He should go get a license like Teen Wolf.

[28:43] Right, no one ever talks about Teen Wolf.

[28:45] How cool would a Teen Wolf pinball machine be?

[28:47] I don't know, I don't know.

[28:48] Now that I say it, maybe it's not that cool,

[28:49] but you know what I mean?

[28:50] Everybody would love to see if Barry could follow up

[28:53] the big Lebowski with something equally as magic

[28:57] and creative and inspired as that game is.

[29:00] All right, next let's go to Home Pin with Spinal Tap,

[29:02] a game that they just are afraid to show us.

[29:05] So I think Spinal Tap is it, I do.

[29:07] I think after Spinal Tap and after nobody buys it,

[29:10] I think Home Pin is gonna be pretty much done.

[29:13] I think they might transition their business

[29:15] into making pinball parts.

[29:17] That's probably the smarter play for Mike

[29:19] because when it comes to putting the whole game together,

[29:21] he just doesn't have it, but if he were smart

[29:25] and he's making games with cheaper labor,

[29:27] then he should just make the coils and make other things

[29:30] and sell them to all the pinball companies.

[29:32] And I think that's gonna be the future of Home Pin.

[29:35] I think Spinal Tap's gonna come out.

[29:37] I think everyone's gonna rag on it.

[29:38] I think the sales are gonna be like abysmal

[29:41] and I don't know how you then move on to another game.

[29:44] If you ask me, it's crazy that he survived Thunderbirds.

[29:47] So if you can survive Thunderbirds,

[29:49] then maybe he can survive another flop.

[29:51] All right, after Home Pin,

[29:52] we have a company that's actually getting it done

[29:54] and that's the Pinball Brothers.

[29:56] I think I saw on Naps Arcade that they've made 500 aliens

[29:59] and the Pinball Brothers are getting it done

[30:01] and they are going to release Queen

[30:03] and we've already seen it.

[30:04] That's the funny part about Queen.

[30:06] We've already seen it.

[30:07] Now, do they have a pinball machine

[30:09] after Queen in development?

[30:12] I probably think they do, but I'm not sure what it is.

[30:16] I can't even speculate what it is.

[30:18] Now, I do think Queen is gonna be underwhelming.

[30:22] It looks dated.

[30:23] I don't think it's gonna do that well, but it's Queen.

[30:26] So they will get some sales.

[30:28] The problem with them is how long it takes to get it.

[30:32] And I think people don't wanna send money

[30:34] and wait a year to get a game,

[30:36] but you know what?

[30:37] I'm proven wrong by all of you Haggis buyers out there.

[30:40] All right, let's go on to Haggis real quick.

[30:41] So Haggis has Fathom.

[30:43] Now, what is next from Haggis?

[30:45] This is another company that's gonna take an entire year.

[30:49] I think there is no way Damien is gonna build

[30:52] all the Fathoms by the end of the year.

[30:53] That's what he said.

[30:55] That's what he told people.

[30:56] We all know that's not happening.

[30:59] I still think he makes every game.

[31:01] If you ordered a Fathom, you're gonna get it.

[31:04] Now, the next game from this company is not another remake.

[31:08] It's Marty Robbins' original IP game.

[31:12] And I'm telling you right now,

[31:13] I'm just telling you right now.

[31:14] I don't know what it is, but if I were a betting man,

[31:18] I would bet that this is gonna be a really, really hard sell.

[31:23] And I'm not sure if Marty is good or bad.

[31:25] I haven't seen his design, so I can't rag on it,

[31:28] but I do know this.

[31:30] Who is Marty Robbins learning from over there?

[31:34] If you look at Keltz and what they designed originally,

[31:38] it's pretty pedestrian.

[31:39] And at these prices, you can't just release

[31:42] a pedestrian pin and people aren't gonna buy it

[31:45] just to support you.

[31:46] So I think this is a huge gamble for Haggis Pinball.

[31:50] I think it's probably not gonna work out.

[31:53] And I think by the time this game comes out,

[31:55] I don't know how you sell it.

[31:57] I don't know how you sell someone

[31:59] on an original game from a brand new designer.

[32:02] You know, I don't know how you sell someone on it.

[32:04] So I think it's a huge gamble.

[32:05] I think the safe bet is if Damian

[32:08] just keeps making these remakes, right?

[32:10] You sold people on four to five games, right?

[32:12] That series ticket holder.

[32:14] If I were him, I would just get all those made.

[32:16] Like just do it.

[32:18] Like fish where the fish are, no pun intended, Fathom.

[32:21] But just fish where the fish are.

[32:22] Make games you know people want.

[32:24] Make games that you know have a following.

[32:27] I think Marty Robbins' game could be

[32:29] what collapses this whole dream.

[32:31] All right, I forgot American Pinball.

[32:33] Like I was going through the company's American Pinball.

[32:36] So American Pinball, they're making all their legends

[32:38] of Vahalas, demand on that game is completely dried up.

[32:41] If you got one, congratulations,

[32:43] you just lost like probably $1,000.

[32:45] And by the end of the year, you will lose $2,000.

[32:48] But the game is fun, Canadian, the game is fun.

[32:50] Okay, we don't care about this game anymore.

[32:52] I wanna talk about what's next.

[32:53] So it is the big game over at American Pinball.

[32:56] It is the Dennis Nordman game.

[32:59] This is the game that Christopher Francis working on.

[33:02] And he keeps saying like wait until October.

[33:05] Now here's the thing.

[33:06] I don't think they're gonna get it out in October.

[33:08] American Pinball never hits a deadline.

[33:12] They never stay on schedule.

[33:15] Why would it be different?

[33:16] This time also, they didn't tell us October.

[33:19] There's no release date.

[33:20] They can't be late on a game they didn't set

[33:22] a release date for.

[33:24] I think this game, if I'm just going off

[33:26] of what Franchi's been saying with his hyperbole,

[33:29] you know, I don't know what the theme is, right?

[33:31] I'm just going off of Franchi's excitement.

[33:33] I feel like Franchi has his hand on the pulse

[33:36] of what gets people excited in pinball.

[33:38] I think he knows what people want.

[33:41] I just still think that an original IP game is really hard.

[33:46] But I do think what Dennis Nordman is gonna bring

[33:49] is a game that reminds us of the magic of the 90s.

[33:53] That is what I'm expecting from this game.

[33:55] I do think this game is on everyone's radar.

[33:58] Now, for it to work, it needs to be packed.

[34:02] It needs to be fun.

[34:04] It needs to be campy.

[34:05] It needs to be quirky, right?

[34:07] And they need, like we need a game with personality.

[34:10] I think that's the thing, right?

[34:11] When you play a game like Whitewater,

[34:14] like how cool is that game?

[34:15] Like imagine Whitewater with modern code.

[34:18] Not that it even needs it, but imagine that.

[34:21] And I think that's what people want.

[34:23] They wanna look down at this game

[34:25] and be transported into a really fun, campy world

[34:28] that you can't wait to shoot.

[34:30] They don't wanna look down and see a big iPad.

[34:33] They don't wanna look down and see like screens.

[34:36] They wanna look down and see a physical world

[34:38] to interact with.

[34:40] And we know Dennis Nordman is great at doing that.

[34:44] So I'm super excited for this game.

[34:46] I can't even speculate what the theme is.

[34:48] It's not Sherlock Holmes.

[34:50] It's not Valkyrie.

[34:52] I have no idea what it is.

[34:54] You know what I would love it to be?

[34:56] I would love it to be King Kong.

[34:59] I think King Kong would be the greatest theme

[35:02] for a company like American Pinball to make.

[35:05] I think you make it based on the black and white Kong.

[35:08] And imagine how cool that would be.

[35:10] The old Empire State Building and like New York City.

[35:13] How cool would it be if like the lower half of the game

[35:16] was like the jungle and then the upper play field

[35:18] was like New York City with the Empire State Building.

[35:21] And it comes up from underneath the play field.

[35:22] Like how cool would that be?

[35:24] And then you've got the airplanes spinning around it.

[35:26] You gotta hit the airplanes with the pinball.

[35:28] It could be amazing.

[35:29] Now after Nordman's game,

[35:31] I think AP is a big question mark.

[35:33] Like do you really think Ryan McQuaid

[35:35] is working on something right now?

[35:37] I mean, they must still be trying to figure out

[35:39] what to do with Ryan now that they lost Sonic the Hedgehog

[35:42] to Stern Pinball.

[35:43] So everything for AP rides on this game.

[35:46] And I know it and they know it.

[35:47] Mukesh and Rob Burke, they're invested in this thing.

[35:50] They gave David Fix money to steer the ship

[35:53] in the right direction.

[35:54] I don't know if it's going in the right direction.

[35:56] I'm also hearing they're doing another riot game.

[36:00] I really hope they don't make Wrath of Olympus.

[36:02] I'm just giving David Fix some free advice.

[36:05] Do not make Wrath of Olympus.

[36:08] If you're gonna make another riot game,

[36:11] I hope it's Riot's next game and it's new.

[36:15] Let's stop going back to the Riot portfolio.

[36:18] If people really wanted Wrath of Olympus,

[36:21] they would have bought it years ago when it was available.

[36:24] There's no more demand for something now.

[36:27] All right, I think I concluded it all, right?

[36:29] I think that was it.

[36:30] I mean, there's like some ball of Rama

[36:32] and there's like Honey Factory,

[36:34] Pinball Hoops game coming out of Europe.

[36:36] But for the most part, like these are the games.

[36:39] These are the games that are coming down the pipeline.

[36:41] I think the big ones, when you ask me,

[36:43] the big ones over the next year and a half

[36:45] are gonna be Jaws, James Bond, The Matrix.

[36:48] I think back to the future might be a possibility.

[36:51] I didn't even talk about that,

[36:52] but someone's making it and it's probably Joe Kamikau.

[36:55] And so I think there's gonna be a lot of big games coming.

[36:58] But the big story of Pinball over the next year and a half

[37:01] is all gonna be about the pricing

[37:03] and are you getting your money's worth?

[37:05] That is gonna be the thing.

[37:06] And what excites me the most, I'll pay 10 grand.

[37:10] I'll even pay you 15 grand.

[37:12] But if you wanna take that kind of money from me,

[37:15] you've gotta give me something so damn good

[37:18] with so much magic and so much theme integration

[37:21] that I wanna bolt it to the floor of my house.

[37:25] I'm not spending 15 grand thinking about the resale.

[37:29] I'm not spending 12 grand thinking about the resale.

[37:32] I'm only buying these games if it delivers something

[37:36] that I don't wanna live without.

[37:38] And I think a lot of you are feeling that way now.

[37:41] The hobby has changed.

[37:43] The prices are crazy.

[37:45] We will only spend these crazy prices

[37:48] if the games make us go crazy.

[37:50] And I love that because the onus is on these companies now

[37:54] to make magic.

[37:55] And when they don't, the buyers are not gonna show up,

[37:58] especially at these prices.

[38:00] It's an awesome time to be in Pinball.

[38:02] Thank you all for the support.

[38:04] It means so much to me, Killian and Brenda.

[38:06] We're having such a good time here in Ireland

[38:08] and we're so happy when we look down

[38:11] and see we've got 518 subscribers.

[38:13] I'm losing a few subscribers.

[38:15] At the end of every month, I always lose about 10,

[38:18] but they always come back.

[38:19] I think there's just some people out there

[38:20] that don't wanna be billed monthly, but thank you.

[38:23] I know the bill's gonna hit your inbox

[38:25] and I'm so happy that you're showing your support.

[38:27] I love doing this show for you

[38:29] and I hope to do it for many, many more years

[38:31] and that every week you can have a little bit of Canada

[38:34] in your life.

[38:35] I think it makes Pinball more fun

[38:37] than these $15,000 games.

[38:39] I'll talk to you soon, people.

[38:40] Jump.

[38:44] Jump.

[38:48] Jump.

[38:51] Jump.
