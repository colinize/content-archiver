[00:00] It's 4.34 in the morning here in New York City and I had to wake up to a couple things.

[00:06] Okay, one is I woke up to 3 to 4, maybe 5.

[00:11] Facebook Messenger requests from me asking me if this was the next American pinball title

[00:18] and all of them listed the rumor that I heard.

[00:22] So now the cat's out of the bag people.

[00:25] I have no choice other than to just like upload the episode that articulates what the rumor

[00:32] is and let you guys decide on whether or not you think the rumor is true.

[00:37] So that's going to be following this little 4.30 statement of mine on Canadian pinball

[00:43] podcast.

[00:44] Now the entrance music is actually the same as the other episode 4.26 because as I said

[00:49] I recorded it and I decided not to air it.

[00:52] But this is the problem.

[00:53] I knew that once distributors were talking they would tell their customers and it would

[00:58] happen and it's going to make its way on the pinside.

[01:01] So I'm going to put that up now for you.

[01:03] Now the other thing I woke up to at 4 o'clock in the morning is I want to call this guy

[01:08] out by name because I am just annoyed.

[01:11] Not a lot really gets to me.

[01:14] I have really thick skin but I'm about to do a really good thing and I don't even, you

[01:19] know, a lot of people are about to do a really good thing.

[01:23] When it comes to project pinball and charity and it's December and it's the holidays

[01:28] and it's the time of year when we should think about other people and not ourselves.

[01:33] And here I got this nice big check that I can't wait to give to project pinball and I

[01:36] have to wake up and read from pinside user pinball gizzard who is calling me out saying

[01:44] that I had never had any intention to sell this game for charity that I tried to sell it

[01:50] on eBay and that the only reason I'm donating this money now is to win another Twippy

[01:55] and it's all about the coincidence of the timing.

[01:58] Now pinball gizzard I have no idea who you are and maybe you think you know me, maybe

[02:04] you think you know it's in the heart of this man but let me tell you something buddy.

[02:08] You don't know anything about me and you also if you want to find out exactly what time

[02:14] period I was going to donate this to charity.

[02:17] Why don't you go back and ask Mr. Bill Brandis how many months ago we talked about this would

[02:23] be the right thing to do with the game.

[02:25] Okay, it's about two three months ago.

[02:27] Why don't you ask Joe Newhart at pinball star when I first called him and asked him about

[02:32] the logistics of how we would do this.

[02:36] It was months ago so don't get on pinside and think you know anything about this and also

[02:41] have a sense of humor my friend.

[02:44] This is pinball.

[02:45] This is all meant to be funny if you've listened to any of my shows or read any of the big

[02:49] Lebowski eBay sales they were always intended as a joke my friend to see how much people

[02:55] would spend for this game.

[02:57] But hey the game's bought a great guy got it and money's going to charity but if you want

[03:01] to wake up and be upset and be a whino and try to drag me down with your miserable life

[03:07] it's not going to work my friend because I love my life.

[03:11] I love my wife.

[03:13] I love my bulldog and I love all my pinball podcast friends and last time I checked we've

[03:18] got a pinball podcast people really enjoy and you got nothing but a bunch of complaints

[03:23] on pinside at like one in the morning so eat that brother.

[03:27] Alright the other thing I want to implore people to do because I'm reading this stupid thread

[03:31] by that stupid guy who thinks I'm a fraud because I don't own a machine and what I'm going

[03:35] to do is I'm going to upload his picture as the image for this podcast just so you can

[03:40] see who we're dealing with because it's real easy to be a keyboard commando from behind

[03:44] the scenes and then hide out on pinside but here's what I want to implore everybody to understand

[03:50] about this hobby.

[03:51] And I just want I saw this back and forth I saw people again when crap and on the twippies

[03:56] crap and on like Zach many for for you know for having a podcast and also being in

[04:02] the tribute I just want to say people everyone needs to just calm down and enjoy this hobby.

[04:09] You know everyone's got strong personalities I get that I get that some people you know

[04:14] do shows and don't care about what they say some people do shows and have to be considered

[04:19] about what they say some people have strong relationships with people in the hobby that

[04:23] they don't want to burn and that's okay and we should respect that we shouldn't attack

[04:28] that.

[04:30] And also how many of you out there who are so critical of what other people are saying

[04:35] in their podcast and the passions they are expressing in this hobby how many of you

[04:40] out there are spending the amount of time and energy that these individuals are doing

[04:45] to just create pinball content that they're not making any money on.

[04:49] I mean Jack danger I mean he probably makes some you know with these great YouTube channel

[04:55] and his streaming on Twitch you know you got Ken Cromwell you got Slap Save you got

[04:59] Slamtill you got Canadian pinball podcast you got this week pinball pinball podcast you

[05:04] got a lot more shows out there than I haven't even mentioned loser kid pinball podcast you

[05:09] know you've got the pinball nerds podcast there's so many pinball podcasts out there the

[05:13] pinball profile electric gamers podcast you know all these people are doing this stuff

[05:18] simply because they care and enjoy about this hobby alright and I don't understand why

[05:25] it has to turn into this like mud-slinging contest this time of year when all we're trying

[05:32] to do is recognize everybody for the great contributions they do for pinball alright and

[05:39] I just want to say like look I just want to say like get off Zach Zach's back for being

[05:44] a distributor you know he's Zach is Zach you know and you know the kind of content he's

[05:49] going to create and who out there like doesn't think this week in pinball is one of the

[05:52] best pinball podcasts that's out there now I you know I think it's definitely in the

[05:57] top cremdala cremab pinball podcast and you know they get a lot of people who listen to

[06:03] the show and I listen to the show and I listen to a lot of other pinball podcasts out there

[06:08] I think it's so silly to come out there and say that you think this sucks and he sucks

[06:12] and that sucks who cares what your little opinion is I again I really implore people you pick

[06:20] up a microphone you pick up a microphone and you try to do a show on a weekly basis maybe

[06:26] multiple times a week maybe every two weeks maybe even once a month I implore anyone out there

[06:31] that thinks it's easy to do this and it's easy to generate an audience that consistently comes

[06:37] back for more it's not and I applaud every single pinball podcast out there that does it that

[06:44] enjoys it we all do it for entertainment purposes and whenever I see people on pinside just

[06:50] starting to attack these individuals I mean I will be the first one to defend all of them

[06:56] and and how people are personally attacking them all right again like I think we all just

[07:01] need to chill out it's December it's pinball okay see if you want to attack something you want

[07:07] to get mad at something you want to debate something let's debate what the manufacturers do

[07:12] because at the end of the day all of our shows are free nobody's charging you to listen to

[07:18] Canadian Spinball Podcasts or this week in pinball or read this week in pinball's website or read

[07:22] pinside but these manufacturers are charging you thousands of dollars for these games and my

[07:28] show has always been based on that simple notion that if we're going to give strong opinions about

[07:33] something we should give them towards the games themselves and the companies themselves that want

[07:40] our money and I just think that's for me that's the most entertaining side of the hobby that I like

[07:46] to cover okay and so with that being said you're going to hear what American pinball's next rumored

[07:53] theme is and you can debate it on pinside now I debate a little bit but I'm sure you guys are going

[07:59] to go at it some might like it some might not it's a licensed theme you're going to hear the show

[08:04] right now but everyone please do me a favor it's middle of December can we all just chill out

[08:11] and just get back to enjoying this hobby we've got Rick and Marty we've got stranger things is

[08:16] all but confirmed I've heard that it's happening like in a week or so we have deep root supposedly

[08:22] coming out in March we have all this stuff happening that's good can we stop looking at people and

[08:27] trying to find the worst in them all right I'll look at games and find the best in the worst in

[08:33] the games I'll look at coders and designers and artists and I'll look to see what they did great

[08:36] I'll look to see what I think they did wrong but I'm just giving my criticism of the products

[08:42] of the people associated with the products but we're like critiquing all these free

[08:48] personalities in pinball and it's so stupid just enjoy what you enjoy listen to what you enjoy

[08:55] if you don't like someone don't listen to them okay that being said let's put up the photo of the

[09:00] guy who who keeps shaming me as a fraud come on man what's up with that can I do pinball podcast

[09:06] here's your next ap title rumored podcast do you want to wait until march to find out what American

[09:13] pinball's next game is or you want to listen to this episode of canadus pinball podcast in which

[09:18] I have a very very strong rumor about what their next title is you don't become the number one

[09:25] pinball podcast two years in a row by keeping these rumors secret and we ain't taking no hiatus

[09:32] in January no this show goes on right now

[09:53] oh welcome to a Saturday night edition of canadus pinball podcast i'm your host canada

[09:58] i feel the energy tonight because we're going to drop a rumor out into the pinball world about

[10:06] what the next American pinball theme is going to be and i'm going to say it it's a rumor now you take

[10:14] it for what it's worth it might be right it might be wrong but here's how we'll know if this is

[10:19] accurate or not they will come out and either tell us it's right or wrong okay now before we get

[10:26] to that before we get to that i was just thinking how badly does deeproot probably wish that they

[10:33] had got riccan morty over raza look at their different reaction just from theme alone riccan morty

[10:42] versus raza raza with a game did not generate nearly as much excitement as riccan morty and we've

[10:51] said it's so many times on this podcast theme theme theme is everything how are you ever going to

[10:58] warm up to retro atomic zombie adventure land as much as you do to a a show like riccan morty that

[11:06] people freaking love now i've watched two to three episodes of it and it is funny i'm going to

[11:11] keep going because people say it gets better with each season so i'm not i'm not going to draw a

[11:16] final conclusion now but i did hear from chuck and he said if you are in the fang club you will

[11:24] get a chance to buy it before everyone else you'll get a two week head start on ordering your

[11:32] riccan morty pinball machine from scott denisi and spooky pinball and that that thread continues

[11:38] continues to keep blowing up with excitement so now that the only thing left the only thing left

[11:45] is actually the most important thing we have to see the freaking game but chuck was in there

[11:50] yesterday and he was talking like they left nothing out of this machine so what does that mean

[11:56] they left nothing out of it so he's hyping it i mean he is hyping this machine so let's just

[12:01] let's just say that expectations are are now through the roof so i hope they deliver on what those

[12:08] expectations are but i'm excited i know you're excited all right so why are you listening to this

[12:13] episode of canadus pinball podcast should we do a market trend segment no we're not going to do

[12:17] that we're not going to do that are we going to take off in january right when voting starts for

[12:22] the twitties we're not going to do that either we're going to keep going with canadus pinball

[12:26] podcasts so here's the deal i'll make this a short and sweet episode because i just want to drop

[12:32] for you what i think is the next theme for american pinball now before i tell you what it is here is

[12:40] what i know so far i know they are developing two games right now one of them is a licensed

[12:48] theme game one of them is not okay and whichever one is done first is the one they are going to bring

[12:57] to market and reveal at texas pinball festival now i'm here to tell you that it's not one of those

[13:04] four titles valkyrie robinhood what is it surelock homes and poker run remember i went all

[13:12] off on poker run and how stupid that would be they did give us a hint remember a few months ago

[13:19] they said we're working on our next title and they showed a pair of car keys all right that was a

[13:26] hint that was a hint so here is what i am hearing is the next title from american pinball it's a

[13:34] licensed theme that is based on one of the most successful toy franchises of all time they've sold

[13:43] six billion of these toys over the years and it just turned 50 years old last year can you guess

[13:50] what it is yet american pinball's next theme i am hearing is hot wheels okay let that sink in hot

[14:01] wheels the little toys with the orange ramps and the loop deloupes and the fast tracks and the

[14:09] jumps now let's let's talk about this for a minute as if it's going to happen because i don't know

[14:16] for sure but what do we feel about hot wheels being the next theme from american pinball all right so

[14:23] so let's let's talk that this could be the first pinball machine ever in which we have a loop

[14:30] okay i can just see it now an orange ramp with a loop deloup i can also see the ball doing jumps

[14:36] you know all you just google image like hot wheels tracks and and there's all these fun different

[14:41] ways you know the the ball can jump can loop can like go around corners like we're talking speed

[14:48] we're talking cornering we're talking jumping we're talking loop deloup so do we think that this

[14:54] is a good theme for pinball all right and i'm here to tell you like i don't know i don't know like

[15:01] i know that hot wheels is really popular but the big question always remains will the fan base

[15:10] of hot wheels which is huge don't get me wrong people still collect hot wheels kids still play

[15:16] with hot wheels adults still buy hot wheels toys will that translate over into the pinball buying

[15:24] marketplace because here's the thing that i think is the main issue if you want to play with hot

[15:30] wheels you can play with hot wheels and a hot wheel only cost a few dollars and a hot wheels

[15:37] track usually costs like 20 to 30 dollars maybe 50 bucks at most so will the fan base

[15:44] whose into collecting hot wheels like buy a seven to eight thousand dollar pinball machine

[15:53] that's based on the property they love and do people who love pinball do they love hot wheels

[16:02] now when we've done your favorite themes and when i've seen people write their favorite themes

[16:08] like favorite five themes they would love to see your ten themes i've never ever ever ever ever see

[16:16] anyone put on their list of dream themes hot wheels so it just once again it begs the question

[16:28] who is doing the market research over at american pinball if this is in fact accurate now

[16:38] here's here's where like here's the hard part is i am sure that you can make a crazy cool hot wheels

[16:46] world under glass come to life via pinball i'm i without a doubt i think you can do that and i think

[16:53] you can make a fun pinball game but it's not about fun see when i hear hot wheels pinball i feel like

[16:59] it's the kind of cool thing i would probably walk up to on location and put a few quarters in sure

[17:05] like it it just feels like it's that kind of thing do you want to own it and we are now in a pinball

[17:13] landscape with so many titles that it can't just be something that people want to play and have fun

[17:20] with it needs to be something and a theme that people want to own like people are doing back flips

[17:27] for rick and morty because they really want to own it because they they can see how it would translate

[17:32] perfectly into pinball i'm just not sure hot wheels will get you that and also by the time this

[17:39] game comes out if it even if it even is hot wheels by the time it comes out we're gonna have rick and

[17:46] morty we're gonna have stranger things we're gonna have probably teenage mutant ninja turtles right

[17:51] around the corner we're gonna have god knows what else guns and roses what else are we gonna have

[17:56] willy wonko we're gonna have you know all these games available we're gonna have probably cactus

[18:01] canyon remake we're gonna have royal editions of medieval madness we're going to have maybe

[18:06] jerry's p3 game that's gonna save the universe comes out you know what i'm saying there's just so

[18:11] many themes coming out and it's not just about you know making the best american pinball game to date

[18:18] it's about making a game that can compete with the other titles available and so i'm just curious

[18:27] what your thoughts are if american pinball's next title is hot wheels do you think that that can

[18:34] be a successful game for them now you're hearing it here first i'm can eat this pinball podcast this

[18:40] is what i'm hearing this is what i'm hearing from a few reliable sources that say they heard this

[18:45] from a distributor that american pinball is working on a hot wheels game it might be wrong if this

[18:51] rumor is wrong i will happily correct with a in a future podcast um if american pinball wants to

[19:00] correct me or not they're not going to confirm it if i asked them so that it's pointless for me to

[19:04] ask them right now okay all right because you know this is just what we do when we hear something

[19:10] we put it out there for discussion uh if it is not hot wheels they can easily josh is on pinside they

[19:16] can easily go on there and say it's not hot wheels it's not hard to do all right so what else is going

[19:22] on i mean that's it that's it i just wanted to tell you what i heard is the the next game from american

[19:29] and it's going to be an exciting December we have two titles coming out one from spooky and one

[19:35] from stern pinball uh can't wait to see what those games look like uh it's a long ways away

[19:42] Texas pinball festival uh so you know the the lesson is this don't don't tell anybody what your next

[19:50] game is it's it's amazing to me how manufacturers let other people in on what they're working on

[19:58] i mean no one knew that scott denesee was working on rick and morty nobody knew that nobody was

[20:03] talking about it being scott denesee's next game we saw a few rumors about rick and morty uh

[20:08] being licensed as a pinball game but nobody knew if it was stern or if it was spooky if it was cgc's

[20:13] game nobody knew they kept it secret so i mean i'm pardon me hopes that this is wrong pardon me hopes

[20:21] not that it's wrong because i think it's it's a bad theme for pinball although i do think it is a

[20:26] questionable theme for pinball but i just hope i'm wrong because i hope that they still have secrets

[20:32] left as a manufacturer you have to keep your next titles as secretive as possible you have to

[20:41] you can't let stuff out early because if it lands on my desk and it lands in my inbox and i'm

[20:49] gonna i'm just gonna say it i don't really care i'm gonna say it i'm gonna tell you what i'm hearing

[20:53] and let you guys discuss it and like i said it's really easy for a manufacturer to shut down rumors

[20:59] immediately all right everyone have a great Saturday night this has been episode 426 of
