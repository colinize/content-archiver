[00:00] Remember only God could judge you, forget the hate, we also turn up here.

[00:14] Welcome to episode. What are we at now? We are at episode 636 of Canada's Pinball podcast. I'm your host, Canada. Happy New Year's everybody.

[00:33] I hope each and every one of you had a great holiday and an amazing new year. Now, it is with a very sad and somber note that we start the new year in the pinball community.

[00:42] We've lost one of the greatest members of the New York pinball scene, the Northeast pinball scene,

[00:47] but just the pinball scene in general, because when you're into pinball, you're not just an East Coast or a West Coast person,

[00:53] you're part of the whole global pinball community, and you might have known him as Al, Pinball Al.

[00:58] I think you say his last name, Al Seahawk. And Al was always somebody that was ever present in my pinball scene

[01:05] in New York. He was always hanging out at modern pinball. He was an operator of pinball machines all over the

[01:12] city, and just an amazing guy, an amazing guy. And for those of you who knew Al, you knew how sweet

[01:17] he was, how big his heart was, and Al unfortunately passed away in his sleep just a day ago.

[01:23] So I want to say with heavy hearts, we will miss you, Al. We loved you, and thank you so much for all

[01:28] you did in pinball. I could tell a bunch of Al's stories, but the ones that always ring true in my mind

[01:33] are when Al would come and work on my machines. And he would always be so great. He would always lend

[01:38] lend a helping hand. He would always give me his insights onto what he thought was wrong with my game.

[01:43] But here was always the crazy part, right? If you were a collector and Al came

[01:47] over to work on your machine. Now, Al needed a cane to walk around. And his cane was always all over the

[01:53] place. And so there he is. He's like lifting the hood on a pinball machine. And his cane is like

[01:58] banging into your cabinet. And I will say this. For the amount of times I was nervous that Al's cane would

[02:04] put a huge scratch in my pinball cabinet. It never did. But I will say, it was always like the most

[02:09] nerve-wracking moments when Al was working on machines. And you were just like, oh my God, I can't

[02:13] believe this thing is flying all over these like rare precious cabinets. Anyway,

[02:18] Al, we will miss you. We definitely love you. We will miss you. And we definitely all have to raise a

[02:23] glass and celebrate Al next time we all get together. Maybe we should do like a commemorative drink.

[02:28] I'm going to talk to John over at Jack Bar for Al. So every time anyone goes there,

[02:32] we can order a special dedicated to him. So we're one day away from Rush Pinball. And Canada's

[02:38] going to do what Canada does best. I'm going to give you some details I've been hearing in the rumor mill

[02:42] about Rush Pinball machine. And we will see which one of these rumors come true and come to fruition.

[02:49] But, you know, this is what I do. People talk to me. People still share information with Canada,

[02:54] even though I am behind that vicious paywall is five bucks a month too much to hear this news. So here we go.

[03:00] So Rush Pinball was worked on with the two surviving members of Rush. I don't really know the members of Rush,

[03:06] so I don't know which two are still surviving. But they worked on the game closely with Stern Pinball.

[03:11] I'm also hearing that Mr. Ed Robertson was heavily involved in this project with Rush.

[03:17] And it makes sense, right? Because if you're a famous Canadian artist, you really have to hang out and be friends with other famous Canadian artists.

[03:25] Like, I'm not sure, but it might not just have been Ed Robertson in this studio with Rush doing the callouts for the game.

[03:32] We might also get some Brian Adams and Celine Dion in this game as well, because they all have to be friends with each other.

[03:38] So I'm hearing Ed Robertson worked on this game with them as well.

[03:41] He might even make an appearance in the game doing callouts.

[03:45] But I think that's a great addition to this game because Ed Robertson knows so much about pinball.

[03:50] He knows so much about what makes a pinball machine exciting and fun.

[03:54] And we all know this.

[03:55] When someone is doing callouts for a pinball machine, they need direction.

[04:00] And Stern can sometimes do really piss poor direction on callouts when they're working with, like, talent.

[04:05] So I really hope Ed told these guys, like, don't just say jackpot.

[04:09] Say jackpot, you know.

[04:11] So we'll see, we'll see, but I think Ed Robertson will be in the game.

[04:15] That is a rumor that I am hearing.

[04:17] All right, what else is going on?

[04:18] Well, it's going to have the 17th songs like we mentioned earlier.

[04:22] This game is going to be fully theme integrated with the band.

[04:26] It isn't like they're licensing this band or their music or their image.

[04:30] The band worked directly on this pinball machine, just like Slash worked with Eric on GNR over at JJP.

[04:38] So expect this to be one of the greatest theme integrated.

[04:41] pinball machines that sternus put out. So that is going to be something that is going to be

[04:45] exciting to Rush fans that are out there. Now, what else am I hearing about this game? So we've

[04:50] speculated for a while that this game has a very large circular mechanism in the middle of the game,

[04:57] and I am hearing that that is not only true, but it is a time machine. And the major mech in Rush

[05:03] pinball will be a time machine. But here's where it gets really cool. So it's a big circular

[05:09] meck. And I hear it might grab the ball a la Lord of the Rings sort of ring, like have magnets

[05:16] around it and freeze the ball in midair and shoot the ball out into the time machine. And so that is what

[05:23] I'm hearing will be the major mech. Very cool. You know I love toys. You know I love magnets. You know

[05:29] I love Lord the Rings. So to see this mec maybe made bigger in a rush pinball machine is very cool.

[05:35] And the way it's going to work, the way this game is going to work, the storyline of the game.

[05:39] is you're going to be able to travel through the different periods in which Rush made music

[05:44] and play songs from those periods. So you're going to go from what, the 70s, the 80s, the 90s.

[05:50] You know, I think they're still making music into the 2000s. So this is going to be how the game

[05:54] sort of works. Will it be like a concert in a box like Guns and Roses? I don't think so. I think it's

[06:00] going to be more about going back and playing songs from different eras. That's much different

[06:05] than what Guns and Roses was trying to do, which is actually put the elements of going to

[06:09] a G&R show under the glass. So kind of an original theme, right? I don't think I've seen

[06:14] another music pin in which you travel through a time machine to play music from the band's

[06:19] different eras. So very, very cool approach to a music pin, if you ask me. I'm also hearing this is

[06:24] a John Borg pin. So you're going to get a lot of like these ramps and wire forms and plastic

[06:30] ramps that elevate off the playfield and you're going to get swooping ramps and habit trails. So this thing

[06:36] is going to look, I heard a lot like Ninja Turtles, where the ball is going to be.

[06:39] going up and whipping around the entire playfield. So there's going to be a lot of that. What I like about

[06:44] Borg's designs is they come up off the playfield, right? They're not flat like Led Zeppelin. I think this game

[06:51] is going to have a lot of dimension to it. So that's another cool thing. So you're going to see that. I just

[06:56] want to say for the record, I haven't seen this game yet. So I don't know. Like I'm hearing there

[07:00] might also be like a clock. That's a drum set. I don't know. I'm just hearing elements of this game.

[07:06] I haven't seen anything. I haven't seen any materials from Stern Pinball.

[07:09] I'm just going off of some rumors that people on Facebook are saying and I'm reading through Pinside

[07:14] and I'm sort of cobbling together, if you will, the consistent rumors I'm hearing over and over.

[07:19] We'll see if Canada's right. Now, there is a big butt coming and I've talked to a few people

[07:25] and everyone I've talked to has this big butt. And I'm going to tell you what the big butt is and it's not

[07:31] my big butt, okay? The big butt is this. The big butt in Rush Pimble, when I talk to people and they're

[07:38] like, yes, it's this, it's that, but there's this issue with the game. The number one issue with

[07:44] the game, and I want to apologize to Brian Allen, who is a very talented artist, because I heard

[07:49] a rumor that Brian Allen was doing Rush. That is not happening. So please disregard that rumor. The

[07:56] big butt I'm hearing on Rush Pinball is that the art package on this game is bad. And I mean like

[08:03] people that are normally like, yeah, it's okay. Like if you're a Rush fan, no, I'm hearing. I'm hearing.

[08:08] that it is pretty bad. And that seems to be the Achilles heel maybe of this game. I'm hearing that the color

[08:15] choices are a little strange, that maybe the LE is a darker palette, kind of like a Houdini

[08:20] kind of steampunk color to the game. But I'm also hearing it's illustrated, right? So there's not like

[08:26] Photoshop drag and drop images of the band, but the way they illustrated the characters in the band is not

[08:33] going to blow you away. I'm hearing it might be more like the way they drew Guns and Roses members and

[08:38] Data East GNR, right? Very like Sharpy looking, not highly detailed. So is this going to be true?

[08:45] And it's kind of ironic because Rush was always a band that was never about flashiness. It was never

[08:52] about sexiness. It was never about image. So maybe Rush fans are going to think this is awesome that

[08:59] the game might be ugly because this band was never about sexy album covers. It was always about the

[09:05] music. So is this what you're going to get? Are you literally

[09:08] going to get an ugly rush machine that has a lot of soul, that has the best drummer ever in

[09:14] music. But I don't know. I would argue that everybody wants their pinball machines to aesthetically

[09:20] be beautiful. That when we saw stuff like the blue on Led Zeppelin, we were like, what is this? And

[09:26] we know that Stern can either hit it out of the park with their art packages or they can miss

[09:32] terribly. Now, the thing is, Stern hasn't really missed terribly in a long time. Led Zeppelin,

[09:38] was definitely a miss. It was definitely lazy. But I'm hearing this could be one of the biggest

[09:44] head scratcher art packages we've seen from Stern Pinball in a long time. And I do think it's a shame

[09:50] because if there's one thing you can't change. If there's one thing the mod community can't fix,

[09:57] it's a bad art package. And if the playfield art isn't good and the side cabinet artwork is not

[10:03] good, then I think that's going to make people be like, I might not want to put this ugly duckling

[10:08] in my row of Stern machines. And stern machines are usually colorful and beautiful for the most

[10:13] part. I mean, they've made some pretty nice looking machines over the last few years. The other

[10:17] rumor I'm hearing is this, is that you're not even going to know who the artist is. This is a brand

[10:23] new artist, and you might not even know who it is. They might not even be crediting this artist

[10:28] the way they do Zombie Yeti and the way they do other artists who have worked on their games.

[10:33] I mean, even Johnny Krap got credited. I don't know, maybe Stern's trying to hide the fact of who did this,

[10:38] But we shall see. The other part is this. I haven't seen it. And all art is subjective.

[10:43] But I've heard from multiple sources that have seen this game that artistically it might make people

[10:49] scratch their heads. Now again, I have not seen it. You know I'm a man of great artistic taste. And if I saw

[10:55] this, I would give you my point of view on it and my true opinion. But here's the good news.

[10:59] We're all going to be able to see it tomorrow. But I'm nervous. I'm nervous about what this game's

[11:04] going to look like. Here's the last final detail I want to give you on this game. Stern is

[11:08] asking people to charge more for the LEs. I've heard from multiple dealers now that Stern is saying,

[11:14] hey, the pro and premium price will be the same as Godzilla. But we would like you to charge a little bit

[11:20] more for the LE. Now, I was asking a dealer of mine. Why? Why are they doing that? And here is what I heard

[11:26] from a dealer. I'm not going to say which dealer it was. And no, you're never going to guess it. I'm hearing there

[11:31] might be a feature in this game that is only in the LE. It will not be in the premium.

[11:38] Now, you could ask yourself, what do you think that could be? What feature would be in the LEE

[11:43] that they leave out of the premium? Now, it's a music pin. Now, what thing did they put into

[11:49] Led Zeppelin that we didn't see before? My guess is this, and this is just Canada guessing. I'm guessing

[11:55] that Stern Pinball is going to make the expression lighting system that goes up the side of the

[12:01] cabinet. My guess is stern pinball is going to make that an exclusive item for the LEA, and that is

[12:07] why they're going to try to charge more. It is also going to be a very, I think, a very divisive move

[12:13] because Stern has never done this before. They've never released a premium that doesn't have all of the

[12:19] features of the LE. Now, very questionable move. This is just like Jersey Jack giving you that

[12:25] coma ball lock in the CE that they left out of the LEE. Can you hear Killian crying? He's not happy

[12:31] about this move because Killian's all in on the premiums these days. So that is my guess that Stern

[12:36] pinball expression lighting system only in the LE. Take that to Pinside and say that is what

[12:42] Canada is guessing. All right, the final point I want to make on this episode of Canada's Pimball podcast. I hope

[12:47] you're enjoying it. Thank you guys for contributing to the show. You knew the show wasn't going to go away

[12:52] and now you get to enjoy it. And our numbers are fine. Our numbers are holding strong. At the end of every

[12:56] month, we lose a few people because they realize that Patreon's going to bill them, but then we

[13:00] gain a few more as well. Here's the other part. Last night, we learned that Jersey Jack Pimball,

[13:06] After eight and a half years of getting tech support from LTG, you know him as Lloyd, he's been

[13:12] working for them, I think for free, for eight and a half years, they let him go from their tech

[13:17] support department. Now, what is going on here, right? I don't know. There are two sides to every story,

[13:23] but this seems to make no sense. How do you cut a guy loose who's not costing you any money?

[13:28] I heard the only cost to them was they would give him a machine to figure out all the issues and to

[13:33] troubleshoot it. I want to say this. Lloyd is one of the nicest.

[13:36] people in the community. Butch Peele is also one of the nicest people in the community. They

[13:41] are two of the greatest tech support people in the history of Pimball. The one company that needs

[13:46] the most tech support out there is Jersey Jack Pimball. And they have now cut loose two of the nicest

[13:52] people that the community loves from tech support. It's a bad PR move, but I don't know both sides

[13:59] to the story. But I will say this. I do know both sides to the Butch Peele story. And trust me, you don't

[14:06] want to know both sides to the story because once you do, the company won't come out looking

[14:11] great. And I tend to believe that a guy like Lloyd, he is like the nicest, most altruistic guy in the

[14:18] community. He doesn't want to take money for his tech support. He doesn't. People wanted to set up a

[14:23] PayPal and a donation for him and he won't accept it. So you're telling me someone with a heart like that

[14:28] that just does it because they love Pimball. What could he have possibly done to be shown the door from

[14:35] Jersey Jack Pimball. I don't know. But we will try to find out. I'm actually going to try to get

[14:40] Lloyd on the show to talk about this. I doubt he will join. He's very private. But he did come out. He did

[14:46] come out and explain that this was not his choice. And he is sort of like pretty deflated that he was

[14:52] shown the door after all these years. Man, it's like these dramatic moments. They just always seem to happen

[14:58] in Pimball. But if I'm Stern Pimball or American Pimball or anyone else out there, if I'm American

[15:03] pinball. I feel like someone should pick up Lloyd because this guy is so good and he definitely,

[15:08] he definitely would be a great addition to any customer service team that is making pinball machines.

[15:13] I mean, this is what you want. Someone in the community that can help people at all hours of the night

[15:20] for free, for free. Now, I don't agree with that per se. Like, I don't. I would not be giving hundreds of

[15:26] hours of my time for free when people should be getting paid. Like Lloyd should be on the payroll for a

[15:32] company to do what he does. And I'm sorry. It's just the amount of money in this hobby, the amount of

[15:36] money people throw at stuff. And customer service is one of the most valuable skill sets there is in

[15:41] pinball. Many people out there would get out of this hobby if it weren't for people like Lloyd. So I do

[15:47] think they deserve to benefit with their skill set and their knowledge. But he doesn't want it. And that's

[15:52] on him. But you know Cadena where I stand on this. If you're good at something in life, never give it

[15:57] away for free. Everybody, we'll see Rush tomorrow. More to come on this game.

[16:02] Happy holidays, everybody. Rest and peace out. We're really going to miss you. And I can't

[16:06] believe JJP cut another amazing customer service tech. It never ceases to amaze me. Canada out.
