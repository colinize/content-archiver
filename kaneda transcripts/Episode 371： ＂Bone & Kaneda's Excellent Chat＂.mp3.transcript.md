[00:00] [♪ INTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪

[00:24] Welcome to episode 371 of Canadian Pimball Podcast,

[00:28] the only Pimball Podcast that costs $13,500.

[00:32] All right, so on this episode, Zach Menny's Better Happ will join the show, Greg Bone,

[00:38] and Greg and I are going to talk all about the stuff that's been going on in Pimball.

[00:42] Before I do that, I want to clarify one thing.

[00:44] My rumor podcast that went up a couple podcasts ago was from over four months ago.

[00:50] So do not listen to that and start a thread in which Canada is confirming that Chicago

[00:55] gaming company is making alien.

[00:57] They are not.

[00:58] Okay, we've said it many times.

[01:00] That rumor is wrong, but the rumor of alien coming back is true.

[01:04] It is happening.

[01:06] It is happening.

[01:07] I see people writing on Pinside that they think I'm another egomaniac, manic-depressant,

[01:12] sociopath who just needs to go away.

[01:15] Why are people so mean?

[01:16] I invite everyone who has such a negative opinion about the show to simply come on and

[01:21] talk about Pimball with your friendly neighbor, Canada.

[01:25] Truth is, I care a lot about this hobby.

[01:27] I'm very excited about this hobby.

[01:29] Things go down this hobby that are very dramatic.

[01:32] Most of the stuff that happens in this hobby is very positive.

[01:36] Most of what this hobby is all about is what I saw yesterday, our friend Derek streaming

[01:40] Willy Wonka with his friends for six hours straight, six hours of streaming Wonka.

[01:45] My God.

[01:46] And they still can't get more than one golden ticket.

[01:49] But anyway.

[01:50] That's what this hobby is about.

[01:51] I think sometimes people take it way too far.

[01:54] People are getting banned on Pinside.

[01:56] We're going to talk about that on the next episode.

[01:57] I'm going to do a whole thing about how Pinside is just sort of kind of gone a little crazy

[02:02] lately.

[02:03] But here's a deal.

[02:04] Just turn it off.

[02:05] Enjoy your Pins.

[02:06] Look forward to the next pin.

[02:07] I fully expect to see Stern's pin reveal this week in front of Comic Con.

[02:11] And I can't wait because I think when Stern reveals their next game, I'm hearing a lot

[02:15] of good things about it.

[02:16] A lot of good things.

[02:17] I think Stern is going to really blow people away over the next 12 months.

[02:21] You heard it here first.

[02:22] Well, you didn't hear it here first.

[02:23] I mean, I've been saying, Stern is going to continue to dominate.

[02:26] They are not asleep at the wheel.

[02:28] They know how to make the right changes.

[02:30] They know how to put the stuff in the games that people want.

[02:33] They might do it a little slower than you want.

[02:35] But they are the number one company in Pimble.

[02:37] And they will continue to be the number one company in Pimble.

[02:41] There is going to be no market share lost to Stern at all by the end of this year.

[02:46] In fact, I think their market share will continue to grow even more because they're going

[02:50] to keep coming out with the juggernaut themes.

[02:53] They've got Zambi Eddie and Christopher Franchi locked in.

[02:56] They've got the best team there.

[02:58] They've got the best engineers.

[03:00] So it's not going to stop.

[03:01] It's just not going to stop.

[03:03] It's only going to get a lot better.

[03:05] So I'm excited.

[03:06] I'm excited to see what everyone comes out with.

[03:08] Deep root Chicago gaming companies, cactus canning, which I hear is really, really delayed.

[03:13] I don't think you're going to get cactus canning until 2021 to be honest.

[03:17] Guns and roses, the speculation of Bill and Ted's by Zambi Eddie.

[03:22] We're going to talk all about that on this episode of Pimble podcast.

[03:26] And I know Big Lebowski right now is kind of anchoring down the hobby.

[03:32] It's reawoken a dramatic storyline that just doesn't seem to end.

[03:36] And we've said it.

[03:37] This story doesn't end because Barry and Yacht have really fumbled this thing worse than

[03:42] I've ever seen anyone fumble a Pimble company and a Pimble game.

[03:47] Because they just were never honest and just continued to make bad, clearly bad decisions.

[03:54] Now here's the thing.

[03:55] I see other people accusing people buying these games from CoinTaker and ARA getting

[04:00] like vilified.

[04:01] People are not buying these games from CoinTaker.

[04:05] They're not buying these games from Barry and Dutch Pimble.

[04:08] You know who's getting the money?

[04:10] A, they won the lawsuit.

[04:13] Okay.

[04:14] CoinTaker is simply a conduit and a middleman and this whole thing.

[04:17] And so is Barry.

[04:18] I mean, the whole thing is set up where ARA owns these games.

[04:22] ARA owns those 38 games.

[04:24] ARA could easily just auction off those games themselves.

[04:29] ARA could easily, you know, set a $20,000 price tag on each one.

[04:33] Here's why they're not doing that.

[04:34] They don't care.

[04:35] They don't want to get involved in this.

[04:36] It is so sticky and it can, you know, they don't want to have to deal with shipping

[04:40] games to 20 customers and then being liable for the condition of the games.

[04:44] No.

[04:45] All of that responsibility and liability is going to get passed on to Barry and CoinTaker

[04:50] as they get games to customers.

[04:52] The game sold out immediately and now, you know, there's a lot of debate about whether

[04:56] or not the early achievers should have had first right to buy these games at $12,500.

[05:02] What we do know is that the plaques are going to be removed.

[05:06] The early achiever plaques will not be on the games themselves.

[05:09] I hear that Barry is opening up the games to make sure they're all functioning before

[05:14] they go over to CoinTaker, which is sending these things to customers, DHL, Air.

[05:19] They should arrive for people within four to five days of getting the games.

[05:23] I don't know how fast this whole thing is going to go down, but it will continue to be

[05:27] a bit of a dumpster fire thread on Pinside and I highly recommend if you didn't get a

[05:33] game and you got burned and you want to go somewhere and argue about it, you could go

[05:38] in there and err your anger and you deserve to be angry.

[05:42] There is no way around it.

[05:43] You deserve to be angry watching other people open up a game you already paid for who didn't

[05:48] have any money in on it.

[05:49] I mean, it sucks.

[05:51] But that is how these pinball stories end.

[05:54] When these companies mismanaged things, Andrew Highway did the same thing.

[05:58] He was selling new aliens to people because he needed new money and he wasn't fulfilling

[06:04] previous orders.

[06:06] This is why I can't wait for Stern's next game because we're going to have an awesome

[06:10] game and the positive energy will be back.

[06:14] It is positive energy when I look at Willy Wonka threads.

[06:17] Yes, I've been moaning and groaning a little bit about the code.

[06:20] The code is a bit of a deal breaker for me, but that doesn't mean this is not a spectacular

[06:24] game.

[06:25] It doesn't mean it's not a stellar game.

[06:27] It's just not the kind of way I like to see games code it, but I still think the game

[06:31] is amazing.

[06:32] Yes, absolutely.

[06:34] If you play Willy Wonka and you enjoy shooting it, I mean, absolutely.

[06:38] This is a great, great thing to have a Willy Wonka pinball machine from Jersey Jack pinball.

[06:43] How can you not get excited about that?

[06:44] The games are shipping.

[06:45] The LEDs are on the line.

[06:47] The collectors editions are next.

[06:50] Am I in or out?

[06:51] Right now, I'm out.

[06:52] I mean, it doesn't mean I won't go back in.

[06:55] There's a few months to go.

[06:56] If Joe Katz puts into the game what I'm looking for, I'm a buyer again.

[07:00] Are you hearing that, Jersey Jack?

[07:01] I will give you my money again.

[07:03] If we can just sync up the voice with the clips, I know I'm a broken record on this topic,

[07:09] but it needs to be in there.

[07:10] All right.

[07:11] What else is going on?

[07:12] Then you got stuff like king pins returning, deep root, all these things, all these things

[07:18] are happening, all at once.

[07:19] I'll say this.

[07:20] This fall is going to be the perfect theme for the fall because companies are going to

[07:28] fall this year.

[07:29] There's just too many products, too much vying for dollars.

[07:34] Everyone's being asked to clear room and clear money for all these games.

[07:37] It's an exciting time to be a buyer.

[07:39] I do think games are going to start to lose a lot of money.

[07:41] We talk a lot about this with Greg.

[07:43] I'm just going to air this interview.

[07:44] It's awesome.

[07:45] Enjoy it.

[07:46] We'll be back probably later this week because I'm going to South Carolina for tire school.

[07:53] Missile and tires is going to give me a nice tutorial on their products.

[07:57] I can't wait.

[07:58] I'm going to go on the track and drive awesome cars.

[08:00] Everyone, have a great day.

[08:02] Enjoy the show.

[08:03] Thank you so much for listening.

[08:05] I will read some of your feedback on this email on this podcast next time.

[08:10] I just want to get this interview and not keep the show too long.

[08:12] Have a great day.

[08:13] All right, ladies and gentlemen, Greg Bohn is back on Canadian pinball podcast.

[08:18] I know you need a break from me just railing on Wanka people.

[08:21] So Greg, welcome back to the show.

[08:23] We're not talking about Wanka.

[08:27] We're going to talk a little bit about Wanka.

[08:29] There's a lot to talk about.

[08:30] There's a lot going on this week.

[08:32] Where should we start?

[08:33] There's a lot going on, some things.

[08:35] Let's start.

[08:36] This is your show.

[08:37] I'm letting you run.

[08:38] All right, let's start with the big Lebowski because that thread is blowing up.

[08:42] What are your thoughts on those 38 games being released from ARA and Barry saying this

[08:50] is the first step towards making more games and getting people those games?

[08:55] What are your thoughts on that whole thing?

[08:59] It is a step, but how far is it going to go beyond that?

[09:05] Right.

[09:06] Okay, what?

[09:07] They're asking 12,500 to get those games released and he's saying that that extra capital,

[09:14] do you think that's enough the startup production again?

[09:17] And with who?

[09:18] Oh, yeah, I don't think so.

[09:21] Yeah, where are you going to produce?

[09:23] Where are you going to go to?

[09:25] Are you going to go to some place like American pinball?

[09:28] Jjp?

[09:29] Is there anybody that's going to take that over and take that risk?

[09:32] That's not a lot of money.

[09:33] I mean, it's a lot of money for the game, but it's not a lot of money to really upstart

[09:39] things again.

[09:40] I don't think.

[09:41] Right.

[09:42] Because the part people are forgetting about is there were like over 200 people who put

[09:48] deposits down on the big Lebowski, right?

[09:50] So even though you're satiating 38, there's still like 150 people who put like $8,500

[09:57] down who have nothing.

[10:01] And that money's gone.

[10:02] Yeah, how do you still make those people whole?

[10:03] Right.

[10:04] You know, those people deserve their games.

[10:06] They already put the money in.

[10:08] So how are you dictating where those games that you're releasing go?

[10:12] Like it's kind of unfair because that would drive me insane if I lost out on $8,500

[10:19] and then all of a sudden somebody's got a Lebowski setting in their house at 12 grand.

[10:24] Yeah, let's talk about that.

[10:26] The ethical and moral decision to buy one of these airy games.

[10:31] What do you think?

[10:32] Are those people scumbags like Rhea Hiroh says or is it, you know, all fair and love

[10:37] and pimp on war?

[10:38] Dude, I don't think it's unfair.

[10:42] Like I don't think it falls on the people buying the games.

[10:46] I mean, there's so much stupid shit that that that we should boycott and that we should

[10:52] do just in our everyday lives with companies and everything else that that none of us do

[10:59] as much as what we'd like to.

[11:01] So like I don't think it falls on those people.

[11:05] I think they should feel uncomfortable doing it.

[11:08] But I don't really think it falls on their shoulders and it is the pinball world.

[11:13] It is the world of where when there's problematic games or there's a shitty pinball company.

[11:19] When that title comes out, we still run and buy it and we don't think a thing about that

[11:25] company, you know, given a shitty playfields or other problems and everything else.

[11:30] So like they're going to sell and nobody's even going to bat an eye at it.

[11:34] Right.

[11:35] Yeah, I heard from CoinTaker that over 200 people called and tried to get one.

[11:42] Well, it's two days ago.

[11:44] And they were all sold out before that morning even happened.

[11:50] So they were unobtainium.

[11:51] Yeah.

[11:52] Are you getting one?

[11:53] Did you call it where you wanted to call it?

[11:56] You know, I have an opportunity to get one.

[11:59] And part of this is just because ever since I did that rumor show, right, like four or

[12:04] five months ago in which I had to take down which I put back up in which I said the big

[12:08] libousies coming out, all they really did was tell CoinTaker, you know, if those games

[12:14] become available, you know, let me know.

[12:16] I'd loved that but opportunity.

[12:19] The thing that I'm on the fence about though and I haven't wired any money yet is that

[12:24] I just don't think this thing's going to go as smoothly as people think.

[12:28] And I don't think it's just going to be a matter of they get a check.

[12:32] Games are on, you know, a DHL plane and people's homes in four to five days.

[12:36] I mean, it just all seems too good to be true, especially when you're dealing with

[12:39] a guy like Barry, who's known to not deliver and be quite honest with his assessment of

[12:46] the company and their capabilities.

[12:49] So I would be nervous.

[12:50] Well, yes.

[12:51] And I thought about that too.

[12:52] I'm like, is this almost another cash grab again to get those games released?

[13:01] Is it not a solid thing?

[13:02] Is it, hey, I'm going to try to get all this money.

[13:05] We're going to get these games released and then we'll get them out.

[13:09] But it's not a sure thing to the point of where that people could send their money in and

[13:14] literally still never get a game.

[13:16] Right.

[13:17] The other thing is nothing, nothing, there was nothing that came to fruition of it.

[13:22] Pueition, whatever.

[13:23] What the books that were in there.

[13:24] fruition, you know that were.

[13:25] Yeah, there we go.

[13:26] There we go.

[13:27] There we go.

[13:28] Some guy just sent me an email, Greg, in which he listed five words I should never use

[13:32] on this show again because of my enunciations of them.

[13:36] Thank you for that.

[13:38] I'm bad about that too.

[13:40] Right.

[13:41] Well, the other thing I was thinking about, then we'll move on to some more other topics.

[13:45] My final thought is nobody knows how much money Ares actually owed, right?

[13:51] So what if they're only owed 200 grand?

[13:55] Then the cash grab here is 500 grand.

[13:58] So maybe Barry can put a couple hundred thousand in his pocket, pay it, ARA and sell off into

[14:05] the sunset.

[14:06] You know, and people still don't get their games, the early achievers who got burned.

[14:09] You never know.

[14:10] We just don't know the details.

[14:12] Yeah, there's going to be no further production.

[14:14] There's going to be nothing you're releasing a few of these games.

[14:17] He's made some money.

[14:18] Like you said, he can bounce out.

[14:19] I mean, I think that it's a plausible thing that could happen.

[14:23] And I think that people should be concerned about that.

[14:25] And they should think about it.

[14:27] Those are being sold as is that of sat in boxes for years.

[14:33] And there's no support.

[14:34] I mean, speaking from someone who, you know, when a game breaks, even just one part of

[14:39] a game, right, it becomes nothing but frustrating to own it.

[14:43] So I just hope people are thinking this through.

[14:46] I'd hate to see 38 people with $12,500 out the door with a big paperweight.

[14:52] But okay.

[14:53] But it could be something like, you know, I don't think it'll be as bad as what you were

[14:56] into with Magic Girl.

[14:57] I think that it would be an alien scenario, probably, of where that enough people, if

[15:04] there's love for the game, people will come together.

[15:06] They'll fabricate parts.

[15:08] They'll make stuff work.

[15:10] Hopefully, you know, so I don't know if you would be in just necessarily a paperweight, but

[15:16] it might cost you some money.

[15:17] And that game might be down for a year before you do get it fixed again if something happens.

[15:22] So, you know, there is that.

[15:24] Yeah, the community does do a great job.

[15:26] And the alien is a good testament to that is they have made, they've kind of remade

[15:31] Andrew's alien.

[15:32] They've fixed every issue.

[15:33] Yeah.

[15:34] They remade, you know, light boards.

[15:35] And so I think the same thing will happen with the Bowskune owners because the other

[15:39] part, two Greg is right, the people buying these things are kind of men with means and

[15:43] money and they will make sure that if the money's out there, people will fabricate stuff to

[15:48] make these games reliable enough to own.

[15:51] Yep.

[15:52] So something else that happened, like I think it happened last night, Zombie Yeti released

[15:58] a couple of images of Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.

[16:03] And he sort of had a little post about how, you know, he's so excited to be working on

[16:06] this project.

[16:07] What do you think?

[16:08] Is this all smoking mirrors or is there Bill and Ted Zombie Yeti's Stern Game coming

[16:12] around the corner?

[16:13] I do not think that it's a Stern Game.

[16:16] If it is even a game, I think he's blowing smoke.

[16:20] I think that it's probably a project he's working on, but I don't think that it is a

[16:26] pinball machine.

[16:27] You know how tight lip Stern is.

[16:29] Stern's not going to let that happen.

[16:30] That's not Stern style.

[16:32] Like so it would completely surprise me if it did come out that this was the pinball machine

[16:38] and this was the artwork.

[16:39] I mean, would it not you just because of the way that they handle things?

[16:42] Yeah, absolutely.

[16:43] There's no way.

[16:44] There is no way.

[16:45] This is how they tease and they would never let him do that.

[16:50] And one of the things I heard is it might be him working with Jack Danger.

[16:54] I know Jack Danger is making a homebrew game.

[16:57] But then I'm like, why would Zombie Yeti?

[16:59] I mean, I know they're friends, but he gets paid a lot of money and he deservedly so.

[17:04] I doubt he would do all of this just for a friend's homebrew project for free.

[17:08] Well, and that's a lot of work.

[17:10] It's not simply a sketch for a t-shirt or doing art for a t-shirt.

[17:15] I mean, when you're doing an entire play field back class side art, that's a lot of work

[17:21] and it's a lot of time put in.

[17:24] I mean, it could be possible, but man, that's work.

[17:29] Right.

[17:30] Do you, as a theme, Bill and Ted's, what do you think?

[17:33] Oh, I love it.

[17:36] You know, and I actually like the direction he was going with it.

[17:39] I kind of like that ghost buster's art style for it just because it's a fun goofy movie.

[17:46] And honestly seeing that artwork kind of pushed me up like I love piano reaps.

[17:50] I love Bill and Ted.

[17:52] I love all of that.

[17:54] But I wasn't ever completely sold on the theme, but seeing his artwork actually kind of made me excited about the theme.

[18:00] Right.

[18:01] And the first movie, I mean, it lends itself so perfectly to a pinball machine, collecting all the different historical figures, right?

[18:08] With all the different scenes and the modes, perfect.

[18:11] With like Beethoven.

[18:12] Exactly.

[18:13] Exactly.

[18:14] There's so many different kinds of music.

[18:16] You know, you got your air guitar.

[18:18] You got everything.

[18:19] Like you said, the modes are already kind of set out.

[18:20] Like the plot of the movie is a fucking journey, just like a pinball machine.

[18:27] You know, it's, it is.

[18:28] It's perfect story based game be incredible.

[18:32] Okay.

[18:33] So Stern's next game, they've done a great job of keeping it under wraps.

[18:38] Of course, we keep hearing Jurassic World.

[18:40] I've been hearing that it might be revealed Monday or Tuesday.

[18:44] My guess was Comic Con.

[18:45] They would reveal it.

[18:47] What do you think?

[18:48] Do you think it's going to be Jurassic World and all of these rumors have been 100% spot on?

[18:52] Oh my God, man.

[18:54] So like I have done nothing but discuss this and I know nothing.

[18:58] I know nothing about it.

[19:00] And here's my, and I want to hear your thoughts too.

[19:02] Like I want to hear your solid thoughts.

[19:03] Have you talked about that?

[19:05] I haven't listened to your show for a couple episodes.

[19:09] So I don't know if you've discussed this already.

[19:11] Come on.

[19:12] No, I feel bad.

[19:14] I don't know anything either.

[19:15] Usually by this point, I've seen a leak, like a real legitimate leak by now.

[19:21] And I've heard more solid facts, but Stern has done an incredible job of not just all we

[19:28] know about is Elvira and they didn't even want people to know about that.

[19:32] That was a mistake when it was announced.

[19:34] But it's all, it's all a mystery.

[19:36] It could be Ninja Turtles, Godzilla, you know, Jurassic World.

[19:39] They've done a great job.

[19:40] Congratulations, Stern.

[19:41] You've sealed the leak.

[19:43] You've always got, oh, sorry, they've sealed the leak.

[19:46] You know, so it's good.

[19:48] They're, they're, they're, they're a mystery.

[19:50] I guess it is.

[19:52] Well, and this is the thing about it.

[19:54] This is the thing that pushes me that it could be true though is, yes, like you've said

[19:58] before.

[19:59] So we run in the circle.

[20:00] There's a tight knit circle of people who know things.

[20:03] And most of the time, we're, we're privy to that.

[20:07] But that being said, it's just like you said, they've, like we, we've heard nothing.

[20:11] But at the same time, there's always that one person who does know something that will

[20:16] dispute it.

[20:17] They will come out no matter who they are.

[20:19] It's a friend of somebody and they'll say, no, it is not Jurassic Park.

[20:23] It's not Jurassic World.

[20:24] And we have not seen that.

[20:26] Right.

[20:27] So that's what makes me think that the rumors are true.

[20:31] Now which machine it is?

[20:33] I don't know, man, like Jurassic World kind of makes sense to me because it's the fresher,

[20:39] newer movie.

[20:40] It's the next generations Jurassic Park.

[20:43] So it helps lure in those young kids, the young people, a lot of the people that are going

[20:48] to Comic Con.

[20:50] But at the same time, Jurassic Park is nostalgic, like Star Wars or Ghostbusters or something.

[20:57] And I think that it would sell probably better than Jurassic World.

[21:03] I agree.

[21:04] So I'm in a toss up on that of which way they are going to go with it.

[21:10] And honestly, neither, either way that they go, I'm not going to be disappointed.

[21:15] I'm buying the damn game.

[21:17] Like I'm literally, like, I've got my fingers crossed.

[21:19] I'm holding off.

[21:20] I'm getting ready to put, I'm going to put Guardians up and I'm going to put Star Wars

[21:24] up for sale.

[21:25] Whichever one sells first is the one that goes.

[21:28] And that's what's going to buy my Jurassic Park slash world.

[21:32] So I'm hopeful that it comes out.

[21:37] But I'm going to be majorly disappointed and probably be depressed and cry in bed for

[21:42] like a fucking week if it doesn't come out.

[21:44] Right.

[21:45] Well, yeah, I mean, I, we've heard this rumor so many times.

[21:48] The thing that I've been hearing lately is that it's Keith L. Wins game is next.

[21:52] And so, and then the question is like, who's coding it?

[21:56] It's probably going to be the guy who helped them on Iron Maiden.

[22:01] Maybe the Deadpool coder is also going to be a part of this.

[22:03] But Stern's coding approach now, they have a much larger team of software engineers.

[22:10] I don't think, you know, you're going to, I think you're going to see more of like a couple

[22:13] people jumping on these games to make sure, you know, the code is great.

[22:18] I think Jurassic Park would sell better than Jurassic World.

[22:21] I think that just goes because of the demographic of the buyer base is 40 to 50.

[22:26] I also think last year was the 25th anniversary of Jurassic Park.

[22:29] It would have made sense to maybe bring it out.

[22:31] Then if that was going to be the case.

[22:33] But we'll see.

[22:34] I think we're going to have answers, Greg, within a week or two.

[22:37] And I saw Keith L. Wins put up, did you see his Facebook post with the two weeks woman

[22:42] from, yeah, they always do that.

[22:44] I mean, it's, yeah.

[22:45] Yeah.

[22:46] But I think I don't think it's two weeks.

[22:47] I think it's a week.

[22:48] I think Stern is annoyed that I hear stuff and I predict reveal dates.

[22:53] And they, I think they try to throw people off.

[22:55] But we're going to see it soon.

[22:57] And that shit doesn't surprise me with them at all.

[22:59] I think that they do do that.

[23:00] I legitimately am like conspiracy theorist on that.

[23:04] Right.

[23:05] That they hear something like that, like, you know, a podcaster or somebody that has some

[23:08] influence, shoot their mouth off about something.

[23:11] And when it's right, they deliberately go fuck you.

[23:14] And they change it just despite that person.

[23:17] Well, Zach, Zach in the marketing team over there, they should just realize that they're

[23:21] always trying to like kind of go at my credibility.

[23:24] But they just, they need to realize I don't have any credibility.

[23:28] So it doesn't matter.

[23:30] I can't lose any more credibility.

[23:31] I've had zero.

[23:32] Well, it's exciting.

[23:34] Can you use to have it?

[23:35] What happened?

[23:36] I know.

[23:37] I know.

[23:38] I've had some bad rumors thrown my way.

[23:42] But I'm excited because you know why I'm excited because I always think whenever Stern

[23:46] game comes out, there's a lot of excitement because the games ship very closely to the

[23:51] reveal.

[23:52] And they just, they just give us big blockbuster themes and allow us the opportunity

[23:57] to go in on it.

[23:59] And there's going to be three tiers of models of it.

[24:02] And it's just exciting.

[24:03] I think Stern games, you know, they cheer people up when they get revealed.

[24:08] And I think that I think right now the hobby needs a little bit more of like games available

[24:13] without drama that we can discuss and debate and play.

[24:18] I agree.

[24:19] And I think Stern just needs this.

[24:22] I don't know how you feel like.

[24:24] You know, musters came out.

[24:25] That was a big huge reveal.

[24:27] But I still feel like that for the most part, it was kind of a let down.

[24:32] You take black night, black night.

[24:34] It's fun.

[24:35] It's a good game.

[24:36] But still, I wouldn't say a let down, but it's just not a huge theme.

[24:40] So like I feel like that we have it.

[24:42] It feels like forever that we haven't seen like a great theme.

[24:45] And I think Stern needs this because if I had to guess, I would say that the sales of

[24:51] black night and stuff hasn't been the best.

[24:53] So I think that they are looking forward to this and it could be a huge, huge opportunity

[24:58] for them to kind of, you know, rain in from that that first, second quarter, you know,

[25:05] earnings with this pin.

[25:07] Absolutely.

[25:08] And I've been saying on the show, I think Stern's last four releases have been sort of

[25:11] Luke warm and sort of middle of the road, Deadpool, Beatles, Monsters and black night.

[25:16] None of them are, you know, a list, all star games that are flying off the shelves.

[25:23] They're just not.

[25:24] It's not.

[25:25] Yeah.

[25:26] And I heard something and I'm going to, this is why I have no credibility, but I heard someone

[25:30] who has played, I'm not going to name names, they've played the next three Stern machines.

[25:36] And it's not Jared because Jared says everything is the greatest thing ever.

[25:39] I love Jared's death.

[25:40] Everything's epic.

[25:43] They said, just wait.

[25:45] Stern is about to blow it away in 2019, 2020.

[25:48] And I'm excited because I do think Stern is, if we look at their progression, they keep

[25:53] improving and listening to what people want.

[25:56] They put the LCD in, they've improved the artwork.

[25:58] They have Frenchies back over there.

[26:00] They're French and Zambia, they are doing stuff with them.

[26:03] The mechanisms are next.

[26:04] That is the final piece of Stern domination is just getting the mechs and the toys where

[26:10] they should be for the price of these games.

[26:12] And I firmly believe they're going to get there and everyone else is going to have a hard

[26:16] time competing with Stern come the next year.

[26:20] Well, you know what I agree with you on that because that is something that I actually

[26:24] heard to, like I heard it about this next game.

[26:27] I heard that it was going to blow us away, that it was going to be different and it was

[26:33] going to be amazing.

[26:36] And I agree with you on Stern Fix and stuff.

[26:38] That's all that thing is Stern kind of comes out and they almost like they buck against

[26:43] what people are saying and what they want.

[26:46] But then they end up ultimately changing it for the better, just like the code situation.

[26:49] Yeah, the games are still not coming out super complete, but you normally have an update

[26:54] within two weeks that really fixes a lot of the issues and really boosts it up.

[26:59] And like you said, there's a whole team coding for the most part now.

[27:02] So you are getting, you know, new code that comes out, you know, once every two weeks,

[27:07] once every month now where you're not waiting six months or a year for a game to get complete.

[27:11] So they've satisfied that in people.

[27:14] And just like you said, they'll see they've satisfied everything else.

[27:16] And I do think that the only major complaint left is toys and mechs.

[27:21] And I honestly think that this next game even is where we're going to start to kind of

[27:27] see that start to take hold.

[27:29] I agree.

[27:30] I agree.

[27:31] So interesting, right, with this new game coming out in a couple weeks and Willy Wonka,

[27:36] let's talk about Wonka because that game is shipping and Ellie's are on the line and

[27:41] it's going to get competitive because Stern's going to throw their new game into the ring.

[27:45] Let's talk about Wonka.

[27:46] I mean, Jack did a great thing in terms of hitting his deadline for shipping.

[27:51] You know, it came out exactly when he said it would right before 4th of July.

[27:55] There's been a lot of debate about Wonka.

[27:58] What are your thoughts on Wonka?

[28:00] And I want to have a little conversation about like, you know, how this game is taking

[28:03] shape.

[28:04] Oh, man, I like it.

[28:08] It shoots good.

[28:09] It's a good game.

[28:10] It's fun.

[28:12] It's just not like, you know, it's one of those things I have a slight disconnect from

[28:16] just because it's just not the theme for me like it is somebody like Zach who just is

[28:23] waited forever for this theme and like, it's his Jurassic Park to him.

[28:29] So I have a little bit of a disconnect from it, but it's still, it's a pretty game.

[28:33] It shoots good.

[28:34] It's fun.

[28:35] People are not complaining about it.

[28:37] I don't get pirates.

[28:39] I still like pirates a lot better, but I think that it's a good solid game.

[28:43] And I think that lower price point on that, that standard is good for them.

[28:48] And I think that they're going to finally see some decent sales off of a game.

[28:52] Do you think pirates is the last truly fully featured JJP game?

[28:59] And when I say fully featured, do you remember what Jack said way back?

[29:03] I think people forget what Jack said.

[29:04] He said Wizard of Oz will be the worst game we ever make.

[29:08] We're going to keep putting more in and making the games better.

[29:11] And I think we've seen that ambition carry through into the other games questionable

[29:17] whether or not Hobbit had as much.

[29:19] But I think people are looking at Wanka in comparison to Waz and saying, are we simplifying

[29:27] this, this company, right?

[29:29] And is JJP almost now just another stern?

[29:33] I mean, his ambition at the beginning was to always put a lot more.

[29:36] Do you think Wanka has that a lot more?

[29:39] Do you think people are looking at like?

[29:41] No.

[29:42] No.

[29:43] I think that that was my major.

[29:47] And I won't say it was a complaint, but that's what I noticed.

[29:50] That was my first impressions of when I first laid eyes on that game was that I expected

[29:56] a Waz.

[29:57] I expected a pirate's type thing where you had this, maybe this full sculpted candy factory

[30:03] in there with, I don't know.

[30:06] I don't know what I expected.

[30:07] I expected more toys and more sculpts or something.

[30:10] And it did.

[30:11] It seemed stripped down to me.

[30:16] And I don't know if they just got to a point of where they said, listen, we need sales.

[30:20] We need to make a little more money.

[30:23] And this is what they did.

[30:26] Willing carry on into the next couple of games.

[30:31] I don't know.

[30:32] Yeah.

[30:33] I don't know, man.

[30:34] It's hard to say.

[30:36] We don't know, right?

[30:37] I mean, all we can do is speculate.

[30:38] I do think there must have been a push.

[30:41] We've got to get more games on location that are reliable.

[30:45] And that, I mean, pirates was a nightmare for them in terms of reliability and complexity,

[30:50] right?

[30:51] Well, yeah.

[30:52] And it's hard because the thing is, it's like, Eric, Eric, it's a weird thing because

[30:57] we all bitched about that.

[30:59] That's what we wanted.

[31:00] We wanted different stuff.

[31:01] And Eric took that step and stepped outside of the box and created new mechs and did things.

[31:08] But inherently, when you do that, it's hard.

[31:13] And I know that they go through a lot of testing.

[31:15] I've seen some of this stuff.

[31:19] They go through rigorous testing.

[31:21] Like it is crazy the testing of those games and those mechs that that JJP does.

[31:27] But it's still, when you create new things, you're going to have problems because it's

[31:32] not that proven, you know, spinner or coil or something that's been around for 30 years.

[31:40] And I think you're always going to have some problems with that.

[31:42] But I just don't want that to hinder someone like Eric.

[31:45] Like I wish that they could find a way to make those mechs more reliable, give them more

[31:48] time, do something to get everything to where it needs to be for location and everything

[31:54] else and to maybe think about.

[31:57] Like when we first talked to Eric about pirates, you know, that spinning disc, he was like,

[32:01] listen, it's simple to remove.

[32:02] You know, if it breaks, it's simple to remove.

[32:05] So the thought process was there for him to make these games location reliable.

[32:11] Right.

[32:11] And so I don't think that that was out of his head.

[32:13] I just think things popped up in any engineering situation that was just difficult to overcome

[32:20] from a cost perspective for JJP.

[32:22] If that makes sense.

[32:24] Yeah.

[32:25] I think a lot of the issues with pirates, for me, it's not Eric's engineering.

[32:32] I just think it's the line workers.

[32:35] We don't talk about this a lot, but there are a lot of them are temp workers that come

[32:39] in and out of JJP.

[32:40] They don't have the same dedicated, always on staff that Stern does.

[32:46] And when you're making a complex toy like a pinball machine and you're not doing it every

[32:50] day or it's new to you, imagine that's your first game you're putting together is pirates.

[32:55] I mean, that's hard.

[32:56] Yeah.

[32:57] So I think a lot of people are lazy anyways.

[32:59] When you, I hate to say that, but I mean, I had a business to wear that I depended on

[33:04] laborers and I depended on people to do a good job.

[33:08] And it's not your company and not your business.

[33:11] People do not want to put in the effort.

[33:12] And you know what I'm saying?

[33:14] Like, even if you pay them pretty good money, it's hard to find those people who are like,

[33:20] you know what, that screw's got to go in right.

[33:21] I've got to have this thing tip top.

[33:24] You know, it's like, oh, that screws a little crooked and loose.

[33:26] Go whatever, pass it on down the line.

[33:29] You know what I'm saying?

[33:30] They don't take that time to correct it.

[33:31] They're just wanting to get off work, wanting to go back to their families, wanting to

[33:34] do their thing.

[33:35] So I think that that's a huge challenge just in society as it is.

[33:42] But I do think it comes down to a lot of that, man, because a lot of the problems is,

[33:45] like you said, it's not Eric's engineering on it.

[33:48] It wasn't JJP's quality per se.

[33:51] A lot of it seemed to be with things that just weren't put together right on the line

[33:56] that you're seeing, you know, the problems.

[33:58] So I think I can agree with that, man.

[34:00] Well, speaking of things, not put together right and to circle back to the one big albatross

[34:05] on my shoulder with Willy Wonka, it's the code.

[34:10] And I love the way the game shoots.

[34:11] I love the way the game shoots.

[34:13] And I was about to, you know, I might do a podcast called Catastrophe, Cat's Tastrophe,

[34:18] because I think Joe Catz needs to go back and watch the movie and just put in, I'm on

[34:25] a crusade, Greg, to get the, the audio to be put into the movie clips.

[34:31] It makes no sense to me.

[34:34] And I, I, I don't understand.

[34:36] They have the rights to it.

[34:38] And that's the part that kills me is they pay all that money and they have all the rights

[34:42] to it.

[34:43] And we were talking about Bill and Ted's, right?

[34:44] It's a, imagine making Bill and Ted's adventure and you decide to design it where it's not

[34:49] story-based.

[34:50] It's not the way the movie goes from, you know, them realizing they have the past or history

[34:55] exam.

[34:56] Like you need to go that progression to get to that wizard mode where they're all on

[34:59] stage at the end, right?

[35:01] Yeah.

[35:02] So the thing I've been pointing at is Willy Wonka is an amazing story.

[35:06] And this is how I get an argument with Zach.

[35:07] Zach, you're right.

[35:08] Zach is, it's his dream theme and he's like, put up any game ever and it's better than

[35:12] that.

[35:13] And I have to have an argument with you about this.

[35:15] And he will.

[35:16] He'll point out why it's better than every game ever made.

[35:19] And but for me, it's like if you love the Willy Wonka story, how do you, when you play

[35:24] the pin experience, how do you code it in a way where the final objective is not to obtain

[35:30] the chocolate factory, get in the wonkivator and the whole machine's rumbling, right?

[35:35] As the wonkivator is like breaking through the ceiling and then the, I would have a beautiful

[35:39] final wizard mode.

[35:40] So Craig, like they're in back again.

[35:42] Remember the music when Charlie and his dad and Willy are in the elevator and they're

[35:45] going over the city?

[35:47] Like that should have been like this final like they're in back again mode with this like

[35:51] beautiful music and you're making shots as they talk to each other in the wonkivator.

[35:55] It's just, it's just not, it just doesn't come to life that way for me.

[36:00] And I, I don't know why they made it more about, you know, just collecting wonka bars, exchanging

[36:06] them for jackpots.

[36:08] You hear the modes, but you don't see them per se.

[36:10] You know, it's just, I don't know.

[36:11] I just think they approached it in a very strange way and I can't quite get over it.

[36:16] Well, and I think that that's a problem with a lot of pins that come from themes like

[36:21] that, you know, and I don't know if it's a fear if it's just not people understanding

[36:27] what they need to do because you know, you ghost busters.

[36:30] I mean, Dwight got reamed on that for making that linear in a sense.

[36:35] You know what I'm saying?

[36:37] But I like that.

[36:38] I like that, that, that mode progression that tells the story that the movie does.

[36:44] It's not just based on the movie.

[36:45] You live the movie.

[36:48] And ghost busters went in linear and that like you, you still had options to start.

[36:53] You didn't start off with the exact same mode.

[36:55] You could start off with one of three.

[36:58] And I like that.

[36:59] Like I thought about that with something like stranger things.

[37:02] I was, you know, as I was watching that season three, I was like, so I was like,

[37:05] how great would it be?

[37:07] Because I've always been an advocate, Zach and I both for like, I, like, I scary pin something

[37:12] to actually kind of terrifies you when you're playing it.

[37:14] And I was like, how great would it be if it started off all fun loving and it was kind

[37:18] of goofy and nostalgic eighties.

[37:20] But then as you progress and you got into the demigorgan demigorgan, demigorgan,

[37:26] all the color goes out.

[37:27] Everything goes just everything is like, how the light is white and black.

[37:30] Yeah, it'd be amazing.

[37:31] Yeah, everything gets dark and scary.

[37:34] And then you're having to battle them.

[37:35] And as it progresses, like you're living the series in itself to where that shit is

[37:40] just gotten really real and gotten serious.

[37:43] And I think that would be fun.

[37:45] But it's like, how do you convey that in a way to where that you still have options?

[37:49] Right.

[37:50] And you're not just going on this one path every time.

[37:53] But, but, and yeah, no, I agree.

[37:55] But I think what kills me.

[37:57] And this is again, it's like, you can't, I think sometimes people look at each new release

[38:01] Greg in a vacuum of like, let's just look at it.

[38:04] And let's just be happy we have it.

[38:05] And let's just say everything is awesome.

[38:07] And like, don't compare it to what's come before it.

[38:10] And what frustrates me about Pimball is there are just so many great pins from

[38:15] yesterday that have done exactly what you describe or create, you know, story-based

[38:20] game with modes that are super awesome that also give you the freedom to select options.

[38:25] You know, like Lord, the Rings is a good example of that.

[38:26] Like those three movies, all those great modes and all the great scenes come to life

[38:30] and destroy the ring is a great moment there and back again is a great moment.

[38:34] And then you have the final Valinor Wizard mode.

[38:36] It's like all right there.

[38:37] Right. And so if I'm yeah, coding a game today, I would look at games like that.

[38:42] Look at games like Batman.

[38:43] Like how are games the best coded games out there?

[38:47] How are they approaching it?

[38:48] And when I heard them talk about how they design this game,

[38:52] it just sound like they wanted to do something different.

[38:55] And that's my big issue.

[38:57] Don't destroy what I love about a theme because of your desire to make it different.

[39:04] Give me what I want.

[39:07] And it's been done before many times.

[39:09] And that's my big gripe and you know, it's not going to change.

[39:12] I mean, I think Joe said it like it is what it is, right?

[39:15] What you see, he said what you see is what you get.

[39:18] And I think, you know, we might just have to accept it and it's fine.

[39:23] I am not right now going to get a Willy Wonka because it's just that's not what I'm

[39:27] looking for in the game.

[39:29] Yeah, I mean, that's the way I am.

[39:31] Like I said, I'm just not big on the theme or anything else.

[39:34] I like the price point.

[39:35] I think it's a beautiful machine, but it's just not something that's

[39:40] for me.

[39:42] They're going to sell a lot.

[39:43] Jack, it's a beautiful game.

[39:45] It will sell.

[39:45] I do.

[39:46] And I can't comment on the code to me.

[39:48] Like I just haven't put the time into it to get

[39:52] to where right now where that I can comment on

[39:55] Joe's stuff.

[39:58] I've obviously read a lot on it, but you know,

[40:00] always try to hold those opinions until I actually

[40:04] get in there and get on it.

[40:06] So speaking of reveals to, did you see Slash from Guns and Roses in a media

[40:12] interview confirmed what we all already know that had a game is next?

[40:17] What are your thoughts on Guns and Roses?

[40:20] I don't know, man.

[40:21] I think it'll be great.

[40:23] I like the original data.

[40:24] East Guns and Roses.

[40:25] Although that was a solid game, man.

[40:26] It was good.

[40:31] I think it's going to sell good.

[40:33] Yeah, people debate.

[40:34] I see this debate on Pinside that Guns and Roses is relevant and nobody cares.

[40:38] And yet they're the largest grossing tour of all time last year.

[40:41] So who's right?

[40:42] The daddy doesn't lie.

[40:44] Yeah, I mean, no, I think it'll sell good.

[40:46] And I think it's true.

[40:47] It's timeless classic music that people don't get tired of.

[40:52] Who's ever said I get tired of listening to Guns and Roses?

[40:57] Nobody.

[40:57] So I think it's going to sell good.

[40:59] I think that's a good thing.

[41:03] Welcome to the jungle.

[41:04] The energy when Welcome to Jungle comes, you know, start to look better

[41:07] song to start a pinball experience.

[41:12] I just hope my concern about it is only one thing.

[41:15] I just don't want to see the new band with like, you know,

[41:18] Sam Kinness and Axel up there.

[41:19] I want to see like, I hope they do like a stylized,

[41:24] almost like the way Metallica's pin looks and arosmith.

[41:27] Like, you know, the more of the cartoonish sort of stylized gun.

[41:31] Not ACBC.

[41:33] No, you don't want ACBC.

[41:35] No, no, yes.

[41:36] But if you look at like, the old T-shirts from back in Guns and Roses heyday and the

[41:40] usual illusion error, like they had like a lot of awesome hand-drawn art as part of like the

[41:45] band's visual representation.

[41:47] You know, even the appetite for destruction cross, like I don't know if I just don't want to see like

[41:51] Photoshop's of of modern day Axel up.

[41:54] I just don't think that's the actual.

[41:56] Yeah, it won't be.

[41:59] No, there's no way it's going to be like modern Axel.

[42:02] I mean, there's no way.

[42:04] I think that you'll have to see the band members in some form on there.

[42:09] It definitely will not be modern Axel.

[42:11] I mean, we'll see.

[42:12] He's a little bloated.

[42:13] Like you said, very Sam Kinnesson.

[42:16] Right.

[42:16] Curious to see how many Chinese democracy songs make it on, I would assume a couple, but

[42:22] yeah, because the members are pretty good.

[42:23] They're awesome.

[42:24] I love the album, but I argue with people about it.

[42:26] It's like fine.

[42:27] It's like I tell people it's like a rare cognac.

[42:29] You have to really appreciate all the notes in each song because the layering in the tracks,

[42:34] it's overproduced beyond belief, but there's so much genius, but it's buried under a wall

[42:39] of other genius stuff going on that it's not relatable like the original guns.

[42:44] All right, let's talk October Fest because in the midst of all of this,

[42:48] American Pimball is shipping October Fest in July, which I always said is a kind of strange thing.

[42:54] What are your thoughts on the game?

[42:55] And do you think, and I've reached out to distributors, I know sales are not great.

[42:59] And I can tell you, I saw something a week ago, Greg.

[43:02] I don't know if you saw this.

[43:03] On the 4th of July, American Pimball offered 10% off the game.

[43:10] I've never seen a manufacturer offer a $750 discount on a new inbox game,

[43:15] which must indicate that sales are not great.

[43:20] I mean, I don't know how sales are either.

[43:24] I would take that same, I would play off of that too, honestly.

[43:32] I like the game.

[43:32] I still think it's a fun game.

[43:34] I still think that it needs polish in the aspects that everyone,

[43:39] like, see, when I say it needs, I've never been a complainer of the play field.

[43:43] I've never complained about that.

[43:45] When I first laid eyes on it, and Balser, we got to see it, I was actually blown away with

[43:51] way it looked.

[43:52] I still think that it could have went in such a horrible direction.

[43:56] I think it looked fun.

[43:58] I think it was bright, it was colorful, it was neat.

[44:01] I do think that Josh needs to still, they need to bring in that graphic designer to work on

[44:06] the LCD animations and to make that cohesive.

[44:11] They would have a good package.

[44:12] I think that it's a fun game.

[44:14] It shoots fun, the modes that Josh created are fun and unique.

[44:18] The one-handed fun can be your thing is fantastic.

[44:21] That is a blast to play.

[44:24] It just needs that cohesion and that polish.

[44:30] I hate to say this, but I think that it runs into that dialed-in scenario, man.

[44:36] I think that you could get away with Houdini.

[44:38] I think that if Houdini would not have been such a tough game, Houdini would have sold

[44:43] fantastically because even though it's an unlicensed theme, Houdini is a character and an entity

[44:50] to himself that is almost like Terminator or, you know what I'm saying, or Jurassic Park.

[44:56] Right, that's the same theme.

[44:57] When you go into October Fest, it gets into that dialed-in scenario, not as bad as dialed-in.

[45:06] Because it's still beer and it's still a festival that exists.

[45:11] But I still think that you get into one of those things aware that I still think theme is so

[45:16] underrated in a collector's mind and who buys pinball machines because dialed-in is one of the

[45:23] greatest shooting pins of all time and nobody lets it set in their collection.

[45:28] Because you just don't want dialed-in there.

[45:31] You would rather have a theme that makes you happy when you look at it.

[45:34] And I think that that's sort of where October Fest falls in at.

[45:38] And I think that if there is dismal sales, I think that it can kind of be attributed

[45:44] still back to the theme in a sense.

[45:46] And which is an interesting point and I absolutely agree with you is that the next theme for them,

[45:52] because they're working on the next game and they're scaling up the factory.

[45:55] It's a little always, it's what's confusing to me about AP is I keep scaling up without sales.

[46:01] It's like, you know, spooky pinball, they started slowly and as they became more successful,

[46:08] they scaled up. I think AP, this next game, I think it's a make-up break moment.

[46:13] I mean, they need a hit.

[46:15] And so the themes we saw, like Sherlock Holmes and was it Robin Hood and Valkyrie and Polka Run.

[46:23] I mean, I don't know, right? I get nervous that I don't know what market research they're doing.

[46:29] And Dobbles got money. I mean, he's got money. His dad's got a multi-million dollar company.

[46:37] And why can't they go get a good theme? I don't understand it.

[46:42] You're going to sell 5,000 of a licensed theme people want. You're going to sell 500 of Robin Hood.

[46:48] Well, I was discussing that with somebody. I was like, you know, they told me that roughly what are

[46:53] you at for, and you may know this, tell me you're inside on this. When a lot of themes, like if you

[46:59] were to go pick up a license, somebody told me that you're roughly looking at $100,000 for that

[47:06] license. So you're, you know, $100 bucks a machine, $200 are 200 a machine for the license.

[47:15] The pen on what you sell, obviously. Let's say 200. Like that, that's not a huge markup

[47:22] to be able to sell twice the number of machines that you did previously on a non-licensed theme.

[47:30] So I kind of think that it's a no-brainer to go in that direction. I think I understand what they're

[47:36] doing. I like the fact that they're trying to fill that void of the non-licensed machines. But I

[47:43] think as much as we all bitch about non-licensed machines, we're finding that we really don't want

[47:49] that we don't that we're not buying them as much as we complain and we bitch, hey man, bring

[47:54] back the heyday. Let's see these non-licensed machines. I think that enough of them have been

[47:58] released now, including Black Knight. And that was sort of a theme unto itself that, you know,

[48:04] Richie created, you know, that kind of falls in that Houdini-esque category in a marginal way.

[48:11] But I think we're fine if we don't really want them. No. And Black Knight's been in terms of stern.

[48:18] It's been like abysmal sales, you know, in terms of what Stern normally does in terms of volume.

[48:24] People don't want them. People, you know, and look, the years who's saying they want them, it's like

[48:29] the, you know, more of the old school guys. And a lot of those guys are not new inbox buyers. And

[48:36] and we've tried it. We've tried it with dialed in. We've tried it with, you know, I would say TNA

[48:42] was successful because it was a lot of how to do with Scott, a lot of it had to do with the good

[48:48] world to community. A lot of it had to do with that. He just brought out a game that was just

[48:51] different and fast and and and there were there was no game like that new inbox available for people,

[48:57] right? There were all these like deeper ball time games. And I think he hit the and the light show

[49:01] was amazing. The sound was amazing. And it was a simple approach to the pimple that people

[49:05] appreciated. But let's not fool ourselves like he's not going to sell like 2000 of them. And

[49:12] and and I think spooky was the right company to make it. But American pimple, I mean, I'm nervous

[49:18] that these guys don't really have a plan. And I think they keep going at it. And it's the same

[49:23] team. And that's that's why I'm like, man, if it's just going to be the same four, five,

[49:30] you know, leadership team over there doing it, I don't see how it keeps getting better. I think

[49:35] they need to bring in new blood. I think they need to get a license theme. And I think they need

[49:39] more than one designer. I do. I think they need to figure this out because and I don't know if not,

[49:46] you know, dermal, not did I just combine them? Dermal, dermal, double and normal. I just don't get

[49:54] the sense that these guys love pimple. And I think you need to love it and live it. And and I don't

[50:01] know. I think they have a they're trying to figure it out. But well, but I also think that it goes

[50:06] like I think that the main problem is is that you need somebody that is going to oversee almost

[50:15] be a production manager of it to bring all the thoughts and everything together. Because I would

[50:24] say that that Joe and Josh are the main forces behind every pin. Obviously, they're the

[50:33] coder and the designer. But I think that, you know, again, you have four or five people over there

[50:38] that are all throwing ideas in. And I think that when you live in that world and you are the only four

[50:44] or five people at AP that are designing the games, I think it's so easy to get lost in your own worlds

[50:51] and incorporate your own ideas of what you personally feel is good and that you would love and

[50:58] that you would love to see. And that does not necessarily resonate into pinball sales or what the

[51:05] community wants or needs. And so I think that you just need somebody that can step in and that can say,

[51:15] I'm sorry to hurt your feelings, but this just does not work. Or hey, this is a great idea,

[51:20] but we need to make this cohesive. We need to bring the artwork to match, you know, the design.

[51:26] And we need to bring the LCD animations to make it all cohesive. So it's like one person designed

[51:30] the game instead of two, three or four different people that designed one game because it's almost

[51:36] like that you can only see that mash up in there. But again, like fucking Houdini was I still

[51:44] think that that game on every level was gorgeous. It was a tough shooter. I will not deny that it

[51:51] was my kind of game once you get into it and once you learn the style of it, it plays well. But

[51:56] that was the only thing I think to help that back. I thought that I still went in advocate for the

[52:00] animations. I look, but I think if they use the Matt Andrews artwork that J-pop designed for

[52:08] Houdini, they would have sold two to three times as many. I do. I could have, but I mean, I don't,

[52:13] I do, I do mixed on it. I do because I still think it was one of the most gorgeous pinball

[52:18] machines ever made. And I remember that artwork and it was cool artwork, but I was not disappointed

[52:24] by this stuff. Yeah, it was a little dark though. The steam punky look for me was a little like,

[52:29] didn't pop the way J-pop stuff pops. Yeah, yeah, I didn't pop, but it was classy. It was more regal,

[52:36] I never got tired of looking at it. Do you have one? I just, I did have, I got rid of it

[52:43] about a month ago. I had it for a long time, man. I loved it. I'm actually missing it.

[52:49] No, I mean, okay, well, we'll see. I mean, when do you think AP shows their next game?

[52:53] I think that I think that there'll be a push. It's kind of been a thing last year with them

[53:02] coming to Exbo and they're releasing a game sort of it seems every year around that mark. They're

[53:07] pretty good about that. It's been two games, but they're pretty good about that. So I think that we'll

[53:12] see an Exbo reveal. They need to show it in the window though, right? I mean, they reveal that

[53:18] Exbo and then they six months before our October 5th shift. Yeah, I mean, I'm going to again,

[53:23] just like the problems with JGP. I'm a huge advocate for that. That is the best thing that Stern does

[53:29] is announce a game, release a game. I do think that they do need to do that because I think

[53:36] that that was a little bit of the downfall of October 5th is that that heard it a little bit.

[53:43] It hurts every game when you got that line. Nobody is celebrating October 5th in July.

[53:50] Let's talk about the ever-so-mysterious, the company that will make more games in 2019 and any

[53:56] Pimble manufacturer in the history of Pimble with the only company using Octo manufacturing.

[54:03] Deeper. What do you think? No, Vembers come in fast for these guys. What do you expect? We're

[54:09] going to see with Raza. I have not. I think that Robert has to make good on that. I think we

[54:18] have to see it. I think it has to be flippable. As in terms of where the company is going, I don't

[54:27] know, man. They're pretty secretive. Robert's got a lot of shit on lockdown. I don't know.

[54:35] How do you spell two years? Two years, right? All these salaries, all these paychecks, all these

[54:43] developers saying money. It's insane money. There's no money coming in. I mean,

[54:48] the money is coming in. It's coming in from Deeproot funds. That's the part people don't

[54:53] realize. The Pimble venture of Deeproot is a small arm of a much larger financial institution.

[55:02] Same as who's paying for Jersey Jack to develop. It's not sales of the games. It's the billionaire.

[55:08] That's backing. Same thing with Stern. Stern is backed by investors. They are also pumping money

[55:14] and taking money out as profit rolls in. They've got a lot. I just think we don't know anything.

[55:21] But all I have to say is I think Raza needs the below people away. They can't afford to have

[55:31] a lukewarm reception after all the boasting they did. If they didn't know boasting, be different.

[55:38] We might look at them with different opinions.

[55:42] Yeah, because I always like to under promise and over deliver. I always think that that's a

[55:47] motto everyone should live by. That's the only thing that scares me is you know what happens when

[55:52] you pump something up so bad. Even if it's really good, it fails in the comparison of the hype.

[56:02] And that kills the flow of the game and where it's going to go in sales.

[56:07] And that's what happened when I had Willy Wonka. No, everybody was mad. You did it.

[56:11] You did it. I did it. I did it. You were the downfall of Willy Wonka. I was.

[56:18] You know what? Do you not think it's true? It might be. I think you so override that game.

[56:24] I actually did. I mean, it's still good. I told Joe Katz. Don't put any voice clips in with the video.

[56:30] Trust me. It's the right thing to do Joe. It's amazing. But yeah, I don't think Raza is a

[56:38] maker break for the company. I think it depends on how many games and how far along they are on

[56:45] them of how fast that they can bounce back from Raza with a good game. Because if they truly do have

[56:52] three, four, five games, almost ready to be released if Raza is kind of dismal. But then they can

[56:59] pump out two games right there that they've already worked on already spent the money on. And

[57:04] those can be successes or at least moderates successes. I think that they they survive and

[57:11] seeing you to go on. But do you think Greg? People are just out of space because I don't think people

[57:18] are out of money. There's enough money in this hobby. But who's got room for deep root, stern,

[57:24] American, Jersey Jack, Chicago gaming. We didn't even talk about cactus Canyon. The pinball

[57:29] brothers are coming back out with alien. It's happening. I'm telling you people it's going to happen.

[57:33] All these games, right? Where is it? Are we going to see more of an explosion in location play?

[57:40] And that's where a lot of these games will end up or do you do you think homeowners are just going

[57:44] to get to the point where I mean, I'm at a room. And if to move stuff out, there's not going to be

[57:49] a lot of buyers because everyone wants the new stuff because there's so much new stuff coming.

[57:54] Well, you know, we're almost not seeing a reflection of that though because I sort of think that if

[58:01] that was the case, we would see a massive drop in used pinball sales for new games. But what are we

[58:10] seeing in a stern? You pick a stern up for what? $5,600 for a pro. We're seeing $4,900. Now $700

[58:17] loss is pretty good. But they've hung forever for years almost at that $47 to $4,900 range for a

[58:26] used pin. And I think that we would see that drop significantly so that people could move those

[58:32] games out for a new game. I think the oversaturation could hurt. I just don't think people are

[58:42] necessarily comfortable losing that amount of money. I think as much money is in this hobby,

[58:47] a lot of people don't, there are people that do, but a lot of people don't have a grand 1500 to throw

[58:55] away just to try a new pin out. So I think that you end up with all these companies. And I think that

[59:05] like everybody's going to have to distribute the same number of pins around. Right.

[59:11] Personally, I get it personally and maybe selfishly because I want the magic in the world

[59:19] on their glass. I really hope and I think it's going to happen. I think used pin sales and used

[59:25] pin prices are going to significantly decrease in the next couple of years. And I actually am glad

[59:32] that's going to happen. You can look at it like it'll get more people in because it's more

[59:36] approachable and affordable. But here's why I'm also glad. If people know that these games will

[59:42] significantly lose value in a short period of time, it does two things. It forces manufacturers to

[59:49] make great things that people want to own and keep. Right. You got to be magical or you're not

[59:55] going to have a buyer because there's going to be so many games I could get for cheap that are

[59:59] from yesterday or is there still great games. It's also going to force buyers to not do what they're

[01:00:05] doing now. It just run it everything because there hasn't been that much available even though it

[01:00:09] seems like it. You know, a lot of these companies are still slow to get to market. It's going to force

[01:00:14] buyers to stop and think more. I don't want to lose $2,000. I don't want to lose $3,000. And I'm going

[01:00:21] to make sure that the game is something that I want to keep for a very long time because it's special.

[01:00:26] And both sides will have to push towards making sure that games are great or else your sales will

[01:00:32] be crap. Your resell will be crap. And most likely your company will be crap. So that's why

[01:00:39] I think it's going to be only the strong survive in the next like two years that we can't have.

[01:00:44] Well, I would agree. Yeah. I think it's the same thing like what we were complaining about about how

[01:00:50] that we wanted a, you know, a regional theme. We wanted a regional theme. I think it's the same

[01:00:55] thing with with pinball companies. Yeah, we want more pinball companies, but I don't think that

[01:01:00] the community is large enough at this point to sustain the amount of companies that we have,

[01:01:07] especially if deep root does come onto the scene. I just don't think that we do because like you

[01:01:12] said, like even money aside, like you've only got so much room and collectors homes and stuff. And

[01:01:17] you price points have hit such a high that you have alienated a large portion of the community

[01:01:24] that does exist that can't afford to buy new machines anymore. So it something has to get

[01:01:32] it's either those prices have to drop new inbox or prices have to drop once they're used. Those

[01:01:38] new inbox games drastically drop and then those people are able to buy and get into the hobby,

[01:01:43] which allows those people that are able to take a $1,500 loss to buy the new game from a company.

[01:01:48] Or you're going to see companies kind of start to weed out because that high end person that's

[01:01:55] spending that money. Yep, you know, it's there. Absolutely. And I still think the one part of the

[01:02:00] market that really still hasn't been designed for tapped into in the right way is the high end

[01:02:06] side of the market. There are many high end collectors. I mean, we see it now. People are offering

[01:02:10] coin takeer $20,000 this week to get a Lebowski after they were sold out. And what I'm surprised by

[01:02:16] all these boutiques is that nobody still will just go get a dream theme. Okay, for me, let's say it's

[01:02:25] G1 Transformers. Get the license. Get the Stan bush songs from that movie that are incredible.

[01:02:30] You know, all the dare to be stupid. We're all yank of it. Get that song. Get dare. Get, you know,

[01:02:35] you got the touch. Get the voice actors. Pay for it all. Sell it to me. Make it. Give me everything

[01:02:42] in the kitchen sink with mechanisms, you know, Unicron, the matrix opening up a transformer toy

[01:02:47] that actually transforms sell it to me for $15,000. I don't care because it'll never leave. And it has

[01:02:53] everything I want. And it's a high end like super bespoke pinball machine that and that's the focus

[01:03:00] of it. Nobody's doing that. You know, we see we're seeing like Stern's cell Beatles at 25,000

[01:03:06] right? Just arbitrary limited. It's there's nothing special about it, right? We see art

[01:03:10] pennies like Batman Super early. Nothing really different. You can get the same game for half the

[01:03:15] price. I still think there is a market for that high end. I've said it. Nobody knows how to

[01:03:21] really know. I think everyone's like terrified to go that way. But you again, you can make just 500

[01:03:25] of them and charge a lot and people will buy it if the magic is there. And I also look, I also

[01:03:31] think you can make magical pins for $5,000. And we see that all the time. And I think we're I think

[01:03:35] we're going to see it in Stern's next game. I think it's an exciting time right? Greg to be a buyer,

[01:03:39] right? I mean, the options are so so many. It's almost hard to know like when to actually,

[01:03:47] you know, send the check in because what's next after Jurassic World, right? I mean, I heard a

[01:03:52] virus going to be insanely good. So I'm it's hard. You almost like don't know when to jump in.

[01:03:58] I agree. I mean, and that's sort of, I mean, again, I'm on limited funds. I don't have that unlimited

[01:04:03] stuff. So I have to be picky, you know, about what I do buy. And that's why I've held off on

[01:04:08] buying anything for a while is because I'm waiting to see this Jurassic World or this Jurassic Park.

[01:04:14] And that's where I'm wanting to put my money. And I think there's a lot of people like that where

[01:04:19] that you buy one or two new pins a year, something and you wait it out until you find a theme that fits.

[01:04:27] You find something that you want of where you put that money. And if something does grab your

[01:04:31] attention, now that is taken away from another company for your sales. So I think it kind of goes

[01:04:36] back to what you were saying before about it forces them into making a better pen, a stellar pen

[01:04:43] that's going to drive the majority to that company in that way. And you know, and I don't disagree

[01:04:50] with your high dollar pen thing either. I know you've been advocate for that and you've talked

[01:04:54] about that for a long time. And I think that whatever company does, I think the reason a company does

[01:05:00] not do it is I think that even if their target is the $20,000 pen ball collector that this has

[01:05:08] everything in it, I think that that company is so scared of first of all the financial risk of

[01:05:16] doing something like that. And whether it works or not, but they also think that they're a little bit

[01:05:21] scared of the backlash of the community because even if you're up front and you say, hey, listen,

[01:05:26] this is for the high end collector. People are going to bitch moan and be so upset because

[01:05:32] they want that pinball machine and they can't afford it. And that's where it's going to stem from.

[01:05:36] They won't admit to it, but they'll bitch about it. I agree. And to those people,

[01:05:42] it's like wake up to the real world. Like there's Bugatti's, Lamborghini's and Ferraris. And you

[01:05:48] think car enthusiasts are all around that they exist. Like there's watches that cost like millions of

[01:05:53] dollars. Am I mad that some people can afford them and I can't? See, I think you're right,

[01:05:59] though, Greg. I think there is this feeling. And this is also why I think companies underpriced

[01:06:04] their games in terms of how much they cost to develop because I think there's a fear of that

[01:06:10] blowback that this should be a hobby for everybody and accessible to everybody. But then I look at this

[01:06:18] stuff and I'm like only people who are doing very well financially have the money to buy a 7500

[01:06:26] non-essential toy. I mean, yeah, zoom out the average meaning income in America is like $50,000.

[01:06:33] People don't have money for pinball, they never will. Or they can get a use game, but it's not,

[01:06:39] it is a little bit of a rich man's hobby. At the new inbox level, just because it's really expensive

[01:06:47] to get the themes, get manufacturing started, it's expensive. And most people will never get

[01:06:55] the price of production down to where Stern has it because they don't have 50,000 square foot

[01:07:01] assembly factory with 300 workers every day going in. That's Stern gets the price down because

[01:07:06] of the efficiencies of the organization. But if I was going to start a pinball company today,

[01:07:11] I would aim to be like the Bugatti of pinball. I don't want to be the Toyota Camry market because I

[01:07:17] can't compete with Stern. And everyone's trying to compete with Stern.

[01:07:21] Well, but I think that they have to because the one thing that I will have to

[01:07:27] disagree with is I don't think that I would consider it a rich man's hobby. And the reason that I don't

[01:07:37] I think that you have to have obviously you got to have spare money. You got to have money to

[01:07:42] throw around a little bit. But I don't think it's necessarily a rich man's hobby. And here's why is

[01:07:48] you look all around and you live in a this is our disconnect from the Midwest to New York.

[01:07:56] But you see some of it too. So around here, we have a lot of ATVs and stuff.

[01:08:03] They're $18,000, the UTVs or whatever, your razors and all this side by side. Do you know what I'm

[01:08:09] talking about? I know that that's not your culture up there. But the off road, you know,

[01:08:13] they're almost off the field carts. So you've got a lot of things.

[01:08:19] Yeah, well, I know that. I mean, you know, I know it's not a New York culture up there.

[01:08:24] But around here it is. And you know, those things are not cheap, man. You're $14,000, $18,000.

[01:08:29] You got a lot of boating around here. You know, you got a $30,000 boat, a money pit. It's a money

[01:08:35] pit. You're wasting your money on it. You're throwing it out. Got a lot of guys driving 50,

[01:08:40] $60,000 trucks. And these are median level incomes. You know what I'm saying? Like they're not,

[01:08:48] you know, double all those things. You can't finance a Pimple machine. And I understand that. But I'm

[01:08:55] it's where I think that it's it's where you put your money and how you do it. I think that a lot

[01:08:59] of people are again, like in my situation, it's a one or two new pinball machines, like maybe one

[01:09:05] new in a year, a couple of used ones or something like that. And that doesn't break the bank. Yeah.

[01:09:12] It's just where you prioritize your money. And so I think that that's where all the backlash comes

[01:09:18] is that it's it's it's not a super high end where that so many people are are comfortable losing

[01:09:25] money or spending massive amounts. I think that a lot of them they they pick and choose and they

[01:09:31] do without a lot of other things to be able to buy their Pimple machine because that's their hobby.

[01:09:36] So I think that that's where you get the blowback from in the hobby is I think that a a majority

[01:09:42] are hardworking and everywhere it works hard for their money. So no one take this wrong. But I

[01:09:47] think it's a lot of people who really work hard and they they sacrifice in other aspects of whether

[01:09:52] they're not going out to dinner or they don't go a second family vacation. They don't do this

[01:09:56] things to buy a Pimple machine because that's what they love. So I think it's more of a prioritization

[01:10:00] right of their finances instead of being super high end. But I agree man like for the most part

[01:10:06] I will agree in that aspect. You do have to have that disposable income right to be in pinball.

[01:10:12] Yeah, you're right. I was wrong. I mean it's not you're right. It's not a rich man's hobby. And I'll

[01:10:16] say why because I'm not rich. I mean I know rich people. I mean and I think I do well for a living

[01:10:22] and I'm financially okay and I can afford to buy a pinball machine or two a year. But I can't

[01:10:30] go buy like 10 and I can't go. Yeah, I'm living in a one bedroom in Manhattan. If I was rich rich

[01:10:35] I'd be prioritizing a bigger apartment for me and Brendan and Baba. So you're right.

[01:10:42] But I would ever sin agree with you though that there is that high end market that that is not

[01:10:46] being reached and and I don't I don't personally have a problem with it. It's like you said with

[01:10:51] the bickadies or Ferraris or Lamborghinis or anything. There's a lot of high end shit that I can't buy

[01:10:56] that I'm not mad at someone else because they can and they've worked harder or they've done something

[01:11:01] different in life that's allowed them to achieve that. Like I'm not going to get mad if a company

[01:11:05] comes out with a $20,000 Pimple machine that blows me away. Am I going to be jealous and want that

[01:11:10] yeah. But like we've got some really fucking solid arcades around here with money and I know that

[01:11:18] I will probably see one on location because there's some crazy collectors that will route these

[01:11:22] machines. So it's not one of those things where that I would be disappointing because I never

[01:11:27] get to play it because I honestly think I'd get to play it but I'd just never be able to own it

[01:11:32] and yeah, you know, it's a hard thing to overcome but it's like you said it's life. It's what it's

[01:11:38] what goes on. It also would be fun just to have you know a few of those like high end machines

[01:11:42] just be grail things that maybe one day I'll get one the way we used to hang exotic cars on our

[01:11:48] walls when we were kids and I think we're going to see it. I do. I think I actually think deep

[01:11:53] root is I think Robert has listened to me say it's possible. I mean I heard him say he was going

[01:11:58] to do like a $50,000 Alice in Wonderland and you know if he only makes five of them he'll get it.

[01:12:05] That's just the reality. It doesn't make financial sense only to make five of them. No.

[01:12:10] But that's we know the market can bear some of those crazy prices. Well Greg, I want to thank you

[01:12:16] so much for taking time on your Saturday morning. We're at the hour mark on Canadian

[01:12:20] Pimball Podcast and the only way we stay on top of this Pimball podcasting world. I think we're

[01:12:25] still somewhere near the top is by keeping him short and somewhat sweet. So thank you so much.

[01:12:32] Hey, I appreciate you having me on. You know, I always enjoy conversation with you.

[01:12:36] We got to do this more often. I've been begging you to come back on since the last time you were on

[01:12:39] because people I think people really I think we have a good back and forth. You know, Zach will never

[01:12:43] come on the show. Why won't he come on? Zach is what he's like, it's just not the right time.

[01:12:48] It's like come on Zach. Just say it. You think Canadian's bad for business but Canadian's good for business.

[01:12:54] Whether you're good or bad for business like I don't play into that shit. I think that that's

[01:12:58] that's hindering this hobby a little bit is that it's and I understand I understand some of it.

[01:13:04] I understand Zach stuff. So I'm not knocking him but there's too much politics and there's too

[01:13:09] much bullshit and pinball to start to go on. So I just do my thing dude and like I again,

[01:13:16] love or hate canada. I still fucking enjoy our conversations together. Like I enjoy talking to you.

[01:13:22] So that's why I'm always happy to come on like and I hate that I haven't done it sooner. Just

[01:13:27] life is so busy. Fuck me and Zach haven't even been able to really record and you know,

[01:13:32] I've been antsy to talk some pinball stuff and he's down at Southern Fry doing his thing selling

[01:13:37] pinball machines and and doing all that hard work and stuff. So I was just like I'm gonna

[01:13:42] I want to go on Canadian pinball podcast man. I got to talk to you. Yeah and I love and hate canada too.

[01:13:48] So like we're all on the same boat with this thing. Well Greg, thank you so much man. Have an

[01:13:52] awesome weekend and we will talk to you soon and whenever you get the it just hit me up and

[01:13:57] we'll do this again. Definitely. I think you ran me on again man. Alright brother.
