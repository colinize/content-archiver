[00:00] I love you, that's the truth.

[00:05] You anything you ask me to.

[00:08] C'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya.

[00:12] Aw, Merry Christmas everybody. Welcome to Canada Spinball Podcast.

[00:16] I hope everybody had a great Christmas yesterday.

[00:20] I hope you spent the last few days with friends and family.

[00:23] Camp Canada's been overrun by the Irish sisters.

[00:27] It's been so much fun.

[00:28] Killian is having so much fun.

[00:30] No, there were no pinball related gifts under the tree

[00:34] other than the gifts that Cody gave me.

[00:36] Cody, thank you so much.

[00:38] I want to thank CoinTaker for their gift.

[00:40] And I just want to thank each and every one of you

[00:42] for making my holiday so damn special

[00:45] because the friendships I've made on this show

[00:48] have meant more to me than any presents I unwrapped yesterday.

[00:52] And I absolutely believe that.

[00:54] Thank you everybody. Here's what we're going to do.

[00:55] Let's have a fun end of the year special.

[00:58] The year is over, right?

[00:59] Are there going to be any more pinball releases this year?

[01:02] Is Stern Pinball going to show Jaws in a surprise move this week?

[01:05] I don't think so.

[01:06] So here's what I want to do.

[01:07] I want to look into 2024.

[01:10] And I want to say what kind of year

[01:11] I think each manufacturer is going to have.

[01:14] And I'm going to do it alphabetically.

[01:16] And we're going to make this a really great, fun pinball podcast.

[01:20] And I'm curious if you think my predictions are going to come true.

[01:23] And look, I'm going to do my best to be fair and objective.

[01:27] But not everything I'm going to say is going to be kind

[01:30] because I don't think everyone's going to have a great 2024

[01:33] when it comes to pinball.

[01:34] But I'll say this.

[01:36] After looking at last year's games

[01:39] and after looking at the themes

[01:40] and the mechanical stuff that went into the games,

[01:43] I think everybody is waiting for 2024

[01:48] to return us to a little bit more of the housey and days of old

[01:53] in which the themes were better,

[01:55] the mechanical magic is better,

[01:57] and these games are more masterpieces

[01:59] instead of mastermesses that are losing a lot of money

[02:02] for a lot of people that are jumping in.

[02:04] All right, so let's start this, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:07] Let's go down the list.

[02:08] What kind of 2024 is American Pinball going to have?

[02:11] Now, they did not sell all of the galactic tank forces.

[02:15] And I heard a rumor that unless they sell all of those machines,

[02:19] they're not moving on to the next titles.

[02:21] Now, David Fix will tell you they've got three games in development.

[02:25] He'll probably tell you he's got 17 games in development.

[02:28] And we know that the first two are going to be unlicensed themes.

[02:32] It's going to be the Barry Oh inspired game.

[02:35] And then it's going to be Whitewater 2 from Dennis Nordman.

[02:38] And then it's going to be Ryan McQuade's game,

[02:40] which I think is Cuphead.

[02:42] So do we think we're going to get three American Pinball games

[02:44] out in one year?

[02:45] No, but we definitely need to get a new American Pinball game

[02:49] into the marketplace.

[02:51] Now, look, I'm just going to start this off on a little bit of a sour note.

[02:54] I think American Pinball is going to have a horrible 2024

[02:58] because I don't think anything from Barry Oh's like old portfolio

[03:02] or Whitewater 2 is going to be able to compete

[03:05] with what other companies have coming out in 2024.

[03:08] And I think American Pinball is also not going to sell these galactic tank forces.

[03:12] And the real question for this company becomes this.

[03:15] If this company has a licensed theme that people want,

[03:18] remember the rumors of He-Man,

[03:20] they need to get that game out next.

[03:22] There is no value anymore in Barry Oh's name.

[03:25] There's no value even in Dennis Nordman's name.

[03:28] You either make a great game that everybody wants

[03:31] or you're just going to fail instantly in this pinball hobby.

[03:35] And I think American Pinball is a company that's in jeopardy

[03:39] of closing its doors if it doesn't get people a theme they want

[03:43] and put a lot in it and deliver something that's competitive

[03:47] with the other large manufacturers that are out there.

[03:50] Spooky Pinball has eclipsed them.

[03:52] I just think this company is slowly dying.

[03:55] And I don't even know if it's slowly dying.

[03:57] It's been dying for a while.

[03:58] So I think American Pinball has a really rough 2024.

[04:02] And again, I always believe they need to shake up their leadership team.

[04:05] They're just not delivering.

[04:07] What kind of year is Barrel's a fun going to have, right?

[04:09] This company came out of nowhere with one of the longest teaser campaigns

[04:13] in the history of pinball.

[04:14] They had the weirdest company ever, but they made a game,

[04:17] a labyrinth that was on the line when they revealed the game.

[04:20] The response to labyrinth has been very positive.

[04:23] I don't think they're going to sell all 1100 of these games

[04:27] and that's okay because they are already developing their next two games.

[04:32] And so I expect Barrel's a fun midway through next year

[04:35] to reveal their next game.

[04:37] I think this company is going to make around 700 labyrinth machines.

[04:42] I think orders are going to start to dry up.

[04:44] I think once people start to see labyrinth on the secondhand market,

[04:47] the game's not going to go up in value.

[04:49] Remember, this game with a topper is closer to 12.5.

[04:53] And so look, that's the price of a stern LE.

[04:56] And yes, this game will always be limited because there's no like other versions.

[05:00] There will only be 1100 always.

[05:03] But labyrinth is another theme that's not take my money now theme for most people 40 to 60.

[05:09] I get that there's some affinity for it.

[05:11] And if you love the movie,

[05:12] heck, you are happy because you got this game.

[05:15] But I think we're going to see the next game from Barrel's a fun.

[05:17] And the next game from this company to me is kind of everything

[05:21] because they need to get a little bit more mainstream.

[05:24] Doesn't have to be truly mainstream.

[05:27] But now that we know it's not the fifth element,

[05:30] I think the game that this company might have might be Beetlejuice or it might be Gremlins.

[05:36] And if they have one of those two themes, it makes me happy.

[05:40] Those themes have nostalgia.

[05:42] Those themes have a lot of people who are still in love with those properties.

[05:46] And I do think this company is going to make the right moves when it comes to themes going forward.

[05:51] I think they know they only need to get a license property that has a thousand people out there

[05:57] willing to spend more than $10,000 on it.

[06:00] And everything they've done so far has been done really well.

[06:04] I hope they don't run into any manufacturing hiccups.

[06:07] That is always a challenge with new companies.

[06:10] But for all intents and purposes, I think Barrel's a fun.

[06:13] We will see game number two.

[06:15] I think it'll have more mechanical magic in it than game number one.

[06:18] I think they were getting their feet wet with labyrinth.

[06:21] And I fully expect Barrel's a fun by the end of next year to have their second game on the line

[06:26] and for them to sell out of their second game.

[06:29] I don't think labyrinth will sell out.

[06:31] All right. CGC Chicago gaming company.

[06:35] What kind of 2024 are they going to have?

[06:37] Well, here's the thing.

[06:38] I think their entire year is going to be dominated by making all of the pulp fiction machines.

[06:44] So they're going to be on the line next year.

[06:47] We all know they're finally going to get this game on the line.

[06:50] Obviously, CGC has been dealt to blow that they're no longer remaking Bali Williams games.

[06:56] But I'm not so sure that's the case.

[06:58] I think we have to look at this story.

[07:00] Padrety gaming and pinball brothers will be making Bali Williams remakes.

[07:05] But that doesn't mean that no other remakes will be made by CGC.

[07:09] The whole thing is a little bit confusing to me.

[07:11] But as far as next year and CGC, I fully expect the pulp fictions to take up all of their year.

[07:18] I think the games are going to be well built.

[07:20] I think the delays, though, to get an L.E. are going to be longer than March.

[07:24] And I still think Chicago gaming company and all of their delays has pretty much eroded the enthusiasm around their brand.

[07:32] And I think they need to figure something out.

[07:34] Because it's just not working.

[07:36] Like taking deposits and making people wait forever.

[07:39] They have no social media presence.

[07:42] They don't communicate with their buyers.

[07:44] I don't understand why.

[07:46] If you're going to do something CGC, it's not just the build quality.

[07:50] Do everything right.

[07:52] Do the social media right.

[07:53] Do the correspondence right.

[07:55] Don't reveal a game when it's a year out from being on the line.

[07:59] None of this stuff makes sense.

[08:01] And they've been in the game way too long to be doing stuff still so sloppy.

[08:05] Alright, what kind of year is Dutch pinball going to have?

[08:08] Now look, if you're a Canadian fan, you know what's coming.

[08:12] Back to the freaking future.

[08:14] But if you're also inside Canada's head, you know Dutch pinball might have more than just one trick up its sleeve.

[08:20] I'm not going to say anything more than that.

[08:23] Here's my prediction for Dutch pinball.

[08:25] If all things go according to plan,

[08:28] Dutch pinball will be the talk of pinball in 2024.

[08:32] They have the hottest theme that everybody wants.

[08:36] The people working on that game, not just at Dutch pinball, but within the license and the IP holder,

[08:42] are everybody you want.

[08:44] There's been some false reports and misinformation that Stern passed on this game because there's no assets available.

[08:50] That is 100% false.

[08:52] This game is going to have in it everything you want.

[08:55] As I said, if all goes according to plan, in 2024, they are going to make every single EA Hall who ordered a big Lebowski.

[09:03] For the first time in a decade, Dutch pinball is going to be playing on an equal playing field with everybody else.

[09:10] They are no longer clawing their way out of their debts and their obligations.

[09:15] And Dutch pinball is a company that I am so excited to see what they do next.

[09:19] Because as I've said all these years, I think when you look at a game like the big Lebowski,

[09:24] that's the kind of Valley Williams magic in modern times we've all wanted.

[09:28] Now, here is my prediction for Dutch in 2024.

[09:32] I think they're going to reveal back to the future on back to the future day.

[09:36] I'm not sure the game is going to be on the line when that reveal happens.

[09:41] And I think there's going to be some pressure on their part to hit that date and start taking orders on the game.

[09:48] My concern for Dutch pinball is the same concern everybody has.

[09:52] What do you do with a title that's going to get you 5,000 orders in one day

[09:57] and your company might be making just 10 machines a week?

[10:00] And so I think what's going to be really interesting for Dutch pinball is how they handle all of this.

[10:05] I don't think they're going to outsource production to the European Pinball Corporation.

[10:10] I don't think they're going to ask Stern Pinball to make these games as some people have been saying, which is inaccurate.

[10:15] I think they're in the driver's seat of a DeLorean that everybody wants to jump into.

[10:20] And I think what we're going to see them do is have to price this thing in a way that doesn't destroy their manufacturing line.

[10:28] And by that, I mean, you just don't want to take too many orders, even though you'll get the orders.

[10:34] I could see them doing something like we're going to make 88 SLEs.

[10:38] We're going to make 2,500 LEs.

[10:41] And that's it.

[10:42] You just don't want to take 5,000 to 6,000 to 7,000 orders because look, you're also Dutch pinball.

[10:48] And you don't want to only make this game for the rest of your life.

[10:51] You want to move on to your next game.

[10:53] And I think if I was a creative, I wouldn't want to be stuck making one game forever.

[10:59] And I think Dutch pinball might actually become the one pinball company that I've been waiting for,

[11:04] which is that white glove bespoke high end boutique pinball company that just checks every single box.

[11:11] It's got the mechanical magic.

[11:13] It's got the theme we want.

[11:14] Not everybody has one.

[11:16] It's limited.

[11:16] And even though you're going to spend a lot of money, think about it.

[11:19] Who out there wouldn't rather have a $20,000 back to the future?

[11:24] Or would you rather have Elton John for $12,000 and Venom LE for $13,000?

[11:30] I mean, think about it.

[11:31] A Venom LE and an Elton John are $25,000.

[11:35] I would rather sacrifice buying those two pins and just buy one back to the future for $20,000.

[11:42] And I'm just curious to see if they do it.

[11:44] But look, it's going to be a great year for Dutch.

[11:47] And I think they also have another surprise game coming out up their sleeve that nobody knows about.

[11:52] And we'll see what happens there.

[11:55] But a lot of exciting stuff coming from the Netherlands.

[11:58] All right, let's go on to Haggis Pinball.

[12:00] What kind of 2024 do we think Haggis is going to have?

[12:03] Well, look, they've got Centaur as their next game.

[12:05] I think they finished all the Fathom mermaid edition games.

[12:09] It doesn't seem like people are still waiting for those, which is good news.

[12:12] Damien and Marty, congratulations.

[12:15] You got it done.

[12:16] But here's my thing.

[12:18] Now that we know more Bali Williams games that are much more desirable than games like Centaur,

[12:24] I think Haggis Pinball's approach and the kinds of games they're remaking.

[12:29] I'm just not sure there's that demand for it.

[12:33] And I know they're making things more colorful and more sexy.

[12:36] But I think 2024 is going to be a rough year for Haggis.

[12:40] I just don't see them selling all of these Centaur editions.

[12:44] And I think they need to sell every single one because the slow manufacturing burn this company's been going on.

[12:51] I find it hard to believe they're making much money.

[12:54] And if I were them, I think they need to shake it up a little bit.

[12:57] I would love to see Marty Robbins is like War of the World's original designed game

[13:02] that he's probably been working on for three years now.

[13:05] Maybe four years now.

[13:07] And so that's where I think Haggis is.

[13:09] I think when we think about all the companies that are exciting us in the world of pinball,

[13:14] I just don't see Haggis as one of those companies right now.

[13:17] And I think they have to figure out a new strategy.

[13:20] And just looking at what's coming out next year,

[13:23] it's going to be really hard to get people to preorder this game with a nonrefundable deposit,

[13:29] especially after we've witnessed that Fathom mermaid editions didn't even go up in value.

[13:34] Remember the crazy time when people wanted 30,000 for one?

[13:37] Now you can go get one without any drama, without any weight for less than they sold for new.

[13:43] And I think the same thing is going to happen to Centaur.

[13:45] And I think this company just doesn't have any mojo right now.

[13:49] All right, speaking of a company with no mojo at 2024, home pin pinball, right?

[13:53] Spinal tap.

[13:54] Where is this game?

[13:56] I think it's shipping.

[13:57] I don't think anyone bought it.

[13:58] I don't think any are going to be unboxed.

[14:01] And I can go through this company real quickly in 2024.

[14:04] I don't think there's any real excitement for home pin.

[14:07] I don't think there ever has been.

[14:08] I don't think there ever will be.

[14:10] I don't quite get what they're doing, but they're still doing it.

[14:13] I don't get who's buying these games.

[14:15] I don't get where the money's coming from.

[14:17] I talk to people every day and nobody has said they ordered this game.

[14:21] And so I think we might see a few pinball companies close their doors in 2024

[14:27] because there's so much competition.

[14:29] And I would have to say that home pin is on that short list of companies

[14:33] that I don't think are going to make it through the end of next year.

[14:37] All right, speaking of a company that will definitely make it through the end of next year,

[14:41] that will make it forever because they don't need to borrow money from a bank.

[14:45] They don't have any investors.

[14:46] They have endless resources.

[14:48] And when you talk to Jack about his company, he almost brags about that.

[14:52] But I always think it's a little bit of a weakness

[14:54] because I feel like there's no pressure over at Jersey Jack to get it right.

[14:59] So what kind of 2024 is Jersey Jack pinball going to have?

[15:02] Well, we know the beginning of their 2024 is going to be a bad one.

[15:06] Elton John is not selling.

[15:08] I mean, distros have them sitting in a box.

[15:11] Nobody wants to take the risk and buy an Elton for 12.

[15:15] You know why?

[15:15] Because in just a couple months, it'll be nine.

[15:18] And so you're going to lose $3,000 on a game the moment you unbox it.

[15:22] It's another game that's just the wrong theme for this much money.

[15:26] And they really should have got the CEs out the door first.

[15:29] I don't think they sold even close to a thousand CEs of Elton.

[15:33] And we definitely know the Elis are not selling even though the art package

[15:37] is better on the Platinum Edition than it is on the Collectors Edition.

[15:40] And so this game is somewhat of a dead on arrival release,

[15:44] which means if you're Jersey Jack and you're looking at 2024,

[15:49] sales of Elton John are going to dry up by like February, March.

[15:53] And then you got the whole year to go.

[15:55] We're all waiting on Mark Sidon's game, which everyone thinks is going to be

[15:59] Harry Potter or the Matrix.

[16:01] And so here is the thing about Jersey Jack's 2024 from a financial standpoint,

[16:05] it doesn't matter.

[16:06] They have so much money.

[16:08] Nothing really matters when it comes to money.

[16:10] What I think Jersey Jack pinball needs to do and I think they need to get into

[16:14] a conference room because to me 2024 is a defining moment for JJP.

[16:19] For me, it's all about one thing with this company.

[16:22] It's their legacy.

[16:24] And I think this is either going to be a year in which JJP reestablishes its

[16:29] legacy within the pinball space or like American pinball and other companies

[16:34] out there, it's going to start to slide a little bit into a relevance because

[16:38] they're going to start to look like a company that just doesn't listen to the

[16:42] feedback is not making games for what the pinball community wants.

[16:46] They're making games for themselves.

[16:48] And I think if they continue to go down this road and make these really

[16:52] expensive games that don't check all of the boxes, I think Jersey Jack

[16:56] pinball is going to be an easy pass for a lot of people when it comes to a new

[17:01] and box game.

[17:02] And then everyone's just going to wait for your games to be on sale.

[17:05] But when you think about this company and you think about the magic they put

[17:09] into their games and the innovations they put into their games or used to not

[17:14] recently, but used to, they need to get back to the kind of excitement people

[17:19] had when guns and roses came out.

[17:21] And so I think it's going to be that kind of year for Jersey Jack because I

[17:24] think Mr.

[17:25] Saden's game, if it comes out and it's not a theme that people want, if it

[17:30] doesn't have all the assets, if it doesn't have mechanical wow stuff in it,

[17:35] people are not going to buy these games and they've turned their back on Jersey

[17:39] Jack now for three titles in a row.

[17:41] And I don't know how Jersey Jack's going to get their fan based back and they

[17:45] need to.

[17:46] And again, it's a legacy year for this company.

[17:48] They've got the money.

[17:49] They've got the talent.

[17:51] They need to now put it all together.

[17:53] They've had too much time in this industry to not know what putting it

[17:56] all together looks like.

[17:58] You know, I don't want to see video assets without synced up voices.

[18:02] If that's the case, then move on to a license in which you can get everything.

[18:05] Fill that beautiful screen in the right way.

[18:08] Like look at guns and roses.

[18:10] That's how you do it.

[18:11] You know, let the assets come at us.

[18:13] Don't overcomplicate it.

[18:14] When I look at games like Toy Story, I'm like, what's going on on this screen?

[18:19] And I don't think people should need a Bible to figure out what's going on with

[18:22] your code and for the love of the pinball gods, will you please finish the code on

[18:27] every one of your games?

[18:29] Like this is now getting ridiculous.

[18:31] So again, a legacy year for Jersey Jack.

[18:34] Are they going to turn the corner and start to build this brand the right way

[18:38] in 2024?

[18:39] If I were to make a prediction, I just got to say this.

[18:42] I don't think they're going to do it.

[18:43] I don't think they're going to do it.

[18:44] They just seem to be a company that doesn't listen to the feedback and doesn't make

[18:50] any changes.

[18:51] And if you keep having the same people make the same decisions every single year,

[18:55] how are things going to get better?

[18:57] All right, let's go to multi-morphic.

[18:59] What kind of year is multi-morphic going to have?

[19:01] Well, look, you know, I mean, this is another one of those small companies, right?

[19:04] There's like boutique companies and then there's like ultra boutique companies

[19:08] like multi-morphic.

[19:09] I think we're going to get another license game from Jerry.

[19:13] I'm curious to see what the license game is.

[19:15] You know, final resistance is getting really good reviews, but it's not enough, right?

[19:20] We all know this.

[19:21] It's not enough to invest in this platform.

[19:23] And I have friends you bought in on this platform and when they try to get out of

[19:28] it and move on to something else, they're in for like $20,000 and you're not finding

[19:33] anyone who's going to want to buy all of these modular games.

[19:36] Like it's just not working.

[19:38] And so you look, my prediction for multi-morphic in 2024.

[19:42] Is there once again going to go down this road in which I think they create some of

[19:46] the most interesting mechanics in Pimbal.

[19:48] I think their themes though are really hard to compete against the bigger themes

[19:52] from the bigger companies.

[19:54] And again, I just think at this price point, it's really hard to get people to go in

[19:59] on a multi-morphic.

[20:01] But I also think, you know, Jerry's got his operation in a way now where I don't

[20:05] think they're really losing money.

[20:07] So I think they're going to keep chugging along forever.

[20:10] I really do.

[20:10] I think multi-morphic will be around as long as Pimbal is around.

[20:15] And it'll always be this thing.

[20:17] That's the discussion in the Stelenberg family over Thanksgiving.

[20:20] Why can't we just make a normal machine, Jerry?

[20:23] Why can't we all just be multi-millionaires?

[20:25] He's like, no, you don't understand.

[20:27] This is what people want.

[20:28] Actually, this is what they don't know.

[20:30] They want that.

[20:31] I need to convince them that they want.

[20:33] So that's multi-morphic.

[20:34] Let's go on to Pimbal Adventures.

[20:37] I'm going to skip over Pimbal Adventures and Elements.

[20:39] Is that their game?

[20:40] I mean, look, nobody's buying these games.

[20:43] These companies are making games in which if they sold 50, I'd be surprised.

[20:47] And that's just the truth.

[20:49] I mean, look, don't get into making Pimbal machines.

[20:51] If you can at least make a game that's as good as a Stern Pro, don't bother making Pimbal

[20:56] machines.

[20:57] And there's no room to have financial success.

[21:00] If your company is going to build itself on original IP games, you're not going to do

[21:05] it.

[21:05] It's never going to work.

[21:06] You're not J-pop.

[21:07] You don't have the ability to make a game look amazing even though there's nothing

[21:10] in it like Magic Girl.

[21:12] All right, let's go on.

[21:13] Number 10, Pimbal Brothers.

[21:15] The Pimbal Bros are going to have, I think, a really interesting 2024.

[21:19] I mean, they're coming out with a music pin.

[21:21] I hear their music pin is Scorpions.

[21:23] You know, Wind of Chains guys over there in Germany rock me like a hurricane.

[21:27] But we also now know that the Pimbal Brothers, along with Padredy Gaming and the European

[21:32] Gaming Corporation, wherever Pimbal Corporation are going to start remaking

[21:36] Bali Williams games.

[21:38] And so I think it's going to be a huge 2024 for these guys.

[21:41] I think now that they've figured out manufacturing and distribution and shipping,

[21:46] they can now start to manufacture games that people really, really want.

[21:51] It was a really great move that they got the Ripley edition out the door and for

[21:55] the best price in all of Pimbal.

[21:57] I think these guys have a bright future and are going to have an interesting 2024.

[22:02] My one question mark with this company remains, are they going to turn into a company

[22:06] that just remakes stuff because I don't think that's the future.

[22:10] And then you think it's like, well, who's designing for them?

[22:12] Who's their coding staff?

[22:14] Who are their artists?

[22:15] And that's the thing that's still a question mark for me with the Pimbal Brothers,

[22:18] because most of their company was left over from Andrew Highway.

[22:23] The games were left over from Andrew Highway.

[22:25] And I'm just not sure if this company from the ground up by themselves, not a remake,

[22:31] but a ground up production by the Pimbal Brothers.

[22:34] Can they make a world class Pimbal machine?

[22:37] We haven't seen it yet.

[22:38] So that's my big question mark with this company.

[22:41] But that being said, I think they're going to borrow some equity from what people

[22:45] already love and they're going to make a couple remakes that people love from the

[22:49] Valley Williams error.

[22:50] And then they're going to have an all new original European rock and roll music

[22:54] pin.

[22:54] So look, I think it's going to be a good year for them.

[22:57] It's going to be challenging though, you know, to put two to three games out

[23:00] into the Pimbal landscape and find commercial success with every single one.

[23:05] All right.

[23:05] What else we got after Pimbal Brothers?

[23:07] We've got the juggernaut.

[23:09] What kind of year is it going to be for Stern Pimbal?

[23:12] Well, look, we all know the year is going to start out phenomenally well for

[23:16] Stern.

[23:17] They're going to get Jaws Pimbal out the door.

[23:20] It's going to sell like hotcakes.

[23:22] It's going to justify the high prices.

[23:24] The L.

[23:24] Le's are going to sell out in one day.

[23:27] And I think this game is going to be insane.

[23:29] I think we've been waiting for Keith L.

[23:31] And for a reason, I think there's going to be some awesome mechanisms in the

[23:36] game.

[23:37] And I think the theme is going to work.

[23:38] I think the coding team over there is going to figure out how to make this

[23:42] franchise work, even if you don't have Brody assets.

[23:45] They did it with Jurassic Park.

[23:47] I mean, we all thought Jurassic Park wasn't going to work and they made it work.

[23:51] So I think Stern's going to start the year with the game.

[23:54] That's so damn popular.

[23:56] They're not even going to need another hit throughout 2024.

[24:00] See, this is the thing about Keith Elwin.

[24:02] He's so damn good that one Elwin game is equivalent to like one Taylor Swift

[24:09] album.

[24:10] If you nail it, you can go on tour for the whole year and make money all year

[24:16] round.

[24:16] And that's what a Keith Elwin game is and Stern knows this.

[24:20] And so no matter what happens after this game, Stern's going to have a great

[24:25] 2024.

[24:26] Now, my prediction is the games that follow Jaws and Keith Elwin are going to

[24:31] have a harder time getting our money.

[24:33] But that's why I think Stern's going to go back to the well.

[24:37] They're going to make another Metallica knowing how great that game is.

[24:41] We know this is now Stern's approach.

[24:43] They are now going to start throwing at us.

[24:46] Not just new stuff, but old stuff, new and box again.

[24:50] And as much as we complain about it, it's not going to stop people because

[24:54] there's too much new money coming into the hobby who don't care.

[24:57] All the new money does not care that your Metallica LEs are about to plummet

[25:02] in value because there's going to be a new one.

[25:04] They're all going to run in line up and get the new one.

[25:07] And if Stern taught us anything in 2023, they don't care about the collectors.

[25:12] They don't care about the integrity around the LEs and making things limited

[25:16] and making sure their collectors who supported them all these years

[25:19] maintain their value.

[25:20] They don't care.

[25:21] You know, so I think it's going to be like one of these years for Stern.

[25:24] And I'm also hearing there's going to be two Keith Elwin games that come out in 2024.

[25:29] I'm hearing that like John Wick might be his.

[25:31] So we might get a Keith Elwin Jaws, a Keith Elwin John Wick, a Jack Danger

[25:37] second title coming out.

[25:38] Maybe it's Pokemon, maybe it's He-Man.

[25:40] Jack Danger's first game, just one game of the year.

[25:43] And so just right there alone, a new Jack Danger game and a new Keith Elwin

[25:48] game or two.

[25:49] And then we've got a new game from John Borg and possibly John Borg's

[25:53] Metallica coming back.

[25:54] Now, all of a sudden, doesn't it start to look like Stern's going to have

[25:58] an incredible 2024 and they're going to take so much money out of the

[26:01] pinball marketplace by doing what they do and nobody does it better than Stern.

[26:06] So yeah, I'm here to tell you right now.

[26:08] I think Stern's year is going to be killer.

[26:10] And I think the year is going to be defined by Keith Elwin Jaws at the

[26:14] beginning of the year and Dutch pinballs back to the future at the end

[26:18] of the year.

[26:18] Those two games are really where I would save my money.

[26:22] And if anything else comes out that could surprise us, so be it.

[26:25] And then we've got Spooky Pinball and Turner Pinball rounding out our

[26:29] companies.

[26:30] Now, what kind of year is Spooky going to have?

[26:32] They're going to have a fine year.

[26:33] Like Spooky Pinball knows what they're doing.

[26:35] They already released both of their titles that they will be making in

[26:39] 2024.

[26:40] The excitement around them is pretty good.

[26:42] It's pretty good.

[26:43] It's not like instant sellout kind of themes, but they've got Texas

[26:47] Chainsaw Massacre.

[26:48] They've got Looney Tunes.

[26:50] And heck, if you want to buy one of these games, it's not going to be too

[26:53] hard to get one.

[26:54] The price is not terrible and there's only going to be 888 of each game.

[27:00] So you're going to have something that's somewhat limited.

[27:02] I don't think either of these themes really speaks to me.

[27:06] So I'm not going in on them, but I understand why people like both themes

[27:10] and they look like they're the best shooting Spooky games to date.

[27:13] The games are already on the line.

[27:15] They give you the topper for free.

[27:17] There's just a lot to like about what Spooky's doing.

[27:20] There's a lot to like about the team over there.

[27:23] And I think they're going to have a fine 2024.

[27:25] I really do.

[27:26] Every year we're like, well, Spooky needs to do this, this or this, or

[27:30] they're not going to be successful.

[27:32] And then they just keep doing what they do.

[27:34] They get a little bit better with each game and they keep succeeding at

[27:38] that and they are the playbook on how you go from a tiny boutique to a

[27:42] nice medium sized pinball company.

[27:44] I mean, they're going to sell more games than Elton John.

[27:47] I mean, that is just embarrassing for Jersey Jack.

[27:50] You know, especially if you put the two games next to each other,

[27:53] but that's the difference.

[27:54] Like you just got to figure out what people want.

[27:57] And you also have to have some good will.

[27:59] Like it goes a long way.

[28:00] You can never underestimate the importance of customer service and

[28:05] being connected to your community.

[28:06] I mean, everybody at Jersey Jack Pinball needs to go read the book

[28:09] Unreasonable Hospitality.

[28:11] They need to understand that the hospitality around a brand and

[28:15] how you treat the people around your brand is just as important as

[28:20] the products themselves.

[28:22] And you could put all the RGB LED lights you want into a game,

[28:26] but if you don't engage your community the right way and you're

[28:29] banning people on Facebook who are asking, where's the code?

[28:33] That's not how you do it.

[28:35] People bought your products Jersey Jack and they're just asking

[28:38] questions and you're banning them.

[28:40] That's not the way to go.

[28:42] So it's going to be a good year for spooky.

[28:44] I will they sell all 888 in one year.

[28:46] I don't think so.

[28:48] I think they have enough orders to keep them busy all throughout

[28:51] 2024.

[28:52] All right, Turner pinball.

[28:53] Am I even going to like deal with Turner pinball?

[28:55] This Ninja Eclipse game.

[28:57] I'm not going to waste my time.

[28:58] Nobody's buying this game.

[29:00] These guys don't know what they're doing.

[29:02] They bought the Raza game and all the rights to Raza.

[29:05] If this company were smart, just make like 200 Raza's and sell them for

[29:09] like 20 grand.

[29:11] You'll find 20 collector suckers to do it, but nobody's going to buy Ninja

[29:16] Eclipse.

[29:16] You know, and this is one of those companies where I have no idea where

[29:19] the money's coming from.

[29:21] Are these Nepo babies?

[29:22] Did you inherit some money?

[29:23] I have no idea, but nobody's going to buy Ninja Eclipse.

[29:27] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canada Club.

[29:30] It's always fun looking towards the future to see what's going to

[29:32] happen in the pinball world.

[29:34] I can't wait.

[29:35] You know, we're about to get jaws.

[29:36] The shows are going to get really fun because a lot of new games are going

[29:39] to come out.

[29:39] There's that period between January and Texas pinball festival where,

[29:44] you know, it's like, all right, like a lot of new stuff starts to

[29:46] happen in pinball.

[29:48] Everybody be good.

[29:49] I'll be back before the New Year's to wish everybody a happy New Year's.

[29:52] But until then, until then, let's go drink some more espresso,

[29:56] martinis,

[29:57] canada out.
