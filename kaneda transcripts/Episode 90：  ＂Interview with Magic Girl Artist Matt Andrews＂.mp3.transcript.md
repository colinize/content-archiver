[00:00] Well, you don't know what we can find

[00:04] Why don't you come with me little girl

[00:06] On a magic comrade

[00:08] I've been planning to do this interview

[00:17] with someone connected to Magic Girl for weeks now

[00:21] and I think it's just Sarah and Dipett is timing that

[00:24] I got to do this interview the day after physically getting

[00:29] my Magic Girl machine before I air this interview

[00:33] I want to just clarify some stuff about the machine

[00:36] so I realize that there are two different modes

[00:39] in Magic Girl then there's the novice arcade

[00:42] modes that are available to play and the arcade mode has more

[00:46] programming and coding so I'm happy to report

[00:49] that the game isn't a box of lights with absolutely no code

[00:54] I also want to report that wizard mode is not available

[00:58] I also want to report that somewhere after choosing arcade game and playing

[01:02] a few games my machine is no longer on free play

[01:06] and now it's asking for quarters and there's nothing in the menu system

[01:10] to set it back to free play so I was joking on a video I uploaded that

[01:16] maybe John's trying to recoup some money by making the games

[01:20] for for for coin up only so what is it like

[01:26] owning the game 48 hours later I'll say this

[01:29] for as much as I think the game has some mechanical issues

[01:32] the game's fun the game is fun because the light system the sound

[01:37] the artwork it all works together to make shooting Magic Girl a pretty fun

[01:42] experience it is by no means a complete game though

[01:46] by no means at all and I uploaded a bunch of videos to youtube if you

[01:49] search for canada pinball on youtube you'll see my channel and you'll see a

[01:54] whole bunch of videos of gameplay of walk through the playfield

[01:59] and stuff like that so I think you'll enjoy those as well you get to see a

[02:02] little bit of canada on the other side of the medium which is video and not

[02:06] just audio but this interview is really special because this interview

[02:10] is with the man responsible for half of the epic artwork that you see on

[02:15] on Magic Girl and his name is Matt Andrews and for those of you who don't

[02:20] know this name remember it because Matt Andrews is the individual

[02:25] the cabinet artwork for Magic Girl he did the cabinet artwork

[02:30] for razza he did the cabinet and playfield artwork for Houdini that American

[02:35] pinball showed a few months ago extremely extremely talented individual

[02:41] who needs to have more of a steady gig in the pinball world and

[02:45] when you when I'm looking at the Magic Girl cabinet right now and it is just

[02:48] phenomenal phenomenal I think this guy's artwork

[02:53] is perfectly suited for pinball and I hope he can find some pinball

[02:58] manufacturer out there that will let his talents come to the marketplace

[03:03] but without further ado I want to air an interview I did with Matt

[03:07] tonight I think it's great to introduce him to the pinball community this

[03:11] way since he did work on Magic Girl we're going to

[03:14] obviously talk about that experience and I know he's going to sign up for

[03:18] pinside tomorrow and be on there and be a member of that community so I'm happy

[03:22] to give pinside not just videos of Magic Girl

[03:25] but also the individual who's responsible for some of the great artwork on

[03:30] Magic Girl so without any more delay I give you Matt Andrews

[03:36] all right ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome to canada's pinball podcast a

[03:40] very special guest when when when pinball fans out there think about artwork

[03:45] and they think about the the J-pop artwork that

[03:49] the world knows they think of zombie Yeti but there is another man that has

[03:54] contributed greatly to the beautiful artwork that we see on Magic Girl

[04:00] Raza even on Houdini and that man is Matt Andrews Matt I want to welcome you

[04:06] to canada's pinball podcast thanks I'd like to be here

[04:12] and Matt you must know that this is a big week because

[04:16] Magic Girls I know a project that you've worked on for many years

[04:19] are finally shipping to customers what what are your thoughts on

[04:23] on seeing a project that you worked on for so many years or so long ago finally

[04:28] make its way out there well it's pretty crazy because I started working on it

[04:34] I guess probably a year after it was even first conceived that was back in

[04:39] 2012 and you know I would just John just had me do a little bit of artwork

[04:45] for it and got me started and I started doing some paintings and that led to

[04:52] some of the character that you see on the the final cabinet but that was

[04:57] you know that started back in 2012 and then later on he had me do some

[05:01] backgrounds like some environments which I assume would come up on the

[05:07] screen and all that right so like walk me so let's start from the very

[05:13] beginning so how did John like how did he find you did he did he let you know

[05:17] how he contact like he contacts you and was there any like what was the

[05:21] introduction like it was really random I had just graduated from college I went

[05:29] to Winthrop University in Rock Hill which is where I currently live still got my

[05:35] bachelor's of fine arts and shortly after that I posted on a forum called

[05:41] concept art.org and that site's not nearly as popular as it once was but

[05:47] and it's heyday it used to be kind of where you know budding artists would

[05:52] get their start they would kind of they would either do like sketchbook

[05:56] challenges or something on there and then people would notice them and so I just

[06:00] posted a you know work inquiry like I'm available for hire and you know I just

[06:06] got out of college so I'm pretty cheap and I guess I caught the attention of

[06:12] John and he he emailed me and asked me to get started on it just I had zero

[06:20] zero experience with pinball I actually wanted to do video game art but what he

[06:25] was asking for was very fancy themed right and it was like right up my alley so

[06:30] I went went right to work on it so he comes to you and he says I'm working on this

[06:35] game and did he did he have the title was magic girl what he sold you as the

[06:40] project to start with yeah yeah it was all magic girl and he um he already had

[06:47] some work by zombie Eddie as like sketches and um I guess what finally became the

[06:54] backglasses is what you see the the magic girl image um he's he sent me that

[07:00] to kind of get started with as far as how it all looked and um okay yeah did you know when

[07:08] when he when you started working with him so he told you you're going to do the cabinets

[07:13] you're going to do the end like the what's on the screen how did he sort of communicate what

[07:17] exactly he was looking for from you uh I I kind of had a feeling it was for the cabinets or for the

[07:27] the digital side of things like the um you know the the digital display that you have

[07:34] down in the play field um because my style is very painfully and that doesn't necessarily lend

[07:42] itself to you know the printing on a uh play field right per se so I had a feeling that it was like

[07:51] more of um you know a digital uh either printed or um a digital display kind of look okay

[08:00] so and and so you connect with him it is on the Eddie sort of starting the artistic

[08:06] aesthetic of this thing um what what what was the process like how often were there check-ins with

[08:13] John how often were you sharing stuff how was he how did he give feedback to you on on what you

[08:18] submitted was just walk us through what that was like okay so um he's not much of a micro manager

[08:27] he sent me a design brief and a bunch of reference images many of which were drawings by um

[08:35] Jeremy or zombie Eddie and um he just kind of let me interpret it however I want to

[08:43] uh so it started out with just with character art and so I would do like four thumbnails um

[08:51] thumbnails being small drawings uh just like little sketches um and then he would kind of check

[08:58] off on those or add things to um like kind of scribble on there and say you know what else he wanted

[09:04] and then I would take that and kind of refine it a little bit and that's kind of how the process

[09:08] worked until the very end okay so and and so was was the majority of the work like let's talk

[09:16] about the cabinets and then did you did he ever tell you like this is for the cabinet so if

[09:23] I'm assuming like once you know the physical space of a cabinet um does that change your

[09:28] design or like when we look at the final magic girl cabinet now it was at a larger image with a

[09:33] line so or did you design that to fit that space specifically so among the three different projects

[09:41] that I worked with before American pinball they were magic girl retro atomic and the kiss prototype

[09:48] okay they all kind of went a little bit different I guess um magic girl and raza were pretty similar

[09:54] in that all I did was kind of do these character paintings and then because they're layered Photoshop

[10:02] files he would kind of take different elements out and then he kind of collage them on to the cabinet

[10:09] so what you see in the final um you know the machine that you just received that I didn't compose

[10:16] that image I just did all the different parts in it got it so you've got you you've drawn the lion

[10:23] you've then drawn the the magic wand with believe you've drawn these elements and right

[10:28] johns are ranging them yes okay that's really interesting um I don't think anyone you know

[10:36] what's interesting to is because john I'm trying to find the right words but I know he sort of

[10:43] stands in front of really creative artists and sort of move stuff around and and there's like this

[10:49] interesting point where he begins to take a little bit of credit for the final thing but we now

[10:55] know that met you and and and Jeremy Packer you guys basically did all of the artwork for this

[11:03] stuff right john didn't draw anything that appeared on any of these games right I mean it depends

[11:08] on what you um define as art so a graphic designer will say that uh they're an artist who arranges

[11:15] things right and that's kind of what john does um whereas we're kind of the guys behind the scenes

[11:21] um I guess it's kind of like the difference between a director and like a stage designer or

[11:27] something you know there's someone who's creating all the assets and then he's kind of

[11:33] using his vision to arrange everything right now I think it's a fair point too because I think

[11:38] john oftentimes does get criticized for uh taking credit but that what what the way you just explain

[11:45] it does make a lot of sense that the final things you're seeing it's john taking all these different

[11:51] assets and putting them the way he envisions it and that's what ends up becoming the final final

[11:57] final cabinet how long how long did it take like what you started working with him in 2012

[12:02] around roughly how how long did you work with john on on these projects oh jeez well um

[12:11] let's see if I try to break it down each character probably took like a week of like business time

[12:22] to to do like a character illustration with a background so if you say there are there's magic

[12:29] girl there's a magician there's a genie there's you know probably eight different characters you

[12:35] know that's that's two months right there um so I mean I don't know it's the way the way it worked

[12:43] was just kind of I would do some and then he'd pay me for it and then maybe two weeks for three

[12:51] weeks would pass and they need to have some more stuff so I mean in terms of total time it wasn't

[12:59] too terribly much but just in terms of like the entire span of the project it was quite a long time

[13:05] okay and you you said you said some magical words there that that he would he paid you after

[13:12] submitting stuff so I have to ask because I know there's a lot of public knowledge of different

[13:20] vendors and I know john worked with a lot of people right some some got paid some didn't some

[13:25] are still upset how how did you guys arrange the way your services would be compensated you don't

[13:32] have to tell we don't we're not going to talk numbers but was it he'd give you an assignment and

[13:36] pay you when it was complete was it some payment up front to get started what what was it like

[13:43] well like I said I kind of posted my rate on that forum the concept art.org forum and so that

[13:50] gave me a kind of an idea of what to charge him okay and then but you know he never really questions

[13:57] or he never really had a problem with that so I would just kind of I started off sending him

[14:02] invoices after I finished what I was doing and that's typically how I'll work with a client like I'll do

[14:08] a drawing and then refine it and you know take it all the way to the end but I won't send

[14:14] the usable like high res file until I get like payment for it so that they can't really use it

[14:21] you know what I'm saying like it's like kind of like a collateral thing it you're sort of

[14:25] locking it in a way to protect your interest and your IP before so they can see exactly what

[14:31] they're getting but they can't really use it because it's so low resolution yeah no makes total

[14:36] sense and when you when you sign on a deal with when you're making artwork for for a game like this

[14:43] what what's your ability to does does John then own it once he's paid the invoice or are you

[14:49] able to also sell some of these prints and let fans of the game sort of in on collecting your

[14:58] your contributions to magic girl well I don't know the exact legal abilities on my behalf as far

[15:06] as owning the artwork but I just typically will do the art give it to the client and then just say

[15:13] okay that belongs to them they can do whatever they want with it and then I kind of move on I don't

[15:18] try to go and and make money again on what I do for clients sure um yeah so I mean I could

[15:25] probably ask him and say could I sell some prints of this and he he'd probably be cool with it

[15:29] right but I just haven't I haven't gone I'll tell you this Matt it might not be a bad request because

[15:37] I don't know how close you follow the pinball hobby but the fans love collecting the artwork

[15:44] and buying artwork and t-shirts and and mainly because you know and we haven't said this yet but

[15:50] your artwork is phenomenal and I think I've said this to you on the phone as we've we've when we

[15:54] talked a few times but pinball really went through a period where just the artwork became terrible

[16:02] like it was just when pinball was about to die in the late 90s early 2000s the art really just

[16:09] became Photoshop drag and drop kind of stuff like it used to be hand drawn artwork it used to be

[16:17] very intricate stuff very colorful stuff and you know I think if people are giving John credit it's

[16:24] for sort of discovering or bringing back to pinball a lot of the hand drawn artwork that pinball

[16:31] was known for and so the fan base out there loves to collect the stuff and I think you could find

[16:37] yourself with an interesting revenue stream you might not have thought of with some of this stuff

[16:43] so there's something to keep on keep in mind as as we go forward so is there is there a lot of

[16:49] artwork Matt that didn't get used I know Raza hasn't it may never come out right and you worked

[16:55] on games that may never see the light of day is there any I and there was some prototype magic

[17:00] girl cabinets it in terms of the final game how much extra assets do you think you created that

[17:08] aren't currently in the final version of magic girl um well I could probably name five characters

[17:18] that aren't on the the cabinet but I think they show up somewhere within the interactive displays

[17:27] so I'm not really I'm not sure how much is was unused I think I think most of it was so okay yeah I

[17:35] know there's like there's a there's sort of like a rabbit figure there's a guy that looks like a

[17:40] rock figure right yeah the wizard there's the magic girl I'm just trying to remember what I saw

[17:46] the night when I went through the game uh so did did you collaborate at all another interesting thing

[17:53] is you got Jeremy Packers on Biede in one corner doing some work and you're doing work how much

[17:59] did you guys ever collaborate or talk amongst each other or was it more john facilitating

[18:05] the whole project and and you guys were sort of siloed working on things yeah so that was

[18:11] interesting because um john had never mentioned that there was another artist uh when he was asking

[18:19] me to do work I figured uh either he had done the sketches himself or he just had like I don't know I

[18:26] guess he contracted some other guy but I never knew his name you know I they just kind of showed up

[18:33] and I knew there was more art to the game but you know the art that I hadn't done um but I didn't even

[18:40] know who Jeremy was until probably last year wow yeah so john's giving you stuff and he's just

[18:50] see this is where I think he gets that reputation where he's standing in front of the the artist

[18:55] a little bit right and sort of presenting it as his sort of creation I do think that is interesting

[19:01] because the and the art stuff you guys have different art styles and you guys are both phenomenal

[19:07] artists and in a way like I think it really works when you look at the the final package of

[19:15] of magic girl and raza so so imagine for the listeners out there you did the cabinets for raza you

[19:21] did it for uh magic girl and you you did it and I think this is the first time people are getting

[19:28] confirmation on this but you worked on the cabinet that was Houdini and Houdini Playfield artwork

[19:33] right that we saw with American pinball yeah those three in addition to kiss which you know and

[19:39] there's a whole controversy behind that right what's the so I think I might know the controversy but

[19:45] what is the controversy that john didn't have the license and brought the game out and was still

[19:50] unfinished on his other projects when he did it is that it might is there more controversy that we

[19:55] don't know there's that in addition to because he didn't really seal the deal with kiss uh he just

[20:02] kind of made it um they didn't I mean he you know we put all that work into it and then

[20:09] stern ended up actually getting the rights to kiss pinball so it was it was kind of like

[20:15] we did he put all this effort and money into it and then it kind of got swept right under him

[20:21] so he was so he was talking to the band when he made it he wasn't just doing it as like a pet project

[20:28] um he he said that he was having like talks with gene Simmons and I guess Paul Stanley but you

[20:37] know I never really heard anything more than just he's saying he was talking to them so I guess

[20:44] there was nothing official in terms of a business agreement there wow I guess we'll never know um

[20:52] but that's what that's what Gary Stern does I mean Gary Stern

[20:56] locks deals and he knows how to get the IP permission and you know I think he also did the same thing to

[21:04] um I can't verify this but uh there's an alien pinball game coming out that doesn't feature

[21:09] sagorny weaver and and the rumor is a Gary locked her down contractually to be in his ghost

[21:16] buster's game so she's not so it's it's a it's a it's a cutthroat business at times when it comes

[21:22] to securing these licenses and I know when so when John did that so you you came onto the project then

[21:28] when you John's fame is for uh for for many things and one of them is working on too many projects

[21:36] at the same time now Matt when as as you're working on these pinball projects did you have any clue

[21:42] like how long it should take to finish pinball machine and where there are times when red flags

[21:47] start to appear where you're just like I don't know if these guys ever gonna finish like why we

[21:50] already on project two and three when one's not even done or did you did you did you just think

[21:55] that's how it it is in pinball well like I said I zero experience in pinball when he like picked me

[22:03] up um so I I didn't really know anything about the business and I didn't really question it to

[22:09] be honest with you it it would I mean when I first started it was just a client it was just I was

[22:15] doing the work for hire and I you know I expected to get paid for my time and I did um and I didn't

[22:21] really you know I wasn't really a huge fan of pinball so I didn't follow the industry or or

[22:27] really know that you know there were big players like Stern or Jersey Jack at all like I was just

[22:32] kind of doing the pinball work and hoping that one day I'd see it in the machine but at the end

[22:37] the day it was just kind of a job and I was doing it and I was I was very much enjoying it but again

[22:43] I wasn't I wasn't expecting like oh I can't wait to play this or I can't wait to see this in

[22:49] in our kids somewhere right so and that that's that's totally fine I wasn't even in the pinball until

[22:57] a few years ago I grew up playing our kid games and and I worked in the video game industry for

[23:01] many years doing marketing and I just was always a I was always a gamer but never like a pinball

[23:06] fanatic and it was only recently that uh I started to get addicted to pinball which which kind of

[23:12] sucks because pinball machines are so expensive it's much easier to buy a sixty dollar Xbox game and

[23:16] have fun um all right so that's that's fair I mean I think it's it's it if you're working on an

[23:22] our project and you don't know anything about pinball development times there's no there's no reason

[23:26] to believe things are in trouble but there must have come a point where john either stopped asking for

[23:33] stuff or bills stopped getting paid when did you realize crap like you know john's in trouble like

[23:41] did he ever come forward and say like it's think you know we we've all heard the famous making pinball

[23:46] is hard line that he uses but did you ever get a sense like this this this this business is just

[23:53] might not succeed the way john's managing it yeah it was um it was probably in 2014 when that when

[24:01] that finally occurred to me because from 2012 to 20 early 2014 he was very consistent in terms of

[24:09] coming back and asking for like a new project or whatever because as we know um there was magic

[24:16] girl and then there was bin hex right on the adventure land and then that went on for a while and

[24:21] then it switched to retro atomic and then so there were like new assets to be made for that so it

[24:28] was like revising the old stuff a little bit and then there was uh all of a sudden there was kiss

[24:34] and there was even a time when i was drawing some prototypes for i guess it was to pitch the um

[24:41] potential reality show or whatever he was trying to do um but there was always kind of something

[24:47] there right uh to work on uh and then in 2014 it was like uh i probably can't say what he was

[24:55] working on but there was another project that i never saw like anything else from and then he

[25:01] kind of stopped yeah he kind of stopped um contacting me for it was a year and a half or so

[25:10] so in 2014 when he's about to go belly up on and that that's when i started to talk to john it was

[25:18] around november of 2014 it was right when i think people's patience starts to sort of wear thin

[25:26] and and he was promising magic girl would be out in December and then retro atomic zombie adventure

[25:32] land would be a few months later to think that he started another project during that time period i

[25:39] think it just says it all like he he's got so many ideas but executing and finishing them is just

[25:46] almost impossible for him and i think he just it's almost like an escape mechanism he has just

[25:52] move on to the next thing let's talk about the benheck uh and then into raza that it turned into so

[26:00] for those for those of you out there and i think just gives a good indication of how good mat is as

[26:05] an artist mat your website is what so people can go check it out when they're listening to this uh it

[26:11] is m a n d r a w s dot com it's a play on my first and last name m andru's except its mandraus

[26:23] mandraus dot com um yeah so if you go there you'll see like a bunch of tiles and then you can

[26:31] click on those tiles and see uh several different works under different categories now on this site

[26:37] ladies and gentlemen because everyone's familiar with benheck on on this show and and out in the

[26:43] pinball world mat has created something that makes benheck look like the the greatest superhero of all time

[26:51] i believe he's holding like the glue gun right and he's correct yeah and i don't and and this you know

[26:57] when i saw that i and i've been talking to a lot of people that that love pinball and i'm like look

[27:02] at this like imagine this artwork in a pinball machine on a cabinet and and it's just it's incredible

[27:09] and so ben ben gets taken off the project we know ben tried to work with john for for a few months

[27:15] and it didn't work out now when you started working on raza when john sort of re-themed it the

[27:21] the famous thing with raza is all the different ip infringement stuff that appeared on the game now

[27:28] did john ask you to draw like is it like the attack for mars martian or you know the i think

[27:35] geizillas on there i think there's like roby the robot like all these things that are ip protected

[27:41] that was john requesting that stuff or where did that all that come from yeah he actually uh

[27:46] referred to it by name like adorabi in there at it at a godzilla and i you know i

[27:53] i didn't know that they were so protected that he couldn't use them or anything i just kind of

[28:00] drew them in my own style and kind of made it work uh like the um i don't know if you have seen the

[28:07] uh i guess it's on the cabinet but it's kind of the giant godzilla in the theme park right yep um

[28:14] i interpreted that as a sculpture that was kind of dilapidated so instead of it being the actual

[28:21] godzilla it was like they had built a model godzilla and then because it was an abandoned park it

[28:29] kind of started falling apart and then you know because that's a little bit different that kind of

[28:35] made sense in my head right but he he never said put a put a living godzilla in there you know

[28:41] right he just kind of he said put a godzilla in there and then i again i interpreted it as

[28:47] okay this park maybe had a godzilla ride or something in it right well i mean i'm looking at it

[28:52] right now and it's it's the artwork spectacular i mean there was that famous scene where John

[28:57] walked into pimpal exbow in 2014 and pulled out the translate uh for for raza and they quickly put

[29:05] it away like as that that's just you know as if the internet and cell phone cameras don't exist and

[29:11] didn't capture the whole thing uh but i think john now knows that i think because he went back and

[29:17] made some changes i think he probably heard because he does have a lawyer if there's one person john

[29:22] speaks to on a daily basis it's probably his lawyer and so i think he heard that that stuff wasn't

[29:27] going to fly so this goes so did we're sort of just goes through this period and and we all know

[29:33] the story mat like between 2014 and 2015 stuff starts to get really bad and john's company starts to

[29:40] falter significantly and it really looks like these games are never coming out a company gets formed

[29:47] called penteja that tries to help john out were you aware did john were you still with john during

[29:53] that period where penteja tried to reboot things and get things on track um before american pinball

[30:00] contacted me uh it was you know the end of 2014 that was when you started talking to him was when

[30:07] john stopped talking to me so i had no idea that this penteja company was involved right like at all

[30:15] right well that okay so that makes sense and so then you hear from american pinball when when

[30:20] do you first get the call well i hear from john uh he is you know consulting with them and obviously

[30:29] he recommends me and so i start talking with the higher ups there at american pinball and it's a

[30:35] super small company it's basically one guy or at least when i was there it was just one guy the CEO

[30:42] and john and they were working on magic girl they had um a few other guys working in the shop

[30:48] just kind of assembling the machines but as far as like management it was it was him and john

[30:54] okay and this is when this is like roughly what month and year is this this is that's august

[31:00] 2016 is when i went up there okay august 2016 so that wasn't that long ago that and that's the first

[31:08] time they they reached out to you and so you go over there and and what's it like like what's the

[31:14] what do they ask you to do what what's the environment like what's the vibe you're picking up

[31:19] well i'd already started doing some work on hudini um and they wanted to have me up there to

[31:27] you know see the facilities which is the first time that i had any experience um actually being in

[31:35] the environment where the machines are being built so it was really cool um to be able to kind of

[31:40] work on art and then kind of prototype things or john would go prototype things and then i would do

[31:46] some more art and then you know like we're all working in the shop together so that was pretty neat

[31:52] uh because usually when i'm working it's just i'm alone in my studio i'm just looking up my computer

[31:57] screen i'm not seeing things printed out at full scale and like you know actually seeing my work

[32:03] on the machines so it's really cool to actually be there uh but it's like uh there was like a bunch

[32:09] of magic girl machines in the shop and then one hudini mock up machine right so when did you so

[32:17] when did you start working on hudini if you said before august you'd been working on it was at

[32:22] a project that john had just sort of had you sort of do some concepting around before he stopped

[32:28] talking to you or what talk about when hudini work actually began um i think it began in july

[32:37] so that was a really quick turnaround for for an entire machine is i started in july that

[32:44] we were building it in august and then i guess they were showing it off in las vegas that September

[32:50] right for showed up okay so so john contacted you about hudini in july and that's um okay so

[32:57] maybe i just can't i'm getting a digital twisted with like when american pinball and him first

[33:02] contacted you so it's summer quick turnaround did he and you did so for this one you got to do

[33:08] the play field artwork right correct yeah so i was the only artist on this project germi had

[33:15] left for stern and he's doing work for stern now i guess he just got tired of it all

[33:19] and so it was it was just me on this one okay and so john went when you're doing a play field the

[33:26] john have the play field designed or how did what did he give you to then lay art over

[33:33] yes so that was actually pretty interesting i'd never worked on a play field before um and luckily

[33:39] i didn't have to be involved in you know the design or anything because i don't know anything

[33:44] about that so he had kind of laid everything out he laid out where the um all the different

[33:49] elements like the physical elements on the board are going to be and then he sent that as like a

[33:56] like a template file and then on top of that i just kind of drew all these different elements

[34:03] um just to kind of make it work inside the the flat space that you actually see okay well i have

[34:10] to say when the world first saw who den you it's such a weird introduction right so the one guy

[34:16] drove to vagus it was in their hotel room the first visual we got was this blurry photo but what

[34:23] was identifiable to the world was it was inside john's zidware cabinet right which by this time

[34:32] people were you know whenever they hear john has a new game they they're very skeptical uh but when

[34:37] the photos got revealed when that when people actually went to the laws biggest show uh you know

[34:44] the the feedback was unanimously i'd buy that if that came out and it worked it's gorgeous i'd buy

[34:52] it and so i think i think that you should take a bow because of the i think who den was stunning

[34:57] i mean i saw it in person at at expo uh and it it is a visually stunning machine and i said this

[35:05] is what i said to you on the phone i said you know if anything i really want to see your talents

[35:10] applied to uh pinball as we move forward too because do you know right now like it sounds like

[35:17] all that work you did on hudini though may not come out it sounds like american pinball is replacing

[35:24] john with the hudini project and going in a whole new direction have they have they formally told you

[35:30] that are you still sort of like in limba with them um being in limba that's a pretty good

[35:37] pretty good description uh i would hate yeah like you i would i would hate to see all the time and

[35:43] and work that i did on that to to go away and i don't think that they would do that again like

[35:48] i work in a way that's very manipulatable uh so the files that i send you can take different elements

[35:56] like how john would kind of arrange things so even if even if they go in a different direction

[36:02] there's a lot of elements that could still be used and you know i'm all for them coming back to me

[36:09] and saying let's let's do another part of the the piece or let's let's redo this side of the cabinet

[36:15] or whatever because you know that i mean that just means more business for me right and what

[36:20] and the reason mad i wanted to have you on this podcast and i want to talk about

[36:25] where things go with like hudini is is here here's what i've been hearing and reading is

[36:31] they brought in joe balsa who's a designer and they bought brought in a a coder and they're working

[36:37] they're reworking hudini so john's hudini like the layout the the everything about it is is

[36:45] going to go away and they're redoing it and and i really don't want to see your talents right

[36:52] and the amazing thing that you did for hudini um be associated primarily as being like a john

[36:59] creation right because it's i think what you created is phenomenal and is such a great visual

[37:07] representation of of a hudini game and i think it and here's the thing i think it would sell

[37:14] like gangbusters and i think people fell in love with the way your hudini looked and i think if

[37:20] american pinball just moves in a completely different direction and the artwork that they go with

[37:28] isn't as stunning as yours i think this is going to be a problem for them and i do i do want them to

[37:33] continue to work with you on hudini and and i also want and i've said this to you and i'll say

[37:39] to the audience out there uh i i think you need to be working more in the pinball and to show you

[37:43] whether whether it's with american pinball or stern everyone out there jersey jack stern

[37:50] mad andrews here look at his work it's i i know mad i'm like i'm like bragging about you on my own

[37:55] podcast but but i i really think you know we've seen artwork for new machines that have come out at

[38:02] expo mad and i'm not sure if you like you follow but i'm telling you art is the Achilles heel of so

[38:08] many big titles coming out uh and your hudini artwork at expo by far the best looking artwork i saw

[38:16] on a play field the best looking artwork i i saw on a cabinet and i just think it'd be ashamed if

[38:21] that doesn't come new fruition now the silver lining here though to mad is that hudini is an open

[38:27] ip correct i can't tell you that i think it is right i think i so i i don't think hudini is like

[38:37] you have to pay the harry hudini estate i think enough time has passed where like anybody it's like

[38:42] allyson wonderland anyone can make an allyson wonderland game it's it's open ip um i think that's the

[38:50] case so what i'm saying is matt's done all this art now i guess the problem then becomes right is

[38:56] is that john owns that art right like you did it contractually for john um i signed

[39:04] the paperwork for american pinball so i they own the art yeah okay well that's so you you heard

[39:11] it here first ladies and gentlemen on canate is pinball podcast uh american pinball has all that

[39:17] amazing artwork in their portfolio right it's these are assets available to them so i just hope we

[39:24] see it i think we're going to see in a few weeks matt there's a the big show in texas called texas

[39:30] pinball festival where american pinball has said they're going to show us uh hudini for the first time

[39:38] it's not going to be the final game but i think we're going to get a first look so we'll see if

[39:45] if your art made it over or we'll see if they win a whole new art direction so yeah i'm rooting for

[39:51] you i think a lot of people out there are rooting for you because again i think people would would buy

[39:56] the hudini they saw if the hudini would like physically worked and i and i say this because i

[40:04] as you know i just took this possession of magic girl it's gorgeous it's gorgeous um but so you know

[40:10] and then the rest of the world now knows uh there are just physical elements of john's work that

[40:15] just don't work like there's a big mechanism you've seen in the in the middle of magic all those

[40:20] that big mechanism with the the sort of guy with two hands and the swirly ramps and there's all these

[40:26] magnets but it doesn't function you know so it's it's frustrating because you know he's one of the

[40:34] most creative minds out there but you know in anything like if you start a piece of artwork and if

[40:41] you just don't finish it like it it doesn't work right everything has to be completed um so what is

[40:48] what what knowing that you've sort of done all this work and you haven't seen anything other than

[40:56] the 25 magic girls will be the only artwork that you've done on pinball that makes it out there

[41:01] would you like to sort of start a new with a with a pinball company and maybe like a stern that

[41:07] these guys deliver and they have new games every three four months there's none of the drama and the

[41:12] uncertainty of your work getting out there are you open to working with someone like a stern or

[41:18] a jersey jack pinball to sort of to to improve their their artistic offering in the pinball world

[41:25] yeah absolutely I mean as long as I'm a freelancer I mean I can sign NDAs or whatever but I

[41:31] can work with anybody who wants to work with me so if somebody were to come to me like a jersey

[41:38] jack or a stern then I would be completely open to it as long as it didn't conflict with my

[41:43] prior engagements right I would totally be willing to do that right um would you can as a

[41:50] freelancer though could you sign on exclusive if it's only for pinball usage could you how

[41:56] does that work when you're free can you do something like that where you like you'd like you'd

[42:01] only work or contribute artwork to one manufacturer um I don't think so unless they really specifically

[42:10] say that in the contract like it's really a matter of time like usually I can only take on one

[42:16] freelance project at a time so it would just be whoever came first okay what so are you are you

[42:22] a full-time freelancer do you have a day job I have a day job um I'm designed like I'm kind of a

[42:30] technical illustrator for a small business uh where I live um they make um it's called the

[42:37] arrow flex and they make a product for uh string tremors you know like weed eaters and things like

[42:43] that they make a custom head with like line four line blades instead of a typical coil of string

[42:51] and so like I'll do uh user manuals and um you know just different marketing type of assets um

[43:02] and that's just kind of like um where I am during the day right and then if there's downtime I'll like

[43:08] work on other projects or um whatever and then I come home and I'll I'll work I'll work some more

[43:15] right ladies and gentlemen we got to get this man into the pinball world I mean we were talking

[43:21] weed cutters we this guy's designed the greatest cabinets and some of the greatest play field art

[43:28] we've seen in a long time and and I say that Matt because I don't know if you've checked the

[43:34] prices of pinball machines these days but they're now eight thousand ten thousand fifteen thousand

[43:39] dollar entities and an magic girl was sixteen thousand dollars originally I won't tell you

[43:46] what I paid for it it makes my girlfriend cringe because there's still no engagement ring

[43:51] purchase oh yeah yeah believe me uh we've been having the debate like kitchen renovation or magic

[43:57] girl and I'm like magic girl and she's like oh what um I would love to work like full time

[44:06] on pinball I think that would be very um uh very much an accomplishment for me um like I don't get a

[44:13] lot of uh pride out of what I do during the day so it's the freelance stuff it's like really cool

[44:20] to me so if I could do that you're you're probably confident that your bosses are not listening to

[44:26] a pinball podcast out there right only yes only five to eight hundred people listen to you in the

[44:31] world so your secrets safe with with the the pinball community but what I'd love for people who

[44:37] listen to this podcast who are on pinside and are very vocal because this community is very close

[44:44] knit and then the buyers are also very closely connected to these manufacturers so if if anyone

[44:51] out there at Stern or JJP or highway or you know there's there's Dutch pinball but I would say

[44:58] look I would really want to see you land probably with and I'm gonna I think spooky pinball Stern

[45:04] and JJP are the are the three places you should look at because those three companies are financially

[45:12] doing okay and are gonna be making games and you know I think spooky would be great I'm just

[45:18] gonna say Matt Matt I think I want to almost like connect you with them because the artwork that

[45:23] you bring can elevate a game because at the end of the day you know when the machine's off half

[45:29] of the time of owning a pinball machine is when you're not flipping it you're enjoying looking at it

[45:33] and and that's why art is just so important on on a pinball machine um so Matt like

[45:40] 2017 are you we're gonna do our best to get you as connected as we can to pinball manufacturers

[45:46] is there anything else like that you want to tell us or want to share with us about the whole

[45:53] John and and Jay pop and Zidware and American pinball story that is interesting that people might not

[46:00] know when it comes to um what you've experienced um see

[46:11] were you happy with the final magic girl product when you saw it the way he arranged everything

[46:16] oh yeah I mean I'm I'm happy with uh just how it was used and everything um like like I said it was

[46:23] just I was so in the dark the whole time with magic girl that it's like actually seeing the machine

[46:29] was like oh yeah I remember doing all this and then it was like okay cool this is all here and

[46:35] it's being used for something and like some people are gonna be able to enjoy it but I do wish that

[46:41] you know pinball in general was a more widespread um I guess industry but it does make sense that

[46:49] it has become a lot more niche in the digital age you know yeah but it's it's it's sort of right now

[46:57] in transition where the major manufacturers are using LCDs and using animations now and I know

[47:03] you were talking about uh designing for for video games and and your your designs lend well to

[47:12] LCD and and more sort of a digital format so there you know there's a new company to um it's

[47:19] called p3 multi-morphic where the entire play field is a screen and the ball rolls over it

[47:25] and and let me tell you they need they need help in getting the visuals of that experience to

[47:33] be even better so there's a lot of opportunity and what I'll do Matt after this podcast is is

[47:38] I'll send you some contact information on the people at all these companies that that I know

[47:44] to help facilitate uh meeting up with some of these these individuals yeah because again it's very

[47:50] small close knit and uh I think it'd be great to to get your talents out there and uh you know I

[47:58] don't often do this I don't often like use this podcast I just overtly promote someone but Matt

[48:04] you're like such a nice guy and and I really do think that the world knows Jeremy and zombie Yeti

[48:09] so well and I said it to him like man but nobody really is talking about

[48:14] Matt and like what you've done on these games and I and I think your artwork is just as stunning

[48:20] and I you know I think when Houdini came out to no one even know like who did it they still didn't

[48:24] know and hopefully now they all know that it was the work of Matt Andrews in South Carolina

[48:33] completely nobody but you know no but it's like we're gonna we'll get you out of the out of the uh

[48:38] the weed whacking industry it and it's right the the the pinball industry uh I think that's

[48:43] that's that's my greatest weakness as uh as a as a professional is it I just I I've always hated being

[48:50] sold to so I don't ever want to try to sell myself um right you know I just I never want to like say

[48:58] hey you need me I just kind of wait for people to come to me right and you know sometimes that

[49:04] happens like with John but nine percent of the time it's never gonna happen because people aren't

[49:10] gonna seek out things if they don't know they exist yeah no it's it's a good point and I could tell

[49:16] just by our correspondence that they're Matt you're like a really humble nice guy and you know it's

[49:22] it always amazes me in pinball because it is a unique industry where the people with like the

[49:27] extra ordinary talent are super nice they're super you know there's somewhat reserved there's

[49:33] someone quiet they go back they go about just like doing their work and doing it amazingly well

[49:38] and there's also like the flip side where you got like the ego guys the the salesman guys who

[49:44] all talk all talk and they like don't deliver uh but at the end of the day uh when the talented

[49:52] individuals are the ones making these games that's when the sales go through the roof I mean as

[49:57] stern what happened when they let zombie Yeti do ghost busters how quickly that game sold and

[50:04] and continues to sell because it like just looks awesome you know if it was Photoshopped ghost busters

[50:10] artwork on there no way that game would have sold as well so Matt I really appreciate you taking

[50:17] the time and talking to us your story is as relevant today as ever knowing that magic girl is out

[50:24] there I I feel proud to own your artwork in my home it is as people know I collect pinball to be

[50:33] sort of like the focal point of my living room like it's a piece of artwork that it and your artwork

[50:39] is what I see every day so and it's it's gonna blow people away because let me tell you the cabinet

[50:45] the artwork on it the way it was printed is phenomenal unfortunately I talked about this yesterday

[50:50] the printing on the play field Jeremy's artwork is all pixelated it's not perfectly it's not

[50:56] so screened and done properly yeah I don't I just like it but and I was talking to Jeremy about it

[51:02] today and he's just like you know he was talking about how John doesn't understand like layering

[51:06] and when you do over wood it has to be layered properly and you you know and it's just it makes sense

[51:12] it's like John sees it as being done because he has the artwork in hand but there's a whole

[51:17] another art form to actually putting an image on wood and then clear coating it and unless you get

[51:23] the right people to do that because those you know when you work with a different medium they're

[51:27] going to go back to the artist and say well we need to done this way so it looks right and I don't

[51:33] think I think there was I think John like once again like stubbornly just did it the way he wanted

[51:38] to do it and and but it still looks amazing I just tell him Jeremy I mean his his artwork and your

[51:44] artwork together magic girl is the most visually stunning Pimmel machine I've ever seen it doesn't

[51:50] even matter if it plays I tell people it's just like this beautiful work of art yeah it might be

[51:56] the most expensive copy table that I ever buy but it flips it plays and it's fun I mean I it's

[52:02] it's it there are some parts of that game that may never work but it will it will always be the visual

[52:09] knockout that I think changed the way people think about how good a Pimmel machine can look and

[52:15] you are very much part of that package map yeah well you got to have a good team like everybody has

[52:21] to have specific skills and I think you know obviously John tried to tackle too much but he was

[52:26] very good at art direction and kind of guiding me through the process like I would like I wouldn't

[52:32] have known anything like what to do to make it make it so appealing I just kind of contributed my

[52:39] talent and then along with him and Jeremy like we all came came together completely separately but

[52:47] we all kind of came together to make this final piece of art that you're so proud of right

[52:54] yeah and then it's that just me but I think I think that's a really good point too you know the

[52:58] when the collaboration happens where everyone's in the right role then the outcome is always

[53:05] beneficial and awesome I mean there's it's it's it's true in any any air any walk of life right any

[53:10] career you yeah you put the wrong person in the wrong role or someone tries to do too much

[53:15] that they're not capable of doing it it can all collapse and and look we saw collapse it's it

[53:20] doesn't take five years to make a pinball machine and and magic girls finally out but there's still

[53:27] people who paid for raza and allyson wonderland that will never get anything probably so but the

[53:33] future is is ahead of us ahead of us and Matt we really will we'll do our best to get you working in

[53:41] the pinball industry and I think a lot of people are going to hear this podcast and start dropping your

[53:45] name as someone who should be contributing to the pinball world so I really appreciate you taking

[53:52] the time to come on and I and we will we will continue to just talk personally and and and get

[53:57] the ball rolling on getting you some additional projects yeah absolutely and it kind of like you

[54:05] contacting me kind of brought to life this idea that pinball really is something that people

[54:11] care but like the pinball art is something people really care about and it's so great and

[54:16] gratifying to hear that so what I'm going to do is I'm going to get on pinside because I've never

[54:21] made an account I'm going to get on there and I'm going to well first I'm going to ask john like

[54:26] what's the deal with the art like can I sell it or whatever and then I'm going to make a thread

[54:31] on pinside with all the art that I've done for magic girl and raza yeah that I love it just tell

[54:39] tell him canada sent you when you get to pinside I'm actually joking because

[54:45] everyone knows this too is I'm not on pinside because I was banned like a year ago

[54:51] really and I'll tell you I'll tell you why quickly is I was just I was just a really opinionated

[54:57] member of the forum but me and the moderation team there didn't see eye to eye on everything

[55:03] but but believe me I am and if you go on the magic girl thread today it's like everyone

[55:11] still likes canada understands the value I contribute to the hobby but you will be welcomed

[55:16] with open arms and they are going to be very thankful that you came on this podcast and we're

[55:21] getting the ball rolling so it's not there's no bad blood don't worry no one's going to be like

[55:26] wait a minute you talk to canada we hate you now it's not going to be like that trust me

[55:30] all right um but yeah and I also spend too much time on forms in general so it's good that I get

[55:36] banned from a few of them every once in a while because uh there's a real world out there that

[55:42] it is more engaging so so Matt I really appreciate the time again don't be scared pinside will

[55:48] welcome you to open arms and I really do think you should contact john because I think there is a

[55:53] ginormous revenue stream for you and for people who worked hard to create pinball art and people

[55:57] love to buy it they love you know the big I'm a marketer where people fall down with artwork is

[56:03] put it on t-shirts put it on posters put it on this you know I don't want to buy playfields all

[56:09] the time I'm not going to walk around with like a 20 pound playfield but I would love to wear

[56:14] a t-shirt of my favorite game or or t-shirt and posters and prints um original prints even you
