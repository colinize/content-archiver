[00:00] I really can't say.

[00:02] Baby, don't hold out baby, it's cold outside.

[00:06] Happy, happy holiday everyone from the world's number one pinball podcast,

[00:18] Canadian pinball podcast, episode 291. It's cold outside, but you're going to get warmed up

[00:24] with an amazing, amazing podcast. I have a special guest on this episode, an intelligent,

[00:30] articulate man of business. And his name we're going to call CEO Dave. And he leads a 30 million

[00:39] dollar company. He manages people. He understands a lot about what it takes to run a successful

[00:45] company. And he's also a pinball fanatic. And what we're going to do, and this is going to be a

[00:50] series of shows. Okay, we've broken them up. Is we are going to do a SWAT analysis of pinball

[00:59] companies. And we're going to do one at a time. And SWAT analysis, SWOT stands for strengths,

[01:07] weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. And we're also going to talk about the strategies and

[01:12] the marketing plans of these companies. But I think it's a really, really fun, deep dive into each

[01:17] of these manufacturers. I hope you guys enjoy it. I would love to hear your feedback on each of

[01:23] our commentary on each manufacturer. And here's the thing, the other part. I'm getting more people

[01:30] email me that they want to hear more of the master episodes remain. So if you feel strongly either way,

[01:37] email me a Canadian pinball at gmail.com. I'm happy, happy holidays. Ladies and gentlemen,

[01:43] here is CEO Dave. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome a very special guest to Canadian

[01:50] pinball podcast. Yes, there is someone else on planet earth who will do an interview with

[01:56] canada. I want to welcome what I'm going to call or who I'm going to call CEO Dave to the show.

[02:01] Dave, welcome to canada pinball podcast. Hey, thanks. Great to be here. It's awesome to have you.

[02:07] And you might recognize the voice Dave left me a really articulate response to Jersey Jack pinball.

[02:16] And what we're going to do with Dave, because Dave's a business guy runs a company that is in the

[02:20] tens of millions has had many jobs in tech. So he has a background in building companies. And Dave

[02:29] came to me and said, how about we analyze some of these pinball companies. And that's what we're going

[02:34] to do on this episode. Does that sound like a good way to spend an hour, Dave?

[02:40] Yeah, I'm excited. All right. And what we're going to do, because Dave has actually done some homework,

[02:45] we're going to do a SWOT analysis of pinball companies. And we're really just going to deconstruct

[02:51] them and give our opinions on the different manufacturers, what we think their challenges are,

[02:58] what we think the opportunities are. But we're not going to do all the manufacturers on this

[03:03] episode. We're going to break it up. Dave, which three should we focus on for episode one of our

[03:09] business marketing analysis of pinball companies? Yeah, I love it. If it's okay with you, I'd love to

[03:15] start with Stern, Jersey Jack and Sturkey Ball. All right. That's completely fine. Those are

[03:23] sort of like the top three and most people's mind in terms of pinball companies that have been around

[03:27] for the last few years or 30 years if we're talking about Stern. All right. So let's do this. So we

[03:34] want to we want to tackle this, Dave, by doing a SWOT analysis. Now for those of you who don't

[03:41] follow marketing or business, a SWOT analysis stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,

[03:48] and threats to these companies. Okay. So let's start with what we feel are the strengths for Stern

[03:55] pinball. And I'm going to let you go first. I think people will learn from you, Dave, and they will

[04:00] probably get dumber when they listen to me. So I'm going to let you start this off. So what do you

[04:05] think the strengths are for Stern pinball? Yeah, sure. So I think Stern has three primary strengths.

[04:13] I think the first is obvious. They are the dominant player in the market, right? From a market share

[04:19] perspective, talents, that they've gotten house, brand recognition, they are the 800 pound gorilla

[04:25] in the market. So that is clearly a strength. I think the second strength I would say is they

[04:34] have reached economies of scale, right? Like they've sorted out how to do manufacturing at scale,

[04:40] they have an incredible dealer distribution network. They really sort of figure that out.

[04:45] The last piece I would say, and I think this is going to be increasingly important next year

[04:51] of the year after, is don't forget Stern is a private equity backed company, right? And so private

[04:58] equity firms are ones that have a lot of money and they invest in private companies. And they are

[05:04] backed by a private equity company, which means they've got money to tap if the economy goes south.

[05:11] So pinball being what it is, a bit of a luxury, they can kind of weather a downturn if needed.

[05:20] And we hear that a lot. We hear what happens at the economy dips, but history has shown that

[05:25] even in a soft economy, pinball has seemed to weather the storm pretty well in previous years when

[05:32] the economy is dipped. Yeah, I think that's true. I think that's true, but it is comforting me if I

[05:40] were Stern, it would be comforting me, no, I had that money in hand just in case, right? Because even if

[05:47] pinball still stays strong, you have a lot of competition coming to the market in a time where

[05:53] we probably will go into recession in the next two years. And so you've got to wonder if you're

[05:58] sort of ramping up deep root or you're ramping up spookier, whomever, that might be tough for folks

[06:06] to get through and it might be an opportunity for Stern to buy other people. Right. Okay, and so we

[06:12] don't know, do we know who their private equity firm is? Did you mention that? Yeah, well, we do.

[06:19] And I'm glad you brought that up. So their private equity firm is a firm called Haggerty Peterson,

[06:25] which is an Illinois. And there's two things that's interesting about this. One is that I have

[06:32] actually worked with PE firms, private equity firms in the past. And what's interesting is that

[06:37] generally they like to buy about 85% of a company, right? I don't know how much they bought from

[06:43] Stern, right? Like who knows? It's private. But I do know that like on average, they like to at

[06:50] least buy 85% if not more. So there's an interesting question there about like, you know, you'll say that

[06:58] Gary Stern has a cash grab, you know, with the Beatles. That might not be going to Jerry Stern,

[07:03] right? Like he may not own much of the company at this point. The other thing that I think is

[07:09] interesting is that the Corinthians Stern website, they brought on that PE firm in 2009.

[07:16] And most PE firms, what they do is they buy these assets, they grow them and then they sell them

[07:21] and they sell them to other PE firms. And so usually they like to have what they call an exit,

[07:27] in about five, maybe six years. But Stern's PE company has held on to Stern for 10 years. And so

[07:36] why is that? You know, are they friends with Gary? Because they're local. Maybe are they,

[07:43] you know, having a hard time selling Stern is something else.

[07:49] Gautful because they just make a ton of money because they're selling

[07:53] eight bucks for $9,000 in the world by now. You got it. You got it. You got to do like the

[07:58] PE market's been really frothy and these companies buy themselves from each other all the time.

[08:03] And it's become bigger than the IPO market. And so the fact that they've held Stern for 10 years,

[08:08] I think they're probably making really good money up this company.

[08:11] And I've heard from my friends over at Stern who would kill me if I told anyone on this podcast

[08:18] who they are that Stern year after year over the last few years has had their best year to date

[08:25] and each year it keeps growing. So it doesn't surprise me. I think the last three to four years,

[08:30] especially have been extremely profitable for Stern Pimball. So that probably is why they're

[08:36] holding on. So I'm looking at your strengths list here, Dave Tuen. And what about the fact that

[08:42] Stern just has the distribution model locked down? Yeah, that's that's I mean that's huge.

[08:49] It's incredible. Like both domestic and international, right? Like they literally own the channel

[08:55] for the majority of the Pimball market. And that's I think when you look at competitors like

[08:59] Deeproot, you know, for all their hubris and ego and sort of excitement to build something great,

[09:06] it's going to be tremendously difficult and take a long time to kind of replicate the

[09:11] Stern distribution model. Like that is 30 plus years of hard work. And that's a real

[09:17] competitive advantage for them. And we keep hearing that, right? That there's there are desires

[09:24] by these other companies to reach customers without a distributor model almost like you would buy

[09:30] directly from them. And but do you think that would work with Pimball knowing that these are

[09:36] devices that people do like to have that local support on hand because these machines

[09:43] do have a tendency to need maintenance and be set up properly. And what are your thoughts? I mean,

[09:49] how many people will buy direct? Yeah, it's a great question. I don't know. I mean, it's

[09:59] I think there's an opportunity and we'll get into this when it comes to Jersey Jack. I think there

[10:05] is an opportunity kind of invest more in direct to consumer sales. And I think there's a way to do

[10:10] that and still provide that support. I don't think that's a good path for Stern, right? Like

[10:16] Stern has a much bigger operation for one of the smaller guys. I think it actually does make sense

[10:20] to go more direct to consumer. We can talk about that in a bit. But that would be disastrous for

[10:26] Stern, right? Right. Yeah. Now within the strengths, as we're doing a SWAT analysis, within the

[10:32] strengths bucket, these are these things that are purely business strengths, but they're like so

[10:39] for example, like the Stern having the best licenses and the ability to secure the best licenses,

[10:47] does would that go in the strength section here? Yeah, I think so. And that's a great point, Chris.

[10:53] I also think talent, right? When we say they're the dominant player, that's market share,

[10:59] the licenses, it's the distribution channel, but also like the talent that they have on hand. I

[11:04] mean, Lyman Cheaps is pretty irreplaceable, right? And that is that is a real strength for them.

[11:12] The Stern strength list is going to be the longest of any company that we talk about ever. I mean,

[11:17] right? I mean, you could keep going. They've got the most talent. And we're an listener of the show.

[11:23] This is not a Stern shale podcast, but you can't deny the fact that the strengths of Stern Pimball

[11:30] are indicative. And we see it every day because they have 90 plus percent of the market for

[11:36] reason. So they do have the best talent. They're the best distribution. They have the best cloud and

[11:42] licensing and merchandising ability because when they go to secure a license, they can show an

[11:48] IP holder 30 years of making this product where someone else who's brand new has no proof

[11:57] that they can get it done. In fact, there's so many more companies that have failed at securing

[12:01] new IP and botched the whole process that probably makes Stern's pitch even easier. Look what happened

[12:08] to alien guys. Look what happened to Predator. You should go with us. It's a great point, Chris.

[12:13] The great point. You're absolutely right. But because this show is also Dave, the most negative

[12:18] Pimball podcast on the planet, let's talk about Stern's weaknesses. Sure. Sure.

[12:29] As you've educated your listeners, quality control from play field, chip in to cabinets,

[12:36] splitting, you can go through pin-sides to everyone complaining about quality control.

[12:42] It does seem like quality kind of ebbs and flows at Stern. That's been something that

[12:49] that sort of honks them. I think there's probably two other weaknesses that I think about. One is

[12:58] despite the fact that their talent pool is part of their strengths. And mine, this is an aging

[13:06] talent pool. Steve Richie is almost 70. Dwight, the young buck, is in his 50s. Like George and

[13:14] Lyman are probably in their 50s as well. These are not spring chickens making these machines.

[13:25] You have to wonder, everyone has professional shelf life. Their core talent is hitting

[13:32] the backside of their professional shelf life. That is a real weakness.

[13:37] I would add to that. I think this goes along with the age. I would add that one of their weaknesses

[13:45] is that I think these guys, they run out of ideas. I mean that because I think that

[13:52] cookie cutter or seeing the same stuff over and over again is a definite weakness when you're

[13:57] trying to get people excited about pinball and get that hype going with each new release.

[14:03] So I think that goes along with the fact that these guys have been doing it for so many years.

[14:07] They just run out of creative ideas. That's just a natural thing a creative person goes through.

[14:14] No, look, I think you're right. I mean, so that's a real weakness is that their core talent pool

[14:22] is all well overfishing. At this point. And you're right. Getting a bit to sale, I mean,

[14:29] in some quarters, that probably is not, they don't have that issue. I don't think they have that issue

[14:35] on the design side. As you point out, they're pretty good. I think the last thing is,

[14:42] economies of scale is a real strength, but it's also a weakness. So it's a weakness in that

[14:48] for large operation. They've got a big overhead to maintain. They have to keep that line moving.

[14:52] Like they can't really afford to have much downtime because they're paying a lot of sell.

[14:57] So that's a risk or weakness that they carry by being the big.

[15:04] Right. And we definitely see that. And I think alongside that for me,

[15:11] having to keep the line moving means that they're on a strict schedule with all of these games

[15:17] because they can't afford to have a weaker two where the line has stopped because the cost is so

[15:24] humongous for them. On every day, they're not making 50 or 100 games. And I think that also,

[15:30] to me, adds a weakness I would have for Stern, is I think they're vulnerable. And this is sort of

[15:35] like a weird thing to say in a weakness column. But I think they're vulnerable in the sense that

[15:41] they're not putting as much magic or wow into these games because they need to keep the line moving.

[15:48] And I think they've found the shortest or a little bit of a shortcut where if it's artwork and theme

[15:55] and LCD, they don't need to do as much mechanically. So I think the games themselves are vulnerable

[16:03] when they're put next to other manufacturers games that they just doesn't seem like there's as much

[16:07] in them. But that's a little bit of a subjective thing. But I definitely think

[16:12] in the competitive landscape of Pimball, people are going to be comparing your game to

[16:16] everything else out there. And if it doesn't have as much in it, the dollars could go elsewhere,

[16:22] right? Yeah, that's a great point. You're right. Yeah. Okay. So the next thing on our SWAT analysis are

[16:30] the opportunities. Interesting to talk about opportunities with a company like Stern that's got

[16:36] 90% of the market. You know, they're doing a lot really well. But what do you think the opportunities

[16:41] are for Stern Pimball? Well, I think because they have 90% of the market, like where the market goes

[16:48] is where Stern goes, right? So if the market grows, they benefit as the market shrinks, they

[16:53] skillet the most because they are the best player. So I actually think they're uniquely positioned

[17:00] from both a capital and a scale perspective to broaden this market. And we can sort of talk about

[17:08] some specific opportunities there. But you know, the Pimball market, you know, it's had a little bit

[17:15] of a research, but if you actually look at the statistics, it's, you know, it's a $200 million

[17:20] market, right? And it's not that big. Board games are like 10x the size of Pimball. Trading cards

[17:28] are like half the size of the Pimball market, right? So it's not a particularly big market that's

[17:34] they're dominating. So I think if I were Stern, I would be thinking about how do I grow the

[17:40] addressable market? How do I grow the market set? So that's one. I think there's just maybe

[17:47] quickly there's two other opportunities. I think they have to get young talent in. And I think

[17:53] there's an opportunity to do an apprentice program with an engineering school in the Midwest,

[17:59] right? Somewhere in the Illinois region, like I think there's a way to do kind of a Northeastern

[18:04] style co-op program potentially where they can kind of bring a new talent to kind of backfill

[18:11] some of those older aging designers. And then I think lastly, Chris, I love to hear you thought on this.

[18:18] Stern has a pretty deep catalog of titles of their own, like their own IP. Like is there an

[18:26] opportunity to kind of go back into the vault and not just do another refresher like Spider-Man,

[18:32] but would it make sense from market perspective to have zombie Yeti like actually do a new version

[18:39] of Sea Witch? Like would there be demand for that? And doesn't make sense to kind of show off their

[18:45] own in house IP? I don't know. I love to hear your thoughts on it. Yeah, I mean the original IP

[18:53] stuff I would say is always a difficult thing to create modern day demand for. Where I think the

[19:02] opportunity lies though is in renewing some of the existing games they have in their portfolio,

[19:10] but modernizing them with new art. So for example, imagine Christopher Fransche doing Lord of the Rings

[19:17] again. You don't have to design the game. It's one of the best coded games of all time,

[19:24] but you could refresh that game and give it high res artwork with some of their new artists.

[19:30] And I think that would sell like gangbusters, right? Now that comes with the cost of renewing

[19:35] the license and we know that that is an issue, but there's a lot there. Like Transnothergaid example,

[19:42] if we look at the games that people really want and the vault approach, which I think is smart,

[19:49] I think the smart approach with vaults is to refresh them in a way like they did Spider-Man.

[19:55] And I think there's a lot of potential sales there. But you know, it's hard though,

[20:00] because even as I think about a day, with Stern releasing four new titles a year,

[20:06] three of them are cornerstone games. You know, we didn't really talk about this as a weakness,

[20:10] but I think this should be brought up is a simple market fatigue of how many years can they release

[20:18] so many games at what point do people run out of money and room to keep absorbing this many titles?

[20:26] That's a great point. It's a great point. Yeah, I think you're right. And I mean, not to mention that,

[20:32] you know, it's going to be a really crowded year next year with, you know, sort of all the

[20:37] planned titles coming. And so I think you're right. Like I think if I were sort of working at Stern,

[20:44] I would be very concerned about like how do we broaden this market? Because we've got a bunch of

[20:49] P capital. It's a small niche market that has been largely shrinking over the last 10 years.

[20:57] And you know, where this market goes is where our fortunes are going to go. And how do we grow it?

[21:02] Right. I think it's a really important question. Right. And I think your opportunity list is great.

[21:07] A few things I want to add. One would be I do think there's an opportunity to make a pinball

[21:14] experience. And this goes to your first point to a broader audience of player. And I think to do

[21:20] that, they need to start thinking about how could I create whether it's modes or an ability to

[21:28] start a game where a casual player can figure it out and understand how to jump on it and have fun.

[21:36] So I'll give you just an example that just popped into my head as I'm looking at Batman. Imagine

[21:42] just a beginner's mode for dummies where all we're trying to do is see who can hit the crane the most

[21:48] times in two minutes. It keeps feeding you balls. You're smackin at the crane. And that's a beginner

[21:54] mode just to get people comfortable with flipping, with trapping a ball. You know, I think there's an

[22:01] opportunity to do that to sort of make these games more approachable. I also think the biggest

[22:06] opportunity is to finally add some sort of internet connectivity to pinball. And I can't believe

[22:14] we're working with an electro mechanical toy in 2018 and the internet is nowhere to be found with it.

[22:22] Yeah, I agree. I agree. I think you're spot on. Like do you think there's,

[22:28] like if you look at movie theaters, right, that are hungry. They definitely track the younger

[22:36] demographics, right? Like the folks going to movies are still pretty much like high school and

[22:42] sort of college age. They are having trouble getting folks to come out, right? And so they're

[22:48] looking for reasons to kind of drag people back into theaters. And you've only really got a couple

[22:53] of big chains that own most of the theater that are in the US. Like I wondered, do you think there's

[23:00] a play to kind of strike a deal with low, is there ANC or some of like that to sort of throw a bunch

[23:06] of games into theaters and see if that's a way to expand the base. Do you think that might have

[23:12] some effect with the younger audience? No. And I'll explain why. I just I still think like and

[23:20] that and I hear from some of my operator friends who have who have like redemption games on location

[23:26] and at movie theaters. It's just and that's a good question of like an overall weakness for the

[23:34] entire hobby is how do you get young people into pinball and we don't have to tackle that because

[23:42] that's like trying to boil the ocean with the entire industry. I think pinball broadens. I do.

[23:49] I think it broadens with the right themes. You know, many people probably just bought ghost

[23:54] busters because they freaking love ghost busters right. They walk and do a distributor. They want a

[23:58] game for their home and they see ghost busters or they see Batman or they see Star Wars. I think

[24:04] theme helps broaden your audience. And that's also why I think I would look at well what kinds of themes

[24:12] could I do that would be of appeal to maybe a younger buyer maybe someone in their early

[24:18] 30s or mid 30s that you know has a little bit more money. He's got a better job right now. He's

[24:25] he's looking to have some fun and put something fun into his house or apartment. You know, I don't see

[24:31] and that's where I think the old guys that are like making all the decisions are sort of getting

[24:36] out of touch with the kinds of themes that a younger more contemporary pinball fan would be in do.

[24:44] Yeah, that's. I used to work for a licensing company and the guy that ran it who you know from

[24:55] Marvel used to say that it's around the age of 35 where people sort of when they turn 35 is when

[25:04] their their disposal income really you know starts to grow and they can buy stupid stuff and when

[25:09] they're particularly whistful for the things with the past. Yeah, the shows they remember the kid

[25:15] or the brands and so it's really like your mid 30s and so you yeah, I mean you can very easily sort of

[25:23] backtrack and take a look at folks there 35 years of age today like what were the hot shows and

[25:30] properties right back then. The challenge. The challenge will always be this with pinball is

[25:36] the problem is there starts to become a gap because if you get to people like in their

[25:43] in their early 30s now right they didn't grow up around any arcade scene whatsoever.

[25:50] So you know what I'm saying they grew up in the PlayStation Xbox world, the internet world of

[25:56] video gaming and so what happens then is they don't have a longing for pinball on any level

[26:02] and so the the only way to hook the next generation is to is to get them at barcaids and to get

[26:10] them into pinball leagues and that's a really difficult thing to do and and you know again we're

[26:15] getting down into that like macro level of like will people just age out of pinball and is this the

[26:21] last golden age of pinball sales and this stern know this and that's why they're giving us like

[26:27] the monsters which is probably the most unrelatable title to someone who's in their 30s.

[26:33] That's fair that's fair right so yeah it's good question. So that leads us good to our last point

[26:39] of the SWAT analysis which are the threats to stern pinball now what do you think are the threats

[26:45] Dave to stern pinball. Yeah well I think the biggest point is what you just hit on which is that

[26:51] the pinball hobby today is dominated by you know all the busted white guys in their 50s and so my

[26:59] you know myself included in that cohort and so who is buying these games in 10 15 20 years right

[27:06] like that that's the biggest threat but I think sort of taking it down to level the most

[27:14] media threat for next year really is like the increased amount of selection for buyers right like

[27:20] there's a lot more manufacturers there'll be a lot more inventory in the market it's a very small

[27:25] firebase so you know even if folks are not buying spooky or deep-rooted J.J.P. or whatever

[27:33] it still a giant distraction that's stern you know that has not had to deal with hiring so that's

[27:38] a real threat I do think specifically and I might have been influenced by you by saying this

[27:45] I do think Chicago gaming and J.J.P. specifically are real competitive threats to stern like bull on

[27:55] I don't buy that that comment that like stern grabbed Godzilla to like for Charlie I mean maybe

[28:02] maybe I don't think stern thinks of spooky as a competitive threat but I do think they worry about

[28:08] Chicago gaming and J.J.P. and I know what do you think they grabbed Godzilla simply because they

[28:13] were mad that Scott Dinesi didn't make TNA with stern I mean it was it was it was a soap opera

[28:21] power play um look I I think for a stern again the biggest threat is that the industry over time

[28:30] will shrink it won't keep growing and they know this I think they're smart I think another threat

[28:37] that they have are obviously those manufacturers you mentioned because if Jersey Jack can really

[28:43] finally make a great game like a Willy Wonka or a toy story like a theme people actually want

[28:51] you know I was walking home tonight David I was joking with a friend about who loves pinball as well

[28:55] and I was like there's a reason why Jersey Jack can't sell out of collector's edition because nobody

[29:00] effing really wants dialed in the hobbit or pirate's the Caribbean as a theme right right but watch

[29:06] how quick Willy Wonka collector's edition sells out watch how quick toy story sells out so I

[29:13] and I'm not sure you know Chicago gaming with monster batch I think they're gonna sell their

[29:19] thousand or whatever of these remakes and it definitely is a threat because it's taking money out

[29:25] of the marketplace and and they're betting on a horse they know wins a race with these old titles

[29:32] that people love but again I think they're also gonna run into a little bit of fatigue and I think

[29:39] you know Stern doesn't have so many threats I think their biggest enemy is themselves and I

[29:44] and I mean that I think Stern's biggest threat to people leaving Stern's shores for other companies

[29:51] shores is Stern cutting too many corners I think if they keep if they keep improving what's in their

[29:59] games with these licenses with the cadence and with the you know the art packages and the code and

[30:06] if they keep going in that right direction I think they're gonna be pretty unbeatable they're not

[30:12] gonna lose much of that market share and that means that Jersey Jack and Chicago gaming and deep

[30:18] root the onlyses on them to make something that is much more magical than what Stern is putting in

[30:24] a box but so that will be opportunities for those companies yeah for sure so let's talk about

[30:31] if we're gonna look at these companies we don't have to go deep into all this but in terms of

[30:36] sales and marketing and we can kind of talk about how these companies are targeting people

[30:43] what they're doing to sort of reach customers and get people excited and get them hyped to buy

[30:48] their products so how do you think Stern does in terms of their their sales and marketing approach

[30:56] for Pimble yeah I mean if we look at just thinking about 2019

[31:06] investing in that distribution channel I think makes a lot of sense for them right like they've

[31:12] got this amazing competitive advantage with the distributors they clearly are careful not to

[31:18] disrupt that it's a hard thing for others to disrupt and so I think you know as we look at like

[31:24] marketing dollars you know really their primary buyer is in fact the distributor right and so

[31:31] you know if I were in charge of marketing over there like I would be putting at least half of my

[31:37] marketing dollars into supporting that distributor channel right because I think it's really important

[31:45] I do I think they have such an important point is once a distributor

[31:55] buys a game from Stern the game is sold yeah Stern doesn't see more money if a distributor flips

[32:02] it or someone flips that game is now sold through to the distributor Stern is paid so they don't

[32:08] care how many people buy Primus Pimble because 100 of them have been sold through to Primus

[32:16] absolutely absolutely yeah I totally agree and I mean

[32:22] they just got to get these machines out and that distribution channel is really powerful and

[32:27] effective and I mean even look at the Beatles example where you know they gave the power of pricing

[32:32] to the distributors I mean you could argue that that was a little cowardly right to sort of put

[32:38] that on them to kind of figure it out but it's also like an incredible vote of confidence in that

[32:44] channel and I think it shows how important it is for the company so I think continuing to invest

[32:50] in that is really going to help ward off any kind of competitive threat in the market the other

[32:56] piece and Chris I'd love to hear your thought on this like we've heard you talk about

[33:01] which I think is right you know how great zombie Yeti's artwork is how great Chris for

[33:07] franchise artwork is there's a lot of great artists out there right a ton and like I really

[33:14] don't understand why any of the companies but in particular Stern sort of lean so heavy

[33:20] on just those two artists to the point of kind of bring them out like I would agree it's it's like you

[33:26] know I absolutely agree you should never see any artist have back-to-back games like iron made

[33:35] in and Deadpool like both and then you know three titles from Yeti in one year all you got to do

[33:44] is go on Deviant Art and look at all the different incredible artists that are out there and I agree I

[33:49] think there's too much we found this person and we're just going to keep using them over and over

[33:56] and over again I have one caveat though is I do think that franchise art style just works so well

[34:05] with Pimball because of the kind of medium Pimball is it just works perfect on that playfield because

[34:13] you need a little bit of like a flatter detailed artwork you can't get too layered and too

[34:20] it's you can't get too busy and I think he has got a very perfect style for Pimball but I also

[34:28] you know I also think it should be a special occasion when these guys come out but I also think

[34:33] you could have three or four special artists we haven't seen Dirty Donny do anything

[34:37] in a while so I think he's also on the roster as well but yeah you got to mix it up you got to

[34:43] mix it up as much as possible yeah I agree I mean there are some of great artists out there art

[34:48] in the grand scheme of things is not that expensive and so like it would not take much to kind of

[34:54] broaden that pool out but there's two organizational things that I would just hit on

[35:01] with Stern like I do think you had mentioned potential competitive threat of people being poached

[35:11] out of Stern right and you specifically mentioned like if you're kind of just pumping out machines

[35:16] and there's not a lot of innovation that talent might be poachable but by other companies and

[35:22] I think that's right like I wonder if it makes sense if you were working at Stern to kind of set

[35:27] a bonus plan tied to profitability and quality assurance quite honestly right because quality has

[35:33] been sort of hit or missed so like I wonder if it makes sense to be like hey you were going to

[35:37] give everyone a bonus if we hit these profit margins and you know we get a customer NPS quality

[35:44] score of X or above like I wonder if that makes sense and then the other piece that I think about is

[35:52] Gary is not going to live forever right like he's well into 70s and so outside of George Gomez

[36:00] like who is that second tier of management at Stern that takes over when Gary retire

[36:07] I think like I I wonder if this is the year to start thinking about getting that second tier

[36:12] of management in place yeah and and like and I think we probably should have said this right

[36:16] at the beginning Davis like we don't really have a ton of information into the internal

[36:23] workings of these organizations right a lot of it is private we don't know the numbers we don't

[36:29] know the entire management teams I look I if I were to guess I mean George is pretty young and

[36:33] vibrant every time I see George he's in good shape I think he's going to be around for a long time

[36:38] but they've got they've got Mr. Sharp over there who could be you know if I'm looking at the

[36:43] the chain of command that could learn how to like be the next captain of the Stern ship

[36:50] I think they could find someone young to to take the reins and Gary's probably not doing anything

[36:57] other than cash and checks I mean I don't think he has really many management decisions I think

[37:04] if he's doing one thing he's just making sure that everyone sticks to the to the to the build of

[37:10] materials to make sure the investors are are making their their profit margin now to your earlier

[37:17] point about baking in incentives right for designers and for artists to make the best possible

[37:24] I think that's a great idea but if I'm Gary I'm probably like why like where are they going to go

[37:30] who are they going to go work for you know you kind of got these guys by the balls a little bit

[37:35] because at least if you work for Stern your game's going to come out like when you're still alive

[37:42] and it's yeah you know they have like they have they have the emotional appeal like you actually

[37:48] can come into Stern every day and do something and be around people that are actually making pinball

[37:54] how many times have we seen images of the Jersey Jack factory where there's like nobody doing

[38:00] anything it seems like kind of like a boring place to walk into every day where Stern feels like

[38:06] the best culture imaginable if you want to work in pinball now that's a good point let me just

[38:12] let me ask you just shifting for a second from a competitive standpoint how aggressive do you

[38:19] think Stern needs to be unlocking up a bunch of licenses very aggressive and I think they are I

[38:26] think they they probably have licenses locked for the next I would say three to five years and

[38:36] they'll probably you know I know a license might be like a three year time period but they'll just

[38:40] renew it right right right but you think like I don't really know what a license will cost for

[38:48] pinball like neither of us do right but you know do you think just purely from a competitive standpoint

[38:53] do you think like 2019 because there's increased competition it would make sense to just lock up

[38:58] a bunch of licenses just to prevent others from grabbing them absolutely okay we when we hear

[39:05] rumors like someone has the Pulp Fiction license someone has this license I tend to believe that

[39:12] it's probably Stern that has a lot of those licenses locked up so JAWS is a good example the rumor

[39:19] that they have the JAWS license we've been hearing JAWS as a rumored pin now for a few years

[39:25] and you know I can only imagine on the on a wall somewhere at Stern is every single title that's

[39:34] mapped out at least to 20 probably 22 yeah yeah aren't these a year to a year and a half especially on

[39:43] some of the the cornerstone titles on these games so I think they they have a ton now we know that

[39:53] deep route has been aggressively going after stuff like 80s properties and popular licenses and

[40:00] was able to secure some of those as well so it's definitely got to be it's interesting I don't

[40:05] know how that works right it's it's can a company like deep route go to a to an IP holder and say

[40:12] look we'll make your game next year you know Stern's been holding on to this license for three years

[40:18] wouldn't you like can we figure out you know a way to to take it from them and give it to us I don't

[40:25] know I mean I think you have a way to the time expires but there might be an opportunity to get an

[40:31] IP holder to not renew with Stern if they're just sitting on it for for just competitive advantage

[40:37] yeah it's a great point it's a great point I would love just one last comment on license

[40:43] I'd love to understand the Kapow relationship like why are some titles licensed by Kapow and why

[40:50] are some licensed by Stern like we'll never know but like I'm curious how the Kapow can work

[40:56] what thing Joe through Kapow I believe that Joe has a lot of relationships with IPs based upon

[41:05] machines he makes with I believe they're coin-opt machines or slot machines so Kapow has existing

[41:14] relationships with IP holders in other things that Joe puts together now Joe's sort of like a

[41:20] a licensing kingpin out in the licensing world where he knows a lot of people so it's to his

[41:27] benefit to be that sort of middleman in creating deals and partnerships between IPs and manufacturers

[41:34] of products so I think that's where that comes from and I think he brings a lot of IP to the table

[41:40] that Stern wouldn't be able to maybe do as effectively or as efficiently if they weren't with him

[41:48] and so I think Batman was a good example of that and obviously Beatles most recently

[41:54] yeah that makes sense right right it's funny that a lot of those licenses like you can't even

[41:58] get a meeting with them so I think it's a good point like Joe because he's in the industry

[42:04] must be able to open doors to turn gingerly camp right right oh okay so in terms of

[42:11] anyone there's other like marketing things that you're I'm looking at you're incredibly detailed

[42:16] notes David like I think when if I look at Stern marketing from just an overall standpoint I do think

[42:22] they do a phenomenal job in in terms of pinball marketing because as I always say on this show

[42:29] the most important thing you can do when you're marketing a non-essential toy is close the

[42:37] window between reveal and shipping the more you give people time to think about it the more time

[42:44] they will probably bail on buying it immediately but if they know they can get it in a month or two

[42:53] you will get far more sales and I think that is the most important marketing lesson that every

[42:58] other manufacturer falls down on is there in such a rush to look like big shots at these I believe

[43:06] totally unimportant pinball shows they'd rather be at these shows and and be signing autographs

[43:13] and reveal something way too early and then it completely hurts their sales of their product

[43:22] yeah like cool check you were you were the man at tpf cool nine months ago where's your game still not

[43:28] out yeah I don't know why yeah I don't know why anyone releases a chose at all like it doesn't make

[43:34] any sense and Stern doesn't if you look at Stern's releases they always do it normally around the

[43:42] shows I mean they didn't they didn't release it expo they didn't release anything at tpf what they

[43:48] utilize the shows for and they're smart it's better to have your game already on the line shipping

[43:55] the people and then when the show comes then you bring Eddie Munster up there with his Munster's

[44:01] cars and you sign translates and you get people coming to that show to order the game from your

[44:07] distributor at that show and guess what then their games shipping to them that week that's how you

[44:13] sell a pinball machine they're smart yeah yeah you're right we'll see how deep rude panels it right

[44:22] they they they've learned well that lesson is well known it'll be sure to see who follows it right

[44:29] okay so I think Stern does so much right I a few other things sales and marketing I saw they just

[44:35] updated their website it's brand new I don't really like it that's a very subjective thing

[44:44] I don't think it does a great job of capturing like a like a pinball company and getting

[44:50] me excited and hyped to play pinball but that's just me I also think Stern could do so much more

[44:57] on social media and so much more on YouTube in terms of putting content out there that would make

[45:03] people want to buy their products and if I had one wish for them from a marketing standpoint it

[45:10] would just be to tell the story behind these games in a better way I'm during the reveal months of

[45:17] the machine I think they sort of do the same formulaic launch every time with like an IGN or

[45:24] someone and then there's it's always like low res images for the first 48 hours on pinside and why

[45:32] why can't we just get you know the designers out there telling the story high res images of the game

[45:41] again I I say this Dave as if they don't sell out immediately with game site unseen because it's like

[45:47] what do they say these are weaknesses and things they could do better it's it's almost like doesn't

[45:51] even matter and they know that they could show us a a napkin drawing of jaws pinball machine

[45:59] Ellie and we would it would sell out immediately you're absolutely right yeah you're absolutely right

[46:06] you're right to suggest that I think like the Olympics in particular is really good about

[46:12] sort of telling these stories about the athletes that get you sort of emotionally and ball

[46:18] and there's an opportunity there for the fans but you're also right like it doesn't matter like you're

[46:23] solving a problem they don't have but they do have a problem that their buyer demographic is aging

[46:31] quickly and there there is not a new generation coming in right but anyway now let me we got

[46:38] some more interesting things to talk about with Stern so should we do this because I I this is

[46:43] this always happens with podcasting we're at the 45 minute mark yeah should we just do a Stern

[46:49] deep dive and and then just do a different episode on each manufacturer I think that sounds great

[46:56] let's do that because I don't want to leave out some of this stuff because I think it's really

[46:59] interesting to talk about and I also would love to have you come back on and we can we can do the

[47:03] same sort of analysis of everyone and and and and do it like one at a time and I think the listeners

[47:08] would enjoy that that sounds great Chris I one thing if you're up for it um I would love to hear

[47:17] your take on Stern sort of partnering with more boutique brand right like so the work with Supreme

[47:24] and I know a lot of folks didn't like it I thought it was really clever like are there other brands

[47:31] you think that they could partner with that would help sort of expand the market or or test

[47:36] you know getting additional buyers and do you think there's any low hanging fruit there

[47:40] well I think the opportunity for boutique and and I think I think supreme was was a genius partnership

[47:47] but I think what that does is it creates a really unique product for that other fan base so

[47:56] Supreme fans love that game pinball fans hate it so if you were to ask me does that expand the

[48:05] pinball market I don't really think so I think what that does is I think it it creates a halo item

[48:11] for Supreme collectors but I don't think that person then is going to be turned on to other

[48:17] pinball games because of that they're not going to want you know fill the room with there's a

[48:22] second pinball machine they're going to want to put that thing next to their Louis Vuitton

[48:25] Supreme bag and their Supreme Boxing bag and their Supreme bed spread you know it's like that's

[48:31] what that person wants now that being said I do think it helps from a PR and awareness standpoint

[48:40] of pinball so to articulate that when Stern did the partnership with Supreme they got more people

[48:48] just thinking about pinball in in the modern day then all of the other Stern reveals an

[48:56] announcement over the last probably 10 years if you add up all the news stories and the views

[49:01] to the video and the commentary more people because millions of people are into Supreme and not

[49:08] that many people are as into like new pinball games so maybe not 10 years but they they literally

[49:15] used another hot property to also you know show people that pinball still alive and well so I think

[49:21] there's a lot of maybe ancillary sort of interest that might develop from that

[49:28] but I do think there's obviously a lot more boutique opportunities I do go to fashion a lot

[49:33] because I think there are other fashion houses that could create boutique pinball games and I

[49:38] can just see like the kinds of dudes that are on pinside would cringe if they heard like

[49:43] you can make a Gucci pinball machine and sell one and use Gucci store around the world and

[49:48] let me tell you something they would sell but people you know and and again people in pinball

[49:54] sometimes don't want to see the outside world but the Gucci brand is now an eight billion dollar

[50:01] like brand pinball companies worth that I know Neiman markets that the department store has like

[50:10] in a very exclusive super extensive version of basically the sharp rate of image catalogs that

[50:17] comes up during the holidays like hey here's all this exclusive stuff that's really high in brand

[50:24] that's where the Beatles Diamond Edition should be in I mean they sell the highest end version

[50:30] of something so if there's a $25,000 or Beatles pinball machine that sort of makes perfect

[50:36] sense to be in Neiman markets is holiday gift guide right so there's definitely an example there's

[50:41] definitely opportunity for more boutique stuff what I would like to see though is if you're going

[50:47] to go boutique that the games are somewhat original what I what I what I think is disappointing

[50:54] is when the boutique games just become reskins of stuff we've already seen before

[51:01] because then you completely turn off the pinball enthusiasts to that new boutique pinball game

[51:09] and we're seeing that with primus right it's just like you're layering on top of a mediocre game

[51:14] that we've already had two examples of another you know another license and so will that work

[51:24] and the primus is a good you know the primus game is I think a good example day of of a boutique

[51:30] game being made will that work do you think they're going to sell all 100 primus machines

[51:36] yeah I do and I think you know sell all the primus right like so they have a hundred right but

[51:42] you think yeah do you think then primus will be able to sell them to primus fans yeah I do I do

[51:49] I do I I I think I hundred the right now but yeah I do I do but I actually if you don't mind I

[51:58] actually disagree with you on this point or I want to challenge you a little bit on this question

[52:03] like I actually think re-seaming an existing design actually does make sense for the boutique only

[52:10] because you're never going to get the pinball fan anyway and like you actually don't care about

[52:16] the pinball fan like the whole point is to kind of pass are there other buyers outside of that fan

[52:22] and to incur all the R&D costs of like coming up with a new game to kind of invest in the test

[52:29] like is this a good channel actually think it's kind of smart to like to skin stuff because it's a

[52:34] really low cost test of like you know will this work like will this bring in more people yet to know

[52:41] and so really some a bit absolutely I'm sure I you're right I mean you're right I mean that is why

[52:49] supreme re-skin spider-man the pin right I mean that's what that's a risk in of

[52:55] is that is that that was the re-skin right of the of the basic spider-man game they came out with

[53:00] I believe so yeah right I believe so yeah yeah yeah I mean I guess the thing is this is

[53:06] making a boutique pin like basically it's a stern is being asked to contract manufacturer

[53:12] a pinball machine for another you know entity that's not designed for the the typical pinball buyer

[53:19] it makes total business sense for them to do that right so you know what would be exciting

[53:26] imagine if we got a boutique company to re-skin dialed in right like take a game where the theme

[53:36] was shit but the game was incredible all the R&Ds done yeah let me let me ask is a buyer let's

[53:45] pretend you as a buyer if jerky jack was like great news we've got wonka and it's dialed in with

[53:52] the wonka theme like would you care would you buy that yeah it's a great question it's a great

[54:01] question and you you know I think we all have been expecting to see some sort of jack going

[54:06] back to the parts been right because he's not these games haven't sold at the levels they probably

[54:11] thought but would I buy it you know I have to say no right and I'll and I'll say why because

[54:21] it's just too soon I mean it's a good question about what's the shelf life of a design before

[54:27] you can go back to the well again when you're trying to attract the pinball enthusiast

[54:34] right because you could yeah you know because the well okay let's let's but it's a dilemma right

[54:39] because dialed in is such a good shooting game with such a poor theme now here's why I also wouldn't

[54:46] and this is just me and maybe I'm a little bit of a hypocrite here I do think when you're starting

[54:54] to design a pinball game and you know what the world is you want to create under glass that from a

[55:01] blank piece of wood you should start to create the willy wanker universe there isn't and if you

[55:07] if you've already inherited an entire design that was meant to be something else it will always feel

[55:14] like a compromise always and I know Stern got around that a little bit with Batman because it was

[55:19] an older Batman game but I also criticized Batman 66 and I still do that that game wasn't designed

[55:27] from the ground up to bring the Adam West Batman world to life like there's there's a crane in

[55:33] it for no reason whatsoever there's no crane in Batman 66 show or movie so would you buy it

[55:43] I wouldn't but you know what I might buy if they if they took pirates and I agree with you in that

[55:51] like no one wants that IP today but if they seemed it as the pirates ride from Disneyland I might

[56:00] actually be pretty interested in that right like with that old mark day for sure like something

[56:06] like that where it's like it still makes sense within the layout and it's a theme that like there's

[56:14] old mark data designs of the Disneyland rides are pretty cool and like actually might buy a pirate

[56:22] themed Jersey Jack if they were they ride they definitely don't want the movie version well you know

[56:30] and Dave I mean people are saying that about the game they're almost starting to say well without

[56:35] all the clips from the movies it just feels like a fun pirate ride versus a game based on all those

[56:44] properties right from the film I I agree like pirates is just a generic theme or based on the ride

[56:51] and then the pirates life for me song and all the fun and campiness that goes along with that ride

[56:56] is a perfect theme for pinball I I just never would have made it the way they did it the the

[57:03] asset limitation would just would have been dead on the you know within the creative boardroom that

[57:09] that title would have been dead for me right away once once I got the news that I couldn't use

[57:14] a theme song I couldn't use any clips I couldn't use any voice actors except for like one no Johnny

[57:19] depth the the protagonists of the entire film franchise I can't use anything no

[57:25] all right so let's go we have a few more things with Stern we have sort of operations we want to

[57:32] talk about a little bit right where where we are on our list here so pricing and distribution

[57:38] we want to talk pricing a little bit with Stern sure sure so you know I do think they're in

[57:47] a unique position to because they are the lead manufacturer they do have the ability to experiment

[57:54] with prices like what are the light what are the right additions what are the price points like how

[57:59] do we price it what's yeah how do we deal through the distribution channels I actually think I know

[58:05] it drives fans and collectors crazy but I actually do think it makes sense for them to continue

[58:12] to experiment both to find like how high does the height go and potentially even like

[58:22] introduce some lower end cheaper models to see if that brings in new fans and I guess the

[58:30] ball condition is sort of that but like I actually think it's smart of them certainly as a market

[58:37] we have a lot of leeway to continue to experiment and see what the market can bear like I think

[58:43] that's fine and I think 2019 I'm in charge of their pricing like I was continuing to just test

[58:49] stuff out and see you know push on the high end push on the low end and see where it goes but

[58:55] I don't know what do you think I mean we're living in that error with them right now right I mean

[59:01] they're now selling as much as it's being positioned as like the distributor selling it they're now

[59:08] testing out to see if a twenty five thousand dollar Beatles machine will sell right they're also

[59:15] testing out the twelve thousand five hundred dollar platinum edition of that game and then the

[59:21] eight thousand dollar gold edition so Stern has continued I think to test the waters and I think

[59:27] what Stern does so geniusly is they basically have figured out how to sell us what I believe to be

[59:37] a Stern pro from circa two thousand seven two thousand eight because remember before they

[59:44] there was no early premium or pro back in like the Lord the Rings when it first came out or the

[59:49] Simpsons pinball right look at some of those games and those games nowadays would be looked at

[59:57] as like super limited collector platinum diamond editions if they came out today from Stern right if

[01:00:03] you look at all that was in them yeah I think what they've done geniusly if they they've they've literally

[01:00:10] figured out a way to sell you what was once their basic product now as a high end limited edition

[01:00:18] game and then they removed from there to the point where I mean we could talk about how much we think

[01:00:25] it's cost to make a Stern machine but I think somewhere they're out the cost to produce one of

[01:00:28] these games is around like two to three thousand dollars and everything above a pro is it's just

[01:00:34] all gravy for them I think where they could charge even more though and this is where I think

[01:00:40] there's still not we haven't seen the ceiling yet it all comes down to supply and demand for them

[01:00:48] and I'll give an example and I've said this before if if they only made 100 jaws super limited

[01:00:56] edition games and there was an extra feature and extra modes in that game they could charge

[01:01:03] twenty thousand dollars and sell every one I mean I just it literally like they would sell but we're

[01:01:10] yeah but here's what what I don't like about what they're doing now is they're charging more for

[01:01:15] these games and they're pushing the price up with nothing more than rarity there's nothing in the

[01:01:23] game that's special there's not even an additional code in these high end games like Beatles

[01:01:30] diamond edition doesn't come with an extra song it doesn't come with an extra feature it comes with

[01:01:37] nothing extra it doesn't I don't think it comes with better speakers yeah it doesn't even come

[01:01:43] I don't need to come with a shaker motor right and so it's like that's my issue is they're pushing

[01:01:50] up the price ceiling without adding any value to the games and that makes me feel like they're just

[01:01:58] trying to they're not trying to see how great they can make a pinball game they're trying to see

[01:02:03] how big of a sucker we are before we call time out and demand more in the game for that kind of

[01:02:10] price I totally agree but that I mean that is one of the hallmarks of a shrinking market right when

[01:02:19] you have a shrinking market one of the things you do is you just try to extract more and more value

[01:02:25] out of that shrinking market and I think that's what we're witnessing right and it works and it's

[01:02:31] okay for a while until the market says uncle and they give up but I think you're absolutely right

[01:02:38] um on all points like it but is it not but is it shrinking or I mean is stern see that's

[01:02:45] thing we don't have the numbers so I don't know if stern sales in 2018 were the best ever right I don't

[01:02:50] we don't know we don't I mean there has been some research you can buy on the web there's a website

[01:02:58] called statistic I want to say that that claims to show the total size of the pinball market

[01:03:06] over I think it's a 10 year span ending in 2015 I want to say so and it shows the market sort of

[01:03:16] being sort of diminishing like 10% over year and then being right around like $230 million in

[01:03:26] 2015 I want to say memory serves so who knows like who knows if that's accurate or not but like

[01:03:33] if we even just pretend the market is 200 million and we say the average price of a game sold is

[01:03:41] 5k that's basically 40,000 machine sold in a year like do you think that sounds about right 40,000

[01:03:52] in total across the industry no way yep no way too low no too high like new machines oh too hot 40,000

[01:04:01] yeah I mean well why well think about like this if there's just no okay so it's a good stern title

[01:04:11] nowadays like what do you think sells like in total not premium pro early I'll say on average like

[01:04:21] 7k maybe see I think you're I think it's way high I think a good stern title now is 2 to 3

[01:04:30] thousand units a blockbuster is like a Metallica like 5,000 units or ACDC but again that's over a

[01:04:39] period of years I think in one year stern is selling like 2 to 3,000 of a blockbuster title and then

[01:04:48] sales have to really slow down in years 2 and 3 of that title right so let's say they have three

[01:04:54] cornerstone titles let's just say for for hypothetical sake let's just give them the benefit of doubt

[01:04:59] they sell 4,000 of each of their cornerstones right so that's 12,000 games in their cornerstone titles

[01:05:08] even if we lob in another 10,000 for their other titles that's 22,000 there right

[01:05:16] and they have 90% of the market yeah you're right yeah you're right I mean it just goes to show you

[01:05:24] how it smells like it's really tiny but um well let me ask you this Chris like to your point like

[01:05:35] stern is definitely experimenting with upsells right like they've always you've had the shaker

[01:05:40] motor upsell you've mentioned like play field protectors are really obvious choice do you think

[01:05:48] stern people would hate this but do you think that they could do an upsell around maintenance and

[01:05:57] support kind of like a stern care type of thing kind of deal yeah like like an apple you know

[01:06:03] apple care could think and I'll ask you the other question what if they charge for updates after

[01:06:11] a certain point like you can get the bad man 66 updates for free up to 1.0 but we're going to

[01:06:18] kind of keep innovating and anything above that requires a subscription if they had a pedigree

[01:06:24] of always giving people final product without bugs they could do that but because they have such a

[01:06:31] history of giving people games that are half built when it comes to code they would get they would

[01:06:40] they would burn the stern factory down if they tried to do that now what I think they could do

[01:06:45] I do think they could sell you an entirely new or like code experience with your game it would

[01:06:54] have to be very significant and and I think people should pay for it once your past the point

[01:07:00] where like the game is done right because once you're done and games are sold and everyone's happy

[01:07:05] with like Metallica right everyone's happy with walking dead if lineman went and added in all

[01:07:11] new walking dead experience for a hundred bucks or 250 bucks who's not buying that everybody is

[01:07:20] yes and why shouldn't we pay for his additional time when the game's already been done it's

[01:07:24] and we see DLC content is what drives the video game world but it only works if you actually give

[01:07:32] people a working game to begin with but it's also like another thing too it's like

[01:07:43] you've bought this 350 pound you know physical thing that the only reason you'll get bored of it

[01:07:51] is because you might be bored of the code after a while right you get bored doing the same stuff

[01:07:56] you want to see new light shows new modes new music you could add all that in and make that

[01:08:01] experience somewhat new again I do think we're going to see deep root experiment with that

[01:08:08] I think smart I mean I think it's a great idea and you're right like it's really well-trug

[01:08:12] ground with video games right but those expansion packs they do really well and you know it is a crime

[01:08:20] that these devices are not internet enabled just to download the patch and like get auto update

[01:08:27] right kind of stupid but I guess people might think about it like this though I buy a video game for

[01:08:34] 60 bucks I don't have a problem buying DLC content when I pay five to 25 thousand dollars for

[01:08:42] pinball machine I don't don't ever go back in my wallet I gave you a ton already

[01:08:51] keep me happy and I'll buy your next game you know so so David just because I want to I want to

[01:08:55] make sure we don't go too long on on this podcast you had some final thoughts on on your 2019 plan

[01:09:03] for Stern pinball and what you think are strategic initiatives that they should do let's go through

[01:09:07] that list and then I'll I'll give my point of view and and then and then we'll do this again real

[01:09:12] soon and go on to Jersey Jack pinball I'll add a later date how's that sound that sounds great all right

[01:09:18] sounds great oh I'll get it really quick I think you know if I were at Stern ticket about 2019 I

[01:09:24] would think about three things one I do think it's a year to shore up the competitive defensive

[01:09:31] right there will be increased competition in the market how successfully are who knows but it

[01:09:37] is a lot noisier and more crowded so I do think 2019 is a time to shore up your defense which is

[01:09:44] potentially introducing an employee bonus plan to support coaching increase investment in the

[01:09:52] channel partners both in terms of the marketing materials but also your relationship um

[01:09:59] perhaps get aggressive to your point I'm locking up there's top-tier licenses um and then

[01:10:04] it might be interesting to showcase the value of their own intellectual property to your point

[01:10:09] there may not be a lot there but those are all things they can do to kind of increase their

[01:10:14] competitive defensiveness I think the second thing is invest in next generation of talent co-op

[01:10:21] program with a local university expanding the pool of contract visual designers potentially audit

[01:10:27] where they have holes in their second-tier of management like those would all be smart things

[01:10:32] and then the last I would I feel strongly like as the market leader um 2019 is a great time to invest

[01:10:40] in expanding or at least attempting to expand the overall market right and so potentially do some

[01:10:48] PR programs around you know millennials are shifting back to analog like they love records they love

[01:10:54] building stuff they love beers now they love tingles um that could be interesting um you put

[01:11:00] food my movie theater partnerships so I don't know maybe there's some other retail play there um

[01:11:07] and then yeah I do actually think it makes sense to experiment with a bunch of brands right like

[01:11:12] supreme less equis smart and you know if you do something with vans you do something with some

[01:11:17] high-end brands you try to get it in the new market catalog like I think the name of the game is

[01:11:23] like quick low-cost experiment to just see what sticks and I think 2019 is a good year to kind

[01:11:30] of cast how to expand the market and just experiment so I'll be with that yeah no I think those

[01:11:36] are all really good ideas you know I actually had this interesting PR idea for Stern to get them

[01:11:44] press get young people excited about playing pinball and learning how to play pinball so I'll

[01:11:48] give it to you real quickly the number one and I always try to come up with creative ideas that are

[01:11:53] built around a cultural insight the number one issue facing all college students and young people

[01:11:58] today is our student loan debts all right it is it is crippling young people it it puts them

[01:12:06] uh in financial turmoil and for years and it's in the trillions of dollars in America

[01:12:13] people get scholarships to colleges all the time because of a skill set there is never in the history

[01:12:21] of academia ever been anyone who ever had a scholarship because they were good at pinball right

[01:12:28] we're now seeing people give scholarships for video game players and and professional

[01:12:33] coders and engineers for gaming imagine if Stern pinball said we are going to give someone a

[01:12:39] full ride to school whoever is the best pinball player in the country and you do a tournament

[01:12:45] from 16 to 18 year olds and whoever is number one can get a free ride because of the silver ball

[01:12:52] and you would see so many young people learn how to play it would also be great because all of the

[01:12:58] old cram muggins that smell bad and playing leagues every week wouldn't be eligible to be the face

[01:13:04] of the of pinball you you'd actually force people who don't normally play it to learn how to play

[01:13:09] which would be great again I would think about creative ways to get media and young people excited

[01:13:15] and thinking about playing pinball because I do agree I think culturally there's a shift back to

[01:13:20] to analog um I think these are all really good strategic initiatives for Stern I don't think

[01:13:27] the whole bonus thing would would be in Gary's best interest because again I think they provide

[01:13:33] something that is impossible to find elsewhere for everyone who works at Stern they provide a career

[01:13:41] in pinball that I don't think any other company would provide as good of an experience as Stern would

[01:13:48] and if I was going to apply to work for a pinball company I would start with the best and they are

[01:13:54] the best I mean like and I you know I think too is because we don't hear from so many of the people

[01:13:59] over at Stern we don't you can tell they're having fun it's fun when you're winning in business right

[01:14:06] I mean it's fun when you're leading the market it it can't be fun to be a challenger brand but I

[01:14:12] don't get the sense that like it's as much fun to be over at Jersey Jack these days I'm I when

[01:14:20] they do videos it's always like I don't know just there's not the same level of like excitement and

[01:14:26] hype I think one thing Stern could do if they really wanted to increase their sales would be to

[01:14:32] lift their ban on Canadian pinball podcasts and actually join the show and sell to my listener

[01:14:39] business now I'm joking I think those are all really great opportunities any final closing

[01:14:46] thoughts on on on Stern pinball I just think they're gonna have a great year they're gonna have a

[01:14:52] great 20 right I agree I think Stern's gonna have a phenomenon here what I do what excites me

[01:14:58] about Stern in 2019 is that we don't know what's coming from them and I think their ability to keep

[01:15:03] people curious I think that creates hype and I think they are the only pinball company that

[01:15:10] understands the importance of generating hype to get people to buy these expensive toys nobody needs

[01:15:17] I think their biggest weakness is the lack of magic on the physical play field and I they're

[01:15:24] able to get away with it because everyone else who tries to to make something better has fumbled

[01:15:32] getting their games to market and and so Stern has been able to just probably just laugh at everyone

[01:15:38] else's attempt to do what they do and I think their biggest vulnerabilities just more in the high

[01:15:44] end premium market I know and can touch them in the five to six thousand dollar range in new

[01:15:49] inbox nobody true yeah locked true and also yeah so exciting year though for Stern definitely will

[01:15:56] be a great year for them and Dave CEO Dave you are a real CEO thank you for coming on the show

[01:16:04] we're gonna do this again we can probably maybe get Jersey Jack and spooky together I think Stern

[01:16:09] for obvious reasons takes up so much of the discussion because they are the biggest

[01:16:15] yeah I had to go to church but thanks for let me come on and your show is great and I really

[01:16:22] appreciate you know all the work you put into it so thank you for putting it on

[01:16:26] I you know I'm happy that you listen and I think that this show is meant to entertain and

[01:16:35] and Dave I think you've you've educated people which is also good because I think sometimes my

[01:16:41] pendulum swings more towards entertainment than education so we'll we'll keep it going this is

[01:16:46] the first of many that we will do a CEO Dave so we have a new returning guest ladies and gentlemen

[01:16:51] on the show and for those of you out there if you have an interesting thing to add to the show just

[01:16:55] email me a canada pinball at gmail.com and we will maybe get you on the show one day soon everyone

[01:17:02] have a great night thank you Dave thank you
