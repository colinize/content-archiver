[00:00] Why can't you do it? Why can't you set your mind?

[00:04] Get free, move, get up and then do it.

[00:07] Get out of the mug, get out of the mug, get out of the mug.

[00:09] I do it this way.

[00:10] What?

[00:11] What?

[00:12] What?

[00:13] What?

[00:14] What?

[00:15] What?

[00:16] Just when I think I'm done doing pinball podcasts for the week, you pull me back in people

[00:23] with some new topic everyone is discussing.

[00:27] This episode of Canadian pinball podcast, which we're calling Monkey Business, we're going

[00:32] to talk about a very controversial piece of artwork that is on the October Fest pinball

[00:39] machine.

[00:40] We also have exclusively for you on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast exactly how

[00:49] Beatles pricing is going to roll out.

[00:53] I got some news late last night on how this is going to transpire.

[00:57] We're going to talk about that before we do the Monkey Business, before we talk about

[01:02] it, let's do a quick recap of what's going on in the pinball world.

[01:07] Pirates of the Caribbean pinball machines are making their way to customers.

[01:11] I am happy to see people finally unboxing this game.

[01:14] We're almost into November.

[01:17] I don't think I've seen more than maybe 20 unboxings.

[01:21] It's going to be exciting to finally get this game out there.

[01:26] My invitation to Zach many to come on the show to talk about why we should give Pirates a

[01:35] second look is still an open invitation.

[01:38] I haven't heard back from Zach.

[01:40] I hope you come on the show.

[01:42] I hope you come on.

[01:44] We also haven't heard back from Crazy Levy, but we will probably never hear back from Crazy

[01:48] Levy.

[01:49] All right.

[01:50] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[01:52] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[01:54] That game is also finally starting to trickle out.

[01:59] I think the word of this week is that they are in the low teens or within the teens of production

[02:07] of that game, which is good.

[02:10] It's finally getting out the door.

[02:13] You know who really wants this game to get out there?

[02:16] People in Europe who are interested in the title, because if you read the thread, these

[02:21] people have no chance to play one of these games at a US show.

[02:26] They have to rely heavily on good review videos from people in the States.

[02:33] We look forward to more and more people getting their Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[02:38] The weight has been really, really long.

[02:40] I know that Spooky and Co are anxious to get this title off the ground.

[02:44] All right.

[02:45] I also got hit up yesterday from a friendly distributor who shall remain nameless and said,

[02:54] Monster Bash Ellie is sold out, Chris.

[02:57] Not just the first allotment, all allotments of Monster Bash Ellie are sold out.

[03:03] Do you believe that 1,250 Monster Bash is sold within two weeks of their reveal, not even

[03:11] two weeks?

[03:12] If that is the case, then awesome.

[03:17] Awesome.

[03:18] I've heard nothing but good things about these games.

[03:21] I still don't think like they're sold out, sold out.

[03:23] I still think you're going to be able to get one for a while.

[03:26] I do.

[03:27] I don't think this can be the total amount that they're ever going to make.

[03:32] But maybe I'm wrong.

[03:33] But look, I have not heard one single bad thing about Monster Bash Remake.

[03:39] Speaking of monkey business, we're going to get to it in a little bit.

[03:42] But I actually just saw that American Pimball posted a response to all the monkey business

[03:46] debate that has been going on on Pinside.

[03:51] So let's see.

[03:52] Anything else that I'm missing?

[03:53] I got Jersey Jack.

[03:54] I got Spooky.

[03:56] Stern Pimball.

[03:57] Let's see.

[03:58] Beatles.

[03:59] We're going to talk about the pricing.

[04:01] We know Monster's is coming in a couple of weeks.

[04:03] Nothing new in the Stern world.

[04:05] Otherwise.

[04:06] Anything I'm missing?

[04:07] Nothing new from Dutch.

[04:09] Nothing new from highway.

[04:10] Nothing new from everyone else.

[04:11] All right.

[04:12] Let's jump right into monkey business.

[04:15] So for those of you who aren't aware, it seems that on the back glass of October Fest,

[04:23] there is a very controversial thing going on.

[04:27] There is a monkey who apparently comes from the Houdini game who makes a comic appearance

[04:33] in October Fest.

[04:34] There is a monkey on the back glass who has one hand on one girl's butt, which is his

[04:42] left hand and his right hand up another girl's skirt.

[04:46] And this has been pointed out by many people as being a completely inappropriate thing to

[04:54] put on a Pimball machine in 2018.

[04:58] And you could even argue on any machine ever.

[05:02] And I want to talk about the reactions to this.

[05:05] I want to give my opinions about this and about what I'm reading in people's reactions.

[05:12] Now look, it's hard to really dive into something like this because there are a lot of different

[05:20] opinions about this.

[05:23] And one thing we all can admit is that Pimball is predominantly a male hobby.

[05:33] Okay.

[05:34] This is not me being sexist.

[05:35] I'm not making this up.

[05:36] If I were just statistically look at the breakdown and the demographic of Pimball, both

[05:43] from the collector standpoint, both from the player standpoint, you would notice a humongous

[05:51] portion of the fan base is male.

[05:54] I would even say probably 95% of all Pimball players and collectors are men.

[06:05] Okay.

[06:06] Go to a show.

[06:07] I know that family's go to shows.

[06:08] But for the most part, it's a very, very, very heavily skewed towards men.

[06:12] I think if you look at the demographic who buys Pimball machines, like actually goes

[06:17] out and buys a machine.

[06:20] I would think you're looking at even north of 95% of Pimball purchases happen by men.

[06:27] Now that being said, that does not mean that there is not a huge, not huge, but that there's

[06:35] not a very nice female community in the hobby.

[06:39] We see a lot of female leagues.

[06:41] We see a lot of female tournament players.

[06:43] We see a lot of female players at home.

[06:46] Whether they're people's daughters or wives or sisters, women like to play Pimball

[06:52] too.

[06:53] It is a very universally approachable toy and game.

[06:58] You could even say a sport.

[07:00] There's absolutely nothing that separates men or women from the physical ability to play

[07:04] a Pimball machine.

[07:07] I think most people out there do want Pimball to be approachable to both sexes.

[07:16] I would also say that when you see stuff like this, it's hard not to react and share

[07:24] your opinions about it.

[07:27] I've seen people say stuff like this is completely sexual harassment.

[07:32] It's disgusting.

[07:33] American Pimball should be ashamed of themselves for putting this on the back glass.

[07:39] I've seen people say, what are you talking about?

[07:42] I'd say cartoon monkey on a cartoon back glass touching a cartoon character's butt.

[07:48] It's just meant to be a joke light and up already.

[07:51] I would say those are the extreme ends of the spectrum.

[07:56] I think you also see people who come in somewhat in the middle and say, look, I'm not heavily

[08:03] offended by this.

[08:05] I just don't understand why they did it.

[08:07] It looks really tone deaf and it just absolutely adds nothing of value to the experience of the

[08:15] game.

[08:16] Personally, I fall somewhat in the middle.

[08:21] I don't look at this and say, oh my god, these guys are completely the biggest tone

[08:26] deaf morons to do this.

[08:28] I also think it's completely stupid to do it.

[08:32] I don't understand why you would do it.

[08:36] It can be taken and I understand why it's taken as an offensive thing to see on a Pimball

[08:43] machine.

[08:44] Here's why it's offensive because I don't buy the argument that it's just a cartoon monkey

[08:48] touching cartoon buttocks.

[08:51] Here's why it's a little creepy and here's why it is offensive because we know that it

[08:57] was some middle-aged dude doing the art design who stuck it there.

[09:04] That is objectifying women and it is putting something on there that makes it seem okay

[09:13] to go up to a woman and do some monkey business like grab their butt.

[09:18] Look, we just don't live in a world anymore where that is acceptable.

[09:24] That should never have been acceptable.

[09:27] If you think that's funny and you think it's okay to go up and approach a woman or touch

[09:32] a woman without her permission, you are in for a rude awakening.

[09:37] I think the other thing too is if you look at it, the theory is my thing though.

[09:42] I didn't even notice it because there were so many other glaring artistic mistakes on

[09:47] October Fest that I completely missed this thing.

[09:52] There was so much going on, like I said, it's just wears Waldo artwork package with so

[09:56] many inconsistent art designs that I completely missed this whole thing.

[10:02] It's weird too because you've got this monkey touching these women and then you look

[10:05] at them and they look so wooden and frozen and it doesn't even look like they're feeling

[10:12] what the monkey is doing.

[10:14] The whole thing to me just feels sterile and off and like the art package and all the

[10:21] things going on, the characters, all of it lacks any sort of substance to me.

[10:26] That's why I just completely missed it.

[10:29] Now look, I want to read for you now American Pimball's response because I know there's

[10:34] rumors they were going to remove it but actually normal just responded on their Facebook page

[10:41] and I want to read word for word what he says.

[10:44] He says, as a company, American Pimball strives to create a fun product that

[10:51] the community can collectively enjoy.

[10:54] Since yesterday, members of the Pimball community have given feedback that the artwork on our

[10:59] October Fest backlash may come across as insensitive and offensive.

[11:05] This was never our intention.

[11:07] October Fest is meant to be fun, festive and inclusive.

[11:12] In that spirit, we are going to alter the backlash art to reflect the family, friendly aspects

[11:18] of October Fest.

[11:19] We strive to build our titles around.

[11:22] All right.

[11:23] On behalf of the company, I wish to personally apologize for any negativity that says create

[11:28] it.

[11:29] I realize we were in the wrong and we will make this right.

[11:33] If anyone has any further questions or comments about this, I'm always willing to listen.

[11:38] Please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

[11:41] Thank you for your continued support.

[11:42] All right.

[11:43] Cool.

[11:44] They're taking it off.

[11:45] As I'm concerned, it was a dumb move.

[11:48] They recognize it's a dumb move and they're removing it.

[11:51] Let's move on.

[11:52] Let's also forgive them for doing this.

[11:57] The notion of forgiveness in this modern world is one that is just evaporating.

[12:02] It's dissipating.

[12:03] We live in a very like one in done culture.

[12:06] You did something wrong.

[12:07] You're going to pay for it for the rest of your life no matter if you say you're sorry.

[12:11] This continues still to like impact me and come at me in different ways.

[12:16] I was totally wrong with my behavior at the New York City Pimbal Tournament.

[12:21] I've apologized to those involved who I knew.

[12:26] I offended and for those who I don't know if you were there, I'm sorry.

[12:30] I'm sorry.

[12:31] It was inappropriate behavior and it happened months ago and I wish it didn't happen and

[12:36] it won't happen again.

[12:38] But there are people that were there that will just never forgive me.

[12:41] No matter what I do, no matter what I say in their eyes, I will just always be that three

[12:46] to five minutes.

[12:49] I will always be that person in that time period.

[12:52] I get it.

[12:54] But look, if we live in a society where we don't forgive people and we don't have empathy

[13:01] for people who are trying to apologize and move on and do the right thing, I don't want

[13:06] to live in a world like that and I know you don't want to live in a world like that.

[13:10] Let's put this one past us.

[13:13] The only person we can't forgive is Keith Johnson for making the Pirates of Caribbean

[13:18] code.

[13:19] I'm kidding.

[13:20] I'm kidding.

[13:21] We forgive you, Keith.

[13:22] Just don't do it next time.

[13:23] Just don't do it.

[13:25] Speaking of Pirates of the Caribbean, there was a lot of back and forth.

[13:28] I posted the picture of the rule set of Pirates of the Caribbean and I basically just said

[13:34] no pinball machine should require memorization of something that looks like this and it created

[13:40] a nice debate about it.

[13:42] People are like, it's five games in one.

[13:44] I don't want five games in one.

[13:45] I just want one good game that I can understand.

[13:48] All right.

[13:49] All right.

[13:50] So, now that we've put monkey business behind us, let's talk about the Beatles and how

[13:55] Beatles pricing will work.

[13:58] Now we've been speculating a lot about how Stern is going to roll the Beatles out.

[14:04] I've seen people like sort of dancing around the specifics of it, but I have for you on

[14:10] this show a lot more detail as to how this whole thing will roll out and we're going to

[14:15] talk about it now and I want to talk about why I think Stern is doing it this way and

[14:21] whether or not I think it's a good move or not and ultimately whether or not it will be

[14:26] effective in driving sales of this game.

[14:30] So, I'm just pulling up.

[14:31] I want to read word for word what I know the approach will be for this game and I want

[14:38] to thank all the people out there that send Canadian information and tell me not to reveal

[14:44] the source because I won't.

[14:45] All right.

[14:46] So here's the deal.

[14:48] Stern will be selling two distributors, ten unit blocks.

[14:53] Okay, you have to buy ten units or ten games of the Beatles.

[14:59] You will get seven gold editions, you will get two platinum editions and you will get one

[15:06] diamond edition within that ten unit block.

[15:10] They will sell you that ten unit block for $70,000.

[15:17] They set the price on the golds.

[15:19] Okay, I think the golds are, I want to say the golds are $7,500.

[15:27] So their $75.99 will be the price of the golds, all right.

[15:31] Then the distributor does whatever they want with the platinum and diamond prices and you

[15:38] know there's 250 platinum and 100 diamonds at the end of the day.

[15:44] Okay.

[15:45] Here is the pricing I have received from one of the biggest Stern distributors out

[15:52] there.

[15:53] Are you ready for this?

[15:54] Are you sitting down?

[15:55] They are going to ask $7,599 for the gold, $12,500 for the platinum and $25,000 for the

[16:11] diamond edition game.

[16:13] All right.

[16:15] Now here we, okay, did you just spit your drink out?

[16:20] Did you just like laugh out loud?

[16:23] So here is how I want to talk about this.

[16:26] Here's my problem.

[16:28] There is no difference and I've talked to the people who made this game at Stern.

[16:33] There is no difference in this game at all between the $7,500 version and the $25,000

[16:44] version other than artwork.

[16:47] Let me repeat that.

[16:48] It is just a cosmetic thing.

[16:52] I don't even think it has upgraded speakers.

[16:58] I don't even think it has like upgraded armor.

[17:01] I don't even think it has like upgraded glass.

[17:05] I really think it's just the arts and that leads everyone to screw up.

[17:13] Gratch their head as to how in the world could you pay $17,000 more for something just

[17:25] because it has different artwork.

[17:28] Now, I literally, I've defended this game up to a point.

[17:34] But I also want to talk about that $25,000 price because remember, remember, all right.

[17:40] I need to step back and just, there's so many things in my head right now, right?

[17:43] I need to look at this a few ways.

[17:45] So let's first of all deconstruct this.

[17:48] Stern did not say that this distributor should charge $12,525,000.

[17:54] That is this distributor is setting that price.

[17:58] Now, do I think they are going to sell a single diamond edition for $25,000 and the answer

[18:07] is absolutely not.

[18:10] There is no way they will sell for that much money.

[18:14] This distributor, I think, is going to set the price high to see where the market is for

[18:22] the game and they will go down from there.

[18:25] Okay?

[18:26] Now, this is also very interesting.

[18:30] This whole notion, this has never been done before, where Stern is giving a highly collectible,

[18:35] highly limited run game to distributors and telling them, you can charge whatever you

[18:41] want for this.

[18:43] So they could almost like give it to one of their best customers at cost and that customer

[18:52] could get it within a range of prices.

[18:55] So if you do the math, right, so let's do the math because I'm going to pull up the calculator.

[19:00] So if there are seven games out of ten that a distributor is selling for $7,600, right,

[19:08] let's do the math.

[19:09] That means that's $53,200 that that distributor will make back from that game.

[19:18] Now we're not factoring wholesale price.

[19:20] The distributor needs to make money on each game.

[19:23] But that means there is another like $16,800 that that distributor needs to make up to get

[19:31] to that $70,000 he gave Stern.

[19:34] So if you do the math, the reality is the platinum and the SLEs are not costing, you know, the

[19:43] distributor, you know, tens of thousands of dollars.

[19:48] They are simply the cherry on top of a bulk order and they are designed to allow the distributor

[19:57] to give their best customers a chance at getting the rare version.

[20:04] Now here's what I think this is going to happen.

[20:07] I think that that number of $25,000 is a joke.

[20:12] I think what's going to happen is this.

[20:13] I think you're going to see distributors, whoever sets the lowest price for the diamond

[20:21] edition of the Beatles, they will, I think, ostensibly be setting the market value for the game.

[20:31] I think you're going to have a handful of distributors that hook up their best customers

[20:37] with Beatles, platinum editions and diamond editions at a good price, at cost, right?

[20:47] Because like there's no way if it's just stickers that are different on the game, there's

[20:53] no way they're going to justify it.

[20:54] This is just not that kind of market, right?

[20:58] And it's just, it's also like not like Supreme where Supreme had a list of collectors that

[21:05] those games went to immediately.

[21:08] There is not a list of people that will just buy the next Beatles thing, especially not

[21:14] at these kinds of prices.

[21:16] So I think this is kind of uncharted territory for Stern and for their distributors.

[21:23] The other thing that I think is an issue is this.

[21:26] Is the way Stern is doing this allocation, they basically are making you buy 10 at a

[21:33] time.

[21:35] And what if you don't have like 40 or 50 people that want the regular version of the

[21:42] game, then you're really not going to get many of the platinum or diamond editions.

[21:48] You know who this is so similar to another industry.

[21:52] This is how the car industry works with manufacturers allocating more of the hot cars to the dealerships

[22:03] that sell higher volume.

[22:05] So for example, when the Dodge Demon came out, dealers had sold a lot of Hellcats and a

[22:11] lot of SRT products.

[22:14] They were the ones who were allocated the most demons.

[22:18] A smaller dealership might only have received one and some might not have received any.

[22:25] So Stern is basically saying to our high volume distributors, you will get the most of

[22:31] the more collectible versions.

[22:34] But again, I think this just feels weird to me because if it's all the same game, if

[22:41] it's all the same game, then why would anyone pay double or triple for something that is

[22:49] mere cosmetic.

[22:51] Now devil's advocate, what is different about Batman super early versus Batman premium

[22:59] when it comes to gameplay?

[23:02] Absolutely nothing.

[23:03] But I also think there's a little bit of a cap and a little bit of a ceiling on how

[23:08] much people will spend on a single pinball machine.

[23:13] And I do think that once you get around the $15,000 mark, you really have to start wondering

[23:21] if you're getting into crazy land because you could get three Stern pros for the price

[23:27] of one Batman super early.

[23:30] You could go get a lot of pinball for $15,000.

[23:34] Now $25,000.

[23:37] It's a whole another story.

[23:39] You can buy one Beatles or you could go get Pirates of the Caribbean, go get Dial then,

[23:45] and go get, you know, like a Batman premium.

[23:49] You could get three really, really solid games.

[23:51] You could get a Monster Bash remake, a medieval madness remake, and a Pirates of the Caribbean

[23:56] pretty much.

[23:57] Number one Beatles, Diamond Edition game, that's a risk in a sea witch.

[24:02] So will this be the case?

[24:06] Again, I don't take these numbers literally because I think the pricing that I'm hearing

[24:14] is going to go lower.

[24:16] Here is what I think it's going to be.

[24:18] I think you're going to see $7,600 for the gold edition.

[24:24] Then I think you're going to see like $10,000 for $10,000 to $12,000 for the platinum.

[24:32] I think you're going to see ultimately the diamonds maybe go for another $2,000, $3,000 over

[24:38] that.

[24:39] Around $15,000, okay?

[24:41] If they're able to find buyers for it, I do think they will.

[24:48] I mean, but I think around $15,000 is the limit.

[24:53] I think that is all you're ever going to get.

[24:57] Now you only have to find 100 people on planet earth who collect pinball, who want a one

[25:04] of only 100 Beatles, Diamond editions.

[25:09] But I think there just needs to be more in this game than just different art.

[25:13] I mean, I'm really curious to finally see the matrix of these three games to see how

[25:20] Stern is going to justify the increasing cost.

[25:24] But in their defense, it's the distributors who get to do the pricing.

[25:30] Now you could argue that is Stern simply deflecting all the anger and cash grab comments away

[25:38] from them and on to the backs of the distributors.

[25:42] I also think that is part of the reason why they're doing it this way is they did not

[25:49] like all the negativity that came their way around the Batman 66.

[25:54] Shares a video begging us to sell you the game.

[25:58] They are removing all of that from their house and they are now making it all about how

[26:06] good is your relationship with your distributor.

[26:09] And if it's good, you could probably walk away with the Beatles, Diamond edition for whatever

[26:16] the cost is to the distributor if they want to hook you up.

[26:20] And it's, we'll see how it all plays out.

[26:22] I think we're going to find all of this out on November 6th when the Beatles like is fully

[26:29] revealed to the world.

[26:30] We're going to get the pricing, we're going to get the press release, we're going to get

[26:33] all the media, we're going to, that's when it's really going to be promoted by Stern.

[26:37] And then a few weeks later, we'll get monsters.

[26:39] So that is what's up with pricing of the Beatles.

[26:44] All right.

[26:45] Think about that, email me at canadapimbaladgmail.com.

[26:49] All right.

[26:50] One final thing I want to talk about is October Fest pricing was also revealed.

[26:55] And they revealed it to be $7,400 with art blades.

[27:00] And they are saying that shipping is going to be available starting in January and get

[27:06] your order in.

[27:08] And I saw this.

[27:09] Now I see all these distributors starting their own threads around October Fest, which

[27:16] I think is annoying.

[27:17] I think the pin-side moderators need to do a better job of consolidating this game.

[27:26] And the amount of threads people can start on this game.

[27:29] And they also should not allow each individual distributor to start their own thread being

[27:35] like, buy October Fest from CoinTaker, buy it from pinball star.

[27:40] And then you have like separate threads from each distributor.

[27:44] And it's just so stupid.

[27:46] Can we just have one like October Fest, you know, for sale thread where like people can

[27:52] talk about the game, whether or not you should order it, talk about reviews.

[27:57] The other thing is this.

[27:59] And I saw this.

[28:00] And I don't know about you guys.

[28:03] But I literally just walked away from that and was like, why would anyone buy it right

[28:09] now?

[28:10] Right?

[28:11] Think about it.

[28:12] They know they have to change stuff on the art package.

[28:17] Like, and we don't know what those changes are.

[28:20] If you think you saw enough to go all in on this game right now, God bless you.

[28:26] Because I don't think most people did.

[28:29] I think there's work to be done on this pinball machine that they're going to now tackle

[28:34] over the next couple months.

[28:36] But you don't know what the final game is.

[28:39] Like you basically don't know what you're going to get.

[28:43] Majority of you have never played the game.

[28:46] And yet the order banks are open.

[28:50] It just feels so weird to me.

[28:52] It's like why are they even taking orders right now?

[28:57] And then again.

[28:58] These aren't even real orders.

[29:00] They're $250 refundable deposits.

[29:05] So it's one of these arbitrary fake lists where you can just jump on it and jump right

[29:12] off and you don't lose anything.

[29:15] And so I guess some people just jump on those because it's like, why not?

[29:19] Why not just be on it.

[29:21] And if you want the game, you're on the list sooner than later and you get the game

[29:26] earlier than others.

[29:29] So I understand why people do it.

[29:31] But I'm always curious if those lists, if they ever make their way to American pinball

[29:39] as a way to try to gauge interest or how many parts they should make or how many parts

[29:44] they should order for the initial run, how do they use those lists accurately when everybody

[29:50] can just bail immediately the second they see monsters or the second monster bash

[29:56] remake starts shipping or the second something else happens, then all of a sudden you could

[30:01] lose like 200 orders like that and you've made parts based upon those lists.

[30:07] So again, we're seeing this practice over and over again.

[30:13] I think that American pinball and October fest that is coming out in January, it just

[30:22] I don't know.

[30:23] I'm curious to see how well it's going to do.

[30:27] And I say that because even a two to three month wait on shipping a game, even that feels

[30:35] like a long time to wait.

[30:39] Just upon what Stern will do, which is take your monster's order in November and they

[30:46] will get you your monsters in December January.

[30:50] Because do you believe that October fest will be polished up enough with code, with artwork,

[30:57] with whatever changes they need to make?

[30:59] Do you believe that all those changes will be to your satisfaction so that they can hit

[31:05] go on the assembly line in January?

[31:10] Now we've rarely seen any of these companies like other than Stern actually meet their estimated

[31:17] date for production.

[31:19] Things always happen, delays always occur.

[31:23] But they need to get this game out.

[31:25] The further they get away from October in a game called October fest, the further they

[31:30] get away from the relevance and the timeliness of this title.

[31:37] I did notice their messaging spin a little bit.

[31:39] You can play October fest all year round.

[31:43] You can have a Christmas festival any year you want.

[31:47] You can celebrate the magic of Thanksgiving this June from American pinball.

[31:53] You know, I mean look, every day can be Halloween with the new Halloween by American pinball.

[31:59] You know, look, it's yet to be seen.

[32:04] If a seasonality festival will sell well throughout the year.

[32:09] You know it doesn't have seasonality, Batman, monsters, Star Wars, Deadpool, Iron Maiden,

[32:20] you know, Beatles, you know, it's like, we'll see.

[32:25] Of all the themes they could have made, I give you in February October fest.

[32:33] Now, I mean, we'll see.

[32:35] You guys, look, I hear a lot of people say a lot of stuff about the game.

[32:40] But you know, I just don't think people are reacting in a take my money now way.

[32:46] And look, I think they need to figure out a way to get this game executed well enough

[32:54] over the next couple of months where people really want to just buy it.

[33:00] And they're not going to get there and just design alone and mechs alone.

[33:04] The whole package needs to be executed better than it currently is.

[33:09] And they've got work to do.

[33:11] If they've got, they've got a lot of work to do.

[33:13] You know who should offer up their help?

[33:15] You know who should offer up their guidance?

[33:17] Pro Bono?

[33:18] Who should pick up the phone, a call American pinball and say, I know what you need to do.

[33:26] And I'm going to help you do it for free because you know what?

[33:29] I'm just that kind of guy.

[33:32] Mr. Benheck, he's got some good opinions about what these guys need to do.

[33:39] And I think he should call up Dovel and Normal and give them some free guidance on how they

[33:46] can make this game better or just tell them it's unsalvageable and just scrap the whole

[33:51] thing and forget it.

[33:53] Just re-skin it as something else.

[33:55] Make it, who do you need to point out?

[33:57] Anyway, no, I'm joking.

[34:00] So that's what's happening.

[34:01] It's going to be a very, very interesting November.

[34:06] Your dollars are going to be beckoned by many companies over the next few months.

[34:13] And I once again will give all of you the same advice I will try to take myself.

[34:20] And that is I would wait to play the game that you like the most and I would buy the game

[34:27] that you enjoy the most.

[34:29] And whether that's Pirates of the Caribbean or Monster Bash or Deadpool or October Fest,

[34:36] it's whatever you decide you enjoy, I'm happy for you.

[34:41] You know, it's okay to critique games here and there, but ultimately there's different

[34:45] strokes for different folks.

[34:46] You're going to like a game because of why you like it.

[34:50] You might love the October Fest art package right now.

[34:54] You might hate it.

[34:55] You might love the layout.

[34:57] You might hate it.

[34:58] You might love Pirates of the Caribbean and its Deep Code.

[35:01] You might think it's the most complex mess ever.

[35:04] Formulate your own opinion.

[35:07] I simply give my opinion.

[35:10] I simply talk about my experiences with these games, but it's your money and really respect

[35:17] your money more than your respect my opinions.

[35:21] This is a lot of money.

[35:23] And I think if there's one thing people are starting to realize, there's a lot of money

[35:26] you're spending on these games.

[35:28] Don't be fooled.

[35:30] It's really easy to get lost in the hype and lost in the excitement and then step back

[35:35] and be like, shit, I just spend like $21,000 on three Pimball machines.

[35:39] And am I really enjoying them and playing them that much?

[35:41] Am I really diving into the game?

[35:44] Make sure you're getting your money's worth and that you will enjoy this game for a long

[35:51] period of time.

[35:52] I don't think you can drop this kind of dough on toys and be sick of them in like four

[35:56] months.

[35:57] I just don't.

[35:58] And I think if you have 15 machines, you don't need anymore.

[36:02] You don't need anymore.

[36:05] There's no reason to have 15 Pimball machines.

[36:07] Here's why you can only fucking play one of them at once.

[36:11] Why not just buy a game when it's fully complete, enjoy it for six months, sell it and get

[36:16] another one.

[36:17] Why do you need a room full of 30?

[36:19] Makes no sense to me.

[36:21] If you do that, I hope you have a garage with like 10 amazing cars in it that you'll

[36:24] throw me the keys to every once in a while.

[36:26] Anyone, everyone, enjoy your weekends.

[36:29] I'm sure we'll be back with more news.
