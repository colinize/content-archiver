[00:00] I gotta give you your dream shot. I'm gonna send you up against the best. You two characters are going to top gun.

[00:21] Welcome to episode 326 of Canatus Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast that does not have a t-shirt.

[00:29] Alright, we have to fix that problem soon. It is a week before Texas Pinball Festival.

[00:35] And I don't know about you, but I always get excited before a pinball show because what a pinball show the size of Texas guarantees us is that there will be some news coming out of the show.

[00:48] And not only that, what these big shows do so successfully is they get a lot more people playing the new machines for the first time ever.

[00:58] And they will be able to give you more feedback on the game. So games like October Fest, games like Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, maybe there's gonna be a yellow brick road edition from Jersey Jack Pinball there.

[01:10] Maybe there'll be a few other surprises at the show that we don't know about yet. They might bring King Pin back to the show this year.

[01:18] So that's why I love Texas Pinball Festival. It's big. There's a lot of personalities there. It's a great time to hang out and just chat with friends.

[01:27] But ultimately, ultimately it's all about socializing and sharing our love of the hobby together. Now, I wasn't sure if I was going to go to Texas Pinball Festival because I had a conflict.

[01:39] Now, I'm here to confirm to you a fan of the show that I just booked my flight to Texas. That's right.

[01:48] Canada is flying first class down to Dallas Fort Worth. I arrive on Friday morning and I fly out Sunday morning. So I will be there at the show.

[01:59] So if you are going to be at T.P.F. keep a lookout for Canada. You can't miss me. I'll be the best dress guy there. Guaranteed.

[02:08] I will also probably have a t-shirt on that has the word Canada on it. I may even wear the Hilton hoodie if you're lucky.

[02:17] I also plan to go to the T.P.F. meet-and-greet that takes place that Friday. I think it's around 2 o'clock. So I'm going to try and get there in time for that.

[02:27] And I'm also really looking forward to the Twippy Awards on Saturday night.

[02:32] Will we walk away with Best Pinball Podcast? We'll have to wait and see. I don't know. I have to say Jeff and the people over there have been very, very good at keeping it close to the vest and not revealing who's winning.

[02:46] I think it should be a fun time Saturday night at T.P.F. So that's coming up quickly. I'm going to upload an episode this week where I talk to a Pennside listener all about what are the best themes in Pimball.

[03:01] So look forward to that this week as well. Now here's a deal. I want to talk a little bit about some stuff going on in the Pimball world.

[03:07] And then we're just going to let the week go on and we're going to get to T.P.F. when stuff really starts to pop. So what is happening in Pimball this week?

[03:15] So the Stern Insider people finally got to see what their first bit of inside information would be. And it happened to be the Stern Munsters Topper.

[03:26] Now what Stern did was they allowed people to log in with their sort of log in in password and that gave them a little video of what the the Munsters Topper would look like.

[03:37] It's sort of like four characters with the Kuku clock in the middle and the Raven comes out. I shared it with everyone on Canadian's Pimball Podcast page. So go check that out.

[03:47] Now I've been in the Munsters Thread and there also is this this this ridiculous thread that says something like monsters is the worst game of the question question question mark.

[03:57] And after reading the Munsters Thread and after seeing what a lot of you are saying about the game.

[04:03] I have to walk away from this game with one conclusion and that is people are really enjoying the game and they seem to be enjoying the way the game shoots.

[04:13] They seem to be enjoying the theme of the game. They enjoy the music, the call outs, the shots, the geometry. I think there's a lot more to like about the Munsters than there is to not like.

[04:24] And we know there was a lot of controversy around the coding of the game and how much depth is in the game and will do it make this game deeper than it is currently.

[04:35] And because it stands on 0.96 code right now, it probably is pretty far along and what we'll get now there will always be polish these games will always be revisited by the designers and the coders to make them as complete as they possibly can be.

[04:54] But as we know with stern games, the weight for that polish could take years. So it's a good time for people if they are interested in the Munsters to jump on one and see if you like it.

[05:05] Now here are the here the group of people that probably still have a little bit of a hard time knowing if it's the right game for them and that that's the premium buyer.

[05:15] So if the premium buyer does not have access to a Munsters L.E. Now remember, there's only 600 in the entire world. So it's not like they're everywhere.

[05:25] They might not know if it's the right game for them. Now there are probably a lot more pro versions of the Munsters out there for people to play.

[05:34] But if you want to get a premium, you probably want to get your hands on the game and see if it's the right game for you.

[05:41] The good news is that for the premium buyers, there is not a limit to the amount stern will make. So they're going to make this game for a few years.

[05:49] And I think that's a good thing. Sometimes we get really myopic in our criticism of stern pinball and we forget to realize that at any one time stern has so many games on the line that you can buy.

[06:03] Something like 6 to 8 games, they currently are still making and manufacturing where every other manufacturer out there, it's like all they have is one horse in the race at one time.

[06:16] And stern is the complete opposite. So if Munsters isn't the game for you, then maybe Beatles is. Maybe Batman is. Maybe Star Trek is.

[06:24] And all these games can go be bought tomorrow brand new from stern. All right. So speaking of code and when will it be done?

[06:33] The one code that people continue to wonder about is Ghostbusters. And we know that Ghostbusters is also a Dwight game.

[06:42] And so with Dwight still polishing Munsters, will he get around to Ghostbusters before he's finished with the Munsters code?

[06:51] And a lot of people are waiting to see what the deal is now. This is one of those times where stern sort of put their foot in their mouth.

[06:59] They said 26 months ago. This is the truth. 26 months ago is how long ago stern first said that they were working on Ghostbusters code updates.

[07:11] 26 months. All right. And nothing. No update. Nothing. And so we know that that sort of paints a picture a little bit of how stern can move on from a game.

[07:26] Because the sales might have been terrific. And there's no more work to be done because they're moving on to the next game that they can sell to you.

[07:32] But recently we heard from Zambietti. You know him artist of the Ghostbusters game. And he said that Ghostbusters code is coming along shortly.

[07:42] And then he's talked to the people at Stern and he's talked to Dwight. And it is on the radar. And it is on their to do list. Now again, how do we know when it's going to come out?

[07:53] Because they said 26 months ago they were working on the code. And so for Zambietti to say they're working on the code does that indicate that it's going to come shortly?

[08:03] Or is this just more of Stern being stern and saying something is happening, but it could happen tomorrow.

[08:10] It could happen a year from now. It could happen two years from now. So we'll see on that. All right.

[08:15] So some rumor that just keeps on growing and growing and growing and someone keeps bumping these threads to the top of Pinside.

[08:22] That is the rumor of Jaws Pimbal. And I thought that we reported on this show many times that Brian Eddie's next game will not be Jaws.

[08:35] And the reason why, and I wish someone would just go to Pinside and explain this to people, the reason why is that you will not get anything other than the shark and the name.

[08:48] You get nothing else with with the license. So they won't get clips from the movie. They won't get the theme song. It's just the shark and the name.

[08:57] Okay. So that is why no designer wants to touch this game. Can we just close the door on it? And what's funny is two years ago, Stern uploaded a photo from the licensing show.

[09:08] And it was Gary Stern's face and behind him were two posters. And the post said, I wonder what game will make next or what future title might we be working on?

[09:20] And it was Michael Jackson poster and a Jaws poster. Well, thank God they didn't make the Michael Jackson game because if you've seen leaving Neverland, it is a really bad time to be about anything related to Michael Jackson.

[09:36] The whole empire is collapsing around us. All right. So what else is going on?

[09:41] So let's see Steve Richie's game is coming out in just about a month. The Midwest gaming classic is going to happen in about four weeks. And that is really exciting. You know, it's amazing.

[09:53] Isn't it amazing how it feels like monsters just came out right they haven't even shipped a single premium of the game. And we're already on to the next game.

[10:04] Without Stern, how boring would this hobby be? You have to admit without Stern releasing a new game every three to four months, we would literally be bored to death waiting for the other manufacturers to deliver something.

[10:19] They do an amazing job of keeping this hobby and keeping us excited about what's next now. I know like a lot of you, you want more from the hobby than what Stern might be currently giving you.

[10:34] You understand that there's more magic to be had in Pimbal, but I'll say this if we look at Stern over the last few years, they have continued to improve upon every single thing that we have bitched about.

[10:48] Remember, it started with the artwork. It was all about the code and getting more complete code when games shipped.

[10:58] They've done a really good job lately of shipping games with code that is is pretty far along. They've made the games look stellar. I mean, the art packages on these machines are incredible right now.

[11:11] We want it home run themes. You want it nostalgic themes. They've been bringing out a lot of stuff that is listening to the feedback of people in the community.

[11:22] Now the final thing, right, there's only one thing missing now. They brought the LCD into the game. The last thing, the last thing that people have been complaining about and looking for more of.

[11:35] And that's just more technology and it's more innovation in the mechanisms in the games. All right. Now, if any company is set up to give you more mechanisms and more engineering in the game, it's a big company like Stern with all the resources that they have.

[11:54] So that is what I'm looking forward to from Stern. I think the final, the final thing that they need to do to justify where the prices of their games are currently at.

[12:07] I think is to include a lot more mechanical innovations in their games. And they've they've gotten away over the last few years with stuff that isn't really pushing the boundaries of what they can do.

[12:21] And they've been designing these games to a price point that works for them. But the mechanical innovation just doesn't work for me. And it works for a lot of you because you guys are still buying these games. But I say,

[12:36] I don't see myself buying any Stern Pimmel machines anytime soon until I see the mechanical innovation there. I just don't see myself doing it. Right. Now speaking of trading from a new Stern to a game with a lot more mechanical innovation and wow factor.

[12:57] Did you see what Greg bone got after he got rid of his monsters pro low and behold a monster bash remake made its way into his home. And I've been trying to talk to Greg about this. I've been Facebooking him. I know he's busy. He's a father with children and he's doing all this other stuff.

[13:18] But I want Greg bone to come on can he his pinball podcast and tell us why he went from monsters pro to monster bash remake and and should other people who are considering both of those titles what they should consider or think about that Greg has learned now that he made that switch.

[13:39] Greg do you hear me let's do it everyone wants to hear you back on the show right. All right. What's next spooky pinball. All right. So Alice Cooper's nightmare castle. It's ramping up big time. I mean these games are going out now pretty quickly. And that's a good thing. I've always wanted people to get their games and get them quickly. And it's been a year since the game was first revealed. But we are starting to see a lot more people unbox their out of school.

[14:09] And I'm excited to jump on the game again at T. P. F. I played the game a year ago. I saw the game a year ago. I was at the reveal a year ago. It was a little bit of a strange reveal. Charlie seemed nervous. He was probably nervous because he knew the game didn't really have much in it from a code standpoint. It did look beautiful. It still looks beautiful.

[14:35] I won't argue with the way this game looks. I mean you stand over and Alice Cooper's nightmare castle. And you look at the art package in that game and you look at the castle and you look at the side art. It's a beautiful looking machine. There's no doubt about it. I don't understand people who can say that game doesn't look good. And if you look at where they came from with America's most haunted and you look at their first game and this game now. It's hard to not see the progress in some way.

[15:05] It's spooky pinball. And that's I think that's a very fair assessment. Now how the game shoots. How how well the game is integrated with the theme. It will be enjoyable. We're going to find out. We're going to find out. We haven't played it. Most people haven't played it.

[15:22] The owners will always say the game is the greatest thing ever. That's what owners do. They justify their purchase. You never get any honesty from new inbox buyers. You only get the spin that they want you to believe. So we'll have to see because what I love about T.P.F. is we're going to get unfiltered, candid feedback from people who play the game with no skin in the game.

[15:49] There are people that are not necessarily buying it, but they're going to flip it. And I look forward to talking to many of you at the show about whether or not you enjoyed it.

[15:59] And I think that's fair. I'm going to go into the show with an open mind around Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle. And I think it's great that people are finally getting their games and they're going out the door.

[16:08] I also think they're going to make more than six a week. I think that was when they were still transitioning from TNA.

[16:15] The thing that I heard and I might see if Charlie can confirm this is they can make upwards of 20 a week when the line is going at full capacity. So if you do 20 a week and they need to make 500 of them.

[16:29] So how many weeks does that take? That takes 25 weeks. So it's about a little in about half a year. So they can do that in about six months.

[16:39] So I think what's going to happen is we're going to see everyone who's in on an Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle will get their game by the end of 2019.

[16:50] This is not going to be something that goes well into next year. So I would say by the end of 2019 every Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle will ship and get its way to customers.

[17:00] Okay, so we'll see. We'll see. All right, the real question becomes is what will happen when there's like 200 games out there? All right, there's 200 Alice Cooper's out there.

[17:10] Willie Wank has been revealed. Maybe deep root has revealed something. There might be something new from a Chicago gaming company.

[17:18] What happens when there's still like 300 games to be made and people have other options? What happens if the original Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle buyers some of them start to sell their games for less than what the game was new?

[17:35] It's just going to be interesting as these guys at the end of the line are witnessing their ability to a get the game sooner and get the game for cheaper.

[17:45] Will this ever happen again? My prediction is Chuck won't do it like this again. This $1,000 non-refundable deposit. It just doesn't make anyone satisfied.

[17:56] It doesn't. There's no upside to this other than him locking in people's money and there's a financial upside for him.

[18:06] But I also think Chuck's company runs on goodwill and I think this sort of erodes a little bit of that goodwill away. All right, let's go on.

[18:14] So it's hard not to like look at the four sale threads and see a couple games that are going for extremely high prices and one of those is magic girl.

[18:24] And for some reason lately, magic girls have been popping up left and right for sale and they range anywhere from $25,000 to $20,000 to $18,000.

[18:39] I saw one for like $19,999. There are not that many magic girls out there.

[18:48] But why are people trying to sell them now? I've been trying to figure this out. Why all of a sudden have three of them hit the market around the same time period.

[18:58] And why are people still confused on the realities of owning this game? I want to talk a little bit about this because it's also going to segue into the other game that went up for sale today.

[19:10] So here's the thing. Magic girl is the most beautiful pinball machine that was that has ever been made. There's no denying it. The game is a visual stunner. It doesn't work. It's broken. You know the story.

[19:24] So why do people want this game? Why does a collector after knowing all of this? Why does he still want this in his collection?

[19:34] And I don't begrudge any of these collectors who seek out these rare games, but I think the answers are pretty simple. I think one of it is collectors want to have something rare.

[19:46] And there's no denying the fact that magic girl is just rare. Right now, the John Papaduke Zidware Magic Girl, there are less than 30 of them ever made.

[19:58] I think the total number is around 28, you know, like 25 regulars and two or three prototypes. And that's it. That's all there are in the world.

[20:08] And if you break it down from there, there are only two to three true prototypes that are available. One of them, Bill Brandis has, one of them, Chris from Coin Takeer has, and I don't know where the third one is.

[20:23] And that's the other thing about these collectors is there are a lot of high end pinball collectors that never reveal themselves to the world. You don't know where they are, but they gobble up everything that's rare.

[20:35] So as long as there is a collectible nature to pinball, there will always be people that want to have the rare thing. Right. The one, the thing that's not found everywhere.

[20:46] So that when you walk into their pinball game room, you're seeing stuff that is seemingly magical. Right. It's mythological. It's the white whale of pinball. Wow, you have a magic girl. Wow, you have a big Lebowski. Wow, you have an alien. Wow, wow, wow. Right. That's what they're going for.

[21:03] And I've always said this, if you're a high end collector who wants a rare pinball game, there are not that many machines that create that kind of response from people, and there are not that many machines where the number of them is extremely limited.

[21:21] Now look, this is a very, very, very, very, very, very small portion of the pinball community. The high end collector is is not the prevalent buyer of pinball machines, but there are still many of them. There are far more high end collectors out there than there are magic girls.

[21:40] And that is why I think we're seeing interest in this game, even after I've pointed out what a piece of shit it is, even after anyone who's jumped on it points out what a piece of shit it is, that doesn't matter at all to these high end rich collectors, mainly because these gentlemen, they don't even play their pinball machines for the most part.

[22:04] And they surely don't play the rare games in their collection. You think these guys are like flipping their King Kongs and they're, they're jumping on their King pins and then they're putting like hundreds of games on these machines, they're not.

[22:17] And so for them, it's more about the pride of ownership and sort of the exclusivity that they feel having one is the main reason why they go after these machines.

[22:30] But the sad thing is about magic girl, you know, unlike other rare pins that are out there, it is the most unrewarding experience possible.

[22:41] And so it's so lame to sort of have someone walk up to the game and to see it and to see their eyes light up and to see all this seemingly magical stuff right in front of them.

[22:53] And then they flip the ball and nothing works. It is so pathetic. It is the equivalent of a sexy woman who is just the worst, you know, in every possible way in both personality and in any intimacy, right.

[23:12] You just, you walk up to it and you think it's going to be the most amazing experience and it's the worst experience you've ever had.

[23:19] And that's sort of what magic girl is now it was really interesting because deep route they chimed in on the magic girl for sale thread because one of the owners said something that I think all magic girl owners at some point thought that when deep route fixes the problems of John Papadouk's game that they would be able to retrofit the deep route mechanisms on top of the magic girl that they currently own.

[23:48] So that means like the entire center mechanism on John Papadouk's game that was shipped from American pinball doesn't work. None of it works. There's nowhere for the balls to lock. There's not even a way for the ball to get to the middle part of that mechanism where there's like a there's a magnetic flipping sort of area.

[24:08] And then there's also like a vertical up kick that shoots the ball from the play field all the way the top of that mechanism where it's supposed to be caught by a magnet. Now that also does not work.

[24:19] So the fixes that deep route has implemented into the magic girl game first of all we don't know what they are we don't know if the games even going to look remotely similar to the zidware version.

[24:31] I mean my hunch is if they've had to do a drastic overhaul of all the mechanical problems of magic girl I don't really know if the magic girl we get from deep route is going to look anything like the magic girl that John Papadouk had in his head with the zidware.

[24:49] Now if that's the case does that then make the original zidware magic girl still valuable still worth something.

[24:58] It's all subjective ultimately the value in this game in these games will always be this because they're attached to the failed story of zidware and they are sort of a reflection of the mad scientist.

[25:14] And this you know J pop and and and looking over a magic girl you see all of where his ideas were and his inability to finish any of those ideas in the game it is almost comical how he clearly went around that game and never was ever ever able to just complete one of the mechanisms and then move on to the next everything in the game is a half baked idea that just wouldn't work.

[25:40] So I just don't think that magic girl from deep route is going to go around that play field in that little universe and figure out like okay how do we make the king's chamber work how do we make the enchanted hair area work how do we make the lion saw work how do we make this work maybe it's just easier to be like fuck it let's just start over John what were you thinking what was the storyline of this game.

[26:04] Okay it's a prequel of theater magic and whatever and you know here is what the the objective is and everything can just be blown up in that game.

[26:14] Because nothing really works the only thing that worked in the game is the zombie 80 artwork and so maybe they're trying to design it around it so they can still keep that artwork in place because remember Jeremy's not working with deep route he's not going to redraw for them.

[26:31] The art package if they change the layout of the game alright so these games are for sale.

[26:38] Deep route mechanisms will not work on it if you buy a magic girl you will forever have a super expensive blinking box of lights that doesn't work and so the high end collectors as they're showing us right now they don't care they just want something rare.

[26:56] And I think a lot of pinball companies out there should take notice of this that there are extremely rich gentlemen.

[27:04] That only want a very small run of a game and they don't want something everyone else has and they want there to be some story attached to it they're willing to go in on these games even if the story is super negative.

[27:18] And that's what that part of the collector community is okay and nobody caters to them I keep saying this nobody caters there's no Bugatti there's no Lamborghini there's no Bentley.

[27:31] The there you know there's no cone is Berg I'm using car examples but nobody caters to these rich people they don't these gentlemen are all buying up stern at least like they're nothing because they are nothing to these people.

[27:43] And that's also why I think these games get traded around so much is nothing is truly special to them because to them it's easy to go get another one but when the when the game is really rare because of magic girl really worked the price of each one.

[28:01] If it was truly magical it would be a it would be closer to 50 to 60 thousand dollars if John pop it just crushed it and the game was incredible and there was only 25 in the world it would be such an expensive pin.

[28:15] But right now again I don't I wouldn't pay more than 10 grand for one and I know people who have them and I'm not trying to.

[28:21] I'm not trying to blow up their for sale threads but but I'm wrong because they keep hitting me up and saying Chris I'm getting offers of 18 thousand of 20 thousand and you know what they're saying they're rejecting those offers of 20 thousand dollars for magic girl to which I'm like take the fucking money and run because the only window to sell this game I firmly believe this is now because if deep root finishes it and accomplishes what they're setting out to do I don't think anyone's going to want the old bro.

[28:51] And I'm not just a token pro to piece of shit so we'll see we'll see the other thing though which is interesting I also hope deep root doesn't make unlimited numbers of these games because they were they were meant to be super special things if I were them I would have like a deep root platinum series where you have like super limited games and you understood.

[29:12] The market for them I think Robert teased that with like a fifty thousand dollar Alice in Wonderland but here's the thing and and I say this and I mean this if Robert only makes fifty units of Alice in Wonderland with the John pop it you artwork you know sorry the John pop it you design that's really radical and the zombie Eddie artwork if he only makes fifty of those available to the world and I mean just fifty you know no no premium version no pro version.

[29:42] How much could he charge per game and I'm telling you right now he could easily charge twenty five to thirty thousand per game maybe more and people would line up to buy it you again don't hate me for saying that the amount of money these guys have that means nothing to them it they look at it like well it's the same price of three stern at least and I would rather have that.

[30:12] Because stern at least are still a diamond a dozen in their minds okay all right so speaking of other game that has gone up for sale today a big Lebowski pinball machine is up for sale I believe it is in Florida I believe it is game number twenty five it is being offered for sale for twenty one thousand five hundred dollars

[30:33] and it has a couple broken plastics the seller is being very honest about the description of the game he is the I want to say the third owner of the game or second owner of the game I believe this game recently changed hands for eighteen thousand five hundred dollars now it is being offered up for sale again for twenty one thousand five hundred dollars so the price increase of three thousand dollars is interesting there are so many of you out there who want to change the game.

[31:03] So many of you out there who want to big Lebowski for eight thousand five hundred dollars the original price it was supposed to be I think a lot of you would buy this game for ten thousand dollars I think a lot of you would buy this game for twelve thousand dollars I think a lot of you would have helped

[31:17] Dutch pinball figure it out if they had increased the price of the game I think many of you would have understood and many of you would have paid a premium for the game all they had to do was say we're only making four or five hundred of them total for all time and they could have charged twelve to fifteen thousand dollars and people would have paid and knowing what we know now that wouldn't seem like a radically different way of doing it.

[31:47] So I think it was a really high price for all the stuff they put into that game and knowing what we know now they did everything poorly in terms of getting themselves out of the hole and now it sounds like it's too late.

[32:00] So twelve thousand twenty one thousand five hundred dollars now here's the problem I have because you know me I mean I in my head I dream of owning these rare machines I think it would be cool to have something that not everyone has and the big Lebowski though continues to feel like a toxic game.

[32:16] So does magic girl but the big Lebowski as well and the reason why these games are just toxic is so many people paid and fall for the game and didn't get the game and so how do you feel good about owning a game that your fellow pinside brother got screwed on so that toxicness follows these games around no matter who owns them there's just no way around that.

[32:42] That toxicity is also the reason why there's a very slim chance these games will ever get remade by anybody because they can't afford to give people their games if they absorb the debts of Dutch pinball right so if Chicago gaming tomorrow was like all right games fully designed we're going to make it what do they do you know what are they do to the hundred people who had deposits and who didn't get a game they can't afford to give a hundred people a free game.

[33:11] Free game because you know they didn't get the original 8500 Chicago gaming Dutch pinball did and they burn through the money so there's no way they can then give those hundred people a game for free basically and eat that cost right there's no way so it's a toxic game it's a toxic game and that's probably why we'll never see it all right now here's the other part and this is the main reason why I just cannot.

[33:41] For the life of me understand why anyone would pay these prices the big Lebowski is very prone to breaking and almost a lot of them and almost everyone that I've seen on location breaks down and the one at sunshine laundromat is broken down it doesn't function and unlike alien and this is the big difference unlike the alien game from highway pinball the big Lebowski game does not have a community of people that are helping people.

[34:11] They're not going to be the big Lebowski to create the kind of community around the game that will support the longevity and the the fixability of the game and if you look at what's happened with highway pinball and alien I believe the total number of alien games that made it out the door before they went kaput was somewhere around the ballpark of 150 to 250

[34:41] 200 games are somewhere around there and because there are that many out in the wild there are enough people that own it that want to make sure that their game and their investment can be played for a long time and people are really enjoying their alien so they want to make sure of any of Andrew's poor designs fail that they have a backup and when it comes to buying these rare games that becomes the main

[35:10] issue how long can I keep this game running there is nothing worse than the fear that your game might break and then there's no one to help you there's no solve for or fix for a problem that develops and we all know this if a pinball machine of one thing breaks if one mechanism goes down in a game the entire game is pretty broken because you don't want to play it it all has to work together or it doesn't work at all and the alien community has done a great job

[35:39] in finding solutions to the problems in making backup LEDs backup boards backup plastics replacement playfield just went up for sale recently people had replacement xenomec heads so the community has done a terrific job in helping people get the peace of mind in owning an alien with all of those backup parts none of that exists with the big Lebowski owners the big Lebowski owners are playing Russian

[36:08] Russian roulette with their money and their game every time they play their game they have to be anxious that this could be the game or something goes down this could be the game or something breaks and if that happens they're kind of screwed very

[36:24] very in yopper not going to help them out very in yop are MIA and so that's the problem with the big Lebowski you know I was even thinking about oh if I bought one I know there are some spare parts that coin taker had because he had a couple of games that were damaged and shipping but nope those parts were scooped up by a collector who has a big Lebowski so there are no spare parts to be found you you basically pay 21,500 dollars and your father

[36:54] is not now the other part is so what if a miracle happens and a few things occur what if Dutch pinball like polls a rabbit out of a hat and starts making more of them well then your 21,500 dollar game you just took a huge hit on it what if

[37:10] a.r.a sells the 40 games that are in box what happens to those games how much will they go for how much will they be worth a brand new one right unmolecited version surely more than 21,500 so alien the big Lebowski and magic girl three machines all of which are less than 200 in the world you have about 50 big Lebowski's 25 magic girls and 150 alien pinball machines

[37:40] because of that there will always be a really strong demand for these games that demand far outweighs the supply of these products all of these titles all three of them regardless of how well they flip will be sought after forever there's no way around it which which machines bring more enjoyment I think it's easy to understand that alien and big Lebowski are far more enjoyable to own than a magic girl

[38:07] but owning all of them is a little bit of a headache owning all of them is a little bit of a risky endeavor and God bless you high end collectors who need to have these things I am so thankful that I got out of magic girl when I did for what I got out of it for 20,000 dollars is what I sold mine for

[38:28] I don't regret selling it I don't miss it for one moment I don't care to ever flip the game again I'm not impressed when I see it I'm not impressed when I see people buy it for an extreme price I think the game is nothing more than a work of art and I have a play field that if you want to buy I have a magic girl play field for sale it is probably one of the only extra play fields American pinball made

[38:58] it is brand new it's never been put in a game and I will happily sell this play field to one of you out there who collects pinball play fields I paid one thousand dollars for it but that was when dovel was just getting rid of the stuff so don't think I'm selling it just for one grand but I will entertain offers on this play field if you would like it it is absolutely a stunning work of art I also have one of the only prototype back glass

[39:28] I have a magic girl play field for sale it comes with a letter of authenticity from Jeremy Packer it is so much cooler than the one that American pinball put out because this is when they actually use more of the color tones and it's not so washed out in purple like if you look at magic girl on the back glass of all the American pinball games she's like a purple color not a skin tone color I have one of the original skin tone color back glasses of magic girl that one was even more expensive but I will share it with you

[39:58] I will share your images of that as well my mom has it in her art gallery she's supposed to frame it for me but I just never got around to finalizing what I'd like it to be all right what else is going on and pinball home pin so is it over is it finally over we have Wayne you know Wayne the distributor over there in Australia.

[40:17] He doesn't like Mike and this thread is turned into a whole,

[40:23] just a boondoggle, if that's even the right word.

[40:25] It's just a catastrophe is a better word.

[40:27] So apparently Wayne is saying that Mike is just out of money.

[40:31] He's got no money to get the line going and it's over.

[40:34] And people aren't gonna get their games.

[40:36] And Wayne is basically threatening to go after this guy

[40:39] with like his muscle and his legal power.

[40:41] And so some people are asking Mike to sort of relinquish

[40:46] the company and they're even suggesting

[40:49] that maybe Wayne should like buy out home pin and take over

[40:54] and make a successful pinball company that runs out of China.

[40:58] And I think that would be the stupidest thing to do.

[41:00] We know Wayne brags a lot about all the money he has,

[41:03] but there's nothing dumber that you could do with your money

[41:07] and your millions than try to bail out a failing pinball company.

[41:11] I mean, that is the easiest way to lose your money.

[41:13] There's absolutely no upside to doing that.

[41:15] So I think home pin will be the first to die

[41:19] if it's not already dead.

[41:21] We predict it last year that Dutch pinball

[41:23] and a highway would fail.

[41:25] And we predicted that home pin would not make it either

[41:29] to the end of 2019.

[41:31] So I think it's pretty much time to put a fork in it

[41:35] because I can't see them turning things around.

[41:37] Especially with all the stuff coming out,

[41:40] it's really hard to understand how a mediocre game

[41:45] that is based on, you know, with all this drama

[41:47] with the company, how anyone could wake up and say,

[41:50] you know what I'm really gonna do?

[41:52] I'm gonna go buy from home pin today

[41:53] because they deserve my money.

[41:55] All right, should I read any emails?

[41:57] Let's see, I got a couple, then I'm gonna call it a day.

[41:59] First, I want to thank all you guys out there

[42:02] who have donated to the show patreon.com slash

[42:07] canada pinball.

[42:08] You can show your support for the show at any time.

[42:11] Always much appreciated.

[42:13] I got an email from Jeff S and he says canada.

[42:17] You have proven that Jersey Jack pirates of the Caribbean

[42:20] is no greatest of all time, at least not yours.

[42:24] All of the attention given the topic

[42:26] in the past podcast has been refreshing and pretty amusing.

[42:31] Great way to discuss the issue.

[42:34] I have never called Jersey Jack Pirates of the Caribbean

[42:37] a goat because I know better to make such a claim

[42:40] until I'm sure.

[42:42] There is a goat you've trashed in the past

[42:45] because of reliability and being an owner of one

[42:49] can say that aspect doesn't bother me

[42:51] and shouldn't have been a consideration.

[42:54] If something breaks, I replace it and move on.

[42:58] I do believe Jersey Jack Pirates of the Caribbean

[43:01] is not the greatest of all time.

[43:05] He says, and the greatest of all time is dot, dot, dot, dot,

[43:09] dot, alien.

[43:12] So Jeff, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[43:16] If Alien Pimble was the greatest of all time,

[43:18] it's real simple.

[43:20] The game went a sold well.

[43:21] And it's not just Andrew Highway is lack of manufacturing.

[43:24] This game is not the greatest of all time.

[43:27] There is no way the greatest Pimble machine of all time

[43:31] based on alien takes place without the main character

[43:35] of the movies.

[43:35] I mean, let's just stop being stupid for a moment.

[43:38] Let's not fool ourselves.

[43:40] So Gourney Weaver could have been in the game.

[43:42] She wasn't in the game because they

[43:43] couldn't afford to put her in the game.

[43:46] I also, when I look at an alien machine

[43:48] and correct me from the wrong, tell me what mechanism

[43:52] there is that's really cool other than the Xeno head, which

[43:55] I also think looks really silly with that pencil that

[44:00] comes out of the mouth to grab the ball.

[44:02] What else is going on in that game that is super cool

[44:05] mechanically?

[44:06] I think that alien is immersive.

[44:09] I think it has one of the greatest music soundtracks ever.

[44:12] And I think the modes are really cool and pull you in

[44:15] into the alien world.

[44:17] But it is not the greatest Pimble machine of all time, not by

[44:21] any means.

[44:22] But again, if you think it is, then it is because it's a

[44:26] subjective argument.

[44:28] All right, one more email then I got to go do more work on a

[44:31] Sunday, which is crazy.

[44:32] All right, I got an email Pimble in New York City, St.

[44:35] Paddy's Day.

[44:36] Hey, Chris, big fan of the show in the city and going to

[44:40] hit modern Pimble after drinks here at handcraft.

[44:44] Any other places you recommend while I'm here in town,

[44:47] staying in the fashion district.

[44:49] Keep up the awesome work, Matt.

[44:52] All right, Matt, well, here's the thing.

[44:54] You should go to Sunshine, Laundromat, and Brooklyn.

[44:57] You should go to Pioneer Bar, which is around, what

[45:01] there's a Chelsea area.

[45:04] So those are the two best places I would go to.

[45:06] Modern Pimble is also good as well, just to play Pimble.

[45:11] So there's a lot of Pimble in the city that you can find.

[45:14] I would recommend you do something when you're in New York

[45:16] City.

[45:17] I would recommend you do so much more than play Pimble.

[45:20] This city is incredible.

[45:22] If I was visiting New York City, I got to be honest.

[45:25] The last thing I would do is carve out a lot of time to play

[45:28] Pimble.

[45:28] I would use that time to go to shows, to eat at different

[45:33] restaurants, to do other stuff.

[45:35] I wouldn't waste my time playing Pimble if I haven't been

[45:39] in New York City before.

[45:40] And I always kind of think it's crazy when these guys

[45:43] on Pinside, they travel the world.

[45:45] They go all the way around the world.

[45:46] And they're in cities with so much culture and so much to do.

[45:49] And they might not come back anytime soon.

[45:52] And they spend so much of it playing Pimble.

[45:54] It's weird.

[45:55] Really weird.

[45:57] Anyway, thank you guys for listening to this episode.

[46:00] It can eat his Pimble podcast.

[46:01] We will be back with another episode in which we talk all

[46:05] about theme and how theme matters in Pimble.

[46:08] Until then, look for me at T-P-F, flip your pins.

[46:12] And I mean, play them.

[46:13] Don't trade them for more money.

[46:15] And enjoy.

[46:16] Enjoy 2019, because I think we're about

[46:19] to see some awesome fucking games come down the road.

[46:21] Everyone, have a great day.

[46:22] I'm a man.

[46:32] This is more than just a game.

[46:36] I can make you feel so right.

[46:40] It's be my lady.

[46:42] I'm the night.

[46:44] You're a woman.

[46:46] I'm a man.

[46:48] You're my fortune.

[46:50] You're the fire.

[46:51] These are things we can discuss.

[46:56] Be my lady.

[47:00] You're my heart.

[47:02] You're my soul.

[47:04] I keep the churning everywhere I go.
