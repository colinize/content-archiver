[00:00] Ha! Well what you see, what you see, it's what you get, it's what you get, what you see, what you see, it's what you get.

[00:11] It's what you get, but say, but say, but say, but say, but say, but say, but say, I...

[00:16] Alright so we finally got some direct answers on a question we've been asking on this

[00:23] pinball podcast for a few weeks now, and I want to say, it was really awesome again to

[00:28] go on the flipping out stream on Twitch last night and join Ken and Bill. We had Joe Katz,

[00:36] we had Eric, we had Keith from Jersey Jack Pinball, we had many of you on there as well,

[00:42] engaged in a streaming of Willy Wonka. Now this episode, I have to say, I've been going back and forth,

[00:50] I even woke up at 4 in the morning, I wrote down a bunch of notes and thoughts that were in my

[00:55] head that I want to share with you because I've been now in a tug-a-war with myself over this game,

[01:02] and I know a lot of you out there also go through similar feelings about a pinball machine when it

[01:08] comes to one very simple question, do I want to buy this machine, do I want to own this machine,

[01:18] and I want to say before I give you my impressions of what we heard last night and my opinions and my

[01:25] reactions to it all. I want to say a couple things, first and foremost, I want to thank Ken and

[01:30] Zach and everyone out there who puts on the flipping out pinball stream on Twitch, and I'll tell you

[01:35] why because I think that format actually got us some really, really direct answers, and I want to

[01:42] thank Ken in particular for asking the tough questions directly to the people in the room he's

[01:50] with. It's not easy. It is not easy when you interview someone to go right at them with the question

[01:57] that's on all of our minds, and the reason why I want to say thank you for that because I think it

[02:02] gave us some very valuable information that will help many of you out there figure out whether or

[02:08] not this is the game for you, and I feel like this question has been circling around it,

[02:14] but now we have an answer, and you get to hear directly why the game is the way it is, okay?

[02:20] Sorry, I'm going to play that for you in a minute. I want to thank them for doing that because

[02:24] without that medium, I don't really think you get that kind of answer. I also don't think you get

[02:29] the answer as candidly as you would because you're putting someone on the spot. I mean, they're

[02:35] basically on live television asking them a question, right? And so then they give their answer,

[02:41] and here's what's great about it. They can't go back, they can't edit out the answer,

[02:45] they can't change the answer, they can't say, hey, can we record that again? All that stuff can

[02:49] take place when you do a podcast, but when it's on live TV, you have to make sure your answer is

[02:56] the one you want to give because it's going to be captured live for people to react to. And this

[03:01] is why, just for the record, this is why whenever companies and brands go on live TV to answer questions

[03:08] about products, there's oftentimes a lot of training, and a lot of, I won't say it, but I'll say it,

[03:14] like rehearsing that goes into some of these answers because if you give an answer to that,

[03:18] as a little wishy washy, it could have negative impact on the product you're trying to sell. And I'll

[03:23] let you be the judge of whether or not you thought the answer was satisfactory. So I want to thank

[03:28] them for putting the stream on. You know, yesterday was an interesting day. It was an interesting day

[03:34] because I woke up and I listened to the Slapsafe Pinball podcast, a really, really good episode

[03:40] in which Jason, the host, was talking with Zach many, and they were debating Willy Wonka and Jason

[03:47] was articulating to Zach why he is canceling his Willy Wonka order. And I just recommend you listen

[03:54] to it and they go back and forth. And a lot of the reasons that Jason gave for canceling the game

[03:59] are some of the issues we've had or we've brought up on this show as a reason why we're hesitant.

[04:06] And I have to say it's hard for me. It's hard for me. For those of you who listen to this show

[04:12] and follow my opinions on Pinball, you know how excited I was when I first played this game.

[04:17] I mean my excitement was just oozing out. I couldn't wait to drive back from Jersey Jack and say how

[04:21] much fun I had flipping the game. And since then, you know, the one thing I've been waiting to see

[04:27] is just the code to connect with the movie that I love in the way that I thought was so easy to achieve.

[04:34] And I think since that period, since that honeymoon period of being one of the first people in the

[04:39] world to flip the game, I've continued to look and search for something I really wanted to see in the

[04:45] game. And I think last night, I finally got the answer of whether or not it will deliver that to me.

[04:52] And you might be like me and be looking for some of that stuff or you might it might not be important

[04:56] to you. Okay. Now, I want to say before I go and air what we heard last night, I want to say this.

[05:02] And this is a little bit of like a disclaimer that we talk about frequently, which is make up your

[05:06] own opinion about every pinball machine. The opinions I'm about to express on this show are mine and

[05:12] mine alone. So do not do not only listen to what I say and then make a decision based upon my

[05:19] opinions. Now these opinions I do think reflect others out there. And I think hopefully when I give

[05:27] you my opinions about what we heard and where I think the game is, hopefully you'll feel that I

[05:33] at least tried to be constructive and give some thoughtful feedback that this isn't some like

[05:38] emotional reaction like I wake up the next day and I'm like I'm out on Willy Wonka screw this

[05:42] game. They totally messed it up. Once again, Jersey Jack pinball always has to find something wrong

[05:47] to do in the game. No, it's not like that at all. Okay. All right. So we finally got an answer to

[05:54] the question that's been on all of our minds and can ask Joe Katz directly. Will we see more clips

[06:03] in the game in which the voice is synced up with the video the way we do with the Wonka Vader

[06:09] multiple and I want to air for you his response to that direct question right now. And Joe,

[06:16] if you don't mind, we'll get this question out of the way for the evening. Do you see more clips

[06:21] synced with voices like we do? See during the Wonka Vader multi-ball. Do you see that as a

[06:26] option in code going forward? You know, this seems to come up a lot and well yeah it comes up a lot.

[06:39] The thing is like when you're playing the game and you're in a mode and the mode is a 30-second loop

[06:47] of four second brief clips tied together, strung together. Yep. People are saying they want it to

[06:55] be synced but really what you're going to end up hearing is like blah blah blah cut off, blah blah

[07:01] cut off. It doesn't really make sense to be syncing those particular clips together. Okay. Why not

[07:06] have speech from that scene that sets the scene that makes you kind of feel like you're in that scene

[07:12] when you're focusing on the ball anyways. Right. Yeah. When you're at a point in the game where the ball

[07:18] has been held and it stops somewhere and you get to look up for a second such as Wonka Vader

[07:23] multi-ball that makes sense to sync the clip to the audio because it's you're able to see it. It's

[07:31] it's that moment in time where you can get a chance to kind of look up to appreciate the synchronization

[07:36] of the clip with audio. Right. Otherwise it's just a big mess. Okay. What about song assets? I mean

[07:43] these what we see like here, root assault singing a song or that sort of thing. Well, you know

[07:51] take your turn man. I'm like you have 4,000 points. I don't need to be distracting you right now.

[07:59] But they don't revisit that question and we never did hear are we going to hear the songs from

[08:04] the kids like they are sung in the movie put into the game. Now I want to talk about what Joe Kats

[08:10] said there because he is basically saying we didn't do this because it would be blah blah blah

[08:16] cut off blah blah cut off and it would be a mess. Now I don't understand that answer and I want

[08:23] to explain why because I'm playing a game every day in which when the mode starts you see a cycle

[08:30] of clips go that are about two to three seconds long not even that long in which it takes you through

[08:37] the scene in the Batman TV show and it's not blah blah blah skip blah blah blah skip it just

[08:45] nicely pulls you through the scene with the clips and the mode that you're in connected and all

[08:51] of it's connected and if Lyman Sheets can do it and if he can do it in Batman which contains

[08:57] so many clips and when you do it in Batman when the mode starts while the mode's going the way he

[09:04] did it and I think Joe Kats should really hop on to a Batman 66 and see how it's done you know it's

[09:12] not like the balls frozen when the clips are playing with the video and the sound going together

[09:17] it's always going on while you're in the mode and even if you're still looking down and here's

[09:21] the thing when you're still looking down at the gameplay and focusing on your shots it's still

[09:27] nice to know if you glance up while you're hitting your shots in that mode that the clips are there

[09:34] with the audio it doesn't look awkward it doesn't look weird it's nice to know they're there and if

[09:39] you want to you know quickly glance up they're there so I don't understand why he gives this answer

[09:48] why he gives this answer about like how it would be a total mess in which the very game that I

[09:55] think people are saying is one of the best coded games out there Batman 66 did it and did it so

[10:00] well and actually showed them how to do it okay so yeah I mean that's his answer and so people

[10:09] were still coming into the stream later on and asking the same question because it's a question

[10:13] a lot of us have and here's what happened the second time it was brought up yeah the gunna

[10:18] canada did ask the synchronization question and and Joe addressed it so you can replay the chat or Joe

[10:24] I don't know if you want to rehash it one more time it's essentially it right now it's just kind

[10:30] of the experience lends itself well we're you're not really able to take in bolts at the same time

[10:35] anyhow right or it's just it's pretty much what you see is what you get at this play yeah right

[10:43] if you don't like it that's fine I appreciate the candidate answer from Joe cats I really do and I

[10:48] have to say that I don't like it I don't like the way they decided to do muted clips throughout the

[10:56] game without the voices there and I also don't buy this notion that we're not capable of looking up

[11:04] and quickly enjoying a clip from the movie with video and voice together and then continue on our

[11:10] pimbal experience right because we've seen it done before and we've seen it done before in jersey

[11:17] jack games before we've seen it done before in wizard of Oz we've seen it done before in the

[11:23] hobbit and so why now are we taking one step forward and two steps back with the latest jersey

[11:30] jack release there's always something that they do that just makes me scratch my head and I have

[11:37] to say this seems to be is this like the Achilles heel of this game for some people now and I've always

[11:44] said it you know they always find new ways to just make one big head scratching decision that sometimes

[11:52] I think makes people unsure of whether or not they want to own the game and look I just want to

[12:00] just take a little bit of a pause and say play the game and you know see if it works for you

[12:06] you know these answers are their answers and that's and I'm really I'm happy that they gave us

[12:10] direct answers I you know I didn't want to keep waiting and waiting and waiting months and months

[12:14] and months and watch endless streams of the game that's the answer and I'm glad that they said in

[12:20] a definitive way it is you know what it is you know this is it you know what you see is what you

[12:27] get that is the name of this podcast what you see is what you get now because they've said that

[12:34] what does that mean does that is that a is that a finite thing right is that definitive because the

[12:39] other thing I keep hearing and I have to say this it's a little bit of like a JJP a polygist approach

[12:46] in which people will say well Jersey Jack will they'll get it right they'll they'll put it in I

[12:50] mean have they ever let us down before and I hear that all the time have they ever let us down

[12:55] before like they've they've always continued to polish their games and polish their code and the

[12:59] answer is yes they have continued to make their games better but when I hear them say stuff like

[13:04] this it is you know what you see is what you get that does not leave me feeling confident that they

[13:11] will implement these changes and even when I hear Joe talk about it I mean you can hear it in

[13:16] his voice he's a little bit annoyed he's like perturbed he's like bummed out that people want to

[13:22] see that in the game all right so I want to share with you some things that I just jotted down

[13:29] last night at four in the morning okay and I just want to share my opinions and then I will give

[13:34] you my overall assessment of of of what my feelings are on the game I mean you guys are probably

[13:40] maybe a little bit sick and tired of me talking about wonka but you can't blame me I mean I

[13:44] mean a new Jersey Jack game is a milestone experience I was super excited if anyone talked a lot

[13:50] about this game and hyped people up it was me there's no other news going on in pinball so this

[13:56] is the hot story of the summer so far right okay so here's my take on this all right and this is

[14:02] what I wrote down first and foremost and this is what you hear when you hear them talk about the

[14:06] game over and over and over again this game was designed for location play they keep saying that

[14:14] they wanted a game that had short ball times was reliable everything an operator would love you

[14:21] know even down to the casino like sounds that would for sure stand out on location you know the left

[14:28] out lane drain is brutal in this game brutal if you watch streams I mean that left out lane brutal

[14:34] and it's shipping from the factory without the post there so there's a post you can put in

[14:40] and they keep saying it you know if you want to play at home and go deeper into the game you

[14:43] should put the post in but the fact that the designer set it up default without that post there

[14:51] really shows that the target for this game are the operators not homeowners so now you know homeowners

[14:59] that you know they will need to put the post in but they're going to feel like they're cheating

[15:04] I don't know about you but I always feel like when you change the game in terms of post from factory

[15:09] settings it feels a little bit like you're putting the game on easy and I don't think home buyers and

[15:14] home users want to feel that way okay okay so I know it doesn't matter to everyone okay but I think

[15:22] you know this game from the very beginning was engineered for location play now I heard someone say

[15:28] you know every game from the Valley Williams era was designed for location play and that's true

[15:34] it was you know but but I will say this when they start going over the rules in this game it doesn't

[15:40] feel like immediately intuitive you can't just stand up to the game and you know figure out the

[15:46] three major things you need to do it's not as simple as Valley Williams games were to get into

[15:50] back in the day all right but here's my biggest point and this was the one that really really

[15:57] really was on my mind and sort of you know I list I watched the stream for an hour last night and

[16:01] after hearing what Joe said I just had this this feeling that I couldn't shake and I want to share

[16:07] with you this is my overall opinion about what their decision was and how I you know my response to

[16:16] it and it's this the job of the coder software engineer and designer of a pinball machine that's

[16:24] based on a beloved theme like Willy Wonka is to jam as much of the theme into the pin as they

[16:32] possibly can not remove stuff as they see fit hearing Joe cats discuss how he decided not to give

[16:41] the clips audio was either total PR spin because they don't have the rights or one of the worst

[16:49] decisions I've seen a coder make when it comes to theme integration now because we see the clips

[16:58] happen sporadically at random moments like the wonkyvater multiple I think we also see it when it

[17:04] says you lose sir in the in the Willy Wonka office wizard mode they had the rights to use the clips

[17:12] with the audio okay so it was a design decision so him saying it wouldn't work would get repetitive

[17:20] and that you don't have time to play and see what's happening on the screen I feel is nonsense

[17:28] lineman sheets did it and created a masterpiece in Batman 66 but it couldn't be done here in Willy Wonka

[17:36] and why does Jersey Jack pinball have this huge screen that we are being told not to pay attention

[17:43] to it now right we can't put the clips with the audio in there because you know you're not going

[17:48] to be looking up and paying attention to it you're playing the game then why give us a 27 in screen

[17:53] that you're packing in so much information and the easiest thing for me to glance up and joy

[17:59] not all those little things that are too hard to figure focus on but a full screen version of my

[18:06] one of my favorite movie clips playing for me while I'm shooting the lights in the game that correspond

[18:13] to the modem in in the pinball experience right all right right the easiest thing to quickly look up

[18:20] let's sorry the easiest thing to quickly look up and appreciate right is an iconic scene you

[18:26] already know and love but now you look up and you see this muted scene it's frustrating it's weird

[18:36] and downright I feel the wrong approach again imagine playing a game like Batman 66 or Star Wars

[18:44] or Guardians of the Galaxy okay take any Wizard of Oz Hobbit imagine all of those great games in

[18:53] which when you looked up at the screen everything that went with video was muted and that's what's

[18:59] happening here in Willy Wonka right now all right another thing I said when I asked again and

[19:06] again about the clips getting sound which is something I feel all buyers clearly want Joe respond it

[19:15] what you see is what you get all right and as a buyer I'm here to tell them you know this is my

[19:22] money this is your money and if buyers want something that they can clearly put into the game you

[19:30] don't dismiss that feedback and say what you see is what you get you listen to the feedback

[19:37] of the people who want to buy your game you make those changes if you can you at least respond in a

[19:44] way that keeps the door open that you're going to take into consideration what people might want to see

[19:50] implement it into the game and it may come down the road you at least you at least give the notion

[19:57] that there might be hope that all of our collective feedback will reach the shores of Jersey Jack

[20:03] Pimball and they will listen to us and if any company has listened listen to its customers in the

[20:09] past and made positive changes to their games it's been Jersey Jack Pimball but I get the sense now

[20:16] with this game that they're sort of done with that approach and what you see is what you get which is

[20:22] what they told us okay the other thing I wrote is you can't go backwards when it comes to theme

[20:30] integration they gave people what they wanted in was and hobbit we all thought pire to the Caribbean

[20:37] was a lesson learned and that wonka would give us theme integration in spades I should not have to

[20:45] use pure imagination to experience the wonka movie I love in the Pimball game willy wonka is perhaps

[20:54] the easiest movie ever to translate over into Pimball and they somehow managed to mash it all up to

[21:01] the point where the film is now presented more as a mashup than a game about going through the

[21:08] chocolate factory let's take the wonka tonia mode what makes that scene so powerful is the creepy

[21:15] song and the creepy imagery that scared us all as kids and now with 50 years later Jjp is telling us

[21:26] they didn't want to use that creepy imagery because it would scare kids what is going on should we

[21:35] remove obi one canobi from dying because it might make some kids cry you know that is an iconic

[21:42] scene and and we remove it now so you remove the creepiness that everyone grew up and you know I

[21:50] just think that's a big mistake the other thing I was writing was like deep rule sets combined with

[21:57] very short ball times makes no sense to me you're basically jamming a ton of stuff into a game that most

[22:03] people will never see collecting all five golden tickets on three ball seems like getting to pure

[22:09] imagination will be as hard as getting to valina I know I know play better is what everyone's going

[22:14] to say but I keep watching these streams and it seems like even like really really seasoned players

[22:19] aren't getting very far into it but then again here's here's my counter point though and I'm going to

[22:24] say this I went over and I watched jack danger play willy wonka and jack danger not only is this

[22:32] stream gorgeous looking I mean it's like he his his streams are set up where like everything is

[22:38] in beautiful color everything looks perfect he's going direct feed into the game itself

[22:46] jack danger got four million points on willy wonk and blew the machine up and so here's here's

[22:53] what happened I woke up at 4 a.m. I had all this like all you know my bummed out reaction to

[22:58] joke cats decision to remove the audio from the clips and then I watched jack danger blow up

[23:03] this machine and I watched jack danger get to willy wonka's you know the office wizard mode in

[23:11] which everything in willy wonka's office is cut in half and I saw the mode and it is one of the

[23:18] coolest modes I've seen or wizard modes I've seen in pinball in which half of the LCD screen goes

[23:24] black and half of the play field goes dark so the lights are only happening on one half of the

[23:32] play field and you have to shoot from side to side it is magical so I see that and I'm like thank

[23:40] you joke cats like I think you've coded one of the coolest freaking modes in pinball history with

[23:47] that mode and so what I'm here on this podcast to tell you is I don't know which way to go with this

[23:55] game I think they have one change to make to it that would just make it work for everybody I mean

[24:02] I'm not even getting into people's complaints about mex because I don't have issues with that I

[24:06] think the game shoots like a dream I think joke cats needs to revisit the audio with the clips make

[24:13] it work we've seen you do it with was we've seen them do it with hobbit we've seen lime and

[24:18] sheets do it with like thousands more clips than they're using even in willy wonka it can be done

[24:23] each oh well what I'm asking for is this in those muted scenes just add the add the voice to those

[24:29] scenes I don't mind hearing you know varucus salt says you know saying I want to now over and over

[24:35] again or the daddy saying wonka how much for the go I don't mind hearing that over and over again

[24:40] I don't I don't I don't think anyone else does I don't think we're gonna get it so you know that

[24:47] leaves me where I'm at right now it leaves me in this crossroads with willy wonka on one front

[24:56] I think that the game is one of the best shooting games I've played in in a long time I think the

[25:02] game shoots great you know it's a mixed bag but on the other side I hate the way they did the clip

[25:08] theme integration on the game I hated I hate looking up and seeing muted clips it just feels

[25:14] unfinished it feels unpolished okay I've got like the music in the game which like you know it

[25:21] doesn't bother me that much it's not that bad but then I don't really get the musical songs from

[25:28] the film in the game you know when do we hear the songs actually being sung the way they are in

[25:33] the movie and we don't so it's like in I don't know it's like there's there's like always

[25:40] a plus and a minus with this game and I think for a lot of us out there you know some people

[25:45] like the artwork some people don't like the artwork I think the play field artwork is fine I think

[25:51] the standard edition cabinet artwork is probably the worst pinball artwork on a pro cabinet I've seen

[26:00] in eight years nine years maybe ever if you think about if you think about how good cabinet artwork

[26:07] has been for a really long time that is so embarrassing that they ended up with just that and to me

[26:14] that is sort of the the ultimate takeaway I have on all of this is why do we have to always live in

[26:23] a world of pinball compromises why can't they just go down what people want and give people exactly

[26:32] what they want and it just once again I think this is a game in which you're gonna get a polarizing

[26:39] response to it I think some people are gonna be yay and some people are gonna be nay and maybe

[26:44] that's good maybe that's not good maybe that's just pinball maybe you know you're never gonna make

[26:51] something that satisfies everybody and I agree with that and I agree with that and Joe Katz is allowed

[26:57] to code the game the way he wants I'm allowed to say I don't like it like that because I love the movie

[27:03] and I want to see more in it you know and and there's gonna be the JJP like fans there's gonna be the

[27:09] JJP apologists and then there's gonna be like the JJP haters and it's gonna be like a collision of

[27:14] all of them going and this and debating this game is it a universal you know unanimous home run

[27:22] it's not and I think the code is the main thing that's holding it's it back when people say the

[27:27] game is stripped down there's not that much in it I don't really agree with that when you play the

[27:32] game I think there's a lot going on but it just I don't have that one thing I want to feel that one

[27:40] thing I want to feel after watching all the streams and then hearing all the responses I just

[27:45] don't have that giddiness that I have to own it right now and so look I'm in on the collector's

[27:52] addition I don't even know if time is gonna change anything now if this if it isn't the way I want

[27:58] it now I don't think it's gonna get there in terms of like what I'm looking for so what does that

[28:05] mean it means well I have a refundable deposit with pinball star and that means that my money is

[28:12] still my money they don't have any of it there I'm not locked in to buy the game and so you know I

[28:19] could keep my spot I could take my money out right now as it is I don't see myself buying the game

[28:28] I don't see myself saying you know what if I have 12,500 dollars this is the game I'm going to go

[28:35] all in on and I have a few months to finally make up my mind but I'm starting to lean with one

[28:41] foot out on the game does that leave one foot still in I don't know maybe one foot in the middle

[28:47] but that's where I'm starting to lean and I didn't want to lean this way I you remember how excited

[28:54] I was I said there will be a willy-wank a pinball machine in this apartment that it will be here

[29:02] I just assumed that the code would go the way I thought it would go and and it sucks it sucks and

[29:08] I think for some of you out there you're starting to feel something that I feel which is once you get

[29:13] onto really really good pinball machines whether they have really amazing artwork or shots or

[29:19] code it's hard to go back it's hard to accept things that don't equal that or improve upon that

[29:27] and I think maybe I'm spoiled with Batman 66 and then I jump on like willy-wank and I'm like what

[29:33] is this like it's all over the place everything's crashing into everything you know and then I hear

[29:38] like Eric explaining the rules of willy-wank and my head starts to spin again there's just

[29:42] something about when Jersey Jack's engineers talk about the way the games are set up in terms of

[29:49] structure encoding and scoring and multipliers and and this and qualifiers and multipliers and

[29:55] blood it just it makes my head spin and when and and they don't they need to learn how to sell these

[30:01] games in more layman's terms on how to get you excited to jump on it because when they start

[30:06] talking rule sets man I don't know about you but I just want to like open my window and jump out

[30:10] I could talk to you about Batman and how to play the game but you got to start you got to start with

[30:16] the top level here's what you're trying to do you trying to put all four villains in jail and also

[30:20] jailed you know the other villains in the game and if you jail all the villains you get to villain

[30:25] escape which is a wizard mode if you jail the minor villains you get you know to select from three

[30:29] different minor wizard modes it's so easy to explain you hit each person you know when we they

[30:34] just they go down this road and then it seems like everything it's like it's like inside baseball it's

[30:40] like these guys are coding these games for like the die hard people that are just trying to figure out

[30:46] how to get to mega score mega score high scores qualifiers multipliers and it's not it's just doesn't

[30:52] make sense to me that's not what most people are looking for they want the movie they love to come

[31:00] to life under the glass start there start there it's never starting there it's always like it's like

[31:07] pinball people talking to themselves it's not you know I don't know it's just something about it it just

[31:12] I don't know maybe I'm like just crazy today anyway so that's it that's where we're at we have some

[31:18] answers take it for what it's worth and I think this is going to be a game someone's like who's

[31:24] chatting with me right now I gotta like figure out how to shut that off sorry guys so that's it

[31:30] that's it this has been episode 368 of canada's pinball piecas let me know how you feel

[31:39] canada pinball at gmail.com and I will read your responses whether you love a wanker don't like

[31:46] wonka I'd love to hear from you everyone play the game look at the streams the other part is

[31:52] we're gonna be streamed out to death on wonka I mean how many more streams are we gonna get

[31:56] before people spoil everything on the game it's gonna happen it's it's it's but you can't stop

[32:01] it now games out once the games out it's it's it's it's it's it's open season this stream and as much
