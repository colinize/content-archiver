[04:00] Every day is so wonderful

[04:10] Inside of me, inside of me

[04:18] I wonder how I can insecure

[04:24] More than something

[04:46] I am beautiful, in a single way

[04:51] Words can bring me down

[06:08] We're the 30th time in tune

[06:12] For the beautiful mistakes

[06:16] And everywhere we end up, where we don't know

[06:21] We should know the life is always short

[09:10] I'm looking to the mirror

[09:41] I'm going to sleep

[09:49] A life spins out front of me

[37:10] We believe in our dreams

[37:19] Of stars

[37:21] And light of fantasy

[37:25] Dream of dreams

[37:28] And what you see will be

[37:33] Because I keep their secrets in

[37:37] I'm hoping on my slides

[38:22] He's so bad but he does it so well

[38:26] I can see the end as it begins

[38:29] My one condition is

[38:33] Telling you all some under me

[38:36] Staring in a knife

[38:41] Bad lips and rosy cheeks

[38:43] Say you'll see me I can't even if it's just in your heart

[39:44] His clothes are in my room

[39:46] And his voice is a familiar sound

[39:50] Nothing lasts forever

[39:52] But this is getting good now

[39:55] He's so tall and handsome as hell

[39:58] He's so bad but he does it so well

[40:02] And when we've had our very last kiss

[40:05] My last request

[40:07] Say you'll remember me

[42:01] I feel my way through the darkness

[42:11] Got it by beating hard

[42:14] I can't tell where the journey will end

[42:19] But I know where to start

[42:22] They tell me I'm too young to understand

[42:26] They say I'm caught up in a dream

[42:30] Well I will pass by if I don't open up my eyes

[42:35] So that's fine by me

[42:37] So wake me up when it's all over

[42:41] When I'm wise or in a molder

[42:45] All this time I was friendin' myself and I

[42:50] Didn't know I was lost

[42:53] So wake me up when it's all over

[42:57] When I'm wise or in a molder

[43:01] All this time I was friendin' myself and I

[43:06] Didn't know I was lost

[43:23] As you will, as you will

[43:25] Kind of beautiful and if we not have to stay so magical

[43:47] And if there's love in this life there's the obstacle

[43:51] That can't be defeated

[43:55] For every tire and to tear for the vulnerable

[43:59] And every loss of the bones of a miracle

[44:03] For every dreamer, a dreamer will stop a blow

[44:07] With something to believe in

[44:11] Monday left me broken

[44:14] Tuesday I was through with hope

[44:17] When steam I empty arms were open

[44:21] Thursday waiting for love

[44:23] Waiting for love

[44:25] May the stars is righty

[44:28] I'm burning like a fire gun wild on Saturday

[44:32] Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday

[44:36] I'll be waiting for love

[44:38] Waiting for love to come around

[45:18] That you'll settle down at you

[45:24] Found a girl and you'll marry tonight

[45:31] I love that you'll be game-tune

[45:37] Is she getting famous?

[45:45] Oh, rain, why are you so shy?

[45:51] Ain't like a woman

[45:55] Oh, life and life

[45:59] I hate to turn out bad to do what bad about it

[46:04] Staying here, putting fire in her eyes

[46:07] I'm touching my face

[46:09] I'm touching the reminding that's enough

[46:12] It doesn't know who

[46:16] So maybe I'll find someone like you

[46:23] I just love me with the best of you

[46:30] Don't forget me, it's no pain

[02:35:52] Blast me to the sound of my teeth

[02:35:56] Every now and then I get a little bit nervous

[02:35:59] Got the best of all these combined

[02:36:03] Every now and then I get a little bit tired

[02:36:06] But I'll see you in the future

[02:36:09] I'll find you

[02:36:12] Every now and then I fall apart

[02:36:17] Every now and then I fall apart

[02:36:20] And I need you now tonight

[02:36:24] And I need you all I need

[02:36:27] And if you'll only hold me tight

[02:39:15] How to trace my blues away

[02:39:19] I'm gonna ride up to now

[02:39:23] It's a line of things that's gonna be how

[02:39:27] And when the night falls

[02:41:25] And so we're running

[02:41:27] Just as fast as we can

[02:41:29] Pulling on to one another

[02:41:31] And we'll try to get away

[02:41:33] Into the night

[02:41:35] And then you can change our own

[02:41:37] The memory and we're so old

[02:41:39] So we're running

[02:41:41] Then we say

[02:42:13] My body burns a gen like flame

[02:42:17] It's somewhere between the soul

[02:42:21] It's on the sheen

[02:42:23] It's where I find myself again

[02:42:27] I'm walking

[02:42:29] Why not?

[02:42:57] When I was young

[02:42:59] I found a golden hole

[02:43:01] And what my life

[02:43:03] For me to be

[02:43:05] Would I have followed

[02:43:07] Down my chosen road

[02:43:11] Or only wish

[02:43:15] But I could be

[02:43:17] You really

[02:43:47] Woo-ho-ho

[02:43:52] Woo-ho-ho

[02:43:57] Woo-ho-ho

[02:44:02] KVA laser down the road that I must travel

[02:44:07] KVA laser through the darkness of the night

[02:44:12] KVA laser wherever I go with the wind

[02:44:17] KVA laser over the highway for life

[02:44:28] You can dance, you can dance

[02:44:32] Come on, come on, come on, come on

[02:44:35] You can dance, you can dance

[02:44:39] Come on, come on, come on, come on

[02:44:43] You can dance, you can dance

[02:44:47] Come on, come on, come on, come on

[02:44:51] You can dance, you can dance

[02:44:54] Watch this in the sky

[02:45:09] Last, when there's nothing but a slow blow will bring you, that your fear seems to

[02:45:33] lie deep inside your mind. All alone I have cried, silent tears of love crying, in a world made of steel, made of stone, made of stone.

[02:46:03] If I only could take all the love that you give and escape to a world, please stop there.

[02:46:20] Where I hear the music, those my eyes feel moving, grab a right to go home of my heart.

[02:46:35] Before I see that, it feels to me but I can't help it all now that's in my mind.

[02:46:51] Take your passion and make it happen.

[02:46:58] It just come alive, you can act like you're alive.

[02:47:28] I hear the music, those my eyes I am really in a flash that takes all of my hope.

[02:47:53] I want to feel it, it feels to me but I can't help it all now that's in my mind.

[02:48:09] Take your passion and make it happen.

[02:48:23] When there's no one that I can't help it all now that's in my mind.

[02:48:53] We were thinking of you, should we all know?

[02:49:09] Rock and double time on the seduction wall.

[02:49:13] She is one of the kinds of judgmental men.

[02:49:17] Wanna know a plaza just another cold, me and me a lot of me.

[02:49:23] I come back up out of the hole, want to cool myself, take another round.

[02:49:28] Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing that the walls were shaking.

[02:49:34] The earth was quaking, my mind was shaking, and we were making a new.

[02:49:41] So be all I know, can you?

[02:49:49] So be all I know, and I can only thank you.

[02:49:57] So be all I know, and I will never shake it in you.

[02:50:04] So be all I know.

[02:50:12] I cover first real sick string, hooded out the fire and done.

[02:50:19] Played it till the fingers played, was it summer of 69?

[02:50:25] The end of the summer school had a bad every time real hard.

[02:50:32] Jimmy Quinn, Jody got married, shouldn't know, he never came far.

[02:50:40] Boy, I don't look back now, summer's seen a last forever, and if I had the trust,

[02:50:49] yeah, and I was won't I be there, those murderous days of mine.

[02:51:01] I'm in for the 60 night.

[02:51:10] When we look at the dark, we lay under the redness, and need it to run.

[02:51:16] I guess nothing could last forever, forever.

[02:51:22] When the night falls down, I wait for you and to come around.

[02:51:29] And the rest of our lives, with the sound of kids on the street outside.

[02:51:37] When you walk into the room, you only wonder, what's the time to move?

[02:51:43] And we're spinning with the stars out of the blue, and you'll see us, you know where we're going.

[02:51:50] Ooh baby, can you not touch us?

[02:51:53] Ooh heaven is the best on us, we're living.

[02:51:58] Not a problem, but we'll make heaven a best on us.

[02:52:03] Ooh heaven is the best on us, we're living.

[02:52:09] In this world we're just beginning to understand the miracle we're living.

[02:52:17] Baby, I wasn't afraid before, and I didn't crave anymore.

[02:52:34] Ooh baby, do you know what that's for?

[02:52:42] Ooh heaven is the best on us, we're living.

[02:52:48] Not a problem, but we'll make heaven a best on us.

[02:52:54] Ooh heaven is the best on us, we're living.

[02:53:01] Not a problem, but we'll make heaven a best on us.

[02:53:07] When you get mad at the nature, never sing, I'll take all the rules of day.

[02:53:12] You got blood on your face, a big disgrace, waving your banner out of the bridge.

[02:54:15] So without further ado.

[02:54:26] Can it gotta gun?

[02:54:30] Well, it's come on gun.

[02:54:34] Stay at the sun.

[02:54:38] You're the girl, gotta do.

[02:54:42] You're the girl, put your food through.

[02:54:46] That's it when Jiny was arrested.

[02:54:48] They found him in an impotent.

[02:54:54] But man he had it coming.

[02:54:56] Now the chain has got it crunchy.

[02:54:58] And I ever gotta be the king.

[02:55:18] I've been sick of this smile that it seems to me reminds me of childhood.

[02:55:41] Memories where everything wants to crash as a bright blue sky.

[02:55:50] Now in them when I see a face, it makes me wait as bad as special place.

[02:55:57] And if I stay up too long, I'll probably break down and cry.

[02:56:06] Woo!

[02:56:08] Oh, please don't cry.

[02:56:13] Woo!

[02:56:15] Oh, I'm losing love in my heart.

[02:56:19] The future rules take me home to the place my belong.

[02:56:31] Where's the ginger?

[02:56:34] How is my mother taking home?

[02:56:40] I'm not sure.

[02:57:19] So turn.

[02:57:24] I'm watching the ones with downer all day.

[02:57:28] Working for a man, she frees over faithful.

[02:57:38] She says we gotta hold on to what we've got.

[02:57:43] It doesn't make a difference until we make it a night.

[02:57:47] We gotta eat together, and that's a lot for her.

[02:57:54] We'll give it a shot.

[02:57:56] Oh, we're halfway there.

[02:57:59] Wow, give me home a breath.

[02:58:03] Take my hand, we'll make it elsewhere.

[02:58:07] Wow, give me home a breath.

[02:58:38] Baby, it's okay.

[02:58:41] So turn.

[02:58:45] We gotta hold on to what we've got.

[02:58:49] It doesn't make a difference until we make it a night.

[02:58:54] We gotta eat together, and that's a lot for her.

[02:58:59] We'll give it a shot.

[02:59:02] Oh, we're halfway there.

[02:59:06] Wow, give me home a breath.

[02:59:14] Wow, give me home a breath.

[02:59:21] We're not gonna take it.

[02:59:24] Oh, we ain't gonna take it.

[02:59:27] Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore.

[02:59:38] We've got the right to choose it.

[02:59:41] There ain't no way we'll lose it.

[02:59:44] This is our life, this is our song.

[02:59:50] We'll find the path of angels.

[02:59:54] Don't pick up destiny because you don't know us.

[02:59:59] You don't know us.

[03:00:03] Oh, we're not gonna take it.

[03:51:04] My place, I check my look in the mirror

[03:51:08] Wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face

[03:51:11] And I ain't getting nowhere

[03:51:14] I'm just living in a dark like this

[03:51:18] There's something heaven and somewhere

[03:51:22] Baby, I just need to kiss

[03:51:24] You can't start a fire

[03:51:27] You can't start a fire without a spark

[03:51:31] This gun's for high

[03:51:34] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:51:38] You can't start a fire

[03:51:50] You're still getting older

[03:51:53] There's a joke, yes, I want it to be me

[03:51:57] I save you from all my shoulders

[03:52:00] Come on, baby, the laughs on me

[03:52:03] Stay on your streets in this town

[03:52:07] And you'll be carving your ball right

[03:52:10] Say you gotta stay hungry

[03:52:13] Hey, baby, I'm just a fast-stopping mate

[03:52:16] I'm dying through some action

[03:52:19] I'm sick of sitting right here

[03:52:21] Trying to write this book

[03:52:23] I need a little reaction

[03:52:26] Come on, baby, give me just one look

[03:52:29] You can't start a fire

[03:52:32] Just around trying to be broken heart

[03:52:36] This gun's for high

[03:52:39] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:52:42] You can't start a fire

[03:52:45] You're not allowed to show up in the world

[03:52:48] But in the park this gun's for high

[03:52:52] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:52:55] Don't be in style in the eye of your mind

[03:52:58] But you know you're my fine

[03:53:02] I better face the plane

[03:53:06] You said that you'll never be

[03:53:10] But everything that you've seen

[03:53:13] Was lonely fade away

[03:53:17] I want to start a revolution from my head

[03:53:22] Because you said the brains I had went to my head

[03:53:28] Step outside and summertime's in bloom

[03:53:33] Stand up and satisfy your place

[03:53:37] Take that look from off your face

[03:53:40] You ain't never gonna burn my heart out

[03:53:47] One, two, three, four

[03:53:51] Come find your way

[03:53:55] Take that look from me

[03:53:57] And I feel warm in my heart

[03:54:02] So stand to it

[03:54:08] Turn the back and ask your love

[03:54:11] I heard you say

[03:54:14] You sound beautiful

[03:54:22] Take me to the place where you know

[03:54:27] Where nobody knows

[03:54:31] If it's not a day

[03:54:35] Please don't put your life in the head

[03:54:39] Of a true peaceman

[03:54:43] Throw it all away

[03:54:47] I want to start a revolution from my head

[03:54:52] Because you said the brains I had went to my head

[03:54:58] Step outside and summertime's in bloom

[03:55:04] Stand up and satisfy your place

[03:55:07] Take that look from off your face

[03:55:10] You ain't never gonna burn my heart out

[03:55:17] Yeah, are you over there?

[03:55:20] Take that look from me

[03:55:26] And I feel warm in my heart

[03:55:33] So stand to it

[03:55:39] Turn the back and ask your love

[03:55:42] I heard you say

[03:55:44] You sound beautiful

[03:55:47] Take that look from me

[03:55:50] And I feel warm in my heart

[03:55:53] So stand to it

[03:55:56] Turn the back and ask your love

[03:55:59] I heard you say

[03:56:03] Oh, I heard you say

[03:56:09] Don't cry

[03:56:12] Don't cry

[03:56:16] Don't cry

[03:56:26] Please don't tell that

[03:56:31] It's nine o'clock on a Saturday

[03:56:36] Regular crowd shuffles in

[03:56:39] There's a no man sitting next to me

[03:56:43] Make it love to his tonic engine

[03:56:57] He says, son, can you play me a memory?

[03:57:00] I'm not really sure how it goes

[03:57:05] But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it'd complete

[03:57:10] When I worry on the man's clothes

[03:57:14] La la la la la la la

[03:57:19] La la la la la la la

[03:57:25] Sing us the song, the other piano man

[03:57:30] Sing us the song tonight

[03:57:34] Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

[03:57:38] And you've got us feeling all right

[03:57:55] Now John at the bar is a friend of mine

[03:58:00] He gets me my drinks for free

[03:58:04] And he's quick with a joke

[03:58:06] Or a light up your smoke

[03:58:08] But there's some place that he'd rather be

[03:58:14] He says, Bill, I believe this is killing me

[03:58:18] And as a smile run away from his face

[03:58:22] Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star

[03:58:27] If I could get out of this place

[03:58:31] Oh la la la la la la la

[03:58:36] La la la la la

[03:58:43] Now Paul is a real estate novelist

[03:58:47] Who never had time for a while

[03:58:51] And he's talking with David

[03:58:53] Who's still in the Navy

[03:58:55] And probably will be fine

[03:59:09] And the waitress is practicing politics

[03:59:13] As a businessman slowly gets stoned

[03:59:17] Yes, they're sharing a dream

[03:59:19] They call loneliness

[03:59:21] But it's better than drinking alone

[03:59:41] Sing us the song, the other piano man

[03:59:45] Sing us the song tonight

[03:59:49] Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

[03:59:53] And you've got us feeling all right

[04:00:05] Oh take a little time

[04:00:09] A little time will look around me

[04:00:15] I've got nowhere left to hide

[04:00:19] It looks like love has finally found me

[04:00:25] In my life there's been honey can't paint

[04:00:31] I don't know if I can face it again

[04:00:37] I can't stop now

[04:00:41] How dream will so far

[04:00:44] The changes are lonely love

[04:00:51] I want to know what love is

[04:00:57] I want you to show me

[04:01:03] I want to feel what love is

[04:01:07] I know you can show me

[04:01:13] I want to know what love is

[04:01:19] I want you to show me

[04:01:25] I want to feel what love is

[04:01:31] I know you can show me

[04:01:39] It's better than love

[04:01:41] I want to know what love is

[04:01:55] I want you to know what love is

[04:02:23] I know you can show me

[04:02:53] I want you to show me

[04:02:55] You can show me

[04:02:59] You can show me

[04:03:01] But you can see it's blood

[04:03:03] It's nothing but some peanuts

[04:03:05] And it's so old I'll keep them

[04:03:07] There's been rainin since you left me

[04:03:11] Now I'm drownin' in the flow

[04:03:13] You see I've always been a fighter

[04:03:17] But without you I give up

[04:03:21] I think I love song like the way it's meant to be

[04:03:26] Well I guess I'm not that good anymore

[04:03:30] But baby that's just me

[04:03:33] Yeah I will love you baby

[04:03:44] Always am I there

[04:03:50] Forever am I there

[04:03:57] Oh wait

[04:04:10] And I love you

[04:04:12] Oh wait

[04:04:20] Now your pictures there

[04:04:22] You live behind all just memories

[04:04:25] Over different lives

[04:04:27] Something made us laugh

[04:04:29] Something made us cry

[04:04:31] Well then made you

[04:04:32] Have to say goodbye

[04:04:34] What I give to run my fingers

[04:04:36] Through your hair

[04:04:38] Touch your lips

[04:04:39] To hold you near

[04:04:41] When you see your prayers

[04:04:42] Try to understand

[04:04:44] I've made mistakes

[04:04:46] I'm just a man

[04:04:47] When he holds you close

[04:04:49] When it pulls you near

[04:04:51] When it says the words

[04:04:52] You've been needing to hear

[04:04:54] I wish I was him

[04:04:56] Who could those words of mine

[04:04:58] To say you

[04:04:59] Till the end of time

[04:05:01] And I

[04:05:04] Will love you

[04:05:35] When it's all over the world

[04:06:02] I'll be there

[04:06:32] Forever am I there

[04:07:03] And I would do anything for love

[04:07:09] I'd run right into hell and back

[04:07:15] I would do anything for love

[04:07:20] I'll never let you in that so fast

[04:07:27] But I'll never forget the way you feel

[04:07:31] I'd run right now

[04:07:33] Oh no

[04:07:35] No way

[04:07:37] And I would do anything for love

[04:07:42] But I won't do that

[04:08:33] And some days it don't come hard

[04:08:36] Some days it don't come at all

[04:08:39] And these are the days and never ends

[04:08:42] And some nights you're free and fine

[04:08:46] And some nights you're parked in nice

[04:08:49] Some nights you're locked up

[04:08:51] And I've never seen before

[04:08:54] We'll again

[04:08:56] And maybe I'm crazy

[04:08:58] Or it's crazy and it's true

[04:09:02] I'm going to conceive

[04:09:04] And for one I'm still saving now

[04:09:06] But are you?

[04:09:09] As long as the planet's abandoned

[04:09:12] As long as the stars are flooded

[04:09:15] As long as the dreams are falling true

[04:09:19] You've got to believe it

[04:09:21] And I would do anything for love

[04:09:26] And I'll be there till the final act

[04:09:29] And I would do anything for love

[04:09:35] And I'll take the vow and seal up act

[04:09:38] But I'll never forgive myself

[04:09:44] If we don't go away

[04:09:47] Tonight and I would do anything for love

[04:09:54] Oh, I would do anything for love

[04:09:59] Oh, I would do anything for love

[04:10:04] But I won't do that

[04:10:11] I would do anything for love

[04:10:14] Anything you've been dreaming of

[04:10:17] But I just won't do that

[04:10:23] Anything you've been dreaming of

[04:10:26] But I just won't do that

[04:10:32] Anything you've been dreaming of

[04:10:35] But I just won't do that

[04:10:53] No, I won't do that

[04:11:23] And some days I've prayed for silence

[04:11:32] And some days I've prayed for soul

[04:11:35] And some days I just prayed if it got a sex

[04:11:38] And drugs and rock and roll

[04:11:41] And some nights I lose the feeling

[04:11:44] And some nights I lose control

[04:11:47] Some nights I just lose it all

[04:11:50] And watching the dead sing upon your rose

[04:11:54] And maybe I'm lonely

[04:11:56] You're falling by the path to me

[04:12:00] There's just one and only one and only promise I can keep

[04:12:07] As long as the wheels are burning

[04:12:10] As long as the bars are burning

[04:12:13] As long as your trails are coming to

[04:14:36] I won't do that

[04:14:40] No, I won't do what you raise me up

[04:14:44] We're gonna help me down

[04:14:47] When you're getting the ride of this God for singing sound

[04:14:51] When you make it all of the rest call

[04:14:55] I can do that

[04:14:59] Oh, I can do your help to save

[04:15:03] When you hold me tight

[04:15:05] Can you cut her eyes my life?

[04:15:07] I'm so sick of black and white

[04:15:10] Can you make it all of the rest call?

[04:15:13] I can do that

[04:15:16] Oh, now I can do that

[04:15:20] It's so magic with your own two hands

[04:15:23] Can you build an ambulance?

[04:15:25] Here they with these grains of sand

[04:15:28] Can you give me something I can take home?

[04:15:32] I can do that

[04:15:35] Oh, now I can do that

[04:15:38] You gave me everything

[04:15:40] See I got

[04:15:52] Oh, now I can do that

[04:15:56] I don't want to forget everything

[04:16:00] It's a pre-fantilute

[04:16:02] I'm not meant to sleep

[04:16:05] And you see that it's time to move on

[04:16:08] I won't do that

[04:16:13] I won't do that

[04:16:15] I know the territory out the round

[04:16:19] It'll all turn to dust

[04:16:21] And we'll all fall down

[04:16:24] Sooner or later you'll be scrooing around

[04:16:28] I won't do that

[04:16:33] No, I won't do that

[04:16:36] If it's being full of

[04:16:39] Oh, now I can do anything for love
