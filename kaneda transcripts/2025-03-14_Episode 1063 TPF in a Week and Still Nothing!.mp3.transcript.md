[00:00] In the burning heart, just about to burst, there's a quest for answers and a creature of the first.

[00:10] In the darkest night, rising like a spider, in the burning heart, the unmistakable fire.

[00:18] Welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast. It's the Friday before Texas Pinball Festival, and there's nothing revealed.

[00:30] I'm shocked. March 14th, usually this time, right before the Big Texas show, usually, we've had a manufacturer or two reveal their game to the world.

[00:43] So then, when they bring it to the show, they can just set it up and everybody can bang on it.

[00:48] But there's nothing. It's nothing like the whole pinball space right now. We're waiting for these games to come out.

[00:54] It's now starting to look like April could see four games in one month.

[01:01] The new game from Barrels of Fun. Is it gonna be Dune? Is it gonna be Gremlins? Is it gonna be Goonies?

[01:07] We're gonna talk about Gremlins in a second. Is it gonna be G.I. Joe?

[01:11] Everybody's wondering now. TPF is the backyard show of Barrels of Fun.

[01:17] They're not gonna be there with anything new because I know David Van S wants to invite media and distributors to see the game before the reveal.

[01:26] I have not received any word on when that will happen.

[01:29] So until that happens, and we know that David's gonna want to give media at least a couple weeks to figure out travel, let their wives and their coworkers know.

[01:40] I'm gonna be flying down to Texas on a Friday. So until we get that word, we can make a safe bet that we're not seeing the Barrels game for at least two more weeks.

[01:51] So that brings us into April. At the end of April, we're gonna get the Pinball Brothers Predator game.

[01:58] We're also gonna get most likely King Kong. Remember, John Wick was revealed to the world May 7th.

[02:06] And Stern Pinball usually keeps things on a similar schedule.

[02:11] So I think we're gonna see Stern bump up King Kong. I think D&D sales are okay, but not phenomenal.

[02:18] I think we're gonna see Jersey Jack Pinball nervous of getting scooped by King Kong.

[02:24] I think we're gonna also see them reveal Harry Potter to the world.

[02:28] And the one game we're probably gonna get today.

[02:31] I think we're gonna get a teaser for it today, and I think it's gonna be revealed early next week before TPF is P3 Multimorphics Portal.

[02:41] And the early word on the street by folks like Kari Hardy that have seen the game is that it is a hit.

[02:47] It is the best game to date from Multimorphic.

[02:51] And so I fully expect a Portal teaser today so we can chew on something over the weekend.

[02:58] But I'm still shocked. It just goes to show if you're one of these people who for many, many years traveled down to TPF.

[03:05] It was always the show that everybody was working hard to reveal their product to get it on the floor at TPF.

[03:13] How times have changed. This show is no longer the sort of deadline that everybody is working towards.

[03:20] In fact, there might only be one new game revealed at TPF and that might be Portal. That might be it.

[03:28] For a lot of you out there now, you don't need to travel the Texas to play D&D.

[03:32] You don't need to travel the Texas to play Evil Dead.

[03:35] You can start to see these games out on location.

[03:39] And I think more and more of us are starting to sort of limit the amount of pinball shows we will get on an airplane for.

[03:47] And we'll probably drive to locations and shows that are closer.

[03:51] So we'll see what happens today. I'm a little bit surprised nobody's sort of surprised and delighted or shocked us with anything.

[03:57] Now speaking of a little shock and all, did you see this new box for Evil Dead Pimball?

[04:03] Christopher Franci has put on the box an image of a woman clawing through the box.

[04:09] Now that image looks exactly like the iconic Gremlins movie poster.

[04:16] So is this Christopher Franci teasing to us that this company has Gremlins?

[04:23] Here's the thing. I still think the next game from Spooky Pinball is going to be Beetlejuice.

[04:31] I also think they do have Gremlins, but I don't think Gremlins is next.

[04:37] Gremlins would be a great, great game to release in December because the theme of the movie happens at Christmas time.

[04:46] Isn't Gizmo a gift from the father as a Christmas present?

[04:51] Now what they need to do with Gremlins, if you get one machine wet, it pops out another machine. Wouldn't that be funny?

[05:00] So look, I love that they're having fun with these teasers.

[05:02] I'm a little surprised that the company that was famous for its teasers, Barrels of Fun, has done absolutely nothing.

[05:11] They've done nothing to sort of give us clues, to give us hints, to bring us on board, to have some fun with their next game about to drop.

[05:21] Maybe that was the factory tour with the sort of Goonies skeleton key and maybe they're just messing with us there, but there really hasn't been anything.

[05:30] There's literally none of these pinball companies in March. It is mid-March.

[05:34] Nobody has done anything to fan the flames of their new game.

[05:39] There's been no teasers. There's been no interviews. There's been no rolling out of anything.

[05:45] And as a marketer, I look at all this stuff and I'm like, you know what?

[05:50] You know where I would want to be? I would want to be first or last.

[05:54] Those are the only two positions I would want to be in as we head into a month-long period of new games, as we're watching everyone's 401Ks decimate it.

[06:07] As the stock market plummets. I mean, I'm just going to say this right now.

[06:10] I have a few bitcoins here and there, which has done nicely for me. I bought at a low price, but man, some of the other stuff, some of the other stuff like Ethereum.

[06:18] I think I lost a pinball machine in a half in just like a month on a little Ethereum I was holding.

[06:24] And it's very volatile, right? The markets right now are very volatile. And I think a lot of you out there, it's a shaky world right now.

[06:33] And when things get uncertain, are you going to invest in another hugely depreciating asset?

[06:39] And that is pinball. We shall see. I just expected someone to do something unique, something surprising, something that's different.

[06:47] Like throw away the playbook of how to launch a pinball machine and just do something different. Nothing. Nothing yet.

[06:54] So we shall see. So what I've been doing, what I've been doing as I've been healing with my hernias surgery, I've been playing a lot more guns and roses.

[07:04] I've been playing every day. I've been going through the game. I've started everything from the around the world tour to Slash's solo.

[07:12] I haven't got to the end of the game, which is what? The nod in this lifetime, no sympathy for the devil mode.

[07:19] I haven't been able to get there, but I just want to give my overall after playing this game hundreds and hundreds of times.

[07:28] I understand now why this game just frustrates people. It is a mixed bag game for sure.

[07:38] I love the energy of the game. I love the moments in which you start a song and you're rocking out and you've got a few balls locked up on that guitar neck.

[07:49] And you're with just one ball on the lower play field and you feel good because you've got like three balls locked just in case you drain.

[07:58] You've got some more balls you can put into play. If it were up to me, I would have figured out a way when you lock like four or five balls on that guitar neck

[08:07] and you drain the one ball you have in play that not all of those guitar neck balls drop into play.

[08:13] I wish you could control how many balls you fed into the main play field. It would just make it more fun.

[08:20] I know there's some strategy involved there. This game has those moments where it gets your adrenaline going and it's a lot of fun.

[08:29] But here's my thing with GNR. There's two things that are just killing this game for me and make me not want to turn it on much anymore.

[08:36] The out lane drains in this game are atrocious and I wrote that on Facebook and I mean it like this game.

[08:45] It's not just from the slingshots. All these shots and these targets and all these different things the ball can hit on the lower half of the play field

[08:54] send the ball into the out lanes so frequently and this game doesn't have any flow whatsoever.

[09:01] That's my bigger gripe than the out lane drains is like there's just no flow. There's absolutely no flow.

[09:09] You're never having any combos, all the shots and all the stuff to hit. It's all like way too close to the flippers.

[09:18] I wish this game like pushed everything back like two to three inches on the play field.

[09:26] It's a lot of stop and go. When you try to get flow going like the ball just ends up like ricocheting all over the place

[09:34] and that's what also is sending the ball into the out lanes all the time. A lot more out lane drains on my machine than straight down the middle.

[09:44] And so then when I just step back and think about you know what I love about pinball and games I really loved like I loved Lord of the Rings.

[09:51] Lord of the Rings was my first pinball machine. You could say I was spoiled in playing one of the greatest machines of all time.

[09:57] Now Lord of the Rings was also coded by the same guy that coded Guns N' Roses Keith Johnson.

[10:03] But what I loved about Lord of the Rings even though there was a lot in it and that little wheel in the middle of Lord of the Rings

[10:09] that has all the little mini lights where you can collect all the different stuff. That's like the patches for GNR.

[10:16] But even if you didn't get into that it was really simple to understand how to play that game.

[10:23] How to get to each movies multi-ball. How rewarding it was to get to each of those.

[10:29] And then once you get past those three you move on to such an iconic moment in the game where you destroy the ring.

[10:35] And it was so much fun. And you were able to see and you were able to get deeper into that game and get to wow moments.

[10:43] I think my favorite wow moment in all of Lord of the Rings is after you get to destroy the ring and then you get to there and back again.

[10:52] If any of you out there have never experienced there and back again in Lord of the Rings pinball it is one of the greatest pinball moments ever.

[11:01] It didn't require an LCD. You don't need animations. It's the way the music changes and the way the call outs come at you.

[11:10] It is so magical. And when I think about GNR there's never any magical call outs.

[11:17] They never do anything like unique with the music that's really interesting. And again I don't know why they didn't do this.

[11:23] You've got all this GNR catalog. You've got access to everything that GNR has ever done.

[11:30] And there's never a surprising moment musically in this game.

[11:35] They also could have done some stuff where you built a song maybe. Maybe that's a special mode.

[11:39] So imagine that right. Have you ever played rock band?

[11:42] Imagine like build a song mode in GNR like a secret mode where it starts out with just the bass and then you add the drums.

[11:50] Then you add axels vocals. There's just more they could have done.

[11:54] But in Lord of the Rings I knew exactly how to get through the game. The same thing with Batman.

[11:58] I knew how to start extra ball. I never ever in both of those games ever had to put those games on five ball to get deep into the game.

[12:08] With guns and roses here. Not only did I have to lower the outlaying posts. I also put it on five ball and that's still not making me have any more fun.

[12:19] It's not getting me deeper into the game. I just don't like that GNR when you step back and think about the game itself.

[12:27] After you get over all the experiences of the song modes. It's like there's not a lot else to really get excited about.

[12:35] The multi balls that you start the four multi balls that you can keep starting in the game are not that exciting. They're not rewarding to start.

[12:43] It's still confusing to me how to light extra ball. I don't really know. I think you've got to collect four patches. That's one way to do it.

[12:51] And maybe after you start or get through a couple of album modes it lights it again but it's not very clear.

[12:58] And I've owned this machine for like eight months now but it just doesn't for me anymore have that one more game feeling.

[13:07] I feel like when I get on it I'm having some fun but then after 20 minutes I'm good.

[13:13] And I think it's a good game in a lineup where you have a lot of other machines like if I had a Lord of the Rings next to this and I had Batman 66 next to guns and roses.

[13:24] Yeah I feel really good about having G&R to break up the monotony and deliver right. It still delivers the most amazing modern light show music concert in a box ever.

[13:37] It still delivers on that but it doesn't do much more than that.

[13:43] And in a home like mine where I've only got one pinball machine I can say this with full confidence this is not a good machine to own when you only have one machine.

[13:57] It's a great experiential pin when you've got a lineup of other machines.

[14:03] And so I think I am coming to the conclusion that I might have to get rid of G&R but I will not replace guns and roses unless it's a theme that I love as much as guns and roses.

[14:20] So yeah I don't love Godzilla more than guns and roses.

[14:23] I don't love Deadpool or Tron more than guns and roses.

[14:27] For me to replace my guns and roses I would need a theme like Fifth Element.

[14:33] I would need a theme like Big Trouble in Little China.

[14:37] I would need a theme like Predator.

[14:40] You son of a bitch.

[14:42] I'm going to put Predator in there.

[14:44] I don't think Predator is going to be that good but I've watched the Predator movies hundreds of times.

[14:49] But if I had to choose my dream theme it would be Transformers G1 the movie.

[14:56] Not the entire series of G1 Transformers.

[15:00] The movie with Unicron and Hot Rod and Rodimus Prime and Ultra Magnus and Optimus Dies and Galvatron and the album from that movie.

[15:11] The soundtrack from Transformers G1 is the greatest movie soundtrack maybe of all time.

[15:17] So Transformers G1 would be at the top of my list.

[15:48] Number 2 would be Fifth Element.

[16:09] Number 3 would be Akira.

[16:17] And number 4 would be Rocky 4.

[16:47] Number 4 would be Rocky.

[16:52] And number 5 would be Rocky.

[16:57] And number 6 would be Rocky.

[17:02] And number 7 would be Rocky.

[17:07] And number 8 would be Rocky.

[17:12] And number 9 would be Rocky.

[17:17] And number 9 would be Rocky.

[17:22] And number 9 would be Rocky.

[17:27] And number 9 would be Rocky.

[17:32] And number 9 would be Rocky.

[17:37] And number 10 would be Rocky,

[17:43] And number 11 would be Rocky,

[17:48] And number 11 would be Rocky,

[17:53] And number 11 would be Rocky,

[17:57] And number 11 would be Rocky,

[18:02] Crazy I want a boxing ring where you get in there and you fight and you're Apollo and you die

[18:08] And then you fight Drago and you've got to get to Russia and you got a train hearts on fire

[18:13] I want Rocky for now obviously back to the future would be one that I would put here

[18:19] I'm going down a list, but I'm just saying this is a dream theme spot in my house

[18:25] I plan to open up the garage to put another pinball machine in and that's where I'm gonna play the new stuff

[18:31] You know just bang on D&D for like a month bang on Evil Dead

[18:35] I plan to do that and give you my impressions of machines in my garage

[18:39] But the machine that makes it up here needs to be a dream theme and it needs to be worth the effort

[18:46] For Derek to come back not Derek who took his ball home and doesn't want to talk to me anymore

[18:51] Derek's my guy that moves pins for me on the East Coast

[18:55] He helped me get this machine up the stairs

[18:57] I do hope that I never ever have to put a Jersey Jack machine at the top of these stairs because they're so damn heavy

[19:06] So that is where I'm at

[19:08] I'm waiting like the rest of you to see what happens with these games

[19:13] King Kong is not a dream theme for me

[19:16] Harry Potter is also not a dream theme

[19:20] Pokemon is not a dream theme. I was born in 1976

[19:24] I grew up with stuff in the 80s and 90s

[19:28] Those are the things that I have the strongest affinity for so more stuff like diehard and karate kid

[19:36] Less stuff like Pokemon and Harry Potter

[19:39] You know, I like stuff like John Wick, but it doesn't last the test of time like Predator does

[19:44] I would also love total recall. You know what pin I think would be amazing

[19:49] I think Arnold Schwarzenegger is the running man out of all of his movies

[19:54] The running man as a storyline would be the best for pinball

[19:59] And you know how in that movie they shoot them out in those like steel sleds

[20:03] It's like they're getting fired into the play field, you know in a wire form sort of contraption

[20:09] That's how the movie puts the running man into the game. It's perfect for pinball. It's time to start

[20:19] I

[20:27] Your marks get sent killian I'll be back

[20:38] Only in a rerun

[20:49] I

[20:59] Want more of that stuff

[21:01] Stuff like goonies in gremlins. Yeah, I get excited about them like Beetlejuice. Yeah, but they're not dream themes for me

[21:08] I don't go back and watch the goonies. I haven't watched Beetlejuice over and over again back to the future

[21:16] Yes, you know what movie I would love two movies that I would love dream themes

[21:20] It would be up here Peewee's big adventure and

[21:23] Edward scissorhands. I know I know I know what you're saying

[21:27] But trust me Edward scissorhands a world under glass is

[21:31] Perfect the soundtrack the game all the moments in that movie. I've seen that movie like a hundred two and our time

[21:37] Same thing with Peewee's big adventure

[21:40] You know, it's just stuff like that

[21:43] Maybe stuff like the AT

[21:45] You know, there's a lot there is a lot to choose from when you're thinking 80s 90s nostalgia for somebody like me

[21:54] Super Mario Brothers. Yeah, maybe right. Maybe if done right

[21:58] But again, that's where I'm at in a week in which I'm waiting for all these new games to come out

[22:03] Kind of getting over GNR. I think the game does stuff so well

[22:07] I just think the design and the layout for this game isn't working for me

[22:12] I think they over complicated the gameplay with all the patches and it's just not fun or rewarding

[22:19] There's too much in it and it saddens me because what they got from slash if they had laid out

[22:26] GNR with a better layout and also

[22:31] Allowed you to experience more of what's amazing in the game. See sometimes less is more if there was less stuff going on

[22:40] Less multi balls less patches less all of that crap

[22:45] Then you could focus more on the magical elements that are in the game

[22:50] I even think two less shots would have been better

[22:53] I don't even think the upper right flipper and that orbit shot. That's very clunky

[22:58] I don't even think it's fun

[23:00] So I would have rather had Eric remove that shot and just make the game a little bit more wide open a little bit faster

[23:08] A little bit more fun. I mean look how good the upper right flipper shot is in Elton John

[23:14] It is one of the most satisfying shots in all of pinball history

[23:19] And then you look at the upper right flipper shot in GNR and it's one of the worst and clunky is shots in pinball

[23:26] It just it's crazy to me right to flippers in almost the same exact position and one delivers

[23:33] Satisfaction and one delivers frustration. That's what's interesting about pinball. That's why I love pinball

[23:39] I can't wait to see what Elwin does with Kong what Minier does with Harry Potter

[23:45] What pinball brothers do with predator what barrels of fun does with something like I don't know dune or whatever

[23:52] Everybody it's about to get real. Thank you for being a club member. Happy Friday

[23:56] I think we got few days and then we're gonna get real news. It's coming soon

[24:00] Hang in there everybody hang in there. Canada'd have some whiskey drink some sake. Don't get rid of GNR

[24:06] Just yet. I will say I was happy to see there are no GNR Cees for sale on pinside right now

[24:12] So I might have to put this thing up

[24:14] You can have number 500 out of 500 even though they wrote it as 400 then crossed out before and put a five

[24:21] Really embarrassing Jersey Jack, Canada out

[24:26] Just about to burst

[24:29] There's a quest for answers and unquenchable thirst

[24:34] In the darkest night

[24:36] Rising like a spider

[24:38] In the burning heart the unmistakable thirst

[24:42] In the burning heart

[24:45] Just about to burst

[24:47] There's a quest for answers and unquenchable thirst

[24:52] In the darkest night

[24:54] Rising like a spider

[24:57] In the burning heart the unmistakable thirst

[25:19] In the burning heart

[25:24] In the burning heart
