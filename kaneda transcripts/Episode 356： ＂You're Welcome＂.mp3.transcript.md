[00:00] Let's start this show by hearing from some of Canadian Pimball podcasts, most avid listeners,

[00:06] and let's hear their feedback on the show.

[00:08] So, Gorilla Biscuits had this to say, it's definitely possible to love something and

[00:14] still be a narcissistic sociopath.

[00:16] I love Pimball too, but seriously, F this guy.

[00:21] Dave H. chimed in with, I've never been mad at him, but he is a bit of a jerk.

[00:26] He violated Pinside rules many times, and the mod staff gave him many chances to stop

[00:32] breaking the rules, but he was unable to.

[00:35] Then Cube Snake had this to say, people like him tend to have severe social, personal issues.

[00:42] Meds don't help.

[00:44] He has one thing going for him in his mania, and that is his stick to it, Ibnis.

[00:51] He applies that to his podcasts.

[00:53] I have no problem with him or his cast, but I cannot unsee the underlying issues this man

[01:00] has.

[01:01] 27D NAS said, but mainly it's evident that he doesn't really like Pimball for the game.

[01:08] In fact, he routinely ignores the fact that Pimball is at its core a game that revolves

[01:16] around scoring, and finally our biggest fan, Pimball Gizard says, add that to the fact

[01:22] that he is clearly a self-absorbed narcissist who has to drop comments about the cool cars

[01:29] he owns or how he goes to exclusive New York parties, and I'm just not interested.

[01:36] Lastly, he has a serious problem with correctly pronouncing English words, which is a pretty

[01:43] big issue for a podcast.

[01:45] Well gentlemen, thank you for listening to every single episode of Canadian Pimball

[01:50] Podcast, and I dedicate this intro song to all of you out there.

[02:13] You say frustrating, you say console, I say console, let's call the whole thing off

[02:23] people.

[02:24] Welcome to episode like 356 of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[02:28] I'm your host, Canadian.

[02:31] What is the big deal about this Canadian guy?

[02:34] Can we go dig up information to once again try and have the same conversation we keep

[02:39] having over and over and over again?

[02:41] Look, this is the deal.

[02:43] This is the deal that nobody wants to admit.

[02:46] When I was banned from Pinside, when Robin was like no more, we will banish you from this

[02:52] forum.

[02:53] This is actually what happened.

[02:54] I'm going to use a little quote from a famous pop culture scene and tell me this is not

[02:59] what happened three years ago when I was struck down by Robin.

[03:02] If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

[03:09] You should not have come back.

[03:17] Oh my God.

[03:20] Alright, I kid a little bit, but I did find it funny that people are accusing me of not

[03:25] liking Pimball because I don't understand the fundamentals that the game is about scoring.

[03:30] I get that the game is about scoring, but that's like saying the point of a car is about

[03:35] going from A to B. Alright, after that fact, don't you want to have a lot more of a visceral

[03:41] experience with the automobile?

[03:43] Some people do, some people don't.

[03:46] The other thing is this.

[03:48] The reason why I want to do this sort of quick podcast this morning is I want to just clarify

[03:53] that I'm an individual that may change his mind.

[03:57] That's what it's called being a human being and your opinions might change on something.

[04:03] Just because I say something on this show one week doesn't mean like two months from

[04:08] now, I'm not going to change my opinion about a game.

[04:12] Now, see here's the thing.

[04:13] I'm not a politician people.

[04:15] I'm not here to win your vote and promise you that I'm going to change the nation and

[04:20] here are the things I'm going to do when I take office and then I flip flop on those

[04:25] things when I take office.

[04:27] This is a pinball podcast.

[04:29] Some of you need to stop getting so upset about that fact.

[04:32] It's a pinball podcast.

[04:34] Absolutely nothing is at stake.

[04:37] Absolutely no money is going my way.

[04:39] I have no power to make decisions with these manufacturers.

[04:43] Every single thing that happens in this industry is out of my control.

[04:47] Okay, I'm not going to, I can't get someone fired.

[04:50] I can't get someone like in trouble at the end of the day, right?

[04:54] I love saying at the end of the day because I know pisses some of you off.

[04:57] But ultimately all of these companies are in control of their own destinies.

[05:02] It's not me, right?

[05:04] I didn't put the artwork on October Fest.

[05:06] I didn't make the pie to the Caribbean code so confusing.

[05:09] I didn't decide to make Willy Wonka code, you know, not mode bays.

[05:13] I didn't do any of that stuff.

[05:15] I didn't use Photoshop, drag and drop artwork in alien.

[05:18] I didn't make, you know, bury and yop, take your money and then not give you a product.

[05:23] All I do is I comment on what I see happening in the hobby.

[05:29] Now my opinion changing, I love the fact that people think you can't have an opinion that

[05:35] would change and especially in this hobby because we all know in Pimball, here's the thing

[05:40] that changes over time.

[05:41] The actual game itself because there is no other hobby in which the product that you are

[05:48] being asked to buy goes through so many different evolution stages, right?

[05:54] Evolutionary stages.

[05:55] So remember Batman 66 when we first saw it, it was probably one of the worst coded games

[06:01] ever revealed to the public and now it's one of the best games Stern has ever made.

[06:06] And I went from being down on Batman saying how stupid you would be to buy one to owning

[06:11] one because guess what happened in that two year period?

[06:15] You know, the game became great.

[06:17] So am I not allowed to change my opinion about Batman?

[06:19] I need to maintain my pinball podcasting credibility at all costs and that means that I can't

[06:26] change my mind.

[06:27] Get out of here with that kind of ridiculousness.

[06:29] That's so silly.

[06:31] Okay.

[06:32] And Willie Wanken now is now this dark cloud that hangs over me because I shot the game.

[06:37] I love the game.

[06:38] I think it's one of the most beautiful shooting Pimball machines ever.

[06:41] You know what?

[06:42] It's not just me who says that.

[06:44] And every single podcaster, every single streamer who played Willie Wanken that first week

[06:49] before the rest of you, listen to all of our feedback.

[06:52] It's very similar.

[06:53] And that is because the game is probably one of Pat Lawler's greatest shooting games ever.

[06:58] The geometry in that game is phenomenal.

[07:00] It's better than any Stern I've played ever in terms of geometry.

[07:05] It's better than any Jersey Jack game I've played in terms of geometry.

[07:08] So I fell in love with the way the game shot and I got really excited.

[07:12] Okay.

[07:13] But is that all that makes a Pimball machine great?

[07:16] Did I have enough time on it to know that the code was going to be what you wanted in the game

[07:21] and what I wanted in the game?

[07:22] No, of course not.

[07:24] So then here's the funny part.

[07:26] Am I then not allowed to tell you that I'm starting to have some second thoughts on where

[07:32] this game is going?

[07:34] So should I not do that?

[07:36] See, Jack brought me into Jersey Jack.

[07:38] Pimball Jack is a really nice guy.

[07:40] Jack is a really class act.

[07:43] He is and Jack runs like a family organization.

[07:47] And so when I go over there and I play the machine and he gives me early access and I come

[07:52] back and I gush about how excited I was, I'm totally fine with that.

[07:56] Now if I start to see the game develop in a way that I don't think is the way Willy

[08:01] Wanker should have been coded and developed, what do you think I should do?

[08:06] See, most people wouldn't come out and just tell you exactly my concerns because they

[08:11] would worry about a couple of things.

[08:13] They would worry about being seen as a hypocrite and losing credibility on the show.

[08:17] Here's the thing, I don't care about that.

[08:19] This show has never been about that.

[08:20] If I feel a certain way about something or my mind changes, I'm going to tell you that

[08:24] and I'm going to share that with you immediately.

[08:26] I'm not going to hold back.

[08:27] But here's the biggest thing that people always worry about.

[08:30] They worry about if they say how they really feel, whether it's about a game, whether it's

[08:36] about a code in the game, whether it's about the artwork on a game, whether it's about

[08:40] the manufacturers like marketing strategy, so many people out there are worried about one

[08:46] thing.

[08:47] They're worried about falling out with those manufacturers and those individuals behind

[08:52] the game.

[08:53] They still want to maintain a relationship so they can't really tell you how they really

[08:56] feel.

[08:57] What they do do, and you hear this all the time on other shows, they kind of waffle back

[09:01] and forth and you don't really know what they're saying and they're kind of like, it's

[09:05] like they're struggling to push out what they really feel and you never really get what

[09:09] they really feel.

[09:11] Where on this show, I'm just going to tell you straight up, if Willie Wonk is not a mode

[09:14] based game, I think that's a terrible mistake to code it that way.

[09:17] If I don't see the movie clips with the audio, I think that's a big mistake.

[09:21] And guess what?

[09:22] I think a lot of you feel the same way.

[09:23] Now see, the thing is people don't want to say that because then they don't want to fall

[09:26] out of favor with Jersey Jack and Joe Katz and Pat Lawler because they need to get

[09:32] Joe Katz and Pat Lawler and Jersey Jack on their shows.

[09:35] And so as I've always said on this show, I don't really care if giving you what I feel

[09:42] is my opinion, if delivering you what I feel is the truth of what I see in this situation,

[09:48] alright, there's no ultimate truth in Pimbal.

[09:51] I am not going to sacrifice my ability to be me because I want to maintain those relationships

[09:58] to get those people on my show because then I don't even think this show is worth listening

[10:03] to if I just have people come on and give you the talking points on their game.

[10:09] And so this is why this show is this show and look, nobody, nobody makes you listen to

[10:13] Canadian Spinball podcasts, nobody, nobody.

[10:17] And yet so many of you out there who claim to listen to every show and they are listening

[10:20] to everyone and you such a jerk, well why do you listen?

[10:23] Why do you spend an hour or half hour of your day listening to something you can't stand

[10:27] unless there's some element that is at least entertaining or insightful or provocative

[10:34] or thought-provoking that you get out of the show.

[10:37] And the thing about all the people out there who are very vocal about my medical condition

[10:42] that can't be cured with meds has those gentlemen to do a show to pick up a mic, to say

[10:48] something, maybe they don't have it, maybe they don't have it in them, but whatever, whatever.

[10:52] So this show continues to do what we do.

[10:54] And I think you saw in the last episode with G, G, I can't even talk.

[11:00] How can you do a podcast when you can't talk?

[11:02] And you see, I don't edit that out.

[11:03] Like I just leave it in there.

[11:05] So what?

[11:06] I enunciate some words poorly.

[11:07] So what?

[11:08] I'm human.

[11:09] Oh, you guys out there.

[11:10] You just have a mastery of the English language and I just, how can you do a podcast without

[11:15] his ability to enunciate?

[11:16] Anyway, I don't edit stuff out.

[11:18] You get to hear my mistakes.

[11:20] You get to hear it because you know what?

[11:21] That's who I am.

[11:22] I'm a flawed human being.

[11:24] And those of you out there who are not, congratulations, you figured it out.

[11:28] Alright, so when we interviewed Jerry at P3, what do you think of that interview?

[11:33] Well luckily for me, some of you chimed in and told me what you thought of that interview

[11:37] and I want to actually air some of you, someone gave me an audio clip which I always love.

[11:41] Brian Albert, thank you for sending this in.

[11:43] I haven't even heard it yet.

[11:44] I'm going to play it right now.

[11:46] Listen as you hear it and then give my feedback on it.

[11:49] Let's play it right now.

[11:51] Hey Chris, just your latest episode about the P3 Multimorphic gaming platform and I had

[11:57] some interesting thoughts about it and I might share them with you.

[12:01] The first thing is, I think that P3 Multimorphic is actually a machine that can give people

[12:08] exactly what they're not allowed to have or what they can't attain.

[12:12] In other words, obviously Harry Potter will never be made into a pinball and if it ever

[12:16] is, it's going to be a mint to buy.

[12:19] Why can't he have outside designers, just like the virtual pinball cabinets where you

[12:26] can download outside designers games and put them into your virtual pinball cabinet, like

[12:32] the memes.

[12:33] I know a lot of arcade game memes that you can just get for free online.

[12:40] Why not do that?

[12:41] That way the P3 Multimorphic can actually give people what they're never allowed to have

[12:46] or can't have.

[12:48] You get the best of both worlds.

[12:49] You get to have an actual real pinball machine and you get to have the virtual pinball machine

[12:57] in your machine as basically take the virtual elements of that or take the physical elements

[13:04] of the pinball machine and make them onto the Multimorphic platform.

[13:09] Then that way you could have the best of both worlds.

[13:11] You could have basically a machine.

[13:13] The legalities of that may be problematic but I don't think that if he sells a P3 format

[13:20] and then they download whatever content they do onto it, I don't think there's anything

[13:24] that they can do about it, especially since it's a home use only and nobody's paying to

[13:31] use it.

[13:32] It's not out on location where they're putting money into it.

[13:35] That was the first thought I had.

[13:36] The second thing I also had to kind of tie us into this whole entire thing would be the

[13:40] virtual pinball, just as like Zen pinball.

[13:44] Why don't they approach them and ask them to make some games for his P3 Multimorphic

[13:52] platform?

[13:53] That might work for him and it would make a lot of people happy because you're getting

[13:58] again, you would get a physical pinball game out of a virtual pinball atmosphere.

[14:10] I think there's two could marry up very well.

[14:12] Anyway, thanks for listening.

[14:14] Bye-bye.

[14:15] All right, Brian, you got it out.

[14:17] Brian's two points were, could the platform be developed for by people who could actually

[14:23] put IP like Harry Potter onto the platform and almost like, I think you were talking about

[14:30] like main cabinets in video games where you don't have permission from the IP holder,

[14:36] but you make it, you make it free to download and people can play Harry Potter.

[14:39] The second point being, why doesn't Zen pinball put themselves onto the P3 platform?

[14:45] Well, let me go and reverse orders.

[14:46] So Zen pinball, why would they bother?

[14:49] Like why would they bother doing what why would they bother doing that?

[14:53] It makes absolutely no sense because they would have to like re-engineer their game because

[14:56] it wouldn't make sense putting the Zen pinball experience onto P3 because it because how

[15:03] do you have to then recode the entire Zen pinball thing because in the Zen pinball game, you

[15:08] see the flippers, you see the sling shots.

[15:11] It would be really weird if those things were also on top of the screen with physical flippers

[15:17] and sling shots and stuff like that.

[15:18] So I don't think there's, see that's the thing is there's absolutely no incentive for

[15:21] anyone who's doing anything successful in pinball to say, you know what, let's move our

[15:26] successful approach to pinball onto this platform which hasn't even sold like 100 units.

[15:32] Like Zen pinball, I bet they have hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions of people

[15:38] who play Zen pinball games, hence the reason why they get some of the coolest properties.

[15:43] And so there's absolutely no incentive for them to do that.

[15:46] As far as Harry Potter and porting stuff over, they would absolutely get sued, they would

[15:52] get a cease and desist.

[15:54] There's no way that that would ever happen.

[15:58] The amount of effort it would go into doing it because think about it too, Brian, the

[16:01] effort it would go into making a Harry Potter pinball machine experience on a P3 work is

[16:06] a lot of effort and then someone has to do all that effort for no money.

[16:11] And so then, and then you're doing all that effort for no money and then what you're doing

[16:15] is also illegal.

[16:16] So then it can be shut down at any moment's notice.

[16:21] And if P3 was like the, you know, the carrier of all these illegal IP games, they're running

[16:28] on fumes basically financially.

[16:30] They could not afford a lawsuit from a major studio if it was found out that they were

[16:35] allowing people to play pirated versions of their franchise on a pinball platform.

[16:40] Okay.

[16:41] So that's what Brian said.

[16:43] So Brian, again, I hate to shoot down your dreams on that stuff, but I think that's

[16:46] the reality.

[16:47] All right.

[16:48] I got an email from Ben Crane.

[16:50] P3 interview.

[16:51] He says, Chris, I listened to your interview with Jerry at P3 and he seemed to respond to

[16:55] some of the points in my email.

[16:57] I do have a lot of respect for Jerry, his P rock board and his passion for the hobby.

[17:02] I originally wrote the email because I felt Jerry was blind to the issues with the platform

[17:07] and seemed to lack any insight on why it appeals to very few buyers.

[17:12] And I hope it would be kind of a wake up call to make the game into something that would

[17:16] be more popular.

[17:18] A nicer way to make my point might have been to say that most of us don't care about

[17:22] innovation in pinball.

[17:24] We just want something that works and is fun.

[17:28] Jerry clearly loves the innovation aspect of it and really enjoys developing the game.

[17:33] I'm glad he is following his passion, but I don't know if it is possible to educate

[17:40] people one why something should be fun.

[17:44] The idea of swappable games within a single cabinet isn't a new one.

[17:48] It came with pinball 2000, highway did it and virtual pinball machines do it.

[17:53] Pinball 2000 is probably the closest to the P3 and it has an age well because it is

[17:59] difficult to maintain and there are no a list games made for the platform.

[18:04] Jerry makes analogies to video game councils.

[18:08] But for a new one to catch on, it has to have at least one game that people really want

[18:14] to have.

[18:15] Jerry seems to understand this at some level and I hope the next game is something that

[18:19] gets me and others want to buy into his platform.

[18:24] The other point that was never mentioned on the podcast is the platform isn't reliable

[18:28] or polished enough for most to want to invest in it at this point.

[18:32] I played one at a show within the past year and it was having issues with rebooting during

[18:37] the game which sucked any joy out of playing it.

[18:41] One that was streamed a while ago also suffered from rebooting during games and other technical

[18:46] problems.

[18:47] One is on route at Buffalo Billiards in Austin, Texas a few miles from the P3 factory.

[18:52] I decided to give it a chance and went to play it a couple weeks ago but it wasn't working.

[18:57] My experience with the platform has not been a positive one and I've tried and I'm willing

[19:02] to try it again but there are a few opportunities.

[19:06] It has flippers, so the flippers are the most reliable in the industry.

[19:10] Why does the $750 replacement sold on his website say keep a spare assembly on hand for

[19:17] quickly replacing worn and dirty assemblies on location or during parties?

[19:22] I really want to play the version of the game that Jerry is passionate about but I feel

[19:25] there is a huge disconnect between the game many of us have experienced and what he describes.

[19:32] I genuinely hope he can fix the issues with the platform.

[19:35] Simply discounting the issues as problems with other people's perception probably won't

[19:40] be successful.

[19:41] Alright, so I think Ben you hit the nail on the head right there.

[19:44] I think this whole thing comes down to me is it's like Jerry's waiting for people to

[19:49] see what he sees in his own platform.

[19:53] The last five years of Pimbal have seen monumental growth in Pimbal, monumental growth and

[20:00] he's basically looking at this like well even though all that growth is happening a dark

[20:08] day is going to come and when that dark day comes across Pimbal then people will finally

[20:13] realize that P3 is the answer for them and I just I can't shake this feeling that he's

[20:20] not going to find the answer he's looking for with that strategy because people are telling

[20:26] us what they want.

[20:27] You know ultimately the consumers and the marketplace determines what they deem to be the product

[20:34] they're looking for and they're not looking for swappable Pimbal platforms and we've seen

[20:40] it so many times and what they're looking for is just an amazing game.

[20:45] Yeah, yeah Jerry if you make an amazing game that people really want to own you have

[20:49] to start there and then yeah if you can swap in another amazing game into the platform

[20:54] okay I'll start to consider it but for that to happen what that would require is two

[21:00] amazing games right I need to feel like I can have two amazing games on this platform

[21:05] because then it starts to make somewhat just somewhat of financial financial like sense

[21:13] think about it because if I buy a Stern pro and it's great and it's fifty five hundred

[21:18] bucks I'm having a ton of fun all right P3 is ten thousand dollars so by the time I

[21:25] buy one P3 I can buy two Stern pros by the time I buy P3 and two games additionally at

[21:33] twenty five hundred bucks a pop I'm at fifteen thousand dollars all in on this and the part

[21:39] that Jerry doesn't realize I think with this platform is this is people are not going to

[21:44] trade games like they trade video games it's it's just not that practical to tell so then

[21:50] what is a used what what is a used like cosmic cart racing game what is it worth like who

[21:57] who you have to then find someone who has another P3 platform who then wants to use

[22:03] version of cosmic cart racing you then have to box it up somehow you then have to get

[22:08] it to them you you then have to like figure out how much you're going to charge for it

[22:13] it just seems like such a hassle doesn't it I mean it just it this is not simple and the

[22:18] thing about video games Jerry you know we've stopped trading video games like people this

[22:23] now it's all downloadable games nobody's trading CDs anymore so the market has moved on

[22:28] from all of that ultimately if you really wanted to make it a platform that was similar

[22:33] to video games it would be one machine and you would just download new games to it but

[22:38] then then you're just back at where we are with virtual pinball right you can't do that

[22:41] with physical mechanisms sitting over the game I mean you could do it but then every

[22:46] game would be the same every time from a shot geometry standpoint and how boring would

[22:51] that get so I don't know I don't know I'm trying to see trying to see if there's a way

[22:56] out of this but I kind of think it's going to be a really big uphill battle all right

[23:01] I got an email from BB I listened to your Jerry podcast and I had to send this because

[23:07] I like the guy and he's incredibly smart but he's just missing the obvious answer to

[23:13] why p3 isn't working it's not fun period I ended up playing cosmic racing recently and

[23:21] before that the Lucy game and I agree with him that it's incredibly innovative it works

[23:26] like a pinball game and it operates like a pinball game but the problem is the game isn't

[23:31] fun I don't care if they got the hottest IP in the world and it has the best story with

[23:36] great world under glass it's just not a fun platform my advice he needs to make the

[23:43] play field more packed with real tangible mechanical toys and make the balance much more mechanical

[23:50] than just video production which it seems to be favoring now the animations and graphics

[23:56] also need to be greatly improved as right now it screams cell phone quality you mentioned

[24:01] halo in your podcast and that's a good point but it's not the IP it's the fact halo is

[24:08] a great video game that is fun my concern with p3 is that the pf the play field appears

[24:14] so barren based on the video game play field that is just boring it doesn't feel good

[24:19] either which is a killer I really like Jerry I want to see him succeed but it's not something

[24:25] that can be resolved with an IP and a cohesive story all right and that was from BB thank

[24:31] you BB BB BB eight is a BB eight from Star Wars who sent this look I mean fun is a subjective

[24:37] thing I've played p3 and I've had fun on it I'm not going to lie I've had fun I like

[24:43] some of the player versus player games that Jerry has it's not fun for me it's not the

[24:47] fun issue that's the problem I mean I think for most of us flipping different pinball

[24:51] machines and experiencing different pinball innovations is always fun on a level but I do

[24:57] agree that you know it it definitely is polarizing and so then you have a platform in which

[25:02] some people might walk up to it and just the platform itself the way the ball is rolling

[25:07] over the screen itself you know those elevated flippers and all that stuff just might be

[25:12] a turn off the some and and that's my whole point is always been why take the risk why

[25:17] take the risk when you know you have 30 40 years of market research that tells you that people

[25:23] like it this way and then you want to go do something completely different you just run the risk

[25:27] of eliminating people all right I got an email where the subject head is location code hey Chris

[25:33] I listen to your podcast about location code I've got a couple of games at home and I think

[25:37] you're missing the mark a bit Willie Wonka is a really good diversification strategy for JJP

[25:44] they have two super long playing games they needed something that played shorter and not as deep

[25:50] when you've got hobbitin was as two of your four games shorter is important I'm a big fan of

[25:57] shorter games in general I love being able to go down to my basement and bang out five games in

[26:02] 15 minutes before leaving for work or in between things with the kids it also makes my kiddos

[26:09] more likely to play with me if they're down there and I've got a game that they're waiting for

[26:13] their turn they lose interest Greg Greg well first of all thank you for for listening and for writing

[26:19] and it's interesting that you say that you know Jersey Jack does need a shorter ball time game in

[26:24] their lineup now I do think you can get both though I think you can get a game that's not super long

[26:31] in terms of ball times but also still still code in the game all of the iconic scenes from the

[26:38] movie that we want right and I think I look at Batman 66 as a good example it's not an incredibly

[26:43] long ball time game but it can be if you have a great game but most of the games I have on Batman

[26:49] are very short but that being said it is not without everything I want to see in the code see

[26:55] that's my issue with Willie Wonka it's like right now I'm it's it's not that I I'm not praising them

[27:00] for making a shorter ball time game it's that they're leaving stuff out and I think for people that

[27:06] are good at pinball let's say you have a five ten minute game of Wonka you do want to see know

[27:12] that there's just stuff in that game that makes you want to go deep into the game and you know and

[27:18] that's just we'll see how it plays out I also think and and I'm just going to say this I'm just

[27:23] going to say this at the prices that Jersey Jack is charging I don't see them as ever making like a

[27:30] TNA or a black night kind of game I don't think they can just make a fast brutal like quick game

[27:37] that is like meant just for speed and brutality that's not Jersey Jack's style Jersey Jack to me

[27:44] feels more about like full featured games that are deep that have a lot of mechanical stuff on them

[27:51] and are truly heavily immersive experiences and it's I'm okay with that because you know I don't

[27:59] think anyone out there only buys Jersey Jack games and is looking for that simple Jersey Jack game I

[28:05] think if we've heard anything from people with Wonka it's their disappointment in what's not in the

[28:10] game not excited that it's going to be a faster JJP experience so that's just my take on it we'll

[28:16] see how things pan out we've got some months to go people that's the other part is it's all let's

[28:21] all just remind ourselves that these things are not going to be resolved anytime soon I mean when

[28:26] is Wonka code going to be done and I don't think it's going to be done until like July August at the

[28:30] earliest all right is there any news we've been missing on the show so there's not that much news

[28:36] it's kind of getting bleak in the world of pinball news lately but I did see that on this weekend

[28:41] pinball pinball circus is announcing that Kingpin is still in pre-production they are waiting for

[28:48] parts to come in I think if they can get this game out hopefully sometime by the end of the year

[28:53] that's what they're aiming for to have multiple versions of the game at expo this year in October

[28:59] so that is still happening and then they're going to use hopefully the money to finish Python

[29:05] Angelo's circus Maximus game is that the name of it I think it is all right so we'll see this game

[29:11] sort of been around for a while I really think American pinball just needs to pick up this title

[29:16] and make it they would be able to sell a few hundred if not a thousand or so Kingpins the game is

[29:22] really neat it's a it's a it's an amazing part of pinball history and it's a game that I think

[29:28] they should remake but I also think they should redo the artwork on it they actually let us know

[29:32] that the original cabinet artwork was supposed to be different and the I guess the actor in the artwork

[29:37] did not want to be on the pinball cabinet or something like that but I would man I would go get like

[29:42] a francey or a yeti and get them to do an amazing like Dick Tracy looking art package on Kingpin

[29:49] I mean it just begs to be Dick Tracy I would redeem it Dick Tracy if I were them all right what

[29:54] else is going on so congratulations to Keith L win for winning the New York City pinball championship

[30:01] this past weekend I did not appear it seemed like everything went off without a hitch it's great

[30:08] seeing those those guys at the top of the leaderboard it's always the same kind of guys but you know

[30:13] it sounds like it was it was a good run and Keith congratulations I want to say congrats to

[30:20] Ed Robertson for being on the late show with Stephen Colbert did you guys see that he was singing

[30:24] the Big Bang Big Bang Theory theme song I know the show is come the came to an end I think it was

[30:30] last week that was really cool seeing Ed up there just neat singing a guy that we just see hanging

[30:35] out at pinball shows a big pinhead up on national TV singing his song I mean to have a hit song

[30:42] on a hit TV show that is syndicated forever God that's just the golden goose that keeps on laying

[30:48] the golden egg but Ed awesome loves seeing you up there brother what else Nate shivers of coast to

[30:54] coast pinball has announced that he is on an indefinite hiatus sort of his he put up a show that

[31:01] was basically saying the show is kind of coming to an end and he talks about how you know he had

[31:07] been doing the show for years and what led him to do the show and you know me I mean I've always

[31:12] said this I grew up in this hobby and Nate shivers was the podcast that I listened to Nate shivers

[31:19] was the guy that I couldn't wait to get a new episode from him and I would go to bed almost every

[31:26] week listening to a new episode of coast to coast pinball and back then there were hardly any pinball

[31:31] podcasts so it was always a treat when Nate put up a new show you know I've always said that Nate

[31:38] inspired me to do this show and what's always inspired me about Nate show is a few things and

[31:43] in the direction he he showed me was you know he just shows his passion for pinball and I think I

[31:48] hope you get that out of this show he was also a one man show it was always just Nate I felt like I

[31:54] knew Nate I felt like I was stepping into Nate's world and I hope you guys feel like you're stepping

[31:59] into Chris and canate his world we are one person but I hope you feel that way and you you get a

[32:04] little bit of a connection when it's just one on one with a listener and and the podcaster and

[32:10] you know I always love the way Nate did his segments I love the way he covered the news you know

[32:15] at there was a point at the end where Nate got really into pinball tournaments and competitive play

[32:19] and that's cool and and people who are into competitive play they they love the fact that he

[32:24] covered that more and more you know me I'm not a competitive pinball player I do love pinball but

[32:29] I just don't want to spend that much time in the competitive circuit and I think even Nate says

[32:34] it when you go into that circuit and you get into that circle the amount of time you begin to

[32:41] allocate to pinball it does start to take over more and more of your life and and that's the other

[32:46] thing you know when I when I see people say all these nasty things about me all these incredibly

[32:51] cruel things about me on on pinsided and we know where I can't defend myself and the one thing I

[32:57] do have issue with is when they challenge my my love of the hobby when they challenge the fact

[33:04] that they think I'm not passionate about pinball or even when they say I don't know anything about

[33:09] pinball so I think it's safe to say that all of you you and me anyone who reads pinside anyone who

[33:14] goes to pinball shows we all know more than 99% of people in the pinball world okay and then

[33:21] challenging someone's passion on pinball is a weird thing to challenge I don't think you do

[33:26] 356 podcasts about pinball because you're not passionate about it all right the other thing is this

[33:34] this always makes me laugh is when people are like you got banned from clove and banned from

[33:39] pinside and and that goes to show what kind of terrible human being you are and I just want to say

[33:45] for all you clowns out there that think being part of an internet forum is an indicator of what a

[33:52] swell person you are or your true colors in life it's not these forums exist for us to shoot the

[34:00] crap about the things we're into whether it's cars watches pinball cigars well you name it and

[34:07] getting banned from certain forms it's not this you know it's not a telltale sign that you're

[34:12] going to become a serial killer one day and and I'll tell you this the forms I've been banned from

[34:18] look I'm banned from the Dodge demon form you know why I'm banned from the Dodge demon forum

[34:23] because I don't think the Dodge demon is the greatest car ever made it's amazing I love mine

[34:29] but whenever you would question the car itself the moderators would ban people you could only say

[34:37] positive things about the car or you couldn't say anything at all now look they're they are trying

[34:43] to prevent people like from the Chevy forums and the Ford forum from coming in and trolling the

[34:49] Dodge demon form but to be banned from the demon form and you own a demon it just goes to show

[34:55] that look there's just some moderators out there that they want to control the message they want

[34:59] everything to be said the way they want it said and you know look I'm not banned on the Ford

[35:06] Shelby GT500 forum and I talk crap about that car all the time and brag about the demon because

[35:11] those guys are cool dudes they realize we're all just grown men talking about something stupid like

[35:16] muscle cars right so look it doesn't matter it doesn't matter and then I love to and they're like oh

[35:22] we but he created shill accounts and he came into pinside within the dark of night and he misled

[35:28] us into thinking he was somebody else and we can't have that and I just want everyone for a minute

[35:33] to stop and think for a moment what harm would come if someone came onto pinside under a

[35:40] different name and started posting what what what what crime is being committed against humanity when

[35:48] that occurs and I love it I love it when people act like you have to be this avatar forever and if

[35:55] you try to mislead us and sit and again go back and look at all of the things I've ever said there

[36:01] and the main point that I think my fans always bring up is this is there's nothing I ever said

[36:07] on pinside that wise snow and oric and iceman and all you know hoody all the other guys owed in all

[36:16] the other like you know we're like a little circle of like very very active like vocal members of

[36:21] the community there was nothing I said that was any different than any of the stuff that all

[36:26] those other hyper members posted and said about games and yes there was a double standard we had

[36:33] to get Chris off the site he was just too much to take and it's fine as I said this is a much

[36:38] better medium for me you know and I think you guys are benefiting from it and we'll we'll continue

[36:44] to do it this way and you know we'll continue to say how we feel about pinball companies and

[36:48] manufacturers and and we'll leave it at that right so this has been episode 356 of Canadian

[36:55] pinball podcast I had a great interview with Neil now Neil is the guy who created pinquest

[37:00] there's a story on this week in pinball about pinquest and it's a really interesting

[37:05] concept of trying to make location play a little bit different for people and create miniature quest

[37:12] that people can do on machines on location and I'm going to air that interview hopefully in

[37:18] the next few days I'm also going to be traveling maybe in the next few days so if you don't hear

[37:23] from me don't worry none of the pinside haters who hates me took me out I didn't run out of my

[37:29] medication and go a wall I am simply traveling for work so it's Bubba's birthday today so make

[37:38] sure you wish Bubba happy birthday if you're not following Bubba he's the royal Bubba on Instagram

[37:44] and he loves all of you guys from the bottom of his heart and guess what so do I as much as you

[37:50] guys want to paint me out to be some bad guy I'm not we would all share a beer and chat pinball

[37:55] and have a great time I thank all of you for listening to every episode I know that some of you
