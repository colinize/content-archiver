[00:00] What I've been thinking is the thing I've reached my doom

[00:05] What I've been thinking is the same for you

[00:18] Hello! Can I please introduce myself? I'm a white male between the ages of 40 and 60

[00:25] and I spend all day long on a pinball message board complaining and crying about my pinball machine

[00:32] You know, the world doesn't understand my pain

[00:35] I spend $8,000 on this toy that is inconsequential to anything going on in the world

[00:42] and it's got ghosted inserts and I'm gonna go on this message board and I'm gonna rally up the mob and complain about this every single day

[00:52] and I won't even give the company a real chance to respond or make my situation correct

[00:58] I'm just gonna keep whining and moaning and complaining every single day, every hour I get because I am a pinside member

[01:09] Whaaat? Whaaat? I mean, that is what it's been like

[01:13] On this special edition of Canator's Pinball Podcast, enough is enough

[01:17] I woke up this morning and I read these comments by KPG

[01:24] and it's gotten to the point where we need to just hit pause and take a look at the reality of pinside

[01:32] and the way the bickering and the moaning and the mob mentality has completely, completely gotten out of hand

[01:39] and I wanna call out KPG here because this guy to me has done something that is so juvenile

[01:46] This is more than any baby behavior I've ever encountered on pinside

[01:52] I mean, we might as well send this guy a freaking diaper and a crib to his house

[01:58] because I've never seen more baby-like behavior

[02:01] So, look, for those of you who haven't been following this whole thing

[02:04] so KPG has a Ghostbusters Ellie that has ghosted inserts

[02:10] It has some chipping on the play field and he's been very vocal about it

[02:14] and I agree with him, like I'd be pissed off too

[02:17] If I had a new $8,000 Ghostbusters Ellie that had chipped play field issues

[02:22] and what happened? All of his images and all of his complaints worked

[02:27] They worked, he got Gary Stern himself to call KPG personally

[02:33] personally to talk to him about the issues and what Stern was gonna do to fix the problem

[02:39] and give him his personal cell phone number and he wrote that

[02:43] He shared that with the community and said, look, the main dog himself has reached out to me

[02:49] and then I wake up this morning and I read what he writes

[02:52] and I just want to read it for you guys because it's so fucking indicative of the way

[02:57] pin-side people think, the way pin-side people act

[03:00] and it's just gone to the point now where like pin-side people should be fucking ashamed of themselves

[03:05] for the way they behave

[03:07] and we need to stop allowing pin-side mentality to become the prevalent behavior

[03:13] of the entire hobby

[03:16] So I'm gonna pull it up right now, hold on a second, I gotta find it

[03:19] it's like it's on page 70 of Stern, are you serious?

[03:24] Alright, so it's on page 69 actually and he says he writes okay

[03:28] another update back to being pissed off at this situation

[03:31] so Trent gets back to me about this program in parentheses

[03:35] the program is, let's see if I can put this lightly, lame as fuck

[03:39] Trent said Stern is undergoing a review process of my play field

[03:43] and if approved for replacement they will send me an empty box that I will send my play field back to them

[03:47] where they swap all components to a new play field and then send it back

[03:51] Alright, so then Trent says, look you gotta give me the positive $5,000

[03:56] before when you send your play field back

[04:00] and like the reason we're doing this guys is because fucking people who had issues with ACDC play fields

[04:06] were getting sent new populated play fields from Stern

[04:10] and then selling the old play fields to people

[04:13] without seeing any money back

[04:16] okay but anyway, here's the thing and then he writes and then KPG writes what a goddamn joke

[04:21] and here's my issue with this whole thing and I hate it and I hate it and I think it's indicative of everything that's wrong with Pinside

[04:28] everything that's wrong with the way these people treat the companies who make pinball machines is KPG

[04:34] you get a call from Gary Stern who says I'm gonna make you right

[04:39] okay, we're gonna create a program that's gonna make people happy

[04:43] and then what do you do after you get Gary's personal phone call?

[04:47] after you get Gary's personal phone number you go and the first thing you do when you're upset about what you hear from Trent

[04:54] is you don't call up Gary and say hey Gary, Trent just told me this, what's the deal

[05:00] and then Gary could have explained to you, here's how we're doing it

[05:03] instead you run the Pinside, Call Stern's program lame is fuck

[05:09] and say how pissed you are, I can't even tell you guys that this is indicative of everything that's wrong with this entire fucking community

[05:21] and this is why the babies on Pinside continue to fucking think that they're special, that they're holier than whole

[05:28] and that they deserve some sort of special treatment, what more special treatment could you give a buyer

[05:35] than having the CEO of the company call you up and say he's gonna take care of your situation

[05:40] and for KPG to go on the Pinside and slam Stern say this whole deal is lame is fuck

[05:48] it's pathetic, it's pathetic, it shows no respect to Stern, no respect to Gary

[05:55] these guys are figuring it out and if you're not gonna let them figure it out

[06:00] then fuck you guys, seriously it's like this fucking pressure cooker environment

[06:05] where people just go on there and just whine and mow and bitch

[06:09] and they don't even give the company a chance to make a fix happen

[06:12] and here's a deal and so I did what you guys should do

[06:18] is I just asked around what's going on, what the fuck is going on

[06:22] and here's what's going on, Stern is fixing the fucking problem

[06:27] Stern has hit pause on the fucking assembly line and is finding out what the issue is

[06:33] and they seem like they know what the issue is and they're fixing it

[06:37] so that when the remainder of the LEDs go out and the premiums go out

[06:41] you guys are gonna have great fucking play fields

[06:44] alright, you're gonna have great fucking play fields

[06:47] but god damn it, give them some time to do it

[06:50] and I know it's like easy to be like oh well like they, they, how could this happen

[06:55] it's a fucking company guys, they vendor out the play fields to another organization

[07:02] and so what they get back a fucking subpar product

[07:05] you're gonna fucking slam them, what the fuck is wrong with this people

[07:08] and I love a fucking KPG is complaining that trend is asking for a check for $5,000 as collateral

[07:15] just to make sure Stern gets back the play field with issues

[07:19] after they send them the one that's fully populated

[07:22] I mean seriously, and then this guy is like showing pictures bragging how he has a McLaren

[07:28] with his wife with her breasts hanging out playing ghost busters

[07:33] you gotta, who needs to be protected here

[07:38] like Stern does because people fuck them over with the ACDC play fields

[07:44] and what's the big deal, it's not like you're not gonna get your money back

[07:47] like you're not gonna send freaking trend a check

[07:50] and you did everything that's part of the program

[07:53] you're not gonna get ripped off by Stern

[07:56] I just, I'm really just upset here, I'm really upset because I think Gary Stern did the right thing here

[08:00] I think Stern's trying to do the right thing but I hate it

[08:04] when companies try to do the right thing and they can't win with the fucking community

[08:09] that's filled with a bunch of fucking babies

[08:12] who spend all day long moaning and groaning

[08:15] and they don't even give the company a fucking chance to make it right

[08:18] Stern has always made it right

[08:21] so it's just so fucking annoying when I see these people

[08:25] just constantly slamming Stern when Gary and team are fucking doing what needs to be done

[08:30] and God forbid, God forbid Stern should freaking have delays to fix problems

[08:37] the way these people bitch and moan

[08:39] I ordered my game at Thrones Pro and it hasn't arrived yet

[08:44] and how is this possible?

[08:47] The world, you know why? Because Stern is fucking fixing issues

[08:51] and they're gonna have issues like everybody else

[08:54] and if you don't get your fucking pinball machine

[08:57] do you think you're not gonna get it from Stern?

[08:59] Do you think they're never gonna send it to you that you got ripped off?

[09:02] I mean for fuck's sake people give Stern a break

[09:05] and that's the other point I wanna make here

[09:07] is everyone needs to give Stern a fucking break here

[09:11] Stern deserves it

[09:13] and let's all be honest if it wasn't for Stern

[09:16] there wouldn't even be a pin fucking side

[09:19] let me repeat that if it wasn't for Stern pinball

[09:22] there wouldn't be a pin fucking side

[09:26] you guys wouldn't even have a place to go

[09:29] you think you'd be on there talking about monster bashes

[09:32] and fucking medieval manaces

[09:34] and all the fucking games from 20 years ago

[09:37] hell fucking no nobody would care

[09:40] Stern fucking carried this industry on their back

[09:44] on their back when it was ready to die

[09:47] it was ready to die

[09:49] I mean they were ready to get out of the industry a few years ago

[09:52] and now it's coming back because of them you fucking people

[09:57] so give them a fucking break

[10:00] when people say like I haven't had this problem

[10:02] with other Stern machines that's goddamn right

[10:05] they're going through a period where they have to fix something

[10:09] give them some breaks

[10:11] alright you fucking babies

[10:13] I'm so sick of hearing about it

[10:14] I'm so sick of hearing guys like rare hero

[10:16] fucking bitch and moan

[10:19] about the fucking coding ghost busters

[10:21] it's like a no win situation for this company

[10:24] you bitch and moan at the code is so incomplete

[10:27] that you buy a game and then there's nothing to do in it

[10:30] so they ship ghost busters with really complete code

[10:34] and then we've got this dingle berry

[10:36] fucking whining and moaning every fucking day

[10:39] about the ladder system of the code

[10:41] are you fucking serious man

[10:43] this is the way the game is

[10:46] it's a ladder system code development

[10:49] if you don't like it don't fucking buy it

[10:52] I'm so fucking happy

[10:54] that it's really hard to get the stay puff marshmallow man

[10:57] I like that

[10:59] I like it

[11:00] it's the fucking valenor of ghost busters

[11:03] and if you don't want it

[11:05] then don't fucking buy it

[11:07] but the fact that you moaning grown every fucking day

[11:11] and you call jwight out on it

[11:13] and you call chardot out on it

[11:15] seriously man

[11:16] what the fuck is wrong with you

[11:18] don't buy it

[11:19] what the fuck have you done

[11:21] Greg rare hero

[11:23] have you ever coded a game

[11:25] have you ever tried to make a game

[11:27] that's different ghost busters is different

[11:29] it's a different layout

[11:31] it's got different code

[11:32] and these fucking dingle berries

[11:34] have a fucking row of games

[11:36] and all they do is

[11:38] bitch and moan how like

[11:39] every game is the same

[11:40] every game is the same

[11:41] every game is the same

[11:42] so you go and you make a game different

[11:44] and then they fucking bitch and moan that is different

[11:46] I don't like the fact that you can't select moan

[11:49] why can't you select moan

[11:50] it would be more fun

[11:52] I don't see anyone saying ghost busters is not fun

[11:55] in fact I keep hearing people say

[11:56] ghost busters is the most fun fucking machine

[11:59] since fucking machines

[12:00] even fucking got invented

[12:01] I mean seriously

[12:02] what machine has stern made

[12:04] that's as fun as ghost busters for you guys

[12:06] oh tronel Lee

[12:08] AC DC

[12:09] give me a fucking break

[12:10] AC DC is not fun

[12:12] AC DC is fun for the fucking

[12:14] pinball fucking code

[12:16] and the guy who likes to go

[12:18] you know

[12:19] deeper than fucking robins

[12:21] asshole to see all the different modes in that game

[12:23] but that game is not fun

[12:25] it's complex

[12:26] it's got a lot going on

[12:27] but fucking it

[12:28] ghost busters

[12:29] in the first five minutes

[12:30] you're fucking having a blast

[12:32] if you can keep three balls and play for five minutes

[12:34] but that's it man

[12:35] this is fucking environment

[12:36] these guys just bitch and moan and they cry

[12:38] and kpg man

[12:40] you should be fucking ashamed of yourself

[12:42] Gary Stern reached out

[12:43] and you didn't go right back to him

[12:45] you decided to turn the pinside

[12:46] and I'm so sick of pinside

[12:48] I'm sick of it

[12:49] because all these guys do

[12:51] is they bitch and they moan and they cry

[12:53] and they fucking wonder why

[12:55] like Stern isn't on there

[12:56] why other companies aren't on there

[12:58] because who gives this shit

[12:59] you know if these pinside babies

[13:01] would realize one thing

[13:02] and it's one thing they can't fucking admit

[13:04] pinside is like

[13:06] 5% or less

[13:08] of the community of people who play pinball

[13:11] who buy pinball machines

[13:12] who collect pinball machines

[13:14] in fact I will go as far to say that

[13:16] pinside has hurt

[13:18] the pinball world

[13:19] more than its help

[13:20] because pinside has allowed

[13:22] fucking dipshit

[13:24] like Kevin at Skit B

[13:26] to remain on the site

[13:27] and rip everybody off

[13:29] where the fuck would Kevin sell product

[13:31] if not through pinside?

[13:33] alright pinside allowed J-pop to go on there

[13:35] and fucking rip everybody off

[13:37] because Robin is too fucking

[13:40] obsessed with pinball

[13:42] to realize that like you know

[13:44] maybe we should fucking check out

[13:45] some of these people

[13:46] and not just let them sit on my site

[13:48] like a vendor

[13:49] and steal everybody's money

[13:51] and then go belly up

[13:52] I mean it was because of

[13:54] pinside that that shit happened

[13:55] no one else got burned by predator

[13:57] every single person you bought predator

[13:59] is a pinside member

[14:01] because it's its environment

[14:03] where everyone just bitches

[14:04] and moans and they want

[14:05] I want it I want it I want it

[14:06] I want it I want it I want it

[14:07] I want a J-pop game

[14:08] I want a predator game

[14:09] and I deserve it

[14:10] because I'm on this fucking site

[14:12] all day long

[14:13] moaning and groaning about

[14:14] fucking pinball

[14:15] and look it came back to bite these

[14:17] motherfuckers in the ass

[14:18] hardcore

[14:19] you know and that's all I'm going to say

[14:21] is he ever on these form

[14:22] all day long

[14:23] moaning and groaning about

[14:24] your ghosted inserts

[14:25] and your shit

[14:26] let's turn take care of you

[14:28] but if you continue to

[14:29] bitch and moan and groan

[14:31] what why why

[14:33] so fucking like

[14:34] the same like

[14:35] 20 dingo berries can tell you how

[14:37] they like

[14:39] they can soul with your issues

[14:41] it's fucking bullshit

[14:43] give certain a chance

[14:44] everyone's going to be happy

[14:46] I will tell you for a fact

[14:47] right now

[14:48] you guys don't understand

[14:50] like it's going to get

[14:52] fix but shut the fuck up

[14:54] about it every day

[14:55] and let's turn it

[14:56] fix it

[14:57] wait till they reveal their

[14:58] program

[14:59] and if you have issues

[15:00] they're going to fix it

[15:01] right?

[15:02] instead of bitching every day

[15:03] and kpg

[15:04] you should fucking be so sorry

[15:07] that Gary reached out to you

[15:09] and that's a move on his part

[15:10] I'm going to reach out to

[15:11] one of the most vocal

[15:12] members of pinside

[15:13] and look how you behaved

[15:15] you represented

[15:17] the entire community

[15:18] when instead of going back

[15:20] to Gary like a grown man

[15:22] you put on your fucking

[15:23] diapers and you wind a

[15:25] pinside first

[15:26] because that is what

[15:27] pinside is

[15:28] it's an environment

[15:29] where people care more about

[15:31] what other pinciders think

[15:33] of them than acting like a

[15:34] fucking adult

[15:35] and I'm happy as

[15:36] fuck that I'm not

[15:37] on your fucking site

[15:39] but I've got more duplicate

[15:41] accounts and I'm posting

[15:43] on that site more than

[15:44] you can imagine

[15:45] I've got more duplicate

[15:47] accounts than times

[15:48] robin has seen his own

[15:50] dick and that's the truth

[15:51] alright?

[15:52] so that's it

[15:53] pinside babies

[15:54] shut the fuck up

[15:55] and let's

[15:56] stern fix it

[15:57] goodnight
