[00:00] Let's see if this is any better.

[00:03] I don't know.

[00:06] Maybe.

[00:07] We'll get people to let us know.

[00:17] All right.

[00:23] How's that sound?

[00:31] I didn't say anything yet.

[00:32] Does that sound better?

[00:36] Hey Brenda.

[00:38] Could I get a cup of Joe please?

[00:41] If there's any left.

[00:43] Could I get a cup of coffee please if there's any left?

[00:47] I have a cup here by non-refundable mug.

[00:52] Thank you, Brenda.

[00:53] Is it still crackling?

[00:57] All right.

[01:01] Sounds good.

[01:03] Brenda's in the hen house.

[01:04] Is it the hen house?

[01:05] The penalty box?

[01:06] She came home last night.

[01:07] She was three sheets to the windows.

[01:10] They say in Ireland.

[01:11] Not a happy daddy.

[01:13] I have no idea what she was saying.

[01:15] I was like, what do you just go to bed?

[01:17] Just go to bed.

[01:19] So there's that.

[01:23] A fresh summer's breeze.

[01:24] Good.

[01:25] All right.

[01:26] So we're going to talk about everything going on in the Pimbo

[01:27] home.

[01:28] Let's start with King Kong Ellie.

[01:30] Franchier and artist.

[01:32] What do you think of the King Kong artwork?

[01:35] What do you think?

[01:36] Do you think they nailed it?

[01:37] Do you think it's still too busy?

[01:39] I do feel the repetition of the art on the cabinets is highly disappointing.

[01:46] It just does not make the Ellie feel special at all.

[01:51] So I'm really disappointed in that.

[01:56] It's not sold out.

[01:57] It's not sold out.

[01:59] I think if I go to Flippin' Out's website right now, you could put a deposit down on one.

[02:06] If you call around, you'll find one.

[02:09] I think that we've been talking about, he fleets the fifth.

[02:14] He even taught, just say it's not what I would have done.

[02:18] That's always the nice polite way to say, yeah, I don't know.

[02:24] It's clear that frair is just when bananas on the play field art, like bananas.

[02:31] And if frair is doing the, and Kevin O'Connor were doing the cabinet, I mean, they kind of,

[02:40] it is a little unfair that they're using Yeti for just two images for cabinet artwork.

[02:48] And then they're going to pull that across all three models.

[02:54] I think that's lame.

[02:55] I think it's lazy.

[02:56] And I think it's one of the reasons why the Ellie is not flying off the shelves.

[03:01] I just don't think the Ellie stands out enough.

[03:08] I've already said it publicly.

[03:10] Kong is Elle Wins Best.

[03:12] Um, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I think Kong might be Elle Wins Best shooter to date.

[03:20] I don't think it's going to end up being the most fun though from a software standpoint.

[03:27] I don't, I don't.

[03:29] Thank you, baby.

[03:31] It's good to have in your hair, Brenda.

[03:33] It's good to have in your hair.

[03:33] It's good marrying you.

[03:35] How could no one at Sterns say it looks like X-Men there?

[03:43] I think I don't, I don't know gang.

[03:48] I really don't know.

[03:50] I don't know.

[03:51] I feel like jaws as clips were jumbled mess.

[03:54] I feel like these clips are looking a little bit like a jumbled mess.

[03:58] Am I the only one who sees that?

[04:00] Like is it, is it, is it not that way when you're playing?

[04:03] I'm just curious.

[04:05] I feel like every time you hit the ball in a different area of the play field, like all

[04:09] these clips are popping up, I don't feel like you're really progressing through a mode.

[04:17] And I don't know.

[04:18] I just feel like every, every time I watch both jaws and now Kong, the clips are just all

[04:25] over the place as gameplay is happening.

[04:28] And is that normal?

[04:29] Is that how a game is supposed to be?

[04:33] I don't know.

[04:34] When I watch spooky's evil dead, it doesn't feel like that.

[04:38] Like every time, yeah, it's like okay if you're hitting switches and scoring stuff.

[04:44] But I think the problem is, is they keep cutting to like a different visual and it just

[04:50] pulls you out of whatever mojure in.

[04:56] But code never fixed that with jaws either.

[05:07] For Angie said, I wish they were flying off the shelf so I wasn't continually inundated

[05:11] with hundreds of podcasts, play games, streams, interviews and other shameless promotional

[05:15] BS.

[05:17] Let's talk about that, right?

[05:19] I don't think I've seen more shilling of a game in the history of pinball content that

[05:26] has been happening with this game.

[05:29] It is like the biggest shill fest ever.

[05:34] Like how dare a content creator go on a never ending praise of a company in its games?

[05:42] No, but I agree, man.

[05:44] It's just too much.

[05:47] It's too much.

[05:49] There's too much, like that stern, you see that stern edited together, like all those

[05:54] content creators just like sucking up to the game when they had just played it and when

[06:00] they had just spent their own money to get to stirred.

[06:04] It's like the game is benign, is the game as rams.

[06:08] It's the bet like it's just, are you, do you have any pride left?

[06:13] Do you have any pride left?

[06:16] Because if your job as a pinball content creator is to kind of absorb something new, make

[06:23] up your mind about it and then maybe formulate a little bit of a balanced opinion about it.

[06:32] Like, again, there's no such thing as pinball media.

[06:37] Nobody's objective.

[06:39] Everybody's like, you know, they're just making ads for stern.

[06:48] I don't know, like I think this game does shoot really well.

[06:55] You can tell it shoots really well.

[06:56] But when you ask, when you start asking questions, like, what's the one wow mechanism in this

[07:02] game?

[07:03] Right?

[07:04] Like, where's the engineering in this game?

[07:06] Like what's the wow mech?

[07:08] Like you carried over incredible Hulk from Avengers, like same mech.

[07:12] The gong is not that impressive and then you've got the magnet with the spider.

[07:17] So where's the wow?

[07:20] I get the wow is the shots, right?

[07:21] The wow are the upper flippers and the pathway of the upper flippers.

[07:25] I get that like an inch again.

[07:29] But people are acting like this is the new greatest pinball machine of all time with unlicensed

[07:35] assets.

[07:37] No real wow mech to speak of.

[07:40] And then, you know, all the content creators are basically now the biggest fanboys ever

[07:48] and and I look, I kind of happy I wasn't there because they probably would have caught

[07:54] me on camera saying something like, yeah, man, I just thought it was like really fun.

[08:00] You know, it is what it is.

[08:01] It is what it is.

[08:02] Like half those guys that were on camera ordered Ellie's already the other half, who the

[08:07] hell are those people?

[08:08] Did you do you notice that?

[08:10] You're like, who are these people?

[08:12] The fact that Stern is now like broadening its content creator invites to people who

[08:18] have no pinball experience.

[08:21] They have no pinball audience.

[08:23] They have no credibility.

[08:26] So you invite these content creators, you know, all they have is a much larger audience

[08:32] because they have a large audience that tunes in for stuff that's not pinball related.

[08:40] So you know, when all the dust settles, think about it, think about it gang.

[08:46] Keith Ellwyn, right?

[08:48] Like Orbiter Albert saying it's just best shooting game ever.

[08:51] Keith Ellwyn, zombie Eddie on artwork, King Kong as a theme, right?

[08:55] King of the monsters, all of it, all these influencers doing jumping jacks for Stern,

[09:01] making hours of content, convincing us that this game's amazing, all of it, right?

[09:06] You added all up.

[09:08] They couldn't sell out.

[09:10] Couldn't sell out.

[09:12] You got to think about that.

[09:13] What that means?

[09:15] Stern knows that this is like, they've got problems now.

[09:20] Like they're throwing everything at this and they still can't sell 932 games.

[09:25] Games are overpriced.

[09:26] There's too many of them.

[09:27] 932 is too many.

[09:29] Should have been 500 King Kong LEDs, especially when you're stealing the artwork from the pro

[09:33] and the premium, especially when you're not including a top or especially when you're

[09:36] not going to go the extra mile, they're not selling out.

[09:41] Okay?

[09:42] It's good news.

[09:43] It's good news for consumers.

[09:45] Now, I went on the record for saying, I think King Kong Ellie is 10k.

[09:50] It's 10k by the end of the year.

[09:53] I do and I still believe it will be because I don't think there's enough that makes the

[09:58] Ellie special at all.

[09:59] I don't.

[10:00] It'd be different if it had really unique artwork.

[10:04] It'd be different if the armor was amazing.

[10:06] It's not once you get your premium and you throw all the accessories on, you have the

[10:11] savings at games.

[10:12] Turn pinball needs to start putting an exclusive topper on top of these exclusive Ellie's.

[10:18] There needs to be only 932 special toppers that are a reward for those who paid $13,000.

[10:27] It's just stupid.

[10:28] You're going to end up spending closer to $15,000 on a sternle that's not even hard to

[10:34] find.

[10:36] He's still going on.

[10:37] So that's it.

[10:39] That's it.

[10:40] Now, look, of course, I don't blame stern for doing this.

[10:45] I just think the people who paid their own money to get there need to like reevaluate,

[10:52] just reevaluate what you're doing.

[10:55] You know what I'm saying?

[10:57] You're literally helping a company sell its products and you make nothing for it.

[11:04] I understand if a distributor is going there and filming content and you guys are, but

[11:08] remember, they paid for you to go and look at John Wick.

[11:13] You have to remember this people like the fact that they initially paid people to go try

[11:19] to move John Wick units.

[11:21] And now how did they treat you during X-Men?

[11:24] How did they treat you during like King Kong?

[11:26] You got to pay your own way.

[11:28] All right.

[11:30] I think King Kong will hold value better than almost any other modern stern.

[11:34] Albert, none of them have held value.

[11:38] Only jaws is held value.

[11:40] Keith Owens, James Bond 60, it has lost $12,000 in value basically if you bought it new

[11:48] on stern's website day one.

[11:50] So it's saying nothing.

[11:53] Yeah.

[11:56] So Carrie, I heard the same thing from Retro Ralph.

[11:59] Like he's like, dude, it's so crowded.

[12:02] It was so crowded.

[12:04] You know, and look, I'm just going to say this, Carrie, Franchie, loser kid.

[12:12] I don't know, Zach, I'm sorry, but like the crem de la crem of pinball content creators

[12:20] should be invited on a different day.

[12:23] Thank you, gang.

[12:24] Thank you, Jeffrey.

[12:26] I really appreciate this.

[12:27] When you guys, because we've moved over from Facebook to YouTube, I really appreciate

[12:34] you guys sending money with your comments.

[12:36] So I found a way to turn it on.

[12:38] So if you want a beautiful article pin by shadow, what game will do better on location,

[12:43] evil dead or King Kong?

[12:47] King Kong will do better on location.

[12:49] Because Jeffrey, like just real simply, there's just more mainstream awareness of King Kong.

[12:57] And it's like, it's just got a more broad appeal.

[13:02] I absolutely think Kong would do better on location.

[13:05] I think locations all about theme and also like, let's face it, like most people go and

[13:10] enjoy the latest stern on location.

[13:12] And the stern pro is perfect for that.

[13:15] But Jeffrey, I want to thank you so much for bumping your question.

[13:19] Hey, does everybody see how to do that?

[13:21] How to comment like with like a super comment?

[13:23] I don't know what they call it.

[13:24] What do they call these comments, Kerry, where you can like donate?

[13:29] Let's see if we can set a goal here.

[13:30] Super chats.

[13:32] Pick the goal.

[13:32] Let's pick a goal here.

[13:33] Let's do 20 super chats.

[13:36] Let's set a timer of one hour.

[13:41] Share how you'll celebrate.

[13:44] I don't know.

[13:48] I'll do a jumping jack.

[13:54] Let's start the goal.

[13:58] All right.

[14:04] I started a goal of 20 super chats.

[14:06] See what happens here.

[14:07] All right.

[14:13] So look, well, first I want to say gang, like the last six weeks I've been recovering from

[14:18] my hernia surgery and it was really painful.

[14:21] And this week was the first week I could get back to the gym.

[14:24] I feel already so much better.

[14:26] I feel more like myself.

[14:27] It was really depressing to not be able to work out for six weeks.

[14:31] It really was.

[14:32] And it was also incredible to see how much of your strength you lose when you stop exercising

[14:40] weekly.

[14:41] So I really do feel like I wasn't myself.

[14:45] And I was very short tempered and I was very cranky and carried over into work.

[14:50] He carried over into my family life.

[14:53] And I really feel blessed to be back on the road to recovery and being able to work out

[14:59] again.

[15:00] Thank you so much.

[15:01] I'm going to put an awesome heat.

[15:02] I appreciate that.

[15:06] Why isn't it counting down?

[15:08] Be the first one.

[15:13] Let's see.

[15:18] I'm figuring these super chats out.

[15:24] Okay.

[15:25] You don't look like Jean-Claude anymore.

[15:27] Do you get a hernia from carrying the weight of pinball podcasters for so long?

[15:32] Frenchy Frenchy Frenchy Frenchy Frenchy Frenchy.

[15:36] So I can't wait for Halloween to get my King Kong Ellie.

[15:45] Look, I'm happy you guys are getting your Kong Ellie's.

[15:49] I am.

[15:50] I just think I'm worried about the code a little bit.

[15:54] It's not that the people on it aren't good.

[15:56] I just worry that it's not they're not going to be plugging in assets.

[16:00] Okay.

[16:01] So Stern pinball, let's talk about this.

[16:02] So after King Kong, because King Kong is out, it's going to be a great pin.

[16:10] You know, absolutely.

[16:11] I don't see the value in the Ellie.

[16:13] I think it's going to be a great pin.

[16:16] And then it's going to be May.

[16:19] And May second, we're supposedly going to get something for Harry Potter because it's

[16:25] International Harry Potter day.

[16:28] Now I don't know what's going to happen this Friday.

[16:34] I'll tell you on Potter, which house are you and why?

[16:39] I don't even know the Potter house is to be honest, gang like Rivendor for driven like

[16:46] like, ah, I saw the movies.

[16:50] I've committed almost none of them to memory.

[16:54] And I didn't read the books.

[16:56] So my my knowledge of Harry Potter is like, ah, like very small.

[17:05] I don't think in Harry Potter lingo.

[17:11] So I'm looking at this game as a way to reignite my understanding of the franchise and the

[17:19] universe.

[17:21] It's like one of these properties where like you get it, right?

[17:24] You get it.

[17:25] It's easy to understand what's going on.

[17:28] But it's not a property when that that like left an indelible impression on me.

[17:34] You know what I'm saying?

[17:37] I really don't feel like I think about Harry Potter fondly.

[17:43] And I don't you know, I didn't go to the Broadway shows.

[17:46] I don't collect Potter stuff.

[17:49] I don't it doesn't click with me.

[17:53] And I think one of the reasons why too is I think for a generation of people it did, right?

[17:58] So like a lot of people sort of put themselves in the role of Harry.

[18:05] And I I would rather be Maverick and Luke Skywalker and Han Solo.

[18:13] I would rather be Darth Maul.

[18:15] I would rather be a karate kid.

[18:19] I would rather be a member of Cobre Kai.

[18:22] I would rather be Ferris Bueller.

[18:24] I would rather be the Terminator.

[18:25] I would rather be in diehard.

[18:28] I would rather be watching young guns.

[18:30] I would rather be watching Bloodsport.

[18:32] I would rather be the last star fighter.

[18:35] I'd rather be he-man.

[18:36] I'd rather be Optimus Prime.

[18:39] I'd rather be Roda Miss Prime.

[18:40] I'd rather be Galvatron.

[18:42] I'd rather be Megatron.

[18:44] I'd rather be so many things before I would want to be Harry Potter.

[18:52] And it's just a generational thing.

[18:53] It's nothing against Potter.

[18:55] But I do think that people think that I think it's going to be an interesting experiment

[19:04] in the the carryover of how many people are going to buy Harry Potter that also buy

[19:12] Pimbal.

[19:13] The thing I'm worried about getting yet Rambo absolutely.

[19:17] The thing I'm worried about is why do you know I don't understand.

[19:27] Did any-like none of this super chats counted.

[19:31] So I'm just curious like where the money went.

[19:34] Because it still says O for 20 and we have like people have been giving stuff.

[19:45] So are these not super chats or I don't understand.

[19:54] Harry when you do super chats does it tally up as they go?

[20:01] Well it's- okay.

[20:05] Well what's the point of setting a goal if it's not counting?

[20:08] You have it- you have to say- oh you have it set at only $5.

[20:12] Okay hold on.

[20:14] Let me see if I can edit that.

[20:17] Let me just remove the goal.

[20:20] All right let's try it again.

[20:23] Ah I see.

[20:26] All callers let's do that.

[20:29] Now we're going to start a new goal and all will count.

[20:34] Someone tried doing something- this is how I- this is how I- someone tried giving a

[20:37] $1.99 and see if it counts.

[20:43] Big trouble no China absolutely.

[20:47] Absolutely.

[20:50] All right so I don't know- so what do you guys think?

[20:55] Do you think we're going to get Harry Potter on Friday and do you think it's going to

[20:59] be at Allentown?

[21:00] So that's the crazy part because like I don't know like the games are on the line like

[21:05] they've got games made.

[21:07] Because the games are going sent- the games are going to be sent to Europe to be at European

[21:15] shows and that normally takes like two to three weeks.

[21:18] So games are going to be going out the door.

[21:21] We'll talk about Ninja clips- okay see it is counting them now.

[21:24] We'll talk about Ninja clips for- thank you guys I really appreciate it.

[21:28] All this stuff is really great.

[21:30] I really do appreciate it.

[21:35] So do you think that there's going to be a Harry- the Harry Potter video will drop on Friday,

[21:41] International Harry Potter Day and Joe Newhart from Pimball Star is going to have one

[21:48] of the first ones on location at the show.

[21:53] What do you think?

[21:56] What do you think?

[21:57] It should be at Wizarding World as well.

[22:00] It could be.

[22:02] I mean what I know they wanted to do- this is why I don't think it's going to be there.

[22:06] I know that Harry- the plan to launch Harry Potter was to have a global launch.

[22:13] So games would be in Australia, in Europe, in America, everywhere and they would launch

[22:20] that way.

[22:24] And I think that's- thank you Dave for the chat man.

[22:27] I definitely want to be Darth Maul man.

[22:29] I'd get my robotic legs and still be kicking ass.

[22:32] I think that's what they wanted to do.

[22:36] So I also know that they want media to come play the game.

[22:42] I forget how they did Avatar.

[22:45] I know they did the Avatar reveal video first.

[22:49] Then they invited us to come down there and play the game.

[22:52] But that was when Jersey Jack had a little bit of a delay between reveal and games on

[22:58] the line where this one's going to be more like Guns and Roses.

[23:01] On the day they reveal it, I think there's going to be like a hundred to two hundred already

[23:06] made in boxes, making its way into people's homes.

[23:11] And it's going to be non-stop Potter production for two years.

[23:16] My guess is they're going to be making this game for two to three years straight through.

[23:20] They'll have to set up a second line for Richie's next game.

[23:25] Nice.

[23:27] Okay.

[23:28] Everybody, thank you for the superchats.

[23:31] All right.

[23:32] Make a Warriors pin, Jeffrey said.

[23:35] No, don't make a Warriors pin.

[23:38] Don't.

[23:39] You know, like if you want to make Warriors come out and play, you got to expect five hundred

[23:48] or less to be sold.

[23:52] I think kids should be excited.

[23:53] If we're an adult, it's just another day.

[23:59] Who hears into Pokemon?

[24:01] We have 145 people here.

[24:04] Who hears like actively into Pokemon?

[24:08] Like legit.

[24:09] Have you seen Pokemon episodes?

[24:11] Do you play with the cards?

[24:13] Do you collect Pokemon?

[24:15] Do you talk about Pokemon with your friends?

[24:18] I was born in 1990, so me.

[24:21] But Elemental, Element only, oh wait, do you have money for Pimball Machines if you were

[24:30] born in 1990?

[24:34] I just, I just don't think people realize like the, it's the same way Avatar is one of

[24:46] the biggest movies of all time, but it just didn't translate over into Pimball well.

[24:56] I'm in on Pokemon Elliott.

[24:58] I think everybody here would rather have Super Mario Brothers and Sonic the Hedgehog Sega

[25:05] Genesis version over Pokemon.

[25:15] It's not the Harry Potter's not, does not hit the Pimball Buying demo on its head.

[25:22] So let's, on its head, you know, it's not a bullseye, if you will.

[25:26] Let's talk about Dune Gang.

[25:29] Let's talk about Dune because I had a conversation with David Vines and Dune is going to be at

[25:36] Allentown on Friday, so I will be there.

[25:40] So if anyone's going to Allentown in a, what is it, Pimfest next Friday, I will be there

[25:48] Friday and I'm going to have a nice time there.

[25:52] I'm going to drive down in the morning in my little GR86, my little, you know, tofu

[25:58] drift car, and I'm going to play all these new games.

[26:02] I think Kong will be there as well.

[26:05] So I, I think Dune, you know, David said it's selling better than Labyrinth at this stage.

[26:14] Games are sort of going out like they're trickling out.

[26:19] The demons in storage, bro.

[26:22] Feel too cold for the demon some days.

[26:25] I got to get the demon out.

[26:26] I also don't want to bring my demon to a pinball show, you know why?

[26:29] Take a guess where I will never drive my demon to a pinball show.

[26:35] Take one guess where I will never let that car with people know I have sit in a pinball

[26:42] parking lot.

[26:44] No, exactly.

[26:49] Someone would key my car.

[26:52] There's just too many haters and and like it just takes like that, you know, like that

[26:59] CJ dude that booed me like I know the thing about these haters gang is that they're cowards

[27:06] and they would never come up to my face at a show and tell me how much they hate me,

[27:11] but they would definitely damage my property.

[27:14] I don't put it past them.

[27:15] I think there are some real cranky losers that have a big problem with my presence in

[27:22] this hobby and they would never say to my face, but they would definitely take it out

[27:27] on my property.

[27:29] Look, I've seen it man.

[27:33] The hate lives inside these people like I don't even know them like that's the thing.

[27:37] I didn't and I didn't even do anything to them personally.

[27:41] That's the thing that sucks right is like they take what I do personally, but I don't,

[27:47] you know, I'm not getting hate mail from Keith L. Win and Dwight Sullivan.

[27:50] I talk to all the manufacturers.

[27:54] David Fix is the only chump who won't talk to me, but I don't care.

[27:57] Like he's gone, you know.

[28:05] I will also say this on just a pure automotive level.

[28:09] It's not fun taking the demon on like two hour highway rides.

[28:13] The car is more fun, red light to red light.

[28:17] So did anybody buy a dune?

[28:21] Has anybody here ordered a dune pinball machine?

[28:24] We have 140 people.

[28:25] This is great.

[28:26] We're getting way more people on YouTube than we ever did on Facebook, but gang, we're

[28:30] 17 super chats away from our goal and I'll do my jumping jacks.

[28:36] No dune.

[28:37] No dune.

[28:38] I want to just hear all you guys come on.

[28:40] You're on there.

[28:41] You're watching unless you're driving.

[28:43] Did you buy a dune pinball machine?

[28:50] No said okay.

[28:52] No, no, no negative.

[28:57] No, no, no.

[29:00] I will play it for us.

[29:02] No, no, not one person has ordered a dune.

[29:06] Like I don't think I've seen so many universal nose to broke theme kills it.

[29:15] We're getting too locally here said Ian.

[29:18] I ordered one.

[29:19] We got one order.

[29:20] We got one order Billy boy.

[29:23] Hey gang.

[29:25] Tell the marketing department you guys hooked Billy boy.

[29:29] Yes.

[29:30] Yes.

[29:32] Yes.

[29:34] Wait, play decide.

[29:38] Thank you till pin for the world's second best spot guys.

[29:41] It is true.

[29:42] It is true.

[29:43] Even though I got almost 100 more first place votes.

[29:46] I lost.

[29:47] Kyle and God is finger on that scale.

[29:50] Do you notice how he never released the second and third place tallies?

[29:55] You notice how we never release that information?

[29:57] Right.

[29:58] I got almost 100 more first place votes for favorite pinball podcast and lost.

[30:05] And then he never released the data on how many second and third place votes did electric

[30:10] back yet.

[30:13] Interesting.

[30:14] Kyle and hiding the info.

[30:16] Finger on the scale.

[30:20] Who cares?

[30:21] Like I've literally what the net net is like I'll just I just won't care nor support the

[30:25] twippy's ever again.

[30:27] Just because it's done now to me at the whole thing is just a it was a terrible show to

[30:31] begin with and done like not even going to tune in next year.

[30:36] So you won't get another drunk canada rant.

[30:39] Ah, you know there should be an award for most successful most financially successful

[30:46] pinball podcaster and the winner goes for eight years in a row.

[30:49] The only one who's ever monetized it successfully.

[30:51] Canate has been ball podcast.

[30:53] Who by the way when I did monetize it for the first time everybody came at me with pitch

[30:57] forks.

[31:01] Albert I didn't I didn't lose I lost by a weighted system you understand that right

[31:05] brother.

[31:06] Like there's it's really weird right.

[31:09] You finish first the most in the race.

[31:12] But but someone who's finished second and third actually gets the championship.

[31:19] Okay.

[31:21] Welcome to the woke world people.

[31:23] The woke the woke world strikes again.

[31:28] I don't do that.

[31:29] I don't care man like I really like my my voters didn't show up bro I got over 600 votes

[31:36] last time and this time I only got 200 for first place which means.

[31:41] Nobody cares about the twippies anymore that's all that says like when they say this

[31:44] was the most voted on twippies ever that's a flat out lie lie.

[31:54] Good call weighted voting is woke.

[31:57] Yeah it is woke.

[32:00] All right so doon pinball so nobody bought it but Billy boy.

[32:05] So what do you think next for barrels so I and when I say next for barrels I really am

[32:12] just trying to think as if I were them.

[32:17] Well what do you do now to get more interest in the title.

[32:22] So I I'm a little worried that they came out just too early and I and I told this is to

[32:27] David now David said something to me that was funny and you're going to laugh at this.

[32:33] So so I was talking to David on the phone.

[32:35] And you know nice guys like Chris like it's one that you know.

[32:40] What do you hear just likes you like you you have friends here like get you down the

[32:44] Houston.

[32:46] It's funny because everybody says like I'll get you down in Houston part of me is like.

[32:51] You guys want to fly me down the Houston because like I just I just don't want.

[32:59] I'll tell you this true journalism you pay your own way like at the New York Times

[33:03] gets invited to go review a product.

[33:06] They won't take money from the company because they want to remain completely unbiased.

[33:13] But the difference is is the New York Times pays their reporters and the New York Times

[33:19] makes money.

[33:23] So maybe what I'll do is I don't know maybe I'll ask like my supporters and set up a fund

[33:30] as a send canada or you know so wherever you want to fund and I bet you my wealthier

[33:36] patrons would like that would be pretty fun to do like you know if you if you support if

[33:44] you donate to the canada trips to these manufacturers I will make exclusive content for you first.

[33:51] So you get an exclusive first look and and I'll go live just for you guys.

[33:58] So you get an exclusive first look at at the trip.

[34:02] I don't know maybe maybe I just you know for me personally I just don't want to get into

[34:08] this whole like tears and compartmentalizing the content you know people have been saying

[34:13] like you should do something for people who spend 10 or 30.

[34:18] But what does barrels do now?

[34:21] What is barrels do now?

[34:24] What would you do if you're them?

[34:27] So obviously they need to get some gameplay footage up where the clips are in the game.

[34:35] Has anybody here played it?

[34:38] Okay, because I think that's going to be key.

[34:41] It's unfortunate that it's going up against King Kong at the same time because I have

[34:48] a hard time believing that this game shoots as good as King Kong.

[34:55] So that's going to be tricky right because at all these shows now you know you want to

[35:00] get people excited and of course this game plays better than labyrinth but that's not

[35:05] how buyers work like we don't live in a vacuum where the only thing we're cross shopping

[35:11] this against is your previous title.

[35:14] We're cross shopping this against Keith Owens latest game.

[35:19] Now people are cross shopping this game against evil dead and it's not a cheap game.

[35:29] It's not a cheap game you know it's 11 6 plus additional items you're going to want to

[35:35] get.

[35:37] So I think that this is going to be a slow burn.

[35:42] I don't think they're going to sell a thousand because again like I just I don't think they're

[35:48] going to get momentum around this title.

[35:52] I would have waited.

[35:53] I just would have waited.

[35:54] I would have waited.

[35:55] I would have waited for Potter to come out.

[35:58] I would have just made a couple hundred of these.

[36:00] You know you're going to sell a couple hundred but when you do reveal to the world you're

[36:04] putting your best foot forward.

[36:08] And you know so okay back to my conversation with David Van S.

[36:11] So David said something to me that I just I did call them out on it and I'll I'll share

[36:15] with you he said something like I don't want to sell out on day one Chris.

[36:20] He said that to me I don't want to day one sell out.

[36:25] He said if I if that happened I did something wrong.

[36:28] And what he means by that is he was there when those are those are mommy's glasses.

[36:37] They're your glasses come here come say hi come on come on.

[36:42] I'm going to try to get Kylian on camera here hold on.

[36:49] Gain we're 15 short of super chats come here okay there your glasses come here.

[36:53] All right come on.

[36:57] Come here all right okay don't don't touch that because it'll disconnect and then I have

[37:02] to start the whole show over.

[37:04] Killian can I ask you some questions.

[37:07] Okay.

[37:09] Did you spend $13,000 on a King Kong alley.

[37:15] Yeah.

[37:16] Okay.

[37:17] Killian okay.

[37:18] I sure doubt.

[37:19] Kelly would you ready.

[37:22] Would you order a dune pinball machine.

[37:27] Yeah.

[37:28] Oh man.

[37:30] The market's going to be strong in the future.

[37:31] Okay.

[37:32] Killian.

[37:33] Would you order a Pokemon pinball machine.

[37:35] Yeah.

[37:36] Okay.

[37:37] What do you think David fixed it a good job running American pinball.

[37:46] No.

[37:48] That honestly honestly unscripted insanely accurate.

[37:54] Killian.

[37:55] I love you.

[37:56] You're just giving everybody you're you're now the most credible voice in all of pinball.

[38:01] Oh my god.

[38:02] Can you go back to mommy now.

[38:04] Close it or please close it or.

[38:06] That was insane.

[38:09] Like there is a god up there because literally the fact that he said yes to everything.

[38:16] He doesn't know about any like wow.

[38:20] I'm glad we captured this.

[38:22] I'm glad we captured that on camera.

[38:24] He is on point.

[38:26] He is going to be the country is going to be okay.

[38:35] He's already better than loser kid.

[38:37] I mean, some of these like interviews gang.

[38:40] It's like you just they they put so much butter on Keith L. Wynn.

[38:47] You think the guy is a piece of toast, right?

[38:50] I mean, the amount of like asking people do when they talk to L. Wynn.

[38:54] I mean, I just like like Jesus gang like.

[39:00] I just like have again, like just have some a little bit more like just chill out like chill.

[39:09] Like talk to the bro the whole time and there was that one interviewer.

[39:13] I think it was a loser kid.

[39:14] He just you know, look at Frank Mack.

[39:17] By the way, Frank.

[39:19] This guy like my new best buddy like Frank shows up yesterday helps me solder guns and roses.

[39:25] Dropped off stuffed animals for the kids brought a pot at plant for the house.

[39:30] And now is like in love with this day and pot of plant.

[39:35] You get him his own podcast.

[39:40] So like the thing is gain the thing is it's like it's at the point now where see I have

[39:49] to make sure I set up my like tack everything so I can.

[39:53] Do is a great buy.

[39:56] You did it.

[39:57] You did it.

[39:58] You know, it's at the point now where you know, these companies are going to have to like really turn the marketing up.

[40:07] And I still think everything is about theme.

[40:11] So I'll give you guys another bit of news, right?

[40:14] Is that that back to the future is most likely not shipping this year.

[40:19] Just not shipping this year.

[40:23] You know, Alice is barely making its way out.

[40:27] And I think that.

[40:29] Oh, I was talking about how Keith L was just kept rocking back and forth in his chair.

[40:33] It's like bro, bro, you're the world's best pinball designer.

[40:37] I'm going to give you that.

[40:40] Stop moving in your chair.

[40:41] Like we're recording you.

[40:44] Stop moving back and forth.

[40:47] Just just, you know, just tell him to stop.

[40:49] Just tell him to stop the whole time.

[40:52] Don't make me turn the carry hearty camera.

[40:55] Hey, camera, camera, be camera.

[40:57] Hey, it's the same.

[40:58] Can't it's carry hearty saying it's just you carry.

[41:02] Why do you keep talking to different cameras?

[41:04] What is that?

[41:07] What's happening?

[41:08] Carry like I would actually increase my donation to you.

[41:14] If I could just get one camera, I'd pay more for less cameras.

[41:22] Hmm.

[41:27] Ah.

[41:29] You know, the thing is, ah.

[41:35] You guys want to, I couldn't do what carry does with like the scrolling names,

[41:40] because my one just keeps scrolling for the entire episode.

[41:47] Just see that.

[41:48] I did that.

[41:48] Just keep scrolling.

[41:51] Scrolling.

[41:52] Scrolling.

[41:55] OK, so I think Dune will, I think Dune will max out around 800 sold.

[42:04] That's my, if that, because I think what's going to happen to Dune,

[42:10] it's just, it's more expensive than Labyrinth was.

[42:13] There's too much else out there, and too many people have lost too much money.

[42:16] And, and, and the vibe is just shifted in Pimbal now.

[42:19] This is not just like keep supporting.

[42:22] And, and I think what's going to happen to is, you got to remember like they're not,

[42:26] they said they're going to be done making all these by the end of the year.

[42:29] I don't think that's going to be the case.

[42:30] I think they're going to like, I just think there's too much coming.

[42:34] Too much out there.

[42:36] And it's just, I don't know if like it's a theme that people are going to want to open up space for.

[42:41] I will, will make Dune a better seller is, is if barrels can attract.

[42:49] Dune fans and, you know, leverage the relationship with legendary to excite new people to buy the game.

[43:00] They were never going to use the David Lynch one gang like that, that movie's terrible.

[43:05] Like it's not good.

[43:06] Like that, that these were better movies like without a doubt.

[43:11] Dune seems to be a very tough shooter, which is good for tournament players.

[43:15] Yeah, and tournament players don't buy new inbox games.

[43:19] Yeah, you know, look, Billy boy, I agree that the mechs and the toys have been underwhelming across the board.

[43:35] As pinball prices have gone through the roof, the amount of mechs and toys in games has been really underwhelming.

[43:43] I wish X-Men would have been a better game because I do actually think X-Men from a toys and layout is phenomenal.

[43:54] I just feel the game though, the code just lets it down.

[43:57] Now George Gomez is now saying that they're going to like throw three coders at it.

[44:03] They're going to make X-Men good.

[44:05] He's a little bit ashamed that it's not and he's angry.

[44:09] Like I hope so.

[44:13] I hope so because it is a great layout, right?

[44:15] And it's easier to change software than layout.

[44:18] Yeah, I still can't believe they made two brown powder coated pins.

[44:24] Yeah, it is a brown beige world over at barrels.

[44:35] Did anyone here get out?

[44:36] This is adventures in Wonderland.

[44:37] I feel like that game.

[44:41] I talked to Melvin a lot.

[44:44] He's a good friend.

[44:48] I just, it was funny.

[44:50] He's Melissa hit me up.

[44:51] She's like, Chris, your Alice is right.

[44:52] I'm going to invoice you.

[44:53] I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[44:55] Initially, I had two invoices for Alice, but I let one go and I held on to the one that's much later on in the run.

[45:06] Melvin's awesome.

[45:07] He's like, dude, he's like, I said, if you get it, you get it.

[45:09] I'm not going to, I'm not going to be upset if you like, you know, walk away from your order.

[45:18] Raza's next.

[45:20] So that is like, that is going to happen.

[45:22] Here's what's going to happen, gang.

[45:23] I'm going to tell you right now, Raza will be the next game from Dutch pinball, not back to the future.

[45:33] I'll tell you exactly what's going to happen.

[45:35] They will finish the Alice run.

[45:37] Back to the future will not be ready.

[45:40] And the only way to save the company will be to put another game on the line.

[45:44] It will be Raza.

[45:46] There will be less Raza's than Alice.

[45:50] I think somewhere around like 300.

[45:52] So not everybody who buys an Alice is going to be able to get a Raza.

[45:56] And Melvin's going to have done what nobody else could do.

[45:59] He's going to have two working J-pop titles.

[46:04] And that's that.

[46:07] I don't think the tariffs are in effect.

[46:10] I think they're paused for like 90 days.

[46:14] I wouldn't have been more shocked if they had asked people to put their pins in front of windows.

[46:20] You know, here's the one, the company that needs the most help in my honest opinion right

[46:28] now is Turner Pinball.

[46:31] You know, how many Chris Turner, Turner Pinball, Merlin's, are they going to sell?

[46:38] So I've been very, I don't know, I think I've been very candid about this.

[46:43] I don't think he's going to sell 100 at 90, whatever, 500, a pop or 94, 99.

[46:51] I just don't see it happening.

[46:54] And for some reason, like Chris gave or sold to Melvin the better titles.

[47:02] Because you remember, people forget this, people forget this.

[47:05] I believe Chris Turner initially owned the Alice stuff and the Raza stuff.

[47:14] Now for some weird reason, both these guys, Melvin and Chris are like strangely like obsessed

[47:20] with the world of J-pop.

[47:22] And Turner sold the two games that are going to sell easily for Melvin and kept the John

[47:31] Norris Melvin's arcade from deep root.

[47:34] Chris Turner also owns Foodtruck, Barrio's Foodtruck.

[47:38] So I don't know what the strategy now is.

[47:46] You got to remember, Merlin's arcade.

[47:50] Totally loaded is the same price as King Kong Premium.

[48:00] I don't know how you sell any, any with that reality.

[48:08] Right?

[48:09] King Kong Premium or Merlin's arcade.

[48:15] Look at the two next to each other.

[48:21] Turner Pimball needs to hire Canada to make all of its licensing, merchandising and marketing

[48:29] decisions.

[48:30] I'll do it.

[48:33] I'll do it.

[48:38] I will everyone will know that's what I'm doing.

[48:40] It'll be...

[48:43] I would do it.

[48:44] I would sign a deal with them where I would get royalties on games sold based upon the

[48:51] marketing decisions that I gave him.

[48:52] He can't...

[48:53] I don't think there's many salaries going out the door over at Turner Pimball.

[49:02] I'm back.

[49:04] Damn, this is hard watching Grand Sunsucker Gaming.

[49:08] I know.

[49:09] I know.

[49:10] In a lot of ways, I'm more entertaining than your own family members.

[49:15] You know this.

[49:16] Come on, Robert.

[49:17] That soccer game is boring.

[49:19] Those kids are just...

[49:20] They don't even know.

[49:21] All those kids are off sides.

[49:23] The only time kids at that age score is when the entire team is off sides, just cherry

[49:28] picking for goals.

[49:30] Been there, done that.

[49:33] Nobody has done Halo yet.

[49:35] I just got back into Halo.

[49:37] It's awesome.

[49:38] It's like a fun game.

[49:40] I would never want to Pimball format of it.

[49:44] Of course I'm right.

[49:45] I had to pee.

[49:46] We soccer so bad to watch.

[49:48] Wow.

[49:49] Do we have like a fake franchi here?

[49:53] Christopher Tranchi?

[49:56] I mean, that's a weird name.

[50:03] You know what game?

[50:06] Did anyone get a Merlin's edition of Medieval Madness?

[50:15] Should we block Christopher Tranchi?

[50:17] I think we should.

[50:18] But I'll let Franchi decide.

[50:22] Yeah.

[50:23] Let's get rid of him.

[50:28] Christopher Tranchi.

[50:33] I'd use her on this channel.

[50:36] Sorry, Christopher Tranchi.

[50:39] Year gone.

[50:41] All right.

[50:42] He's gone.

[50:47] You control.

[50:48] But I won't let you troll a personality like Franchi who we want here.

[50:56] His real name is not Christopher Tranchi.

[51:01] That is not.

[51:06] Is it spooky Luke?

[51:07] He was using that name.

[51:08] Was he?

[51:21] Have any of you guys like, you know, have any of you guys just felt like you're, you're

[51:28] reaching a point in your adulthood lives where you're kind of getting a little tired of

[51:33] like the over consumption, being the pathway to feeling good about life and who you are.

[51:40] And do you want to like thin out your life a little bit like own less things?

[51:46] You know, I might be for any of you guys out there that collect arcade machines.

[51:51] I think I'm ready to let go of my Disney made, uh, Fixed Field, X Jr. machine.

[52:00] So like if you are an arcade collector, there's like maybe eight of them in the world that

[52:05] are in personal collections, but I'm going to list her and I can't wait for all the people

[52:12] to get mad at the price I asked for it.

[52:15] But again, it's just for the for the right collector that loves wreck it Ralph and wants

[52:20] a piece of Disney memorabilia.

[52:24] It's kind of epic and it was $9,500 10 years ago.

[52:30] I love triggering the anger of arcade collectors.

[52:34] I just reached a point where I just don't care anymore.

[52:42] You know, I don't care.

[52:43] Like kids are so rewarding and I've got too much of everything.

[52:50] And right now what I want is I think what you buy says a lot about what your priorities

[52:56] are in life.

[52:58] And for me, I again, I'd rather spend money experientially.

[53:03] So you spending money going out with Brenda, putting money away for my kids, taking them

[53:10] on vacation, paying off, you know, all, you know, making sure there's no car payments,

[53:16] like all that, taking care of.

[53:18] And for me, I'm in a stage now where like just getting this house paid off is my number

[53:25] one thing because I didn't have a mortgage for 25 years.

[53:29] And so this house is two thirds paid off in less than a year, which I'm very proud of.

[53:40] I could pay the whole thing off, but I just don't want to, you know, I don't want to

[53:44] wipe out too much of my investments and my savings.

[53:46] But I want to tell you something that happened to me when we fixed guns and roses.

[53:52] And I went over to it and I played it again.

[53:56] And Frank was here and we sawdered the end of switch issue that was happening with the

[54:01] game.

[54:03] And I just like, I don't know, I just felt for the first time completely over the game.

[54:11] Like I just, I love the music.

[54:14] I love the elements of it.

[54:18] But I just the gameplay just doesn't make me want to keep playing it.

[54:26] Well, you know what I've noticed with like collecting stuff is like the anxiety, the

[54:32] low-city nature that comes along with it kind of like removes a lot of the fun.

[54:39] You know, and then you kind of walk by it and you know, it's just, I don't know.

[54:48] Sell it and get a King Kong.

[54:53] I don't want a King Kong.

[54:55] I don't want a King Kong.

[54:58] I don't, I'm so content to go to automate it and play King Kong whenever I want.

[55:08] I don't want a King Kong.

[55:10] I just, it's not, it's not a dream theme.

[55:14] It's not a game that when I look at it, I get giddy watching what's happening in the

[55:21] game.

[55:22] I just don't.

[55:23] And I 100% agree with all of you.

[55:25] It's going to shoot great.

[55:26] I don't, I don't, I only want to own something that is a reflection of something I love.

[55:34] So that's the same reason why I'm not going to own a Harry Potter for the most part.

[55:37] Like I might put one in the garage, but I don't see myself like owning Potter.

[55:44] I just don't think in Hogwarts, you know, mindsets.

[55:50] I, I don't know what's happening with Predator.

[55:52] I thought that was, I told you I was going to buy Predator.

[55:55] I was going to buy the game because I love the theme so much.

[55:57] I don't even think that game is, that game is coming out.

[56:00] It was supposed to be revealed yesterday.

[56:04] That was the plan and it was supposed to be at Allentown and now it's not.

[56:14] I'm curious to see what happens with, you know, I'm curious to see what happens.

[56:20] Thank you, Eric, for the stars.

[56:22] Disable commercials for live.

[56:23] They keep interrupting your show and all right, I'll do that next time.

[56:28] I don't think I can do it now.

[56:33] I didn't realize that I put that on Eric.

[56:36] I don't, let's see if I can do that now.

[56:38] Modernization activity.

[56:42] Oh, wait, was that moderation activity?

[56:47] Okay, hold on.

[56:50] I can't change it now.

[56:52] I will fix that next time.

[57:00] See, I think I turned it on by mistake.

[57:12] Let me see if I can turn it off.

[57:13] Hold on.

[57:15] It's only used to me.

[57:38] I don't think I'm going to make any money with this.

[57:39] Sorry about that gang.

[57:41] If it makes watching this week's annoying, I really do apologize.

[57:45] No ads in Canada.

[57:50] Yeah, yeah.

[57:52] Gang, I'm a working progress every week.

[57:57] What do you guys want to talk about?

[57:58] How do we want to spend the next few minutes?

[58:00] I'm probably going to go another like 10, 15.

[58:04] Yeah, I don't want to lug another Jersey jack up the stairs.

[58:11] I'd rather, I don't know.

[58:13] Do you think Guns n' Roses, CE?

[58:15] Knowing there's only 500.

[58:17] Do you think over time if they make all these unlimited CE's of Harry Potter and thousands

[58:23] of Stern Ali's?

[58:24] I don't know.

[58:25] I think G&R CE may, may only because there's only 500, may in the end still be something

[58:34] that's at least a little bit unique.

[58:37] Let's go to the marketplace and see if Guns n' Roses CE is for sale.

[58:44] Guns n' Roses, it's, yeah, here we go.

[58:52] Wow.

[58:54] Zach many has won for 9,900.

[59:01] How the mighty have fallen.

[59:04] Zach has won for 10,000 or best offer, which means, which means he probably offered late.

[59:11] He probably gave the guy 8,500 for it.

[59:18] Yeah, I don't know.

[59:31] I'm pretty, I'm pretty happy not buying games right now.

[59:39] My checking accounts just been getting bigger.

[59:44] Life is expensive in other areas for me.

[59:46] You guys know, I'm pretty transparent.

[59:48] Daycare is 6,000 a month.

[59:50] 6,000 a month for daycare.

[59:54] I'm also gank, I'm also saving up more money now than I ever have before because I'm worried.

[01:00:02] I'm worried.

[01:00:04] I'm worried about what will happen in the world.

[01:00:08] I'm worried about what's happening to my industry.

[01:00:11] I'm worried about what's happening to my company.

[01:00:14] I'm worried about what's happening to my clients.

[01:00:18] I'm worried that no one has really much job security anymore.

[01:00:25] I'm worried that even though you have a family and even though you've given over 10 years

[01:00:32] of your life to a company, I'm worried.

[01:00:34] That doesn't translate anymore into any loyalty or any sort of like seniority anymore.

[01:00:43] I'm just worried that it's really hard as a grown adult to plan out your 50s.

[01:00:53] Your 40s into your 50s in a lot of careers that aren't in your control.

[01:01:02] I'm not a lawyer who is a partner in a law firm.

[01:01:06] I'm just expecting the best, but planning for the worst is my new sort of MO.

[01:01:17] That's an anxiety that I have.

[01:01:22] Now the thing that alleviates some of my fear is that I know I'm really good at what I do.

[01:01:30] I know clients appreciate what I do, but I've just seen too many people who feel the same

[01:01:39] way get blindsided.

[01:01:42] I know one day it'll happen to me and it's just the way it goes.

[01:01:47] My dad got pushed into early retirement when he was 55.

[01:01:51] He retired at 55.

[01:01:54] The only difference is, is my dad spent 37 years at a company that was a multi-billion-dollar

[01:02:00] company that they gave equity.

[01:02:05] They had a pension.

[01:02:07] They matched 401K's the right way.

[01:02:10] They gave stock options.

[01:02:12] When my dad retired, he worked really hard his whole career, but when he was thrusted

[01:02:21] into retirement, he was always very smart with his money and then doesn't have to work

[01:02:26] again.

[01:02:28] I remember watching him when he was pushed out at an early age.

[01:02:35] It made him severely depressed.

[01:02:37] It wasn't about the money.

[01:02:38] It was a sense of purpose.

[01:02:42] Let's see if that worked.

[01:02:49] Are we back now?

[01:02:52] Are we back?

[01:02:57] We're back.

[01:02:59] I don't know.

[01:03:02] I just signed.

[01:03:05] Long story short.

[01:03:08] I love my job.

[01:03:09] I hope I can do it as long as I can possibly do it.

[01:03:12] There's good days or bad days, but I feel very blessed to wake up and have a creative job.

[01:03:18] I get finance, makes you more money.

[01:03:24] I'm always thinking about what's next and what's around the corner.

[01:03:27] I have an 11 month old baby.

[01:03:29] Cassie and Berthay is next month.

[01:03:31] He'll be one years old.

[01:03:32] He's so adorable.

[01:03:33] He's starting to walk with the help of his little walking toys.

[01:03:41] But I hope you guys are enjoying the show recently.

[01:03:45] I think it's been a lot of fun covering these launches.

[01:03:49] I still think we're not getting those, take my money now, OMG, I need this.

[01:03:58] I need this.

[01:03:59] The vibe has changed.

[01:04:00] Everyone knows it.

[01:04:02] I don't even think it's negative.

[01:04:04] I just think there's a new reality.

[01:04:07] When you wake up and this is the way the world is, it doesn't upset me.

[01:04:11] It's just so much easier than it's ever been before, not to throw money at these companies.

[01:04:19] It's not being negative, right?

[01:04:20] It's like, all right, go play the games.

[01:04:23] Go enjoy them on location more, support location pinball more.

[01:04:29] When I said on my last show, for those of you who are not members, I just think Ellie's

[01:04:35] now are like, you're in the chump club.

[01:04:39] I've said it, when you buy an Ellie of a Stern or Jersey Jack C.E., you are now in the

[01:04:46] chump club.

[01:04:49] There's two kinds of chumps.

[01:04:54] You're either a chump that hasn't done your homework and will lose a lot of money on

[01:05:03] the game and you'll kick yourself the entire time you ran at it, new in box right away

[01:05:11] because you could still go get that game.

[01:05:14] If you bought an X-Men Ellie right away, you're on the chump club because you could go

[01:05:19] get an X-Men Ellie now for like nine grand.

[01:05:22] You could have saved yourself $4,000.

[01:05:28] Why would you do that when you know?

[01:05:30] There's enough data that shows you just wait a little bit and you'll be able to get the

[01:05:34] same game for much less.

[01:05:36] The other side of the chump coin, if you will, are just people that have so much money

[01:05:42] that $13,000 is chump change.

[01:05:44] Now I've said this before.

[01:05:46] I think the majority of people, the majority that buy a Stern Ellie and a Jersey Jack C.E.,

[01:05:56] it's chump change to them.

[01:05:58] They don't care.

[01:05:59] They don't care that they're losing potentially thousands of dollars.

[01:06:04] They don't care to wait.

[01:06:06] These are men with money who don't want to wait.

[01:06:09] They just want to play now and they can afford to and they don't care.

[01:06:13] That's fine.

[01:06:15] I think there's more men who approached this hobby, who look at all this stuff like

[01:06:22] it's chump change, then there are men who are chumps.

[01:06:27] The real chumps, like you know what I'm saying, if you were to use it in a derogatory term,

[01:06:33] are the newbies.

[01:06:35] There are so many newbie chumps that came into Pimbald during COVID that got burned.

[01:06:41] They got burned.

[01:06:43] They listened to the newbie content creators.

[01:06:47] They ran at all the Ellie's and they got destroyed.

[01:06:52] You know, you don't hear people saying bye, bye, bye anymore.

[01:06:55] Let me go on right now.

[01:06:56] Let me go and see if King Kong Ellie is still available and it is.

[01:07:04] It's still available.

[01:07:11] All right.

[01:07:15] What's going to change between now and a month from now?

[01:07:24] I don't like you calling any person who buys an Ellie a chump.

[01:07:29] Oh, Albert, what's the matter?

[01:07:34] What's the matter?

[01:07:36] Does that upset you?

[01:07:38] Is that bullying people?

[01:07:40] Am I bullying rich white men for buying $13,000 Pimbald machines?

[01:07:46] Is that really upsetting you, Albert?

[01:07:52] Yeah, but you know what the difference is, we all know where chumps, like you know what

[01:08:00] Albert, like it's, when you go and talk to like other grown adults and you tell them

[01:08:10] that two Pimbald machines are $30,000.

[01:08:17] $30,000.

[01:08:21] They're like, what?

[01:08:24] Are you okay?

[01:08:27] Has your wife stopped putting out?

[01:08:29] Like are your kids flunking at a school?

[01:08:32] Like do you not realize there's like Europe and Tokyo to go visit like $30,000 for two

[01:08:43] of the limited games that are not even limited.

[01:08:45] And then you ask them, well, how much were those games five years ago?

[01:08:49] Well, I don't want to say, but Ellie's were like half that.

[01:08:54] You know how loud the talk like that because the bomb, they've doubled the bomb, right?

[01:08:58] Have they doubled the bomb?

[01:09:02] Are there double the toys in the games?

[01:09:05] No?

[01:09:06] Kelly, you have $1 million in Pimbald machines?

[01:09:11] $1 million.

[01:09:12] I mean, I don't God bless you.

[01:09:20] But any man who has $1 million in Pimbald machines has at least $20 million or more in net

[01:09:29] worth, right?

[01:09:31] I mean, probably 50, Kelly.

[01:09:35] I would assume more like 50 million.

[01:09:40] $1 million.

[01:09:48] I bet we all wish we put our Pimbald money into Netflix stock.

[01:09:51] Look at that stock.

[01:09:52] Damn.

[01:09:53] Damn, Gina.

[01:09:57] The, you know, when I walk into Automated, which grade is like, yeah, Mike's got about,

[01:10:04] easily Mike's got about $300,000, $400,000 in Pins.

[01:10:09] You know, all brand new right out of the box.

[01:10:18] Stocks are tankin' too, not Netflix stock.

[01:10:21] Look, the smartest move I made was not selling my apartment and putting it into the market

[01:10:28] before all this tear of stuff.

[01:10:29] I just threw it all against my house.

[01:10:34] I used to buy every LE.

[01:10:37] I mean, we all used to buy every LE.

[01:10:40] You know what I'm saying?

[01:10:41] It was a smart thing to do.

[01:10:44] It was a smart thing to do.

[01:10:48] Everybody look.

[01:10:50] Everybody look.

[01:10:51] It's $11.30.

[01:10:52] I want everybody to have a great Saturday with your families.

[01:10:56] I thank you all for hanging out here, talking a little Pimbald, talking a little life.

[01:11:02] I want everybody to be happy.

[01:11:04] I want everybody to make decisions that make you wake up in a good mood.

[01:11:09] I think there's a lot to love in King Kong.

[01:11:12] It's not my cup of tea with the art package.

[01:11:16] And I bet after I play one, I'm probably going to want to own one after playing guns and roses,

[01:11:21] which doesn't shoot very well.

[01:11:23] But I'm very content to wait.

[01:11:26] I'm going to stay in my life right now where I want to save money for things that matter more to me.

[01:11:33] That doesn't mean I won't buy new in-box Pimbal machines.

[01:11:37] But these games currently don't check enough boxes for me.

[01:11:41] They might check enough boxes for you.

[01:11:44] As I evaluate these companies, I want to just reiterate my commitment to each of you as

[01:11:50] Canadian watchers and club members that I will do my best to give you a balanced, objective point of view.

[01:11:59] But it's all an opinion.

[01:12:02] It's all an opinion.

[01:12:04] There's a million people interviewing all the Stern folks.

[01:12:06] There's a million people doing all the interviews and the circuses.

[01:12:09] In the end, if you make a great game based on a theme people want, you don't have to do any interviews.

[01:12:18] You don't have to fly Canada over.

[01:12:21] You don't have to make $100,000 launch videos.

[01:12:24] You don't have to do anything.

[01:12:25] You don't have to speak to anybody.

[01:12:27] If you nail it, the game will speak for itself.

[01:12:30] It'll sell like hotcakes and you'll be fine.

[01:12:34] I think what I'm noticing in the modern Pimbal world now is that in lieu of magic, there's just a lot of talk.

[01:12:43] There's a lot of content.

[01:12:45] There's a lot of salesmanship.

[01:12:48] There's a lot of marketing.

[01:12:49] There's a lot of, there's a lot of like trying to get you hyped.

[01:12:53] But I don't think people feel the level of excitement you did years ago when new in box Ellie's hit.

[01:13:04] You don't feel nearly as excited to spend 13 or 15 as you did when an Ellie was 7,500.

[01:13:12] And we were getting better themes.

[01:13:15] And so as much as these companies would like you to forget what it used to be,

[01:13:23] I don't think you have.

[01:13:25] And I think that's the big challenge.

[01:13:28] It's not enough newbies have come into this hobby that are going to drive the modern machine of these companies at these prices.

[01:13:36] It's not going to work out for them.

[01:13:37] And they know that.

[01:13:39] And there are games piling up.

[01:13:42] Orders aren't rolling in like they used to.

[01:13:45] And it's almost enane to me that these companies haven't figured it out.

[01:13:49] If you're going to charge $13,000 for an Ellie, you only make 500 Ellie's.

[01:13:54] Don't be jackasses and greedy stern.

[01:13:56] It doesn't work anymore.

[01:13:59] You used to make 500 Ellie's for 7,500.

[01:14:03] Heck, they were like 5,500 back in.

[01:14:05] Okay, but I'm willing to give it to you.

[01:14:07] If you want to charge 13,000 for an Ellie, only 500 bros, you've got to, you've got to give some value back to the customers.

[01:14:18] All the money went to you.

[01:14:20] And all the money that was lost was your customer base.

[01:14:22] So are you surprised your customer base is now walking away?

[01:14:26] Even the great Keith L. Win, even with all your like marketing people that don't even have any, any.

[01:14:34] Cloud or credibility with the people, people don't wake up.

[01:14:38] Nobody just wakes up on a random day and says, honey, I'm going to go buy a 13,000 dollar pinball machine.

[01:14:45] The people that love pinball, you know who they are.

[01:14:49] And too many of these companies turn their back on those people with greed, over making, over supplying the collector amount.

[01:14:59] And it's bought, and it's come back to bite you.

[01:15:02] And nobody has the guts.

[01:15:03] Stern, did it once with Metallica remastered Ellie and they seemingly don't want to do it again.

[01:15:11] Go right back to a thousand.

[01:15:12] Oh, 9,000, it's a thousand.

[01:15:14] It's a, and you can't even sell 932.

[01:15:20] In Ellie should sell out day one.

[01:15:23] So should a CEO.

[01:15:25] The more you keep them, yeah, we're going to make as many as people want Harry Potter CE, the way they're going to launch it.

[01:15:33] It's not going to work out.

[01:15:35] It's not going to work out.

[01:15:54] I'll turn the ads off.

[01:15:55] We'll do the superchats.

[01:15:57] But speak more candidly like that.

[01:15:59] I mean, that's what I enjoyed doing because I think it's wake up time.

[01:17:05] If I gave you just one thousand dollars, right?

[01:17:10] In singles, I gave you a thousand of them.

[01:17:14] And I took four dollars away.

[01:17:18] Has it changed anything?

[01:17:20] Do you feel like you now need to like make unlimited CEs to recoup that four million dollars?

[01:17:27] Nothing.
