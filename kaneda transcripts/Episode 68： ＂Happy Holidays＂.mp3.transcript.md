[00:00] It's the most wonderful time of the year

[00:07] With the kids jingle belling and everyone telling you be a good cheer

[00:21] Happy Halloween everybody, welcome to episode 68 of Canadian Pimball Podcast

[00:30] First I need to do a shout out to Megatron

[00:35] Megatron is not the Decepticon leader

[00:39] Megatron is the adorable new dog that Tiger Law and Pav are taking care of

[00:46] He has a ear infection that he is getting over

[00:50] So I know that this podcast probably makes that ear infection worse

[00:55] So we hope Megatron has a speedy recovery

[00:58] Alright, this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast is a total audible for me from what I was planning to air today

[01:08] I have to say, you know, I have had an interesting 24 hours, a lot of reflection, a lot of stupid stuff going on

[01:18] And I want to just let you guys know who listened to Canada's Pimball Podcast

[01:24] But I've always appreciated everyone tuning into the show, I've always appreciated all the feedback, I've always appreciated all the information people send me on a daily weekly basis about this hobby

[01:37] And the reason why I love doing this podcast is because there are so many passionate people about this hobby

[01:47] But I have to say, you know, I have made a mistake and I've let this hobby get to me on many levels

[01:55] And it's taken over a lot of my time

[01:58] And I have become the exact thing that I just don't want to become

[02:04] And that is overly obsessed with the hobby

[02:09] And some of you may have heard, may have not have heard, I put up a sort of a Pimball rant, me versus Pinside, Post Last Night, that I...

[02:18] After listening to it a few times, I'm like, this is ridiculous, this is coming down, what the hell are you doing Chris?

[02:26] Why are you like in such an angry way right now attacking Pinside and the moderators and what not?

[02:35] And even though I still have my strong beliefs about how that site is run, it's still that is not who I want to become

[02:44] Someone who gets to the point where they're saying such hateful things

[02:49] And because I'll tell you why, because I truly believe that when you spend too much time on Pinside, it turns everybody into an alternate version of themselves

[02:59] Which is normally not the better version, which is why we always hear when you meet people at shows and when you meet people out

[03:06] Everyone is really awesome, really cool, and it's nothing like what we experience online

[03:11] And that is the truth

[03:13] And there comes a point to where I personally look at myself in my own behavior and I'm like, well, this isn't who you are

[03:21] And if this is making you become this way, then something's got to change

[03:26] And you have to change, you have to make that change because it's not going to become...

[03:31] It's not going to come because of outside forces and people making threats to you, it's not going to come from manufacturers saying things to you

[03:40] It's not going to come from different Pinside members saying things about you

[03:44] It's just up to me to make these changes that eliminate the sides of my life

[03:50] That I'm even ashamed of and I'm embarrassed by it

[03:54] And the fact that I've gotten so deep into this hobby where it turns me into an angry individual that's really hostile and mad towards certain individuals is not good

[04:08] And it doesn't make me feel good at all

[04:11] It doesn't make me feel good to say things that are negative

[04:17] You know, as much as part of me has personal opinions about certain individuals and certain companies

[04:26] It's just annoying, it's annoying for me to see myself share information and do things that just aren't...

[04:35] For no other good than the trying, get the truth out there about Pimbal

[04:40] And when I sit back and I just ask myself, what the fuck are you doing Chris?

[04:46] Why is this even important?

[04:48] This search for the truth about Pimbal and Pimbal companies and machines and when they're going to ship

[04:54] And what's really going on over there

[04:57] I know this is of interest to everyone who follows the hobby day in and day out

[05:01] And that is what we do on the podcast

[05:04] But I have to say, I'm looking at the next few months of this hobby, the next two months of this hobby

[05:10] And I'm really, really not seeing much for me to get excited about or want to keep following it daily

[05:18] I think we're at a period now where we know which games are supposed to ship by the end of the year

[05:23] Which is alien, it's magic girl, and it's Batman 66

[05:28] I hope those three titles ship

[05:31] I hope they ship when everyone says they're going to ship

[05:34] This podcast can affect any of that

[05:37] And don't blame me for things not going the way they are supposed to go

[05:43] These companies are all adults and they will make things happen by their own hard work

[05:49] And by their own timelines

[05:52] Nothing I can do to change that

[05:55] I can't be speculating anymore about these companies over the holidays

[05:59] I guess what I'm trying to say in a nutshell is that I've reached another point

[06:03] Where I just personally need another break

[06:06] And I need a break for a few reasons because it's just taking a lot of toll on me

[06:11] And I need to go and I need to just get out of it for a while

[06:15] I need to just get out of caring so much about what goes on every day in this hobby

[06:20] And planning my next podcast and saying these things about these companies and speculating what's going on

[06:25] It's not... it just ruins the hobby for me

[06:29] And it's my fault, I got too deep into it

[06:32] I said things that were too extreme

[06:36] I jumped into situations that were confrontational

[06:41] I created situations that were confrontational

[06:45] Because I know those were the conversations that a lot of people wanted me to do and wanted me to say

[06:49] And I know a lot of people agree with what I do and they fully understand it

[06:55] But it just ruins my ability to enjoy it

[07:00] And this is a hobby about a toy, right?

[07:02] Nothing of what we're discussing is really that important

[07:06] None of this matters at all in life

[07:09] I'm also just really, really tired of my character constantly being called into question

[07:16] By individuals I don't even personally know

[07:19] Message board people saying, this is who I really am

[07:23] And look, it's impossible for anybody to really know who anybody really is

[07:29] The way people behave on these forums

[07:32] And the podcast that I was supposed to put up today that I'm not

[07:37] Was an interview I did with Tim Crowley, you know him as Cornelius

[07:42] And we had to find talk about Pimball, we had a great chat about Pimball

[07:47] And here's an individual that's also very confrontational, very contentious on the site

[07:53] And it's like everybody I've ever met

[07:56] They've always been nice in person and they're always different people than what they become on Pinsite

[08:03] And it's no excuse, we're all responsible for our own behaviors

[08:08] We all make our own beds when we say starting things

[08:11] And I guess I'm just at this point where I don't enjoy it right now

[08:19] And again, there's no one to blame here

[08:22] This is not like this is all on me

[08:25] Like if I'm gonna blame anybody for why I feel this way, I'm blaming myself

[08:29] It's for things that I've done and I just want to focus my life more

[08:33] And I don't want to be on Pinsite every day at work trying to get information

[08:37] I want to focus more on my job, I want to focus on the people that I care about, I want to focus on the people that care about me

[08:43] And I want to continue to cultivate the friends I've made in this hobby and look at it from afar this holiday

[08:50] I don't know if I'll come back and podcast when the holidays are over

[08:54] But I really want to just enjoy my holiday, I enjoyed my summer when I took a break

[09:01] I know that for many of you this sucks and you really look forward to listening to this podcast on a weekly basis

[09:07] The good news is there are lots of other pinball podcasts that are out there that are also podcasting very frequently

[09:14] I'm sure they'll be happy that this listener base will go over there and find new homes with them on a weekly basis

[09:22] It's been fun and it's been a good ride with you guys

[09:28] And I really appreciate all the time you guys gave me

[09:33] As much as this is a lot of time on my end, it's a lot of time on your end

[09:38] And I want everyone, if I could ask people just to be patient in the hobby and don't get into deep

[09:48] And don't get to a place where you lose enjoyment

[09:53] Don't get to a place where you start to care too much about a misdeadline here and there

[09:59] Too much about what people are saying about this company and that person, all the rumors, it's pinball

[10:06] And people can spend their money and they will spend their money where they want to

[10:10] And that's sort of like the root of all the arguing, all the bickering

[10:14] And so much about like, is this worth it? Like you're an idiot for buying this and you're more in like, can't we just all at one point reach a point

[10:22] Where everyone just says these are all grown men and they'll do what they want with their money

[10:27] They'll do what they want, everyone has all the information they need to know about every company that's out there

[10:32] Whether that information is good or bad and everyone can decide what they will do with their money

[10:36] And that is not up for me to decide what you should do, it's not up for me anymore to recommend what you do

[10:43] Do what you will, do what you will with your money and I hope everyone gets the product that they pay for

[10:49] That's it really on this short episode I just want to let you guys know have a happy Halloween

[10:55] And I'm taking off the next couple months to just enjoy my holidays and focus on my career, focus on my family

[11:04] And focus on other things that are far more important than this hobby

[11:09] And I hope everyone is flipping their alien and flipping their magic girl and flipping their Batman on Christmas

[11:16] Alright, I will go on the record for saying that I'm rooting for everyone to get their games

[11:20] Have a great day and we will talk to you maybe sometime in the future
