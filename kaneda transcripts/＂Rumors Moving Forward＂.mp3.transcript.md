[00:00] Well, that was a really interesting 24 hours of pinball podcasting.

[00:05] 24 hours ago, I was really excited.

[00:08] A lot of information came my way from a source that I trusted with this information.

[00:15] And I got really excited.

[00:16] You know me, I do a podcast about rumors, about news, about speculation, about what's going

[00:21] on in the pinball hobby.

[00:22] And I really didn't expect anything to happen this week other than the ramp up to TPS.

[00:28] And that was it.

[00:29] And then all of a sudden, these two sort of bombshell pieces of news are brought to my

[00:34] attention.

[00:35] And again, these were brought to my attention.

[00:36] I did not go fishing for any of this stuff.

[00:39] And so what did I do?

[00:40] I put up two shows, one about the Big Lebowski and one about Alien Pinball.

[00:45] And after listening to both of those shows, there's a reason why I pulled both of them

[00:48] down.

[00:49] And I've been struggling with this all day.

[00:51] And this has been frustrating me all day because I don't like to give you information

[00:57] that is incorrect, that is false.

[01:01] If I know rumors, I need to do a better job.

[01:04] And this is my fault of delivering that news to you as a rumor, as something for you to

[01:09] chew on that I'm hearing, but delivering it in a way that I did.

[01:14] And I went back and I listened to it.

[01:16] It sounded very, very much like I was 100% confirming this to be the case.

[01:20] Now on the Big Lebowski, I was not 100% confirming it, but it turned out to be false.

[01:27] And I woke up the next day and everything I had said on that show was not validated by

[01:32] the people close to the project.

[01:35] In fact, I heard that Barry said he wishes the news was true, but it's not.

[01:38] And people should not get their hopes up about that game.

[01:41] And I feel really bad for all the people who are in on that game, who heard that show.

[01:47] And all of a sudden, God excited that they were going to get their Big Lebowski.

[01:51] And that really, really, really sucks.

[01:53] And I am really sorry and I am very frustrated that I caused that and this show created that

[01:59] in people.

[02:00] All right.

[02:01] So that sucks.

[02:02] And that's why I yanked that show down right away because clearly the information I got

[02:05] on the Big Lebowski was not accurate.

[02:08] And it sounds like what I'm hearing now.

[02:10] And again, this is just like take it for what it's worth.

[02:12] I don't really know if this is going to be something where like everyone's going to

[02:15] win in the end, but you're just going to have to find out.

[02:18] I really, and it's hard for me.

[02:20] And this is a thing too is, is people were saying to me, well, did you validate the

[02:24] information?

[02:26] How does one validate information like this?

[02:30] You know, Barry, Yop, the manufacturer, they don't talk to me.

[02:34] And if my information is correct, they're not going to confirm it.

[02:36] This is the problem with rumors.

[02:38] And this is why from now on, on this show, if I hear a rumor, I am going to say this

[02:44] is a rumor I heard and you can take it for what it's worth.

[02:48] And it's not going to be like me confirming that this is happening.

[02:51] The only time I should confirm for you, the listener, if something is going to happen,

[02:56] is if I've seen it with my own eyes, okay?

[02:59] And that's just the respectful thing to do, okay?

[03:04] So the other thing was alien pinball.

[03:08] And the fact that alien pinball is going to be manufactured in the United States.

[03:13] And that the pinball brothers have been in contact with the contract manufacturer.

[03:19] And that is what they're planning to do.

[03:21] And they're also planning to make possibly queen with that contract manufacturer.

[03:26] Now I was very, very adamant on this being accurate.

[03:29] And I am still adamant that this is going to happen.

[03:33] That alien pinball will be remanufactured in the United States by a contract manufacturer.

[03:40] And I think we should hear that news pretty soon.

[03:43] If that news is incorrect, if that news is wrong, okay?

[03:47] If that news is like absolutely false and not happening, then the reason why I said I

[03:52] kind of want to just like pack up my bags and leave this hobby.

[03:55] Because then people are just lying to my face.

[03:59] I mean, I literally have a text chain with someone who, you know, with people that you

[04:04] know in the industry and in the hobby, I literally have a text chain in which I am asking,

[04:08] are you 100% sure I can report on this?

[04:11] And this is happening.

[04:12] Yes, 100%.

[04:14] And but again, that's the lesson I've learned today is so what?

[04:19] Right?

[04:20] It's just their word.

[04:21] I haven't seen it.

[04:22] I don't know.

[04:23] It's exactly happening.

[04:24] I don't know when it's happening.

[04:25] You know, then it starts to open up.

[04:27] Well, is it CGC?

[04:28] Is it American pinball?

[04:29] Like, who's going to actually do it?

[04:31] And then even even the people that were saying they were 100% sure about stuff, then when

[04:36] I got frustrated and started pressing like all of a sudden, like people started backtracking

[04:41] a little bit and it's like, you got to be fucking kidding me.

[04:45] And this is what's frustrating for me.

[04:47] And this is my fault.

[04:48] Again, I take 100% blame because I have the mic.

[04:51] It's my show.

[04:52] When I hear rumors to jump to report them without trying to find if their valid or not is something

[05:00] that I'm just going to do a better job of in the future for you.

[05:03] And if I hear a rumor, again, I will report it as a rumor, not as 100% happening because

[05:10] it's just it's so frustrating.

[05:12] It is so frustrating to have somebody reach out to you, say Chris, I know this for a fact.

[05:19] This is happening.

[05:20] You know, blah, blah, blah.

[05:22] And then I say it.

[05:23] And then the next minute I get an email being like, what are you talking about?

[05:26] Like that's absolutely false.

[05:27] So that's just the way it's going to have to be is all rumors are going to be delivered

[05:32] to you as like here's something I'm hearing.

[05:35] But my confirmation of these will not happen unless I've seen it with my own eyes or unless

[05:42] I have like absolutely 100% sort of validation of what I'm saying.

[05:49] Now it's hard to for me on this show because you remember like so much, so much of what

[05:55] I used to give you guys in terms of like what's happening at highway, what's happening at

[05:59] DUDGE, all the things, all the problems.

[06:02] Those were people that were emailing me what was going on behind the scenes.

[06:07] A lot of those people want to remain anonymous.

[06:11] And even when we had that information, no one even believed it.

[06:14] And now I have information that you want to believe because we've been accurate in the

[06:18] past and then it turns out to be fake.

[06:20] So that sucks.

[06:21] And again, I apologized to everyone who felt like the information was inaccurate.

[06:26] And then again, even as like earlier today, it's like,

[06:29] someone's telling me Brian Eddie's doing a via or three.

[06:32] And then you know what happens immediately?

[06:33] I get an email saying, nope, it's not.

[06:35] It's still Dennis Nordman and it's Ferris.

[06:39] And then Brian Eddie's doing Godzilla.

[06:41] Like that's the, and then see, it's just this, I just have to shelve this stuff because

[06:47] I don't know who to believe.

[06:49] I don't know who to believe.

[06:51] And I'm perpetuating the problem, right?

[06:55] Because if I'm getting all these people telling me this is what's happening.

[06:58] This is what's definitely happening.

[07:00] And then I say, sure, sure.

[07:01] Yeah, okay.

[07:02] And then I talk about it as if it's happening.

[07:05] And then every, every other day, it switches.

[07:09] It switches.

[07:10] It's jaw's happening.

[07:11] It's superman 78 coming out.

[07:12] Is it not?

[07:13] Is it?

[07:14] You know, what's the original IP that's going to happen from CGC is cactus canyonex.

[07:18] And, and look, normally I love and I enjoy giving you rumors and speculation.

[07:25] I think normally we do a really good job at it.

[07:28] But this time, no, I didn't do a great job of giving you guys the information in the

[07:33] right way and in the right context.

[07:36] Okay.

[07:37] So I'm just trying to think of everything else I told you like that I just want to clarify.

[07:41] Look, I still, I still think you're going to see alien pinball remanufactured.

[07:48] All right.

[07:49] And I'm still confident that it's going to be Chicago gaming.

[07:51] It might be another manufacturer.

[07:54] But again, who would, who else would it be other than American pinball?

[07:57] That's got to be one of those two.

[07:59] So that is what I have heard will be coming out again.

[08:04] Take it for what it's worth.

[08:07] Will this show go away if it doesn't happen?

[08:09] Like I promise.

[08:10] I have to be honest.

[08:12] I don't know.

[08:14] Like I'm really bummed out that people were telling me they had 100% accurate information.

[08:19] But we're going to have to wait to see this one play out because here's the thing with

[08:22] alien.

[08:24] And what I've been told that this thing is going to play out pretty quickly.

[08:27] And we might even hear news at TPS surrounding it.

[08:30] All right.

[08:31] So that's just what I wanted to do.

[08:33] I wanted to yank down those episodes.

[08:35] I want to say to all you guys who have listened to this podcast for 300 and like 26 episodes

[08:41] that we sometimes, you know, fumble the ball.

[08:44] We sometimes make a mistake.

[08:45] I'm not an ego maniac who's like not going to admit when he fucks up and makes a mistake.

[08:52] And again, I'm sorry.

[08:53] Because it's not responsible of me to jump in with my excitement and confirm things for

[09:00] you.

[09:01] And in the future, again, I will make sure that stuff will be delivered more as rumor and

[09:06] not as fact.

[09:07] And I think that is a major, major difference in delivering a piece of information.

[09:14] And I think it changes the way people absorb it.

[09:16] I think it changes the expectations around it.

[09:19] And I think it also doesn't put anyone on the hook for being absolutely certain of something

[09:28] that isn't a certainty.

[09:30] And that's always the challenge when you do these kinds of shows.

[09:34] And I think other pinball podcasters out there know exactly what I'm talking about.

[09:38] And most of them probably just sit on the rumors and watch me just do stupid shit like

[09:44] what happened over the last 48 hours.

[09:46] So that's all I wanted to say.

[09:49] I look forward to going to TPS.

[09:52] I have another interview that I did around pinball themes.

[09:55] I might just put that up before the show.

[09:57] But I'm just I'm done with these rumors.

[10:00] I'm not reporting them like this anymore.

[10:02] I'm not going to have an arrogant five days of canada.

[10:08] I'm going to go to TPS.

[10:10] Enjoy the show with you guys.

[10:12] Enjoy the twippies.

[10:13] Let's see what happens.

[10:15] Like I think a lot of the stuff that we were talking about, we're just going to have to

[10:18] see what happens.

[10:20] And I appreciate all of you for listening to the show.

[10:23] And I hope you stick with the show even when we do make a mistake every now and then.

[10:28] And I hope you can forgive, forgive me for making some of those errors because I do try to

[10:33] make this the most entertaining and the best podcast possible.

[10:38] And that is what I try to do for you on a weekly basis.

[10:41] And it's not always perfect.

[10:42] And I'm not always perfect.

[10:44] And I do also care about what you guys think about this show and its credibility because

[10:50] that's important to me.

[10:51] I want to give you not just the most entertaining show, but I also want to give you a show that

[10:56] gives you information that is important to know and information that you can act upon.

[11:00] Okay.

[11:01] And I'm going to do a better job of making sure that I try as hard as I can to confirm

[11:07] stuff before sharing it as fact.

[11:11] And if I just think it's a rumor, I'll let you know what the rumor is and I'll let

[11:14] you make up your own mind on it.

[11:16] And I think that's a fair ask and I think that's a fair approach moving forward on the

[11:20] show as that sound.

[11:21] All right.

[11:22] I'm not even going to have like outro music.

[11:23] I'm just going to sort of fade away.
