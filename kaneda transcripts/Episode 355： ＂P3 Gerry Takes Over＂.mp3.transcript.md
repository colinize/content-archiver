[00:00] Did you know I am a pioneer?

[00:07] I'm out on a secret mission

[00:13] I travel the galaxy and far beyond

[00:21] Welcome to Episode 355 of Canadian Spinball Podcast, Amir Hose Canada, Happy Monday Morning Everybody

[00:35] On this episode, Jerry Stelenberg from P3 Multimorphic will join the show

[00:41] And as I said, we are going to change it up a little bit

[00:44] Jerry will interview me and we are going to flip the script and change seats for once

[00:50] Now, keep in mind, Jerry is an engineer, he is not a podcaster

[00:54] So it might start off a little bit slow but stick with it

[00:57] We get to all the important questions that I know you want to ask of Jerry

[01:02] And no questions are at a bounds or off limits

[01:06] So it's a really interesting chat and I think you are going to hear what their strategy is

[01:11] And it sounds like it's all going to come down to one very important thing happening for this company moving forward

[01:18] Before we do that, I just want to clarify for some of you out there that I'm still in on Willy Wonka

[01:25] I'm not bailing on the game just yet or at all

[01:29] I just have questions about the code that I think a lot of you have

[01:33] And I know Joe Katz was at the New York City Pimball Championships this weekend

[01:38] And someone I know was talking to him and they asked the question about whether or not we're going to see

[01:45] A movie clips with audio in the game and how that will be represented

[01:50] And so the answer I'm just paraphrasing is that there will be some wizard modes in which you will play some of the scenes from the movie that you love

[01:59] Now what we're still not getting confirmation on is how those scenes will come to life

[02:05] Will it be more of sort of like what we're seeing with the Wankatanium mode when he's on the ship

[02:11] And you hear the callouts from that scene but we do not see the video clips coinciding with it

[02:18] So more to come on this, I'm actually going to talk to Jersey Jack this week not on a podcast

[02:23] But just calm up and ask him what the deal is and what we can expect

[02:27] And I know for a lot of you out there who have shot the game, you know what I'm talking about

[02:32] This game is a magical shooter and we just hope that it checks every single box

[02:37] Because ultimately I think all of you out there when you buy these pinball games you don't really want there to be compromises

[02:44] And you want to make sure that the game you buy checks all the necessary boxes and for most of us out there

[02:50] For us to buy a game we want to own a game and for the long term longevity of that title the code needs to be pretty damn good

[02:59] And I'm seeing it I'm seeing it in the monster's thread and the black knight thread

[03:03] Lots of moping and moaning and groaning about code and so I think what we're all starting to learn is that in the pinball world

[03:11] There might be different kinds of games in terms of how they're coded some of them might be coded for more simple shallow rule sets

[03:19] That are easier to jump in and play immediately and some are going to be a lot deeper

[03:24] You know so I consider it to be like some races are a marathon and some are sprint

[03:30] And people love Iron Man it's not the deepest code and people love TNA and it's not the deepest code

[03:36] But you know I think people just want to know what to expect and if they know that going into it

[03:42] It helps them make up their mind without having to buy the game and then realize it's shallow when they thought it would be much deeper

[03:48] And I think the game where that's happening the most is the monsters

[03:52] I think a lot of people who bought the monsters or who are playing it

[03:55] I think they thought it would be very similar to Batman 66 and it's not it's not even close

[04:01] So let me air the interview with Jerry Stelemberg and I hope you enjoy it now remember he's interviewing me so here it goes

[04:10] Good evening everybody and welcome to episode two of the P3 pinball podcast

[04:15] The only pinball podcast smart enough to skip episode one because as all true pinheads know episode one was a flop

[04:24] So my name is Jerry Stelemberg and I'm recording this from multi morphex brand new production facility in round rock Texas

[04:30] Today we're going to discuss a number of things about pinball's past it's present in its future

[04:35] I want to dive into the business of pinball the engineering and design of games the varying opinions about what makes pinball fun

[04:41] What we shouldn't see in future pinball games and of course everybody's favorite topic pinball marketing

[04:48] Now since at least three or maybe four of the 2000 plus listeners of this podcast are super vocal about my knowing absolutely nothing about any of these topics

[05:00] I figured I should bring in an expert so without farther ado I'd like to offer a warm P3 pinball podcast welcome to the never shy

[05:10] The never boring the genius marketer the man who just two weeks ago said pinball podcasters should stop interviewing other pinball podcasters

[05:20] The two-time Twippy award-winning pinball podcaster Chris canada calores hey Chris well back

[05:28] Yeah, thanks for having me. I've been waiting to come back on your show for a while

[05:32] So it's exciting to be back on the show thanks for thanks for the invite

[05:36] Absolutely always a pleasure to talk to you. I'm glad you could take the time. So let's get started if you don't mind just because we probably have some new listeners since last time

[05:46] Can you can you do me a favor and then give us your background tell me about your career and maybe how you got into pinball?

[05:52] Yeah, I mean I do marketing for Fortune 500 companies but I grew up in the arcade scene in the 80s and 90s

[06:00] And I didn't get into pinball until about four or five years ago and since then I become somewhat addicted to the silver ball because I love the randomness of pinball every game is different unlike Donkey Kong where you just memorizing the code so yeah so I'm I'm I'm I got bit by the bug a few years ago

[06:18] Yeah, it seems pretty common we all do but okay, so if I understand correctly you make a career out of understanding people and figuring out the ways

[06:28] To get them interested in products from the companies who represent correct yeah pretty much I mean that's a good assessment of it. Okay, and of course we all know it helps when the products offers something that meets the demands and desires of the customers right.

[06:44] Absolutely. Yeah, so let's let's jump straight into pinball and talk about it in that regard. Let's do it. All right, so you've been pretty vocal lately as have I about most new pinball machines released over the last few years.

[06:57] And I actually say over the last few decades being largely unchanged and having basically no innovative features. So given that most machines from the last 10 or so years or from 10 years ago from Stern are about the same as they are today back when Stern was was you know they were struggling they were the only manufacture.

[07:17] Why do you think pinball's been going through a resurgence?

[07:21] I mean I think the the resurgence of pinball there's a few things I play I think that a lot of people who grew up with pinball in the I would say the heyday of pinball machines were late 80s early 90s in terms of you know that I think the Valley Williams error that people consider to be the best of the best I think the people who grew up then are now older they have disposable income and they now want to put fun toys in their home.

[07:47] So I think that's one of the things that's driving a lot of the home buyers right I also think there is a new resurgence of going out for entertainment and I think people are starting to realize that bars are more fun when there are pinball machines inside them so location play home collecting and then of course you've got the tournament scene which I think is is fueling a lot of the location play because if you can put pinball and bars and have leg nights you're going to get more people to buy your beer.

[08:16] So I think those three things are happening right now.

[08:19] So I think it's fair to say probably that the tournament is more of a result of the resurgence that the people playing in tournaments growing so fast is more of a result of the resurgence then then a cause of the resurgence but let me ask you a deeper question.

[08:34] Do you feel like in the 2008-2009 timeframe the people with that growing disposable income that you're just talking about they have that income then too right we're talking about people that are 30s and 40s and 50s we're not talking about people who are just turning 20 or 25.

[08:50] Yeah I would say though like are you saying they had the income back in the 90s or early 2000s no no they they had the income in 2008-2009 why weren't they buying machines then why was starting struggling so badly just 10 years ago.

[09:03] I mean I would say if you look at the games back then most of them weren't that good the games are pretty crappy I mean there's there's I mean if it wasn't for Lord the rings saving Stern pinball a lot of those games back then were pretty mediocre they look compared to games today they looked bad you know there it was kind of on its last lifeline and there's a few good hits in there that saved them but for the most part those games did not seem like people wanted to own them in their home.

[09:32] And there were no and our case were like dead around then.

[09:36] Yeah yeah for sure but so games like Lord of the Rings and a couple others kept them alive I would almost argue that the variety of choices that the ability for new manufacturers to start popping up and creating games that had different themes that they might have different artwork that some consider better some consider worse but the variety of games helped the resurgence and the reason that more and more of them were not good enough for the game.

[10:01] The reason that more manufacturers could you know could come up could start up could do these things is because of new technologies and new tools that became more prevalent in in general industry but things like our p rock boards like C and C machines like 3D printer software tools and frameworks for code and art development those kind of things they've made it possible for other companies to start up.

[10:24] And they've made it possible for people like I don't know like you and many people that play pinball a lot and have our own ideas for potentially what would make a pinball machine good these tools gave us the ability to create machines and having those choices just if I went to stern in 2008 and I say okay I want to buy a pinball machine what you have and I looked at the two options they had I'd be like well I don't want either one of those or maybe I do but the odds of me liking both of them or one of them was low but now that we have 10 choices or 15 choices.

[10:53] The odds of liking something are better so it it brings more people to the community.

[10:58] I mean I definitely agree with that I mean nobody wants to be in an industry in which there is no variety right I mean stern had a monopoly on pinball and we all know that when you have a monopoly in an entertainment industry the product doesn't need to innovate absolutely.

[11:15] Yeah and I think we can agree I've heard you talk about it before I've talked about a lot too but the research in pinball is absolutely not because of rules set complexity complex deep rule sets in my opinion have hurt have hurt pinball they've made games not approachable and it's also obviously not because of increases in price.

[11:38] Right I mean back in 2008 what was a stern game like 30 500 bucks I don't remember I didn't buy any new box games at that time I they were definitely around like 4,000 which is kind of crazy when you think about it right now or or double that if not more.

[11:54] We are there are numbers of course and the sales that you've mentioned about about stern cost to build versus everybody else is cost to build but yeah no I agree with you.

[12:04] So given that all of these companies are starting up and we have all these choices there's only a finite market size and I've heard you talk about this before too but I think it's worth discussing again can the markets sustain all these guys.

[12:21] Absolutely not. No way.

[12:23] Absolutely not. Right and that's obvious I think everybody would agree.

[12:27] So the question is how do we take this market take this idea of a pinball machine and continue to grow the market and not just you know have all these companies fighting for the same for the same piece of the pie and then dying.

[12:43] Right well I guess the thing is you could look at it you you have to ask yourself I mean if you look at the market has the market have we reach sort of market saturation like are we going to be able to get new people in the market.

[12:56] So we're going to be able to get new people into buying pinball machines it's easier to get people to play pinball machines right but converting those people into buyers at this price point is much more difficult.

[13:08] So it's hard to tell Jerry because I think the thing is we don't have numbers like I don't know how many games a year any of these manufacturers sell.

[13:18] So if 10,000 units a year is market saturation I don't know if it's 15,000 but I you know the way if I were to look at it through a traditional marketing lens the way you would want to sort of grow the market is to develop a product that would get new people to be attracted to pinball who might not be attracted to the pinball that is currently available.

[13:45] So it's really with that of course that makes sense. There's another way to do it though and that's to lower the cost of development and then this is counterintuitive but lower the cost of the games.

[14:01] It's counterintuitive because they're rising they're rising now and people are making more and more money but the reality is stern making more money and all these small companies that are selling machines and only sell 100 or 500 a year whatever they don't have the margins they don't have the volume to create margins to make a lot of money.

[14:20] So these rising prices are only rising because they have to raise them to even be able to pay their paychecks.

[14:27] So that means it's really difficult to get the price down.

[14:32] That's what yes the current pinball paradigm is almost impossible to get the price down because small companies simply can't afford to build machines at lower prices.

[14:44] So that's why multi-morphic exists. That's why I joined the pinball community. That's why I started the company in this market because I personally think that the only way to make this industry survive or to even grow long term is to change completely the paradigm.

[15:04] And to be clear I'm talking about changing the business paradigm. I'm not talking about taking what makes pinball pinball and changing it like rolling the ball around a play field and interacting with physical objects. I'm not talking about that. That's pinball. That's what needs to stay the same.

[15:21] But I'm talking about changing the pinball paradigm. It has a quick aside actually. There are still people who lay the P3 and say it's not pinball. What do I say to them?

[15:32] But Jerry I guess the question I have is what lead you to I mean that's but that's a big that's a big sort of mission statement right to make pinball survive for the long term we have to change the paradigm.

[15:44] What year did you have that sort of feeling because over the last seven years Stern is booming right selling 10,000 plus games a year.

[15:57] It doesn't seem to be slowing down so that assumption is the foundation that there needs to be change but yet they're but they've been so successful so.

[16:09] But you just told me 30 a couple of minutes ago that you did think the current the current business the current state was sustainable.

[16:19] Well it's it's it's sustainable for Stern right so if Stern can own 85% of the market let's just say hypothetically and sell 10,000 games a year right and make X amount of millions of dollars a year and stay profitable and deliver four games a year.

[16:36] And Stern you know and everyone there's making money.

[16:39] You know are it so that I guess the question is like that they could sustain that for indefinite amounts of time.

[16:49] And that's fine for Stern that's not good for all these other people with pinball dreams who want to create more themes and create more choices for you and do all these things all that dies right.

[17:00] Well so then the question is how do you take some of Stern's market share away versus how do you create a whole new market.

[17:11] I agree with that right and so that's the challenge is it's and shows P three trying to create a new market like a new entertainment platform versus stealing some of Stern's market share or trying to do both at the same time.

[17:25] Well I don't think we need to we need to choose one of the other I think if we come out with the machine that interest people whether or not it opens the door to a larger market that's that's great if it just takes market share that's great to but ultimately we want to develop pinball machines but we want to develop pinball machines that we feel like brings brings to pinball things that people want but in a way that that we can sustain the market that we can allow other people to help create content that people can.

[17:54] You know, realize their dreams and build machines and come up with new themes and do all that stuff so let's let's talk about why that makes sense though because this isn't a new problem.

[18:05] This isn't a new pinball isn't unique in the sense that it was an industry that that made its money that they grew doing things a certain way.

[18:14] That's how video games were that's how typewriters were that's how the computer applications were but they all evolved because they had to why did they have to video games had to because video games are big and they were expensive and they were single themed machines and they were these things that people didn't want to put in their home.

[18:40] So video games turned into a video game console and they came out with the Atari and then that was kind of the beginning of it and now people everywhere can buy video games for cheap they can buy all kinds of content because someone came out with this this paradigm changing product and it didn't kill the arcades didn't kill individual standup video game or video game companies like Roth real still exist Roth real still makes good money selling big standup video game machines to to arcades and

[19:10] even to the rare consumer who wants to put a big machine in their home but video games did take some share a lot of share obviously from traditional video game developers and they also expanded the market obviously tremendously.

[19:27] But the goal when you get arcades into into home councils right the dream was always can I have the experience that I get in our cage right and for for a lot of it it was like can I get the same graphical experience and entertainment experience in my home right and we saw that right it happened I mean the first the first true one to one.

[19:51] Sort of the same thing that was in the arcade that was in your home was neo geo provided that that was the first time ever the graphic power was equal and since then right the graphic power in the home now is better than even what raw thrills is giving people out at Dave and buster is these days so do you think pinball Jerry like.

[20:09] Is wants to go through a similar evolution.

[20:14] So what are you suggesting that a that a platform type pinball machine could not deliver the same pinball experience as a single theme to traditional machine well well I guess the thing is like to your point right arcades when from being 300 pound single use games with the heavy CRT monitor into something that fit in the palm of your lap right and could be tucked under your TV and weighed less than five pounds right two pounds.

[20:42] But pinball still a 300 pound monstrosity that looks like it still belongs in an arcade and you know what I'm saying like pinball as as a way to play it can't really evolve very much and in terms of just like it's a physical thing that needs a certain amount of real estate in front of you like it's kind of arguably that makes perfect sense but arguably the video game experience is not just the console it's the console plus that big TV thing.

[21:11] Right back in the day that was a big CRT type TV so it was still a fairly big thing but it only took up that one spot in the home right.

[21:21] So in that sense a platform machine like the P3 and we can get into the details is still a big thing it's still a pinball machine but it's just one and it can deliver the same type of pinball experience as any single theme to machine in fact I'd argue that that's not the same thing.

[21:40] I'd argue that a game like Lexi light speed is is just the same if not more feature rich and more immersive or whatever than any other new game and obviously people have their favorites but right it is that but when people put it in their home all of the economics that makes sense for video game consoles for multi app computers for multi app you know mobile phones all these things that you buy once and you add applications to it all of that.

[22:09] Make sense not only for the consumer to buy and to buy it in the form of a single machine to to get there to satisfy their pinball needs but it also makes sense for the manufacturers if for example I don't know look out in the future five years from now there was stern pinball and maybe jerseye jack pinball and maybe a couple other one or two that that are shipping games and the thousands or whatever they stay alive.

[22:33] If all the other smaller companies or even some of the bigger companies had a platform that they could create content for they could reduce their overhead they could reduce their manufacturing they could reduce all the expenses they could literally just create that fun game content you know artwork and theme and and game layout or playfield layout and game rules they could deliver that they don't have to manufacture machines.

[22:58] And they can turn a profit at a much lower price.

[23:01] Right but is it still does it still give enough of what people want and pinball I mean that is not what question yeah.

[23:08] So yeah let's talk about that what do people want to pinball what makes pinball pinball to people.

[23:13] I mean we say it all the time you know on on the other show not this one.

[23:18] It's the world under glass you know people want to walk up and they want to see a universe in a world under glass that makes them want to flip the machine and and so I think first and foremost the theme and seeing that theme brought to life underneath the glasses is probably the thing that attracts us first and foremost to the pinball experience.

[23:42] Yep I agree with that right so as you think about the platform p3 do you think it's hard to create that world under glass because a lot of it Jerry too is just like when the machine's off and you just stand and over it.

[23:55] You know you're not going to get the same sort of colorful world that you'll get with the traditional pinball machine with the you know the artwork on the wood and you know all the toys and mechs there like all colorful in your face without even turning on.

[24:10] Yeah so I mean I think there are various segments of the market and everyone has different tastes going back to the video game comparison when you take that Donkey Kong cabinet that has pretty Donkey Kong artwork on the side and the nice what's what's the word for their translate thing on the top marquee on the top.

[24:29] And then you turn that into a video game cartridge that you stick into your Nintendo or whatever it's it's kind of the same deal when it's off and when it's not loaded it's it's not that artistic experience or that presentation but there are people who value gameplay more than artistic presentation and there are people who who value that you know that nice looking piece of furniture in their house that they want to be themed like whatever their favorite movie all the time.

[24:55] So there's certainly not only one type of consumer who always wants their machine to be on the people who see the value of paying $2,500 for each new game instead of a $10,000 for each new game.

[25:08] Probably don't care that it doesn't look pretty when it's off right right.

[25:14] You know what and it still looks pretty when it's off because it's got full cabinet artwork it's just that when you stand over the playfield and look down on it it doesn't it doesn't show any content on the playfield itself.

[25:23] Right. So how so the platform right how is it do you feel like now is the time I mean 2019 is it when when will you I don't know how how how does it compare to where we are with sales with these current companies you know I mean it's that isn't that what I guess the question I have a huge areas what matters most right innovation or like being profitable.

[25:51] So there's there's a lot of things to cover there but if I didn't see a path to profitability then obviously I'd be throwing my money away and I wouldn't keep doing it.

[26:06] And it's obvious it's clear everyone knows that our sales aren't growing as fast as they need to be to be profitable in the short term.

[26:14] The thing is it's another aspect of the of the platform model.

[26:21] The way to judge the success of an early stage paradigm shifting product is different than against a you know a single themed machine from another company.

[26:34] If if Stern comes out with a game Stern's maybe a bad example because they're doing really well they could probably survive a bad release.

[26:41] But if any other of the small companies came out with a machine that nobody liked they'd be dead right.

[26:47] No no I mean we see it all the time. Who do you need to sell still around.

[26:53] October fest is not going to sell.

[26:55] Okay. Okay. So you're talking about a company that had you know a large financial back.

[27:01] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If someone came out. Yes. See your point. If it was like.

[27:04] They gave them. They gave them runway. Yeah. I mean highway pinball is a good example right. I mean it really would bankrupted highway pinball was most likely other than a million other things that they did wrong.

[27:14] Was full throttle right. Full throttle was a sales disaster. And that was their first title. And they needed full throttle probably to sell more than the amount it did to earn the money to build the alien machines.

[27:27] Right. So that's a good example of if your first title and you is a flop and you've got a lot invested.

[27:34] It's hard to move on a title to. Yeah. If you don't have a big budget or a big financial backing that's tough.

[27:41] But that's true for a single theme the game for sure. And it's partially true for a platform as well.

[27:47] But but what does it take. Let's look out in the future and then come back to the current and see what the numbers mean.

[27:54] But what would it take for a company like.

[27:57] Multi morphic with a platform machine. What would it take to get over the hurdle. How many machines do we have to sell before the platform model the ecosystem the multi game kind of purchasing kicks in.

[28:10] Right. I don't know. Do you mean is that something you guys have projected or.

[28:18] Is it so it doesn't feel like it should be like an opinion based answer should there should be like some sort of financial threshold answer.

[28:28] Well, so it's difficult to answer only because at some point there are enough p3s out there where it makes sense for third party developers to commit to the platform.

[28:37] Sure. Right. If there were say if there were say 200 machines out there. What it makes sense for a another company another pinball company or another content company a game company to create a game and sell up to 200 of them probably not right they're not going to make enough money to overcome their their costs.

[28:57] Right. But you can you can estimate the cost to make a to make a game a game for a platform where you don't have to absorb the manufacturing prices and and the cabinet structure in the back box and all the pieces that are already part of the platform.

[29:13] So you can estimate those prices and we've done that relative to a traditional type of game if we're not building more flippers and more power supplies and more circuit boards and the cabinet the legs and the balls and all that stuff if we take out all the all the common components.

[29:30] Then we can build a game for a price that gets profit at a sales price of $2,500 which is what we're selling Lexi for which is what we're selling cosmic heart racing for.

[29:43] So let's throw some numbers out there we say we make $500 per game or say we make $1,000 per game or say we make $1,500 per game.

[29:52] That translates into how many games we have to sell to overcome the R&D costs.

[29:59] Right. Traditionally Stern says it costs a million dollars to make a game.

[30:03] That's a lot of money and there's no way it needs to take that much in today's world but because you have artists who can kick out you know an art package in a week or two or a month and you've got sound guys who can can piece together things and you have the game.

[30:20] Play field designer who can work for what what's what's what's a typical game development cycle a year nine months.

[30:30] Around there some games longer but yeah around their year so 50 75 maybe $100,000 max for for a play field designer you have a mechanical engineer who works for six or nine months.

[30:42] Etc. You add up these numbers and you should probably be around between I don't know $300,000 to maybe $600,000 and you can do the math and figure out how many you need to sell to get there.

[30:52] And then going back to the platform if there are.

[30:57] I'll throw at a number a thousand machines out there you can estimate how many of those machines will result in the purchases for each new game.

[31:06] Whether it's 10% or 25% or 50% I imagine in the short term it's a higher percentage because every new consumer wants most of the few games that we have in the library now and five years from now when the library is a lot bigger they'll be more selective.

[31:20] But you can estimate those numbers and you can kind of figure out what your profit would be if you sold that many of each game.

[31:27] Long story short once we get to that threshold and a thousand seems like a good number to me when we have a thousand machines out there if each new game sells to half of those people or a quarter or a third of those people then we're right about the break even point on the development costs for a game.

[31:47] All right so how do we get well that's the question right how do we get to a thousand so we've started the company seven years ago and we spent our most of our life building on a platform right we spend our R&D money building out this thing that is a P3 and people like to say well you worked on lexelite speed for seven years or you worked on the game for seven years but what we did is we paid our dues and we built the platform.

[32:16] And yeah lexie didn't sell a thousand units but lexie plus cosmic heart racing plus our next game plus our next game if we get to a thousand units before we run out of money.

[32:27] We cross that threshold and then we're made so we just have to get to that point and back to the question how do we get to that point in my opinion we get to that point with with help and that help is.

[32:41] New games we develop games we create a situation where people want more P3 games and hopefully we find the money or make the money selling p-rocks to other manufacturers or we make enough money selling our current games to people where we can afford a budget to build a bigger higher budget game maybe get it you know expensive theme or whatever.

[33:02] By the way we're working on number game number four I call it game number four because it's actually our fourth play field now and it addresses a lot of the things people complain about it is it is an exciting theme and an immersive package that has the whole world under glass thing it has a whole team of developers working on it so we're hopeful of course that our next game gets us closer.

[33:23] Is it a lie so we're missing it's an exciting theme I'm not saying if it's a license or not.

[33:29] It's not a license no I'm saying it.

[33:34] Okay so the pathway to a thousand is help and when you when you define that you mean we just need to make it more attractive right and so that comes in the form of a new game helping us out right a new experience and you.

[33:57] So I mean does it does it because in the current form Jerry you guys have to be projecting we're not on track to sell a thousand of these at ten thousand a pop so the the game needs to be the driver.

[34:10] With what metrics like with our current game library just just right now in the current game library there's no are you guys are probably not on track to sell a thousand units right.

[34:22] No we absolutely want so without with that without increasing the game right yeah right so and you're looking at the industry right I mean we're talking about this in a little bit of a vacuum but you're looking at.

[34:33] What other manufacturers are putting out there and you know when when you hit a home run with the theme and the experiences is golden you're watching these companies sell you know blow by a thousand units sold right so it's all riding on an experience.

[34:51] To carry the platform right.

[34:56] Okay so yes no pressure no pressure that's a big part of it right.

[35:01] If if if it's another interesting thing that a platform play if we come out with that you know that killer app that big thing that sells.

[35:09] It could sell 500 it could sell 2000 I don't know but that reenables.

[35:16] The interest in older games right so if we come out with.

[35:21] I don't know pick a pick up popular recent movie Avengers in game if Avengers in game pinball machine if we develop it and we sell 5000 machines.

[35:29] With that game then some percentage of those 5000 people are also going to take advantage of the platform and buy Lexi's or cosmic heart racing or other things so the fact that we haven't sold a thousand machines with our current games doesn't in.

[35:42] That we won't make value that we won't create create profit out of our first games it's it's a different paradigm it works it's out it's a long planes did of a short play we don't judge ourselves based off the performance of a single game.

[35:57] Although it's either good or bad right and we want it to be good but a a bad game for the p3 doesn't mean imminent death.

[36:07] No it means it means we have a chance to to struggle or we will struggle in the short term while we work towards creating new games and new content partnerships and potentially getting investors or whatever to help us get to that thousand once we get to that thousand it's gravy I mean it's a snowball effect this is a this is a paradigm that once you get over the hump it's snowballs it increases in momentum.

[36:32] So ever so but it does but it does all boil down to you have to make a pinball game that a thousand people are willing to shell out ten thousand dollars I get that there's a platform.

[36:44] But you know how these buyers are Jerry they they they want to disagree but they but but but how does it not come we don't have to sell we don't have to sell a thousand of any game if we sell 200 of this game 500 of the next one right 300 the next one we're a thousand but.

[37:01] But but right in its current form with the current library it's not selling hundreds and hundreds of units is it.

[37:11] So it's it's been I've read that we sold eight I think and then I read that we sold twelve and you say we sold 50 I think we sold a lot more than you guys are saying but we're not we're not in the 500 range yet.

[37:26] Okay so you're you're it's a slow burn towards a thousand right now in a hot title could be the accelerant you need though I mean we agree on that yeah for sure okay so when when do we expect this next title.

[37:45] When it's ready we're we're not going to show it we're not going to talk about it not only until it's done but until it's on the floor right now so we want to we want to go to a show and show people show it to people and you say this all the time and it makes perfect sense you are the genius marketer.

[38:04] That you go and show a game and get people excited about it don't ship it for six months then you lost your momentum you've lost interest in there they're off to the new exciting thing so.

[38:15] If we can afford to not.

[38:19] Try to manufacture interest and excitement on a future game and obviously it makes sense not to.

[38:26] Right so what's your biggest fear right now.

[38:31] My biggest fear.

[38:36] I guess my biggest fear is that the people who look at the P three today and dismiss it because it either looks different or feels different or because they judged it four years ago and.

[38:50] I didn't realize or didn't care that it's a multi platform or a multi game kind of platform my biggest fear is that first impression that we can never overcome that.

[39:01] And I don't know how to change people's first impression and when we started I mean we're we didn't start with sixteen million dollars or whatever deeper started with we didn't start with big investors that you know American pinball started with we started literally with two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and friends and family money.

[39:19] So we didn't really have a choice we had to try to piece me a thing together take it to shows get people to see it start building a you know a name recognition and that kind of thing we've been lucky that we've also developed this p-rock control system that that most of the new manufacturers have adopted so we've been able to supplement our slow p three growth with very exciting very fast.

[39:45] Control system sales and that's been able to maintain our ability to to keep doing the R&D on the side.

[39:53] But my biggest fear is that even if we come out let's say we announced.

[40:00] Avengers in game or the matrix or I don't know name the super popular theme that would sell out you want karate kid or something.

[40:07] Akira.

[40:09] No those are all great.

[40:11] What if what if we announced one of those are people going to say holy crap that's awesome the p three's great for showing that I'm buying one or they're going to be like.

[40:21] Oh that's that piece of junk that I saw five years ago and it had these weird flippers and I wish someone else would make it.

[40:27] No I mean you're going to have to.

[40:29] Change perception right if Stern says on make we're making the matrix or karate kid they sell out site unseen of the LEDs overnight right 500 out the door before anyone's even seen it.

[40:40] Because people already know what to expect right and I think to your point if people's expectations aren't super high or they're still confused by how the platform will will bring that theme to life.

[40:51] You're going to have to win them over right but that's not to say it's impossible it's just going to be harder because that's just how people are when it comes to forming an opinion about a product right.

[41:03] So what did you get upset when you see like deep route getting all this like accolades and they've shown nothing and then people are like the new innovation in town is a company that hasn't shown anything.

[41:12] Yes but but the reason I mean I understand why it happens because they have a lot of money and they've they've made a lot of exciting hires and they've basically created momentum based on secrecy because they can say great things we're going to do amazing things and just wait for it just wait for it is coming we have so much money and we're throwing it all into 40 plus animators and we're we're doing all this stuff and it's going to be awesome.

[41:39] So so people expected to be awesome but what's frustrating for me is that all of the things not all of them but probably 90% of the things Robert said about you know innovations and things they're trying to do and and the things even you talk about that you ask them that you hope that they'll be doing like I don't know the storytelling and and

[41:59] I lost my train of thought and network play and network play and all those features that tutorials and stuff like that you think would be super cool in a in a financially backed pinball game development and in a product we've done all that stuff we just we just we've done it in a way that hasn't caught on yet people people look to them with enthusiasm and they see all that stuff on ours but because we we haven't put out the

[42:27] killer app yet they don't relate to it right it all comes out of the game then again right it's all the game but it doesn't come it doesn't come down to the game with them yet right because everyone's just super excited and jazz about the possibility of getting a game that you know what it might be it might be terrible right I mean they've got a lot to prove considering the verbal sort of hyperbole they put out in the game and I'm not sure if they're going to be able to do that.

[42:57] To the hobby. Yes, we have a lot they said they're going to make the most games ever in 2019 that's not happening. Well, the only way that even makes sense for me is if they're also doing a platform it's it makes zero business sense to come out with you know 12 single themed pinball machines they basically be monopolizing they'd be they'd be eating their own profits they'd be but Jerry when you see you see these million errors in their game room.

[43:27] And they've got 15 games 20 games lined up do you look at those people and say like that's just the old way of doing it.

[43:37] No, no, I mean there are people that have game rooms full of traditional stand up video games to I mean people can do whatever they want with their money but

[43:46] but in order for the industry to grow for the industry to even sustain all these manufacturers they can't all be making single themed machines no no collector is going to go by every single game from every manufacturer you're making money with with p rock right and you you've almost made the engine that allows

[44:05] there to be pinball variety and a lot of people are using p rock and you've you've actually been the reason in the catalyst why there's a lot more pinball games.

[44:16] Is that not enough right I mean couldn't you just sit back and just feel good knowing that you create it like the unreal engine of pinball and everyone's using it to bring more product out and you're kind of behind a lot of the expansion.

[44:30] Why the need to why the need for the platform.

[44:34] So there's there's all the reasons we talked about earlier about why I think the current you know market isn't sustainable in the way the path to sustenance the path to maintaining.

[44:49] The pinball market is to shift the paradigm but beyond that there's personal interest right and there's things that I like to do how I want to spend my time.

[44:58] And I decided a geez it was eight or 10 years ago when I was doing the same thing for companies day after day that I wanted to create stuff I wanted to to design new things for industries that I think need them.

[45:14] And I made the p rock board actually has a little side project at home in nights and weekends and the idea originally of the p rock board was to be a controller for this concept I had for a machine which was the p3.

[45:27] And I needed a modern control control system for it but throughout the process of designing it I made it backwards compatible with other machines and then I started building other boards and I started marketing those other boards and started building up that that community of home for developers and I was going to do that.

[45:44] I mean seven years later now the p rock was two thousand nine so it's almost ten years later the home brewed channels on the custom pinball development channels on like our slack channel and on pinside and stuff we have to 250 people that are building custom pinball machines for themselves with their families which is super cool.

[46:03] But that doesn't drive me anymore I designed that board it took me about two weeks to design the board it took me another few weeks to design or to write the you know the software control system the software framework that that has since grown and evolved into things that people can use to to build machines that that's cool that's fun.

[46:22] It makes money now it didn't make enough money at the time to turn it into a business but it makes money now.

[46:29] But supporting that doesn't interest me I mean it doesn't drive me what drives me is creating stuff is creating new ideas is implementing new technologies and putting that into products that I think needed and that's what the p three is for me.

[46:42] What the p three can do just the features on the ball tracking on the wall and scoop module the the being able to physically change the entire game in about thirty seconds with a completely new shot layout is awesome people who own the p three.

[46:59] Love it they love the ability to switch up the games yes of course they all want more content or they all want a popular theme or whatever but they love it and that to me is so much more rewarding than people buying a control system board that I developed because I've created this thing I've created this thing that people like that other people can create content for and deliver this thing in this in the whole package that by the way we didn't with two hundred fifty thousand dollars what it would take another company name the price four million five million dollars.

[47:29] We did it just because we wanted to do it right and I actually wonder when you talk about companies like deep root or another company that has huge money huge money kind of makes you lazy right you go to your job you get paid you do the thing and yes there are passionate people who work there I'm not trying to say there aren't and in their passionate about creating a cool product but doing it without that budget it makes you only go to work because you have a belief in the product and because you want to get it.

[47:59] Right yeah I mean I don't know if it's you know lazy I don't know if it's lazy as much as it can easily make you inefficient because you feel like there's no consequences for making sure every dollars being spent effectively because you know there's a lot more money to go burn if we swirl like you could swirl for months and then keep swirling it and I see that with big companies every day.

[48:23] So okay so I mean Jerry it seems like you're at a crossroad right now platforms designed there is a portfolio of games thousand games out in homes seems to be like you know a goal to get to a threat in which it becomes a lot easier to attract developers because you can show them that there's a thousand willing recipients right of their innovation if they if they can develop something.

[48:53] So what do you think about it?

[48:55] Well yes at that point is when it makes sense for other developers to do it but it also makes sense for us to do it right we don't necessarily once we get to a thousand.

[49:03] Then it makes more sense for us to or then we have the budget to create our own new games for the platform and see the path the profitability through those so yes we think we've developed something kind of like an Nintendo where other companies EA sports and whatnot can create content for it but if they don't that doesn't make the platform a failure either because we'll be profitable making games for the game.

[49:22] So what what's you guys in a race against time or you have a lot of time to figure this out.

[49:32] The time that the race is against the passion the team brings to the table right because we're all still working for either no pay or very little pay because we believe in the long term potential the platform.

[49:47] So that only sustains itself for so long before you either have you know life changes where you need to go make enough money to support something or somebody or you lose the passion for it.

[49:58] And right now everyone still has the passion for it and in fact every time we go to a show and I've told this story a lot when we used to go to shows we build our whole development team from taking the P3 to shows because we we meet a developer or two or five where like holy crap this thing is awesome I see the potential of it I want to help develop something.

[50:16] Or not even that they're like I want to use it and develop my own thing and we'll talk to him and be like hey well what if you develop the game for it and we we sold it or whatever so we've built the team just based interest in the platform interest in the features interest in the possibility of this turning into all those things that I told you it should turn into.

[50:35] And the race is against that interest right people lose the passion for it then I don't know if I went and if I went and got married and had children or whatever I would have to bring in a paycheck every day right now it makes sense I have that I don't have that today.

[50:53] It's your show during your question you got to keep going with the questions it yeah no just show I'm on your show.

[51:02] So so okay so given that my fear that we talked about is getting people to basically get over or my fear is that they won't go over their first impressions how do we do that how do you the marketing master.

[51:19] Yeah you get people over over that first impression you need to kill their game though it's like it's almost like this it's like you could have a girl that's like that.

[51:31] That's kind of average but she's really there's beauty underneath God I'm going to get in trouble for this analogy all I'm saying is is it's like imagine someone who you might not have had the best first impression but all of a sudden they go to the gym for six months they start taking care of themselves you see him six months later and boom you can change your perception immediately and that's why look and when I'm saying is you need a sexy title I mean it's it's all it's it all comes down to that and you need a title that really.

[52:00] Show cases what the platform can do all that tech that's in there you know how do you how do you wrap it up in in one title that will then like open the door for everything you've been describing I mean that's that's that is the only advice I can give with any pinball game is you got to make an experience that people want.

[52:20] So you were advice to me a couple weeks ago was what the heck are you doing why don't you just go back and make a game Jerry I still think I still think you can make a traditional pinball machine and make millions of dollars.

[52:34] But you don't want that see it's that's right if you if you said Chris I want to make a million dollars I the last thing I would do is the last thing I would advise you to do is go create a whole new pinball platform.

[52:45] But if you say the second the last thing you would say is is the second the last thing you would suggest is go build up in long company right absolutely but if I were to advise anybody to be successful in pinball I would just say make a make a better game than stern but ship it within two months of reveal and you'll be fine.

[53:04] And if you if you think like how many companies have actually achieved that none.

[53:12] Yeah because there's a lot more to it than potentially a sideline looker.

[53:17] That's why but I think it's the day for me for me for me.

[53:21] I have no interest in it what drives me isn't the potential to make a lot of money of course I hope to make a lot of money along the way doing the thing but the thing I want to do is the thing that you know that drives me that it's that product is that technology it's doing that thing that makes me excited when I wake up every day.

[53:40] To go work because I like to develop stuff it's like right right now in college you're gone.

[53:50] I was just going to say a lot of people like to go out and drink or you know do this and that there's a segment of the there's a segment of society who likes to you know write code or design things or to create a to create a robot in their basement or you know to do something and that's what drives me that's what I like that's what I want to do.

[54:08] Yeah so look I mean the platform is where it's at and the next thing that has to happen is a is a hit experience on it I think you agree with that.

[54:18] I guess the question I have to for Jerry is like being being in on this dream for so long do you ever feel like there could be a point where you would just adapt and try because it's not really is it is it pinball that you really want to be successful in or is it.

[54:37] Does it always have to be what it is today like this P3 platform multi morphing because would there ever be a point where you just be like it just didn't work but I'll try another way to expand pinball.

[54:52] No either either the P3 is success either we figure out to whether it's a game or whether it's a tweak of something on the platform itself that that we you know bring to market or that's it or or or I'm going to go apply my design my design goals and my my creativity and you know my interest I'm going to apply them to a different to a whole different industry.

[55:21] I left an industry I was making really good money doing doing working for networking data networking companies designing equipment designing you know very complex data switches and intrusion prevention systems and new encryption technologies and those kind of things that was interesting work but the you know the big company mentality and going to work every day and sitting in meetings and and you know going through all the red tape.

[55:50] Make sure that the red tape makes it a drag so me personally I feel like what drives me is creating new technologies designing new things writing new code or designing new FPJ logic or doing whatever for an industry that I think it should have an impact and if it doesn't work out in pinball it I'll do something else totally fair.

[56:15] I have no desire at all to build a traditional machine. I don't have to respect that.

[56:22] So I mean that's that's it we're we're at almost an hour now Chris so do you have any questions for me?

[56:30] I think we've we've talked a lot about the questions we had I guess you know I mean we've we've had this conversation you know a few times now right and I think it's all going to come down to that hit and as you look at the landscape now do you do you get worried Jerry that there's just so many players in the game now because you know to reach that thousand threshold every new company makes it harder.

[56:59] For you to find those customers right do you have to sort of the way I mean they come on the more the more the more product in the same category must make it you must make it more difficult if it was just stern and Jersey Jack and you lot easier to find a thousand new homes versus American pinball Chicago gaming company you know deep deep route what I even when I say deep rhythm like I don't even know what I'm saying is available.

[57:28] We know there's a lot out there.

[57:31] So but there's two aspects to it right because most of the new companies that start up use our control system so their success helps us continue developing our dream but ultimately back to the beginning of the conversation the more companies that are out there making machines the quicker the industry is going to collapse.

[57:51] And it's not doom and gloom it's not going to collapse next year is it's going to be this slowly slowly one company is going to fall out and then and then another year later or maybe another one does but ultimately the more companies that are doing it are going to make it happen faster and I believe that when that starts happening the platform

[58:12] is actually in the same way as the market machine finally finally gets looked at in different eyes or through different eyes from people who are like well where do I spend my money in a way that I get a lot more value for it.

[58:25] So the piece right now it's it's it's all it's all it's all guesswork right we don't know we don't know what the industry is really going to do we don't know if if it's going to start collapsing we think it will.

[58:40] But we know for sure today even with the games that we have now that the P3B offers more value per game in the sense of the each game cost 2500 or 1500 or many games cost 300 or 200 or whatever so people who want to build a game library people who want to you know own own the complex deep rules a game like a Lexi lights Peter cosmic heart racing but also have things on their favorite pinball machine that their kid can enjoy to like barnyard or rocks or can only go.

[59:09] Those kind of things we have that today so.

[59:14] Do you ever look at these pinball buyers Jerry and and ask yourself like man do these people even want value with what they spend their money on.

[59:25] I mean people are buying nine thousand dollar games that clearly you know the same game is being sold from half the price but why they do.

[59:33] Yeah but you look at you look at I don't know I see Facebook post from a lot of distributors or whatever and they say in Johnny just bought his second pinball machine now he's got two and you see a picture of his room and it's two pinball machines and couches and TVs and stuff and that's it there's no more room.

[59:48] So yeah every day new people are buying pinball machines who aren't going to go build a room or a warehouse and fill them up with machines so the P3 makes more sense for these people.

[01:00:00] Right so it all goes back to the same thing once we get that content out there people start looking at it through new eyes they start seeing the value it's just a thing that makes more sense it's just not over the hurdle yet.

[01:00:13] Right and you know it's funny for me because I was listening when you were reading that what was his name.

[01:00:20] Ben crane I think the email from Ben crane who is basically saying the P3 is not fun and ball trackings not fun and choosing a game is not fun.

[01:00:31] And that makes no sense for me he's judging the platform because it's a platform because it's not a single themed game.

[01:00:38] If you if you stop looking at the P3 through the eyes of someone who looked at it four years ago when it was you know a prototype machine and it was just coming up and we were working through stuff if you look at it again today all the points he made are outdated and don't make sense anymore he said he said the flippers.

[01:00:56] Don't work or they break and then it costs 750 dollars to buy a new flipper assembly the flippers the flippers are the most reliable flippers in the industry by far the testing we do on them is is multiples longer than traditional flippers.

[01:01:13] And by the way you don't have to buy a 750 dollar flipper assembly replacement just pull the assembly out swap the coil or the rubber or the bad just like you do an additional flip flipper.

[01:01:23] And you're good to go so again it's people looking at it and judging it based on what it was in the past and we've got to get people over the right.

[01:01:32] It's all going to come down to that halo title I mean if you look at the way ironically Microsoft sold Xboxes it's because they had a game called halo and that move the platform and we said this before and so what do you tell your team working on that title.

[01:01:51] Get this right.

[01:01:53] What are you saying they motivated is this it like I mean.

[01:01:58] Yeah, obviously we're looking at this title like we have a team we have it.

[01:02:07] It's not someone who's designed pin bug games before now but it is an industry or a guy who's been collecting for years and is a creative designer for other industries.

[01:02:17] But we're all I hesitate to say this out loud but but I'm going to creating a shootable pinball layout isn't really that hard right it just require some diligence and play testing and making whitewoods and seeing if the shot flow works.

[01:02:38] What's hard about the pinball development is creating the entire package and orchestrating light shows and sound and music and and all that stuff together and tying that into a theme with the cohesive story and doing all that stuff.

[01:02:52] So we have a group of pinball people of pinball players we have tournament players and we also have beginner players and all these people are on a team together.

[01:03:01] It's not super hard to come out with a shot layout that works it's not super hard to conceive of mechanical toys that will be super interesting and interactive and fun ways you just have to have a mechanical engineer who can design them.

[01:03:14] We have that we're working with a dedicated audio team we're working with people who do video production for a living.

[01:03:22] We're working with a creative designer who does creative design for products and marketing.

[01:03:28] So we have a team of people of experts a team of people of experts we have a team of experts.

[01:03:36] And we're working towards that full package we've had people complain about our artwork in the past or or there's not super immersive play field layout with you know toys and things.

[01:03:49] Jersey Jackson the master at it right they developed these play fields that you look at and you feel like you're inside of the environment that the theme is.

[01:03:57] We're getting better at that that's what we're doing on this game we're implementing technology or mechanical assemblies that go down lower on our physical play field one of the the biggest things people used to say about the p3 one of the biggest knocks was.

[01:04:14] Well you have this huge LCD and there's nothing on top of it therefore you can only do very open games and we've long said that's not true we can float assemblies over the center of the play field just like we float the flippers over the play field.

[01:04:27] This game that we're developing will have the most versatile physical mechanical device ever developed in a pinball game and it's integrated into the same.

[01:04:38] That sounds like a deep route.

[01:04:41] It doesn't repeat.

[01:04:44] He'll say it next week.

[01:04:47] It is the most versatile physical pinball mechanism ever developed.

[01:04:55] Write it down mark my words you'll say the same thing when you see it.

[01:04:59] Okay so but but but that's part of a package right that make a physical mechanism doesn't make a game fun.

[01:05:08] What makes a game fun and interesting is that immersion is the gameplay is is a attainable set of rules.

[01:05:13] It's a complete package and we have a team together that's that's learned from the past and we believe it's putting that package together.

[01:05:20] We're super excited about the game we can't wait to show people.

[01:05:23] The other thing that I always ask is market research to land on the theme.

[01:05:30] What did you guys do?

[01:05:35] We spent six months researching themes and we did have a focus group.

[01:05:40] We had a team of people.

[01:05:42] How come I wasn't invited?

[01:05:44] You know I was focused on the theme freaking wizard.

[01:05:47] Well if I enjoyed any of the themes that you've recommended you might have been on my list.

[01:05:55] The karate kid I like actually but the other ones you said I can't remember it was a there was a podcast you had a lake three or four weeks ago with.

[01:06:05] Will you bond out that October fest was taken?

[01:06:08] You know what I was I'm kind of excited about a.

[01:06:13] Crap Sherlock Holmes yeah that just sounds really exciting to me.

[01:06:16] Yeah I mean what about Valkyrie now okay so you guys are excited I don't even I don't even know Valkyrie yeah this is a this is a super fun theme people will absolutely relate to it.

[01:06:27] They'll enjoy the music they'll connect with the music they'll enjoy the theme they'll connect with it and the gameplay for it ties in perfectly to the theme this is a fully immersive game.

[01:06:38] And we're super excited about it.

[01:06:41] It sounds like this one has to be a hit for you guys you consider that as well or no you you say that you like to say that you do all this if the B3 doesn't come out with a you know a killer

[01:06:54] game now or next then they're done but it's what you say I am saying if if this flops though right or not I'm if this isn't if this isn't meet your expectations.

[01:07:04] Do you I guess I guess the challenge for you guys right is how do you keep up the enthusiasm of all the all the hard work that people are putting into this new one if it doesn't take off.

[01:07:16] Is it going to be hard to get the morale back.

[01:07:20] Maybe yes because we spend a long time developing this game but what what number do we have to meet for that enthusiasm to drop off I don't know what that is if this game sells you know 400 games is that a flop or that success.

[01:07:35] I mean look at if you based upon your metrics right if it gets you closer to a thousand or near a thousand then.

[01:07:44] You then you then you've you reach your goal I mean ultimately though you have to make a profit right and that you know I I don't know the numbers right I mean it's it's a long play for sure if you wanted to make short term profit you would have just made a traditional machine.

[01:07:58] Yeah yeah okay I don't I don't think people get that the people that right into you know podcast or that post on the inside the the people who post the negative comments they are always comparing one theme on the p3 to a traditional game they're comparing a twenty five dollar game to a you know in eight thousand dollar game and and that's that's fine on one hand because I'm certainly happy to compare Lexi light speed or cosmic or cart racing to pick your game.

[01:08:27] I think the feature set is comparable in the gameplay is just as fun if not more fun but we're talking about apples and oranges because.

[01:08:39] We come out with another game it's going to cost twenty five hundred dollars we're going to bring this new game to market this game that I'm telling you super exciting has a super immersive theme has all these cool things and I don't know if it's twenty five hundred or twenty seven hundred or whatever but it's going to be a fraction of the price of a new game for many.

[01:08:56] Yes of course people will have to buy the platform if they don't have it but they only buy that once and then they can build the game library.

[01:09:03] Right I guess the final question I have so so let's say hypothetically I buy a p3 and it's what how much is it ten K right now it's ten K comes with a twenty five hundred dollar game.

[01:09:16] Okay so let's say like I bought and each each title is twenty five hundred right.

[01:09:21] Let's say you buy like three games on top of the platform and so you're looking at ten you're in seventeen thousand five hundred right on all in.

[01:09:33] And you go to sell it unlike a video game right in which games lose value quickly and you can sell just the game not the platform right people

[01:09:44] don't sell their Xbox with their halo cartridge.

[01:09:48] You're kind of seeing this as like this is going to be your machine for a life right I mean it's it's it's also going to be difficult to have a resale if you invest heavily in the platform.

[01:09:59] To date today I agree with you yeah I mean as soon as we have we reach that whatever that number is a thousand or more then people will probably start selling individual games to one another

[01:10:10] because they played it for a year and now want to give it to someone else and you know spend their money on something else but but yes in the short term you're absolutely right.

[01:10:17] Okay.

[01:10:18] Jerry it's I mean I've enjoyed being on your show for an hour.

[01:10:22] Yeah thanks thanks thanks for joining us it's been looking forward to it for a while to have somebody of your you know your prestige and your knowledge on the show.

[01:10:31] I know it's great for us.

[01:10:33] It's rare no episode number two no other pinball podcast will invite me on some I'm I'm like it light it.

[01:10:39] He laid it.

[01:10:40] Well they're they're just following your own advice right now I know I know it's not should be well Jerry thank you thank you for having me.

[01:10:48] Yeah but no and all seriously Chris I appreciate you you inviting me to have the talk and it's always fun for me to talk about the platform I get that people don't really relate to it yet the economics are different and it's there's a huge education process to teach people that this new different thing.

[01:11:07] Is not bad just because it's different and we have super fun games we have the potential for a lot more super fun games were blowing the price of other games out of the water.

[01:11:20] And it's just a different animal so yeah we have a marketing problem for sure that we need to overcome and that's why I like talking to you we're listening to you talk about marketing things on your podcast but yeah.

[01:11:30] I appreciate it one last question because I know the listeners are like you didn't ask this ballpark of when we might see this versatile new mech playfield experience.

[01:11:43] Yeah we really don't have a the reason I don't have the date is because a lot of our people are nights and weekends because we don't have that big budget so it might be before the end of the year it might be at tpf next year it it it will be ready when it's shown.

[01:11:58] Okay all right so when it's that when it's shown it's you can pop it in.

[01:12:03] When you when you see the machine when we show it to you the game you will be able to buy p3s with this game or add this game to your existing p3.

[01:12:12] Okay we'll we'll ship on that one.

[01:12:14] It's the only way to do it I don't know what there be no there'd be no rationale or reason to do it any other way you would just end up.

[01:12:21] I don't know I heard you just pre-order the game again.

[01:12:25] But I saw it I played it and I also saw it but you're not going to have it for what six months again.

[01:12:32] Yeah it's a refundable deposit you know the thing with these refundable deposits they really mean nothing I mean it's at any point.

[01:12:38] Right they're not deposits who cares exactly like you can just get it back.

[01:12:43] I know you get on Charlie you get on Charlie for his non-refundable deposit but at some point when you get a commit from somebody you turn that into whatever buying parts for the machines that that person is.

[01:12:55] That you have to build for that person so I never really understood the refundable deposit thing whatever industries do the refundable deposits.

[01:13:02] I mean you can put a deposit down on a car and not and not take the car when it comes in I think so.

[01:13:11] But you lose the money you might yeah you know I never understood the refundable deposits I never I don't understand a lot of what goes on and pimp all to be honest in terms of the decisions with with these companies because yeah as you know like refundable deposit is a false order like it's it might never materialize.

[01:13:30] Charlie was smart from a business sense of doing the non-refundable it just so happened to be unfortunate that people waited a year but now people are getting their games.

[01:13:40] Yeah I think people are going to be.

[01:13:42] I know but but but at the same time people knew what they were getting into and made the choice so.

[01:13:46] Yeah well look I hope I get invited back on your show episode number three sometime in the future Jerry so thanks for having me as a guest.

[01:13:55] You are the only one I would ever consider bringing on our show so thanks Chris.

[01:13:59] Alright have a good day so there it was p3 Jerry talking about what the future holds hope you enjoyed it look it it's all going to come down to whether or not that new title they have coming out finally.

[01:14:12] Shows people the potential of the platform I think he agrees I think you agree and only time will tell when it will happen now when you look at the timing of it though you know kind of seems like we might not even see it this year.

[01:14:25] I don't know about you but I sort of shudder and shake when I think about how many pimp all titles are going to be trying to get into your home and into your wallet by the end of 2019.

[01:14:39] I'm getting fatigued there's just so much and yet not enough do you feel that way.

[01:14:45] I'm going to do a whole podcast about that I feel like there's a lot more than we ever could have bargained for in pinball but I feel like we're not satisfied with any of it.

[01:14:55] And I think it shows and I think people are starting to realize that they just want like a few magical titles and the rest of it.

[01:15:02] Just should go away anyway that was episode 355 of canators pinball podcast will be back this week with more exciting pinball shows have a great day everyone.

[01:15:32] you
