[00:00] And bomb was certainly just dropped today just in an hour or so ago.

[00:29] And the details and final sort of confirmation on what everyone is known to be probably the next

[00:36] Stern title, Batman 66. The details have just come out. And I think this is a really exciting special edition on

[00:45] Canadian Pimball podcast. Whenever a new Pimball machine is officially sort of announced, it's exciting. It's exciting because it shows us once again that the

[00:57] future of Pimball. And what makes Pimball collecting so exciting isn't what's behind us. It's what's in front of us.

[01:05] Batman 66. There was a flyer that came out. It says that this game is all about Stern celebrating its 30th anniversary with a special Batman 66 game.

[01:17] I just want to go down the list real quick of what it says is featured in this game. So it says all star development team consists of George Gomez and lineman sheets in collaboration with Joe

[01:29] Kemanako. I just probably just butcher that name and contributions from Eugene Jarvis and others has all new game design retaining the popular

[01:38] popular crane toy from 2008 Gomez and sheets Batman the dark night. New interactive toys. Here's the big one. Two LCD displays. One LCD replaced in the dot matrix in the back box.

[01:52] And an additional interactive LCD on the play field voice over by Adam West Batman and the original TV series iconic art package and much more.

[02:03] Don't know what else much more could be because this thing looks like it's packed with stuff. And then there's even more details that are really interesting. We're going over all this and the special edition jointly branded by Stern Pimball and Kapow Pimball.

[02:19] There's going to be 240 limited edition machines dressed even more so than a normal limited edition game. So I'm not sure what does that mean even more than an LE.

[02:31] There will be a premium. There will be no pro customers who ordered with deposit gain VIP access to Adam West meet and greet at Weston Hotel during expo.

[02:43] And the LE deposit is $2,000 the premium is 500. Here's the interesting thing. There will be 30 super LE machines that will be made available by invitation only and games are planned to ship in November of 2016.

[03:02] So that is everything we know so far about this highly anticipated title. Let's just go down this list and talk about this stuff. So first I want to say when I heard about this, the thing that I immediately knew would get people talking is this 30 limited super limited edition machines they're making.

[03:26] Because that is going to be the one that I think everyone is going to want. We have shown that no matter what machine it is, everyone wants the LE.

[03:37] Everybody wants the one that there's not that many editions made. I don't think Stern is ever ever made such a limited number of games when it comes to 30 of a particular version of a game.

[03:51] So I knew that the fans and the collectors were going to really sort of get excited and frustrated and be curious all at the same time about these super early.

[04:03] Here's why I think it's a genius idea by Stern. They are taking a page from Ferrari's handbook. So for those of you who don't know, you can go into a dealership and buy a Ferrari. You might have to wait but you can get one.

[04:16] Now when Ferrari makes special versions of its cars that usually are around to commemorate the company like the law Ferrari, like the F40, the F50, they don't let anyone just walk into a dealership and buy those cars.

[04:31] Even if you've got a ton of money, those cars are sold by invitation only. So I think this is a genius marketing idea by Stern to invite Stern's finest customers to be the ones to get these super LE machines.

[04:45] And here's why. And I know this is going to piss a lot of people off because I think it's a great move, especially in the climate right now that Stern is going through for them to do something a little bit extra nice and special for those who have stuck with Stern through the years and those customers who have invested heavily in Stern.

[05:03] It's a you scratched our back and you stayed with us. We're going to scratch your back and we're going to give you the option to get this game. I think that's awesome. I do.

[05:12] I think it also is going to create a lot of anger frustration jealousy and hate by people out there who can't get one who won't be invited to get one. And we all know this is going to happen.

[05:23] This the super LE is someone will you know they'll put them on the second hand market and they'll try and flip one new unboxing and who knows who knows how much is it worth.

[05:36] So you know if we look at the pricing of spider man V as sort of like an example if there's only premiums and premiums are around what like 6500 7000 dollars but now we got LCDs in these things what is it going to cost.

[05:53] I think a safe bet is to say 7000 dollars is ways probably the base maybe for the premium the LE I mean I have to assume it's going to be a little bit more than ghost busters with two LCDs in it.

[06:07] Even though it's a re-themed and there's not a ton of work when it comes to R&D you know what we're like could we see the first 9000 dollars Stern.

[06:18] That's going to be interesting as the price keeps going up and up.

[06:23] Another really interesting thing about this whole game is I love how they're like all new game design do we buy that do we buy it when they tell us it's an all new game design or is this going to look like the exact same layout of the dark night game that Gomez and Lyman worked on so you got the same names from the original game and they're saying it's an all new layout.

[06:46] So really curious to see if that's going to be an accurate statement or if there's just going to be a few things that change in terms of new interactive toys that's exciting if it's it would be hard to put.

[07:02] But are they just like remodeled toys from the dark night game that are going to be obviously remodeled because it's a different theme and a different Batman error but I think it's going to be a lot like we saw with spider man where they're going to go through the game and they're going to look at where the toys are in the max and they're going to redesign them obviously to fit the theme.

[07:22] So but will there be new new toys like new things interact with that weren't on the original game I think that's something that we're all curious to see how that comes to light so the LCDs right so we've been waiting for stern to put LCDs and games I think it was a big miss does everyone else that LCD did not make it's way to ghost busters especially with the popularity of ghost busters and and sort of it being probably the most popular storm p.

[07:51] ball machine to be released in the last decade for sure it's now going to be out right so this error of dot matrix is over it's over and it's it's exciting that it's an LCD screen and it's not just colored dots so we are moving stern into the 21st century and we're going to see it in November and you know it's it's just great it's great it's it's it's the jury's out on what's going to happen to all the dot matrix games that are out in the game.

[08:21] So I think it's going to be a big miss in the world will this steel hype away from ghost busters I think it will I do I think it will I think people have been excited by ghost busters I think people have been frustrated by the ghost busters issues but this announcement today I think showcases a few things I think to me it showcases that stern can is it can easily like a race any bad will by simply correcting the problems on ghost busters but also by continuing to release new games.

[08:51] And I think it's going to be a new titles and shipping them pretty quickly after their reveal so it says these games are going to ship in November now those dates hold up I mean think about it think about it I mean these guys just keep on shipping pinball machines and and I think it's going to be an error now where all these competitors you know there are opportunities for them to strike but they're never going to come close to stern if they can't if they can't get new games out consistently.

[09:21] And the in the companies that have these factories setting up whether a tie way whether it's JJP you know you need to the pace at which stern moves is absolutely ridiculous they really have no competition and you know I really hope that they've got all the issues fixed though because there is going to be a lot of carryover in terms of concern and hesitation to drop the kind of money into these machines if they don't arrive perfectly can you imagine a super L.A.

[09:51] That has ghosted in search or play field shipping I I can't I can't imagine stern will allow this to go up the door without everything being fixed so it's going to be you know I think this is another knockout theme the Batman 66 I think it's just this fun nostalgic sort of comic book stuff like really works well with Batman and for those of you haven't seen like the Batman 66 movie it's just incredible it's got all these fun quotes it's quirky

[10:21] you know you're you're defeating the penguin the Joker the ridler I mean I think it's going to be awesome awesome and you know it's going to be a fun expo because this game is going to go head to head with alien I think in terms of the two games that people are going to be most curious to see at expo and people's money right I've said this before and I'll say it again people are going to have a lot to choose from

[10:50] come Christmas 2016 come December on where they send their money where they send their money and you know it's it's it's an interesting time you've got you've got big Lebowski you've got Hobbit you've got aliens you've got you've got ghost busters you've got now Batman you've got all these machines that are now shipping you've got Rob Zombie you've got you know it's it's going to come down to the

[11:20] it's going to come down to which company can deliver quality and get people machines quickly now I also think if people don't agree with this you know send me an email but I also think that the volume of machines coming out is unlike any other error and it's it's this is what I predicted a year ago by the end of 2016 there's going to be what six or seven new inbox pinball machines for people to choose from and this one is going to be Stern's

[11:49] you know sort of first LCD game and I look I know for a fact that this isn't one or their juggernaut titles I don't believe I mean this is sort of like a rescan and a re theme that they're going to implement the new technology and but we know Star Wars is common right we know these other sort of humongous juggernaut titles are around the corner

[12:12] so it's really really interesting time for Stern pinball I think people are really excited by this news I was catching some of the commentary on pin sight about it but I think the the limited edition nature of this machine is instantly going to make it a conversation piece I think people are going to try and get those super

[12:32] LEDs if they really have something that's different I was joking with someone I know of at Stern I'm like well it can't just be autographed by Adam West right I think I think Ghostbusters showed that if you're going to go

[12:43] Ellie you want a whole different art package on the cabinet like it really needs to feel different visually and I think Stern probably realize that with with Ghostbusters and saw the popularity of the Ellie sell out so quickly

[12:56] so exciting day for those of you who who didn't see I would go over to pin sight join the conversation I it's funny I can't even log on the pin sight at work anymore because Robin banned my entire company's IP from being able to log in the pin sight which is a good thing we'll talk about that on later episode

[13:15] but but on this special edition of canators pinball podcast I just want to say look how exciting it is whenever we get new news on a new machine and I think

[13:25] people have short memories in this hobby and we'll just say take my money Stern's only going to make 30 of these take my 10 grand Stern's only make 240 these take my 8000 9000 dollars we're going to see it all over again I predict that Batman is going to sell out in a day or two just like Ghostbusters did and I think this is the future of pinball

[13:43] Stern's going to make very sort of select limited number pins three word their die hard fans

[13:49] and I think it's just going to keep the second mark second hand market on these games healthy because there's not going to be that many of the floating around I think Jersey Jack when they make like 1500

[14:00] Ellie's silly how silly do those Ellie's look now how silly if Jack only made 150 small editions all right then they become something sought after something exciting but when you just keep pumping them out nobody cares

[14:13] I mean even if you make even the rob zombies the Ellie's are the ones that people ultimately are going to want so exciting day exciting day as we learn more information we'll discuss it on the podcast but until then I think this is going to be a great expo I've got my hotel room booked I haven't committed flights yet but

[14:31] Canada will most likely be at expo to flip on this machine let's wait to see more good night I have the strangest feeling that I am about to be utterly and madly carried away do we dare why not yes of course why not
