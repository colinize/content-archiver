[00:00] All right, here we are.

[00:09] Live from the back yard.

[00:12] Beautiful day here.

[00:14] Such a beautiful day, such a crime to talk pinball, but we're going to do it.

[00:18] We're going to do it anyway.

[00:21] Let's get our Facebook going.

[00:24] Facebook, Saturday morning, spectacular.

[00:27] How's everybody doing?

[00:29] Nobody's in the house yet.

[00:36] August 23rd.

[00:40] Feeling good.

[00:41] Hungover.

[00:43] As life should be.

[00:46] Oh my god.

[00:48] We're going to hear a little bit of that.

[00:50] Is that too?

[00:51] Let me know if that's too annoying.

[00:53] If you even pick that up, I've got my, um,

[00:55] I'm going to do it.

[00:58] My air conditioning unit.

[01:01] I'm out in the back yard.

[01:04] Good morning, Robert.

[01:06] Good morning, Nick.

[01:07] Good morning, Eric.

[01:08] How's everybody doing?

[01:10] We had a lot to talk about in the world of pinball.

[01:13] No drama today.

[01:14] In fact, I mean, I make a little bit of an announcement, but, um, about all the,

[01:19] not even drama, just like how I want to do this channel moving forward and how I want to hang out with the Canadian club members and the community that enjoys Canadian pinball podcast.

[01:24] Feeling very blessed to be here in Related Connecticut.

[01:28] Heaven on earth.

[01:29] Really, it is.

[01:30] Brenda Sisters, you're sad boy.

[01:32] We've been lowering our amounts.

[01:34] I missed the 50 bucks, brother.

[01:36] Let's see.

[01:37] What's good, brother?

[01:38] I'm buying a home use only guns, rooms is Ellie with the top or less than 400 plays on it.

[01:44] Literally three K worth of mods for only 7500.

[01:49] I'm committing highway robbery.

[01:51] Well, not a bad buy.

[01:53] Could you could get Ellie's for like 6500 now, 6,000.

[01:59] Uh, but probably not with 400 plays in the top or so.

[02:03] I don't think that's a bad buy for you, sad boy.

[02:05] I don't think you're going to be sad with that game.

[02:07] I think it's a great look in the end.

[02:09] All these all these Jersey Jack games for less than $8,000 are incredible buys.

[02:14] Everybody knows that there are some really good deals out there.

[02:18] The sucker move is new in box for 13, new in box for 15.

[02:23] I think it's just a sucker move.

[02:25] Um, why would you not get G and R data East?

[02:27] Well, Daniel, I don't know, man, the the JJP G and R is better than the data East G and R.

[02:32] Come on, like let's not, we don't have to say silly things like it's not.

[02:36] It's much, much better.

[02:39] Hmm.

[02:40] Got my ice coffee, went to the gym today, feeling really good, really positive vibes.

[02:45] Good week at work.

[02:47] Let's just put this here.

[02:48] This is fine.

[02:49] Good week at work.

[02:51] How to have a tough conversation at work with some people that were just kind of micromanaging and making everybody stressed out.

[02:58] And I had a sort of.

[03:01] Just put the hammer down a little bit and just be like, we're not doing this.

[03:04] We're not doing this.

[03:05] We're not treating each other like this.

[03:06] We're not acting like transactional ships in the night.

[03:11] Either we care about each other as people or we're not working together professionally.

[03:15] And you know what?

[03:16] A month later, everyone's feeling great.

[03:18] The team's doing great work and everyone's.

[03:20] Everyone's like collaborating as a team should.

[03:23] It's.

[03:24] It was time.

[03:25] It was time.

[03:26] Should we talk a little bit about cracker barrel?

[03:28] Well, we'll talk about cracker bill and a little bit cracker barrel.

[03:32] Um, but yeah, man, that's the industry I work in.

[03:35] So if you ever wonder why.

[03:38] I love and hate what I do for a living at times.

[03:41] It's because it's inundated with people that don't get it.

[03:44] They don't get culture.

[03:45] They don't get target audiences.

[03:47] They make silly mistakes.

[03:48] And then they hide behind their virtual signaling all the time.

[03:51] But we're not going to.

[03:52] This is not Canadian virtual signaling podcast.

[03:54] It's.

[03:55] Canadian Spinball Christopher Branch.

[03:57] You welcome, brother.

[03:58] Um,

[04:00] uh, told that slam tilt podcast to pull in his.

[04:06] I don't know.

[04:07] I don't know.

[04:08] I don't know.

[04:09] I don't know, man.

[04:10] I, um,

[04:11] I think what happens when there's not like a new game out.

[04:15] A lot of the content creator drama like pops up because people lose sight of what people actually want to hear about.

[04:21] So we've got a lot to talk about game because I really threw those rumors out there.

[04:26] And confirm what's coming.

[04:28] And.

[04:29] I've already upset some people.

[04:31] I know some people are angry that I've sort of let the cat out of the bag on some of these rumors.

[04:36] And I'll tell you this.

[04:38] It's going to be a crazy 2026.

[04:41] I think that 2026 is going to be won by.

[04:46] J.J.P. and spooky.

[04:48] That's my prediction.

[04:49] I do.

[04:50] I think these two companies.

[04:52] Really have the most momentum.

[04:55] And really have the most.

[04:57] I think the themes people want the most.

[04:59] I really do believe that.

[05:00] How's everybody doing today?

[05:01] See it's a beautiful Saturday morning.

[05:03] And being inside playing pinball is criminal today.

[05:09] So we're outside.

[05:10] I love how like,

[05:12] how radically different my background is to like the majority of people who do content in this space where it's like all games and dark little basements and LED lights and you know neon signs.

[05:24] Of companies and I'm just here like, I don't know, just chilling.

[05:27] I almost feel good enough to have like a breakfast beer.

[05:29] You know what I'm going to do?

[05:30] Brian, thank you for the 99 cents.

[05:32] You know what I'm going to do?

[05:33] How many of you out there?

[05:34] Let me let me ask you a serious question.

[05:35] How many of you out there?

[05:36] Like every week or every couple weeks,

[05:40] maybe once a month, maybe twice a month.

[05:43] Would be interested in a drunken canator show.

[05:51] I don't know.

[05:54] Like, you know, kind of like drunk history.

[05:56] It'd be fun.

[05:57] I think I want to do it with kale though.

[05:58] Him and I should do it together.

[06:00] Because I think it'd be a lot of fun.

[06:01] We just we just keep drinking and we just, you know, take the piss out of the hobby and in more of an R rated way.

[06:08] And I think it would be really funny.

[06:09] And I want to make that a $30 subscription show.

[06:17] Yeah.

[06:18] Yeah.

[06:19] What's up?

[06:20] Retro.

[06:21] Jenga is watching on Facebook.

[06:22] Retro.

[06:23] Jenga is might be watching on YouTube.

[06:26] We're going to talk all about the rumors.

[06:28] We're going to talk all about the stuff coming down the pipeline.

[06:32] Lots of stuff.

[06:33] You know, I think what's going to be crazy is the hits and misses.

[06:37] We're going to see in Pimble.

[06:39] The hits and misses for sure.

[06:40] What designer is making transformers?

[06:42] I don't know.

[06:43] I don't even know if transformers is confirmed.

[06:45] I'd be shocked if barrels of fun does not have transformers with Brian Savage having run the GI Joe and transformer fan sites and conventions for like 20 years.

[06:57] Yeah.

[06:58] There's there's a guy that knows the relationship better at Hasbro than that dude.

[07:04] So I'd be shocked if he didn't find a way to use his personal relationships to secure those two licenses.

[07:11] But I don't know for sure.

[07:13] But you know, the rumor of like Stern having transformers and I don't know.

[07:17] Stern's got most of the leverage when it comes to securing licenses.

[07:21] I don't know.

[07:22] Maybe fun with drunk canate about please no repeat of the twippy loss.

[07:25] Well, it was stolen from you, but no repeat of that.

[07:28] Yes, got you know, the silver lining of the twippy loss and my my hissy fit.

[07:33] Was you know, becoming really great friends with kale.

[07:38] You know, before then like kale and I were friendly, you know, we kind of bonded at the JJP meetup.

[07:43] But post twippy loss was we both have like become like kind of like pinball besties in a way.

[07:53] It's awesome.

[07:54] Like him and Rachel are awesome.

[07:55] Electric bad is awesome.

[07:57] They're you know, they're just good people.

[07:59] And they're really down to earth and they they don't take themselves too seriously.

[08:04] You know, I moments were absolutely take myself too seriously and I like, you know, act like a child and throw hissy fits and.

[08:13] And then I wake up and I'm like, why did I do that?

[08:16] Like that was stupid.

[08:18] I was, I was, you know, I felt blindsided by that loss.

[08:22] But also, you know, it's not.

[08:25] It's not that it was Rob man, like people didn't vote.

[08:28] They didn't vote.

[08:29] When the year prior when I won, I got 600 first place votes.

[08:33] I only got like 100 like 220.

[08:37] So people didn't show up.

[08:38] People didn't care about the twippies.

[08:42] Let's see what we got here.

[08:46] Try pronouncing revisionist with that much alcohol in you.

[08:50] Look electric cat.

[08:54] Cracker barrel anybody who wants to go to cracker barrel.

[08:57] Yeah, I did get a correspondence from the organizer of pinball expo to not go to expo.

[09:07] It was, you know, it was like, there's a little like weird.

[09:10] I'm sitting out on a beautiful that related market with my boy Frank the Angelo.

[09:17] And we're having a nice coffee and we're just having a nice time and he's like, and I get a text message and I read it.

[09:24] And, and it's basically Rob Burke who I really respect Rob is a really nice guy.

[09:30] You know, I know like Rob's like the messenger.

[09:32] Like it's this is not Rob wanting this is like people complaining to him.

[09:39] So he was like Chris, I'm going to have, you know, I want to ask you to like respectfully not come to expo because of people's not wanting you there.

[09:50] So you know, I didn't fly up the handle. I just called him.

[09:54] I was very nice about it. He said that it was.

[09:58] It's Bob, isn't it Rob Burke? It's Bob Burke.

[10:03] I thought it's Rob. Isn't it Rob Burke?

[10:09] I mean Robert and Bob are like, isn't that like interchangeable?

[10:13] Okay, I thought it was Robert Burke.

[10:16] Okay. What's up, Kale? So he called he we spoke.

[10:22] And he, he was very nice. You know, he said that it was Jersey Jack who had the issue with me being there, which I was confused by because I was just trying to think like.

[10:37] Maybe at last year's expo Jersey Jack was a little upset because I wasn't, you know, promoting avatar. But you know, I told Rob was like, dude, I just, I literally just hung out with Brett Abyss.

[10:49] So I highly doubt that JJP would be opposed to my presence at expo.

[10:56] So, you know, and he was kind of like, yeah, you know, let me, let me check. Let me see what the issue is. And we are I 100% no David fix doesn't ever want to see me ever again.

[11:05] And and look, as, as last year's show indicated, if I saw Mr. David fix, I would shake his hand and say, how you doing David?

[11:14] You know, good luck with everything and move on. I mean, that's it. I don't have any ill will.

[11:17] I don't, I don't wake up and want to see anything bad happen to any of those people. Even if some of those people really wanted bad stuff to happen to me.

[11:25] And I see it. Like I understand the reason why they did that is they think that my, my disparaging comments about their companies are the reason why their companies failed.

[11:36] And they put blame on me for their lackluster sales. And I, I don't think I deserve that. I don't think whether I make content here in my backyard or, or content in my office at work.

[11:49] I don't think that makes your game any better. And I, I've always felt that when the content creators get accused by the manufacturers of being the reason why the companies failed.

[12:04] Andrew highway vehemently believes that I caused people to get refunds and, and cause the collapse of his company.

[12:10] The lack of accountability internally at these companies by these decision makers. It never ceases to amaze me. I mean, I bet Marty and Damien also feel like my, my interrogation of their lies and their deception and their manipulation was one of the reasons why Haggis failed.

[12:35] You know, not, not the fact that they got into a big factory they didn't need not, not that they didn't understand how expensive it was actually get into manufacturing.

[12:44] Not that, you know, kelts should have been the end of that company. I mean, I always said that.

[12:48] Kelt should have been the end of Haggis Pimble. It, it never should have got past kelts.

[12:54] And having Keltz, like, you know what I'm saying? Like, Keltz should have laughed you at that you should have been laughed out of the convention with Keltz.

[13:03] And you should go back to, I don't know, doing whatever he did. He does like some, you know, Damien was another one of these Andrew highways. This is what the guys don't get is like he had all these businesses going on. And they were all kind of like,

[13:15] they're all like a little shady, you know, there's like real estate development pinball this that technology services like it doesn't work like these guys that think they're like serial entrepreneurs who can't do any one thing right.

[13:29] And what happens with all them is always the same thing. They usually hit paid her on one of their ventures and they make some money.

[13:36] And then they think they're going to be successful doing everything. And that's where the money, you know, I mean, you got to remember like Damien Harden walked away burning hundreds of thousands of dollars of consumer dollars and we're never returned to customers.

[13:52] He literally he set up at his LLC, whatever he did and he and people never got their refunds. And you know, and that's why Marty Robbins will never be really allowed back in this community, even no matter how hard some of his buddies try to say he wasn't responsible.

[14:10] It's you are responsible you you now have a job to get refunds for those people. It was your company. You were a partner in it. You went on all the content shows and convinced people everything was okay.

[14:22] And you hold some accountability for that. And when you pay people back, you will be forgiven. And we would happily love to have you back in the community.

[14:32] It's like Barry like he made everybody whole on big love outskirts took 12 years, but he made everybody whole and nobody's calling Barry a crook anymore.

[14:41] Because he like he redeemed himself and again, you can't believe in God. And you can't believe in just decency as a human. If you don't have forgiveness as a, as a trait. I really do believe that. And so speaking of that, just just want to say this real quick for everybody.

[14:59] You know, I've had my what's the best way is it a tassel? Is that a word with some of these content creators? You know, I woke up the other day. I'm like, you know, I'm just tired of like always trying to bury hatchets and I'm not going to do it anymore.

[15:15] So what I'm going to do is just not let those people who don't want to be part of this part of this. So they're not going to see this content anymore.

[15:26] They're not invited to be part of Canadian Spinball podcast page.

[15:30] No rule they be here. So I don't think any of us are going to feel any loss whatsoever. And all that is is like I just I don't need people lurking in in the shadows, you know, getting inspiration from my content.

[15:43] And I know when you lose access to Canadian Spinball podcast, you lose access to the most entertaining, the most informative and the most like I just think the best pinball podcast there is.

[15:56] I mean, I feel that way about myself. I mean, it's not about an award. I think that the 20 to 25 minutes, three times a week is the model that works. And I think it works the best. And I think you hear everything in a timely, relevant fashion. And I think that's that.

[16:12] So it's good. It's good. I feel good about it. I think you guys are going to feel good about it. And I don't think there's going to like because I don't want to get into what we got into like was it last week or two weeks ago, where people are popping in and then like, you know, sort of not responding.

[16:27] And I'm not doing it. I don't need those distractions. And I don't even need anybody else's content to make the best content. I feel like I've got an approach and a way of doing this that absolutely works for me. And I know it works for you.

[16:41] So let's talk about these rumors. Steve Richie is making Sonic the hedgehog. And it's something that I knew about personally. I know that Jason nap put up the his post about it. And he had like that was like his guests.

[16:56] You know, I love Jason. I do though. I do think Jason needs to make the site go back to being the lighter color. I don't like the dark color of Nafs arcade. I don't like it. Like, I'm going to text him that today. He you can switch it. But like, switch it back.

[17:14] I just something about the dog. It's like cracker bell. Like don't change a good thing. I know his son's worked on the site. Just don't change it. Just don't change a good thing. It was like, people get familiar and accustomed to something.

[17:27] Yeah, just just leave it. Just leave it.

[17:30] Notice how there is like one with 80 people watching 8xD.

[17:35] All right. So we'll talk about, let's talk about Sonic. So here's what I know.

[17:43] And you know, I mean, take this with a little bit of a grain of salt. But people who have played the whitewood say it is the greatest Steve Richie game of all time. And it is not just a recycled Steve Richie game.

[17:55] What they say they're like Chris man, the speed like what the balls doing like people are just going to be blown away.

[18:03] And when you think about Sonic, it's the perfect theme for Pimble. It has, yeah, it better have a loop. It better have like, I think they're going to have like bucks like firing the ball like so freaking fast. And I think they're going to be a lot of that.

[18:18] Because remember, that's a lot of what Sonic is. It's like he starts spinning in place and then he shoots off.

[18:24] Steve told me it's the cutest game he's made. Well, the other thing too is it's going to be based on the Sega arcade. Not sorry, not arcade Sega video game from the home.

[18:37] Right. It's not going to be based on the movies, which is another great thing. Like I don't think anybody wanted the TV the movies with Jim carry.

[18:47] We want it like the Sonic we've going up with. So I'm excited. It's a while, it's a while out, right. It's a while out.

[18:57] I know that the people over at Jersey Jack, you know, when I talk to them, they have this air now of confidence and swagger they haven't had before.

[19:08] I think they had it when G&R came out and I think G&R hit hard. But then all the play, playfields are falling apart. And I think that like really bummed out Eric for a long time.

[19:21] But I know these guys feel like they've got like they've got like some mega mega games coming out over the next four or five years and they're super excited.

[19:33] And I like that it's one, you know, one massive hit a year is what they're aiming for.

[19:39] I think that there's no looking back. They're never remaking pirates. This is a company moving forward. And I'm excited about what JJP has going forward because I do think Stern's in big trouble.

[19:53] If they think they can charge with their charging and Jersey Jack just makes Stern's look like tinker toys. And you know, I'm going to talk about Stern in a little bit.

[20:04] But I think Stern's been way too slow to elevate like the quality of their product.

[20:12] And quality does not mean just like reliability. I just mean material quality.

[20:20] It's a great time for a Canadian pinball podcast. Thank you Trent. I appreciate it brother. How's everybody doing by the way? Like really great having we have 90 people on YouTube and we have 25 on Facebook.

[20:33] If you guys are liking the content recently, you know, you know, me I love to get some stars show your support. I'm doing these dual now on YouTube and Facebook so people can you know pick where they want to get a free hour to 90 minutes of Canadian pinball podcast.

[20:49] Super excited to do this every week for everybody here.

[20:54] Yes, Bond created an image of an empty sonic playfield. Look, I think everybody loves Elton John as a shooter. I just don't think you wanted Elton John as a theme.

[21:03] And I think sonic is going to be like it is going to be amazing to see Richie do sonic. I'm really excited.

[21:11] So that wasn't the one that got me in trouble. Thank you Wayne for the stars. The one that got me in trouble.

[21:17] Hmm. Canadian. What are you? I suppose to say stuff. Why is he saying this is the big bang bar remake. Yeah, there's a lot of big bang bar remake angry people out there.

[21:31] And you know, I don't care. It's coming out. And it's not coming from anybody in America. How's that? It's not coming from anyone in Europe. It's not coming from anyone in Asia. It's not coming from anybody in South America.

[21:46] It's not, you know, I'm just throwing out. Actually, all that was just made up. So, so we'll see who it's coming from. I'll say this. It's not.

[21:57] It's not coming from CGC. And I've said that before. See, no big bang bar was never a CGC. Next from CGC is a twilight zone. And then I guess the, you know, the, the, the, the Halo game that is never coming out.

[22:14] Let's see. No, I think Sonic's going to do great guys. Don't, don't, don't sleep on Sonic. And you know, it'd be great if Stern had Super Mario brothers. I think they both be great.

[22:28] I don't know, you know, look, I don't think big bang bar is going to.

[22:36] I heard they're making something like 250 of them or something like that. Like, how many do they make of the last remake?

[22:45] How many big bang bars was it 300 or let or like 80? It was like some low number. Was it like 80 or something or 100? How many?

[22:54] I always forget this part of the big bang bar. I know there was like barely any Capcom ones. There was like 20, 25 original. Okay. So there's 186.

[23:05] So now they're going to make at least that. So they're going to double the number of big bang bars in the world.

[23:13] Now, the other thing I know they're going to do is before the artist and I'm not going to butcher his names, Dan leave food. I'm not going to do it.

[23:23] Before he passed away, unfortunately, he worked on a new art package for the new big bang bar. So I, you know, I don't know if he was able to finish it all, but that will also be part of this.

[23:36] $5. I bet Kaneda has a predator hiding in those trees. Get to the chopper. Eric, thank you for the five bucks, brother.

[23:44] Let me tell you something right now. I think the pinball brothers are done.

[23:51] I don't know if they're going to be done, but that's my guess. I don't think they're going to survive predator.

[23:57] And I think predator is dead on arrival without Arnold. It's dead on arrival at the price they need the charge and them cutting out their distributors is like the last straw.

[24:12] They just cut off the only people that ever helped them move product. I mean, so it's like that's a desperate move by a desperate company who then when they talk tries to talk with confidence and swagger.

[24:27] So I see right through it. I think they're desperate. I think they were expecting sales and they got none. I don't think they sold more than a hundred of these things.

[24:38] And so, you know, to spin it like this is good news and better get yours now. And we only have 150 spots left in our production capabilities for 2025. It's all hogwash.

[24:53] It's all spin. It's all, you know, it's all designed and tailored.

[24:59] You know, word manipulation to try to create a sense that you should act and buy it. It's not going to work.

[25:07] I look forward to playing the damn game at like expo. I think it's just going to be a novelty game. You play it shows and I don't think anyone wants the own one. I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. It's just.

[25:15] It's just a pinball company can't survive with new unbox sales with that being their response to your product lots of games like that gang. I'll jump on a.

[25:23] I'll jump on any pin at a show or at a barcade and enjoy it. I'm not going to open up my wallet and buy stuff like hot wheels, you know, stuff like galactic tank forest. Yeah, I'll play it at a show.

[25:35] The more whiskey you got in you, the better galactic tank force gets.

[25:40] He man.

[25:43] I think if anyone makes he man, it will be spooky.

[25:48] I don't know.

[25:52] The one game I'm always like am I too hard on these guys is doing. I don't.

[26:00] You know, and I think, you know, I've been way, way more judgmental about doing as a theme than as a pin, you know, and I know Mike has one and automated.

[26:10] So I think I might try to drive over there one day soon and just like, you know, bang on it for a few hours. I played it a little bit at a show.

[26:20] It's definitely like a beautiful looking game.

[26:24] And, you know, so I want to give it give it more. Yeah, so wait, I don't I don't deny that I just can't.

[26:34] Hold on a second.

[26:40] Just like the propane was on.

[27:05] I don't know. Okay, when the propane valve was one of the kids must open it was open on.

[27:15] But the barbecued gas was in on. So that means it probably wasn't just like using propane, right?

[27:24] It probably just put enough in the tube.

[27:27] But then it's not going to keep asking for more, right? If the barbecue.

[27:32] Okay, all right. Thank you because you want one day I had a daddy brain and I barbecue dinner and then I just forgot to turn the barbecue off.

[27:42] And I came home. I can't I woke up the next day.

[27:46] And the whole side of the house was just covered in so.

[27:51] You know, gets it off.

[27:55] And then you know, it's just going to clean the clean and you know, it's simple green. Just slowly rub the simple green.

[28:09] Okay, where were we? Okay, so doing yeah, okay, so I'll give doon.

[28:13] I'll give doon more.

[28:16] I think I think what barrels needs.

[28:19] And they're trying and they're getting better. I just think they need better marketing. I think they need better marketing. I think they need a hype guy.

[28:26] I don't think they have a hype guy.

[28:29] I don't think they have a hype guy.

[28:31] I don't even know like.

[28:34] Let me ask you guys a question.

[28:37] Who is like the best hype guys in Pimble like at the on the manufacturer level like bugging Luke are awesome Jack dangerous awesome.

[28:45] You know, I'm sad Jack's kind of like taking a step back. I am I'm sad like.

[28:51] I don't know.

[28:53] I don't you know.

[28:56] People been feeding me like this is why they think it is. I know I know it was like, you know, it seems like there was some.

[29:03] It's tough on the family.

[29:06] I don't want to get into it because it's a personal issue with Jack and that's how I look at it like.

[29:13] I don't know.

[29:15] I don't know.

[29:17] I don't know.

[29:19] I don't know.

[29:20] I can't imagine he wanted to make that decision though.

[29:23] Like he loves Pimble like it's a dream job.

[29:25] Like I don't.

[29:26] Yeah.

[29:27] I mean, it feels like one of those jobs were like if you're doing something you love you don't work a day in your life kind of job.

[29:33] So.

[29:34] I don't think it was the corporate world. I don't. I don't. I don't. I think it was like.

[29:40] I don't know.

[29:42] I don't know.

[29:43] I don't know.

[29:44] I don't know.

[29:46] And I'm just going to say this from my own experience and it's harder now is like.

[29:50] The pressure on like.

[29:52] Dads and.

[29:54] Husbands and careers and it hits both sexes.

[29:59] Like you can't just go off and like.

[30:01] Make it now.

[30:02] You've got to like, you know.

[30:04] I.

[30:06] You know, people are struggling to realize.

[30:10] And you know, you're going to have your kids do eine gute Familie.

[30:13] There's no such thing as paying for their parents.

[30:16] But.

[30:18] One of their reasons why like.

[30:20] I mean, my parents didn't come from any money didn't grow up with money.

[30:22] My mom was a state home mom when she had three boys.

[30:26] And you know, she was like, she's an artist.

[30:28] So she was like sketching houses to make extra money on the side.

[30:31] She had to sell her jewelry to buy us like snow boots.

[30:34] house they got because they just needed a place for their kids.

[30:38] And my dad went to work and focused on work and climbing the corporate ladder.

[30:45] And if he had to be home at six and put the kids down, he wouldn't have got those promotions.

[30:51] He wouldn't have climbed the ladder.

[30:52] He wouldn't have been where he needed to be to impress the people that brought him up

[30:58] with them.

[30:59] And so everything our family has because the dynamic was different than nowadays.

[31:06] It's like, it's like husbands need to do the expectation to do half of the early nurturing

[31:16] of it.

[31:17] It's just not in the nature.

[31:18] Like I'm sorry.

[31:19] And that look, and look, Brenna is amazing.

[31:24] And I do my best.

[31:25] I just did a full week with the kids.

[31:27] And she does it every week.

[31:28] But it's not like I don't deserve any credit.

[31:30] It's what a parent's supposed to do.

[31:32] And it is really hard.

[31:33] But you do get into a routine after a while and it becomes the routine.

[31:36] And I'm sorry, but if you don't want to raise kids and don't have them, that's the other

[31:42] thing too.

[31:43] But you can't have everything.

[31:45] You can't have everything.

[31:46] And I do think sometimes you just got to respect that one person might be more of the

[31:52] breadwinner and one person might need a little bit more.

[31:58] Like flexibility to bake and make it.

[32:00] It's very rare that you have been able to have opportunities to make a good living

[32:04] in this world.

[32:05] I mean, it's easy for all of us.

[32:08] We're like 99% men in Pimball.

[32:10] Talkin' like this.

[32:17] So word is, from a very reliable source that Ellen is really unhappy at Stern.

[32:23] Yeah.

[32:24] I mean, Brenna and I are great.

[32:27] I love my wife more than anything.

[32:31] She lets me be me.

[32:32] She loves that I do all this Pimball content.

[32:34] You know, whenever the Pimball content wouldn't get me down, she's just like, at those guys.

[32:38] What are you worried about?

[32:39] Like, what anybody thinks?

[32:40] Just keep doing your stuff.

[32:41] I love you.

[32:42] She calls me baby boy.

[32:43] I call the baby girl.

[32:44] I love it.

[32:45] Well, it's, you know, let's see.

[32:50] Steven Jacobson is here.

[32:52] Steven, what's up brother?

[32:54] I got the GNR shirt.

[32:55] You want to see it?

[32:57] You guys want to see a shirt that costs as much as a top or half as much of a top or hold

[33:02] on.

[33:03] Let me go get it.

[33:04] It's so cool.

[33:05] They made these specially in 1993 when Guns and Roses was touring Europe.

[33:11] There's a special concert that Johnny Versace organized and Axel was there and he wore, he

[33:18] had a special shirt that he actually got arrested in with the usual illusion on it and it

[33:26] was amazing.

[33:27] But this is like, this is the shirt they gave to the staff that were working the concert.

[33:31] Let me go get it.

[33:32] Oh, that's really cool.

[34:26] All right, you ready?

[34:33] See that Versace Guns and Roses.

[34:41] The back is the coolest part though.

[34:43] Ready?

[34:44] Oh yeah, Axel wear in this.

[34:47] It's a great shot of Axel wear in the center stage.

[34:54] Get in the ring.

[34:57] On Facebook, it's all backwards.

[34:59] I love it.

[35:01] But you can see Canada rocking this.

[35:04] Vintage baby.

[35:05] I've been waiting.

[35:06] I waited like, I waited like 20 years to find that t-shirt.

[35:22] Steven knows it.

[35:27] Like those things don't come up for sale often.

[35:29] Like the dudes who have all this like, G&R memorabilia, like they hold onto it.

[35:33] Steven's got some of the greatest.

[35:34] Steven here is my friend guys from New York City.

[35:37] He owns Guns and Roses, collect those additions that I hooked them up with and he's got the

[35:40] dad at East next to it.

[35:42] Huge G&R fan.

[35:43] One of the coolest things Steven has is he has, when Axel was performing at a concert, he

[35:50] was singing, oh my god.

[35:52] And Axel rode out the lyrics to the song like on a piece of paper in his like iconic handwriting.

[36:00] Axel's handwriting is super cool.

[36:02] And Steven's got that.

[36:03] And I believe Dell James handed it to him.

[36:06] And I was like here.

[36:07] And like, so like I was like, dude, like that's just like the coolest thing to have Axel

[36:11] Rose right out his own music lyrics before going on stage and you have it.

[36:18] So let me tell you guys right now.

[36:19] I've been catching a lot of flak and I just, Steven, you got to listen to this album,

[36:23] telling you don't sleep on it.

[36:25] Like I know that people have all this prejudice around machine gun Kelly and think he's a

[36:29] chump and this and that.

[36:31] This new album by machine gun Kelly lost Americana is one of the best rock and roll albums I've

[36:37] heard.

[36:38] I mean that.

[36:39] And I look, I like all good rock albums and you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, when

[36:46] you know the story of this album to where he basically like wrote all the songs, wrote

[36:52] all the music in his living room with his friends, you know, this isn't like, this isn't

[36:58] like he brought in producers to help him out the way all these other artists do.

[37:02] And that's and you should see the interviews with him.

[37:05] It's really cool.

[37:06] Like and the thing is like the dude hit like rock bottom like he did and he like F. Dup was

[37:13] on drugs like lost his, you know, lost Megan Fox.

[37:16] They have a daughter together like he hit rock bottom as a, as a like man is searching

[37:21] for his own like fighting through his own insecurities, his own vanity and then writes

[37:26] this album and it's great.

[37:28] So Josh, when you say his music is awful, I, I think he's got a lot of bad albums.

[37:36] Same way M&M had a lot of bad albums before he came out with recovery.

[37:41] My point is Josh, turn off the skepticism and just listen, listen to lost Americana.

[37:50] And I don't know how you can't like this album if you like 80s and rock and punk and like

[37:57] and the songs are all so good and he crashes into like, yeah, no, it's okay, man.

[38:04] It's okay.

[38:05] You're not vibing with it.

[38:06] That's okay.

[38:07] I'm not going to force it.

[38:08] It's fun in the demon baby when I'm rolling in the demon.

[38:14] It's not auto tuned.

[38:15] You want to be pump pop.

[38:18] Anyway, all right, where were we?

[38:21] Predator fails on.

[38:24] Is, is, is you guys think predator ends pinball brothers?

[38:29] What do you think?

[38:33] What do you think?

[38:34] Is it the pinball brothers going to survive?

[38:36] We've got Christopher French here.

[38:38] Can you ask, can you answer us a question?

[38:41] I mean, you can't confirm it's Beetlejuice, but can you confirm for us that Michael Keaton's

[38:44] clips are in it?

[38:47] So people like it is a little bit of a bummer.

[38:49] I think bug and Luke have spoken on this and it's weird because like they haven't confirmed

[38:53] it's Beetlejuice, but they've confirmed that Michael Keaton's not doing the callouts.

[38:58] So it's like, why would you need them to do the callouts if you're not doing Beetlejuice?

[39:07] Well, Josh, you know, it's a good song.

[39:10] I don't care if it's auto tuned.

[39:12] I don't care.

[39:13] Good music, good music.

[39:16] It's like, I hope all of you have your orders in for Beetlejuice.

[39:21] I hope you do.

[39:23] So I haven't shown you guys yet, but Frank DiAngelo came over here.

[39:29] Let's talk about this.

[39:30] He came over here and he helped me move my two Neo Geos that were in the garage upstairs.

[39:38] And now what that means is, what that means is, well, first of all, Axler Rose would smack

[39:46] you, Josh, for spelling his name wrong.

[39:49] Come on, man.

[39:50] Nobody spells it like that.

[39:52] Nobody.

[39:57] You know, the thing is this, I now have room for a pinball machine in the garage and I'm

[40:01] going to get a second pin.

[40:03] Guns and roses is staying here.

[40:05] I now want to make the garage, the area where I swap in and out games.

[40:11] I want to play more games and have time on stuff.

[40:17] But I don't want the garage game to be like the Ellie that I'm just collecting forever

[40:23] and then I don't want to get rid of it.

[40:25] No, the whole point is I want to swap in and out.

[40:28] And what I want to do is, you know, maybe work with a dealer or something or, you know,

[40:35] to like borrow a game for like a week or a month or like a week.

[40:40] My problem is like, I just don't think it's like people want to give you a game to honestly

[40:45] review.

[40:46] I think there's always pressure to, you know, if, if, if barrels of fun sends me a

[40:50] dune, there's going to be pressure to like, just like, say you like it.

[40:56] So I don't know, like, I, it's hard to be an objective content creator when you accept

[41:02] something.

[41:03] So I might just have to purchase them be fully transparent and not, you know, but I'm

[41:11] not going to buy something I don't want to actually have in my house, though, too, you

[41:14] know what I'm saying?

[41:15] I'm not going to be like, I'm not going to be losing thousands of dollars like rotating

[41:18] games in and out.

[41:19] That's not happening.

[41:24] Is Beto just just the first movie sequels junk?

[41:27] Let's see.

[41:29] Let's see.

[41:30] You know, look, I really, I, I, I, I want to say I really think that Star Wars might

[41:37] take that spot.

[41:40] And I think that's going to be what I want to put there is Star Wars.

[41:46] I hope it's great.

[41:47] I really do.

[41:48] I hope John Borg has like some, like a redemption pin.

[41:56] Why would Keith L. Wouldn't be miserable at Stern?

[41:59] Like, why?

[42:02] He's got the biggest team working with him.

[42:05] He gets to have a game or two out of year, usually two.

[42:09] He's probably the highest paid designer in all of Pimball.

[42:13] He probably gets a royalty on number of games sold.

[42:18] I'm not worried if he goes to J.J.P., which people are rumoring, okay, so then what happens?

[42:23] He gets a game out every three years.

[42:26] You know, Eric, Steve, Elwyn.

[42:30] I don't think Mark Siden is like on the roster for a next one.

[42:33] Maybe he is.

[42:34] I don't know.

[42:35] But you know what I'm saying?

[42:36] If J.J.P only does one game a year, you're just always waiting online to be at the plate.

[42:45] Let's see.

[42:46] Is this franchy talking about Beto juice?

[42:48] Well, I think what spooky will do with Beto juice, like they did with evil dead gang,

[42:53] they just get the pick.

[42:54] Do you want to play movie one or play movie two?

[42:55] That's cool.

[42:56] That's the way to do it.

[42:57] I love that approach to handling multiple like movies like that.

[43:06] Yeah.

[43:07] J.J.P might scale up some.

[43:11] I think it just comes down to workers.

[43:15] It really feels like that, right?

[43:16] It's like to have a second line, you just need more workers.

[43:19] They've got this space for a second line.

[43:22] And they also just, you know, these companies could also do double shifts.

[43:26] Like there's a day shift and a night shift or morning shift and a night shift.

[43:29] Like that's how like plants operate around the world.

[43:38] Well I think L.W.N. is probably not used to like Kong didn't hit, right?

[43:47] Like for all intensive purposes, if I said that right, Kong's been a bust.

[43:56] And Kong's a bust because of the price.

[44:03] And Kong's a bust because they made them all look the same.

[44:06] It's not a bust because the gameplay, the gameplay is great.

[44:10] It's not a bust because the max, there's a lot of fun Mexican Kong.

[44:14] It's just a bust because when you add it all up, it just doesn't feel like it's worth

[44:19] the money.

[44:22] You don't remember two L ones in the same year.

[44:27] I think there was a year there were two L ones.

[44:29] I mean, I feel like Jaws and Kong were just like a year apart, right?

[44:39] I haven't seen the new, the new Dune stuff.

[44:42] So I'm going to go check it out and I'm going to go automated has it.

[44:47] I'm going to tell Frank and he's update the code on it.

[44:51] And yeah, let me see how the gameplay is.

[44:54] You know, I've always just been, I just, my feelings are undue or simply this.

[45:04] If it was any other theme that people had more of an emotional connection to, he would

[45:08] have to sold all 1,000 of them in a week.

[45:16] To have to slow burn sell the game, even if it is a great game, it's just like, you know,

[45:23] I mean, I guess the saving grace for barrels, much like all these boutiques is they can slow

[45:30] burn sell because they can only slowly make.

[45:34] They just need to always have more sold than parts have been ordered for.

[45:38] I think that's, that's it.

[45:39] If they can stay ahead of that, they'll be fine.

[45:42] See, Stern doesn't have that luxury.

[45:45] Stern's got to sell thousands of each.

[45:48] And what Stern's problem, which other manufacturers don't have is, you know, Stern's got a big

[45:53] problem because they've got that big warehouse and factory with thousands of unsold games

[45:57] out here.

[45:58] And then they've got dealers and distros around the country with thousands of unsold Venoms

[46:04] and John Wicks.

[46:06] And you name it.

[46:07] There's just all this unsold inventory and Stern needs those people to keep buying the

[46:12] new stuff.

[46:14] And when you have a game like Kong and anyone who like overbought, you know, it just doesn't

[46:19] work.

[46:20] And then they just go back and remake another jaws or remake another this and they're

[46:23] going to keep doing that.

[46:24] And like, so when they remake Walking Dead, like, so then every single Walking Dead owner

[46:28] is going to put up their old game for sale.

[46:31] And then they're going to do the same thing again and again and again.

[46:34] It's like, I just, I don't know, Stern just kind of destroyed its own collectability.

[46:40] And I haven't seen them.

[46:42] I don't understand what they're doing on a marketing level.

[46:44] Like they hired the new CMO.

[46:47] They've got Spike 3.

[46:49] They haven't really made a big deal about it.

[46:52] There's not like a launch date of Spike 3.

[46:55] The details come out with a podcast interview that like, but like why isn't there like a,

[47:02] like Stern should have like one C year, like what Apple does.

[47:05] They should have like a day in which they unveil all their latest innovations and technologies.

[47:11] They don't do any of that.

[47:12] Like it's just, I don't they just feel this like, and I understand like, but just, I don't

[47:17] know, make it a moment.

[47:18] Why isn't Spike 3's reveal a moment of the new cabinet, the new lighting, the new

[47:23] this, the new screen.

[47:24] Why isn't it a moment?

[47:28] Who is your favorite pinball manufacturer currently?

[47:32] Spooky.

[47:37] My second favorite currently right now is Jersey Jack.

[47:42] And my third favorite is Stern.

[47:47] Now I don't know about you guys, but like those three are like my three favorites just

[47:51] because I, I think I have all the companies out there.

[47:54] Like they're the ones that I just look forward to seeing what they have coming.

[47:58] Nobody else has that level of, you know, like nobody else has that level of attention from

[48:05] the community.

[48:06] And I think everyone's, I think everyone's top three are probably those three.

[48:10] I don't, I don't like CGC the way they keep everybody in the dark.

[48:12] I don't, I just don't like that.

[48:16] Beryl's is fine.

[48:17] I don't, I don't, I don't labyrinth into Dune doesn't excite me as a 49 year old

[48:27] with money to burn who grew up in the 80s and 90s.

[48:32] I don't get excited by either of those.

[48:33] And like I grew up in the 80s.

[48:34] I just wasn't a labyrinth guy.

[48:36] And if I watched labyrinth, I watched it because I thought Jennifer Connolly was making

[48:40] me tingle, right?

[48:42] And they took her out of the game.

[48:44] So I don't, I wouldn't watch, imagine watching labyrinth without her in it.

[48:47] I don't get it.

[48:48] I don't want to play like I'd rather play the muppets.

[48:58] Stern still makes the funnest games.

[49:01] Is it funnest or most fun?

[49:06] I don't know, I think a lot of people would argue that Harry Potter is more fun than King Kong.

[49:10] I think a lot of people would say that.

[49:13] I think a lot of people would say that Elton John is more fun than John Wick and more fun

[49:20] than Venom and more fun, you know.

[49:28] I think Stern games are great, the ones that are great.

[49:31] When Stern makes a great game, they make a great game.

[49:35] There's no denying that again.

[49:36] You don't become the biggest pinball coming to the world by making garbage.

[49:40] I just think Stern's licensing and Jody's decision making has been really bad.

[49:46] They just, again, they just, they always will come back to, how did you pass on back

[49:51] to the future?

[49:53] How did you do that?

[49:58] Yeah, like, I'm excited to see what barrels does next.

[50:02] I know, I know some of the titles that barrels was pursuing or claim to have had when I signed

[50:10] my NDA.

[50:12] One of them for me is an InstaBuy and they both were InstaBuy's, but they had lost one

[50:18] of the licenses that I was told they had.

[50:23] They were both InstaBuy's for me.

[50:25] So look, I just, it's easy for me to not buy a dune.

[50:29] I don't think I'm unfairly ragging on dune, but, you know, it's not moving the way I

[50:37] think they thought it would.

[50:41] My Iron Man and Pro has me currently $4,500 on the use market.

[50:46] Say what you will about the communication and slow in this, but CGC games speak for themselves.

[50:52] Yeah, I don't want to own any of them, though.

[50:55] I don't like supporting companies that do things that way.

[51:00] There's so many other good games and I don't want my money to go to CGC because of how

[51:07] they deal with their customers.

[51:11] I think they're smug about it.

[51:12] I think they don't care because, to me, it's not hard to just communicate.

[51:21] And to be transparent and to, you know, just let people know where you're at and just

[51:27] tell the truth.

[51:28] Let people know like how delayed things are.

[51:31] Tell the truth.

[51:32] They don't do any of it.

[51:33] So I don't want, I would never give them any of my money.

[51:37] Do you have any recommendation for a first pinball machine for a home?

[51:42] That's a good question.

[51:43] A first pinball machine.

[51:45] Ah, yeah, it's a really good question.

[51:50] If I were to, first of all, I think there's two things.

[51:53] I think it would be a stern.

[51:56] It would be a stern machine because I think again, you want something that's, they're the

[52:02] most reliable and they have the most, I think most, you know, sterns have the most replay

[52:08] value.

[52:11] From there, you got to kind of, you know, I would say you're going to have to like

[52:15] a theme you like.

[52:17] I do think Lord the Rings is a good one, Hector, but Lord the Rings hard to find now, you

[52:21] know, and it, but that was my first pin.

[52:26] And I will say Lord the Rings is one heck of a great first pin.

[52:30] You know, it's kind of, it's nice too because it's like, it shows you, I think when you

[52:34] get Lord the Rings and you're playing on that DMD, it'll remind you what you love about

[52:39] pinball more than some of the modern stuff because everything magical is happening under

[52:43] the glass.

[52:44] Some of these newer games, they're way too complex.

[52:47] They're a little bit harder to get into.

[52:49] So Lord the Rings is definitely one to think about.

[52:52] I would say this, I'm going to say something just right now.

[52:55] And again, you can kill me.

[52:56] But if I were to get just a first game to have in the home, to just play pin on, get my

[53:05] pinball skills, you know, developed, I would buy an Iron Man.

[53:13] I think an Iron Man would be one of the best first pins you could have for home.

[53:21] I think it's fast, it's fun, but it will like give you all the skills you need to then

[53:29] like become better on every machine you buy after it.

[53:33] There's no clonkiness.

[53:35] It's got a fun Mac, it's got magnets, like it's like a really, really good first pin.

[53:44] And also the thing I like about Iron Man is like, it's not going to cost you like $9,000,000.

[53:54] Star Trek is good too.

[53:55] Well, the problem with the LCD screen guys is it's like this, you then have to fill it

[54:07] with stuff.

[54:08] Yeah, I'm still not sold on eight things happening at once when Harry Potter is being

[54:14] played.

[54:15] Like I don't like that.

[54:16] I love Harry Potter when the full screen becomes something, you know, the movie clips,

[54:21] it takes over like I love the way G and R uses the screen.

[54:25] When Harry Potter is like eight things are happening at once and I just, not how I would

[54:30] do it.

[54:33] A Jurassic Park Pro is a good option too.

[54:42] But again, you know, my advice is always go to a show.

[54:45] This is what I would always do.

[54:48] Go to a show and just play everything.

[54:51] Just play everything.

[54:54] Get in early, play everything, you know, and see, see, see what you like that is really

[55:00] what you have to do.

[55:06] So Star Wars to me gang, it's like I'm just, I don't know.

[55:11] I think there's going to be an ad ad.

[55:12] I heard there's a big ad ad in the upper left of the game.

[55:17] I think they're going to do the orbit around the legs to drop it down.

[55:22] And I think I have to buy that game.

[55:26] I mean, Star Wars, if they get Star Wars right, you know, it'll make hypocrites out of

[55:33] us all.

[55:34] Like the LEs will sell out instantly.

[55:36] Anyone who has the Richie Star Wars is going to just, oh, just their games are just going

[55:41] to tank and value.

[55:44] I don't know, Anthony, like has there hasn't been a great Star Wars machine.

[55:47] So how can you say enough with Star Wars?

[55:49] Like if nobody's made a great Star Wars machine, can you imagine Star Wars on Jersey

[55:53] Jack's platform?

[55:54] Can we just start crying inside that that's not ever going to happen anytime soon though?

[56:00] Can you imagine though, like Jersey Jack with that big screen and this scrolling with the

[56:05] theme song of a new hope?

[56:07] Can you imagine like way more, way more emotional connection than Harry Potter has for people?

[56:18] I mean, the dad at ease Star Wars is not great.

[56:31] Yeah, JC's right.

[56:33] A good first pen is when you can just walk up to and know what you're doing.

[56:37] I think Batman 66 is a good first pen.

[56:39] I got to be honest, not going to be cheap, but it's a good first pen.

[56:42] Yeah, there's never going to be another Guardians.

[56:55] I am.

[56:56] Yeah, I really, I think we might get the Star Wars teaser on Friday and, you know, I think

[57:02] the game will come out like September.

[57:05] I'm excited gang, like really excited to see it.

[57:09] And then it's going to be the countdown to spooky's next game.

[57:13] And, you know, I don't, I think I want to say Big Bang Bar Remake should be at expo.

[57:20] Who's going to expo?

[57:22] I think I will be at expo, you know, Melvin and Rob Burke, Melvin, I, look, I, we've

[57:30] been saying something that we should do.

[57:32] We should do a fundraiser that's a Canadian dunk tank.

[57:38] I really think that would be great.

[57:40] Like we should do a Canadian dunk tank.

[57:42] We can put Damien Harden's face on the bullseye to throw the ball at and you can dunk

[57:49] Canada for like 10 bucks, you know, I think it would be a lot of fun.

[57:53] We can use that money.

[57:54] We can raise that money for a good cause.

[57:56] And, you know, we were telling Rob, like we'll make more money on that dunk tank than

[58:00] you realize.

[58:01] Like people would love to have a chance at it.

[58:04] I'm ready.

[58:05] I do it.

[58:06] Let's get a dunk tank in there.

[58:09] Nobody makes more fun of me than me.

[58:13] Like we need more self-deprecating humor.

[58:17] So let's see what he says.

[58:19] Yeah, actors like I'd pay 50 bucks.

[58:21] Like, yeah, it'd be great.

[58:23] The Damien face on the bullseye needs, you know, is amazing.

[58:25] And I'm going to wear a shirt that says Marty's shoes.

[58:29] Remember Marty's shoes in the corner?

[58:32] Yeah, that is a problem, right?

[58:38] Isn't next year the Star Wars 50th?

[58:41] Whoops.

[58:42] Well, it's, yeah, I know, I know.

[58:48] Yeah, I don't know, man.

[58:53] It's kind of like a, I think a lot of us, and correct me if I'm right.

[59:02] I think a lot of us are feeling pretty content with the games we have.

[59:09] It doesn't change what is the most enjoyable thing in this hobby, which is the connection

[59:13] we have with each other.

[59:14] Like the friendships we've made, the ability to geek out over this stuff is where the

[59:22] energy in Pimol is.

[59:23] It is meeting your friends out for drinks at, you know, barcades, it's going to shows.

[59:29] The games now are just all over price.

[59:31] Like everybody just knows that.

[59:32] Like this, you know, it's almost like, it's almost just like cliche to complain about

[59:37] Pimol pricing now because everybody knows these games are severely over price.

[59:42] Like they gaslit us, they removed stuff from the games.

[59:44] There's less in these games than there used to be, and they're twice the price.

[59:49] And you know, you're either a sucker that keeps buying them and losing thousands of dollars,

[59:54] or you've, you've woken up to the new reality is like only Niddy advise like new in box

[01:00:00] now right away because like if you just wait by the time the code is done, you'll be able

[01:00:06] to get like a King Kong elite for like $8,500.

[01:00:09] Like it's like some sucker is going to pay 13 plus shipping and maybe taxes.

[01:00:17] And you're going to get one from almost 5,000 off if you wait a year.

[01:00:21] And the game's not going to be done for a year.

[01:00:23] It's like, I don't even understand like the logic to like go in early and like keep playing

[01:00:28] an incomplete game.

[01:00:30] Like even when people talk to me about, dude, I'm like, well, I get it, but I don't know.

[01:00:34] Like, why would they even launch a game so incomplete?

[01:00:40] I think, look, I've said this Brian, I think you made a good buy.

[01:00:45] I think just 50th, when all is said and done, they're going to make less than 1,000 of them.

[01:00:52] I think they're going to be more valuable than the jaws at least in the long run because

[01:00:58] they have the nicer playfields, the sparkle, the nicer ramps and the wires.

[01:01:03] Jaws 50th will be in the end the more desirable game.

[01:01:09] And it also shoots better.

[01:01:11] A little thing they did was they fixed a lot of the mech issues that are on the jaws at

[01:01:17] least.

[01:01:18] People don't realize this, but when Stern makes a game for like two years, they make a lot

[01:01:22] of improvements.

[01:01:23] The final run of the game plays significantly better than the early editions.

[01:01:29] The final runs of Batman 66 play twice as good as the original games.

[01:01:34] Like the SLE plays like crap next to the Catwoman edition.

[01:01:37] So people don't want to like, they don't often discuss that, but it's the truth.

[01:01:42] That when you get a later run of a Stern game, a lot of improvements have happened that

[01:01:49] they don't communicate.

[01:01:51] J.C., I think you made the right move.

[01:01:58] I have a distributor friend that got stuck with 30 GNRs.

[01:02:01] He paid 300 K4 and selling, yeah, he's losing money on everyone.

[01:02:05] Mike has like 80 of them at automated.

[01:02:10] They fixed the air ball issues on the jaws 50th.

[01:02:12] They absolutely fixed it.

[01:02:14] Now that the problem is, it's like, and look.

[01:02:21] I know I made a dig at our, you know, at loser kid for having the promo code to help move

[01:02:30] the funhouse units.

[01:02:31] You know, you guys heard my show last week.

[01:02:35] Because I don't think that a pinball content creator should be helping a distro move product

[01:02:43] like with a discount code.

[01:02:45] It'd be like, it'd be like if you put in Canadian pinball podcasts, you get $500 off

[01:02:51] that automated to move his GNRs.

[01:02:53] I don't think that's really ethical to do that.

[01:02:57] Why would we do that?

[01:03:00] Just take $500 off the game.

[01:03:03] Why does it need to be?

[01:03:04] You know what I'm saying?

[01:03:06] The funny thing about funhouse is nobody wants it.

[01:03:08] They didn't sell any.

[01:03:10] The problem with GNR and funhouse remake, the problem with all of them is the use market

[01:03:16] is still thousands less than these distros are trying to discount them at.

[01:03:21] So it's like, you know, like that's the problem is you can't even like, and what's $500

[01:03:27] off is nothing.

[01:03:28] You should get $3,000 off some of these games.

[01:03:35] I just don't think people's like journalist to integrity should be for sale.

[01:03:42] Like that's just how I feel.

[01:03:44] It's easy for me to say that too because I make the most probably out of any podcast

[01:03:51] or in the content space for pinball.

[01:03:54] People might make more money on YouTube.

[01:03:55] I don't know.

[01:03:56] I don't have a line of sight to people's finances, but it's funny to me because when you don't

[01:04:01] sell out, when you're not a shill, when you don't take money, like special interest money

[01:04:07] from people, you make the most money.

[01:04:10] And I do say that probably about Canadian pinball podcasts is I've never, you know, the only

[01:04:17] thing I ever took once was that trip for Jersey Jack to go look at Avatar.

[01:04:21] But again, I offered to pay for my trip because I went to Stern when I was there and they

[01:04:25] refused to take my money.

[01:04:27] And I didn't like the game.

[01:04:29] I came back and I said to sparaging things about the game.

[01:04:32] I think it's a soulless, beautiful game.

[01:04:34] I still think that way about Avatar.

[01:04:40] Well, is there any different that news networks taking the problem?

[01:04:43] The thing is Josh is this in all media, there's a there's a separation between the ad side

[01:04:49] of the business and the editorial side of the business.

[01:04:52] The moment there it's church and state like editorial editorial content is not supposed

[01:04:58] to be impacted by the advertising side of the business.

[01:05:06] But once you start advertising promo codes to help sell fun houses, right?

[01:05:12] So think about it.

[01:05:13] Just think about it.

[01:05:14] Think about the conflict on that.

[01:05:15] Are you then going to say disparaging things about fun house when your own show is a discount

[01:05:23] for the game to help your and you're getting paid by the distributor to help them move

[01:05:32] their product?

[01:05:34] It's just it's it's a hundred percent of conflict of interest.

[01:05:43] I think Randy Martinez will be on Star Wars.

[01:05:45] He is the Disney Star Wars artist.

[01:05:50] I think I'll do a good job.

[01:05:51] I mean, man, it looks good.

[01:05:52] I don't want I don't want yet on Star Wars.

[01:05:55] It's just not his style.

[01:05:56] I think look, it pains me to say this, but like if Kong look like a rich man, he's like

[01:06:04] original Kong movie posters that were iconic and legendary.

[01:06:09] Kong would have sold twice as well.

[01:06:11] If the entire Kong game was based on the iconic Kong films, it would have sold twice as

[01:06:17] well.

[01:06:19] Jeremy Packer is an amazing artist.

[01:06:22] Jeremy Packer's King Kong looks more like a children's book than the King Kong, the

[01:06:29] world knows and loves.

[01:06:30] It's just the way it is.

[01:06:31] It's just it's a cartoony vibe to it and it's just not Kong.

[01:06:38] I'm sorry.

[01:06:39] I'm allowed that opinion and I love his art and when his art is directed in the right

[01:06:45] theme and it works so well, it's just not Kong.

[01:06:58] But, you know, as I said earlier, I know we have more people now.

[01:07:05] This week, I've made a decision that for the people that don't ever want to like shake

[01:07:15] hands or make amends, like they're just they're off.

[01:07:18] They're not part of Canadian Pimble Podcast page anymore.

[01:07:20] They're not invited to see the content.

[01:07:23] No ill will.

[01:07:24] I wish everybody the best of luck, but they can do their stuff.

[01:07:28] They can have their audiences, but they're not going to be hanging out here and not watching

[01:07:32] my content, not drafting off of my shows.

[01:07:37] You know, wasn't many people really, right?

[01:07:41] Majority people still go along great.

[01:07:43] You know, loser kids still, you know, welcome to be here.

[01:07:47] I enjoy their interviews a lot.

[01:07:48] I really do.

[01:07:49] I don't think they need to do those like flipping out ads.

[01:07:52] I don't.

[01:07:53] I actually like just think they don't need to do it.

[01:07:56] I just don't think they need to do it.

[01:07:58] That's doing great.

[01:07:59] Flipping out is crushing it.

[01:08:00] Gang like Zach and Greg and Nicole and Ken, they put the effort in.

[01:08:08] There's no other way around it.

[01:08:09] A lot of distras and dealers are stuck marketing.

[01:08:13] They don't do enough work to get in front of people and don't do enough content to get

[01:08:20] consumers.

[01:08:21] You put in the work, you get the results.

[01:08:23] It's that simple.

[01:08:24] I have no ill will anymore against any of these people.

[01:08:29] I just think they should just, everyone's got to hustle more than they used to.

[01:08:33] That's the way it works.

[01:08:34] You hustle, you get the business.

[01:08:36] You know, and again, I always said, I said it on my last show.

[01:08:39] I think it's, I think, I think for them, it's smart to get these content creators to,

[01:08:43] to run ads for them in front of their shows.

[01:08:45] I don't think it's smart for the content creators.

[01:08:50] Is everybody's progative though?

[01:08:51] It's all pinbots.

[01:08:52] It's not hurting anybody.

[01:08:53] It's not solving world hungards.

[01:08:58] You know, I'm sure everybody saw the cracker barrel CEO, right?

[01:09:14] Let me get a little bit on the soap box.

[01:09:17] It never ceases to amaze me.

[01:09:19] Even after the Bud Light thing, even after, you know, the continued failure, the failure

[01:09:28] to cancel Sydney, the failure to, the failure by the really extreme progressive movement

[01:09:41] in America to sort of, a few things happening.

[01:09:45] It's this dumbing down of brands, the flattening of society so that the only way to grow your

[01:09:52] business is to change and make it more appealing to audiences and communities that don't like

[01:10:00] your brand.

[01:10:02] You know, and it's, it's not about like, woke, it's more about like, people, you know,

[01:10:09] and like, I'll tell you this, like one of the most painful brands that I've ever worked

[01:10:14] on was like, I'm not even going to say it, like, because I don't want to get in trouble

[01:10:18] and I would get in trouble.

[01:10:19] Like, I sign client confidentialities, but what the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the

[01:10:27] same way to say it is, every brand has its roots, right?

[01:10:32] It has its roots, whether like, it's, it's rooted in a country where it was founded,

[01:10:37] rooted in a founder story.

[01:10:40] And I've never, I've never understood the very reason why people love the brand in the

[01:10:47] first place is because of those things, right?

[01:10:49] It's like, because of those things.

[01:10:52] And then they move away from it.

[01:10:54] They, they want, they, we don't want to be looked at with those cliches.

[01:10:58] And it's the cliches and the stereotypes.

[01:11:00] That's the reason why people love you.

[01:11:03] No, they choose you because of that, because of where you're made, because of the grit

[01:11:09] of the nation you come from or because of the founder who have this point of view.

[01:11:12] And when they, and so like, and I think the problem is, is growth.

[01:11:17] It is, is that some brands have hit peak growth, right?

[01:11:24] So I'll give you an example.

[01:11:26] You, you could, you could sell like, I don't know, like, Russian vodka, right?

[01:11:32] That could be something you sell.

[01:11:34] And you, you've reached this much, this many consumers.

[01:11:37] And you think, well, we need to now get, you know, people in South America to drink

[01:11:42] our brand.

[01:11:43] There's a growth opportunity because nobody there drinks it, right?

[01:11:47] But the reason nobody drinks it is because culturally they don't drink vodka.

[01:11:50] They drink tequila.

[01:11:51] That doesn't matter what you do.

[01:11:53] And you could try to sacrifice everyone who loves your brand, who loves vodka, to try

[01:11:59] to appeal to the people that only want tequila.

[01:12:02] And this is what happens in marketing.

[01:12:04] Is you get this weird sort of like demand always be growing at the sacrifice of who you

[01:12:12] maybe are as a company, as a culture, and as a brand.

[01:12:16] And that's what I deal with on a weekly basis.

[01:12:20] And I will say this primarily in my, you know, in my, in my industry, it is a very,

[01:12:28] very, overly liberal dominated industry, right?

[01:12:33] It is, it is, it is this like very elitist artistic point of view where you would, you

[01:12:41] would be shocked how there is like an almost a, not even like a rejection, but just a deflection

[01:12:51] that there are even people in the world that don't think like them, that voted differently

[01:12:59] than them, that like chicken fried steak, that like McDonald's when it had a pirate ship

[01:13:07] and a ball pit, right?

[01:13:08] They literally think everybody thinks like them.

[01:13:12] And that's what is crazy.

[01:13:14] And I'm very moderate, like I respect everybody.

[01:13:17] Like I think there's some crazy cultural stuff going on and the culture wars.

[01:13:22] What's funny to me is like it's so obvious.

[01:13:25] It's so obvious what way the world wants to go.

[01:13:32] You know what I'm saying?

[01:13:33] 92% of people, this is, these are accurate numbers.

[01:13:37] 92% of people don't believe in woke culture.

[01:13:43] They don't believe in what's happening with kids and how they're pushing this agenda

[01:13:50] out.

[01:13:51] You know, all of a sudden now, all these kids have mental health issues.

[01:13:54] Why?

[01:13:55] Because you've introduced them to these issues.

[01:13:59] You've made them feel like in a period in their lives where they're a little like unsure

[01:14:05] about everything, which is what the natural thing is to be in adolescence.

[01:14:11] You've now introduced them to things that are destroying their psyche, damaging their

[01:14:17] childhood, like removing their ability to have fun.

[01:14:20] It's, and that's progress.

[01:14:24] The annihilation of childhood peace of mind.

[01:14:27] The annihilation of the family unit, the annihilation of anything masculine.

[01:14:32] That's progress.

[01:14:34] No.

[01:14:35] No.

[01:14:36] It's not.

[01:14:39] And the good news is this is most people are moderate.

[01:14:43] Most people are moderate.

[01:14:45] Most people are socially liberal and physically conservative.

[01:14:50] That's what I am.

[01:14:51] If you're not, like if you're like, I don't think any but like then you're going to be unhappy.

[01:14:56] The happiness in life, you need to aim for that for the middle.

[01:15:03] The middle is where peace of mind is.

[01:15:05] It's the line and the in and the in.

[01:15:07] You should and educated people should want to have discourse and understand other people.

[01:15:15] And that's always what kills me in marketing is I often feel like my opinion is immediately

[01:15:21] discarded.

[01:15:23] And my belief system is immediately ignored if I don't immediately come out as being

[01:15:35] like that way.

[01:15:38] And that's just how it is.

[01:15:40] Right?

[01:15:41] And I'm very, I think I'm very smart because I don't, I respect everybody I work with.

[01:15:47] I respect, I don't get into it.

[01:15:49] I sit back and laugh when stuff like cracker barrel happens, you know, stuff like American

[01:15:54] Eagle happens because I just think like here we go again.

[01:15:57] It's like the progressives just can't, they don't know how to win and they don't, and

[01:16:01] they never will win and they don't know how to like, like just pull it back a little

[01:16:05] bit.

[01:16:07] Yeah.

[01:16:08] Yeah, it is the art of common sense.

[01:16:17] So that's, you know, why we end up with cracker barrel.

[01:16:21] And that's why I like to bring it back to Pimble, right?

[01:16:23] To bring a Brack the Pimble.

[01:16:25] And some, I think what's crazy to me is that any Pimble machine would fail.

[01:16:32] You know what I'm saying?

[01:16:35] No way.

[01:16:37] What are those?

[01:16:38] You red Hulk?

[01:16:40] No way, come here, come here.

[01:16:43] Yeah, come here, show everybody, come here, Hulk smash, come here.

[01:16:48] Oh, don't hit the mic though.

[01:16:52] I'll show them.

[01:16:53] Oh, give me a Hulk smash.

[01:16:56] Yeah.

[01:16:57] Smash.

[01:16:58] Yeah, smash.

[01:16:59] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:17:00] Okay, you can play out here, but I'm doing my show, okay?

[01:17:08] He's a boy.

[01:17:09] He's a young boy.

[01:17:12] He's so beautiful.

[01:17:13] Like he's the way his mind works.

[01:17:14] And he's, and you know, and like boys develop different than girls.

[01:17:18] Like it's just crazy to me that I would start talking to him about.

[01:17:21] You know, gender fluidity, you know, I had to throw some books out.

[01:17:26] I mean it, I had to throw some, I didn't tell this to Brenda.

[01:17:29] Like people gave us these books, they're trying to introduce all these complex like, like

[01:17:33] social issues to like children, like throw them all out.

[01:17:39] I know there's bird poop on the ground.

[01:17:41] I'm going to pick it up, but thank you for pointing it out.

[01:17:43] He likes to point out everything wrong.

[01:17:45] He's like his daddy.

[01:17:46] Like what's up?

[01:17:47] What, how are you going to get the books off the floor if it takes the book?

[01:17:53] Well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to get a brush or some soap and clean it like

[01:17:56] that.

[01:17:57] Okay.

[01:17:58] Beautiful day here.

[01:18:00] Geng, we are, look, we are almost at the half hour mark.

[01:18:05] Like the crackerbarrel CEO is going to get fired.

[01:18:07] Like we all know this, right?

[01:18:09] Like it's, the funniest part now is waiting for the CEO to get fired and then to roll

[01:18:14] it all back.

[01:18:17] And I saw the CMO was like, this is the crackerbarrel people asked for.

[01:18:20] We brought it like clearly not, clearly not.

[01:18:29] Look, I think I'm just going to say this, right?

[01:18:34] You know, I mean, I don't.

[01:18:37] I think people are happy.

[01:18:38] No, no, no.

[01:18:39] Oh.

[01:18:44] My final point is this when kids are going through difficult moments in life.

[01:18:51] I wouldn't try to change them.

[01:18:52] Like they're beautiful for who they are.

[01:18:54] They're children, you know, don't try to change them, put thoughts in their heads.

[01:18:57] Like, look at these little messes.

[01:18:59] Like you guys got to see this.

[01:19:00] Like, come here.

[01:19:02] Hold on.

[01:19:03] Okay, hold on, hold on.

[01:19:04] Don't, don't hit the wire because then it's going to, but come here, come here, little guy.

[01:19:28] Cassian.

[01:19:29] Cassian and or.

[01:19:31] The leader of the rebellion.

[01:19:32] You're standing up.

[01:19:35] Oh, we got both of them.

[01:19:37] All right, here.

[01:19:38] Come here.

[01:19:39] You got to bring him in, bring him in.

[01:19:41] Oh, my boy is the future of pinball podcasting is intact.

[01:19:48] All right.

[01:19:49] No, that's okay.

[01:19:50] Like, get them off big.

[01:19:52] They're heavy.

[01:19:53] They're growing up so big.

[01:19:54] It's like little marshmallow man.

[01:19:57] Oh.

[01:20:00] Had them both for a week.

[01:20:02] Oh.

[01:20:03] They're not.

[01:20:04] They're not.

[01:20:05] I just can't.

[01:20:07] Wait, what happened?

[01:20:08] Am I muted?

[01:20:09] Hold on.

[01:20:10] They muted me.

[01:20:12] They muted me.

[01:20:13] They muted me.

[01:20:14] Oh.

[01:20:16] Jack Danger in the house.

[01:20:18] They muted me.

[01:20:20] Look, like, everybody.

[01:20:23] I wish you could see.

[01:20:25] How beautiful it is here in Roed and Connecticut today.

[01:20:28] And I mean, this when I say this, like, good vibes, like, wake up every day above ground.

[01:20:35] And you made it, man.

[01:20:36] You made it.

[01:20:37] Like, we're a rock hurling through space at 10,000 miles an hour.

[01:20:40] Life's too short to hold on to stuff.

[01:20:42] Is it still muted?

[01:20:43] I think it's unmuted now.

[01:20:45] Do they?

[01:20:47] Am I still muted?

[01:20:49] I unmuted the mic.

[01:20:53] I'm back.

[01:20:54] Look, life's too short.

[01:21:44] Both of them.

[01:21:45] Yeah.

[01:21:46] You want to hit me slightly, softly.

[01:21:48] Not hard, not hard.

[01:21:50] Okay.

[01:21:51] All right, guys.

[01:21:55] Uh-oh.

[01:21:58] Uh-oh.

[01:22:01] Uh-oh.

[01:22:03] It looks like someone who ordered a haggis pinball later.
