[00:00] The next story combines two of my favorite things.

[00:02] Football and alcohol.

[00:04] Because Bud Light has announced they will give Cleveland Browns fans free beer

[00:10] if the team wins a game this year.

[00:13] Yeah, I guess.

[00:15] Does they revamp this secondary?

[00:18] Mayfield in the Browns.

[00:20] Get the win over the jazz.

[00:22] Take me down to the paradise.

[00:24] You will be the president of the girls I've put it down.

[00:27] I want you to take me home.

[00:32] Take me down to the paradise.

[00:34] You will be the president of the girls I've put it down.

[00:38] I want you to take me home.

[00:42] You know, I learned early on in my career that the roses and the flowers of life do not

[00:57] bloom very often.

[00:59] But when they do, you have to stop and enjoy them.

[01:04] And last night, probably one of my most favorite marketing campaigns that my team has created

[01:11] came to fruition in that the Cleveland Browns finally won a game in almost two years

[01:19] unlocking the Bud Light refrigerators that we put inside bars in Cleveland.

[01:25] And I can't tell you.

[01:26] I mean, the pinball is fun, guys.

[01:29] Cars are fun.

[01:30] Music is fun.

[01:31] But when you do something in your career that produces something of value, there is no

[01:39] more satisfaction than that.

[01:41] And I know that that happens in the pinball world.

[01:43] That happens in other areas of our lives.

[01:45] But I just want to tell you, I am probably in one of the best moods in my life.

[01:50] And you know, this is what I chase in life.

[01:52] And in my career and in everything in general, is just the feeling that an idea that you

[01:58] come up with is executed in a way that works out so well.

[02:03] And millions of people are excited and talking about that thing.

[02:09] And that's why I love marketing.

[02:10] It's why I love what I do.

[02:12] It's why I love working on big brands like Bud Light because people are enthusiastic about

[02:18] drinking beer.

[02:19] Right?

[02:20] And so I just want to say on this episode of 200 and it's like 63 or 64, are you even

[02:25] counting at this point what podcast number this is?

[02:29] I want to talk about pinball.

[02:31] I want to talk about what I think is going on in the hobby.

[02:36] I also want to do a little bit of reaction to my last podcast where I reflected on pinball

[02:41] machines and on whether or not I feel like pinball is devolving.

[02:46] Right?

[02:47] Some people have sent me emails saying that, you know, Chris, you're devolving as a podcast.

[02:52] You're getting too jaded again.

[02:53] You're getting too negative.

[02:54] You need to understand like it's just pinball.

[02:57] And I get it.

[02:58] I get it, ladies and gentlemen, it is just pinball.

[03:01] But why can't pinball be as good as pinball was?

[03:06] That is just the very basic question that I want to know is can't we make games today

[03:14] that are as good as the old games?

[03:17] And why isn't that possible?

[03:19] I think one of the things that confuses me a lot is it's pretty much the same damn people

[03:24] making the games that made it back then.

[03:26] And I think I came to a conclusion and I want to share my conclusion with you today.

[03:35] Okay?

[03:36] And here is what I was thinking about because I listened to my last podcast and I came

[03:40] away thinking, you know, maybe I was a bit too harsh on Stern and maybe I was a bit too

[03:45] unrealistic of what I expect from them and other pinball companies in 2018.

[03:51] But I'm not really sure that's the case.

[03:53] But here's what I think.

[03:55] Here's what I think.

[03:56] I came to this conclusion that it might be impossible to make a Valley Williams kind

[04:04] of game today with all of the great themes, the great engineering, the great mechanisms,

[04:11] the great code, the great light shows, everything that made Valley Williams games so special and

[04:19] stand so far above everyone else's pinball efforts of the time.

[04:24] Are we ever going to see a company that who's leading the pinball industry but also making

[04:30] the greatest games in pinball?

[04:32] And we're not there right now.

[04:34] And here's what I think happened and we talked a little bit about this.

[04:37] It's Stern survived the complete collapse of the pinball industry and they did whatever

[04:43] it took to get through to the future and you have to give them credit for that.

[04:48] Now my question is this.

[04:50] My question is this, is it possible for Stern to make games at the volume and cadence they

[04:59] do and also make games as good as Valley Williams games were?

[05:06] Is it possible for Stern to do that because they don't sell 10, 12, 15,000 units of those

[05:16] games?

[05:17] So when Valley Williams was making those games and selling them for $2,000 to $4,000, they

[05:24] were selling 10,000 a pop, 12,000 a pop, 15,000 a pop, 20,000 items families.

[05:33] If you sell 20,000 items families and you have pre-orders up the wazoo by operators and

[05:39] distributors and whatnot, how can you make a game as good as Adam's family if you're

[05:45] making the monsters?

[05:46] Now the other side of the argument is this, those games were also 2 to 3,000 dollars.

[05:53] So should in Stern be able to make games that good if they're charging $9,000?

[06:01] Now the answer is yes but here's the problem.

[06:04] Here is the problem.

[06:05] Is that Stern makes games that are not $9,000?

[06:11] The Stern game that we all buy is roughly around $5,000.

[06:17] Now if you look at inflation, if you look at inflation that's pretty much where games

[06:22] were in the mid-90s.

[06:24] So Stern has really charged more for pinball.

[06:28] The games are definitely not as good.

[06:31] A Stern pro is nowhere near what you got in a Valley Williams game.

[06:35] But for the most part, Stern is still just making $5,000 machines.

[06:40] And people who are paying $7,500 for the premiums are kind of getting ripped off.

[06:46] And people who are paying $9,000 for the L.E.s are absolutely getting ripped off.

[06:52] I mean it is kind of comical that a Stern L.E. is almost twice the price of the pro and

[07:00] look at what the differences are now in these games.

[07:03] So the question that I'm asking is let's tackle this from a few angles.

[07:08] Do we think Stern is capable of making games as good as Valley Williams?

[07:12] Well the answer is I don't think so.

[07:15] They've never made a game that has been as good as a Valley Williams game.

[07:20] They've never given you the same kind of quality world under glass, incredible kind of machine

[07:26] that we got.

[07:27] Like if you put mini-del madness, you put attack from Mars, you put Twilight Zone, you

[07:35] put Whitewater, you put Fun House.

[07:38] You just line up Dells and the Arabian Knights and it keeps going.

[07:42] Theater of Magic, all the Pompadue titles, Valley Williams titles.

[07:46] If you put those games next to all of the Stern games we've received in the last 20 years,

[07:53] it's still comical how much better they are.

[07:56] So Stern is a company.

[07:58] You could ask this question, can they actually create a game that good?

[08:03] That is that amazing.

[08:05] Now look, this is where we get into the subjective land of like well, Stern games are fun, people

[08:11] are enjoying them and they're having fun with their pinball experiences.

[08:13] I'm not saying they're not, but I'm saying the games themselves, Stern's approach to

[08:19] creating a fun pinball experience has a lot more to do with things that are physically

[08:25] a lot cheaper to make.

[08:26] So by that, I mean they're going with the coding and they're going with the theme and

[08:32] they're going with the artwork as the main drivers of their pinball experience and it's

[08:39] smart for them for a business standpoint to do that because those things as we've said

[08:45] are much more reliable.

[08:46] They don't break.

[08:48] Stern doesn't want to have to constantly be fixing games and pinball machines break a

[08:54] lot.

[08:55] Now, Valley Williams games, the quality was really good.

[08:58] For the most part, especially if you put those games in a home use only environment, they

[09:03] survived because they were built like tanks to take the abuse of an arcade.

[09:08] So of course they would survive for years if they ended up in someone's living room or

[09:12] game room.

[09:13] Okay, so the question there, I don't think Stern has the ability to make a game as good

[09:19] as Valley Williams.

[09:20] Now here's what got me very excited about the pinball hobby over the last three to four

[09:25] years.

[09:27] Is that the boutique companies that came in and saw what Stern was doing and saw the

[09:32] money Stern was making.

[09:34] They came in with the desire to make games as good as Valley Williams.

[09:39] And I think some of them were getting very, very close, right?

[09:43] Let's talk about who I think.

[09:45] Still, to this day, I think the one game that reminds me of a Valley Williams game, the

[09:53] one game that I think is the greatest theme interpretation has the most fun toys, gives

[10:02] everybody what they want.

[10:04] Just sort of, I think this is the modern day, Valley Williams game.

[10:11] That game is the big Lebowski.

[10:14] I still have a heart on for that game.

[10:18] It makes my heart on so limp when I think about the two wet noodles that ran that company

[10:25] so piss poorly from a business standpoint, but they made the best fucking game I've seen

[10:32] in pinball in the last five to ten years without a doubt.

[10:38] If I could have one pinball machine in this apartment that would be reliable, have customer

[10:44] service, it is a big Lebowski.

[10:47] And where they fucked up is they made the Valley Williams game.

[10:52] They made the game that I think a lot of people wanted.

[10:56] If Dutch pinball had said we're going to make just 500 of these and each one, and I'm

[11:02] not even fucking with you here, if each one, they could have said each one is $15,000,

[11:10] okay?

[11:11] Only making 500, they would have sold every single one.

[11:17] They would have made a few million dollars and been on to game number two back to the

[11:22] future.

[11:24] And I don't for the life of me understand why they priced that game out of business.

[11:32] Same thing on title number two, which gets as close as possible to the Valley Williams

[11:39] error and that is the Wizard of Oz.

[11:42] There is no denying that this machine is an impressive feat.

[11:49] There is so much in it, it is a unique design.

[11:53] It brings the theme integration to life in a really amazing way.

[11:57] It is, you know, look, I'll say this about the Wizard of Oz.

[12:02] My only issues with it are the layout.

[12:05] It's a kind of quirky layout.

[12:07] I hate the left out lane.

[12:09] I hate the way the ball drains.

[12:10] They are so easily just to get to that, you know, was it that save shot that you can get

[12:15] the toto or whatever?

[12:17] I forget, you know, it's got the hot air balloon there.

[12:20] I hate that design there.

[12:23] But I can't deny the fact that the Wizard of Oz has two fucking upper play fields.

[12:30] Has, you know, these amazing pop bumper trees has the monkey comes and grabs the ball with

[12:35] the mag of them, which comes up from underneath the play field.

[12:38] I mean, look at all this stuff going on in the Wizard of fucking Oz.

[12:42] And then tell me what's going on in Iron Maiden.

[12:45] Tell me what's going on in Deadpool.

[12:47] I mean, it's comical.

[12:48] And which comical is Jack Price himself out of business with Wizard of Oz, right?

[12:53] He made the game and he asked $6,500 for I think what is one of the most gorgeous and

[13:00] everything and the kitchen sink is inside it.

[13:03] And the wood apron, can we talk about that wood apron?

[13:06] I mean, Jack went the extra mile to make this game his sort of like his opus.

[13:13] Like this is the, you know, the first track from Jersey Jack Pinball and he prices it at

[13:19] $6,500 and he goes at a business because the cost to make each game was pretty much

[13:24] what he was charging.

[13:25] Now, if you look at Wizard of Oz today, if Jack launched Wizard of Oz, two days, he

[13:30] said, this game is $10,000.

[13:33] I don't think anyone would say anything.

[13:35] I think they would hand over their money.

[13:37] I think he sold 4,000 of them for a reason because it's a fucking, it's a lot for your

[13:43] money.

[13:45] You know, not exactly the theme pinball people are in love with, but it's a lot for your

[13:51] money.

[13:52] But here's the thing.

[13:53] So you've got, you got, so, so Dutch pinball at a business, the company that's making

[13:58] I think the closest to Valley Williams, Jersey Jack Pinball, the second company making

[14:03] games closest to the Valley Williams error, what happens to them?

[14:07] They go out of business, not once, not twice, three times Jersey Jack Pinball ran out of

[14:12] money.

[14:13] There should be no Jersey Jack Pinball today, all right?

[14:17] If he did not get bailed out, the company would be gone, all right?

[14:22] So they would be gone.

[14:23] The same way Dutch pinball is gone, the same way highway pinball is gone, all right?

[14:30] So literally, literally, if, you know, I don't think American pinball's made money on who

[14:36] Danny will talk a little bit about them in a second, but imagine this scenario, people,

[14:41] imagine if sometime around 2016, 2015, Jersey Jack Pinball goes out of business and everyone

[14:49] who had money in on the hobbit lost their money and that company goes under that is what

[14:56] the natural laws of economics would have, would have suggested be the outcome if Jack didn't

[15:04] get a bailout.

[15:05] Now look, it's business, you get investors, you do get financial help, but I don't believe

[15:09] that Jersey Jack Pinball has ever turned a profit in six, what, seven years they've never

[15:16] made money.

[15:17] All right.

[15:18] And by that, I mean the company, you can't just look at, I think was probably after 4,000

[15:24] being sold is profitable.

[15:25] I highly doubt, doubt dialed in with so few sold is profitable.

[15:30] I highly doubt the hobbit was profitable for all the money Jack spent on the license and

[15:35] all the parts they ordered and the amount of games they sold and it sucks because they

[15:39] were trying to make pinball something more, right?

[15:43] They were trying to top what Bally Williams was doing, but they went out of business, right?

[15:50] Who else went out of business?

[15:51] Skit D, out of business.

[15:54] Another startup boutique out of business was that that Vani guy out of business, I even

[15:59] forget what title it was.

[16:00] I mean, it's just, the list goes on and on and on of how bad Zidware Pinball out of business,

[16:09] right?

[16:10] It's gone and on of everyone who's tried to make a pinball game that has been as good

[16:16] as Bally Williams has gone out of business, right?

[16:21] It would be so sad to me if this hobby, today, was just spooky and stern.

[16:27] I mean, how depressing does that sound?

[16:31] You know, the whole thing is pinball as an industry, it should have gone out of business.

[16:39] It is seeing a resurgence and it is seeing a regrowth, I think, for a few reasons.

[16:44] I think the number one reason is this.

[16:47] I think there is an absolute pushback on the digital world.

[16:52] I do.

[16:53] I see it everywhere.

[16:54] I don't just see it in toys and pinball and in video games.

[16:59] I think people are tired of the anti-social nature of the digital world where people are

[17:06] just staring at their fucking cell phones all day long.

[17:10] I think social media is a goddamn dumpster.

[17:14] It's a ginormous trash can of this, like, look at me culture, look at me who does nothing,

[17:22] like, look at my fucking this, that, that, it's, I mean, it's all it is and everyone's

[17:26] a fucking hater.

[17:28] You know, and I think there's a pushback and I think there's a desire to get back to

[17:32] the analog world and pinball is the goddamn greatest analog game of all time.

[17:41] There's never been a game.

[17:43] There's never been a toy.

[17:44] There's never been a thing in the arcade that quite like pinball, right?

[17:48] And I think the analog nature of it, the unpredictability of the game is what makes pinball

[17:55] so fucking magical.

[17:58] It's why you love it.

[18:00] It's why I love it.

[18:01] I mean, as much as we say, it's still the same game and games get old.

[18:05] Yes and no.

[18:07] The game will always play different.

[18:10] Every single time you play it.

[18:12] Go play Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade.

[18:15] Go play Donkey Kong.

[18:17] The, that is the same fucking game every time you play it.

[18:22] All right?

[18:23] Game doesn't get old because the game plays different every time.

[18:28] You might get bored of like the modes.

[18:30] And that is why I think it's absolutely stupid.

[18:33] Someone said this and I forget where.

[18:35] When you have a hit game with a hit layout and a hit, you know, hit mechanisms, why don't

[18:41] they just update the code once a year to a whole new adventure within that world?

[18:47] Someone's already spent all that money and you could simply just add more, add more objectives,

[18:54] add more side missions, make that and make that code.

[18:58] Make people for it.

[18:59] A few hundred bucks just so you can pay for the money to R&D that code.

[19:04] That is what the video game industry does.

[19:06] It's so stupid.

[19:08] This is all you need it to do.

[19:09] So I think Jerry tried to do too much.

[19:11] I don't want to be swapping out play fields.

[19:13] I don't want to be swapping out like mechanisms.

[19:16] I don't want to have to like put a fucking play field under my bed.

[19:20] No.

[19:21] I just want to stick a USB stick into my game and have a new game.

[19:27] What's on top of the universe that I love that I'm never going to get old of, right?

[19:32] Or sick of or tired of?

[19:34] All right.

[19:35] So Jersey Jack added business.

[19:37] Everyone else out of business.

[19:39] A terrifying world in which just spooky and stern exist.

[19:42] And so the conclusion I came to though is because if you realize why all these companies

[19:48] went out of business, it's because they ran out of money.

[19:51] I mean, it's that simple.

[19:53] So that making Pimball and trying to make a great game while selling your machine, while

[20:00] finding distributors, while finding buyers, it's really hard.

[20:05] And here's the mistake I think everybody made.

[20:07] I think the Pimball hobby and I think the boutique guys were all business morons because

[20:15] I think they all priced their games too low.

[20:18] And I think they all felt the same pressure that I think drives Charlie Emory.

[20:24] And I think it drives some of these guys that they act like they want to make games priced

[20:29] at a point that so that it's obtainable to people, to broaden the Pimball hobby, right?

[20:37] To like expand Pimball in the world.

[20:39] And that's why I think it's the dumbest fucking thing for boutique manufacturers to be boutique

[20:46] and low end.

[20:48] Like if you're boutique and you're selling at $6,000, $7,000, you're selling low end Pimball

[20:54] machines.

[20:55] And if you want to make a boutique Pimball company profitable and you want to make it work,

[21:02] you've got to go for more high end, exclusive experience.

[21:10] So you've and look, Chuck is doing that with exclusivity, but the games aren't there.

[21:15] He's making like mediocre games and he's limiting them to a certain number.

[21:21] But without that limited number, no one's really buying.

[21:24] But it's weird because he's making like like limited edition games that almost don't like

[21:32] why like that?

[21:33] It's just like I don't think he understands that like what he's trying to actually do,

[21:37] right?

[21:38] I mean, it's it doesn't make sense to me like why would you buy one when you can get

[21:42] a Stern Pro?

[21:43] That is better.

[21:44] That has better design.

[21:45] That has a better theme.

[21:46] That has better almost better everything.

[21:49] Like why other than to support the new guy?

[21:52] But here's the thing, Chuck and I've said this to everyone and it's not just Chuck.

[21:57] Chuck, you're making games for home collectors.

[22:01] Home collectors are rich.

[22:03] They have money.

[22:04] I'm sorry, but there are so many multi-millionaires in this hobby.

[22:09] It's laughable.

[22:10] But that these boutique guys came in and wanted to price it at a certain price point because

[22:17] they almost felt guilty pricing it where they needed to price it to stay in business,

[22:23] right?

[22:24] Stern has a ginormous overhead cost.

[22:28] They need to do what they do.

[22:30] They need to ship their games without complete code.

[22:32] They need to get the hot themes.

[22:33] They need to they need to entice you just enough to buy and get you frenzy about every new

[22:39] launch.

[22:40] You need to do all that to stay in business.

[22:44] Stern Pimbal cannot make games like Jersey Jack Pimbal and release them at the cadence

[22:51] they do.

[22:52] They could not get the price point where they wanted to be and they could not stay in business

[22:58] if they tried to do what Jersey Jack did.

[23:01] I think that to me is ultimately why I'm frustrated at times in this hobby is because I think

[23:08] this hobby is nothing but an endless compromise.

[23:12] Why can't we get a company to make a Valley Williams kind of game and that stays in

[23:19] fucking business and I don't care what you price it at.

[23:23] Charge me whatever I just want you to succeed in getting your product to market.

[23:29] The Big Lebowski is a proof point of that.

[23:33] Highway Pimbal.

[23:34] I don't know.

[23:35] I don't even talk about them but I think those games were just they weren't going to

[23:40] make it.

[23:41] They weren't going to make it.

[23:43] American Pimbal to me and Deeproot.

[23:46] Those are the two that I'm looking at.

[23:48] If you were to ask me because the others are gone.

[23:50] I mean who are you looking at?

[23:52] Like I'm tired of looking at Jersey Jack because Jack doesn't get it.

[23:57] He just why would I think Jack will now figure it out.

[24:01] He's had seven years to figure out how to do this and make it fire on all cylinders.

[24:07] It's always a compromise with them.

[24:10] You can't tell me that Pirates of the Caribbean in 2018 doesn't feel like a complete compromise

[24:14] title.

[24:15] Nobody wants to theme.

[24:18] They compromised on the mechanisms.

[24:21] They fucked up the launch.

[24:22] They made people wait a year.

[24:24] There's absolutely zero hype for that game right now.

[24:27] Zero.

[24:28] Okay.

[24:29] And yeah, I get it.

[24:30] People are going to finally get them when in October.

[24:34] They fucked it all up.

[24:35] They showed the game a year ago.

[24:37] This has been one of the, like we wanted this company to be more efficient by now.

[24:44] The two companies that I'm looking at with expectations, with hope and with faith are

[24:51] American Pimbal and Deeproot.

[24:54] Now you might be saying Chris what the fuck Deeproot?

[24:56] What are they?

[24:57] What are they?

[24:58] The reason why I am looking at Deeproot with faith and hope is because all I know now is

[25:08] that they have a team.

[25:09] They've been quiet.

[25:11] They have people who know what they're doing in Pimbal and they're, they're going to have

[25:18] to deliver.

[25:19] Right.

[25:20] I mean, it's, it's that simple.

[25:21] I mean, they, they said T.P.F. we're going to start to see the five days of Deeproot.

[25:27] I like that they haven't taken anyone's money.

[25:30] I like that they haven't, you know, said here's a game and you can have it a year from now.

[25:36] And also like, look, I mean, this is the reality of all new Pimbal companies.

[25:41] You know, yeah, we always will give them the benefit of the doubt.

[25:44] The other thing I like about Deeproot is this.

[25:46] The majority of Robert Mueller's collection are Valley Williams games.

[25:51] He is not shy about saying those are his favorite games.

[25:55] That is what he's on a mission to do is get us back to an error where Pimbal was a world

[26:01] under glass and magical things happened with the Pimbal.

[26:06] I love that they put the Ghostbusters game on the wall and said here's what we're not going

[26:12] to do.

[26:13] All right.

[26:14] Make a game with a ton of shots.

[26:15] They're all frustrating.

[26:16] That is a complete terrible design.

[26:19] And then rune, rune, Ghostbusters Pimbal forever.

[26:24] And that's what sucks.

[26:25] Like, Star Wars.

[26:26] Fuck.

[26:27] Now we're not going to get a good Star Wars pin.

[26:29] Like, for every, you know, Stern stole the Star Wars license basically.

[26:33] I mean, it was not like law, they didn't rob it, but they took it away from Jersey Jack

[26:40] Pimbal.

[26:41] They did everything to get it from Jersey Jack.

[26:43] Who would you rather have had make Star Wars?

[26:47] Stern or Jersey Jack Pimbal?

[26:49] And that's the truth.

[26:51] That's the little thing like nobody wants to tell their friends who work at Stern.

[26:55] Is that, of course, everybody would love to see their favorite theme get the Jersey Jack

[27:01] treatment over the Stern treatment.

[27:05] But chances are Jack would probably go into business ten times over trying to figure

[27:10] out how to make that game and make it profitable.

[27:13] You know, it's just that simple.

[27:15] And then I saw, it's okay.

[27:17] So I've got deeper.

[27:18] And then American Pimbal.

[27:19] Look, I'm hard on October fest.

[27:21] I'm hard on these guys because I care.

[27:23] I mean, you know, it's like, it's tough love.

[27:25] I, because I do think that American Pimbal cares a lot.

[27:30] I think they care a lot about putting a lot into their games.

[27:34] I think they put a lot into Houdini.

[27:37] I think the game had to be rushed because of the situation John put them in.

[27:43] And I think they are going to learn from their mistakes on Houdini.

[27:49] And I think October fest is going to shoot very well.

[27:54] I think the theme is still going to be the challenge.

[27:57] I think if they make it work, if they make it work, and there's a lot of fun stuff in

[28:02] the game.

[28:03] And from what I've seen with the ramps and the little teaser shot, where he looks like

[28:06] there's more going on there than Deadpool.

[28:09] If Josh Kugler can make the screen not look like, you know, it's clip art from 1993,

[28:16] Josh, I'm talking to you, bro.

[28:17] I know you listen to the show.

[28:19] I know you ignore my emails now.

[28:21] It's not personal, bro.

[28:22] It's not personal, but the game's got to look better.

[28:25] It's got to look better.

[28:26] And here's the other thing.

[28:27] And I told this to Josh Kugler.

[28:28] I told this to Scott Goldstein guy that had doing their marketing.

[28:33] I told this to double.

[28:34] You guys need to learn.

[28:36] You need to make Ellie versions of your games.

[28:39] What is this like one version that we make forever?

[28:41] That is the dumbest way to market Pimbal in 2018.

[28:46] They're selling to people who want limited versions of things.

[28:49] They want to collectible.

[28:50] It's absolutely ignorant and marketing stupidity to not offer a version of your game that

[28:58] is limited unless the game is limited.

[29:02] Like Charlie doesn't need to do Alice Cooper, Ellie's if he's only making 500.

[29:06] But if you're making anything more than 500, you need a variation of that game that

[29:10] is extra special, that charges more, that makes the home collector want it.

[29:14] Because when you don't and you say we're just making unlimited amounts of October fest,

[29:19] you know what happens?

[29:20] There's no urgency to buy people wait.

[29:22] They don't care.

[29:23] And by the time they think about it, five new games have come out with limited edition

[29:27] promises that will make them have the fear of missing out and you'll lose out on those

[29:32] sales.

[29:33] It's just that simple.

[29:35] I know what I'm talking about with marketing people.

[29:37] Maybe now.

[29:38] Maybe Bonnie Tyler, the Bud Light fridge is what we do for living.

[29:42] How we create a good story, how we create excitement, how we get people to buy products.

[29:47] I think I know what I'm talking about.

[29:50] Sterney is a genius at this.

[29:52] Stern marketing department knows exactly what they're doing and it works every time.

[29:58] It's going to work with monsters.

[29:59] It's going to work with beetles because they understand if we just make one less than people

[30:05] want.

[30:06] We're okay.

[30:07] And look, sometimes they get the number wrong.

[30:10] Red pool Ellie still not sold out.

[30:13] There aren't 500 people that really want a Deadpool Ellie and I don't think it will.

[30:18] It may eventually sell out.

[30:20] But whenever Stern Ellie doesn't immediately sell out, I consider that a failure.

[30:24] I consider that a marketing flop.

[30:27] I bet there's still there's still Erosmith Ellie's for sale.

[30:30] Same will be true of Deadpool.

[30:33] It just won't be that hard to get.

[30:38] It's just the game.

[30:39] It's just going to go down as one of those.

[30:41] I think the middle tier for Stern is not one of the juggernauts ironically because he's

[30:45] in the game.

[30:46] All right.

[30:47] So that's my point.

[30:49] I'm tired of the compromises.

[30:52] I want us to get to a place where we can have Sterns.

[30:55] Sterns are fine.

[30:56] A Stern is a Stern is a Stern.

[30:58] It's like a Honda.

[30:59] A Honda is a Honda.

[31:00] Every once in a while, Honda will give you the Type R Civic and it's really awesome.

[31:05] And people who have them think they're the best cars ever.

[31:08] Like people who have Sterns who think Sterns are the best pinball machines ever, you're

[31:11] kind of like, yeah, okay, but maybe not.

[31:16] Like take a look at these cars.

[31:18] Take a look at these pins.

[31:20] And when you spend more time on those old pins, it's impossible not to come away and be like,

[31:24] yeah, you're right.

[31:25] This stuff's fucking amazing.

[31:28] A Stern is a Stern is a Stern.

[31:29] They've got the formula down the stay in business and make money and I'm happy for them.

[31:34] I'm happy that Stern exists.

[31:36] Without them, there'd be nobody.

[31:38] Nobody.

[31:39] But what I'm not happy with are these boutique companies that continue to fuck it up by pricing

[31:45] themselves out of business.

[31:47] It's like they feel guilty taking money from these rich guys who have money to burn.

[31:52] I mean, I know some of these men personally.

[31:55] Let me tell you something.

[31:56] A $15,000 pinball machine to these guys means nothing.

[32:01] It might mean a lot to some of the vocal members on PINSIDE.

[32:05] But if you follow your marketing advice by what the PINSIDE people say, you're also a

[32:09] fucking idiot.

[32:11] PINSIDE, those people, for the most part, they're going to buy your stuff regardless.

[32:18] Anyone who goes on a forum like that all day long and obsessively talks about pinball

[32:23] is a fucking addict.

[32:26] That site has turned into such shit.

[32:28] I'm like, literally.

[32:31] It's not even enjoyable anymore.

[32:32] I mean, I tell this to my friends in the podcasting world.

[32:35] I'm like, it used to be fun.

[32:37] They're like, browse through PINSIDE and see what's going on.

[32:41] It's like so fucking boring.

[32:42] Now, now, you know where the excitement in PINBALL is?

[32:45] You know where the exciting content lives?

[32:48] It's in the podcast world.

[32:50] There's so many great PINBALL podcasts.

[32:52] There's so many great PINBALL YouTube channels.

[32:55] There's so much good PINBALL on stream.

[32:57] I love it, man.

[32:58] The personality is of PINBALL.

[33:00] And there's a lot of us.

[33:01] We've fragmented it into our own channels, in our own mediums.

[33:06] And I think we're delivering the most enjoyable places to go find out what's going on in PINBALL.

[33:11] And I think the people on the forum are the guys sitting behind the computer, getting

[33:18] their waistlines are expanding more than Jersey Jack White bodies.

[33:21] And they're just angry and bitter and arguing with each other.

[33:25] They look so stupid.

[33:27] I mean, how fucking creepy is it when you go into the October Fest thread and see these

[33:33] dudes posting pictures of women with their cleavage and beer and hand.

[33:38] I get it.

[33:39] But have you ever seen these dudes at a show?

[33:43] These dudes have never ever been around a woman like that.

[33:46] And it's just so fucking creepy.

[33:48] It's like when you go to those chiller theaters and these little guys are sweating, talking

[33:56] to playmates who were playmates like 20 years ago and they're like, I used to watch.

[34:00] It's like, oh my fucking god, stop with the creepiness.

[34:03] Anyway, here's why I'm excited for PINBALL 2019.

[34:08] I'm excited to see what American PINBALL does.

[34:10] I'm excited to see what Deeproot does.

[34:13] I'm excited for the monsters, which is going to have a lower play field, which is really

[34:17] cool.

[34:18] Stern's going to, you know, it's probably just a risk in a ACDC.

[34:20] But anyway, no, they're going to have a lower play field.

[34:22] I think that's really awesome.

[34:24] I'm really excited to see Franchise artwork on the monsters.

[34:28] I'm excited to see the Beatles.

[34:29] I'm excited, you know, for everything after Pirates of the Caribbean.

[34:33] I want to see Willie Wonka.

[34:34] Here's the thing.

[34:35] If Eric is designing Willie Wonka, it's not next because he's just started designing the

[34:39] next game in April, which means I still think that Pat Lawler's Toy Story is next.

[34:45] I think that Jersey Jack himself planted the rumor that Wonka was going to be next.

[34:51] And I think he's going to try and pull one on us and slot Toy Story back.

[34:57] Because I think he wants everyone to not talk about Toy Story and then deliver a Pat Lawler

[35:02] Toy Story.

[35:04] You heard it here first.

[35:06] Toy Story is next.

[35:07] It's not Guns and Roses.

[35:09] It's going to be Toy Story.

[35:10] I think Wonka is a ways off.

[35:12] And I think Jersey Jack needs a standard body Toy Story game.

[35:18] I will send you a check for $12,500 for the collector's edition of Toy Story.

[35:25] Because it is my favorite movie.

[35:27] It is one of the best franchises ever.

[35:29] And it's the perfect theme for Pimball.

[35:31] Take my money now, Jack.

[35:33] Will you take it?

[35:34] Will you?

[35:35] I don't want to play Pirates of the Caribbean.

[35:37] I don't want to figure out how to like decode Keith's coding.

[35:42] I don't.

[35:43] I'm tired.

[35:44] I don't want 250 inserts.

[35:47] Give me simple Pimball fun with a world under glass and magic.

[35:53] And don't make people compromise.

[35:55] All right, everyone.

[35:56] Have a great Friday.

[35:58] Go get a butt late.

[35:59] Celebrate.

[36:00] Drink beer.

[36:01] Play Pimball.

[36:02] But exercise.

[36:03] Trust me.

[36:05] You'll feel better.

[36:06] And hey, we're coming up to the point where like the Twippies are upon us this fall.

[36:12] And I heard from somebody that Pimball podcasts, they don't matter when it comes to Twippy

[36:18] winning until November.

[36:21] I heard that from somebody.

[36:23] And that only if you do good shows in November, will you win a Twippy?

[36:28] So look, that's why I'm giving you guys all these shitty shows right now because you know

[36:32] this show.

[36:33] It's terrible.

[36:34] And even though we're the only one who have won a Twippy, we're going to, we're probably

[36:41] going to keep the fall shows pretty shitty until November.

[36:44] And then I'm going to get really good again.

[36:46] Then I'm going to get George Gomez back and Gary Stern and Jersey Jack on.

[36:52] And we'll just do interviews for hours and hours and hours.

[36:55] And we'll win the Twippy again.

[36:56] Now it doesn't mean anything.

[36:58] You know what means something to me that you guys listen.

[37:03] Out of all the Pimball podcasts out there, I do think I have the most sort of loyal listener

[37:09] base.

[37:10] And I can tell that because I kind of get like the same number of listens all the time.

[37:13] I don't care that when those guys listen to me once, I don't because I do an interview

[37:17] with someone and then I get like a lot more listens and then you know they trail off.

[37:22] I don't really care.

[37:23] I love my little corner of the Pimball universe.

[37:27] I love that you guys who listen to me on a weekly basis, you enjoy this format in Pimball.

[37:34] This is how I like to think about Pimball.

[37:36] I hope this is how you feel about Pimball.

[37:39] But even if you don't feel this way, I'm glad you listen to the show.

[37:42] And again, as I said, I think the best Pimball content is happening by guys like Zach and

[37:47] Greg.

[37:48] It's happening.

[37:49] I love their show now.

[37:50] Have you seen it?

[37:51] Now they've done more to make it entertaining.

[37:53] And I saw people on Pinside complaining that these dudes made their show more entertaining.

[38:00] I mean for fuck's sakes, can these fucking winos just leave?

[38:05] Their show is fucking awesome.

[38:07] And you've got these fucking losers who are complaining that they take extra time to put

[38:13] more into their show.

[38:15] And they're complaining that just get right to the Pimball.

[38:18] Just get right to the Pimball.

[38:19] Hey man, there are plenty of guys who just talk only about the Pimball and it's fucking

[38:23] barn man.

[38:24] Don't make me bring back Tony Montagna.

[38:27] Okay, you want me to watch a Twitch stream for three hours so I can see a fucking

[38:34] disco ball?

[38:37] Fuck you losers.

[38:38] Okay guys, have a great Friday.

[38:40] I'll talk to you soon.
