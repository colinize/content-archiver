[00:00] Good morning people.

[00:17] I know I'm a little bit late getting this interview with JJ up, but I wanted to just

[00:22] wait and see if there was any Star Wars news.

[00:26] I also got distracted by the Dodge Demon reveal yesterday.

[00:32] Kind of cringe worthy reveal with all the marketing people reading off the teleprompters,

[00:37] but the car itself zero to sixty and two point three seconds, a hundred miles an hour and

[00:43] five point one seconds, a hundred and forty in the quarter mile.

[00:46] You don't care, but it's the fastest production car of all time and I'm trying to get one.

[00:51] Other than that, what's going on in Pimball before I air this interview with JJ, which

[00:55] I think is incredible.

[00:56] I'll go into that a little bit, but some news items.

[01:00] A lot of back and forth about total annihilation being made by spooky.

[01:05] Scott's an awesome dude.

[01:06] I love how there's a lot of people on the sidelines trying to give suggestions about how

[01:10] to make the game better.

[01:12] Game is freaking cool.

[01:13] Just need some cool artwork and get it out.

[01:15] I also think people are out of their minds if they think that game is going to be cheaper

[01:19] than six thousand dollars.

[01:21] People have no idea.

[01:22] People really do have no idea how to make a Pimball machine profitable.

[01:28] I just don't understand why people want these companies to go out of business.

[01:33] If you think anyone can compete with Stern Pro prices, you're out of your mind.

[01:40] You're out of your mind.

[01:41] I don't think Charlie or anyone out there can make a really amazing game for six thousand

[01:47] dollars or less.

[01:48] It's not possible.

[01:49] It's a good luck trying, but it won't happen.

[01:53] My advice to Charlie make a hundred total annihilations.

[01:58] Charge 7,000, 8,000 for them and they will sell out there that cool.

[02:04] Don't mess around with trying to appease the pin-side cry babies.

[02:08] I'm tired of these guys who act like everything needs to be affordable for them.

[02:13] There are so many people that if you just gave them total annihilation with beautiful

[02:19] artwork for seven, eight thousand, they buy it because there's only going to be a hundred

[02:23] of them and they're freaking fun and it reminds people what Pimball used to be.

[02:28] But they won't take my advice because nobody listens to the guy who actually does marketing

[02:32] for a living and nobody looks at market research when they do anything with Pimball.

[02:37] It boggles my mind.

[02:38] Everyone thinks that they have this gut instinct and I watch these companies struggle to really

[02:45] do things properly.

[02:46] All right, what else is going on?

[02:48] Andrew highway has responded.

[02:51] Finally, he always does these sort of like two week, two week hiatuses where it doesn't

[02:59] really say much and then he chimes in and there's two issues.

[03:03] We brought up the PDI glass issue.

[03:05] He came into that thread and said something along the lines of we don't use PDI glass.

[03:11] Just trademarked by the US by Pimball decals but we use Romans glass in our machines.

[03:18] I'm confused still.

[03:20] I don't understand what that means is the is Romans non reflective glass different than

[03:26] the PDI glass that Pimball decals sells and why did Roman come in and not just clarify

[03:33] that for people.

[03:34] I don't really have any more sense of I know what's going on there but who cares about

[03:42] alien glass.

[03:43] What people really care about at this point is their alien Pimball machines and you guys

[03:48] heard my bet in my previous podcast where I will give $100 to the alien Ellie owner number

[03:58] one if they get their pen by the time alien covenant ships on May 19th.

[04:04] I bet I could bump that up even higher because when I read Andrew's latest post just a

[04:08] few hours ago on the alien thread I don't think any Ellie's are shipping even in May.

[04:15] In fact I just think they're going to try and buy mid and may just even just show you

[04:21] the art.

[04:22] Let me read you what he says word for word.

[04:25] Just to give an update on Ellie art.

[04:27] We have told Fox that we need to hit one of either alien day or the release of alien covenant

[04:34] for revealing the Ellie artwork.

[04:37] This is what everyone is working towards.

[04:40] Games continue to ship.

[04:42] Tweaks, faults and adjustments learn from the first batch of games are all being worked

[04:47] on and production is being ramped up.

[04:50] The delay in posting the Dave Center's interview is my fault and will be done shortly.

[04:55] Okay.

[04:56] He's spoken.

[04:59] I think we're at the point now where you just believe it or you don't.

[05:03] Right.

[05:04] We've talked about this and months go by and months go by and weeks go by and we keep hearing

[05:11] the same type of update that production is being ramped up.

[05:16] Production was said to have begun in September of 2016.

[05:20] We counted the amount of months that was.

[05:22] I think it was like eight months ago.

[05:24] So look, you know how I feel.

[05:26] I don't believe this stuff.

[05:28] I don't believe this stuff.

[05:30] I would ask if I were an owner when was the alien Ellie artwork submitted?

[05:36] Was it submitted before Tpf or after?

[05:40] And this whole notion that Fox's delay is the reason this is keeping the Ellie from being

[05:46] shown.

[05:47] I just don't believe it.

[05:49] I don't believe it would take this long for the Ellie artwork to be approved, especially

[05:56] because we know nothing is being hand drawn.

[06:00] Nothing is being created that wasn't given to them by Fox.

[06:06] So we heard the last time we heard from him about Ellie artwork.

[06:11] Remember what he said?

[06:12] He said we're waiting on an asset from Fox.

[06:16] So in that statement, he's waiting for Fox to give him something to complete the Ellie

[06:22] artwork.

[06:23] Now he's saying it's in Fox's court and he's sort of like giving them two dates by which

[06:31] he needs to be able to show it.

[06:34] And I just, part of me is just so, I can't be wilder that here we are, alien day 2017

[06:43] and we still might not have what the Ellie looks like for people to see.

[06:47] Remember last year we were fully expecting the game to be fully revealed on alien day

[06:53] and that date came and went.

[06:56] And so this is now a question for you guys and you owners out there.

[07:01] I do find it really strange that Orrick is nowhere to be found in the thread where is the

[07:08] communication from him in his own game.

[07:12] As we get to this period of games going out and launches, you know, it just feels really

[07:18] quiet in the alien thread.

[07:20] The threads keep getting bumped down to the second or third page as a pin side.

[07:25] Not the kind of hype and excitement and sort of fanfare you'd expect for a game that's

[07:31] about to go into mass production.

[07:34] I think I've said this before, Andrew's timing here is tight.

[07:38] I think if he doesn't get this thing out by the time attack from start start shipping

[07:43] dialed in and Star Wars, man, I don't know how he's going to survive.

[07:48] I really don't.

[07:50] And I just don't buy it.

[07:51] I don't buy it.

[07:52] I've said it before.

[07:53] I don't believe that Fox is the delay.

[07:57] If that I would love to see some proof.

[08:00] I would love to see an email or some sort of proof that Fox is delaying this whole process.

[08:07] I'm surprised nobody's called Fox and asked them.

[08:11] Right?

[08:12] If this was happening with Big Lebowski or happening with Predator, right?

[08:16] People would go off and try and find the truth out.

[08:19] But for some reason, and I can't quite figure it out.

[08:22] I can't quite figure it out why alien continues to get this pass and continues to just get

[08:29] a buy from people.

[08:31] When any other game was asking people to pay and fall or pay money and they hadn't seen

[08:37] what they were getting yet and months and months and months when buy with delays, you guys

[08:42] would have gone and found some real answers.

[08:45] But part of me is just like, you know what?

[08:47] I think a lot of people agree with me and a lot of people are on the sidelines saying

[08:52] like, yep, it nothing adds up here.

[08:55] When you connect the dots, it seems really fishy and production should not take two years

[09:01] to ramp up to.

[09:02] That doesn't seem to make much sense.

[09:04] Something's wrong.

[09:05] Something's wrong here and I don't ever feel like we're getting straight answers.

[09:09] So you can believe what he says or you could just believe the reality of what's happened

[09:14] is that nothing's ever happened, right?

[09:16] All the dates come and go.

[09:17] And again, I bet you you will see no alien Ellie's ship in May.

[09:23] Which again, that just seems bonkers to me when alien Ellie's were promised in August.

[09:29] They were promised in September.

[09:30] They were promised in January.

[09:34] So what's the hold up?

[09:36] What's the hold up?

[09:37] I wish Andrew would just come clean and say what the hold up is and stop hiding behind

[09:41] the fox thing, right?

[09:46] That's just not cool.

[09:48] Like, and if it's money, if it's this, just say it.

[09:50] Say what the truth is and I think Ted says this all the time.

[09:54] People will help you out, but they can't help you if you're going to hide behind the same

[10:00] excuse for months and months and months.

[10:02] Okay.

[10:03] In another galaxy, the alien galaxy continues to be in turmoil.

[10:07] The Star Wars galaxy is, we're right on the verge of it, right?

[10:12] And today is going to be an interesting day because Stern seems to be at the Star Wars

[10:17] convention.

[10:18] I'm showing the map and it's, we're unclear if they're going to be there or not.

[10:21] Nobody knows for sure.

[10:22] I said they were going to be there.

[10:24] Then I said they weren't going to be there.

[10:27] We're going to find out today.

[10:29] But here's the thing.

[10:30] I think if Stern is there, you are not going to see the new Star Wars pinball machine there.

[10:33] I highly doubt it.

[10:35] They may bring their old dad to e-Star Wars games there and they might have Erasmith

[10:39] and they might have Batman and they might have Ghostbusters.

[10:42] People forget this Star Wars convention is so damn big.

[10:46] It's sort of like E3 or Comic Con.

[10:49] It makes sense for Stern to be there because they're in front of all the tech nerds and

[10:52] geeks.

[10:53] Yeah, they might have a few materials to discuss about Star Wars.

[10:59] I don't know.

[11:00] Maybe a teaser video.

[11:01] I just don't think they're going to do anything.

[11:02] I think it's a mistake.

[11:04] I think they should.

[11:05] But we'll see.

[11:06] We all we can do is speculate.

[11:08] Speculate.

[11:09] We don't know what it's going to be.

[11:12] That's pretty much it.

[11:13] I want to air this interview with JJ.

[11:14] Like JJ is an amazing dude.

[11:17] He is my favorite distributor.

[11:19] I have interacted with him a bunch and he's a stand up guy.

[11:24] I say this because his livelihood is a distributor.

[11:28] He has a brick and mortar showcase, showroom.

[11:31] It's a family business.

[11:33] But all that doesn't matter.

[11:35] What really matters is the character of the individual and JJ has always been such a

[11:41] great guy, such a class act.

[11:43] He doesn't like tell you one thing and do another.

[11:48] He's got a list for games.

[11:51] If you're on his list, you're on his list.

[11:53] He's not going to bump you around.

[11:55] He's not taking money under the table.

[11:58] He really cares.

[11:59] He cares.

[12:00] He's seen this industry for many, many years.

[12:03] His insights on it, I think, are really valuable.

[12:07] He's got some good thoughts on if you guys are wanting a Star Wars, what you should go

[12:12] to.

[12:13] I think you're really going to enjoy this interview with JJ from Game Exchange in Colorado.

[12:17] I'm going to air it.

[12:18] I hope you guys love it.

[12:20] I'll probably be back on this weekend to say whether or not we saw anything at the Star

[12:25] Wars convention.

[12:26] Everyone, have a great week.

[12:28] Have a great end of your week and we'll talk to you soon.

[12:31] Here's JJ.

[12:32] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast, a pinball

[12:38] distributor who I think is the greatest class act out there in the pinball distributor world.

[12:45] JJ Babbage of Game Exchange in Denver, Colorado.

[12:49] JJ, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[12:53] Thank you, Chris.

[12:54] Glad to be here and excited to be on the show.

[12:58] And JJ, you and I have done business before.

[13:00] JJ is the man who got me my Batman L.A.s.

[13:05] And I have to say, I really appreciate you getting me those machines.

[13:09] I don't regret finding new homes for them though because I don't think the game has come

[13:14] alive, just yet.

[13:15] But, JJ, we'll get into that.

[13:18] Talk to us how you got into becoming a distributor for home entertainment devices like pinball

[13:26] and arcade machines and air hockey and all that jazz.

[13:29] So I grew up in the business.

[13:30] I've been doing this since I was six years old.

[13:33] My dad's been doing it for 38 years.

[13:37] I started out working in our Cades, passing out flyers, counting tickets, and then moving

[13:42] up into clearing coin jams and fixing games.

[13:45] I've done everything from the service department of Game Exchange all the way up to parts, sales.

[13:51] And now I handle most of the day-to-day operations for the company on top of doing sales.

[13:57] So I grew up in the business for a very short period of time when I was in high school

[14:03] and early college I wanted to go into computer science.

[14:06] And then I realized after the comm crash in 2000 that maybe that wasn't such a wise idea.

[14:13] And got back into wanting to do arcade games and things like that.

[14:18] You didn't win at the time.

[14:19] The industry looked like it was a dying industry.

[14:25] I am today and I'm very happy with what I do.

[14:28] Like getting up and going to work every day and fortunate because I get to bring my dog

[14:31] every day to work too.

[14:32] So I wish I could bring Bubba to work.

[14:34] He's next to me now looking at his paws.

[14:36] I've got to get him to stop that because Bulldogs irritate their paws when they constantly

[14:40] lick.

[14:41] So you grew up around it.

[14:42] Now that must have been cool.

[14:43] I mean you're a kid and you've grown up around arcade games, pinball machines.

[14:48] And what was that like?

[14:51] Was it just like, were you like the coolest kid on the block that you had access to all

[14:54] these things and you were constantly surrounded by them?

[14:57] So I was very fortunate that I got to go to amusement showcase each year.

[15:05] About every other year we would get to go to that in Vegas and get to try out all the

[15:08] new games and would get to go to back when Nintendo was still in the manufacturing business

[15:15] for a coin up.

[15:16] We would go to the Nintendo trade shows and they'd always take the family's river rap

[15:20] thing and all kinds of really cool stuff.

[15:24] I was there when Nintendo made the announcement that they were shutting down.

[15:29] I was in the business when Bali decided they were, Bali Williams was done in making pinball

[15:36] and was there when we were a big capcom distributor and we were there when all of a sudden capcom

[15:43] games were worth pennies on the dollar when they were like, you know, we, this is a good

[15:47] experiment.

[15:48] We're out.

[15:50] So it's been kind of fun that way too.

[15:51] So you've seen this industry go high and low?

[15:56] Yeah, definitely very high.

[15:59] You know, in the late 80s, early 90s, my memory kind of comes to it.

[16:03] Industry being super, super hot.

[16:05] You could produce anything and sell it basically for the box of lights in it.

[16:08] You could sell it to late 90s, early 2000s with the heavy demise of arcades and pinball

[16:17] dying off and video games all going to console bay stuff.

[16:23] The business got to be pretty hard and we've seen a lot of other distributors in the

[16:27] business go out of business and be there.

[16:32] Some of the companies that were there that helped my day get its start.

[16:36] Right.

[16:37] And just 50, 60, 80 year businesses close or shrink so low they get gobbled up by somebody.

[16:43] Right.

[16:44] I heard a lot about how there were these lean years in the early 2000s and then did you

[16:50] start to see a resurgence when it was like lower the rings and certain pinball machines

[16:55] started to sort of grow in popularity.

[17:00] What do you think was like the turning point that sort of got things back on track for

[17:06] stuff like arcade and pinball sort of like in the mid 2000s?

[17:09] I don't think it was until there was a little resurgence kind of in the mid 2000s and then

[17:14] of course as it was trying to crawl out of its grave a little bit the recession hit in

[17:20] 2007, 2008 area and then kind of kicked it back down in there.

[17:24] And it took tell about 2010, 2011 before you really got to see the pinball business and

[17:29] the arcade business start to climb out of that grave a little bit.

[17:34] And things such as barcades really helped.

[17:37] It reminded people that our age maybe even a little bit older that hey pinball still

[17:42] a lot of fun.

[17:44] Classic age is still a lot of fun and I know you can do it on a console on arcade game

[17:48] but it's not the same.

[17:50] And you know you can have virtual pinball but that's not at all the same thing either.

[17:54] And you started making pinball social again.

[17:58] And that certainly helped immensely on it.

[18:00] Right.

[18:01] And I think too you know when we look at the resurgence of the barcade, of the home

[18:07] collector, a lot of it lines up with the guys who have the money.

[18:13] They're in the prime earning of their careers right.

[18:16] And now that they look back on their youth and the things that they enjoyed the most,

[18:21] they have that extra sort of pin money.

[18:24] You know pin money is a term that is an ancient term that used to mean women would save

[18:29] up their money and almost like stick pins in a, I forget what the actual reference is.

[18:34] But it meant like excess money to buy things you love.

[18:36] So it also fits for the fact that these guys who are earning in the prime of their careers

[18:42] now have excess income right.

[18:45] And I think a lot of them, we see it now it is, are buying collections for their home.

[18:51] And so when that sort of shift happened, did you just, did business just start to boom

[18:57] like circa 2000, like 2010 plus?

[19:01] Did you just see a big uptick in orders coming in for people putting machines in their homes?

[19:06] So we kind of saw two different types of upticks.

[19:08] The first being of course the enthusiast guy who had a pinball growing up or love pinball

[19:13] growing up and always wanted a pinball machine, you know, loved pinball or loved Jurassic

[19:19] Park and in the early 1990s or something and had his game that he was just looking for.

[19:23] So that was kind of the start of it.

[19:25] And one side, the other side is, and it's actually driven by the mothers, is people

[19:30] are worried about their kids being out and not knowing what their kids are doing and stuff

[19:33] like that.

[19:34] And so they'll come in and they'll buy three, five different arcade games and pinball

[19:38] machines mixed up so that they know where all the kids are.

[19:42] All the kids come to their house.

[19:43] It costs them a little extra soda, it costs them a little extra snacks, but they know where

[19:47] the kids are, they know who their kids are hanging out with, they have the fun house

[19:50] and they would.

[19:51] And I grew up having the fun house in the abrid, so I understand how that works.

[19:55] And then what we start to see there is, then dad gets involved and then mom gets involved

[19:59] and all of a sudden they once again find pinball and they get their first one and then they

[20:04] kind of trade in an arcade game and buy another pinball.

[20:06] Then they trade in something else and they get another pinball.

[20:09] And I always tell people, if you buy your first pinball, you may not have the bug.

[20:12] You buy your second pinball, you're now addicted.

[20:15] And whenever you need your fix come and see me because it's like heroin.

[20:19] Once you get past that second hit, it's got you.

[20:23] And you're going to end up with like some of these guys, 50, 60, 70 pinball machines.

[20:28] It's been incredible.

[20:30] Yeah, I've definitely been bitten.

[20:33] I'm on my third pin.

[20:34] It doesn't work.

[20:36] But I will be on four, five, and six.

[20:40] I already know what they're going to be.

[20:42] It's funny because my mom is one of those moms you described.

[20:45] When I was a young kid, I was about 12 or 13.

[20:48] I have a twin brother.

[20:49] And when you used to go to the arcade all the time, and that was like when parents were

[20:53] just concerned kids would get into drugs and hang around a bunch of vagabounds.

[20:58] And so she's like, look, I'll buy you one arcade game if you just play at home.

[21:03] And we picked a home use, we picked a Street Fighter 2 champion edition.

[21:07] It's home use only.

[21:08] I still have it to this day.

[21:10] It's got a perfect 25 inch monitor.

[21:13] It's, and I always tell people this machine will never, will never leave because it's from

[21:17] my mama.

[21:18] But so let's talk about distributing now.

[21:22] So in general, what's more popular as a distributor in 2017?

[21:28] Or arcade machines or pinball?

[21:30] For us, I would say pinball is definitely more popular.

[21:33] For most distributors, I would say the gravy's in the redemption business.

[21:41] That's the big hot thing right now.

[21:44] It is these massive FEC's, family entertainment centers, and redemption.

[21:49] And the redemption games are what makes money in arcades.

[21:52] And that's why you see so few pinballs in arcades out there is that they require a lot

[21:57] of maintenance as we all know.

[22:00] And they don't earn the money like a ticket when the spinning machine does.

[22:04] So our distributors, when we talk about volume, are they doing more volume of redemption

[22:12] machines that go out on location versus pinball machines that people are collecting?

[22:17] But I guess it's just case by case by which distributor, but some may focus on redemption,

[22:22] some don't even carry pinball.

[22:25] Certainly, and in the old brick and mortar, old school distributors, we're kind of a member

[22:30] of, we're very unique in the fact that we also target game rooms and pinball enthusiasts.

[22:37] We sell so many pinballs.

[22:38] I would say that's unique amongst the veterans and especially coins who just got bought

[22:42] out in the ABS and stuff like that.

[22:44] As if you go to their showrooms, there's four or five pinballs on their floor, a couple

[22:47] refurbished, a couple of new.

[22:51] They sell a handful, you know, every once in a while, and that's kind of how it is.

[22:55] And we do, you know, you go to my showroom floor today and there is 11 or 12 brand new

[23:03] Stern pinballs, Baltimore models.

[23:05] And then there is another 18 used refurbished pinballs on the showroom floor, another 20 in

[23:11] the back when you get refurbished and sold.

[23:14] Who do you distribute for with new pinball machines?

[23:18] I know Stern and you're also doing attack from Mars.

[23:21] So I also do Chicago Gaming Planetary Pinball.

[23:24] Those are the only two brands that we represent at this time.

[23:27] Okay.

[23:28] Now how does that work?

[23:29] When you're a distributor, how do you decide whose games you want to carry?

[23:33] Do you, does it make sense to go after Jersey Jack and highway or do you kind of try to

[23:39] keep it more focused?

[23:43] So as I mentioned beginning of the talk is that we did carry Capcom, we've carried other

[23:48] small brands.

[23:49] We've had Bern by when they go under or don't make it.

[23:53] You know, and those kind of things, we've seen a lot of small pinball companies, game

[23:56] plan, things like that come in, be here for two or three games and then fold.

[24:01] A business I never want to be in is manufacturing pinballs.

[24:04] What a kind of thankless hard job that can be, I can only imagine that surprise Jack isn't

[24:13] a whole lot more bold than he is because I would rip my hair out doing that job.

[24:16] It's hard.

[24:17] It takes a lot of capital to get going.

[24:18] It takes a lot of years to get profitable.

[24:22] What we do when we look at it is we look and see, well, what are the products they have,

[24:27] what kind of pinball background do they have, how deeper their pockets to stay in the business?

[24:33] And what's their distribution channel going to look like?

[24:36] You know, and in Jack's case, the manufacturer is directly competing with you as a seller

[24:42] of the product.

[24:43] That's a no-win situation for anybody.

[24:47] The only one that wins at that is Jack, unfortunately, because he could run a sale that he doesn't

[24:52] give his distributors or he could drop the price a little bit if he needs a sell a few

[24:57] pieces to his direct customers and he knows who good and wants to keep in his distribution

[25:01] channel directly.

[25:03] He has the ability to do that because he has double the margin.

[25:06] And so that allows him to do a lot more things.

[25:09] And that's, in my opinion, a manufacturer, this industry, both arcade and pinball, doesn't

[25:15] belong in the sales business.

[25:16] They need to go to distribution where they have people that can show their product and

[25:20] provide parts and service for non-enthusiast people.

[25:26] You need to have a distribution channel and direct selling kills your distribution channel.

[25:31] Is it fair to say that a good metaphor or example of what a pinball distributor is is sort

[25:38] of like a car dealership?

[25:40] I think that's the way that a pinball distributor should be.

[25:44] There are many out there that are not, that they are more of a Amazon.

[25:50] But in my opinion, what a pinball distributor should be is somebody that has regular hours

[25:54] where you can go and check out games and has a parts department and has a service department.

[26:01] It works great.

[26:02] Amazon concept works great for pinheads that know what they're doing and don't need service

[26:07] and maybe pre-order the game before it comes out or takes everybody else's reviews on

[26:12] a game and doesn't have to play it before they buy it.

[26:15] That works great.

[26:16] But that's not going to grow pinball.

[26:18] The only way to grow pinball is to have machines where the common public can try them and

[26:23] the common public can buy them and get them serviced.

[26:25] They're not going to buy a game if they're concerned that they're going to get serviced.

[26:29] I mean, would you go buy a day-wool car today knowing that you can't get parts and service

[26:33] for it?

[26:34] Right.

[26:35] There's no you would.

[26:36] So, they're not going to grow pinball by just kind of Amazoning pinballs to the users.

[26:41] Right.

[26:42] So, what we've seen too with Stern's distribution method makes Stern much more successful because

[26:51] they basically have a sales force out there like game exchange where fundamentally they're

[26:57] showrooms where people can come in, try the product, feel good about buying it.

[27:03] You guys set it up in their homes.

[27:05] They feel good about there's customer service.

[27:09] There's maintenance that they can get from the distributor.

[27:12] And how many distributors does Stern?

[27:14] Do you know how many they have in total?

[27:17] I don't.

[27:18] I know most of the time there's one or two in each country that they have a master dealer

[27:23] usually.

[27:24] But, in the United States, they went a different way.

[27:28] They have many more distributors.

[27:29] I would guess the number is somewhere around 30 distributors across the country.

[27:36] And with those being about 30, 40% old school brick and mortar distributors and then more

[27:45] pinball distributors in there as well.

[27:48] And then some just guys who just drop ship and things like that.

[27:52] Right.

[27:53] And I know that your name comes up a lot.

[27:56] You're one of the biggest Stern distributors in America, correct?

[27:59] Correct.

[28:00] Okay.

[28:01] And so, I think that's a really interesting point you're talking about because I think some

[28:06] of these new companies that come out and try to compete and become a viable business without

[28:13] a distribution model.

[28:15] I mean, we've seen it time and time again.

[28:17] When you're buying direct from the manufacturer, if any issue is happening with that manufacturer,

[28:23] we see people struggling to get refunds.

[28:25] We've seen people lose money.

[28:26] And I think there's a lot of piece of mind that distributors give pinball buyers knowing

[28:32] that there is someone there who has their back, should there be a manufacturer issue,

[28:36] right?

[28:37] I mean, that's one of the benefits of having that middle man sort of help you with your

[28:42] purchase.

[28:45] We've been around the business long enough that with a new distributor comes to us and says,

[28:51] hey, I want to build a pinball machine and I've been in this business this long and we

[28:56] know what questions they ask like the deep pockets and the things like that.

[28:59] But we also know how to protect ourselves and protect our customers, saying, hey, listen,

[29:04] we'll put in a purchase order, but we're only going to put in 250 bucks.

[29:09] That's all we're going to ask from our customers.

[29:11] Then we're going to lost their minimal or we're going to take the money and we're going

[29:15] to put it in an escrow account and we'll both have title to the escrow account, but you can't

[29:21] touch that until the bill of lading is shown the games have shipped.

[29:26] Things like that.

[29:27] And that's a lot of the companies necessarily finance themselves with your money.

[29:32] You guys are buying games and letting people finance themselves with your money without

[29:36] really getting any equity in the company, really at all.

[29:39] And that's dangerous.

[29:40] Yeah, it's very dangerous.

[29:41] And we've seen it not work out more times than it has worked out for customers.

[29:47] So I really think that if we look at even, I know even like today, Dutch pinball came out

[29:53] because I know they're having a big issue with their manufacturing.

[29:57] Their main distributor for Big Lebowski is CoinTaker and individuals who bought through

[30:03] CoinTaker can always get a refund because CoinTaker holds the money, but individuals who bought

[30:09] directly from Dutch are stuck.

[30:12] And I think that's another good example of why I think going through distributors is

[30:16] always the best way.

[30:18] Now, JJ, you guys distribute Stern.

[30:20] And I think Stern is like the company that no one ever has anxiety or fear whether or

[30:24] not they're going to get their game.

[30:26] Let's talk about what it's like being a distributor for the juggernaut.

[30:30] When I talked to George Gomez, he said they had 92% of the business.

[30:34] Do you agree with that number?

[30:36] Does that number seem a little large or do you think that's pretty spot on?

[30:40] I would say that's pretty spot on worldwide.

[30:43] Probably domestically that number is maybe 85% or 90%.

[30:47] But I would say internationally, absolutely.

[30:49] They have a massive international following as well and has been building it every year.

[30:55] That's Gary Stern sales market.

[30:56] He works with all the distributors directly on that and flies.

[30:59] And if you ever talk to Gary, he's a lot of times in Dubai or he's in France or he's

[31:03] in Italy.

[31:04] Then one of his markets, he's been kind of talking and then working out.

[31:07] It sounds like when I've kind of talked to him is China.

[31:09] A huge emerging market that I've never seen reports of pinball there.

[31:15] So it could be very exciting.

[31:17] We're paying close attention to home pin and what they're trying to do over there in

[31:22] China.

[31:23] It's going to be interesting to see if Mike can build a company from the ground up and

[31:27] build every part.

[31:29] So Stern's got a big, big chunk of the market.

[31:33] They almost have no competition.

[31:34] I say that all the time on this show.

[31:36] Let's talk about Stern because they're sort of like the hot commodity right now.

[31:41] What was it like over the last few years?

[31:43] It's since you've been in the last, let's just take a look at the last five years of Stern.

[31:47] What have been the hottest titles in terms of people banging on your door being like,

[31:52] I want this, I want this, I want this.

[31:55] You know, certainly ACDC was very hot.

[31:58] Ghostbusters has been incredibly hot and is still extremely hot.

[32:02] I can hardly keep in my building.

[32:06] Tron was very, very big in that period of time.

[32:09] Metallica has done very well.

[32:10] Walking dead has done very well.

[32:13] I started out doing well and kind of slowed quickly.

[32:18] There was no, there was no, what about WWE?

[32:20] Wasn't that like the title?

[32:21] No, I'm kidding.

[32:24] I saw that one unfortunately as a title that really wasn't going to take off that well

[32:28] and it's been proven that the title kind of surprised me in the longer legs was Mustang.

[32:33] Was that after it kind of made produce, it kind of kept pushing some code out for it.

[32:39] It actually became a pretty darn good game.

[32:41] Right.

[32:42] And when titles like WWE and Mustang come out, how does it work?

[32:48] Do you guys only get what customers have purchased?

[32:51] Or do you guys put in an order just to have some supply to put on the showroom and walk

[32:57] us through what happens with those titles that don't quite pop?

[33:02] So hopefully I guess the title correctly.

[33:06] Me and the old man, Rich, my dad sat down and we kind of chat about what we think the

[33:11] demand on the title is going to be and most of the time we get it right like WWE and

[33:14] sometimes I can get it wrong like this.

[33:17] And we order what we think we need for on L.E.'s a year supply of the game above and beyond

[33:24] what we sell on pre-order.

[33:26] And a lot of times in cases like Ghostbusters and Metallica and things like that, those

[33:32] were gone before the day or two after they were announced, they're just gone.

[33:36] In the case of Metallica, they were gone in three hours.

[33:39] I was on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean when that game was released.

[33:43] I had such slow internet all I could do was take orders and I had to ask customers, why

[33:47] is this game so hot?

[33:48] I can't see the pictures.

[33:49] What is going on?

[33:50] They're like, oh my god, the artwork is amazing.

[33:52] I was as blind as could be.

[33:54] We had heard Metallica was coming out and I'm a big Metallica fan and it's right around

[33:59] my age group and things like that but I felt like it was a little bit too young for pinball

[34:04] and that I have for right and I thought it really wasn't going to be a huge seller.

[34:09] And then the artwork and the layout came out and it blew up.

[34:13] That was so right to me.

[34:15] Yeah, did you, how does that work?

[34:17] Let's take Metallica as an example.

[34:19] Metallica Ellie gets announced.

[34:23] Have you already put in an order for a number based upon you and your dad's analysis of

[34:28] how popular you think it's going to be before Stern even puts up their official announcement

[34:34] on the game?

[34:35] So Gary's team usually tells you your allotment is going to be XYZ and in the last few years

[34:42] they've gotten even better about communicating that and they don't usually say what the

[34:45] game is.

[34:46] They just say your next game allotment, usually a week, two weeks before your next game

[34:49] allotment is going to be 50 games.

[34:51] Okay, and that's before they announced that they're like, you're going to get 50 of the

[34:54] next Ellie.

[34:55] Correct.

[34:56] And then you kind of try to figure out what the game is going to be a little bit and

[35:02] usually you can get a little feel for it.

[35:04] But you never get to see pictures, you never get to see layouts.

[35:08] So are you ordering items on a title?

[35:10] Are you ordering against that allotment?

[35:12] So for example, if Gary says, JJ, your next allotment of the next Ellie is 50, do you

[35:18] then say I want all 50, I'll take 20 and that's how you do it?

[35:24] So usually if you think the allotment is too low, you say guys, I really think this

[35:27] is going to be a better title for me.

[35:28] I'd like to see some more and they say, well, too bad or okay, we think we can get you

[35:31] a little more.

[35:32] Or if you're or you're real high and you know you're real high, you can say you guys,

[35:37] I think I'm too high and they appreciate that because if they can offer to another distributor

[35:41] who might have the marketplace.

[35:42] Because I could just see Gary calling you up and saying, JJ, your allotment for the next

[35:45] Ellie is 500 and it's like, and good news, it's WWE.

[35:49] Like, what?

[35:50] You got to walk 500 WWE's.

[35:53] So you get a choice on what you take on that and they're not kind of binding on that

[35:59] number until a few days after that, then you put in your purchase orders for how many

[36:04] you really want.

[36:05] So by then you've got an idea of how things are going and usually with the love of

[36:10] Pennside and sources that many Pennsideers have, including yourself.

[36:15] Everyone knows.

[36:16] We usually have a pretty good idea of what's coming and even sometimes a few little corner

[36:21] pictures or something is leaked out that I've seen.

[36:23] So you're in the same boat.

[36:25] You're in the same boat as me and the rest of the Pennside people.

[36:28] You don't know the next like four or five titles as a major distributor for Stern.

[36:33] You guys are my source of information as usually you guys.

[36:37] You guys have better sources because the employees we talk to constantly day in and day out, the

[36:43] sales team and stuff like that are watched so carefully and so closely with that stuff

[36:47] that they're not willing to leak or talk or do anything about that stuff.

[36:51] So I've tried the ply Gary with lots of vodka method.

[36:56] That doesn't work.

[36:57] I've tried taking shots at the VP of sales over there.

[37:01] Jean-Pouce Galleria and his favorite go to is the Hello Kitty with a free kitten with

[37:05] every game.

[37:06] So he's got his go to thing that he always goes to if you push too hard and you'll hear

[37:11] him say it every once in a while and they hide it well.

[37:14] Right.

[37:15] Let's talk about the last few really sort of hot titles.

[37:17] I want to talk about Ghostbusters because that one just sort of blew up.

[37:23] The demand for that game was through the roof.

[37:25] There were I believe 500 LEDs, right?

[37:28] 251 to the states and 250 overseas.

[37:31] We are Ghostbusters just like spoken for.

[37:34] I mean because that title leaked like people were passing around and seemed like it was

[37:38] sold out before it even got announced.

[37:41] That's pretty much kind of how it went is our wait list kind of got first crack at it

[37:46] as things became a little more true and stuff like that.

[37:51] So it was I think I had three or five available to the general public that I had held back

[37:56] just to have something on release time out there.

[37:59] But yeah, it how many were you allotted in terms of LEDs?

[38:03] I'm trying to, but I want to say I was somewhere right around 35 I think.

[38:10] Okay.

[38:11] So that's a great percentage of the overall that we're out there.

[38:15] So 35 and when they started to have some of the issues.

[38:21] Did have you had to replace any play fields for people or have your customers been okay?

[38:26] No, certainly I don't think there was anyone that was unaffected by that.

[38:31] That was a play field nightmare.

[38:35] And Sterno still kind of finishing up, taking care of people on those and getting them

[38:39] taken care of.

[38:40] I would say that about two thirds of my play field issues that are out there that have

[38:45] been approved are waiting to be taken care of.

[38:47] But I only had, I believe one or two play fields that were not opted to be replaced

[38:53] that were what they said.

[38:54] We're going to come back and look at them again and take a bunch from the program.

[38:58] There's still backlog on getting those replacements out for people.

[39:01] That's taken a while, right?

[39:03] I mean, this is where we're in April now of 2017.

[39:08] And that game I believe if I'm guessing right was a May 2016 announcement.

[39:14] My memory serves me correct.

[39:16] It was a March or April announcement and starting to ship in late May.

[39:19] Right.

[39:20] So we're coming up on 10 months of this process.

[39:23] And the problems probably started showing up in June and July.

[39:25] So we're about eight months, but I think that they really had to, and smartly so, make

[39:33] sure that they had the problem identified, fixed and tested that they weren't sending

[39:38] people a second batch of bad play fields out.

[39:42] And there were a few people that are early on the head and reported that and they pulled

[39:45] back and even stopped for another two months to make sure that they weren't just shipping

[39:48] out things and really upsetting customers.

[39:50] They want to make sure they got it right the set time.

[39:53] So as long as in my opinion, as long as they said, hey, listen, we're going to take care

[39:57] of this.

[39:58] 95% of my customers were like, hey, once you guys get it ready, send it out as long as I

[40:03] know I'm in line.

[40:04] I don't care.

[40:05] Yeah, I mean, I actually, you know, we all know the story is going to take care of everybody.

[40:09] I actually think if you have a play field that's got ghosting or some chip clear coat, man,

[40:15] just play the hell out of it knowing you're going to get a new one, right?

[40:17] I mean, I would be on that thing like 500 times a week and knowing that a new one is coming

[40:21] down the road that's going to be brand new.

[40:23] It's like rolling, rolling back the adometer on the car.

[40:27] So, all right, so Ghostbusters issues they're working on at hugely popular title, Stir and

[40:32] Learn Their Lesson, Handron Artwork.

[40:36] Let's go to Batman.

[40:37] Batman gets announced and that's another title that just seemed to sell out before they

[40:44] even showed anything.

[40:45] They announced it, but no one had seen anything and already the LEDs and then the super

[40:49] LED was part of this package.

[40:52] What were your thoughts when you saw Stir and sort of go into that high end boutique

[40:56] price point with super LEDs?

[40:59] I thought it was a little strange and very different than what Stir and Learn has done

[41:05] in the past and it turned to have worked out well for them.

[41:09] They didn't have to have to increase the number of production because they had so much

[41:11] demand and so many people asking for it and still had people that they had to tell them,

[41:17] sorry, no.

[41:20] And it's been very, very well for them and we've sold a lot of premiums.

[41:26] We've sold through all of our LEDs before pictures were ever shown.

[41:31] We advocated for several of our customers who asked us to advocate for them to try to

[41:35] get them super LEDs as well and they all got those.

[41:39] So it was definitely a process.

[41:43] Did those customers, so the customers who might have, you know, might be like long time

[41:46] customers of yours or just, they love the theme.

[41:49] They come to you and say, hey, like, we'd love to get a super LED.

[41:53] Do they all have to do the silly like YouTube videos, submission, application junk or do

[41:58] you help them sort of bypass some of that nonsense that Stern was requiring people to do

[42:04] together?

[42:05] They still did that, but we submitted them for them and then kind of wrote the letter for

[42:08] them on top of the video saying, hey, listen, this is a customer of the spot.

[42:13] X number of games, serial numbers listed off.

[42:16] You know, they're a big Stern collector or a huge Batman fan or, you know, whatever

[42:21] he was what they've done for Penball.

[42:23] They, you know, host league night at their house, you know, once a month.

[42:27] They bring shit games to shows.

[42:31] It almost feels like these are like references trying to get your kid into college, right?

[42:35] I mean, it's, it's pretty amazing what Stern was able to accomplish with those super

[42:39] LEDs.

[42:41] Look, let's hope the code comes out soon because I've been jumping on a bunch of Batman's,

[42:45] but I still think it's got some code to go before the game wakes up.

[42:50] But we know the greatest coder on the universe is on it.

[42:54] So we should see that soon.

[42:56] So JJ, talk to me about, and you know, as I think about where we are with the popularity

[43:01] of these LEDs and Stern seems to just keep, keep hitting like, hit after hit, hit, hit,

[43:06] hit, hit, hit, hit.

[43:07] Can you talk, hit after, hit, hit.

[43:08] Do you just have like a list of guys that are just like, yo, JJ, just put me on a never

[43:15] ending list for the next Ellie and it's just like that list just exists.

[43:21] I have a few guys who are like that.

[43:22] I really honestly try to frown upon doing that too much because it's the great customer

[43:30] to have, but you want them to have an input and whether they're getting and stuff like

[43:33] that.

[43:34] I always have a few guys that have told me to make sure they reach out to them first.

[43:38] And I have guys that, you know, call and say, I want to be on this wait list and I'll

[43:43] make a wait list for whatever the next designer's next game is.

[43:46] So like I have Steve Richie's next up and coming game or I have John Borg's next game.

[43:52] We're all doing a wait list and I won't take any money on it.

[43:55] It's just a wait list for me to kind of call you and say, hey guys, I think this is coming

[43:59] out soon.

[44:00] I think we've all heard the rumors.

[44:03] What do you think?

[44:04] That's kind of how I do it versus just having this reoccurring list where it's all the

[44:08] time and having people always send me money.

[44:10] I really don't like to take money on games that aren't announced.

[44:14] It feels sleazy and dirty to me and I just feel like I'm selling vaporware so I don't

[44:18] like to do that.

[44:19] Well, I have to really commend JJ because even in my dealings, we all know what the next

[44:28] turn title is going to be and it's coming from a galaxy far away and the demand and the

[44:34] excitement for that theme is astronomical.

[44:38] And as a distributor, it's a situation where you're not allowed to take money beforehand

[44:44] on any title before it's announced.

[44:49] Talk to us about what it's like managing those sort of dream themes that are the worst

[44:58] kept secrets and you've got to manage all this inbound interest in it.

[45:03] Do you just do it like fair and square like, hey, whoever called and inquired about it

[45:09] and wanted to be on Steve Richie's next game?

[45:11] I'm just building a list in that order and that's it.

[45:15] I'm not going to take your $1,000 and get you to the front of the line.

[45:18] I'm not going to, you know, how do you do it?

[45:20] That is how I do it is if you're on the line and that's where it is and you're going

[45:24] to get that first line and I'm going to run down my list and then blast out emails or

[45:29] make phone calls and things like that and say, listen, we're getting close.

[45:33] What are your thoughts and things like that?

[45:35] One of the things that's made it hard and you mentioned it is you can't take deposits

[45:38] on stuff before it's really announced.

[45:41] That's frowned upon.

[45:42] It was forbidden from Chicago gaming on their title and that's really hard to make sure

[45:46] that your people who run your wait list get an adequate ability to make a decision and

[45:51] buy one and still give an opportunity to strike by the iron's hot and go out and fresh

[45:56] hot.

[45:57] I think that's currently the battle I'm internally fighting myself with myself is that how

[46:03] do I properly make sure that you're on my Steve Richie's next release, Chris?

[46:08] You know that.

[46:09] You and your up and you're brother on there.

[46:13] How do I make sure that you who have been on there for almost a year now I think are

[46:19] given a fair shot to make a decision on what you want to do without me missing out on a

[46:25] sale if you say, you know what, it's not for me.

[46:29] How do I balance that?

[46:31] That's kind of where I'm in my own head right now.

[46:34] That was really hard on the Tech from Mars, Ellie and what I did on that one and it

[46:41] worked.

[46:42] I didn't have any complaints.

[46:44] I sent out the email blast right at two o'clock when we were allowed to and 15, 20 minutes

[46:50] later I made the blast to my regular email list and my Facebook and things like that.

[46:56] But have you sold out of your Ellie's for Tech from Mars?

[46:59] Oh yeah.

[47:00] I sold out Friday night at the show.

[47:03] And then I managed to, a few people dropped out and their wife found out things like that.

[47:08] I managed to get my hands on a few more as well.

[47:11] So I was able to increase what I had out there.

[47:15] How many now?

[47:16] Are they making a thousand Ellie's or how many they make in?

[47:19] I believe they're making a thousand Ellie's.

[47:21] I believe it's 500 domestic, 500 or plan to go overseas.

[47:25] There could be some more that don't make it overseas.

[47:27] But I believe that's the plan.

[47:30] Right now I had a cancellation yesterday.

[47:31] I think that's available on my website.

[47:34] But otherwise I am completely sold out on those.

[47:37] Right.

[47:38] That's good.

[47:39] I think that title looks amazing.

[47:42] I actually really like the green harm around it as much as people were complaining about

[47:45] it.

[47:46] I think it's a stellar package for the money.

[47:51] So I think that's sort of where we're at.

[47:53] And I guess what I'm always curious about too, J.J.

[47:55] Because the other industry I'm really into is the auto industry.

[47:59] I think you're a car guy too.

[48:00] Am I just making that for it?

[48:01] Yep.

[48:02] Okay.

[48:03] Yeah.

[48:04] You're a big car head.

[48:06] In the auto industry, when something like a Star Wars comes out, and I think a good sort

[48:13] of equal sort of hype car is like the Ford Shelby GT350R.

[48:20] It's like this hot performance car.

[48:23] There's way more people that want it than Ford can make.

[48:27] One thing will happen with Stern in Star Wars.

[48:30] Now the difference in the auto industry is that dealers mark up the product based upon

[48:36] the demand.

[48:37] But the distributors for the most part don't do that in Pimbal.

[48:42] Do you think the day is going to come and where distributors say, well, why should I just

[48:49] sell the game at MSRP to Tom Dick and Harry?

[48:53] And they're just going to go flip it on eBay for 5,000 more when I could just knowing

[48:59] that my weight list for the game has 100 people above what I'm going to get.

[49:03] I could just mark the price up for each one by 3, 4 grand and still sell everyone.

[49:09] There are some distributors do that.

[49:11] And in the past, I've kept a couple of back show and I call retail sales for my showroom

[49:15] floor.

[49:17] I haven't done that in the last few titles because they've blown out so fast that I feel

[49:20] guilty doing it so I just let it roll.

[49:23] But you also have to look at the long term on it.

[49:25] And that's what I think Cardi Loships miss a lot.

[49:27] Right.

[49:28] So you've bought a lot of games.

[49:31] I got you managed to get you in your case Batman Ellie.

[49:36] And now you've come to being you've ordered other games and you're on my weight list and

[49:39] things like that.

[49:40] I have to look at the broader stroke of the longer distance on that for when I get a kiss

[49:43] Ellie or when I get it up you know you're probably going to come to me even if it's not

[49:47] as a desirable title and I got to think about it that way too.

[49:50] Right.

[49:51] No, I think it's honorable and it's great.

[49:53] I mean nobody likes Cardi Loships that charge over.

[49:56] I mean I went down to a Dodge dealership in white planes of the day and they were still

[50:01] charging $10,000 over for a health cat.

[50:03] And I'm just like, man I can go on the internet and find this car for sticker like in a hundred

[50:09] different locations.

[50:10] And you're right.

[50:13] It doesn't create a loyal customer base if you're doing the markup stuff.

[50:17] So and I you know I think that there's so many exciting games coming down the pipeline

[50:22] that while there will be a mob to get Star Wars machines my hunch is they're going to make

[50:29] a decent amount of Ellie's.

[50:30] I also think they're going to do what they did with ACDC and I think they're going to make

[50:34] other additions of the game sort of all a Lucy additions that if you if you rush in

[50:40] and get the Ellie.

[50:42] I think there's going to be more additions down the road that actually become the rare

[50:46] kind of collectible one because it'll just come at the end of the run.

[50:50] But again, pinball should be played.

[50:53] And yeah, I'm saying this as a collector.

[50:55] The games should be played.

[50:56] They should be flipped.

[50:58] No pinball is a great investment per say.

[51:01] But what must help you JJ is that the value of these machines does hold pretty damn well.

[51:06] Right.

[51:07] And that's got to be one of the greatest selling points as you're talking to people about

[51:11] buying a pinball machine.

[51:13] Do you agree?

[51:14] I do agree and I do see that some people kind of have the wrong idea.

[51:20] Just like you said, they're pin investors.

[51:22] They think they're buying a game that's going to blow up in value because they've got

[51:25] lucky on ACDC and they've got lucky on Tron Ali.

[51:28] But in the great idea of it most of the time, you're not going to make money on buying

[51:33] a pinball machine.

[51:34] That's not going to be case the same as a car.

[51:36] You know, a few people early got in on PT cruisers turn around and flip them and made

[51:40] some money.

[51:41] You don't know why I don't ask me that question.

[51:42] But in the great majority of times, it's going to appreciate.

[51:47] That's how they're depreciating us.

[51:49] Right.

[51:50] And look, even if you do flip a game quickly for a grand or two, what I've learned too is,

[51:57] you know, so you made a few bucks but you never got to enjoy the game.

[52:00] It's just weird.

[52:01] You know, I always have like, like I sold my Ghostbusters early before I ever played it.

[52:06] And I kind of am kicking myself now because it's just such a fun game.

[52:10] Like, in a New York City, like a grand or two, like, I just went to the vet.

[52:15] I took Bubba to the vet twice in the last week.

[52:19] It was $1,500 for two vet visits.

[52:22] And the damn dog is fine.

[52:24] I don't even know what the hell I paid for.

[52:26] But, you know, so I have a new approach that every game I get moving forward is going

[52:32] to be something I flip and enjoy.

[52:34] And Star Wars is just sort of like a dream theme for me.

[52:37] So, Jay-Jay, as a distributor, is there anything you think, if you give any advice to the

[52:45] manufacturers out there in terms of like what you're seeing consumer demand be for themes

[52:50] and titles, do you think there's enough variety of themes for the kinds of families that

[52:54] walk into your showroom?

[52:56] Yeah.

[52:57] The one thing I see that's a little bit limited on my showroom right now is there is nothing

[53:02] for the kids right now.

[53:05] Ghostbusters is probably the closest thing to it.

[53:08] And, in the past, it's done kids theme shrek and things like that.

[53:13] They're kind of overdue for a good Disney game.

[53:16] But that doesn't really in demand for the general collectors.

[53:21] You and I are probably not going to buy a frozen pinball machine.

[53:25] We're just not going to do it.

[53:26] It doesn't have any interest in it.

[53:27] And there are pinball collectors who will buy it for their kids to keep their wives happy,

[53:30] their kids happy at home.

[53:32] But the general pinball community is going to buy a frozen L.E. pinball machine.

[53:37] Yeah, I mean Brenda would make me buy a frozen super L.E. like Olaf edition.

[53:42] I would say she would force me to buy that.

[53:45] But I agree.

[53:46] I think there's, and Jersey Jack's trying to fill that void of sort of family friendly

[53:51] titles.

[53:52] I think the challenge is what kids love is not really brought to market in pinball.

[54:00] It's like they bring themes that parents love when they were kids.

[54:06] For example, the Jetsons.

[54:07] As I look at that title, it's four kids and families.

[54:13] But there's no kids that are into the Jetsons these days.

[54:17] So it's kind of a shame that there isn't that crossover title.

[54:22] Now, if I were to look at a crossover theme that I think Star Wars kind of does it.

[54:26] All kids are in the Star Wars.

[54:30] It seems like it's just as popular nowadays as it ever was.

[54:34] It seems that Toy Story is a rumored theme for Jersey Jack.

[54:38] And if that comes out, I think that can be another title that transcends both generations.

[54:43] Do you think Stern, from what I'm hearing, Stern's upcoming titles, are definitely not

[54:48] going to be family friendly kid roms.

[54:52] I think they're going to be much more geared towards the older male demographic.

[55:00] From the rumors I've heard as well, I would agree with that.

[55:04] Stern has really done well on going on their mid to high 30s to 60-year-old age group.

[55:11] That's been their bread and butter.

[55:13] And they've done well with the hair bands, the bands from that.

[55:16] And they've done well on the kind of cult themes like Ghostbusters and that kind of stuff.

[55:22] How's Metallica doing?

[55:23] And that's how I'm talking Aerosmith.

[55:24] Sorry, I mean Aerosmith is doing well.

[55:27] I started off a little slow, but once people got the touch of feeling and play it, it's

[55:30] really picked up.

[55:31] And I'm getting shipments in once a week or so and they're going right back out.

[55:36] I finally managed to get an LED on my showroom floor.

[55:39] I got a shipment of pros in that came in yesterday morning or day before.

[55:44] And I was hoping to get one of those on my showroom floor, but it's looking like those

[55:48] are going to sell out probably tomorrow.

[55:50] And I'm going to be back to being back ordered off of again.

[55:53] It's, you know, I really think Aerosmith is going to be one of those sleeper hits of

[55:57] the year that nobody really saw coming.

[56:00] Everyone was sort of complaining about the theme.

[56:02] And the more people play it, I've been reading the Pinside Threads.

[56:06] It's just this game's fun, this game's fun.

[56:08] This could be one of Borg's best games ever.

[56:10] So yeah, it looks great too.

[56:13] I think it's actually Stern's best art package ever.

[56:16] And I love Zombie 80 to Death and I love Ghostbusters.

[56:18] But I think Donnie just crushed it on Aerosmith.

[56:22] I'm going to go with Ghostbusters being a better art package because I like the Ghostbusters

[56:26] a little more than I like the Aerosmith.

[56:27] But I was really surprised.

[56:29] I was one of the guys out there who told you that dirty Donnie and Aerosmiths don't

[56:33] mix.

[56:34] That's like oil and water.

[56:36] But Donnie did it and that shows that the strength in his art work and his ability to really

[56:41] do something with it because I would never have thought that dirty Donnie and Aerosmith

[56:45] as an art package would click.

[56:47] Right.

[56:48] Let's talk about probably the most prevalent thing people talk about when it comes to buying

[56:53] Pimmel machines.

[56:54] And that's the price of Pimmel machines these days.

[56:58] What are your thoughts on where the prices are going?

[57:01] Do you feel the prices are turning more people off from Pimball or do you think there's still

[57:08] a good enough variety of entry points to keep it viable for people that come into game

[57:16] exchange?

[57:17] So, your general buyers, both used and new Pimbles have gotten expensive.

[57:22] As new Pimbles go up so to use Pimbles, and use Pimbles I'm sure as you guys have seen

[57:27] they've been increasing at a faster rate than new Pimbles have it.

[57:31] You know, it's hard to find a decent DMD title out there for less than two grand.

[57:37] And that's hard because your general buyer who wants to come in and get into Pimball wants

[57:42] something that's 5 to 10 years old with a decent theme that you can buy the family.

[57:48] But he doesn't want to spend $3,500 on it.

[57:51] And that's unfortunately where that has kind of become now.

[57:53] By the time I put the 30 hours of labor into it to get it on my share on floor and the

[57:57] LED kit to make it look pretty and you know, do all those things.

[58:03] I'm having a charge $3,500 for a $5, $7, $8, $10 year old DMD title and that's hard because

[58:11] I'm buying them based on the same prices that are being sold on Pinside out there.

[58:15] Right.

[58:17] And then what about just the price of premiums and LEDs now and everything's getting

[58:22] that $8,000, $9,000 range.

[58:26] Are you getting less people interested at that price point or yours?

[58:31] I've always said guys who can spend $7,000 can spend $9 on the Pimball.

[58:34] For me, I love these guys.

[58:37] My limit's $6,500.

[58:39] That's $7,000.

[58:40] You know, it's like, come on.

[58:41] Really?

[58:43] I've certainly seen guys that have gotten out of, either gotten out of Pimball or stepped

[58:48] back to premiums who are always LE guys or guys that were premium guys that would flip

[58:52] back to pros because let's face it, most of us have a significant other.

[58:58] We have to answer two for our addictions.

[59:01] And I heard a guy tell me one last year at T.P.F.

[59:05] He says he brings his wife to T.P.F.

[59:06] She goes across the street to them all for two days.

[59:08] It costs them $3,000.

[59:09] Now he just bought an LE for me.

[59:11] He goes to the show.

[59:13] Now he's going to have to buy her a car or something just to keep her happy.

[59:17] We all have somebody to answer to.

[59:19] It's a double head sorbid.

[59:21] You've got to buy a new furniture set for the wife to keep her happy.

[59:24] You've got to buy her new Louis Vuitton purse.

[59:27] That's not the only cost on it.

[59:33] It adds up quick too.

[59:34] I'm looking at what I'm considering.

[59:37] Obviously I'm really excited about the next-dirt title coming out.

[59:40] I'm also considering a dialed in.

[59:45] I look at it now and it's like, wow, you can literally spend, you can buy three games

[59:52] and spend the price of a Honda Civic Type R.

[59:55] It's like three pinball machines.

[59:59] They will probably hold their value better than the car.

[01:00:02] But for me that's sort of what I struggle with is.

[01:00:05] There's a point of diminishing return in terms of the fun factor.

[01:00:10] Once you start getting into that level where you've got $100,000 in your game room, and

[01:00:18] is it giving you the satisfaction of having that much invested?

[01:00:24] I agree.

[01:00:25] It's an addiction and it's a hard one to shake.

[01:00:27] I don't know how to shake it.

[01:00:29] The only thing that keeps my addiction at bay is I have a one bedroom apartment in New

[01:00:34] York City.

[01:00:35] You're limited not necessarily by money but by space and others out there.

[01:00:39] Exactly.

[01:00:40] It is a blessing in disguise because Brenda will tell you this.

[01:00:48] If I had another room it would have eight pinball machines in it by now.

[01:00:53] I'm thankful that this limitation keeps my addiction at bay because I see guys.

[01:01:00] Some guys sent me pictures last night of this.

[01:01:02] It's like you walk into his house and there's just games everywhere, right in the entry

[01:01:06] way.

[01:01:07] It's just incredible.

[01:01:09] But I think it's a really fun hobby to be a part of it.

[01:01:15] What are your thoughts on all these manufacturers?

[01:01:18] You handle two manufacturers who have deep pockets who know what they're doing.

[01:01:22] Do you think all these guys are going to survive the next few years?

[01:01:28] I think you're going to see maybe one out of three of them survive that are currently

[01:01:34] of the smaller manufacturers kind of upstarted manufacturers.

[01:01:37] I think you're going to see one out of three of those survive.

[01:01:41] I won't say necessarily which one I think it's going to be but I think you're only going

[01:01:46] to see one.

[01:01:49] I agree.

[01:01:50] I don't know if we agree on this, which one we're talking about.

[01:01:55] The more I look at just how difficult it is to actually manufacture a pinball machine

[01:02:01] from the ground up, that coupled with the fact that Stern is just this monster with all

[01:02:08] these great themes and the cadence at which they release.

[01:02:13] You're just getting hit by eight blows in a row by the time you can get one machine out

[01:02:16] the door.

[01:02:17] I think it's going to be hard.

[01:02:19] I think also what's going to make it much harder for these new companies to succeed.

[01:02:24] I really think Stern has up their game.

[01:02:29] I say that because I think a few years ago, Stern was kind of cut in corners and mailing

[01:02:34] in a little bit and they weren't quite investing in making the machines as amazing as they

[01:02:39] could and they woke up.

[01:02:41] They woke up.

[01:02:42] Now it's like the arts grade.

[01:02:43] The LCD is great.

[01:02:46] Now there's even a mirrored backlash on Aerospace.

[01:02:49] They're listening to what people demand for the money and they're delivering.

[01:02:54] I just think it's going to get better and better.

[01:02:57] I agree.

[01:02:58] I think the Pinball community owes a lot to Jack for that.

[01:03:01] Is he proved to Stern that you really can sell a machine for $7,000 and still do it.

[01:03:07] Before that, nobody thought that could be done.

[01:03:10] Why do you think...

[01:03:12] Again, as a car nut, why do people think that way about pinball?

[01:03:18] Because I've always said it.

[01:03:21] There needs to be a Rolls Royce or Bugatti in Pinball.

[01:03:25] Look, J-Pop had the right idea.

[01:03:26] That was J-Pop.

[01:03:28] He sold out in one day without even a machine at 16 grand.

[01:03:36] I think the market is wide open for that super high-end machine.

[01:03:40] Look, if Stern wants to make it, they could easily make it.

[01:03:45] Imagine if Stern said, we're going to make just 100 Jaws machines and there are going

[01:03:49] to be $50,000 each.

[01:03:54] I think they sell.

[01:03:55] I really do.

[01:03:56] They proved they could do the Ferrari or the Bugatti with the Batman Super-Eli.

[01:04:04] They proved that they could successfully market that and make it happen.

[01:04:08] You told me five years ago you were going to do it for $15,000 and sell 80 machines.

[01:04:14] I would argue that they sold everyone.

[01:04:23] I think that Stern's next super-Eli has to bring more to the table.

[01:04:30] I've been talking to super-Eli guys and they're all kind of like, yeah, they're like,

[01:04:35] yeah, I'm happy, but there's that butt.

[01:04:38] When you buy a Bugatti or Rolls Royce, you can't have the butts.

[01:04:42] I think Stern, I think they tested the market.

[01:04:46] I think they found the market.

[01:04:48] What they're going to have to do next time around is just get the quality of those super-Eli's

[01:04:54] and put stuff in it that really feels special and unique versus just cosmetic only.

[01:05:01] Look, but part of me is like, man, but Chris, what are you talking about?

[01:05:05] They don't even need to do that because they just proved that they didn't need to do

[01:05:07] that.

[01:05:08] It's like, you never know.

[01:05:10] I hope they do.

[01:05:11] When I look at a dialed in, that feels $15,000 plus next to a super-Eli Batman.

[01:05:19] I think they need to differentiate the model.

[01:05:21] Certainly, more than I think that's what you're saying.

[01:05:22] They need to have.

[01:05:23] Chicago Gaming, planetary, did that on the Tech-Vomars LE.

[01:05:29] That came with a beautiful top and mere blades and extra lighting features.

[01:05:34] There's extra differentiation there that I would like to see continue in the market

[01:05:38] from all manufacturers where instead of just a little powder coating and a beard back

[01:05:43] class and things like that, that both Jack and Stern does, maybe they could come out with

[01:05:50] the interactive lighting around the lights, interactive toppers, under-cab lighting,

[01:05:58] leg lighting, some more things to differentiate the games.

[01:06:01] It's just a nice badge as a powder coat.

[01:06:05] When I was talking to Gomez, what was interesting, and I think Stern is exploring this, is when

[01:06:11] you go into order a Porsche, you can put whatever you want on it and you can almost double

[01:06:15] the price of your 9.11, I think Stern will continue to allow customers to customize their

[01:06:22] machines and even make certain customizations exclusive to those LE and super-Eli buyers.

[01:06:31] That would, again, because if you're spending $15,000, I think those guys too don't just

[01:06:37] want to have the same exact game as everyone else at that price point because at that level

[01:06:45] customization is what you should get with your machine.

[01:06:49] But I get why it's hard because Stern's also very successful because of the assembly line.

[01:06:55] For that premium price, that game's got to be yanked off the line and it's got to have

[01:07:00] white club service sort of implementing those mods.

[01:07:03] But that's just like autos like that.

[01:07:05] That's what AMG does.

[01:07:06] They don't, they're a separate entity within Mercedes.

[01:07:09] They're going to have to have a building.

[01:07:11] They have the building.

[01:07:12] They have multiple lines to build.

[01:07:13] Maybe they need to have a line that's the custom line.

[01:07:15] Yep.

[01:07:16] Take a separate building.

[01:07:17] The guys at Pinball for Refinery prove there is a market there for that.

[01:07:22] All of us contributors have done a couple of those, but those guys did far more of the

[01:07:27] Refinery additions and things that you could pick options and things on.

[01:07:32] And it'd be kind of nice to see Stern get into that market.

[01:07:37] But they would have to be able to do it in their current line and they either need to

[01:07:41] do it or they don't.

[01:07:42] But maybe you let, once again, have the start accessories, then have the distributors installing

[01:07:47] those like you do with card dealerships where your mud flaps and your remote start module

[01:07:53] and your spoiler are all dealer accessories.

[01:07:57] Right.

[01:07:58] Well, I agree.

[01:07:59] And I think maybe one day Stern will partner with a Pinball Refinery too because Shelby is

[01:08:05] a separate entity from Ford and then they've combined forces.

[01:08:10] Let's see.

[01:08:11] So JJ, what advice would you give listeners of this show who don't want to get left out

[01:08:17] on the next new hot titles coming down the road?

[01:08:20] Should they contact you?

[01:08:23] Should they wait?

[01:08:24] What's the, should they call around to see like how many people are on certain lists?

[01:08:28] Like what is your advice for people who want to get in on stuff?

[01:08:32] So talk to the distributor you trust.

[01:08:34] Whether that's me or whether it's one of the other guys.

[01:08:37] I know I'm not everybody's first distributor because they've worked with other guys and

[01:08:40] they trust other guys and I got to respect that.

[01:08:43] So talk to your strippers.

[01:08:44] But when you're kind of asking these guys, find out how many people are on their list.

[01:08:48] If they won't tell you many people on their list and if they won't tell you how many

[01:08:52] L.E.'s in the past they've gotten and what they're expecting on this, that's of concern

[01:08:57] because you could get left out at it.

[01:09:01] And remember it's a bit of a red flag if they're asking you for money right now because

[01:09:05] they're really not supposed to be.

[01:09:09] And it could result in them getting a lower allocation if the manufacturers find out.

[01:09:16] Right.

[01:09:17] Okay.

[01:09:18] That's good advice for listeners out there.

[01:09:21] You guys know it's common.

[01:09:22] You better be picking up the phones.

[01:09:23] I mean, I don't want to hear any cry babies come May 4th and everyone's like, I didn't

[01:09:27] know this was coming out.

[01:09:28] And we've been telling you for a long time.

[01:09:31] Now do you think Stern is taking it to the Star Wars Convention next week like anything

[01:09:34] like a video or anything?

[01:09:36] No, I think their original plan was to do something at that show but things didn't work

[01:09:42] out in that way.

[01:09:44] And it kind of leaked out that this was happening and it wasn't.

[01:09:47] I've talked to my contacts as Stern and it was given permission to go on to Penn Science.

[01:09:52] They listened guys.

[01:09:53] It's not happening because I had several customers.

[01:09:55] One guy in DC who was telling me he's going to drive down and get the show because he wants

[01:09:59] to check it out and he's a big star wars nut.

[01:10:01] So he's like, I'll enjoy the show anyhow.

[01:10:03] I'll make the 16 hour drive down to Florida and check the game out.

[01:10:06] And I'm thinking, man, if this isn't happening, how angry would you be if you just drove 16

[01:10:10] hours to see something and it's not there?

[01:10:11] Yeah.

[01:10:12] So I reached out to Stern and asked that question and I was told, I sure that they would not

[01:10:17] be going to the show there and that it was on the plan list but it never come to fruition.

[01:10:25] All right.

[01:10:26] Well, listeners, you heard it there.

[01:10:28] And I heard the same thing too.

[01:10:30] Even though I put up my Star Wars podcast a few days ago confirming it.

[01:10:35] Here's what I heard.

[01:10:37] And this is where my sources are telling me is that was the original plan that Disney

[01:10:43] wanted them to be part of it and the game.

[01:10:48] They're just not ready quite yet.

[01:10:51] But I also heard the real reason is and look, this makes sense.

[01:10:58] They still want to sell Erasmith and they want the spotlight to be an Erasmith for a

[01:11:02] little bit longer because they know they could announce Star Wars whenever and it doesn't

[01:11:08] matter.

[01:11:09] But if they go too far in front, now they will hurt Erasmith sales.

[01:11:14] So what's the point of doing that?

[01:11:17] I do think that May 4th though there will be the teaser video.

[01:11:22] They can't not be on that day.

[01:11:25] You think May 4th, JJ will see that little like whatever they put together with Disney

[01:11:30] to just tease what's coming?

[01:11:32] I think you'll see a teaser video somewhere around that time.

[01:11:36] And then a little more concrete information probably up a period after that.

[01:11:42] Is the rumor some June July?

[01:11:44] Are we thinking?

[01:11:45] I don't think it's going to be that far out.

[01:11:47] Usually in a history of Stern, it's usually teaser video and usually it's three to seven

[01:11:52] days away from full release.

[01:11:56] That's how they usually do it.

[01:11:58] Well, when you say release, full announcement, right?

[01:12:01] You see the whole game and everything.

[01:12:03] I'm talking game shipping.

[01:12:06] I think you're accurate.

[01:12:07] I think in history of Stern, that's about right.

[01:12:10] Usually they're 30 to 45 days away from production when they release the pictures and that

[01:12:16] kind of stuff.

[01:12:17] Well, JJ, this has been great.

[01:12:20] We were at the hour mark.

[01:12:21] I always try to keep these interviews around an hour, also just to respect my guests and

[01:12:25] give you guys your evenings back so your wives don't break up with you because you're

[01:12:29] talking on Pimbal Podcast.

[01:12:31] JJ, I want to really thank you for being on the show.

[01:12:33] I also just want to thank you for being just an amazing dude, a complete class act, a

[01:12:39] gentleman.

[01:12:40] It was great seeing you at T.P.F. and I was so happy when you pulled your list up and

[01:12:45] I was on it and I'll tell you why because it is nerve-wracking when you call people

[01:12:49] up really early and you express interest and then people tell you, yeah, you're on the

[01:12:53] list but you never really feel you're on a list because you haven't given any money.

[01:12:58] I didn't give you any money and I just gave you my wishes and man, it was so awesome.

[01:13:06] JJ whips out his iPad and he's got the list and it's like money doesn't infiltrate his

[01:13:13] word which I just have to commend you for being such a stand up guy when it comes to this

[01:13:18] stuff.

[01:13:19] Cool.

[01:13:20] Thank you for that and thanks for having me on the show.

[01:13:21] It was a good time.

[01:13:22] I always like to talk Pimbal.

[01:13:24] All right.

[01:13:25] And listener of the show, JJ is your guy.

[01:13:27] I mean he's being bashful about it but if you want to go in and find a great distributor

[01:13:31] that you can build a relationship with for years, this guy is your man and it don't matter

[01:13:35] where you live.

[01:13:37] You can live anywhere.

[01:13:38] He'll get you your game.

[01:13:40] So check out the Game Exchange and Denver Colorado.

[01:13:44] Make sure you look up Game Exchange and Denver Colorado because I know there's some like Game

[01:13:48] Exchange website that just buys old video games.

[01:13:50] That's not them.

[01:13:54] What's the website for Game Exchange?

[01:13:56] Game Exchange dot biz dot B.I.Z.

[01:13:59] Okay.

[01:14:00] Easy and not.

[01:14:01] All right.

[01:14:02] Well JJ, thanks for your time.

[01:14:03] We're going to get this up pretty soon and I'm excited.

[01:14:05] I think it's a great year for Stern and you're one of the top dogs and I think business is

[01:14:11] going to be booming and we look forward to talking to you again soon.

[01:14:16] Definitely buddy and talk to you again soon as well.

[01:14:18] All right JJ.

[01:14:19] All right.

[01:14:20] All right.

[01:14:21] All right.

[01:14:22] All right.

[01:14:23] All right.

[01:14:24] All right.

[01:14:25] All right.

[01:14:26] All right.
