[00:00] You can bet your bottom dollar in time, you're gonna be mine.

[00:05] Just like I should, I'll get you good.

[00:09] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up.

[00:13] Ah, welcome to Gnata's Bimbal podcast.

[00:16] It's Friday, I thought, by today.

[00:19] We would have seen people unboxing this James Bond 60th edition, right?

[00:24] The game is supposed to be on the line this week.

[00:27] I thought somebody with their Porsche or their Ferrari, who's wealthy enough, would have

[00:32] paid someone to go to Stern and pick up their game for them.

[00:36] So we're still waiting on gameplay for this super-duper expensive single-level James Bond

[00:43] game with absolutely no movie assets in the entire game itself other than the ugly artwork.

[00:50] Look, I just want to say this for the record.

[00:53] I don't think it's inappropriate if you're talking to Keith Elwyn to ask him, hey, what

[00:58] do you think of the price of this game?

[01:00] Because I want to hear Keith Elwyn say it.

[01:02] I want to hear him articulate how he sees $20,000 in value in this game.

[01:10] Of course, he doesn't want to be asked that question, and it's the first question I'm

[01:15] gonna ask him when I see him maybe at Texas Bimbal Festival.

[01:20] Are you ready?

[01:21] It is God.

[01:22] His cargo shorts ready.

[01:23] All right, so look, this game has not shipped yet.

[01:25] We should see it probably next week.

[01:28] And here we are heading into mid-February, Super Bowl weekend.

[01:32] We got Valentine's Day next week.

[01:34] When are we gonna see the next unboxing?

[01:38] I think it's gonna be this James Bond game.

[01:40] And I also think Spooky Pimbal looks like they are very close, and I mean very close,

[01:46] to getting this Scooby-Doo and the first runs of this game out to some consumers and

[01:50] operators.

[01:52] And I want to say this, I've been looking at these production photos of Scooby-Doo, and

[01:56] the game looks good, people.

[01:58] I love the colors.

[01:59] I just love the way the game looks.

[02:01] Look, I don't know how it plays yet.

[02:03] I haven't flipped it, but this is what a Pimbal machine, just from a visual standpoint.

[02:08] This is the kind of game we want in Pimbal.

[02:11] Bright.

[02:12] Colorful.

[02:13] A welcoming theme that everybody knows.

[02:16] And I just love it, that we're gonna get Scooby-Doo versus the dark, slow, dramatic

[02:24] world of Godfather, versus Galactic Tank Force by American Pimbal.

[02:29] I'm here to tell you right now, I reached out to David Fix, and he's confirming that

[02:34] this game is coming out in March.

[02:37] And I asked him, I said, hey man, can we get some teasers to this game?

[02:40] And he said that he would send me the teasers when they are ready.

[02:45] So I look forward to seeing this game.

[02:47] I think what's gonna be really funny is we're gonna get Godfather versus Galactic Tank Force,

[02:53] the Double G's, both with art packages by Christopher Franchi.

[02:58] Like we've, have we ever seen this before in the history of Pimbal, where you had one

[03:02] Pimbal artist working on two separate company games, and they're coming out at exactly the

[03:09] same time.

[03:11] It's going to be interesting to see how this all plays out.

[03:14] Like I still love that people are holding on to this dream that Eric Minier's game is

[03:20] not going to be Godfather.

[03:23] I saw on Napsarcade something that I've been telling everybody for a long time, and that

[03:28] is that Avatar has been optioned out as a Pimbal machine.

[03:32] And I think I told you guys this story that I was presenting to John Landau, who's basically

[03:38] the executive producer of the Avatar movies.

[03:41] He owns like Light Storm Production.

[03:44] He's friends with Leonard Abbas.

[03:46] So if we are going to see an Avatar Pimbal machine, I fully expected to be a Jersey Jack

[03:53] machine.

[03:54] But I want to ask each and every one of you a question.

[03:57] Who really wants an Avatar 2 Pimbal machine?

[04:00] I mean this.

[04:02] Like the movie was okay.

[04:04] I enjoyed it, but I don't want to see it again.

[04:08] It didn't leave this indelible impression on me the way the first Avatar movie did.

[04:13] I think I saw the first Avatar movie like seven times in the theater.

[04:17] Like it blew our minds seeing that movie for the first time.

[04:21] This movie, I don't think it's going to catch on culturally, and I don't care what the box

[04:25] office says.

[04:26] And I think if Jersey Jack makes Avatar 2, I think it's going to go down a lot like

[04:32] The Hobbit.

[04:33] You know, it's like Jack has no luck licensing movie properties where he thinks it's going

[04:38] to be a huge blockbuster hit.

[04:41] And this is the thing about Avatar 2.

[04:43] It's just like The Hobbit.

[04:44] The box office numbers are phenomenal because every geek will go see it.

[04:50] But it's not about whether or not the movie made money.

[04:54] Did that movie emotionally really grab people and click with them?

[04:59] And I'm going to say this, the much better movie to make is Maverick.

[05:04] Whoever makes Top Gun Maverick as a Pimbal machine, I'm here to tell you right now I

[05:09] am buying that game.

[05:10] I am buying Big Trouble in Little China.

[05:13] I am buying Fifth Element.

[05:14] You know, I'm buying The Last Starfighter.

[05:16] I have a list of like really nerdy themes that I would love to see made into a Pimbal

[05:21] machine but Maverick's not even nerdy.

[05:24] It's just mainstream.

[05:26] Now the big hurdle will be Tom Cruise.

[05:28] Will he want his name, image and likeness to be in a Pimbal machine?

[05:32] I'm not sure.

[05:33] And that's going to be the big hurdle to overcome.

[05:36] But again, if you're Mr. Abbas, like the billionaires all know each other.

[05:40] Like he has more money than Tom Cruise.

[05:43] Isn't that crazy?

[05:44] And I bet there's like a billionaire phone where you just pick it up and it connects

[05:48] you to any other billionaire in the world or 500 millionaire or 800 millionaire and

[05:54] you can talk to them over like an expensive glass of cognac and you can explain to Tom

[06:00] like Tom, you've conquered the movie world but you should conquer the Pimbal world and

[06:06] you've never been immortalized in the right way in a Pimbal machine and I think he would

[06:11] bite.

[06:12] So look, we've got Scooby Doo shipping any day now.

[06:16] We've got this James Bond 60th shipping and I really hope you guys unbox something you

[06:20] enjoy because you haven't seen any gameplay footage.

[06:23] I still think it's crazy.

[06:25] What else is going on in the Pimbal world?

[06:27] Well did you see this expensive topper from Lior for Guns N' Roses?

[06:31] Guess who didn't see it?

[06:32] I didn't even get a chance to see it because the video was taken down, the images were

[06:38] taken down and apparently there is copyright issues with Guns N' Roses and this topper.

[06:44] So here's what I was told the topper looks like.

[06:46] It is Axl Rose, it is his skull and then there's I guess two revolvers behind him and then

[06:52] a crowd behind him and there's like 300 and something LED lights.

[06:57] If there is a game that does not need more LED lights, it is Guns N' Roses and the lights

[07:04] on the playfield are amazing but I don't think we need more LEDs on the topper.

[07:11] So he wants to make 350 of these things at $2300 of pop and look I did the calculations

[07:20] and I know he's not going to profit this that is $805,000.

[07:26] Now let's just say he's charging you double his cost.

[07:30] So he's making $400,000 just on this topper alone.

[07:37] That's more money than Eric Minier makes than Keith Elwin makes.

[07:42] Like that is insane and I guess it just begs the question and this is interesting for the

[07:47] entire mod world is for some of these modders who are getting very, very close if not crossing

[07:55] the line into IP infringement should they be allowed to make so much money by sticking

[08:02] something onto someone else's game.

[08:05] I mean we're at the point now where some of these modders I think are actually making

[08:09] more money than the designers and if you're these pinball companies I know you can't stop

[08:14] people from modding your games and I think some of the mods out there are absolutely amazing.

[08:19] I love a lot of the mods for Batman and Godzilla.

[08:23] I love the mods for Lord of the Rings.

[08:25] There is just great mods for almost any game and I know some people hate mods and I'm just

[08:30] curious what people think.

[08:32] Email me at canadapinball at gmail.com.

[08:35] Do you think someone should be allowed to sort of rip off the Axl Rose skull image that

[08:40] the artist made for the GNR game and you're going to sell this thing at $2300 and also

[08:47] like look.

[08:48] Leor knows what he's doing and he knows the FOMO right?

[08:51] He's only going to make $350?

[08:54] Like he knows that there are 500 CEs.

[08:57] He knows there's 5000 Ellies but man I'm in the wrong industry.

[09:02] Like pinball podcast isn't making me much money.

[09:05] $5 a month people struggle to pay.

[09:08] This guy's going to make more than most of our salaries just on one single topper mod.

[09:14] Wow.

[09:15] We all should probably get into the mod business people.

[09:17] It can't be that hard to do this stuff.

[09:20] And I will say this.

[09:21] All of these pinball sculpts they're so overpriced.

[09:25] Do me a favor.

[09:26] Go look at sideshow collectibles.

[09:28] Go look at all the different anime sculptures that are out there and see how much money

[09:34] they cost, how detailed they are.

[09:37] $2300.

[09:40] That was the price of Twilight Zone when it was brand new.

[09:44] So we'll see what happens.

[09:45] We'll see if he's allowed to sell this thing.

[09:47] It's an interesting story that they yanked down everything.

[09:50] Do you want to know another ridiculous thing I saw?

[09:52] There is a Lord of the Rings, a standard edition Lord of the Rings pinball machine new in box

[09:59] on pinside.

[10:00] Guess how much money this gentleman wants.

[10:02] And that game has been in a box since I think 2004.

[10:06] The thing has been sitting in a box for freaking almost 20 years.

[10:12] And he wants $22,500 for a new in box Lord of the Rings.

[10:19] It's not even an LE and his big selling point is it comes with the little plastic figures

[10:24] that the LE doesn't have.

[10:26] And let me tell you right now.

[10:27] You can buy those little plastic figures for like 50 bucks and they're still available.

[10:33] So what happens when you unbox a $22,500 Lord of the Rings game?

[10:39] Isn't it immediately become worth like $8,000 and isn't the only value that it's still

[10:45] in a box?

[10:46] And then it begs the question, will pinball, will some pinball collectors look at this

[10:51] like toy collectors?

[10:53] You know there's toy collectors out there.

[10:54] There's toy collectors out there that they love the stuff that's still sealed in the

[10:58] cardboard box as it was shipped to toy stores.

[11:01] Like they don't even want to open up that box, let alone get to the pristine toys underneath

[11:06] the cardboard box.

[11:08] Like this is just ridiculous.

[11:09] Like these are toys meant to be played.

[11:11] And the moment you unbox that game you just lost over $10,000.

[11:16] So I don't understand why someone would price it at that.

[11:18] If you were to ask me what is a new in box Lord of the Rings worth, I would say at most,

[11:25] at most $10,000.

[11:28] At most.

[11:29] Again, I wouldn't even want one.

[11:31] Why would you want a new in box game like that?

[11:34] Wouldn't you want to play it?

[11:35] I'd rather have one that's been set up, that's been kept in good condition, that everything's

[11:40] been dialed in, and then you get to enjoy it.

[11:44] I'm going to use a car argument.

[11:45] It's like buying a used car with like 50 miles on it.

[11:48] You can't drive it because the reason you paid so much for it was because it only had

[11:52] 50 miles.

[11:54] I'd rather get a car with 15,000 miles that's so much cheaper but the same car and the same

[12:00] experience and then go beat on it for the rest of my life because we're all going to

[12:04] die.

[12:05] That's the thing.

[12:06] It's like these things are toys.

[12:07] Like you have to enjoy them and best believe people.

[12:11] The moment Canada has a house, I'm going to unbox my guns and roses.

[12:16] Derek is going to fly from Texas and help me set it up.

[12:19] I'm going to set up my Batman 66 SLE and I'm going to play pinball every single day I can

[12:26] until the day I die.

[12:28] I don't like the fact that I don't have a pinball machine in my home right now.

[12:32] I envy you guys who can wake up in your tidy whiteies, put on your Scooby-Doo slippers at

[12:39] three in the morning and go downstairs, crack open a beer and start playing pinball.

[12:45] That sounds so amazing to me.

[12:48] If you spent a week in my Gucci shoes, you probably would be so bored because the routine

[12:54] is pretty damn claustrophobic and you know you married the right wife when you're not

[12:59] killing each other in a one bedroom in which your baby who's almost two, Killian's going

[13:05] to be two years old, the 26th of this month, he's in the same bedroom with you.

[13:10] So it's been a very, very interesting two years.

[13:13] I love Brenda, so thank you for putting up with me, Brenda.

[13:16] Now look, we've got high price games left and right.

[13:19] Let me throw out a scenario because we've got a lot of high price games.

[13:22] If you were to say, Chris, I'm going to give you $20,000 and you have to buy one pinball

[13:27] machine.

[13:28] The answer for me is simply this.

[13:29] I would not go anywhere near this James Bond and again, I know this is a huge amount of

[13:35] money to spend, but I'm just telling you right now, if I was going to buy anything between

[13:39] 15 and 20,000, I would probably buy one game and there really is only one game at that

[13:46] high, high price point that I look at still to this day with some envy.

[13:52] I look at this game and it's beautiful.

[13:54] Every time I see this game, it makes me smile.

[13:56] I think they nailed it and I think this game is one of the most beautiful looking pinball

[14:01] machines ever and I hear from owners it's one of the best shooting pinball machines

[14:06] ever and the reason why this is one of the greatest stern machines of all time is simply

[14:12] this.

[14:13] It's because Stern didn't even make it.

[14:16] The reason this game has one of the greatest mechs in all of pinball is because Stern didn't

[14:22] make it and that is Elvira 40th anniversary.

[14:26] This game is unbelievable looking.

[14:29] I'm really struggling not to get one right now.

[14:31] I know it's $20,000, but Dennis Nordman made this game on his own and he will tell you

[14:39] Stern pinball yanked stuff out of this game.

[14:43] He originally had like the wavy ramps like in whitewater and Stern yanked that stuff

[14:48] out.

[14:50] He will tell you over beers what he originally had in this game.

[14:53] Now that does not take away from the game itself, but man that's it.

[14:57] If I had $15,000 to $20,000 burning a hole in my pocket, I would absolutely go get an

[15:03] Elvira 40th.

[15:04] And I think you could probably get one for like $18,000.

[15:07] I see a lot of them around $20,000 new in box and it's also another situation.

[15:12] I would probably just get one opened up, right?

[15:16] Because again, the moment you open it up, you're losing money.

[15:19] And also for these collectors who have it, they're not putting thousands of plays on

[15:23] these games.

[15:24] They're only putting a few hundred.

[15:25] All right, so everybody, what do we think Stern's next game is?

[15:28] What do you think?

[15:29] I want you to email me at canadapinball at gmail.com what you think the next game is

[15:34] from Stern pinball.

[15:35] I'm starting to think it's going to be Foo Fighters.

[15:38] I think it's going to be Jack Danger's next game.

[15:40] I feel like he's been more vocal lately on social media about designing the game, about

[15:45] not being at T.P.F. about the stresses and the pressures.

[15:49] And I've talked to Jack Danger.

[15:51] I love Jack Danger.

[15:52] He's a good friend.

[15:53] And I know he's nervous, right?

[15:55] And I bet he's nervous because of dudes like me.

[15:58] Because the moment he releases this game, he is going to be open to criticism.

[16:04] And Jack Danger's not really used to this, right?

[16:07] I mean, he made the Jurassic Park home version.

[16:10] And what a great game that was, right?

[16:12] But nobody looked at that game with real high, high expectations, right?

[16:17] And a $5,000 pinball machine or whatever that game costs, that doesn't invite the larger

[16:23] community to give feedback on, right?

[16:26] It's not designed for those people.

[16:28] But now that Jack Danger is making a cornerstone game, like he is going to be open to the entire

[16:34] community's feedback, good and bad.

[16:36] And I think what's going to be interesting is if it is Foo Fighters, right?

[16:41] If it is Foo Fighters, for a lot of people, this game is going to be criticized more for

[16:47] the theme than the design.

[16:49] And look, if it is Foo Fighters 2, I bet he made it with the band themselves and Dave

[16:53] Grohl.

[16:54] And I bet he's like really happy.

[16:56] And I bet he's over the moon to have that opportunity.

[17:00] Because it's still the Foo Fighters.

[17:01] Like they've done more than most of us have done in our lives.

[17:04] And it's easier for us sitting in offices and PR agencies to criticize a band that sold

[17:09] like 20 million albums, you know, and also was one of the original founding members of

[17:13] Nirvana.

[17:15] But the thing is this, you got to read the room.

[17:18] And whenever I do surveys, like what themes do you want to see?

[17:22] Godfather always at the bottom.

[17:24] Foo Fighters always at the bottom.

[17:26] And why, if you're going to put all the effort into making a pinball machine, would you make

[17:31] a theme that doesn't have a ton of following in the pinball world?

[17:35] A ton of enthusiasm in the pinball world.

[17:38] We are one month away people.

[17:40] Are you ready for this?

[17:41] Because not everything is going to be launched at TPF.

[17:44] So let's go down real quick and summarize what we're going to see over the next month

[17:48] and a half.

[17:49] We're going to see American Pinball's Galactic Tank Force.

[17:52] Chicago Gaming Company and Raw Thrill's are probably going to show us Pulp Fiction.

[17:57] It is going to be a single level Mark Richie designed game.

[18:00] I've been saying it for like a year and a half now.

[18:03] Jersey Jack Pinball is going to come out with its next machine.

[18:06] Knowing Jersey Jack, I kind of feel like they might delay past TPF.

[18:10] You know, I told you you were going to see Jersey Jack number 8, February 20th.

[18:14] I'm probably going to be wrong because Jersey Jack is always late on their stuff.

[18:20] We might see Multimorphic's new Scott Denisi game.

[18:23] The pinball brothers are going to be showing up with Queens.

[18:26] Spooky's going to be bringing Scooby-Doo.

[18:28] Stern Pinball is going to bring its next game.

[18:31] The one I don't get is this Turner Pinball.

[18:34] Turner Pinball is the group that bought all of the assets from Deeproot.

[18:39] And I'm just going to say this right now.

[18:41] Whoever's behind all of this Turner Pinball stuff and whoever is connecting themselves

[18:46] to the Deeproot fiasco, I think you guys are going to fail.

[18:50] And I'm telling you why you're going to fail.

[18:52] All of the bad karma, it has to go somewhere.

[18:55] And every single thing that J-pop has touched has turned to crap.

[19:00] I actually think it's disgusting that anyone would want to salvage what went on over at

[19:05] Deeproot.

[19:06] $61 million of mostly old people's money that Robert Mueller stole because he lied to them

[19:14] went to the Deeproot project.

[19:17] This guy deserves to be in jail and nobody should be lifting a finger to help make these

[19:23] games.

[19:24] Raza was garbage.

[19:25] I'm going to upload all the Deeproot videos to my Canada Pinball YouTube channel.

[19:29] If you haven't seen him go to Canada Pinball on YouTube, you can see them.

[19:33] And you'll see what I mean.

[19:35] This game was always junk.

[19:37] John Papadook is a hack.

[19:40] Like he doesn't know what he's doing on his own.

[19:43] And when he was at Valley Williams, the engineers over there made him into a superstar.

[19:48] Without the engineers at Valley Williams, the guy is not capable of making anything interesting.

[19:54] So there's a lot coming in March.

[19:56] And look, TPF, for those of you who don't know, is March 24th through the 26th in Frisco,

[20:02] Texas.

[20:03] I will be there.

[20:04] We're going to do a happy hour and we're going to hang out and we're going to have a good

[20:08] time, everybody.

[20:09] I hope you guys have a great weekend.

[20:11] Enjoy the Super Bowl.

[20:12] I definitely feel like next week on Canada's Pinball Podcast, we are going to be able to

[20:17] finally discuss this $20,000 teeth Elwyn James Bond machine.

[20:23] And look, I'm just going to end this show by saying, did you see that Disney announced

[20:28] Toy Story 5?

[20:30] If it couldn't get any worse for Toy Story 4 owners, now you're not even going to have

[20:36] the final installment of Toy Story.

[20:39] It's just all so bad.

[20:41] Somebody needs to go get the license for the real Toy Story movies.

[20:45] And I was just thinking about it.

[20:46] Reach for the sky to infinity and beyond.

[20:50] All of the stuff we love about the Toy Story world.

[20:53] We need it in pinball form.

[20:55] I know Jersey Jack people hate me.

[20:57] They come at me.

[20:58] They defend Pat Lawler.

[21:00] Pat Lawler whiffed.

[21:02] It's not about showing an old man respect.

[21:04] He didn't show us any respect.

[21:06] He made a game that he was working on for two years and this is what he puts into it.

[21:11] Not even an original idea in the game.

[21:15] And look, and then you want to go charge us $12,000 to $15,000 for this game and we're

[21:20] supposed to show Pat Lawler respect?

[21:23] Come on.

[21:24] If Pat Lawler wanted our respect, he would have made a game that blew us away.

[21:28] He didn't.

[21:29] But I still think if Jersey Jack has a relationship with Disney, I don't know, maybe buy back

[21:34] all these Toy Story 4s, bury them in the desert like Katari's ET game and give the

[21:40] world the Toy Story we want.

[21:42] It's not going to happen.

[21:43] What's going to be so fun to watch is to see if Jersey Jack with a straight face is going

[21:48] to release Godfather and say the price tag is $12,000 to $15,000.

[21:54] I'm excited.

[21:55] I love the fact that all of these companies now have to look at us with a straight face,

[22:01] price these games this high and if these games aren't blowing our freaking socks off, and

[22:06] I don't even wear socks, that's how good these games need to be, these games are all going

[22:10] to struggle to sell.

[22:12] They are.

[22:13] They're not going to sell.

[22:14] And then these distros are going to be sitting on a ton of inventory and then they're going

[22:18] to blame me because I'm telling everybody to wait and see.

[22:21] I'm telling everybody to keep your money in your wallet until you play a game that you

[22:26] know is magical.

[22:27] Why is that a bad thing to encourage in the world of pinball?

[22:31] Everybody have a great day and I will be on my Facebook Live tomorrow, 10am Eastern Standard

[22:37] Time, Saturday morning spectacular.

[22:40] I'm going to get you.

[22:47] It's a matter of time.

[22:51] I'm going to get you.

[22:56] I'm going to get you.

[23:00] I'm going to get you.

[23:03] I'm going to get you.
