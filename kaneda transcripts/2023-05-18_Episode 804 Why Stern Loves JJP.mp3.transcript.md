[00:00] No sleep till...

[00:10] Brooklyn!

[00:16] Ah, who would like a 90 minute pinball podcast about Harry Potter rumor?

[00:21] I can't believe like shows can stretch out a single post by Joe Kamikaw into 90 minutes of

[00:28] discussion about Harry Potter.

[00:30] So look, we saw Joe Kamikaw pop into the Napsarcade thread.

[00:34] This rumor is obviously true, I feel like.

[00:36] It's gonna happen at some point.

[00:38] Jersey Jack Pinball has the license to Harry Potter.

[00:42] When this game will come out, nobody knows.

[00:44] Will they do it justice?

[00:45] Nobody knows.

[00:46] Is this good for Jersey Jack?

[00:48] Well, it is when Harry Potter comes out, but is it good for Jersey Jack right now?

[00:53] A company that needs to move Godfather Elise?

[00:56] It's not good news, right?

[00:57] You're gonna wait, because I also think the Matrix is gonna be next from Steve Ritchie,

[01:01] and then we're gonna see something after that.

[01:03] Will it be Harry Potter?

[01:05] Will it be Avatar?

[01:06] Who knows?

[01:07] All I know is this.

[01:08] At these prices, Jersey Jack Pinball needs a hit, and we've been waiting for a hit for a long time.

[01:14] And if there's one company that can take an amazing theme and absolutely whiff on it,

[01:19] it's Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:21] Now, I want to see Jersey Jack Pinball get back to a place where they crush it,

[01:25] where they put everything we want into a game.

[01:27] And here's why I'm worried about Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:30] They've only really done that once, and the one time they did it is when they had Slash

[01:36] working with the company, and he gave them everything they wanted to make Guns N' Roses the right way.

[01:42] They kind of did that with Wizard of Oz, and they were very creative with the Hobbit,

[01:47] but since then, none of these themes at Jersey Jack Pinball have really been integrated properly,

[01:53] and really deliver.

[01:54] If you're a fan of that franchise or that movie, they haven't really crushed it.

[01:58] It hasn't really been the case.

[01:59] So I hope they do Harry Potter justice.

[02:02] I think we have years to go, and I think this rumor is going to get pretty stale,

[02:07] pretty fast because of the amount of time that's going to pass between now and the game coming out.

[02:11] So let's go around the horn and talk about what's going on in Pinball these days,

[02:15] because Canada years truly has been sniffing around pinside.

[02:19] I've been popping in the threads.

[02:20] I've been reading what's happening at all these companies, and I love just going around the horn

[02:25] like this and talking about what's happening in the pinball scene this week.

[02:29] So let's start out with this rumor of a new pinball company coming out.

[02:33] We've seen the teasers like shh, an amazing new pinball machine is coming.

[02:38] They've got these buttons and signs they're putting around at different shows,

[02:42] and I can tell you right now that I can confirm for you that this is going to be a brand new

[02:47] pinball company bringing out a game that I hear is going to be a licensed game.

[02:52] It's not a remake of an old game, but it's a new pinball manufacturing company.

[02:57] And I think when you hear that, I think most of us when we hear that someone is going to throw their

[03:02] hat into the ring as a new pinball company, we roll our eyes. Think about it like this.

[03:08] When was the last time a new pinball manufacturing company announced themselves and actually

[03:16] delivered an amazing product? Think about that. It's been over a decade.

[03:21] And then think about which one of these boutique companies is actually making games that can

[03:27] even compete with stern pinball. And then the list gets almost to zero.

[03:32] The last amazing boutique game that got revealed to the world was probably the big Lebowski,

[03:37] which was 10 years ago and a manufacturing disaster. Haggis Pinball didn't really figure it out.

[03:44] They're just treading water. Who else out there? Pinball Adventures?

[03:48] Come on, who's actually buying the puny factory? Now that Andrew McBain has left this podcast

[03:53] and he doesn't subscribe anymore to Canada, I can be honest about the puny factory.

[03:57] I was trying to be a little bit nice. We all know nobody's buying those games.

[04:01] He's not going to sell 120 of those games. Sorry Dave Sanders, it's just the bitter reality.

[04:07] And who else out there? Turner Logic Pinball? Come on, that sushi eclipse game is total garbage.

[04:13] I'm just going to be honest, total garbage. You cannot enter into the pinball space and expect

[04:19] people to pay a price that's a stern pro or above and buy your product if your games are not great.

[04:25] I mean, look at American Pinball. They're still struggling just to sell a thousand of any title,

[04:30] let alone make the titles that people order. So if a new company is coming into pinball,

[04:36] when they reveal themselves to the pinball world, they better have games already built,

[04:41] already in a box and ready to go. And I think they need to be transparent and I think they need

[04:47] to show us they can figure it out because I don't think anyone's going to trust any of these companies

[04:51] anymore. And no one is going to back these companies anymore financially. We always see these new boutique

[04:57] companies come out and then they want us to kickstart their dream. Nobody's going to go in anymore

[05:02] and give deposits on a company that is not proven they can make games. And why do we need these

[05:08] companies? I keep feeling this way. We have like eight or nine, 10 or 12 pinball companies right now

[05:13] in 2023 and only like a handful, only like four of these companies are actually executing and

[05:21] manufacturing efficiently. It's only Stern, it's only Jersey Jack, it's only spooky pinball. And

[05:28] maybe the pinball brothers are trickling games out and Dutch pinball is trickling games out.

[05:33] But who else is really crushing it on a manufacturing level? Chicago Gaming Company takes

[05:39] forever. Alright, I'm about to give you a scoop ladies and gentlemen. Are you sitting down? So

[05:43] look, Canada always gives you news and then it ends up on Naps Arcade and I never get any credit

[05:48] for this stuff. I'm just here to tell you right now, a lot of new remakes are coming into the

[05:52] pinball space. We all knew this. We see the signs, the writing is on the wall. Planetary pinball is

[05:58] working with Pendredi to make like kits for games like whirlwind games like Fun House. So they're

[06:04] going to start upgrading the classic Bali Williams games. But the next move that's going to happen,

[06:09] and we all knew this was coming, is we're going to see more remakes of all the classic Bali Williams

[06:15] games that you love. And so that begs the question, what are you going to do if you own one? Do you

[06:20] want to buy a kit and put the new version of the game into your old game? Because people always

[06:26] complain that the Bali Williams games are too shallow. I would argue that that's not the case.

[06:31] They're not all too shallow. But now we're going to see remakes coming not only from Chicago Gaming

[06:36] Company, but from other manufacturers as well. And I think you're going to see remakes of all the

[06:41] classic games you want it. You want Theater of Magic. You want Tales of the Arabian Knights. You

[06:46] want Adams Family Twilight Zone. I think you're going to see these games come back again. And I

[06:51] think you're going to see them in the next couple of years. And I think it's going to create an

[06:55] interesting thing for the marketplace of all of these used games. The market is already saturated

[07:01] with so many titles. But I think for a lot of us, we're not looking back. Will they sell these old

[07:07] games? Absolutely. Like if you make a modern version of an old classic, you're going to find

[07:13] people to buy it. People are in love with those old games. And there's no denying the fact. Like

[07:18] if you put a Tales of the Arabian Knights next to a Foo Fighters people and look at what's mechanically

[07:26] in these games and look, Toten shoots very well. Toten's got a lot of flow. Toten's got a lot of

[07:32] toys. Toten has more mechanical magic than almost any modern stern. And so if you offer it up in

[07:39] modern times and you do it right and you make a special limited edition version or a remake of

[07:46] Toten, I think you're going to have a sales juggernaut on your hands. And then the question

[07:50] becomes, what can you charge for these games that have so much mechanically in them? These modern

[07:56] pinball companies are loving the new direction of pinball. It's all about theme, artwork, and software.

[08:03] The mechanical magic is not in most of these new games. It's just not. If you make a game shoot well

[08:10] and it has good flow and it has great code and it has beautiful artwork, that is good enough

[08:17] for many of you out there. You don't want to see a disappearing magnet. You don't want to see a shooting

[08:23] star out lane save. You don't want to see a genie magnetically grab the ball and fire it back at you.

[08:29] Personally, I would like to see more of that stuff in modern pinball. But these companies do not want

[08:36] to do the effort to put that into these games because it's more expensive. It's more problematic.

[08:42] And that's where we're at. But at these prices, and I mean this because I've been talking to my

[08:47] friend Derek who's enjoying his godfather, I still can't help but look down at godfather

[08:51] and see a game that looks pretty damn empty for 12 to $15,000. And I get it shoots well,

[08:58] and I get the code is deep, and I get you're getting some satisfaction as you try to reach to a

[09:03] 100 times multiplier. Did you see this in godfather? There is an ability to get a 100 times

[09:10] multiplier in the game. Carl over at IE Pinball has been exploiting this and putting up scores.

[09:16] Wait for it. In the trillions you can score in the godfather pinball machine. The score is so long,

[09:23] it goes over the box where the score is showed on the screen. Absolutely ridiculous. They're

[09:28] going to have to change this because if people play this game in competitions, that's all people

[09:32] will do is get to the 100 times multiplier. Really weird that Jersey Jack would even have that in a

[09:37] game because I actually like Jersey Jack scoring where you know this does this. When you play a

[09:43] stern game and you're just getting hundreds of millions, if not billions of points, I always

[09:48] find it somewhat confusing on what led to what score. When you can actually sort of do the math

[09:53] in your head, I think it's more enjoyable. All right, so get ready for those remakes people.

[09:57] All right, let's talk about what's going on at these pinball companies. So spooky pinball.

[10:01] I've been in and out of the Scooby-Doo thread and I keep seeing the same thing over and over in

[10:06] this thread. The quality control issues over at spooky pinball. There is no longer an excuse for

[10:12] this anymore. You see some of these photos of people that are just getting their games and the

[10:18] soldering in these games looks horrendous on some of them and they really need to slow down

[10:24] and train people better on how to put these games together. There's no excuse anymore. The company's

[10:29] been around for a decade. They're now making like four or five hundred Scooby-Doo's and so whoever

[10:35] is in charge of doing the soldering on the coin doors, what's happening that day? Is he drinking

[10:41] before you hand him the soldering iron? I saw this other game where one of the boards apparently

[10:46] wasn't good so they put another board in and they just left the old board right on top of it, just

[10:52] sitting there. Like they didn't even remove it from the cabinet. They just attached a new board

[10:56] below it and it's like spooky. Come on now. Like at some point you've got to make it where these

[11:02] games are being better inspected where everyone who's got a slot on the manufacturing line needs to

[11:10] realize that this game and the quality of this company is only as good as the weakest person

[11:17] on the line. One person having a lazy day during manufacturing is going to put a black stain on

[11:25] your company. And I just hate seeing stuff like this this late into production because we really

[11:31] want to just start talking about gameplay and code and how beautiful the game is. And I think

[11:38] because there are so many people concerned about quality, it's got all of the people waiting for

[11:44] their games really nervous that the game I get is not going to be great quality. And if the quality

[11:50] isn't there, the other problem is this. You're going to start to see the price of the game go

[11:55] down and down and down as people bail on their slots. So come on, spooky. Call time out, have

[12:01] another pizza party and make sure you catch these issues before these games go to customers. So the

[12:06] other thing with Scooby-Doo that I saw in the thread is a really cool mod by Back Alley Creations,

[12:13] which is an apron mod that brings like that stonework to life on the apron that you see in the back

[12:19] of the game. So it sort of ties the whole game together. Really neat mod for the game. Almost

[12:25] looks like it was supposed to be part of the game and they removed it and decided to sell it as an

[12:31] additional accessory. There's only one problem with this mod. It's $500 people. You got to be

[12:38] kidding me. $500 for just a piece of plastic that goes over the apron of the game that says

[12:45] Scooby-Doo on it. This is ridiculous. You can get an Xbox for $500. I think at some point with all

[12:51] of these mods, we really do have to start looking at, well, is the effort there? Are the materials

[12:57] there? Was it this hard to make this mod? I mean, they're probably making these aprons for a hundred

[13:02] bucks at most and they should be around $250, not $500, but that's pinball now. They know if you're

[13:09] going to spend $10,000 on a game and you want to make it a little bit nicer. What's $500 when

[13:15] you're spending $13,000 on a fully loaded Scooby-Doo pinball machine? All right, let's go on to Stern

[13:21] Pinball. What's going on over at Stern? We did hear about the Joe Kamikaw rumor a little bit more

[13:28] by Naps Arcade because Christian Lyne went on the Loser Kid Pinball podcast and he talked about how

[13:34] that cabinet we saw in the rumor was made by Christopher Franchi. We've seen this before.

[13:40] Franchi's made cabinets for Wonder Woman for Superman 78 and when he does this, he says he's

[13:46] used these mockups to pitch the license holder to try to secure the license to make a pinball

[13:52] machine. Now look, I think it's kind of strange, right? Are you telling me that a license holder

[13:57] can't imagine what their license would look like on a pinball machine? They actually need to see it

[14:03] mocked up and then they're going to say, okay, cool, I see my license on a cabinet, go ahead and

[14:09] make a pinball machine. I don't really get it. How would that win somebody over? You're not really

[14:13] showing them the play field, the design, everything else. You're not even showing them a pinball machine.

[14:18] You're just showing them a cabinet with their license slapped on it. I don't think that would

[14:24] be enough to convince someone that they should go ahead and give you the license. I also think

[14:30] Franchi's sharing all of this with everybody because he has. Like he's like released this stuff.

[14:35] I don't know. Like how is that going to win over a license holder if they see you sharing this stuff

[14:40] on social media before they have approved the pinball project? And let's face it, I don't think

[14:46] any of these Franchi comp cabinets have been successful in convincing any license holder

[14:52] to make the game. So why do they keep doing it? And this is the image that Joe Kamikau grabbed.

[14:57] It's an image that Christopher Franchi made. So it is what it is. I don't even care about Harry Potter.

[15:02] Good. We're going to see it in 2024, 2025 if it ever comes out. All right. Let's talk about

[15:07] James Bond 60th. Talk about market trends. This game is plummeting in value. Everybody remember

[15:14] that Stern priced this game at $19,995. Flipping out pinball will sell you one for $15,799.

[15:24] I mean, think about that for a minute. If you bought this game directly from Stern,

[15:29] you paid them $22,000 with taxes because they charge tax when you buy direct from Stern. $22,000.

[15:38] And just a few months later, you can get one from one of the most reputable distributors

[15:43] for $15,799. You almost lost $7,000 on the game. People wait and see.

[15:52] Canada is giving you the best advice ever. Just simply wait and see and you will save a fortune

[15:58] on these games. And it's funny watching people try to mod their James Bond 60th to make it complete.

[16:04] Like you paid 20 grand, 17 grand and you got to pay extra for inner art blades,

[16:10] for mirror blades to go in the game. I think the best thing to do to this game and the best

[16:15] versions I've seen of it are just put black mirror blades inside the cabinet and change the T molding

[16:22] to gray or that steel color. And that's it. Don't touch anything else on the game.

[16:28] If you want to keep this rare 500 made Keith Elwyn classic the way it should be made,

[16:34] just do those two things. Enjoy your game and I'll enjoy watching this game go to $12,000 by the end

[16:41] of the year. Trust me, this game is going to keep sinking in value because it's the biggest ripoff

[16:47] in the history of pinball. It really is. This is a $5,000 to $6,000 pin at most and everyone who bought

[16:54] it for more than that. I'm telling you, I don't care how fun it is to shoot. You got to remember

[16:58] how much money it cost Stern to make this game and it's not a lot. Alright, speaking of James Bond,

[17:03] there is a really cool mod coming for James Bond. It is a shooter rod mod that looks like the Aston

[17:10] Marden gear shift and you can pull out the shift knob and pop open the top and it's got the red

[17:16] button from the ejector seat from the Aston Marden. Super cool mod being made for the game. I'm not

[17:22] sure how that's going to work. Are you going to pull it off when you're playing the game or is there

[17:26] some way to do it during a mode but really neat idea. I just wish I saw a lot of these neat ideas

[17:33] coming from the companies themselves, everybody. We're spending a lot of money on these games

[17:39] and think about it. It's almost like these companies are not even trying to be ultra creative

[17:44] anymore. They're not even trying to change the plastics into becoming more molds and things that

[17:49] are interactive because they're just saying to themselves, the mod community will do it. And

[17:55] of course they're not even going to go after the mod community now because now they want to sell you

[18:00] $10,000 premiums and $13,000 LEs and leave a lot of the real estate in the game pretty empty and

[18:07] pretty plastic because they want to make it as cheap as possible for them to make the game. So

[18:12] they don't care if you want to stick a bunch of expensive mods all over Godzilla or James Bond.

[18:18] They don't care if those mod makers are making a lot of money because Stern Pimball is making a

[18:22] fortune by not going the extra mile with these games. You know, so in a lot of ways it's a win-win

[18:29] for Stern and the mod community and it's a lose for us, the consumers. These companies should be

[18:36] putting more in these games for this much money. Everybody knows it. I know I'm a broken record

[18:41] on this but you know this too. Alright, so closing out what's going on with Stern, the Rush toppers

[18:47] are finally shipping to people so if you have a rush and you ordered a topper, it should be arriving

[18:53] soon. Which begs the question, where's the Godzilla topper? I still can't believe it takes Stern over

[19:00] a year delay to get people their toppers once the game is out. I know everyone's been waiting for

[19:06] the Godzilla topper and now everybody's waiting for the Foo Fighter topper which is going to have

[19:10] interactive toys on top that interact with the game. So when is that going to come out? I mean,

[19:16] Stern is just sitting on a goldmine when it comes to accessories for each of its games and when they

[19:22] finally drop these accessories, they sell like hotcakes and they really do make the games pop.

[19:28] But you know what's nuts about it is this. This is why Stern is so smart. Stern will sell you

[19:33] a $13,000 limited edition game that comes with no topper. Then they will sell you a $2,000 topper.

[19:42] So now to have your Stern LE with everything it should come with for $13,000, it is a $15,000 game

[19:50] and all of a sudden that's the same exact price as a Jersey Jack collectors edition that comes with

[19:56] a topper that has different artwork than the normal LE of the game, that has radcals and has a lot of

[20:03] other stuff. Stern Pinball is basically selling you the most expensive pinball machine on the market

[20:09] alongside Jersey Jack CEs and ladies and gentlemen, if you put both of those games next to each other,

[20:15] Jersey Jack Pinball's bomb and their build of materials and the stuff they put into their game

[20:20] is of higher quality than Stern Pinball. They don't have the flipper feel where it needs to be,

[20:26] but they give you a bigger screen. There's just a lot higher grades of detail in their games and

[20:31] again just stand over each one, look at each one side by side and this is why Stern Pinball is Jersey

[20:38] Jack Pinball's greatest fan because Jersey Jack Pinball showed Stern Pinball how much money people

[20:44] will spend and instead of putting a lot more money into the games, Stern Pinball just charged more

[20:51] and they did it subtly and then they accelerated the price increases and now we are spending almost

[20:56] twice as much as a Stern LE used to cost. We don't get a topper, you can almost price these

[21:02] Stern games with all of its accessories to be $16,000 and nobody wants to pause and say,

[21:08] wait a minute, what happened here? What has happened to Pinball? Wizard of Oz was $6,500

[21:16] and now you can accessorize a Foo Fighters LE when the topper comes out to be probably $15,000-$16,000.

[21:24] You're almost spending $10,000 more than the Wizard of Oz was originally and nobody wants to

[21:31] say what the heck has happened to Pinball pricing. It's crazy, it's absolutely crazy.

[21:35] All right, let's go over to Jersey Jack Pinball. So I got my replacement playfields for Guns N' Roses.

[21:42] I gave Jersey Jack Pinball $656. I'm sure that money went right to Mirko. That's Mirko's cost

[21:52] for the playfields. It's absolutely disgusting that this slime ball Mirko is making millions of

[21:59] dollars making crappy product and then when he makes crappy product, we have to spend more money

[22:05] to get more of his crappy product. Unbelievable. I'm not happy about it, but I made my order.

[22:12] The playfields are on their way to CoinTaker and it is what it is and that's that. So if you have a

[22:18] Guns N' Roses and you want your replacement playfield, they are available and you can buy them

[22:24] and it won't make you feel good. And yes, 99% of us will never do a playfield swap.

[22:31] All right, are you sitting down? You want to hear about a cheap pinball machine?

[22:34] My friends over at CoinTaker, Chris and Melissa, the folks from the Netherlands who came up with

[22:40] the Magic Girl kit, right? The kit that starts to make these mechs work in Magic Girl. They spent

[22:46] years fixing John Papadook's disaster. They flew over to CoinTaker and they retrofitted their new

[22:54] kit onto the existing prototype games or the games that CoinTaker had sitting in its inventory.

[23:01] It's cool. I was watching the video of them putting the kit into the games and I would like to tell

[23:06] each and every one of you now, if you would like to buy a Magic Girl where the mechanisms now work,

[23:12] there's not much of a game there. You kind of hit the switches and that activates the mechanism,

[23:18] but there's no game, right? You're not progressing through a storyline. None of it's really connected

[23:24] in a way, but this stuff works. The magna flipping works, the levitation chamber works,

[23:30] the magnetic ball save works, all of it works. The hands come down and lock the balls. All of it now

[23:36] works. So here's how much money they are if you want to buy one. They have the one with the Lion

[23:41] Saw cabinet, which they made, I think, 22 of. And then there's the prototype cabinet that has

[23:47] different artwork and different plastics in the game. And that one, I think there was four prototype

[23:52] games made. Are you sitting down? If you want the Lion Saw version of the Magic Girl, it's $45,000.

[24:01] If you want the prototype version, it's $65,000 for this game. And I was talking to Chris about

[24:10] this and I'm like, come on, man, just come on. Like really, really, $65,000. And look, you know me,

[24:19] I have a soft spot for this game. I love how beautiful Magic Girl looks. And I was even trying

[24:25] to say, hey, man, what about 40? And maybe I'll sell my Batman SLE and have this rare Magic Girl.

[24:31] But here's what I did. I went and watched the video of them showcasing all the changes they

[24:37] made to the game. It was like a 25 minute video. And I saw the gameplay stream of the game. And I

[24:44] immediately said, no way. This is not worth it. It's just glorified artwork. I get that the stuff

[24:51] works, but it's nowhere near worth this money. And if you buy it good on you, it means you have so

[24:57] much money. But the problem with owning these Magic Girls for me personally is everyone just

[25:02] looks at you like you're a fool. Like you're just a fool with a ton of money. I don't think it's a

[25:07] great story. I don't think it's a great game. I think this entire game is Zombietti's bright,

[25:14] colorful artwork. And while it looks magical, it is anything but magical. And that's how I feel

[25:21] about the game. Like I would think about buying it if the price was right, but $45,000 and $65,000.

[25:28] Come on. I mean, that's just crazy to me. Alright, what else is going on in pinball? So I heard that

[25:33] American Pinball is sending out Galactic Tank Force games. I reached out to one of its big

[25:40] distributors and they said they are sending out three deluxe editions and three LEs next week.

[25:47] So that's six games going out. That doesn't seem like a lot. I then asked the distributor,

[25:54] how many games a week is American Pinball making? And they would not tell me. It is still a secret.

[26:01] American Pinball won't take the Canada Boutique Challenge. I would love for them to open up the

[26:06] door and show us what's going on every day at American Pinball. I would love to see that from

[26:12] Haggis. We saw some behind the scenes at Homepin. They put up some photos of manufacturing. And when

[26:18] I see Homepin manufacturing, I'm just like, who's buying this game? Every time I see Spinal Tap,

[26:23] I'm like, man, you couldn't even pay me to take that game. It just looks so damn pedestrian and

[26:31] weak considering what's available in pinball these days. Look, ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot

[26:37] happening in pinball, but there's also not a lot happening. I think the main thing happening right

[26:42] now is prices are starting to come down again. There's a Ghostbuster LE for $15,009. That's

[26:49] prices coming down. Like during COVID, Ghostbusters were like $18,000, $19,000. There's a guy that wants

[26:55] to sell you Ghostbusters with the topper for $24,000. It's stupid. These are not $24,000 experiences.

[27:03] And I know you're going to say, Canada, you bought a Batman SLE for $25,000. And I'm going to tell

[27:09] you right now, I've already been offered $30,000 for the game. And I know that Batman SLE will hold

[27:15] value nicely. There are only 80, and Stern is the number one company people collect. And there's

[27:22] no going back. Pinball is a collector's thing right now. And if you're a pinball collector

[27:27] and you want one of the nicest games Stern has ever released, Batman 66 SLE is still probably

[27:35] the most valuable Stern machine ever. Think about it. What Stern machine is worth more than Batman

[27:42] SLE? Even though it's not a better game gameplay wise than Elvira, it's a better theme than Elvira.

[27:49] So Batman attracts more people than Elvira. Elvira's got 199 of the 40th anniversary editions.

[27:58] So that's almost three times as many as Batman SLE. And that's what sucks about the Elvira

[28:04] signature edition, which there were 50 of. The nicer version is the purple version, which they

[28:09] made four times as many. They really screwed over the Elvira collector because now there's like

[28:14] two versions. But I don't even care, right? I think ultimately my advice for each and every one of you

[28:19] is buy a game because you love it. Buy a game because you want to keep it. The days of going in on

[28:25] games just to dabble at the gameplay, that's an expensive venture right now. Like my friend Derek

[28:31] bought Godfather for $12,000. He's enjoying it, but he could have bought it for $10,200. Like he

[28:38] could have saved himself almost $2,000 and had the same exact experience. So it's really hard to

[28:45] justify going in early on a lot of these games. And I think if you just wait, you're going to be able

[28:50] to buy whatever you want. And if you want one of these rare games, you'll be able to get one. Trust

[28:56] me, money will always open the door to a game no matter what anybody says. And hey, if you have $65,000

[29:03] burning a hole in your pocket and you want to see John Papaduk's magnetic hair magnet hit up

[29:09] coin taker because they got one they'll sell you. Have a great day everybody. Talk to you soon.

[30:03] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[30:33] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
