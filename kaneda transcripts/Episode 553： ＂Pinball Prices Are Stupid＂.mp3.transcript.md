[00:00] Welcome to episode 553 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, I'm your host, Canada, and even though

[00:15] I'm still suffering the symptoms of COVID, and one of them is that I have no smell and

[00:20] no taste at all.

[00:22] That's not exactly true because after this week when I saw that Stern Pinball is arbitrarily

[00:29] raising the price of Batman and Elvira by 500 bucks that left a bad taste in my mouth

[00:37] and it smelled like a bunch of BS.

[00:39] We're going to talk about that on episode 553 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:44] We're also going to talk about Gundin Rose's Collector's Editions.

[00:48] They have been landing inside people's homes and if you haven't gone to that thread, it

[00:53] is like watching an artistic masterpiece being unboxed.

[00:58] We're going to talk about those unboxing pictures that we've seen this week and we're

[01:02] also just going to talk about a few other things happening in the Pinball world.

[01:05] Now, before I get going, I do want to say thank you to a few people because this past

[01:11] weekend, as Brendan and I get ready to welcome the baby boy into the world, the future of

[01:17] Pinball Podcasting, we had a virtual baby shower for my beautiful wife and I did end up

[01:23] putting after my Saturday morning spectacular, I put up a very simple registry list for

[01:30] our baby registry on our Facebook page for Canada's Pinball Podcast and I do want to say

[01:35] very, very thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you so much to some people out there

[01:40] who actually went and got some items off of our baby registry and I'm talking about

[01:45] Jennifer Chen, Ryan Wood, Kelly Daniel, John Ellorick from Jackbar and Carl Strude, thank

[01:52] you so much for being so generous and contributing to Baby Canada, the baby canada baby registry,

[01:58] even though Canada will not be his name.

[02:00] I also before I get into this episode, I want to say thank you to someone who sent me

[02:03] an email that I was not expecting.

[02:05] Now I opened up my Canada Pinball Gmail account and I got a really nice note from Bruce Nightingale

[02:11] over at Slamptil Pinball Podcast and I want to read you what Bruce wrote to Chris.

[02:15] He said, dear Chris, I know we haven't always seen eye to eye in this hobby but I'd like

[02:20] to say congratulations to you and Brenda on the addition about to join your family.

[02:26] I heard you got COVID and I hope you feel better soon.

[02:29] May we both have many more years of pinball podcasting fun ahead of us, sincerely Bruce

[02:35] Nightingale.

[02:36] Now I just want to say this, I know that we've had back and forth Bruce and I but I just

[02:40] want to say thank you so much Bruce for reaching out.

[02:43] I know it's like twippy voting season and there's a lot of battling it out between different

[02:47] people and personalities.

[02:49] And I, Bruce said something on a recent show.

[02:52] He said, you know, when you do a pinball podcast, you got to do it for fun and it should

[02:56] be fun and it should be something you enjoy doing.

[02:59] And there's a lot of shows that have popped up over the last year or two but shows like

[03:03] Slamptil, these guys have been doing it for years.

[03:06] Like talk about being able to go four or five years or more doing a pinball podcast and

[03:11] still enjoying it to this day and I think that's what counts the most.

[03:16] It doesn't matter how many trophies you have on a shelf.

[03:19] What really matters is that year in and year out, you continue to bring pinball enjoyment

[03:24] and content for people for free.

[03:27] So Bruce, you and Ron have a great show.

[03:29] I've always been a big fan of Slamptil.

[03:31] So thank you so much for that note.

[03:33] Okay, let's jump right into it because the things I want to talk about are this.

[03:37] I want to talk about pricing and pinball and it's something I've been speaking about

[03:41] for the entire duration of Canadian pinball podcast but you must be living under a rock

[03:47] recently.

[03:48] If you haven't noticed some of the incredible increases in pinball prices going on, some

[03:54] of them are going on by manufacturers.

[03:57] Some of them are just happening in the second hand market because demand for this hobby

[04:02] is going through the roof.

[04:04] You know, even basic items like toppers and translates are starting to go through the

[04:08] roof.

[04:09] I don't know what to do about those but I want to start with Stern pinball's decision

[04:13] to basically arbitrarily increase the price of Batman 66 and Elvira and charge $500 more

[04:22] for the game without giving customers anything more for the money.

[04:27] Now, I just want to say this.

[04:29] I don't like this move.

[04:31] I don't.

[04:32] And here's why because the other part of this thing is if you ordered either one of those

[04:36] games for the original price that was set on each machine, I think it was like $7,999.

[04:43] If you ordered it for that price, Stern is not honoring that price.

[04:48] Distributors are telling their customers that you can either get a refund or you can transfer

[04:54] the money over to another title but if you want either Batman or Elvira, you have to

[05:00] pony up $500 more.

[05:03] Now I know some of you out there are Stern fanboys.

[05:06] I know some of you out there will cheerlead every move Stern makes.

[05:10] How can you with a straight face tell any of us in this pinball hobby why we should have

[05:15] to pay more and get nothing in return?

[05:19] Nothing.

[05:20] You are basically tacking on $500.

[05:24] That is the price of a PlayStation 5.

[05:27] It's the price of an Xbox Series X.

[05:30] It's the price of many goods that are out there in the world and you are literally getting

[05:34] nothing for it.

[05:36] Why the price increase?

[05:38] How do you even begin to speculate why Stern is doing this other than pure greed?

[05:43] Someone was telling me on Facebook, well Stern is going to start to charge more for games

[05:46] that are more complex to make that they simply don't want to make these games that have

[05:50] more in them.

[05:51] And I'm looking at both Elvira and Batman and saying these are not complex hard to manufacture

[05:57] games.

[05:58] We're not going to spend $500 in a premium because it's harder to make these games and

[06:04] don't forget that both Batman and Elvira already come at a premium price.

[06:09] There are no pro versions of these games.

[06:12] We're talking about two games that already carry a Stern premium price tag and now they

[06:17] are charging more.

[06:19] $500 more.

[06:21] Now look, I think this is a lame move.

[06:24] I think it's pathetic.

[06:26] I think the only thing you can do is if you see something like this as a consumer, I

[06:31] think there comes a point when you should put your foot down and say enough is enough

[06:35] already Stern.

[06:36] We're not going to stand by and let you charge us $1,000 for toppers.

[06:41] We're not going to stand by and let you arbitrarily increase the price of games simply because

[06:45] there might be a demand for it.

[06:47] But this is what they're going to do and can you blame them?

[06:50] I know I have that Stern podcast.

[06:52] It was like, how can we blame Stern for doing this stuff because as long as they make $1,000

[06:58] toppers that look like garbage that sell out, they're going to keep doing this.

[07:04] As long as they get people to spend $15,000 on a piece of couch, they're going to keep

[07:09] doing this.

[07:10] As long as people run after every single new elite that Stern puts into the marketplace,

[07:16] they're going to keep doing this.

[07:18] And Stern's not only looking at how customers are responding to what Stern does, Stern must

[07:23] also be looking at the second hand market in the Pimbal world and watching these people

[07:28] by Ghostbuster toppers for $2500.

[07:33] Let me repeat that.

[07:35] Ghostbusters toppers and KISS toppers are currently now selling for over $2,000 a pop.

[07:42] So if you're Stern Pimbal and you're watching these people spend crazy amounts of money

[07:47] on things like toppers that you know, if you're Stern, you know these things only cost

[07:53] you a few hundred bucks at most.

[07:55] Not even.

[07:56] I mean, you look at that Ghostbusters toppers and that KISS toppers and you can't tell

[08:00] me that both of those toppers, the cost for Stern to make those toppers must be around

[08:05] a hundred dollars.

[08:07] So they're watching this stuff fly, fly off the shelves in the second hand market and

[08:13] they must be telling themselves, we're not even near the ceiling.

[08:17] And if we said we're only going to make 300 more L virus, could we jack up the price

[08:21] by $1,000?

[08:23] Who's to say Stern's not going to do a $2,000 last call sale?

[08:27] Like it's not even a sale, it's a last call opportunity and they can continue to do

[08:32] this and my fear is this.

[08:34] I know there are so many of you out there that are stern apologies that are just going

[08:38] to say, Chris, who cares, a rich man in their money, just let them decide whether or

[08:42] not they want to go in on it.

[08:43] And while you might be correct.

[08:46] The fear that I have in this hobby is that we're continuing to see prices go up and

[08:51] quality go down.

[08:53] And we're starting to see prices increase without consumers demanding more under the glass.

[08:59] And I don't know how anyone can be in this hobby and be a fan of seeing the way the

[09:04] prices are going.

[09:05] And this was Stern's move.

[09:07] Like this wasn't some flipper, this wasn't some scalper.

[09:10] The greatest thing Stern has done over the last couple of years and they fooled all of

[09:15] you.

[09:16] They have fooled everybody.

[09:17] Stern is now flipping its own product.

[09:21] Let me repeat that.

[09:22] Stern has baked in to the price of its own product, the flipper price.

[09:27] And by that, I mean they are making a sale and making tons of profit on the game and

[09:32] then they're jacking the price up arbitrarily on all these games.

[09:36] Stern Ali is not worth $9,200.

[09:40] It's still not even really worth $8,000 and you know that.

[09:44] But what did they do?

[09:46] They saw people buying $8,000 at least and selling them for $9,000.

[09:52] They saw that happening left and right.

[09:54] So what did Stern do?

[09:55] They basically baked in that price into now, the price of every single Stern Ali.

[10:00] So they are basically double dipping in the market and you all are helping them do that.

[10:07] I mean that and I am so tired of seeing two Pimball machines.

[10:12] You see two Stern Ali machines side by side and if you were to add a topper to each of

[10:18] those machines, you're telling me now, how did we get to this point?

[10:21] I mean this, how did we get to the point in the Pimball hobby in which two Stern Ali's

[10:27] with all of their accessories side by side is now over $20,000.

[10:34] Two Pimball machines, new in box from Stern with accessories is over $20,000.

[10:43] And you're telling me that this hobby hasn't jumped the shark in a way, that this hobby

[10:47] hasn't reached a level of ridiculousness.

[10:50] There used to be a point in which you could get Lord of the Rings from Stern Pimball with

[10:56] all of those features for $3700.

[11:01] Two fully featured machines.

[11:03] You could get Lord of the Rings.

[11:04] Look at what's in that game and you could get Simpson's Pimball party.

[11:08] Look at what's in that game compared to these modern games, compared to Led Zeppelin, compared

[11:12] to all these new games coming out that are pretty barren.

[11:15] You can get those two games with everything they had in them for around $7000 to $8000 for

[11:23] two beautiful full featured Stern machines.

[11:27] Now here we are in 2021 and two Stern fully featured machines that are decked out are over

[11:34] $20,000.

[11:35] Can we just drop the mic and say what the hell happened in Pimball?

[11:40] When did it come to this?

[11:42] When did it reach this fever pitch where we are starting to think that these crazy prices

[11:47] are normal?

[11:48] Now speaking of $20,000 machines, let's talk about guns and roses collectors additions.

[11:54] Now let's talk about the phenomenon that's happening right now which is people who bought

[11:59] this game with the sole purpose to flip it are now revealing themselves to the world.

[12:06] They're coming out of the woodwork.

[12:08] And look, I am not here to tell you that this should be banned or illegal.

[12:14] It is what it is.

[12:15] If you buy a product, you own it.

[12:18] You can then sell it for whatever you want.

[12:20] I am never going to be a Pimball podcaster that says we should take away people's right

[12:26] to do what they want to do with the very goods or services they buy or acquire with their

[12:31] hard earned money.

[12:33] So if you got in on a $12,500 collector's edition of GNR, it is within your right to flip

[12:40] that machine for whatever you want.

[12:43] Now do I think that's cool?

[12:45] Do I condone that behavior?

[12:47] I will say with all the people that got locked out of buying a collector's edition, to

[12:53] go in on one at the very beginning knowing that all you wanted to do was make a profit.

[12:58] Yes, you are going to be looked at as a lesser citizen within the Pimball hobby.

[13:05] People will look at you like you're a little bit of a scumbag that you took a machine away

[13:09] from someone who really wanted it.

[13:12] You stole the candy from the grown adult who really would have enjoyed it.

[13:17] Now I would not go in on a machine like GNR, CE, solely to make a buck.

[13:22] I would go in on it to enjoy it because as I've said before, I do think this game is

[13:27] a masterpiece.

[13:28] I do think this is a game that's going to be bolted to the floors of many, many people.

[13:33] But I am very curious looking at the second hand market of Guns and Roses collector's

[13:39] editions.

[13:40] There are a few people out there that have listed a CE for sale.

[13:44] Now how much do you think people are asking for Guns and Roses collector's editions?

[13:48] We have three people on Pinside that are willing to sell their game.

[13:52] One of them is $20,000 or best offer.

[13:57] Another one was $19,000 or best offer.

[14:00] There was a third one that got listed today for $18.5.

[14:03] Now you see what's happening here.

[14:05] Someone listed for $20.

[14:06] Then someone comes in and listed for $19,000.

[14:09] Then someone comes in and listed for $18.5.

[14:12] This is what's happening.

[14:13] These flippers are actually doing a good service for those of you out there who want to get

[14:18] a collector's edition.

[14:20] This behavior is driving the price of the game down.

[14:25] It's not driving it up.

[14:27] Even though people are starting to unbox it and you could have your game in the next few

[14:31] weeks, the reality is this.

[14:34] 500 games at $12,500.

[14:39] That is the most amount of collector's editions that Jersey Jack Pimball has ever made.

[14:45] Everybody knows they did not make 500 Willy Wonkas.

[14:48] The demand was not there.

[14:50] Willy Wonkas CE's are still sitting in box and they're not sold.

[14:54] So there is still a lot more supply of Willy Wonkas CE's than there is demand.

[15:00] There's obviously right now more demand for pirates of the Caribbean CE than there is

[15:05] supply.

[15:06] That is why we are seeing pirates of the Caribbean CE's go for anywhere from $18,000 to $20,000.

[15:14] There are two pirates of the Caribbean CE's for sale right now today on Pinside, $20,000

[15:22] and $21,000.

[15:23] I think are the prices.

[15:24] They've been sitting there for a very, very, very long time.

[15:29] Because I do think there's something about spending $20,000 on a single Pimball machine.

[15:37] Even if that machine is better than two-stern Ellie's combined, I think most of us out

[15:41] there just have a very hard time justifying that any Pimball machine, and I mean this

[15:48] any Pimball machine could ever justify being $20,000.

[15:53] For a few reasons, no machine is that much fun.

[15:57] No experience on a Pimball machine is ever worth $20,000.

[16:02] The other thing is there's nowhere for the price to go but down.

[16:05] If you invest in a $20,000 Pimball machine, you're going to have a really hard time getting

[16:11] out of that one day and not losing your shirt.

[16:14] The other part is once you admit to spending $20,000 on a game, I think it has your reverse

[16:20] effect.

[16:21] Someone was saying this, like, oh yeah, people who buy the Ghostbusters Top are their

[16:25] flux in their money.

[16:26] But people who flex their money, they also don't want to flex at their stupid.

[16:31] And when you spend almost double what something sold for a year ago, you are not saying to

[16:37] the world, look how great I am, look how smart I am.

[16:41] No, you're actually showcasing to most people you have more money than brains.

[16:46] And I think you have to look no further than nobody.

[16:49] And I mean this, nobody out there flexes that they own in El Vira's signature edition.

[16:55] I don't any of those 50 owners ever reveal themselves because they do not want to get

[17:02] ridiculed that they spent $5,000 on a piece of couch.

[17:06] It's the same way if you bought a Pirates machine for $21,000.

[17:13] Are you really going to flex with that?

[17:15] Now look, if you have money and money is no object and that makes you happy, buy all

[17:19] means, go buy it.

[17:21] My life is short people.

[17:23] Life is very, very short.

[17:24] Don't listen to Canada.

[17:25] If something brings you happiness and the distance between your happiness and the thing

[17:31] that you want to get is $21,000 and you have millions of dollars in the bank, buy all means,

[17:38] go get it.

[17:39] Now don't go get it though.

[17:41] If $21,000 is a lot of money to you, you should not have a significant amount of your

[17:48] life savings tied up in Pimble machines.

[17:50] I'm sorry, you just shouldn't.

[17:52] So back to Guns and Roses Collector's Edition.

[17:55] This was my favorite thing.

[17:56] When I read this, the reason I love when people try to spin the fact that they're being

[18:00] a flipper and they're doing something they know that's not going to be popular, listen

[18:04] to this for sale thread from Vivid Psychosis in Chesterfield, Virginia.

[18:09] He writes the following.

[18:11] I am looking to sell my Guns and Roses Collector's Edition.

[18:14] I currently have an LE, which I was going to swap out, but I'm willing to entertain the

[18:21] idea to keep it if someone wants the CE now.

[18:25] Let's stop right there.

[18:27] Vivid Psychosis, you know a lot of people want the CE right now.

[18:30] You know that, like, come on, what kind of rhetorical question is that?

[18:34] Then he goes on to say, the game arrives tomorrow, 1213.

[18:39] Well that can't be accurate.

[18:41] How does it arrive on 1213?

[18:43] So it's either got to be, I think he meant to say like, 113.

[18:48] Game will be sold new in box.

[18:51] If I don't receive an offer to buy with deposit, by the time it arrives from shipping, it

[18:58] will no longer be for sale in all caps.

[19:02] So just think about that for a moment.

[19:03] He's basically creating his own fear of missing out on his own flip of a pinball machine.

[19:10] He's saying if this game gets into my house before it sells, I'm keeping it.

[19:15] I mean, what is wrong with people these days?

[19:18] Like why do we have to spin these ridiculous sales tactics?

[19:22] Why can't you just say the games for sale?

[19:25] It's 18.5 firm.

[19:27] Like what is with this like sense of urgency?

[19:30] The moment this pin crosses the threshold of my door, it is mine.

[19:35] It will not be yours.

[19:36] But if you want it, you can spend $6,000 more than I did for the right to keep it from

[19:41] my possession.

[19:42] I love this.

[19:43] He goes on to say, here is your one chance to have this incredible sold out CE version of

[19:49] a machine in which all versions are sold out indefinitely in your house tomorrow night.

[19:56] Your one chance.

[19:58] Well, it's not a one chance.

[20:00] There are other CE's out there.

[20:02] Many rights willing to accept 18.5 firm or trade for pirates collectors edition.

[20:11] Pick up Enrichment VA only or set up shipping.

[20:14] Yada yada yada.

[20:16] All right.

[20:17] So look, we're going to see a lot more of this.

[20:19] More posts like this, we have not seen a confirmed sale of a Guns and Roses CE from anyone

[20:26] yet.

[20:27] We've not seen that it went for 16 or 17 or 18 or kept it out of vivid psychosis house.

[20:34] By tomorrow, he's got to sell it or else it's your one chance to get it this week.

[20:38] Here's my advice for everybody out there.

[20:40] This is coming from Canada and I'm not being a hypocrite.

[20:43] Don't fall for these sleazy sales tactics.

[20:47] Don't fall for it.

[20:48] Don't try to fall for this fear of missing out on a Guns and Roses collector's edition.

[20:53] There are 500 of them out in the world.

[20:56] They're going to pop up for sale.

[20:59] There are going to be many new inbox ones that pop up for sale.

[21:02] And over the next few months, I'm telling you right now, what is going to happen is this.

[21:07] The prices of these games are going to settle for probably around 15 to 16 thousand dollars.

[21:15] If you were to ask me, I think that is where these will settle.

[21:18] I think that's going to be the case for a few reasons.

[21:20] One, there's 500 of them.

[21:22] They are not nearly as rare as people think.

[21:25] There are 300 more GNRC's than Pirates of the Caribbean.

[21:30] Okay, just think about that.

[21:32] 300 more.

[21:34] And they're already starting at 12.5.

[21:36] So there's that.

[21:37] I think the game is a masterpiece, but the game is also not nearly as fully featured as Pirates

[21:43] of the Caribbean.

[21:44] The reason why Pirates of the Caribbean is going for prices around 18 thousand dollars is

[21:49] they are never going to make it again.

[21:51] The game has got so much in it, it is way more mechanically fully featured than Guns

[21:55] and Roses.

[21:57] It's a wide body.

[21:58] It's also Eric Minier's first game.

[22:00] And it's going to be a game in which there are no more than 1,000 Pirates of the Caribbean

[22:05] ever made in the world.

[22:06] Already the supply of Pirates will always be super limited.

[22:10] We are never going to say that about Guns and Roses.

[22:13] They are going to sell thousands of Guns and Roses at least thousands.

[22:17] There are 500 CE's out there and there are going to be, I think 10% of people who bought

[22:23] the CE in the first six months are going to be flippers.

[22:27] They're going to be scalpers.

[22:28] They're going to be distributors who held one back to see what the market is.

[22:31] You're going to see that.

[22:32] So you're going to see like, I wouldn't be shocked if we see around 50 games go up for

[22:36] sale for various prices and at various times.

[22:40] So you don't have to fall victim to this.

[22:42] Get it now.

[22:43] You're one chance to get it at 18 firm.

[22:46] To me, I read a post like this.

[22:47] I think he's trying to get someone to give up their Pirate CE.

[22:51] I would never, ever, ever, ever give up a Pirates of the Caribbean Collector's Edition for

[22:58] a Guns and Roses Collector's Edition simply by doing the math.

[23:02] It's going to be much easier down the road to get yourself another GNR CE than it will

[23:09] be ever to get a Pirate CE.

[23:12] So if you have a Pirate CE, I would just hold on to it and not accept this trade.

[23:17] Now most people who are in on Jersey Jack's CE's are in on every CE.

[23:23] I've noticed that when I see people's collections, they tend to have all of the crem de la crem's

[23:28] of Jersey Jack games.

[23:30] So I think a lot of GNR CE owners also already own a Pirate CE.

[23:37] But I don't think either one of these games.

[23:39] And I mean this and we all had so many opportunities to buy Pirates of the Caribbean.

[23:45] Pirates of the Caribbean Collector's Edition, those things sat in boxes at distributors

[23:50] for an entire year and nobody wanted them.

[23:55] It was sitting at automated for eight months.

[23:57] They had multiple boxes of Pirate CE and nobody bought them.

[24:02] And just because they announced they're never making it again, now everybody's saying it's

[24:07] a must-have game.

[24:08] Now everybody's saying it's the greatest game of all time.

[24:11] Now everybody feels this FOMO.

[24:14] But nothing has changed about the game.

[24:16] When you had all of those opportunities to play the game at shows and jump on Pirates

[24:23] on location, so many of us said it's not a game I want to own.

[24:28] And this doesn't change it.

[24:29] And if you simply give up this FOMO and you let go of this ridiculous notion that having

[24:35] a pinball machine is your way of flexing how important you are in the world, you'll

[24:41] be much better off.

[24:43] Because for me personally, the reason why I feel no desire to own a Pirate of the Caribbean

[24:48] is simply because it's not a theme I care that much about.

[24:51] And it's not a game that I think has good theme integration at all.

[24:55] If I love those movies, I still walk away from playing that game, feeling like none of

[25:01] the humor and none of the stuff I love about the Pirates of the Caribbean movie comes through

[25:06] in the game.

[25:07] It just doesn't.

[25:08] All of Captain Jack Sparrow humor is what drives that franchise and it's found nowhere in

[25:15] the game.

[25:16] Now I get it.

[25:17] You guys who love the game, who love the experience, who want to pick 22 characters and all their

[25:20] different attributes and how deep the game is, great.

[25:24] But you know what I'm saying is this game didn't change.

[25:27] What changed was the supply of it.

[25:30] What changed was the FOMO.

[25:33] What changed was the marketplace around it.

[25:36] But that still doesn't change the game for me.

[25:39] So for me, I love Guns and Roses.

[25:41] I love the band and my GNR CE will never be for sale.

[25:45] It just will never be for sale.

[25:47] Now let's talk about the unboxings of these machines.

[25:50] So here's the thing about these unboxings.

[25:53] It kind of was driving me crazy.

[25:55] First and foremost, when I saw this machine in someone's home, it was a glorious moment.

[26:00] I mean, I know it took them three months, but as I said, it would be worth the wait.

[26:05] And I think everyone who's looking at this game is realizing that this might be the

[26:09] nicest pinball masterpiece we've seen in the last decade.

[26:14] It might be one of the nicest pinball packages of all time.

[26:18] And I think universally everyone feels that way when they see the game.

[26:22] And I think people who are unboxing it and actually experiencing the game are realizing

[26:27] that this pinball machine is really special.

[26:30] It's really unique and it just creates a pinball experience like no other.

[26:34] We've talked enough about it.

[26:35] Now what's killing me is this though.

[26:37] Is this game has like 600 RGB LEDs and nobody whose unboxed this machine has actually

[26:45] taken a video of showing all the lights in this game going off in a room.

[26:50] I mean, I don't want to just see the play field lights.

[26:53] I want to see what those under cabinet lights are doing, the lights on the back of the

[26:57] back box.

[26:58] I want to see this whole thing going in crazy CE fashion.

[27:02] I want to see how the coma ball lock works, but we're not getting any videos.

[27:06] It's like these guys are just like unboxing it and putting it in the room.

[27:10] But let us see all of that glory.

[27:13] Can someone please do that?

[27:14] And I want to see all of the lights.

[27:16] So here was like the ridiculous part of the guns and roses unboxings of the collector's

[27:21] additions.

[27:22] So one of the coolest features is the topper.

[27:24] It's that sound bar that you get that only the CE gets.

[27:27] It makes the game 50% louder.

[27:30] So Jersey Jack sends the first allotment of CE's out to customers.

[27:35] And they forget to put the cables in the box that allow you to hook up that topper.

[27:41] Jersey Jack, you are no longer a brand new company.

[27:45] How the hell did you guys forget to include the necessary cables for people who unboxed

[27:53] their masterpieces to hook everything up on day one.

[27:57] Now I know it's a tiny little error, but it's still so annoying.

[28:01] And all of you out there know what I'm talking about.

[28:04] On the first day you have everything opened up, you want the entire experience to happen

[28:10] without any issues.

[28:12] And it's just frustrating.

[28:14] People were saying it was taking them longer to try to figure out how to hook up the

[28:18] topper than the entire machine itself.

[28:22] I heard from them that they realized the mistake.

[28:24] They will include the cables obviously in all games moving forward.

[28:28] And I want to say this.

[28:29] Look, making all 500 collectors additions at once is the right move.

[28:34] I know that Ellie people now have to wait a little bit longer.

[28:38] But here's the real thing.

[28:40] Jersey Jack Pimbal needs two lines.

[28:44] They need to have two lines constantly running at all times.

[28:48] It's clear that nobody really wants the SE of GNR.

[28:52] Jersey Jack Pimbal needs to stop with the pro edition.

[28:55] They need to stop making the base level model of these games.

[28:58] The games are underwhelming.

[29:00] The games look barren.

[29:02] There's no point.

[29:03] You make a premium product, Jersey Jack.

[29:05] Stop making the pro version of the game.

[29:07] I know that's a pat-law or decision.

[29:10] I know that's you trying to break into the operator market.

[29:13] You're not for operators.

[29:14] You are the Bentley and Bugatti of Pimbal.

[29:18] He feels that way.

[29:19] Stern Pimbal is the hertz of Pimbal.

[29:22] They make games for the masses.

[29:24] Stern Pimbal is the kind of thing where it's like a rena-car.

[29:26] I don't want to see Jersey Jack Pimbal at hertz.

[29:30] You shouldn't be able to go see a Jersey Jack at a rena-car location.

[29:34] And that's what the SE feels like.

[29:36] I didn't like it in Wanka.

[29:38] Even in Wanka, we had a little bit more in it.

[29:40] But GNR SE is just a big mistake.

[29:42] It's a waste of time making those.

[29:44] I think Jersey Jack needs two lines.

[29:47] If Jersey Jack had two lines, it would be such a different company because one line should

[29:52] be constantly making GNR L.E.'s non-stop GNR L.E.'s.

[29:57] Then you have your second line that makes your C.E.'s at the same time.

[30:02] And here's what they could do if they had two lines like this.

[30:06] Line 1 was just constantly cranking out L.E.'s.

[30:09] How awesome would it be in six months if Line 2 switched over to maybe a small run of pirates?

[30:16] Or Line 2 switched over to another run of maybe Willy Wonka's depending on demand?

[30:21] You see what I'm saying?

[30:22] They need to be able to make two games at once because ultimately, this company is going

[30:27] to have to be able to make Guns and Roses and Toy Story at the same time.

[30:34] But they've got to be able to make both those games at the same time, at volume.

[30:39] If Jersey Jack can't get over this manufacturing hump, and it really comes down to this, this

[30:44] company needs to be able to make quantity of two machines at once of different machines.

[30:51] And they've never been able to do it.

[30:53] They really have never been able to do it.

[30:55] And it's what's going to kill them in the future because you can't just make GNR for

[31:00] the next two years and then announce Toy Story and not have the ability to make it at volume.

[31:06] Because people don't want to wait like 18 months to get a game if they order that game

[31:11] on day one.

[31:12] And I think Toy Story is going to be another hit.

[31:15] I think they need to grow to the point where two lines are going efficiently throughout the

[31:20] year.

[31:21] And that'll be great for everybody.

[31:22] It'll be a win-win for everybody.

[31:24] But that's my final advice for all you guys out there.

[31:26] If you want to Guns and Roses collectors edition, just wait.

[31:29] The prices are going to come down.

[31:31] These games are masterpieces.

[31:33] I really do think if you bought this game, it's going to be the kind of game you want

[31:36] to hold on for the rest of your life.

[31:38] Because if you flip it for a profit, and I mean this.

[31:41] Let's say you flip Guns and Roses for $6,000 more than you paid.

[31:46] How far is that $6,000 going to get you in life?

[31:49] How fast are you going to spend that money on other stuff?

[31:52] And then if you want to go get another GNR CE, it's going to cost you that much to go

[31:57] get it.

[31:58] And I really do believe that GNR CE is a special game.

[32:01] I think it looks phenomenal.

[32:03] I think 10 years from now, when we start to look at all of the special machines that came

[32:08] out of this second heyday of Pimball.

[32:11] I think Guns and Roses collectors edition is going to be at the top of that list or

[32:15] near the top of that list on some of the few games that are going to go down as masterpieces

[32:21] that have stood the test of time.

[32:23] And I really do feel that way.

[32:25] Now, a few pieces that we forgot to mention.

[32:28] One is, how is the play field quality?

[32:30] Now we don't know for sure that the play fields have been fixed.

[32:34] The games are shipping with clear plastic washers underneath the sling post.

[32:40] Now I don't love seeing that because it shows me that they're still implementing a preventative

[32:45] measure to try to keep pooling from happening around those posts.

[32:50] My question is, what would happen if you removed those washers?

[32:54] Would it pool?

[32:55] Would it not?

[32:56] Now I also am not one of these people that is so annoyed by this.

[32:59] I mean, whatever.

[33:00] They're there.

[33:01] If these things hold up and don't pool around the washers, then I will say that Miracle

[33:07] has done its job and people have games that have quality play fields.

[33:11] Time will tell.

[33:12] We will see how these guns and roses play fields hold up over time.

[33:16] The other thing I'm hearing from owners is that you need to switch out the rubbers, that

[33:21] you should put in Titan rubbers on your game.

[33:23] That the gameplay is significantly improved if you switch in Titan rubbers.

[33:28] And so I plan to do that on my Guns and Roses CE.

[33:31] I plan to put in purple Titan rubbers, especially on the flippers.

[33:35] I saw people put green ones on that also look good, but purple to me seems like the

[33:40] right color to go here.

[33:42] Why Jersey Jack Pimbal doesn't give you better Pimbal rubbers on their games is beyond

[33:47] me.

[33:48] I don't understand it.

[33:49] Come on Jersey Jack, give us Titan rubbers from the factory.

[33:51] You know they're better.

[33:52] What else is going on in Pimbal?

[33:54] So I talk to Dave Peck, you know my friend who's in on a Raza, and I asked him to hit up

[33:58] deep rude and ask them if they would share any images they might have of manufacturing,

[34:04] anything.

[34:05] Anything you could get his hands on, now that he had a deposit on a Raza.

[34:08] And the response he got from deep root was that Robert made the decision not to share

[34:14] any imagery or videos of manufacturing.

[34:17] Okay, so that is the official response from deep root.

[34:20] You are not going to see any manufacturing between now and the day in which you get your

[34:25] game.

[34:26] So all of you deposit people will be in the dark on the one thing that needs to take place

[34:31] for you to get your games.

[34:32] I want to say this, you know as I think about deep root saying that these games are going

[34:36] to be $13,000 and people who got them early got a discount at $9,000, when I see people

[34:44] spending this money on toppers and I see people spending tons of money on mods and I see

[34:48] Stern Jack in the prices up.

[34:50] I almost feel like deep root didn't really need to do as much as they did.

[34:54] I mean this, I feel like deep root could have been successful if they just put a working

[35:00] Raza in a standard cabinet with beautiful artwork.

[35:04] I think two years ago, you take away the pin bar.

[35:08] I think two years ago they could have started to sell Raza's as it is without a pin bar

[35:14] and been completely fine.

[35:16] I actually think they would have had no problem selling two to 300 games if they had the

[35:20] wraparound artwork like they do and think about the pin bar.

[35:24] Like do you really need it there?

[35:25] I just feel like everything that's on that pin bar could have been done on the back box

[35:30] LCD.

[35:31] You could have used the flipper buttons to make your selection quickly.

[35:34] We've seen every single pin bar machine throughout history utilize a screen like that,

[35:39] especially when it comes to selecting things.

[35:41] I get why they did it.

[35:42] I get why they wanted to have some different technology and innovation to separate them

[35:47] from what's going on in the pin bar world.

[35:49] I just don't think it was worth it.

[35:51] I don't think people are going in on this because of that technology and I don't think

[35:55] anything I've seen in terms of the videos of how that technology is implemented is

[36:00] making the pin ball experience that much better.

[36:03] That justifies five years of R&D to get to this point.

[36:06] That's my point is all you really need is a pin ball machine in a box.

[36:10] You show it to people.

[36:11] You tell them how much it's going to cost and where this hobby is at right now.

[36:15] There is so much demand for anything new pin ball related that if you just have a working

[36:20] game that's fully featured.

[36:22] I do think you're going to get a few hundred people to come in as customers.

[36:25] What do you think?

[36:26] Do you think deep route would have been successful if they left out the pin bar and just made

[36:30] this game in a normal cabinet.

[36:32] You could have the back box be a little bit different.

[36:34] What do you think?

[36:35] Email me at canadapimbal at gmail.com.

[36:37] I want to know if you think that the pin bar was necessary for deep route or they could

[36:41] have been in market two years ago and caught this wave as COVID and people pent up in their

[36:47] homes are dropping so much coin on pin ball machines.

[36:51] Here they are still trying to get this game into a box and into people's homes.

[36:56] Alright, let's call it a wrap.

[36:58] I'm still sick.

[36:59] I'm still not back.

[37:00] You can hear it in my voice.

[37:01] I'm still not a hundred percent.

[37:03] I'm still not a hundred percent.

[37:04] I'm super excited to get you guys my top ten pin ball themes that were never made that

[37:10] should have been made.

[37:11] It's going to be a really fun podcast.

[37:13] I'm just waiting for some of my energy to return because I don't want to do it sounding

[37:18] fatigued and sounding tired.

[37:20] Thank you everybody for listening to episode 553 of canada's pin ball podcast.

[37:25] We'll be back shortly with more shows.

[37:27] Stay healthy.

[37:29] Stay happy.

[37:30] It's a new year but it still feels a lot like last year.

[37:33] It really does.

[37:34] I can't wait until I can see all of you again at shows and I can go out there and play

[37:39] pin ball safely without any masks on or gloves and we can just hang out and have beers and

[37:45] talk pin ball.

[37:46] Everybody have a good night.

[37:47] We'll talk to you soon.
