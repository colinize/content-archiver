[00:00] We put the good and a good and a good life

[00:02] We put the good and a good life

[00:05] We put the bad and the bad, now we are right

[00:08] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, don't shoot

[00:17] Happy Easter weekend everyone

[00:20] It is a good life that we are all still here

[00:23] We are all above ground

[00:25] and we all have pinball on our minds on our weekly base

[00:29] basis. I think it's great that all of you out there have found pinball to be a

[00:34] passionate hobby that is that is exciting that has great individuals and I

[00:41] want to just thank all of you who listen to this show. It's great seeing every

[00:45] new podcast go up and have around seven or 800 listens just within a couple

[00:49] days. I think that's incredible and it's all because of you guys. You enjoy

[00:53] this show, you enjoy the weekly format and I do it for that reason and we

[00:58] cover the news. We cover stuff as it happens. So speaking of news on this sort

[01:03] of Easter Sunday edition of Canada's pinball podcast episode 111 I have to

[01:10] start out by saying I'm a little hung over today so bear with me. Okay I might

[01:14] go in some different tangents but we're gonna start with the big news item of

[01:19] the day and that is the fact that Stern pinball cabinets are cracking.

[01:24] There are creases that are forming in the cabinets and the cabinets are

[01:29] I won't say cracking they're splitting right splitting is the word that we see

[01:33] used most frequently and it's happening at the joints right so in the front of

[01:37] the cabinet where the two pieces of wood meet sort of like a hairline crease or

[01:43] split is happening that causes the decal there to wrinkle and this is really

[01:51] problematic and I also think this couldn't happen at a worse time for Stern

[01:55] pinball. It seemed like they just got out of the woods with the playfield issues

[02:01] that plagued ghost busters. They still have not fulfilled the majority of people

[02:07] who are promised new playfields and now we're seeing all these pictures

[02:12] uploaded of Aerosmith and Ghostbusters pinball machines that have splitting

[02:17] cabinets and this sucks this is terrible timing right we are all excited for

[02:24] Star Wars and the last thing people want as they as they sort of think about

[02:29] the most highly anticipated Stern pinball machine of all time is that there's

[02:34] gonna be another major quality issue and and I don't know why this is happening

[02:39] I don't know why I will reach out to the people over at Stern but something is

[02:43] wrong and there is definitely some sort of quality issue or cost-cutting

[02:48] measure that keeps coming back time and time again to bite Stern in the ass and

[02:54] I don't know why they're doing it I really don't I don't know why they've changed

[02:58] any of the formula that they had years ago that didn't create any of these

[03:03] quality issues in the name of making more money and the name of profit because

[03:08] every time Stern has tried to do something that is a cost-cutting measure it's

[03:13] always backfired and they've always had to go back and and fix the problem and

[03:18] it's so much more expensive for them now to have to replace people's cabinets

[03:23] then it is to just make the cabinets the way you used to and whatever the

[03:28] issue is whether it's the supplier whether it's the manufacturer I don't care

[03:33] right I don't want to speculate about the joints they're using the manufacturer

[03:37] they need to go back and make these things rock solid because Stern they know

[03:44] better than anybody that collectors are the new target for them and collectors

[03:50] are OCD collectors go over their machines with a fine tooth fine brush what is

[03:57] the fight I don't see this is the hangover part but they go over their pin

[04:01] meticulously and they don't want to see something like this happen and the

[04:06] fact that it's happening on Ghostbusters on Aerosmith the fact that they now

[04:11] have to use decals that don't even go near the edge of the cabinet is sort of

[04:16] worrisome because it's showing people that Stern might know that this is

[04:21] going to happen and they're trying to adjust the decals to avoid people's

[04:27] seeing it right it's not as bad if there's not a decal that's wrinkling but

[04:33] that's not a fix that's not a fix so we're gonna really monitor this closely

[04:38] but I would hate to see this cause another major delay for Stern because they

[04:44] just again got out of the woods with the playfields and if people get star

[04:49] wars and this happens to their machines I don't know I really don't know how

[04:56] they're gonna fix this problem because you just can't nail people these humongous

[05:00] cabinets and have them do switchovers this is not and this this is even harder

[05:04] to change than a playfield so I think Stern is going to be working around the

[05:11] clock to figure out what's causing this and look we know that Stern will

[05:15] identify and solve problems with a listen they read Pinside they know the issues

[05:20] but this is bad news this is really bad news and it really makes me think twice

[05:27] about about Star Wars about future pins from Stern because quality is

[05:33] everything quality is everything with collectibles like these and Stern for

[05:39] the price they're charging it's embarrassing that these machines are not even

[05:44] close to the quality they were when they made Lord the Rings when they made

[05:48] Simpsons pinball party you know they they've really cheapened out in every area

[05:54] of the machine while at the same time have raised their prices this doesn't

[06:00] work Stern Mercedes doesn't cheapen their cars as they raise the prices they

[06:06] make them more solid and so Stern you I know you're listening I know you're

[06:12] reading Pinside and I know you're gonna fix it what you need to do is you need

[06:18] to tell the bean counters that that keep telling you to remove the glass from

[06:22] the translates remove you know the thick decals and put thin decals on you need

[06:28] to take those bean counters that are going through your product and showing you

[06:32] every place you can you can save money like cheaper switches on the machines

[06:37] everything has been downgraded to become a cheaper way to make the machine

[06:44] while at the same time the price is increased and I think this it's blowing up

[06:49] in their faces there's never been a cost-cutting measure for Stern that is

[06:53] ever really worked out for them it's just made it more expensive in the long run

[06:57] as they have to now solve these problems so we're gonna monitor the situation

[07:01] closely I will reach out to my friends at Stern and see what the deal is but

[07:07] again terrible timing Star Wars everyone wants Star Wars to be perfect in every

[07:13] way not just the theme is perfect because we know the movies are amazing we don't

[07:17] want the game to just be amazing we want the quality of the machine to be just

[07:21] as good as the theme is and and I think Stern needs to figure what the F is going

[07:27] on here before they even start making Star Wars so I hope they do that because

[07:31] if we see Star Wars pinball machines splitting there's gonna be hell to pay

[07:37] believe me believe me and they know that you're they know that all right what

[07:43] else is going on in the pinball world that canada wants to talk about hung over

[07:47] on a Saturday morning well first of all guys go get today's Wall Street Journal

[07:52] the weekend edition of the Wall Street Journal has a story about magic girl in

[07:57] it I was interviewed along with Justin Kelly along with Scott Goldberg

[08:01] at American pinball it's a really good story it's a really good story and I

[08:05] know you lot of you guys saw the story on that popular science did about

[08:09] magic girl I didn't set up the Wall Street Journal one I did set up the pop

[08:15] side one and I look I saw some you guys on Pinside being like the second I

[08:19] saw that canada was involved I you saved me the time from reading it I want to

[08:25] tell you guys who are who who think that this story is about me you're you're

[08:30] dead wrong the stories about John pop it both of them are about J pop and

[08:34] neither story paints John in in a good light and it's the true story it's the

[08:40] true story some of you thought I was gonna show this game you really thought I

[08:44] would like go to the press and just be like it's rare it's collectible

[08:48] rar rar I have one you don't know that's not what the stories about the

[08:52] stories about this creative pinball genius who goes off and can't finish a game

[08:59] and loses all this money for people and delivers a product that doesn't work

[09:03] it's the actual interesting story of the mad scientist known as J pop so you

[09:08] guys should read both stories I think they're really well written both of them

[09:12] and it's not canada's show in the game it doesn't change the fact that I still

[09:17] love magic on I think it's rare and beautiful and and is a highly

[09:21] collectible pinball machine but some of you guys need to let go of the anger you

[09:27] have against me out there it's it's it's kind of incredible you know I still

[09:31] hear people bring it up the fixer Felix Claw story from years ago like four

[09:36] years ago three years ago that that hatchet has been buried so many times over me

[09:43] and the guy have solved our issues with it but people won't let it go so I

[09:47] I can't I can't change people who are stubborn and won't listen to reason what I

[09:54] will say is this for those people that refuse to even like listen to this

[09:57] podcast you guys know this they're missing out they're missing out there is no

[10:02] other pinball podcast that I would rather listen to and I know I'm being a

[10:06] little like a egotistical there but this one gets right to it it's it's

[10:11] it's current it's relevant and it's fun if you're into pinball and pinball

[10:15] collecting there's no other podcast that would satiate what you want to talk

[10:20] about because we never go into those boring areas like we're gonna talk about

[10:23] right now the other news item which is pre-orders are back in a big way and

[10:30] American pinball is accepting pre-orders on who Dini I was like what what

[10:38] why why are we here again have we learned nothing when it comes to pre-orders

[10:44] and this whole new approach to pre-ordering is I love it it's all like don't

[10:49] you worry you can't lose money with this pre-order model because give us your

[10:54] money and it's a hundred percent refundable like that's the new thing

[10:59] refundable pre-orders are are supposed to make us feel good because when

[11:05] pre-orders weren't refundable a lot of people lost money and what do I think

[11:10] about American pinball accepting pre-orders on who Dini and all these

[11:14] distributors were sort of spamming pinside with get your who Dini order in

[11:20] now we're accepting 250 bucks that's refundable like I think it's early to be

[11:27] pre-ordering who Dini I don't know when the game is gonna come out I do know one

[11:32] thing games never come out when as planned no new manufacturer has ever hit

[11:39] their date so if you think you're getting who Dini in late 2017 I hope you do

[11:46] but history has shown that games never go out when these new manufacturers

[11:54] intend them to no one has really been able to do it and hit those dates other

[12:00] than spooky but everybody else everybody else has had delays everyone else has

[12:05] had issues and there's one thing to build a prototype there's one thing to do

[12:10] with American pinball did which is bring a couple games to shows and show you a

[12:15] real game and we've seen too history is proven that as long as you get that

[12:20] far people are willing to give you their money now that those two games are not

[12:25] an indication in my book that American pinball can build a hundred games a

[12:30] month can build 50 games a month whatever they're planning to build production

[12:35] for these guys and the ability to produce and manufacture collector quality

[12:40] games for your home has not yet been proven I look I'm good friends with the

[12:47] people over to American pinball I am so proud of what they pulled off in a

[12:51] short period of time but I do think they've made the biggest mistake ever and

[12:57] they've put a price on this machine before they have the bomb right they've

[13:02] priced this game at seven thousand dollars a unit before they finally like

[13:07] finish the design of the game and I think that is a ginormous mistake and I

[13:12] think that could lead to some problems and I've told them why did you guys do

[13:16] this the the right approach is to design the game fully designed finish the

[13:21] design and then look at and be like how much does this cost to make the way we

[13:25] want to make the game and then price it because now they've got a price and

[13:29] what if they want to like redesign a mech or put something amazing and that

[13:33] raises the bomb by another like thousand dollars are they gonna raise the

[13:37] price now that they've got everyone locked in for a seven thousand dollar

[13:40] promise I just think it's a mistake and I think pre-ordering is silly I want to

[13:45] say this all these new like refundable pre-orders are are bullshit and here's

[13:50] why because why do they need them so why does the distributor have to hold on

[13:56] the money on a game that's not going to be ready for almost a year like why

[14:01] why does what why does it distribute or need your 250 bucks why does a

[14:05] distributor need a thousand dollars refundable for a collector's edition

[14:10] dialed in like why are they just holding on to the money you know some people

[14:14] tell me well well can it is because the manufacturers need to know who's really

[14:19] serious about the game so they can figure out how many they're gonna build and

[14:24] this and that but that's bullshit because it's refundable guys who have it

[14:29] you everyone could just bail on day one because if you don't lose money at all

[14:35] on your deposit then what yeah of course it's like putting your money under

[14:40] your mattress you can just go get it a hundred percent of the money back then

[14:45] the manufacturer can get screwed so for example if Jack goes and makes a 150

[14:50] collector's edition dialed in and and then what if everybody just says you know

[14:55] when he shows it screw it I don't want it and I get my thousand dollars back then

[14:59] what is Jack do right so we keep hearing time and time again that these deposits

[15:05] are are are really like the best way to secure a spot and I think it's bullshit I

[15:10] think the best way to to be on a list for a game is the way JJ we heard him in the

[15:15] last podcast does it just put people's names on a list and you can let the

[15:19] manufacturers know this is how many people are are on my Houdini list the fact

[15:24] that they've given 250 bucks I don't think means anything I don't think it's

[15:28] in the indication that those are gonna turn into real orders and I think it's

[15:33] silly that we're back in the pre-order game again again and I also think it's

[15:40] absolutely idiotic because I'm seeing this in the alien thread a lot where people

[15:44] are complaining that coin takers not getting back to them about alien and coin

[15:48] takers non-responsive and Andrew's really responsive so I wish I would have

[15:53] bought directly from Andrew and not coin taker everyone who says that

[15:58] you guys are insane your money is safe with coin taker

[16:02] Chris over there has your money if you want to get out of alien you can get your

[16:08] money back because it's not tied up in Andrew's business if you ordered

[16:12] directly from Andrew and anything happens with that company your money's gone

[16:17] it's evaporated if you want to get a refund right now on alien good luck getting

[16:22] that refund you will it will take you months to get that refund um distributors are

[16:28] in place to help protect you from the manufacturers right you you shouldn't

[16:33] invest in a pinball company right the 250 bucks that people are putting down

[16:38] on Houdini that money is not going to American pinball to help American pinball pay

[16:43] for pay for development and that's the problem with alien pre-order money

[16:48] guys and you guys are the people in that thread like don't want to admit

[16:52] the people who paid in full for alien pinball that money didn't go to building that person's

[17:00] machine that money went to buying those big pieces of machinery that Andrew has that money went

[17:08] to paying Andrew's employees their wages that money went to keeping the lights on at highway

[17:14] pinball for years so all those people's money has simply gone to the development of the game

[17:22] it's also gone to the operational costs of highway pinball that money didn't go to their machines

[17:30] right so then the very simple conclusion is when he goes to build the machines that pre-order

[17:37] money that paid in full money there is no money to build that individual's machine that is why

[17:44] I think highway pinball is in huge trouble because of all the delays any manufacturer that does

[17:51] that that takes people's money to to to help with the business and not build the actual game

[17:57] is is really rolling the dice right and and I don't know why nobody says this on the thread

[18:04] I've never seen a manufacturer get more passes and buys on pinside of my entire life and I don't

[18:13] know why if if someone communicates to you right we saw this with jack we saw this with Andrew

[18:19] there's something that people do on pinside and pinball collectors do too frequently just because

[18:24] someone is talking to you doesn't mean they're telling you the truth communication doesn't equal

[18:31] credibility communication doesn't equal security I don't care if someone communicates with me

[18:40] because if what they're communicating is a flat out lie or a deception what is it matter that Andrew

[18:47] gets right back to you and that's why you want to pay in full okay Chris from coin taker isn't

[18:54] getting back to you reason why Chris from coin taker is not getting back to people because there is

[19:00] no news on production he doesn't want to take more money from people he is not he is not 100%

[19:07] confident he's going to get games anytime soon he's protecting you with his silence

[19:14] you to get that people like sometimes I read these threads and I'm like I don't get it I don't get

[19:20] it you know we did the same thing like jack used to talk all the time but jacks of salesman

[19:24] Andrews of salesman both of them are salesman both of them had no idea how expensive it would be

[19:33] to start a pinball company and both of them ran into the same financial problems and here we are

[19:40] with American pinball now I don't know dovels financial situation we know that he you know it comes

[19:45] from a successful business his father's probably got a lot of money you know these are things that

[19:49] are probably true and they're self finance which I think is good American pinball has never asked

[19:55] you to finance their company but it's still so early in the life of that company to give money

[20:03] and to put the positive down so that's that's all I want to say is I don't think anyone's learned a

[20:08] lesson now and I think that people are really in the same position they were five years ago I think

[20:15] it's so easy to burn people and rip people off and steal people's money in the pinball world I don't

[20:20] think you guys will ever learn your lessons I think some of you have but I'm still just confused

[20:29] and flabbergasted when I see people boasting like I paid in full like there are probably a few

[20:35] morons out there who paid in full for Houdini who said I want I want the first one I'm going to pay

[20:40] in full you know and I think that's an idiotic move I think it's an idiotic move for people who are

[20:45] paying in full for alien right now to bump the line and and why that why that tactic isn't more

[20:53] shunned upon is beyond me the whole notion that you can cut the line if you pay in full all that

[20:59] is is a cash grab guys it's a simple cash grab and and it it reeks of of a desperate move it reeks of

[21:09] you know financial problems and people do it and they pay in full I love alien take my money and

[21:16] now I know I don't know what's going on look when will we see the alien Ellie artwork I'm sort of

[21:23] segueing into like highway now you look I brought up last time Andrew's comments about Fox

[21:29] look I'm gonna say this and I I you know I'm I'm choosing my words carefully again because I just

[21:37] I want to say I did a little investigating into the licensing issue and I didn't I didn't contact

[21:44] Fox I I just know that um Andrew's sort of going at this licensing he's doing the deals with Fox

[21:51] there's no mediator helping him out um he's not using the services of of of of a third party to

[21:58] help negotiate these deals and you know I hope he gets it out I look I'm betting against it because

[22:05] I I make my bets because I'm trying to pressure him to get you guys your games and I think you paid

[22:11] long enough I think you weighed it long enough and I think you deserve alien pinball if alien

[22:16] doesn't come out by the release of alien covenant does it even matter though I I think you guys

[22:21] who are in on this have have have just sort of you've sort of given up there's this weird period you

[22:28] hit where you uh you know you you blow by enough release dates and then the owners start to just be

[22:34] like well I saw some guy write well I'll just be happy if I get my Ellie alien sometime in 2018

[22:41] so what that shows me is that people get beaten down so much to the point where they literally give up

[22:48] and they will they'll accept the game whenever it comes out really they'll accept it whenever

[22:54] and we saw that with the magic girl owners um we we're seeing that with the Lebowski owners

[22:59] and it's really sad it to me it's the it's the last place you want to be is is is in limbo and then

[23:06] your attitude about the new pinball machine you're about to get becomes sort of this like reserved

[23:12] apathy you're sort of just you know it is what it is bitching about it won't help it come out any

[23:18] faster um and you know you you kind of don't want to ask hard questions you don't want to go after

[23:26] the manufacturer because then you're really nervous like maybe I'll be the one that exposed is

[23:32] a big issue and then the whole company will collapse so I don't want to be that person

[23:36] the only reason I stay on these manufacturers is because I think somebody has to I think somebody

[23:44] has to ask those hard questions and keep them honest and if we don't if we don't I think we're

[23:51] letting these manufacturers get away with something that they shouldn't get away with and I hear

[23:58] from some of you guys out there you're like Chris like stop talking about highway let it go

[24:03] and I and I won't I won't because again like this is a news program and I will cover these manufacturers

[24:08] and I will ask the hard questions of them because I think that pinside has become this environment

[24:13] that doesn't allow that dialogue and and I think that's a problem if if if these companies fail

[24:19] like if Dutch fails if highway fails um there is going to be so much I told you so going around

[24:27] there's going to be so much uh people who are like why didn't you moderators let more people

[24:34] share the information they had when they had it instead of deleting it right there there is no

[24:40] way around that that specific information has been deleted many times um that have shown that these

[24:47] companies were we're heading in the wrong direction and we're getting in hot water with people's

[24:52] money and that information was simply scrubbed off of pinside so people can have revisionist history

[25:00] all they want um I think we're we're we're getting here sort of like the middle of April and

[25:06] I you know I don't know what the the delay is on the the early artwork and look I think what this

[25:12] show's done successfully is a few things this show has got ten um them to stop saying two weeks

[25:18] right I got them to stop saying two weeks which was the promise this show has also made the

[25:23] early artwork the focal point of what's going on with the company because it's important to create

[25:30] an issue that you shine a light on and because by doing that that single thing like where is the

[25:38] alien early artwork that single subject now becomes um an indicator for whether or not things are

[25:46] moving in the right direction and the fact that we still don't have it to me shows that there's

[25:53] there's really some issues going on over there and and we're not being told the truth and if if

[25:58] that's if if what I'm doing is wrong and hurting pinball uh then tell me but I don't think it is

[26:05] I don't think it is all right what else is going on in the pinball world where we're going to wrap

[26:10] up that by saying look I don't think you guys should preorder I think you guys who have paid

[26:14] in fall on alien or Lebowski or you know dialed in I think it's foolish I think it's foolish wait

[26:21] to see if these games actually get into production and wait to see what the quality is because every

[26:27] time I hear Andrew saying we're still making tweaks man all those people who already bought machines

[26:32] those machines are prototypes those they're they're going to be changes made that won't be

[26:36] implemented into those machines um okay so look doesn't matter what I say people are going to

[26:42] pay in fall tomorrow on Houdini I know it uh what else is going on in the pinball world Jeremy

[26:47] Packer our good friend Zombie Yeti uh has listed on eBay uh the prototype translate for magic girl

[26:56] very cool it is up to eight hundred plus dollars right now with a week to go in that auction

[27:04] I'm really excited to see uh what this sells for it's also indicative of John's foolishness when

[27:12] it came to raising money for magic girl when I look at photos of John's shop and videos of the shop

[27:18] the man is sitting I I I shit you not on a couple million dollars in artwork and assets John

[27:27] should have sold uh the art and he should have uh marketed the materials he was making in a better

[27:35] way than he did it's like Ferrari right Ferrari sells so much clothing and merchandise uh they

[27:42] probably make almost they probably make more money Ferrari I would assume on their on their

[27:47] materials that aren't actually cars right more people own a Ferrari jacket than owner Ferrari

[27:53] and John could have sold magic girl artwork and all the great artwork that was created for

[27:58] Raza and Alice uh and made made I I'm I think he could have made a few million bucks I really do

[28:06] every every single piece now you could argue that the reason why like each piece is selling for a lot

[28:11] is because there's only one but I think everyone would happily have paid you know five hundred

[28:17] bucks or limited edition print if made five hundred of them you know they get twenty five thousand

[28:21] right there it's like you know again I think John could have made a lot of money with the art but he

[28:25] didn't but but we support Jeremy he's a good friend um and I I'm I'm actually trying to I want a

[28:31] bit on it too maybe I don't need it I already got one but we'll see um what else is going on in

[28:36] the pinball world so I'm trying to we're gonna check in with Jerry to see if p3 has shipped or

[28:42] is shipping soon so that is um that is something that we're looking forward to Dutch pinball we we

[28:49] do expect an update this week this is like remember when they said two weeks um that is this week

[28:56] so do we think we're gonna get good news from touch pinball I hope so I hope so that's dragged on

[29:01] long enough uh Kevin Koolik thread has been blowing up uh the update there is Keith is a rock star

[29:08] and Kevin's screwed Kevin's wife is screwed uh they are not gonna get away with it I haven't been

[29:14] following up on like everything but what I know is this Keith is the man and he is gonna nail Kevin

[29:21] to across uh pretty fitting for uh for this Easter to to have that be the outcome for that guy um

[29:29] what else total annihilation we didn't get any we have to wait for spooky's podcast before we

[29:34] get more information from Scott on total annihilation um but I know a lot of you guys are debating the

[29:40] price we've talked about it uh I look I think total annihilation is gonna be really cool uh I think

[29:47] that it's gonna be more than six thousand dollars and and I think it showed a lot of people

[29:53] that simple fun pinball it can be the way to go it can be the way to go uh total annihilation

[30:01] is it more fun to play than alien I don't know probably and it's simpler to make that's the thing is

[30:07] you know I think pinball is gone in this direction where people try to always do so much but they

[30:12] lose focus pinball machines can be a lot of fun with just lights with just art and just great music

[30:19] and a few interesting shots you don't need to have all this stuff going on I had a bunch of people

[30:24] over last night for dinner they jumped on magic girl and they had a good time yes it's funny because

[30:28] I told them like you really won't know what you're missing because the majority of casual players

[30:33] have no clue there's even code or there's modes or there's progression to do in the game

[30:39] and so they just enjoyed it um it's weird it's weird I was like well maybe this is what John was

[30:45] trying to make now no that wasn't what he was trying to make but but you can tell when you look at

[30:49] the magic girl playfield that John really didn't have like modes and code in mind when at all

[30:57] when he designed it like there's really not a lot of inserts that are that are indicative of like

[31:02] a mode being started there's not even like inserts on like where to shoot right most games have

[31:08] inserts that tell you shoot here shoot here magic girl doesn't really have that which again means

[31:14] that John didn't really think about modes at all um but again like I don't think that would have

[31:22] mattered like if you just had a few fun things going on and the most simple code people would have

[31:25] been happy they would have been happy um attack from ours remake that should be shipping in the next

[31:32] couple months so I've heard from distributors that attack from ours remake elis are selling

[31:37] phenomenally well and I think you guys are going to be really happy with that game and we know the

[31:42] quality is going to be good well well we don't know but we'll see but um I think attack from

[31:49] ours remake is going to be a huge hit and people are going to um people are going to be moving money

[31:56] that direction I have said it like pre why pre-order a game when you can go by two day a brand new

[32:03] version of a game everyone knows is amazing all right I just I just don't understand why would you hold

[32:08] like if they make alien like let's just they'll they'll keep making it for years guys there's no

[32:14] reason to be in early and you can add all the elis stuff to any version of it so why bother why

[32:22] bother there's really no reason to go in early on Houdini because they're not limited there's no

[32:27] reason to go in early on total annihilation because they're going to keep making them um you know

[32:32] there only reason you should rush is if you think they're only there's only going to be like 500

[32:37] Ghostbusters early and you don't want to miss out on one um that's it you know there's nothing

[32:42] really else I'm waiting to see what dialed in uh collector's edition looks like I have money

[32:49] down on a collector's edition right now I don't even you know again because it does it I don't

[32:53] feel like I have money down because I could just get the money back um it's it's not an indication

[32:58] of of how I'm not really I'm on the I'm like 50 50 I'm not that serious um about it and I'll tell

[33:03] you why with dialed in I think Jack again marketing mistake he showed the game too early I've been

[33:08] seeing dialed in for six months now whatever happened to not showing the game until it's ready to

[33:13] ship I I really think by the time dialed in comes out there's going to be like fatigue I

[33:19] really do I hype doesn't last this long in pinball and I'm sort of it's like the Acura NSX

[33:27] remember they showed it for so many years it was in a super bowl spot like three four years ago

[33:31] but the time the car came out no one was excited and the car's not selling at all it's the sales

[33:36] are tanking on it I'm not saying the sales are going to tank on dialed in but if Jack had the game

[33:41] on the line and when they unveiled it he said okay you can order it and you'll have it like in a

[33:44] couple weeks he would have been inundated with orders I don't I just think again we the hype

[33:50] dies down and it feels like we've been seeing it forever Jack get it out at least show the

[33:55] collector's edition version so people who are in on that can see what's going on um that's all right

[34:04] is there anything else I am missing I'm just skimming pin side real quickly um or I did find

[34:10] this funny so the fact that total annihilation is being made by spooky what a what a cool thing but

[34:16] also whatever happened to wrath of Olympus right it clearly shows that wrath of Olympus people

[34:22] didn't really want but total annihilation they do want and wrath of Olympus if it's like eight

[34:29] thousand nine thousand dollars there wasn't a market for it there um now if spooky said look we'll

[34:35] build a hundred wrath of Olympus is for eight thousand nine thousand dollars and we'll only make

[34:40] a hundred uh do I think they would sell out the answer is yes I do um so we'll woolly see the light

[34:48] of day one day um we'll just have to wait and see but uh you know it shows that spooky will take a

[34:54] homebrew game that people really like and put it into production which which is a really it's a

[35:00] really cool thing but I think woolly is not going to find that fate um what else there's just a lot

[35:06] of pinball machines that have come up for sale nothing really that interesting uh I do find it

[35:11] funny when people are trying to sell like walking deads that are fully like modded out for eight nine

[35:15] thousand dollars I I think we're going to see a lot of walking deads come up for sale because I

[35:21] think the rumor that they're going to vault edition it is going to make some guys sort of freak out

[35:25] a little bit and want to move the game um other than that I I think I've covered everything I think

[35:31] I've covered everything it's a beautiful day I'm going to go drive uh the auto show is in town in

[35:36] New York I always love cruising by the auto show in the hellcat like there's just like thousands of

[35:41] people and you just like you pop the engine and then every everyone starts cheering like you've

[35:45] accomplished something amazing uh it's kind of awesome there's nothing like cruising by an auto show

[35:49] in a car that sounds like like a gatlin gun is going off um guys enjoy your weekend enjoy your

[35:56] Easter Sunday with with your friends and family um play pinball don't pre-order pinball uh hold

[36:04] these companies accountable for their quality hold these companies accountable for missing dates uh

[36:11] do not go soft do not go softly into the night do not become one of these guys who select

[36:19] divvly decides when he's going to give a company shit but then then turns it off when he's got money

[36:26] on a game and the those guys know who I'm talking about these guys who they they they criticize stern

[36:32] all day long and then they've got money in on on alien and they don't say anything uh look let's

[36:39] let's call a spade a spade when it happens let's keep these guys honest and remember

[36:45] just because someone's talking to you doesn't mean they're not lying to your face

[36:51] communication doesn't mean shit to me stern doesn't communicate at all at least they ship games

[36:57] consistently as much as stern has issues they will get you what you paid for and if what you paid

[37:03] for has quality issues they will fix it they will fix it um but they will feel the pain of these split

[37:11] cabinets they will um and i'll end on this note if you haven't seen the new star wars trailer go

[37:17] watch it that music alone is the reason why i will hand stern whatever they charge for limited

[37:23] addition of star wars so happy happy week and everyone um thank you for listening to
