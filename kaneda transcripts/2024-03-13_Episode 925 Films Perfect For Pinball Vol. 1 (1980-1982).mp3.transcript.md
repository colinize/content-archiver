[00:00] 🎵🎵🎵

[00:20] Ah, every time I hear that Star Wars music, I just get sad that there's not like an epic Star Wars pinball machine made in modern times

[00:29] with toys and all the good as we want, you know, all the clips from the films and the music.

[00:35] There isn't a modern game we all own and love that Steve Ritchie game was a huge miss.

[00:41] Here's what we're gonna do on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast. We're waiting for the TPF news.

[00:46] I wanted to do something different. I wanted to do something I haven't seen anybody do.

[00:51] I want to start with 1980 and go all the way to the year 2000. Not on this single episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:00] We're gonna break it up into chunks, but I want to look at all the movies that came out since 1980.

[01:06] We're gonna go off of the box office numbers and read off the top films of the year.

[01:12] And let's ask ourselves, are we missing some amazing pinball theme opportunities and discuss like which ones on the list would translate well into a pinball game?

[01:25] I don't want to keep talking about expensive toppers. They're stupid. I don't want to talk about Haggis Pinball and barbecue pinball machines.

[01:33] We all know Haggis is gonna go under and nobody's buying this barbecue game.

[01:38] I do want to add a little bit into the rumor mill before I do this on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:44] I want to talk about a theme that wasn't really discussed on what's coming next from Stern Pinball and that's Dungeons and Dragons.

[01:54] Now look, if John Borg is making the game after the next game, what do we think the next game is gonna be?

[02:02] Also this, do we think Stern is gonna count Jaws as one of the cornerstone games in 2024?

[02:11] I don't really think so because Jaws came out January 4th.

[02:16] I mean, I think that's like the last major cornerstone from 2023, just a few days short of being a 2023 reveal.

[02:25] I think we're gonna get three more games from Stern Pinball and let's talk about it real quickly.

[02:31] So John Wick is the next game. I think John Wick is gonna be designed by either George Gomez or it's gonna be designed by Keith Elwin.

[02:40] I know I keep saying Jack Danger, I'm going back on it because I'm getting new information.

[02:45] So I think we're gonna get John Wick by George Gomez or Keith Elwin.

[02:50] Then, you know, is the next game gonna be John Borg? This is where it gets weird and nothing really adds up.

[02:56] Because I do think that maybe now Pokemon is gonna be a Jack Danger game.

[03:02] And then we've got Dungeons & Dragons and we've got this Metallica coming back on Spike 3.

[03:09] Now, will Metallica be an all new game or will it be the old Metallica game ported over to Spike 3?

[03:16] Now let's just talk for a minute about D&D.

[03:19] I think Dungeons & Dragons is going to be Brian Eddy's next game.

[03:25] We know that Brian Eddy loves working with Dwight Sullivan.

[03:29] We know that Dwight loves role playing game code, right?

[03:34] That's what he put into Venom.

[03:36] And so if Dungeons & Dragons is actually a real title and not just a codename for something like Indiana Jones' Dial of Destiny, you know, D&D,

[03:46] then I think we're gonna see Brian Eddy on Dungeons & Dragons.

[03:50] Now all that being said, I still don't think Stern has these juggernaut themes.

[03:55] I mean, Pokemon is a big one. It would absolutely do well.

[03:59] But I don't think John Wick is gonna do well.

[04:02] Another Metallica? Is that what people want? I don't really think so.

[04:06] And Dungeons & Dragons doesn't sound like a hit theme to me.

[04:10] So I think Stern Pinball might be playing catch up, especially if the rumors are true.

[04:17] And the next game from CGC is going to be Gremlins.

[04:21] And Spooky Pinball might have Beetlejuice and Sonic the Hedgehog.

[04:25] And Jersey Jack has like the Matrix and Top Gun.

[04:29] And it's got Harry Potter.

[04:31] I think Stern Pinball has a lot more competition.

[04:34] And then, you know, stuff like X-Men 97.

[04:37] Is that gonna be Keith Elwin's next game?

[04:39] So a lot floating around the rumor mill.

[04:42] Let's start this right now and look at 1980.

[04:46] And the top movies of 1980, and let's ask ourselves, will go down the list.

[04:51] Which one of these films would make a great Pinball experience?

[04:55] Number one at the box office, grossing $203 million was Star Wars Episode 5.

[05:02] The Empire Strikes Back, arguably the greatest Star Wars movie of all time.

[05:07] And it sucks that this is wrapped up into Steve Ritchie and Stern's game.

[05:12] So we have it out in the world and it's just not good.

[05:15] Now the second highest grossing movie of that year is 9-5.

[05:19] Then Stir Crazy.

[05:21] Then Kramer vs Kramer.

[05:23] Then Any Which Way You Can.

[05:26] Then Private Benjamin.

[05:28] Then Cole Miner's Daughter.

[05:30] Then Smokey and the Bandit 2.

[05:32] Wow, man, what a year for weird movies, right?

[05:35] Maybe Smokey and the Bandit might be, but you're not gonna sell many games.

[05:39] Now number nine on the list, grossing $57 million.

[05:43] I think would be an interesting pin.

[05:46] I don't think it would sell very well, but it might be something that a boutique company could make work.

[05:51] And that is The Blues Brothers.

[05:54] Now after that we have Ordinary People, then we have Popeye.

[05:57] Now Popeye has already been made into a pinball machine.

[06:00] It is a horrible wide-body pinball machine, but Popeye the Sailor Man.

[06:04] That seems to be like something that may be like a spooky pinball.

[06:08] You know, a company that makes looney tunes and has been diving into older cartoons, Popeye might work.

[06:15] Now this is the live-action Popeye with Robin Williams.

[06:18] Then we get to some interesting ones here.

[06:20] Number 12 is The Shining.

[06:22] Now imagine a company like Spooky making a classic like The Shining.

[06:27] I think The Shining would work well in pinball format.

[06:31] I think it's a lot more popular than Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[06:35] And maybe it's harder to get the rights because you need Jack Nicholson's likeness.

[06:39] But The Shining is definitely a strong contender for a great pinball machine.

[06:45] Then we got Cheech and Chong's next movie.

[06:48] And number 14 is Caddyshack and 15 is Friday the 13th.

[06:53] Now talk about two games that absolutely would crush it in pinball format.

[06:58] Friday the 13th, I mean, hello Spooky.

[07:01] Come on, just give it to us.

[07:03] Then you've got Caddyshack, which we know back in the day they wanted to make a Caddyshack game,

[07:09] but they couldn't get the license so they made No Good Gophers,

[07:13] which is basically an homage to Caddyshack.

[07:16] The movie, I would love to have more comedy movies make their way into pinball format

[07:22] and Caddyshack would be incredible.

[07:25] Alright, let's keep going down the list.

[07:27] Then we've got Brew Baker, the jazz singer, Flash Gordon,

[07:31] I believe Flash Gordon was a pinball machine.

[07:34] Wasn't there a rumor that Flash Gordon was coming back?

[07:37] Then we've got Bronco Billy, Raging Ball, the Robert De Niro classic.

[07:42] We've got Xanadu, we've got American Jiggalo, My Bodyguard, Fame, Altered States.

[07:49] It's getting weird now.

[07:50] Honey Suckle Rose, Hero at Large, The Long Riders, The Island, The Nude Bomb.

[07:57] That's the top 30 movies of 1980, people.

[08:01] You know what's funny is I'm scrolling down this list and there's a lot of stuff I've never seen.

[08:06] Alright, so that's 1980.

[08:08] Let's go to 1981.

[08:10] So from this list, just to recap, from 1980, I think we're missing a great Star Wars game,

[08:16] which we don't have.

[08:17] I think The Shining, I think Caddyshack, and Friday the 13th are the strongest contenders here for pinball machines.

[08:26] Let's go to 1981.

[08:28] Oh man, number one at the list.

[08:30] Now look, I know I'm starting with the 80s, but this means we've got to go back to the 70s

[08:35] because number one on the list with $108 million is Superman II.

[08:41] Now, Superman II is amazing, right?

[08:43] That's the one where you have like Zod and Superman loses his powers.

[08:47] Incredible movie.

[08:49] But I think it's like Superman 78.

[08:51] I think that's the first one.

[08:52] If we had a Christopher Reeve Superman game, it would absolutely crush it.

[08:58] We've seen the art package that Christopher Franchi made showing people how awesome it would look.

[09:04] And I'm here to say right now, absolutely, Christopher Reeve Superman would crush it.

[09:09] It would be just like Batman 66.

[09:12] There's just something iconic and timeless about the Superman that Christopher Reeve brought to the silver screen.

[09:19] And I can't believe we don't have a classic Superman.

[09:23] Do we even have a Superman like pinball machine that's not like from the 60s or 70s?

[09:28] Nope, we don't.

[09:29] All these modern Superman movies and not one of them has been ported over to a pinball experience.

[09:35] All right, let's keep going down the list here.

[09:37] Then we got Stripes.

[09:39] Nope, that wouldn't work.

[09:40] Cannonball Run.

[09:41] I don't think that would sell today.

[09:43] Four-year Eyes Only.

[09:44] The Four Seasons.

[09:46] Excalibur.

[09:47] You know, Excalibur, the tale of King Arthur.

[09:50] I think that would work as an original IP much better than a barbecue theme or Raza.

[09:56] And I know my friend who's listening to this right now is working on Merlin, which is based on the King Arthur storyline.

[10:04] And I really hope you guys get to see this Merlin pinball machine one day because it's absolutely stunning.

[10:10] And I know he's listening to this.

[10:12] What's the latest, brother?

[10:13] Come on, send me something.

[10:15] It's been years in the making.

[10:17] And if you get this game to market, if it looks as beautiful as I've seen, you're not going to have any problems selling a few hundred of these in the current pinball market.

[10:27] All right, then we get History of the World Part One.

[10:30] That might work as a comedy.

[10:32] Bust and Lose.

[10:33] The Great Muppet Caper.

[10:35] Everybody, we've been talking about the Muppets with Jersey Jack.

[10:39] I do love the Great Muppet Caper.

[10:41] Isn't that the one with the baseball diamond?

[10:43] I think it goes without saying that if you do the Muppets right, it does have some viability in the pinball space.

[10:51] All right, so what's after that?

[10:52] We've got Endless Love in American Werewolf in London.

[10:56] Again, when you go to early 80s, it's tough, right?

[10:59] It really is tough because this was a long time ago.

[11:02] You know, even me, you know, I was born in 76.

[11:05] So even me, these movies, I don't have that much nostalgia for a lot of these movies that I'm reading.

[11:10] Here's what's crazy.

[11:11] After American Werewolf in London, Halloween II, Body Heat, and coming in at 14, right?

[11:18] This is the 14 highest grossing movie of the year is Indiana Jones, Raiders of the Lost Ark.

[11:25] How is this movie so far down when it comes to the top grossing films of 1981 with only $21.8 million and right next to it is Friday the 13th Part Two.

[11:38] Wow.

[11:39] But here's what's crazy over the lifespan of this movie.

[11:42] The total gross for Indiana Jones is $212 million.

[11:48] It's weird here that it's 14 because I see the total gross of Indiana Jones is $212 million, which puts it well above Superman II.

[11:58] So I'm going off of this box office mojo site.

[12:01] So I don't know what's happening there because the total box office for Raiders of the Lost Ark is double what Superman II is.

[12:08] So I guess that's the number one movie.

[12:10] And look, we all would love to have a brand new version of this game.

[12:14] The Ballad Williams game is really special, but who wouldn't want another Indiana Jones?

[12:20] We've been hearing rumors about it, but not sure.

[12:22] But everybody agrees it would be great.

[12:24] Friday the 13th again would be great.

[12:26] The final conflict, the incredible shrinking woman that wouldn't work under the rainbow outland, continental divide, dragon slayer, Night Hawks.

[12:36] The Legend of the Lone Ranger.

[12:38] None of these would work for Pinball.

[12:40] Let me skim down this list from 81 and see if there's anything else I think would make a good pinball machine.

[12:46] Ah, Reds, Arthur Tapps, Ghost Story, Rollover, The Hand.

[12:51] This is Elvis Finks.

[12:53] What are these movies?

[12:54] Cinderella, Silence of the North, Ragtime, Chariots of Fire.

[12:59] Alright, so that's 1981.

[13:01] Let's do one more year.

[13:02] Let's do three years every time we do this.

[13:05] We're gonna get to 1982 now.

[13:07] Alright, we're at 1982 now.

[13:09] Okay, see, I see what's happening now.

[13:11] See, remember back in the early 80s when a movie went into a theater?

[13:16] It stayed in the theater for a long time.

[13:18] Something stayed in the theater for a couple years, so a movie didn't just gross over like one summer.

[13:24] People kept going back and back to see it.

[13:26] Remember, this is pre-internet people.

[13:28] So if you wanted to see Star Wars, they kept playing it over and over.

[13:33] That's why it makes sense now when you look at the total gross, which is why in 82, the number one movie,

[13:39] can you guess what it was in 1982?

[13:42] And this would make for a great pinball machine.

[13:45] It is ET, the extraterrestrial.

[13:47] How have we not had an ET game?

[13:50] We know that Steven Spielberg is hard to license, but hello, we just got Jaws.

[13:55] And ET is far more popular than Jaws.

[13:59] Number two is Raiders of the Lost Ark.

[14:01] I guess it was in theaters for two years.

[14:03] Then we've got Rocky III.

[14:05] You know me, I would love Rocky IV.

[14:07] I think Rocky IV is the best Rocky for a pinball, like adrenaline pumping thing.

[14:12] We're going to get to that as we get into later in the 80s.

[14:15] Then we've got On Gold in Pond, in Officer and a Gentleman, Porky's.

[14:21] Porky's made $105 million at the box office.

[14:25] Again, funny movie, but it wouldn't work well in pinball.

[14:29] Then we've got Arthur.

[14:31] We've got Star Trek II, The Wrath of Khan.

[14:34] Now, obviously we've had a lot of really good Star Trek games over the years.

[14:38] So absolutely, like if you're a Trekkie, your itch has been scratched by the pinball machines that have come out.

[14:44] And almost all the Star Trek games are great.

[14:47] So I think you're happy.

[14:49] Number nine is the spooky possibility, Poltergeist.

[14:52] There's a lot of classic horror movies.

[14:55] A game like Poltergeist from Spooky, I think you could sell 750 of those if they wanted to go in a direction like that.

[15:03] What else we got? The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.

[15:06] The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.

[15:08] Well, that's what David Fick should have made.

[15:10] He would have sold more The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas than this damn barbecue theme.

[15:16] Then we've got Chariots of Fire.

[15:18] We've got Annie. First Blood, people.

[15:22] First Blood Rambo.

[15:24] Oh my gosh, this has to be made.

[15:27] How do we not have First Blood as a pinball machine?

[15:30] Take my money now.

[15:32] That first movie is incredible.

[15:34] It's a perfect theme for pinball.

[15:36] It's all right there.

[15:38] You're Rambo.

[15:39] You're trying to escape the authorities.

[15:41] You're hiding out in the woods.

[15:43] You're gaining all the items you need to survive.

[15:46] Then you go on the attack and you take out the entire police force, FBI, and the entire US military with one guy in the forest.

[15:55] It's amazing.

[15:56] You basically blow up a small town as one dude.

[15:59] All right, First Blood would be great.

[16:01] The next one I think would be interesting, Firefox.

[16:04] If you haven't seen Firefox, it's this awesome movie about this supersonic plane.

[16:09] That's all I really know.

[16:11] It was like when you were a kid and you saw Firefox, you were blown away.

[16:15] Dad, do you know there's this plane that's undetectable, that's super cool?

[16:19] It was kind of like the hunt for red October, but up in the sky.

[16:22] Like whoever had Firefox could control the world.

[16:25] So I don't know, super cool, super nerdy.

[16:28] I still think a little too niche to work in pinball format.

[16:31] And then we get number 15 here.

[16:34] Now look, look, this would be a take my money now kind of game.

[16:39] This would be awesome.

[16:40] This would be the kind of theme that barrels of fun should go after.

[16:44] And it is no other than Conan the Barbarian.

[16:47] I mean, there's no other way to say it.

[16:49] Like it would be great.

[16:50] And the fact that we don't have more Arnold, Arnold, get to the choppa games in the pinball world is just a tragedy.

[16:58] And so yes, Conan the Barbarian, number 15 from 1983.

[17:03] We need to make it.

[17:05] All right, then we have the sword and the sorcerer.

[17:07] I don't know.

[17:08] Absence of Malice, Reds, Richard Pryor live Friday the 13th, part three, man.

[17:15] They just turned on Friday the 13th and made a new one every year and we're just making money.

[17:21] They made $34 million in 1983.

[17:25] I bet that budget for the movie was like half a million dollars back then at most like a few million dollars.

[17:31] All right, then we got time bandids.

[17:33] No taps.

[17:35] Sharky's machine.

[17:36] Tootsie, the world according to Garp, Victor, Victoria, Blade Runner.

[17:43] Oh my gosh.

[17:44] How is Blade Runner all the way down the list here?

[17:47] But that is another like classic Harrison Ford perfect storyline for pinball.

[17:53] And it just goes to show you it's stuff like Blade Runner, man.

[17:57] This is where the boutique companies are going to crush it.

[18:00] If they can make a good Blade Runner game and replicants and get the footage from the first movie.

[18:05] The reason why Blade Runner would be perfect for pinball.

[18:08] It's that world under glass of Blade Runner.

[18:11] Just so damn good.

[18:13] Blade Runner, what else?

[18:14] We got fast times at Ridgemont High.

[18:16] I don't know about that.

[18:17] The toy, some kind of hero, Bambi, Pink Floyd, The Wall.

[18:22] Things are tough all over.

[18:24] Well, number 48 is interesting, Airplane 2, the sequel.

[18:28] We know the Airplane movies.

[18:30] Someone made a homebrew version of them.

[18:32] But I think the Airplane movies would do well.

[18:35] Alright, let's just stop there.

[18:36] That was three years and we went down a list.

[18:39] We grabbed about over 10 themes that would really work well in pinball format.

[18:44] And it just goes to show you we haven't even scratched the surface.

[18:49] This is just movies, let alone musical acts, let alone TV shows.

[18:53] You know, and I wish I worked in the marketing department at a pinball company.

[18:57] Because I do think these pinball companies sometimes they just don't get it.

[19:01] Like, it doesn't make any sense.

[19:03] Like, if you're David Ficks and Mukesh has all this money,

[19:06] why aren't you looking at some of these themes and saying,

[19:09] hey, what's the possibility of grabbing one of these,

[19:13] especially from the early 80s when the contracts were much easier to get all of the assets?

[19:19] If a company like MultiMorpid can get everything from the Princess Bride,

[19:24] and you've got more money and more backing you and you're David Ficks,

[19:28] there's no excuse why we're coming out with garbage games like this barbecue challenge.

[19:33] Alright, everybody, this is going to be fun.

[19:35] We're going to go through the years.

[19:36] I'm not sure I'm going to do this on every episode,

[19:38] because I really want to cover what happens at TPF.

[19:41] But let's keep diving back over the years, looking at these nostalgic years,

[19:45] looking at the movies that came out those years.

[19:48] And let's just ask ourselves, would this make for a great pinball machine?

[19:52] And are these companies missing some golden opportunities to sell

[19:56] at least a thousand or more games if they made machines based on these games?

[20:01] Everybody, have a great Wednesday. We'll talk to you soon.
