[00:00] Closing time, turn all of the lights on over every boy and every girl.

[00:10] Closing time, one last call for alcohol, so finish your whiskey or beer.

[00:22] Welcome ladies and gentlemen to episode 559 of Canadian Spinball podcast,

[00:29] and the reason why you heard Closing Time at the beginning of this podcast,

[00:34] as many of you know, I have a baby coming on the way.

[00:39] Baby Canada, no, his name is not Canada.

[00:41] I will reveal his name to the world when he is born healthy and happy,

[00:45] but you know that in a few weeks I'm about to have my first child.

[00:50] So it's only natural that I take a break from this podcast.

[00:54] The show is not going away forever, so don't worry about that.

[00:58] But I have just two more podcasts that I'm going to give to you.

[01:02] This is one of them.

[01:04] So this is one of the final two shows I'm going to do

[01:07] before I go on an extended break of Canada's pinball podcast.

[01:12] I want to say since I've been back, since episode 501,

[01:17] we did 59 new shows about pinball.

[01:21] Many, many, many of you came back and checked out the show after I went on my break last time.

[01:27] But here's the big difference.

[01:29] This is a break that I finally get to do on my terms.

[01:33] It's not someone trying to go after my employer.

[01:36] It's not someone trying to aggressively shut this show down.

[01:40] This is me being able to walk away for a while on my own terms.

[01:45] And it means so much to me that I get to do it this way.

[01:48] I really, really can't say thank you enough to everyone out there

[01:52] who came back and supported this show.

[01:54] And we came back on the airwaves.

[01:55] I really do appreciate it.

[01:57] So here's what we're going to do on this podcast.

[01:59] I interview someone that I think could fill the void for you

[02:04] as you're looking for a weekly podcast that talks about what's going on in the hobby.

[02:10] So no pressure on this guy's shoulders as I send my fan base his way.

[02:15] But the reason I love his show is it's one guy in a mic.

[02:18] He's unbiased and he just gives you his point of view without any agenda.

[02:23] And I think it's really important that we have more voices in this hobby

[02:27] that speak up and tell you how they really feel about something

[02:31] without an agenda.

[02:33] And it's getting harder and harder these days to find people who will do that.

[02:37] And I mean that.

[02:38] I mean that.

[02:39] And before I air this interview, I just want to do one quick update on what's going on

[02:43] in the Pimball world.

[02:44] And I want to give advice to one company that's come out lately

[02:48] and spoken against me in a very strident, rude and arrogant way.

[02:53] And I want to say that I have no hard feelings towards American Pimball

[02:58] and Mr. David Fix.

[03:00] We talk about him in this interview.

[03:02] And I just want to say for the record, if you want to come out

[03:05] and you want to get people excited about your Pimball company,

[03:09] the silliest thing you can do is go after Canatus Pimball podcast,

[03:13] especially when you yourself admit that the products that were put out

[03:18] that have been made fun of by Canada

[03:20] aren't even products that you really stand behind or believe in at all.

[03:24] And that's why you're changing up the company.

[03:26] Now I did listen to Zofia and she joined the super awesome Pimball show.

[03:31] I highly recommend.

[03:32] I highly recommend you listen to that interview.

[03:35] And you listen to what the new team over at American Pimball wants to accomplish.

[03:40] But I will say this and you're never going to hear stuff like this on other Pimball podcasts.

[03:45] There was a moment in that interview in which Christian line asked David Fix

[03:49] what his hopes and goals are for Zofia as she joins the team over at American Pimball.

[03:54] And David said that she's already, already reaching his goals that he has for her.

[03:59] And when asked why he said because in meetings I have ideas and she's responsive to them.

[04:05] And then here's the funniest part.

[04:07] She's only been at American Pimball for three days.

[04:10] And here we are once again doing these media tours,

[04:13] doing this victory lap before they've even shown us what they can do.

[04:17] Now I am glad Zofia is joining the team over there.

[04:20] Throughout the interview though, you realized that when they made these things over at Valley Williams,

[04:26] she was part of a team and she'll say it, we did this.

[04:30] We made this magical thing happen.

[04:32] We designed this or Bariot designed it and I worked with the team to bring it to life.

[04:37] Will this be successful taking one member from the Valley Williams engineering team and

[04:42] dropping them into American Pimball?

[04:44] I hope it works.

[04:45] I hope it's successful.

[04:47] But I do encourage them to stop talking and start doing.

[04:51] Three days on the job isn't long enough to be doing interviews and taking credit for stuff that

[04:56] hasn't happened yet, Mr. David Fix.

[04:59] And this is why Canadian Pimball podcast is the number one Pimball podcast, my friend.

[05:04] Because we are going to tell you how it really is, my man.

[05:08] You've got a lot more to lose than Canada does.

[05:11] You now have to deliver a game that is going to back up all of the flexing you've been doing

[05:16] over at American Pimball.

[05:18] And I hope it's good.

[05:19] That's all I want.

[05:20] I just want great games from these companies.

[05:22] But going after the media, we've seen deep-root do it recently.

[05:26] We've seen American Pimball do it recently.

[05:28] And it's absolutely a name to go after Canada.

[05:32] Because you know what Canada also does?

[05:35] He's fair and he's balanced.

[05:36] And that's the last thing I want to do before I air this interview.

[05:39] So for many, many shows over the last like 59 I've done, what is the topic we've

[05:44] harped on many, many times?

[05:46] Playfield quality.

[05:48] And we've done so many shows about the lack of playfield quality in most of these new games.

[05:54] And Jersey Jack Pimball was in the crosshairs for a lot of that.

[05:58] And especially those guns and roses early playfields where Mirko was once again

[06:03] experiencing pooling and chipping off of artwork on the playfields themselves.

[06:08] And we must have done about like 10 or more podcasts in which we said that Jersey Jack

[06:13] needs to fix this problem.

[06:15] This is inexcusable for such an expensive machine.

[06:18] And there is no way they can ship collectors additions if there are issues.

[06:22] Now here's always what happens.

[06:24] We complain about the problem for many, many shows.

[06:27] And then what happens if they solve the problem, it gets absolutely almost no air time.

[06:33] And we don't talk about it.

[06:34] Now I've spent the last couple weeks talking to owners of GNRC and I am here to tell

[06:40] you that they are experiencing absolutely zero pooling, zero chipping, zero issues.

[06:47] So Mirko and Jersey Jack Pimball have 100% it seems, solve this problem.

[06:53] These are the nicest playfields with the nicest quality that Jersey Jack Pimball has ever

[06:58] shipped.

[06:59] And so because of this and because we haven't had too much air time.

[07:04] I would like to say that Jersey Jack and Mirko have accomplished their goal.

[07:09] And because they've accomplished their goal and we haven't given them that much air time

[07:14] on the solution, let's air for them a one minute cheer of a goal being scored.

[08:04] Yeah, that was a lot more annoying than I thought it would be.

[08:28] But congratulations to Mirko and the team over there.

[08:30] And I know we shouldn't even have to congratulate you guys.

[08:33] You should have just done this from day one, but we're happy to see that it's working

[08:37] out.

[08:38] Okay, let me air this interview now with the man who's got a show that is super creatively

[08:44] titled a Pimball podcast.

[08:47] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canadian Pimball podcast.

[08:51] And I want to say this and I mean this Travis, you are my favorite Pimball podcast are out

[08:56] there.

[08:57] Travis, you know, maybe as Marv Loco on YouTube, Travis, welcome back to the show.

[09:01] Hey, I appreciate it.

[09:03] Thank you so much.

[09:04] It's good to be back.

[09:05] It's been a long time.

[09:06] It's been what since November?

[09:07] It's been too long.

[09:08] One of the reasons I wanted to have you back on is I'm about to have a baby and take

[09:12] a break, a hiatus.

[09:14] And I do want, as my listeners look for another Pimball podcast words, just one dude giving

[09:20] his great POV on Pimball.

[09:22] Travis, I want them to go to your show.

[09:24] And what's the name of your show for all my fans out there that haven't checked it

[09:27] out yet?

[09:28] I definitely appreciate it.

[09:29] It's literally just called a Pimball podcast.

[09:32] So somebody took Canadian Pimball podcast and I was really forced just to go with a Pimball

[09:37] podcast.

[09:38] So it is what it is.

[09:39] Yeah, I give Travis grief from like that's the least creative name, but actually you can't

[09:44] miss it.

[09:45] So here's what we're going to do.

[09:46] We're going to just go down and talk about what's going on in Pimball and talk about

[09:49] what's happening at each manufacturer because Travis, I'm curious what your thoughts and

[09:53] there's been a lot of news recently.

[09:54] I thought it was going to be like a dead year, but it's turned out to be a year in which

[09:58] so much has been going on across the board.

[10:00] How does that sound?

[10:01] Yeah, it seems like just with as many manufacturers that are really just in business right now, it's

[10:07] almost like we don't have that natural 60 day low that's been here in the past.

[10:12] It seems like it's 15, 20 days, something new happens from somebody else.

[10:16] It's just constant.

[10:18] And I noticed what's happening lately too is that companies, even when they don't even

[10:21] have a game coming out or even in the near future, they're all over the place talking

[10:26] about their intentions.

[10:27] And I think let's start off a bit ago because I think that's a good segue to American Pimball.

[10:32] Okay.

[10:33] Did you get a chance to hear the interview over at Super Awesome Pimball show with Zofia?

[10:37] I went up on Friday.

[10:39] I actually have not.

[10:40] Okay.

[10:41] So what do you think about?

[10:42] I heard your show about David Fick.

[10:43] So what do you think about American Pimball coming out right now with new management that

[10:48] got a new direction?

[10:49] Do you think they can turn this ship around?

[10:51] Do you think Dennis Norman and David Fick and this new mechanical engineer can improve

[10:55] upon?

[10:56] It's probably the bar is really low.

[10:58] What do you think is going to happen over there?

[10:59] You know, so anybody that's listened to my show, they know that I didn't necessarily

[11:03] agree with how David Fick came out with everything.

[11:07] But when I look at it from a 360 view or I really come out and look, I'm actually very

[11:12] excited about where they're going.

[11:14] Just because it's like you said, if the bar is low and I did enjoy hot wheels, I didn't

[11:18] so much enjoy October Fest or Houdini.

[11:21] But I feel like if they can get the right players put in place and they have the right

[11:25] goals in mind.

[11:27] It's, I mean, it's exciting to see where they're going.

[11:29] The question is, will they be able to deliver on this because we've seen it time and time

[11:32] again to where different companies will be very boastful about their intentions, but

[11:37] you know, boasting about intentions and actually following through on that, there are two

[11:41] different things.

[11:42] Absolutely.

[11:43] And I agree.

[11:44] I mean, I want this company to be successful.

[11:47] Because I think people listen to me ragging on those first few games and I think most people

[11:53] while they don't vocalize how they feel about those games, the proof is in the pudding.

[11:57] These games haven't sold.

[11:58] Like all three of them haven't sold very well.

[12:01] So I'm really excited that they have new management because that's the only thing that

[12:05] could create change, right?

[12:07] At American Pimball is they switch up the formula, but I do disagree with this coming out

[12:13] so early and flexing.

[12:14] I mean, David was like going right after me.

[12:16] You heard what he said, right Travis?

[12:18] Oh, yeah.

[12:19] Oh, yeah.

[12:20] He was coming hard in the paint.

[12:22] So why do you think he did that?

[12:24] Why do you think he made comments that a podcast or who's only been around for five years,

[12:29] you can't take him seriously because he wasn't buying games in the early 2000s for like

[12:33] a few hundred bucks?

[12:34] You know, honestly, I'm not really sure.

[12:36] I've tried to look at it from every perspective.

[12:39] And you know, from my point of view, if I was in charge of any company, especially when

[12:43] it came from a marketing standpoint or just trying to get the information out from a social

[12:48] media standpoint, the last thing that I really want to do is put out anything that could

[12:52] be construed as negative towards anybody that's in the hobby, especially anybody in the hobby

[12:58] that actually has any type of influence on an audience.

[13:02] And so it just, it seemed kind of odd to me just because this was basically American

[13:07] Pimball's semi coming out party that they were signaling a shift, like a pivot with their

[13:12] company.

[13:13] And that's what a lot of us were focused on.

[13:15] And then that focus kind of got taken off of that immediately.

[13:18] And the only people that those comments would really offend are essentially your core

[13:23] audience because there's a lot of new people in Pimball just within the past couple of years

[13:29] that even if they haven't been around since the 90s, they're still very much aware of

[13:34] the whole game.

[13:35] I mean, they have great collections or they do content creation or they read the forums.

[13:41] I mean, there's a lot of people that have gone deep into the hobby, especially this

[13:45] past year with all of us basically being stuck at home.

[13:48] So it really, to me, it didn't make any sense.

[13:50] I would have liked to see them more focused on, you know, what they're going to do to provide

[13:55] us better games, such as talking about the themes or the potential mix that they could

[13:59] do in the future.

[14:00] That's what I would have liked to see.

[14:02] But other than that, it just, I don't know, it just kind of seemed like they went out

[14:05] into left-filled and they needed to shift back again and really focus in on what they're

[14:09] trying to do.

[14:10] Yeah, in this current time.

[14:11] It was funny too in a little ironic and maybe a little, maybe hypocritical, but more ironic

[14:17] that they ragged on me, probably mad because I've ragged on their games, but then he went

[14:21] on to rag on, October Fest and Houdini and then went on to say they're still going to

[14:26] make it for you.

[14:27] I don't understand that approach.

[14:28] Like, yeah, we agree these games suck.

[14:30] We need to change stuff up.

[14:32] But if you still want it, we'll still make it.

[14:34] What he didn't say and I know this for a fact, the reason they'll still make it listener

[14:38] is they're stuck with all these parts they ordered because they were expecting to make

[14:41] 500 of each game and they did not reach that milestone.

[14:44] Alright, so American Pinball, we wish them luck.

[14:46] My final point on this is they have now raised expectations that this next game Travis,

[14:52] it better be good.

[14:53] After all of this talk, like they're flexing real early.

[14:56] Do you think it's going to be a licensed theme or not?

[14:58] It kind of has to be no with all this flexing?

[15:00] It 100% has to be.

[15:02] I mean, I know, I know that everybody is tired of quote unquote, dad rock.

[15:08] I know they are, but the fact is they sell regardless of what we all think they do move units.

[15:13] I honestly feel like what American pinball really needs to focus on is finding a dad rock

[15:18] theme that hasn't been done yet.

[15:20] It's something out that is going to sell consistently and then you can start getting momentum

[15:25] in the right direction.

[15:26] You don't have to necessarily come out of the gate and hit an absolute home run.

[15:29] You know, you don't have to have something like spooky involved where you have a Rick

[15:32] and Morty that just sells out instantly.

[15:34] All that would be great.

[15:35] You just need momentum going in the right direction.

[15:38] And I honestly feel like that's the safest themes in which you could get your company going

[15:43] in the right direction this day and age.

[15:45] What dad rock would you recommend?

[15:46] If you could give them one that hasn't been done yet, which one would you recommend?

[15:51] Probably rush off the top of my head.

[15:53] That would be rush.

[15:54] Okay.

[15:55] That's not because of pin side either.

[15:56] I honestly think that that would make for a good pin.

[15:58] And if they want it to actually upgrade a little bit and try for something that would be

[16:02] a little bit more modern, maybe a daft punk or somebody like that because that music does

[16:06] work very well in a pinball machine.

[16:08] The two I would recommend would be Red Hot Chili Peppers and Motley Crew.

[16:14] Yep.

[16:15] Those two absolutely two.

[16:16] For sure, I know for a fact if there was a Red Hot Chili Peppers, I'd be all in just

[16:20] because my wife is a huge fan.

[16:22] Yeah, mine too.

[16:23] Brenda's like that's her favorite band.

[16:25] Like something about I think all these women are really attracted to the lead singer or something,

[16:29] but she's all about them.

[16:31] All right, well, we'll see what happens, but I do think if it's unlicensed and they

[16:34] said they were going to do a mixture of both, which is stupid.

[16:37] Like, I know David Fix listens to this show, David, stupid.

[16:41] If you do that, you're going to have hits and misses and you can't afford to have misses.

[16:45] But he also said he wants two games out a year.

[16:47] You think they can get there?

[16:48] I think that they can.

[16:50] If they're super focused on what they do because one of the things that they have done

[16:53] well is that anytime they have released a machine, those machines have gone out, customers.

[16:58] But we don't know, this is how can they handle large volumes of cell?

[17:01] That's what we don't know.

[17:02] And I'm sure they're probably set up to handle that, especially if they have a lot of parts

[17:06] laying around.

[17:07] Yeah, I mean, look, they build stuff well, Amtron and AP, manufacturing has never been

[17:12] a problem for them.

[17:13] In fact, they build some of the nicest games and I agree.

[17:15] Like, let's see if they can get the volume up.

[17:17] And I do want them to be successful in 2021.

[17:20] Just David, you need to check yourself when you come in hard at Canadian Meg.

[17:23] Because as I said, like, he's got everything to lose.

[17:26] I got nothing to lose, man.

[17:27] This isn't my job, but that's your job.

[17:29] So we hope they deliver.

[17:30] So let's go next to, because we were talking about dad rock, let's go to Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[17:35] Guns in Rose's Travis, did you think it would be as successful and people's responses have

[17:40] been very positive about the gameplay?

[17:42] And you shared your thoughts on the game and I think you gave a very balanced review.

[17:45] What are your thoughts now on GNR as you see more and more people unboxing them?

[17:50] You know, I think it was the right theme, the right pen at the exact right time for what

[17:55] Jersey Jack wanted to do.

[17:56] And I know you and I, we were talking about this way before it was actually released.

[18:00] You were adamant that, hey, this is going to sell out.

[18:03] This is going to be huge.

[18:04] And I was kind of on the fence whether or not it would be, but the more and more we talked

[18:08] about it and the more you let me know what this theme actually means to people and the

[18:12] potential of it, I got more and more convinced that it's highly likely that this could really

[18:18] do, you know, some awesome cells.

[18:19] What I didn't know was, is whether or not they were actually going to sell out of 500

[18:24] collectors editions day one.

[18:25] Actually did shock me, but they've absolutely crushed it.

[18:29] I mean, even after playing in person, yes, I found some things wrong with it, but what

[18:33] pinball machine doesn't have with it.

[18:35] The one thing that most people need to understand when you play this machine, you're going to

[18:39] have fun.

[18:40] That's the bottom line.

[18:41] And, you know, no matter what you're looking for out of pinball, if your priority number

[18:45] one isn't fun, then I don't know what you're doing with yourself.

[18:48] But this is a fun game.

[18:50] It absolutely is.

[18:51] And any accolades it gets is well deserved.

[18:54] And the other reason I was hyping it and telling you for six months, it's going to sell

[18:58] out.

[18:59] I had the damn images of the game in my phone.

[19:01] So I knew what nobody else knew.

[19:03] Yeah, if I had Led Zeppelin in my phone for six months, I would not be telling you Travis,

[19:09] just wait to see Led Zeppelin.

[19:10] No, I would have been like, oh man, like we'll talk about Led Zeppelin later.

[19:14] But yeah, I think you're right.

[19:15] I think it was the right pin at the right time.

[19:16] I think if you're over at Jersey Jack pinball, I heard a rumor that Eric's next game might

[19:20] even be a music pin.

[19:21] What do you think?

[19:22] After seeing this success, having slash over there that could help you line up other musicians,

[19:27] it would make kind of sense for Jersey Jack to go back to this well.

[19:31] What do you think?

[19:32] I mean, why not?

[19:33] If you found your niche within a niche, you might as well.

[19:35] I mean, if it's moving units and it's producing profit, you've got to stay on that train

[19:40] and keep going.

[19:41] And I think that there's a lot of pinball fans out there that I've talked to.

[19:44] A lot of them would not mind at all if they could get a hold of license that have already

[19:49] been done.

[19:50] And ACDC is a band that I've had multiple people mention to me that they wish would get

[19:55] the Jersey Jack treatment.

[19:57] Now whether that's the smartest thing for them to do, who knows?

[20:00] Maybe they're better off just going and finding bands that haven't been done before.

[20:03] But I think that that is absolutely the smartest thing to do because they've shown that they

[20:07] can do something great for it.

[20:09] And slash, obviously, he's a huge figure in the music industry.

[20:13] And if he can help them land certain people and if he can help them get that access, that's

[20:18] huge.

[20:19] And that is huge overall for Jersey Jack.

[20:22] And there'll be a huge player for years to come if that does happen.

[20:25] Absolutely.

[20:26] And I also, and you can see it in the threads, people want Jersey Jack to make any dream

[20:30] theme.

[20:31] And imagine this, listener of the show, how excited would you be if Jersey Jack remade

[20:37] the following two titles, Ghostbusters and Star Wars?

[20:41] Two games, arguably two of the biggest themes out there, Travis, that the stern versions

[20:46] of the games just, eh, eh, you know?

[20:48] I don't, do you like Star Wars?

[20:50] I didn't even ask you if you liked it or not.

[20:52] You know, I enjoy it, but it wasn't a, it's literally my dream theme, but the way that

[20:57] the game was with whether it was layout or whether it was code, it ended up not being a bolt

[21:02] to the ground theme for me.

[21:03] But I did have it for a couple of years.

[21:05] I know that pin inside and out and I enjoyed it for what it was, but I do recognize that

[21:09] it could be something so much more.

[21:11] The problem is, and we'll get to this when we talk about Stern.

[21:14] The problem is, is that Jersey Jack and Stern, the way that they produce their machines

[21:19] and their goals as companies, are obviously two different things.

[21:23] It's two entirely different ways.

[21:24] So I think we're always going to get two differently produced games.

[21:28] Absolutely.

[21:29] That being said, I do, I mean, I would love to be able to spend five to $9,000 on a game

[21:35] and that game is packed in as if it's a 12 or $15,000 game.

[21:39] But I do recognize that there's a lot of constraints to that in general.

[21:44] No, Travis, they're lying to us.

[21:46] These games are so cheap for Stern to make.

[21:49] The fact that a Stern is nine grand is crazy.

[21:52] I agree, but, but we'll get to this on the Stern thing.

[21:56] I think this is a good debate.

[21:57] Yeah, we'll get there.

[21:58] Let's, um, let's close the loop on JJP.

[22:01] Toy Story is next, right?

[22:03] When do you think they're going to reveal Toy Story knowing that GNR has sold so many?

[22:07] Obviously, they can't make as many games a week as Stern.

[22:10] When do you think they reveal this game?

[22:12] I was thinking it would be some time in March or TPS time frame, even though TPS isn't happening

[22:17] this year, but after seeing this March or next March, I was thinking this March, you know,

[22:21] the way that they were talking, it is as if, you know, with guns and roses coming out,

[22:25] they were ready to get their line moving.

[22:27] The problem is is that this, even though guns and roses has come out soon, you know,

[22:32] earlier than any other game that they've done,

[22:34] fact is, is that it's not really coming out at a high volume just because people are just

[22:38] now getting their C.E.

[22:40] So I could see something coming in the fall, maybe late summer, sometime around there.

[22:44] That would be my guess.

[22:45] You, you originally thought March, but obviously they've got to make all these GNRs.

[22:49] They don't have multiple lines going.

[22:52] We know that right now they're building the C.E.s and only building the C.E.s,

[22:56] which is also kind of crazy, right, that all of your Ellie customers are now waiting.

[23:01] Jersey Jax got to get their line up.

[23:03] What do you, I mean, this is their final, they, they moved to this bigger factory.

[23:06] This is their final problem.

[23:07] This is their final quagmire.

[23:09] It's like, it's not that people don't want their games.

[23:12] They just don't want to wait forever to get them.

[23:14] Yeah, I think it's so much more important for Jersey Jax just to learn how or not necessarily

[23:19] learn how, but to get to where they're operating at scale for their manufacturing.

[23:22] I think that's priority at this point way before announcing any of, you know, any other

[23:27] game that could be coming out.

[23:28] Yeah.

[23:29] And Toy Story has been worked on now for three plus years.

[23:32] So when it does come out, it's going to be not only done, but it's going to be like

[23:36] worked on, polished.

[23:38] Do you think Pat Lawler has looked at the guns and roses success and he's going to

[23:42] up the ante?

[23:43] What do you think?

[23:44] I don't think they can go backwards at this point.

[23:46] I really don't.

[23:47] Now, obviously Toy Story, I don't expect it to be as jam packed with assets as guns and

[23:53] roses was.

[23:54] I don't know if any pin in the future could ever be like that.

[23:57] But at the same time, the bar has been raised for their company in general and they can't

[24:01] go back.

[24:02] It has to be, and I love this game.

[24:03] I love dialed in.

[24:05] Don't like the theme at all, but the way that it is, I love it.

[24:08] But they do have to raise their game up from that as well.

[24:12] I mean, because with pirates, and then, you know, I felt like there's a little bit of

[24:15] step back with Wonka, but then they just brushed it with guns and roses.

[24:19] And so the sky's a limit for them.

[24:21] The question is, is whether or not they're going to try to attempt to recapture the same

[24:25] magic pen to pen, especially when they're using a new designer or a different designer?

[24:30] You know, guns and roses, I think, showed everybody.

[24:32] This is what we want.

[24:33] You want the theme you love, but you want everything from that theme that you love and you

[24:38] don't want to compromise, especially at this price point for all these games.

[24:42] And I think you're right.

[24:43] And I think that bar and that level, everything's going to be measured against it now, no matter

[24:47] which companies, not just within Jersey Jack.

[24:49] And we heard when David Fix said, we are not going to make a game over at AP unless we

[24:53] get all of the assets from that theme.

[24:56] Kind of crazy, right?

[24:57] I hope they can achieve that.

[24:58] They've got Roger Sharp.

[24:59] But I would rather only have two to three new games a year, Travis, that have everything

[25:04] you want from that theme asset wise.

[25:06] And what we're getting now, which is this new Stern approach, let's segue to Stern,

[25:11] because I think they have sort of gone in the other direction.

[25:14] They're starting to go after these big themes and remove the expensive assets from the

[25:19] game.

[25:20] We saw it with Jurassic Park.

[25:22] We saw it with Avengers.

[25:23] What do you think Stern's direction is moving forward?

[25:26] That, I mean, you hit the nail in the head.

[25:28] That's what it seems like that they're doing that they're going for volume plays where

[25:31] they're releasing three cornerstones a year.

[25:34] They might have a couple of other one off pins, type pins like a primus or a heavy metal.

[25:39] But I can't as much as us as customers that we want more, I have a hard time arguing against

[25:45] it just because they're still selling out of pins.

[25:48] They're still moving pins and it gets the industry talking.

[25:51] And even if there's something like Led Zeppelin that becomes very divisive between everybody,

[25:57] there's still another theme or another pen coming within just a few months.

[26:02] I mean, it happens so fast.

[26:04] So I mean, I can see why they do this just from a volume play.

[26:08] And obviously if they're number one in the industry currently, it's working for them.

[26:12] But it's interesting to see two different, entirely different ways of going about it between

[26:17] them and Jersey Jack.

[26:19] And I think within the next two or three years, we'll get to see who's correct in this

[26:22] approach.

[26:23] That's what I'm excited to see just from standing back and looking at it as a whole.

[26:27] You know, when I try to think about a metaphor to describe what's going on, right?

[26:32] It's think about a restaurant.

[26:34] Imagine if you go into Stern's restaurant, they've got eight things on the menu, right?

[26:38] If you don't like the new menu item, which is Led Zeppelin, that's cool.

[26:42] I've got seven other menu items that you can choose from.

[26:45] You walk into Jersey Jack restaurant.

[26:47] I've got one menu item.

[26:49] And maybe we have a few, well, let's check in the back.

[26:51] We've got a few Willy Wonka collectors editions left and that's it.

[26:54] And that's all you get.

[26:55] And I think that's the big difference is Stern's still going to be able to appease most

[26:59] of their customers.

[27:00] And then the big part is that the distributors are Stern's customers, not the customers.

[27:04] Right.

[27:05] They're going to sell out anyway.

[27:06] Yeah, every single Ellie is sold out on day one because distributors have to place their

[27:12] orders and order every Ellie to get the number they want.

[27:16] So that means they're buying the good games and the bad games at the same volume pretty

[27:20] much.

[27:21] What do you think about Led Zeppelin?

[27:22] So you've had more time on the pro.

[27:23] I know you shared some thoughts on your show.

[27:24] So what are your thoughts?

[27:25] You've played it.

[27:26] Most people haven't really played it.

[27:27] And you have one too, right?

[27:28] Yes, I do have a Led Zeppelin pro.

[27:30] Okay.

[27:31] What are your thoughts?

[27:32] You know, I'm actually enjoying it.

[27:34] I'm not going to say here and, you know, blow smoke up everybody's ass and say it's the

[27:38] greatest pin of all time or it's not even Stern's best release, obviously, of the year.

[27:43] I would probably put it slightly behind Ninja Turtles way behind Avengers Infinity

[27:48] Quest, but overall for me, it's still fun.

[27:51] And I'm finding ways due to the code and due to the music that I am enjoying it.

[27:56] I know that the layout is pretty simple and I totally agree with that.

[28:00] And I get, you know, the thoughts of it being bare that people are saying that.

[28:03] And I think that's mainly due to the way, obviously, that the design is, but the design

[28:08] for the pro is the way it is due to two things.

[28:11] One that side ramp is gone because of bomb, which absolutely sucks.

[28:14] I think without that side ramp, it really does nearly brick out the game to where you

[28:19] lose a lot of flow from a crucial shot.

[28:22] But two, it's obvious that the layout is the way it is because of that spinner mech, which

[28:26] is built into, you know, the premium and the LE.

[28:29] And you can just tell that the way that this is set up, everything was practically designed

[28:33] around this.

[28:34] And so that is kind of disappointing.

[28:36] But I mean, overall for me, it's a fun pin.

[28:39] I'm not going to say it's anything more than slightly above average, though.

[28:43] Yeah.

[28:44] So it's kind of hard.

[28:45] It's hard to really judge it because there is some things that I absolutely hate.

[28:49] I don't like the upper flipper at all with the way that it works.

[28:52] It's the way that the design is that upper flippers way up top.

[28:56] So if you hit a clean left orbit shot, you have to be ready.

[29:00] It's coming around there so fast.

[29:01] I may be complete that shot.

[29:03] I'll 5% of the time if I'm lucky.

[29:05] And I'm usually a fairly accurate shot.

[29:07] Yeah.

[29:08] And so that's just, I mean, and that's a design thing.

[29:11] And it is what it is.

[29:12] And I hate saying that about a pen, but overall, there are a lot of other fun elements to

[29:16] it.

[29:17] That's, I mean, that's basically the review and a nutshell.

[29:20] It's fun, but your mileage is going to very much vary upon what your priority out of a pin

[29:25] ball machine is.

[29:26] Yeah.

[29:27] Do you ever think that some of these games, and I think with Zeppelin, we see it on the

[29:30] pro and guns and roses on the SE, you just lose so much going from the fully featured

[29:37] game that the designer wanted when they yank out those elements like the upper playfield

[29:41] in GNR, you know, you've got the center mech in like Zeppelin, got the side ramp.

[29:47] Why make the pro version?

[29:49] And why not just like, are you even going to sell that many?

[29:51] I mean, that's probably because you just throw this in a bar.

[29:54] K, but do you think there was even a reason to make GNR SE?

[29:57] You know, I don't think that there was personally for that.

[30:01] And I think the fact that they, Jersey Jack isn't even selling them right now.

[30:05] I think that kind of shows that most people want the LEDs and want to see ease anyways.

[30:10] But at the same time, I think that's what I'm going to do.

[30:11] I think there's situations unique just because it was such a dynamite package overall that

[30:17] you wanted that.

[30:18] I mean, it was clear that that was so much better than what their SE version was.

[30:23] Whereas with the Stern, you know, I got to admit, because I do have a few LEDs, I had

[30:27] a couple of premiums before and I had a few pros.

[30:30] There are some pins to where the pro is legitimately the better version compared to the premium

[30:36] and LE.

[30:37] I mean, Ninja Turtles is a prime example of that.

[30:39] I have the LE, but that glider has broken down on me twice already, where I've had to

[30:43] get it replaced.

[30:44] And I've played the pro also, and I prefer the gameplay of the pro.

[30:48] It just, it plays so much smoother than what the LE does.

[30:51] And so that's where you kind of get, you know, just different ideas, different versions

[30:55] of these games.

[30:56] And it's sometimes it doesn't match up with what your expectations would be, even if

[31:00] it does cost more money.

[31:02] I mean, that's just kind of the way that the game pinball goes.

[31:04] Yeah.

[31:05] The game of Thrones is better in pro format, same with Black Knight, I hear too.

[31:09] You know, usually Richie, they say he makes the pro first and then adds on stuff, but this

[31:15] one seems like the reverse.

[31:16] I think the full featured version is the way to go.

[31:19] So Stern, what do you think is next?

[31:20] There's the rumor of Godzilla.

[31:22] Do you think that's next?

[31:24] And do you think they have Harry Potter?

[31:26] Let's start with those two questions.

[31:28] So with Godzilla, obviously, it's pretty much being confirmed via Dwight on Pinside.

[31:33] And you know, I would hope it's next, but just because I would think that they're trying

[31:37] to time it up with the release of Kong versus Godzilla or Godzilla versus Kong, you know,

[31:41] in terms of Harry Potter, you know, I really don't know.

[31:44] I've heard the same rumors that you've heard, you know, that this is possible of it coming

[31:49] out, but of course, as soon as it gets put out there, other people are, you know, kind

[31:52] of putting some water on that fire, but I would be curious to see if they do have Harry

[31:57] Potter.

[31:58] I would have to assume that that would be a super elite, though.

[32:01] I don't see how you can do that theme with the pro premium and Ellie.

[32:04] I think you would have to just go completely all out or theme like, yeah, here's the thing.

[32:09] So first I think Godzilla is coming.

[32:11] It is confirmed.

[32:12] I do think Godzilla is going to be Keith Ellwyn with zombie Eddie.

[32:16] And I think it's going to be like one of Stern's best selling games this year.

[32:19] And I think it's going to blow people away with Harry Potter, though, right?

[32:22] Stern's got to look at this license and be and say, this could be one of our best selling

[32:27] pins of all time.

[32:28] Yes, while it needs to be packed, right?

[32:30] It's Harry Potter.

[32:31] How do they not try to also just sell it to the masses, though, at a decent price where

[32:36] the volume lies?

[32:37] So I don't know what's happening because I leaked a rumor that isn't true that Brian

[32:42] Eddie is doing it.

[32:43] Joe Kamakau came out and said, it's not Brian Eddie, but he didn't say they didn't have

[32:47] the license.

[32:48] So do you think George Gomez would be the one designing this game, Travis?

[32:52] It possibly could be.

[32:53] I mean, he's been setting on the sidelines design wise for a while.

[32:57] His last name was what?

[32:58] Deadpool.

[32:59] Yeah, which was about two and a half years ago now, maybe.

[33:04] And so I mean, I could see something like that.

[33:06] The only reason why I think that Harry Potter would need the super Ellie treatment is just

[33:10] because of the amount of pins and amount of themes that they put out anyway.

[33:14] And I think Guns and Roses, I know a lot of people hated that I made a statement before,

[33:18] but Guns and Roses proved or Jersey Jack proved that people are willing to pay above $10,000

[33:24] or a theme that they really like for a game that is really well put together.

[33:28] OK.

[33:29] So maybe for certain themes with Stern, there's a new price point to where it might not be

[33:34] that $15,000 price point, but it could be that $12,000 price point.

[33:39] How many Harry Potter's would you make for an S.O.L.E. format and how much would you price

[33:43] it at if you're Stern?

[33:44] I would still do.

[33:45] If it was a Harry Potter, I would probably still do 500.

[33:50] And I would probably price it $12,000, knowing that I might be leaving money on the table,

[33:55] because I could see a pin selling out very fast.

[33:58] But that's it.

[33:59] Just 500.

[34:00] They could sell 5,000 Harry Potter's.

[34:02] They could, but that's just where you do the $10,000 version for 5,000 units.

[34:07] See, this is why I just think they're going to, what they're, I think what they're going

[34:09] to do is they're going to put it as like their normal price range.

[34:13] I do.

[34:14] I think you're going to see a pro.

[34:15] I think you're going to see a premium.

[34:17] I think you're going to see an L.E.

[34:18] Now they might do an S.O.L.E. on top of that for whatever.

[34:22] I mean, they could put a single piece of Harry's like wand in there and charge another 10

[34:27] grand, and people would buy it.

[34:29] It's Harry Potter.

[34:30] Like, I don't, you know, Stern's shown us that they don't have to do very much.

[34:32] They can just do a tiny little thing that's different and makes it unique, and people will

[34:38] spend a fortune on it.

[34:39] I'm worried about this game.

[34:40] I won't lie.

[34:41] If they do have the Harry Potter license, I think Stern Pimball is probably the last company

[34:46] people want to see with a dream theme like this.

[34:50] If you're George Gomez and you're Gary Stern, do you think they even care that everyone's

[34:54] like, I don't want Stern to make dream themes?

[34:56] No.

[34:57] No, because they're selling out all their games.

[34:59] I agree.

[35:00] I mean, regardless of what we're all saying, the fact is what you look at, so let's just

[35:04] take last year, for instance, right?

[35:06] There's no shows that happen, so it's not like that they had any presence in front of

[35:09] the consumer.

[35:10] Yet, Turtle's L.E. sells out.

[35:13] The Avengers L.E. sells out, and from all indications, Led Zeppelin, L.E. sells out.

[35:18] We know why that is, because obviously they have their distribution units, but we can't

[35:24] really argue against that.

[35:26] Until the consumer decides to stop buying pens, until things happen, kind of like what happened

[35:31] with the WWE, where there's just a bunch still setting around.

[35:35] Even Guardians of the Galaxy, they didn't sell out of that, but then that machine just kept

[35:40] going.

[35:41] They went to the next game and the next game.

[35:42] That's really where they thrive.

[35:44] Is the fact that they do so much volume, even if they have a dud, they just go to the next

[35:48] one.

[35:49] There's another Keith L.E. when game waiting.

[35:52] In a few months, I mean, he is literally the MVP of that entire company.

[35:57] I don't know where they would be at without his designs coming out, because it's a near

[36:01] guarantee that anything that he touches, it will sell.

[36:05] That's, I mean, knowing that you have that in your stable, and you have that capability,

[36:09] that's great.

[36:10] Just with Jersey Jack, you got to look at it this way.

[36:13] Yes, guns and roses is excellent, it's great.

[36:16] But what if that would have been a dud?

[36:18] What if that would have been like a walker coming out, or pirates when it first came out?

[36:24] They had to stop doing pirates because it wasn't selling as many units.

[36:28] And that's the risk that happens when you don't come out with volume, and you release

[36:32] something that the consumer doesn't react positively to, then you're kind of screwed.

[36:36] Yeah, that current period of time, Stern doesn't operate like that and argue against it.

[36:41] It's more like option versus volume, and those two go together at Stern, which is why they

[36:45] just dominate.

[36:46] It's like, we can do volume, and we'll give you options, and if you don't like this,

[36:50] we'll give you this, and then we'll just vault something if it's, if it's, if all's failing,

[36:54] we'll just go back to the, to the hits.

[36:56] Absolutely.

[36:57] I mean, there's a reason why American pinball said that they want to follow a similar path

[37:01] that Stern's doing.

[37:02] There's a reason for that.

[37:03] It's because it's proven that it works.

[37:05] It absolutely works.

[37:06] It's also crazy to me that people don't follow Stern's model, even just the three tiered

[37:11] system of games.

[37:12] It's like whenever I see companies like American pinball, like we're going to do it, and then

[37:16] they're like, okay, we're going to make October fest.

[37:18] There's no Ellie.

[37:19] There's nothing to get collectors to feel like they're going to miss out.

[37:23] They go against the current of what works, and I look at those decisions, and they're

[37:27] boneheaded.

[37:28] And I know why they do it Travis, because they're like, well, we don't want to be like

[37:32] greedy, or we don't want to do this.

[37:34] We think pinball should be about democratizing pinball, and we're going to make it fun for

[37:37] all, and we're not going to appease the collectors.

[37:40] They're rich dudes who want the stupid stuff that you can charge double for, but that's

[37:44] what you need to do to stay in business.

[37:46] Now, let's say, well, I think we're not, are we don't want Stern?

[37:50] Well, yeah, let's let's segue.

[37:51] We talked about Harry Potter's or anything else.

[37:54] They've done a really good job of keeping a tight lid on leaks.

[38:00] Let's talk about this though.

[38:01] Do you think Steve Richie should retire?

[38:03] No, that's a loaded question.

[38:05] I'm not sure.

[38:06] I'm not sure.

[38:07] And the reason why I say that is just because, you know, Stern, they're working so much,

[38:12] you could tell they're getting a lot of new blood in, but I think somebody with Steve

[38:16] Richie's credentials, he would be great as a mentor to somebody there, and he could be

[38:21] doing that right now.

[38:22] And he is doing that.

[38:23] Yeah.

[38:24] But yeah.

[38:25] And so, I mean, in that way, no, I don't think he should retire as long as he's still

[38:29] around mentoring people and guiding people, guiding the next generation because he does

[38:35] have historically, he's done a great job.

[38:38] Yep.

[38:39] And it's hard to judge the layouts that he's putting out today because again, we don't

[38:43] know the true constraints that are happening at Stern.

[38:46] Now, when Keith L. Wynne puts out a game, obviously, it's like, okay, well, what constraints

[38:50] are there really?

[38:51] But again, it's two different ways of designing pens.

[38:55] And, you know, what I would like to see with him with Steve Richie because he does make

[38:59] incredibly flowing games is to be able to kind of mentor people and kind of go from project

[39:05] to project and give just his point of view on something.

[39:08] It doesn't mean that it necessarily has to be just that, but I think that he still has

[39:13] a lot of gas left in the tank to make some splashes for Stern and really help out from

[39:17] a mentoring perspective.

[39:19] I agree.

[39:20] I agree.

[39:21] I mean, I think his decades of pinball knowledge, you don't have to like retire from the game

[39:27] altogether.

[39:28] Because like the board of directors of design studios over at Stern, where he's overseeing

[39:32] everyone and helping them sort of, you know, improve what they're working on.

[39:36] But when it comes to being like the lead designer, do you think Stern needs to bring in some

[39:42] young blood?

[39:43] Yeah, I do, but at the same time, it's, you know, here's the tough part about it, Chris.

[39:48] I don't know exactly what the requirements are to be a pinball designer.

[39:53] That's the thing.

[39:54] People come from different backgrounds and it's not the easiest thing to do.

[39:57] I would imagine and you can kind of tell that when you see other designs from other companies

[40:02] to where it doesn't exactly have the flow that you expect or it just feels like a clunker.

[40:06] It's not very exciting.

[40:08] And to me, it's something that designing is an art form and it's something that you have

[40:13] to keep doing at a consistent basis to really cultivate that skill.

[40:17] And you have to really know the different parts of what Elwyn really exceeds that that

[40:22] a lot of people don't realize.

[40:24] He knows every single part that is going into that game.

[40:27] It's not so much just seeing the game.

[40:28] He actually knows the parts and something like that.

[40:31] It's, I mean, to me, that's a difficult skill to obtain.

[40:35] It's one thing to be a great pinball player or to even be a solid pinball player.

[40:39] It's a whole other thing to have the eye or design and actually know how to piece that

[40:43] and put that together in AutoCAD.

[40:45] I mean, it's an incredibly tough thing to do.

[40:47] Let's segue on this note of young designers to spooky pinball because spooky pinball

[40:52] is another company that's a player in the game and they've been successful growing that

[40:59] company slowly over time.

[41:01] Rick and Morty sold out in what, four hours, Scott Denise's sophomore title.

[41:07] What do you think is next over at American pinball and Scott Denise has the designer.

[41:12] I'm curious on your thoughts because I think he's, you know, how does he grow?

[41:16] What do you think you would like to see from Scott Denise in the future?

[41:19] You know, it's, so here's the thing with Rick and Morty.

[41:22] And I played it and I still have one on order right now.

[41:25] It's not exactly the most elaborate layout that there is.

[41:29] And obviously, TNA was a simplified layout that worked due to a lot of other factors dealing

[41:35] with that pin.

[41:36] And I think that's where Denise really shines.

[41:39] It's not necessarily layout design.

[41:41] I think it's how he puts the whole package together in terms of sound effects, overall

[41:45] music, overall light.

[41:47] So I think all that really comes together nicely.

[41:49] Now in terms of where spooky goes from here, you know, I'm not really sure.

[41:53] Even wise what they do just because it's obviously the, you know, the name of the company,

[41:58] it kind of pigeonholes them in to just doing horror themed pins, but they kind of got

[42:03] away from that a little bit with Rick and Morty.

[42:05] But I honestly, I don't know what themes are really out there to which they'll sell.

[42:11] I mean, maybe army of darkness, something like that.

[42:14] I don't know if you're familiar with that.

[42:15] I.e.

[42:16] P.

[42:17] No, I am.

[42:18] I mean, they got lightning in a bottle with Rick and Morty, right?

[42:22] And I'm sure Jody Dankberg and the people over at Stern and even the people at JJP were

[42:27] like, man, we kind of all slept on this theme.

[42:30] Do you think they must be kicking themselves a little bit?

[42:32] Don't you think?

[42:33] Absolutely.

[42:34] I mean, it's when the theme was first announced, I was also kind of like, I wonder if pinball

[42:38] people really respond to this because I was aware of the show.

[42:42] And I mean, I'm glad that they all responded well to it.

[42:45] And I'm still kind of wondering though, if they responded that well just to the theme

[42:51] or if spooky got the payoff from being the company that they are and being consistent

[42:56] like they are just building up years and years of goodwill with their customer base,

[43:00] I'm to me, I personally think that that kind of played a part in how many Rick and Morty's

[43:05] really moved a one.

[43:06] And so I mean, that's a, yeah, it's a little bit bold.

[43:09] That's a great example right there.

[43:10] What happens when you have the good, yeah, when you have the goodwill, the customer, it

[43:13] will pay off.

[43:15] We're going to talk about goodwill.

[43:16] Goodwill agreements when we talk about deep rooted in a little bit, but absolutely, they

[43:21] earned it and they earned it over time and they earned it by never not delivering.

[43:26] And that's how you earn it.

[43:27] And not every spooky game has been perfect and they've always been a company that's been

[43:31] evolving in the right direction.

[43:33] And so I do think though Travis that they are sort of in a tough spot because as we

[43:38] talked about GNR being the new bar over at JJP, this game, you know, if you're spooky,

[43:44] you just never want to go backwards as a company.

[43:46] You want to continue the momentum of each game's success.

[43:50] So that's the challenge now for them is how do they make a theme that's going to be

[43:54] at that level?

[43:55] Like do you think future Rama is at that level of Rick and Morty?

[43:59] I don't think so.

[44:00] I don't think it's at the same level, but it can still move some units.

[44:03] The problem that spooky has is that it, if it takes a year to a year and a half, like

[44:08] 12 to 18 months to get their product fully out, the whole industry as a whole has already

[44:14] just changed.

[44:16] They worry it moves at such velocity that I mean, consider this.

[44:21] Rick and Morty was announced, December of 2019, right?

[44:24] We're nearly in February of 2021 and we're still in the middle of trying to move those

[44:29] units.

[44:30] And meanwhile, Guns and Roses, Avengers have already come out, have changed.

[44:34] Guns and Roses has changed the way pinball is going to be for Jersey Jack moving forward.

[44:38] And so that's the only hang up with spooky is that it does take so long to get these games

[44:43] out.

[44:44] And let's face facts, 750 pins.

[44:46] It's not like that's a huge number.

[44:48] I mean, that's huge for what spooky's capability is.

[44:50] But that's my concern is that what game do they announce next?

[44:54] And if they announce it this summer, let's say that it does sell.

[44:58] It does sell really well.

[44:59] Then is that going to be the only pin that they're able to put out until 2023?

[45:03] I mean, a concern all these other companies are going at such fast velocity.

[45:07] I mean, it's hard to compete when you're doing something like that.

[45:10] It is crazy.

[45:11] And I do wonder why spooky and Chicago gaming company don't just unite.

[45:16] Right?

[45:17] Right?

[45:18] Why don't they just unite?

[45:19] I mean, you've got CGC's not making stuff right now.

[45:20] Right?

[45:21] You've got spooky needing to make games.

[45:22] They're, aren't they near each other?

[45:24] And I think they're within like driving distance.

[45:27] Yeah, at least a phone call away.

[45:28] I mean, you would think that something like that would work out.

[45:31] But obviously, I have to assume that there's, if there's been conversations, I have to assume

[45:35] that they've already happened and both parties have already decided it wouldn't work out.

[45:39] Yeah.

[45:40] I don't know that for a fact.

[45:41] I'm just making an assumption if it hasn't happened already because if you're in

[45:44] spooky's, if you're in spooky's corner, you really want to get these rick and mortis

[45:48] out as fast as possible.

[45:49] I mean, you've already put a bunch out in the wild.

[45:51] You've already made the adjustments that you needed to adjust from what the consumer said

[45:55] because I know you pretty much spearheaded a lot of that early on and it helped make certain

[46:00] adjustments.

[46:01] Yeah, but isn't Canadian just really toxic and he never does anything good for the pinball

[46:05] community?

[46:06] You got to admit, you do wrestle people's jimmy sometimes, but I find entertaining either

[46:10] way.

[46:11] No, I agree.

[46:12] Like, they got to get volume up and Chuck has never wanted to grow too big, right?

[46:16] Because he said it, I don't want to lay people off if we have a dud.

[46:19] You know, and they have to get every game right because they can't have a misstep with all

[46:23] the people in the mouths.

[46:25] He has to feed.

[46:26] So we'll see what happens.

[46:27] But again, you're right.

[46:28] We're not going to see another spooky game for probably six months, if not later, just

[46:33] to they have to get all these games out.

[46:35] Who's next?

[46:36] Like Chicago gaming company, there's really nothing to talk about.

[46:39] It's cactus canyon.

[46:40] It's forever delayed, but it's not delayed because there's no release date.

[46:44] What are your thoughts on CGC and the pace at which they're moving?

[46:47] You know, I'm curious to see because I keep hearing that they, you know, they have either

[46:52] what is an original IP from Benheck possibly or does he have an actual accent?

[46:58] They've been hex making a license theme.

[47:01] That's not a remake.

[47:02] And Mark Richie's also working on cough cough pulp fiction forever right here.

[47:08] Right.

[47:09] Right.

[47:10] And I mean, if that's the pin that he happens to have if Richie has a, I would like to

[47:12] see that come out as soon as possible just because you get the ball rolling for them

[47:17] up there.

[47:18] If that's the direction they're going to go.

[47:19] But yeah, I mean, it just the silence, the radio silence on that end, it's understandable

[47:23] because this goes with, you know, what we were talking about.

[47:26] If you don't have anything to put out, there's no need to boast about it.

[47:28] Yep.

[47:29] And at the same time, I'm kind of wondering because there's, you know, three different

[47:33] pins that's rumored to become an outform and I'm kind of wondering what is it going to

[47:37] be and when's it going to be here?

[47:38] I mean, there's just, there's no telling at this point from my end.

[47:41] I know.

[47:42] And also Dennis Nordman said he's designed a couple games for CGC as well.

[47:46] So it's like, they've got all these games designed.

[47:50] They just need to make a now Churchill doesn't make this the focus of their business and

[47:53] they make so much money Churchill cabinets.

[47:56] The Pimble Division is just like lunch money for them.

[47:59] I hope it's a cactus canyon, though.

[48:01] Whatever it is.

[48:02] It does come out.

[48:03] I do kind of hope it's cactus canyon that comes out next.

[48:05] It is.

[48:06] This is what I like to see.

[48:07] It is.

[48:08] Let's see if my fact checkers say otherwise, but it is.

[48:10] Okay.

[48:11] Let's talk about deep roots.

[48:13] So obviously we've seen a lot of movement from deep root this holiday season.

[48:17] They took non-refundable deposits and what do you think about after all of these years

[48:22] Travis, after all of this J-pop hype, just 130 people had the guts to go in.

[48:29] We're going in on Raza.

[48:30] I mean, it did exactly what we thought it would do a couple of years ago.

[48:34] That's just the way that it is.

[48:36] They're leading off with even though it is a pin that kind of is in, I don't know,

[48:42] online community lore where we all know about it, but people that are outside of the online

[48:47] community, there's not too many people that obviously know about it.

[48:50] It doesn't move the needle for anybody and that was my main concern with deep root putting

[48:54] this out first that it's not something that would really build momentum for your company

[48:58] and it just kind of seems like they're slogging through this at this point in time.

[49:02] It's just, I don't want to call it a mess, but it just seems like from the outside looking

[49:06] in, I feel like that this is just a huge monkey that they want to get off their back and

[49:12] they just want to move on to the next game at this point, especially when it's with all

[49:17] the history behind this.

[49:18] I just don't see why you want to stick around with this pin anymore.

[49:20] Let me ask you a question.

[49:21] If they didn't do non-refundable deposits, do you think they have many more orders for

[49:26] this game?

[49:27] It's possible.

[49:28] I think that a lot of people didn't order upfront just because they were a little bit

[49:32] gun shy.

[49:34] I think it's also a lot of people haven't truly seen this pin.

[49:38] It's only been at, I think, just maybe one or two shows.

[49:41] I know I played it down at Houston Expo back in 2019 when it was a prototype, but I think

[49:47] it just, what worries a lot of people is just history-wise when there's these companies

[49:51] that come out that seem like they're almost overnight companies out of nowhere that once

[49:56] you put down money for a pin, it does make people antsy.

[50:00] I think that a lot of people are on to that.

[50:03] It is nice that at least for a period of time, it didn't seem like Deeproot was going after

[50:09] that, but the fact that they decided to take free order money without, and now it's clear

[50:13] that they didn't even have the vendor set up fully.

[50:16] Yeah, let's talk about that.

[50:17] I've never seen that happen in the history of Pimball before.

[50:23] With all the hyperbole and all of the flexing this company's been doing over the years

[50:27] about how they were going to ship more games in one year than every manufacturer combined,

[50:33] they released one game, well they didn't release it, you can order one game and the vendors

[50:38] aren't lined up.

[50:40] That's a terrifying bit of information, no?

[50:42] Yeah, well, so a little bit of my background, I know a lot of people in the manufacturing

[50:47] industry and I have a few friends that have been in it for over a decade, and that's

[50:51] kind of where my background is with online sales and everything and product development.

[50:55] I talk to them directly, asking them, is this normal?

[50:59] Because I don't know too much on that side, and they all let me know that this isn't normal,

[51:05] that we have our vendors 100% down.

[51:08] That's one of the main priorities whenever you're doing this.

[51:12] Out of that email that came out, that was the thing that really caught my attention.

[51:15] It wasn't the beginning of it when he was talking about misinformation and all this

[51:20] and that.

[51:21] It was that little nugget that was put in there.

[51:23] It is.

[51:24] It's a major red flag to me if I have my money put down and the vendors aren't fully vouch

[51:30] for it.

[51:31] They're not even fully in place because that just means that you run an extreme risk of delays,

[51:37] of delays galore because you're going to have a certain pattern of all these vendors sending

[51:43] in something that is not exactly the perfect product.

[51:46] There's always going to be defects and you're trying to find what your tolerance is for

[51:49] those defects.

[51:50] Now, if you're trying to do that while meeting a deadline at the same time and that deadline

[51:55] isn't a year from now, it's legitimately just a couple of weeks from now, that is really

[52:00] extremely redlining that product.

[52:02] I don't know where they're going to go with that and hopefully they get it figured out.

[52:06] It's just that kind of floor right there that it didn't seem like that they had all their

[52:11] vendors put in place from the wording of the email.

[52:14] Is that the hints that you got from that Chris?

[52:16] That's what they said.

[52:17] It was literal.

[52:18] We don't have 30% of the bomb figured out yet in terms of the parts.

[52:24] And then when they talked about the pin bar, he wrote specifically how they don't have

[52:27] the vendor lined up or they found a vendor who they might be able to work on this thing

[52:32] and put it into their production schedule.

[52:34] But because it's such a low volume, it's harder and harder for them to lock up a vendor.

[52:40] But here's the terrifying part.

[52:41] I get that they need to find the vendor.

[52:43] That's not, to me, that's not the part that would worry me, even though that is very

[52:47] worrisome.

[52:48] The part that terrifies me the most if I'm in on this is knowing they don't have the

[52:52] vendor yet, knowing they don't know when these parts are coming and knowing they don't have

[52:56] certification yet.

[52:57] He also talked about how they need to get the game certified.

[53:00] He then put out mid-march as when you can expect your game.

[53:03] Now, how does the deep root company draw the conclusion of mid-march when all of this

[53:08] other stuff is up in the air?

[53:10] Yeah, that's a big turnaround.

[53:12] And the thing that I have to assume is that all the vendors are probably based in America

[53:17] to even remotely be close that type of turnaround.

[53:20] And that's probably assuming that everything goes smooth.

[53:23] That the products that are coming in aren't defective.

[53:26] That the first machines that they put together, assuming that they do gather all the vendors,

[53:30] that they're not defective.

[53:31] I mean, and that's the one thing that a lot of people aren't really thinking about.

[53:35] That once these machines start getting produced, if they realize that something is wrong, then

[53:40] you gotta go back and fix it again.

[53:43] And that's very difficult to do, especially if you haven't manufactured anything yet.

[53:47] These of my stern can get away with the adjustments, is because they are great at manufacturing.

[53:51] They can pivot very fast, just within a couple of days.

[53:55] Whereas if you have a company that's never done this before, that even struggles together

[53:59] up the vendors, it's, I mean, that is.

[54:01] That's the scary thought.

[54:03] And I hope that they can do it, but I almost feel like knowing what I know from the manufacturing

[54:08] perspective, just from talking with all my friends about it, that have been in it for

[54:12] over a decade.

[54:13] I feel like March is a very, very, I won't say it's impossible.

[54:17] I just feel like it's a very aggressive date.

[54:21] And I hope that they make it.

[54:22] I mean, it's again, it's kind of self-imposed at the same time, even with people already

[54:26] in.

[54:27] But I mean, I guess I can understand that they're trying to make sure that everybody that's

[54:32] still in, that the nerves are calm, that people are trying to build that trust up.

[54:36] But again, that's just what, or five weeks from now, four or six weeks from now, we'll

[54:41] be able to say it.

[54:42] I'll say it if you won't.

[54:43] It's impossible.

[54:44] It's impossible.

[54:45] I will say this right now on the air.

[54:47] If anyone gets their Raza in mid March, if they start shipping Raza's in mid March, and

[54:52] I mean, like it's being produced, let's figure out something for Canada to do.

[54:56] I will give $1,000.

[55:00] Okay, Brenda's going to kill me.

[55:03] I will donate $1,000 to a Pimbal charity if I'll donate it to the Pimbal Hall of Fame.

[55:10] How about that?

[55:11] They need some money, right?

[55:12] They need to get up and run it.

[55:13] I will donate $1,000 to the Pimbal Hall of Fame in mid March if Raza's are shipping.

[55:18] There you go.

[55:19] You guys.

[55:20] Because I've been betting some of these Raza owners, Travis, you're not going to see your

[55:23] game for six months.

[55:24] I don't think you're going to see it before July.

[55:26] I don't, I don't.

[55:27] It's, I mean, even with just a little over a hundred, it's again, it's going to be very

[55:32] tough to do because the fact is they have to make a few machines anyways and then have

[55:38] everybody look over it and make sure that it's to their quality that they expected.

[55:43] They can't just all the sudden fire up the line and just start throwing everything out

[55:47] there.

[55:48] They have to see a product from start to finish and have everybody look over and say,

[55:52] okay, is this the way that we need it done?

[55:54] Is this the proper way?

[55:55] And that could take time also.

[55:57] That may not happen within just a day.

[56:00] It's a very difficult process.

[56:01] It's not easy at all.

[56:03] And anybody that's watching this, that's where you should have so much more respect for

[56:06] what Jersey Jack is doing or what Stern's doing or what Spooky's doing or what American

[56:11] pinball's done to actually manufacture these games and get them out to the public.

[56:16] Absolutely.

[56:17] And look, they're not making pizza pies here.

[56:19] They're making highly complex mechanical devices.

[56:21] And it just, you know, you have to go back and look at the entire story of Deeproot.

[56:26] And I do hope they figure it out.

[56:28] But they did show a lack of respect to all these other companies that you just mentioned

[56:32] when they said they'd be able not only to do what they did.

[56:36] They're going to trump all of them.

[56:37] And here we are, 2021.

[56:40] And all we want are the games.

[56:41] I keep telling this, you know, when I used to talk to Robert when he would still talk to

[56:44] me, people just want the games to just get the game out like all this other stuff.

[56:49] We don't need boxes.

[56:50] We don't need levelers.

[56:51] We don't need all this stuff surrounding.

[56:54] What is he called?

[56:55] The total pinball ownership experience.

[56:57] Well, let me tell you, that doesn't happen unless you have a pinball machine.

[57:01] That's the beginning of it all.

[57:02] That's a key element to it.

[57:03] Yeah.

[57:04] We got the box.

[57:05] We got, well, where's the pinball machine?

[57:07] Well, that's where we have to figure it out that part yet.

[57:10] And that's so Jay Pop, though.

[57:11] This is the part that other people forget.

[57:13] Here's the thing Travis, this game since that we've seen it in December.

[57:17] Where's John Poppiduke?

[57:19] Where is he?

[57:20] We haven't seen him interviewed once.

[57:22] We haven't seen him talk about Raza.

[57:24] We've never seen him.

[57:25] He's in none of the Deeproot videos.

[57:27] Why do you think they're keeping him so behind the scenes here?

[57:31] You know, I'm not sure.

[57:32] They obviously, when there was the debacle of first showing Raza,

[57:36] just I think it was back in September when they had the deep six or the deep five,

[57:41] whoever went down there to look at it, they kind of seemed to pivot towards

[57:44] putting Bound in front and center as not necessarily a spokesperson,

[57:48] but he was definitely front and center ahead of Robert in terms of trying to show off

[57:52] of Raza trying to do, I mean, he's done some media stuff since then.

[57:56] And I don't know.

[57:57] It's just, it kind of seems like that they've sideline Jay Poppiduke.

[58:00] Is what it, I mean, not just seems like that's what it is.

[58:02] And the only conclusion that I can really come to is just, to me,

[58:06] I think internally they kind of know what they have on their hands with Raza.

[58:10] If I'm them, I just want to get this game out.

[58:13] And I want to get to the games that I've talked about that I have.

[58:17] Saying the problem is, can they actually do that?

[58:19] That's the part.

[58:20] They can't get the first game out.

[58:21] So I don't know if you can't get the first game out,

[58:23] how do you get the second, third, fourth,

[58:25] all the way up to the 18th game out?

[58:26] That makes it really difficult to do.

[58:28] And here's the crazy part with all this focus always being on Raza,

[58:32] because I know Robert just wants to get it out too,

[58:34] because I hear from people who saw it.

[58:36] And I'm not saying this as a joke.

[58:38] That food truck and Barrio's game is incredible.

[58:42] And it's got all that magic and world under glass

[58:44] that people have been hoping for.

[58:45] And you've got Barrio there, you've got John Norris.

[58:48] People forget, there's a huge team here.

[58:50] This isn't just a John Poppiduke sort of Zidware 2.0.

[58:53] No, this is a company with a lot of people that worked on a lot of games.

[58:58] And so if you don't get this Raza out,

[59:00] you're not going to see goonies.

[59:02] You're not going to see food truck.

[59:03] You're not going to see anything else in that lineup.

[59:05] Yeah, and I mean, the big thing with Deeproot,

[59:07] do we know who's the director of their operations

[59:10] or manufacturing there?

[59:11] Does anybody know that?

[59:12] No.

[59:13] And so my point being, and I'm not saying that they don't exist,

[59:16] but my point being is that above all else,

[59:19] right now that that would be the most priority position

[59:23] within that company.

[59:24] Somebody that knows manufacturing inside and out

[59:27] and tell Robert like it is and tell him,

[59:29] this is absolutely what we need.

[59:31] Because if all these great people are coming up with all these great ideas,

[59:35] if we can't make those ideas come to life,

[59:37] then it doesn't matter at that point.

[59:39] Right.

[59:40] You know, so to me, that's where the focus should really be.

[59:42] That's where the priority should be.

[59:44] Upon not worrying about N15 games,

[59:47] just worrying about getting somebody in there that knows manufacturing

[59:51] that's been in the business for years and years and can get them off the ground.

[59:55] And that's the key.

[59:56] And I think a lot of, I guess a lot of our drawbacks

[59:59] or a lot of our thoughts on this company would really be alleviated

[01:00:02] if, and I hope I'm pronouncing that right, Chris,

[01:00:04] because I know I pronounce my words wrong all the time,

[01:00:06] but I hope that that would calm everybody's nerves

[01:00:09] if Deeproot would just show who is directing the manufacturing.

[01:00:13] If they can come out with that and say,

[01:00:14] here's our leader, here he is, and he doesn't interview,

[01:00:17] or she doesn't interview, that would go a long ways

[01:00:20] that we know that they're serious about getting these games out.

[01:00:23] No, I agree.

[01:00:24] And that role is so important.

[01:00:26] The part that scares me is that that's the person who needs to tell you

[01:00:31] you can say mid-March or don't say mid-March,

[01:00:34] but they said mid-March.

[01:00:35] So we'll see what happens, I guess, come mid-March.

[01:00:39] Yep, we'll know, and then we might,

[01:00:41] we'll either all be celebrating or we'll be kicking the can down the road again.

[01:00:45] Travis, thank you so much.

[01:00:48] We're right at the hour point.

[01:00:49] You know, I try not to do super long shows for fans of Canatus Pimball Podcast.

[01:00:54] Where can they find your show, A Pimball Podcast?

[01:00:58] So you can find me on basically any pod catcher just looking up A Pimball Podcast

[01:01:02] or you can find me on YouTube at MarvLoco.

[01:01:05] Okay, and you also have a great streaming channel on YouTube.

[01:01:08] MarvLoco is the name.

[01:01:10] How often do you do shows?

[01:01:11] Because that's the other thing my fans are going to want to know

[01:01:13] because I'm almost too prolific on this damn podcast,

[01:01:16] but how many shows do you do a week?

[01:01:19] Oh gosh, I try to do at least one a week,

[01:01:21] and I try to put out a couple of videos a week.

[01:01:23] Now, it's, I mean, it comes and goes.

[01:01:25] I mean, the tough part is, and you know this,

[01:01:27] since you're going to have to take a break with a new child on the way,

[01:01:30] congratulations, by the way.

[01:01:31] Thank you.

[01:01:32] But I've got four little ones of my own,

[01:01:34] and it's just whenever they need to do something,

[01:01:36] it obviously takes priority.

[01:01:38] I mean, you're going to find that out very soon.

[01:01:41] But yeah, I tried to at least get out one show a week

[01:01:44] and a couple of videos a week is my overall goal.

[01:01:46] Awesome. Awesome.

[01:01:47] Yep. I mean, I'm going to find out we're excited and terrified at the same time.

[01:01:52] But it's, it is why I need a break because my focus in February

[01:01:57] and in the March will be the baby.

[01:01:59] So, Travis, you were on the drop down for the Twippies for podcast or streamer.

[01:02:04] I think for YouTube, for YouTube.

[01:02:07] Yeah. Okay.

[01:02:08] Well, congratulations on that because even though there's so many more streamers

[01:02:11] than podcasts, so just to be nominated in that category, it is a, is a feat.

[01:02:16] Yeah, definitely. I'm very appreciative of it.

[01:02:18] For sure. I mean, just any type of recognition from anybody,

[01:02:22] I mean, to me, even if somebody just takes a minute out of their day

[01:02:25] to even watch or listen, I appreciate it for sure.

[01:02:28] And listen, I think you're going to love this guy's material.

[01:02:31] And I've been listening to you since day one.

[01:02:33] And again, I think what I love about Travis's stuff is there's no agenda.

[01:02:37] There's no, I think you might be sponsored, but there's no like,

[01:02:41] but I'm free to say whatever I need to say.

[01:02:43] Exactly. Exactly. And how, and how, give you like a well thought out point of view.

[01:02:48] So it's, it's good. I love listening to you.

[01:02:50] I feel like I get a little bit smarter every time I check out your show.

[01:02:54] So I hope you guys give him a chance.

[01:02:56] And I think you'll, you'll really appreciate it.

[01:02:57] Travis, thank you for joining. Have a great Sunday.

[01:03:00] And I guess enjoy the Super Bowl.

[01:03:02] And I'll, I'll catch you throughout the week.

[01:03:04] And we'll talk about Pimball and watch our wives roll their eyes as we continue

[01:03:09] to talk about the silliest item on planet Earth.

[01:03:12] Well, hey, I got to say just enjoy your last few days of not having total chaos

[01:03:18] because while being a dad is the greatest thing in the world.

[01:03:21] And I'm so happy for you that you get to experience that.

[01:03:24] It does get crazy that first month.

[01:03:26] But you, you won't trade it for anything in the world.

[01:03:29] Definitely congratulations.

[01:03:30] I know. Well, that's why you know, and we get so few days off.

[01:03:34] It's so funny. It's so funny.

[01:03:35] This country, how we, we revolve everything around work, right?

[01:03:39] It's like, come on. Dad should get like at least a couple months off.

[01:03:43] Like we don't.

[01:03:44] This guy, you just got to take him off.

[01:03:46] Yeah. That's that. That's what I did.

[01:03:47] I just, I own my own business at the time and I just said, forget it.

[01:03:50] I'm ignoring everything for a month straight.

[01:03:53] Yeah.

[01:03:53] And I mean, that's the only thing to do.

[01:03:56] My company is good. I'll get at least a month.

[01:03:58] I get, I think I get something like six weeks, which isn't bad.

[01:04:00] But Facebook, get this six months paid.

[01:04:03] If you work for Facebook, pay in the wrong business then.

[01:04:07] Men and women, six months paid.

[01:04:09] We are in the wrong business.

[01:04:10] Facebook, if you're hiring, look, please.

[01:04:13] Man, if only we worked at GameStop, we'd be, we'd be off every day.

[01:04:18] I'm Travis.

[01:04:19] I've been riding that train for sure.

[01:04:21] Yeah. It's amazing.

[01:04:23] Travis, have an awesome day, brother. Thank you.

[01:04:25] I appreciate it. Thank you.

[01:04:26] Close in time.

[01:04:29] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings.

[01:04:34] And.
