[00:00] Skyphtish that I wish you saw, Sidecast of Mr. Noah at all,

[00:05] I'll close your eyes and I'll kiss you, Cuz with the birds I'll share.

[00:10] Se-duh Se-duh Se-duh Se-duh Se-duh Se-duh Se-duh Se-duh Se-duh Se-duh

[00:14] Ah, happy Monday everybody, Welcome to Canade is Pinball Podcast,

[00:19] how's everybody doing? How's your summer going? You know how I feel,

[00:24] that this is a winter sport so it's not worth arguing about pinball right now,

[00:29] You should be outdoors with your friends,

[00:32] with your family, having a good time out there

[00:35] in the sunshine.

[00:36] I don't know where you are,

[00:37] but where I am in Connecticut,

[00:40] it's been very, very rainy and rainy days

[00:44] make you wanna play pinball.

[00:45] So what's happening in this pinball world right now?

[00:48] How's everybody feeling as we head towards July?

[00:52] Are we gonna get Jaws 50th anniversary

[00:56] on Friday, July 4th?

[00:58] I'm hearing that might be the rumored date

[01:01] in which Stern is gonna unveil and reveal this game.

[01:06] I don't know, I mean, do we need more Jaws machines?

[01:10] Will it sell?

[01:12] I think it'll do okay, right?

[01:14] Because I think more people are thinking

[01:17] that Jaws is a better game than King Kong.

[01:21] Interesting that we might get two Elwyn games

[01:26] that Stern is trying to move new in box,

[01:29] going against each other.

[01:31] I could see them waiting a little bit

[01:33] on revealing Jaws 50th

[01:35] because they wanna sell more King Kong machines,

[01:38] but as I go into the King Kong thread,

[01:41] it's a big issue.

[01:43] The mechanical issues with this game

[01:45] is really something that nobody wants to go in on right now.

[01:50] If I were you, I would maybe be a little bit hesitant,

[01:55] maybe a lot of bit hesitant to go in on a game

[01:59] where the majority of the thread,

[02:01] and this is the King Kong hype and owners threads,

[02:05] the majority of the conversation

[02:08] is how to fix the game,

[02:11] how to get the game working consistently.

[02:15] That is not good.

[02:17] I am not in the evil dead thread

[02:20] seeing people trying to fix their games every single week.

[02:24] I'm seeing people try to fix their X-Men's.

[02:27] People are hoping the X-Men code gets better,

[02:30] but that's also not gonna change

[02:33] the stuff mechanically with the game.

[02:36] So, look, I hope X-Men, you know how I feel,

[02:38] I hope X-Men has a turnaround

[02:42] and becomes the great game it might be able to become,

[02:46] but again, at these prices,

[02:49] I feel like everyone's just feeling this.

[02:50] You wanna buy a game and you want it to work

[02:54] right out of the box.

[02:55] Is that such a high demand to have

[02:59] for something that costs this much money?

[03:02] And it makes me wonder,

[03:03] like what was it like back in the day?

[03:05] You guys ever think about this?

[03:06] What was it like back in the day when you bought,

[03:09] and I was never there,

[03:11] when you bought a new in box, Lord of the Rings,

[03:14] in 2004, did the game work right out of the box?

[03:19] Did the game have all the code it needed to

[03:23] right out of the box?

[03:24] What were those older games like?

[03:27] And I would love it if you were around back then

[03:30] and an operator and unbox some of those earlier

[03:33] stern machines, I tend to believe that these games

[03:37] were more code complete back then.

[03:39] There wasn't as much competition back then.

[03:42] There wasn't as much of a rush

[03:45] to get so many games out a year.

[03:48] So I think right now, where we're at,

[03:51] it's like, Stern needs three cornerstone games a year

[03:55] and they're gonna vault something

[03:57] and they're gonna anniversary something.

[03:59] And so they need to keep that big factory going.

[04:03] They're moving so quickly

[04:05] that they are okay releasing games

[04:08] where the code is not even close to being complete.

[04:11] And also mechanically, it's clear that mechanically,

[04:15] this stuff is not being tested enough

[04:18] before it's being sold to you.

[04:21] And the fact that the stuff that's being sold to you

[04:24] is the most expensive version goes out first now

[04:28] is really killing any FOMO that was left

[04:32] around owning an LE version of these games.

[04:36] And that's a big issue.

[04:38] I think if you were to pull people right now,

[04:41] remember when I used to say like,

[04:42] whoever spends the most amount of money

[04:44] should get on the plane first.

[04:46] But now I'm feeling like,

[04:48] LE owners don't wanna be first.

[04:50] Why do you wanna be first through the door now

[04:53] and get a game that's incomplete

[04:55] or get a game that's gonna have so many mechanical issues?

[04:58] Because think about it, if your X-Men LE

[05:01] wasn't the first on the line

[05:03] and they made the pros and the premiums first

[05:05] and that's where people caught the issues,

[05:08] both with the code and the hardware,

[05:10] you might not go in on your game.

[05:13] And stern machines are not non-refundable deposits.

[05:17] So I don't know, I'm just feeling this vibe

[05:19] where people are kinda over rushing in,

[05:22] spending the most and being a guinea pig

[05:24] that's ultimately gonna be somewhat frustrated

[05:27] and unsatisfied with the purchase.

[05:30] So talking about rushing in,

[05:32] the Pimball Brothers have released an official statement

[05:36] about what's been going on around this predator launch.

[05:40] And you know how I feel, this thing is kind of like

[05:42] a disaster, it's kind of a disaster

[05:44] that on the week they took non-refundable orders

[05:48] on their game, they had a clip circulating with Arnold

[05:53] and a clip that was never approved by the company.

[05:56] And it took them a while to respond.

[05:58] I mean, this is like days later, you gotta remember this.

[06:02] They were taking orders on a game

[06:05] in which a lot of people were sharing something

[06:08] as a sales asset and everyone was pointing at it,

[06:11] being like, look at this, he's really gonna be in the game

[06:14] in a decent fashion and so the game's gonna be much better

[06:17] than we thought.

[06:18] And then you realize, no, no, he's not.

[06:22] And I still have a lot of questions

[06:23] about how that clip even happened.

[06:26] They knew they never had permission to make that

[06:29] and yet it was made and not only that,

[06:33] somehow they sent this clip out to people.

[06:36] It was coming from them.

[06:37] Remember, nobody broke into Pinball Brothers late at night

[06:41] and took this footage.

[06:43] They created that asset and they sent it out to people.

[06:48] Okay, it was them.

[06:50] This whole thing about it leaked, it didn't leak,

[06:52] you sent it out, nobody robbed it from you.

[06:56] So here's their official statement.

[06:58] A million DMs about Predator and we love to see it.

[07:02] Thanks for the massive interest in the game.

[07:05] The leaked internal clip, question mark, yeah.

[07:09] It raised more questions than answers.

[07:11] The opposite of what our official gameplay videos

[07:14] are meant to do.

[07:16] We're working on several gameplay clips

[07:18] that show off the assets, features and feel of the game

[07:22] and actually answer your questions.

[07:25] But first, we must address the leak

[07:28] and the confusion it caused.

[07:30] Okay, I just wanna stop right there.

[07:32] They are still working on official gameplay clips.

[07:36] They don't have one ready yet.

[07:38] Were they ready to take your money last week?

[07:40] Absolutely.

[07:41] Were they ready to take non-refundable deposits

[07:44] on their game?

[07:45] Yup, and they still don't have official gameplay clips.

[07:50] And I'm just gonna say this.

[07:51] I don't know why I always have to say this stuff.

[07:53] You should not have revealed your game

[07:56] unless official gameplay clips that show customers

[08:00] what they can expect for the money.

[08:02] Remember, this is a $15,500 game if you're all in on it.

[08:08] Okay, if you don't have that ready,

[08:11] then you're not ready to reveal your game

[08:14] and launch your game to the world.

[08:16] You're not ready to take people's

[08:18] non-refundable deposits and yet they did.

[08:21] And they also knew that that Arnold clip

[08:24] was out there in the world.

[08:26] It's not like it leaked that day.

[08:28] They knew people had it.

[08:30] They actually probably know who they sent it to.

[08:33] Okay, so let's go on to see what they say next.

[08:36] They say, we wanna address the leak

[08:38] and the confusion it caused.

[08:40] The next sentence is this.

[08:41] Here's what you would have learned

[08:44] from our official gameplay.

[08:46] We have all the team member clips, assets,

[08:49] and voices except Billy.

[08:51] The license holder is firm on that.

[08:54] No one's getting Billy.

[08:56] You either leave Predator 87 alone

[08:59] or work around it and we chose to work around it.

[09:03] That said, we can use all of Billy's original quotes.

[09:07] Okay, now does that mean a voice actor's doing Billy's quotes

[09:11] or Billy is speaking them just no images of Billy?

[09:16] Not clear.

[09:17] Okay, this is meant to clear up any confusion.

[09:21] Does this clear it up?

[09:23] They then go on to say, Arnold is in the game

[09:27] but we don't have closeups on his face at least for now.

[09:32] All right, so right there.

[09:34] You're basically telling people

[09:36] we don't have his face not yet all of these maybes.

[09:41] Look, Pimbal Brothers,

[09:43] the most confusing thing you can tell someone

[09:46] who's just looking for an answer is maybe.

[09:50] Right, we're not sure yet

[09:52] if we're gonna have all of him or more of him or not.

[09:55] Yes, you are.

[09:57] Yes, you are.

[09:58] You know you don't have permission.

[10:01] Just give us a hard no.

[10:04] A hard no is better than a soft maybe

[10:08] and all of these soft maybes are the reason why

[10:11] people are confused about what they are getting.

[10:14] They then go on to say, you'll see him from the side,

[10:18] the back, full body, et cetera.

[10:21] What does that mean?

[10:22] How can you see Arnold full body

[10:25] but not see his face?

[10:26] I think what they're gonna do

[10:28] is they're gonna take those quick cuts

[10:30] where you see just the arms holding the guns

[10:32] and everybody from behind walking through the jungle

[10:34] but you're never gonna see Arnold's face.

[10:37] And then they go on to say, and it works.

[10:39] You play as Dutch, assembling your team,

[10:42] gearing up, taking on missions

[10:44] and going up against the predator.

[10:46] We have all of Arnold's quotes performed by a voice actor.

[10:50] Get to the choppa, it sounds just right.

[10:54] There are no other restrictions not on clips, sounds,

[10:57] blood, gore or guns.

[10:59] The game's packed with original movie moments

[11:01] and call outs from the best goddamn rescue team

[11:05] in cinema history.

[11:06] Thanks for your pinball passion

[11:08] and see you in the jungle.

[11:09] All right, so look, I understand what these guys are doing.

[11:12] There's a damage control going on here

[11:14] and they're trying to spin this a little bit

[11:16] and basically what we know is that

[11:19] we're gonna get some Arnold.

[11:21] We don't really know how much.

[11:23] It would help us if they showed us a clip

[11:26] or a mode in the game in which we got a sense

[11:30] of how this is all gonna be incorporated.

[11:32] Have you seen that?

[11:34] No.

[11:35] When are we gonna see a stream of this game?

[11:37] Nobody knows, but yet they will take your money today.

[11:41] And this is just another example, ladies and gentlemen,

[11:44] where another company is releasing a game too soon,

[11:48] too early, they don't have enough to show us.

[11:51] And I think FOMO is dead.

[11:53] They're not gonna make a limited number of this game.

[11:55] They've also been very ambiguous on that.

[11:58] Our only limit is how many we can make

[12:00] and we're thinking around 800,

[12:02] but it's not limited to 800.

[12:05] You are not gonna get game number 17 out of 800.

[12:09] So by doing that, they created confusion

[12:12] on how many they're gonna make.

[12:13] By allowing that Arnold leak to get out there,

[12:16] they created confusion on what's in the game.

[12:19] By not putting out their own gameplay video,

[12:22] they have also created more confusion

[12:23] about what's actually in the game.

[12:26] So three confusing things in a row

[12:29] and all three of those things

[12:31] could have been handled better by the pinball brothers.

[12:35] And yet it was not.

[12:37] And yet this is what you get.

[12:39] And so you wonder why he can hate

[12:41] as like scratching his head again.

[12:44] What are these companies really thinking?

[12:46] These aren't brand new companies to pinball.

[12:49] These people have been around for so long.

[12:52] And it's weird to me too that they forgotten

[12:55] how you still need FOMO if you're a boutique company.

[12:58] I think they forgot that.

[13:00] Making it wishy-washy around

[13:01] if the game's limited or not.

[13:03] They forgot seemingly what a lawyer would say to them,

[13:06] you better not even put them into the game code wise.

[13:10] If you know you don't have permission,

[13:12] they seemingly forgot that.

[13:13] And then they even seemingly forgot

[13:15] how to make their own gameplay video

[13:18] off of the license or approved content.

[13:20] They seemingly didn't do that for us.

[13:22] And so because of all the things they forgot to do,

[13:25] maybe you shouldn't buy one right now.

[13:28] Maybe you should wait to see how this game pans out.

[13:30] And remember, this game's not even on the line

[13:32] until August people.

[13:34] So anyone who ordered one already,

[13:36] I really do think you might need to have your head examined

[13:39] because you just haven't seen enough.

[13:41] Everybody look, I could look at this thread.

[13:44] I could look at the Harry Potter thread.

[13:46] You know, people are enjoying Potter,

[13:47] but there's still a lot of question marks

[13:49] to see how the Potter code will end up becoming.

[13:53] I'm still reading people saying,

[13:55] there's a lot of stacking going on.

[13:57] And even in the new code, like you just feel

[13:59] like there's so much happening at once.

[14:01] I really hope Jersey Jack simplifies that.

[14:04] The ball's in their court.

[14:06] And they have plenty of time to do it

[14:08] because they're gonna be making this game

[14:09] for a really long time.

[14:11] But I think the thing that I'm seeing

[14:13] sitting over all of this is that all of these games

[14:16] have more work to be done.

[14:18] And buying them early on now just feels like pointless.

[14:23] Like there absolutely feels like no reason why.

[14:26] You should be going in on any games early.

[14:29] All of the FOMO is dead now that these games are unlimited

[14:33] or there's way too many of them out there

[14:36] for it to feel even like there is any FOMO.

[14:38] And so then you add it all up together.

[14:40] Companies releasing products before they're done.

[14:44] Long before they're done.

[14:45] Mechanical issues in games that keep popping up

[14:49] and you're gonna be the guinea pig

[14:51] because none of these companies play test.

[14:53] They don't play test these games on location.

[14:56] They simply play test them internally.

[14:58] Is that enough?

[15:00] Apparently not.

[15:01] Because if Stern was doing internal play testing

[15:04] on these games, how did they not fix

[15:06] and find the issues with X-Men?

[15:08] The issues with King Kong, all right?

[15:10] So I'm just going off of what we're experiencing

[15:13] in the game itself.

[15:14] And if you put games on location and you get real feedback,

[15:18] maybe you hear from people,

[15:19] hey, that scoop shot's a little too hard to hit

[15:22] for Harry Potter.

[15:23] If you make that the way you start a mode in the game,

[15:26] it's not gonna be that much fun for most players.

[15:29] Maybe think about a different way

[15:31] or a way to select the shot that starts the mode in the game.

[15:34] They didn't do that, right?

[15:35] So they're learning right now,

[15:37] but the game's already out there.

[15:38] And that's what's happening throughout Pimball right now.

[15:41] And I think a lot of people are just tired

[15:44] of going in early and getting burned.

[15:46] And when you get burned and you go in early,

[15:49] now the heat you're gonna feel is much worse

[15:51] than it ever was before.

[15:53] And again, because there's so many options

[15:55] and there's so many games out there

[15:57] and there's so many great games you can go by used

[16:01] that you don't have to worry about any of that.

[16:03] There's so many games where you don't have to worry

[16:05] about the mechanics, you don't have to worry about the code,

[16:08] you just know it's a great game.

[16:10] You might have to do stuff here and there

[16:11] to keep the game going.

[16:13] For the most part, a lot of these games,

[16:15] if you go into the threads,

[16:17] those threads are not inundated with owners

[16:20] trying to fix new inbox problems.

[16:23] And that's the crazy part

[16:25] about the last couple years of Pimball.

[16:28] You combine, for the most part,

[16:30] more underwhelming themes with a lot

[16:33] of quality control issues and incomplete code.

[16:37] And then the highest prices Pimball has ever been.

[16:41] And then you add up all the losses people have had

[16:45] to endure if they bought early and right away.

[16:48] And then the answer is so simple.

[16:51] If you just wait and see, you can go get all these games

[16:55] and you can avoid the headaches.

[16:56] You can avoid the games that are just gonna be headaches

[16:59] that you're gonna wanna move on from quickly.

[17:01] I think a reckoning is coming.

[17:02] I do, I think a reckoning is coming in this hobby

[17:05] and I think we're gonna see a reckoning

[17:07] within the next year.

[17:09] And by reckoning, I just think we're gonna start to see

[17:11] less and less people run at these new inbox games.

[17:15] And the thing I'm really worried about is,

[17:17] like all these thousands of unsold games

[17:20] that Stern has, just with no homes.

[17:24] Like what happens when those games have to go somewhere?

[17:27] What's gonna happen, right?

[17:28] You're gonna start to get really good deals on games.

[17:31] And it's gonna be hard when you spend $6,000 on a game

[17:36] and it's great to justify spending $15,000 on a game.

[17:41] Cause no game, I mean there's no game.

[17:44] Whether you're talking Galactic Tank Force and Godzilla,

[17:47] no game is $9,000 more fun than any other game

[17:53] in the history of Pinball.

[17:54] It's just not because all Pinball is somewhat fun.

[17:57] And if you're in a good mood

[17:59] and you walk up to a Galactic Tank Force,

[18:01] you're still gonna have some fun playing Pinball.

[18:03] I mean that, speaking of Galactic Tank Force,

[18:05] have you seen American Pinball?

[18:07] Is trying to fire sale these games,

[18:10] the reason why is this,

[18:12] Mukesh will not let them make Cuphead,

[18:15] which is ready to go until they sell

[18:17] all the existing inventory.

[18:20] Problem is, nobody wants those games.

[18:23] At what price would you want

[18:25] a signature edition of Galactic Tank Force?

[18:28] Do you even want one for eight grand or seven grand?

[18:32] I think the price for these games

[18:34] is more like $5,000.

[18:37] I do, it's just like no one wants it.

[18:39] Nobody really wants it.

[18:41] All right, so speaking of wanting games,

[18:43] I was watching the Carl's Stream on Dune Pinball this week.

[18:46] I believe it was Friday night at eight o'clock.

[18:49] I think it was Friday.

[18:50] It was good to see more of the game.

[18:52] It was really great to hear Carl explain how the game works,

[18:56] the way they are integrating the theme in this game.

[18:58] I like it more than Harry Potter's theme integration.

[19:01] I like the way the movie is coming at you in a better way.

[19:05] I like the way the movie clips go full screen.

[19:08] I like the way you hear from the actors synced up.

[19:11] I love the way those two screens can connect to each other

[19:14] through certain modes in the game.

[19:17] I love the way the game goes from like nighttime to daytime,

[19:21] and you really do feel the transformation

[19:24] of that world under glass, very well done.

[19:27] The music, the orchestration of this game,

[19:30] it's super, super cool.

[19:31] Like I love everything about the theme integration

[19:34] in this Dune Pinball machine.

[19:36] The only thing I can't do,

[19:38] and I just can't create this inside my bones,

[19:41] it's coming at me so nicely,

[19:43] I just can't make myself personally and emotionally

[19:48] connect with what's happening in that movie.

[19:52] And that's the big issue,

[19:54] is even though I love everything I'm seeing,

[19:57] it's like you made the most delicious eggplant imaginable.

[20:01] And for people that love eggplant,

[20:03] they're gonna love this so much.

[20:06] Like if you love these Dune movies,

[20:08] this is the greatest pin for you,

[20:11] but I'm a chicken parm guy.

[20:13] I'm a back to the future guy.

[20:15] I'm a Star Wars guy.

[20:17] I'm a big trouble in little China guy.

[20:19] I'm a fifth element guy.

[20:20] I'm a diehard guy.

[20:21] I'm a karate kid guy.

[20:23] I'm a matrix guy.

[20:24] I'm a top gun guy.

[20:25] You make those games.

[20:27] You make those games with this good of a theme integration

[20:30] and I'm buying one on day one.

[20:33] I just can't make myself like something theme-wise

[20:38] that I'm just not into.

[20:40] I mean it, it's also why I don't even own an Evil Dead.

[20:43] As cool as that game is,

[20:44] I know that Beetlejuice is coming.

[20:47] So I'm just gonna wait

[20:48] because I'd much rather have the best of both worlds.

[20:51] I don't want just a great pinball experience.

[20:54] I want a great pinball experience

[20:56] based on a theme I love.

[20:57] And you know how I feel?

[20:59] I have a Guns N' Roses.

[21:00] I'm more willing to have a great theme I love

[21:03] that's an okay pinball experience

[21:06] versus a great pinball experience

[21:08] based on a theme I don't like.

[21:10] It's why I would rather have G&R over Iron Maiden.

[21:14] It's just how I am.

[21:16] And I'm allowed to have that opinion everybody.

[21:19] Happy Monday, Canada out.

[21:21] Close your eyes and I'll kiss you

[21:23] cause with birds of care.

[21:26] I'll never leave you.
