[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canadians Pinball Podcast. Happy Friday. How's everybody doing? Welcome

[00:16] to the world's least confrontational, least controversial Pinball Podcast. We're going

[00:23] to talk about the Kinetesis. Trying to take down Harry Potter by bringing up JK Rowlings

[00:30] like views on trans people. What is going on? We come to Pinball to escape what's going

[00:37] on in the real world. I'm really ashamed about that post. And then we're going to go around

[00:42] the Pinball Horn. Let's talk about everything going on because what's not going on is us

[00:47] discussing Harry Potter. I heard the delays are somewhat significant. I don't think we're

[00:53] going to get this game maybe until June now. So we'll talk about that. And that gives more

[00:59] time to sell these King Kongs that nobody wants. Gives more time for barrels of fun to get

[01:05] people into Dune. I'm not sure what the next move is going to be there. But let's go around

[01:10] and talk about everything happening everywhere. How's that sound? Let's start with this silly

[01:14] post by Colin. He knows what he's doing. He's smart enough to know who the Pinball buying

[01:20] demographic is. And I'm really disappointed. I'm disappointed because you got to remember.

[01:26] This was the guy that was all about Pinball positivity. Let's bring more people into Pinball.

[01:32] All right. Think about that for a minute. If you want to bring people into Pinball and

[01:36] you want to cast a wide net that gets everybody excited about the hobby you love. And also

[01:41] Colin is doing this for a living. This is how this guy makes his money. He's not making

[01:46] a lot of money. And if you're smart, you don't put up a post like this that's going to drive

[01:52] away the majority of people that buy Pinball, that read Pinball content. Sure, you can like

[01:59] virtual signal and get a few people to agree with you. But for the most part, a post like

[02:04] this is meant to divide people. It's meant to bully people. It's meant to trigger people.

[02:10] It's meant to like out people on being closed minded, whatever he wants to do. I'm not going

[02:14] to share with you my views on this because this is not why you come here. And I'm not

[02:19] going to pick on you and ask for your views on this because this is not why I want you

[02:25] here. I want you to talk about Harry Potter Pinball in the sense of the rules in the toys

[02:30] and the layout and the art, everything about this game. I don't want to know what you feel

[02:35] about someone who made a book like 20, 30 years ago and what their political views are.

[02:41] That's not why we're here. So I'm disappointed to see that. I know why he did it. He wants

[02:47] to get the attention and we're going to give him a little bit of that attention right now.

[02:51] But I'm also going to declare right now, this is why I want nothing to do with the Twippies

[02:56] moving forward. He's the head of it. I want nothing to do with these people. They're all

[03:02] fakes in my mind. I'm serious. They're all fakes. They're all hiding behind an agenda

[03:07] and it's crystal clear what that agenda is and I want nothing to do with it. I don't

[03:12] hang with people like that. All right. Let's talk about everyone else in Pinball right

[03:17] now. Let's start with Jersey Jack. So everybody thought Harry Potter was coming this week.

[03:22] I heard earlier in the week there was not going to be a distro or dealer call that didn't

[03:27] happen. So we know that Jersey Jack, when they turn on the marketing around this game,

[03:34] they're going to have a dealer call scheduled. They're also going to invite Pinball content

[03:40] creators. Curious if they still invite Colin after he tries to sandbag their launch with

[03:46] a question like that, but they will. They will. But here's the thing. This game I'm

[03:51] hearing has changes by JK Rowling and I think that the changes might require them to make

[03:58] new playfields, which means if they've built games, I think they might be in trouble and

[04:04] they might have to go back and reassemble the final version approved by the author herself.

[04:11] So I don't know. I don't know the latest. They are keeping a lot of this very hush and so I

[04:18] would expect if I were us that we are not going to see Harry Potter until maybe June. So if we

[04:26] get it earlier, thank you. I think everybody is tired of waiting. We just want to see the game

[04:32] and that's that. All right, Stern Pinball, King Kong. It's not selling very well. It's clear

[04:39] that it's not selling very well. The mighty goose that lays the golden eggs did not knock it out

[04:45] of the park. I think we've all talked about this enough. We've been beating this dead horse. I

[04:50] think Stern made every model look too similar. I think King Kong without assets doesn't really

[04:57] work. I think people have zombie Eddie fatigue every game starting to look the same. And I just

[05:03] think at this price point, it's not enough. You got to go watch Carrie Hardy's video on the

[05:09] Ellie of the game. Again, we're not saying it's not a fun game. We're not saying it's not a great

[05:14] shooter. We're not saying it's not a good theme for pinball. But what we're saying is for this much

[05:20] money, Stern is cutting a lot of corners. People are tired of it. And everybody knows that this

[05:26] game is just going to lose money because they didn't give it enough detail. They didn't separate

[05:32] the models enough. And it's not personal, Stern. It's professional. We just don't think you're

[05:38] going far enough professionally to warrant this kind of money for these games. And you either got

[05:44] to lower the price, or you got to give us more. So speaking of more, I think everybody's going to

[05:49] quickly move on to the next game. I know D&D owners, I'm in that thread D&D owners interesting,

[05:55] those guys are enjoying the game. But I also think what's going to happen when I've been reading D&D

[06:00] owners is a lot of them are making their way through this D&D world. Remember, that game is a game

[06:07] where you save your progress, and you keep playing to achieve new things. So, you know, guys are

[06:12] playing for like two and a half hours in a single going in a single game. Remember, it's like not

[06:19] like they're starting over every time their game is over, they're starting where they left off. And

[06:24] so I think what's going to happen with D&D that's going to get really interesting is there's going

[06:29] to come a moment where Stern is done with the code. And all the owners, because it's save your

[06:36] progress kind of game, they're going to end up seeing everything. And I think they're going to be

[06:40] done with the game. It's kind of like when you beat a Final Fantasy role playing game. It's a lot

[06:47] of fun, right? The journey is the enjoyment. But once the journey is over, you're not going to play

[06:54] it again. You're not going to want to do it all over again. And I think that's going to lead to like

[07:00] a ton of D&Ds hitting the second hand market. And that's fine, right? Some people can then go on the

[07:06] journey for the first time. But I think a lot of these games are going to hit the market at the

[07:10] same time. But all of the attention on Stern is going to be what's next. It's John Borg. It's most

[07:17] likely Star Wars. There's no way I can't imagine it's going to be Star Wars episodes, what four

[07:23] through six, you know, the original trilogy, there's no way. And here's why Stern sold like eight

[07:30] thousand of those Steve Ritchie games. And that's based on the original trilogy. Dwight destroyed the

[07:37] code in that game, stacking the different scenes from the movies, Tie Fighter on a spring. I hate

[07:43] that game. There's not many games I will say the word I hate. I hate that game because I love Star

[07:50] Wars so much. And they butchered it, but they sold 8000. There is no way Stern is going to burn.

[07:57] Everybody who owns that game and make another game based on the same movie. So I think they might go

[08:05] episode one through three. I hope it's that versus the Skeleton Crew. If it is Skeleton Crew, the

[08:12] game won't sell very well. And then after Star Wars, the big rumor is Pokemon from Jack Danger.

[08:19] Again, Worlds number one IP. But I also don't think Pokemon Cross is over to the pinball buying

[08:27] demo. I think it could be another avatar situation. Even though the box office is so big, even though

[08:33] the gross of Pokemon is so big, how many of you have watched a Pokemon cartoon ever? How many of

[08:40] you trade Pokemon cards? How many of you care about Pokemon? And I would say about 90% of you are

[08:47] like I don't care at all. That's not good. You would rather have Back to the Future than Pokemon.

[08:53] Okay, after Pokemon, I really don't know what's next from Stern. After Pokemon, we're going to get

[08:59] the next from Brian Eddy and then the next from Keith Elwyn. We all knew about Elwyn's King Kong

[09:05] for the longest time for many years. Nobody's rumored what's Keith Elwyn's next. So if you know

[09:13] what Elwyn's next is, let me know at canadapinball at gmail.com. All right, that's Stern pinball,

[09:20] Spooky Pinball. Spooky Pinball is having a great 2025. They've sold all their evil

[09:26] deads. The evil dead praise continues. I think people are realizing it is the best game of 2025

[09:32] so far. And the thing about this company, I mean, there's been a fun debate about whether or not

[09:37] they should use shooter rods or launch buttons on the game. Lots of fun debate there. I really

[09:43] don't mind. I really don't like skill shots to me. It doesn't matter. Skill shots is like,

[09:49] I don't know. It's like such a small part of the gameplay experience. And you know, whenever you're

[09:56] like at League Night or you're watching good players, like slowly pull back the shooter rod,

[10:02] trying to perfectly nail that skill shot, they look like losers. I mean it. We all look like

[10:08] losers and chumps when we're trying to perfectly hit that skill shot. Who cares? And in so many of

[10:14] these modern games, it feels like there's 18 skill shots in the game. I think every game should have

[10:20] just one skill shot. That's it. Don't give me 18 different. Don't have all the different stuff

[10:27] lighting up. I don't really care about a variety of things to start out my game. Just get me in the

[10:34] game and don't charge me a ton of money. All right. So spooky pimple. The next game from them

[10:39] is most likely Beetlejuice. It's going to sell out in an instant. And I know there's been a debate

[10:45] about whether or not it should be Goonies or it should be Beetlejuice. I'm just going to say this

[10:50] right now. They're both sell out on day one properties. They're both titles that everybody

[10:57] is really excited for. I think Beetlejuice translates better into pinball than the Goonies.

[11:05] That being said, I think they're both great potentials for a world under glass. And I also,

[11:12] I don't know who has Goonies. I keep seeing barrels of fun. We're going to talk about them

[11:17] next, but they keep teasing Goonies. I'm not sure why they're doing that when they got to get

[11:21] people excited about Dune. But I think it's going to be Beetlejuice. And the thing with

[11:25] spooky is this. If the next game is Beetlejuice day one sell out, and then they make that game

[11:31] for an entire year. I love where this company is at. I think out of everybody, the spooky

[11:39] pinball crew is going to bed and sleeping the best. I think they're the ones who are waking up in the

[11:47] best mood. I think they're having the most fun out of everybody. Name me another pinball company

[11:55] that looks like they're having as much fun as spooky. And that is why buying from them is so

[12:02] much fun. And I don't think the other companies can genuinely present themselves as such a lovable

[12:10] company the way spooky does. It is so authentic. And I think other companies are more guarded.

[12:18] They're more serious. They're more obnoxious. They're more scared. They're more anxious. Everything. I

[12:24] just don't think anybody out there's got the vibes that spookies got. And I really do believe that.

[12:31] And I'm a good judge of human character. I really am. Canada is. He really is. I mean,

[12:36] I really do love complimenting myself. And I just did. Alright, let's go to Barrels of Fun.

[12:41] So Barrels of Fun. This company, they got Dune Pinball out in the world. And the main question

[12:47] I have now is, okay, what's next? Like, what do they do next to get people excited about this game?

[12:55] They just had the gentleman from Mythbusters. He gets a ton of views. He got a Dune Pinball machine.

[13:00] He did a great walkthrough of the game. And here's my thing, though, in that video, what did they do

[13:06] again? They once again teased Goonies. And I'm just like, seriously, I fired a text message to David

[13:14] Van Ness. I'm like, David, stop. Why do you think this is funny? You need to sell Dune Pinball.

[13:22] Why do you keep misdirecting everybody's attention and enthusiasm towards Goonies? I don't know what

[13:29] they're doing, but I don't like it. It's like, I would not do anything that takes attention away

[13:36] from Dune right now. As Gary says, the only game I care about is the game on the line. He's right.

[13:45] He's right. And so when you do this video that's meant to sell more Dune machines, and then all of

[13:52] a sudden you're teasing like Goonies is around the corner, I think where this is coming from. And I

[13:57] want to be candid here. I think where this is coming from. I think David is insecure. I do. I

[14:04] think he's like building this brand and he's got a lot of other titles in the mix. And Dune didn't

[14:11] land like he thought it would. It didn't. It's not selling great. It's not. And they're going to

[14:18] struggle to sell a thousand of these. And I think he's kind of like, I want more attention. I want

[14:25] people to believe in this company more than they currently are. And the sales aren't there. So you

[14:30] know, like look at, we're going to have other fun stuff. Like the barrel is going to be filled with

[14:35] so much fun. But in the end, David, and I've been saying this to him and I'll say it to you, in the

[14:41] end, you need to make better decisions so you don't end up here. You need themes that can just sell

[14:51] on their own. We're not buying into your brand. Consumers are buying a specific title. You've

[14:59] made a better game than Labyrinth. The game is impressive, but it's still half-baked. And I think

[15:05] that's the story of Barrels right now. I'm not sure how they reignite people's enthusiasm for

[15:13] this title. I think what they need to start doing is encouraging people to watch the movies.

[15:20] I think they need to let people know on what date is the new code going to drop. And I think

[15:27] they're going to have to figure out a way to make the streams of the new code drops enticing enough

[15:34] to get people to spend 12. Ah, it's such a hard thing now, right? You really need to nail the

[15:40] theme better because at this much money, it's almost like, remember Pirates when it first came

[15:45] out, the more you stream the game, the more you show it to people, it doesn't necessarily get you

[15:52] more FOMO. It almost makes people kind of good. Like they feel like they've seen it. Now I've seen

[15:59] it again. Now I'm seeing it again. And watching a pinball machine slowly come to life is not the

[16:07] best marketing strategy. You want on day one of reveal, you want all thousand of your games to

[16:14] sell out if you're barrels of fun. You at least want to sell five to six hundred the way Spooky

[16:19] did of Evil Dead. But I don't think they came even close. And now I think it's going to be a slow

[16:25] burn. It's going to be a slow journey through that desert to get all these Dune machines sold.

[16:30] So that's barrels of fun. Speaking of slow movement, have you heard any update on Chicago Gaming

[16:37] Company getting people their Merlin editions of medieval madness? I think they did it once again,

[16:44] people. They got like a thousand or twelve hundred people to submit non-refundable deposits.

[16:52] And do you know when you're getting your game? I thought everyone was getting their games starting

[16:57] in the summer. It is the summer. And that's what's happening at CGC. Another Radio Silent Company.

[17:05] I've told you this. I'll tell you this again. I will not support this company because I don't like

[17:09] the way they treat their customers. I don't even care what the final product is. I'm just not happy

[17:14] with the service. It's like you go to a restaurant. The food can be delicious. But if the service is

[17:19] terrible, I'm not going back. And to me, that's Chicago Gaming Company. The service is always

[17:24] terrible. I don't care. I don't care about Pulp Fiction. I don't care about medieval madness.

[17:28] I don't care about anything they make. This service is bad. And it's on them to turn their service

[17:33] around. Okay, so that's Chicago Gaming Company. Let's go on to Padready Gaming. I'm hearing

[17:39] Padready Gaming is going to release any day now. They're going to release a Tales of the Arabian

[17:45] Knights remake. It is going to have a software update kit in it. The problem with this company

[17:52] is everybody knows the quality is not there. They only sold a couple hundred funhouses. And when I

[17:58] talked to distributors, when people have issues with their funhouse, this company's customer service

[18:04] is not great. So there's a reason why, you know, funhouse didn't sell very well. And I don't think

[18:11] people are looking at Padready Gaming as where they want to send a check for 10,000 plus, even

[18:16] though people love Toten, there's enough original ones out there that are built like tanks that I

[18:23] would be hesitant. Now, the other thing they're going to do is a new art package. Again, Toten's

[18:27] one of the games that doesn't need a new art package. It's one of the most beautiful games

[18:32] from back in the day. They are going to have Brian Allen do his magic on the machine. He did the new

[18:39] funhouse version. And so expect that in the world sometime soon. Pinball Brothers Predator. No news

[18:47] whatsoever. So what I heard is they don't want to go up against Harry Potter. Of course that's

[18:53] smart, but you know, why not? I mean, they probably would have been better off releasing

[18:58] right now. Kong was like, eh, Dune didn't light the world on fire. They would have had an entire

[19:05] month to themselves of being the new game. I get it though. I think a lot of people are waiting

[19:12] for Harry Potter. I think a lot of people now will only buy one new machine a year, especially at

[19:20] these prices, 15k for a Harry Potter CE. So I just think a lot of people are waiting. So you know,

[19:27] if you're them, it does kind of make sense. Let Potter come out, then release Predator. I hear

[19:32] Arnold is in the game. I'm just tired of the Pinball Brothers Facebook page. It's like they're

[19:38] still marketing Alien to us and Abba. And I'm like, nobody cares guys. Time to move on. But

[19:44] Predator is next from them. That's next from them. Who are we missing? Multimorphic. Portal.

[19:50] Um, you know, the thing with this game, it's with all Jerry games. Like they get revealed.

[19:55] They make their way to shows and then nothing. Right? It takes a long time to get these out the

[20:02] door. I need to go into the portal thread and see if people are buying this game. I don't know. I

[20:08] think every Jerry game comes out. They sell a handful to people who have the platform. I've been

[20:15] asking for a year now just to get from him. How many units have you sold? How many platforms are

[20:22] out there? Nobody wants to be transparent about it. I don't get it. I do get it actually. It's

[20:28] because the number is embarrassingly low. And that's where Multimorphic is at. It's a shame because

[20:34] I do think these guys are putting some of the best engineering in all of Pinball, some of the best

[20:39] mechs in all of Pinball into this platform. All right. Who am I missing in the Pinball World?

[20:45] American Pinball. American Pinball. David Figgs. I saw him on LinkedIn. He's open to work. He's

[20:52] looking for vice presidential positions. He didn't clarify what kind of VP role. But look, man,

[20:59] I hope everybody lands on their feet. I hope he finds a job somewhere. And I do hope it's outside

[21:05] of Pinball because he had his chance. He had his dream gig. He had the reins at American. He made

[21:10] decisions I would not have made. And now we're at this point where I think they contractually have

[21:17] to get Cuphead out sooner than later. But then I think it's over. I don't think we ever see another

[21:24] Pinball machine from American Pinball. I think they're done. All right. Am I missing somebody?

[21:31] I feel like I am. I'm missing Dutch Pinball and Dutch Pinball X. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[21:38] I'm seeing this game go out the door. I'm seeing the photos online. It looks beautiful. The game

[21:45] always looks beautiful. It is better to look at than it is to play. But you know, I've always said

[21:52] this. People buying this game know what they're getting. Melvin's a really good friend. I see

[21:59] people being like, Canada said, Raza's probably next. When it comes to DPX, you probably should

[22:06] trust what Canada says. And I know like people are like, Oh, well, you know, over here, they said,

[22:12] like, come on, guys, we all know that Barry is not going to have back to the future ready in time.

[22:18] And when all the Alice's are made, they need another game on the line. So I fully expect

[22:24] 300 Raza's will be next and then back to the future. Back to the future is going to sell whenever.

[22:31] It doesn't matter when Barry releases it. I think what Barry's going to have to get smart with,

[22:36] and I will talk to them and counsel them on this is they need to not just take unlimited orders

[22:43] and make people wait 10 years for their game. I think you're going to see 88 SLES for a super

[22:48] high price. He's going to sell everyone instantly. And then I think he's going to cap it like we're

[22:54] only making this many. Look, if they said we're only going to make 2000 back to the futures,

[23:00] they could charge 15,000 for each and sell out easily, easily. Jersey Jack is going to sell

[23:07] 2000 Harry Potter CEs for 15 on top of two other models. And they're also probably going to make

[23:13] like 4000 CEs so they could easily sell that many back to the futures. I think it's going to be a

[23:19] special game. I just don't know when and it's not worth talking about it too much on a daily

[23:26] basis because it's so far away. Alright, I think I got everybody. I didn't talk about home pin

[23:32] in summary. Leave your political BS at the door. We all tune into pinball and pinball content and

[23:41] buy pinball machines as an escape from the world, from the media, from the bickering, the whining,

[23:48] the Gen Z moaning about life. The modern world has turned everybody into a complainer, into someone

[23:56] who's not enjoying life. People don't want to drink when they're young. They don't want to have

[24:00] sex. They don't want to do anything that brings enjoyment. They want to look at the world and

[24:05] complain about everything. They want to divide people. And what Colin did is just a typical

[24:12] Gen Z move and he's trying to divide everybody and it's lame. And that's why you're here. It's

[24:19] why Canadian Spinball Podcast doesn't get into that stuff. It's why we have the most subscribers out

[24:25] of all the pinball content creators out there. We've got the most here because we are the most

[24:30] open-minded. I don't allow people to bully or spew hate speech. I don't let people go off on

[24:37] political rants on my Patreon chat. We are here to talk pinball. And like I always say, let's be

[24:42] hard on the games, not too hard on the people. And that's what we do. Have a great Friday,

[24:48] everybody. Canadian out.
