[00:00] I'm bad and that's good.

[00:04] It will never be good and that's not bad.

[00:08] There's no one I'd rather be than me.

[00:23] I don't think I've been more excited for a week of pinball than I have been this week

[00:29] and I really say that from the bottom of my heart.

[00:33] I'm looking so forward to going out to Texas for the Texas pinball festival this weekend.

[00:40] I want to say this.

[00:41] I want to say thank you to everybody who emailed me and said great episode 100 with George

[00:48] Gomez.

[00:49] I really, really appreciate it.

[00:51] I think I got more emails on that episode than on any of my other episodes.

[00:57] I will say this.

[00:58] I love talking to George Gomez.

[01:00] I have nothing but respect for him and for the people at Stern and what they're doing.

[01:05] I think his passion and his enthusiasm for pinball came through loud and clear.

[01:12] I also think people are like where's the Batman code?

[01:15] Where is it?

[01:16] You said Monday Tuesday.

[01:18] I'm hoping we get the code before TPS.

[01:21] I think it would be smart to maybe bring it to the show and that people play around on

[01:26] it and then maybe release that code Monday Tuesday of next week.

[01:28] But it's going to come.

[01:30] It's going to come.

[01:31] Nobody thinks that they're not going to release that code.

[01:34] But I think TPS is just going to be this amazing show.

[01:38] It's definitely taken over.

[01:40] I'm not going to go down a list of everything that's going to happen at the show.

[01:44] But man, we're going to see a tack from Mars remake.

[01:46] We're going to see what spooky game number three is.

[01:48] We're going to hear from Dutch pinball.

[01:50] What they're game number two is we're going to see Aerosmith.

[01:53] We're going to see Houdini.

[01:55] We're going to see Dildin with new code.

[01:58] We're going to see Alien.

[01:59] I mean, the list goes on and on and on.

[02:01] I think it's a great time to be a buyer of pinball machines.

[02:05] I think it's a great time to be a buyer.

[02:07] I think it's a hard time to be a manufacturer with all of the different games coming out.

[02:12] I think, and we're going to go in that in a later episode.

[02:15] But this episode, episode one on, when a one, is going to be a special one because I

[02:20] feel like this is like the ultimate one to punch on this whole podcast.

[02:24] I had the pleasure of sitting down with the man who inspired me to do this podcast.

[02:30] The man who I still think has the greatest pinball podcast on the planet.

[02:36] And that is Nate Chivers of Coast to Coast pinball.

[02:40] You cannot mention pinball podcasts without having Nate at the top of your list.

[02:45] There's a reason why pinball podcast, his pinball podcast, excuse me, is the number one

[02:50] pinball podcast that comes up when you search for pinball podcasts on iTunes.

[02:55] Nate is just incredible.

[02:57] He is incredible.

[02:58] I can't tell you how many nights I would spend listening to his podcast before bed, loving

[03:04] his commentary on pinball.

[03:06] And the greatest accolade I can receive, and the greatest feedback I can get from people

[03:12] out there is you have taken some of the pain away from losing Coast to Coast pinball,

[03:19] and I love the Canadian pinball podcast because it provides that commentary that we're missing

[03:25] on a weekly basis that Nate provided.

[03:27] So I'm happy that I can do that.

[03:29] I don't think I'll ever get to the same level of Nate.

[03:33] There's just something special that he brings, and I love his podcast.

[03:38] So I'm happy to hear that he's going to be doing it on a monthly basis, and I was extremely

[03:43] happy for Nate to join the show.

[03:45] I had been reaching out to Nate for a while to join and be a member of the show, so I was

[03:51] ecstatic that he is episode 101.

[03:54] And I'm really happy that a lot of you guys who are traveling to T-P-F and are going to

[03:59] have this podcast to go along with the George Gomez podcast on your way to the show because

[04:04] I know a lot of you guys will be listening to pinball podcasts as you're journeying to

[04:08] Texas.

[04:09] So without further ado, I want to air Nate Schivers, and it's just so good to hear him

[04:16] back on the airwaves talking about pinball, and we look forward to seeing what he's going

[04:20] to do in the future with his podcast.

[04:22] And he's always got an open door to come on this show.

[04:25] He ever just feels like jumping on and talking about pinball without having to do any show

[04:30] notes.

[04:31] And I'll keep him updated on what's been going on.

[04:35] That Nate Schivers, Canatus Pinball podcast 101, I hope you enjoy, and I look forward

[04:40] to hanging out with a lot of you awesome guys at T-P-F in a few days.

[04:45] Much love guys, much love.

[04:46] It's a good time to be in pinball.

[04:47] I'm really excited, very excited.

[04:50] Here you go.

[04:51] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to episode 101.

[04:55] I feel like this week has been sort of crazy.

[04:57] I've had like two guests that I've been trying to get on the show forever, hit back to

[05:02] back.

[05:03] And this man is sort of the inspiration for this podcast that I do, and I spent probably

[05:11] a good year just listening to this man talk every time he had a new episode, I was just

[05:17] infactuated with it.

[05:18] And that is no other than Nate Schivers of Coast to Coast pinball.

[05:22] Nate, welcome to the show.

[05:24] I thought this was going to be episode 100, Chris.

[05:29] That makes two people pissed at me.

[05:30] And I was supposed to be episode 100, so I bummed her for George Gomez.

[05:35] But this is a fitting follow up.

[05:37] Now Nate, I know you just uploaded a new podcast.

[05:41] I think it was number 236, was it?

[05:44] Yeah, that was an update episode, as it might be, 232-30-something.

[05:49] I don't even know.

[05:50] I have to look at 232.

[05:51] Okay.

[05:52] Now, before we get started, I just want to be a little bit of a fanboy and just thank

[05:56] you for Coast to Coast pinball.

[05:59] Because I think without a doubt, Coast to Coast pinball is held up as the gold standard

[06:05] in pinball podcasts.

[06:06] And I think what you brought Nate to the podcast was just this great commentary and point

[06:12] of view on pinball that never really existed.

[06:15] So I think all of my listeners would agree that they love Coast to Coast.

[06:21] I love Coast to Coast.

[06:22] And we're glad that it's going to come back in some format in the near future.

[06:27] Thanks, man.

[06:28] That's super flattering.

[06:29] All totally correct as well.

[06:31] I'm just kidding.

[06:32] Yeah, it's been a weird trip.

[06:34] It was started out pretty modest.

[06:36] I actually had a text message this morning from someone who said, hey, I'm listening to

[06:41] episode 16 and you're talking about New York City blah, blah.

[06:45] And I cringe thinking about what those early shows probably sound like now.

[06:50] Because it's certainly come a long way.

[06:53] As I talked about in my last episode, it's been a personally and professionally a weird

[06:57] ride the last few months.

[06:58] So the show's taken a back seat.

[07:00] But it will live.

[07:01] I think it's too important to me personally to let it die.

[07:06] I'm sure you've had this year over 100 episodes.

[07:09] Congratulations.

[07:10] I think anybody that can do that, that many shows definitely has their heart and into it.

[07:17] And you'll find, and I'm sure you've had this moment where you hit a wall and you start

[07:23] thinking, okay, what am I actually doing this for?

[07:26] What are the reasons?

[07:27] And I've had that a few times and luckily I always come back to, I'm sitting here thinking

[07:32] about pinball.

[07:33] I might as well talk about it and reach out to my little group of listeners out there.

[07:38] It's a creative output for me, certainly.

[07:41] It's been awesome.

[07:43] I hit two walls when I was doing it.

[07:46] And both of them were sort of self-inflicted gun wounds where I just got like two into the

[07:52] drama.

[07:53] And I'm sure you've heard some of it.

[07:54] I take a little bit more of a contentious approach at times.

[07:58] And I got burnt out.

[07:59] I mean, the first time I took a break was people were just basically threatening my employer.

[08:06] It was weird.

[08:07] It wasn't even any of the other drama with like, oric and stuff.

[08:10] It was some guy in RPG, who started posting like my HR director's email address and was

[08:17] like, let's take this guy down.

[08:18] Like, I'm going to ruin your life.

[08:19] And I was like, holy shit.

[08:21] I'm talking about pinball guys.

[08:24] So I took a break then and then I took a break last summer.

[08:27] The reason I took a break in the summer, you know, sometimes Nate, you look at the hobby

[08:31] and you're just like, man, I don't think there's going to be much news over the next few

[08:34] months.

[08:36] Do I really want to just stir the pot to create news and do you?

[08:41] Yeah, clearly.

[08:42] Yeah.

[08:43] Well, and I was like, I was just like manufacturing the news.

[08:46] There's almost like fake news.

[08:48] You know, I'm like, they're no little bit of like the Donald Trump error of pinball news

[08:51] for a while.

[08:52] And then I took a break and when I came back, I was like, you know what?

[08:55] I definitely want this show to be a lot more positive.

[08:58] I want to be able to ask hard questions though, but do it in the right way.

[09:02] And I think finding that balance and we'll talk a little bit about that on this episode

[09:05] finding that balance of asking hard questions without being a jerk is difficult.

[09:11] Question for you.

[09:13] Yeah.

[09:14] How badly would you like to be unbanned from pinsobs?

[09:18] You know, I've said this to Robin many times and the answer is this, I would love to

[09:23] be back on pinsobs and the reason why is, you know, it's hard for me to sort of enter

[09:31] the conversation the way I want to.

[09:34] And I'm basically having a conversation with myself on this podcast, right?

[09:38] And it gives me somewhat of an advantage because I can sort of say something and no one

[09:44] else can like take it down, right?

[09:46] They can't delete it.

[09:47] They can't thread eject me.

[09:49] And I think that's kind of what made my podcast more successful was being off pinsobs.

[09:55] Because people would be curious about what I would say in a medium that I could control.

[10:00] What do I talk about?

[10:01] How do you judge success with a pinsob podcast?

[10:04] No, that's a good question.

[10:06] I mean, I judge success by, you know, there's certain measurements that I go by.

[10:12] Obviously, you want to make sure you have a decent listener base.

[10:15] So I think I have a decent listener base considering the size of the hobby.

[10:19] But also for me personally, I get success from the different emails and the different people

[10:25] that just hit me up and say, you know, I love the show.

[10:27] I listen to it every day and the way to work.

[10:30] When I meet these people at shows that they tell me how much they enjoy the podcast.

[10:35] So for me, I mean, we don't do this for money.

[10:37] You know, I do it so that it's entertainment for people that are out there.

[10:42] And look, and you said it before too, a little bit, maybe more than a little bit is a little

[10:48] ego driven, right?

[10:49] Like we do this because I like to hear myself talk about pinball.

[10:53] It's fun to put something out there that you can create.

[10:57] That is solely yours.

[10:59] So a little bit of is attention driven.

[11:01] I won't lie, you know, it's not just all about adding value.

[11:05] But I think I've found that balance of adding entertainment, adding value and talking about

[11:11] pinball in a way that is digestible because I think my biggest complaint about some of

[11:17] the other podcasts is they're just too long, you know, like two hours.

[11:21] It's just too much.

[11:22] I felt that from the very beginning that the super long format was a not sustainable

[11:29] for me.

[11:30] And I was trying to make a podcast I would listen to.

[11:33] I mean, that was always I tried to not think about, okay, what's everybody going to like

[11:38] right now?

[11:39] It was more what would I want to hear?

[11:42] Because I literally started the show when we had Don and Jeff doing a monthly show.

[11:47] We had our game room junkies doing monthly-ish shows with a heavy focus on pinball.

[11:56] And we had spooky pinball doing a monthly show.

[11:58] And there was not much else at all.

[12:01] And I was burning through those shows literally, you know, in three days and going through

[12:04] the rest of the month wishing there was more talk about pinball.

[12:06] So I thought, well, if it's if I'm doing that, somebody else probably is thinking that

[12:09] too.

[12:10] So I really thought that in the long shows, I can't do that because I won't listen to

[12:15] it.

[12:16] And why do it if nobody's listening?

[12:18] Right.

[12:19] Right.

[12:20] Yeah.

[12:21] And I have to say, I mean, your format is what I emulated because I just thought that 30

[12:27] minutes to an hour, like when an hour when you have an interview and you have a little

[12:31] bit more to go in depth about was the perfect amount of time.

[12:36] And, and you know, and we were, you mentioned this on your last podcast, Nate.

[12:40] It's just like finding the time too, right?

[12:42] Because I know you're really busy with your new job.

[12:45] You were saying how like when your schedule is flexible, it's easier to throw on the headset

[12:50] and put up a podcast.

[12:51] But I think what's probably hard for you now, right?

[12:53] Because it's you have to mine the forums to get the information to do the shows.

[13:00] And that's to me where all the time comes, right?

[13:02] Because it's easy for me to just talk for a half hour, but it's the hours of mining

[13:07] the forums to get the subjects and the and the details down that takes time.

[13:13] And if you know you're right, because if you look at when I started the show, you could

[13:18] keep up with Pinside by logging on for a half hour a day and you could pretty much see

[13:23] everything.

[13:24] Right.

[13:25] There's so many users now and there's so much going on in the quote hobby or the world

[13:29] of pinball.

[13:30] It's really hard to keep up with it.

[13:32] I've had trouble keeping up with it recently.

[13:35] And that is the long, the recording of the show, I would often times if I had something

[13:40] I really want to talk about, put the headset on and just go and look down and it had been

[13:44] 45 minutes.

[13:46] The hard ones were when I was really trying to dive deep into pinball machines and like

[13:50] talk about games that I didn't own and I had to research and do work on.

[13:53] Or if I was like the worst ones is when you're trying to do like a recap of like a year or

[13:59] the notes you have to take to put it together.

[14:02] And I think that's where a lot of people, not just in pinball, but in podcasting in general,

[14:06] they think, oh, I love talking about, you know, I don't know, boomerangs.

[14:11] So I'm going to do a podcast about boomerangs because boomerangs are awesome.

[14:15] And they talk about boomerangs for a couple shows and three shows in.

[14:18] They're kind of like, well, what do we talk about today?

[14:21] And there's not what do you even do?

[14:23] You got to actually work to have a show and that's the hard part.

[14:25] So I am impressed that you've gotten as far as you can.

[14:29] I find it amusing on lots of levels.

[14:33] And I still see 90 some episodes in you referring to the Pinside Babies.

[14:37] I think that's a certain kind of special there, which is your own brand of podcast.

[14:44] Right.

[14:45] I mean, there's like, and that's a thing.

[14:46] It's like I am when I came out of the gates, it was I was definitely sort of the polarizing

[14:53] figure.

[14:54] And I sort of leverage that.

[14:55] But I think over time, even like my Pinside Babies podcast have become a lot more PG and

[15:01] PG 13 versus, you know, some of vitriolic rant.

[15:06] And what I've learned too is when you're, when you get too involved and you get too angry,

[15:12] it just eats away at you personally.

[15:14] Like I wasn't accomplishing anything, right?

[15:16] I've adopted this new mindset.

[15:19] If people have money in on games, that's on them, right?

[15:23] I mean, they can invest with whoever they want to invest with.

[15:25] I can ask the hard questions, but I don't need to go on these personal sort of missions

[15:33] to expose manufacturers because most of the information is out there.

[15:38] It's public.

[15:40] And people, I still think people are so emotionally connected to pinball, Nate, that it doesn't

[15:45] matter what information you give them.

[15:48] They're going to, they're going to say, take my money now if the theme is something they

[15:52] love.

[15:53] And that's just the nature of this hobby.

[15:54] Well, and I think that's really the collector side of it.

[15:58] It's interesting when I look at the hobby and I've sort of straddle different sides of

[16:03] it at different times.

[16:04] I'm, you know, one part collector.

[16:06] I'm never going to be the guy who buys $15,000 or super limited edition games.

[16:11] It's just not, it's just not interesting to me and it just doesn't excite me.

[16:16] I'll never be the guy who goes to 15 pop of circuit events and plays that much competitive

[16:21] pinball.

[16:22] But I do love competitive pinball on some level.

[16:24] So I like a little bit of collecting.

[16:25] I like some competitive pinball.

[16:26] I think that, you know, there's the whole side of the business side of it, which is really

[16:31] interesting to me.

[16:32] And I got right up against it and nearly went to work for Stern.

[16:36] And that was probably the moment where I really had to step back at times and think, okay,

[16:41] even when Stern's making a pretty glaring error to a lot of people, there's usually a

[16:46] reason that was well thought out by good people, why they're making that quote error or why

[16:50] business is just making that happen.

[16:54] And it tears you in all these different directions.

[16:56] But I think all those little sections of pinball, whether it's people who just really are

[17:00] attached to it via pinside or forums or people who just really love the hunt of finding

[17:05] games and buying games or the operators out there who this is actually a business and

[17:09] a livelihood to or the competitors, the guys who could care less about going to a festival

[17:14] and playing a bunch of free play, you know, 80s and 90s games, they want to stand in line

[17:18] at the tournament for three days straight.

[17:20] All those different things, that's what pinball is to all those people.

[17:23] And it's great.

[17:25] If pinball wouldn't be in a resurgence, I think if you didn't have all of those pieces

[17:29] put together.

[17:30] Right.

[17:31] And I totally agree.

[17:32] And I think Nate, what was interesting about your podcast is you reached that point too,

[17:37] where you sort of, you got into competitive pinball and you sort of created a separate

[17:43] sort of discussion around tournament talk because talk a little bit about that because

[17:47] I know a lot of people and I loved your show.

[17:49] And I didn't, I listened every episode.

[17:50] Like even though, you know, tournament talked and bothered me that much, I don't talk about

[17:55] it on this podcast per se because I do think tournament play and teaching people pinball

[17:59] is a, it's a better visual, like visual journey versus an audio one.

[18:03] And I know you started putting up YouTube videos with some of the pros, but talk about

[18:07] how you reach that point where you realize, you know, there's two major different parts

[18:12] of pinball I want to discuss and it makes sense to sort of break them up a little bit

[18:15] because the audiences might be a little different.

[18:17] Yeah, the breaking of them up was really because I thought I was about to go to work at

[18:21] Stern and I knew I couldn't do coast to coast pinball anymore if I worked for the largest

[18:27] manufacturers of games in the world because it wouldn't be, you couldn't, you know,

[18:31] you can't ask me that.

[18:32] He literally said, what are you going to do with your podcast?

[18:33] And I said, well, I'm going to shut it down because how could I give my opinions on

[18:39] other manufacturers while I work for their competitive, it just doesn't make any sense.

[18:42] But I still wanted to talk about pinball.

[18:45] So my plan was eventually with Stern's blessing, of course, was to do a Stern pinball podcast

[18:50] based on the inside workings at Stern, which I still think could be really cool.

[18:54] And then I separated out wide world of pinball with two of my, you know, I don't get to

[19:00] see these guys very often, but I feel like they're two of my best friends in the world

[19:04] through pinball, Josh Sharp and Steve Bowden because they're both really, really intelligent

[19:09] guys who have very interesting opinions from different points of view on just not just

[19:14] pinball, but really specifically competitive pinball.

[19:17] And I had gotten really into the big tournaments.

[19:19] It was really exciting.

[19:20] I was spending Sunday afternoons watching finals of tournaments that were half a world

[19:25] away.

[19:26] And I, it's a geeky, geeky thing to do, but I know other people liked it.

[19:31] So I always was doing some of that as I got into it and splitting it off made perfect

[19:35] sense if I was going to be working at Stern.

[19:37] Now, now that I'm not, I could just fold it all back in, but I kind of like the setup

[19:41] of the three-man team.

[19:43] It's an easier show to do because I just have to have some bullet points and Josh and

[19:47] Steve can fill 45 minutes pretty easily amongst themselves by just throughout topics.

[19:51] So I actually really want to do more of that.

[19:53] The time change now is really making that difficult because I'm six hours ahead of you guys

[19:57] on the East Coast and seven hours ahead of Chicago.

[19:59] Right.

[20:00] So it's a little more difficult to do, but I love competitive pinball.

[20:03] I think it's incredibly fun.

[20:06] I found myself at certain big, big shows that had tournaments ignoring all the new releases

[20:12] and all the new business and all the new stuff that was happening.

[20:14] It just hanging out and playing in the tournament and really enjoying it.

[20:17] But I've also done the opposite.

[20:19] I believe I was at Papa.

[20:22] It was Papa and a buddy of mine and a couple of friends of mine.

[20:27] We literally just ignored the tournament for probably two days and just walked around

[20:30] and played games.

[20:31] Just heads up three person games against each other.

[20:34] So I can see both sides and I think that my podcast sort of just swings whichever way

[20:39] my interests do.

[20:41] I remember seeing you Nate at a T.P.F. last year with Jack Danger.

[20:45] You guys were doing the tournament commentary.

[20:49] We went to dinner.

[20:50] We came back like hours later.

[20:51] You guys are still there.

[20:54] You guys did look a little tired.

[20:55] I'm like, it is a lot of hours that you have to dedicate to the tournaments when you go

[21:00] to these shows.

[21:02] I think it's hard to for fans to decide which road to take.

[21:06] If you're in the tournament, you're in it.

[21:09] There's a lot of stuff you're going to miss because you're playing.

[21:13] It's a good problem to have.

[21:15] Something you mentioned though Nate is interesting.

[21:16] I think a Stern podcast would be great.

[21:19] Here's why.

[21:21] Stern having 92% of the market but being pretty absent from the dialogue, I think hurts

[21:28] them.

[21:29] Interview I did with George last week.

[21:32] He clarified a lot of things that put a lot of people's mind at ease but that information,

[21:37] it just doesn't get out there.

[21:40] I think it would help people to relax a little bit when it comes to Stern Pimball.

[21:45] If they had a little bit more of an inside or a transpired relationship with the company.

[21:50] I agree.

[21:51] When I've had Joe to your George or anyone else from the company on, I certainly get

[21:55] that feedback that people are thrilled to hear it from the company themselves.

[22:00] I think I sort of had that going.

[22:02] I definitely had that ability to, you know, new game release, I'd get them on and I might

[22:07] have ruined that when I kind of made fun of the super elite.

[22:12] I remember that.

[22:13] I think George is still sensitive about that.

[22:16] I kind of brought it up a little bit.

[22:19] I get that.

[22:20] Look, George Gomez, I don't care.

[22:22] Anybody says about anything about Stern.

[22:23] George Gomez is one of the nicest people I've met.

[22:27] When I met him and interviewed with him at the company, that's the moment I knew I really

[22:31] wanted to move to Chicago.

[22:32] It was actually interviewing George Gomez.

[22:36] What a great guy.

[22:37] I felt bad afterwards.

[22:39] Such a nice guy probably took what I was saying very personally.

[22:42] I just was, I thought that they were doing so many things right in that moment and so

[22:47] many good things.

[22:48] The super elite thing was just sort of mishandled and not how I would have hoped to have seen

[22:54] it.

[22:55] It happened.

[22:56] I might have been a little sensitive to the fact that I was getting a lot of accusations

[23:00] on being soft on Stern at the time because you were going to work for them.

[23:06] You can't talk about Stern blah, blah, blah.

[23:08] When I saw something that did bother me, I probably laid into it a little heavy and I did

[23:13] tell, you know, Jody at one point, I was sorry that it came off so hard.

[23:18] I'm not sorry for the criticism.

[23:19] I stand behind the criticism.

[23:20] I still think it was a bad way to do about it.

[23:23] But I certainly don't mean any harm.

[23:26] I think Stern does a whole lot more right than they do wrong.

[23:30] Once you see the people working there, you realize it's not a bunch of guys counting

[23:34] their money and getting rich on pinball and laughing at all the suckers paying $12,000

[23:39] for elite games or whatever.

[23:41] It's people who really love pinball and have chosen to work.

[23:44] There's a lot of the people in that company could go make a lot more money doing other things.

[23:48] What they want to work in pinball and thankfully they do.

[23:52] I have nothing but love for them.

[23:56] I love Stern too.

[23:58] I at least tell people, like, well, would you rather live in a world where there is no

[24:03] Stern pinball and there is no new pinball coming out?

[24:07] This whole notion that Stern doesn't care is so fabricated by a vocal minority of people

[24:12] who might have an issue here or there.

[24:14] I think that's where the forums, you know, I almost wanted to send Robin an email,

[24:18] basically saying, I think now is a good time to try and build bridges to getting Stern

[24:24] and Jack back on pinside because it would require a little bit more moderation where you

[24:29] don't let a few of these vocal minority guys run away.

[24:34] The true people who are making pinball.

[24:36] I mean, how do you have the most popular pinball forum and you don't have the major companies

[24:40] participating simply because you'd rather build a safe haven for a few trolls who just

[24:45] want to tell Stern to f off every chance they get.

[24:47] You know, I don't get it.

[24:49] I got to tell you, you know, in my world of acoustic guitars, the owner, one of the two

[24:53] owners of our company, whose names on the headstock of all our guitars, Bob Taylor.

[24:57] If you search back into, there's a website called the acoustic guitar forum, which for

[25:01] all intents and purposes is the pinside of acoustic guitars.

[25:06] If you look back 12, 13, 14 years ago, Bob Taylor's all over these forums, himself,

[25:10] the owner of a, you know, at the time probably a $40, $50 million company and it's double

[25:15] that now.

[25:17] He's on there arguing with people about stuff, trying to teach them, trying to show them

[25:20] the way what he's doing.

[25:22] And he eventually had to leave because people make a game and a sport out of, you know,

[25:28] I hate the word trolling, but that's kind of what it is trolling or just arguing or trying

[25:31] to show how smart they are or trying to play counterpoint to everything that somebody

[25:36] who's an expert says and you get torn apart.

[25:38] It's just the nature of the internet.

[25:39] That is the internet.

[25:40] So I, if I'm at, like if I'd gone to work for Stern and was sitting there as director

[25:46] of sales at Stern pinball, I wouldn't be on pinside either.

[25:49] I wouldn't waste my time.

[25:50] There's way too many good things because the reality is, I love pinside for what it is.

[25:56] It's a great group thing.

[25:57] It's a great place for information to learn about things, to hang out with your quote

[26:02] pinball friends, but there's not that many people on it.

[26:05] It's not that big in the grand scheme of things.

[26:07] And if Stern's business was based off making pinside happy, they would be long, long out

[26:11] of business.

[26:12] Now it's a good point.

[26:13] I think the happy medium might be just allowing someone like Jarrett to go on there and just

[26:18] give information.

[26:19] So like when the dimple gate is happening, he can talk to George and they, because that

[26:24] response from George about dimples was great.

[26:26] It kind of like immediately silenced.

[26:29] A lot of these like new hobbyists, right?

[26:31] They don't, people who just don't get that like dimples are part of pinball and you want

[26:35] to, you want a nice clear code, it's going to dimple.

[26:38] Like that's just the way the, the kind of shocked people are still arguing about that.

[26:42] I mean, go to any arcade a week after a new game arrives and look at the play field.

[26:47] It's dimpled up that that's, that's the side of the collector world that surprises

[26:53] me that people still would think dimples aren't our reality.

[26:56] Well, mate, in the last like year, there's been so much that's happened in pinball

[27:01] and in particular, since, I believe like your last podcast is around December, lots

[27:07] happened since December to now and something I wanted to talk about in this podcast, sort

[27:12] of just go down your thoughts on, on the hobby.

[27:16] And as we think about pinball and the state of pinball, and we talk a lot about the resurgence

[27:22] and this new golden error, but I want to go down a list, Nate.

[27:26] And like, I know you don't have any pins right now where you're living.

[27:29] Are you planning to maybe get any, can you get some pins over there?

[27:33] Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.

[27:34] They, in fact, the prices in the Netherlands are actually, even with conversion rate to

[27:40] euros, it's cheaper to buy a lot of games here than it is in the United States.

[27:43] Certainly, then Southern California.

[27:45] So when Theresa and I move to our permanent residents in the next few months, there will

[27:50] be pinball for sure.

[27:51] Okay.

[27:51] So if I gave you Nate, like a coupon redeemable for a pinball machine, we're not even

[27:57] going to put a price on it.

[27:59] This is a list.

[28:00] When people talk about pinball's resurgence, this is a list of games you can go get new

[28:05] in box in the next, you can get some of them immediately, but all of these will be available

[28:10] in the next month or two.

[28:12] Erosmith, let's count Batman 66, Ghostbusters, Kiss, Spider-Man Vault Edition, WWE.

[28:20] I don't, you know, who wants that?

[28:22] Game of Thrones.

[28:23] John Cena wants that.

[28:25] Woe Nelly, The Walking Dead, Metallica, Alien, P3 Multimorphic, Hobbit, Wizard of

[28:32] Oz, Dildin, Attack from Mars Remake, Magic Girl, they're in box, they're available.

[28:38] Stop it, stop it.

[28:39] It's Audie Bay.

[28:40] Stop it.

[28:41] It's a big Lebowski, Rob Zombie, Jetsons, Domino's, Captain Nemo.

[28:47] Okay.

[28:48] So real?

[28:49] Can you buy a Captain Nemo?

[28:51] I mean, I'm sure if you wait some money around, it's shipping now.

[28:54] Please make it more of them.

[28:58] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,

[29:03] fifteen, five.

[29:04] Don't count, Magic Girl, please don't.

[29:05] Alright, I'll take Magic Girl, that's like 18 pinball machines.

[29:09] Okay.

[29:10] Now, what are your thoughts on just that?

[29:13] Like the market is so crowded now.

[29:15] It's awesome, it's fantastic.

[29:17] It's great that the market can support it to, you know, if it is supporting it.

[29:21] I mean, some of those, you know, I look at something like P3 and Jerry is, man, you

[29:27] talk about people who are like throwing all their, their effort and time and energy into

[29:32] the hobby.

[29:33] I mean, Jerry at P3 is just unbelievable.

[29:36] But that, that is a tough sell.

[29:38] That's a tough thing because I still question, is it pinball enough?

[29:41] Right.

[29:42] So I look at that and it's like, is the market ever going to support that?

[29:45] I don't know.

[29:46] I think they're doing a lot of the right things, trying to branch out beyond just the,

[29:50] the standard home buyer for pinball machine, doing some other type of games on that.

[29:54] It's smart.

[29:55] You know, if you gave me a coupon and said I can have any game, I would really like to

[29:59] play Dildin.

[30:01] I have not spent any time at all in Dildin, but a few people who I really respect their

[30:05] opinions on have told me it's one of their favorite games ever.

[30:10] So I've heard that thrown around a little bit, so I need to play it.

[30:13] I would not buy Wizard of Oz or Hobbit just because I don't really, I don't want a

[30:18] wide-body game, a modern wide-body game in a collection that's going to be just a couple

[30:22] games right now.

[30:23] It's not, it doesn't feel quite right to me, even though Teresa absolutely loved the Hobbit.

[30:28] The Hobbit was her favorite game we played last year by a long ways.

[30:32] She was in doing it.

[30:33] She's going to love Dildin.

[30:34] I mean, when Brenda played Dildin, it, it, it's like everything you love about a Jersey

[30:38] Jack game, but even better.

[30:40] It's faster, the shots are smoother.

[30:42] And it's just fun.

[30:43] The use of technology and at the selfie mode, the way you can play with your, your cell

[30:46] phone.

[30:47] I, Dildin is my pick for Game of the Year.

[30:50] And you know, I'm interested to see if the gameplay, the, the unique toys and, and technology

[30:58] interfaces.

[30:59] I'm, I'm interested if those things can overcome the fact that I have to explain what on Earth

[31:04] Dildin is and what it means to anybody I talk to about it because that theme still, I,

[31:10] and I got a lot of heat for this when I kind of slammed it in October.

[31:13] I still don't think that theme's very good.

[31:15] Right.

[31:16] I don't get it.

[31:17] I still, I mean, I get it, but I don't, I don't get why that.

[31:21] Well, it doesn't, it doesn't can note what the game is about, which is saving the city.

[31:26] Right.

[31:27] It's this, it's a disaster game.

[31:28] It's kind of like all of Pat's sort of disaster games in one and, but Dildin is like this

[31:33] pinball term.

[31:34] It doesn't.

[31:36] And then there's like the cell phone and now they're saying like the cell phone's not going

[31:39] to be the focal point like it was earlier on in the code.

[31:42] So I agree.

[31:43] We need a comic book to explain to people what the pinball machine is about.

[31:48] That's, that's a little too much.

[31:50] Yeah.

[31:51] I had a problem with that.

[31:52] So I'd really like to play Dildin.

[31:53] So that would kind of go on my short list.

[31:55] You know, alien again, I don't really want a wide body game.

[31:58] I will say about alien though.

[31:59] I think that a lot of people probably should go back and apologize to Eric, Eric Lawson

[32:05] because when you see the final product of alien, the artwork makes perfect sense and fits

[32:10] that game perfectly.

[32:11] And I think a lot of people said a lot of stuff about that artwork.

[32:14] And in the end of the day, what seemed like a defensive position from him during the criticism

[32:19] of, hey man, like there's a lot of stuff on this game and I had to just sort of go around

[32:23] it.

[32:24] He's right.

[32:25] He ends up being completely right when I was looking at the streams of the gameplay of

[32:27] that video of alien.

[32:30] It looks fantastic.

[32:31] I think it's a great looking game.

[32:32] Yeah.

[32:33] I think that I think what's, I think what that whole thing showed was, it's hard to get

[32:39] people excited about pinball when you, when you launch it piece by piece.

[32:44] Quit showing pieces of games.

[32:47] I agree completely.

[32:48] Right.

[32:49] Jack just held up the dialed in play field.

[32:51] I guess some of them came in.

[32:53] And if you just look at the play field, it's not that special.

[32:57] It doesn't look that good.

[32:58] People would have torn it apart.

[33:00] But when you put the mechanisms on top of it, it makes absolute sense why the art is

[33:06] the way it is.

[33:08] So look, I think that, I think marketing in general, all these companies that released

[33:13] things way too early by the time it's all together, the hype is kind of past.

[33:20] It always boggles my mind that these companies can't follow the spooky and stern formula, which

[33:24] is you completely design your game first.

[33:28] Then you set the price when you know how much the bomb is.

[33:31] Then you announce it.

[33:32] With the price, that will keep your company in business.

[33:35] It's hard.

[33:37] It's tough because you're dealing with some companies aren't really companies.

[33:41] They're really just enthusiasts who have the skill and the willpower to put a game together.

[33:47] And they can't help themselves because you work.

[33:51] It's really hard.

[33:52] I mean, can you imagine trying to record 100 podcasts before you released any of them?

[33:56] Wouldn't at some point you just be dying to throw podcasts out there so somebody could

[33:59] recognize all this hard work you've done?

[34:02] I think that that's part of it, especially someone like highway who, big investment, a lot

[34:06] of smart people, a lot of hard work.

[34:10] The first game was sort of, he changed the theme at one point, goes to full throttle.

[34:15] I don't think it's sold like they hoped it would.

[34:17] Then he's got this triple A license in alien.

[34:20] He kind of pulls the coup and gets alien.

[34:23] He wants to show it.

[34:24] He wants to get people interested in trying to get their mind share and their wallet share

[34:28] headed towards them.

[34:29] I understand it, but man, I don't think it did anybody any good to see that play field

[34:34] with nothing on it.

[34:35] I want to see like bare play fields of like, you know, I don't know, Paragon or Centaur

[34:41] later after I've known the game my whole life and I can just see what the bare play field

[34:44] looks.

[34:45] That's interesting.

[34:46] I don't want to see the next game that I've never played before.

[34:48] Bear, I want to see the complete project.

[34:50] Right.

[34:51] And, you know, I think it's pretty obvious why a lot of these companies, to your point,

[34:54] have to do it when they're sort of start up companies is they need money.

[35:00] They need to get pre-order dollars in and they're trying to get people excited early

[35:03] on to, you know, as we go down this list, too, Nate, it's like, man, at some point, people

[35:09] only have so many areas they can spend their money in.

[35:13] And if I don't get people excited about alien, you know, I think it's going to be real.

[35:18] I think it's going to be hard for highway.

[35:19] I think the big thing that kind of sucks is if a tack from Mars remade, you know, if

[35:24] you're going to make a mistake.

[35:25] Because what I heard is this, I heard that PPS has spent a year stockpiling part.

[35:29] So when they announce a tack from Mars at TPS, they're also going to announce that production

[35:34] is happening immediately.

[35:35] I mean, that's what I understand, you know, and I think their price point, I don't know

[35:40] if that's been made public yet and I hope I'm not spawning to anybody, but I think their

[35:43] price points are going to sell a lot of games on its own.

[35:47] I think it's 65, 75 and 8500.

[35:51] That's the rumors I've heard.

[35:52] I don't have any confirmation to that, but that's the rumors I heard.

[35:54] So if you're telling me there's a brand new, pretty shiny attack from Mars out there

[35:58] for 6500, it's going to sell a lot of games.

[36:01] They will do very well with that.

[36:03] So that's going to be interesting to watch.

[36:05] And honestly, that might be the game I have to buy just because that's Teresa's favorite

[36:08] game.

[36:10] But just to kind of wrap up what you said about all these new games here and what would

[36:14] I buy, I would probably me kind of being off the new and box game thing right now, I would

[36:20] probably try and find a used the walking dead or possibly game of thrones because I really

[36:25] like both of those games and I'd like to spend a good year just playing them into the

[36:30] ground and then flip them at some point.

[36:32] If I'm buying brand new and box, I'm probably looking at Erosmith.

[36:35] I think everything I've seen out of Erosmith looks really fun, really cool or maybe dialed

[36:39] in.

[36:40] I need to play it.

[36:41] Big Lebowski, I still, I need to kind of get back in tune with what's going on with

[36:46] Dutch pinball into Big Lebowski.

[36:48] So I have an exclusive announcement to make on this podcast about Dutch pinball.

[36:55] So well, before I make it, let me, so Nate, what's been going on is they've had a dispute

[37:01] with their contract manufacturer, ARA.

[37:05] The word on the street is that ARA has like 40 games built that they're holding hostage

[37:09] until they get payment.

[37:13] So what I hear is this and I would love to get your thoughts on this marketing strategy.

[37:19] So is it, is it Yop or Job?

[37:21] How do you pronounce his name?

[37:22] Yop.

[37:23] Yop.

[37:24] Yop is coming to TPF for a Saturday 3pm seminar to announce Dutch pinball game number

[37:32] two.

[37:34] Okay.

[37:35] In the midst of this Big Lebowski issue and I mean, I hope he also is going to announce

[37:43] they've found a solution to the Lebowski owners and I, the rumor title he's going to announce

[37:50] is back to the future, which I think people are going to be like, what a minute, what

[37:54] about our Lebowski and then take my money for back to the future immediately.

[37:58] So what are your thoughts on announcing game two when you still got game one, bro, you

[38:02] know, in health hostage and you don't have a manufacturer lined up and it's, it's a nightmare

[38:07] for those owners.

[38:09] You know, I haven't spoken to Barry Yop and quite a while so I don't know where their

[38:13] headspace is at on that, but I do know that they're both really smart guys and I would

[38:17] be surprised if there isn't some sort of plan on those Big Lebowski games in place.

[38:24] I think that it kind of circles back to what we were saying, you know, this, this was a,

[38:30] a big project for these guys.

[38:31] I mean, you could see the photography over the years of all the work that went into that

[38:36] and all the design and development R&D into the Big Lebowski.

[38:40] So they've got a lot of money sunk into this project.

[38:42] So they were talking about game number two, all the way back into Phil days when Phil

[38:47] was still there.

[38:48] I had dinner with Phil three years ago and Phil floated me five titles and said, what,

[38:52] what do we do?

[38:53] Which one would you do?

[38:55] And I don't think any of them were back to the future at the time, but I think that if

[38:58] that is where they're going, I think that's a fantastic move.

[39:00] I think that's probably one of the best 80s licenses you could, you could pull from right

[39:05] now.

[39:06] So I'd be very interested to see.

[39:08] And it wouldn't surprise me at all if they're announcing it.

[39:10] They're probably already already well into the development of it.

[39:12] So that's not going to be the cleanest thing ever to say, hey, here's game two.

[39:16] We haven't shipped all of game one yet, but it wouldn't surprise me at all.

[39:20] Yeah.

[39:21] It's, I really hope there's a good solution for Lebowski because I know a bunch of people,

[39:28] especially Mr. Rare here, Greg, Greg over there on Pinside, who's these guys who like,

[39:33] they know their games built and they just can't get it and they've been waiting two years.

[39:37] So I think the two year wait, right, this whole sort of preorder and then fingers crossed

[39:45] waiting years, I think that model is going to die soon.

[39:50] I mean, I say that, but I think theme and emotion overrides people's better judgment.

[39:58] What are your thoughts, Nate?

[39:59] Do you think like companies can still take preorder dollars?

[40:03] You know, if American Pimball asks for preorder money on Houdini, do you think they get any

[40:07] people putting money down or are people finally?

[40:10] I think the bar is being raised.

[40:13] I think certainly yes, you can get money on preorder.

[40:17] I didn't expect Stern to sell all those Batman's super limited editions and they did proving

[40:23] me, you know, wrong again on where the ceiling is for stuff like that.

[40:28] So yeah, I think so.

[40:29] If you put together a compelling enough sales pitch, you know, people in this industry,

[40:36] I think sometimes underestimate how easily a pinball fanatic and collector can be separated

[40:44] from their money.

[40:45] I want people want to spend money.

[40:48] People are dying to get something new and exciting to a degree.

[40:51] Now I think that bar goes up as we've seen, you know, real problems with J-pop and with

[40:56] the predator fiasco and all that.

[40:58] So I think there is definitely a hesitation built in now.

[41:02] But if you come out with a plan and can show how I'm going to build the game and it makes

[41:05] sense, sure, my worry of course is that somebody gets smart and brings in a name that everyone's

[41:11] familiar with and knows and then tries this and again, people don't realize how it hearted

[41:17] is to build a pinball machine and you end up even Chicago gaming with medieval madness.

[41:24] That's going to be the easiest thing in the world, right?

[41:25] We're going to have Stern build it simple.

[41:27] It wasn't simple at all.

[41:28] It was really hard.

[41:29] So I myself would never put money in again into something like way out into the future.

[41:37] But if you look at someone like spooky pinball, I trust them completely to build a game.

[41:42] If they announced something that I really wanted and it was going to be a six to eight month

[41:45] weight, I would have no problem sending Charlie, you know, a deposit on a game because I

[41:49] see the plan.

[41:50] But if American pinball, I don't know.

[41:53] Do I trust American pinball?

[41:54] Who is American pinball?

[41:55] Right.

[41:56] Now, based upon the magic girl that I'm looking at right now, I mean, yeah, like things

[42:01] were screwed together, but it came to work.

[42:04] How magic is it, Chris?

[42:06] How magic is it?

[42:07] On a scale of one to ten, it's like a three.

[42:10] Wow.

[42:11] And we'll talk a little bit about that in a second, but I think, you know, so there's

[42:17] a few games too.

[42:18] So on top of that list, coming soon, Star Wars.

[42:21] So this is like the worst kept secret in all pinball, but Star Wars is coming soon.

[42:26] And we're going to hear about it sooner than later.

[42:28] I was, it's going to, I think that's going to also just send a ripple effect through the

[42:34] hobby where like a lot of people's money might be in other projects and deposits might

[42:39] be down, but I think a lot of refund requests will come in when Star Wars gets announced.

[42:42] Do you think it's going to have that kind of effect?

[42:45] I'm assuming it is Star Wars.

[42:47] I have to be a little careful here.

[42:50] Assuming Star Wars is next from Stern.

[42:54] Yeah, I could see people pulling money out of something that they don't think they're

[42:58] going to see to go towards that.

[43:02] I don't know.

[43:03] I'm going to, I'm going to pass on that one.

[43:05] Okay.

[43:06] Elvira.

[43:07] So there's a new Elvira game that's also supposed to be coming out from Dennis Nordman.

[43:13] There's a reason why Elvira will be at TPS.

[43:15] It's not just to, to get the six-dural men all excited.

[43:19] It's, that's not it.

[43:20] She's not just there to show off.

[43:23] If she's, so they're going to complete the trilogy of Elvira games.

[43:26] And so that's, there's that.

[43:28] Then there's spooky number three, which is also Charlie's going to announce it.

[43:31] Originally, they weren't going to announce it, but he just put up yesterday.

[43:35] They're going to do a little like video documentary kind of thing.

[43:38] And at the end of it, they're going to reveal title number three.

[43:42] So yeah, they're, I think they're playing the documentary that's really fantastic from

[43:50] what I can't wait to see it about spooky pinball.

[43:54] It was kind of funny because when I was starting to really dive into doing some video work,

[43:58] I wanted to do a little thing on spooky.

[44:01] And Charlie got really weird.

[44:03] He goes, hold on, we got a talk and friends of Coast Coast pinball, Dana and Joel Reeves.

[44:10] Actually, we're working on a full-fledged documentary about a spooky pinball.

[44:15] Things that go bump in the night, I believe, is the official title.

[44:18] So I know I have a little bit of a piece in there and they interview a lot of people around

[44:23] how these, this family from Wisconsin jumped full on into the pinball industry.

[44:27] So I think they're showing that, which is cool.

[44:28] If you're going to TPS, definitely go check out the documentary.

[44:32] I'd love to hear some reviews.

[44:35] And very much looking forward to what the next spooky game is.

[44:38] It's been fun to watch that company grow and see things like Domino's come their way

[44:44] and the Jetsons come their way to get to build those.

[44:47] Because it's a real American success story so far up there.

[44:51] And I'm interested.

[44:53] I don't have any idea what it's going to be.

[44:55] So I like that because I'm a little spoiled because I know the next few Stern games and

[44:59] I can't talk about them.

[45:01] Come on.

[45:02] No.

[45:03] It's Star Wars, Nate.

[45:05] I have a DNA agreement.

[45:06] That's where Jody Dinkford sliced my finger open, sliced his finger open and we locked

[45:10] fingers and swapped DNA so I can't talk about it.

[45:14] But I don't know the spooky game.

[45:15] So that's exciting.

[45:16] It's fun when you actually don't know what it is.

[45:18] Yeah.

[45:19] They put a little teaser sort of picture and there's like a hand with a lightning bolt and

[45:24] people are speculating maybe it's Frankenstein.

[45:26] So we'll see.

[45:27] I don't have any idea what it is either.

[45:30] What about Home Pin, Thunderbirds over there in China?

[45:33] So that also Mike announced last night that he's aiming for second half of 2017 to get

[45:39] the first titles.

[45:41] They're building everything.

[45:42] I don't know if you've watched that thread, Nate, but like they're making the springs.

[45:45] They're making the screws like every single piece of the machine, they're manufacturing.

[45:50] Like nothing's coming from the normal pinball vendors.

[45:56] I can yeah, I think that that's an interesting thing and that's always been the thing to

[46:01] me that lurks out in the distance that could disrupt the, I think this blossoming American

[46:10] based sort of little bit of European UK based pinball explosion we've had as far as building

[46:16] games and selling games to consumers as if somebody was able to pull off a really high quality

[46:22] game in China and get the pricing down.

[46:26] It's not easy to do.

[46:27] I've worked for companies that built in China and it's really difficult.

[46:31] There's a lot of moving parts and you can quickly find yourself in a position where you're

[46:35] not saving a lot of money.

[46:38] I still have to question anytime somebody's working on their very first game.

[46:46] I question all of it every little bit about it until I see it, play it, feel it because

[46:51] I have played games by some companies that have built not their first game and they don't

[46:57] feel good.

[46:58] Feel wrong or the geometry is bad or they're just not something you'd want to buy and until

[47:03] I see something to prove me wrong on that I'm really skeptical on the home pin thing because

[47:08] he's been saying it's coming soon for two, three years now.

[47:13] Yeah, that's interesting.

[47:15] Whenever I see the stern factory tour and I marvel in the amount of people, the size

[47:22] of it, the scale of it and whenever I hear someone wants to replicate that with no

[47:27] experience and just like, wow, where do you begin?

[47:33] Stern is 30 years in the making and it's a well oiled machine and I just don't think

[47:39] anybody can really compete with them at that level.

[47:42] I think we're the market opportunities lie and we're seeing it with spooky.

[47:47] Is these boutique companies that can make three to five hundred game runs?

[47:51] Three thousand but good luck trying to get to the volume that Stern does without having

[48:00] that kind of resources and then that kind of backing.

[48:04] It'll take a long time before anybody I think can consistently get to two thousand games

[48:10] a year.

[48:11] It would take a long time.

[48:12] I think Jersey Jax had the best shot at it but even we've seen the delays that go into

[48:17] that.

[48:18] The most 100 games is one thing and I think spooky did it really sort of like the most

[48:24] grassroots way possible in a very clean, efficient way and look how quickly they had to go into

[48:28] a whole new big building when it was like, hey, we need to build more than 250 or 150

[48:33] games.

[48:34] Man, it takes a lot of infrastructure and a lot of people and a lot of investment.

[48:39] I think the best way to make a small fortune in pinball right now is to start with a large

[48:43] fortune in pinball probably.

[48:46] I agree and that's the question mark with highway because I think full throttle probably

[48:53] shipped about the same amount as spooky shipped of America's most haunted roughly around

[48:58] like 150 games went out and it's got to be like really hard.

[49:02] I think the problem they have now is you go from like 150 where you might get like 2,000

[49:07] orders for alien and you're like, shit, how do we now go make 2,000 games?

[49:14] So we'll see.

[49:15] I'll be shocked if they can do that volume.

[49:17] That's a pretty big number.

[49:19] I would expect them to be in that 7, 8, 900 range as far as pre-orders go and if I think

[49:24] it sells well, I mean I could be totally wrong.

[49:26] Andrew might be listening to this and think I'm an idiot but I'd be shocked if they get

[49:30] 2,000 sales.

[49:31] Yeah, I don't think they have 2,000 orders but I think during the lifespan of the game,

[49:36] I think for the for year one, they're definitely going to have to increase the volume right

[49:43] because alien demand is probably 10 times greater easily than full throttle.

[49:48] I hope over the next few months we see production ramp up because the buyers that over the next

[49:57] 2 to 3 months, I really do.

[49:58] I think if you're promised a game and you're expecting it within a certain time period,

[50:03] I think you have a small, the next 6 months are going to be critical for manufacturers

[50:08] to get people there games because I do think if I've been in on alien for 2 months, I

[50:13] have waited and it's still not shipping and it's still not going to be a star wars

[50:17] in 2 weeks or I'll give you dialed in and you can buy it right now from distributor and

[50:21] come pick it up.

[50:22] I think people's money is going to go where the boxes are.

[50:25] I think too, I still think there's a underestimation of the pinball market when I look at the price

[50:33] of what use games they're still selling for.

[50:36] If you have recent titles, whether it's ACDC or Metallica or something like Tron that

[50:44] are selling for 80% of their new price or 80% of the current new price of a pro machine,

[50:52] the demand is there and I think there's some smart people out there who know the industry

[50:57] enough that aren't currently working in pinball.

[50:59] If you have the ability to manufacture the game and you have somebody who can design the game,

[51:05] the code is there to be cracked.

[51:06] I think what trips up a lot of people is they get in their own idea of I know how to do

[51:11] it better than everybody else did and I'm not going to listen to these smart people who

[51:15] are telling me because I know of a couple projects that have gone on where really, really

[51:19] smart respected people in the pinball industry have talked to those builders and said, you

[51:25] really should think about doing like this and the builder goes, oh that's great but

[51:28] no, we're going to do it like this and that ends up being the 6 month delay right there

[51:32] because they just thought they knew better.

[51:34] Yeah and I think George too, he said when he, let's talk a little bit about magical because

[51:39] George, when he talked about how he would have approached it, there is a formula that works

[51:44] and I even think too, like a lot of times people are, they're anxious to sort of differentiate

[51:49] their company from what else is out there and that leads to those delays and that leads to the

[51:54] hiccup and it's like, you know, you understand marketing, it's like if consumers don't want it,

[52:00] don't force onto them, a big change that just you want to make because you personally want

[52:06] your company to stand out and it's like, is it necessary, right? Pinball as it is in its

[52:12] traditional sense, there's a huge demand for it. People haven't been asking for swappable

[52:17] playfields, they haven't been asking for different cabinet sizes, whenever people do that stuff,

[52:23] they make it harder on themselves and make it harder to get their game to market and the consumers

[52:27] don't even say they want it. Yeah, you know, it's funny, the swappable playfield thing to me,

[52:32] I think it's actually a great idea and I kind of got into this argument with Gary Stern when I was,

[52:37] you know, sort of talking with them, I think it's a brilliant idea and I think that somebody could

[52:42] do it properly and really cash in on it. I wouldn't, if I were highway, I would not have built wide

[52:48] body games. I think that's, to me, that's one of their kind of trip ups as far as selling the games.

[52:55] If I'm trying to enter the market, I want my game to look pretty much like a stirring game,

[53:01] but have some flashier things to it that separate me apart. I think if you had a narrow body version

[53:07] of Wizard of Oz, I think it would have done even better than the wide body, which was a success

[53:13] by a lot of standards, whereas it sold a lot of games on how much money it made in the end, but it's

[53:17] sold a lot of games. I would go narrow body, I would, you know, and this is just me thinking, I know

[53:21] everything better, but I certainly would try and look like a Stern, the proven marketplace winner,

[53:28] so that you don't get people uncomfortable, but have something better. And for a while, it's been

[53:31] the college screen, but now Stern has finally kind of caught up with everybody and I tell you,

[53:37] I look at that aerosmith game and that's a good looking game. For the 22, in Aerosmith Pro,

[53:44] is what, like $5,800 or $200? And it's gorgeous. It's less than almost everything else.

[53:53] Yeah, I think that, and from what I've been hearing from Stern is hand drawn art moving forward people.

[54:01] So they got that message. It took a while, but they got that message.

[54:04] And you're going to see it probably on Star Wars, you're going to see it on everything moving forward.

[54:08] So, you know, I think I keep saying like the giant woke up, like people kept poking Stern.

[54:14] And now they're going to give everybody what they want, but I agree. I don't really,

[54:18] I'm not a fan of wide bodies, so I'm looking at Magic Girl here. And it's like this kind of unique

[54:22] zidware cabinet. It does look like a Stern, but it has all that flash that you're talking about.

[54:29] Problem is the flash is, the flashy stuff doesn't really work. So let's talk a little bit about

[54:34] John, because I know Nate, I think it was like your most listened to and most successful podcast.

[54:40] Was your interview with John Papaduke right in the middle of sort of the zidware sort of collapse?

[54:48] And you sort of were able to get him on the horn to talk about it. And I think,

[54:54] and something, something that I've always felt, Nate, and I just want to let you know this is,

[54:57] I think you were unfairly criticized for not being like hard on John, because I think you

[55:03] asked him the tough questions. I think we could hear in your own voice, you're sort of

[55:08] disgust with some of his answers and frustration with him. But as someone who's also talked to John

[55:14] for hours, there's only so much you can beat a dead horse with John when you're actually talking

[55:20] him on the phone, because he just has this sort of ignorant childlike way of behaving and talking

[55:28] about his company that you just, you can't beat him up too bad. No, that's a good way to put it.

[55:36] You know, it was a tough situation and that is my most listened to show. It kind of bothers me

[55:42] on some level. But yeah, I think, I think last time I did all the math, because I try and keep track

[55:46] of the show downloads. I think that thing has over 24,000 downloads. Yeah, it's a mess, because

[55:55] I like John Papaduke as a guy to hang out and talk about geeky pinball stuff with. I really liked

[55:59] him. When I first met him, it was kind of a thrill. I was like, oh my gosh, this is a guy who worked in

[56:04] the business and made some cool games and everything. But the more I talked to him and the more times

[56:10] he, you know, canceled podcasts, because that took forever. I mean, that was not like something. Hey,

[56:14] John, you want to come on the show? Yeah, I'll come on the show. That took six months. I mean,

[56:18] that was a long time coming because anyone that's dealt with them knows he's eccentric and he's

[56:25] he changes his mind. He's got his own way of doing things. And I think he was really skittish that I

[56:30] would lay into him and I would just try and play gotcha with him. But, you know, whatever, I

[56:36] didn't I don't feel like on my show and I hope you don't. I don't think you do clearly. You

[56:41] don't owe anybody anything. I don't owe anybody out in the world some hard questioning line with

[56:46] John Papaduke. I was having a discussion at a very poignant time with him and we covered all the

[56:53] basics. He didn't answer a lot. But it's funny because I thought I was talking to this guy who

[57:00] had started a company with good intentions, had a good idea, got great feedback, took a lot of

[57:07] money in from a lot of people or a certain amount of people and then slowly but surely worked

[57:12] himself into a hole and realized he couldn't get out. And then John comes on my show and basically

[57:17] says I'm a guy with good intentions who got a lot of money on my good ideas from a lot of people

[57:23] and dug myself a hole and now I can't get out. He literally said what I was thinking and I was like

[57:28] yeah that's kind of the story. So what else was there? It's like this guy screwed up. He couldn't

[57:33] do it. It's sad to me and it's if I had money in it I'd be mad as hell. But to me from an outsider

[57:41] it's this sad thing where a guy who's not a businessman doesn't know how to run a business has

[57:46] really has no sense about business clearly. And this is going to be the legacy I think which kind

[57:53] of sucks for him. But if you look back at John Papaduke how many games did he actually design?

[57:58] Yeah not many what four. So four one of which it's pretty much agreed upon by most people that

[58:04] were there. He was kind of bailed out on World Cup soccer. He needed to help. They dragged him away

[58:10] from it. Yeah they had to get him away from it. So he had three games and if you talk to the

[58:16] people that were at Valley Williams at the time he was doing the same stuff then he was digging

[58:22] himself into holes and making things probably harder than they needed to be. And that's fine if

[58:29] you're building a piece of artwork. But if you're trying to build a product for commercial sale

[58:34] that you're going to support a business on. At some point you have to have the guy over your

[58:39] shoulder saying your building materials is out of line. We're not redoing the brackets. We're not

[58:44] making the cabinet size. We're not making the glass three inches longer than it should be.

[58:48] All those things just added up and just sunk him so deep in a hole. And I really feel bad for the

[58:53] guy. And I really feel bad for the people who trusted the guy. It was sort of a lesson for the

[58:59] whole pinball world at that time is like make sure you know where you're sending your money.

[59:03] And the interesting thing to Nate is like his games back in the day they weren't successful in their

[59:10] time. They were celebrated years later. Yeah I agree but I also look at what the industry

[59:18] was doing at that time as best I can from you know. Well it just wasn't the industry wasn't that

[59:24] successful at the time really. I mean medieval madness wasn't that successful at the time either.

[59:31] But I do think he has a certain thing going on in Circus Voltaire and Theatre Magic in

[59:37] Tales of the Arabian Knights which I don't think anybody else quite had. He definitely created

[59:42] something under the glass in those games that is unique. And I quite honestly really really

[59:47] appreciate and I don't want to use the word love but I do really enjoy those games and short

[59:54] comings aside. I think some of the shortcomings weren't things that he had to do with namely code.

[59:59] So I really do like what John put put into those three games but to want to send that guy 15

[01:00:05] grand because he was the main play field and you know lead idea design on those three games and

[01:00:13] partly you know woke up soccer. I don't know that's some of that has to go on the people that

[01:00:19] sent the money at some point right. I agree I mean I said it I've said I beat this drum in

[01:00:25] a million times is people gave him some people gave him 30 grand plus for one guy who didn't have

[01:00:33] a company who didn't have a plan who brought Ben heck up on stage then Ben heck quit like two

[01:00:38] weeks later like all the red flags were there and people kept handing him more money and it's it is

[01:00:45] on the buyers just as much as it is on John now I'm not victim blaming but it takes two to lose money

[01:00:53] in any sort of I don't think you can victim blame when you have a 23 thousand dollar box of

[01:00:58] lights in your living room Chris well I mean yeah no it's so my you know what's weird about

[01:01:03] this magic on looking at it right now is so I think behind the scenes when I bought a spot for

[01:01:11] magic girl I sort of took American pinball at its word that they were going to complete magic girl

[01:01:18] and and foolishly I I was like all right like these guys have money they're going to get it done

[01:01:23] they wouldn't have like 20 cabinets lined up if they were going to just like quit but then

[01:01:30] the nightmare occurred at expo where they didn't bring the game that Joel Balls were got up

[01:01:34] there and basically said they were taking American pinball in a different direction and I thought I

[01:01:38] lost my my money because it was a non-refundable deposit on the on the game and so here's the thing

[01:01:45] to Nate like I I had worked really hard to talk to John the talk to like Bill Brandes to talk to

[01:01:52] like there was like a lot of legal issues that weren't ironed out like John kind of duped AP

[01:01:57] along with everybody else like they thought they had permission just to release the game they

[01:02:01] didn't have the IP for it so a lot of shit was going on that I just dove head first into because

[01:02:07] I didn't want to lose my money and I was like at that point it was like a selfish desire for me to

[01:02:11] get the game out but here's the crazy part so I talked to John on the phone and so did like other

[01:02:17] people he he was adamant that none of his creations were going to be sacrificed at the game worked

[01:02:24] perfectly that he got everything working and and that is why it is so mind boggling by what arrived

[01:02:32] in February with with next missing magnets missing the code is just a mess and it's just like

[01:02:40] I really feel bad for Johnny because I think the last year he got his get out of jail free card he

[01:02:45] found a very wealthy person to float him and an American pinball invested a lot of money in magic

[01:02:54] girl and yeah John didn't do the one thing he needed to do which was pick up the phone and say

[01:03:00] I need help and get people involved who could help him get it working enough so that it wouldn't be

[01:03:09] what it is now which is still just a boxing blink blink thing of lights with some fun callouts

[01:03:15] the thing is visually stunning um but it's a shame and I think right now and I know Nate you were

[01:03:20] contacted by Wall Street Journal I talked to them it's really interesting because I think John on

[01:03:25] some level I can't tell if he thinks this is like a victory lap for him with the the media coverage

[01:03:32] that's going to happen uh but I know this all the owners who have talked about it are telling the

[01:03:38] truth that this this isn't this is like a sad story that's it's it's an interesting story but it's a

[01:03:44] sad one it's not a celebratory moment for him yeah that I mean it's it makes me feel a little

[01:03:56] bit bad because I see John you know when you the one of the memories I have of him is him sitting at

[01:04:01] the expo where he revealed the empty cabinets and he was sitting in a corner and he and I hadn't

[01:04:07] spoken because he'd blown me off for a podcast I think and I I walked by him and he kind of said like

[01:04:13] hey Nate kind of like almost like don't ignore me I'm over here and I said hey John and I went and

[01:04:17] looked at the cabinets and and he said I'll show you those later and and I just think that

[01:04:23] this is a guy who you know moved to Chicago to work in pinball whose you know career was pinball whose

[01:04:30] identity is pinball who clearly does have some great ideas as far as the design concepts and

[01:04:39] he's sort of shut out now because he he blew it he ran a business into the ground he owes a

[01:04:44] ton of people a bunch of money there's legal proceedings etc etc and I don't know if this is a

[01:04:52] victory left for him it's pretty pretty sad and a little delusional because can he get out of this

[01:05:00] somehow sure but it's gonna take time and there's gonna need to be a way to pay money back I mean

[01:05:05] he's got to find a way to put a business together that generates money to then literally send

[01:05:10] people money back and and he take a long time see I think he had it Nate with American pinball because

[01:05:16] John I still think as I look at the game now is one of the greatest creative directors of pinball

[01:05:22] I think he knows how to make a pinball machine look magical and his his his discovery of zombie

[01:05:30] of Matt Andrews who did the cabinet art and and just the way he creates that world under glass

[01:05:36] but Houdini was his moment where if he could have just got magic girl working enough and got Houdini

[01:05:44] out but what happened somewhere along the line would happen I think with American pinball

[01:05:48] they realized remember when they said like we're gonna deliver all the magic girls by the end of

[01:05:53] the year and we're gonna bring Chris from coin take or his magic girl by Expo I think they realized

[01:05:59] like shit like he's he's spent a year and he's no further along than he was like back in

[01:06:08] May you know like they realized like they couldn't rely on him to get it done

[01:06:12] um and I think I think that was like I think that might be his final chance because I think the the

[01:06:18] only other way he has out is if he partners up with like a major manufacturer to design a game and

[01:06:24] says look I'm gonna do this for free and I'm gonna design it for you and

[01:06:30] Whatever you pay me has to go back to like credit towards my zidware customers

[01:06:34] But but then like who would ever even want to get involved right look at all the bad

[01:06:38] No, I mean that will you get?

[01:06:40] It yeah, that's that's the problem now is it's it's toxic at this point and

[01:06:45] He had an opportunity. I know for a fact he had an opportunity at one point to jump jump on board with a major company

[01:06:51] And he he turned it down

[01:06:53] Because he thought he thought he deserved more money, right? I mean he was like

[01:06:57] Yeah, something of that I don't know the details there

[01:06:59] But I know that he certainly wanted more of something whether it was control or money or etc

[01:07:06] He he again kind of goes back to what I said earlier he thought he knew better and

[01:07:11] He turns out he didn't and that's too bad

[01:07:14] Do you think the magic girls will ever be fixed? I think there's a question

[01:07:19] Yeah, because I think yes, I think that our hobbies full of people who are pretty

[01:07:26] Pretty smart and driven and some of the things that I've seen built in in this thing

[01:07:32] You know go to tpf this weekend you're gonna see a bunch of boutique games that people built in their garages over the weekends

[01:07:38] So yeah, I think somebody will

[01:07:41] I you know fix it to some degree yeah definitely right as I know the coder is working on it right now

[01:07:47] As I look at it too, it's like everything can be fixed

[01:07:50] I mean I see where some of his things there just needs to be a few magnets here and there

[01:07:55] The center mechanism is I think that's what got John stuck for years Nate is he had this like

[01:08:00] making the ball levitate desire and

[01:08:03] he just

[01:08:05] He bit off more than he could chew with the center mechanism and I and it became like the nucleus of the game

[01:08:10] And I think it's almost ironic too the way like

[01:08:13] He just kept building that center mech higher and higher and higher to the point where it like blocked his thing

[01:08:18] Yeah, yeah, it like blocked his entire display

[01:08:22] Uh, and I think you know it looks amazing, but literally

[01:08:26] it the whole thing just

[01:08:29] Just doesn't work on that I don't want to be the proponent of like easy way outs or or cheap design

[01:08:35] But if John pop it Duke had gone back and say taken

[01:08:40] Tales your abin nights and literally just overlaid it change the toys change you know flip it reverse it mirror image everything

[01:08:48] Whatever you want to do and then lay on zombie yetis artwork on top of it with the new theme and get somebody to write the rules

[01:08:55] He just sold he just sold a bunch of games well even easier Nate

[01:08:59] I was like oh John I gave him this advice all you should do is just get zombie yeti to redo the art on tails

[01:09:05] And call it like the founders edition and make 50 of them for 20 grand each and you would have sold every one

[01:09:12] Yeah, I mean obviously you got to be careful about somebody else's design property. I mean

[01:09:16] I just have to license it from pps rick is rick has the license for all the world. Yeah

[01:09:20] Yeah, I mean sure if you're gonna do that go go pay pay rick what he whatever he wants

[01:09:25] And left arm left leg whatever game is designed all he then he then John could have fun with art

[01:09:31] Which is clearly where he wanted to spend most of his time

[01:09:35] Well, we'll see where that or hiring an artist that is yeah, we'll see where the story ends, but I think it's um

[01:09:42] It's it's definitely indicative of this year Nate where like miracles are happening you're on the canators pinball podcast

[01:09:50] That's a miracle

[01:09:51] Magic girl came out

[01:09:53] Um, and I agree with you Nate. I think this is probably gonna be one of the most exciting years for pinball in in a long time because a lot

[01:10:01] I don't remember saying that I think last year was one of the most I'm just kidding

[01:10:05] I think it should be I think it'll be a good year. Yeah, and I think tpf

[01:10:09] Uh this weekend. I think tpf is the new like it's the new like show like this is the show for two years

[01:10:15] It's been that's it's been the best show in the country for two years right

[01:10:18] Yeah, and even like the seminars and the announcements are I have definitely are overriding what we see at expo

[01:10:25] Expos got some work to do if they want to get back ton of work to do expo is as a shell of itself

[01:10:31] It's sad really to see

[01:10:33] I I'm really

[01:10:35] Disappointed in the fact that uh, they haven't figured out the the way the way to fix expo because there is a way to do it um

[01:10:43] But I think you have a group in Texas and a group in Pittsburgh that are putting shows on with replay effects and Texas pinball festival

[01:10:52] That are truly truly truly motivated about putting on the best show they possibly can and I think you have a group in Chicago

[01:10:59] That is truly truly motivated in making as much money as you possibly can from putting on a pretty good show right or at least trying to

[01:11:07] Yeah, and the the funny thing is they're not making nearly as much money as the people in Texas and in Pittsburgh who are

[01:11:14] Making better shows

[01:11:16] The critical rise man. I think I think the

[01:11:19] The pop of foundation the replay foundation and the guys in Texas with ed and his whole group

[01:11:24] They if they're making money on the shows good for them because those shows are worth every dollar spent right

[01:11:29] Well, I'm looking forward to going um

[01:11:32] Look out for my ad in the brochure people

[01:11:35] You're gonna want to look at the fine print on it

[01:11:37] But Nate we've been a little bit over an hour. I really want to thank you for taking the time to come on the podcast. This has been

[01:11:44] Really just like I will say it like a dream to have you come on again

[01:11:48] I loved your show from the moment I first heard it

[01:11:51] And I look forward to hearing more coast to coast pinball in the future

[01:11:55] Thank you. You're far too kind. I appreciate it

[01:11:58] I wish you the best of luck congrats on 101 episodes

[01:12:02] I know that your math is bad as mine because this is probably episode 106 or something

[01:12:05] There's like some special editions and some episodes I had at the leap because of legal issues

[01:12:11] So we're kind of like 120 something, but this is this is technically 101 within episode name

[01:12:19] Best of luck to you. I hope you avoid legal issues and maybe someday you'll find a reinstatement on pinside

[01:12:25] Well, we're gonna start campaigning for that. Um, well, I'm not you might don't

[01:12:29] Don't screw it up if you get it. It's all I can say right

[01:12:32] Well, I'll see Robin at tpf. He's like he's like I like Chris, but I can't stand canate it. I'm like, huh

[01:12:38] Um

[01:12:38] Well, Nate I really appreciate it and hopefully you know next time you're in the state if you're ever in New York

[01:12:44] Hit me up you can come play magic girl at one of the 25 locations available

[01:12:48] I'm playing it earth and we'll have a good time. All right. All right. I have a good day. Fox seems to
