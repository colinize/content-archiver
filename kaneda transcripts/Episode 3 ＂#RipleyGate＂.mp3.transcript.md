[13:17] いから autobiで dat

[13:21] 開け火幕をありますか!

[13:30] さっこにウィーバー

[13:32] you need you need it you need to have

[13:35] Bill Paxton you know instead I mean you're just gonna have a whole bunch of this

[13:49] All right well, it's not gonna be crickets, but we're just not gonna get what people expect it at all

[13:56] Now look in all fairness to highway

[13:58] I

[14:00] Kind of want to read their responses to this whole allegation that

[14:06] They don't know what's gonna be in the game

[14:08] Andrew respond it once this sort of

[14:11] Crisis broke for them and said we wouldn't necessarily want various actors place all over the playfield

[14:20] Okay, I'm just gonna stop I'm gonna take some of this line by line

[14:24] All right, and he says because we are representing both movies we want the playfield art to sit new

[14:30] neutrally between both movies

[14:33] And you come on if you could put the

[14:37] Actors that are so iconic from these films on the playfields. You know even have them huddled around

[14:44] The movies they represent

[14:47] I don't know. I think that would that would really be a great visual cue

[14:51] He goes on to say obviously that isn't always possible with APC for example

[14:57] But I personally think that oric has struck a very good balance between both movies here or it has stated that he couldn't use Ripley at the time

[15:05] He was doing the playfield art that is also true. Okay, so that statement there

[15:10] Seems a little strange to me

[15:13] Oric stated that he couldn't use Ripley at the time he was doing the playfield art

[15:19] When I read that at the time

[15:22] That implies that

[15:24] Okay, they might be in talks to get her likeness and they might be in talks to possibly use her which is good news

[15:34] But it's really confusing as to why you would start the playfield art

[15:41] Without knowing whether or not you would have

[15:45] Sigoni Weaver who's the main character in alien and aliens

[15:52] As part of your license deal

[15:56] He goes on to say secondly we will officially announce what the situation is regarding actors call out music closer to the release date

[16:05] The release date for alien

[16:08] Was supposed to be April 15th. Okay, there is no release date for alien right now

[16:14] He goes on the reason for this is that it is an ongoing process with our license

[16:19] Er and therefore it is not something that we can comment on at this point

[16:25] What I can tell you is that we want what you want

[16:28] Whether we get all of it or some of it is the real issue and one that we will clarify at a later date. Okay

[16:37] I

[16:40] The silence is just me processing

[16:43] What was just released today as an official statement about this game and this is Andrew's response I

[16:53] I'll get into another response and there was so much just back and forth with with

[16:58] With oric and people on the form and I I don't like that at all because

[17:05] And it is Andrew's company and there's so much just

[17:10] Back and forth and multiple channels of communication it makes it confusing to understand what's going on with this game, but what I will say is this

[17:19] If you did not

[17:21] No or secure

[17:25] the proper

[17:27] Elements of the license to make the alien pinball machine that you wanted to

[17:32] Why would you announce that you were making an alien pin

[17:38] the 35th anniversary of aliens and you were going to have both movies represented and

[17:46] Constantly touted the community that this was going to be the most immersed

[17:50] Pin we were going to focus on the atmosphere of the movie someone on the forum said it perfectly

[17:57] without the characters and the callouts and

[18:01] Without footage from the film with those characters in it you're really just playing a

[18:07] Space theme game that is inspired by alien

[18:12] Inspired by with elements, you know with the aliens and

[18:17] The green and it is an alien looking pin

[18:21] But when you strip out all those elements

[18:24] It's no longer a game you're playing

[18:28] Really that's feeling like you're stepping into those movies that you love

[18:33] So I'm just so baffled by why

[18:38] Alien was announced and stuff is being revealed

[18:43] While they are still working on the licensing

[18:47] It doesn't seem common-sensical to me that you would even start artwork you would start coding you would start toys

[18:54] You would start ramps you would start the game until you locked up all of your assets

[19:00] Okay, what's everything we can work with and then go build it?

[19:04] For them to have already finished the playfield and

[19:08] now they're talking to

[19:11] Agents and actors and trying to secure those likenesses

[19:15] seems

[19:16] Enane to me it seems like amateur hour going on right now guys

[19:23] You know we give Stern so much crap

[19:26] but man

[19:28] Highways brand new and and maybe this is a rookie mistake, but why why even

[19:36] Mismanage expectations this way, you know, I just can't understand it

[19:44] You know this is like why they shouldn't never have started talking about it until they had all this stuff figured out

[19:52] So here's

[19:54] something

[19:55] That is the other side of highway because I think highway is a nation with two leaders especially on pinside

[20:03] I think highway is led by Andrew and ork and like I didn't want to talk about this again

[20:10] I did not want to bring up this game for while I got a lot of flak

[20:15] People saying I'm obsessed. I'm a creep. I'm going after like ork. No, this is

[20:20] Something that is blowing up and I'm just covering on it in a way that I guarantee you

[20:26] No other podcast is really gonna like go at this thing like this so

[20:32] The ork responded and he's been responding throughout the day and and really telling people to calm down

[20:39] Don't panic don't panic, but people have every right to panic dudes you guys came in and raised expectations about this thing

[20:46] So he writes and this is word for what he said

[20:51] Here's the deal in a nutshell the actors own their own likenesses

[20:54] It is not in their movie contract. We can license the film, but we don't get them with it automatically

[21:01] We have to ask them separately that process is ongoing

[21:05] It's not something I can really talk about legal issues not my place etc. Okay, but here's the part that he says

[21:12] That I really don't get

[21:15] He says the point is this is normal don't panic and what you're seeing is how the sausage is made

[21:24] Okay, we're not buying sausage here. We're buying six to eight thousand our pinball machines

[21:29] Of course, it would be better to have this all in one place before announcing the game

[21:34] Okay, so right there and I agree with him. He says and he says no argument

[21:38] Here's the line that I don't get this is the statement that I just I'm still wondering about this

[21:44] He says but it's the nature of the beast with a new pinball company that had to announce early not to get lost

[21:55] What does that mean not to get lost

[22:01] So highways and new company

[22:05] Is he saying that when they announced full throttle a theme which I don't know 99% of us can agree is

[22:12] undesirable to 99% of pinball players

[22:18] They had to say well look we've got this new company highway. It's all about

[22:24] Being able to swap the play fields we have a different take on pinball. We've made some innovations

[22:30] And they had to announce that their second title was going to be a license team so people would actually

[22:35] Care and consider them

[22:37] So I think that's what he's saying we had to announce that

[22:40] Alien is going to be number two and everyone like alien. That's great. We'd love an alien pin

[22:46] Alien hits the demo for pinball on the head so they announced they were going to make alien

[22:52] And had an LCD and everyone got excited and

[22:59] It just turns out that what do they really have

[23:03] What do they really really have from Fox?

[23:08] I don't know at this point

[23:11] It's starting to look like they just have a few assets not a lot that ended up on the play field

[23:20] Really might you know the minutia of the universe

[23:24] um and then we have any of the actors

[23:28] Do they even have the scenes from the movie that are supposed to get you into those modes? I don't I don't know

[23:33] It doesn't sound like it

[23:35] He then says just relax watch the fascinating process of making pinball unfold in excruciating slow motion before your very eyes

[23:44] And we're gonna keep making a great game in the meantime

[23:47] sorry

[23:49] People are not going to relax when they read that watch the process of making pinball unfold you guys

[23:58] Set an initial release date of April 2015

[24:03] Okay, and when you set that you

[24:05] Saw what was going on with other pinball manufacturers the ones who promised and didn't deliver

[24:11] Okay

[24:12] At that point

[24:13] When that date was even said

[24:16] Did you even have anything highway?

[24:18] Did you just have like a letter of agreement from Fox? I just don't understand

[24:25] It's not

[24:28] people have every reason

[24:30] To just be questioning okay

[24:33] What is this pin gonna be?

[24:36] I think I know what I my hunch now

[24:39] Is it's gonna be more of a game inspired by aliens than a game where you're playing the alien films and do you want that game?

[24:50] You have to ask yourself that question and you know aliens got pre-orders going and and I love how people are like

[24:57] nervous about getting in on the Ellie the Ellie is not sold out

[25:01] For the Ellie not to have sold out with just 500 when the pre-order money is not asking a lot remember

[25:08] We've got jack

[25:12] You know selling

[25:14] pre-orders for hobbit for eight thousand dollars in change right

[25:19] And the alien pre-order is just 1500 and they're making half as many as jacks making special decisions and additions of hobbit

[25:27] And it's not sold out look and I get it. It's still a gamble. They really hadn't shipped anything full throttle is just coming out

[25:35] but this

[25:38] This is really

[25:40] Really a sticky situation for them and if you follow the thread and you look at what's happening

[25:49] You know

[25:51] It's it's not looking that good. It's not looking that good

[25:54] And

[25:56] Well luckily, you know, I really want to get to the bottom of this so

[26:01] I called over to highway pinball today and I was able to actually

[26:06] To get Andrew on the phone and and just ask him like Andrew

[26:12] Is this you know is this what what are your thoughts on all this like can you tell me like what you're thinking?

[26:19] I just want to I just want to play back

[26:22] What he said to me. I think it's I think you guys should all just just listen to it

[26:29] That's great. That's just fucking great man

[26:33] How would the fuck are we supposed to do?

[26:35] Where's the real pretty shit now man? Game over man. Game over. The fuck are we gonna do now?

[26:42] What are we gonna do? Yeah, now I you know, I really felt bad. He was he was panicking and and going crazy

[26:49] You know, so I thought to myself like well

[26:52] If Andrew's not sure maybe maybe I should give oracle and see see if he he has any thoughts on when it was like to work with Fox and

[27:01] You know what his conversations with Fox have been recently and here's what he had to say

[27:06] We've made too many compromises already too many retreats

[27:10] We invade our space and we fall back

[27:14] They're simulating entire worlds and we fall back

[27:19] Not again the line must be drawn here

[27:23] This far no further

[27:27] I will make them pay for what they've done. Yeah, yeah, he was really upset and I understand why I mean it's been a

[27:35] It's been a rough day for highway and

[27:39] look

[27:40] the

[27:42] Net net here and they've they're they're almost saying it themselves

[27:47] I really don't think they have experience dealing with a license

[27:52] We saw this with one other company

[27:55] Dutch pinball anyone and big Lebowski

[27:58] And how tricky that can be

[28:02] and

[28:03] Let let me remind people when I said this is all marketing is this not the marketing of highway pinball

[28:08] Is this not poor marketing to communicate to your audience?

[28:13] inconsistencies with what the game is or not even inconsistencies but just

[28:17] Talking before you should putting the cart before the horse in this case and it's really really

[28:24] Sad to see companies tripping in the same way over and over and over again and the only company that doesn't do this

[28:33] Well, the only two companies really

[28:36] Spooky I will count them they did a license team and they didn't

[28:40] Reveal it and didn't talk about it until they did everything locked up and stern who does it every time?

[28:46] Who does it multiple times a year?

[28:49] And if this was all so highway didn't get lost

[28:54] Then this is a colossal

[28:56] fumble because

[28:58] They're not lost now and they're on the radar in the wrong way possible so

[29:04] really

[29:05] Really bad news for them today and it's not you know

[29:08] It's not the end of the world. It's not going to

[29:12] Make people feel confident in the pinnets about to come so they can keep working on stuff and tell people the relax

[29:17] But I don't think they're going to

[29:20] But after all of this I don't know about you guys, but I walked away with one

[29:25] Feeling and one feeling only

[29:28] Is that this game is gonna be delayed

[29:34] Delayed

[29:36] That word we all love

[29:38] I don't think this pin ships anymore in the first six months of 2016 at all now

[29:45] Not after what we heard today all this ongoing stuff I I think I

[29:51] Think if they show show alien

[29:56] and

[29:57] And it's clear that what people were expecting with the movie clips and the calls isn't in there they're gonna

[30:03] Being trouble so I think they're gonna work hard to get that stuff and I look I hope they get it all in

[30:09] But they put themselves in this position nobody else made them reveal alien no one else made them say all those things about how immersive

[30:15] It's gonna be they did it and right now

[30:19] There really is no reason to be pre-ordering in alien Ellie and I'm speaking

[30:24] And I have one pre-order because I you know, I want this pin to be great

[30:29] And I'm wondering what's the point if especially for all the at least stuff can be just be bought and put on the regular

[30:36] Why do you have to be in on this game early?

[30:38] So I think they've got a lot of work to do I think they've got a lot of

[30:43] Expectations to manage and I think the next time we hear from highway

[30:47] Better be with some good news and if there's one man they should call it's probably Roger Sharp to get this ship

[30:53] and this train

[30:55] Back on track, so

[30:57] That's what happened today with with highway

[31:18] Can the jerk who keeps spreading the rumor that we're gonna see a ghost buster's reveal every Friday

[31:26] Just stop

[31:29] I mean come on now

[31:32] All day today the ghost busters thread blowing up

[31:37] We're gonna see it they're gonna launch it at the same time as spooky's

[31:42] Twitch reveal come on guys

[31:46] We're not seeing ghost busters this week just shut up

[31:51] Go give them one and a girl for the squeeze for me

[31:53] How do you know about my moon?

[31:55] I know

[31:58] All right

[32:00] Our final topic tonight is gonna be an interesting poll that was put up recently that I just want to

[32:09] Go over and it was an it was an affair question. What's your favorite new pinball company?

[32:16] And they list Dutch pinball

[32:18] highway pinball

[32:20] spooky pinball

[32:22] Jersey jack pinball and Chicago gaming planetary

[32:30] number one

[32:32] And I think deservedly so with 92 votes with spooky pinball how can you not

[32:39] Consider spooky to be

[32:43] The best new pinball company all things considered all things considered. I'm not saying they make the best game that's new

[32:51] But

[32:52] They're consistency and their ability to deliver I think so number two

[32:58] We'll spooky at 38% of the vote with 92 votes number two with 75 votes is Jersey jack pinball

[33:07] Jure I think Jersey jack is brought incredible innovation to the table and they

[33:13] Deservedly so you know have won over many fans with their final product

[33:18] But

[33:20] My god the wait for those games

[33:23] On a on a future episode real soon. I'm gonna talk about

[33:28] pre-ordering and you can't talk about pre-ordering without Jersey jack and there is a stat that I have that will just

[33:36] Below your mind in terms of locking your money up for years with Jersey jack

[33:40] But regardless was is a beautiful machine. Hobbit is looking to be beautiful in its ships

[33:47] Uh, number three interesting enough after tonight's topic highway pinball with 55 votes

[33:54] Huh, it's interesting because

[33:57] Considering what they've delivered. I think all 55 of those votes are people who want to buy alien

[34:03] And want it to be great

[34:05] Because not many people have full throttle and I really

[34:11] I know I'm not the biggest fan of the playfield LCD and the innovations they've brought in the swapable playfields and everything

[34:16] You know I heard

[34:18] Some people think it makes sense. I just I don't think people are gonna do it

[34:21] So but those three highways spooky Jersey jack they seem to be

[34:28] You know around the the three most popular and then we have a huge drop-off and

[34:32] battling out for last place and this just goes to show what a difference a year makes

[34:38] In second to last place with a with a whopping 5%

[34:43] And only 12 votes

[34:45] Dutch pinball

[34:47] Dutch pinball

[34:48] These guys really went from hero to zero

[34:53] I think more than any other company in 2015

[34:59] They had everybody in love with them

[35:02] Myself included I played big Lebowski when it came to modern pinball

[35:06] I still love the machine. I still think out of all the new machines coming out. It's

[35:11] The best overall package. I mean it is 10 grand now that they've got

[35:18] Roger sharp doing the license and it seems like even though they're losing the

[35:22] Official music from what we've heard with the new music. It sounds great. It looks great

[35:27] But they have no fans left

[35:29] The only time people want to hear from Dutch now is when they're shipping that damn thing

[35:33] They can take the rug the rug and shove it as far as most people are concerned

[35:37] and last

[35:39] Is Chicago gaming planetary pinball with 10 votes. I think those 10 people are employees of Chicago gaming planetary

[35:47] It's it's interesting because

[35:50] They're shipping

[35:51] MMR if you change this question from what's your favorite new pinball company

[35:57] To what's your favorite new pinball machine

[36:01] You can't buy a new pinball machine from Dutch you can't buy one from highway really that shipping

[36:05] I mean fault for us not really shipping and I don't think many people want that

[36:09] spooky pinball

[36:11] Nothing new shipping yet Jersey jack

[36:15] nothing new

[36:16] MMR just those delays are incredible

[36:21] Absolutely incredible and I think it just goes to show the the difficulty right and in making pinballs when even when you're recreating a game

[36:29] How hard it is to do and that and the delays and parts and and whatnot

[36:35] Just an interesting poll just wanted to end on something like that

[36:40] And I

[36:41] You know say this we're seeing

[36:45] A lot of

[36:47] Companies stumble as they try to to innovate and try to make pinball

[36:53] You know try to give pinball some competition try to give stern some competition in the industry

[36:57] And it just doesn't seem to be working out for people other than spooky

[37:02] I

[37:03] Can't consider anyone else to really feel it be feeling good about what they've done and the

[37:08] And you know and I think the real reason is

[37:12] Is that you know all this innovation is going on

[37:16] But nobody's really innovating the right thing and there really is there's just

[37:22] There's one element of a pinball machine that really needs to be innovated and if a company could crack this

[37:28] They would really

[37:30] Dominate the market they would corner pinball

[37:34] And they would get more sales and pre-orders than any machine ever and that innovation i'm talking about and it's probably been on your mind on on the tip of your tongue

[37:43] Is we really need a double high

[37:46] interactive ball scoop

[37:49] Let me repeat that we need a double high

[37:52] Interactive ball scoop and I know i'm not the only one who feels this way and actually i'm starting to work on

[37:59] We have kind of a double high interactive ball scoop kind of a new design

[38:04] Can't say too much about it yet, but it's twice as high as any ball scoop you've ever seen

[38:10] And has some new kind of interactive fun things that have done all right kids

[38:14] That's episode three of canada's pinball podcast. I hope you enjoyed it if you have any feedback
