[00:00] In my depends, you gotta know, when it goes

[00:07] When there's no cause, you only want to lose your way back

[00:12] Good morning from Texas people, it is 7.45 in the morning.

[00:25] I'm up on a few hours of sleep because my father decided to call me

[00:31] and leave a 20 minute voice message that was blank.

[00:34] So yes, he sort of butt dialed me, probably woke me up, but I'm a morning person.

[00:39] This is usually in New York.

[00:42] Bubba's already been barking an hour ago to wake me up.

[00:45] So I wanted to give you guys a day one recap of Texas Pimball Festival.

[00:50] And I always find it interesting when I read the forum and see how people are responding via forum

[00:57] to something that's actually happening in real life down in Texas.

[01:01] Let me first start by saying that this shows great.

[01:05] And I come to these shows first and foremost for the people and the conversations

[01:10] and the camaraderie people have around Pimball.

[01:12] And no show does that better than Texas Pimball Festival.

[01:17] And I almost don't even want to play that much Pimball.

[01:21] I'd rather just talk to people about Pimball.

[01:24] But I played a lot of Pimball and I'm going to talk to you guys about that experience

[01:29] and the all the news that came out of the show yesterday.

[01:32] First, I just want to say thank you to Kim and Ed who run the show.

[01:36] They're amazing.

[01:37] I was super happy when I got here to get my packet that said press and media on it

[01:42] and they hooked me up with an exhibitor badge and all this great stuff.

[01:46] So Ed and Kim, if you're listening, I thank you so much.

[01:50] The show is going great.

[01:51] So let's go down a list of the things that I know everyone is talking about.

[01:55] And let me give you my impressions and point of view on what I saw yesterday.

[01:59] So we have to start out with American Pimball's reveal of Houdini.

[02:04] This happened at 8 o'clock last night and Joe Balsor got up there.

[02:09] Scott was there.

[02:10] The Doble was there.

[02:11] They had a few more gentlemen there that a salesperson.

[02:15] And they talked a lot before showing the game.

[02:19] And I record it.

[02:21] Most of it.

[02:23] There wasn't really anything to note during that conversation.

[02:27] You know, I always find it funny when these seminars go on and people are talking and

[02:32] talking and talking.

[02:33] Show us the game.

[02:34] Just pull off the curtain and reveal the game.

[02:39] And have the game, have images of the game up on the PowerPoint.

[02:42] That was one thing that when I was in the room, I just didn't.

[02:47] You just couldn't see the game.

[02:49] Even when they pulled the curtain off, you wanted to just like rush up and see what was

[02:53] there.

[02:54] But we had to like wait for them to finish talking.

[02:56] But they eventually let everybody up and come up and see the game and play the game.

[03:01] And what are my thoughts?

[03:03] Well, look, I think that first and foremost, everybody is going to compare this game.

[03:08] Visually, to what came before with the Matt Andrews artwork that we saw with John's

[03:14] version of Houdini, do I think that this game visually has the same pop and wow as John's

[03:21] game?

[03:22] It doesn't.

[03:23] I still am in love with the previous version of Houdini that I saw.

[03:29] That being said, I can't help but feel like what good is it if you visually fall in love

[03:36] with the game if it doesn't work.

[03:39] And I know firsthand how easy it is for John to seduce us with artwork and with visualization,

[03:47] but engineering wise, nothing functions properly.

[03:49] So I would rather have a Houdini that doesn't look like a J-Pop game if it works versus a

[03:55] J-Pop looking Houdini that doesn't shoot properly.

[03:58] So I will always make the trade off moving forward to have the functioning game.

[04:03] That being said, I think the artwork still can come further along.

[04:09] I do feel it's a little bit like CGI and looks a little computerized and flat.

[04:14] Stuff is just dropped on there and there's not much depth to the art.

[04:20] And I think all the criticisms about the artwork, it's not as bad as people thought it would

[04:24] be when they were panicking when they saw some of that zoomed in artwork.

[04:29] But that's kind of what the art looks like in person.

[04:32] It doesn't have that sort of warmth and depth to it that could make the game visually

[04:39] pop more.

[04:40] And especially think about that when I look at the cabinet and I looked at J-Pop's cabinet

[04:45] with just popped from across the room you would see it and it would pull you in.

[04:50] I think the Houdini cabinet, it just feels a little dark, a little flat.

[04:56] And I know they're going for this steam punk kind of look on the cabinet and on the Playfield

[05:00] artwork.

[05:01] They definitely have achieved that.

[05:03] And steam punk is a little bit darker, right?

[05:05] It's a little bit, the colors are more sort of like your browns and your brasses and it's

[05:12] not very colorful.

[05:15] So the game has got a few things about the game that are interesting again.

[05:19] I'm not going to, you guys have to go on to like Pinsider, YouTube or look for videos

[05:23] of the game because I'm not going to go through like a visual, like try to explain to you

[05:26] what's in the game.

[05:27] The one thing that I thought was really interesting, if you look at the game, it's got

[05:31] a, there's a magic box.

[05:33] It looks like in the upper left corner and I was like, how does the ball get there?

[05:37] The ball gets there from a catapult, which is actually like over 10 inches away on the

[05:43] left side.

[05:44] So think about the catapult on medieval madness.

[05:47] There is a catapult that fires the ball into that box.

[05:50] But here's the interesting thing.

[05:52] There's no wire form ramp to guide the ball into the box.

[05:56] They were saying the ball fire is in there and I was talking to Joe Balls about.

[05:59] He said, fire is it in there?

[06:01] There's no guide.

[06:03] I need to see that to believe it.

[06:05] I don't think that was functioning yet in the game.

[06:07] I don't think it's coded in there yet.

[06:11] But that's going to be interesting if they can fire a ball over 10 inches into a magic

[06:15] box in mid-air.

[06:18] So a lot of the toys weren't really active on the machine right now, but we have to give

[06:22] them credit.

[06:23] They started working on this machine in November and the fact that there's a flipping

[06:27] game.

[06:28] I mean, they put the game out there for people to play.

[06:30] I really give these guys credit that they went from nothing to something in such a short

[06:36] amount of time.

[06:37] And it looks like the feedback from you guys is pretty positive at $69.95.

[06:44] If they can get this game into production, they're saying now sometime in 2017.

[06:48] So we're looking by the end of the year.

[06:51] Look, if the game was available now, I think people would have bought it.

[06:55] And I think people would walk home with the game.

[06:57] I just think by the end of the year with so much stuff coming out, it's going to be hard.

[07:01] They're going to really have to deliver a stellar game at that price to sell the game.

[07:07] And I think they'll hear the feedback on the art.

[07:10] Look, I don't, I think art can always be redone.

[07:13] We saw that with Jack in the Hobbit.

[07:14] We saw that with other titles.

[07:17] There's so much time for these guys to hear the feedback and make changes.

[07:21] And if I could give some feedback, it would be to maybe improve that artwork and make the

[07:25] game pop a little bit more.

[07:27] Another interesting thing, and I'll talk about this a little bit with Dial then as well,

[07:31] is the way they have the screen up on the back box.

[07:34] It's sort of like integrated with the curtain.

[07:36] So it almost looks, it's almost like you can't really see it there.

[07:40] It's really cool.

[07:41] It looks really cool.

[07:42] I do think the screen's a little high.

[07:44] I do think the screen is a little high up.

[07:46] And as you're playing Pimble, the less you can look up, the better, the better.

[07:53] But it looks really cool.

[07:54] I did like the fact that the scoring for Houdini, it's very low.

[07:58] They were like, we want the scoring to be the way scores would have happened back in

[08:02] Harry Houdini's day.

[08:03] So like over 100 years ago, and so it's like, you score like one at a time, like it's

[08:09] slowly up ticks.

[08:11] So we're looking at scores in the hundreds and thousands, not in the millions and billions.

[08:16] And I like that.

[08:17] I think it's absolutely stupid when people are scoring like four billion on Ghostbusters

[08:21] and Game of Thrones.

[08:22] I don't like super high scoring.

[08:25] So we saw it.

[08:26] Houdini's been out there.

[08:28] The marketer in me, the marketer in me does question, does question why show a Pimble

[08:35] machine in March if it might not be coming out now for eight months.

[08:41] That's just such a long time.

[08:43] And now that we've seen it, again, it's always hard to get that hype and that excitement.

[08:48] I always think you should announce and show your Pimble machine very close to shipping.

[08:54] But as Nate and I discussed on my last podcast, some of these companies, especially the new

[08:57] ones, they need to drum up this excitement early.

[09:00] I do think it's a little bit early to show it.

[09:03] I know everyone wants to be a Texas with their stuff and show people their stuff.

[09:07] But it's not going to help them nine months from now.

[09:11] So we're going to hopefully we'll see more surprises and as the game develops.

[09:15] But I want to say congrats to Josh and to Joe and to Scott and the Dovel and getting

[09:20] a game this far and having a playable at TPS.

[09:23] I think they should be applauded for that.

[09:25] All right, attack from Mara's remake, the other game that I really wanted to see and walk

[09:30] up to and I was really wondering, is it as hideous as all these people were complaining

[09:36] about?

[09:37] And I am here to tell you right now that all of you who complained about the green trim

[09:42] on attack from Mara's remake should be ashamed of yourselves.

[09:45] The game looks incredible and green.

[09:48] It looks phenomenal.

[09:51] It's beautiful.

[09:53] It really is.

[09:54] It really is.

[09:55] It's not the same kind of Ghostbusters green.

[09:57] It's a little bit of a darker green.

[10:00] But it works perfectly.

[10:01] And I think for those of you who went on the forum and complained, I think you're going

[10:07] to eat crow when you see this thing in person.

[10:09] It looks phenomenal.

[10:10] We have to start with the price.

[10:12] So $7,995 for the LE.

[10:16] So less than 8 grand.

[10:18] I mean $5, less but still less than 8 grand.

[10:21] Then $72.99 for the premium.

[10:27] It goes LE premium.

[10:28] I get confused with all these titles.

[10:30] So then the pro version is $64.99.

[10:32] So $6,573.79.

[10:35] $95.

[10:38] It's a great price.

[10:39] It's a great price.

[10:40] They price this thing perfectly.

[10:42] I think people were expecting to come in a little bit higher.

[10:46] But it's competitively priced.

[10:48] And what do I think of the game?

[10:49] I think the LE is my favorite by far.

[10:51] By far.

[10:52] If I was going to go in on one of these, the LE with the mirror blaze, the top are so

[10:56] freaking cool.

[10:57] It is.

[10:58] You have to see this top earn person.

[10:59] It is one of the greatest topers I've ever seen on a pinball machine.

[11:02] It really is.

[11:04] If Stern is charging $500 for their top earners, this top earners $1,000.

[11:08] Of course, easily.

[11:09] That's how freaking cool it is.

[11:11] And I think you're going to want it.

[11:12] I think if you are an attack from Mars fan, you are going to want the LE.

[11:16] Now here's the good news.

[11:18] You guys who cried about the green trim, you're going to get your way.

[11:21] Because I heard at the show and confirmed they are going to offer black as the other

[11:26] option on the LE.

[11:27] So black or green.

[11:30] But I will say this, there is an attack from Mars here that has the black trim.

[11:35] It doesn't pop and it doesn't sing as well as the green one that is in the PPS area.

[11:42] So I would still get the green.

[11:44] I would still get the green.

[11:45] But it's good to know that you guys can now get the version you want of attack from Mars.

[11:50] Now I played the game and it was, I've played attack from Mars before and it's not my

[11:57] favorite game.

[11:58] I have to say, I've always found it to be a little wide open and I've always found the artwork

[12:04] to be just a little basic.

[12:06] It doesn't really wow me.

[12:09] But the code is amazing, the callouts are amazing.

[12:13] The game is super fun.

[12:17] But I'll say this when you jump on a remake, after like a few minutes or like, man, I,

[12:21] yeah, it's attack from Mars.

[12:23] I've been down this road before.

[12:25] It doesn't kind of give you that, wow, like you're discovering the game for the first

[12:30] time feeling.

[12:31] That's just because that's what happens when you remake a game after 20 years that people

[12:35] have played for 20 years.

[12:36] You're just never going to have that, like it feels new.

[12:40] You're just never going to get that.

[12:42] But I will say this, if you want an attack from Mars, you can't deny that this thing is

[12:47] the way to go.

[12:48] And let's talk about the display because I was skeptical about this display.

[12:51] I was like, you know, I don't know if it works.

[12:53] It looks stretchy.

[12:54] It doesn't, I don't know if it's going to, if they're going to pull it off, it looks,

[12:58] it looks great.

[12:59] It looks awesome.

[13:01] The way the dots look are incredible.

[13:04] I was worried that it would scale awkwardly.

[13:06] It doesn't.

[13:07] It really works.

[13:08] And the dots, they're perfect for this game.

[13:11] And I like the height.

[13:13] I'm going to say this.

[13:14] I like the height of the display.

[13:16] That size, that height for the display is perfect for pinball.

[13:21] Once you get bigger, once you get bigger, like in the land of dialed in and alien and

[13:27] even the Houdini's being higher up, it's too much.

[13:31] You just don't want to look.

[13:33] You can't see it.

[13:34] It's, you know, especially with like dialed in an alien as much as it's there, you're just

[13:39] too close to a screen that big to really be able to quickly read and then go back to

[13:45] playing.

[13:46] It's more fun to watch people playing alien and dialed in with that screen than it is

[13:53] when you step up to it.

[13:54] You know, it's like, but that's maybe the purpose, right?

[13:56] It pulls people in.

[13:57] But as a player, I still like the smaller LCD sort of color DMD size screens for pinball.

[14:04] I just think they work better.

[14:06] But attack from Mars, definitely a game that is going to be a hit.

[14:10] They're going to ship them in I think a couple months.

[14:13] They're taking pre-orders now.

[14:15] I wouldn't worry about getting locked out of a pre-order.

[14:18] I think they're making a thousand LEDs.

[14:20] That's a lot of LEDs.

[14:22] But I think they're going to sell every one.

[14:24] I really do.

[14:25] I think this is going to be a hit for them.

[14:27] Now the question becomes, can they produce them?

[14:29] Are we going to have no hiccups when it comes to production on this game?

[14:35] Hopefully they can do it smoothly.

[14:37] The other thing that I just thought, again, I'm just spitballing here, guys, the back part

[14:44] of that game needs some art.

[14:46] It's just black.

[14:48] It needs some artwork.

[14:49] I'll say this, there was an attack from Mars here too that had a black light sort of

[14:54] going on where the colors just popped neon.

[14:57] Super freaking cool.

[14:59] I would do that upgrade if you could for this version.

[15:02] What else?

[15:03] I'm going out on this guy's of what I saw here.

[15:05] Let's go to spooky.

[15:07] I'm going to break.

[15:08] I heard from multiple people what the game's going to be.

[15:10] I'm going to break it right now for you guys.

[15:13] If I only hear it from one person into trusted source, but I heard it from multiple people,

[15:16] then it was confirmed with a trusted source.

[15:19] Buky's third game is going to be Alice Cooper.

[15:25] It's going to be Alice Cooper.

[15:27] That is what you're going to see revealed after the documentary.

[15:31] A bunch of people are talking about it.

[15:34] You know what?

[15:35] I think they're going to show the translate.

[15:38] This sort of, I'm letting you know so you can go discuss it.

[15:42] But we're not seeing much.

[15:43] This is just a little bit of an announcement.

[15:46] After my thoughts on Alice Cooper as spooky game number three, I'm not an Alice Cooper fan.

[15:52] You know, I just don't think that that theme is going to excite people the way monsters

[15:58] might have.

[16:00] Even meatloaf.

[16:01] I'm a bigger meatloaf fan.

[16:02] I'm going to be honest.

[16:03] I'm a bigger meatloaf fan than I am of Alice Cooper.

[16:06] So look, I know Alice Cooper has a fan base.

[16:09] So this game, when you go music, here's the problem with music themes.

[16:13] And I am shocked that spooky is going to go back to back with music.

[16:16] When you go music theme, it's a niche.

[16:19] It's a niche.

[16:20] Is it niche or niche?

[16:21] Everyone kept saying, canada, it's niche.

[16:23] It's a niche direction to go in.

[16:26] And you really will only get those die hard fans to want to spend $7,000 on a pinball machine

[16:34] for that theme.

[16:35] And that's why I personally don't like music pins.

[16:37] I am not excited by Erasmith to own.

[16:42] I'm excited to play.

[16:43] But if you go music, you're really going right after the fan base.

[16:47] So will Alice Cooper sell 500 units for spooky?

[16:51] I don't know.

[16:52] I don't know.

[16:53] I think it's going to be a bit of a tough sell to make 500 of those.

[16:58] And here's why I'm saying that.

[17:00] And I love Charlie.

[17:01] I love the team at spooky.

[17:03] And if you look at Rob Zombie and how the sales were towards the end, I kind of think Rob

[17:08] Zombie is a little bit on this.

[17:11] Is he of equal in terms of fan base and popularity?

[17:15] I kind of think they're in that same category.

[17:17] There's this metal music, heavy metal, hard rock, sort of dark sort of.

[17:24] I don't even know how to describe their genre.

[17:26] It's like sort of dark rock metal.

[17:29] I'm going to stop trying to describe it.

[17:32] They're in that similar category.

[17:34] And Rob Zombie, initially everyone was like, take my money, Rob Zombie, and it sold out

[17:38] pretty quickly.

[17:39] And there was a wait list.

[17:41] But as of March of 2017, that demand is tapered off.

[17:46] And I think it tapered off for a few reasons.

[17:48] I think one reason is a lot of people ran in because they thought only 300, I'm going

[17:52] to flip this game and make money.

[17:53] And then once they saw they weren't going to make money, they were going to maybe break

[17:58] even or lose money on it.

[17:59] A lot of people bailed out.

[18:02] That were in it just to flip.

[18:03] And that's cool.

[18:04] I know Charlie and company don't make games for people to flip.

[18:07] So there was that.

[18:08] It was like, okay, it's not going to be that rare, sought after, worth $8,000,000 in

[18:13] box in two months after it comes out.

[18:16] I'm going to get out because I don't really like the game that much.

[18:19] I think people are looking at these games on a merit level, which is how you should look

[18:24] at the game.

[18:25] So there was that part of it.

[18:26] So I think that 500 of Alice Cooper knowing that Rob Zombies sort of demand sort of declined

[18:35] at the end of its production cycle is going to be a hard sell.

[18:39] And the other reason is just it's going to be a hard sell.

[18:42] Not even that theme.

[18:44] It's just in the context of when this game is going to come out with attack from Mars

[18:49] being where it's at, with Star Wars coming, with dialed in coming, with Alien coming,

[18:54] with all these machines coming.

[18:56] I just don't see Alice Cooper rising above those other themes in terms of demand.

[19:05] Purely speculation on my part.

[19:07] If you're an Alice Cooper fan, though, this is the greatest news ever.

[19:10] So you will run and want one.

[19:13] So we're not going to see much though.

[19:14] We're not going to see much.

[19:15] We're just going to hear themes.

[19:16] So there's going to be a lot more that people want to see revealed on this game in the

[19:21] coming months.

[19:23] But that is going to be spooky number three.

[19:26] Let's talk about Jetsons because Jetsons is here.

[19:28] And it's very basic.

[19:29] It's very simple.

[19:31] It's a very simple layout.

[19:32] They added some really cool buildings and structures to it from the Jetsons universe.

[19:37] And it looks cool.

[19:38] It looks cool.

[19:39] You hold the button to, it Charlie was funny because no one could figure out how to plunge.

[19:43] You hold the button down.

[19:44] It's sort of like tech mode.

[19:45] He kept saying tech mobile.

[19:46] Like when you kick a field goal.

[19:48] It's like Charlie, you know, he's like, I need a reference that's a little bit more

[19:51] contemporary than tech mobile.

[19:53] Jetsons looks neat.

[19:55] It's definitely not a pin for the hardcore pinball guy.

[19:59] But for families and for a simple pin that families can put into a game room, I think Jetsons

[20:05] is going to do just fine.

[20:06] I think it's such a warm and inviting theme.

[20:11] And the game looks decent.

[20:15] You know, I mean, look, I can't judge it against like a dialed in.

[20:20] I think it's, they did a really cool job creating that Jetsons universe under the glass.

[20:25] There's not a lot to shoot for.

[20:26] There's not a lot going on in the game.

[20:28] It's very simple.

[20:29] It's very basic.

[20:30] I love hearing that Jetsons music as you're playing.

[20:34] It definitely needs a lot more call out.

[20:36] So there's like no call out.

[20:37] So there's like nothing from the show felt coded into the game yet.

[20:42] So hopefully that comes soon.

[20:44] But look, I think I think families who are looking for a pinball machine, where are you going

[20:48] to go get?

[20:49] It's not much out there.

[20:50] So I think Jetsons will do decently for them.

[20:53] And they don't even have to.

[20:54] They're selling it.

[20:55] This is not a spooky game.

[20:56] They were contracted to make it.

[20:58] So whether it sells or not, it doesn't matter.

[21:00] Spooky's going to get paid for everyone they make.

[21:03] So it doesn't matter if the distributor can't move them.

[21:06] They're going to be in a good position.

[21:08] All right, let me talk about the other news that I'm hearing that is like, what the

[21:14] f is this?

[21:15] This one was the biggest head scratcher for me.

[21:17] So we all knew that Yop from Dutch was going to come here.

[21:20] He was going to talk to TpF.

[21:22] And this is like, OK, he better tell us what the f is going on with Vlabowski.

[21:28] From what I've heard, they don't have a solution yet for what's going on with the big Vlabowski

[21:33] and manufacturing.

[21:34] OK, so you don't have a solution.

[21:37] Instead, you're going to announce something that I think is a real mind-boggler.

[21:43] They're going to announce that they're making BOP 2.0 anniversary edition.

[21:48] I don't know if they're calling it BOP 3.0.

[21:51] It basically, I've seen the flyer.

[21:52] It's real.

[21:53] I think people posted the flyer on Pinside.

[21:55] This is what they're announcing that they're going to make a limited, there's a super

[22:00] L.E. version of it that I heard there's only going to be 25 units of that for $12,500.

[22:07] And they are going to make, I heard in total 100.

[22:11] So maybe there's like 100 L.E.s and then 25 super L.E.s for $12,500.

[22:17] I really thought they were taking the piss out of us and that was a joke.

[22:21] They were making fun of the 25 magic girl number and then the price was the same as Jersey

[22:25] Jack's collector's edition at $12,500.

[22:28] I thought it was all a joke.

[22:29] I was like, there's no way they're going to just announce BOP all over again.

[22:34] And it's true.

[22:35] And so I just, I can't make sense of this.

[22:39] I don't know who's doing the marketing over there for Dutch.

[22:44] But I think it's a questionable move.

[22:46] I think it's a questionable move.

[22:49] To go backwards with theme, to go back to BOP again, it just feels like, it's like they're

[22:55] re-skinning their old title as a deflection away from where everyone is at, which is where

[23:03] the fuck are my big Lebowski's?

[23:06] Like, that's what people want to know.

[23:07] I don't want to know that these guys worked on anything else other than figuring out Lebowski

[23:14] production.

[23:15] I don't want to know, or I don't want to feel like they spent money getting this new

[23:21] BOP to market when they should have spent money figuring out how to pay for the big Lebowski's.

[23:28] It is really, it is really not a good move.

[23:30] And I don't think people are going to respond positively.

[23:33] How can anyone give them money on this new BOP when there's people, all these people

[23:39] are still waiting for their Lebowski's?

[23:42] To me, the marketing move and to announce it at TPS, it doesn't make sense to me.

[23:49] I think what we're seeing at the show is you either come here with games in box that

[23:54] are real and you have real news and you have a real plan for production or you're just

[23:59] coming here with marketing spin.

[24:02] And the marketing spin is just not going to work anymore because there's just too many

[24:05] options.

[24:06] It's like when I go into a restaurant in New York City and they do something stupid or

[24:11] they're rude, it's like you don't understand.

[24:13] There's so many restaurants, I'll never come back.

[24:16] When a pinball manufacturer burns its bridges with consumers now, they're not just going

[24:20] to come back to you because they're starving for pinball because that's starvation for

[24:25] something new and pinball will be satiated by the six or seven other manufacturers making

[24:30] games that will happily give consumers a product and not have them go through hell.

[24:38] So I think Dutch has a hole to get out of and I am curious to see what people ask them

[24:45] in the seminar and what the response is going to be.

[24:47] But Canada thinks it's a bad move.

[24:51] I think they're looking towards the past and it's almost like a Batman 66 approach.

[24:57] Let's reskin our old title and charge more for it and people will do it.

[25:03] I think they probably looked at some of that behavior by Stern.

[25:06] They're not going to be able to pull it off.

[25:07] I don't think they're going to sell those machines.

[25:09] A few people will buy them.

[25:11] I was joking with people.

[25:12] I'm like, you know what the sad part is, they'll probably sell everyone and just once again

[25:16] improve that pinball people are emotionally driven and simply can be separated from their

[25:23] money with very little, very little proof that stuff will be real.

[25:27] Alright, so that's what's going to happen with Dutch.

[25:28] We're going to hear this Bob announcement today.

[25:30] Alright, I finally got to play Alien.

[25:32] I finally got to play it.

[25:34] I played it at one in the morning.

[25:39] Everybody was gone.

[25:40] They actually was right after they said like T.P.F. is close for the evening.

[25:43] I ran over.

[25:44] I ran over.

[25:45] I ran over to the movies and I got to play about five games on Alien.

[25:48] What are my thoughts?

[25:49] I'll say this.

[25:50] The game looks cool.

[25:53] When you walk up to Alien with the lighted side art and the lighted decals on the inside

[26:01] and the LEDs going in the big screen, I mean Alien has a visual presence.

[26:06] I believe pinball should have, it's like a block away.

[26:10] Pinball machines should look good from a block away.

[26:13] girl would be the sexiest pinball machine in this joint if you were here. From a block

[26:17] away, magic girl is like, wow, alien has that block away quality where like it pops,

[26:24] right? And I give kudos to the team for making a game that pops. So I got to play it.

[26:30] And the first thing, you know, there's, I felt bad for them because when they're unboxing

[26:34] them, one of them shipped and the glass shattered during shipping. And that's, that's nobody's

[26:39] fault. It's, it's a shipping nightmare that we all hope we never, we never encounter.

[26:44] But man, it was so sad seeing them vacuuming out the glass from a machine. There's no,

[26:50] there's no image worse than seeing a vacuum cleaner hose going all over a brand new pinball

[26:56] machine. I think that sucked. So, and there's one gate. So they have three games set up.

[27:01] And one of them doesn't have glass inside the cabinet because of that. But so look,

[27:06] here are my thoughts. And I think the game is, it's a wide body, you know, and I, I'm

[27:11] just not a fan of wide body games. I, when people, people keep coming up to me and being

[27:16] like, well, it plays fast. I don't know if it was the game I played, but it doesn't play

[27:22] fast. Wide bodies just don't play fast. I played Hobbit. Jack has a hobbit set up here.

[27:28] Hobbit plays in slow motion next to dialed in slow motion. The ball on a wide body,

[27:34] it just seems to float. And same thing was true with Alien. I can already hear like,

[27:39] Hilton being like, you didn't set it up right. I played the machine. They set up highway

[27:44] and coin taker set this machine up. And here's the thing. The legs were all the way. They

[27:50] were down. So maybe if it was steeper, it would play faster. So I think maybe the legs

[27:54] in the back need to be jacked up. I definitely think the flipper power though was really weak.

[28:01] That needs to be jacked up. The ball kind of floats. It kind of floats up the playfield.

[28:07] And again, that can probably be solved, but the game they had was playing pretty slow.

[28:12] There's the alien head in the screen. Look, I don't like these LCDs just thrown on.

[28:19] There's one on Houdini as well. It's like, it just feels like this creative afterthought

[28:24] when you just start dropping these screens arbitrarily into the game. It doesn't fit,

[28:30] right? When you're trying to create this world of scale, these screens just seem out of place.

[28:34] I think the screen on the playfield for highway really works. The big screen in the back box.

[28:39] Yeah, again, it looks cool from a distance when you're playing the game. You're not looking

[28:44] up at it. You don't need to look up at it. It's there to draw people in, but for you guys

[28:50] who are wondering, should I order it with that in it? If you want to attract people or

[28:55] make the game more attractive from a distance for spectators, then yes, get it. If you're

[29:01] like, I just want to play this. I'm a player. I don't care about. I'm not an operator.

[29:05] I'm not trying to make this thing look beautiful in location. You don't need it. You really

[29:09] don't need it. It serves no purpose when you have that nice screen on the playfield for

[29:13] you to look at. The game to me feels like aliens. It doesn't feel like alien. The first

[29:19] film just doesn't come through in this the way it just feels like the second and the

[29:24] callouts, like from packs and all that. All the second film stuff jumps out at me. I don't

[29:29] get the feeling of the first game. The music is great. It's really hard to start multi-ball.

[29:36] I was watching people play and I was playing it for a while. We must have hit that alien

[29:40] head, the target in front of the alien head so many times. It's screeched. The mouse started

[29:44] to move. So we kept getting closer and closer and closer, but we can never get the ball

[29:48] to be grabbed. They need to code that differently. They need to make it more like Sparky. It needs

[29:53] to be more like five shots to that and you're getting the ball locked and it's getting grabbed.

[30:00] It takes too long. It takes too long. You don't want your main toy to be too hard to engage

[30:05] and see it do the fun stuff. That's what pinball is about. It's supposed to be fun. The alien

[30:11] tongue coming out and grabbing the ball is fun. It should happen much more frequently in

[30:15] the game. I don't think it happens enough. It was also hard to hit that shot to get up

[30:20] there. That's why I don't think we see a lot of the alien head working on a lot of the

[30:24] gameplay videos we're seeing because it's just not the easiest shot. It's a wide body.

[30:31] It's just more room for error trying to hit that shot. What else do I think? The outline

[30:40] drains on the left. I'm not a fan of. It's just why. That save feature on it. It just

[30:48] doesn't seem to work. It's very clunky. The way the ball, I guess if it goes in a different

[30:53] direction when it hits those posts, I don't like that. The game is pretty brutal as it is.

[31:02] It reminds me of Wizard of Oz with that state fair with the balloon that outlaying there

[31:10] where it spells. Is it Toto? I'm just, no, the Toto is number. The left outlaying drain

[31:16] on Waz is the same way. You design it and then you make this mini game inside that drain

[31:23] area that's supposed to save the ball. I hate that because the player can't control it.

[31:29] You have to nudge the machine to move the ball. I wouldn't have designed that outline

[31:34] to be that way. The Playfield art, I didn't have a problem with. I know there's all the

[31:39] hoopla about it. I still prefer a hand draw on artwork to what we saw there. It plays

[31:46] like a wide body. I think it sounds great. The alien theme is there. The alien movie,

[31:53] the original movie. I just don't get that sort of same feeling as I do when I watch those

[31:58] films at all with this game. It just definitely feels more like the second film is coming through.

[32:05] It's wide body. I prefer standard body games. I do think this game should have been standard

[32:10] body. I think highway locked into this wide body format is going to learn the same lesson

[32:15] Jack learned is why make the game slower? Why make the game wide body unless you're going

[32:23] to jam a bunch of stuff in? When I look down at alien, I just don't see the reason for

[32:27] the wide body. There's not like there's so much under the glass that they need it to

[32:32] go wide. The same was true with Hobbit. If you took both alien and Hobbit and even Wizard

[32:37] of Oz and you made them standard body size games, the games would be better. The games

[32:43] would be more fun. The games would be faster. The reason I say that is because Jack learned

[32:48] his lesson and Dialding plays so much better than Waz and so much better than Hobbit, not

[32:55] because it's not just because it's Pat Lawler design because it's faster. It's faster.

[33:01] Let's go to Dialding next. Dialding was here. Jack brought two versions. I came into the

[33:05] show at around it was like 130. I ran in and Jack was here and I was talking to him.

[33:11] When you join in the podcast, I got a dialed in and I ordered. I want you to join the show.

[33:16] And Jack says, let's do the show right now. It doesn't work like that. Jack, I'm not going

[33:21] to just do the show right now with a microphone in your face. I want to do it where you call

[33:27] in to Skype and it sounds good and I get to ask you questions. And there's not a lot

[33:32] of background noise. I don't like interviews at shows. I don't like interviews with

[33:36] there's a lot of background noise. So Jack will still see if he comes on the show. I

[33:41] might just drive out to Jersey and do the interview with him in person. But Dialding looks

[33:46] great. It looks good. It still plays like Dialding. It's the game I remember from Expo.

[33:51] I still think out of all the new games, it looks the most plentiful in terms of things

[33:56] to do. The game shoots phenomenally well for a standard body game with so much going

[34:02] into it. Dialding is incredible. Waller knows how to make games flow, knows how to pack

[34:09] in tons of toys and tons of fun stuff. The thing I noticed though with Dialding too is

[34:14] like the screen. You just can't look up and see what's going on. You need more visual

[34:21] cues on the game itself to know what to do. Now that's what I'm not saying that the

[34:26] game doesn't have those on the Playfield visual cues. I don't think you really need

[34:30] to look up often. I got to the mode words like emoji attack. There's all these emojis

[34:35] popping up and you have to hit certain shots to pop the emojis and get them off the screen.

[34:40] That was pretty cool. I sucked. I got in and gave it with emojis. I think it was hit

[34:45] the left ramp. But it's a very, very smooth game. It's going to be interesting to see the

[34:50] response when the game finally ships. I think people love Dialding. I think the response

[34:55] is always very positive for it. I also think Jersey Jack games in general, they really need

[35:00] to be experienced in the home environment. You really can't get into the game. Get immersed

[35:05] by the game at a show. I think in the home environment Dialding is going to be really popular.

[35:13] The only question mark I have because the design is there. The toys are there. The tech

[35:19] is there. The shots are there. Everything that I want is there. Will it emotionally grab

[35:25] me? Will I care about saving Quantum City the same way I care about defeating Stay

[35:32] Puff Marshmallow Man? Will I feel the same way about hearing the Tron music? Will it get

[35:38] my blood going the same way the bowling alley does in Big Lebowski? Will it pull me in

[35:46] emotionally? That is yet to be seen because emotions are heavily tied to themes. It's

[35:55] the reason why you can't walk around this show without people saying Star Wars. Star Wars.

[36:01] Star Wars makes everyone feel like a little kid. When you hear that Star Wars theme song,

[36:07] you're there. You're in that galaxy far away that everyone loves. Dialding can't take

[36:12] you there. It can't transport you to an emotional feeling you had when you were a kid. Star

[36:19] Wars can. Ghostbusters can. These 80s themes that people love can do that. That's going

[36:27] to be the real question mark with Dialding. Can the game be good enough to become emotionally

[36:34] gripping? We know that that's not an impossible thing. Medieval madness. I'm trying to go down

[36:42] like original themes that have done it before. I think John Papadouk's old games. These

[36:47] are games that became classics that are original themes. The jury is still out on that. I think

[36:51] Dialding looks great. As of now, I'm still keeping my deposit in. I think all things change

[36:57] when Star Wars gets revealed and announced because I think I do. I think so much money is

[37:02] going to head towards Star Wars. It's not even funny. Let me go down the list of other

[37:06] stuff. When I saw in the events of T.P.F. Dennis Norman, another home run from Dennis

[37:13] Norman, I thought they were talking metaphorically. Metaphorically, home run. Dennis Norman was

[37:19] going to show Elvira. I have some bad news for all of you guys out there. They are not showing

[37:25] Elvira. Elvira 3 is not being revealed at T.P.F. Elvira 3 is not going to be shown on

[37:31] PowerPoint. We're not seeing Elvira 3. Elvira is a Cassandra. She's here. That even

[37:38] more strange that she would be here. There's no Elvira pinball machine going to be here.

[37:45] That sucks. I know you guys were waiting to see Elvira 3. I thought the home run from Dennis

[37:50] Norman was going to be Elvira 3. No, it's actually a pitch and bat baseball game that he's

[37:56] been working on. There's two versions of it. There's regular baseball, which looks like

[38:01] normal baseball. There's a zombie version of baseball with the artwork by Zombie Yeti. Yes,

[38:07] I'm not making this up. I know you've seen the photos on Pinside. It takes me a little

[38:14] while to process that there's a new pitch and bat. The price, though, is great. Everything

[38:23] now feels great if it's less than $6,000. I believe it's $4,900 for the zombie version

[38:29] and $4,700. Is it $4,700? $4,700 for the zombie version and $4,500 for the regular?

[38:37] But look, it looks cool. If you want a pitch and bat in your collection and you want a new

[38:41] one with fun zombie artwork, zombie baseball, not exactly what I expected, but it looks

[38:49] cool. I like the size of the pitch and bats. That's what I like. I think a pitch and bat

[38:53] to me is a perfect game for an office or for a home office or at work. When you don't

[38:59] want to take up a full footprint of a pinball machine, the size of a pitch and bat really

[39:03] works well. But it's kind of a neat novelty item. It's not really pinball, but kind of

[39:10] pinball, right? So we'll see. I think they'll get some interest in it. It won't make it

[39:16] into Canada's living room, but I love anything Zombie Yeti does. I really think that he could

[39:23] draw anything and I would be somewhat interested in acquiring it. So I don't know. At that

[39:30] price point, it doesn't seem too bad. Flash Gordon is here assigning autographs. So if

[39:36] you guys are Flash Gordon fans, you really wanted to be here. That was funny. He's got

[39:40] like a nice booth at the front set up. And he's here for, he's also going to walk away

[39:46] with a Flash Gordon game that's hooking him up with that. So that was really cool seeing

[39:49] him next to that. P3, I'm going down a list of other stuff at the show. P3 has five games

[39:55] set up. I haven't had a chance to jump on them yet, but I always saw people playing it.

[40:00] And I think Nate hit it on the head with our last podcast. It's really going to be interesting

[40:05] to see if it's pinball enough, if the market will be there for him. I do feel that it's going

[40:12] to be harder for Jerry to move units based upon just the competition. When you walk around

[40:18] and see all these games coming out and he's coming out in the middle of it, at a price

[40:23] point that it's fairly high, but I'll give him this. It's different. It's different

[40:29] than everything else out there. And if you want something different, then P3 definitely

[40:35] is much more unique than anything that anyone else is bringing out. We keep saying the

[40:40] same sort of style of pinball. But the reason why people keep coming out with a similar

[40:44] type of game is that's what sells and that's what people want. So it's really an uncertain

[40:50] market and category if P3 can be successful. But I'm glad Jerry's shipping. I think everyone

[40:56] said, like, finally, finally, Jerry's at a show with his games and the games are going

[41:01] to consumers and production is starting. If it started two, three years ago, do I think

[41:07] P3 would have sold a lot more in that climate? Absolutely. Absolutely. I do think the market

[41:13] is really crowded. I think it's really going to be hard for all these new guys to be successful

[41:18] and to find customers, especially with Star Wars, especially with themes like Alien. The

[41:26] power of the theme. I can't highlight how important a theme is. A theme just, again,

[41:35] it makes people give money away. We were talking amongst a group of us at the pin-side

[41:42] meeting-grade. Yes, I attended the pin-side meeting-grade. I talked to Rob in for a long

[41:46] time. It was a great time. It was a great time. It was really a lot of friendly people there.

[41:53] The theme is going to make people want to go in on it. It's hard to deny the power. The

[42:01] thing we talked about at the meeting-grade was people will spend $5,000 on Lego Star Wars

[42:08] figures, Lego editions of the Death Star and the different ships. Go for $5,000. What

[42:15] can you charge for Star Wars, Ellie, and Star Wars Super Ellie, $15,000, $20,000 easily,

[42:23] easily. The rumor, I hear I'm all in with Star Wars at the end. I'm not going to say with

[42:27] the rumors until the end of this podcast. Let me go back to what I was talking about with

[42:31] P3. It's starting to ship. We'll see. I think there's a lot of options. I think it's going

[42:36] to be tough. What else did I see at the show? Total annihilation. Scott's game is freaking

[42:42] awesome. Awesome. It is the best sounding pinball machine I've ever heard, easily, without

[42:47] a doubt. The best sounding machine ever. Whoever is out there, Stern, JJP, they should ask

[42:54] Scott, how did you get your game to sound so damn good? We need to make our next Stern

[42:58] sound this good or our next JJP game sound this good. It is that awesome. Scott's going

[43:04] to come on the show. We were talking. I'm like, just come on the show. Let's talk about

[43:07] it. He's not going to start building these. He's not going to start building them. If a

[43:12] manufacturer out there wants to build total annihilation, I know he's on board for that.

[43:18] Game is freaking cool. The story of the game is that you're an evil villain and you're

[43:23] trying to destroy it this world and try to light. I think it's the nine nuclear reactors.

[43:29] If you light all nine, then you create total annihilation. I mean, saying it's really

[43:35] cool because if you get there, you yourself also die. Even if you beat the game on ball

[43:40] one, you get to watch balls two and three plunge with your inability to flip because you're

[43:45] dead. It's sort of like an out of body experience. But man, the game sounds freaking cool. The

[43:49] light show is cool. It just goes to show pinball to be fun. Can have a simple layout with

[43:57] just a lot of awesome lights and music. Man, that game pulls you in. When you crank it,

[44:05] the audio pulls you in like nothing else. I think a lot of time, too, these pinball companies

[44:09] forget. They forget that art and music will pull people in faster than anything else.

[44:17] So your game better sound good and it better look good. If you don't do that, then you're

[44:22] not going to have a really immersive experience. Scott did all this work himself. I'm like,

[44:26] who coded it? He's like, I coded it. I did the music like holy shit. There is a talented

[44:31] man. And I love it. Scott is like a young dude. Scott should be at Stern. Scott should be

[44:36] at JJP. Scott should be at highway. I'm so, you know, the old, cramogen designers, they're

[44:43] everywhere. Do we need another old pinball designer bringing ideas that he had 30 years

[44:48] ago? No, we need guys like Scott at the helm at more of these companies. Young guys who

[44:53] understand what's freaking cool. Like total annihilation would get in like the young audience.

[44:58] You want to get the young audience in? You're not going to get it with Jetsons. They don't

[45:02] give a shit about Jetsons. Jetsons does not get a teenager excited. EDM music gets people

[45:09] excited. Total annihilations, the kind of game. I was like, man, these young kids would

[45:13] want to just like, they would just, it just, it sounds like the music they're into today.

[45:18] It's contemporary. It's fucking cool. I love it. I love it. Batman 66 is here. Marko's

[45:27] got the big set up with Aerosmith. I have to say Aerosmith is the best bang for the

[45:31] buck. By far, the best bang for the buck in pinball is Aerosmith pro at like $5,200. It's

[45:40] just drop the mic. There's nothing else. Nothing else comes close at that price point. It's

[45:46] cheaper than Jetsons. Let me repeat that. Aerosmith pro is cheaper than the Jetsons. It's cheaper

[45:54] than Domino's pinball. It, that's ridiculous. It is the best bang for the buck. The game

[46:00] is fun. I'm not an Aerosmith fan. I do think that the game has some like that, the layout

[46:08] in certain areas. Just little head scratching like where the pop bumpers are. Just always

[46:13] annoys me. It just looks very barren there. There's something about it that just looks

[46:17] barren. When I compare Aerosmith, even the Ellie and the premium, when I compare it to

[46:21] Ghostbusters, no way. No way. Ghostbusters still just feel so much more exciting. It has

[46:28] a lot more going on. That, that doesn't mean like, I don't like Aerosmith. I just think

[46:33] Ghostbusters and I want to say this point too. Ghostbusters is aging really well. Ghostbusters

[46:38] is turning out to be a keeper. Ghostbusters is the one pinball machine I regret selling.

[46:44] I regret selling my Ghostbusters. Ellie, I'll say it right now. It should have kept it.

[46:48] That game is going to hold up over time because they really just knocked it out of the

[46:52] park with creating that Ghostbusters world. It still feels like Ghostbusters is, is got

[46:58] more going on than, than the other machines. So I, I think people who have Ghostbusters

[47:02] are going to want to keep them. And if you have an Ellie, I would not let it go. I just

[47:06] wouldn't let it go. And especially next to Batman. I, I loved my conversation with George

[47:10] Gomez. I still can't walk up to Batman 66 and see, and see like the Batman world, the

[47:20] way I want to. It still feels barren. Again, next to Ghostbusters, next to Dyle then Batman

[47:26] 66 just feels barren. That, that's the, that's the best word I can use to describe it.

[47:32] And Latknip Brett, he brought his super Ellie. And I, I, I, I talked to other super Ellie

[47:37] owners at the show. And I, I have to say, man, super Ellie owners, they're kind of like

[47:43] magic or owners like, you know, they're very defensive on, you will, you have to be because

[47:48] you can't defend the price. There's nothing about Batman that really warrants it being

[47:55] $15,000. You just can't, can't justify it. You can't justify it. I could justify

[48:00] magic girls price more than Batman's price. At least when you stand in front of magic

[48:04] girl, it blows you away, like visually blows you away. You will not get that same sort

[48:10] of pop with, with Batman. So I, I think that super Ellie guys are like still sort of scratching

[48:15] their head at 15 grand for that game. But let's, let's talk about Pimball refinery. They're

[48:21] here. I love Pimball refineries work. They, they will make your Batman into a super Ellie

[48:28] almost version. They'll give you the sparkle armor. They'll give you the red pen stripe.

[48:33] You can make your Batman Ellie look freaking incredible for thousands for more than five,

[48:41] seven thousand. You can, you can take your Batman premium and dress it up and make it

[48:46] look like a super Ellie-ish, right? Not, you still won't get the beautiful decals on

[48:51] the side, but they make the game look incredible. So if, if you want a Batman, I would get a

[48:56] premium. I would send it to Pimball refinery and they would make it sing. I would buy the

[48:59] topper from Stern. And I don't, do they sell the topper separately? Because I do think

[49:04] the Batman toppers must have. Like if you can't buy it separately, then you'd have to,

[49:08] get a Batman Ellie and send it to these guys and you can get to the super Ellie's look

[49:13] pretty quickly. What else is going on? So Star Wars. I got it, I'm going to end this

[49:17] with Star Wars because it has everybody talking and I, it has me talking. It had, it had me

[49:22] bringing loads of cash to try and bribe distributors. But it turns out I didn't have to bribe

[49:28] distributors because it turns out that distributors aren't really bribe a ball or at least not,

[49:34] they don't like canada bribe them because then they might fear I might go on the podcast

[49:37] and reveal them for their, for their criminal ways. But look, distributors can't take money

[49:42] on a game until it's announced. So nobody took my money. But there's a lot of really

[49:46] nice guys out there. I have to give a shout out to JJ at Game Exchange, man. This guy is awesome.

[49:50] JJ, I love you. Thanks for joining us at Dinner last night. Thanks for talking to me about Star Wars

[49:56] or, you know, or, or that game in another galaxy because he couldn't talk about Star Wars.

[50:01] These guys are professionals. They really, they do respect Stern's policy. They won't take

[50:06] money. They're not going to like bump people out of line to, you know, with cash. I respect

[50:12] JJ so much. I respect what they do. And I know that he has interest in Star Wars. Every

[50:17] distributor has a list for Star Wars. And there's something wrong with taking a list.

[50:20] Look, we, we, we can't take your money. We'll put you on a list. Same thing happens at

[50:23] a car dealership. I'm number one on the list for a Dodge demon. They even take my money.

[50:28] I'm on the list. Doesn't mean I'm going to get my game, right? They might decide to sell

[50:31] to somebody else. That's just life. That's the way it is. First world problems if you don't

[50:35] get your pinball machine, right? But Star Wars is everyone talking. Here's what sucks.

[50:40] We are not going to hear Star Wars announced anymore on May 4th. That is not going to happen.

[50:47] I think that is a huge mistake, a huge mistake, not not to be part of that day. It's like

[50:53] when alien missed aliens day. And I know that this decision kind of, it kind of came within

[51:00] Stern's marketing. They, they want to still get people excited about the existing titles.

[51:04] And in their heads and look, they're right. It doesn't matter when you announce Star

[51:08] Wars. It's going to sell like a mofo, right? You could announce Star Wars on 9-11. I

[51:13] mean, that's a bad reference. But you could announce it on a tragic day. And people would

[51:19] still order it. There's like, there's no day that people wouldn't say take my money on

[51:23] Star Wars. But the reason why I think it's a shame is you do want to be part of the fanfare.

[51:29] Because here's who doesn't know about Star Wars pinball. Star Wars fans don't know. Only

[51:35] pinball people are aware that this thing is coming out. And by this time, the Star Wars

[51:39] fanbase catches on, this game will be sold out. See, that's the crazy thing. The same thing

[51:45] happens with Batman. The guy who bought my Batman for $12,000 is a Batman fan. He didn't,

[51:51] he's on a pinball collector. He's not a pinball fan. He wasn't aware that this was even

[51:55] happening. So by the time he wanted one, they were sold out. So I think you want to be

[51:59] part of that day. I think May 4th is a day where national media are all over it. What

[52:04] a missed opportunity for Stern pinball to be in the national spotlight with all that

[52:10] media coverage because I'll tell you this, nothing freaking cooler than a Star Wars pinball

[52:15] machine. It's cooler than any Star Wars toy. It's cooler than any Lego set. It's cooler

[52:20] than anything except for maybe a movie trailer for episode 8. But, but how cool would it have

[52:26] been on the 40th anniversary? There's a new pinball machine coming out from Stern that

[52:31] captures the original three films that you love. So I think that's a missed opportunity.

[52:36] Wow, I'm at 52 minutes, 53 minutes at this podcast. Wow, so let's day one of TPS, right?

[52:43] I don't know how much more news we're going to hear today at the show. I think I've already

[52:47] covered what we're going to hear, right? I already know what the Dutch news is. I already

[52:50] told you guys what spooky game three is. I'll close this by saying I love TPS. I love

[52:55] being here. I can't believe I'm up so early drinking coffee. Everyone's still sleeping.

[53:00] It feels like when you're in college and you're up on a Saturday morning early on, right?

[53:06] And nobody's up. I sort of like it. I'm a morning person. I'd rather be up early playing

[53:11] pinball right now than be up to two in the morning playing pinball. I just don't like being

[53:18] up too late and feeling groggy the next day. And a lot of guys are drunk and hung over.

[53:24] I just love watching people shovel like the worst food imaginable into their faces as

[53:28] they're drinking beer and then playing pinball. It starts out good. Then you just feel like

[53:33] shit at the end of that journey. But that's it. TPS 2017. Lots of new stuff being announced.

[53:41] Lots of great fun at the show. I recommend you guys to come to this show, to go to any

[53:46] pinball show if you're a fan of pinball because it's very rare that you can turn to the

[53:50] guy to your left and turn to the guy to your right and start talking about pinball and

[53:54] they actually know what you're talking about. When you do that out in the real world,

[53:57] at a normal restaurant or bar, people are like, what the fuck are you talking about,

[54:01] Jetson's pinball? What? Anyway, that's it for Canadian sort of day one recap of Texas

[54:06] pinball festival. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed this podcast and do me a

[54:10] favor, guys, because I talked to Robin about this. We talked about like, I was like, Robin,

[54:14] I think I've turned to corner and I want to be more positive. And if I came back on

[54:17] pinside, I guarantee I will stop the personal attacks. I will do it. It's the moderators

[54:22] that won't let me back on. So if you would like Canadian to have a presence on pinside and

[54:28] we could talk about this, it'd be fun to be able to talk about my podcast on pinside,

[54:32] right? Talk about my videos on pinside, not be banned at the mention of my name. I saw

[54:37] someone post it about my Nate interview and they deleted it from Nate's thread. Really?

[54:43] And I asked Robin, I'm like, are you guys even listening to these interviews? They're

[54:48] really good interviews. They should not be deleted or people shouldn't be unable to post

[54:55] links to them. I don't get that. So I told them, look, I'd behave. But guys, do me a favor.

[55:01] Hit up your pinside moderators and say, look, he's a changed man. We all can change. And

[55:08] he'll be a positive member of the community. And I will sign a contract. I will sign. I'll

[55:13] be like, if I personally attack anyone, you can boot me off the site or maybe give me like

[55:19] three personal attacks against Hilton a month. And after three, then I can't do anymore.

[55:23] Now I'm just joking. But anyway, guys, enjoy, enjoy your weekends, enjoy the news coming

[55:28] out of T.P.F. I'll probably come out with another podcast maybe tomorrow morning again when

[55:34] I'm up early from my flight back to New York. But I hope you enjoyed this and we'll talk to

[55:38] you guys real soon.
