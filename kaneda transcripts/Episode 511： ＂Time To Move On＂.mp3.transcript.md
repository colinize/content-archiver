[00:00] Are we done?

[00:03] Are we done talking about Deep Rude Pimball not showing up to their own reveal with anything?

[00:10] You know what point?

[00:12] Do you guys stop asking the questions of whether or not this technology will add to Pimball?

[00:18] The only question you need to ask is where's the assembly line people?

[00:23] Who's gonna build these games?

[00:25] Right?

[00:26] Pimball's a manufacturing industry.

[00:29] It's not a design industry.

[00:32] They're called Deep Rude Studios.

[00:34] They're not called Deep Rude Manufacturing, but Stern's a Pimball manufacturer, so is

[00:40] Jersey Jack, so is American Pimball.

[00:43] And I'm sorry, but if you want the respect from all those other companies that you talk so

[00:48] much smack about, you gotta show up with something.

[00:52] You can't tell everyone else their outfits are ugly, then you show up to the party naked?

[00:59] You know what I'm saying?

[01:01] And I don't know about you, but this has made all of us have a newfound respect for all

[01:07] the Pimball companies out there.

[01:09] And it's time we turn a page, because that thing is done for a while.

[01:16] We don't want to hear from Robert and Deep Rude until they have a working game.

[01:21] It's all about guns and roses, Jersey Jack Pimball coming up in a few weeks.

[01:26] People, are you ready?

[01:27] Are you ready?

[01:28] Let's kick things off.

[01:29] Oh, welcome to the only Pimball podcast that refuses to sign any NDAs.

[01:42] Yeah, we're going to disclose how we feel all times on Canadian Pimball podcast.

[01:47] So here's what I want to talk about.

[01:48] We're going to put what happened earlier this week behind us, because I think it's time

[01:53] that everyone in the community just realizes one thing.

[01:57] When you're debating everything from the pin bar to the technologies to the titles,

[02:02] it doesn't matter.

[02:03] None of it means anything.

[02:05] The only thing that matters in Pimball is manufacturing.

[02:09] That's it, because what good is all of this design?

[02:13] If there's no one to make it, people, you have to understand that.

[02:17] None of it matters.

[02:18] And the only thing none of you have seen is a manufacturing line.

[02:22] And what happens when you go visit Stern?

[02:24] What happens when you go visit Jersey Jack Pimball?

[02:27] But why are these companies encased in these humongous buildings that feature predominantly?

[02:33] 90% of everything is the manufacturing line.

[02:36] So what happens when you walk through Deeproot Studios?

[02:39] Are you seeing a manufacturing line?

[02:41] And here's the thing.

[02:42] Here's the thing.

[02:43] I just feel that it's time that everyone just lets it go.

[02:46] It's time to move on.

[02:47] The only time that we should ever hear from Deeproot again, and I'm not saying like we

[02:52] might never hear from them again, but the only time we should hear from them again is when

[02:56] they have a working final machine, right?

[02:59] So there's that.

[03:00] But most importantly, the only time we should hear from them again is when they can prove

[03:05] to us that they can make these things, manufacture them, and have them in box.

[03:10] It is beyond that point.

[03:12] It is beyond that point.

[03:13] And I think the silver lining and all this, I just have to say it.

[03:16] I think this entire fiasco has brought the community together like never before, right?

[03:24] Like we're all allies now against a common ridiculous moment in Pimbal.

[03:29] And I'm seeing like all these personalities that usually never agree on anything.

[03:35] We all agree that this was a fiasco.

[03:38] And it's unfortunate that the very people who got the witness it, the six souls that went

[03:43] down there can't say anything.

[03:45] I mean, it's amazing.

[03:47] It's amazing how they were all reading from the this week in Pimbal website.

[03:51] Like this is the script.

[03:52] We got to stick to it.

[03:53] It's like, okay, I get that you're reading what you saw.

[03:56] But how did you feel?

[03:58] What did you think?

[03:59] Can you even formulate an opinion?

[04:02] It's unbelievable.

[04:03] I really enjoyed Zach Mani when he was interviewing Chris, the correspondent, because Zach was

[04:09] asking him like the tough questions.

[04:11] And it was amazing watching him try to answer.

[04:13] It's like Zach would be like, true or false.

[04:16] Did you guys convince Robert to delay the reveal?

[04:19] And he's just like, let me just tell you a long story because I can't answer a true or

[04:24] false question because I'm under NDA.

[04:27] So it's brought us all together.

[04:29] The other thing this is done.

[04:30] And I don't know about you, but this is how I feel.

[04:32] The other thing this is done, I think this is given everyone in Pimbal a new found respect

[04:38] and admiration for every single company that is able to get it done.

[04:43] And I mean that.

[04:44] I mean that.

[04:45] I mean, think about it like this for a minute.

[04:47] Tom Papaduke went over to American Pimbal.

[04:50] He brought them his version of Houdini, which was as J-Pop does best a completely physical

[04:58] and possible game to make.

[04:59] Like literally it's just like there were ball directions that went into the middle of nowhere.

[05:03] Okay, so what happened?

[05:05] American Pimbal realized that J-Pop's design was not going to work.

[05:08] They get rid of them.

[05:10] And in eight months people think about this.

[05:12] In eight months, Joe Ballsor joins the team and gets that game into a box and into

[05:18] people's homes.

[05:19] They made Houdini in eight months.

[05:22] They made it.

[05:23] They manufactured it.

[05:25] They ordered all the parts.

[05:27] Everything you needed to do to build the Pimbal machine.

[05:30] They learned how to do it and they got it done.

[05:33] It's been three to five years at Deep Root.

[05:36] It's been at least three years since Ross has been worked on eight months.

[05:40] So I respect you, Joe Ballsor.

[05:42] I respect you, American Pimbal.

[05:44] Chicago gaming company.

[05:46] They get it done.

[05:47] Stern Pimbal.

[05:48] You don't even have to say Stern Pimbal gets it done.

[05:50] My God do they get it done.

[05:52] Jersey Jack Pimbal gets it done.

[05:55] And these institutions, if you go into them, are manufacturing institutions.

[06:00] And again, I can't reiterate enough.

[06:03] The only images we didn't see were anything that resemble a manufacturing line.

[06:09] So until that happens and until we see their ability to do that, I am not, I'm not going

[06:14] to give this company any more time to discuss stuff.

[06:18] Like I'm here to talk about people's Pimbal machines.

[06:21] I'm not here to talk about your PowerPoint presentation.

[06:25] That means nothing.

[06:26] Anyone can make a PowerPoint presentation, but only a handful of companies can make Pimbal

[06:31] machines.

[06:32] And then the learning for them, the learning for them is you can't go around making fun

[06:38] of all of these companies who have executed, who have delivered game after game after game.

[06:44] At the end of the day, he should have, they should have, and we all should show those

[06:49] companies respect who get it done.

[06:52] I mean, seeing this reveal on Monday, almost made me respect October Fest.

[06:56] It did.

[06:57] It almost made me respect October Fest.

[06:59] I didn't quite get there.

[07:00] I didn't quite get there, but it almost made me do it.

[07:02] Okay.

[07:03] So deep root studios, if you're listening, the next time we want to hear from you, you

[07:07] got to prove to us, you can manufacture any other, any other statements, any other story,

[07:13] any other excuse is not going to fly.

[07:16] And that's it.

[07:17] Gotta go quiet now.

[07:18] Gotta go dark into the night until you can figure it out.

[07:20] All right.

[07:21] So this is why this is it.

[07:22] That chapter's closed.

[07:23] I don't even want to talk about it anymore because you know it's about to happen.

[07:26] This whole thing has distracted us from the reality of the fact that we are just a few

[07:31] weeks away from Eric Minier's softmoric title, Guns in Efron Roses from Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[07:37] And you know how I feel about it.

[07:40] You know how he feels about it.

[07:41] And I think right now, considering what we all went through this week, this is needed

[07:46] now more than ever because we are going to see, we are going to see all you need to do

[07:52] to make an amazing Pimbal machine.

[07:53] You don't have to reinvent everything.

[07:55] You don't have to change the box.

[07:56] You don't have to give me a leveling system.

[07:58] Just give me a kick ass Pimbal machine based on a kick ass theme with a kick ass layout,

[08:05] kick ass call outs, kick ass sound system.

[08:07] Kick ass like the whole thing is going to kick your ass in a good way.

[08:11] And you're going to see it and you're going to be like, this is awesome.

[08:13] It's just an awesomely cool Pimbal machine.

[08:15] It's not going to arrive in PowerPoint format.

[08:18] It's not going to arrive under NDA.

[08:20] We're all going to be able at the same time to say how excited we are for this game or

[08:25] if we're not, right?

[08:26] If you don't like it, you can also say that we're not going to be there like unable to express

[08:31] our opinions.

[08:32] And so I am so excited for this title.

[08:35] You know that.

[08:36] And so my Rick and Morty is sold.

[08:37] It got picked up today.

[08:39] Rick and Morty number 50.

[08:41] I enjoyed it.

[08:42] You got my review on it.

[08:43] I'll say this, the game held value.

[08:45] I sold the game.

[08:46] It went to a great owner in Pennsylvania.

[08:49] Great guy picked it up this morning.

[08:51] Fast Eddie came here.

[08:52] Fast Eddie is the greatest man on planet earth.

[08:54] He wraps machines like nobody else.

[08:57] And we blanketed it.

[08:58] We made sure everything was safe.

[08:59] We put it on the back of the truck and off she went.

[09:03] And now the space is clear for guns and effing roses.

[09:08] Now I have to be honest, I may not put guns and roses in this apartment.

[09:12] I may wait to Brenda and myself and Bubba find a new home.

[09:17] Now I'm not looking like right away, but I'll tell you this, moving a pin in and out of

[09:22] this one bedroom apartment is a pain in the rear end.

[09:25] And I'm not sure I want to do it again.

[09:27] Now I'm here to tell you this right now.

[09:29] On day one, I will have a collector's edition of Guns and Roses.

[09:33] I'm still shocked that Jersey Jack Pimball and Eric aren't just saying, look, it's available.

[09:38] It's GNR and we're going to do what Spooky did.

[09:41] Give a date at a time in which the CES go on sale.

[09:43] I guarantee you they could sell all 250 of Eric's soft mark effort without even seeing

[09:49] it.

[09:50] I bet you they could do it.

[09:51] And I'm just here to tell you right now, when you put guns and roses side by side with

[09:55] Rick and Morty, it's, I mean, we're not even talking apples to apples here.

[09:59] People, I'm just saying, I'm just saying and Rick and Morty gets really expensive when

[10:04] it's 9,500 bucks when you got all the options ticked.

[10:07] Okay, but here's, here's what I want to do right now.

[10:09] Here's what I want to do right now.

[10:10] I want to get you excited about this machine.

[10:13] And I think some people have been asking about guns and roses.

[10:17] Is it popular?

[10:18] Is it mainstream enough?

[10:19] And I think you guys are crazy.

[10:21] You're crazy.

[10:22] Like you don't understand the power of guns.

[10:24] This band is a mega band.

[10:26] There's very few mega bands in the world that have sold over 100 million albums, right?

[10:31] Who have go on world tours and make hundreds to millions of dollars.

[10:35] And these are global phenomenon bands.

[10:37] These aren't just like local acts, okay?

[10:39] This isn't like Imagine Dragons.

[10:41] This is like a band that's going to be like in the culture forever, right?

[10:45] And there's very few bands like that.

[10:46] I mean it.

[10:47] Their music stays around forever.

[10:49] You still turn on a football game in 2020.

[10:52] You're going to hear Welcome to the Jungle.

[10:53] Like that's incredible.

[10:54] You're not going to hear like Imagine Dragons in 20 years, 25 years.

[10:58] You're just not going to hear it.

[11:00] All right, not I don't know why I'm saying Imagine Dragons.

[11:03] Like, you pinball people or Imagine Dragons fans.

[11:06] So what I want to do for you right now is we know one of the things we do know about

[11:10] guns and roses is that there are 22 songs in the game.

[11:14] And I'm not sure exactly which 22 songs there are in the game, but that is incredible.

[11:20] And I'm hoping there's going to be footage from the live concerts.

[11:22] But what I want to do right now to get you excited.

[11:24] For guns and roses, I want you to hear what I think are going to be the 22 songs in

[11:31] G and R. Now, I also think like if you're a grown man and you want a pinball machine,

[11:36] that's adrenaline pumping that gets you going.

[11:38] That's actually music that grown men listen to this ain't no pure imagination crap people.

[11:44] This is what pinball should be revolved around.

[11:48] All right, are you ready to rock?

[11:50] Let's do this.

[11:51] You know what the fuck you are?

[12:01] You and the jungle baby, wake up, time to die.
