[00:00] CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA

[00:03] Good morning everybody, welcome to Cenedis Pinball Podcast, it's 6.15 in the morning, I'm

[00:10] just getting back from the gym, I went at 5.30 this morning and I'm really excited about

[00:16] today because we're gonna get to see Jaws, the 50th anniversary of Stern Pinball's Keith

[00:23] Alwin game.

[00:24] Now, what I wanna do on this episode, this is just kind of a mini-episode, I'm not even

[00:28] I'm not even gonna label it an episode.

[00:30] Notice there was no intro song.

[00:32] It was just the Canadian intro.

[00:33] I just wanna give you some thoughts

[00:35] as we head into today.

[00:36] Obviously, I'm gonna do another show

[00:39] after the game is revealed.

[00:41] I probably will do a live where we can hang out

[00:45] and look at the game and discuss it on YouTube

[00:48] when we see the game for the first time.

[00:50] But I just wanna give you my thoughts going into today.

[00:53] What I think this means, Stern releasing,

[00:56] much anticipated, I will say, a sort of expected move.

[01:01] They've been making anniversary editions now for a while.

[01:05] They did one for Batman.

[01:07] They did one for Elvira.

[01:10] They did one for Jurassic Park.

[01:12] They did one for Godzilla.

[01:15] And so now we have this new milestone.

[01:17] It is the 50th anniversary of JAWS.

[01:20] And the world has been celebrating this anniversary.

[01:23] I've seen lots of JAWS, 50th like memorabilia,

[01:26] and anniversary items launched into the world.

[01:30] They waited a little bit.

[01:32] The anniversary was like June 20th.

[01:35] So July 4th weekend makes sense in the movie.

[01:39] Isn't it like the 4th of July weekend

[01:41] in which the shark is attacking the beach?

[01:44] So what do I expect from this game?

[01:47] Well, we know the game is gonna be a premium.

[01:50] We know the price is not gonna change.

[01:52] So it's gonna be very much like Godzilla 70th.

[01:55] Now, the big question everybody has,

[01:58] what will the cosmetic changes be?

[02:01] And will they make this game look nicer

[02:05] than the Ellie version of the game?

[02:09] Do you think Godzilla 70th is nicer looking

[02:13] than Godzilla Ellie?

[02:15] There are those that think that, I don't know.

[02:18] I mean, Godzilla had that whole controversy

[02:21] around the back box lighting and the CPO, was it?

[02:25] And it didn't quite look black and white

[02:27] when you looked at the trans light.

[02:29] I don't think this game is gonna have any sort of

[02:32] like black and white version.

[02:34] It doesn't make sense.

[02:36] The movie was not in black and white.

[02:38] But then someone on my Facebook page was like,

[02:40] well, Kaneda, Elvira had the blood kiss edition,

[02:44] which is a black and white game

[02:45] where they highlighted all the red items.

[02:47] But Elvira was not a black and white show.

[02:51] So it could go either way.

[02:54] Look, I don't think it's gonna be black and white

[02:56] for an obvious reason.

[02:58] Jaws is all about the blue ocean and the shark.

[03:01] They're not gonna mute out the blue of that play field.

[03:05] I think what I'm super curious about,

[03:07] and I don't think they're gonna do this,

[03:09] is Stern gonna make any artistic changes to the play field?

[03:15] We know they're gonna make it to the cabinet.

[03:18] We also probably would expect to see

[03:21] the iconic movie poster art on the Translight.

[03:25] So I don't think they're gonna change the Translight

[03:28] from the Ellie or the pro.

[03:30] What I wanna see in this game is them paying respect

[03:33] to the original movie and the movie poster.

[03:37] Now that's the thing is like the Jaws cabinets

[03:40] are all illustrated.

[03:42] So do you think they're gonna use more

[03:45] of the iconic movie poster,

[03:47] Allah James Bond, when they released the 50th?

[03:51] Are they gonna have an all new illustration

[03:53] or will they rearrange the existing artwork

[03:57] that was already created and slap a 50th logo on the cabinet?

[04:03] I hope it is something completely original,

[04:06] but I hope the Translight is the iconic movie image

[04:10] everybody remembers from the poster,

[04:12] but that's not the big question.

[04:13] The big question is, will they change

[04:16] the play field artwork somehow?

[04:18] Will they enhance it?

[04:19] Cause in my honest opinion,

[04:21] if they make the play field a little bit nicer

[04:24] or add new elements,

[04:26] that then does make this a new sort of limited

[04:32] edition version of the game

[04:34] because the Ellie play fields are the exact same

[04:38] as the premium.

[04:39] So if we think about it through that lens,

[04:42] then yeah, I don't expect them to change it.

[04:44] I really don't.

[04:45] Cause I think Stern is very nervous and very cautious now

[04:50] when they do these anniversary editions

[04:53] that they're not gonna piss off the Ellie owners.

[04:57] We know this game is not gonna come with a topper.

[05:00] It might have exclusive accessories

[05:03] that go along with the 50th.

[05:05] Remember there was also, I forgot this,

[05:07] there was James Bond 60th.

[05:08] That was another anniversary edition.

[05:11] Remember James Bond 60th had like

[05:14] an exclusive shooter knob that was probably way too expensive

[05:18] for the bill of materials.

[05:19] And so here's why I think this game

[05:21] is gonna do well for Stern.

[05:23] And I think today people are gonna be excited

[05:25] because unlike a lot of pinball releases

[05:29] where we get to see the game for the first time,

[05:31] we're not sure if the game is good or not.

[05:33] Right now, everybody knows Jaws is a pretty damn good game.

[05:38] Like it really is a damn good game.

[05:41] And you're releasing Jaws 50th on the 4th of July weekend.

[05:46] A pretty damn good time to release Jaws 50th anniversary.

[05:51] Now what I would like to see Stern do

[05:53] is really knock this out of the park.

[05:56] The one thing I'm really surprised Stern hasn't done

[05:59] in a long time is make a super limited edition version

[06:05] of the game.

[06:06] Remember they said they're never gonna make more

[06:08] LEDs of an LE they already made.

[06:11] But man, oh, man, oh, man.

[06:13] If this was not the time to make only 50 units

[06:19] of a Jaws 50th anniversary SLE,

[06:23] give it all the bells and whistles,

[06:25] give it the 3D embossed glossy cabinet artwork,

[06:28] give it an exclusive topper, think about it.

[06:32] They could release Jaws SLE 50th

[06:36] and sell it for 20 grand and sell every single one.

[06:40] And they haven't gone back to the SLE well

[06:43] in a really long time.

[06:45] And I think Stern and the marketing department over there

[06:48] needs to revisit this.

[06:50] Because in the end, they really,

[06:53] every time they tested the waters to see

[06:55] if there was a market for an SLE game,

[06:58] they sold every single one.

[07:00] So why would they walk that back?

[07:02] Because you're not screwing over the LE buyer of Jaws

[07:07] that paid 13 when you made a thousand of them

[07:10] if you make only 50 of a $20,000 version.

[07:15] And what you should do maybe is you could open it up

[07:19] to those initial buyers in some sort of a lottery system.

[07:24] And if you bought an LE, you could enter the lottery

[07:27] for a chance to buy one of the SLEs.

[07:30] And guess what?

[07:31] Out of that thousand buyer base,

[07:33] you absolutely would find 50 buyers at 20K.

[07:37] And nobody would argue that.

[07:38] Nobody would say that's not a fair way to do it.

[07:41] Because in the end, you gave everybody a shot

[07:44] who was an LE buyer and they all got a fair chance

[07:47] at the lottery.

[07:48] And if I'm Stern, turn these SLE lottery nights

[07:52] into like a great moment to celebrate.

[07:56] We're gonna put everybody's name in a hat.

[07:58] We're gonna pull them out live.

[07:59] We're gonna do a whole stream of it

[08:01] and really, really celebrate the creme de la creme

[08:05] of your product.

[08:06] Not gonna do it.

[08:07] Didn't hire Kaneda as the CMO.

[08:10] Not sure what he's doing yet.

[08:12] Haven't heard from him yet.

[08:13] Have you?

[08:14] If I was the new chief marketing officer over at Stern

[08:17] and I don't know him,

[08:18] but I would do something public facing.

[08:21] This entire job is about you connecting

[08:25] with the pinball community.

[08:27] Have you heard anything from him?

[08:28] I mean, gosh, we know there's a marketing job over at JJP.

[08:33] I've been talking to Brett about cars.

[08:35] Maybe I should say, hey, Brett, hey, Brett,

[08:37] how'd you like to actually do this thing

[08:40] on the real, real, on the professional?

[08:42] I mean, you know, you know,

[08:45] if I was in charge of marketing

[08:47] at one of these pinball companies, you'd feel it.

[08:49] You'd see it and you'd appreciate it.

[08:51] You know the things I would do would be

[08:54] to the benefit of the community,

[08:57] getting people excited in the right way.

[09:00] Nobody really does much.

[09:02] They just think the product's gonna speak for itself.

[09:05] And sometimes that's true.

[09:06] Sometimes you need a little bit extra sizzle.

[09:09] All right, so we're gonna see Jaws today.

[09:11] Most likely sometime at noon Eastern Standard Time or 11.

[09:16] I feel like these things always come out

[09:17] an hour before we expect them.

[09:20] We're gonna see that game.

[09:22] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[09:24] Harry Potter's are landing left and right.

[09:26] I'm still not seeing reviews

[09:28] that are changing my mind about the code.

[09:31] People are now starting to talk about cosmetic upgrades

[09:34] and stuff like that.

[09:35] I don't know.

[09:36] I wanna see how people feel about Potter

[09:38] after they bang on it for a couple months.

[09:40] That's when we're gonna know

[09:42] if the game is really as great

[09:44] as these early adopters are saying.

[09:47] I wanna congratulate Barrels of Fun.

[09:49] They've got Dune number 100 on the line.

[09:53] That's good.

[09:55] I heard from Spooky Luke.

[09:56] They are around 300 units of Evil Dead have been made.

[10:02] So that's also really good news.

[10:04] You see how it is a slow trickle though, people.

[10:07] It's not like Stern when Stern announces Jaws 50th,

[10:11] they're gonna send a thousand or two out the door

[10:14] in one month, in one month.

[10:16] And I think Stern needs this.

[10:18] I'm curious to see how this game sells

[10:21] because Jaws didn't sell as well

[10:24] as I think they thought it would.

[10:26] And King Kong's not selling well at all.

[10:28] I mean, the fact that this game's coming out right now,

[10:30] I mean, I think there's gonna be more enthusiasm

[10:32] for Jaws 50th than there is for King Kong Premium.

[10:36] The big issue with King Kong is his arms are falling off.

[10:40] Stern, you can't release a King Kong game

[10:44] with a masturbating King Kong and his arms fall off.

[10:48] How is he supposed to get off if his arms fall off?

[10:51] It just doesn't work.

[10:53] And the other big issue with Kong,

[10:54] and I think this is why Jaws 50th excites me,

[10:57] I think the games need to look different.

[10:59] There's a reason why Jaws LE is bolted to the floor

[11:04] because it looks so good and looks so much different

[11:08] than the LE and the Premium.

[11:10] And you make King Kong LE look exactly like the pro.

[11:15] Jeremy Packer, zombie Eddie, fan of the show.

[11:18] I think he's still a fan of the show.

[11:19] Jeremy, come on.

[11:21] You're the chief art director now at Stern, right?

[11:25] I don't know what the official title is.

[11:27] You now need to make the call, brother.

[11:30] If you did the art, you can't put your incredible LE art

[11:35] on the pro.

[11:36] Dude, you gotta sandbag the pro version of the game.

[11:40] You gotta stop thinking every version needs to look amazing

[11:44] because here's why.

[11:46] If one version is six grand and one version is 13, bro,

[11:51] the $13,000 version needs to look twice as good

[11:55] as the $6,000 version.

[11:58] A damn pro shouldn't look great.

[12:01] It shouldn't.

[12:02] A pro is meant for location.

[12:04] It should just have the title of the game on the side.

[12:07] I don't wanna spend 13 grand and then look over at my buddy

[12:12] that spent half as much.

[12:14] Hey, why does Jimmy have the same cabinet artwork as me?

[12:18] He didn't spend 13,000.

[12:20] It's time to wake up, hire a marketing guy

[12:24] that knows what the market wants.

[12:26] I'm not in need of a job, by the way,

[12:28] but I just think it's funny

[12:29] that none of these companies get it yet.

[12:31] They really don't get it.

[12:34] And it's not like intelligence I'm seeking in them.

[12:38] It's common, freaking sense.

[12:40] Let's see this game today.

[12:42] Come hang out with Kaneda and take care of your bodies

[12:45] more than your pinball machines.

[12:47] Get to the gym, take care of your mind,

[12:49] your body, your families

[12:51] before you invest in these games.

[12:52] I mean, I'm seeing the huge amounts of money

[12:55] people are spending on these machines

[12:58] and I'm not hearing as much.

[13:00] Do you hear from D&D people?

[13:02] Don't hear much, right?

[13:03] What happened to that game?

[13:04] These games come out, people bang on them.

[13:07] And like most games, after a few months,

[13:10] you get kind of over them.

[13:11] But man, this is not a $60 Xbox game.

[13:15] It's a $13,000, $10,000, $7,000, $15,000 proposition.

[13:21] And before you even knew you loved the game

[13:23] before the code was done,

[13:25] you fully committed to paying a price.

[13:28] That's insane.

[13:29] Let's talk to a friend about Tron Ali.

[13:31] I'm like, you know why everyone loves Tron Ali?

[13:34] There's only 400 and it was only like 5,500 bucks?

[13:38] If Tron Ali came out today for 15 with all the accessories,

[13:42] do you love it as much?

[13:44] Is it that much more fun?

[13:46] No, thank you for staying with Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[13:49] It's July 2nd, which means you made it through another month.

[13:53] I really appreciate it.

[13:55] Our numbers have gone down, I won't lie.

[13:57] At the height, at the height we were at 740,

[13:59] now we're like at 670 something.

[14:02] I don't know, you know, I don't know what to do anymore.

[14:03] I don't know what to do.

[14:04] Maybe I should do some more interviews,

[14:06] but also I would love it if each and every one of you,

[14:09] and I mean this, each and every one of you

[14:11] could invite a friend onto Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[14:14] Think about it, how many of you out there

[14:17] have a pinball friend?

[14:18] You could invite them and now you could actually give them

[14:22] the gift of Canada and for some of you out there,

[14:25] your friends might hate me.

[14:27] So that would be a funny gag gift.

[14:29] Hey, I just got you a year subscription

[14:31] to Canadian Pinball Podcast, 60 bucks.

[14:35] And you know what?

[14:36] You don't have to listen, but you can.

[14:37] Here's your login.

[14:38] That would be the greatest summer gift.

[14:41] You could give a pinhead.

[14:43] Everybody, Canada out, more coming today.

[14:45] Peace.

[14:46] Gaaaaaar!
