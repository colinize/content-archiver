[00:00] If you feel like me then, I'm not gonna make you sleep, but soon you'll be fine. You can run, you can hide, but you can't speak my love.

[00:30] Now I'm gonna tell you right now, it's not that good, and there's a reason why Axl Rose did not release this material like 20 years ago.

[00:46] And if you think Pimball fans are suffering through high prices, you should join the Guns N Roses message boards.

[00:53] These people have been tortured all of these years waiting for these songs, and there's a reason why these songs never made it to the world.

[01:03] And I'm just gonna say this, I was once friends with Bumblefoot, the lead guitarist of Guns N Roses, and when I did my Doctor Pepper program where we offered everybody in America a free soda,

[01:14] if Axl Rose would come out with Chinese democracy and we made it happen, I once had a conversation with Bumblefoot.

[01:22] What does all the unreleased Guns N Roses material sound like? And he said, Chris, it's just as unrelatable as everything that's on Chinese democracy.

[01:33] It was the most honest response I've ever heard from somebody, so you're gonna hear a nine minute song that is just pretty terrible at the end of this podcast,

[01:43] but don't ever say, Canadian Pimball Podcast didn't give you stuff for your five bucks a month.

[01:48] And speaking of five dollars a month, let's give a quick shout out to our new club members.

[01:52] We've got Shane, we've got Bob K, we've got Paul M, we've got Sandeep M, we've got Andrew Martin, we've got Adam M, Robert H, and B.

[02:03] B, just B, just letter B. I love it when people join this podcast and they just don't even give their full name.

[02:09] I wanna give an extra special shout out to Sandeep because your friend said to me, give him an extra special shout out for joining the show.

[02:18] So welcome to Canadian Pimball Podcast. I'm not gonna lie. I was at lunch today with Brenda.

[02:23] Last night we went to see Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias, and Pitbull at Madison Square Garden, and it was absolutely incredible.

[02:31] I mean, this is what life is about, people. If you don't think for a moment, when you see a $2,000 stern topper that is flat plastic,

[02:40] and then you had a night like we had last night and it's everything, and it probably costs near $2,000.

[02:47] I'm gonna tell you right now, you should fill your life with moments that you will never forget with the people you love.

[02:55] And these Pimball machines have become so expensive, and they become so ridiculously expensive that each machine in itself now,

[03:04] and each accessory like a $2,000 topper, a $15,000 machine, it's not just a Pimball machine anymore.

[03:13] It's a decision. It's a decision now. Do you wanna have another Pimball machine that you don't really need,

[03:20] or could you do something with that money that would absolutely change your life, that would give you a moment that you would never forget?

[03:29] And that's where I'm at with all of this right now, and I've been saying this, I said it earlier on my Facebook Live.

[03:34] The Pimball pricing is out of this world. It's now at a point now where the games themselves have so much pressure to live up to the cost of these machines,

[03:45] and they're not gonna deliver, and that's the thing, is most of these games cannot deliver the value.

[03:51] They cannot deliver the value and the experience for $10,000 to $15,000.

[03:58] Like that is a trip to Japan that will change your life.

[04:02] If you've never been to Japan and you're gonna buy a $15,000 Pimball machine, you should not.

[04:08] You should book a trip to Japan, spend three weeks over there, go to Kyoto and go to Tokyo, and absolutely change your life.

[04:17] Or you could buy another Pimball machine in which you already have a row of them, and what's gonna change in your life?

[04:23] Absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing.

[04:26] Alright, so on this episode of Canadians Pimball Podcast, what do I want to talk about?

[04:30] I'm gonna talk about Jaws, because I heard another thing that is really now concerning me,

[04:35] because I think Stern Pimball is about to do something that is absolutely moronic,

[04:40] and I think Stern Pimball is right now in a weird place.

[04:43] Like I think Seth Davis over there, I think he wants to really generate as much revenue as he can in a short term period of time.

[04:52] And I think he might take this company in a horrible direction.

[04:56] And what I mean by that is I think he's gonna start to burn everybody that believes in the company.

[05:02] And by believing in Stern Pimball, there has to be a simple principle of belief,

[05:07] that if you say to me, this is the limited version of this game, I believe you,

[05:13] that you're not gonna make any more of this game.

[05:16] And this is a sacred thing between company and consumer.

[05:20] And if they burn this, and they absolutely blow up what it means to be a limited edition of a game,

[05:27] and they keep making more versions of everything just to make more money,

[05:32] and just to give the newbies in the hobby a chance to get stuff that they missed out on,

[05:37] if they continue to do this, it will absolutely collapse the entire Pimball market.

[05:43] It'll absolutely collapse it, because what's gonna happen if this occurs time and time again,

[05:49] is that people simply won't buy anything new in box anymore.

[05:53] And they absolutely will not buy any of these Ellie machines of these games.

[05:58] And then what are you left with?

[06:00] You think you're gonna get tons of people to buy $10,000 premiums that are gonna lose $2,000 in six months?

[06:07] You're not gonna get a lot of people to do that.

[06:09] And Stern Pimball has a responsibility, I believe, to stay true to their word,

[06:15] and actually make it so that people who bought your Ellie's should be able to go to bed at night,

[06:20] and feel like you're not gonna make another version of their game,

[06:24] that is absolutely gonna destroy the value of their game.

[06:28] It's not about whether the game plays good or not.

[06:31] It's not about the enjoyment of Pimball.

[06:34] It's about a company saying, this is the last version of this game that will be limited,

[06:40] and if you buy it, this is gonna be the one collectors want.

[06:44] And I don't understand why people don't understand this principle.

[06:48] Why would you root for Stern to make more versions of Elvira?

[06:53] Why do you want them to make another version of Metallica?

[06:56] Why do you want it?

[06:58] Why do you want to destroy the very thing that makes the Pimball market healthy?

[07:02] If you destroy the collector aspect of Pimball, you will destroy it all,

[07:06] because it's not one version per game.

[07:09] And this industry has been built on a three-tiered model for like a decade now.

[07:14] And if you destroy that, and you take it away, it's all gonna collapse.

[07:18] It's gonna be a house of cards that comes down in 2024.

[07:21] Alright, so here's what I'm hearing is gonna happen, people.

[07:24] And I alluded to this on my Facebook post.

[07:26] I said something is gonna happen when Jaws comes out that is not gonna make buying in Elvira a smart move.

[07:32] So here's what I've been told is going to happen with Jaws Pimball.

[07:36] Jaws Pimball is going to come out in 2023, early 2024.

[07:42] And I'm hearing from a very good source that Stern Pimball has already approved a 50th anniversary of Jaws Pimball,

[07:51] which will be arriving in 2025.

[07:54] And that is going to be the SLE version of the game.

[07:58] So if you buy an Elle of Jaws this year, you are going to regret it,

[08:03] because there is gonna be a nicer version of Jaws that comes out in 2025

[08:09] as a 50th anniversary version of the game.

[08:13] They're gonna do the same thing they did with Jurassic Park, with Elvira,

[08:17] and they're gonna do it again with Jaws.

[08:19] They're probably gonna do it again with Godzilla as well.

[08:23] And this is Stern's, and they're gonna do it with Metallica, and this is Stern's new approach.

[08:28] So you're hearing it here first on Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[08:31] If I were you, I would not buy a Jaws LE, because they are gonna make a nicer version of the game.

[08:39] If you want to play the game with all of its features, here's what I would do if I were you.

[08:44] I think each and every one of us should send all of these companies a message.

[08:48] I wouldn't buy anything new in box.

[08:51] I would wait and buy a Jaws Premium used.

[08:54] If you want to collect this machine, if you love it, and you want to keep it in your stable for a long time,

[09:00] I would wait until 2025 to buy the anniversary edition of the game.

[09:05] And I'm telling you, it's gonna happen. It's going to happen.

[09:08] And here's the thing, I think more and more of us should start speaking up,

[09:11] and you should ask your distributors, is there gonna be an anniversary edition of Jaws?

[09:16] Let's make Stern Pimball tell us whether or not it's going to happen.

[09:21] Why should we allow this company to take so much money from us,

[09:26] and then not indicate to us whether or not this is the final top tier version of the game?

[09:32] That is a very fair question to ask.

[09:35] If you're gonna spend $13,000 on a game, shouldn't we know are you ever gonna make this game again?

[09:42] Are you ever gonna make another special edition of this game again?

[09:46] And I would not give a single dime to this company until they tell us yes or no.

[09:53] And the entire Pimball marketplace is now being defined by this kind of stuff.

[09:58] It's like they're just gonna keep making stuff over and over and over again.

[10:03] They're gonna milk the Pimball marketplace.

[10:05] And if you're a new in box buyer, you're a sucker now.

[10:08] I really mean it. You're a sucker now.

[10:10] You're a single game where you had to buy it new in box or else you would miss out.

[10:16] I think the last game is Godzilla, but nothing since.

[10:19] Absolutely nothing since.

[10:21] And trust me, with a thousand Godzilla's out there, you're gonna start to see

[10:25] Godzilla's be much more affordable as time goes on.

[10:29] You notice I'm hearing in Pimball, I'm hearing that Jersey Jack Pimball has some triple A themes in the hopper.

[10:36] Jack's been talking to people. Elton John is not one of their biggest themes.

[10:41] I'm here to tell you that Jersey Jack Pimball 100% has the license for the Matrix.

[10:48] The Matrix from JJP is coming.

[10:51] We know they have Harry Potter.

[10:54] They potentially have a Top Gun license that will not feature Tom Cruise.

[11:01] And just when we were counting them out, I'm here to tell you that they 100% are going to make a Matrix Pimball machine.

[11:10] And right all of a sudden, if you think about Eric Minier or Mark Saiden making the Matrix Pimball from Jersey Jack Pimball,

[11:19] finally they would use all of these lights for a really cool, like green and black version of a Jersey Jack game.

[11:27] And all of a sudden everyone's like, yeah, I would buy a Matrix sight unseen from Jersey Jack.

[11:32] Absolutely sight unseen, I would buy the Matrix from Jersey Jack.

[11:37] I would not buy Elton John.

[11:39] And I continue to hear reports from everybody that Elton John sales are just abysmal.

[11:44] They are not happening.

[11:46] And there's no way Jersey Jack Pimball is going to get people into this game.

[11:49] You know, but it's a weird place now for Jersey Jack.

[11:52] It's October of 2023.

[11:55] They just released Elton John and most people don't want it.

[12:00] So when are they going to release their next title?

[12:03] And if they've got these other titles in development, is this game just going to be like a blip on the radar for Jersey Jack?

[12:10] I think it is. Here's what I think is going to happen with Elton John.

[12:13] Not many people are going to order it.

[12:15] They're not going to make many.

[12:17] And the moment they move on to the next game, then everybody's going to want it.

[12:21] That's what happens in Pimball.

[12:23] If they say they're not making any more, everybody will want this pin.

[12:27] The moment everyone can have it, nobody wants it.

[12:30] That's the story of Elton John.

[12:31] Elton John, a sales failure.

[12:33] Galactic Tank Force, a sales failure.

[12:36] Labyrinth seems to be doing quite all right.

[12:39] I've been hearing great stories about the sales numbers of Labyrinth.

[12:42] It's not a theme for me.

[12:44] Happy Barrels of Fun got this game out in the right way.

[12:47] I look forward to seeing what they do next.

[12:50] But I'm just going to say this right now.

[12:52] At these prices, if you look at what's coming out in Pimball,

[12:55] Stern's got what?

[12:57] Jaws, then Dungeons and Dragons,

[13:00] and then maybe Pokemon and John Wick.

[13:02] Are these the themes you really want for this much money?

[13:06] This is going to be the reckoning in Pimball.

[13:09] People need to bring out stuff that absolutely excites.

[13:13] And I'm just not sure these are the titles everybody wants.

[13:16] Where are the AAA themes?

[13:19] All companies did this to themselves.

[13:21] They raised prices to a point now

[13:24] where each game needs to be a masterpiece

[13:27] based on a AAA theme.

[13:29] And that's not Pimball.

[13:31] That's not where this hobby has always been.

[13:33] It's always been like once out of every five titles,

[13:36] there's going to be a AAA theme.

[13:38] But now at these prices, they need every single game

[13:41] to be a AAA theme, or you're not buying.

[13:44] But the problem is this, is the distributors have to buy

[13:47] every single game, and they have to buy a lot of each game,

[13:51] or else they're not going to get those AAA game allotments.

[13:55] And that is what's going to sink all of these distributors.

[13:58] When I hear stories of distributors

[14:00] building new showrooms and new warehouses,

[14:03] and they're all scaling up,

[14:05] it's like scaling up right now is not the right answer.

[14:08] You need to be more discerning and more careful

[14:11] if you're a Pimball distributor,

[14:13] because you're going to be sitting on tons of inventory

[14:15] that nobody wants.

[14:16] And I'm already starting to see these distributors

[14:18] like blind calling people.

[14:20] They are blind calling customers.

[14:22] Hey, are you interested in a Venom?

[14:24] Are you interested? What's going on?

[14:26] That doesn't happen.

[14:27] That didn't happen in years prior.

[14:29] And now we're seeing like distributors put up holiday sales

[14:32] where they're taking $2,000 off the price of a game.

[14:36] And rest assured people, these distributors are not making money

[14:39] on these sales.

[14:40] They just need to get their money back.

[14:42] Like if you're selling a game for $2,000 off,

[14:45] that's the profit margin of a distributor.

[14:48] So they just need to move this thing on

[14:50] so they can free up space and free up money to buy a new game.

[14:53] I don't know. I'm at the point now, people,

[14:55] where like if JAWS is a flop,

[14:57] this is something we haven't thought about.

[14:59] Imagine if JAWS is not a successful launch at Stern.

[15:03] Imagine if the artwork is terrible.

[15:05] Imagine if like the layout is more of what Keith Elwin's been giving us.

[15:10] Imagine if there's no assets in this game.

[15:13] Imagine if you don't want to buy JAWS on day one.

[15:17] Just think about this scenario for a moment.

[15:19] Imagine if everybody in the pinball world did not buy JAWS new in box

[15:24] when they revealed the game.

[15:26] Imagine if we understood the power we have as a buyer base

[15:30] and as a community and we just said no and we didn't buy it.

[15:33] What would happen?

[15:34] Think about it for a minute.

[15:35] What would happen if we all just didn't buy the game?

[15:39] The price would come down.

[15:41] The distributors would have to sell it to us at a discount.

[15:44] So then it begs the question,

[15:46] why would we buy a game like JAWS new in box on day one?

[15:51] Why would we throw money blindly at these companies

[15:54] when it's crystal clear if we don't do that,

[15:57] all of us as a community could save money?

[16:00] And that is where we're at.

[16:02] I think that's where pinball is at for a lot of you.

[16:04] I think we're tired of the content creators that are distributors

[16:08] telling us to buy everything instantly.

[16:10] I think we're over the FOMO.

[16:12] I think we're over the pressure from them.

[16:14] I don't wake up every day and work really hard to make my distributor friends rich.

[16:19] That's not why I'm in this.

[16:20] That's not why I love pinball.

[16:22] I want pinball machines to be magical.

[16:24] I want them to give me themes where I don't even think about it.

[16:26] I do want to buy a game on day one because they nailed it.

[16:29] But I'm just saying right now, I don't think JAWS is going to nail it.

[16:32] I really don't.

[16:33] I don't think it's going to have any assets from the movie.

[16:36] I don't think it's going to nail it in the artwork department.

[16:39] And I don't think it's a game where I'm going to run at right away.

[16:42] I just don't.

[16:43] And I don't think JAWS is really going to be hard to get in any form.

[16:46] And now knowing that they're going to make a 50th anniversary of JAWS in 2025,

[16:51] there's no way I'm going to go near a JAWS LE.

[16:54] I'm absolutely not going to go near it.

[16:56] So you heard it here first, people.

[16:58] Canadian Spinball Podcast is telling you that Stern will release a JAWS 50th anniversary edition.

[17:05] And they will absolutely destroy the value if you buy an LE version of the game.

[17:11] And if this is not correct, then they should come out and say it's not going to happen.

[17:15] But they won't do it.

[17:16] They will never do it because they know it's happening and my sources are correct.

[17:21] Everybody enjoy this nine minute version of a Guns N' Roses song,

[17:26] The World Is Never Heard, and realize why Sweet Child of Mine, Paradise City,

[17:31] and Welcome to the Jungle is so damn good.

[17:34] And when Axl fired the entire band, he got songs like this.

[17:39] This is like the Guns N' Roses equivalent of Galactic Tank Force.

[17:43] It's what happens when you don't really have the right people around you.

[17:47] You drop crap like this into the world.

[17:50] Everybody, thank you for the support.

[17:52] More shows coming.

[17:53] Everybody have a great weekend and there won't be a Saturday morning spectacular tomorrow.

[17:58] I am traveling, so that will happen a week from tomorrow.

[18:01] Everybody later.
