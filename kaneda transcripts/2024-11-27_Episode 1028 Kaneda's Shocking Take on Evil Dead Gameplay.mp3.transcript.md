[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast, I'm your host, Canada.

[00:19] We got a few people here, some stragglers on Facebook right now watching the intro to

[00:23] this show on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:27] I'm gonna talk all about Spooky Pinball's gameplay of the Evil Dead.

[00:33] We got two videos, one where Bug was just playing and letting us see the game.

[00:38] I really, really appreciate that.

[00:40] There's nothing worse than seeing a game for the first time and having like the design

[00:46] team talk over everything you're seeing.

[00:49] It's like watching a movie and the director sitting next to you and just being,

[00:53] oh yeah, when we filmed this scene, we did this.

[00:54] And then in this scene, and it's like, dude, I haven't seen the movie yet, just let me

[00:59] watch the film first.

[01:01] So they gave us 20 minutes of uninterrupted gameplay and then they gave us a 20 minute

[01:07] version in which Bug narrated over what we were seeing.

[01:12] So I really did appreciate that.

[01:14] Everybody on Facebook right now watching, join Canada's Pinball Podcast to hear the

[01:18] conclusion of this epic pinball show.

[01:21] We do this three times a week, $5 a freaking month, people.

[01:26] Your cheapskates, if you're not joining the show, we'll talk to you later.

[01:29] All right, let's kick those guys out of this show and get on with this show.

[01:33] All right, so here's my thing.

[01:35] I woke up this morning and I watched both streams again because I did feel like last

[01:41] night I was a little bit buzzed.

[01:44] I was also like a little bit bummed out.

[01:46] I'll tell you why I lost my wedding ring sometime between Saturday and Sunday.

[01:51] I was doing gardening and raking up leaves and I have no idea where to even start to

[01:57] look for my wedding ring, but I'm still very happily married.

[02:00] So I was in a little bit of a cranky mood.

[02:03] And so I'm watching this game and I'm saying to myself, is the game floaty?

[02:08] Is this game exciting?

[02:09] Are there moments of wow in the game?

[02:12] And last night I was a little bit slanting towards it's floaty and what the heck with

[02:18] this theme.

[02:19] And then I watched it again and I wanted to get more, I wanted to get more of like an

[02:23] unbiased sort of like point of view on this game.

[02:26] And I want to start out this episode by saying this, I don't know how to overcome theme bias.

[02:34] And I think a lot of us have it and I'm not so sure that's a bad thing.

[02:39] And what I mean by theme bias.

[02:41] Like if you don't like the theme, like nothing is really going to get you excited about the

[02:46] game.

[02:47] And I've had that even with Iron Maiden.

[02:50] I don't like Iron Maiden music at all.

[02:52] So I don't really enjoy playing Iron Maiden Pimball.

[02:55] I can't get over the theme and the opposite also happens.

[02:59] I love guns and roses so much.

[03:02] The gameplay is horrendous, but I enjoy the game because I love the music so much and

[03:08] I understand like that's how it works.

[03:10] That's the way theme bias I think impacts most of us in Pimball.

[03:15] And so as I look at Evil Dead Pimball and I look at the fact that this game in such a

[03:20] great fashion takes Evil Dead one and two and serves it up to you.

[03:26] It gives you every moment from those two movies that you love.

[03:30] It gives it to you in spades.

[03:32] It integrates it perfectly into the game.

[03:35] Because things happening physically in the movie that become physical things in the gameplay

[03:40] and in the experience.

[03:42] And so if you love Evil Dead one and two, you are absolutely going to love this game.

[03:49] You are going to want to own this game.

[03:51] And you are very happy that Spooky Pimball is making these kinds of themes because nobody

[03:56] else will make it.

[03:58] And when I look at this game and I look at the gameplay, it's hard for me who doesn't

[04:03] like the movies.

[04:04] I just don't.

[04:05] I've seen them.

[04:06] They're okay.

[04:07] It's just not my kind of thing.

[04:09] Some people like this sort of cheesy horror like blood, gore, heads being bashed in, all

[04:15] the blood spilling out everywhere, terrible special effects.

[04:19] It's all so cheesy.

[04:20] It's all so bad.

[04:22] Some people love that.

[04:24] I know that the people over at Spooky Pimball, they love that.

[04:28] If you love that, I'm not going to make fun of you.

[04:31] I don't think you're wrong for loving that stuff.

[04:34] And so I think that this game is 100% a dream come true for Evil Dead fanatics.

[04:42] I think if you don't like these movies though, is there enough in this game to make you overcome

[04:48] your bias or your lack of interest in Evil Dead?

[04:53] And I don't think so.

[04:54] I don't think so.

[04:55] There's a lot of fun stuff in it, but I don't think this game is going to shoot as well

[04:59] as Iron Maiden, which made a lot of people overcome their lack of love for Iron Maiden

[05:04] music.

[05:05] I just don't see this game from a gameplay standpoint.

[05:09] Absolutely like blowing people away, right?

[05:12] Like Elton John's another good example where like you might not want to own the Elton John

[05:16] theme, but the Elton John gameplay is so damn good and so damn addictive.

[05:21] And I just don't know if what we saw last night is going to have that addictive gameplay.

[05:27] It's a very mode based game and the modes are awesome.

[05:30] I will say this where this game really shines.

[05:33] I want to give you where I think this game really shines.

[05:36] I think this game really shines in that when you start a mode, I love the fact that each

[05:41] mode feels like a moment of wow from the movies.

[05:45] The light shows are awesome.

[05:47] The sequencing in the modes is awesome.

[05:50] I love it when you start a mode and you feel like you're progressing through the scenes

[05:56] in the movie.

[05:57] I don't think the clips are muted.

[05:59] I think you're actually seeing what's happening with the actors in the movie in those scenes.

[06:05] And so that is really great.

[06:06] I love all that.

[06:07] The light shows great.

[06:08] I'm just going to go back and forth between things I saw, right?

[06:12] Things I, some things I liked, some things I was like, ah, I don't know about that.

[06:16] The call outs.

[06:17] I was worried about the call outs being monochromatic.

[06:21] And after watching the game, I'm still worried about the call outs being monochromatic.

[06:27] They just lack energy.

[06:29] I get that he's like narrating the game and you can put it in a mode where he's also like

[06:33] negging you as the player, but there's just no energy, right?

[06:38] It's all delivered so monochromatic, so deadpan.

[06:42] And I get that's like Bruce being Bruce, but I think it needed a little bit more ash, a

[06:48] little bit more excitement, a little bit more energy for the player because I do think

[06:53] it's going to get a little bit old over time with the call outs having such low energy.

[06:59] All right.

[07:00] So I wasn't a fan of that.

[07:01] You know, when it comes to the actual design and layout, they had the game set at an interesting

[07:07] angle because they wanted to show you all the stuff in the game.

[07:10] Um, look, I just don't know if there was anything I saw from a geometry standpoint that was

[07:16] like, wow.

[07:17] Like, I didn't really see crazy shots, crazy combos.

[07:22] There's that extra flipper, the sling flipper above the right sling.

[07:27] That was neat, right?

[07:28] It wasn't like a wow.

[07:29] It wasn't like the things it was shooting.

[07:31] We're doing something incredibly awesome.

[07:34] I bet it's fun to utilize that extra flipper.

[07:37] But when you watch the gameplay, it does feel like it has more of a wide body, wide open

[07:42] feel.

[07:43] So I don't know if it's floaty or not.

[07:46] Like sometimes I was watching footage and it seemed a little bit floaty.

[07:50] Other times it did not.

[07:52] Other times it seemed like there was a lot more speed and there was a lot more going

[07:55] back and forth between the ramps and stuff like that.

[07:58] I did love the way you play the game where you can sort of start a mode or get a mode

[08:04] qualified and then not started, hit the action button and you can still play the game and

[08:10] qualify other modes.

[08:12] So you can keep qualifying your modes and then choose which mode you want to do.

[08:17] I really, really like that.

[08:19] I love the fact that this game's got a very like choose your own adventure.

[08:24] No to game is going to be the same.

[08:25] So they give a lot of power to the player and it's not going to be boring and linear.

[08:30] When it comes to the actual modes themselves, again, this is where not loving the theme

[08:36] is hard for me because you know when they're like, oh, this is my favorite seed where he's

[08:40] like, Linda's head is like on his hand and he's bashing her head against the wall and

[08:45] I'm watching this and I could care less about everything I'm seeing.

[08:50] Again, but for those fans out there, that's probably an exciting moment in the movie for

[08:55] you.

[08:56] And you probably look at that mode with a lot more enthusiasm.

[09:00] When it comes to stuff like the music and the sound effects, I don't know, right?

[09:05] I think the sound effects were cool.

[09:07] I just didn't find the music to be that amazing.

[09:10] And again, the source material, if you go listen to the Evil Dead soundtracks, they're

[09:15] not good.

[09:17] These were movies made with a shoestring budget.

[09:20] It was not like they put a lot into the orchestration.

[09:23] So you're not going to hear like music that gets you going.

[09:27] And again, I think over time, that's why you really, really, really have to love these

[09:33] movies because I just don't think the game is going to get your energy levels up with

[09:38] this source material because the source material doesn't have that high energy thing going

[09:45] on.

[09:46] Elton John does.

[09:47] Avatar does not.

[09:49] Guns N' Roses has high energy stuff going on all the time.

[09:52] And that's the thing with Pinball, right?

[09:53] It's like Halloween suffered from the same thing with me.

[09:55] It's like when you play Halloween Pinball, it's such a slow movie.

[09:59] Same with Godfather.

[10:00] And again, Pinball to me is a high energy game.

[10:04] And so when you take stuff that's slower, and this is the thing with like scary movies

[10:09] and these spooky movies that these guys love, some of these horror movies, right?

[10:13] The movies themselves are all about the tension, the urgency to escape, something bad's about

[10:20] to happen.

[10:21] And then you get scared and something jumps out.

[10:23] It's really hard to create that kind of feeling in a Pinball machine, which is always going.

[10:30] It's always fast paced and high energy stuff is just more fun than sort of building that

[10:36] tension.

[10:37] Like a Pinball machine cannot scare you.

[10:39] I mean that.

[10:40] I think the only time I saw a Pinball machine scare people is when the Ghostbusters machine

[10:44] screamed out loud at midnight and people didn't realize that was in the game.

[10:49] It's the only time I think anybody ever jumped back from a Pinball machine.

[10:54] So that's sort of how I felt after watching the gameplay.

[10:57] The other thing I want to talk about on this episode is this.

[11:01] I don't like the fact.

[11:03] And this is me talking on behalf of you, the consumer.

[11:06] I think this was a smart move from Spooky and from Zack, who filmed the feature ad and

[11:11] everybody else and all the distributors who took your money last week.

[11:15] I just want to say this.

[11:17] These guys had gameplay footage ready to go on the same day they revealed the game and

[11:24] took money, but nobody got to see gameplay.

[11:28] So gameplay was strategically held back to get as much money through the door.

[11:34] And here's what they said is the reason why.

[11:37] Luke was like, look, we want Spooky fans to be able to be front of the line.

[11:44] So like we don't want to show gameplay.

[11:46] We actually want to reward the faithful who have faith in us and believe in our products

[11:52] and by not sharing gameplay.

[11:55] We're almost giving you just enough to know what the theme is and who it's coming from

[12:00] and what the art package is, but we're not going to show you like all the meat on the

[12:04] bones.

[12:06] And that way the Spooky loyalists will be the first ones to be the early adopters and

[12:12] order a game.

[12:13] That's their rationale.

[12:15] I can't argue against that.

[12:17] All right.

[12:18] It makes sense.

[12:19] It makes total sense that they do it that way.

[12:22] They locked in over 500 orders without showing gameplay.

[12:29] Now as a consumer, this is me standing up for consumers.

[12:34] I don't like pinball companies asking us to buy a game and not showing us gameplay.

[12:42] It is a game.

[12:43] You have gameplay.

[12:45] That is the most important thing to see is how the game plays.

[12:50] And I don't like sending in a nonrefundable deposit without being able to see how the

[12:56] game plays, what the assets look like, what the modes are like, what the shots feel like.

[13:02] You don't get any of that with those feature at videos.

[13:06] And so good move by Spooky from a marketing strategy to lock in money.

[13:11] And I guess there's over 500 evil dead and Spooky fanatics that it was successful.

[13:18] But I'm just saying moving forward, I will always hate this.

[13:21] I hate that Stern does it.

[13:23] I hate that Spooky does it.

[13:24] I hate that everybody wants your money today and you don't get to see the game.

[13:28] And by the time you see the game, you might not like it when you see gameplay.

[13:32] And that is why when I say wait and see, it's not just wait and see to buy the game.

[13:36] It's wait and see to make sure you like what you're seeing gameplay wise.

[13:40] So it was a smart move, but again, it just goes to show this is still kind of a little

[13:45] bit of FOMO in action.

[13:46] I know they've sold over 600 games.

[13:48] Is this stream going to sell them more games?

[13:50] It's funny because Luke was like, well, nobody canceled after the gameplay stream.

[13:55] I had to remind them that nobody can cancel because the deposits are nonrefundable.

[14:00] And this always happens with a new game.

[14:04] Everybody who ordered one is going to see what they want to see.

[14:07] They are going to say the game looks amazing.

[14:10] The skeptics right now are going to be quiet and they are out there.

[14:14] You just can't be a skeptic right now because you are kind of a jerk, right?

[14:17] If you come in to the Evil Dead buyers page or the hype page and you say you don't like

[14:24] this, this or this or the theme is bad or the game looks floaty.

[14:28] If you walk in there and you start complaining about a game, you're not even going to buy.

[14:34] You are kind of a jerk.

[14:36] You are a jerk.

[14:37] And I want to say this.

[14:38] There was a little bit of a jerk last night on my chat and I don't want to be a jerk.

[14:43] And I think they made a game for a fan base that loves this movie and these movies.

[14:49] I think they made a great theme integrated game that embarrasses what we're seeing from

[14:55] some other companies when it comes to theme integration.

[14:58] It might not be my cup of tea, but I respect those who enjoy this cup of tea.

[15:05] So this is going to be a successful pin for Spooky.

[15:09] Yes, personally, I would like them to make something a little bit more mainstream that

[15:15] appeals to me.

[15:16] I have faith in Spooky Pimbal that they will make a game that is my cup of tea, but I will

[15:21] not insult anybody that says they love this cup of tea and they can't wait to get their

[15:26] game.

[15:27] And I think there's too much of that.

[15:28] I do.

[15:29] I think there's too much of people just coming in and reigning on other people's parades

[15:34] and people not being happy for people who are happy because if you reach that point in

[15:38] this hobby where your soul existence is to be angry and to be upset that other people

[15:44] are finding joy in Pimbal, then it is time to find a new hobby and there's no place for

[15:50] you in Pimbal.

[15:51] My last point about the stream, why did they have a camera on the top or the whole time?

[15:57] It was so stupid.

[15:58] The topper does the same thing over and over and over again.

[16:02] It doesn't get any more interesting or more dynamic.

[16:06] It's cool.

[16:07] I love looking at it, but I don't need to stare at it over and over and over for 20 minutes.

[16:12] There's way too much prominence given to these damn toppers.

[16:16] I'm serious people.

[16:16] They don't matter.

[16:17] And hey, the flat plastic Christopher Franci topper looks really damn good because it's

[16:23] kind of like more artistic looking.

[16:25] I kind of like that just as much as the 3D sculpted one.

[16:29] I have to be honest.

[16:31] So overall, a beautifully theme integrated pin that is going to make Evil Dead fans happy.

[16:37] I don't think it's going to convert other people over to the game.

[16:41] I don't think it matters.

[16:42] I think Spooky knows they've got three to four more themes coming and they're going

[16:47] to have something for everybody.

[16:49] And again, I thank them for coming into my chat and being transparent and not acting

[16:55] like they're better than any of us.

[16:56] And I think it's the way to do it.

[16:58] I think this company continues to impress me and everybody else with how they approach

[17:03] us and how they treat us with respect.

[17:06] I mean that.

[17:07] I can't say enough good things about these individuals.

[17:10] I just wish they would pick themes that spoke to me a little bit more.

[17:14] Everybody have a great Thanksgiving.

[17:17] Enjoy the next few days off.

[17:19] I will most likely be back Friday with a show.

[17:22] Yes, we will have Saturday morning spectacular.

[17:26] I'm very thankful for each and every one of you.

[17:29] I'm very thankful for my wife who allows me to do this show.

[17:33] Yes, I say allows me because if she really did put her foot down, I probably wouldn't

[17:39] be doing this, but she absolutely loves this outlet for me.

[17:43] I'm very thankful for all my friends that I've met in this hobby over the years, even

[17:48] Ed Robertson.

[17:50] I'm very thankful.

[17:51] Phil Brandis has not subscribed to this show because it just reminds me there's still work

[17:57] to be done.

[17:59] I'm very thankful for all the people that go on pin side every week and share your feelings

[18:04] about pinball.

[18:06] Without doing that, it would be boring.

[18:08] I'm very thankful for all the men and women who work at these companies and make these

[18:12] games.

[18:13] It is really easy to be a critic.

[18:16] It is really hard to make a product.

[18:18] And those people that actually put their lives on the line and their livelihoods up and everything

[18:24] is at stake to make a great pinball machine, my hat is off to each and every one of you.

[18:29] You are really doing the hard work.

[18:31] This is the easy work.

[18:32] Being a critic is easy.

[18:34] Being a manufacturer and a maker of something is very hard.

[18:38] And lastly, I just want to say I'm thankful for all of you who subscribe and donate every

[18:41] month.

[18:42] I know, I know.

[18:44] The whole world is asking you to subscribe and you decide to be here.

[18:49] I really do appreciate that.

[18:51] And I'm going to make a joke.

[18:52] This is just a joke, but I'd be much more thankful if some of you would up your subscription

[18:57] amounts because damn it.

[18:59] You know, are we going to start to have Canada tariffs?

[19:01] You know, am I going to charge Canada tariffs for people who want to listen in Canada and

[19:06] in Europe?

[19:07] Everybody have a great day.

[19:08] Love you.

[19:09] Talk to you soon.
