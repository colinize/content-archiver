[00:00] Welcome everybody to Episode 1000 and something to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:28] I'm your host, Kaneda.

[00:30] It's been an interesting week.

[00:32] We've got Stern Pinball's Uncanny X-Men,

[00:35] a phenomenal game.

[00:37] One of Stern Pinball's best shooting games ever.

[00:40] The code is getting better.

[00:41] That game is gonna be just fine.

[00:43] If you have one, you know what I'm talking about.

[00:47] If you go to Expo and you play it,

[00:48] you're gonna feel this way about the game.

[00:51] We've got Jersey Jack Pinball's Avatar.

[00:53] Little bit of a different story there.

[00:55] Beautiful game.

[00:56] Maybe the most stunning pinball machine

[00:59] you will ever walk up to.

[01:01] I mean this.

[01:02] When you see the CE of this game in person,

[01:06] and you see that topper,

[01:07] and you see that beautiful art package,

[01:10] and just the overall details and presentation of Avatar,

[01:14] I'm telling you right now,

[01:15] when you walk up to it,

[01:17] it's gonna make you wanna own the game.

[01:19] It's that stunning.

[01:21] Then you play the game,

[01:22] and I think they've got some work to do.

[01:24] I think they need to code in a little bit more energy.

[01:27] A little bit more of the vibe of the movies.

[01:29] You know, you've got these epic battles to save Pandora.

[01:33] I'm not feeling it.

[01:33] I'm not feeling it.

[01:34] I don't want a diner menu of how to collect song notes.

[01:39] I wanna play these epic battles,

[01:41] and I wanna feel something.

[01:42] And that can be done with the software.

[01:46] And I think Jersey Jack is gonna hear the feedback,

[01:48] and now the onus is on them to make that game

[01:51] wake up a little bit, to make it the game.

[01:53] It can be.

[01:54] And the things they've done, they've done really well.

[01:57] It is absolutely a stunning, stunning game.

[02:01] And then we've got what?

[02:02] We're waiting for the next spooky.

[02:04] We're waiting for Metallica remastered,

[02:06] which nobody is talking about this week.

[02:08] I mean, the game's coming out next week, apparently.

[02:11] I don't know.

[02:12] Is Stern gonna hold it back?

[02:13] Are they gonna try to get more X-Men sales?

[02:15] It seems like it's really close to X-Men

[02:19] to get this game out the door.

[02:21] But you know, Stern, they gotta keep that big,

[02:23] bohemath going, and Metallica remastered,

[02:27] I think is gonna get a lot of newbies excited.

[02:30] The old guard of pinball probably either owns a Metallica

[02:35] or had one, and I'm not so sure it's gonna see

[02:38] like gargantuan sales, but I think it's gonna do just fine.

[02:42] I think we might see, it might not be Spike 3,

[02:46] but maybe we see the larger screen on this game.

[02:49] I don't know.

[02:50] I think they're still gonna hold back

[02:52] Spike 3, 4, King Kong.

[02:56] It just makes total marketing sense.

[02:59] Everything about us is getting bigger.

[03:02] No one else in the pinball world's got anything on King Kong.

[03:05] They're gonna have this larger than life monster game.

[03:09] What better time than to put a bigger King Kong size screen

[03:13] into the Stern platform.

[03:15] Everything's gonna be backwards compatible with Spike 2,

[03:18] and so it's gonna be a really interesting time.

[03:22] Dungeons and Dragons, not much hype for that game.

[03:26] We've got Evil Dead from Spooky,

[03:28] and what else we got going on?

[03:29] We've got Princess Bride from P3.

[03:32] People are gonna be playing that,

[03:34] and then we've got these Pulp Fictions,

[03:36] which look, again, I know I'm hard on Pulp Fiction gang.

[03:39] It's cause I'm just tired of the wait.

[03:41] It's almost gonna be two years now

[03:43] since the game was revealed,

[03:45] and still there's no ETA

[03:48] on when people are gonna get their games,

[03:50] and I'm just over it.

[03:51] I'm just over it.

[03:53] I don't think people wanna wait that long.

[03:55] Now, that brings me to the topic of today's show,

[03:59] and that is Dutch Pinball is at a crossroads,

[04:03] and I wanna focus on this right now

[04:05] because it's been a little bit of a whirlwind two weeks

[04:08] for me seeing this game, talking to Melvin,

[04:12] realizing what's going on behind the scenes.

[04:15] People calling me a shill,

[04:16] people saying I'm gonna flip this game for money.

[04:19] Let me just tell you this right now.

[04:21] I am not flipping an Alice in Wonderland spot for a profit.

[04:27] I'll tell you why.

[04:28] There is no profit to be made here.

[04:31] There's no flip here, gang.

[04:32] I'm not stupid.

[04:34] You make money on themes people want.

[04:37] If I had one of 88 back to the future SLEs, yeah.

[04:43] Then I would try to get two and flip one

[04:45] for like a 10G profit, but this is never gonna be a game

[04:50] where you're gonna have this overwhelming demand

[04:53] and you're gonna be able to make money.

[04:55] Also, I don't need the money.

[04:57] Well, maybe I do.

[04:58] For those of you who don't understand my world,

[05:00] let me just break it down real quick.

[05:03] We pay $6,000 a month.

[05:06] A month, not a year, not every six months,

[05:09] $6,000 a month for daycare, all right?

[05:14] So, you know, I don't need to flip Alice's adventures

[05:17] in Wonderland to keep this family going,

[05:20] but just go to bed at night,

[05:22] understanding that this is not Canada's annuity.

[05:26] I'm not surviving in life through this podcast.

[05:28] I'm not surviving because I'm flipping games.

[05:31] I wish I had it as easy as some of these distros,

[05:34] making like $1,500, $2,000 a sale

[05:38] to just drop ship a game.

[05:40] I gotta strap on this damn mic every week

[05:43] and tell you guys something that no one else will tell you.

[05:46] And I'm gonna do a show right now

[05:48] that you're probably not expecting.

[05:50] And it's all about Dutch pinball

[05:51] being at the crossroads.

[05:53] Because now that the game is out,

[05:55] now that the fanfare is over,

[05:57] now that the reveal has happened

[05:59] and we're gonna talk about the stream,

[06:01] we're gonna talk about all this stuff,

[06:03] now that all is said and done,

[06:05] I think now the real work begins.

[06:08] None of that was the real work.

[06:10] The real work now is getting this game made,

[06:13] getting this game to customers,

[06:15] being open and honest about when that's gonna happen,

[06:19] being open and honest about this company's abilities

[06:23] to actually change a line over

[06:25] and get a second game on the line.

[06:28] You have to remember the relationship

[06:30] and the partnership that is happening right now

[06:33] with DPX and Dutch pinball.

[06:36] So Melvin, his goal was to take that J-pop game

[06:41] and make it a working game.

[06:43] He did that, right?

[06:44] Whether you like the artwork or not,

[06:46] whether you love the orbit shots or not,

[06:49] whether you love the upper play field or not,

[06:51] it doesn't matter.

[06:52] He had a goal to do that.

[06:55] He did that.

[06:57] And yes, you can nitpick some of his decisions on it,

[07:00] but in an eight month period of time,

[07:03] this dude made the game work

[07:05] where other pinball manufacturers have failed

[07:08] to get a J-pop game to market.

[07:10] He has almost succeeded.

[07:12] And I use the word almost succeeded

[07:14] because the game is still not available.

[07:18] The game is not on the line.

[07:20] And so yes, all the R&D and the development cost

[07:24] Melvin paid for.

[07:26] He made this happen out of his own pocket, right?

[07:29] He did not take pre-order dollars to do the R&D.

[07:33] That's what Haggis did.

[07:34] That's what J-pop did.

[07:36] That's what Skitbee did.

[07:38] So he upfronted all the money.

[07:40] And so now he's got this game ready to be made.

[07:44] And now the job is berries to make the damn game.

[07:49] Remember, Melvin is not a manufacturing company.

[07:53] It is Dutch pinball that needs to do the manufacturing.

[07:57] And then some weird twisted fate thing happening right now

[08:01] is that Melvin is ostensibly

[08:04] using Dutch pinball as a contract manufacturer

[08:08] to make his Alice.

[08:10] And what irony there is because now Berry

[08:14] is the contract manufacturer.

[08:16] And if you know the story behind the Big Lebowski

[08:19] and all of its problems,

[08:21] it's when Berry needed a contract manufacturer

[08:25] to make his Big Lebowski.

[08:27] And so now Berry has a chance to show everybody

[08:32] that he knows how to get it done.

[08:34] He knows how to make two games and two lines

[08:38] and do the switch over and actually have stuff happen

[08:42] on a timeframe that works for customers.

[08:46] And I wanna really, really reiterate this.

[08:49] I don't think, and I mean this,

[08:51] and even though I talk to these guys

[08:52] and I love what they've been doing,

[08:54] I still need to see stuff from them

[08:57] that make me feel confident they can get it done.

[09:01] The game is not on the line.

[09:04] So that doesn't make me very confident.

[09:06] It's like, why did you reveal the game

[09:09] if the game is not on the line?

[09:11] Remember, Barrels of Fun recently did a similar thing.

[09:15] They self-financed the R&D of their game,

[09:18] but they did not reveal the game

[09:21] until games were in boxes, until the line was going.

[09:25] Now they did a little bait and switch

[09:27] where they had games made, they revealed the game,

[09:30] they took money and then manufacturing hit a snafu.

[09:34] Like there were a lot of delays

[09:35] and everybody knows this about pinball manufacturing.

[09:38] This is always where, always, where everybody falls down.

[09:43] They don't fall down on like the prototyping

[09:46] and getting something to put in front of you at a show.

[09:49] They fall down when it comes to manufacturing

[09:53] because then you gotta order all of those parts.

[09:56] You gotta make sure you have the money

[09:58] to order all those parts.

[10:00] And to get the money to order the parts,

[10:02] you then have to be doing something

[10:04] that gets pretty risky.

[10:06] You have to start cashing all of those pre-order checks.

[10:10] Right now, Melvin has taken none of that money.

[10:13] Anyone who's put some money in on Alice,

[10:16] that money has not been sent to Dutch yet,

[10:19] but it's going to have to go there.

[10:21] And when it goes there, that's gonna be the moment

[10:25] where Barry and team and the manufacturing team

[10:28] over at Dutch, they better get their act together.

[10:33] They better be ready to make this game in January and game.

[10:38] It's like middle October.

[10:41] It's almost November.

[10:42] And we know that it's gonna take like a month or two

[10:47] to get a lot of those specialized parts in-house.

[10:50] You're not gonna get those like toppers overnight.

[10:54] You're not gonna get those plastic ramps immediately.

[10:57] So they better start ordering parts now.

[11:00] And I know what you're thinking.

[11:01] You're like, well, why aren't they ordering parts right now

[11:05] if they took money this week?

[11:07] And you know, because this company, as of now,

[11:10] doesn't have experience doing this.

[11:13] And you can see it, right?

[11:14] It's not just in like the manufacturing

[11:17] from game one to game two.

[11:19] You saw it last night in the stream.

[11:21] You saw it last night in the level of like professionalism

[11:25] in their own ability to show you a product that they make.

[11:30] I thought the first 45 minutes of talking to Melvin

[11:33] and asking all the questions were great, right?

[11:36] That's what I do.

[11:37] Like I put on a mic and I'll interview people

[11:40] and I'll talk to you.

[11:41] This is my realm.

[11:42] And I think I do this show

[11:43] and I think I carry myself as a professional

[11:47] unless I'm drinking and then all bets are off

[11:50] and then I delete everything.

[11:51] But until then, until then,

[11:53] if my job is to help you A,

[11:56] get people excited about your product, I can do that.

[11:59] If my job is to interview you

[12:01] and get as much truth out there

[12:03] so people can make a decision, I'll do that.

[12:05] Now, when it comes to streaming your product

[12:08] and showing people your game, that's on you.

[12:12] Like you gotta make sure, A,

[12:14] you put your game in the best possible lighting.

[12:17] I mean that both literally and metaphorically.

[12:20] And I think on both fronts,

[12:22] Dutch Pinball has a lot of work to do.

[12:25] And after 11 years in Pinball, there's no excuses.

[12:29] Like someone should have a meeting today over there

[12:31] and they should be asking themselves, how is it?

[12:35] After 11 years of us being in this industry,

[12:38] we don't even know how to stream our own product

[12:41] in a way that looks appealing to customers.

[12:44] If we can't do this right,

[12:47] this is gonna start to instill lack of confidence

[12:51] because it shows that we're not taking things seriously

[12:54] and we're not doing things at a professional level.

[12:58] And I'm sorry, but like every part of a brand matters.

[13:02] And you saw it last night, right?

[13:04] It doesn't matter how beautiful your game is

[13:06] and the game is gorgeous.

[13:08] But when the way you're showing it off to everybody

[13:10] is either super dark lighting

[13:13] or crappy cell phone footage moving around the game,

[13:16] that doesn't work.

[13:19] That doesn't make people feel good.

[13:21] That opens up the door for all the skeptics,

[13:25] all the cynics and all the haters to say, look at this,

[13:29] how can you guys take this seriously?

[13:30] How can we go from this avatar video to this

[13:34] and actually not laugh our asses off?

[13:37] And I understand it.

[13:38] Like you're fueling all of that skepticism

[13:42] when you're not doing stuff on a professional level.

[13:45] And so Barry and company over there,

[13:47] they've got a lot of work to do in this department.

[13:50] And the reason why there's no excuses for this

[13:53] is that you don't even have to do the work.

[13:55] There are so many people in the pinball streaming business

[13:59] that will do your stream for you.

[14:01] They simply could have mailed a game

[14:04] to one of these great streamers

[14:06] and have them put together a video.

[14:09] They could have sent a game out there

[14:11] to someone who could have done a better job.

[14:13] And I know why it's all coming across so half-assed

[14:18] because they're rushing to get to expo

[14:20] and they're not a big team

[14:22] and they don't have a lot of resources

[14:24] and it just begs the question,

[14:26] is the rush to get to expo,

[14:29] is that worth it if everything else is gonna fall apart?

[14:34] And my belief is it's not.

[14:37] Like a game like this where you're only selling 500,

[14:41] two collectors, like that's how you're branding this company.

[14:44] If that's your goal,

[14:46] then why do you wanna waste your time

[14:48] and your resources and all that stuff going to expo?

[14:51] And the weird part now too, as they're seeing,

[14:54] is like maybe the game sold out,

[14:56] it's close to selling out.

[14:57] So if you just think about that for a minute,

[14:59] this game almost or did sell out

[15:03] with some of the worst marketing I've ever seen.

[15:06] And if that's the case, if you're them,

[15:09] the key learning is imagine what could have happened

[15:13] if we maybe waited a little bit longer,

[15:16] didn't even bother going to expo

[15:19] and got all of our marketing materials

[15:21] to be much more polished and much more beautiful

[15:25] like the game itself.

[15:27] You know, it's hard.

[15:28] You know, I know it's hard,

[15:29] especially for those guys over there.

[15:31] You know, I feel for Melvin a little bit

[15:32] because the guys spent eight months designing this game,

[15:36] it shouldn't only fall on him to do it all.

[15:40] Like Mark Seiden didn't have to like shoot his own game.

[15:44] He didn't have to do all this marketing

[15:46] to make people excited about Avatar.

[15:48] He had a team of people.

[15:50] He had a production company come in.

[15:52] He had a $100,000 video crafted around his game.

[15:56] If it was just up to Mark Seiden to do it all,

[15:59] yeah, it would probably be just what we got this week

[16:02] with Alice.

[16:03] And look, it's a wake up call for Dutch.

[16:05] They're out of crossroads.

[16:07] But the real important crossroads people

[16:10] is not the marketing.

[16:11] It's not.

[16:12] The real important crossroads for Dutch pinball right now,

[16:16] as this company wants to establish confidence

[16:20] that they're a legit player in this boutique space,

[16:23] you know, they're coming up to the end

[16:25] of the big Lebowski run.

[16:27] They need to end that and start Alice or start two lines,

[16:31] but they need to communicate like what's going on.

[16:34] Like when is this all happening?

[16:36] You know, Melvin's out there saying January.

[16:39] All right, so January, what does that mean?

[16:42] Does that mean you're tooling up in November, December,

[16:45] and we expect to see games going out to customers

[16:49] in January, or does it mean January production begins?

[16:53] And here's the problem, and it's unfortunate for them,

[16:56] but we're living in a post-Haggis world.

[16:59] We're living in a post-Jpop world.

[17:02] We're living in a post-Skit B world,

[17:04] a post-Andrew Highway world.

[17:06] We are living in a world in which words mean nothing.

[17:10] If you say production has begun,

[17:13] like we hear that all the time.

[17:14] We heard that from Damien, like manufacturing has begun,

[17:17] and then nobody gets a game for eight months.

[17:19] You know what I'm saying?

[17:20] Like manufacturing doesn't begin

[17:22] because you finally start to get some parts in.

[17:25] Manufacturing only starts when the line is turned on

[17:30] and a game is done at the end of the day.

[17:33] Until that happens, production has not begun

[17:37] because it only probably takes 24 hours

[17:40] to get that game down the line and in a box.

[17:44] And so if that's gonna happen in January,

[17:47] Dutch pinball needs to step up.

[17:49] They need to step up and show us that they can do this

[17:54] because the real risk right now

[17:56] is if they don't get anything on the line in January.

[18:00] And Melvin's on the record for saying,

[18:03] everybody's gonna get their game in 2025 or your money back.

[18:07] If I just do the real simple math on this,

[18:11] it doesn't work unless they start production in January.

[18:16] They said they can make 10 games a week.

[18:19] And that's on a really good day.

[18:21] So 10 games a week.

[18:23] There are 52 weeks in the year.

[18:25] That means they need to make 10 games a week for 50 weeks

[18:31] or they're not gonna hit their goal.

[18:33] They're gonna have to start giving refunds

[18:35] and they're gonna be off.

[18:36] And so that to me again, makes me nervous

[18:40] because I'm like, why would you say that

[18:43] if you can only make 10 games a week?

[18:46] The numbers don't work out.

[18:48] And then it's the Netherlands.

[18:49] Like this is Europe.

[18:50] Like come on, there's more bank holidays

[18:53] and everybody takes off the entire month of August in Europe.

[18:56] So we know that the Dutch are not working 50 weeks a year,

[19:01] nonstop in manufacturing.

[19:04] And so I'm a little bit nervous

[19:06] that these things haven't been figured out

[19:09] and you're already taking money.

[19:11] You're already making some promises.

[19:14] You're already putting ETAs in people's heads.

[19:17] And look, now they need to do the work.

[19:20] Now Barry and team, you need to do the work

[19:24] to prove to everybody that you can get this done

[19:27] because if you can't get this done,

[19:30] there is gonna be zero confidence

[19:32] that you can even come within a country mile

[19:35] of doing what you need to do

[19:38] to get back to the future into the world

[19:40] because it's all connected, right?

[19:43] All of this is connected.

[19:44] And I feel like Melvin served up Barry,

[19:48] the perfect game to just learn the transition

[19:52] from one line to the other, right?

[19:55] Cause imagine if it was back to the future

[19:57] as the next game and they got a transition over

[20:00] and they don't really know, they haven't done it before,

[20:03] they don't have that institutional knowledge.

[20:05] What better game to learn it on

[20:07] than a game where you only gotta build 500?

[20:10] The fan base that's buying this is probably the most patient.

[20:13] Like these collectors are very patient.

[20:16] They know what they want.

[20:17] And when they want it, they're willing to wait for the next

[20:19] because anyone who's buying an Alice, probably as money,

[20:24] probably as a collector, is gonna buy four to five

[20:28] other pinball machines before they even unbox their Alice.

[20:31] They're willing to wait.

[20:33] But what they're not willing to do

[20:36] is they're not willing to be misled.

[20:39] And they're not gonna have that kind of patience.

[20:42] It's gonna get to a point with Dutch Now

[20:44] where January is gonna be everything.

[20:47] And I mean that, like if January comes

[20:50] and there are not games on the line

[20:52] making their way to customers,

[20:54] you are gonna start to see the confidence unravel

[20:57] like never before.

[20:59] You're gonna see people wanting refunds.

[21:01] You're gonna see people starting to see the writing

[21:03] on the wall that this could be forever

[21:05] and a day before I get my game.

[21:07] And I gave my money because I saw the Bowskis going out.

[21:11] I had confidence in them.

[21:13] They were saying stuff on record

[21:15] that it was gonna be January.

[21:17] And so now we're at the crossroads.

[21:19] Dutch Pinball, this is your moment.

[21:22] Barry and team, this is your moment.

[21:24] It doesn't matter if it's two o'clock in the morning.

[21:28] You can't stream a game like that.

[21:30] I heard they were nervous.

[21:31] Why are you nervous?

[21:32] Why would you be nervous to play pinball

[21:35] when you're a pinball company?

[21:37] No, there's no room for that.

[21:39] There's no room for that.

[21:40] I think the funniest part last night

[21:41] is when Kerry muted himself for like 20 minutes.

[21:44] But it was fun doing it.

[21:46] But now the fun's over, gentlemen.

[21:48] It is, I mean that.

[21:49] The fun is over.

[21:49] Like all of it is over.

[21:51] You haven't done enough yet.

[21:53] You've only gotten 30% of the way there.

[21:55] I mean that.

[21:56] The 70% is the manufacturing.

[21:59] And there's no excuses for like bad lighting.

[22:02] There's no excuses for the hour of the day.

[22:04] If you didn't wanna do it at two o'clock,

[22:06] you easily could have made a gameplay video on your own time.

[22:11] And when Kerry and me were doing our thing,

[22:13] Kerry could have rolled it.

[22:14] He could have just gone to the tape, right?

[22:16] He easily could have pulled up a pre-shot video

[22:20] that shows the game in the best light.

[22:22] I know we wanted to do it live.

[22:24] I know in real time.

[22:25] But ultimately here we are.

[22:27] And I still don't think people know how the game plays.

[22:31] And that's not good.

[22:32] Like I'm on pin side and Wrench is saying like,

[22:35] it plays really smooth.

[22:36] It's really, I don't believe you.

[22:38] I don't believe anybody.

[22:40] What I believe in is what I can see and hear

[22:43] and feel with my own eyes.

[22:45] And if people are watching these streams

[22:48] and they don't see any of that,

[22:49] like you can't just say the game has flow

[22:51] and shoot smooth and all this.

[22:53] And then people are watching a stream

[22:55] and it's bricking, bricking, bricking.

[22:56] It's not going up the ramp.

[22:58] So what are you gonna come away believing?

[23:00] What you're seeing with your own eyes

[23:02] or what they're writing on pin side

[23:04] and the excuses on how this and that,

[23:06] come on, what at two in the morning?

[23:07] All of a sudden the ball can't get up the ramp.

[23:10] It doesn't work like that.

[23:11] Throw a few whiskies in Canada

[23:13] and I'll show you how awesome Guns N' Roses

[23:15] is at three in the morning.

[23:16] It's just the way it is.

[23:17] And I mean this, it's your company.

[23:19] A lot is riding on this

[23:21] and Barry and everybody over there.

[23:23] It's time.

[23:24] It's time to be the company you wanna be.

[23:26] All those black shirts, beautiful factory.

[23:29] You gotta now deliver with actions.

[23:32] And I wanna make this crystal clear.

[23:34] I think what Melvin did is nothing short of a miracle.

[23:37] Making this game in eight months.

[23:38] I think Dutch Pinball can put out a phenomenal product.

[23:41] I think they're very creative.

[23:43] I think they have all the faculties in the world

[23:45] to create amazing pinball machines.

[23:47] I do, but it's not 11 years ago.

[23:50] It's now and the industry has evolved

[23:53] and streaming has evolved

[23:54] and the level of professionalism has evolved

[23:57] and we've had failures and we've had successes.

[24:00] And I think this company is still at the crossroads.

[24:02] I am not gonna consider one game made

[24:05] over 11 years as a success.

[24:07] It is not.

[24:08] It is not a success.

[24:09] Spooky Pinball has made like how many games?

[24:12] 11?

[24:13] Jersey Jack 10 games, right?

[24:15] Stern Pinball like 50 games in that time period.

[24:18] Heck, even Jerry's made like six or seven games

[24:20] in that time period.

[24:21] Jerry, I'm not gonna count all your little midi games.

[24:23] You know, every time you do this with Jerry,

[24:24] he's like, well, I have 17 games, Chris.

[24:25] What are you talking about?

[24:26] I'm not counting Ken and Lagoon, Jerry.

[24:28] I'm not doing it.

[24:29] But my point is all these other companies

[24:31] have shown they can do it.

[24:33] You have only made one game.

[24:35] And so yeah, I hope they play this

[24:37] over the loudspeakers at Dutch.

[24:40] Now is your time.

[24:41] You need to prove to everybody you have what it takes.

[24:45] And this is a great example of a moment for you to prove it.

[24:50] Because if you can't do this,

[24:51] you're not gonna be able to do back to the future.

[24:54] It's not even funny.

[24:55] You might as well sell the company tomorrow

[24:57] and let someone else figure it out.

[24:59] You know what I'm saying, everybody?

[25:00] And I'm always gonna be in Canada.

[25:01] I know this.

[25:02] I hear all the insults.

[25:03] I hear everybody saying this stuff.

[25:05] I'm not gonna be a shill.

[25:06] You think I'm gonna do this for 10 years

[25:08] and I'm gonna die on a hill

[25:10] of a boutique pinball manufacturing company?

[25:12] And I'm not gonna burn them.

[25:13] I help them.

[25:14] I help them, Kerry help them.

[25:16] We help them get some excitement around their game.

[25:18] And Melvin told us from day one,

[25:20] I want you guys to be you, tell it like it is,

[25:23] and this is how I see it.

[25:24] And gang, they're gonna hear this

[25:26] and nothing I'm saying is wrong.

[25:28] I am simply saying to them, balls in your court, Barry,

[25:31] it's time.

[25:33] It's time to show us you can get it done.

[25:35] And we haven't seen it before, right?

[25:37] This is no longer a joke.

[25:38] People are spending a lot of money.

[25:40] You've got millions of dollars at stake.

[25:42] Are you good enough of a company to take that money?

[25:45] Are you professional enough to get it done?

[25:48] Forget all these amateur videos and streams.

[25:51] Yeah, they're garbage, but forget it.

[25:53] That all means nothing

[25:55] if you can get the manufacturing together.

[25:57] I would rather have a company do no marketing

[26:00] and have the manufacturing down.

[26:02] Pretty much like what Stern does,

[26:03] pretty much what CGC does.

[26:05] Bukie Pimbal doesn't use tons of marketing.

[26:07] I mean, they did the smart thing.

[26:08] They had Zach Mani come in and film a featurette

[26:11] for their next game, Evil Dead.

[26:13] That's super smart.

[26:15] So on the day that Evil Dead gets announced,

[26:18] Zach and Co are gonna have this 20 minute video

[26:22] that's gonna make everybody want one.

[26:24] Cause he knows how to do it.

[26:25] He's a good marketer.

[26:27] Cause this is his livelihood.

[26:28] He works in Pimbal and is trying to sell you something.

[26:31] And he knows how to do it.

[26:32] This is your livelihood, Barry.

[26:34] It's time.

[26:34] Let me know what your thoughts are.

[26:36] I'm gonna follow this company in an objective way.

[26:39] I mean, do not make a mistake.

[26:41] I am not gonna sacrifice 11 years of my audience.

[26:45] And the reason why you listen to me

[26:47] to just like blindly shell a product.

[26:49] It's not who I am.

[26:50] You know it's not who I am.

[26:52] What I will do is I will create moments of hype and FOMO

[26:56] because it's fun.

[26:57] It's a lot of fun.

[26:58] And this fun will continue for Melvin and Barry

[27:02] if they can get it done.

[27:04] If they don't get it done,

[27:05] it's gonna be a nightmare for both of them.

[27:08] It's not gonna be a nightmare for me.

[27:09] I'm still gonna just put on my microphone

[27:12] and record my show.

[27:13] And they have the ability, and I mean this,

[27:15] those two men have the ability to decide

[27:18] what they want their 2025 to be.

[27:21] And I've told this to Melvin,

[27:22] the real measure of success in life.

[27:25] It's not how much money you make.

[27:27] It's not how much Gucci you have

[27:29] or super limited edition pinball machines

[27:32] or how big your house is,

[27:34] even though you don't use most of the rooms

[27:36] or your car collection.

[27:37] The real measure of success in everybody's life

[27:41] is how many days do you wake up in a good mood?

[27:45] Damian Hardin robbed everybody, right?

[27:49] He's not gonna have to pay a dime.

[27:51] Now for those of you who think

[27:52] that he's gonna get away with it,

[27:54] yes, he's gonna get away with it on that level.

[27:58] But Damian Hardin and Marty Robbins are never,

[28:02] and I mean this, they're never gonna wake up

[28:04] in a really good mood for the rest of their lives.

[28:08] They will have destroyed their relationship

[28:11] with the hobby they love,

[28:13] and they will wake up every day knowing

[28:15] that they ripped people off and they lied to people,

[28:18] and there's no way they could ever erase that, no way.

[28:22] And so for Melvin and Barry, they need to ask themselves,

[28:26] what kind of mood do we wanna wake up in every day?

[28:30] If they get the games on the line,

[28:32] if they burn the midnight oil to make it happen,

[28:35] if they get these games in boxes in January,

[28:38] they will wake up every day in a good mood.

[28:41] They'll be tired, they'll be stressed out,

[28:44] but they'll still be in a good mood for the most part.

[28:47] But if they don't, if they don't,

[28:49] and it's delay after delay, and angry customers,

[28:53] and they're gonna be miserable,

[28:55] and then they're not gonna wanna be in it,

[28:57] and I don't want them to be miserable,

[28:59] and I don't want them to get out of it.

[29:02] So that's Kanata saying to them,

[29:03] guys, shut it all down, after expo,

[29:07] stop with all of it, just get the games made.

[29:10] You don't need to do anything else,

[29:12] get the games made, all right everybody?

[29:14] Kanata Pinball Podcast, coming at you,

[29:16] the only way I know how.

[29:18] This is how I do my show.

[29:20] I wanna talk from the heart, I wanna talk from the soul,

[29:23] and I'm glad each and every one of you are club members,

[29:26] and you know what's going on.

[29:27] So the problem is now is,

[29:29] only my paid subscribers hear this show.

[29:32] So on pin side, I'm still just gonna be that public shill

[29:35] for Dutch Pinball, and no one's gonna ever hear

[29:38] this side of it.

[29:39] But that's why you understand that I am not ever gonna be,

[29:44] just like some blind shill for anything.

[29:46] I'm always gonna talk about these things from both sides,

[29:49] and that's the most important way to approach life

[29:52] and analyze everything.
