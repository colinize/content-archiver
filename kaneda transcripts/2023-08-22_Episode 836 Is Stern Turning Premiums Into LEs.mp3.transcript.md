[00:21] Aw, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast. It's Monday. It's episode 800 and something. Everybody, what's happening in Pinball right now?

[00:29] Here's what I want to talk about on this episode. Has Stern really just turned premiums into LEDs?

[00:35] I'm hearing people say this, like now, more than ever. I want to deconstruct on this episode why I think people are feeling this more than ever.

[00:41] And I think they're really feeling it on Jurassic Park and why. It just feels like if Stern was making these premiums and now all of a sudden they're already on the line with 500 new LEDs that are basically costing us 4 or $5,000 more than Jurassic Park premium used to cost.

[00:59] I think people are starting to see through it more and more. We're going to talk about that. There's a few quality issues with the Godfather CEs that are making their way to customers.

[01:08] We'll talk about that. We'll talk a little bit about Bobby Mueller, Mr. Robert Mueller. Let's start there real quickly.

[01:14] So the court documents around Deeproot Pinball and Robert Mueller. You know the man who took $61 million from people who did not know they were investing in a Pinball venture and now we know where he spent the money.

[01:28] You know, he basically took money from these investors. They did not know, by the way, that they were investing in a Pinball venture.

[01:35] They thought they were investing in his life insurance scam thing he was going to do.

[01:39] Now look, he took the money and he bought engagement rings for his wife. He paid for cruises for his family.

[01:46] He also sent his daughter to private school using money taken from Deeproot funds.

[01:53] On every question, he pleads the fifth to not self incriminate himself.

[01:57] And they're like, hey, did you buy this engagement ring for this person? And he's like, I don't know.

[02:02] It happened around my engagement, but I don't know. And it goes on and on like that for like all of these pages.

[02:09] And it's really funny. Jump into the pin side thread and see those court documents.

[02:13] Our very own blueberry Johnson has been after this guy for like years and he's been like the investigative reporter covering all things Deeproot.

[02:21] But what's crazy about all of it, like all of the money, all the millions wasted.

[02:25] And we really thought this guy was going to be able to deliver a working Raza pinball machine.

[02:31] When he did that Deeproot tour, which is still the biggest joke in the history of pinball marketing.

[02:37] When he walked those poor pinball media through Deeproot, everybody knew that nothing was ever going to get made.

[02:45] Except for the pinball personalities who worked at Deeproot that convinced us all things were going to happen.

[02:51] Anyway, so check that out. All right, what else is happening in the world to pinball?

[02:55] Let's talk about this whole has Stern just turned premiums into L.E.s.

[02:59] I see more and more people saying this. It's a little bit confusing because premiums and L.E.s.

[03:05] Have always been the same exact game where it counts.

[03:09] Like there's never been a real difference in the software.

[03:12] There's never been any real difference in the artwork on the play field or the gameplay itself.

[03:17] It has always been a cosmetic difference.

[03:20] But here's where I think people are really starting to push back.

[03:23] I think they're pushing back against a game like Jurassic Park Limited Edition, you know, the 30th anniversary edition.

[03:29] Because as of today, this game is not sold out.

[03:33] Distributors have it. You can go get it easily and they're making them right.

[03:37] They're going to make all 500 of these machines and they're $13,000.

[03:42] Here's the issue. Years ago, if you went to buy this Jurassic Park when Jurassic Park first came out,

[03:47] I think the L.E. was around $9,000 and the premium was like $79.99 or $7,500.

[03:55] Okay, same exact game. Same code. Same everything. It doesn't come with a topper.

[04:00] So here we are just like four years later.

[04:03] And now that game that was once $8,000 or $9,000 is $13,000.

[04:08] But here's the part that I think everybody is starting to see through.

[04:12] Stern was making Jurassic Park premiums, right? They were cranking them out.

[04:16] Now imagine you're at the Stern factory and Jurassic Park premiums are rolling down the line.

[04:22] The only thing you have to do to charge $3,000 more or $4,000 if you go off of the old price, $3,000.

[04:30] The only thing they're changing on that assembly line are the side decals,

[04:35] which are just big stickers that they stick on the game.

[04:38] And then they put different armor on the game, a different translate and a different apron into the game.

[04:44] But remember that translate doesn't cost Stern more money than the premium translate.

[04:50] The art decals don't cost them more. These aren't special like 3D embossed decals.

[04:55] The armor doesn't even cost that much more. And I think that's what people are pushing back against.

[05:01] They're seeing and realizing now that Stern is basically making $3,000 more.

[05:07] And all they're doing at most is maybe adding a couple hundred bucks in changes to the game.

[05:15] And I think everyone is starting to say, nope, we're not running at this stuff anymore.

[05:21] But this is not new. Stern has always done this.

[05:25] They've always made the best margins on the LEDs because the LEDs really don't have that much different in them.

[05:32] It's not new, but the difference now is at these prices, everyone is just feeling exhausted by it all.

[05:39] I can feel it. You can see it in the secondhand market.

[05:42] You can see it in people's hesitations to run at this game.

[05:46] Stern has definitely hit a price ceiling with pinball.

[05:50] They have. The ceiling has been hit. Now a game that comes out that's $13,000, you're not going to sell it out instantly.

[05:59] You might never sell it at that price.

[06:02] And what's going to have to happen next is they're going to have to get more flexible with these dealers and these distros.

[06:09] So when they have a game, they can actually sell it for less than MSRP.

[06:14] You know, look, the fact that they've gone up on the price, they're going to have to lower what the map pricing is so that a dealer can give you a deal.

[06:21] I mean, they are called dealers for a reason. Why do you think they're called a pinball dealer?

[06:27] We call them distributors, but they are dealers.

[06:30] And I think everybody is going to look for a deal now.

[06:34] And if you just wait and see, as I've been saying, more and more of you are coming up to me and saying, hey, Chris, I've taken your advice.

[06:41] And look, it's panning out.

[06:43] If I just waited and think about Jurassic Park 30th, you're going to be able to get one of these for less than $13,000 if you just wait.

[06:52] Do you need to own it today? Do you have to have it now?

[06:55] I'm just not seeing anything go up in price. Nothing.

[06:58] I'm not seeing anything.

[06:59] Foo Fighters has not gone up in price.

[07:01] James Bond, 60th.

[07:03] And this is not normal.

[07:05] I think everybody remembers when Stern only made 500 LEs, right?

[07:09] When they were really limited and the LEs were like 7,500 or 8,500, every single game, almost every single game went up in price.

[07:20] You felt like you bought something that was rare.

[07:23] You thought you bought something that was special.

[07:26] And now they've doubled the volume.

[07:28] They've increased the price by 40%.

[07:30] And here's where we are.

[07:32] So for everyone saying, is Stern just turning premiums into LEs?

[07:36] The answer is yes, they are.

[07:38] But they've always been doing that.

[07:40] What's changed now is everything is so much more expensive.

[07:44] And that's why we're seeing a tremendous slowdown on running at these games.

[07:49] Like years ago, think about it.

[07:51] If they released another edition of Jurassic Park at the height of Jurassic Park,

[07:55] when everyone was loving the game and it was $9,000 and we're going to make 500 more, they would have sold out instantly.

[08:03] But now this LE is $4,000 more than the old Jurassic Park LE.

[08:10] $4,000!

[08:12] You just can't justify it.

[08:14] There is no way Stern's cost of manufacturing has gone up that much.

[08:19] That is almost a 50% increase in price.

[08:23] You know, and I'm glad to see so many of you wising up and taking my advice.

[08:28] Alright, so speaking of price, I want to talk about Venom for a minute.

[08:32] And I want to ask a simple question.

[08:34] Is Venom done already?

[08:35] Like, are Venom sales just flatlined and there's nothing they can do to get Venom sales back?

[08:41] And this game came out.

[08:43] It didn't really land with much impact.

[08:45] And now we got a video today.

[08:47] I love these videos.

[08:48] It's Dwight with the glass off, pointing his fingers all over the play field.

[08:53] And he's explaining the code.

[08:55] And I'm just going to be honest.

[08:56] 30 seconds in to Dwight explaining a pinball rule set just makes me fall asleep.

[09:02] I don't think Stern should ever let him explain the rule set of a game.

[09:06] And especially once that man has the glass off, all bets are off on how long you can stay awake to pay attention to it.

[09:13] It's just not the way you do it.

[09:14] I get that he's the coder, but sometimes you got to leave the coding and the engineer guys away from the marketing materials.

[09:21] It's just the way it goes.

[09:22] He is not a good hype man for pinball.

[09:25] That four minute video is not going to attract new buyers.

[09:29] Now look, without even knowing the Venom code, if they ask Canadian to make a four minute hype video selling people on the rule sets of Venom,

[09:37] I could make up stuff that would be more entertaining than the stuff in that video.

[09:41] Oh man, you know, I mean, that'd be great.

[09:43] That'd be great.

[09:44] Just give me a call, Stern.

[09:45] I'm happy to do your marketing for you.

[09:47] Stern marketing these days is like them giving away free water bottles on Facebook.

[09:51] Seriously, they're like charging us so much money for pinball and they're giving us away like beer cozies.

[09:56] All right, so that is out there, but Venom, let's talk about it.

[09:59] Is it done?

[10:00] Like is this game going to be a bargain basement game going into the fall and winter of 2023?

[10:07] I think the answer is it is.

[10:08] I don't think this game is ever going to have a second life.

[10:11] I don't think once people jump on it, there's going to be this word of mouth that sends this game through the stratosphere.

[10:17] I don't think it's going to have like a stranger things moment because remember, stranger things is still stranger things.

[10:22] It is one of the most popular TV shows of all time.

[10:25] And for all of us out there, it reconnected us to growing up in the 80s.

[10:29] There's nothing about Venom that really screams like this is a game we ever really wanted.

[10:36] And I think that's the biggest issue with Venom is no matter what they do,

[10:41] they're never going to be able to get grown men to get into this symbiotes Venom narrative and then shell out like 13,000 for an LE or 10,000 for a premium and 7,000 for a pro.

[10:55] I think Venom is staring at each and every one of us like, hey, if you just wait, I will be a cheaper alternative to the prices right now.

[11:04] And you're going to be able to get Venom LE's new inbox.

[11:07] I'm going to make a prediction.

[11:08] I guarantee you you're going to be able to write a book.

[11:10] You're going to be able to rock up with like 11,5 on the table and walk away with a Venom LE.

[11:16] I think distributors make $2,000 for every LE maybe a little bit more.

[11:21] They'll take whatever they can get over what they paid just to move the game on because when you give them that 11,5 or $11,000, now they have 11 grand back to buy a game they'll be able to sell more easily like a Keith Elwyn machine.

[11:36] So Venom arrives. It's dead on arrival. And this is new territory, everybody.

[11:40] It's exciting to watch. I keep saying this.

[11:42] It's exciting to watch this stuff because the more these companies come out with these games and they don't take off, then they have to do something different.

[11:51] They're going to have to pivot and they're going to have to make some adjustments.

[11:55] And you best believe Stern is probably looking at this right now and saying this isn't really good.

[12:01] We can't only rely on Keith Elwyn games to justify these prices.

[12:06] And if we have like two misses in a row, what does that mean?

[12:10] Because two misses in a row will absolutely destroy Stern's distributor base.

[12:15] They're not going to be able to absorb two misses in a row.

[12:19] Like one great game will not make up for two misses in a row.

[12:23] And this is uncharted territory people because I've been covering this hobby for like eight years.

[12:28] Like this never really happened. Like every once in a while Stern would have a dud, but it would still sell out and it would still sell pretty quickly.

[12:35] But I haven't really seen the amount of people pulling back.

[12:38] Now look, it's hard to tell, right? Because I go to Pinside, I go to Facebook, but there is a large number,

[12:44] a large number of the pinball buying community who buys these games that don't go on Pinside, don't have podcasts, don't join Canada's Facebook lives.

[12:54] There are thousands and thousands and thousands of people out there who are grown adults who don't overthink this stuff.

[13:01] They don't care. They just see a game on Facebook or they get an advertisement for a game and they buy it and they don't tell anybody they bought it.

[13:08] They don't complain about the lockdown action, but in being crooked, I'm going to talk about that.

[13:13] They don't waste their free time engaging with other pinheads, right?

[13:16] And that is the majority of people who buy pinball machines.

[13:19] You go on Pinside, it's like the same 200 dudes all day long.

[13:23] And look, it's a fun community at times, but it's the same people.

[13:27] So clearly there's a much broader pinball buying demographic and that's who Stern needs to make sure they don't lose.

[13:35] I don't think we have a great line of sight into who those people are, but we do have certain ways we can measure whether or not a game launch has been successful.

[13:43] We have seen games sell out in a matter of seconds, in a matter of hours.

[13:47] We have seen games sell out in a week.

[13:49] We have seen games never sell out.

[13:51] Like Spooky Pinball didn't sell all of those TNAs that they re-ran.

[13:55] I don't think they're going to make all of the Scooby-Doo's.

[13:57] I don't know if they have 1969 orders.

[14:00] I doubt it.

[14:01] They didn't sell all of those when they launched the game.

[14:03] It's interesting that Spooky hasn't shown us yet what the standard edition of that game is.

[14:09] Right? The Mystery Machine cabinet.

[14:11] We still have not seen what the basic version of the game is.

[14:14] And the reason I think they're stalling on that, I think they pushed everybody to buy the more expensive version of the game.

[14:20] And I think when you see the Mystery Machine edition, it's actually going to end up being the more limited and the more rare version of Scooby-Doo.

[14:29] So really weird they're doing it the way they do it, but I would just like to see it.

[14:33] I think the game is not supposed to have as many sculpts.

[14:36] I think the artwork is going to be unique and different, but they haven't shown it.

[14:40] So I mean, I guess they're making those at the end of the run.

[14:43] I don't think there's any way with where prices of Scooby-Doo have gone that they're going to make 1969.

[14:50] Alright, so Venom dead on arrival.

[14:52] Galactic Tank Force kind of dead on arrival.

[14:54] What are the games where dead on arrival?

[14:56] Godfather, Ellie's are dead on arrival.

[14:58] You know what the ultimate telltale sign about Venom being dead on arrival?

[15:01] Then I'll move on to Godfather.

[15:03] Is if you go into the club thread on Pinside, it's only two pages long.

[15:08] Two pages like nobody cares.

[15:10] Nobody's having a conversation and saying, hey, I ordered this game.

[15:15] I think this is going to be one of Stern's worst selling games of all time.

[15:19] I think Venom is going to sell like Black Knight did.

[15:22] I don't think they're going to sell as many as Led Zeppelin.

[15:25] It's going to be a real miss.

[15:27] They probably don't care because they know they've got something big with Joe Kamnikau,

[15:32] something big with Keith Elwin coming.

[15:35] And so I think Venom is just going to be a blip.

[15:37] Maybe later on down the road because not many people have a Venom.

[15:41] Is it going to become a unique experience?

[15:43] I just don't see that happening.

[15:45] All right, so Godfather.

[15:46] So people are unboxing this game and they're having issues.

[15:49] Now look, it's pinball.

[15:51] Every pinball machine has issues.

[15:53] But if you're waiting on your Godfather collector's edition and you go into the owner's thread,

[15:58] what you do not want to see is a bunch of stuff where owners are having issues

[16:04] because it gets you nervous that you are going to get a game that also has issues.

[16:09] Now look, some of the issues are inexcusable.

[16:12] Like if you're putting on a lockdown bar action ornament on that lockdown bar,

[16:17] you know, there's that ornate gold thing around the action button

[16:21] and someone showed a picture about how theirs was put on crooked.

[16:24] Little thing.

[16:25] I don't know if that's easy to change or not, but it speaks to a larger issue.

[16:30] These are $15,000 items and details matter.

[16:35] Someone who spends this much money on a product like this is going to go over it with a white glove.

[16:42] And the reason why an action ornament thing, action button ornament being crooked is really annoying

[16:49] is it's right in your line of sight.

[16:52] It's kind of equivalent to hedge multi-baw.

[16:55] You're always going to be staring at it and it's going to bug you.

[16:59] And that is not something you want.

[17:01] And we know that collectors, they don't even play their games.

[17:04] They're just OCD about them and having a crooked action bar ornament is going to drive people nuts.

[17:11] But that's not the bigger issue with this game.

[17:14] There are people having more serious issues with optos and the game crashing.

[17:19] And again, it's pinball.

[17:20] Obviously not everyone's game is having these issues, but not many of these games have shipped yet.

[17:26] And if some of the early people getting the game are having issues,

[17:30] you could see how that could start to create a little bit of anxiety for people who are waiting for their games.

[17:37] And it obviously doesn't help them, Eddie, that there are pinball podcasters like Canada and sites like Pinside

[17:44] so that when an issue happens, it's our job to blow it out of proportion and let everybody know that their game is going to have issues.

[17:51] I don't think that's the case, but overall Jersey Jack quality has been spotty.

[17:56] You don't really get the quality you want for the price you're paying.

[18:00] And this is someone who owns the Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition where I know the play field is going to fall apart.

[18:06] Now they seemingly have the play field issue worked out.

[18:09] So will Godfathers have more issues?

[18:12] It's too early to tell.

[18:13] We need to see more CEs unboxed, but that is just something to look out for.

[18:18] All pinball machines have issues.

[18:21] All pinball machines need to be dialed in a little bit.

[18:24] Stearns are still the most reliable.

[18:26] They really are.

[18:27] The reason why Stearns are so reliable are you sitting down is because there's not much in it.

[18:31] There's really not much to go wrong with the Stearn machine.

[18:35] And I think Jersey Jack machines are much more complex.

[18:38] They're much more intricate.

[18:39] And I think there's a lot more issues with Jersey Jack machines because of that.

[18:43] I think Stearn made a smart decision for them, not for us, but for them.

[18:47] And they realized if we just do enough, we don't have to go overboard.

[18:52] We don't have to really raise the bomb.

[18:55] If we just make the games look great, if we just put great stuff on the LCD screen and we get the theme right,

[19:02] we don't have to make really complex mechanical things anymore.

[19:06] These people will buy it anyway.

[19:08] And look, that got them to this point, but I don't think it's going to last much longer.

[19:13] I think for this much money, we are going to want to see more complex stuff.

[19:17] We are going to want to see more magic.

[19:19] We're going to want to see stuff that wows us.

[19:21] And when doppelganger swings out and there's three USB sticks swinging out with a damn circuit board visible,

[19:27] like that's not going to cut it, right?

[19:29] I think when you look at that in Venom, it's just indicative.

[19:32] They are approving stuff that looks cheap.

[19:34] It looks like they're cutting corners.

[19:36] And again, we would live with this stuff when games were like $6,500,

[19:40] but you're not going to live with that for $13,000.

[19:43] You're not going to live with that for $10,000.

[19:45] And you're not going to want that in a $7,000 pro.

[19:48] As we get into the fall, it's going to be interesting because now the next like six months,

[19:53] I think the conversation is going to start to revolve around Expo.

[19:57] Is anything going to happen at Pinball Expo?

[19:59] That's going to surprise us.

[20:01] I hope so because I was looking at the itinerary for Expo and there's not a lot.

[20:05] Like there's not a lot of reasons to go.

[20:07] The only real reason to go is to hang out with everybody.

[20:09] I'm still on the fence whether or not I will be going.

[20:12] If I do go, I'm really going to have a good time this year.

[20:15] They banned me from the show last year.

[20:17] So hopefully nothing happens between now and then.

[20:20] I'm also going to start doing another interesting thing.

[20:23] So what I want to start doing, I haven't even asked John about this,

[20:26] but I think like once a month or so, I'm going to let everybody know a day and a time

[20:32] that I'm going to go to Jack Barr to hang out.

[20:34] So we could just hang out together.

[20:36] So if you're in the Northeast region and you want to hang out with Canada at Jack Barr,

[20:41] I will let people know in advance like what days I'll be there.

[20:44] So John, get ready.

[20:45] We're going to get the Canadian Army who's local to come by, play some pinball.

[20:49] And now that we know going to Sunshine is pointless, it's really Jack Barr or nothing.

[20:55] And I want to end this show by thanking Mr. Kim Mitchell for his very generous donation to the show.

[21:01] Kim Mitchell gave me a rumor that did not pan out to be accurate.

[21:06] And so he felt a little bit bad.

[21:08] He made a contribution to the show.

[21:11] I told Kim this on my Kim, I hope you're wrong all of the time because I would love to get these Kim Mitchell donations.

[21:18] Kim, I love you, brother.

[21:19] You're a great fan of the show.

[21:20] We've had so many good conversations behind the scenes and I really do value your friendship and your advice over the years in this hobby.

[21:27] And of course, all donations are accepted at Canadians Pinball Podcast.

[21:30] So if you want to give any ancillary donations to the show, just PayPal at canadapinball.com.

[21:37] But as I always say, like you showing up here and being a member of the Canada Club is what means the world to me.

[21:43] Thank you so much for your continued support.

[21:45] We'll be back this week with more shows.

[21:47] Something's going to happen.

[21:48] Something always happens in the week of pinball.

[21:50] And you know, I'll be here to give you a very entertaining take on what's happening in this hobby.

[21:55] But I want to hear from you in the comments.

[21:56] What do you think?

[21:57] Is Stern really turning premiums into Ellie now in a way they can't hide?

[22:02] Or has this always been the case?

[22:04] Everybody, let me know your thoughts.

[22:06] We'll talk soon, later.

[22:07] A new song from Guns N' Roses 2 perhaps.

[22:10] You know, they recorded this song in 2001.

[22:13] So these vocals by Axel are almost 22 years old.

[22:17] But whatever, I kind of like the tune.

[22:19] I'm kind of digging it.

[22:20] But I wish the members would actually make new music.

[22:23] They've been back together for seven years and they haven't recorded a single song together.

[22:29] What a band, everybody. What a band.

[22:31] Later, let's let Axel take us out.

[22:53] Thank you.
