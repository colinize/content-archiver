[00:00] Uh, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:21] Happy Friday everybody!

[00:23] I don't know about you, but I'm just like exhausted lately.

[00:27] I've been working a lot.

[00:28] The weather is changing.

[00:31] There's a lot mixing in the pinball world.

[00:34] We're all waiting to see these big titles, Harry Potter, King Kong, Predator, the new

[00:40] game from Barrels of Fun, Is It Dune, Is It Goonies.

[00:45] We're waiting to see what happens.

[00:47] These periods are sort of nice, right?

[00:49] You sort of give your wallet a little bit of a break and you just sort of hang out with

[00:53] each other.

[00:54] That's what I love about this hobby is in these times between releases, it's fun to

[00:59] get together and speculate and dream what is around the corner.

[01:04] Uh, I know a lot of us.

[01:06] If we think about all the titles, the two major things are going to be Harry Potter and Spike

[01:11] 3 King Kong.

[01:13] Seeing what happens in both of those games is going to get really interesting.

[01:17] We once again got confirmation from, I believe it was George Gomez, the screen is going to

[01:21] be a little bit bigger on the Spike 3 system.

[01:25] They're not going to change the size of the translate.

[01:28] They're simply going to make the screen a little bit bigger on that area.

[01:33] You know what I think Stern is going to do and they're going to make a lot of money.

[01:36] I think they're going to offer that as something that is backwards compatible with a Spike

[01:41] 2.

[01:42] You're going to be able to upgrade the monitor.

[01:44] I don't think everything else will be backwards compatible, but Stern might try to get all

[01:50] of us.

[01:51] Not all of us because I don't have a Stern Spike 2 machine, but they're going to try

[01:54] to get everybody who's on Spike 2 and maybe even Spike 1 to upgrade.

[01:59] Maybe it's Spike 2 is LCD.

[02:01] They're going to want you to upgrade for the new monitor and they're going to sell it to

[02:04] you and knowing Stern, they will probably charge a thousand dollars for a new monitor

[02:10] and new speakers for your game.

[02:13] We shall see.

[02:14] It's looking right now as we look at April is next week.

[02:19] Looking like the next game out might be Predator because if you look at the barrels of fun

[02:25] countdown and they're doing this raffle to register your labyrinth game for a chance to

[02:30] win the next game, they're going to announce the winner of that raffle on May 1st.

[02:37] I would assume that's going to happen right around the reveal of the next game.

[02:42] I also did hear yesterday because I've been poking them and sometimes I poke just to get

[02:47] a response.

[02:48] I did hear from David Vaness that they are still planning to have me there to see the

[02:54] new game and to make content to release for all of you to coincide with the launch of

[03:01] the game.

[03:02] Now we know that David's going to want to give people at least two weeks notice to get

[03:07] this date on the calendar.

[03:09] Now we know it's not going to happen in the first two weeks of April.

[03:13] I think it's going to be end of April.

[03:15] I think May 1st is looking like the date they are going to reveal the game to the world.

[03:21] What do I think of this raffle?

[03:23] This whole marketing thing to register your labyrinth for a chance to win a new game.

[03:31] The newest game from them.

[03:32] First and foremost, if you own a labyrinth, no brainer.

[03:36] Absolutely register your game.

[03:38] Why wouldn't you?

[03:39] The odds of winning, I don't know.

[03:41] They've made around a thousand labyrinth machines.

[03:43] I guess it is one in a thousand.

[03:45] The odds don't seem that great, but at least it's a nice gesture.

[03:48] It's a nice thing to do for people who have supported your company.

[03:52] There is also, I believe, a $10 donation to Project Pimball.

[03:56] This whole thing is happening through the Project Pimball charity and they're using

[04:00] the same terms and conditions and the same company to do this giveaway or sweepstakes

[04:06] if you will because you have to regulate it.

[04:09] I'm not going to open up that can of worms about where all the money goes sometimes for

[04:12] some of these charities, but still, might as well register your game.

[04:16] They also are letting everybody know that there's still 113 labyrinth games still available

[04:23] through distributors.

[04:24] I think that means there are 113 games that will have been built that distributors have

[04:31] ordered that there are no homes for.

[04:34] I don't even think they're making all 1100.

[04:36] I think that's part of the 1007 games they're going to build because they order parts in

[04:43] batches.

[04:44] So what does that mean?

[04:45] It does mean.

[04:46] And I know I said on my Facebook page, I did take it down.

[04:49] I don't know if this game's been a hit and some people argued with me about that.

[04:54] They said, Canada, this is a brand new company.

[04:57] They made 1000 games and shipped them to customers in a year.

[05:01] So on that level, absolutely, this company has hit it out of the park.

[05:05] How many inaugural pinball companies have achieved what Barrels of Fun has done in its

[05:11] first game in its first year?

[05:14] And on that level, it's absolutely a success.

[05:17] Is the title a hit?

[05:20] It is kind of.

[05:21] If they announced that they were only making 800, then it would have sold out and we would

[05:26] have been saying home run, right?

[05:28] But because they said they were going to make 1100 and they came in under that, there is

[05:33] a little bit of like you didn't reach your goal.

[05:36] And when you don't reach your goal, it's hard to say it was a smashing success.

[05:41] I think they were a little bit overly ambitious.

[05:44] I think they overestimated how many people wanted this theme.

[05:48] And I know we are all together locked in arms that we want them to release a game in which

[05:55] they will have no problem getting 1100 orders.

[05:59] And we know that that is not Dune.

[06:03] It is Goonies or it is something else.

[06:06] And I think that's the state of affairs with this company.

[06:10] I do now think it's going to be Dune and I still hope it's Goonies.

[06:15] I think we're all in the same boat.

[06:18] We've heard from Brian Savage, who's the co-founder of this company.

[06:21] He's on the Patreon chat.

[06:22] Brian, thank you for being a member of Canada's Pinball podcast.

[06:25] Brian, we look forward to seeing what you got.

[06:27] And it sounds like the team is really excited about the next game.

[06:31] I look forward to seeing it.

[06:32] I've been giving a lot of opinions and I've seen nothing.

[06:35] We have to give this company credit, the level of secrecy that this company has is incredible.

[06:42] We're all going to know what the Steve Ritchie game is a year before it comes out.

[06:47] We knew about Harry Potter a year before it came out.

[06:51] We've known about King Kong forever.

[06:53] We knew about James Bond forever.

[06:55] We've known about Dungeons & Dragons.

[06:57] I think the game that nobody saw coming was John Wick.

[07:01] We all knew Venom was coming.

[07:03] And so it's nice.

[07:04] It is nice to still have some secrets in the pinball world.

[07:07] Now I still do think that knowing that Harry Potter is coming, I do think these guys need

[07:13] to get in front of it.

[07:14] I do because why would you want to wait?

[07:17] Right now there are zero dollars going towards Harry Potter.

[07:22] We can't order it.

[07:24] Nobody will take your money.

[07:26] Nobody will take your deposit.

[07:28] And Barrels of Fun won't take your money right now even though they have a game right around

[07:32] the corner.

[07:33] And the game is far enough along to show everybody.

[07:36] So that's going to be interesting.

[07:38] If you drop Predator on top of Harry Potter, on top of Barrels of Fun's game, on top of

[07:44] King Kong, it's going to get so hilarious.

[07:48] There's just not going to be enough money or room to go around to all of these companies.

[07:53] You know, I keep thinking too, it's like Stern knows they need a hit.

[07:58] And I wish, I'm just going to say this, I wish Stern made a move that was the other

[08:02] way.

[08:03] I think if Stern really wanted to just clobber and reestablish themselves, I would drop the

[08:09] price on King Kong a little bit.

[08:12] I would turn King Kong into a 12-5 game, not a 13-6 game.

[08:18] And the reason I would do that is I think Stern Pinball needs to win back a lot of people

[08:23] that just don't want to buy New and Box anymore because they feel like they've been overcharged.

[08:30] And one Keith Elwin game that's worth it every year is not going to make up for the amount

[08:36] of games that people have lost money on.

[08:39] And I also just think that there should be only 500 LEs and they should be 12-5 and that's

[08:47] it.

[08:48] Let the second-hand market maintain its value.

[08:52] On the hot games, they'll go up in value and you should be okay with that.

[08:57] There's something about just because we can do it doesn't mean we should.

[09:02] I had an interesting conversation with a gentleman on my Patreon chat.

[09:07] I believe his name was Chris and he's over in the UK.

[09:10] And he's been on a list for Harry Potter forever, like a year and a half, two years, right?

[09:15] He's been on the list.

[09:16] They're not going to get as many games as America and he's all excited to get his CE.

[09:22] Now the news has broken that they might make unlimited CEs during a window of time.

[09:28] I don't mean like unlimited they're going to make.

[09:30] I mean they'll take unlimited orders within a timeframe.

[09:35] Now Chris is all bummed out about that and people are like, what are you mad about?

[09:38] Like they're going to make as many as people want.

[09:40] Why would you be upset?

[09:41] And I understand if you're somebody who's been waiting online forever.

[09:46] Imagine if you've been waiting online for two years to get something and there's better

[09:51] seats in the house.

[09:52] And that's why you got online early and you want to get the better seats.

[09:57] And then all of a sudden they let everybody in at once and there's only one row of seats

[10:01] and everyone's got the same seat.

[10:04] And I know why Chris was upset.

[10:05] It's because he did.

[10:06] He's a collector.

[10:07] He wanted to get his hands on one and have one of only a thousand and he wanted to feel

[10:13] good that having that one because he's been online for a year and a half, having that

[10:18] one game will hold its value in case he ever wants to get rid of it.

[10:24] Now like everybody else, he's wondering, do I even order this game on that window?

[10:29] Knowing they're going to make so many.

[10:31] Knowing dealers and distros are going to put in big orders.

[10:33] Imagine if you're a UK dealer and in the past your allocation was small.

[10:39] Well now they can just order as many as they want and JJP will take those deposits even

[10:45] if it means they won't fulfill those orders for a few years.

[10:50] I mean that people like they're going to be making Harry Potter for years the same way

[10:55] they made guns and roses for years.

[10:57] And instead of over making GNRLEs, I think what's going to happen is it's going to be

[11:02] the CE model that they end up making thousands of.

[11:06] And if I had to take a guess, if they do this unlimited window to order, I think they're

[11:12] going to get around 5,000 orders for a CE.

[11:18] Hardly anybody's going to want the LE.

[11:20] I think they know that.

[11:22] I think they're okay with that.

[11:24] And then I think they're going to have their $10,000 version of the game that is going

[11:28] to have all the mechs in it.

[11:29] That's what I'm hearing again.

[11:30] It doesn't have anything taken out.

[11:32] The only thing taken out are the aesthetic things.

[11:35] They want to sell those to operators.

[11:37] And what I heard they're going to do is there's going to be a global launch of this game.

[11:42] What that means is Jersey Jack is going to make collectors editions first.

[11:48] They're going to make, I don't know, a hundred of them.

[11:50] They're going to mail them all over the world.

[11:52] Wherever pinballs are sold, they will get the game all at the same time and then they

[11:58] will reveal the game and do a global reveal launch and ship of the product on one day.

[12:06] That is what the plan is.

[12:07] And after they make, I think, a hundred CEs, then they're going to make some standard edition

[12:12] games for operators.

[12:14] Now, I think what Jersey Jack needs to do, they need to have two lines.

[12:18] You can't turn it on and off like this.

[12:20] You should never stop making CEs.

[12:23] Just keep them going out the door and make the second line the standard edition for operators

[12:28] I don't think Jersey Jack has two lines anymore.

[12:32] I don't think they've had two lines for years.

[12:34] They had a small second line years ago.

[12:37] I don't even think they're doing that.

[12:39] You know, they used to do small batch runs of games like Hobbit and Dialed in stuff like

[12:44] Wonka, but they haven't done that in a while.

[12:47] This is going to be their biggest title ever.

[12:49] This is going to be their best selling game ever.

[12:52] I think it's going to be great.

[12:54] I think it's going to be magical.

[12:55] I really do.

[12:56] I think Jersey Jack is going to hit a home run on this game.

[12:59] I think people that have been rooting against this company are going to change their mind

[13:04] on this game.

[13:05] I think everybody should always go into every new game with an open mind.

[13:10] Of course, we have prejudice.

[13:12] Of course, we sort of want to judge a company by its last offering.

[13:16] Take a company like Pinball Brothers.

[13:18] People are basically saying Predators going to be terrible because Queen and ABBA were

[13:24] lackluster.

[13:25] And they haven't changed anyone on the team.

[13:28] So if you were to ask me, that's a game where I think if you are saying it's going

[13:33] to be bad, you're most likely going to be right.

[13:36] We all hope we're wrong, but Pinball Brothers hasn't really put it together ever,

[13:42] especially on their own.

[13:43] Remember, like Alien was designed and developed by Andrew Highway like 12,

[13:49] 13 years ago.

[13:51] And so these guys under their own accord haven't designed a great game ever.

[13:56] And now they're making a new game, which is a theme people really love.

[14:00] And hopefully it has Arnold in it, but they haven't shown us that they know how

[14:04] to make a great pinball machine.

[14:06] Spooky pinball, they keep getting better.

[14:08] Every game is better than the last evil dead is their best game to date.

[14:13] Multimorphic, same thing.

[14:14] Their games keep getting better.

[14:16] Portal is the best multi-morphic game to date.

[14:19] Whether or not people are going to go in on that platform, the market will decide.

[14:23] You know how I feel.

[14:24] I just think it's tough now.

[14:25] It's really tough.

[14:26] I think Jerry needs to sell the platform with a great game like Portal for a

[14:31] little bit of a loss leader position.

[14:34] I think he needs to sell this thing for 10,000 or less.

[14:38] Once you go over that 10,000 threshold now, it is a red flag.

[14:43] It makes people cautious.

[14:44] They hesitate.

[14:45] The reason they hesitate is almost every single game.

[14:48] Like 90% of games that have come out in the last four years that have been over

[14:54] $10,000, 90% of them have slid down and lost value where you can now go get them

[15:01] today for 10,000 or less.

[15:04] So you've lost $5,000 on Jersey Jack CEs.

[15:08] You've lost $3,000 to $5,000 on Stern LEs.

[15:11] I'm looking at all these Venom LEs.

[15:13] You can't even sell one at eight.

[15:15] Right?

[15:16] You can't sell a Venom LE for $8,000.

[15:18] That's a $5,000 loss.

[15:20] It's still there.

[15:21] Like it's just something psychological about spending more than $10,000 on a

[15:25] pinball machine that isn't really limited, that isn't a dream theme.

[15:30] And I think that's the reality of the market now.

[15:33] And look, I think we all agree.

[15:34] I heard Zach Manny said this.

[15:35] I agree.

[15:36] Like 2025 is going to have better themes than 2024.

[15:40] 2024 was a really low bar though.

[15:43] And so we're definitely going to get better themes.

[15:45] I mean, Harry Potter is going to be the second biggest theme in the history of

[15:48] pinball.

[15:49] Star Wars is number one.

[15:51] And then we're going to get Harry Potter.

[15:53] I think Star Wars, in terms of most popular IPs in the world, I think Star

[15:57] Wars is like number five and Harry Potter is number seven, but they're

[16:01] juggernauts, they're absolute juggernauts.

[16:03] And I think that game is going to sell on FEMA loan.

[16:06] But I also think Eric Minier is going to make a packed, really fun game.

[16:10] And I hope the clips are not muted.

[16:13] And we're going to see within a month.

[16:14] And it's going to get exciting.

[16:16] You know, I want to end this podcast real quick, everybody, you know,

[16:18] because we're all in this sort of like waiting to see what happens next.

[16:21] I want to just explain in a couple of minutes why I do this show and why I

[16:25] get so much excitement out of this show.

[16:27] And it simply is because this is the only thing in my life where I truly have

[16:33] creative freedom.

[16:34] I don't have to put up with any politics or bureaucracy.

[16:38] I don't have to have a committee of people working with me.

[16:41] I don't have to listen to what a strategist says the idea should be.

[16:45] I don't have to have account people telling me no, I don't have to have

[16:48] media relations people telling me this idea is not going to work.

[16:51] Every day I go into work and I deal with a lot of people and we are working

[16:56] on major brands and we're trying to come up with creative ideas.

[16:59] And when you have a lot of people working on it, the more people you put

[17:03] on the assignment, the more difficult it becomes to land on a very simple,

[17:09] fun, creative idea that's going to work.

[17:12] And Canadian Spinball podcast to me is a very fun, simple, creative idea

[17:16] that has worked all of these years to look at this hobby and not be in the

[17:22] back pocket of the manufacturer to give opinions and they are opinions

[17:27] and they are subjective.

[17:28] My opinion isn't worth any more than anyone else's.

[17:32] It just makes more money than some other opinions because people find it entertaining.

[17:37] And I love doing it.

[17:38] And if I didn't have this outlet, I would feel much more of an empty human.

[17:44] I would because I think we all need a creative outlet or we need to connect

[17:49] into a community that creates content and conversation that makes you feel

[17:56] a part of something.

[17:57] And I think that's what most of you get from pinball.

[18:00] It's not the machines that are making you feel great.

[18:04] It's the relationships with the people that love talking about and playing

[18:09] these machines that make you feel great, make you feel satisfied.

[18:13] And I mean this.

[18:15] If I were to lose this and all of you in this community, I would lose some

[18:20] of my best friends.

[18:22] I would lose the conversations I want to be having.

[18:24] And I would feel a lot lonelier in my existence on this planet.

[18:29] Of course, I love my wife, friend is amazing.

[18:31] My family is amazing.

[18:33] But I realize this as we get older and a lot of us are children of the 80s

[18:38] and the 90s.

[18:39] I was born in 76 as we get older.

[18:43] And if you work with people of all different generations, I've noticed this.

[18:47] You start to feel like things are moving on past you.

[18:51] Like new things are developing that you just don't care about.

[18:54] For example, like they might come to me and say, Hey, did you see this on

[18:57] TikTok?

[18:58] And I'm like, I don't want to spend any time on TikTok.

[19:01] I think that kind of content is terrible.

[19:04] But that's where billions of people are going.

[19:07] It's not like I want to shut TikTok down.

[19:09] I can't geek out over that stuff.

[19:12] The way I can geek out over 80s movies, over video games we grew up with,

[19:16] over pinball machines on a forum.

[19:19] I find TikTok to be what's horrible in society today.

[19:22] I think that stuff does make people lonely.

[19:25] It is isolating.

[19:27] It's not bringing people together.

[19:29] And what these people are absorbing is nonstop things that make them feel

[19:35] inadequate, make them feel broke, make them feel insecure.

[19:39] When we were kids, think about what we absorbed.

[19:42] We wanted to be Luke Skywalker.

[19:45] We wanted to be Maverick.

[19:46] We wanted to be the karate kid.

[19:48] The things we like plugged into took us on an adventure, right?

[19:53] Nowadays, they don't even watch movies.

[19:55] Like the kids can't even pay attention for a movie.

[19:58] They're watching a movie for the first time and they've got a phone open.

[20:01] They've got a laptop open.

[20:02] And that's why I love the fact that mostly all of us, we grew up before

[20:09] there was any of this nonsense and we engaged and we plugged in.

[20:13] It's also why I think pinball is not going to stick around for that much longer.

[20:19] We're all going to get old and there's not going to be a next generation of kids

[20:24] that will pick up and buy these games.

[20:26] I do think the boutiques will always survive because face it until a lot of us

[20:31] are dead, like we'll be buying pins into our 80s.

[20:35] I mean it in 80 year old man who's got money and doesn't want any of the new

[20:40] flash bang crap will still buy a pinball machine.

[20:44] When Gen X becomes the new boomers in the world,

[20:47] we're going to have the most disposable income.

[20:49] Hopefully we've all taken care of ourselves physically and we're still going to buy games.

[20:54] I just don't think like the big dogs will survive.

[20:57] I think the boutiques are the future because again, you're always going to be

[21:02] able to find a thousand customers over the next 10, 20 years in pinball.

[21:06] What you're not going to be able to find consistently if you want to make three

[21:10] to four games a year are 5,000 buyers per title.

[21:14] You're not going to be able to sell like 30, 40,000 pins a year every year for the

[21:20] next 10 to 20 years.

[21:21] It's just not going to happen.

[21:22] I just want to thank you.

[21:23] And the reason I'm saying this is I think lately at work,

[21:26] I feel like I've been working really hard.

[21:27] I've been working around the clock.

[21:29] I've been working late nights, you know, and it's just tiring sometimes to feel

[21:33] like you're working your ass off and not everybody's in it with you.

[21:37] And you wake up and, you know, some of the younger talent

[21:40] haven't developed any ideas and you've been working all night and everybody sort

[21:44] of gets by now.

[21:45] You got to create.

[21:46] You got to keep creating.

[21:47] And that's why I love this show and I love my promise to you every week.

[21:51] You're at least going to get two shows a week and you're hopefully going to get

[21:55] the Saturday morning spectacular.

[21:56] The creation never stops.

[21:58] And this is what keeps me going.

[22:00] It's what keeps me excited.

[22:02] And it's the same kind of energy I want with people I work with.

[22:05] It's the same kind of energy I see in the other pinball content creators that are

[22:08] crushing it, you know who they are.

[22:10] And it's the same reason why every month you stick around.

[22:13] You stick around because I hopefully you're having fun and I can't wait for these

[22:16] new games to come out.

[22:17] We're going to have a great time giving our opinions about them.

[22:21] Everybody have an amazing Friday.

[22:23] Be happy to be here.

[22:25] Life is really short.

[22:26] It really is.

[22:27] We never should get too upset about pinball or each other.

[22:31] It's all going to end.

[22:32] But while we're here, let's stay positive and be optimistic that Jersey Jack is going

[22:37] to crush Harry Potter in a good way.

[22:40] Canada out.

[22:51] Yeah.

[23:06] Who's that?

[23:08] Nobody.

[23:09] I said, who's that?

[23:11] I said, nobody.
