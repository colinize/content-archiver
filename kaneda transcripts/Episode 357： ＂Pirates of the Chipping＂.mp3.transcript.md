[00:00] I know the last thing you pinheads wanna hear is that it actually was really exciting

[00:26] exciting to see 80,000 screaming fans get down to the Spice Girls in Dublin, Ireland.

[00:32] That's where I was.

[00:33] I took Brenda there to see them Friday night.

[00:38] They're a comeback tour.

[00:39] But you don't want to hear about the Spice Girls.

[00:40] You want to hear about pinball.

[00:42] So we're back in the saddle and look, there's not a ton of stuff going on in the pinball

[00:46] world.

[00:47] But we're going to cover what's going on in the pinball news spectrum today on this episode.

[00:51] I think it's 357 of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[00:55] I do have an interview I'm going to air this week with Neil over at pin quests.

[00:59] So don't don't worry, Neil, it's going to go up this week.

[01:03] So what's going on?

[01:04] What's popping in the pinball world?

[01:05] So the first topic I want to talk about is Jersey Jack pinball.

[01:10] And it's not what you think.

[01:11] I'm not going to go off on on Willy Wonka code or anything like that.

[01:15] This issue keeps creeping up.

[01:16] And I've been following this thread because it just keeps rising to the top every day on

[01:21] pinside.

[01:22] And that is the play field quality on pirates of the Caribbean and play fields cracking

[01:29] and play fields dimpling.

[01:31] And this sort of topic won't go away.

[01:34] And I think the reason why is people are starting to realize that there might have been

[01:39] some bad play field clear coding going on that is affecting pretty much every single

[01:45] version of pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:47] Now, when you think about pinball and quality.

[01:51] When we talk a lot about that on this show is are we getting what we pay for?

[01:56] And I think if you look at the collector base and the home buyer, it's pretty clear what

[02:00] we all want.

[02:01] We want to buy a game that will hold up to the to the countless number of times we're going

[02:07] to play the machine.

[02:08] And when you have a game in your home, we especially want those games to remain as close

[02:13] to perfect as we possibly can.

[02:15] Now, we all know that it's a little bit of a futile battle to keep a pinball machine

[02:20] completely mint, right?

[02:22] Because you got a steel ball rolling around hitting stuff, right?

[02:26] And hitting not just the play field, but the targets and the different mechanisms.

[02:30] And there's so much stuff that can happen when you have a violent toy like a pinball machine.

[02:36] But I don't think it's unfair to say that people who pay this kind of money for these

[02:43] toys expect their play fields to hold up at least for the first year to chipping,

[02:50] to cracking, to sort of ghosted inserts.

[02:53] And so, you know, we saw what happened with Ghostbusters with that boondoggle, ended up

[02:58] with Stern having to send people fully populated play fields.

[03:02] What a nightmare that was for Stern.

[03:04] I think people don't realize how close that came to sending Stern into financial hot water

[03:11] and ruin almost.

[03:12] I heard it was really, really bad when they were going through that period.

[03:16] So Jersey Jack and Pirates of the Caribbean.

[03:19] Now, what do we know about the issue here?

[03:21] Well, it seems that the clear code that is being used on Pirates of the Caribbean is not

[03:27] hard enough to withstand some of the posts that are being screwed into the game.

[03:34] It's also not hard enough to withstand cracking where the different holes are in the game

[03:40] or the different scoops.

[03:41] So how does this happen?

[03:43] I guess that's the question I just have is how do we keep ending up here?

[03:47] It seems like every time in pinball,

[03:49] we get one step forward.

[03:51] We get a game that's got a lot of features in it like Pirates of the Caribbean and, you

[03:54] know, Eric engineered all this stuff to go into the game.

[03:58] And yet, now we have clear code issues on a Jersey Jack game.

[04:03] And I don't remember these clear code issues plaguing really the habit.

[04:08] I don't remember it plaguing Wizard of Oz that poorly.

[04:12] I mean, I guess Waz had some issues at the very, very beginning.

[04:15] I remember they had some, the clear was wearing through and Jack was sending out

[04:19] stickers to cover it.

[04:20] But here we are in 2019.

[04:23] And here we are.

[04:25] And they know exactly what the home buyer wants and expects.

[04:29] And how can we still have such a problem with getting the clear code right on the game?

[04:35] And you know, I don't know what you do now.

[04:38] So I've been reading the thread and some people are saying, well, Jersey Jack is going

[04:41] to have to address this issue.

[04:43] And Jersey Jack is going to have to send out to people who are having chipping and cracking

[04:48] on their games.

[04:49] Here's the, here's the best part.

[04:50] They think that Jersey Jack is going to send people fully populated play fields as they

[04:56] solve.

[04:57] That is never going to happen.

[04:58] And here's why that's just never going to happen.

[05:01] They didn't order any more parts for pirates of the Caribbean.

[05:05] So it's, it's Jack is just making 1000 games and then they are done with this title for

[05:12] the near future, maybe for the long term, maybe forever.

[05:15] But there is no way that they can financially afford to order all of these pirates parts

[05:22] to then send people out who are having problems fully populated play field.

[05:26] So I just think you need to take that solution off the table.

[05:30] Now we see people in the thread are coming up with other solves, whether it's wider,

[05:35] starposts and washers and different things to go over the areas that are really wearing

[05:39] quickly, mainly under the sling shots of the game.

[05:43] But as someone said it, if the clear coat mix in this game is not good, it doesn't matter

[05:50] where you go in the game that those issues are going to pop up in other areas as well.

[05:57] So is this game a ticking time bomb from a play field clear coat perspective?

[06:04] We're already starting to see people look at the, you know, where the ball falls off,

[06:08] the rocking upper play field chip, adding extra mile are there.

[06:12] This whole notion of like, let's just lay down all this mylar and put all these washers

[06:17] and put all these cliffies into the game.

[06:20] Again, I still think for the amount of money people are spending, I still can't believe

[06:24] that home buyers in 2019 have to do this level of protection when the manufacturers all

[06:33] know all too well.

[06:35] That these are the areas that are going to wear in a game and isn't this why they had

[06:40] an extra year to test this game out and make sure they figured out where the areas of

[06:45] where would occur and subsequently put into the game the cliffies where they need to be.

[06:53] And I still don't understand.

[06:54] I don't understand why no major manufacturer has purchased cliffie, the company from cliffie

[07:00] from cliff himself and made them an official partner with the manufacturer.

[07:05] I just think it makes total sense.

[07:06] He makes the best products.

[07:08] It also begs the question of are play field protectors just the way to go again?

[07:13] Remember, Jersey Jack used to offer play field protectors on Wizard of Oz and on the

[07:18] Hobbit.

[07:19] I also believe they offered a play field protector on dialed in.

[07:24] So from the factory, Jack would install it before you had to take the whole game apart

[07:30] to put the play field protector on putting a play field protector on pirates of the Caribbean.

[07:35] Because it would be a nightmare to do to remove everything from that play field and put

[07:39] it back together again to make sure everything works.

[07:43] So where are we now?

[07:45] What does that mean?

[07:46] What does that mean for pirates of the Caribbean owners?

[07:49] What does that mean for Willy Wonka clear code?

[07:52] What does it mean for Jersey Jack quality perceptions?

[07:55] Now, here is what I think is going to happen.

[07:57] I think hardly anything will happen.

[08:00] I think if anything happens, Jack will offer people a chance to buy an unpopulated play

[08:05] field for probably around like 500 bucks.

[08:09] But does does that mean that those unpopulated play fields are clear code it better or they

[08:15] just old stock that they have on hand?

[08:18] I would probably would think there'd be old stock they're giving you.

[08:23] What does that mean for the collectors edition guys who have 200 play fields out there that

[08:27] are different artwork?

[08:29] Are they going to have old stock of those available?

[08:32] And even if you bought some of those, I see some of the people who love the game are

[08:35] stocking up on an extra play field.

[08:38] Does it really matter or are you just getting another of the bad batch of games?

[08:43] So I think what's going to happen is this.

[08:46] I think Jersey Jack is just going to cut their losses on pirates of the Caribbean and move

[08:50] on.

[08:51] And I don't think you're going to see much of a solve.

[08:53] I don't think you're going to see them invest any more money in a game that they have sold

[08:57] out of.

[08:59] So there's no, you know, the only thing they're going to have to deal with is complaints

[09:04] from existing customers because we know that Jersey Jack has a loyal following.

[09:10] And if they don't take care of people with these issues, will that result in those people

[09:15] no longer going in on future Jersey Jack games?

[09:17] And I think that leads to my overall point about pinball quality.

[09:22] And we talk a lot about that on this show is that you will lose customers.

[09:28] If you have consistent quality control issues with your games and people will lose faith

[09:35] and they won't be as excited to go in again on another game if they're feeling like there's

[09:40] a major quality issue.

[09:42] And we all know this play fields, chipping play fields warping play fields, losing the

[09:49] clear code and pulling up the artwork.

[09:52] That is probably one of the biggest headaches and frustrating things for any home buyer.

[09:58] Because the last thing you want to do and I know you guys are like me, you're a little

[10:02] bit OCD when you try to keep your games pristine.

[10:06] The last thing you want to do is look down at your game and see artwork missing because

[10:12] there's a chip in the play field and you don't want to see that damage.

[10:16] And for many of you out there who are OCD about keeping your games in great shape, you won't

[10:21] be able to stare at that without feeling frustrated and you'll end up probably wanting

[10:26] to get rid of the game.

[10:28] And it sucks but it's just the way it is.

[10:29] Those guys out there, they can't stand if there's like a dent in their car or a scratch

[10:34] on their car or their car has been repainted and it doesn't match correctly.

[10:38] They lose their minds and have to get rid of it.

[10:41] It's just the nature of being OCD.

[10:43] So I think Jersey Jack is just going to wait until like the one year warranty period is

[10:47] up.

[10:48] I think whatever they do send out to people will be simple things like a washer here or

[10:52] there or maybe another metal protector for the scoops and stuff like that.

[10:57] You are not going to see them invest anymore in this.

[11:01] And so is Willy Wonka quality going to be better?

[11:03] Now here's the other part and I have to say I have to give credit where credit is due.

[11:07] I mean Stern Pimball for all of the arrows they take about making cheaper games and this

[11:14] or that.

[11:15] I'm not hearing any real quality issues at all with the recent Stern releases.

[11:21] I'm not hearing about chip to play fields.

[11:24] There's still always going to be the dimpling on the Stern clear coat but dimpling is one

[11:28] thing but chipping a play field is another with monsters with beetles with Deadpool.

[11:36] I think Stern is really rounded a corner in terms of quality control.

[11:41] And I just say that because when I read all the threads I just don't see people complaining

[11:47] about a major issue with a new and box Stern game anymore.

[11:51] Now I'm even seeing now two Stern listens.

[11:54] I mean Batman's that are shipping right now.

[11:56] They also have an additional metal bracket protector not just where the legs go into the

[12:00] cabinet but also at the top of the cabinet as well.

[12:04] So they're reinforcing their cabinets.

[12:06] The biggest problem Stern was having was the splitting of their cabinets and they've addressed

[12:10] that.

[12:11] So it leads us to just wonder quality control on a premium pinball machine.

[12:17] It has to be you have to nail it.

[12:20] You can't ship people games and have clear coat on the play field cracking.

[12:26] Okay.

[12:27] And I see the problem is with this hobby.

[12:30] It's just so expensive to solve that.

[12:33] You almost can't make that mistake.

[12:34] Now I want to read what someone wrote into me because I think it sort of takes a look

[12:40] at this issue in an interesting way.

[12:42] Let me pull that up now.

[12:44] And this comes from Mike Peterson.

[12:45] He said, I have a few feelings on the quality issue in case you feel weird about phone calls.

[12:53] First, the clear on new machines is not that good.

[12:57] In some cases like Pirates of the Caribbean, the clear is just wrong.

[13:02] Clear should be hard enough to not produce ripples but not so hard as to become brittle

[13:08] and chip.

[13:09] Just look at people talk about cruise men play fields or cruzmen.

[13:13] I think it's cruise men.

[13:15] It's a beautiful and durable and the people at Pinside think it's some kind of magic.

[13:20] Nope.

[13:21] Ron has just worked at improving his materials and process over time to get the desired

[13:27] results.

[13:28] Proof.

[13:29] That sub part clear on play field is not what we have to settle for.

[13:34] I mean, people send cruise men brand new play fields to redo.

[13:37] That speaks volumes.

[13:39] Only issue is the time it might take to get desired results on durable play field.

[13:45] Might not be feasible from a business model point of view.

[13:49] Trying to as fair as I can to manufacture on this but I want a good play field.

[13:54] I don't even know if that's a recent to see people.

[13:56] I read people's emails and I don't even know.

[13:58] I'm going to read this word for it.

[13:59] Did I mess this up?

[14:01] Trying to as fair as I can to manufacture on this.

[14:05] I don't okay.

[14:06] Super important to me.

[14:07] Okay.

[14:08] So then he says as far as materials like going from steel to soft tin thinner, cheaper

[14:12] plastics, etc.

[14:13] We are talking about a metal ball crashing into things.

[14:17] Even with the robust materials of old, there was damage.

[14:20] But in most cases, that took some time.

[14:23] Now with lesser materials, things get trashed early and often.

[14:27] Not to mention the spike boards which save Stern a ton of dough.

[14:32] On Pinside someone said he took his wife to a Pins show.

[14:36] She played some machines and after playing a Stern, she turned to her husband and said

[14:40] the cabinet feels like it was made by IKEA.

[14:44] Speaks volumes as she had little experience with Pins.

[14:47] Lastly, not sure if exposing these companies on quality and giving examples might make

[14:52] them shut you off.

[14:54] If you have any relationships with them, just something to think about.

[14:57] Mike.

[14:58] So here's the thing, Mike.

[14:59] I just talked a lot about this, but here's the thing.

[15:02] I don't think that if you knock a game around that just how heavy it is equals the fact

[15:09] that it's quality or not.

[15:11] So if a woman goes up to Pimball Machines at a show and she plays Jersey Jack games, of

[15:15] course, they are going to feel a bit more solid, a bit heavier and just more, you know, it's

[15:21] kind of like the way a Mercedes door thunks close versus the way a Honda door is like thinner

[15:27] and feels lighter, right?

[15:29] But what's most important is just is the game working or not?

[15:34] Is the game going to stand up to multiple plays?

[15:37] Is the game functioning the way it was?

[15:39] It's designed to function.

[15:40] I've said it before.

[15:41] I've had one issue with one node board on Batman 66 in two years of ownership and that's

[15:48] that.

[15:49] I haven't had a change anything.

[15:50] So I do think that for me, quality is how reliable it is.

[15:57] I don't care if something's got quality parts but breaks down all the time.

[16:00] I think that's a bigger headache, okay?

[16:03] And I'm not seeing Stern playfields chipping and cracking right now.

[16:06] I'm seeing that from Jersey Jack, which is the more premium brand and that is just unacceptable

[16:11] to people.

[16:12] All right.

[16:13] All right.

[16:14] Speaking of manufacturers, let's talk a little bit about Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[16:19] I'm not going to go too in depth on this because somebody or some people who are friends

[16:24] of the show, Greg and Zach did a great review of Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[16:29] It's on straight down the middle.

[16:30] They just put it up.

[16:31] I highly recommend you check it out.

[16:34] If you check it out, you're going to be asking yourself if Zach needs to be checked out

[16:39] by a doctor because the man is now saying that the layout in this game is as good and

[16:46] the design of the game is as good as the premium designers in Pimbal.

[16:50] Yes, he is saying Charlie Emory is now up there in the class of people like John Borg and

[16:57] Joe Balser and everyone else who's like the A-list designers and I don't know.

[17:02] I don't know if I agree with that.

[17:04] I think the shots are very tight.

[17:06] I think part of designing a Pimbal layout, here's my thing.

[17:10] When you design a Pimbal layout, and Eric said this about Pirates of the Caribbean, I don't

[17:13] think there's anything rewarding about missing a shot and just dinking off a post.

[17:20] If you look at Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, my whole issue with the layout is just that

[17:26] it becomes a brick fest because you're a little bit off and boing, you're off a post,

[17:30] and there's nothing satisfying about hitting that post.

[17:33] Now Greg was much more realistic on his assessment of the layout and said, you know, the shots

[17:39] are tight, but even when you hit them, they're not as rewarding as hitting the tight shots

[17:44] in Houdini.

[17:45] Now, I haven't played a final Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, but I did play it at

[17:49] T-P-F when it was unveiled there.

[17:52] Game is coming along nicely.

[17:53] I think they both gave it a B-plus.

[17:56] They went over everything in the game, so I'm not going to steal their thunder.

[17:59] Go check it out.

[18:00] I think it's a great review of the game.

[18:02] Admittedly, I think people who are getting Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle are really

[18:05] enjoying them, and I think Spooky's going to get those games into everybody's homes by

[18:09] the end of the year.

[18:11] Alright, Cosmic Carnival, what do you think about this game?

[18:15] Are we now excited because the ramps have been changed a little bit, and the dirty,

[18:19] donny artwork is phenomenal.

[18:21] Game looks great.

[18:22] What is the Suncoast Pimball Cosmic Carnival?

[18:26] My whole question with this game is just very simply, is just why.

[18:31] Why do we need another Pimball game out there?

[18:37] Not just another Pimball game.

[18:38] This is another Pimball manufacturer, and there's money going into this.

[18:42] There's talented people working on this, but when I look down at the machine, I see a

[18:49] very basic game, and I don't know if I'm missing something.

[18:52] I think there's a lot of incredible artwork on the game, but again, I'm just looking

[18:58] at this stuff of what do we need in Pimball?

[19:02] I say this a lot.

[19:03] If I were to go in and make a game, I think you'd have to look at the marketplace and say,

[19:06] well, what is missing from the Pimball marketplace that we can deliver?

[19:12] What is our new take on Pimball going to be?

[19:14] What innovation or what kind of thing are we going to give people that will create buyers?

[19:19] When I look down over at Cosmic Carnival, I have a hard time understanding who the target

[19:26] for this game is.

[19:27] The mechanisms in it are very rudimentary.

[19:31] They're more simple.

[19:32] It's got less in it than a Stern Pro.

[19:36] They're working with an artist that has made Stern games before and has made beautiful

[19:40] Stern games before Metallica, Aerosmith.

[19:43] Donnie's work is tremendous.

[19:45] On this game, it might be his best art package to date.

[19:48] It's got interesting sculpts on it.

[19:51] But for the most part, I just don't see anything happening in this game.

[19:55] It's like it's taking my money now.

[19:59] That's my point.

[20:00] It's not to discourage what they're doing.

[20:02] I think that in 2019, with the amount of people making Pimball machines, though, if you're

[20:08] not raising the bar in some area and you're not putting interesting mechanisms into the

[20:13] game or unique layout into the game, if you're just making a pretty Pimball machine that's

[20:19] pretty basic, I don't know how you find buyers nowadays.

[20:25] This is the thing.

[20:26] They're not just competing with other manufacturers.

[20:28] There are so many use games for sale right now.

[20:32] Amazing prices.

[20:33] It is the best time to be a Pimball buyer right now because you can get so many good titles

[20:38] for cheap.

[20:40] It's really hard to be like, well, I'm not going to get that mint condition dialed in

[20:45] L.E. for $6,500.

[20:47] I'm going to get suncoast Pimballs, Cosmic Carnival for $5,500.

[20:54] I don't know how you justify it.

[20:56] We'll see how it does.

[20:57] I'm not even know.

[20:58] You've got guys like Haggis Pimball coming out with stuff and I don't understand.

[21:04] I feel like there's not a lot of white space.

[21:07] There is more opportunity for companies to fail than succeed.

[21:12] We're not even mentioning deep-rood.

[21:14] When are they going to finally reveal what their plans are?

[21:17] We're supposed to hear something June 1st.

[21:20] There's a rumored title going around that they're making.

[21:23] I'm not going to talk about it.

[21:24] I had a respect for Jeff at this week in Pimball.

[21:28] You might hear some mumblings out there about it.

[21:32] We should know more about what their plans are come early June.

[21:38] What else is going on?

[21:39] My thing is this.

[21:41] I've been away from Pinside for like a week, five days.

[21:45] I've been thinking about one thing.

[21:47] This thing has been on my mind for a while.

[21:50] I do want to just share what's been on my mind because I do think that there's not a lot

[21:54] of news.

[21:55] But here's, when there's not news, it doesn't mean you guys stop thinking about Pimball.

[21:59] The one thing that's been on my mind recently is this.

[22:01] I really think Stern needs a special game.

[22:04] I want to be wowed by them again.

[22:09] I'm going to be honest when I say that the last game that when they pulled the curtain

[22:14] off of it that really made me go wow.

[22:17] It's Ghostbusters.

[22:19] And I still think that Ghostbusters is the last world under glass that was, they really

[22:24] nailed it.

[22:25] They just knocked it out of the park.

[22:27] And even when I look at Ghostbusters today, I can't help but want that game.

[22:32] I just want that game so badly to be good.

[22:36] And it's just not a good shooter.

[22:38] But it is so amazing to look at.

[22:41] They just nailed it with the artwork, with like the theme.

[22:45] Something about Ghostbusters should have been one of the greatest Pimball machines ever.

[22:50] And Stern has sold a ton of Ghostbusters, but it just feels like on Ghostbusters, they

[22:55] just gave us more.

[22:57] They just went a little bit extra on it.

[22:59] And I think the point, the part of it that I love.

[23:02] And again, this is just a small detail, but it's an important detail I think in terms

[23:06] of showing Stern's effort.

[23:08] Like they made the Slimer Mac.

[23:10] An original Mac.

[23:11] They made Slimer.

[23:12] He was really cool.

[23:13] He was astragging across the playfield.

[23:15] It was kind of weird.

[23:16] But look at the city sculpt on top of the pop bumpers.

[23:20] Like that.

[23:21] I love that.

[23:22] We haven't seen Stern do anything interesting on top of the pop bumper area in a really long

[23:26] time.

[23:27] Yet the Ectogoggles.

[23:28] All right.

[23:29] It wasn't like the greatest Mac, but at least they tried.

[23:31] You have the Magnuslings in the game.

[23:33] Very, very cool.

[23:34] I don't think they were very implemented as best as they could have been.

[23:38] I would have had, how do you not have Ghost grabbing the ball?

[23:43] Dracula where it moves the ball across the playfield and you have to hit it to start a

[23:46] multiple.

[23:47] I don't know why they never really fully made use of the magnets in that game as good

[23:51] as they could have.

[23:53] But still, I want to see Stern give us a game that has that kind of effect on people.

[24:00] And it had that effect on me.

[24:01] So do we think we're going to get a wow game from Stern sometime this summer?

[24:06] Now, is it going to be Godzilla?

[24:08] Is it going to be Jurassic World?

[24:10] I don't know.

[24:11] I mean, obviously these things are not as great as Ghostbusters in terms of theme.

[24:16] But I'm really hoping Stern does something mechanically that wows us.

[24:20] And I don't think that's a lot to ask.

[24:22] But I do think Stern has done everything else we've asked for.

[24:27] They've gone back and given us some great nostalgic themes.

[24:31] They've increased the artwork on their games to a level that is now the best in pinball.

[24:36] It just is.

[24:37] Nothing looks as good as a Stern game artistically.

[24:40] The coding in their games hit or miss hit or miss.

[24:43] But you can't argue with the fact that they still give us some of the best coded pinball

[24:47] games.

[24:48] You might have to wait a little bit for it.

[24:50] But anyone who's buying a lime and sheets game knows that they're capable of giving you

[24:54] deep rule sets.

[24:56] The only thing missing, like the final piece of the pie is the mechanical part of the game.

[25:02] And doing something mechanically that just is like incredible and mesmerizing to watch

[25:08] in pinball.

[25:09] And look, maybe it's just because the bean counters are in control over at Stern and they're

[25:14] not going to invest in stuff that could be too mechanically complex.

[25:19] They don't want their games to break.

[25:20] And they almost probably they probably can sit back and say we don't need to do that because

[25:25] look we're the only real player in town and we're selling these games as is.

[25:30] Why should we go the extra mile?

[25:33] And the reason why I just hope they go the extra mile is this.

[25:36] And again, this is just my opinion.

[25:39] People don't like hold me accountable for this in your world.

[25:44] Make up your own mind.

[25:45] But I believe that Stern games are good.

[25:50] But I just don't think that so many of these games are going to go down 10 years from now

[25:55] as being like classics.

[25:57] And that's what I want them to create is something that just over time holds up and still has

[26:05] that wow 10 years from now the way it does today.

[26:10] And I just I'm not seeing it mechanically from them very much or very often.

[26:14] And that's that's what I hope they're doing.

[26:16] I hope they've they've checked every other box.

[26:19] And I think they're going to come out with some internet stuff that's going to surprise

[26:21] people.

[26:22] But other than that, you know, that's what's going on.

[26:24] All right.

[26:25] Anything else going on in pinball, Jack Danger is sharing comps and Photoshop versions of

[26:31] Pokemon and what a little shop of horrors.

[26:34] And I think there was like one more and then there's like Christopher Franchi shared some

[26:38] rocky picture horror show.

[26:40] Look, this is going to be the new thing now.

[26:44] People are going to share some, you know, Photoshopped versions of games and put it out into

[26:49] the world.

[26:50] And it's easy to test people's reaction to stuff with a simple Photoshop job.

[26:55] And someone did something with the Harry Potter as well recently.

[26:58] And there's sort of, I think there's a Harry Potter virtual pinball experience coming

[27:02] out.

[27:03] But look, I mean, I don't really want to get excited about artwork dropped on cabinets.

[27:10] I want to get excited about real machines that will really be available to buy that I can

[27:16] put in my real home and have real enjoyment over.

[27:19] Of course, it's fun to speculate and wonder what could come out.

[27:24] But I don't know.

[27:25] I mean, I'm sort of at the point now where I don't think there's a lot of mystery coming

[27:30] from Jersey Jack.

[27:31] We know it's going to be Guns and Roses and Toy Story.

[27:34] Stern has done a better job of keeping the leaks under wraps.

[27:38] But I think it's safe to say we're going to see a Jurassic World.

[27:41] We definitely know we're going to see a Vyra 3.

[27:44] Godzilla as well is in the cards.

[27:47] See, if there was one theme that I think people would love to be surprised by, I think

[27:52] it would be jaws.

[27:53] I think people still really are clamoring for jaws.

[27:56] I think that movie is still one of the most popular movies.

[27:59] It's held up over time.

[28:02] I was listening to Head to Head Pimball and they were talking about something and I sort

[28:06] of feel like they're right when they say this.

[28:09] Marty and his co-host, sorry, his name escapes me.

[28:14] I think it's from New York.

[28:15] They were talking, let me pull it up now because I do hate when I, that's just lazy on

[28:19] my part and I don't do show notes.

[28:21] But I want to make sure I give credit to who was talking about this.

[28:25] So you're just going to wait with me.

[28:26] So Joe Lemir, I think that's how you pronounce his name.

[28:29] They were talking about how the LCD screen could be really hurting Pimball when it comes

[28:35] to acquiring themes nowadays because you have an LCD.

[28:40] You now want to be able to fill that with HD visuals of the game.

[28:46] This Pimball is a lower volume toy compared to arcade games and video games.

[28:53] The amount of money it would take to get the rights to those clips does not make financial

[28:58] sense for Pimball companies.

[29:00] So thus, we may be seeing a lot less of the themes we want because of the LCD.

[29:07] And I kind of think there's something to that.

[29:11] I know when we heard that Spooky Pimball passed on Evil Dead and it was because of a licensing

[29:18] issue, it was one of the people associated with the Evil Dead wanted more money.

[29:22] But the cost per game to make that happen would have been an increase of $250 more.

[29:30] See this is the dilemma I have with all these licensing deals is it's like you kind of

[29:38] feel like yes, you want to have certain elements like you want to have Sigorn, you weaver

[29:42] in alien, I mean, she was in Ghostbusters and you kind of want to say, well, if we need

[29:48] all the to get all the necessary assets and actors and all the callouts and video clips,

[29:54] it's going to cost this much.

[29:56] And so, but if the theme is popular enough, I think these manufacturers need to do it because

[30:03] I just see the guys in this hobby and they do have enough money to front for those

[30:09] increases and assets and I think they would do it.

[30:12] You know, and I didn't want to talk about Wonka, but I'm just going to wait and see what

[30:15] happens there, but it just feels like it's going to be a lot like, I don't know, like

[30:18] pirates and is it even more frustrating than pirates because you're seeing clips, but

[30:23] you're not hearing the audio go with them.

[30:25] But is this the new reality that the LCD is going to make theme integration really difficult?

[30:32] Much more expensive and require too much of these manufacturers so that they're going

[30:38] to end up passing on stuff.

[30:39] But then, but see, then I see a game like the Big Lebowski and yeah, they had some hurdles

[30:45] with licensing issues with the music and whatnot, but ultimately look at everything they

[30:50] put into that game and look at how well it was integrated into the theme and they had

[30:54] just the right amount of clips of the movie and then it gives me hope that if Dutch

[30:59] Pimbal, two guys who could barely run a business, who have still squandered all these

[31:04] people's money, but two guys from the Netherlands could figure out how to make I think one of

[31:10] the most amazing Pimbal games ever, then surely Jersey Jack and Stern can give us a game

[31:16] that Dutch Pimbal gave us and can be equal in terms of picking the right theme with the

[31:22] right amount of assets and the right mechanical stuff under glass.

[31:26] Because if they could do it, I really think these big manufacturers should be able to figure

[31:30] it out too.

[31:31] All right.

[31:32] All right.

[31:33] What else is going on in Pimbal?

[31:34] I'm trying to see if there's been anything else.

[31:36] No, we haven't heard any, there's not really that much drama.

[31:39] I mean, it's summertime.

[31:41] It's the time when you got to get out there and enjoy the nice weather and not be stuck inside

[31:45] complaining about Pimbal issues.

[31:48] I think everyone also gets a lot more positive in the summertime.

[31:51] I know for a lot of us out there, the weather determines our mood and we're coming into spring

[31:58] summer, which is always a nice time to be out and about.

[32:02] So I think that's pretty much it.

[32:03] I'm going to have a few more guests join the show in the near future.

[32:07] One of them I'm excited about.

[32:09] It's my financial advisor is going to join and talk about the financials of collecting

[32:15] Pimbal machines.

[32:17] And it's interesting because whenever we go down my financial asset sheet, there's always

[32:21] like these Pimbal games and they are assets.

[32:24] And I think out of all the things you could invest in from an entertainment standpoint,

[32:29] Pimbal still holds up as probably one of the best places to put your money for a non-essential

[32:36] toy.

[32:37] Almost everything else goes down in value significantly.

[32:40] So I'm going to have her on and we're going to talk a little bit about maybe, questions

[32:43] just like at what point should you buy like a $10,000 Pimbal machine?

[32:49] Should you buy a $10,000 Pimbal machine when you have X amount saved or I'm just curious

[32:54] what a true financial advisor's advice would be because I don't know about you, but a

[32:59] lot of my purchases are very emotional and not very rational.

[33:05] While I financially can do something, should I?

[33:09] And then how do you balance that out between living for the day or today and living

[33:13] for tomorrow?

[33:14] And that's who we all struggle with that on some level.

[33:18] Some of you guys out there just have like Ferraris and like multiple houses and I love you

[33:21] guys.

[33:22] One day, I hope to have maybe two houses and maybe five bulldogs and maybe eight Pimbal

[33:28] machines and a couple cars.

[33:31] But ultimately, the only thing I really want to have is just my health and my happiness.

[33:36] And if I can find those things, I'll feel content.

[33:40] You know, say coming back from Ireland, it's amazing to be around people who just know

[33:45] how to live life.

[33:47] It's incredible.

[33:48] They have a way about them that is infectious and magnetic and enjoyable and just to grab

[33:55] a pint in a pub at like 4.30 on a Thursday and everyone's just having a great time.

[34:02] It's incredible.

[34:04] Sometimes I feel like we put ourselves into too much drama that we're on the internet

[34:10] too much.

[34:11] You know, Pinside is interesting to me because after three years, it almost feels to me now

[34:17] going there gets less and less appealing to me, which does make my job harder as a

[34:22] podcaster.

[34:23] I know the other podcasters out there feel the same way.

[34:26] You know, I want to give a shout out to all those guys out there who are doing it on a

[34:29] weekly basis.

[34:30] It's not always easy.

[34:32] And it just gets less and less fun to go on to like these forums and just see the same

[34:39] arguing and bickering and name calling because you know, it just gets old.

[34:44] It just does.

[34:45] I mean, you can't keep surrounding yourself with it.

[34:49] And you know, I think the next generation coming up, it's really interesting.

[34:54] The stats about them, they go out less, they hang out with their friends less, they drink

[34:59] less, they have less sex.

[35:02] They're addicted to their devices.

[35:04] And so, and even though they're healthy or physically, the next generation, I think it's

[35:08] Gen Z. These are kids.

[35:09] These are maybe your kids if they're teenagers or whatnot.

[35:12] The next generation coming up, they're the most mentally unhappy generation ever.

[35:18] So it's basically depressing them living online.

[35:23] And I think the same can be said for pinball enthusiasts is that it gets to a point where

[35:30] when you live too much online, you will naturally start to lean towards the negative.

[35:35] And I think this shows been a lot more positive.

[35:38] I think we've struggled at times with getting into the drama too much.

[35:43] And I hope you enjoy it.

[35:44] I hope you enjoy the way we do the show now.

[35:46] I hope you enjoy the interviews.

[35:48] I still don't think we hold back.

[35:49] I think we still say what we feel.

[35:51] But I think we're less and less consumed by a lot of the online negativity and just

[35:57] sort of like vitriol that's just always stewing on there because there's not much else

[36:01] to talk about.

[36:02] And my final point will be this.

[36:04] I'll talk about the monsters and then I'll let the show go into the interwebs.

[36:11] The monsters is interesting because as much as you get a few people complaining, I've

[36:15] been going into the thread more and more and it's just people like enjoying their game.

[36:20] It's people enjoying it, loving the way it shoots, like having it in their homes, like

[36:24] having fun with the monsters.

[36:25] Now that's not the popular stance to have on the game.

[36:29] The popular stance about the monsters is just to complain about the code, say it sucks,

[36:33] say Dwight doesn't like the theme at all and just go down this rabbit hole of like why

[36:39] the monsters is a miss.

[36:41] And so I tend to sort of feel like while it might not be the game for the person who likes

[36:47] deep code, the shot layout seems to be one that people are really enjoying and maybe we

[36:53] should try to look at the good in these games versus only the bad.

[36:58] But who knows?

[36:59] You know, everyone make up your own opinion on these games.

[37:01] But I'll just say like I just see a lot more positivity happening now that people are

[37:05] just getting their games and having a chance to enjoy them.

[37:09] And I think a lot, I think people are just getting tired of all the negativity.

[37:13] That's that's I'll just leave it at that.

[37:15] Okay.

[37:16] All right, everyone enjoy episode 357 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[37:21] We'll get Niels interview up.

[37:22] We'll get my interview with the financial advisor up.

[37:25] And then we look forward to seeing what's cooking over at Deeproot because that's that's

[37:28] it, man.

[37:29] I don't think we're going to see anything from Stern until July.

[37:32] So it's going to be a lonely, a lonely news month for all of us pinball podcasters out

[37:38] there.

[37:39] Maybe we all, I was saying this, maybe we all should just take off the month of June.

[37:43] We deserve it.

[37:44] All of us.

[37:45] We should collectively.

[37:46] Are you hearing me Marty?

[37:47] Slam tilt, slap save.

[37:49] Everybody can over special when lit.

[37:52] Everybody, let's take the month of June off.

[37:56] Let's give ourselves four weeks of just like, like, like, like, let's recover.

[38:03] Let's let some of the news just happen and let's go on vacation from doing this on a weekly

[38:08] basis.

[38:09] Should I start with that now?

[38:10] Well, let's let's let them decide.

[38:12] Maybe we all get together and unionize and take off.

[38:15] Anyway, everyone, have a great day.

[38:16] I'll talk to you soon.
