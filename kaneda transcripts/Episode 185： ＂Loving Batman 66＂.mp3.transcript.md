[00:00] Welcome to episode 185 of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[00:25] I'm your host, Canada, and I'm super happy to talk Pimball again because I finally, after so

[00:31] many months have a working Pimball machine, we're going to talk all about Batman 66 and

[00:37] a little bit.

[00:38] I'm going to give you my sort of 48 hours with the machine review.

[00:43] Super, super happy with the game.

[00:45] I'm going to explain why I think this game is very special and why I picked it.

[00:49] But of all the games out there, I could have got.

[00:52] I picked this one that I once hated and I'm going to explain why.

[00:57] Magic Girl is gone.

[00:59] It's left the building.

[01:00] It is out of here.

[01:02] I was laughing because on Pinsides, someone wrote the following.

[01:05] I want to read this.

[01:07] Let's see.

[01:08] It came from Pinside User.

[01:13] C-N-K, like C-N-K-A-Y, he said, well, our band friends smart enough and got rid of his

[01:22] magic girl.

[01:23] I was shocked that he did admit to a loss.

[01:27] I was sure any sale of magic girl would be like most folks trips to Las Vegas are.

[01:33] You know, everyone always wins.

[01:35] I'm guessing if you got anywhere near 10,000 he did okay.

[01:40] I still wonder who would possibly want this title, however.

[01:44] Chime in buyer, inquiring minds want to know.

[01:47] So C-N-K from East Aurora, New York, you think if I sold magic girl for $10,000, I did

[01:55] okay.

[01:56] I bought the machine for $23,000.

[02:02] There are only 20 or so known games in existence.

[02:06] Most of them are tucked away in private collections.

[02:11] Most of them will probably never even be taken out of a box.

[02:15] Let alone set up, let alone YouTube videos showing the world that it didn't really work.

[02:21] I mean, I think the whole magic girl's saga for the most part, people expect it to get

[02:26] the game, be a show for it.

[02:28] And I did anything but that.

[02:30] I actually told the truth every step of the way.

[02:33] I've always told the truth on this podcast and I'll tell you this truthfully.

[02:38] I'm not going to tell you how much money I lost on it.

[02:40] I'll say you can count the amount of thousands that I lost on one hand.

[02:47] And it's not your full hand, okay, that you'd be counting.

[02:50] So I lost some money.

[02:52] I didn't lose a ton.

[02:55] Magic girl is still a valuable machine.

[02:56] Anyone who thinks magic girls are going to be selling for $10,000 are smoking crack.

[03:02] These things are super, super rare.

[03:05] There's a huge story behind them.

[03:07] They're a novelty collectible item.

[03:09] Anyone who values like a prototype of a King Kong that doesn't really work, put a King

[03:15] Kong next to Magic Girl.

[03:17] Magic Girl looks a thousand times nicer, probably even shoots better.

[03:23] And he's just a beautiful, beautiful work of art.

[03:26] Yes, it doesn't work.

[03:27] It doesn't work in the traditional sense of a machine, but you can flip it and have a pinball

[03:32] experience in quotes.

[03:35] The owner is a terrific gentleman.

[03:37] He's a great guy.

[03:39] The game will be going to him shortly.

[03:41] And I'm happy where it's going.

[03:42] It's going to the right place.

[03:43] I don't know why people want to sort of point fingers at Magic Girl buyers and say like

[03:49] what are you doing?

[03:52] People get different kinds of enjoyment out of this hobby.

[03:56] All right.

[03:58] What is going on in the pinball world?

[04:00] There's not too much news going on.

[04:02] It's that time of year.

[04:04] It's that time of year where we're heading into the holidays.

[04:07] Manufacturers don't really release much news.

[04:10] There's not that much going on.

[04:11] But what does happen in December is the rumor mill starts going crazy.

[04:18] People have nothing legitimate to talk about so they make shit up.

[04:23] But I get a whole host of rumors come my way.

[04:27] People maybe want to hear me talk about it on the air.

[04:30] They might want me to spoil some stuff.

[04:33] And I want to revisit a few rumors that I've been talking about.

[04:37] And I think some of them are coming closer to being confirmations, even if they aren't

[04:42] confirmed by the manufacturer.

[04:44] Now here's the rumor I said last time.

[04:46] When I went off and said anyone who thinks that Jersey Jack Pinball is going to re-theme

[04:50] one of its games is an idiot, people came back to me and said, Chris, you might want to

[04:57] rethink this.

[04:58] I'm hearing pretty good information that a re-theme might be in the works.

[05:03] Now here are the rumors of different kinds of re-theme scenarios.

[05:07] And you pick what you think might be realistic.

[05:10] A, you could think that there are no re-theme coming because Jersey Jack only has four machines

[05:16] and to remake a layout now would be suicide for them.

[05:19] And people would just cry that they're out of money and they can't afford to R&D a new

[05:22] game.

[05:23] So that's a, I kind of am still in Camp A right now.

[05:28] B would be the rumor is that Wizard of Oz is going to be re-themed as Willie Wonka.

[05:36] Okay?

[05:38] Does that make sense?

[05:39] I don't really know, right?

[05:42] I mean, if you think about it, you've got two upper playfields.

[05:46] You could just change the molds and those upper playfields to be different sections of

[05:50] the chocolate factory.

[05:52] You do have that flying monkey that takes the ball up.

[05:54] That could be the scene in Willie Wonka where the kid gets stuck in the tube.

[05:58] You don't, you know, you could change the pop bumper trees to like, I don't know, Oompa

[06:03] Loompa's or whatever you wanted to turn it into.

[06:06] So ostensibly, yes, you could re-themed Wizard of Oz into Willie Wonka.

[06:12] You know what I'm saying?

[06:13] Because there's not like just something that's so specific to the Wizard of Oz that couldn't

[06:18] be switched over.

[06:20] You know, instead of the witch coming up, it could be Charlie's elevator that goes up from

[06:24] underneath the playfield.

[06:26] So the possibility is there.

[06:28] Do I want them to do that?

[06:29] No.

[06:30] The reason why I've never really fully liked the Wizard of Oz layout.

[06:35] I've always felt that game just didn't have much flow.

[06:39] It felt a little clunky.

[06:40] I just don't think it's one of Balsar's best.

[06:43] I think that game has run its course and I hope they don't do that.

[06:50] Now the other rumor I heard recently and this is interesting.

[06:54] This is really interesting.

[06:56] It doesn't seem to make much sense but I could see this happening.

[07:00] Because that dialed in is going to be re-themed as toy story.

[07:06] And the reason why possibly is that dialed in is an amazing game, so much money.

[07:13] I mean, probably over a million dollars was spent on Ding and making this game over a

[07:17] five-year period.

[07:19] But it's not the hottest theme.

[07:21] You know, part of me thinks Jack might have thought that Pat Lawler's return would

[07:25] be equal five to $8,000 games being sold.

[07:29] The theme just isn't speaking to people nearly enough.

[07:34] And it's a great game.

[07:35] So does it make sense to take all that great work, all that engineering that Pat put into

[07:41] dialed in and simply transfer it over to toy story and make it a toy story game?

[07:48] Okay.

[07:49] Now let that simmer for a minute.

[07:52] The reason why I don't want that to be the case.

[07:53] I'll tell you why.

[07:55] Because a theme like toy story deserves an original layout.

[08:00] It deserves a game to be designed around the elements of toy story.

[08:06] So there has to be a scene where Buzz and Woody go flying.

[08:11] There is nothing in the dialed in layout or the mechanisms or the machine right now that

[08:18] would simulate that.

[08:20] To me, you need to have Buzz and Woody going flying or falling with style.

[08:27] Sort of go across the whole play field from the top to the bottom and they come flying

[08:31] down.

[08:32] You have to have that.

[08:33] How do you not design that into a toy story?

[08:35] You also want a mechanism in toy story.

[08:38] How cool would a lower mechanism be that's a crane game?

[08:41] You actually lower a crane, a small crane, and have to pick up one of the alien figures.

[08:46] How cool would that be and drop it into the return slot or whatever.

[08:52] So that would be amazing.

[08:54] So if they're re-thining toy story, I think that's a big mistake.

[08:59] I don't want to believe it.

[09:02] I don't think it to be true.

[09:03] I think every time we get rumors about Jersey Jack being in financial trouble and having

[09:08] to cut corners, they've never cut a corner on a game.

[09:14] There's no Jersey Jack game that's come out that looks like they tried to save money

[09:17] on, that looks like they put something cheap in because they couldn't afford something

[09:22] else.

[09:23] Pire to the Caribbean looks jam packed.

[09:26] So take it for what you will, but those are the rumors that are circulating around Jersey

[09:30] Jack Pimball right now.

[09:33] The rumor over at Highway Pimball right now is that clean is definitely the next title.

[09:38] It's not even like a rumor.

[09:39] So they're really working hard to try and get clean out the door.

[09:44] We all collectively have watched Highway Pimball continue to struggle.

[09:49] The refund amount that is now owed on Pint side is $40,000.

[09:53] And that's probably not even indicative of all the money that's owed to people who

[09:58] want out.

[09:59] They're still struggling to get the game out.

[10:01] It's December what, 10th today.

[10:04] It's really, really been hard for these guys to get their shit together.

[10:08] I think they walked into a situation that was unfortunate.

[10:11] I don't think they're going to really want to be in this much longer.

[10:15] I don't.

[10:16] I think they might announce clean at Texas Pimball Festival.

[10:21] It's going to be a weird reception to clean.

[10:23] I don't think clean, I mean, I love the music.

[10:26] I just don't really think clean Pimball made by Highway Pimball, a company that's struggled

[10:34] that, you know, to make machines.

[10:36] I don't think anything announced early by Highway Pimball does anything for them.

[10:40] I really don't.

[10:42] I don't know what they're going to try and do.

[10:45] This is what my guess is.

[10:46] I think they're going to try and get people to move their alien dollars over maybe to

[10:52] clean pre-orders, maybe, but like there's such radically different themes.

[10:57] Like alien fans don't really necessarily want a clean Pimball machine.

[11:02] I think they're going, the rumor is they're going to scrap Andrew Highway's back box and

[11:08] cabinet set up and go back to more of a traditional Valley Williams cabinet, which would be much

[11:13] cheaper and easier to do.

[11:15] Their whole modular system is going to be scrapped as well in terms of taking one game out

[11:21] and putting it into another cabinet.

[11:23] I think, you know, it's December 2017.

[11:27] It's about time everyone finally realizes the ultimate conclusion of Andrew Highway's

[11:34] Pimball run was total failure.

[11:37] It was total failure annihilation.

[11:40] Everything he changed and neat wanted to do to improve Pimball was unnecessary, unimportant

[11:47] and ultimately led to the company collapsing.

[11:50] If all he had done was make a better stern, he would have been fine or just make a Pimball

[11:56] machine the way spooky made Pimball machines and he would have been fine.

[11:59] The orders would have been there and he would have got games out.

[12:03] I think people that think they need to reinvent Pimball.

[12:08] Everyone who's tried to do that has failed, has failed to ship games, has failed to ship

[12:14] games in volume and has done nothing more than basically identify a problem that doesn't

[12:21] really exist.

[12:22] And that's a big mistake in marketing.

[12:24] When you go into a category and you say we have to reinvent this and reinvent that and

[12:29] reinvent all these things.

[12:31] Why?

[12:32] Why would you say that when stern Pimball is shipping thousands of games, thousands of

[12:37] games a year and you're new to market and you're trying to improve upon a model that is

[12:42] currently successful.

[12:44] The only way, the only thing I would do, the only white space I would do, I would just

[12:50] beat stern on getting a good theme and getting a good product out there and I would also,

[12:55] I would go after them in terms of the high end collector side of the market.

[12:59] I wouldn't try and reinvent all the pieces in the machine.

[13:02] I mean, it's stupid.

[13:03] It's absolutely stupid.

[13:05] Jersey Jack did it right.

[13:08] Once he got the money going but he tried to do too much and charge too little but he basically

[13:13] made what is equivalent to a Valley Williams game in 2014, 2015 and ongoing.

[13:24] Now, I think what's plaguing a lot of these companies too.

[13:27] This is just sort of happening around Pinside.

[13:30] A lot of issues with these games.

[13:31] A lot of issues with dialed in.

[13:34] A lot of issues with alien.

[13:36] A lot of issues with some of the modern sterns and that's part of Pimball ownership and

[13:43] it's part of having these games.

[13:45] I'm going to talk a little bit about this when I talk about my Batman because I had an

[13:49] issue that I want to address with the game already and what that creates for a buyer

[13:56] of this toy.

[13:58] You don't buy a Xbox or a PlayStation or Nintendo Switch and an hour later you've got your

[14:05] screwdriver out and you're tinkering around with it so you can start playing your game

[14:09] again.

[14:11] That only costs you like $200-$300 and your game on all the time.

[14:17] It'll never break down for years.

[14:21] A lot of issues are hitting these games too.

[14:24] Maintenance issues continue to be a part of this hobby and I think maintenance issues,

[14:29] they do one thing.

[14:30] They basically scare out of the hobby.

[14:33] People who don't want to get their hands dirty working on a Pimball machine.

[14:38] I personally enjoy working on Pimball machines.

[14:40] I wish I was better at soldering and doing some of the mechanical stuff.

[14:43] I do enjoy doing the mods.

[14:45] I do enjoy tinkering around to make sure everything's working right to getting the machine going.

[14:51] What else is going on in the Pimball news world?

[14:54] I'm trying to think, I've covered Jersey Jack.

[14:58] I'm still curious to see how pirates is going to do.

[15:01] I talk about this one with a lot of my friends.

[15:04] I think pirates are the Caribbean.

[15:07] It's all going to come down to code and the experience of playing that game for people

[15:12] at T.P.F.

[15:13] I think T.P.F. is going to be a watershed moment for that game.

[15:16] Now that it's no longer new, it's going to come down to gameplay.

[15:22] If they're able to get the adrenaline going, knowing the limitations of the theme and

[15:28] the IP that they have.

[15:31] I don't want to say more on it.

[15:32] I actually want to go to Jersey Jack and jump on a machine sometime when they have one

[15:36] there for me to play.

[15:37] I look forward to playing it.

[15:39] I'm still in on my collector's edition of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:44] There's no harm in being in on it.

[15:46] I mean, why not?

[15:47] Why wouldn't anyone go in on a collector's edition when you can simply get your spot

[15:52] refunded if you decide not to go in on it a little bit later?

[15:56] All right.

[15:57] Let's talk about Dutch Pimbal.

[15:59] Dutch Pimbal is still sort of in this hiatus period where they're figuring out how to build

[16:05] these games in China.

[16:08] If you read the thread now, if you read the thread, people have sort of kind of, for the

[16:13] most part, given up.

[16:15] There's sort of like not a chance in hell with those ever-happened kind of attitude.

[16:21] There's still the rumors that the show they did in the Netherlands.

[16:24] It was kind of like a Frankenstein game of new parts and old machines and just sort of

[16:30] convinced people that things were going smoothly.

[16:34] I still think there's interest in the Big Lebowski, but not nearly as much as there was.

[16:40] If you look at the current game right now, I think the owners of the Big Lebowski are

[16:47] going to have got to be contemplating.

[16:49] Maybe now is a good time to cash out.

[16:51] Speaking of that, we just saw on Pinside a Big Lebowski go up for sale in Ridley Park

[16:58] PA for $15,000.

[17:02] The gentleman selling it says everything is working.

[17:05] $15,000.

[17:06] He says it's 100% perfect.

[17:10] Local sale he wants.

[17:11] It's number 30 of the Big Lebowski.

[17:13] I'm wondering if he got this one from CoinTaker.

[17:19] I try to put myself in the mindset of $15 for a Big Lebowski.

[17:25] Is that a good price?

[17:27] That is about roughly a little bit more than $7,000 more than the person bought it for.

[17:35] People got these games originally for $8,500.

[17:38] You're almost doubling your money.

[17:41] If they never make more Big Lebowski's, we've

[17:43] talked about this game could skyrocket in value.

[17:46] But maybe not.

[17:48] And here's why.

[17:49] Here's what I think is happening.

[17:50] And I think my magic girl purchased and sale.

[17:53] I think it taught me a lesson.

[17:55] And I think, hopefully, for the thousands of people who listen to this show and know my

[17:59] story, I think it's also teaching a lesson to other people out there in the hobby.

[18:05] That if you have a rare game, owning it doesn't necessarily mean it's fun to own.

[18:13] But if the story around that game is negative, and what I mean by that, is anyone who owns

[18:18] a kingpin or a king Kong, there's nothing negative about the story of those games.

[18:25] There's nothing negative about owning one.

[18:29] There's nobody who was burned by the people who created those games.

[18:34] They became just like relics that were tossed away pretty much and no one really thought

[18:39] at the time that they'd be worth so much money.

[18:43] But if you buy a Big Lebowski, if you buy a magic girl, it's hard to own these machines

[18:49] and feel good about them because you know that for your one machine, there's like 50

[18:56] guys out there that are pissed off, that have lost thousands of dollars, that hate the

[19:02] fact that Dutch Pimbal took their money and gave them nothing.

[19:06] Same thing with Alien, same thing with Magic Girl and Raza, and all these other games

[19:12] where people basically lost money on them and they're still waiting for something.

[19:17] I was talking to a friend yesterday, how crazy is it?

[19:21] Imagine if someone went in on Raza Fully, on Big Lebowski, and on Alien Ellie.

[19:28] Imagine if the person pre-ordered all three of those games basically three years ago when

[19:34] you could, they would have had something along the lines of like $25,000 that they gave

[19:43] to Pimbal manufacturers and they don't have one Pimbal machine.

[19:47] Think about how that person feels.

[19:50] It's just really hard to own these things, knowing that there's such vitriol and anger

[19:58] by the community around the companies who are making these games.

[20:03] For all the shit people give Stern.

[20:05] For all the complainers about Stern, for all the, you know, the Stern's cheap, the qualities

[20:12] crap to this, to that, to this, to that, Stern has never taken anyone's money and not given

[20:18] them a product.

[20:20] Stern has always allowed people to play the games before they order them.

[20:25] Stern, you know, every once in a while has like an Ellie people buy before they play it,

[20:30] and that sucks.

[20:31] I've sort of narrowed down that there's like really, there's really two things that have

[20:37] destroyed the fun and sucked the life out of the hobby for so many people.

[20:42] Alright, maybe three things, and I would say those things are the pre-order model has

[20:47] made it so shitty for so many people.

[20:51] It sucked the life out of the hobby that so many people paid money for something and they

[20:56] never got it or they got it years after it was promised to them.

[21:00] So that sucked.

[21:02] I think the pre-order model is pretty much dead.

[21:05] Alright, which is good.

[21:06] Okay.

[21:07] The other thing that really just sucked the life out of the hobby and still continues to

[21:13] is releasing a game that's not even nearly finished.

[21:16] A game with code that is embarrassingly bad, releasing with code that is in beta form.

[21:23] Just to keep your line moving, you're making new buyers, be your guinea pigs, and I think

[21:29] that sucks the life out of the hobby.

[21:31] You know, I look at Batman right now, I'm going to get into my review in a second.

[21:34] But as much fun as I'm having, I can't imagine owning this machine for an entire year, an

[21:39] entire year, and having shit code on it, and not having anything to really do in the game.

[21:45] Sorry, I just knocked over my Telegreen O'Bottle.

[21:47] It's fancy over here.

[21:50] I look at the build date on this game, on the back of it, sorry I'm crouching, it says

[21:53] December 27th, 2016 this game was built.

[21:59] And it is finally, finally at a place where I think it would be acceptable to ship it.

[22:05] Okay, a year later.

[22:07] So that is sucked the life out of the hobby.

[22:08] And Stern continues to be guilty of this.

[22:11] Continues to ship games with very, very bad code.

[22:15] And the other thing, you know, I would say besides code is quality, right?

[22:20] Get quality in a game, getting a game, and on day one, you turn it on, and there's

[22:26] something wrong with it.

[22:27] You turn it on, and the play field is messed up.

[22:30] You turn it on, and the cabinets crack and right away.

[22:33] I think those three things continue to be things that give people pause.

[22:40] And I think over the last five years, since I've even been following this hobby, those

[22:46] three things have pushed people out of the hobby.

[22:49] They've also forced manufacturers to change the way they do business.

[22:53] Stern hasn't changed with code.

[22:55] Their quality can be very questionable at times, but they've never taken money.

[23:01] So at least you get something, which is more than a lock and say when it comes to these

[23:04] other companies, right?

[23:06] All right.

[23:07] Oh, I'm looking at Batman.

[23:09] I'm looking at Batman.

[23:10] Let's talk about Batman 66 and my experience with it.

[23:14] And so for you guys out there, if you haven't followed me on Facebook or seen anything that

[23:18] I've been uploading, I have in my possession a Batman super limited edition.

[23:25] And I want to thank Chris at CoinTaker.

[23:28] He had one new inbox, brand new inbox, super limited edition.

[23:33] And I had some credit with him, and he also had an L.E. new inbox.

[23:39] And I was like, dude, I'll take it.

[23:41] And he was like, all right.

[23:43] And when we went down there and we spent the whole day putting the mods in it, he was like,

[23:48] oh, like I probably should have kept this one.

[23:50] And you know what I'm excited about?

[23:52] Is I heard that for each game, Adam West personally recorded call out to the owner.

[24:00] It's going to, they're going to unlock that in every S.L.E owner's game.

[24:04] They, he recorded that.

[24:06] It's not in the game yet.

[24:07] And it's going to say something like Robert pick up, you know, get to the bat phone, Robert,

[24:12] which is awesome.

[24:14] But you know, I bought someone else's machine.

[24:18] So it's going to be weird for me.

[24:20] So serendipitously, I bought Chris Marquette's machine at CoinTaker.

[24:26] So hopefully this one is coded to say Chris, get to the bat phone.

[24:30] And that'll just be awesome.

[24:31] So it could, it could all work out.

[24:33] Unreal.

[24:34] I would have, I would have loved to have told Stern to program mine to say, canada, get

[24:38] to the bat phone.

[24:40] I would have, or like, canada, you are banned from Pinside, get to the bat phone.

[24:44] You know, I would have like paid even more to have Adam West say something very, very

[24:47] personalized.

[24:48] All right, let's talk about the game itself.

[24:50] So the game is beautiful.

[24:51] I'm not going to, you guys have seen the S.L.E.s in person.

[24:55] The metallic decals are incredible.

[24:58] I know Stern is going to use these on more games moving forward.

[25:01] I know a couple games that are getting this treatment.

[25:04] And it's not going to be S.L.E. treatment.

[25:07] Stern, L.E. is moving forward or going to start to get some of this metallic beautifulness.

[25:12] So that is good news.

[25:14] In terms of the game itself, you know, I'm running on code 0.84 and I have to say, I have

[25:21] to say, I freaking love this game.

[25:23] And I'm not just chilling for it.

[25:25] I think those who have it would agree.

[25:28] This game is awesome.

[25:29] And I want to explain why I love this game.

[25:31] And it's not just a theme integration.

[25:32] It's not just, you know, it's not just the colorful art by Christopher Franci.

[25:37] It's not the Batman theme song.

[25:39] I love this game because I know what I'm doing because this game is easy enough for me

[25:44] to tell Brenda, hey, here's what you need to do.

[25:47] When I had guest over last night and they're like, well, what do you do?

[25:50] And I'm like, look, you're Batman and Robin.

[25:53] And you're trying to put the villains in prison, just like the show.

[25:58] You got the catwoman, you got the Joker, you got the penguin, and you got the riddler.

[26:02] Now let me show you real quick where each of the shots are, right?

[26:05] And then you point out like the riddler are the two orbits.

[26:09] The catwoman are the two ramps.

[26:11] The penguin is the crane and the Joker is the magnet in the villain vision.

[26:14] You know, it's just so simple.

[26:17] And that's why I freaking love this game because the objective is so clear on what to

[26:24] do with it.

[26:25] And the shots themselves, right?

[26:28] The shots themselves.

[26:29] It's such a unique kind of layout kind of game.

[26:33] It's like kind of hard to describe.

[26:35] It doesn't, it doesn't like, it's like an open play field, but it's not like, it's

[26:40] fast, but it's not like the flowiest of flow games, but it can be.

[26:46] It's not stopping go, but it can be.

[26:49] It's sort of somewhere in the middle.

[26:51] It really is.

[26:53] I think my favorite shot in the game is the combos when you go back and forth with the

[26:59] catwoman ramps.

[27:01] I mean, it's just, it's such a good layout in design when you go boom, boom, you can go

[27:05] bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, back and forth between those two ramps.

[27:09] That is like so satisfying.

[27:13] The penguin crane is just freaking cool.

[27:15] Like when it swings out and the insert stays lit when you collect the umbrella, really,

[27:20] really awesome.

[27:21] My crane, like a lot of your cranes, like sometimes it rests over the insert.

[27:26] Sometimes it doesn't.

[27:27] It always sort of auto corrects.

[27:30] But you just learn to play with it because you're just like, I just need to shoot the

[27:32] wrecking ball.

[27:33] You're not shooting the insert per se.

[27:35] Just shoot the wrecking ball and it will light up.

[27:37] It will light up the insert that it's supposed to be over.

[27:40] I'm not sure if there's like an ultimate fix for that.

[27:43] Let's see.

[27:44] I'm looking at my game right now.

[27:46] I'll say this.

[27:47] I'll say this.

[27:48] I'm going to go more into gameplay in a second, but for those of you out there, and I've

[27:52] seen like Stern play fields dimple like crazy.

[27:54] I've seen clear coat chip on them.

[27:57] This machine needs a play field protector.

[28:01] I have it on my machine.

[28:03] I put it down.

[28:04] Now, do not put a play field protector.

[28:06] The one's from Germany.

[28:07] Do not put it down after you wax the game.

[28:11] You have to put it down without any wax or anything underneath it because that's what

[28:16] will create like that.

[28:17] Milkiness and the humidity will get under there and it'll start to fog up and you don't

[28:21] want that.

[28:22] So luckily, I didn't even know that.

[28:23] I just put mine down right when we opened it up.

[28:26] It looks like a sheet of glass.

[28:28] It looks like a sheet of glass and the game plays fast as can be like people are saying,

[28:33] oh, you play field protector, slow down the gameplay, bullshit.

[28:37] I'm here to tell you bullshit.

[28:38] And what I love about the play field protector, I've been playing this game since Friday when

[28:43] it arrived.

[28:45] You don't get any dimples like ever.

[28:48] There are no dimples.

[28:49] There's no dimples anywhere in the game and the game is fast as possible.

[28:52] So I'm like, why would you not do this?

[28:54] Like this game will always be brand new looking.

[28:58] And then here's an issue that I'm having with the game that I want to see if you guys email

[29:03] me at canadapimballadgmail.com.

[29:05] I think a lot of you guys are having this issue.

[29:08] The Joker magnet, the sort of magnet right in front of the turntable, it works amazingly

[29:15] well with the Joker mount.

[29:17] The Joker slings the ball around like a madman.

[29:19] I think the Joker slinging the ball is what I think hops up onto the catwoman plastic on

[29:26] the left.

[29:27] I actually have put, instead of that metal diverter stern gives you, I put the catwoman motorcycle

[29:33] that I got from Hot Wheels.

[29:35] So that magnet works great in Joker mode.

[29:40] When you are supposed to answer the bat phone, when you're starting a villain, that magnet

[29:45] is supposed to grab the ball and keep it there.

[29:48] The problem I'm having, and do you guys have this, the ball travels so quickly up there

[29:53] that almost like seven out of ten times even more, it just flies over it, hits the target

[30:00] and flies back down, the magnet doesn't grab it.

[30:02] I think they need to increase the magnet strength during the bat phone pickup, okay?

[30:08] Because it's cool to see it grab.

[30:11] It's a little frustrating that it doesn't always grab.

[30:14] So I think Stern needs to like, I don't know, up the juice on it when you're answering

[30:18] the bat phone.

[30:19] I'm looking at my game right now and I want to, I had an issue, I had an issue and I have

[30:24] two issues right now that I need to solve for.

[30:27] One is the ball goes into the vertical up kick in the upper right corner and sometimes

[30:34] it goes too far over that up kick and sits to the right of that little hole, that little

[30:41] scoop and I have to like nudge the machine.

[30:43] Now I'm wondering if I can adjust that piece of metal that's back there that's supposed

[30:47] to kick it out or maybe I can just put like a little like rubber bumper to stop the ball

[30:52] from going too far back there.

[30:54] But that's something, that's an issue that I'm having a problem with.

[30:57] I want to know if any of you guys are having that problem and what kind of adjustment I

[31:01] could do is my machine, maybe not 100% level, is that why that's happening?

[31:06] Maybe the play field protector is sending the ball in at a little bit higher height, that

[31:11] could be it as well.

[31:12] It looks like something easy to fix.

[31:14] The other issue I had with my game right away, I was noticing that the left orbit switch

[31:21] wasn't working.

[31:23] So I'd be in a mode and the lights would be flashing and I'd shoot the orbit and nothing.

[31:27] And sure enough, I took the game and I did the switch test and it wasn't registering.

[31:35] Switch was working, wasn't broken.

[31:38] And I'm like shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

[31:41] Now I got to like lift the play field and work on a switch.

[31:43] And so it's no big deal.

[31:45] I'll say this though, what sucks about all new Stern machines is that they still use

[31:52] solder for switches.

[31:54] Like really they can't just put simple connectors on everything that would make life a whole

[31:59] lot easier if you had to remove a switch.

[32:01] And here's why.

[32:03] Because if my switch was broken and I had a switch out the switch, you have to get out the

[32:09] soldering tool to do it.

[32:13] And I think that's the biggest mistake is that you shouldn't have to call a pinball

[32:16] tech to fix like a $2 part.

[32:21] And that's what sucks about these expensive machines is like a $2 part can make it no

[32:27] fun to play your game.

[32:29] And it's cost-cutting.

[32:31] I mean that's where Stern is just cheaper to have those women with the soldering irons

[32:35] on the line than it is to actually put better connectors on.

[32:40] It was annoying.

[32:41] I'll say this.

[32:42] I freaking, I freaking took like an hour to bend the switch all different ways.

[32:46] And sometimes I bend it in like it would stick down and finally I got it working and now

[32:51] it's working perfectly every time.

[32:53] So I'm happy with that.

[32:55] Every day where the glass doesn't come off is a good day on pinball, right?

[32:59] In terms of the game itself, there's complaints about the turntable moving too slow.

[33:04] Sometimes you get hang-ups on the back cave.

[33:07] So when the ball goes through it hangs up at the top of the back cave.

[33:09] I think I need to lower the back cave spinner just a little bit at the top.

[33:15] I'm not sure how to do that.

[33:17] I can live with nudging it versus sort of messing around with that.

[33:22] I don't really want to mess around the turntables what I'm saying.

[33:25] I've switched out the bat phone to the mod couple's bat phone.

[33:31] It's so much better.

[33:32] I've switched out the atomic pile.

[33:34] I've got the parachute.

[33:35] I put my parachute, the parachute pickup service.

[33:39] I put that on the left ramp on top of that plastic stern gives you to keep the ball from

[33:45] jumping out.

[33:46] It looks really cool there.

[33:47] I put the building sculpt on the upper left that came from mezzal mods.

[33:52] Game looks amazing.

[33:54] Game looks absolutely amazing.

[33:56] I couldn't be happier.

[33:58] I hope you hear it in my voice.

[33:59] I love the game.

[34:00] I love playing the game.

[34:02] I know coming from Magic Girl, it's kind of like, well, yeah, duh.

[34:05] Chris, you had a car with no steering wheel.

[34:08] Now you have one that has a steering wheel.

[34:10] You're going to enjoy it.

[34:13] Maybe that's the case.

[34:14] Maybe my frame of reference is skewed because I played Magic Girl for eight months.

[34:20] I have to say Batman 66 is a winner.

[34:25] This is coming from someone who had Lord of the Rings and Tails of the Rebea Knights.

[34:30] By the way, my toad in is still for sale.

[34:32] I've had a lot of interest in it.

[34:34] I'm not giving this thing away.

[34:35] The work that Eddie Kramer did to it is amazing.

[34:38] It's one of the nicest toad in you'll ever find.

[34:41] Anyone who wants a toad in with all brass plating from Mike Chestnut, with all new restore

[34:47] work on all the mechs and all the boards, with the laser-rific topper, with gold mirror

[34:52] blades, with color DMD, with brass plated coin.

[34:55] I mean, the things got everything in the kitchen sink in it.

[34:58] Beautiful, all new plastics, new genie, new lamp, everything.

[35:02] Everything you can think of is in that game.

[35:05] Just send me an email at kneeda.

[35:07] Kneeda.

[35:08] Kneeda.

[35:09] Kneeda.

[35:10] Pinball at gmail.com.

[35:11] Sorry, guys.

[35:13] I love Batman.

[35:14] I think this is going to go down as one of Stern's best pinball machines ever.

[35:19] I've done a complete 180 on the game.

[35:22] It just has that one more game sort of feel to it.

[35:26] I've yet to capture all the villains.

[35:29] I love that you can sort of stack the major villains with the minor villains and switch

[35:34] the TV screens.

[35:36] I'm still not sure at all what the TV seasons do, like season one, two, and three.

[35:42] I'm not sure how that's implemented.

[35:45] I love the gadget targets that just, you know, when you spell gadget, you hit the gadget

[35:49] selector and something special happens.

[35:52] It's just a fun game.

[35:54] It's just fun pinball.

[35:55] It's colorful.

[35:56] It's the perfect theme.

[35:58] I think Stern still has some things to work on.

[36:01] And here's what they need to work on.

[36:02] So the audio in the code is all over the place with volume.

[36:07] Like sometimes you can hear Batman and Rob and sometimes you can't.

[36:11] There's like scenes where Batman and Rob and are talking to Commissioner Gordon and you

[36:14] don't hear anything.

[36:16] I hear there is a ton more going into this game.

[36:20] A ton more callouts.

[36:21] A ton more features.

[36:23] I think when this game is done, I think when it's done, it's going to be when it's

[36:28] Stern's best.

[36:29] I think everyone who has one is going to be happy.

[36:32] I do think there's going to be a run on Ellie's and SL's.

[36:35] They're just will be.

[36:36] People are not going to want to let them go.

[36:38] It's going to go down as one of those really special, special machines.

[36:43] And that's it.

[36:44] You're not going to hear me do this like every podcast.

[36:46] I'm going to go back to being objective canada who looks at this hobby.

[36:51] And this is just my machine though.

[36:53] You know that I now have a playing machine and I'm having fun with pinball again.

[36:58] That's really why I'm excited.

[37:00] That's all I've really wanted for a long time was to figure out a solution.

[37:05] I thought Magic Girl would have been worked on.

[37:07] I thought people would have tried to fix that game.

[37:11] But I just think the lack of code and the lack of mechanical design on that game means it

[37:20] may never work.

[37:21] And who cares?

[37:22] I don't even care anymore.

[37:23] The new owner is going to be happy.

[37:25] It's out of my hair.

[37:26] I don't really care.

[37:28] I've got a machine that I love.

[37:29] I love turning it on.

[37:32] It is funny how long the delay is to turn on the spike pinball machine.

[37:37] You know when I used the Alfred bank that I made where you lift up the head to turn on

[37:41] the pinball machine, Magic Girl went on instantly.

[37:44] This thing like there's like a 10 second delay.

[37:48] Then there's like this flickers.

[37:51] It doesn't just come on.

[37:53] It's weird.

[37:54] It's weird.

[37:55] It's like it's got to boot up in a strange way.

[37:58] All right.

[37:59] I don't know if anything else is going on in the hobby that I want to talk about.

[38:02] It's going to be probably like a shorter little episode.

[38:04] I didn't notice though.

[38:05] I went on the thing I was very observant on pinside.

[38:10] There were a lot of X-Men coming up for sale recently.

[38:14] I'm wondering if that means like an X-Men vault is coming.

[38:18] I'm not sure.

[38:20] I'm not sure.

[38:21] What else?

[38:23] You know what it is?

[38:23] I wish I could tell you some other stuff.

[38:25] I know other stuff going on in the hobby.

[38:27] And it's like, it's awesome.

[38:30] I feel like Nate shivers now where people tell me stuff and they know I can't say anything.

[38:37] And I know what's coming.

[38:38] And I've seen stuff.

[38:40] And I'll tell you from what I've seen stuff is beautiful stuff is colorful stuff is exciting stuff is

[38:48] stuff is stuff is great.

[38:51] It is a great time to be in this hobby.

[38:54] And I and I really mean that.

[38:56] I really mean that there's it's fun seeing Houdini out on location getting played.

[39:01] People are going to get that game soon.

[39:03] The competition in Pimbal that was going to be fierce.

[39:06] It is going to be brutal in 2018 when you look at what's coming in the pipeline.

[39:13] And that's why I think all these companies, you know, when you lift up a Pimbal machine and

[39:16] you see everything in it, all these companies I thought it would be easy to do what Stern does.

[39:21] Man, it's not.

[39:23] If you ever go to Jersey Jack Pimbal and you see how they make their machines, it's not easy.

[39:28] I think the players are going to thin out, but I think the product is going to keep getting

[39:33] better and better.

[39:35] And I'm excited.

[39:36] I just, oh, I wish I could tell you.

[39:37] I wish I could tell you what else is going on.

[39:40] So I got an email from Jeff who does this week in Pimbal.

[39:43] He's like, Chris, can you share with me the images of the Stern coffee table book you

[39:47] have?

[39:48] And I was like, dude, I don't have it.

[39:50] I was joking.

[39:51] The whole, that's the running joke is that this coffee table book has taken longer to make

[39:54] than an actual Pimbal machine.

[39:57] So that is not something I have.

[40:00] Let's go to our mail because I kept saying like, I'm going to read the mail from now on.

[40:05] So if you want your genius or to tell me I'm a loser, if you want me to read it, just

[40:13] let me know.

[40:14] And I will read it out loud.

[40:15] I got an email from Sean Mauser sending me a link of where I can buy a hoodie.

[40:22] Because if you remember, I said, I will buy Hilton a hoodie.

[40:27] If he, if someone posts on Pinside a thread that says who didn't get Batman SLE and I would

[40:35] get Hilton a $100 new hoodie that he could wear at Texas Pimbal Festival.

[40:40] So he doesn't have to wear the same hoodie every day.

[40:43] And I want to say Sean, thank you.

[40:46] I've already started putting together Hilton's hoodie.

[40:49] I think Hilton's hoodie has a nice sort of ring to it.

[40:54] He probably could make more money selling Hilton's hoodie than putting full throttle on location.

[40:58] But that's just me, that's just me, the marketer.

[41:00] I got an email from Brett Lewis.

[41:05] He said Chris Batman 66 will be arriving next week.

[41:08] But you probably knew that.

[41:10] Thanks again for the context.

[41:11] So I think, I think Brett bought, he bought Coin Takeer's machine.

[41:15] And that's awesome.

[41:16] Brett, congratulations.

[41:17] You're going to freaking love it.

[41:19] It's going to be glued to your, em bolted to the ground as they say.

[41:22] I got an email from Craig Johnson.

[41:24] Craig, thank you so much for listening to the show.

[41:26] Craig said, hey, canada, keep up the good work on the podcast.

[41:30] Besides Star Trek Batman 66 is really the only star I've ever considered buying over

[41:36] the last six months.

[41:38] Probably will still be a little out of my price range on location where there are 20 pins

[41:43] is the only pin.

[41:45] It is the only pin I kept coming back to and playing over and over.

[41:49] It's really fun to shoot.

[41:51] Theme is the most important thing for me.

[41:53] In a pinball machine, a machine can have the best layout in pinball.

[41:57] But if it's a Brady Bunch pin, then I'm out.

[42:00] I owned a Wizard of Oz for six months and I thought it was beautiful, fun to shoot,

[42:05] and built like a tank.

[42:06] I ended up selling it because the theme sucked.

[42:09] Well, I mean, Craig, it's a little harsh.

[42:12] I mean, you bought it.

[42:13] If theme was important to you, then why did you buy a Wizard of Oz?

[42:17] He then writes Batman 66 has it all.

[42:20] Great theme, fun to shoot, and great code now.

[42:22] It does have Stern's questionable build quality, but my four-year-old Metallica still looks

[42:27] perfect.

[42:28] It's a good point, Craig.

[42:31] I mean, who does know?

[42:32] When I look inside my Super-L-E, it does have sort of like a wood bracket inside where

[42:38] the joints go in.

[42:40] I don't know if you can put additional cabinet support in there, but everything's fine.

[42:45] I got no cracking.

[42:46] I've got no issues.

[42:48] This isn't going to be a game.

[42:49] I'm going to let like crazy levy come over here and start like rustling it around the

[42:52] room.

[42:53] I've seen the way those tournament players play games.

[42:56] They're so slapping this thing too hard.

[42:58] All right, what else did I get?

[43:00] I think that I read.

[43:02] Do do do do do.

[43:04] John Robinson.

[43:05] John, thank you for listening to the show.

[43:06] John found a Batman elite locally for 11,500, and he also was thinking of a premium from

[43:16] J.J. for 7,600.

[43:17] He said, this hobby is crazy.

[43:19] I can rationalize just about anything.

[43:23] John, you're right.

[43:24] Bobby is nuts.

[43:26] It is absolutely nuts.

[43:28] These things are expensive.

[43:32] They are ridiculous to other people when they see how much we spend on it, but I want

[43:37] to put stuffing context for you guys.

[43:39] And don't hate me here.

[43:41] Don't hate me here because I think a lot of times people look at pinball in a vacuum and

[43:46] don't understand like what other things cost.

[43:49] And just to put this in perspective, a pinball machine has hundreds.

[43:54] If not a few thousand parts.

[43:56] It requires years of design, of software to be worked on to make it work.

[44:01] The amount of lights and switches.

[44:03] You know, my friend who came over yesterday, he's like, this is just, it's unbelievable.

[44:07] How this thing like operates.

[44:10] You know, a metal ball is rolling over all these switches that immediately trigger something

[44:14] that happens on the screen like the score popping up when the pop bumpers are going.

[44:18] Every time you hit a switch, you hear a sound like unbelievable.

[44:22] You might not work the goes into it.

[44:24] And then I go into Gucci in New York City.

[44:27] Now I know some people out there are disgusted by fashion, but just remember, if you walk into

[44:33] Gucci on Fifth Avenue, it's packed.

[44:36] People are buying stuff left and right.

[44:38] They are having their best year ever.

[44:41] If you go into Gucci and you want a blazer that just has something embroidered on the back,

[44:47] you are looking at anywhere from four to five thousand dollars just for a blazer, just

[44:53] for a blazer.

[44:55] And there's never any sales.

[44:57] You can't get it at a discount ever.

[44:59] When stuff doesn't sell at Gucci, it is either destroyed or it is sent back to Italy, but

[45:04] they don't allow people to buy it second hand.

[45:08] Now imagine three Gucci blazers lined up and then a Batman SLE.

[45:15] And you tell me where the value lies.

[45:19] But again, it's all subjective.

[45:21] It's every all these things.

[45:23] A Gucci blazer is just as, it's a non-essential the same way a pinball machine is a non-essential.

[45:32] And so to each the own, I say, to each the own, don't criticize people for loving what

[45:38] they love.

[45:39] Don't hate people because they might be into one thing and you're not.

[45:43] That's all trying to enjoy the things and support people who are passionate about stuff

[45:46] because that's what I realized.

[45:47] The ultimate crime in the world.

[45:49] It's not spending a lot of money on pinball.

[45:52] It's living a life that doesn't have any passion in it.

[45:55] It's living a life where you're not surrounded by the things you enjoy.

[45:58] And I love pinball.

[45:59] I love the people I talk to on social media about pinball.

[46:02] I love doing this podcast and I love that I finally have a machine that works.

[46:06] I love that this hobby is so great and has so many wonderful people in it that there's

[46:10] even a new home for magic girl.

[46:11] I love that there are big collectors out there who want a magic girl.

[46:15] I love that.

[46:16] There's all these companies out there that wake up every day and won't be satisfied into

[46:21] a new pinball machine is in the world.

[46:23] And they're all trying to outdo each other.

[46:25] I mean, it's great.

[46:26] It's a great time to be alive.

[46:28] And we're not going to be alive forever.

[46:30] And life is really, really short.

[46:31] And I think a lot of you know that in different ways.

[46:34] And I think we all should enjoy this holiday, play a lot of pinball, meet up with friends,

[46:40] and just have a good time.

[46:41] All right, I'm going to go play some more Batman.

[46:43] I'm going to get this podcast up.

[46:45] And we'll probably talk to you again real soon because I'll have a whole new bunch of

[46:49] news from this week in pinball when I read it tomorrow morning.

[46:52] Have a good day everybody.
