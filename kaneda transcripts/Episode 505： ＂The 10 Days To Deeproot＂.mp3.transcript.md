[00:00] And it's been 10 days without you in my reach

[00:06] And the only time I've touched you is in my sleep

[00:16] After five years of saying they were gonna shake up the pinball world

[00:20] After many, many promises of shipping more games than anyone in a history of pinball

[00:25] At least we're gonna get one game out the door on September 21st

[00:30] 2020 Deeproot Pinball has concluded their teaser image campaign and given us the date

[00:37] Now I told you you would see Deeproot, Raza before my birthday, which is September 25th by the way

[00:43] So this is exciting, so we only have 10 days to go

[00:46] 10 days in which this company who's made a lot of promises

[00:50] Who's been around for around five years, hasn't shipped a single game

[00:55] I think this is a moment in which a lot of us are excited, a lot of us are curious

[01:00] A lot of us aren't anxious, a lot of us are maybe worried

[01:05] I mean, what would you be worried about? I mean, unless you lost money on the original retro Atom Exambi Venture Land with Zidware

[01:12] I think this is a moment in which everyone is really curious

[01:16] So here's what I want to talk about on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast

[01:20] I want to talk about going into this Raza reveal what's going on in their heads

[01:25] And my predictions on how the Raza launch will unfold

[01:31] Because there's a lot of questions, how much is it, how many they're gonna make, how they're gonna distribute this thing

[01:36] A lot more questions than answers, okay

[01:39] I also saw that someone posted some of the patent information that Deeproot has filed for

[01:45] So a little bit more information on what the platform is gonna be that we'll talk about

[01:49] And then I want to talk about Avengers Infinity Quest, how one stream has sort of changed the tide and the vibe of the owners thread

[01:59] Which is now the hype thread, I love the way the stern apologists have to always make sure we're hyping everything stern does

[02:07] We're not allowed to have a difference of opinion on stern's product ever, according to the stern army

[02:13] And then I want to talk about Jersey Jack pinball and again you can't avoid discussing where is Jersey Jack pinball in all of this

[02:23] As all of these companies are starting to showcase their products and fight for our money

[02:28] Again, Jersey Jack pinball continues to put up Facebook posts trying to sell us Willy Wonka

[02:34] A game that's 18 months old that nobody wants or nobody nobody doesn't know they can get a Willy Wonka

[02:42] We've known for a very long time and the demand for Willy Wonka is dried up

[02:48] So where are they in all this and I'm gonna talk about how I think they really are making a marketing mistake

[02:54] Because I and I'm gonna I'll get to that later, okay

[02:57] I'll get to that later, but let's start with Deeproot

[02:59] So 10 days to Raza, what do we know so far about this game? Well, we know the date they're gonna reveal it

[03:05] And I was talking to Robert and I think I might get a little bit of an early peak at what's going on behind the scenes at Deeproot

[03:14] Now I will say this, I asked Robert a few days ago if he would give me something to chew on

[03:20] So I could get you the listeners excited about Raza and talk about this game and get you hyped

[03:28] Right because I'm watching a lot of you throw money at Avengers

[03:31] I'm watching a lot of you wait for guns and roses and I was like look you know

[03:34] I've got a captive audience whose who's literally I mean this is how he's gonna sell this game that this company is unknown

[03:41] It's going to be Pimball and enthusiasts who make or break the sales at Deeproot Pimball and you know me

[03:47] I mean I'm the spokesperson I think for for collectors for people who really want to go and

[03:53] Buy a machine that's worth collecting new inbox buyers. I think a lot of the new inbox community out there probably listens to this show because it's what I talk about like I don't go into deep rules set discussions

[04:05] I don't tell you how to win in tournaments

[04:07] We talk about the new stuff and if it's worth putting in your home or on location for you if you're an operator

[04:13] Right well not so much operators, but you know what I'm talking about all right

[04:16] So I asked for just anything as I give me something I didn't get anything

[04:21] So I think he's gonna wait and sort of give the Pimball media a sneak peek or behind the scenes look at this thing all at once and

[04:30] I'm pretty sure I'm going to be invited to that and I look forward to that

[04:35] I would have loved to have seen something and give you something a little bit more

[04:39] But what I did find and someone put this on the deeproot thread last night was what they've filed for with their

[04:47] Patatin cabinet am I saying that right they're patented cabinet and so if you look on that link click on it download the PDF and you and this has been out for a while they filed this patent in

[04:58] 2018 but it's here's what they're going for I'm gonna summarize it so their cabinet is gonna be unlike any Pimball cabinet we've seen before in the sense that

[05:08] You're gonna be able to lift up the glass and get access to the play field in a much less cumbersome way

[05:15] I mean how many of his out there when a ball gets stuck or you need to change a little light bulb how annoying is it to have to you know take off the lock down bar find a place to put the lock down bar without

[05:25] Scratching it find a place to put the glass lean it against the wall you know you get your fingerprints all over it all the time because of that and then you finally get

[05:33] Access to the play field and then God forbid you have to lift the play field on some of these modern

[05:37] Sturns and you pull the play field and the whole play field flies off the rails and it falls into the cabinet I mean I dropped my

[05:43] Play field into the cabinet that the way some of these play fields are

[05:48] Inserted into the cabinet is so cheap and so poorly thought of

[05:53] Consider all things considered like if you want to service these things or actually move the play field around

[05:58] It's really not well thought out so they are gonna have a system in which it's it's like a four linkage system in which the play field can actually come out

[06:06] It can rotate on a rotisserie it can turn horizontal you can even bend it down towards the ground

[06:13] I mean the images are all there so they are they are looking at pinball cabinets and

[06:18] servicing a game and thinking of all the ways they could make it better so it's really interesting and I look at stuff like this and I don't look at stuff like this and I don't sort of say oh they're

[06:28] Sobing a problem that doesn't exist. I like the fact that deep root pinball has sort of gone around and thought about all the different things they could

[06:36] Improve because who out there doesn't look at pinball in 2020 and say look not a lot of innovation is happening

[06:43] in this in this hobby and in this product in 30 years now some people might say it doesn't need it right we watch stern pinball

[06:51] Sell thousands of games a year in a system and a platform

[06:56] Which is basically 30 40 years old if not older and for a lot of you out there

[07:00] You know your games have been trouble free and that was the other thing that was going through my head as I was looking at the images of what they've

[07:07] Designed as I was saying well this is great. This is great. This is great

[07:11] Man, but if you make a game that doesn't really break or doesn't really have many issues

[07:15] You're not really going to need to experience most of this so is this over-engineering the pinball cabinet and do we need all this the other thing

[07:24] They engineered and they say in their filing is the hinges that hold up the back box that we all know about

[07:30] They don't like those they say those interrupt the art package on the game

[07:35] So the the back box will rest on hinges that it go through the middle of the back box

[07:40] So you will not see any

[07:42] Interruption on the side view of the game between the back box art and the cabinet art

[07:47] So that's going to be interesting to look at the way it folds down is different

[07:51] So they've sort of gone through it all there's a couple other innovations that I know about one of them

[07:57] I'm not going to say right now just because they got mad at me when I had a little image of it

[08:02] You're gonna see it in 10 days so that's that's I'm kind of just relieved that we all just get to see it in 10 days

[08:08] And we can actually discuss what they are showing us so I don't have to feel like if I talk about something

[08:14] Early at deep route that they're not happy about that they're gonna come after me now look

[08:19] I am there are certain companies that I am afraid of a little bit litigious

[08:24] Companies that I think would come after me if I spoiled something of theirs and there are other companies that I know

[08:32] Don't care because they're just doing so well

[08:34] They're selling so many games and so what if you've got canada off in the corner rambling about

[08:39] Speculations and like that's like stern pimp ball like I don't worry about stern pimp ball

[08:43] But there's other companies out there that I worry about just because I think if things don't go well

[08:49] They're gonna look for someone to blame

[08:51] I mean Andrew highway used to say this all the time that he was gonna sue me

[08:54] And it's like he blamed me for the failure of his own company and I just never understood that I'm just a

[09:00] Podcast or like you're the one you started the company

[09:03] You're the one you made all these decisions these financial decisions these manufacturing decisions. It's not me

[09:09] All right, so the cabinet's gonna be different. It's retro atomic zombie adventure land

[09:13] Now the one thing we haven't seen which is probably the most important thing to give people confidence in

[09:20] Ordering this game and I really think they're gonna have to show this and have to show this not just with

[09:26] Images but with videos and with a tour

[09:30] They're gonna have to show us the manufacturing capabilities of deep-rooted pinball because we all know

[09:36] If you don't show that you have the manufacturing ability people are not gonna pre-order the game

[09:42] So the real question I have have they built games now if you're Robert and you're revealing this game to the world

[09:48] And you've been studying the pinball market place for I mean he's been studying it for way more than than when

[09:55] Deep-rood started which was five years ago maybe a little bit more he knows all too well

[10:00] What all of you know that you can't make people wait a long time between revealing your product and having it on the line

[10:09] And we're gonna talk about how I think that's kind of tripping up Jersey Jack pinball right now

[10:13] But especially for a brand new company that hasn't proven themselves yet

[10:19] This is like the most important thing on day one September 21st

[10:24] Are people are going to feel confident that this game is

[10:30] Manufacturable and they have figured out how to manufacture and get it into buyers homes in a timely fashion

[10:37] I mean people are sick of sweating for Rick and Morty and spooky pinball has it figured out down to like 10 games a week and

[10:44] And people even then are like this is not quick enough. I want my game

[10:48] So what will deep root show us now if I were Robert and I've been studying this industry for a long time and I'm a boutique and I you know

[10:56] I've been beating my chest about how much different we are and how much better we are

[11:01] Here's what I would have done and I just don't know if they've done this I would have made 50 already in boxes

[11:08] Ready to go out that week for the first 50 people who ordered it like why not you know you're gonna sell at least

[11:16] 50 I mean even October fest sold 50 right?

[11:19] I mean and we know it's a John pop a new game

[11:21] We know this game would sell at least a couple hundred

[11:24] You know also why not make the first run of them and have them ready to go and

[11:30] I think that would send a great signal that not only do you have manufacturing down you've made them already

[11:36] They're in box and and I've always said this I think the most baller move the most baller move

[11:42] Would be to reveal a game by just shipping it to some customer first and letting them open it up and

[11:50] Capturing their excitement and then you hit with all of your assets and all of your videos

[11:54] But man imagine that if someone's like oh man I ordered this game and I picked it up the same day and it was already built

[12:02] I mean Stern tried that with stranger things, you know to look warm success

[12:07] But that game just I don't even want to go down that road anymore

[12:10] So we don't know we don't know what manufacturing looks like at deep roots

[12:13] We're gonna find out now the other big question and this debate rages on and I keep seeing people

[12:18] Think that I'm making a mistake by saying they need to make this game limited and they need to make this game of a higher

[12:26] Price point to make it feel somewhat collectible and special

[12:29] Okay, now we learned something else today. I'm gonna get back to price and and volume of units on

[12:34] Their on their website if you go to deeproot pimple.com

[12:39] You know not only do you see Ned punching through the brick wall

[12:42] You see at the bottom of that page a very interesting link to click if you want to be a distributor for deep root

[12:50] Pimble so click here if you're interested in distributing the product and you know as of last week when I talked to Robert

[12:57] I'm not sure they knew whether or not they were doing sales internally or through distributors now

[13:03] I will say this five years in the making three years making raza

[13:08] You haven't figured out your distributor system and it's only 10 days to reveal

[13:15] That makes me a little bit nervous

[13:18] That is a little bit of a red flag that they haven't really figured out

[13:23] Exactly how they're doing all of this and I've seen this before you know

[13:27] It's always ironic in a way where sometimes projects that take a really long time to complete

[13:35] Actually feel rushed at the end right yet all this time and then it feels rushed at the end

[13:41] And you're like how can that be like they had all this time to figure it out to ink deals with distributors and also like

[13:48] They're asking for country codes. So now now we're sending products around the world a company that hasn't made a single game

[13:55] hasn't shipped a game at all is now an international Pimble

[14:00] Manufacturing company or distribution company and and look I get it

[14:04] I get it but part of me feels a little anxious that this is sort of being you know

[14:10] The ships being built in the water a little bit with this launch of raza and because of that

[14:14] I also feel that I don't think this day

[14:17] I don't think if you are a distributor and you hit them up today

[14:20] I don't think they're gonna tell you how many and how much yet and I don't know if they're gonna figure that out until the

[14:28] 11th hour of this reveal and I want to just once again go on the record and I'm just giving Robert

[14:34] Advice here for free and I know that this might upset some of you out there

[14:39] But I think the only way you make this game special and you launch deep-rooted Pimble in a way that like

[14:46] Get you to game two get you to game three like I just don't think you can launch this game and say we're gonna make an

[14:53] Unlimited amount of

[14:55] Raza's if you do that this game is dead on arrival

[14:58] We've watched other companies do this whenever you don't put a limit on a on a game that's

[15:05] Unlicensed on a game that's been in the makings for seven years and let's be honest

[15:10] Let's be honest this game didn't like blow our socks off at Houston

[15:15] Like if what we saw at Houston blew everyone away and people have been waiting a year to get their hands on it

[15:21] But that's not the case like it's clearly a unique game

[15:26] It's clearly a unique package. They're clearly doing unique things with their platform

[15:31] And I've said it like I think this game is for someone who just wants something different if I were to use a car

[15:38] analogy

[15:39] This is the Acura NSX of the car world, okay?

[15:44] In Acura NSX might not outperform its competitors

[15:49] But it's for the person who wants to be different and it's a hundred and eighty thousand dollars the NSX

[15:55] It's a high price point and what when you see one

[15:59] It's a moment because you don't always see them and I think for Raza to work

[16:04] He needs to try to create that kind of aura around the product and again

[16:10] My recommendation to Robert is that I would make no more than 500

[16:15] I would make less than 500 Raza's and I would charge at least ten thousand dollars for them

[16:21] I mean are people forgetting that a sternalee now with a topper is a ten thousand dollar proposition

[16:28] And if you did all this innovation and you changed all these things and you have David deal on sound and you have John

[16:34] Papaduke designing this game and you have all these mechanisms in this game

[16:38] Look I get it it might not shoot as well as Avengers and it doesn't I mean we've seen this game shoot

[16:44] It doesn't shoot tremendously well. It's like so then what am I working with this is what marketing is all about?

[16:50] What are we working with here?

[16:52] What's the climate in which we're releasing this game if I'm a marketer?

[16:56] I'm sitting in the room saying okay, it's it's got this it's got this we're launching it in September

[17:01] They just launched Avengers. How are we gonna break through?

[17:04] How are we gonna differentiate this and create demand see people forget that you need to create the demand if you'd go

[17:12] Unlimited there's no demand because I'll just wait

[17:15] I'll just wait, but if you make it a limited number there's immediate demand you guys know all this you won't you know all this

[17:22] So if I could recommend anything to Robert maybe find a middle ground

[17:25] We're gonna make 350 razas and they're $10,000 and what is that?

[17:31] $3.5 million and then we're on to the next and you got a ship games within the first few weeks of the reveal

[17:37] Hopefully they have some games built already

[17:39] Hopefully we see like a row of ten of them when they take the tour of deep route and that's what I would recommend and

[17:46] I don't know these are just my predictions

[17:49] But if he does something Lucy Goosey trust me trust me it's not gonna work out

[17:54] It's just not gonna work out. It just doesn't have that kind of

[17:58] Excitement moving into this reveal and I kind of feel like they're backing into this reveal a little bit more than

[18:04] Then hyping it the right way. I mean really just that image with those fonts and that's real

[18:11] I thought they're all of this that they're all these animators that they're all these creative people

[18:15] John Papaduke this this is how you drop it now

[18:19] Maybe they're just going for like and I think Robert does this and I again

[18:23] I think this is his strategy

[18:25] He sometimes likes to sandbag these things so that when you finally see it like he's trying to lower your

[18:32] Expectations so that when you finally do see it you're blown away and I think that's what they're going for and if that's the case

[18:38] They've succeeded because this teaser campaign has not has not got anyone

[18:43] It's truly excited at all like there's nothing to even chew on all right

[18:47] So we only got 10 days to go and I can't wait to see it and hopefully what I said right now doesn't

[18:53] Doesn't make him remove my invite from the process, you know number one pinball podcast Robert

[18:59] That's got to count for something right all right everyone

[19:01] We can't wait to see Raza in 10 days or hopefully sooner if he gives me something all right

[19:07] So let's talk about Avengers real quick because you saw my last podcast

[19:11] Hopefully and you saw my feelings about the stream and and you know

[19:14] There was a really great really great run through about the stream too

[19:18] And I've started listening to this new podcast and it's Travis's podcast

[19:22] It's called a pinball podcast and he does a great like 35-minute

[19:28] Analysis of this stream and how unprofessional it was and how sloppy it was and how

[19:35] If the goal of this stream was to get people excited about Avengers

[19:39] It really didn't succeed and it's a really it's a good show

[19:42] I think you should listen to it, you know and my feelings coming out of the stream

[19:46] It's always been this way with Stern, you know because they they do operate in a way that at times does feel

[19:53] Really sloppy because they don't need to polish these things because you've already run and

[20:00] Throne your money at them before they've even shown you the gameplay like they know

[20:06] When they hit go live on that twitch stream that all 500 games have been sold through and sold to customers

[20:14] Because they have that information

[20:16] So what do they care to improve this stuff?

[20:20] And I think when I read the thread a lot of you are starting to feel a little bit of the fatigue and the anxiety

[20:28] That you you're waking up you're starting to take the red pill and I took the red pill

[20:34] Years ago with Stern pinball, but there are so many people who run that every single new Stern creation

[20:42] Before knowing they really like it they go all in on it and then they like have a moment of clarity

[20:48] In which they realize maybe this isn't the pin for me

[20:52] Maybe I don't want this confusing rule set, you know

[20:55] Maybe the comic book of Avengers isn't that theme I want to put in my home

[20:59] Maybe maybe my family doesn't like this theme whatever it is

[21:03] It's like they do a really good job of like the fear of missing out and they drive all of you to buy and then you wake up and you realize that

[21:11] Your Ellie Stern collection. I'm telling you so many people are gonna wake up and realize that they're Ellie Stern collection

[21:17] Just isn't that limited and then every single game becomes available and that there's a short window because of

[21:24] How quickly these Stern machines keep coming out?

[21:27] There's a short window in which you even have bragging rights amongst your pinball buddies that you've got the latest in the greatest and that's my

[21:34] That's my feeling to as I saw this and I think people are feeling this I think people are feeling a little bit of a fatigue

[21:41] Of if you keep going back to the same creative well even if it's L win and Yeti

[21:48] More so with Yeti it's like you just can't keep using his incredible talents quickly over and over again

[21:56] You know it reminds me when Disney got the rights to Star Wars and then they just started making so much

[22:01] Star Wars stuff over and over and over again in a new movie every year and all of a sudden it didn't feel special

[22:08] And I think what's happening over at Stern is we've got an artist who's incredible

[22:13] But he's got a certain style and if you see it every three months or four months

[22:18] There's gonna reach a point where this stuff stops feeling like a moment like once a year

[22:25] We're gonna get an L win pin one you know once a year we're gonna get a zombie Yeti and also it's just variety

[22:30] Like on some level

[22:32] I think Stern pinball starting to feel like an organization in which there's not that much variety

[22:39] It always feels like it's these package teams

[22:43] Making these games over and over and over again

[22:46] And I'm just wondering if that's starting to create a little bit of

[22:50] Same old Stern and it doesn't mean again

[22:53] It doesn't mean that what they're delivering with some of these teams is not great because we know that L wins design is great

[22:59] We know that zombie Yeti's art is great

[23:01] But you know what I'm saying? It just starts to all look the same and I'm using another cargument like it's why I'm so bored of like

[23:07] Ferrari even these days the car is just all start to look the same like a 9-11 Porsche

[23:12] It just starts to look the same every single evolution of it to the point where if you want to be different

[23:19] If you want something different you buy an NSX

[23:21] So that's what I think for some of you out there

[23:24] Maybe you're feeling that I've already got enough Sterns and do I need another one and I especially think

[23:30] People who went in on Ninja Turtles feel this way. I'm gonna get another

[23:34] It's is it just a little bit more of the same at what point you say like man

[23:39] Three Stern alleys three Stern alleys is

[23:43] $30,000 with toppers and tax and that starts to sound ludicrous doesn't it on some level

[23:51] $30,000 and if you feel like they're all kind of the same and

[23:55] Why not mix it up and I think that's what also has me excited with deep root is they're gonna mix it up

[24:01] And they're gonna give you another option and it's good to have options

[24:04] But they got to execute because Stern as much as they might all be the same on some level

[24:09] They execute so tremendously well and that's why people have confidence in them and I totally get it

[24:16] I they're not inconsistent right we've all dated people were like you might have a good date

[24:22] With a with a girl a few times in the third date like she's psycho, right?

[24:27] It did you're like I'm now that's it like I'm out right and that's kind of what like Jersey Jack's been like for me

[24:33] It's like you know, they finally have a few good and then they go psycho and like they they they ghost you for like 18 months

[24:39] And you're like I gotta find a new girlfriend. I'll just I'll go back to the steady one that's Stern pimples the steady girlfriend

[24:45] But you just always can rely on you're never gonna wake up one day

[24:48] And she's gonna go like bipolar nuts on you like the other manufacturers apparently all right

[24:53] I didn't want to say this but you know me I'm canada and I love to drop things into the well that apparently is

[25:00] controversial but I heard from a little birdie

[25:04] Internally over at Stern pimple this game

[25:07] Had a little bit you know there's a story behind the creation of this game that not everybody knows and that it's gonna be the next pin

[25:15] By this team where there are no restrictions so take that as you will

[25:21] I don't know what the title is but when I say it's the next game by this team

[25:27] That I'm hearing is the one you're really gonna want and by this team you know who I mean Elwin and yet

[25:34] I mean that's all I'm gonna say that's this game feels like it was a little rush doesn't it like it feels like it

[25:39] It was done it came out quickly, but it just feels like they were making way for something else and to keep the line going

[25:47] Because Stern always sticks to their schedule, but that's what I heard and this this came from someone like deep in the belly of the beast there

[25:56] So like I'm not making this up if they ever take me to court

[26:00] I'll show them the text messages, all right

[26:02] I've got my sources, but that's what I'm hearing and now oh now all of a sudden wait white canada

[26:07] What are you saying like we shouldn't run towards Avengers comic book edition?

[26:12] There might be a better game more dream theme right around the corner?

[26:17] That's exactly what I'm telling you and you see you listen to this free pinball podcast and let me tell you what this free

[26:23] Pinball podcast does for many of you out there it frees you it liberates you from your need to buy this game

[26:31] Just because it's the new game that they're trying to get you all hyped about and you know

[26:35] It is embarrassing to see that pin-side thread go from owners thread to the hype thread

[26:40] It's now the hype thread everyone has to come in here doing backflips and start cheerleading it

[26:45] They look the game is cool. I won't I won't dismiss this game

[26:49] I mean it's an L win game you can never dismiss an L one game. It's a zombie Yeti package. It looks great the code

[26:55] Yeah, it looks complex. It looks a little confusing

[26:58] But it's a confusing thing to do you got to collect nine people and collect all these trophies and beat Thanos and it if that's for you

[27:05] Great you'll enjoy that kind of complexity

[27:07] I don't think it's for everybody, but I'm just saying I've always said this just wait

[27:12] Just wait none of these games are ever hard to get then you can save yourself a few thousand dollars maybe

[27:18] If you just wait a few months and like I like waiting I mean

[27:22] I just I actually like not owning any pinball machines

[27:25] I love it to just go and play other people's machines. I love going to play on location

[27:31] This notion that you have to own all these things whenever they're revealed is silly and

[27:37] We all know there's only one game you really are gonna want to buy and this is this is I don't chill very often

[27:43] But it's guns and f and roses now. Let's talk about Jersey Jack pinball

[27:47] Now I know it feels like the marketing department over at Jersey Jack pinball is basically a sleep like they're just a sleep at the wheel

[27:54] They they really haven't done anything they haven't followed up their ninja turtles teaser video in which you ask for

[28:01] Innovation and every day that goes by starts to feel more and more like they're dropping the ball now

[28:08] Here's the mistake I think they're making and and this again is free advice to Ken Cromwell and the team over there

[28:14] The mistake they're making is I believe Jersey Jack pinball is trying to stay true to its word

[28:21] When they said we're not gonna reveal the next game until it's on the line. Okay now the problem with this company is

[28:27] I think they're marketing the release of guns and roses to stay true to that statement

[28:33] But the problem is again as a marketer is they're not looking at the landscape and the marketplace

[28:41] That's happening around them. They're basically operating in a vacuum in which they are trying to look credible by their own

[28:48] Statements and the thing that they need to realize is that everyone out there in the pinball buying community

[28:54] Doesn't believe a word Jersey Jack says nor do we hold them to their promises because they've always they've always

[29:02] Fail to deliver on the promises the promises of two games a year the promises of this the promises of that

[29:08] The one time they actually did get it right was when they revealed Willy Wonka they had the game on the line by July 4th

[29:16] So that was what Jack said and that's what Jack did now

[29:19] I think right now they're saying we're not gonna start marketing this game taking orders until it's on the line

[29:26] We're gonna build some Willy Wonka's first make sure that the line here is up and running and all that makes sense all that makes total sense

[29:33] I think the problem is is there are not seeing the force through the trees with where the other

[29:41] Manufacturers are and unfortunately for them even though I think this is the best game out of the bunch

[29:47] Unfortunately for them it seems like they're gonna be last to market with this game

[29:52] Unless we see guns and roses before the 21st

[29:56] Unfortunately for them the more they get towards October

[29:59] They're gonna start competing with cactus Canyon orders and I just think that they're marketing this thing all wrong and

[30:05] Everyone knows it's guns and roses. So I think they're they could easily

[30:10] They could easily start to show some stuff and get all their collectors additions sold

[30:16] Before the game is on the line and let me explain why I feel that way is Avengers on the line right now

[30:22] Doesn't matter was Rick and Morty on the line when they revealed it to the world did it matter?

[30:28] Did they sell everyone if I was Jersey Jack Pimball and Ken Cromwell and Leonard I would be looking at what spooky did

[30:37] With Rick and Morty and say hey look

[30:39] We need to like give up this notion that like we have to like make it extremely hard on ourselves and not give ourselves any

[30:47] Window to get to manufacturing we have to have manufacturing ready the moment we say here's the game and you can have it tomorrow

[30:54] Like who cares like who really doesn't really need to be that immediate?

[30:58] I mean we saw it with stranger things and

[31:01] Stern thought that that was like the most impressive thing that could ever happen in the Pimball world and look how that turned out

[31:07] So what you released a game the same day you revealed it and it's a game that no one really wants so what I mean guns and roses is a game that everyone's gonna want

[31:15] You have it have it in your holster you're ready to fire this amazing game out into the world and you're holding it back

[31:22] Why just so you can stay true to your promise that is really unnecessary to sell games like no one

[31:30] No one doesn't think you're not gonna make these games you have 10 years basically of

[31:37] Manufacturing capabilities no one's not ever gotten their Jersey Jack game

[31:42] It's almost like they're operating in this weird way to stick it to Stern

[31:46] But it's just not gonna doesn't matter because Stern is eating your lunch by taking all this Avengers money because what Jersey Jack also

[31:54] I don't think what they don't realize and I said it before is people are not gonna be able to buy like two

[32:00] Three games in in such a short window of time and I think a lot of the people that want to buy a guns and roses like

[32:06] Yeah, you've got your Jersey Jack buyers who will buy it regardless

[32:09] But man, I think for them to be successful

[32:12] They need to eat Stern's lunch every once in a while and they need to get out in front of Stern's

[32:18] Release schedule and not behind it and they're once again behind it and I think they're just sitting idly in a weird time

[32:27] And like you can't be idle right now you've got to be you've got to be remaining relevant and keeping people

[32:33] Uh in on your new thing coming and hype it man

[32:37] They hype video games and movies months in advance why are they just not even admitting that it's just guns and roses like that's not gonna change anything

[32:46] It's not gonna spoil the moment of reveal. It's not but I don't know why they're doing this

[32:52] I think it's a mistake. I think they could easily find an interesting way to sell all

[32:57] Collectors editions of this game without even revealing what it is. It's Eric

[33:02] There's only gonna be 250 and if you just say it's effing unbelievable

[33:07] I bet you you'll sell every one did did people see Rick and Morty before they sold every one and Eric has a track record

[33:14] Which people are not nervous. I'm here to tell you right now the two best designers in Pimball are Eric and

[33:19] Keith L. Win and they're levels above everybody and when people see this game

[33:24] They're gonna want it so I just don't get this strategy to stay dormant just just to stay true to some

[33:32] Promise you made that means nothing to anybody see I think they're trying to do this

[33:35] I think they're trying to say well. This is the new Jersey Jack Pimball. This is the new learn Chicago now and we're gonna

[33:42] You know, we're gonna we're gonna stay true to our word and it's gonna and people are gonna be impressed by we didn't reveal it until it was on the line

[33:48] And I'm telling you it's it's like I'm playing the world's smallest violin for you guys right now on my fingers because I just think

[33:54] What you're doing is a bigger mistake?

[33:57] It's a bigger mistake what people want is to see this company make a profit

[34:01] To make money to do it right every week

[34:04] Every week these guys have no money coming in think about how much loss revenue that is I mean count the months in which nothing was on the line

[34:12] And yet they're paying their marketing department of salary

[34:15] They're paying all these people money every month and nothing's coming in so now you have to make up for that

[34:20] So then how come the prices of the games not go up if the prices go up you even have less of a buyer base

[34:27] It's just it's all connected and I'm telling you there's one word

[34:30] There's one word that must be written really big over at Stern Pimball

[34:34] And it's the one thing they never miss and it's deadlines

[34:38] George Gomez is a genius because he keeps

[34:42] Everyone to those deadlines and he doesn't care

[34:45] I bet he deals with a lot of people crying and moaning about this being taken out and we can't order this because it takes too long to get it

[34:52] It doesn't matter the deadline is everything if we hit this deadline

[34:56] We get the game on the line and we're making money at Jersey Jack Pimball

[35:00] I don't think they've ever hit a deadline ever

[35:03] They've never hit a deadline in any of their games ever

[35:06] You know, I didn't air my episode 500, but I'll give you a little bit of like what was in it was that Pat Lawler Keith Johnson

[35:14] Everyone over there. It's a history of blowing by deadlines and I bet you Eric

[35:19] I bet you Eric made the deadline on when he needed to design guns and roses by I bet he did this game has been designed since like

[35:28] fully designed since December of

[35:30] 2019 and then so he designs the game to the deadline in which it was supposed to be ready and now what he's sitting around waiting

[35:38] Waiting waiting, you know when I see pictures of Eric like loading wonka is on to like I'm like why what what?

[35:46] You know no no he's where he's just like waiting idly and and hopefully he's designing his next game

[35:53] Which I'm gonna tell you which titles I think might be after toy story in a future episode

[35:58] But they need to stop sitting idly they need to start building some hype and momentum and I'm doing it for them for free

[36:05] I mean they're lucky canada has the images of their game because I'm here every episode telling you that you're gonna want guns and roses and

[36:12] It probably annoys them. They're like but that's what you need to do you can't just sit by for months and let all these other games come out

[36:21] Because it's gonna hurt your bottom line. I just hope we see it soon. I don't know

[36:25] I really don't know. I don't know if we could see it in a week

[36:28] I wouldn't be surprised if we don't see it to November

[36:30] I heard the line might have changed over and maybe they have some big reveal coming

[36:35] But I hope they use slash to announce this game to the world. I hope Ken has set up an exclusive with like a rolling stone

[36:42] I I really think you know they need to do something that gets this out into the broader media

[36:49] Not just the pinball media because there's so many guns and roses fans out there if I were Ken

[36:53] I'd be all over my G and R form calm, which is the biggest guns and roses forum out there and here today gone to hell

[37:01] Those are the two big ones. I'd be all over that. I'd be working with Fernando who's the manager of guns and roses

[37:08] And I'd be working to get out a a blast out to every single guns and roses

[37:13] I think it's the night train club

[37:15] Make sure this goes out to everyone and here's what I would have done right now right now

[37:20] I would have sold collectors editions and held some exclusively to all those different forums and to the guns and roses fans and

[37:28] Just they these people will gobble it up and they don't even know and they don't even know pinball

[37:33] Probably even exists like this game's even in the works

[37:35] But there's just a lot they could be doing and then I go on Facebook and they're selling me Willy Wonka limited limited edition

[37:41] Willy Wonka's available no

[37:43] SHIT no

[37:46] No, no, no really there was a funny guy in Pins. I was like really I can get a limited edition Willy Wonka

[37:51] I didn't even know this game existed. Yes, we know

[37:55] We know anyway, so I look I just want them to jump in it's gonna be an exciting September

[38:01] But it's just gonna be a lot more exciting if Jersey Jack Pimball just gets their act together and get some stuff going

[38:07] You have a marketing department you hired a head of comms

[38:11] Communicate something I'm here to just give Ken and these guys some it you can change the playbook

[38:17] It's your company you don't have to like stay true to this promise about this

[38:22] Just you got to adjust you got to adapt you got to look at what's happening in the marketplace and I'm telling you

[38:29] It's just not good enough that the game is better

[38:31] People money just might go elsewhere and that's unfortunate and I want to see it go to you guys

[38:36] I've been saying it forever all I've ever wanted is a Jersey Jack pin that just checks all the right boxes doesn't have an Achilles

[38:43] He'll doesn't destroy the movie I love with the worst code ever and this is the game

[38:48] I'm telling you people this is the game. I mean people are saying can any yours your teen yourself up to fail again

[38:54] It's gonna be Willy Wonka all over again. No, it's not trust me

[38:57] You're you're gonna hear this music you're gonna see this pin flip you're gonna see the light show the sounds

[39:03] You're gonna you're gonna see like the fact that this is the first music pin ever remember this people

[39:08] We're the band itself made the pin

[39:11] This isn't like Stern has to license a few songs from Aerosmith and can't afford all the good ones

[39:18] Same with like Metallica

[39:20] They worked with

[39:22] Jersey Jack slash made this game

[39:24] There's no phone call to the record label to see if they can get permission to use a track the dudes in the room with them

[39:31] The dudes in the room with them

[39:33] He's got relationships with Fender Les Paul Gibson Marshall stack who would say no to slash

[39:40] Paul McCartney gave him live and let die you know, I'm saying this is this is not gonna just be a music pin

[39:47] This is gonna be a music pin unlike any other music pin in the history of

[39:52] Pinball music pins and for those of you out there who don't think it's gonna sell well

[39:56] Some of the best selling pinball machines of all time have been music pins

[40:01] This thing's gonna rock it's gonna rock and I can't wait and I just I'm just getting tired of waiting

[40:07] I'm but I'm not gonna spoil it, but it's man. They're really they're really pushing it. They're really pushing it

[40:12] I mean they didn't even like they didn't even hit me up and like, you know, I mean it's it's crazy

[40:18] It's great. They just they trust canada and they should because I'm a very trustworthy individual

[40:24] Anyway, ladies and gentlemen have an amazing weekend exciting time to be in pinball if you're in on Avengers

[40:30] I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to tell you

[40:33] I don't know you know

[40:33] Everyone needs to stop running towards the stern light every time they show you any light

[40:37] It you need to think this stuff through more Jersey Jack needs to adapt their marketing to adjust to the times and

[40:44] Deep roots gonna finally finally show us what they got after five years of promises

[40:49] This is the moment we've got 10 days to go that's not a long time. We all can wait

[40:54] It's funny too like if you're in on Avengers

[40:56] I would just like pause my order and wait to see deep root who knows you might want it more

[41:02] I doubt you're gonna see a better shooting game than Avengers with with Rosa

[41:07] But you know anyway have a great week and everyone we'll talk to you soon

[41:26] You
