[00:00] And Kev feels love tonight.

[00:06] I am number one, no matter if you like it,

[00:10] pretend you sit down here right here.

[00:11] I am number one.

[00:14] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:19] Wow, we did it.

[00:21] From behind the paywall, Canada Spinball podcast,

[00:24] thanks to each and every one of you, we have gone 6 for 6 in the Chwipies,

[00:29] And I am so ecstatic. It was so fun sipping champagne on the first-class flight back to New York City with that

[00:36] Twippy in hand and I just want to say this going to Texas and

[00:41] Celebrating with each and every one of you who was there and getting all of the congratulations from each and every one of

[00:48] You online on Facebook on my phone

[00:51] This is what pinball is all about and I mean it when I say it when I get up on stage

[00:57] It's not about the machines themselves anymore

[01:00] It's about each and every one of us and how these machines have brought us together

[01:05] From all over the world and I can't believe without any public shows

[01:10] I think we put up like seven shows all year

[01:14] We once again have one for favorite pinball podcast and we almost got number two for favorite pinball streamer

[01:21] We got bumped to number three

[01:23] But only because of the weighted voting system and you know that system is in place to try to beat

[01:29] Canada and it makes everybody in second and third place get closer and closer

[01:34] But we still are the world's number one and the world's favorite pinball

[01:39] Podcasts and the numbers don't lie and I love being the people's champion and here's what we're gonna do

[01:46] We're gonna talk about what TPF was like. We're gonna talk about these new games because I was there

[01:52] I love seeing pinside and everybody who was not at the show is

[01:58] Arguing back and forth whether or not games like galactic tank force are any good and I'm gonna give you my

[02:05] Experiences on each of these games and what the vibe was like around each of these titles at Texas pinball festival

[02:13] And then I'm gonna give you my concluding thoughts about what I think comes out of the show now because we've got all of these new games

[02:20] We've got so many pinball machines in the marketplace and now the tough question is this what's gonna happen next?

[02:28] I'll summarize what I think is gonna happen as we head into April

[02:31] It's gonna be four D's yes the letter D and the four D's are gonna be this we're gonna see deliveries

[02:39] We're gonna see delays

[02:40] We're gonna see delight and we're gonna see delusion and those four things are gonna happen

[02:46] We're gonna see stern get games to people

[02:48] We're gonna see people wait forever for pulp fiction

[02:50] We're gonna see certain games really exciting people and then we're gonna see people get

[02:54] Delusional because they ordered a game and they're gonna argue the game is great even if the game is not great

[03:00] We're gonna talk about that so let's do this. Let's start out with a few thank yous

[03:04] I want to thank each and every one of you for all of your support even if you don't love me. I love that you're here

[03:09] I want to thank everybody that came to the Perry's happy hour. I mean it was amazing Friday from 2 to 4 30

[03:16] I reserved a section for 20 people by the end of that happy hour

[03:21] We were about 50 people strong and I was so happy to pick up the tab for each and every one of you

[03:27] And I'm gonna tell you right now you guys can drink you guys can eat and you guys can have a great time

[03:32] But it was great seeing each and every one of you

[03:35] I'm not gonna go out and personally give shout outs because there was so many of you

[03:39] But I do want to say a very happy belated birthday to Ian over in the UK

[03:45] It was so much fun hanging with you your beautiful wife and your beautiful son and there are so many of you out there

[03:50] Who came up to me and we had such good?

[03:54] Conversation and crack as they would say in Ireland no not the drug

[03:58] But crack which is just a really good time and that was what the show is all about and I literally landed in the airport and

[04:06] Derek picked me up in his Porsche

[04:08] GTS electric car and yes Derek the GTS is nicer than the base level and he drove me right to Paris and then the happy hour

[04:15] Started right away

[04:17] So my show got off to a bang and that's always the highlight of the show for me is just hanging out with each and every one of you

[04:24] And I also want to thank Hector for picking up the tab at tight end and introducing me to all these rare

[04:29] Bourbons, thank you Hector you are the man if you don't know who Hector is down in Mexico

[04:33] I mean this guy is wearing a jumpsuit that should have came with Jersey Jack's godfather's CE

[04:39] I mean he looked like a mob boss Hector. I love you brother

[04:42] It was also meeting some of my female friends like Tory and honey such nice people everybody is so nice

[04:48] Now look I said I'm not gonna go down a list because I want to talk about what TPF was like

[04:53] Let's start with the Twipees the Twipees were much much better this year

[04:57] I know they still have issues with the microphone and where to keep it because when you listen online

[05:03] It's like they're screaming at us sometimes

[05:06] But the show itself and being in the show itself in Texas was a blast

[05:12] They did a much better job the flow was really great. So Todd and Emoto and Will thank you for putting on such a great show

[05:20] I just want to throw someone out there that I think should host it next year Rebecca from Fliptronic

[05:26] She did the red carpet. She was freaking

[05:29] Amazing and I think she has the perfect energy and she knows how to like keep the crowd going and drop anecdotal jokes throughout each interview

[05:36] I think Rebecca at Fliptronic. I think we just found our next Twippy host for 2023

[05:42] I also feel like I want to open up the podcast category for next year. I've wanted six years in a row

[05:48] I would love to give the award next year

[05:51] Take Canadian's podcast out of the running and let's let someone else win the award

[05:56] I know this is gonna upset some of you

[05:58] We have an entire year to change our mind on this strategy, but I want to know what you feel about that

[06:03] I know you love seeing me get up there

[06:05] But maybe we now give someone another crack at it or its best new podcast or some different category

[06:11] But I would love to get up there next year and have no pressure and just be able to give the award finally

[06:18] I will also say this Todd Tucky is amazing

[06:20] So do you know after I won the award when Todd said there is a villain in every great movie?

[06:28] They originally wanted him to say that I was a podcast that people hated and he said I was not gonna say that word

[06:36] And I want to say Todd. Thank you so much and it still goes to show you

[06:40] How can the world's favorite pinball podcast still be labeled as this negative thing?

[06:45] And if you walked around the show with me you saw nothing but love

[06:50] Nothing but

[06:51] enthusiasm for pinball and I loved every moment of going around that show because it was nothing but love it was nothing but good vibes

[06:58] There was no toxicness at all and any of the toxic people and they were there the people I know who hate me

[07:05] They were the ones who were turning around and walking right away

[07:07] And they're the ones who are not having fun and we're winning all of us the canada army the canada club

[07:14] And I want to say this right now. You're no longer an army in my book

[07:17] You're no longer a club in my book

[07:19] You are all part of the canada family and I love that each and every one of you is here now

[07:24] Let's talk about the games at TPF. Here's what I'm gonna do it

[07:27] I'm gonna go down all of the new games

[07:29] I saw at the show and I'm gonna do them in this order

[07:32] We're gonna talk about Turner pinballs ninja Eclipse pinball brothers queen

[07:38] Multimorphics final resistance spooky pinballs scooby-doo stern pinballs food fighters Jersey Jacks the godfather

[07:46] CGcs pulp fiction and I will end with American pinballs galactic tank force. How does that sound?

[07:52] Let's get right to it. All right, so Turner pinball this guy Chris Turner. He worked with deep root

[07:57] He brought this new game ninja Eclipse to the show. They had a little booth

[08:02] I did not talk to him and I'm gonna be candid about each and every one of my feelings on all of these companies and their booths and

[08:09] The vibes at the show this game had no business being there

[08:13] It wasn't ready to show off in the company of all of these new games

[08:18] Seeing this game and where it is headed the only way this ninja Eclipse game will ever find any customers is if this game is priced

[08:26] Between three and four thousand dollars and that's what it looks like right now

[08:31] I know it's early on in development, but I just want to say this right now

[08:36] We don't need another pinball company that has no idea how to manufacture games

[08:41] And that's why I can't even take these guys seriously deep root did not know how to make any games

[08:45] Why would this guy know how to do anything on a

[08:49] Manufacturing level and I never would have shown up with a game like this because again who cares about ninja Eclipse

[08:56] When we have all of these amazing other games coming out into the pinball market

[09:00] All right before I move on to pinball brothers Queen the other thing I wanted to say about the show is this

[09:05] Texas pinball festival is amazing. It is so much fun

[09:08] It is two days non-stop of partying and pinball and people and that's the best way to describe the show

[09:15] Here's the one thing that's really challenging when it comes to a pinball show like Texas

[09:20] It is really hard to get immersed into the games the show itself is so loud

[09:26] Everything is going at the same time

[09:28] Imagine trying to go to a car show and every car is revving its engines at the same time

[09:33] That is what TPF is like

[09:34] So when you finally get up to a machine and you want to play it and you want to experience it

[09:39] You are not going to experience the machine in the right way

[09:42] It's hard to hear the music the call-outs everything about it

[09:46] This is not the ideal format for how to immerse yourself in a brand new pinball machine

[09:51] And that is why I think these manufacturers when they're dealing with people like canada and carry hardy and other content creators

[09:58] They should really invite us to a more intimate moment in which we can experience the game

[10:04] They can tell us what the rules are and they can walk us through and give us like a half hour

[10:09] Intimate experience with the game because I have to come back to you now and give you my first impressions on each of these machines

[10:16] And there's no way my first impressions are gonna be that amazing

[10:19] So just keep that in mind as I tell you my first impressions with each of these games

[10:23] But I still did get a great sense for shots and for layouts and for toys and for magic in these games

[10:30] So I think I saw enough to make an initial first impression

[10:34] Alright, so let's go over to pinball brothers queen pinball and I played a few games of queen pinball and the game shoots fine

[10:41] The flippers are a little weak on queen. I didn't like the flipper feel problem with queen pinball to me is simply this the game feels

[10:48] Very dated it feels dated in every way

[10:52] It just feels dated you walk up to it and we're used to now seeing you know music pins like food fighters and guns and roses

[10:59] And the moment you walk up to a music pin like Metallica or AC DC

[11:03] You know, I think a music pin needs to hit you in a way that just makes you really excited and when you walk up to queen pinball

[11:09] There's just something about the way it looks the artwork the sculpts everything in this game

[11:15] Just feels like a game that would have come out 10 years ago and it just doesn't look good

[11:21] It looks very dated and stale

[11:24] It just feels like a B level game and the problem with queen pinball

[11:29] Is it cost as much as games like guns and roses games like food fighters?

[11:33] So unless you really really love queen, I don't think you're gonna be looking at this game. All right, let's get on to

[11:39] Multimorphics final resistance. I think final resistance is a really cool game for the

[11:44] Multimorphic platform and I think the music is great. I mean come on

[11:47] It's Scott Denisi the music was great

[11:49] The lights were great that major mech tank thing is really cool. It's a fun game for a

[11:55] Multimorphic owner if you own a multi-morphic

[11:57] I think you're really gonna want this game

[11:59] But again, this is just not enough for me to be writing a check for

[12:04] $11,700 for the platform

[12:06] I just don't want to own enough of the portfolio of games of

[12:11] Multimorphic to go in on one and that's just me personally and I think still that's how a lot of people feel and I heard Jerry's also

[12:18] Gonna announce another game this year for this platform. I'm still really nervous that production for this

[12:25] Multimorphic unit. It just isn't happening fast enough. I don't see many people unboxing weird owls

[12:31] And so as I was playing this game

[12:33] I also just have that in the back of my head these guys can't really make these units

[12:38] And so if you order this game

[12:41] When are you going to get it and it falls into that D column of like

[12:45] Delays and I think you're gonna be waiting forever to get your

[12:49] Multimorphic and I still think Jerry is missing that triple a theme game like weird owl was a step in the right direction

[12:56] But I'm also not seeing many people unbox their weird owls

[13:00] So look a cool Scott Denisi game if you're a Scott Denisi fan

[13:04] The question becomes is this is this game better than TNA, right?

[13:09] And so look you could probably go get a used TNA for a good four to five thousand dollars less money

[13:15] Then this game itself and then you don't feel the pressure to have to buy the other games for the Multimorphic system

[13:21] That's the problem with this system. All right

[13:24] I know you didn't tune into this to hear my thoughts on

[13:26] Multimorphic and that's why I'm saving the other games and you can see I'm saving the big titles for the end here

[13:31] The other caveat I want to say about all these games people is the prices in pinball are so high now

[13:37] Every single game I went up to how to think about how much is the price of this game?

[13:41] And you can't get around that when you stand over a godfather you can't get around the price

[13:47] You know, I think we're looking at all these games now like how much do they cost?

[13:51] I mean talk about the most ridiculous item at the show. There was a Batman SLE at the show for sale for

[14:00] $38,500 and I walked around the game and it was all beat up and scratched

[14:04] I mean the decals were scratched the back box was all beat up and you can't replace those decals from stern pinball anymore

[14:11] And so look I just bought a Batman SLE for 25k

[14:14] There are now only

[14:16] 79 Batman SLEs in the world because nobody's gonna want this destroyed one and I felt so bad like seeing a Batman SLE

[14:24] In that condition trying to make that much money

[14:27] It was like looking at a celebrity that used to be beautiful

[14:30] Who's now like a meth head and all washed up living under a bridge?

[14:35] That's what that Batman SLE looked like and I always feel bad when people bring a museum quality game to a show and let people

[14:43] Beat on it for like two days like some of these games should never be on location and Batman SLE is one of those games

[14:51] All right, so let's go on to spooky pinball and Scooby-Doo now look part of me going around a show like Texas

[14:59] It's not just the games themselves

[15:00] It is how did each manufacturer treat me at the show and I just want to say this

[15:06] I'm a human being and so when I walk up to a company and I see their games at the show

[15:12] It's really interesting to see who says hi to me and who gives me the cold shoulder who looks the other way

[15:19] I'm very perceptive. I can see what's happening

[15:22] I can see who wants to talk to me and who doesn't you know who was the rudest to me at the entire show

[15:27] I'm just gonna be honest because I went up to him and said hey Mike Mike

[15:31] Vinicor over at stern pinball just was so rude to me at the beginning of the Twippy's and I was so taken aback by how

[15:38] Rude he was to me and I don't even know what I did to Mike

[15:40] I don't even speak about Mike you should relax buddy because I'm getting people excited about your company far more than any marketing

[15:47] Efforts you're doing my friend so chill out bro. It's just pinball

[15:50] My point is the nicest people that I encountered when I walked up to their booth at Texas pinball festival

[15:57] Was the crew over at spooky pinball and you've listened to my show. I've been very candid about this company

[16:04] I mean I made this company redo their playfields to get rid of hedge multi-bots

[16:08] There are reasons why spooky might love me

[16:11] There are definitely reasons why spooky might hate me, but when I walked up to spooky's booth

[16:16] I got the nicest greeting from bug out of any company in the entire industry and I want to say that goes a long way

[16:24] I mean you are at a show

[16:26] Everybody is a potential customer and canada is easy to hate

[16:30] But also canada has a large following and canada has fans so why would you treat canada with such anger?

[16:36] Why would you brush canada off if you saw him at your booth?

[16:39] And so bug was really nice the other thing bug did that nobody else did and I mean is nobody else did this when I

[16:46] Walked up to play scooby-doo for the first time bug walked over and said hey

[16:51] Can I give you some pointers on how to play the game for the first time?

[16:55] He was the only pinball manufacturer that did that everyone else saw me in their area everyone else saw me in their section

[17:02] But he was the only one you said hey Chris

[17:04] Let me show you how to jump on to this game for the first time and it just goes to show you in life people

[17:09] The details matter all these little encounters we have with each other they matter

[17:15] This is how a brand's reputation is formed. It's not just because you launched a game

[17:20] It's how you interact with people on a daily basis that really matters

[17:25] And so I was so appreciative of bug and him walking me through the game and then I jumped on to scooby-doo now

[17:31] Here are my thoughts on scooby-doo the game is beautiful. I mean this is absolutely a gorgeous game

[17:37] They brought six of them to the show they all sold out the game itself is absolutely gorgeous

[17:42] The other part about the game is this this is gonna be a very friendly pinball game

[17:48] And that's like a canada nice way of saying this is a pretty easy game to get into and to

[17:54] Experience the gameplay because it's not a difficult game. It doesn't drain very often

[17:59] You're gonna be able to hit these shots in a fan layout

[18:03] It's easy to get the ball to the upper play field

[18:06] Everything about this game is very welcoming to a casual player

[18:10] And I talked to a lot of people at the show and that element of this game has a lot of people excited because there were a lot of

[18:17] New games at the show that are just really hard. They're really brutal. You're gonna drain all the time

[18:22] There's air balls all the time, but scooby-doo is a game that if you walk up to it

[18:27] You're gonna be able to like experience the game

[18:30] You're gonna be able to get that ball to different areas of the play field. You're gonna be able to get into a mode

[18:35] I did find the game easy, but I also had a lot of fun playing it and I'm not the best pinball player

[18:41] And so I appreciate the fact that there is something for everybody and spooky pinball

[18:46] Scooby-doo is a game that more casual people and families will absolutely enjoy

[18:52] And we can't look at every pinball machine like it needs to be for everybody and that's the other thing

[18:57] I loved about all of these games

[18:59] There's basically something for everyone at every skill level and there's something for everyone with all of these different themes out

[19:06] There with all of these new releases

[19:08] The other thing I noticed about Scooby-doo was the flipper feel and the flipper feel was great

[19:13] Like these were some of the strongest flippers at the entire show which made shooting the game so much fun

[19:19] And I also really enjoyed the upper play field. I know some people have been complaining about it being too slow

[19:25] I don't agree with that

[19:26] I like the fact that when you shoot the ball up the middle you have to hold the left flipper to open up the bookcase to keep

[19:32] The ball and play in the upper play field. I like how many shots are on that upper play field

[19:37] It's not just like a loop around a spinner over and over again

[19:41] There's a lot you can do up there, you know and also talking to the spooky crew

[19:44] They said like this game's got a lot of challenging elements in the code itself

[19:49] Even if the shots themselves are not the most difficult

[19:52] It is gonna be difficult to get through some of the modes because of how deep the modes are and that's what I think pinball should be

[19:59] I don't like it when games are frustrating because the design is always trying to punish me

[20:04] You can punish me enough by making me have to hit a sequence of shots in a row

[20:08] Like it's hard enough to do that but to have to do that and the game is also always sending balls right down the middle or cheap

[20:14] Outlane drains like Willy Wonka like I don't like that stuff

[20:17] I don't like when a game's layout is designed to punish me

[20:20] I like when a game's code is difficult, but it's fun to try to get through the code

[20:25] So look spooky pinball. This is your best game to date. It looks gorgeous

[20:28] You're gonna sell everyone and again. Thank you for being such nice people. It goes a really long way

[20:34] They even gave me a free sweatshirt and t-shirt. I didn't even ask for it and it looks great

[20:38] But as I said to them you can't buy canada's loyalty

[20:41] I will still be candid if these guys mess something up

[20:44] I'll be the first one to call them out on that. All right stern pinballs food fighters

[20:49] There were a lot of food fighter machines at the show. I also want to say jack danger was super nice to me jack is a great guy

[20:56] I always like hanging out with jack. He's taller than me. He has a cooler jacket than me

[21:01] He's more handsome than I am

[21:03] Everything about jack danger it makes canada look like a hobbit next to jack danger

[21:07] But I'm super excited to see jack danger and his food fighter game

[21:10] I got to play it a few times and here's my take on the food fighters again

[21:14] You got to remember you can't really hear much at the show

[21:16] So like getting into the animations and the call outs and the music was not possible at tpf

[21:22] But my take on food fighters. It's a beautiful machine. The only thing is this we've now had so many beautiful

[21:29] Machines from zombie Eddie look and great art is great art and this is great art

[21:33] It just doesn't wow as much anymore

[21:35] Simply because we've had so many of his art packages on stern machines and that's interesting, right?

[21:41] We start to get used to stuff

[21:43] That's really really nice and then the question becomes how do you take stuff to the next level?

[21:48] And so when you stand over food fighters the thing I love about the game is it's very unique

[21:52] I love the layout of this game. It doesn't feel like any other stern machine. I've ever shot before

[21:58] Absolutely unique layout. It doesn't shoot anything like Godzilla

[22:02] It's a very fresh design for a stern game and I absolutely enjoyed shooting it

[22:07] But I do have a caveat on the game itself

[22:10] Are you ready for it when I was standing over the premium and they had a premium there

[22:13] They didn't have an elite when I was standing over that game and I was looking at what was in it from a mechanical

[22:19] Standpoint I couldn't help but feel like we are really getting ripped off by stern pinball

[22:24] There's just not a lot in the game from a mechanical standpoint and for an Ellie of this machine to be

[22:32] $13,000 no, thank you. I just can't see the value at all in them charging that much for what's in this game

[22:39] Don't get me wrong the game shoots great the game looks great the animations are amazing, but from a pure mechanical

[22:47] standpoint, there's really nothing on a toy level or a

[22:50] Mechanical level that is going to wow you you're gonna hear my conclusion on the entire show and this is gonna be a theme

[22:57] But for this much money right for spending ten thousand on a premium or

[23:03] $13,000 on an Ellie of food fighters

[23:05] I really want there to be something that wows me that goes beyond

[23:10] Artwork that goes beyond the animations on the screen and I think every pinball machine that is at least

[23:17] $10,000 or more should have a mechanical thing in it that creates a pinball moment that makes you say wow

[23:25] I just don't think food fighters has that I think it's got the gameplay

[23:30] It's got the flow and it falls into that new narrative that these distributors want you to believe that shots are the new toys in

[23:38] Pinball I don't believe that it doesn't cost money to make good shots

[23:42] It costs money to engineer toys in a game

[23:45] And so I did leave this game feeling a little bit like I wish it had something like the toy box in

[23:51] Aerosmith, you know something like the bell and the cannon and AC DC

[23:56] Something like the disappearing hammer in like Metallica. It just doesn't have that mechanical thing that's gonna wow you

[24:03] All right, let's move on to Jersey Jack pinballs the godfather now look Jersey Jack had a huge spread at TPF right when you walked in

[24:10] They were right there and they had a lot of godfathers. They had a couple CEs there. They had dialed in they had Hobbit

[24:17] I don't know if they had a Wizard of Oz they might have there was no pirates of the Caribbean there

[24:21] But it was all about the godfather now

[24:23] I want to give you my first impression of godfather pinball and I'm gonna be honest

[24:28] I'm gonna be completely candid here. I didn't get the warmest reception from Jersey Jack pinball Jack was very nice

[24:33] Jack shook my hand Jack came over to me Jack is always a gentleman although Jack did grab my

[24:39] Canada hat off my head without my permission and then signed it with his name. I did not like that

[24:46] I did not appreciate that. I don't think you do that. I don't think you take someone's article of clothing

[24:51] Off of them and then sign it with your marker. No, no, I worked too hard for my stuff

[24:56] I don't want to have Jersey Jack signature on my canada hat. So I went quickly upstairs and removed it from my hat

[25:02] I did not get a warm reception from Ken. I saw him there

[25:05] You get the shoulder shrug and the head nods that I'm there, you know, but nothing no one came over Eric said hi

[25:10] But that's about it

[25:11] No one really wanted to talk to me at Jersey Jack pinball and I could understand why and so look I went up to the game

[25:16] And I want to say this the CE of this game is absolutely beautiful. It is a gorgeous cabinet

[25:23] It is bright. It is bold. It is gorgeous. I mean, there's no doubt about it

[25:27] Like this thing stands out from an artistic standpoint with franchise artwork those gold legs pop tremendously

[25:34] It is a very ornate beautiful game

[25:37] I stood over the godfather and I played a couple games now

[25:40] Remember trying to get into a deep rule set game at Texas pinball festival where you cannot hear almost anything

[25:48] Is not the best experience but I'm gonna say this right now when you just stare down at the godfather

[25:53] It looks like the most barren Jersey Jack game to date

[25:57] It just does like they had a dialed in there and I walked back and forth between dialed in and this and it was like

[26:04] Oh my gosh, if this thing is 12 or $15,000

[26:08] Then dialed in should be $30,000 and that's how I felt

[26:12] It almost takes a while to get used to standing over a Jersey Jack game

[26:16] That is pretty wide open like the godfather and doesn't have many toys or major mechs in the game because we're so used to Jersey Jack games

[26:24] Just being loaded having a lot more stuff near the flippers having a lot more

[26:28] Mechanisms in the game and when you stand over this game, it kind of felt like their version of Black Knight

[26:34] I was like wow

[26:34] This is pretty wide open and pretty empty feeling for a game that cost this much money

[26:41] And yes, is it Jersey Jack's best flipper feel to date? It absolutely is does it have much better flow than guns and roses?

[26:49] Absolutely it does but I can't escape how empty the game really feels and also the major toy in the game

[26:55] Right the guy up the center with the spinning disc that doesn't create any wow in pinball

[27:01] It doesn't give you the wow and I was at Texas pinball festival when they unveiled Pirates of the Caribbean

[27:07] And we saw that upper playfield rocking ship and the cannon shot and the whirlpool ramp and the three spinning discs

[27:14] And I remember what it was like when Jersey Jack would unveil a game and there was so much physically and mechanical in it

[27:21] That would wow us as a pinball fan and when you play godfather

[27:25] It's just not there mechanically and that's why you're hearing the narrative like shots are the new toys because that's all

[27:31] It's really God is a bunch of shots that divert and a bunch of different directions

[27:36] But it just doesn't have a wow toy and I think even though the game is fun to shoot

[27:40] I think everyone's takeaway on godfather is gonna be simply this the game is extremely

[27:46] Overpriced and I think everyone is feeling that way about these JJP machines. It doesn't look like a

[27:53] $12,000 game. It doesn't look like a

[27:56] $15,000 game and it's because of what's on the playfield

[27:59] People are not gonna go in because of radcals and toppers

[28:02] They need to see the mechanical wow in a game if they're gonna write a check for 16 5

[28:07] The other thing is I think everyone now realizes if you go in on these games early on you're gonna lose so much money

[28:14] So if you're curious about godfather

[28:17] You're just gonna wait and pick up a used one and that's where it's out with Jersey Jack pinball

[28:21] And I got to be honest

[28:22] I feel like the vibe around JJP these days after Toy Story and now

[28:28] Godfather I don't think anyone's really excited what this company is delivering at these prices if godfather le was

[28:37] 9500 I think the enthusiasm for this game would be so much greater, but at

[28:43] $12,000 I'm just not feeling it and I'm definitely not feeling a thousand CEs at

[28:49] $15,000 and I think their marketing department is letting down their designers because if all these games now are gonna be this moving forward

[28:57] I think the enthusiasm around Jersey Jack pinball isn't there right now

[29:02] And I heard more rumors that Steve Richie's game is Elton John

[29:06] And if you go from Toy Story 4 to Godfather to Elton John, I'm not sure that's gonna be a winning formula

[29:13] Now we did hear from Eric that he is going to add more length to the Godfather clips from the movie

[29:19] That is good news because that's the other thing ladies and gentlemen

[29:23] I'm just gonna be honest when I walked up to Godfather's CE and I saw that topper

[29:28] It's a cool topper if the game was kingpin or like Dick Tracy

[29:33] It just doesn't fit this theme at all

[29:36] And so a lot of what I saw at TPF just reinforced my feelings on the Godfather that it's just not the Godfather

[29:43] It's a mafia game in which they've licensed the Godfather for the artwork and for some clips through the cutscenes

[29:51] And they're using the characters from the movie in the game itself

[29:55] But the actual game is not like playing the Godfather movie at all and that's the direction they went in and for some of you

[30:02] That's good enough, but I just think theme integration matters a lot in pinball

[30:06] And I think it's one of the weirdest theme integrated pinball machines of all time and that's it. It's an easy pass for me

[30:12] I never liked this theme to begin with and I think the way they executed it is kind of strange

[30:17] All right now speaking of a game

[30:18] We thought was gonna be executed in a strange way

[30:21] But actually ended up being one of the biggest hits at Texas pinball festival

[30:26] Maybe the biggest hit of the show itself was pulp fiction, right?

[30:29] How could a single level pulp fiction game with no ramps and no LCD screen?

[30:34] How could it be a hit in a modern pinball setting which all of these companies are giving us?

[30:40] LCDs and full RGB controlled lights and all of these ramps and all these wire forms and all this stuff and then

[30:46] Pulp Fiction comes out of left field and becomes the hottest pinball machine right now in 2023 now

[30:52] Here's the thing about CGC's pulp fiction. They had four of them there

[30:55] I got to speak to Ryan White Ryan was really nice

[30:59] You know Ryan's like an interesting character like that's all I'm gonna say like I asked him about Chicago gaming company and cactus

[31:06] Canyons and you know he talks to you in these like weirdly hyperbolic and dramatic ways

[31:11] And I'm not even sure after having a conversation with Ryan White

[31:14] I even learned anything new they will be making the cactus canyon games and pulp fiction

[31:19] He said would be on the line in Q3

[31:22] 2023 as I said with the 4d's this is not gonna be one where delivery happens anytime soon

[31:27] You're gonna see a lot of delay between now and when the game is made

[31:30] But here's the thing about pulp fiction when you walk up to this game

[31:34] This was the most visually stunning game at the show. This was the most visually

[31:41] Arresting and impressive game at the show when you walk up to it. This game is just a work of art. It is absolutely

[31:49] Gorgeous, it's gorgeous in its simplicity of execution. It screams pulp fiction through and through

[31:56] It looks like a game that came out years ago

[31:59] It looks timeless and I think that's the thing about this machine that is winning so many people over

[32:06] It's like a modern timeless classic game. We have never had a pulp fiction pinball machine

[32:12] We've never had a Quentin Tarantino machine and when you walk up to this machine

[32:17] everything about it just oozes cool and

[32:20] oozes pulp fiction the topper is

[32:23] Absolutely the greatest topper I have ever seen it just fits so nicely on top of this game and to talk about nice

[32:31] The mirrored back glass on this game is real mirrored back glass

[32:36] It looks phenomenal and I love the juxtaposition of that bright topper with the mirrored back glass

[32:43] And then the very simple cabinet artwork it just works so well

[32:48] And then you've got that classic silk screened play field where the colors on silk screen play fields

[32:55] There's not as many of them that's on like a digital play field like foo fighters

[32:59] But the colors on this machine just pop they just pop so well

[33:05] And that is why pulp fiction le is gonna be the hottest game of the year hands down

[33:11] Everyone is a collector anyone who wants something special

[33:15] This is gonna be the game you're gonna want in your house because it's just a freaking pinball work of art and

[33:22] Theme matters people and my gosh

[33:24] Did they nail the theme on this game when you go up to this machine and you start playing it and you hear the gunfire?

[33:31] Pop bumper sounds go off and you get into a mode and the song starts playing this game is an absolute

[33:38] Blast to play and I played about five games on pulp fiction

[33:42] It's a fun game to shoot the balltimes are kind of long like you can stay on this game for a while

[33:47] It's a slower game

[33:48] It doesn't play as fast as a modern machine

[33:50] But it just breaks up the monotony of what every other game is trying to do and I absolutely love this game

[33:57] I went up to Mark Ritchie. I shook his hand. I said congratulations Mark

[34:02] I think you really nailed it on pulp fiction and you know what he said to me said Chris

[34:06] Thank you that means a lot especially coming from you. So thank you mark for the kind comment and that's it with this game

[34:13] I mean now it's just gonna come down to when can they make these games and Ryan said q3

[34:18] So that's the fall so there's gonna be a long wait for this game

[34:22] But I think this is gonna be the hottest game of the year and the other reason why this is the hottest game of the year

[34:27] It's not just because it's pulp fiction. It's not just because it's awesomely cool

[34:32] It's not just because of the call-outs or the music by David deal

[34:35] The reason why people are walking up to pulp fiction and having a great smile on their face

[34:41] They easily could have charged like 12 5 for the le the reason why is this game is less than ten thousand dollars

[34:49] Chicago gaming company isn't trying to rip us off

[34:52] They're not trying to do any shenanigans with the pricing and they got everything you'd want in this game

[34:58] Everything you want is gonna be in this game

[35:00] And so you're gonna see and you're gonna hear this from a lot of people

[35:03] This was the game at the show that had the longest lines

[35:07] This was the game at the show that most people wanted to hop on now. I'll be it. There's a caveat

[35:13] There was only four of them there

[35:14] So of course the lines are gonna be longer for a game with only four

[35:18] Versus like godfather where they had like ten or foo fighters where there was like 20

[35:22] But there was just a level of buzz and excitement that I did not see at any other booth in the show

[35:28] Beautiful game. I can't wait to each and every one of you get to stand in front of one

[35:32] All right, let's end this show with galactic tank force one of the weirdest launches in pinball history

[35:37] It doesn't even feel like the game launched yet. I really mean it. There's still not today

[35:41] There is still not a great gameplay video of this game

[35:46] Available for people to look at and that is why le's are still for sale and that is why when I read pinside

[35:52] There's still a lot of confusion about this game and I want to give you my impressions on this game

[35:57] I played this game more than I played any other game because I was very curious about this game

[36:04] And this game to me was one of those games where like it's an original IP. It's a galactic tank force Dennis Nordman game

[36:11] What would it feel like to play this game was this game gonna wow us?

[36:15] What was it gonna be like to see that tank in person?

[36:18] It's just what the heck is this game all about right because it's really hard to get your head around a game

[36:24] That's like tanks battling in space

[36:26] But then there's cows and then there's ice cream and you're collecting cow farts in a mode

[36:31] I don't exactly know what's going on with all of this game

[36:35] And then we saw the video clips of like the actors and everyone was complaining about that and the launch video for the game was

[36:43] Terrible and then you know franchise releasing these

[36:46] 1950 error like ads to promote the game like we want you in the galactic tank force

[36:51] You've got the Norman Rockwell Saturday evening post stuff and so you're confused like is this a

[36:57] 1950s game is it a sci-fi can't be movie from that period and then you turn the game on for the first time and it's playing

[37:05] Dubstep music which is weird if it's a 1950s sci-fi game

[37:09] And then you look at the screen and then the animations don't match that and then you look down at the play field

[37:14] And there's a big tank in the middle and all of it like all of it

[37:16] It's all over the place this game and it's even hard for me after playing this game all weekend

[37:22] It's really hard for me to tell you I even know what I experience

[37:26] But let me do my best to try to get my arms around this game and break it down for you first

[37:31] Let's start with the cabinet because here's the truth about this game

[37:35] And I talked to a lot of people who are in the industry

[37:38] Dennis Norman has been trying to make this game for over 10 years

[37:42] He's had this tank cabinet idea for over a decade

[37:45] It's been in people's garages and barns for over 10 years and when I went to the seminar

[37:51] They spend so much time talking about this damn tank cabinet that all of a sudden it clicked for me

[37:56] Like this is just like Dennis Norman's dream to make a pinball machine

[38:01] Where the cabinet is a tank and that is the genesis for this entire game and now it all makes sense

[38:08] It's like they really built this game from the outside in now

[38:12] I believe a pinball machine should be built from the inside out

[38:16] You should start with what's on the play field and before that you should start with the theme

[38:21] And that's how great pinball machine comes about here is the theme

[38:25] And then we're gonna make what's on the play field

[38:28] Integrate that theme in the best possible way and then we will make the cabinet look really nice

[38:33] So people want to walk up to the game and play it, but I think this game does the complete opposite

[38:38] Let's make a crazy cabinet that people want to walk up to that's like a tank and then the game itself

[38:44] Well, we'll just figure that out as we go and that is the ultimate way I feel about this game

[38:49] It feels like a mixture of all these weird different

[38:52] Schizophrenic ideas where they were just trying to figure out what to put into this freakin tank cabinet and none of it is

[38:59] Cohesive at all none of it. It's like this absolute

[39:03] Schizophrenic game that has absolutely no creative direction whatsoever and that is why after playing it

[39:09] I'm gonna give you my gameplay thoughts after playing it

[39:12] I still feel confused about what they're trying to achieve in this game

[39:16] And let me break it down like this so you walk up to this game you walk up to this game

[39:20] It's a tank. All right. It's called galactic tank force when you hit start in this game

[39:26] Guess what it doesn't tell you it doesn't tell you anything

[39:30] About what you're doing in the game when the game starts. Who am I as the player?

[39:35] I don't know where am I right now in this universe? Am I in a tank?

[39:40] Am I on Mars? Am I in out or space?

[39:42] There's zero introduction to the player about what you're doing in this game the moment you start the game

[39:50] The dubstep music starts playing all of a sudden all of this stuff is lighting up on the play field

[39:55] And then this animated red tank is rolling towards you. That's how they introduce you to this original

[40:02] IP game that is a total failure ladies and gentlemen if you're gonna launch an original IP game

[40:08] You have to pull people into the narrative somehow dialed in does a much better job of welcoming you to Quantum City

[40:15] And here's what you need to do. There's absolutely none of that

[40:17] There's like no storytelling whatsoever in this game when you start the game

[40:22] They really need to go back and figure out how to get that into the code of the machine because I don't even know what I'm doing

[40:29] Why am I shooting this tank up the middle?

[40:31] What is the point of any of this and it's all so weird?

[40:36] So you don't need to do that with a license theme people know about because if you walk up to Lord of the Rings or you walk

[40:43] Up to Pulp Fiction or you walk up even to the Godfather you have some sense about what this story is about

[40:50] Who these characters are what happens in the storyline of that movie or TV show?

[40:55] But when you walk up to Galactic Tank Force, I have no idea what the heck is going on who I am

[41:02] What I'm supposed to be doing what is the significance of any of this and here's what I think happened

[41:08] And I'm just gonna say this I think there was a lot of division

[41:11] Internally at American pinball what this game was gonna be I think Christopher

[41:16] Franchi wanted this game to be a

[41:19] 1950s campy sci-fi kind of game his artwork reflects that all of his marketing materials reflect that

[41:26] But the game is not that so I don't think his artwork actually matches

[41:31] What's happening in the game itself and think about it?

[41:34] So the artist's style is not represented in the music or in the video clips or animations of the game itself

[41:41] So there's a disconnect there and then you've got Galactic Tank Force

[41:45] You got this weird like outer space tank battle going on and we've all seen sci-fi movies

[41:50] And you know sci-fi music has a very unique sound to it and then this dubstep music comes in which totally

[41:57] Disconnects you from like the world of outer space and then it starts to make no sense

[42:01] It sounds more like dance dance revolution than it does like an intergalactic tank battle

[42:06] The whole thing is just a mashup of ideas and I'm still not sure I mean this I'm still not sure if it works

[42:13] I will tell you this the tank cabinet is pretty neat to walk up on it

[42:17] But once you fold back the back box, it's absolutely pointless like it's absolutely pointless to have that le or signature

[42:24] Edition of the game and don't get me started on the 17 5 for the signature edition

[42:29] Which is a total joke because I had a friend who bought one at the show for like 15 5 so you can already save

[42:35] $2,000 and this whole call for price BS

[42:37] You know how I feel about that but that novelty of the tank cabinet is absolutely gonna wear off and if you put this game in

[42:43] A lineup of games. It's absolutely pointless. I think the way to go if you want to get one of these games

[42:48] I would just get the deluxe edition because it has every single thing you need in the game

[42:52] Let's talk about the gameplay like I actually enjoyed shooting this game

[42:55] But there's no way around the simple fact this game is just air ball after air ball after air ball

[43:02] And if you shoot up the middle frequently which you do in this game

[43:06] You're gonna get a ton of air balls, and I don't mean just little air balls

[43:09] I mean the ball was flying over the flippers people direct hit up the middle was flying over the flippers

[43:16] It would also fly over that post that pops up to save from a straight down the middle drain

[43:21] That post wasn't even tall enough to stop the air balls from flying over it

[43:25] And I have never played a game with as many air balls as this game has now look you can't fix air balls with code

[43:32] Now that's a problem for them because you can't fix air balls with code

[43:36] This is a really bad design decision that tank and those targets should have been much further up the play field the way

[43:44] They are on attack from Mars, and I don't know why they designed it this way and when I look down at the play field

[43:50] I mean my gosh there were so many dimples on the play field because of that because the ball is always

[43:56] Airballing back and hitting the play field with such high velocity your play field is gonna look like the crater of the moon

[44:03] So you've got all those shots up the middle right and then you've got the ramp to the left

[44:07] Which is a difficult ramp to hit but it's rewarding when you get to hit the ramp and then to the right of the tank

[44:13] You've got this moving target back and forth that's got like the UFO with the cow hanging from it

[44:18] All right, you got that but here's my thing

[44:20] I'm just gonna say this right now there are no toys in this game that really wowed me whatsoever

[44:24] And that is why I walk away from galactic tank force really disappointed because I'm like where are the toys?

[44:31] Where are the toys in this game? I like the artwork. I like the lighting. I like the colors

[44:37] I didn't have a problem with those like floating pin stadium lights

[44:40] You don't even notice them the game is beautiful and stunning when you're standing over it

[44:45] But I just didn't see any mechanical Wow

[44:48] whatsoever in this game the tank doesn't fire balls back at you

[44:52] You know that was the original design instead of those targets being stand-up targets

[44:57] They were supposed to be drop targets

[44:58] And then it was like a scoop that fired the ball back the problem was the ball was firing straight down the middle

[45:04] So they made it the way it is with the magnet in front of the tank, but you've got this campy theme

[45:09] You've got UFOs you've got tanks you've got all this stuff and then nothing in the game

[45:15] Mechanically wow you and that's why I walked away from the game somewhat disappointed is like all of the effort went into the cabinet

[45:23] I wish more effort would have went into the game itself. It's a fun game to shoot

[45:28] It's not bad

[45:29] But I think the reason why you want to play galactic tank force is you're just curious about what the heck is going on

[45:36] It really is a game that makes you want to play it over and over again because of the curiosity around it

[45:41] Not because you're loving it

[45:43] You're just curious what the heck is happening in this game and as far as those like video clips go that we all hated during the trailer

[45:50] They're not really used that often

[45:53] I will say when they do pop up on the screen they look really good the LCD screen on this game looks amazing

[45:59] But again, I have no idea why any of it's happening

[46:02] The game is such a mash-up mess of ideas and I think this game is gonna develop a little bit of a cult

[46:09] Following and there's gonna be some people that immediately praise this game like I'm not gonna name names

[46:14] But someone told me this is a Nordman classic already. No, it's not it is not a Nordman classic already

[46:21] I think this is Nordman's dream of a tank theme game

[46:24] He got AP to make it for him and there's probably a reason why nobody else would make this game

[46:30] You got to remember that right? It's like American pinball needed a hit and they fell victim to Dennis Nordman's dream

[46:36] But when you put it all together a tank cabinet

[46:41] 1950s artwork modern dubstep music weird

[46:46] 1990s like arcade video clips. I just don't think this goes together. I think the game is a creative mess

[46:53] I think it has no creative direction

[46:55] And I think that's why it's just weird and I think some people will accept this weirdness

[47:01] But I think many of you out there will be confused by it

[47:04] And I think this was a really strange game for American pinball to go all in on

[47:10] With Dennis Nordman and I think this is gonna be a really strange game for American pinball

[47:15] I don't think it's gonna have the sales success

[47:17] They think because I think the tank is gonna get old and is the novelty you don't need

[47:22] I think people will enjoy playing the deluxe version for like

[47:26] $8,000 and if they actually offer the standard version of this game

[47:30] I think that would be the best-selling version of the game because you don't need any of the other stuff

[47:35] You just want to see what is all this weird stuff happening and that's my take on galactic tank force now

[47:41] Look, this has been a long show. Let me conclude this show by saying the following

[47:44] I played every single new game pinball is the most expensive

[47:48] It's ever been and I mean it when I say it you're gonna have to play all of these games

[47:53] None of these games

[47:54] I mean it when I say it none of these games have anything in them where the ball does something magical

[48:01] And I want to end this show with that point for this much money and pinball being the most expensive

[48:07] It's ever been I really was somewhat disappointed that the entire industry every single company combined

[48:15] nobody engineered a

[48:18] Single mech that is a wow

[48:20] Mechanism so you can have seven or eight new games, but nothing in them is really magical

[48:27] Nothing from a mechanical standpoint is gonna create a pinball moment that is

[48:33] Unforgettable and that is why even after playing all of these games

[48:36] I am very happy to not buy any of them

[48:40] The one game I am gonna get is pulp fiction le because it's just such a cool work of art and I love that movie

[48:46] But from a pinball standpoint, I am still very disappointed by what's going into these games

[48:53] Mechanically, it's a lot of money people. There's a lot of talent. We know they can do it. We've seen them do it before

[48:59] I just wish what we were getting in these games was as impressive as the prices themselves

[49:05] And that is why I have so much fun with each and every one of you and the community to me has more value than these games right now

[49:13] I'm happy to play older games. I'm happy to buy used games that are great that are masterpieces

[49:18] I think almost all new and box pinball is overpriced

[49:21] And I think a lot of you feel that way and I think we're gonna get our pinball kicks together with each other

[49:27] And I think a lot of us are gonna be keeping our money in our wallets until these companies get back to engineering

[49:34] Something in a pinball machine that is a wow moment everybody. Thank you so much for your hospitality down in Texas

[49:41] I love each and every one of you for supporting this show. Thank you. We'll talk to you soon
