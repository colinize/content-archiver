[00:00] Oh, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:17] I hope everybody had a great Thanksgiving with the family.

[00:20] I hope you had some turkey, maybe some football, and everybody got together, watched the parade,

[00:26] watched the dog show, and now we're here.

[00:27] It's Black Friday.

[00:29] Black Friday deals are swooping across the pinball world.

[00:32] Canade is excited to go around the pinball horn.

[00:34] We're going to put all that drama behind us.

[00:36] I've unsubscribed to this weekend pinball.

[00:38] I've unsubscribed to the Kinetesis, and I'm just going to focus on doing what you love,

[00:43] which is the greatest entertaining podcast about what's going on with these manufacturers,

[00:48] because nobody cares about the damn content creators, me included.

[00:51] All right, so people, here's what we're going to talk about.

[00:53] We're going to talk about the Black Friday deal over at American Pinball.

[00:57] We're going to talk about distributors getting Elton John machines.

[01:00] Is this going to help with game sales?

[01:02] We're going to talk about the code over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:06] There's an issue with the Jersey Jack Pinball code that I'm starting to hear people finally

[01:10] realize, and it's not about completing the code.

[01:13] It's about something else, and we're going to talk about what's going on over at these

[01:17] manufacturers.

[01:18] What are the rumored titles?

[01:19] We've got new rumored games from Stern Pinball.

[01:22] We've got people thinking that some Stern games that we think are coming out might actually

[01:26] be code names for other stuff, and we're just going to go around and make a 20-something

[01:31] minute entertaining Pinball podcast.

[01:33] Now, I'm going to tell you right now, there's not going to be a Black Friday deal on Canada's

[01:38] Pinball podcast, because at $5 a month, it's the best bang for fucking all the Pinball.

[01:43] So let's start with American Pinball.

[01:45] They have a Black Friday deal, which is a little strange, because the image has images

[01:49] all of their new title, Galactic Tank Force.

[01:53] And if you read about the Black Friday deal, you don't get anything off that machine.

[01:57] What you will get is if you buy Legends of Vahala, they will remove $400 off the price

[02:04] of the machine.

[02:06] And the game was weirdly priced to begin with.

[02:08] It's like $8,395, and you could have it if you wanted today through Sunday for $7,995.

[02:18] I think the jig is up over at American Pinball.

[02:21] They don't know what they're doing.

[02:22] They don't know how to market.

[02:24] They don't know the themes people want.

[02:26] And now they're doing this weird deal for this Legends of Vahala game, where the hype

[02:31] is completely gone on the machine.

[02:33] And I just don't think David Fix has any of the answers.

[02:36] I don't think they know what they're doing.

[02:38] And I don't think until this company shakes up the leadership team over there, we're going

[02:42] to see anything really good from American Pinball.

[02:45] And I'm going to tell you right now, one of the unlicensed theme games they have is a

[02:49] food truck machine from Berrio.

[02:52] I heard it's single level.

[02:53] So maybe they bought the code that Deeproot worked on for food truck.

[02:57] And instead of having all the complex mechanisms, they're just going to use switches to get

[03:02] you through the code in the game.

[03:04] I don't think anybody wants that.

[03:06] And again, if history repeats itself, it's just going to be more of American Pinball

[03:10] giving us what we don't really want.

[03:12] All right, so let's move on from American Pinball.

[03:15] Talk about giving something that people do want in the Pinball Brothers version of Alien.

[03:21] There is now going to be a predominant image of Ripley on the Translight in like a space

[03:27] outfit helmet.

[03:28] It looks way better than the Power Loader one where you don't even see her face.

[03:32] So good job, Pinball Brothers, on making the Ripley version of the game actually telegraph

[03:38] that it's the Ripley version of the game.

[03:41] I reached out to them.

[03:42] Oric Lawson did the artwork on this new Translight.

[03:45] It looks really good.

[03:46] They also said the other side of the cabinet is going to be different as well.

[03:51] So they were waiting for approval on some of these other alternative versions of the

[03:55] game that predominantly feature Ripley and they couldn't get approval in time by the

[04:00] time they took the game to Expo.

[04:02] So that's a good thing.

[04:03] So anyone who ordered this game is going to feel better about getting more Ripley on

[04:07] the machine.

[04:08] All right, so that's happening over at Pinball Brothers.

[04:10] Let's go to Spooky Pinball.

[04:11] They're starting to send everybody clues to their newest game.

[04:15] I got a clue a few weeks ago.

[04:17] They've been doing Facebook Lives with a few clues.

[04:20] They mailed Don over at Don's Pinball podcast.

[04:23] They mailed him another clue, which looks a little bit like an upper play.

[04:26] It looks like a tiny little portion of an upper play field.

[04:30] Maybe it's a chainsaw.

[04:31] Maybe it's a halo weapon.

[04:33] I mean, the speculations are running wild.

[04:35] I do think it's fun that Spooky Pinball is doing this.

[04:38] They are throwing clues all throughout the Pinball media world and all throughout Facebook

[04:42] live streams that they're doing.

[04:44] And I think Spooky Pinball, you know, as a company is just having a lot of fun.

[04:47] They're having a lot of fun.

[04:48] Like they've sold pretty much all of these Scooby-Doo's.

[04:51] They sold all of their TNA's.

[04:53] And now they're moving on to new themes.

[04:55] And the reason why Spooky Pinball is having a lot of fun, whether or not they put the

[04:58] mechanical magic we want into the games, the reason they're having so much fun is they

[05:03] are making themes that they love and they are making themes that build their Spooky

[05:08] brand.

[05:09] And I can't say that about everybody else.

[05:11] I mean, when you look at Jersey Jack's theme selection, it's all over the place.

[05:15] And I think Spooky Pinball, when they wake up and they see like Scooby-Doo on a translate,

[05:20] it's a dream come true.

[05:22] When they wake up and they say, hey, we're the only Pinball company that ever made a

[05:25] Halloween Pinball machine, that's a dream come true.

[05:29] And so I think this company is going to keep getting better as they make more themes that

[05:34] connect with what they're passionate about.

[05:37] And that's how pinball should be done.

[05:39] The only part I don't like is one design where they carry two separate themes over that design.

[05:44] I hope we don't see that again.

[05:46] The rumor is we are going to.

[05:48] So look, I mean, I think every pinball machine should be designed from the ground up with

[05:53] the theme in mind, because how can you design mechanisms if you're not designing it for

[05:58] that particular game?

[05:59] All right, what else is going on in pinball?

[06:01] We've got Spooky Pinball.

[06:03] Guess is happening galore.

[06:04] We've got a few more months of Scooby-Doo production.

[06:07] I think we're going to hear what their new game is maybe by the end of the year.

[06:10] Spooky likes to do a December announcement.

[06:13] They've done it before and maybe they'll do it again.

[06:16] All right, what else is going on?

[06:18] Jersey Jack Pinball is sending prototypes of Elton John or show examples of Elton John

[06:24] to its distributors, which is good.

[06:26] The more they get people on this game, the more they're going to get good reviews of Elton

[06:31] John.

[06:32] Predominantly, the Elton John reviews have been very positive.

[06:36] But here's the thing about Elton John people.

[06:38] Let's be honest for a minute.

[06:40] What does everybody say about Elton John Pinball?

[06:42] They're not gushing over the mechanisms.

[06:45] They're not gushing over the amount of stuff that's put into the game.

[06:48] They're simply gushing over the fact that it plays like a stern Steve Richie game.

[06:54] So is this praise for Elton John or is it just more of an indictment that every other

[07:00] Jersey Jack game that's come out over the last 10 years hasn't shot very well?

[07:05] I mean, that's really what's happening here.

[07:07] This is not like a radically imaginative and creative Steve Richie design.

[07:12] It's just finally we get a game that shoots as good as a Black Knight Pro.

[07:17] Let's be honest.

[07:18] Finally, a game that shoots as well as a Black Knight Pro or a Star Trek Pro or an

[07:23] ACDC Pro, right?

[07:25] This is like a Steve Richie Pro.

[07:27] I mean, think about it.

[07:28] There's no upper play field.

[07:29] There's no lower play field.

[07:30] I mean, this is Steve Richie's design wrapped up in a beautiful game.

[07:35] I mean, it is an absolutely stunning game.

[07:38] And every time I see the platinum edition of this game with that Christopher Francie

[07:42] artwork, I want one.

[07:44] I want one at $8,500.

[07:47] I don't want one at $12,000 because we all know that most likely this game is just going

[07:53] to lose so much money in value.

[07:55] I mean, look at this like Godfather pinball machine from IE pinball.

[07:59] I know he plays his games a lot, but these play fields are now holding up.

[08:04] And now you can go get a Godfather for $8,500.

[08:07] I mean, this game was $12,000 less than a year ago.

[08:13] And that's the problem JJP has.

[08:15] It's not about whether or not we want the game.

[08:18] It's whether or not you want to lose $3,000 to $5,000 because they overpriced all these

[08:24] B-themed games.

[08:25] You know, so you will never hear me say Elton John's not a good game.

[08:29] You will never hear me say Elton John's not a great shooter.

[08:32] Now the big question mark I have on Elton John because I was reading the pin side thread

[08:36] and it's funny when people walk up to the game and they play it five times at expo and

[08:41] they're like, and I ordered one after five plays, they ordered one.

[08:44] And I think the big question mark in this machine, it's not whether or not it shoots

[08:49] well.

[08:50] It's not whether or not it's going to light up your home like a Christmas tree all year

[08:53] round.

[08:54] The big question is, is the code going to be fun?

[08:56] Is it going to be satisfying to own this thing after you played it 200 times from what

[09:02] I can see on the code itself?

[09:03] It's got like this screensaver kind of collage of Elton John images and the callouts are

[09:09] pretty terrible and I'm not really sure what the objective is in the game, maybe other

[09:14] than getting to a high score.

[09:16] And then I heard someone say something on pin side that I think hit the nail on the

[09:20] head and it's something that we've all been feeling about Jersey Jack games.

[09:23] It's not just how they shoot.

[09:25] It's not just the weak flipper feel.

[09:28] The real issue with Jersey Jack code and the real issue with their games is simply

[09:33] this, their games, when it comes to the code and it comes to the callouts and it comes

[09:38] to the music now in their last like four years worth of machines.

[09:42] The problem with Jersey Jack code, it simply lacks humanity and personality and urgency

[09:49] and excitement.

[09:50] Like they don't know how to code into their machines like stuff that just gets you going,

[09:57] stuff that's just memorable, stuff that feels like I got to make these shots and there's

[10:01] this sense of urgency and if I don't hit it, something's going to happen and if I do get

[10:05] to it, it's going to unlock this amazing call out that in the way a multi ball starts will

[10:10] be like it does in Adams family and cactus Canyon.

[10:13] And if you go back and play those Bali Williams games, you know, they didn't have deep code,

[10:18] but they had code that really had so much personality.

[10:21] Those games had code whenever something happened that was monumental in the game, you felt

[10:26] it and it connected with you and it made you super excited.

[10:29] And that's my big thing with Jersey Jack games.

[10:32] It's like when you play a game like dialed in, it's got so much code, but it's all just

[10:37] like, you know, it's devoid of any personality.

[10:40] It's devoid of any urgency.

[10:42] It doesn't really get you going.

[10:44] And again, I think Jersey Jack pinball needs to go back and study a little bit what people

[10:49] love about pinball.

[10:50] And I can't say the same thing over at Stern.

[10:52] I think Stern does a much better job with their coding than Jersey Jack pinball.

[10:57] They don't get credit for it.

[10:58] And I think some Jersey Jack fanboys don't give Stern credit for this, but I much prefer

[11:02] a Stern code over a Jersey Jack code.

[11:05] I think Stern pinball has a much better grasp on how to connect with people through the

[11:10] code and how to put much more into the games.

[11:12] You know, some Stern games are too complex like Avengers and some Stern coders.

[11:16] I just don't like, I don't like what Ray Day does.

[11:19] I think he makes it too complex.

[11:20] I don't like what Dwight does.

[11:22] He's just stacking on top of stacking on top of stacking.

[11:25] I think the code with Keith Elwin is the best code team right now.

[11:29] Before that, it was obviously anything Lyman Sheets touched.

[11:32] You know, we'll see what happens.

[11:33] I mean, Elton John is still so early on.

[11:35] What I really would love it if Jersey Jack would mail a machine, not two distributors.

[11:41] Mail these machines to the top 10 pinball buying demographics out there.

[11:46] There should be an Elton John on location in Chicago.

[11:50] There should be one in Seattle.

[11:52] One in New York, right?

[11:53] One in San Francisco, but one maybe in Houston, one in Austin.

[11:57] I don't know what the top 10 pinball demographics are, but think about it.

[12:02] Like how are you going to get more people onto this game?

[12:04] Why would mailing it to a distributor get more people in front of the game?

[12:09] And if I could give them any marketing advice from someone who lives in New York City, I

[12:13] have still yet to play a godfather.

[12:16] I am not going to be able to play an Elton John because no one has one ordered here.

[12:20] And I think the job of Jersey Jack and its marketing department is to put these games

[12:25] where you're going to get foot traffic and you can't just rely on pinball shows.

[12:29] You should have 10 top arcades that you've identified throughout the country who get machines.

[12:36] Don't waste your time throwing them to a distributor.

[12:39] You're not going to get as many people driving to a distro to play a game like this.

[12:43] You know what's interesting about Elton John is I think they went out too early with it.

[12:47] I think they thought Jaws was going to hit in December and now it's not.

[12:51] So I think they went out with this game a little early.

[12:54] I think they were anxious.

[12:55] I also think they're gauging how many orders they're going to get because they don't want

[13:00] to over order parts.

[13:02] And that's why this game was not on the line when they revealed it.

[13:06] So we're going to see what happens with this game.

[13:08] I think Elton John will outsell the godfather I do.

[13:12] The reason why is I don't think anybody wants godfather LE.

[13:15] I think more people are going to want Elton John LE than godfather.

[13:19] I think Elton John LE looks much nicer than godfather LE.

[13:22] It's a better shooter than godfather LE.

[13:25] And I think godfather and Toy Story are both going to lose more value than Elton John.

[13:30] I just think because this is Jersey Jack's best shooting game to date and because it's

[13:35] so beautiful I do think Elton John will hold more value than both Toy Story and godfather.

[13:42] Those two games are going to sink like a lead balloon and they're going to keep going down

[13:46] and down and down.

[13:47] I think we're going to see games like Toy Story LE and godfather LE.

[13:51] I mean it people.

[13:52] I think we're going to see them for like $7,000 within a year.

[13:55] They're just going to keep going down because there's so much stuff coming out.

[13:58] All right.

[13:59] Speaking of coming out, have you heard some of my stern rumors?

[14:03] So I am hearing that next year there is going to be a 70th anniversary of Godzilla.

[14:09] Lots of people upset by this.

[14:11] Lots of people worried that stern is going to make anniversary editions of all of its

[14:15] hot games and that is going to cause the LE values on those games to sink.

[14:20] Now look, the only reason why I think this might not happen even though I hear it's going

[14:24] to happen, the one reason is this.

[14:27] They've never done an anniversary edition on a game where that game had 1000 LEs in circulation.

[14:35] So this would be the first time ever that stern made an additional collectible variation

[14:41] of a game when that game already had 1000 units of an LE.

[14:46] Remember like Jurassic Park only had 500 LEs when they made the anniversary edition.

[14:51] I think Elvira also only had like 500 LEs or 400 LEs and then they had 50 of those signature

[14:57] editions and then they made 200 of the 40th anniversary edition of the game.

[15:03] It's going to be interesting to see what they do.

[15:05] Now where it gets really interesting is if stern does something like this.

[15:09] So imagine a move like this.

[15:11] So 70th anniversary of Godzilla.

[15:14] You don't want to piss off all of these 1000 LE owners but you also know there's an opportunity

[15:20] to put a few more million dollars in the bank for doing nothing more than putting stickers

[15:25] and new armor on the game.

[15:27] I mean that is what it will be.

[15:29] Now will it be as some people are speculating a black and white anniversary edition of Godzilla

[15:35] which would make sense because the original Godzilla movies were in black and white.

[15:40] So that would be interesting right.

[15:42] Black and white in which the only thing green is maybe Godzilla.

[15:45] I could see that looking pretty stunning.

[15:48] This Elvira is the nicest version of Elvira.

[15:51] But here's what I would do if I were them and I'm just going to give them an idea.

[15:55] See I don't want to piss off these 1000 people right.

[15:58] You don't need more Godzilla machines.

[16:00] I mean everybody owns a Godzilla.

[16:02] Even people who don't own a Godzilla own a Godzilla.

[16:04] It's just everywhere.

[16:05] They keep making the premiums.

[16:07] They've made so many LE's.

[16:08] I was never really a fan of the LE version of Godzilla.

[16:12] That silver armor does not pop.

[16:15] The side art is not the most impressive in the zombie yeti portfolio.

[16:19] And there's just something about like the play field itself.

[16:21] The whole game itself just does not pop as an LE version of the game.

[16:25] I wish they did more to make the LE look special.

[16:28] But here's the thing I would do if I were them.

[16:30] If I were going to make 70th anniversary Godzilla.

[16:33] And I didn't want to piss off a thousand people and I'm reading the room and people are starting

[16:37] to be annoyed by this.

[16:39] The only direction forward is this.

[16:41] I would only make 70 editions of a Godzilla 70th anniversary.

[16:47] I would make it more of an SLE and I would charge like $20,000 for it.

[16:52] And that way if you put enough of a gap between that machine and everyone else who owns the

[16:57] LE who only spent 10.5 on their LE's.

[17:00] I think that's a way to make it so you're not really pissing those people off because

[17:04] they would look at that expensive version and be like I don't really need it.

[17:08] It's not worth it.

[17:09] You know and you might attract 70 people out there who just want to own the creme de la

[17:14] creme version of Keith Elwin's masterpiece which is Godzilla.

[17:19] That's what I would do.

[17:20] That's what Canada would do.

[17:21] Don't kill me.

[17:22] I'm a marketer by day.

[17:23] I'm a podcaster by night.

[17:25] And I think Stern Pimbal needs to figure out a way to separate and not cannibalize all

[17:30] those thousand people.

[17:32] And I think that could be the solution.

[17:34] And people get ready for it.

[17:35] People get ready for super expensive Pimbal machines that might sit for a while before

[17:40] they sell everyone.

[17:41] But if you only have to sell 70 to a global audience and you make it look absolutely spectacular,

[17:48] I think they might find a market for it because think about it.

[17:51] I'd much rather have a Godzilla 70th knowing there's only 70 in the world for 20k than

[17:58] a James Bond where there's 500 in the world and the game itself is pretty basic.

[18:03] It would basically be like their Godzilla version of Batman SLE.

[18:08] So let's see if that is the case.

[18:10] The other thing I would do if I was going to charge that much money, you'd have to put

[18:14] a few more exclusive modes into the game.

[18:17] You have to do it.

[18:18] All right.

[18:19] Speaking of rumors over at Stern Pimbal.

[18:21] You know, I broke this rumor, Naps Arcade covered it.

[18:23] I'm hearing that Stern Pimbal has the music license to journey.

[18:27] All right.

[18:28] Don't stop believing Canadian people because we're usually right.

[18:31] So are we going to see Journey Pimbal from Stern and who would do Journey Pimbal?

[18:37] Is that going to be a John Borg game?

[18:39] It doesn't feel like something Jack Danger would want to do.

[18:41] It doesn't seem like something that Keith Elwin would do.

[18:44] And is it going to be something we see this year?

[18:47] Because here's the other rumor I'm hearing.

[18:49] Remember I've been saying that Metallica is coming back.

[18:52] And I'm here to tell you right now, Metallica is coming back.

[18:56] And I'm not sure if it's an anniversary edition, if they're going to call it something else.

[19:00] But here is what I'm hearing.

[19:03] Metallica will be.

[19:04] So sit down, people.

[19:05] It is going to be the same game, the same layout, but it is going to have an LCD screen.

[19:12] So this goes back to the rumor I heard that Metallica band members went to Stern Pimbal

[19:17] and they looked at the new Stern games and then they looked at their machine and they

[19:22] said, hey, can't we make our machine look like a more modern game?

[19:26] And so I am hearing we are going to get another run of Metallica's, but this time they will

[19:31] have an LCD screen.

[19:33] And people, it's not that hard to port over.

[19:37] It is not that hard once you've written all this code to make it so you can display it

[19:41] now on an LCD screen.

[19:43] Will it be all new animations?

[19:45] What will happen?

[19:46] I'm hearing from a really good source that Metallica is coming back with an LCD screen.

[19:51] So what are the rumors at Stern?

[19:53] So look, John Wick, I don't really want a John Wick Pimbal machine.

[19:57] And then there's people speculating now that Dungeons and Dragons is just a code name for

[20:02] He-Man.

[20:03] I don't know about that.

[20:05] I don't really know about that.

[20:06] But the fact that American Pimbal is now saying that it's next three games will be original

[20:12] IP games leads me to believe that they do not have the license for He-Man because if

[20:17] they had the He-Man license, not in a million years would they not make it?

[20:22] I don't know.

[20:23] AP does the dumbest things on the planet, so maybe they wouldn't make it even if they

[20:26] had the license.

[20:27] So here's the thing.

[20:28] I heard from a good source that it's Dungeons and Dragons and the person who owns that license

[20:33] went to Stern directly and wants a D&D Pimbal machine.

[20:38] So keep that in mind, but look, if I had to choose between Dungeons and Dragons and He-Man,

[20:44] I would absolutely rather have He-Man Pimbal.

[20:47] So we shall see what happens there.

[20:49] We know about the rumors of Pokemon.

[20:51] We know about the rumors of John Wick.

[20:54] Here's the game that I think John Borg designed that got shelved.

[20:57] Are you ready for it?

[20:58] You know how I was saying there's turmoil over at Stern and not everybody's happy?

[21:02] The game I think John Borg designed.

[21:04] This is just a guess.

[21:05] The game I think he designed that got shelved because Stern fumbled the license or didn't

[21:11] want to pay for it.

[21:12] My guess is it was Indiana Jones.

[21:14] And I had from really, really good sources that a new Indiana Jones Pimbal machine was

[21:19] coming out, the movie came out, and John Borg made the old Stern Indiana Jones Pimbal machine.

[21:25] And I think this is one of those where like Borg was working on it and he had it ready

[21:30] to go and Stern just didn't want to move forward with it.

[21:34] It's because the new movie didn't do as well as they thought.

[21:37] But that's just my guess that John Borg somewhere in a closet over at Stern Pimbal.

[21:43] There is an Indiana Jones fully designed game by John Borg that will never see the light

[21:48] of day.

[21:49] I love guessing stuff like this.

[21:50] I don't think we'll ever know if I'm right or wrong on this, but that's my guess people.

[21:54] All right, what else is going on on this Black Friday everybody?

[21:57] We covered Stern.

[21:58] We covered Spooky.

[21:59] I keep hearing these rumors that like Franchi is going to be on Spooky Pimbal's next game.

[22:04] Franchi is on Jersey Jack's games.

[22:06] Franchi's probably going to go somewhere where we don't have roads, ladies and gentlemen.

[22:11] And he's on all these company machines.

[22:13] The thing is the reason why he works, the reason why Franchi works on all these different

[22:18] games is the way he does his art.

[22:21] It takes the original art from all of these franchises and it just makes it better.

[22:27] It works really well.

[22:28] He needs source material.

[22:29] I don't think Galactic Tank Force is his best work.

[22:32] I don't think it's even close to his best work.

[22:34] Put Galactic Tank Force next to Godfather and Elton John and you can see what happens

[22:38] because Franchi's not a guy that can sit down at a blank piece of paper and illustrate

[22:44] something.

[22:45] He's not that kind of illustrator.

[22:47] He needs source material.

[22:50] When you give him source material, he can do wonders with it.

[22:53] But if you were to sit him next to an easel with a blank canvas and have him in Zambietti

[22:58] and say, hey, draw me Venom, he's not going to be able to do it.

[23:02] But that being said, lucky for him, every single IP out there, every single license

[23:07] out there has a plethora of source material for him to start with.

[23:12] So he's never going to be devoid of being able to create beautiful pinball machines

[23:17] if he's working with a licensed theme.

[23:19] The last thing he should make is an unlicensed game.

[23:22] Look at the play field on the Munsters people and put it next to Galactic Tank Force, which

[23:27] is mostly empty.

[23:29] Most of that play field is empty and it's just a gradient.

[23:32] It doesn't have much detail because, again, he's not going to be able to illustrate all

[23:37] of these different space features and tanks and characters.

[23:40] That's not what he does.

[23:41] Oh, there we go.

[23:42] Everybody thank you so much, everybody, for being a member of the Canada Club.

[23:46] And an extra special thanks to Mr. Steve Jablonski, still the only Canada Club member with $100

[23:53] a month donated to the show.

[23:56] Steve, thank you so much.

[23:57] For the rest of you that donate, you know you got a little bit more.

[24:01] You know you got a little bit more.

[24:02] I haven't given anybody a shout out for raising the roof recently.

[24:06] I think a lot of you are still at $5 a month.

[24:09] And look, if you love this show and you love what you're hearing, you know you can afford

[24:13] another $5 a month.

[24:15] I mean, go out in the world now.

[24:16] I mean, I went to the diner last night for dinner.

[24:18] We had our Thanksgiving meal at a diner, right?

[24:21] And I had like a bacon egg and cheese and a vanilla milkshake and we had a great time.

[24:25] And it was like $90 just to go to a diner in New York City.

[24:30] Everybody have a great day.

[24:31] We'll talk to you soon.

[24:33] Have a great weekend and we'll be back with tomorrow's Saturday morning spectacular.

[24:38] And if you haven't listened to the wormhole interview with Jamie, check it out.

[24:43] I thought it was awesome.

[24:44] I love those guys.

[24:45] I can't wait to go down there and put the worst scores on their machines.

[24:49] Everybody have a great day.

[24:50] And I'm going to be back with a new video.

[24:51] I'm going to be back with a new video.

[24:52] I'm going to be back with a new video.
