[00:00] In all my years of doing Canadian Spinball Podcasts and in all of the different interviews

[00:12] I've done over the years on this show.

[00:16] I do think this interview might just spark the most reaction from people and from the

[00:23] pinball community and I kind of feel like it's going to.

[00:27] So I really think you're going to enjoy listening to this a little bit over an hour interview

[00:34] with Robert Mueller over at Deeproot Pimble and Robert has done me the favor of spending

[00:41] an hour and answering all of the questions I had about Deeproot, about Raza, about what

[00:48] the future holds and I tried to capture what I think are the big questions on everyone's

[00:55] mind as we move into 2020 and as we sort of think about a world in which Deeproot Pimble

[01:03] machines will become available to consumers.

[01:07] Now you know Robert speaks his mind.

[01:09] You know he doesn't hold back when he's talking about Pimble companies and Pimble personalities.

[01:17] He kind of reminds me a little bit of myself at times in terms of not caring what anyone

[01:22] thinks is going to tell you how he feels.

[01:25] Now that doesn't mean I necessarily agree with his stances on everything and I do think

[01:31] the one big thing I would love to see Robert sort of turn a page on is you're going to

[01:36] have to sell to the people in the pinball community and on the forums right there's no reason

[01:41] why you have to go on the offensive against them but you know he sees it the way he sees

[01:47] it.

[01:48] And ultimately what all of us want to do is judge a man or woman because it's 2019

[01:55] by the game they make ultimately that is what should speak volumes for your company.

[02:02] It's the game you make and we've seen some of the game right it's a prototype but we've

[02:07] seen some of the game and as you hear a lot of the game is there so that game will be judged

[02:13] on its merits and when they're ready to show us the final package that's it.

[02:18] It's going to be either worth the hype or not worth the hype and we're going to be able

[02:24] to as consumers decide if this is worth it.

[02:29] If this if all the years were worth it if this is a company we want to support if this

[02:35] is a company that has done enough innovation to get your money have they brought enough

[02:40] value into the pinball world to warrant your hard earned dollars.

[02:46] And that tail is not done yet we are going to see more of what they have to offer come

[02:52] 2020.

[02:53] Okay so I think you're just going to like have to listen to this interview.

[02:57] Alright but before I air it I do need to wish an early birthday okay an early birthday

[03:03] to Paul who is a listener of the show now is going to do it on Thursday when his actual

[03:09] birthday is but Paul the reason why I'm not doing that right now is because I kind of

[03:13] just want to let this interview stay up for a while and let it simmer and let people

[03:18] listen to it but I'll say this Paul for your birthday I got you an interview with Robert

[03:23] Mueller from deep route and that Nicole she's awesome you have an awesome girl alright.

[03:29] So everybody enjoy this interview with Robert Mueller I am so sure it is going to spark

[03:35] conversation we will talk more about what is said on this interview at a later date.

[03:41] I don't like to talk after an interview with that I do with somebody because I don't

[03:46] think that's fair to do it right after the show like Robert and I finished talking and

[03:50] then I'm going to like do my summarization or summarize what he said now this is this

[03:55] is just the way it was no editing on this show no notes no nothing I just called him

[04:02] and we had an hour and 10 minute conversation and I'm going to play it for you right now.

[04:08] All right ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome back to Canada's pinball podcast a very

[04:12] special guest coming to the show after a very big moment for his company deep route pinball

[04:20] welcome Robert Mueller back to Canada's pinball podcast.

[04:23] Thanks Chris it's nice to be back and it's nice to be able to actually talk about some

[04:29] stuff now instead of you know kind of say that we know wait and see what's going to

[04:33] happen in the future so I'm looking forward to some great questions and maybe to clarify

[04:37] some things and I'm ready ready to go whenever you are.

[04:41] Yeah no I think the word that comes to mind for most of us is finally we get to talk about

[04:46] something of substance over words which is great and we're going to have a good time

[04:49] talking about it so I guess the first question I have for you Robert is just how does it

[04:53] feel to finally have something out there in the world even though it's a prototype we

[04:59] will we will confirm that but how does it feel to finally pull some of the curtain back?

[05:04] Well I think I have mixed feelings I think as the loser kid pinball podcast and one of

[05:10] my answers there was kind of real I think that I've been overwhelmed in being delayed by

[05:16] the time we launch in March of next year about a year and you know sometimes I struggle

[05:22] to find that passion still for pinball and I know that a lot of people inside the company

[05:27] have been wondering whether or not this year that we've been delayed will be worth it and

[05:33] can we can we succeed in the grand vision that we set out on and I think in some ways this

[05:39] last weekend was a big confidence booster that we can do it and that people will receive

[05:45] a low bill type of machine like what we had let alone what we plan to unleash in a couple

[05:52] months so it's day by day but I've got a lot of my play because pinball is one of just a

[05:58] few things that that I deal with on a daily basis and so I'm relieved but also I realize that

[06:04] we still have a long ways to go. Right so how is that been 2019 because we know at the beginning

[06:10] of the year there was a lot of excitement and would you say a little bit of overconfidence

[06:17] and the ability to get stuff to market in 2019? Yeah I know you love to continue to relive some of

[06:24] my comments from Chicago Expo 2018 and you know what look I've I've said a lot of brush things

[06:33] you know I as I said before I don't believe in the you know the phrase no regrets because there

[06:39] are you know regrets I truly wanted to do everything that I promised and my team expected

[06:45] of themselves and myself when we made those statements at Expo but at the end of the day someone had

[06:52] to take the bull by the horns and they had to make a hard business decision about whether to show

[06:59] before we were ready and it was tough we took a definitely a PR hit for it but I'm hoping that in

[07:06] time when people will get to enjoy what we've been working on and they can see why we deleted a

[07:11] year and all the benefits of that delay I think that in the end all will be forgotten by most and

[07:19] will will continue to make great pinball designs for the world. Let's talk about Houston because I

[07:25] know that was a big moment and and I know you guys struggled on whether or not it was too early to

[07:31] show we'll talk a little bit about that and timing when it comes to showing stuff before

[07:35] stuff's available to buy but as far as a show went Robert what kind of feedback did you get and

[07:41] have you been reading the feedback around your game on the forums?

[07:46] No when I left Penside in July it was probably the greatest thing that I've ever done in pinball

[07:53] this far it's an absolute sewer and I want nothing to do with it so any report I get from

[08:00] Penside immediately disregard however I will say that my team and there were quite a few

[08:06] deep root members there are so grateful for all the people who came to Houston and played the

[08:12] game and gave positive comments as well as constructive criticism and we've written all that down

[08:20] we're analyzing it and assessing it a lot of it is just because we didn't explain what

[08:25] Raza was what it was meant to be what it was not meant to be and because of its prototype state

[08:31] and what it will become some of the comments I think could be disregarded just for the fact that

[08:35] they're irrelevant and when the full package is seen that will become more evident but

[08:44] we're grateful for for those comments and it's nice to have those real concrete things in the

[08:49] world that people can now have constructive comments rather than assuming to know it right well

[08:57] and there's a mixture of comments and just because you know me I have to live on Penside or I don't

[09:01] have much content for the show there's a mixture of comments from those who have played the game

[09:07] at Houston right and so those people obviously have an advantage to share an opinion because they've

[09:12] actually played the game but we also know the forum loves to give feedback even if you've never

[09:17] played the game do you have you instructed though anyone on the deep root staff because people have

[09:24] and I'll say this Robert people have who played the game left some very detailed feedback and I

[09:30] think most of it is very positive so I think if you did take a peek you you would be pleasantly

[09:36] surprised that most people enjoyed playing the game at the show so does anyone is anyone trolling

[09:42] Penside on the deep root team they must I mean I know Dennis is on their Dennis Normans on there

[09:46] even in the thread I think and so is David I haven't heard from either one of them as to what they

[09:53] posted or what they saw I don't believe that anyone from the immediate team that I would normally

[09:59] get feedback is reading Penside I think that they feel pretty much the same way that most of the

[10:05] feedback is useless I have heard quite a few of the pinball shows and I think that right now without

[10:10] the proper frame of reference that I think a lot of the comments are all over the place and

[10:16] that a lot of what might be considered negatives are things that don't have perspective

[10:22] and assumptions are being made and I think on the other side of that there's a lot of positive

[10:26] comments I know there's two or three that I've heard that definitely I'm thinking about making

[10:32] some modifications to to the game for a final right yeah let's talk about that so what kinds of

[10:38] feedback did the deep root team at Houston receive was it you know what kind of things did you hear

[10:47] so I'm in Utah right now so I'm not in San Antonio where you know the team members are so I plan

[10:53] to get back there soon before the Thanksgiving break and get a more full report but from the comments

[10:59] that that I received over the weekend via you know email etc I think that a lot of the comments

[11:07] coming back were very positive I think that the machines basically kept up with the pace and

[11:16] and the pounding better than I ever expected and so I can't be happier to hear that most of the

[11:24] comments were hey we like this we like this why did you do this and things like that versus more

[11:30] negative things on hey I can't get up the ramp or you know it doesn't look like it has any

[11:35] innovations or you know this is way too there's not enough flow those those are just

[11:41] perspective issues that people don't really understand the the foundation of what Razzie is

[11:47] and what it's meant to be and I will completely understand and those because we haven't explained

[11:53] yet what Razzie is and what it's meant to be right now let's talk about the ramp just a little bit

[11:58] because that was I think it's one of the most visually stunning things in the game and we and J-pop

[12:05] when it comes to ramps only seems to try to push the envelope right of what's possible

[12:11] with a ramp and a pinball game and so I think the feedback was like the ramp is really cool it

[12:15] just became enough power to get up the ramp is that something with the show did you guys turn the

[12:22] power down at all on the flippers or were you testing different flipper powers or will it be easy

[12:28] for people to hit that ramp and go all the way to the top or is that is it supposed to be something

[12:32] where you only hit it you know maybe half the time yeah correct the purpose of the ramp is to be

[12:38] difficult this is not a flow game that all the other competitors keep force feeding down

[12:44] with family outs and and everything else this I let J-pop for the most part you know 80% of this

[12:51] is his passion his homage to a bunch of other games and to this weird quirky kind of narrative

[12:58] right and theme and so what we've done with him and with all of our other designers just try to

[13:05] stand out of the way and let them you know just pour their passion out in that theme on that

[13:10] plate field and take back those things and refine those things that really need to be refined

[13:16] the ramp has never been discussed internally it's supposed to be hard I know before both games

[13:22] left for Houston one ramp was a lot easier to make than the other and when asked whether I wanted

[13:29] the other one tweaked I said no because I wanted to get some real world data on on the difference

[13:36] and the tolerances and the problem with pinball is you right now as you typically have to talk about

[13:41] the location situation right I played the game and this was working and this wasn't working and we

[13:46] don't know if it was you know out of leveled or leveled it all and and you know this might have been

[13:51] broken and stuff and so what we want to do with deep root is we want to try to have the most

[13:55] consistent play amongst all their games and all different environments and so as a result

[14:02] I made the decision to keep those ramps at different tolerances to kind of understand

[14:08] even at full power in the flippers we're at full power the whole time what the shots would look

[14:15] like and whether you know one third success rate is good or whether we needed to make some

[14:22] adjustments and go for more a 50 or 60 percent but you know in house we've made the tolerances in

[14:28] in multiple levels to where you always make it and to where it's it's much more difficult

[14:33] and so because this game is a precision game at that end of the spectrum something that really

[14:39] hasn't been done a lot in recent years instead of a flow game we decided to keep the you know the

[14:46] foundation and purpose of the game a precision game meaning that it's not meant for a lot of

[14:51] beginners it's meant for people who have ball control and have to work to get that flow and work

[14:56] to to hit up that ramp into and to get the benefits because when you do believe me it is a satisfying

[15:02] feeling right and we heard that from people when they when they nailed it it was a very satisfying shot

[15:07] let me let me let me ask you about that though so you're in terms of who this game is designed for

[15:14] are you saying it's designed more for a pretty medium to good level pinball player or

[15:21] versus the novice he absolutely all of our games and today you know we went over the first 21

[15:27] games that we have planned over the next few years every game is going to be different it's going to

[15:32] be to a different demographic it's going to have a different theme different style different types of

[15:38] mix different play requirements it's going to have different rule sets and all of those things going

[15:45] into the deeper package the deeper portfolio and raza is just the first one that we've

[15:51] showed just because it was really the first one we took most of the way and so this is a jpop game

[15:58] it is very quirky it's weird it's whimsical it's not an easy shooter for let's say a beginner this is

[16:05] for someone who who can do some ball control and not just bat it away as most people do and can

[16:13] control the ball and create flow on their own and make shots when they need to make shots and

[16:18] the great thing about you know Steve Bowden in Quikton is that they've done a great job of creating

[16:25] some simple rules for you know when beginners do get on so they can feel satisfied and you know

[16:29] get the zombie and maybe get a multi ball etc and you know maybe three to five minute ball time

[16:34] but this game is really going to be the most satisfying by by intermediate or you know

[16:40] people have little ball control to advance tournament players that really can precision shoot a lot

[16:46] of these shots okay that's really interesting because we haven't really seen another company sort of

[16:54] openly designed a game for someone with a higher skill level but as you were saying so you said

[16:59] 21 titles I have to have to go back to that so how far along are you in development of those 21

[17:06] titles I mean that's a lot so when people hear that number are you guys is that like two three

[17:12] years down the road like how many titles a year I know Robert we I don't want to get trapped into

[17:18] like a number per year but like how far along are you with that many titles in development I would say

[17:24] 13 we're probably 50% or more and the others were probably 25 maybe as low as 10 to 15 but 25 to 50%

[17:35] we haven't sat around on our hands the last few years and just done Raza we've been very busy

[17:41] and I think that it's going to help make each of these titles that come out the best that they are

[17:48] for what they're meant to be right and we understand that's not going to come out just yet until

[17:53] launch and you know everyone can see why we're doing what we're doing but Raza has its special place

[18:01] right it's got a lot of history both positive and negative and so it was a great opportunity to

[18:07] have a J-pop theme like that finally see the light of day in a more final form and really get

[18:13] something that is more precision play than flow being tested on location and so we can really see

[18:19] that a harder game like this how are people going to approach it right what's the positive history

[18:25] on Raza if you don't mind me asking because it you know it just didn't really develop back of the day

[18:31] yeah I think Raza is a no-mosh I mean this this is J-pops as any designer would do and and have

[18:37] done before this is his homage to you know Asseler and like Hurricane and Cyclone to you know

[18:46] Zombie slash you know kind of 50s weird alien kind of homage that we've seen a little some other

[18:53] games like you know Tech from Mars etc this is just a quirky kind of J-pop on a plate

[18:59] sort of game and I can tell you I played it when it played like crap and I've played it where

[19:05] it plays more like better like what we showed in Houston and the game is fun to me you know

[19:11] I appreciate what J-pop puts into his games and the shots there and making me a better player by

[19:17] being more precision than flow because as I said before I kind of like flow but beginners like flow

[19:22] because it's easy it's mindless it's it's like you know playing game on your and Zombie out on

[19:26] your on your phone and this is more of a quirky precision shot type game and so I'd love different

[19:33] types of games that's why Williams Valley days with all the different designers and all the great

[19:37] themes and and elements and world underclass that are so beloved they're so different right is

[19:42] that each one was its own world its own game plan you stand over it you look at the inserts and

[19:47] the artwork and the and the lanes and the mechs and you go wow how am I going to approach this

[19:53] game versus the last game and so you know if you stand over Raza and see it for what it is right

[20:00] as a J-pop game a part of the Deeproot portfolio I think that you'll have a lot of appreciation for

[20:06] if you compare it to sort of what I consider the lackluster and thoughtless kind of titles

[20:11] that we've seen recently from from other competitors I think that you missed the point right

[20:18] that that's that's what we want to convey something yeah I want to what you just said I want to

[20:24] ask you a question about that because something that was said back in May was basically and I want

[20:31] to pull up I have the actual commentary but I just want to read it word for word because I just

[20:36] think it's interesting to compare what we saw at Houston to you said that you did not want to

[20:44] compete with other pinball manufacturers and turn out the outdated and uninspired pinball packages

[20:50] right as as seen in the market today and I know that you said that the prototype we would see

[20:56] is on par right with where company games are today right so I guess the question Robert is just

[21:03] is there going to be how are you going to sort of fill in the gap between this prototype

[21:09] and sort of delivering on that innovation and I think that leap forward people were expecting to see

[21:17] at Houston so is there going to be a big leap forward with the final product I think it's tough

[21:23] sometimes you know I will say that I promised a lot and I think over time a lot will be delivered

[21:31] and appreciated for what it is but the problem in pinball is it's dysfunctional and people sometimes

[21:38] lose the force for the trees there's a lot of it's sort of a microcosm of the greater age of

[21:44] outrage that we have in society as a whole and it's much more magnified in pinball and I'm sure

[21:52] there's going to be haters of deep roots haters of what we've designed and they don't think it's

[21:57] an innovative enough and I think that there will be other people who can't wait to pay money to

[22:04] have their homes grace by a different take on pinball and that's what we're about is it's

[22:09] completely different takeover fully of games so in a year from now after we've you know released a

[22:15] couple of games you can see sort of what we're doing I think that that's a great question to come

[22:19] back to and maybe see what you think and what how the pinball community thinks about how we're

[22:25] approaching both designing and creating a portfolio of of deeper games that each one

[22:32] or innovative in of itself but you know kind of come together as a as a very unique

[22:37] coach podge portfolio right something I said in one of my shows recently was this does feel and

[22:44] it is it's a J-pop game right and he's been working on this game for a while is it fair to say

[22:48] Robert that this game raza you guys you know you guys actually unraveled what's in John's mind and

[22:54] made a working game which is a miracle in itself if you followed the zid we're story would you

[23:00] is it fair to say that this is you know you sort of gave John a platform to to get a working game

[23:05] out there that has all of J-pop's quirkiness but this isn't the full representation of what deep

[23:12] root will be a year from now yeah I think it really depends it's sort of like you know when

[23:18] people equate my comments for Ferrari and you know a Pinto they they quit that with lowest price

[23:24] ever right they don't equate that with how I mint it and how I've you know continued to clarify

[23:29] where we talk about value at every level so I think in answer to your question here about J-pop

[23:35] and and and raza I think it really depends on how you define and how you look for innovation right

[23:42] the game as you saw it so on you know sort of the playful dark work which is not the final

[23:49] playful dark work and definitely the cabinet artwork is was just placeholder most of the max most

[23:55] of the layout is 95% complete and so when we talk about innovations it might not be hey there's

[24:01] this groundbreaking thing that's on the playfield and it's never been seen before because there's

[24:05] maybe one or two on there it's sort of the whole world right it's putting these homage and all

[24:11] of these things that were unique on all these other games together in one playable package

[24:17] an experience this user experience is what we're after rather than rather than talking about

[24:23] innovations now one of the innovations that we're talking about will be internal will be

[24:27] aesthetically looking in the cabinet and will be how deeper games are are used for decades to come

[24:35] those types of innovations were not on this package were not on display in Houston

[24:40] but as far as raza the game is concerned 95% of what you saw less the artwork and toys will be in

[24:47] the final raza cabinet gotcha and so the the cabinet itself and is that the deep root cabinet or

[24:57] now that is not the deeper cabinet it's something that was we wanted to do to be familiar

[25:05] though i do like because they did the sylon looking you know kind of grill

[25:10] because they know i'm in the battle star galactica and i thought it looked really really sexy

[25:16] but it would not make our final deeper package okay if we ever released a package like this it

[25:25] would be a lower end model that would be stripped down for for price only well and that's the thing

[25:32] i've been calling people you know me on my show i call everybody suckers on the show but i've

[25:36] been calling people crazy for thinking this thing a j pop game which i've always looked at j pop

[25:41] games as sort of works of art that are playable that are like to your point just kind of quirky

[25:49] different and it's it's j pop like it writes hard to even explain uh but he was you know these

[25:54] games were selling for a lot of money when he was only making a hundred raza's and we know magic

[25:59] grow was selling for sixteen thousand are are people way out of bounds when they think this

[26:05] thing's gonna come in at the price of a stern pro or lower i think that um i i'm frustrated um

[26:16] i i understand how some people um kind of viewed my comments about value to mean that we're

[26:24] gonna sell all of our games for three thousand bucks which is why i've continued to clarify that

[26:31] it's it's about value rather than price right and i've frustrated that our game at Houston in the

[26:38] shape it was was likely uh had more value in it than a fifteen thousand dollar you know Elvira

[26:46] signature edition and maybe with some touch ups uh a collector's edition wonka and so for people to

[26:53] say well it's not gonna be worth anything unless um you know it's it's it's priced as a stern pro

[27:00] i think is a problem because we have had for years now penball consumers throw crazy amounts of

[27:08] money for no value at all and yet they expect deeper to put all of this value in there and expect us

[27:15] to to to cheap it in now right and then we're not we don't we're not deserving of charging more money

[27:21] and so it puts us in a very difficult position of how we approach uh marketing and how we approach

[27:26] pricing uh and and our competitors in determining what we're going to do uh at the end of the day

[27:33] right and so um i'm personally going to make that decision and i'm digesting how penball consumers are

[27:40] are using their money and i'm gonna make a decision about uh about what they're doing and what we're

[27:45] doing and you know where the competition is and and where those price points are gonna be at the end of

[27:50] the day right let me i want to give you a little advice because i think it would help i do think

[27:57] a lot of your buyer base might be on the forum uh of pinside because they are the enthusiasts and

[28:03] the collectors as well because that's the other question i have is we see games and you brought up

[28:08] Elvira now i've been slamming Elvira signature edition for a really long time right people paid

[28:12] five thousand dollars more and got nothing in the game and yet it sells out in in a few hours and

[28:18] it it it almost it almost leads me to believe that pinball buyers and collectors don't deserve much

[28:23] if they run after that stuff so as you're looking at it Robert one of the i think key factors in

[28:30] sort of figuring out where you price a game is how many of the games you make right so in your mind

[28:38] are you thinking about this jpop game as a mass market game or as a game that you'll keep limited

[28:45] and almost like a special rare thing for the discerning jpop collector out there how are you

[28:52] envisioning volume in terms of how you might price it so um in this respect i'm going to keep

[28:59] some things close to my chest uh and wait for the reveal because there'll be a more meaningful

[29:06] marketing plan and why we're going to price in in editions that we might have and you know uh in

[29:12] each of these titles uh as we get there but i'll answer it this way um i think that each title

[29:21] has its own purpose in this world and it has its own audience and its own consumer base and um

[29:28] something like a jpop game which uh has a lot in it i think should be priced accordingly

[29:34] um and what we're trying to do um is we're trying to price things according to the value they bring

[29:42] in the grand scheme of the entire market and so there will be some games that will be priced very

[29:48] high um and we'll see if the market is receptive to that and if not then we'll we'll make adjustments

[29:54] and we might price things well under market and we'll have to raise the price just because we won't

[29:58] be able to keep up with uh you know supply with demand but as far as you know as as what you're going

[30:03] into as what you're you know discussing as far as how we view pricing and value uh in in the grand

[30:11] scheme of things um it's hard for it's hard for me to to say any more about that given how pinball

[30:19] consumers are actually spending their money right now because it is counterintuitive and it's very

[30:24] difficult to to to make that decision right now without getting a few months down the road and

[30:29] seeing if they're going to continue to spend their dollars in the same way that they have been the

[30:33] last half of this year right now and we talk a lot on this show about the hype window right and

[30:40] and you've you must watch how stern does it how jersey jack does it how spooky does it everyone has

[30:47] a different approach in in terms of how to create that sort of feeding frenzy uh when a game becomes

[30:53] available for sale and so i'm i'm just curious to see how you guys do it uh be happy to talk off a

[30:59] lot in robber to and give you some some of my thoughts on it because i do think this jpop game

[31:05] you i think you're right i think it's a unique game that has a unique target and it's not

[31:10] necessarily a mass market game um and i think if you hit the right target with the right amount

[31:16] of games at the right price it becomes something special in the pinball world versus something that's

[31:22] just you know there's too many of them and then it doesn't feel like you have to get one and then

[31:26] all of a sudden you're like dead on arrival with with with with the game reveal um question for you

[31:32] so what was the decision to put raza in front of magic girl we have something very special plan for

[31:39] magic girl and um the the time and the money that it's going to take to accomplish that

[31:49] doesn't make sense in the early uh launch months of deeper pinball and so and the same goes for

[31:57] Alice in Wonderland and so um raza became an easy um an easy first option along with a couple of

[32:06] other titles to to start with for that very reason and um you're right i mean i don't think that

[32:14] we're gonna launch raza and sell you know thousands of raza's you know that's just just not

[32:19] gonna happen it is it is a more niche game but it's going to be a beloved game by enough um pinball

[32:25] consumers to you know to profit and pay for the development time of it and to move on to the next

[32:31] title right uh some of which to the very first titles will be uh very large volume sellers okay and

[32:38] so um it's not lost on us that raza is a very unique start and it's not meant to

[32:46] launch you know deeper and suddenly make us you know profitable and pay back all the years of

[32:50] rd it's not what it's meant to do right question about the game in terms of do will there be multiple

[32:59] tiers of raza or one version all of our games will have one to three versions okay but it will

[33:08] be different than what any of the other competitors um uh are doing right now in what way to think

[33:14] right wait wait now we have like the pro premium le model right you've got the pro which strips

[33:18] stuff out you've got the premium le which is normally the same game with with just cosmetic

[33:24] differences so you're saying you'll take a different approach to that if you have three tiered

[33:30] yeah each title will be treated differently and some of them we might just have one uh tier and some

[33:36] of them we might have up to three tiers but the tiers i think uh and i hope will be seen as a more

[33:43] fair and valued approach um to people on deciding which of those might might be there with like a two

[33:49] and three tier one wait you might actually give us like unique code inside a game that costs

[33:54] three thousand more i think that that would be the simplest and easiest and most fair for us to do

[34:01] i think that there will be a lot more that will be involved in giving pinball consumers value upon

[34:07] value more than they could have ever imagined right and the most important question uh for in 2019

[34:12] will there will there be a topper included with raza or part of the raza package there might be

[34:19] a tier of raza that would have a topper that i absolutely flipped out when i saw the engineering

[34:26] model of awesome flip down positive way yeah yeah no we need toppers so robert you talk a lot about

[34:32] and and i know we're probably going to see more of this but the innovation happening underneath the

[34:39] game that we haven't seen yet are are are what can we expect are these games going to be easier to

[34:44] service are they going to be more reliable is it are we going to have to can we put the soldering

[34:49] iron away forever like any yeah already you can tell me without spoiling your your reveal i

[34:56] yeah all of the above and i i said this in a recent uh interview is that when i first got my

[35:01] Williams Valley collection i had tons of questions about why this why that why is it so hard

[35:08] how do i need to learn how to solder vertically uh why does this keep breaking why to leave switch

[35:13] a suck you know um and and don't work even if they're brand new uh why is this you know type of

[35:21] mech used why why is this unreliable most of the time why does this machine at at my house play

[35:28] like this but i go to my office and play the same title and it can place you know place completely

[35:33] different i think all of these frustrations and observations that i had and and in working with

[35:39] you know benthack and charlie and jay pop uh in denis and and grec ferris in the early years and

[35:45] talking with them about their thoughts uh and stuff um helped me over time get to the point where we

[35:52] started uh in 2017 with a deeper package plan uh that went from thoughts and innovations high

[36:00] in the sky you know pie in the sky sort of stuff to actually a real business plan that we've been

[36:05] working on for years and while it's a mystery uh there were a lot of innovations in those two games

[36:11] in houston that people did not see and will not see that we needed to test we needed to really see

[36:17] are these going to be at the level that deeper uh in our warranty and how we back games are they

[36:24] going to be there and i can only say that that the feedback i got was everyone was just you know blown

[36:30] away with how well things stood up we have some you know action points that we need to continue to

[36:35] work on a refine of the next few months but we're really happy about it right um let's talk lighting

[36:42] so i heard some feedback that the games were a little bit dark at houston will the deep route

[36:47] cabinets will they address the the lighting things we hear all the time in this hobby right how you

[36:53] know i it's amazing that pinstadium has such a big business model going on

[36:58] how easy it seems to to light up a cabinet with with an led strip what are we going to see unique

[37:03] lighting in the deep route platform yeah that was the first one of the first things that i i put

[37:09] into the deep group package years ago um and uh it's one of many things um that that just

[37:15] comprise the package that we've tried to do standard to try to improve the user experience

[37:21] okay and the artwork on raza now we i thought we were going to see just like a white wood with like

[37:30] mechs on it i i didn't even think we'd get as much as we got at houston so who's doing the art

[37:35] package for raza yeah all of the art animations done by uh the very talented um folks up in Utah

[37:44] that uh are in deep route studios okay and uh the artwork that we got from uh Matthew and

[37:50] Jeremy uh was was pretty much a hack job and so as we re looked at the narrative uh for raza

[37:57] specifically um we basically took out what wasn't working uh from a 2d perspective on the play

[38:04] field and reinserted the new narrative and characters etc and we did the same with a lot of the

[38:10] artwork that matt did uh Matthew did and um touched it up created you know additional artwork

[38:18] that needed to be there and believe it or not internally raza artwork is a complete hack job

[38:23] because because of that but i think that most people as i saw and i think that i would personally

[38:29] my personal opinion would be it's still better than any other animations that's ever been on a

[38:33] pinball machine um and so um where we've continued to refine the raza package uh you know i

[38:40] my favorite of the three artwork um packages that we have behind the scenes right now is called

[38:46] nebula uh that's the that's the you know the the rnd name for it and i really love it and i think

[38:53] that um some other people like um one of our other types of artwork um and so it's going to be very

[39:01] interesting coming down because i'm very much against uh using artwork to sell pinball machines um

[39:07] and so the question is are we going to allow and offer multiple artwork packages um four can

[39:14] for customers or not and that's something that's still up in the air and we'll probably make a

[39:19] decision on that right before launch um but we have some great art packages to look at the one

[39:24] that was seen at houston was a very early edits uh that was done back in two thousand uh in the end

[39:31] of two thousand seventeen so it is something to to put on there to kind of get some basic uh ideas

[39:38] about what's on the play field as far as art but there has been a lot more refinement of

[39:44] that artwork and the plastics around it well what do you mean a hack job though because people did

[39:49] really like the the zombie Eddie work that he did i know i know the big issue was like there's a lot

[39:54] of ipn fringe mint you had robby the robot you had the attack from ours you had godzilla was on the

[39:59] i think on you know on the play field and and cabinet artwork you just mean like the quality we're

[40:04] going to see is it going to be above and beyond that um well i think you saw some of the early

[40:11] changes that we made um to the to jermies our package right uh on the play field and jermies

[40:20] a great 2d artist um and um with with strong lines and stuff like that and so what we tried to do

[40:27] was uh and all that he made tried to pay homage to what he started but um changed the world and

[40:34] the narrative as we needed to do to as we continue to develop the rosa world okay now interesting so

[40:40] you're saying there you guys are actually considering there might be an opportunity for a consumer

[40:45] this has never been done before to actually pick possibly the play field artwork that goes on the

[40:50] machine they order i think there's going to be a lot of customizations that uh consumers will

[40:58] will have with deeper the deeper package okay um very cool i mean that hasn't been done before

[41:06] in terms uh i guess you know probably the main reason is when it comes to ordering parts which is

[41:11] something have you run into that because i think the big issue the the next big question is

[41:15] manufacturing right i mean it's always the it's always the elephant in the room when it comes to

[41:20] launching a pinball company at what stage robber do you have to tell people pencils down we now

[41:26] need to transition into how do we manufacture these or have you been planning for manufacturing

[41:31] all along that you won't run into the same issues that other companies have when it's come to

[41:38] manufacturing pinball machines yes i answered uh in a recent interview the same question so let me

[41:44] let me make two points about that uh in reed or eight first manufacturing always has the same

[41:50] foundational issues right and those dealing with inventory and problems you didn't expect and

[41:56] problems you did and waste and labor and and cost and delays and all of those things are always

[42:01] going to be there we can try to minimize them by using mini uh engineering pipeline and manufacturing

[42:08] processes or theories or or stuff like that um that aside uh that every manufacturer has to do with

[42:18] we are from the beginning um and everything we've done try to

[42:24] so we use you know the the step gate process and a lot of what we do from an engineering standpoint

[42:30] what we try to do is look at as we go through the gates um what is going to be required for manufacturing

[42:39] going through the analysis of how it will look what will be there what do we need to minimize

[42:45] how do we need to design something now to minimize uh for instance waste and and other complications

[42:51] and inventory problems so all of that has been doing all this time through all these years

[42:56] uh talking about the entire process and while i've had fun with quad manufacturing and octo

[43:00] manufacturing and stuff like that um uh it doesn't take away from the real work we've been doing

[43:06] behind the scenes to try to minimize um some of those very real and very common things that

[43:13] happen in the in the manufacturing process okay now when does is manufacturing set up right now

[43:20] or when do you expect to give it a test run right at what point do you actually have to get the line

[43:26] going and and get all of those people who are going to be building these games uh you know making them

[43:32] to see if you guys can do it in in in a timely manner i think that's top because a lot of what we've

[43:38] done even including you know building the games for Houston we've been testing out different assembly

[43:44] and manufacturing techniques uh we've been timing things we've been making notes of what's working

[43:50] and what's not working uh we're we're refining engineering uh and uh you know because for

[43:56] manufacturing line you typically have to boil down the instructions to a fourth grade level

[44:01] for especially for the assembly process we've been doing that to make sure that we could get bay

[44:05] to align worker you know what needs to be done what tolerances are okay and what's not okay

[44:11] what's special with this game that we know is a problem going into the manufacturing process that

[44:15] needs special attention uh an extra you know tenderloven care and so all of these things we've been

[44:20] doing along the way so some of our assembly and some of our heavy manufacturing is already set up

[44:26] and we're testing and we're refining things and some of it is not and i think as we turn the year

[44:33] and start to finalize a lot of those things so start to uh run um consistency and tolerance

[44:40] tests through a line we're gonna find out really quick uh and be able to what's working what's

[44:45] not working in the final kind of approach and start to make those um those edits but it i'm not uh

[44:56] uh deluding myself that we will not through the end of 2020 continue to refine the manufacturing process

[45:04] and deal with problems both that we can catch in the house and even things that might go into

[45:09] you know consumers uh houses and trying to refine that process and make it better and better

[45:15] and that's what we're about is delivering the best valued product um that's consistent and

[45:22] built well for decades to come to the consumers and we're going to work very hard to make sure that

[45:26] happens and as my comments about playfills have been very clear where i stand on that um we're

[45:32] going to back it up with uh with uh with our pledge and in our money in our time

[45:39] so the the sledgehammer comment oh no no no Chris we need to go to jackhammers now jackhammers

[45:45] not getting that but but you said it but you also said recently it is made out of wood so

[45:51] okay i'm trying to figure out how this is going to work uh i think i think a lot of the playfields

[45:56] and clear code issues that have come up i think there's been some some crazy comments by people who

[46:01] thought they were experts and i think that there's been actually some very thoughtful um comments that

[46:06] have come out and i think that uh both the type of wood the age of the wood um the type of wood

[46:13] or substrate being used how it's processed prior to the clear code how the clear code is processed and

[46:20] what type of clear code and and how uh you know um well i'm not going to go into any more detail and give

[46:26] away some of our secrets but um and then how how that's cured and in the time to consumer uh

[46:34] we're simply and then to consumer all of those things play into it it's not like it's one thing

[46:39] it is a grand recipe that's why you could have a thousand people you know payka chocolate cupcake

[46:45] and all of them will taste slightly different some will be better than others um because it's

[46:51] it's the entire ingredients that go together and are then baked into a luscious cupcake right now are

[46:58] are you guys making your playfields or are you outsourcing to someone who you feel confident can

[47:04] deliver uh you know the the most premium product when it comes to playfields because that's been a huge

[47:08] issue for people in 2019 that has people holding on to their money so okay first um

[47:16] confused by consumers who continue to uh be outraged by it yet continue to spend money on it um

[47:24] i understand they don't have a lot of other options at this point uh but still it's not like you have

[47:28] to go out and just uh let money you know burn a hole in your pocket and just blow it um when you have

[47:34] and you will have a lunch banner option to go to so on the one hand i'm kind of confused by that

[47:39] is i study you know the market and consumer you know psychology and and why they're doing what

[47:43] they're doing but on the other hand um we're determined um to to live by the standard that we're

[47:51] setting and by by using what because wood is still the best in my opinion the only real option

[47:58] for a a pinball playfield surface and we're going to continue to to refine that in house to make

[48:04] sure that when we put a good warranty on it and we take a hammer to it um and of course i was

[48:09] joking about you know the sledgehammer and the jackhammer but even a hammer to it to show

[48:14] how we've developed and engineered our playfield to withstand those common things that you're

[48:19] going to get with every other competitor by doing it in house whereas before we were going to go

[48:24] with Mirko i'll just be honest with it but after the the latest fiasco i i just can't i can't trust

[48:30] and it's not just Mirko right i know he's trying and he's got a really nice process set up and you

[48:36] know it's just it's a it's a whole recipe of of issues but we can't we can't let that happen

[48:42] with deep root it's got to be brought in house it's got to be done right and you know Sean Gibson who

[48:49] is you know one of my greatest assets uh has spent years um thinking and developing and testing how

[48:57] we're going to do this and many of the options he's brought to me all with Stan Hammer strike

[49:03] in fact when we got the Mirko boards and one of them was at Houston uh they pulled them out and

[49:08] you could still smell the clear and i said give me a hammer and i took a hammer to it and oh my goodness

[49:14] it was the crater it was just a crater i mean there there was no there was no missing it

[49:19] and so um i then took out one of Sean's uh test playfields and slammed it with a hammer and

[49:26] not a dipt you couldn't even see that i hit it are we never going to have dimples on a deep root game

[49:32] uh well what's funny is you could basically draw our test is and i don't know what's exact

[49:37] height it's a couple of inches but that's the equivalent of the greatest force that could come down

[49:42] with a pinball as it slaps against the glass or something else on the thing and i can tell you

[49:47] from the first time we plunged a ball on the Mirko boards are you you plunge it on a spooky game

[49:53] a stern game an ap game or anything you're going to get instant dimples and or jgp game etc um and

[50:00] with our playfields uh tests we we basically with hammer don't even get a dimple we don't get a scratch

[50:08] we don't get a scuff we don't get anything and that's the type of deeper quality that we want to

[50:12] provide i think that's i think that's music to everyone's ears and it's it's amazing to me how

[50:19] so much because you know this robert people collect these things and they spend a lot of money on them

[50:23] and as you talk about the value proposition uh having a playfield that's not going to fall apart

[50:29] in front of your eyes sometimes right out of box for some of these new games coming out has been

[50:35] no no Chris it's worse than that i guarantee you pull any manufacturer right now whether they're

[50:40] doing it in house or not and he drop a ball from three inches which is probably less than what the

[50:47] strongest strike could be every one of them will dimple and i'm sorry that's an engineering defect

[50:53] and deep bridge is not going to put up with that and we're just going to be different and we'll

[50:57] let them continue to to turn those playfields out whether they do them in house or whether they

[51:01] you know try to engineer better and we hope they do but deep room will be different and i'm

[51:06] baking my company uh on those those types of values and quality propositions for consumers and

[51:13] then ball robert do you do you feel like you have your George Gomez over at deeper like the

[51:18] the guy that's sort of seeing all these moving parts and and has experience knowing what it takes

[51:25] to sort of foresee the hurdles in pinball and is just keeping everything going i think i have a lot

[51:31] of different types of people i mean i think that i know you've mentioned it and other people kind of

[51:37] see that there's there's one or two people that that basically have to keep the ship you know

[51:44] formation at the tight you know and what i find and it's very difficult in my and what i do is

[51:51] i get everyone in a formation then i look the other direction and they've come out of formation and

[51:56] i get them back in formation i look back at where i was and they've come it's a constant yo-yo and

[52:02] you know i i'm not going to take credit for for much in deep route because i have an amazing

[52:07] staff of people in texas and in utah and contractors across the country that do an amazing job

[52:14] but at the end of the day there has to be the captain there has to be the someone that that

[52:20] understands the buck stops here that is willing to say no and is willing to say yes and is

[52:26] basically there to to motivate people and to threaten people right and to challenge people and to

[52:33] reward people and that at this point has has landed on my desk and sometimes it's very difficult

[52:40] and sometimes it's very easy but it doesn't take away from the very talented people at

[52:46] in every aspect of a deeper tech and deeper pinball and deeper studios that are pounding out

[52:51] amazing things on a daily basis and that have passion and that are there you know to create the best

[52:58] pinball experience ever created for for the pinball community right so how are how are the investors

[53:05] feeling right now are they are they on board for the long run because it's been longer than there are

[53:10] no investors in pinball and this this is what i mean i just let people just spout off right nobody

[53:16] understands how we work and and the more they try to act like they're the experts on everything

[53:22] the the more i laugh because the the more wrong and ass and nine they sound so there there are no

[53:28] investors in pinball it's it's it's company money it's it's my money and you know i find that

[53:36] you know even when people say well oh my gosh you know they're blowing all this a month and

[53:40] they're never going to be able to make it back and i just i just laugh because it's obvious that

[53:45] the more they try to convince themselves and others about all of this the the less they they're

[53:50] in reality there's some other universe and you know at the end of the day it's not their money right

[53:56] right Robert a year from now what do you hope people think and feel about deep root pinball

[54:03] um i hope that the people who want to care um can see that we came through and we delivered some

[54:12] amazing experiences very different unique experiences but but experiences and um that they're

[54:19] excited about uh everything new that we bring to the market um that we're not going to come out with

[54:25] the same experience over and over again uh then everything will be fresh everything will be new

[54:31] and um but at the core is that value and that quality that we want to keep for decades to come

[54:38] and in terms of the other designers who can you tell us whose game we might see next after jpop

[54:47] yeah i think that i want to be fair to all the designers because all of their games are very

[54:53] unique to to that designer right uh and all of them want their games out there and they want the

[54:58] praise and the law etc um that comes with it and you know everyone interested from the beginning

[55:04] that jpop scheme would be first and um but they're all different right john norris still works for

[55:10] another company and he's still you know just does pinball in uh in his spare time and so as a result

[55:17] you know there might not be as much coming from john norris uh denna store and min has some great

[55:21] designs coming uh i know he really wants them to see the light of day and they will very shortly

[55:26] and you know aselars just a machine i mean if he if i let him lose he could create a pinball

[55:31] machine design every month so he's he's more of a machine and just gets the basics right and you

[55:38] know it's just it feels like berry right um jpop the same i mean it takes him a lot longer he's working

[55:44] on two other titles right now um that are not magic girl or alison wonderland uh one's a licensed

[55:49] title once not and they're they're just classic jpop and so all of these these different passions and

[55:57] and personalities that that we saw back in the great william bali days i want to bring back i want

[56:03] there to be very unique titles that that don't look like each other right there they they speak to

[56:10] that designers dreams and goals uh with that theme right you know you talked a little bit about in

[56:15] 2019 there's a little bit of a period of you you've started this thing right you've you've

[56:20] you've decided to make a pinball company um and there is there was that period of maybe anxiety

[56:27] of can we get this all done and i know you still have a road to go to get the game to production

[56:33] how do you feel now do you feel remotivated coming out of houston and you feel good that you're

[56:38] going to get those deadlines hit for for 2020 i think right now robert you're saying a march reveal

[56:44] and then sometime shortly after they'll be rozz is available to buy at a minute yes um i don't know

[56:54] if i'm remotivated i know a lot of my employees are um this that it wasn't the only thing because

[57:00] there were a lot of other reasons why we did houston uh instead of you know either backing out of it

[57:04] or not doing it and just waiting to launch but i think one of the biggest the most important things

[57:09] as as the captain as a commander i needed to show uh my troops a win and and this was a win uh

[57:16] internally and morale is is is really high in texas right now and um and they they deserve all the

[57:24] praise in the world for for pounding it out and meeting a deadline and showing off something i

[57:29] think that just blew off most people's socks even if they don't want to admit it and so for me

[57:36] i think it's a little different for me it's the first of many steps to come and i feel relieved

[57:41] because there were a million things that could have gone wrong um you know and i'm not worried about the

[57:47] the you know the crappy videos and the color problems because it was not meant to to be any of that right

[57:54] and you know i i know i i did watch a couple of them and then we're at the greatest and you know a lot

[57:59] of them were just batting the ball around and not you know showing it did i i look at you know

[58:03] texas and he did a great job he's good player he showed what rosa could really be if you if you

[58:09] have some good ball control on his facebook you know video post and you know for me that was

[58:14] that was a win right he understood uh and other people who played it and we heard that feedback

[58:19] understood what they were doing what they understood what the concept of rosa was and

[58:24] that was more precision and and knew how to approach it and so for me it was a relief because

[58:29] there was a million things that could have gone wrong but they didn't uh we accomplished all of our

[58:34] goals and even more i got a re-energized team but we've got a couple months till we show the world

[58:39] what we're going to do and um we're going to pick up on this excess and we're going to have another

[58:44] one and another one after that and another one after that and so relief is it is really what i

[58:49] feel right now does does rosa go back in the bag now are we going to see it out on location again

[58:55] being tested over the next few months you know that's a good question to be honest with you i

[59:01] i had never thought about it i hadn't intended to put it out um but um we might um i don't know i

[59:09] think we got all of the the data testing and feedback that we really wanted so i don't see that

[59:14] there's any benefit from doing that um but um i don't know that that's a good question

[59:21] i mean you can you can send one to New York i'll happily put it in my bedroom um

[59:26] Robert you know i thank you for taking the time we're we're right up upon the hour and i know that

[59:30] this has been a long road i know there's still some road to go before getting

[59:35] games out there walk us through what's next so the the plan is to have a a sort of media

[59:45] event in deeproot auditorium right before tpf correct that's correct now is that the beginning

[59:52] of some have speculated and i have to ask you as a marketer is that the beginning are those going

[59:57] to be five days of deeproot starting in the middle of the week going through that sunday

[01:00:03] uh i i think we will still have five days of deeproot uh i think that um it's very observant

[01:00:11] i think when i've talked to ed about tpf and unsure about whether we wanted to show up whether

[01:00:16] we wanted to launch around there it became more and more evident that we did not want to launch at tpf

[01:00:22] right um we i know you're gonna you're gonna laugh as most people were look i i have a lot of

[01:00:28] criticisms of our competition but i know how hard pinball can be behind the scenes and i respect them

[01:00:33] and all the artists and and the designers and the people who put so much work and effort

[01:00:40] and recently eternally i'd apologize to some of my employees because we we hired someone who

[01:00:45] was a long time stern staffer and you know i made a comment during an internal meeting about

[01:00:52] about one of the machines he had a mech and and i realized that sometimes you know i kind of

[01:00:57] get away with myself and and i forget that you know all the hardships and the struggles and the

[01:01:03] even the successes we've had internally are are i've been shared by companies who have failed

[01:01:08] and companies that still exist and so at the end of the day um i'm i'm gonna continue to to

[01:01:13] criticize where i see see problems but i also have to at the at the end of the day also respect the

[01:01:19] the good things and the right things that a lot of these other manufacturers are doing so our

[01:01:23] launch events um and marches delay out the vision the plan okay and um and tpf just happens to be

[01:01:32] uh uh uh you know i seem on the cake that we get to go out and everyone just gets to just have fun

[01:01:39] and relax and and just uh just enjoy the events rather than creating uh you know a launch at the

[01:01:46] event and and being under that pressure right well Robert let me ask you because i think if

[01:01:51] someone listens to this and and i personally love your brazen candid no no no no holds bar to

[01:01:58] approach to talking about your company but you know it might not seem necessary to go on the attack

[01:02:07] with the competition and just you know make your own amazing game and let it speak for yourself but

[01:02:10] what types of stuff are you impressed when you look at a stern pinball or a jersey jack pinball

[01:02:16] are there things about those companies that you are impressed by and that might be worth emulating

[01:02:22] a little bit because they you know especially stern who's probably shipping 10,000 plus games a year

[01:02:27] what what types of stuff does stern do that you think is is good yeah so let me let me

[01:02:34] preface that by i've paid stern tens of thousands of dollars for games i've paid jersey jack tens

[01:02:40] of thousands of dollars for games and i've paid spooky tens of thousands of dollars for games

[01:02:45] and so i've supported each of these manufacturers and as a personal customer and most of my opinions

[01:02:52] i've tried to frame when it comes to my experience with their machines as a as a customer of theirs

[01:02:59] uh you're right there's been some things that i've i've had fun with i mean all of these games

[01:03:04] are played either at my house or at one of our two locations by our employees and loved right

[01:03:09] and they're also heavily hated and criticized for many of the very things that we're trying to

[01:03:14] solve in our deep brew package so it's not like where we're just you know spouting off and and

[01:03:20] taking cheap shots we're we're gonna walk the walk and i think that most of what we're going to

[01:03:25] show on our launch day is going to be point after point after point after point where we saw a

[01:03:32] weakness or something that the competition refused to fix or do and we're doing it because it

[01:03:37] needs to be done and so um at the end of the day you're right i take i take some shots at them and

[01:03:43] i think some of them they they write out deserve but at the end of the day i've also put my money

[01:03:49] where my mouth is by spending a lot of time fixing those problems and also spending time supporting

[01:03:53] those companies and you know one of these days i hope you know some of those companies might support

[01:03:58] deeper and and buy a game from us if even if they don't i'm still gonna buy their games for the

[01:04:02] games that makes sense and one of your recent interviews you talked about licensing of your

[01:04:09] innovations and have you guys filed patents for things that you think other pinball companies

[01:04:15] are gonna see and want to license from you guys i think you know at the beginning that when you

[01:04:21] talk about almost 200 innovations as you break them down um it's just not legally possible just

[01:04:27] just lock it all up so i think over time what we've done is looked at okay what what would make the

[01:04:32] most sense to lock down right and not try to be litigious and and the things that are going to be

[01:04:39] the greatest competitive advantage to us that we would not want a competitor copying or

[01:04:44] we're doing something similar and i think that you know when you boil those down this probably down

[01:04:49] to you know five ten fifteen patents it really depends how how you break them down um and when we

[01:04:56] talk about licensing those i think you know i look i i try to get Charlie and and Scott before they

[01:05:02] release tna to kind of think about what we were doing it didn't work out and you know tna is great

[01:05:06] i bought a tna we've had a lot of problems with it um and you know we've spent a lot of time fixing

[01:05:13] it and stuff like that but at the end of the day Scott and Charlie did did an awesome thing they

[01:05:17] they took a white wood that was pretty awesome they refined it you know Charlie got it out and

[01:05:22] fulfilled all those orders and and kudos to them and i i put my money wherever i have this i bought one

[01:05:26] right um and so as we look at this process um we want to uh continue to to look at those things as

[01:05:34] well and and take care of them right what internet connectivity is something that just keeps

[01:05:40] seeming like it's a it's a it's like innovation even though everything we have in our lives is

[01:05:45] internet connected is that going to be part of the deep root package yeah i think that and so many

[01:05:51] things that people go why wasn't that done before that just makes so much sense i think those are

[01:05:55] things we had years ago and while there have been some competitors and you're going to see that

[01:06:00] on launch day that might have beat us to the punch i think that um our approach to it um i think will

[01:06:07] be a better approach and it will make more sense in a package of features rather than just this or

[01:06:13] that right if if you had to buy one new game today amongst what's currently available i know you

[01:06:20] you're a player and a collector robert and you enjoy pinball who do you think is making the most

[01:06:27] fun games right now or like what's the best game you've played recently that at least you

[01:06:32] fall you enjoyed even though you might want to change stuff in this now but what what game

[01:06:38] do you say to your designers and like this is fun like let's capture the fun of this game but we

[01:06:43] can do better with innovation yeah that's a hard one uh i don't know uh if i have the time to get out

[01:06:51] and play a lot of the more recent games like wonka i've not played um i i bought uh every other

[01:06:58] jjp game so i probably one of these days will buy a wonka um you know of course i as i said i

[01:07:03] already bought tna we have two batman 66s that look like the you know the moon unfortunately but

[01:07:11] they play well um it is hard um to talk about some of the others i i've heard lots of great things

[01:07:19] about Jurassic Park i've not been able to play it um i i i really haven't bought a lot of

[01:07:24] stones uh i really have been really motivated by a lot of what they've done and impressed by a lot

[01:07:30] of what they've done to to really go out and and buy it i mean some of the artworks nice but

[01:07:35] i'm not going to buy a pinball machine for artwork i'm going to buy it for you know the full package

[01:07:39] and my problem is is if i see it dimple i'm a cd and if i see it dimple in that play fill i know

[01:07:44] every game i'm going to buy out there it's going to have it i'm just going to drive me nuts that i

[01:07:48] paid all that money and and every time i go up to play i'm just going to see the moon right and

[01:07:53] so for me right now it's it's a big problem in buying you know other other manufacturers just

[01:07:58] because i know that one thing alone is just going to drive me nuts real quick on the artwork

[01:08:04] comment because you must see that these companies have been able with artwork alone right to

[01:08:11] sell games and to sell more expensive versions of games without changing anything mechanically

[01:08:17] are you still aiming though to have some of the most beautiful pinball machines ever released

[01:08:22] from an artistic standpoint you know that that that's almost like an impossible thing to do or ask

[01:08:27] right i mean because the beauty is in the eye of the boulder um it has been very difficult uh you know

[01:08:34] i look i i disagree with Christopher french's description you know on a recent podcast with you

[01:08:40] about about what happened i'm not going to sit there and i'm not going to say anything about it

[01:08:44] right i wish Christopher the best um and i think his artwork is amazing he's very talented

[01:08:50] individual and um that's all i'm going to say about that but what we've tried to do is is try to

[01:08:57] take from the greats um that have put some great artwork out there but but really do our own thing

[01:09:02] and we have a lot of very talented people in deep-root studios who i think have gotten you know

[01:09:08] what the core art requirements are for a pinball machine and try to make it their own and so i think

[01:09:17] that with raza uh we built upon and that's why it's hack job we built upon what other artists and

[01:09:23] pinball did and so it was easy to follow that template in that theme but i think our second and third

[01:09:29] and fourth and and so on those titles is going to be a good uh good measure of of whether um what

[01:09:36] deep-root art style will be and whether we measure up now some people are going to like it some

[01:09:42] people are not but let me tell you what i don't want anyone buying my machine because just because

[01:09:46] of art i would actually take offense to that uh a one thing buying it because it's the best value

[01:09:51] for the buck and they can't stop playing it and they they want to part with their hard earns money

[01:09:59] to put that deep-root machine in their house that would make me happy but by one of our machines

[01:10:04] for artwork i would be very very upset if i heard someone say that is there any concern robert that

[01:10:09] the market is becoming oversaturated with the amount of companies and titles sure i think i

[01:10:16] um i think that uh i want to stick away from talking about tactics of competition and i'll say this

[01:10:25] is that i think a lot of money has been unnecessarily spent over the last few years i think space is

[01:10:33] very limited now and i think that we're heading towards some economic uh you know turmoil eventually

[01:10:39] uh you know i i would have guessed it would have been cure already last year or this year but

[01:10:43] who knows when we might see another downturn in the economy and you know money gets tight again

[01:10:48] uh what we're trying to do is provide and anticipate that and provide the best value for the buck

[01:10:54] so when it happens consumers can say you know what i could buy the latest you know licensed or unlicensed

[01:11:00] title from this company but you know the best thing for my buck is a deep-root machine and so i'm

[01:11:05] going to spend my hard money there and to some extent you know i think pinball is recession proof and

[01:11:10] i don't think that there's going to be a crash in pinball in the grand scheme of things i just think

[01:11:14] that there's going to be um some honest competition and consumers are finally going to have a choice

[01:11:20] about where to put the harder money and and i'm going to make the best uh case that that we can for

[01:11:26] me and my company that deep-root is where that money should go. When you look at where you want your

[01:11:32] company to be size wise are you gunning for something as big as a stern or jersey jack we know you

[01:11:40] are already bigger than spooky so well stern is very weak right stern is completely weak

[01:11:45] um and their model is very precarious um and i know that they'll completely laugh um but when you

[01:11:53] build up a structure like that you get weaker and weaker when that structure can't continue to be fed

[01:12:00] in in the same way that that you've planned and so we don't need to take away most of the

[01:12:07] what do you mean but what do you mean by that what do you mean by that?

[01:12:11] uh the bigger you get the easier it is to fall i mean um it's like building you know house of

[01:12:16] cards with an with an unsteady foundation right uh labor costs fix costs um you know park costs uh

[01:12:26] you know those are very very painful when you have a throttling and a variability of sales

[01:12:33] and you see that with a lot of you know not only there but with jgp as well and why they suddenly

[01:12:39] brought out these new titles or rehashed old titles and brought them out new and why they suddenly

[01:12:44] brought something out early and stuff well you just you just see that in their actions right

[01:12:49] and so what we want to do is we don't even want to worry about that because we're focused on a very

[01:12:53] different value proposition we're focused on different price points and we're focused on different

[01:12:58] themes and and different approaches to to pinball and so what we want to do is we want to be profitable

[01:13:05] on every title we want people to enjoy and want to continue playing our games and so when it comes to

[01:13:11] you know those comparisons and stuff like that you know i'm not really worried i hope stern

[01:13:17] continues to pound it and continues to sell the best they can and jgp and spooky you know i i don't

[01:13:23] i don't see any benefit to anybody for those companies going out of business or for for

[01:13:27] deeper to come in and crush them i think that there's still plenty of a market and an opportunity for

[01:13:32] each of these companies to make the best darn argument they can to consumers and continue to innovate

[01:13:37] and to pound it and i hope they they when they see what we have i hope that they they go wow we need

[01:13:42] to catch up right wow we need to do this uh you know because it keeps all of us honest and it makes

[01:13:48] a better pinball market for for consumers and as we always say on this show competition will always

[01:13:55] benefit the the consumer and we will see products get better and better the more people that come

[01:14:02] into this hobby to disrupt and to innovate oh Robert i really want to thank you for taking the time

[01:14:07] i know you're not feeling 100% so i really do appreciate uh you spending an hour or hour 10 minutes

[01:14:13] on canada spin ball podcast um we look forward to seeing the final product i might have to get a

[01:14:19] plane ticket hopefully i'm on the your little media list of for the deeproot tour uh in march to see

[01:14:26] the reveal in the auditorium and i know people are waiting you know to see the final package of

[01:14:32] of raza and to see what deeproot pinball has in store for all of us any final words Robert before

[01:14:38] i let you go and recover yeah this will be the last interview i do before launch um and

[01:14:45] i appreciate uh you you asking me on we've always had great conversations um and you know we

[01:14:52] we have some good banter behind the scenes uh i want to i want to just say a couple things you

[01:14:56] don't mind i want to thank all of the hardworking people at deeproot those who are still here and

[01:15:01] those that have left for other opportunities for everything they did to make use impossible and

[01:15:05] everything they're doing behind the scenes to to to to drive innovation and have the passion to

[01:15:11] create the best pinball experience that we can provide to consumers i want to thank all of the

[01:15:17] pinball media out there for uh for the good comments and the bad comments i even want to think uh

[01:15:22] even the the the most negative people in the world that that mainly the reason why i just won't go

[01:15:28] to penside anymore um because you know their negativity makes us stronger and it forces us to to

[01:15:36] really keep um keep our eyes on the price uh and not be distracted and you know most most

[01:15:43] importantly i want to think the pinball community out there for for keeping pinball around uh as a

[01:15:49] finished vintage part of americana and we're going to do our best to to have our little stake

[01:15:55] in that community and do the best we can to to come through with a with a great launch and lastly i

[01:16:01] want to say um something special to those zidware customers who went through the the claims process

[01:16:08] and decided uh last july to to trust in deeper and to delay instead of take a cash out i told you

[01:16:15] i would take care of you and you better believe it's common and i'm going to take care of you in

[01:16:19] grand fashion with uh VIP experiences for launch uh and for for tpf and forgetting uh what most

[01:16:27] people won't get and then behind the scenes um a look at um at what we're doing and i i'm very

[01:16:33] grateful for for those zidware um claimants for for trusting in us and and being willing to uh to

[01:16:40] be patient with us as we get everything ready to go can i get one of those VIP passes because i

[01:16:45] bought a magic girl for twenty three thousand dollars i think that we're going to be handing out

[01:16:51] quite a few VIP passes to those people who to quite a few people who will be attending tpf

[01:16:56] next year i've spoken to ed about it and he's stoked about uh what we want to do with the VIP room

[01:17:02] and um more will be discussed on that later well robert i think that was well said and and thank you
