[00:00] Feel it coming in the air, and the screams from everywhere.

[00:05] I'm addicted to the thrill, it's a dangerous love affair.

[00:15] Happy Monday after the Super Bowl, everybody is filled with food and beer, and now we have to go back to work.

[00:22] Is anyone gonna take this JJP job for $80,000 a year to code some Pimball machines?

[00:28] We're gonna talk about that, we're gonna talk about this new mod for Stern Machines that blows up the screen a little bit.

[00:34] I like it, I saw it at Jack Bar, I saw it on Godzilla, I think for $650.

[00:40] You get to see your Stern Machines in a whole new, larger-than-life screen, we're gonna talk about that.

[00:46] We're gonna talk about whether or not we think Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters is next.

[00:50] Did you see his TV commercial at the Super Bowl?

[00:53] He's been omnipresent in the world, Dave Grohl lately.

[00:57] He is a little bit of a corporate sellout, but don't tell that to the Foo Fighters fans.

[01:01] And we also know that they have a new album dropping in March, we're gonna talk about that.

[01:06] But let me start out by saying this, I played James Bond for almost two hours at Jack Bar.

[01:12] John, thank you so much for the hospitality, thank you so much for the offer of a free drink, which I did not take,

[01:17] because I'm still feeling a little under the weather.

[01:20] Been a rough few weeks for me and the family, I'll let you guys know more about what's going on at a later date,

[01:25] but thank you guys for all the well wishes.

[01:27] All of us are still healthy and gainfully employed, but I'll let you guys in on what's going on at a later date.

[01:32] But I played James Bond, right? And I wanna just say this, this is the thing about James Bond Pimbald,

[01:38] that's just not clicking with me yet. And let me break it down very simply.

[01:42] When I play James Bond Pimbald, I don't feel like I am James Bond.

[01:48] I don't feel like the Sean Connery James Bond, the womanizer, the guy with the gadgets, the guy with the fancy clothes,

[01:56] the guy with the jokes, I don't feel like I'm James Bond.

[02:00] And maybe this is still because it's early on in the code.

[02:03] But when you turn this game on, you get the theme song.

[02:07] But where's Sean Connery? Why isn't he talking? Why isn't he inviting us to anything?

[02:12] There's just not a lot of him coming at you in the game at all.

[02:15] And I remember when Batman and Robin was early with Batman 66, right?

[02:19] And you didn't get much, but that game came to life.

[02:21] And when you play Batman 66, you really feel like you're playing as Batman and Robin,

[02:27] and you're going after the villains, and you're jailing them, and you're going after the minor villains,

[02:31] and you're working your way through the Batman 66 world.

[02:35] And when I play James Bond right now, I just don't feel that.

[02:38] So from a code standpoint, I know it's still early on.

[02:42] I know they're still going to put a lot into this game.

[02:45] But as of right now, and this had the latest code in the game,

[02:49] as of now, I'm just not getting what I think people love about Sean Connery's James Bond.

[02:55] I'm not feeling it in this game right now.

[02:58] I don't feel like the moments, right?

[03:00] Like right now, this game does not have like these magical James Bond moments.

[03:04] And again, it's early on in the code.

[03:07] The bigger issue with this machine itself is just the layout.

[03:10] And I've played it a lot.

[03:12] And I played Godzilla, and I played Toy Story, and I played the other games at Jack Bar,

[03:17] and I played Deadpool, and I want to say I'm just not a fan of the James Bond layout.

[03:23] And I know when I say this, and I say that people who are making excuses for the layout

[03:27] saying it's challenging but fun, and I just have to disagree a little bit.

[03:32] And I think the big issue I have with this game are the ramps in the game.

[03:36] I just don't find them that satisfying.

[03:39] I do find them tough to hit.

[03:41] I think they're challenging to find the ramp shots on this game.

[03:44] And I think because that right ramp shot, the villain shot, is so crucial to starting the villain modes in the game,

[03:51] I think it's an interesting, I would say questionable design choice

[03:56] to make one of the most crucial shots in the game not very easy to hit.

[04:01] And look, I don't think pinball should be overly easy.

[04:03] I mean, I think there's people out there that consider Toy Story 4 overly easy of a pinball machine, right?

[04:09] You could sit on it for like 20 minutes and get through most of the game.

[04:13] But there's a balance, and I just don't think James Bond has the right balance for me as of now.

[04:18] Now look, I'm playing it on location.

[04:20] John sets up his games very well.

[04:23] I probably need another 50 plays to learn the shots more, right?

[04:27] Because that right ramp, it comes off of that lower left flipper, and it's a little deceiving.

[04:33] Like if you shoot it where the line is, right?

[04:35] There's that row of villains with their inserts.

[04:38] If you shoot it off the tip of the flipper where it looks like it lines up, you're going to go to the right of that ramp.

[04:44] You're not going to hit that ramp dead on like you need to.

[04:47] I actually have a lot more luck with that ramp when it comes off of like the orbit, and it's more of like a combo into that ramp.

[04:53] Now all this being said, I just think when I look at the left side of the game,

[04:58] and I think about what you shoot in James Bond Pimball, and I know it's not a premium.

[05:03] I know it's not an LE, but aren't the shots pretty much the same?

[05:07] I just don't find that whole missile area to be rewarding at all.

[05:11] Shooting the drop targets, alright? That's really easy.

[05:14] And then it's really easy just to lob the ball up into that missile area with the targets behind it,

[05:19] but it's not satisfying.

[05:21] Bashing that missile is not satisfying at all.

[05:25] And then you've got the area by the upper left flipper, and there's just like this scoop the ball goes into,

[05:30] and it fires it out towards the pop bumpers, and that's not exciting at all.

[05:35] And I feel like they should have designed it where to get into that scoop.

[05:39] I feel like that scoop should have been hidden more behind the upper left flipper,

[05:42] so you have to hold the flipper up to get the ball in there,

[05:45] but there's no moment, there's no meaning when the ball is being shot out of that scoop area.

[05:51] And I don't like stuff like that.

[05:53] Like, I think that whole part of the game, I think the whole left side of the game to me,

[05:57] is just very unrewarding other than, I will say, the one rewarding shot is really the left orbit is a fun shot to hit.

[06:04] And then the ramps, man, and this is the other thing.

[06:07] The whole area on the right side with these two ramps,

[06:10] sort of like midway up the play field at an awkward angle,

[06:13] and then you've got tight shots in between the two ramps,

[06:16] and then you've got the shot that goes into the VUK.

[06:19] All of it's there, I get it.

[06:21] You've got James Bond on the jetpack.

[06:23] The most rewarding shot, and I don't think it's an orbit.

[06:25] It's the far left shot is my favorite shot in the game.

[06:28] It goes up the far left, and then it goes up towards James Bond on the jetpack,

[06:33] and I think that's the best shot in the game.

[06:35] I don't think anything that you shoot up the middle is very interesting at all.

[06:40] And look, for many of you out there,

[06:42] you have a lot of pinball machines, right?

[06:44] So James Bond, and it's designed, and it's quirkiness, and it's weird layout,

[06:49] might be really exciting to you because it breaks up the monotony of your fan layout games,

[06:54] and it's definitely a quirky layout.

[06:56] And so for those of you out there, you might love it, right?

[07:00] You might love the layout, and that's great.

[07:02] I'm not here to say because I'm not enjoying James Bond, you won't enjoy James Bond.

[07:06] And I noticed that, right?

[07:08] When I say I don't like the way this game shoots,

[07:10] you know what people come at me with?

[07:11] They're like, guns and roses shoots like crap.

[07:13] Why is it that Canada is the torch bearer for how guns and roses shoots?

[07:18] And everyone comes at me left and right.

[07:20] Every time I don't like another game's layout, they're like, but GNR is crap.

[07:25] And let me tell everybody right now, GNR as a layout, as a game, I would argue is not the best,

[07:32] but it's also not as bad as people say.

[07:35] Like, there's a lot to shoot at in guns and roses.

[07:38] It also has some unique shots.

[07:39] It's got stuff to hit.

[07:40] It's got a lot of up and down and left and right action.

[07:43] So look, I don't love GNR the way I love to shoot Godzilla,

[07:47] but I also don't hate it the way some people hate on it so profusely.

[07:52] And I think the thing that really hurts guns and roses gameplay are weak flippers.

[07:56] So you need to add those like flipper fans, which I still think is pathetic for this much money.

[08:01] We're not getting good flipper feel in Jersey Jack games.

[08:04] So I think that changes people's gameplay perspective on GNR.

[08:08] And also the game is very multi-ball heavy.

[08:10] And I think that turns a lot of people off.

[08:13] If I didn't love guns and roses as a band, would I buy guns and roses pinball machine?

[08:17] No, I wouldn't.

[08:18] I wouldn't buy any band pinball machine unless I love the band.

[08:22] And I know how great Iron Maiden shoots.

[08:24] I just can't stand Iron Maiden music.

[08:27] I know Rush shoots great.

[08:28] I'm never buying a rush because I don't like the music.

[08:30] And I think music pins are designed for people who love the musical acts.

[08:35] Now, every once in a blue moon will get an amazing game like Metallica,

[08:39] an amazing game like Iron Maiden, an amazing game like ACDC, you know,

[08:44] and for a lot of people out there, they can put up with the music because the pinball is just so damn good.

[08:50] And I will say this, guns and roses is not that game.

[08:53] If you don't like guns and roses, you are not going to be won over by the gameplay of this machine.

[08:59] And I will say that and I agree with that.

[09:01] And when people say G&R is not the best shooter, I don't disagree with you.

[09:05] I own a guns and roses because I love G&R and I love the game.

[09:09] And I love the way the game transports me into a guns and roses concert.

[09:13] It is still one of the greatest theme integrated pinball machines of all time.

[09:18] And I don't understand, and this is my one argument,

[09:20] I don't understand how you can have a few beers, a few whiskeys,

[09:24] turn on guns and roses pinball to volume 10 and not have a fun time playing pinball.

[09:29] Then something is wrong with you because I also love the fact that when you play guns and roses,

[09:34] if you just hit the scoop up the middle a few times, you're going to experience something in a pinball machine.

[09:40] That is a magical moment.

[09:42] And there is nothing else like G&R when it comes to music and lights and pinball all combining at one time.

[09:48] You could play 20 games of James Bond and never see anything interesting happen in the game.

[09:53] Never see a single magical moment happen in the pinball machine

[09:57] because you might not be skillful enough to hit that doozy of a right ramp.

[10:01] So look, we're allowed to judge these things without bringing something else into the debate.

[10:06] It's like if I say I don't like the way James Bond shoots,

[10:09] I shouldn't be attacked because I own a guns and roses machine.

[10:13] We're all in this hobby, let's remind ourselves.

[10:16] We're all in this hobby to have a good time and have fun.

[10:19] And so sometimes, you know, look, I can say I don't like something,

[10:22] but I'm not going to berate you for liking it or owning it.

[10:26] The only thing I will berate you for owning, and I mean it, is a $20,000 single-level Keith Ellen James Bond machine

[10:33] that once people unpack this thing, you're going to realize what a colossal ripoff it was

[10:39] spending that much money on that game.

[10:41] And I don't care how much fun you're having because you showed stern pinball that we would pay this much for that.

[10:47] And that is my problem with anyone who buys that game.

[10:50] Alright, so speaking of music and pinball, let's talk about the Foo Fighters.

[10:54] So look, they have a new album coming out in March.

[10:56] They were just in a Super Bowl spot.

[10:59] Dave Grohl is getting ready.

[11:01] They're ramping up the marketing for their new album that is happening in just a few weeks.

[11:05] I think Foo Fighters is going to be next.

[11:08] I put up a post on Facebook saying, I am confirming it is next.

[11:12] Now let me tell you right now, this is me putting my reputation, which I don't have anymore, right?

[11:16] Most people will say I have no credibility and I have no reputation left in pinball.

[11:21] So I have not seen it yet, right?

[11:23] So it's very rare for me to give a confirmation like this.

[11:27] I just feel really good and I just want to give some bait to the Canadian haters

[11:32] because if I'm wrong and it's venom, they're going to be like, see, we can't trust this man.

[11:38] This man doesn't deserve to have 568 club members.

[11:44] Thank you so much, everybody.

[11:46] We are killing it and we're the only pinball podcast.

[11:49] Well, not the only one.

[11:50] We are one of the few pinball content creators out there.

[11:54] Not getting any discounts and not getting any kickbacks.

[11:57] I earn every single penny I do making this content and I sleep good at night knowing that.

[12:03] That nobody, nobody gives me special privileges just because I'm slapping sponsorships on top of this show.

[12:09] You know who sponsors Canada's Pinball Podcast?

[12:11] You do.

[12:12] The people do.

[12:13] And that is why I am always looking out for the customer and the consumer, not the companies.

[12:19] I don't care if I don't interview anyone in the industry ever again because we need a show like this

[12:25] where we can talk openly about pinball without having any special interests.

[12:29] And that's why you're here and that's why you love the show.

[12:31] All right, so I think Foo Fighters is next.

[12:33] I think we're going to see it.

[12:34] I'm also hearing this and again, this is what landed in my inbox that Foo Fighters is next

[12:40] and someone who's usually not very excited about music pins has seen the game and says it is over the top in an awesome way.

[12:49] And so I expect Jack Danger to come out with something really special.

[12:54] And I think Jack Danger is a great guy.

[12:56] You know what's fun about this?

[12:57] This is Jack Danger's first cornerstone game.

[12:59] And I love a new designer coming into pinball because they're going to share with us their design philosophy when it comes to pinball.

[13:07] And I think that's what's really exciting.

[13:09] You know, that's what makes all of pinball so exciting is that a designer is like a movie director.

[13:14] They all have different styles.

[13:16] They all have different ways they envision using that finite amount of space to create a world under glass.

[13:24] And I'm really rooting for Jack Danger.

[13:26] Now look, do I wish Jack Danger was making a theme that had more universal appeal?

[13:30] Absolutely.

[13:32] But, and this is a big but, and I mean this, this game is being made for fans of Foo Fighters.

[13:38] And there are enough Foo Fighter fans out there to probably buy three to four thousand of these machines.

[13:44] The big question we all have right now is Stern going to charge $13,000 for a Foo Fighters LE.

[13:51] Are they going to make a thousand of them?

[13:53] My prediction is that Stern is going to lower that number.

[13:56] They're going to lower it to 500 LEs of Foo Fighter if they want to charge $13,000.

[14:02] The other thing they could do is they could make a thousand of them, but maybe they lower the price a little bit.

[14:07] You know, and maybe they say James Bond was more expensive because of the higher licensing costs.

[14:12] But we've never, and I mean this, never ever in the history of Stern Pinball have they ever lowered the price.

[14:19] We've never seen that.

[14:20] Like they didn't charge us less money for Black Knight LE than Ghostbusters LE, even though Black Knight was a much cheaper IP to make.

[14:29] So I think we're stuck here.

[14:30] We're stuck with these high prices.

[14:32] And with these high prices, you know how I feel.

[14:34] They got to bring the high magic, the high moments in Pinball that are going to make us giddy and hand over this much money.

[14:40] All right, so let's talk about $80,000 a year to work at Jersey Jack Pinball as a software engineer and a coder.

[14:48] Do you want to join the Jersey Jack team?

[14:50] Now look, this debate on Pinside is funny because most people who collect Pinball machines or buy them are making well over $80,000 a year.

[14:59] And if there's anything I've noticed about grown men, they love to brag about how much money they make and give advice about life and money and salary.

[15:09] And whether or not you should leave a job for money or you should stay where you feel fulfilled, we're all weird when it comes to this stuff.

[15:16] I don't like getting into conversations about salary.

[15:19] My dad always told me never tell anybody what you make, never share your salary with others.

[15:25] I do not.

[15:26] Do I want to make more money?

[15:27] Sure.

[15:28] Who doesn't want to make more money?

[15:30] Do I want to give you career advice?

[15:32] No, I don't.

[15:33] I should take more of my own career advice instead of giving it to other people.

[15:38] It does seem that $80,000 a year is a little low for someone with three to five years of coding experience.

[15:45] It does say that that's where the salary starts, not ends.

[15:48] So if you have more credentials, maybe they'll give you more money.

[15:52] I don't think someone who works in coding should make more money than someone who works maybe in communications or marketing.

[15:58] I mean that.

[15:59] And I'm someone who works in communications.

[16:01] Coding is a real skill.

[16:03] To get into a communications job, you kind of just have to study nothing really.

[16:08] There's not really a major required to get into my industry, which is kind of why I enjoy it and why I'm good at it.

[16:15] I'm very creative.

[16:16] I mean, I'm very good at my job.

[16:17] And creativity does not come to everybody easily.

[16:21] And I'm not going to argue like coders have very specific skill sets and it is a much higher skill set than communication.

[16:28] And I think it's a good sign that Jersey Jack is hiring more coders because if there's one big complaint I hear from current J.J.P. owners,

[16:35] they just don't finish the code.

[16:37] Like they haven't given final code for Guns N' Roses yet.

[16:40] There's no final code for Pirates of the Caribbean.

[16:42] And I think they need someone on staff, right?

[16:45] After Kiefer Codes a Game or Joe Katz.

[16:47] They need someone to still polish the code and get it to a final place.

[16:52] And Jersey Jack, it's about time.

[16:54] So I hope they fulfill this position soon.

[16:56] And I can't wait to see the next game from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[16:59] And I'm really nervous about the next game for Jersey Jack because everybody keeps coming to me and saying,

[17:05] hey, like I don't want it to be Godfather.

[17:07] And look, I don't want it to be Godfather either.

[17:10] I hope, and this was my rumor or my speculation.

[17:13] I was hoping that maybe Godfather is codename for the movie franchise that is Godfather at the box office,

[17:20] which is Avatar.

[17:21] And maybe Eric's game is really Avatar 2.

[17:24] His game was supposed to come out in December, which is when the Avatar movies came out,

[17:29] but they pushed it back, right?

[17:31] Because Jersey Jack has always said for the last four years,

[17:34] Jack Winnari has said, we're going to get out two games a year.

[17:37] They've never done it.

[17:38] They're on like an 18 month reveal schedule for games.

[17:42] And so will we see the next game in March?

[17:44] I don't know.

[17:45] I told you you were going to see it next week, February 20th.

[17:48] I'm probably going to be wrong.

[17:50] But guess what?

[17:51] If I'm wrong, nobody's mad at me.

[17:53] They're mad at Jersey Jack Pinball for making you wait.

[17:56] But I do think Godfather, it's going to be really hard for this game to take off within the community.

[18:01] All right.

[18:02] So let's talk now about this stern mod that I've been talking about,

[18:05] this larger screen you can upgrade your stern machine with for $650.

[18:10] I think this is a good mod, gang.

[18:12] Take a look at my Facebook page.

[18:13] I shared the post about it.

[18:15] When you see it on Godzilla and I played Godzilla with it, it's awesome.

[18:19] I love it.

[18:20] It's awesome.

[18:21] The only issue with it is it makes the speakers like more oval instead of circular.

[18:26] And so for people out there, I think all the mods we have where we add like the circular LED rings around the speaker panel,

[18:33] it's not going to work.

[18:35] The other thing too is if you upgrade to this thing, are people going to move over their LE plaques?

[18:39] I don't think that's going to be the case.

[18:41] I think you'll save your original panel that came with the game.

[18:44] Like keep it like that and then just put this in here as an upgrade.

[18:48] And then maybe when you sell your game, you'll put the old one back on.

[18:51] Now look, I have a Batman SLE, which has one of the nicest speaker panel areas in all of pinball history, right?

[18:57] It's got the ring around the speakers.

[18:59] It's got the bat symbol over the speakers.

[19:01] And it's also powder coated with the metallic flake.

[19:04] And it's got my super le badge on it.

[19:07] If I change that to this new mod, I'm going to lose all of that.

[19:11] Now what I think I might do is get this new mod and have it powder coated to match the Batman.

[19:17] And then keep it as that.

[19:19] I was going to actually create a custom plaque for my Batman SLE.

[19:23] I was going to go ask Christopher Franci if he'll make me one.

[19:26] I want it to be named Canada's $25,000 Batman SLE, one of one sucker edition.

[19:33] Something like that.

[19:34] Like I want to make fun of myself in a self deprecating way that I spent $10,000 over what I paid for the game like four years ago just to get the game back.

[19:44] I think we all need to have more self deprecating humor and pinball people.

[19:47] I think a lot of people are taking this way too seriously.

[19:51] A lot of people are attacking people way too often.

[19:54] Gang, life is really short.

[19:56] I mean it.

[19:57] Enjoy our pins.

[19:58] Enjoy the banter we have back and forth with this podcast and with my Facebook live.

[20:03] But other than that, never get in a serious fight with anybody over pinball.

[20:07] Alright, what else is happening?

[20:08] So look, we're still waiting for Scooby Doo.

[20:10] We're still waiting for Bond's 60th.

[20:12] I really think we're going to see both of those games.

[20:15] Maybe by the end of this week, I think we might see both of those games out in the wild.

[20:20] And that's a good thing.

[20:21] I can't wait to see how both of them play because I'm worried.

[20:25] I'm really worried when we see gameplay for both of these, I think interest in both titles could soften after gameplay.

[20:34] Look, there's a reason Stern is stalling on showing people gameplay.

[20:38] Think about it.

[20:39] They just launched the most expensive pinball in the history of pinball and they refuse to give us a real gameplay video before they took your money.

[20:49] If that doesn't say to all of us what Stern thinks of us, then I don't know what does.

[20:55] And it also shows them how gullible some of these buyers are.

[20:59] I mean, you're really going to buy it without seeing anything other than that two minute sizzle reel video.

[21:05] I wish I had so much money where I can make decisions with so little information.

[21:11] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[21:13] We'll be back more this week with more shows.

[21:15] We're going to start to see these gameplay videos and March is going to be crazy.

[21:18] I need to get sleep.

[21:19] You can hear it in my voice.

[21:20] Like I slept on the couch last night.

[21:22] I'm suffering from a lack of sleep and I hope this podcast does not put you to sleep.

[21:27] Everybody talk to you soon and have a great Monday.

[21:48] Sha!
