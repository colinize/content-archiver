[00:00] Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome, I'm just an ordinary daily guy.

[00:06] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up.

[00:11] We're gonna have a fun show. I don't think Michael Barrett's gonna be joining us, little

[00:15] Crab baby over there, these newbies that have been in the hobby for a couple years, come

[00:19] in here, insult Canada's fan base, they're over there bickering on the other BS pages.

[00:27] I love it people, I love it, I love it. The more they try to stop K-man, the more they

[00:33] send people through the door. Our subscription numbers are up, we're closing in again on

[00:39] 700. It feels so good, all we need, thank you for the stars David, I have not sold the

[00:44] Neo Geo yet. It's one of those things where you gotta see these Neo Geos, I mean they're

[00:49] just museum pieces. The problem is, is like the Neo Geo Facebook pages are terrible, I

[00:55] need to go more towards the arcade collectors. I think I came in a little too hot at 10K,

[01:02] it's worth around there but maybe not, right? I mean ultimately the market will decide.

[01:07] Jengiz is in the house, we gotta get Kari Hardy and Jengiz in the room together. So if

[01:12] you know Kari Hardy, I can't message him right now because I'm live, we gotta get Kari Hardy

[01:17] and Jengiz in the house. I mean this has probably been the most divided, the most engaging, the

[01:26] most like critical, the most controversial week ever when it comes to a pinball launch.

[01:35] I don't think I've ever seen a pinball launch week sort of unravel in such a terrible way.

[01:42] Javier, if you bought a John Wick LE, you just lit three to four thousand dollars on fire,

[01:49] brother. I mean Javier, you know I love you brother but man it is the dumbest LE you can ever buy

[01:56] right now. Knowing what we all know about prices, we're gonna talk all about this but man FOMO is,

[02:04] FOMO isn't just dead on this game. Something can die that was never alive. There was never even

[02:11] any FOMO on this game. You know the thing is this, we're gonna talk all about Gungate, we're gonna

[02:17] talk about Gomez Damage Control, we're gonna talk about Stern's social media company, Jared hitting

[02:26] me up. I've never seen Stern. This whole like we're only gonna get five for all of Spain. Like what

[02:32] does that mean bro? Like what does that mean? Like you guys don't have shipping services? Javier,

[02:38] here's what doesn't make sense to me man. You're telling me that in Spain you can't wait to this

[02:45] game is worth like 8,500, buy it and just spend $1,500 to ship it over there. Like why would you buy

[02:53] it new, pay all the VAT taxes but you don't have like why do you need it right now? We make exclusively

[03:00] for you. You're telling me you can't buy a Stern machine and ship it to Spain. That doesn't make

[03:05] any sense to me. You can buy products from all over the world and ship it. Are they gonna break

[03:09] your system so only those five can work if you're on inside or connected via Spain's VPN or whatever?

[03:15] I want to welcome Ken to the show. So Ken and I had a really good FOMO conversation earlier this

[03:23] morning. Ken, thank you brother for joining the show. You know Ken is one of our very passionate

[03:28] members here and I like Ken a lot because he challenges me and he challenges the way I think

[03:34] and I love that. You know and I had a really good conversation earlier this week too with

[03:39] Mad Pimball, Jeff over there. I'm gonna talk a little bit about that because I think in this week

[03:44] of utter divisiveness, I think there's a way through it all where we need to get back to why

[03:52] we love Pimball because it's a escape from all the garbage right and I think a lot of the garbage

[04:00] got put onto the Pimball community this week and I think a lot of people handled it in an

[04:06] interesting way to say the least. Well we're gonna talk all about it. We're only like six

[04:11] minutes into this bad boy show. Thank you for the stars guys. You know me, I always have a

[04:16] stars target of 10,000. Michael Barrett said I don't have any fans. Man, man, someone's on the

[04:23] Patreon page. Someone's keeping you know, Kinead alive. Someone's watching this thing like 1800

[04:29] times. It's funny to me when you actually understand that we're a subculture within a subculture right

[04:38] we're like a subculture within gaming and arcade devices and when you start to really drill down

[04:46] you know to how many people actually buy new and box Pimball machines on a global level

[04:52] you really get to a point where you know having 3000 fans here having over probably you know

[05:00] a thousand people listening to every podcast because some of you are too cheap to pay you've

[05:04] probably steal my content you know the thing is like it's not insignificant when you're talking

[05:09] you know a thousand here three thousand there. More people are fans of this page than will buy

[05:15] John Wick Pimball right more people subscribe to Kinead's Pimball podcast on Patreon than will buy

[05:23] John Wick LE. Jengus should apologize to the Pimball community. Karey overreacted so badly.

[05:31] I wish I would have waited before posting the rant says Karey. Karey's here. Jengus is here.

[05:36] Everybody's here guys welcome. This is a no judgment zone. All right if anyone's ever taken a

[05:42] lot of arrows in the back no one's taken more than Kinead and the Pimball hobby. I know that we are

[05:48] very excited we are very passionate about Pimball and especially as content creators you know there's

[05:54] there's no filter anymore right it's just you can just go live Karey can just hop down to his basement

[06:00] Jengus can just put up a video. I think everybody has been very quick to react to something that

[06:06] now that we've had a week to absorb it all I think everybody realizes it was a little bit of a

[06:12] mountain was made out of a molehill and what that did was it created a lot of quick to judge right

[06:22] quick to judge stern like I think that do I think I here's here's what I've been thinking a lot about

[06:29] this all week gang and I've been thinking about this show and how I want to talk to you now that

[06:34] we have like we have Karey Hardy here we have Jengus here we have George Gomez's interviews do I think

[06:41] that stern didn't want to put guns in the game no right was it a mistake to make John Wick artwork

[06:48] without guns yes see here's my thing I think the answer to all of this is somewhere in the middle

[06:54] like not everybody's completely wrong not everybody's completely right because you know if you look at

[07:00] it and I'm looking at all these John Wick toys and these John Wick collectibles I think stern made

[07:04] a licensing mistake by indicating two Lionsgate that pinball machines are designed for all ages

[07:13] see that was stupid that was stupid I think once they did that they got looked at through a different

[07:20] licensing lens and so if they had said this was for adults which it is because nobody buys a pinball

[07:27] machine who's younger than 30 because they can't afford one I think they could have got a different

[07:33] licensing vantage point or lens looking at this game then they did okay so I think I think that

[07:41] stern might have over calculated or over like expressed you know who plays their product like

[07:49] three-year-olds are not playing pinball okay so I think stern made a little bit of a mistake there

[07:55] because we're seeing John Wick with guns all throughout other John Wick merchandise okay now

[08:00] do I think stern used John Wick as an agenda or some political stance to favor the alt left and DEI

[08:10] and woke and everything you know I don't think so you know I think that again I think they miscalculated

[08:18] I think they underestimated the response from people too and I think they had an opportunity

[08:25] here's the thing gang I don't blame Kerry Hardy I don't blame Jengiz I don't blame

[08:33] the blame on all of this the blame on all of this and I mean this when I say it I blame stern's

[08:41] marketing team stern's marketing team should have anticipated this should have on day one

[08:51] come out with the game if they had dropped this game on day one even with the gunless artwork

[08:58] but shown the gameplay with all of the John Wick clips where he's shooting up the entire joint

[09:06] with guns galore this never would have happened if stern just does marketed this game and showed

[09:15] us the right gameplay footage on day one they would have avoided all of this this was the worst

[09:24] marketing launch in history of stern I've never seen a stern launch week turned so negative so like

[09:35] so disgusting on so many levels now the game is lost in all of the debate the new designers lost

[09:42] in all of it what they're doing with everything everything is multiplied by a negative because

[09:49] stern has crappy marketing and they had to do so much damage control this week and it was embarrassing

[09:58] to see all of the damage control they had to do and that falls on stern you know George Gomez said

[10:05] to me we did not anticipate there would be this reaction to having no guns on John Wick artwork

[10:11] well George how so that is a colossal mistake you know you know who the pinball buying demographic

[10:19] is George you know you go to shows you know the states where pinball is really popular you know

[10:25] there's a lot of people that are gun aficionados and pinball the fishing autos and you know John

[10:31] Wick is like it's a damn movie celebrating firearms I mean that's really what it is so I still think

[10:40] really flubbed it and I know George has to go on his damage control tour defending the company and

[10:47] its integrity they could have easily avoided it okay so yes gun gate is dead now there are those

[10:56] saying now that anyone who was upset about the lack of guns should feel foolish now right it's

[11:03] like when people were insulting Kate Middleton on social media and then they realized like a few

[11:10] weeks later she had cancer right how crappy they should feel I don't know I don't think there needs

[11:15] to be any more discussion about it what I think is happening is a few things and I've said this and

[11:21] I'll say it again I think there is a level of vitriol and anger that is a powder keg that has

[11:31] already gone off this launch all it did was light that powder keg because for three years now

[11:38] stern pinball has been ripping all of us off and if you don't understand that and you think that

[11:46] this company you know with all their beer drinking and smiling and thumbs-uping they're over

[11:54] charging us on all of these games and I think people are angry about that I think people are

[12:00] angry that stern has destroyed its own FOMO and collectible market I think these games are so

[12:07] overpriced because after all the gun gate dies down here's what happened gang I went and watched

[12:12] the stream yesterday with Tim Sexton I went and I saw it for like an hour I saw the John Wick

[12:20] gameplay I saw the lights I saw the heard the music I saw the art I saw the clips I saw the heard the

[12:27] call-outs here's my here's my take on John Wick I think all of this controversy and all this arguing

[12:36] has distracted everybody from the fact of the matter that stern pinball just launched it's a

[12:45] basic game there's not this masterpiece or there's nothing that was shown yesterday that makes me

[12:54] feel like this game is elevating anything new there's no real toys in it that are impressive

[13:01] the layout is pretty pedestrian the code whatever you know there's a lot of clips but they're so

[13:07] repetitive and I think John Wick is a difficult game to create pinball wow and I'll explain why

[13:15] because the thing with John Wick and as I was watching the stream it doesn't have like these

[13:22] iconic bad guys that you can't wait to battle over and over again right it doesn't have Darth Vader

[13:31] Darth Maul you know Darth Sidious it doesn't have Shredder right it doesn't have Slimer

[13:38] and Stay Puff Marshmallow Man it's like you're playing this game and you're going after like the

[13:44] different bad guys through the four movies and when they're popping up like you're like who are these

[13:49] people like no one really remembers you know each of these movies to that degree all we really

[13:56] remember is like Keanu firing his guns and all the headshots and all the different like you know

[14:02] in unique environments and all the dogs that got killed and all the horses taking out bad guys it

[14:08] just doesn't have this like connection and then when you remove the rest of the movie which builds

[14:16] up all the tension to the action sequences and you just keep putting like action sequence action

[14:22] sequence action sequence like just you just keep putting them together the game just felt very

[14:28] like monochromatic to me the lighting system is just old it just doesn't impress at all like

[14:35] there's nothing about the lighting that isn't it looks like a 10 year old game in 2024 and so

[14:45] like I don't care I know like Tim Sexton has his fans and and this and that if this game

[14:52] was priced much cheaper I think we all look at it differently but I can't get over this guys I

[14:59] can't get over the fact that that is most likely what we're looking at there is a game with like a

[15:04] $3,500 bomb and there's there's no full RGB LED lights happening in the game the flat cheap plastic

[15:13] skyline is not really like impressive can we drill down on the same playfield being used three times

[15:19] like yeah I mean guys it's I think what everyone should know I think what everybody should know

[15:26] John Borg's Indiana Jones was supposed to be the game that came out now and that game got shelved

[15:33] so I think this game is somewhat of a stop gap quickly designed game I know Elliot he seems like

[15:43] a really nice guy and here I've been trying to think about how to say this because Elliot seems

[15:49] like a really nice guy he seems pretty shy he seems very jovial he seems like you know he's one of

[15:55] them I'm gonna say something right now and it might be a little controversial it might be a little

[16:05] I mean I just want to I don't want to be mean and I'm not going to be mean but I just want to say

[16:10] something that I've been thinking about the moment Stern pinball decided to raise their prices where

[16:16] they're at and we're talking 7000 for a pro to 13000 for an le you know 9500 for premiums 10 000

[16:24] for premiums every one of the games now at these prices has to be a banger like it has to be a banger

[16:30] and by banger I mean the new bar I think is Godzilla I think it's Jurassic Park I think it's stuff

[16:38] like Stranger Things I want to use those three games I want I want us to stick on what I mean by

[16:43] that I think Godzilla Jurassic Park and Stranger Things to me are where every single game needs to

[16:53] be in order to justify where the money is in these games okay all three of those games think about

[17:01] what made them so awesome you know the themes are great but they also did like interesting things

[17:07] mechanically that we hadn't seen before they also like had pinball moments that we hadn't seen before

[17:13] and they also like had a lot of wow throughout the game right a lot of them so it's like when

[17:20] Elliot comes out with this game and there's really not a lot right there's like only really not there's

[17:28] no movement really there's one bash toy mech there's like not a lot to get excited about when I look at

[17:36] what's physically on the game and like why not like where is the engineering like where's the

[17:43] where's the major mech that's supposed to be wow and I just think that like all world but Ryan I'm

[17:50] so tired of this Ryan let me like I am not spending seven to thirteen thousand dollars on audio video

[17:59] integration do you guys not understand this like you don't see any of those clips when you're playing

[18:05] a pinball machine this damn LCD screen has become the crutch for having empty barren games that cost

[18:12] twice as much as games that were loaded when are we gonna stop this this is not a video game it's not

[18:18] a movie it's an fm pinball machine I want to look down and see fm mechanical wow in the game guys like

[18:26] why the would I pay on a thirty five an dollar bomb game if all of the money is going into into video

[18:33] assets you can't see the video when you play a goddamn pinball machine and I hate to use the lord's

[18:38] name in vain but go play lord of the rings they physically had to make the ring ballrog you know

[18:46] the path of the dead like air gone sword like gandalf's lighted staff like the towers moving and

[18:52] shaking they like all that had to be in the game and now all we're doing is throwing the goddamn

[18:57] movie up for 40 minutes and saying oh they did such a great job they didn't do shit they didn't do

[19:03] shit they just took movie clips and put it on a screen how hard is that there's no coding there's

[19:08] no deli oh yeah where they sliced it up that's pinball now that's fm pinball and I'm so tired of

[19:15] this shit it's like that's not pinball that's not what mechanical engineers that's not a world

[19:20] underclass that's all they're doing I could go buy a freaking $19 john wick dvd and all your I don't

[19:27] want to watch the movie I want to be pulled into that world in a unique pinball way like why why are

[19:34] we defending the cheap way out it's the cheap way out guys why are you here why are you into pinball

[19:42] you're gonna spend 13 f in thousand dollars and all you get is a little Mustang bash toy and that's

[19:48] it no magnets no third flipper no upper play field no lower play field where the money go

[19:56] where is the money going in this game and I don't know why you defend them why like freaking totin

[20:04] was like $2,000 look at all the stuff in the twilight zone was like a $2,000 machine gang it was

[20:12] like $1,700 from vali Williams yeah you get it just for inflation all you want you're never gonna get

[20:19] close to 13,000 so stop defending these guys you know how you know how you know how hard you have

[20:25] to work to make $13,000 and you look down at the game and the freaking side armor is black no sparkle

[20:34] no topper no gun that you lock the bullets in I mean there's more gun action in the walking dead

[20:41] there's more gun action in acdc I don't understand this stuff I don't understand this stuff I don't

[20:48] understand why you guys are like well they really did a great job you do when you play pinball you're

[20:53] looking at your feet you're looking at your feet the moment they started charging $2,000 for toppers

[21:00] something you're not even going to see I just like I look I it's Saturday morning I it's Saturday

[21:06] morning and my point is this is where pinball prices are at and for where the bomb is at and for

[21:13] what's in this game not only is Elliott I don't think qualified yet to be a lead designer at these

[21:21] prices and I feel bad for Elliott because he shouldn't have to come out of the gate needing to hit a

[21:27] home run it's not Elliott's fault but this game isn't on this like this game isn't as good as

[21:34] Foo Fighters or Iron Maiden it's not even close and so it's not it's like it's so hard to be a rookie

[21:39] now it's there's no room for rookie designers you got to come out with a banger or you're like or

[21:45] you're gonna whip you know so they can they can they can employ all their Mickey Mouse YouTubers

[21:51] to try to deflect you you think B Kong is buying one for $13,000 the dude's hacking up $300 arcade

[21:58] one ups I know he's like a member of this page now and be welcome but bro you're not spending

[22:03] 13,000 on this B Kong you don't know what it's like to lose $3,000 in six months because you

[22:10] opened up a cardboard box it's like all of this to me is like John Wick to me has just become a

[22:16] metaphor for like everything that's wrong with Sturm right now their games are overpriced there's

[22:22] not enough magic in them and they're trying to hide behind video assets and artwork and it's only

[22:28] going to get them so far and the and the and the and the jig is up like the gravy train is over

[22:33] like it's over it's over like if you bought a John Wick at least you just lost three to four

[22:37] thousand dollars I guarantee you I guarantee you I will shut my show off for a month for a month

[22:45] if we get to the end of this year there will be no canada's pinball podcast between January one

[22:51] and the end of January I will shut my show off for a month if you can't get a John Wick LE for

[22:58] nine thousand dollars all right that I will bet George Gomez that Tim Sexton that Elliot Iceman

[23:04] that Randy Martinez that Christopher Franchi that Zach many that Carrie Hardy that Genghis that

[23:12] you will be able to get one for nine thousand dollars you are going to lose four thousand dollars

[23:17] and how long are they going to continue to push these absolutely tanking assets in front of us

[23:26] tanking it never used to be this way because it shouldn't be this way if you think I'm speeding

[23:31] some truth kick some stars so now that I've calmed down I think Elliot's game is a fine entry level

[23:37] game I think he's got a lot to learn about putting more wow into the game he seems like a nice guy

[23:43] but this pricing doesn't work for a rookie designer like him that doesn't have an out of the gate

[23:50] banger and this is not an out of the gate banger okay that's it and it's really hard because

[23:59] it's really difficult because I look at Stern like a movie studio and every designer is like a

[24:04] director and they're directing different movies and like do we have to just always give every

[24:09] movie a good score now look I think John Wick here's what I hear everybody saying it's fun I can't

[24:15] wait to play on location no no crap guys of course I can't wait to play this game on location of course

[24:22] I'm going to go to jack bar the moment they get this game of course I'm going to drop 20 30 50

[24:27] bucks into it but that's but I'm not going to buy it did what what could you have possibly seen

[24:34] that makes you want to buy this game what could you possibly have seen so far that's like yep

[24:40] I want to lose $3,000 I mean that's all in le purchases now yep I see enough where I think I'm

[24:47] I can't wait to lose $3,000 on this game thank you Seth Davis thank you you greedy SOB because Seth

[24:55] Davis how the f is a plastic topper where $2,000 you jackasses over there at stern pricing your

[25:02] jackasses can we call them jackasses $2,000 for a topper I think your jackasses I just got a freaking

[25:10] 82 inch freaking ink blue velvet couch from West Elm for $2,000 you jackasses a piece of furniture

[25:18] that I need this little topper that's what at most 24 inches long of plastic for two grand

[25:26] just f off f off I'm tired of this crap guys and all these moves are half I'm tired of George Gomez

[25:35] saying Seth's a great guy's a great business guy for who George for who all right I'm going to go

[25:41] up on a rant right now and I literally I'm just going to say this and I don't care anymore because

[25:47] like someone needs to say this shit and I'm going to curse and I don't like to curse but I'm going

[25:52] to curse right now but I just need to curse because you know why like every once in a while

[25:58] you know me I don't want to curse but every once in a while it wouldn't be an M&M album without

[26:02] some freaking expletive so here's here's the here's the fucking truth here's the fucking truth people

[26:10] when a company makes greedy fucking moves like stern and charges you two fucking thousand dollars

[26:17] for a fucking topper that probably cost them no more than like 200 bucks to make the reason why

[26:23] a company would do this fucking shit where they want to cook their fucking books to make their

[26:29] profits fucking sore do you know why companies fucking do that because they have something called

[26:35] share fucking holders where they want to fucking soar the profits so their stock can fucking go up

[26:42] so all the shareholders in that company can make fucking money that's why you would do it but news

[26:50] fucking flash set Davis you're not fucking publicly traded you're fucking skyrocketing the

[26:57] prices for your own fucking gain none of us are fucking investors we are now investors once we buy

[27:03] your products but the problem is our fucking stock is tanking as your profits are soaring

[27:12] why do I have to be the only fucking one you can see that our profits are fucking tanking

[27:20] as your profits are soaring the value of the assets of the stock a game is like a fucking

[27:26] share of stock I bought your 13 thousand dollars stock it's now worth nine thousand dollars but

[27:33] your profits are fucking soaring and I don't like cursing I'm not normally gonna do this but that's

[27:39] the fucking truth so while Gary becomes richer and Gomez and set Davis I don't need to see fucking

[27:46] pictures of the team has celebrating over beers because my friends are losing fucking three to

[27:52] four thousand dollars on every single game and no one wants to fucking ask why or nobody wants to

[27:56] try to lower the prices and nobody wants to limit the number of fucking le's and all the fucking le

[28:01] buyers that kept your candy asses in business all these years who do you fucking think has

[28:06] floated stern all these years all the le buyers that have been buying from you for 10 years and

[28:12] then you bring in set Davis and then you fuck them all with those anniversary editions and you

[28:17] were gonna keep fucking us until we said something and nobody else all the shill content creators

[28:23] in your back fucking pockets they weren't saying anything they don't say shit you know you got guys

[28:29] like they're fucking you got your shill content creators you know who they are saying James Bond

[28:33] sixtieth was priced perfectly at twenty thousand dollars and we're supposed to let you charge us

[28:40] twenty thousand dollars for James Bond sixtieth George and Seth and Gary and Keith Elwin why is he

[34:18] to buy their own products you know i remember jack danger when he used to make like a court you know

[34:23] like like 30 000 a year because he loved it so much you know now he's making games he wouldn't

[34:28] he wouldn't even be able to afford his own product like what happened what the fuck happened

[34:35] like seriously what happened i don't get what happened well that's what all the elvys are the

[34:40] market is telling stern the second hand market is telling stern what these things are freaking

[34:46] worth so do your do your um you know do your damage control gomez do your tours you know like go

[34:55] buddy up with joel and and what i saw loser kid and yet go go to go to your go to your media outlets

[35:08] fuck is a foo fighter topper worth two thousand dollars that's all i want to ask george gomez george

[35:16] you you're a smart man you used to make entire machines for that much money it's the two thousand

[35:22] dollar toppers it's the james bond 60th it's the rerunning of Jurassic park le it's fucking over

[35:30] every elvira owner who went in and believed them about their limited editions it's their

[35:35] fucking strategy over the last three years fuck off that's it stern fuck off like stern if you lower

[35:44] prices i will fucking i will be the first to stand up and applaud if you fucking put more into these

[35:51] games that are physical i will applaud you but i'm not i don't want pym all the turn into fucking

[35:56] xbox i don't want to turn into fucking xbox i don't need badges and and all that shit like what

[36:03] are we doing here gang you need to you need are we the girl scouts the boy scouts and you need

[36:08] little fucking badges can we just fucking have a great game like lord of the rings again can we

[36:12] just have a fucking great game like acdc again and metallica and godzilla and stranger things and

[36:16] drastic park can we fucking get that like every single time now at these prices how many fucking

[36:21] badges did you get when you played lord of the rings how many fucking badges do you have from

[36:26] tron how many fucking acdc achievements do you fucking have hanging on your wall they want

[36:32] they want to turn this product into something it's not they want to minimize their costs and i get it

[36:39] so they can increase their profits i get it but they're doing it like we're all shareholders and the

[36:45] assets we're buying are becoming worthless and they're making money the more profit they make the

[36:51] more these games go down in value you know let me explain to you why i love pinball and why you

[36:55] know i get i get this mad about stern pinball because i think stern pinball i think they had

[37:01] they had the pinball world and they had all of us they've made some of the greatest games of all time

[37:08] i think stern pinball has made the best pinball in the history of pinball all before seph davis

[37:14] i think stern pinball has the greatest coders i think they've got some of the best designers

[37:20] i think they make games that have the best replay value i think zonvietes artwork is the

[37:24] fucking best in the fucking history of pinball and and they had it so good and they fucking

[37:30] ruined it all by becoming greedy because you can't do what they did you can't take it this high

[37:37] these prices are so fucking arrogant it's like at these prices you're fucking saying that this game

[37:44] is a fucking masterpiece classic that people are going to want for fucking 20 years that's a $13,000

[37:50] game that's always what a $13,000 game was remember tron le was 5500 it only went up to

[37:58] $12,000 because there was only 400 and it was fucking amazing and everybody wanted one and

[38:03] there's only 400 tron le's in the world on day one john wick has a thousand le's it's not nearly as

[38:09] good as tron there's not nearly as much interesting stuff in it it's not nearly as atmospheric it's

[38:14] not nearly as cool and yet it's worth fucking it's more than twice the price that tron le was

[38:20] fuck off to me it's just as simple fuck off this this isn't like this isn't a product where you

[38:28] had to go hunt for the materials you didn't have to fucking go kill some tuna or shoot some cows

[38:32] it's fucking wood and lights so fuck off fuck off you triple the price of your product basically

[38:40] and put like not as much in it now when you when you when you actually make a product that seems

[38:45] like it's worth this much money then i'll stop telling you to fuck off and that's that i sold

[38:51] my batman sle and i don't want to support stern until i see them make moves that benefit this

[38:56] community and i think you know the damage control and b congs of the world that's fine they can do

[39:03] what they do but i'm gonna keep doing what i do and i'm allowed to say this stuff like

[39:08] they sell a very high price product and and i'm just i think that company now is has been driven

[39:16] by i i look i think it's always been there i think gary's always been like about the money

[39:22] about the product but gary also understood there was a limit and george knew that and so the only

[39:31] new factor that has been pushing stern so high is seth davis like he's the new variable i feel

[39:38] like gary knew there was a limit and i think i think they're all on board because they're all

[39:45] making money while while all my friends are losing money and that's that doesn't make me happy that

[39:51] doesn't make me excited and and i love that there's content creators that don't even want to talk about

[39:56] this stuff i don't really care like this is i think more people feel this way i think a lot of

[40:01] people are going to watch this video and i think if you buy john wick ellie i think you're um i think

[40:05] you need your head examined because now's a moment now's a moment for everybody if you put your foot

[40:11] down now and don't buy this you know middle of the road game that doesn't have a lot in it that

[40:18] doesn't have any innovation in it if you put your foot down now and don't buy it guess what's

[40:23] going to happen they're going to lower their fucking prices it's that simple people like mcdonald's

[40:28] lowering its prices tesla forward we can make stern pimp all lower their fucking prices and the

[40:34] way you get stern pimp all the lower their prices is you stop fucking buying that is like we have

[40:40] we have the power and and i don't understand you know and i talked to everybody man i talked to

[40:46] i talked to people all day long nobody wants these high prices nobody the distros don't want

[40:51] them dealers don't want them nobody it's just it's too much it's too much it's push friends like my

[40:59] friend derrick out of the hobby i think they're all living in their own little bubble like yeah i get

[41:04] it like imagine walking in the jjp your your billionaires calling the shots what does he know

[41:08] about like saving up the buy a pinball machine nothing you know they've lost touch with like who

[41:13] who is this community they've lost touch with the financial reality on all of us like yes the world

[41:20] around us is getting more expensive but my fucking pinball machine shouldn't be shouldn't be flying

[41:26] by the percentage increase of everything else like fuck you it's a pinball machine you're telling me

[41:34] that my fucking non-essential pinball toy is now exponentially going more expensive than my food

[41:40] and my car than my house than my clothes all the essentials and now i got to look over here the one

[41:46] thing that brought me joy and happiness was this this nice little subculture hobby of mine where if

[41:51] i bought a pinball machine i could play for a year and it wouldn't lose much value and it was such a

[41:56] fun thing to have and i could justify it to my wife i could justify it to my kids that if i bought an

[42:01] le for 8500 i could keep it for two years and sell it for 8500 but now i'm buying an le for 80 for

[42:06] 13 000 and if you put a fucking topper on it it's a $15 000 game and then i lose fucking and then i'm

[42:13] going to sell it for what what do you think a $15 000 with topper stern's going to go for

[42:18] you're gonna lose five you're gonna lose five to six thousand dollars so fuck you like fuck this

[42:24] pricing fuck it fuck it there's nothing else to say fuck pinball modern pricing that's it stop

[42:34] fucking with us i didn't get a fucking i didn't double my fucking salary in the last five years

[42:40] but you doubled you fucking 40 increase your prices who the fuck got a 40 raise and all the people

[42:46] defending these moves it's so stupid it's so stupid and i like i i'm reading your comments

[42:54] as i'm speaking and all of you feel the same way who the hell who the hell is excited who the hell

[43:02] is excited about these prices but what have you done you know the moment you bitch about it you

[43:09] get people mocking us right when we say stuff like this you're gonna get the people mocking us

[43:14] who are who are like the buddy buddies of stern like employees they're gonna mock you they're gonna

[43:21] mock you oh you know come on chris like it's just about the fun like this is not fun this is not

[43:26] fun yet because losing four thousand dollars on a brand new toy is not fucking fun and stop saying

[43:33] it's like driving a car off of the lot do you buy three to four fucking cars a year do you replace

[43:41] your car every fucking year no you don't do you need a fucking car yes you do do you need

[43:48] fucking food yes you do do you need furniture yes you do do you need another pinball machine

[43:54] when you already have 10 you already have 10 machines do you need another no you fucking don't

[44:01] so you don't fuck with the new and box FOMO they fucked with the new and box FOMO and now they're

[44:09] gonna get fucked and that's it I could just say that one sentence the moment you fucked with new

[44:16] and box FOMO you fucked yourselves over and all of you know who I'm talking it's not just stern

[44:22] they're fucking over all of it you think people want to buy a scooby-doo and then lose like three

[44:27] thousand dollars in here no fucking want to do it how come spookies are always like spookies have a

[44:32] twelve thousand dollars in the butter cabinet what the fuck happened fucking happened to some companies

[44:36] companies that make six thousand dollar games fucking wake up the next day fucking twelve

[44:40] thousand dollars in the butter cabinet the fuck happened to a double the price all right we're not

[44:46] supposed to say they they the fucking gas lit all of us okay I see seven okay eight okay eight

[44:52] 99 okay 92 hundred okay 97 hundred okay 10 1 okay okay they charge more for the butter cabinets

[45:00] the fuck they charge like 40 percent more for butter what happened butter more expensive now

[45:06] no Charlie's got three core vests that's what happened that's what happened they see the money

[45:14] they see the money and they want to cash out and they want to make as much as they can look and god

[45:18] bless you guys it's capitalism but it goes both ways you're allowed you're allowed to see how much

[45:24] you can make and I'm allowed to say how much I'm willing to take and how much I'm willing to give

[45:31] you're gonna hear this anywhere else you're gonna hear this on any other content creator page

[45:36] I think this is the most important podcast I've ever done like I don't mean to curse people I don't

[45:39] mean to be stride and I really don't but I think I I think I I think I'm expressing a level of tiredness

[45:48] of all of this crap and you know what it's and like gun gate just became a distraction from the real

[45:56] problem in this hobby is that it all got bonkers crazy and everyone's feeling like it's not worth it

[46:04] now and I don't know anyone who's gonna be like Chris you're wrong like George Gomez the problem with

[46:10] George Gomez is he can't explain to me why a Foo Fighters Toppers $2,000 see I'm willing to

[46:15] but I'm willing to listen to him about the price of wood the price of labor the price of electricity

[46:22] but George it's a fucking plastic topper right it's a fucking plastic topper and as I've always said

[46:30] a fucking quarter pounder with cheese is fucking delicious it's just as delicious at $50 as it is

[46:38] at $10 but I don't want to spend more than $10 on a quarter pounder with cheese you could charge me

[46:46] $50 and it's still delicious but I'm not fucking buying gang let's do this let's get the 20,000

[46:54] stars because you know what's gonna happen now is all the canada haters are being told what happened

[46:59] on this show and you know and now they're gonna come join and the thing that you can do for me

[47:06] the most it's not about these facebook stars because you know freaking apple and facebook take

[47:10] a cut but like join the show join canada's pinball podcast the more people that subscribe to my show

[47:18] the more people that like this that share this with their friends you know they say we're just

[47:22] bitching we're just bitching we're just bitching we're just bitching nobody's looking out for the

[47:26] for the consumers at all it's really dangerous what's happening in the you know in the world today

[47:31] it's like if we don't keep these for-profit companies somewhat accountable they will continue

[47:36] to squeeze us until we've got nothing left and look I want to get back to talking about pinball

[47:42] fun and the mechs and the magic but there's not magical mechs in john wick there's no magical

[47:47] mechs in john wick and that's it it saddens me I think that this cheap and cheerful this hobby

[47:56] was always it was it was so priced so perfectly and I think they saw what was happening around them

[48:04] and I'm not saying like there shouldn't have been price increases but they reached they reached

[48:10] what they needed the price increase to be and it was when godzilla was 10-5 and that's what it needed

[48:18] to be they know that they're still making gang remember the bomb on the game is like 3500

[48:24] they just shot past it like like way past it well jeng is you know I mean this will be I'll upload

[48:30] this audio for sure I mean this is I think this is the most explosive canada rant of all time

[48:37] but I hope you know that that I say this stuff and I speak this way because I do respect

[48:43] all the folks at these pinball companies but I think the bean counters and I think the shill

[48:49] content creators and you know who you are you're doing a disservice to what makes this hobby amazing

[48:58] and you know and I what I hate about the you know the fallback well we need we need to grow pinball

[49:04] how the fuck are you gonna grow pinball when you charge 13 fucking thousand dollars for a game

[49:10] how the fuck are you gonna grow pinball when two jersey jack c.e.'s are the price of a fucking car

[49:16] fuck off you want to grow a fucking hobby you got to reduce prices that brings more fucking people in

[49:25] and like I'm I think I was I think I was educated right I had the best private school boring school

[49:31] education's money could buy and it fucking led me here fuck my parents are disappointed

[49:37] but if you want to fucking grow pinball fucking lower the prices you want to grow pinball make it

[49:44] fucking more attractive for operators to put your games on location because they're not so

[49:48] fucking expensive if you want to grow pinball start picking better themes you had it pinball was

[49:56] pinball was growing so nicely and then you raise the prices so much that the core audience of pinball

[50:03] is now all feeling like fuck it's not worth it fuck it it's not worth it don't worry gang this is

[50:09] this is just the last saturday morning show before baby number two um i am not going to start

[50:15] becoming a cursing content creator but i it's just i just i just couldn't do this without without the

[50:23] bombs because i because i do want to tell them to fuck off fuck off i wish you guys the best i'm not

[50:29] buying i'm i'm encouraging my listeners not to buy at these prices and i think if you bought a john wick

[50:36] you've made a huge mistake because it's not you're gonna lose so much value and the only

[50:42] reason i say this because i'm looking at james bond food fighters and venom look at those games

[50:47] look at those games james bond is a theme with 60 years gang 60 years of fanbase

[50:55] thing lost three to four thousand dollars the code's great people love the layout why did lose

[51:00] three thousand dollars john earlick why because they fucking priced it three thousand dollars more

[51:05] than it fucking is worth the thing about this hobby and the thing that they don't want you to know

[51:11] and the thing that i always fall back on is it's the people that make the hobby great um i think

[51:17] we're all at the point now i think we're all at the point now where you guys all have enough pinball

[51:21] machine you all have enough pinball machines that you'll ever need right i mean that's like

[51:29] that's a given hold on a second i just need to get my charger

[51:32] here i think all of you have enough pinball machines that you ever will need um and so

[51:41] now you're gonna get your enjoyment a few different ways you're gonna get your enjoyment by you know

[51:47] enjoying pinball content which doesn't cost a lot of money you're gonna get your enjoyment by going

[51:52] to shows and playing on location you're gonna get your enjoyment by playing the games you own

[51:57] um and just exploring them more right i mean most of you have games where you haven't seen the end

[52:03] right you haven't got to the end you haven't got to the wizard mode um you absolutely can fall in

[52:08] love all over again with the great games you own you know that's not going to keep the new unboxed

[52:14] people happy it's not going to keep the line happy but who cares because now like you can get so

[52:22] much enjoyment from just the community which it doesn't cost you much and i think that's what um

[52:29] that's what i love about pinball is ultimately the most valuable thing is is like these these greedy

[52:35] executives can't take from us is that the most valuable thing is absolutely free like Derek is

[52:42] a good example my boy Derek here right and Derek congratulations on the move to california

[52:47] Derek plays his games right plays him like like five thousand ten thousand plays um keeps him in

[52:55] great condition you know no scuffs on the cabinet uh you know he we all know that his he lost seven

[53:01] thousand dollars on his godfather le and that that made him want to leave the hobby right it

[53:05] saddens me but like that's the truth like he just doesn't he's just over it um and like the Derek's

[53:12] my best friend okay so i i want to i want to Derek i hope you allow me to talk this freely um and

[53:17] greg colton you one of my greg colton is probably my best facebook buddy like him and i talk all the

[53:22] time um the friendships i've made in this hobby i can't put a price on it you know i don't need to

[53:31] buy a two thousand dollar topper an le like all the flexing of the games and the more rare versions

[53:37] means means jack shit right there's nothing none of that matters um once you get into pinball

[53:43] and you know once we know who the players are the companies are the games are um you know and we

[53:49] get to discuss uh you know the things we love about the games we love then we're all in it together

[53:55] but Derek's become my best friend we're like i talk to him every day like on the phone like not

[54:00] and that's why i love hobbies like this because they've brought so many of us together from all

[54:04] over the world and they've become like our extended family and somewhat like i bet a lot of you can

[54:11] relate to this a lot of us probably feel like our pinhead friends know us even better than

[54:17] some of our family members right john you are a great friend too um and what i hate seeing happen

[54:26] in pinball is just the distance now between what makes this hobby so beautiful and what these companies

[54:35] now are telling us we need to pay to get access to the new stuff i think it's just it's not worth it

[54:45] it's not worth it i think everyone is like been in pinball for the last you know 10 years

[54:50] is just raising a proverbial middle finger to these companies and i and i think they're gonna

[54:55] have to like wake up they're either gonna wake up or they're gonna have crappy sales and i don't feel

[55:06] and it's their fault it's their fault you know there's no more excuses co vid this co vid that

[55:13] like this that like cost of this like come on guys like they're continuing to make efficiencies in

[55:19] their products and their bombs have not increased sure some other costs might have gone up but so

[55:25] what not nearly as much as the games have gone up um all right so let's let's move on to some other

[55:33] stuff okay because i'm telling you like one of the reasons why fun house has been delayed is is nick

[55:39] parks is nervous nick parks is nervous why do you think fun house has already gone from $11,000 to

[55:46] $10,000 because they're nervous i mean the game looks stunning brian allen's artwork on this game

[55:53] i heard is absolutely phenomenal i heard brian allen just crushed it but it's a fun house right

[56:02] it's gonna be revealed next week i think i think it's gonna i think next to john wick fun house is

[56:08] gonna like absolutely be like the game that looks like it's worth the 10 g's

[56:17] it was always 10k no it wasn't kid kid chrisso i have i have email correspondence from andrea

[56:24] paredre two distros with the three models it was there was a rid they they killed a model man don't

[56:30] don't it wasn't always 10k there was an $11,000 model with a topper so like and i i could i'm

[56:38] not going to reveal my sources but if that was emailed out from andrea paredre two distros so

[56:43] don't tell me it was always 10k i don't care i'm glad they lowered the price i'm glad they lowered

[56:51] the price but you know still not cheap it's not cheap you know i mean a lot of $10,000 plus games

[57:03] out there in the market you know like elton john should be selling better but it's not because

[57:08] it's overpriced it's like i think there's like a there's gotta be there's gotta be a way to get

[57:19] a banger game out into the pinball marketplace for $8,000 there's just gotta be

[57:30] i don't know i don't i really don't know man i don't know what happened i mean all i know is

[57:34] like they were eight they used to be able to do it now they somehow can't do it right and they used

[57:39] to be able to make a game pack like wizard of Oz and pirates and now they just don't seem to be able

[57:42] to do it so i don't know what happened like did the creativity just die did the mechanical know

[57:47] how died did the did the enthusiasm to make games that loaded die or did the i don't know you know

[57:57] i mean ninja clip $7,000 or what is it like $6,994 i just i don't understand who's buying these things

[58:05] you know it's it's gonna be brutal man it's gonna be brutal and i think i think a lot of people are

[58:12] gonna hear this and they're gonna put their money back in their wallet and you know you just

[58:19] you're just not gonna be able to like defend the prices and that's

[58:26] and like i know there's like distributors with shows and there's people that get

[58:30] make their money selling these things you know i had a good chat with Jeff Cervera over at Mad

[58:36] Pinball we had a really good talk this week um i had posted something like John Wick is the worst

[58:42] selling game in 20 years or something which i heard from a major distributor um and he he was

[58:48] like canada you're a clown like it's not right okay so i was like all right well jeff i don't

[58:52] want to appreciate you calling me a clown but that's what i heard from a major distributor

[58:55] but anyway we had a really good phone conversation probably for like a half hour um jeff is a great

[59:00] guy and you know ultimately nobody wants these high prices nobody why why would a distributor

[59:09] want to make it harder to sell games why would a distributor want to see people buy products and

[59:18] lose so much money because they know they're not going to come back and buy again you know i'm saying

[59:23] like you know it's it's sad it's like i'll use the example of James Bond 60th right it's like

[59:30] when that game came out and it was $19,999 right right you know there there were like

[59:43] distributors saying that it was priced perfectly right trying to get the hype trying to get the

[59:48] fomo all the reasons why it was priced perfectly so they they sold some right people bought them for

[59:54] 20 grand it's now worth 11 or 12 right so like if i talked to you into buying this stock for $20

[01:00:05] a share and then a year later it's worth $11 a share are you are you listening to me again

[01:00:14] are you trusting my advice are you listening to my podcast are you going to watch my videos

[01:00:21] are you going to are you going to like support me are you going to trust me ever again

[01:00:27] and that's it and the reason why canada's pinball podcast has more subscribers and every single pinball

[01:00:32] content creator combined why why do you think that is because i'm advocating to take the prices down

[01:00:39] i'm calling out these bs moves these companies make when they overcharge us for toppers and

[01:00:45] and they like and haggis pinball lies to us for like three years about delivery dates and

[01:00:52] you know do we you know i question these things and when a game is great like godzilla it's a great

[01:00:58] game it's a great game when i play stranger things and it's like wow like that UV kit wow

[01:01:05] that's what i want to be talking about like wow did you see that moment and that's what

[01:01:10] john wick doesn't have like we can beat around this i watched tim sexton talking for an hour

[01:01:18] i didn't see anything that happened in john wick that was like wow i didn't see one wow thing

[01:01:24] and i feel like nervous saying that but like it's true i didn't see one wow moment in john wick

[01:01:28] i didn't see one moment where like the lights did something interesting i didn't see one moment

[01:01:33] i didn't see one moment where a mech did something interesting i didn't see one moment where like

[01:01:38] callouts or the game went crazy or there was any like real sense of being in a neon city i didn't

[01:01:44] see one moment that was wow i heard them keep talking about collectors like again that's that's

[01:01:51] all it's become is just bs code calculus garbage that you have to try to learn a god damn bible

[01:02:00] full of rule sets to unlock like what's in those guys heads but like you know if that's not what

[01:02:06] pinball is supposed to be pinball is supposed to be like wow like what's happening under that glass

[01:02:13] is wow you know when that UV kit hits and stranger things wow moment man when that projector is going

[01:02:22] it's pretty wow when that t-rex eats that ball it's wow when that you know when that uh building

[01:02:30] in godzilla goes up and down and all the different pathways in godzilla that's wow i mean you know

[01:02:34] a game has a lot of wow just like just from the shots alone it's the code's terrible because it's

[01:02:41] too complex but like man the shots and avengers are wow when i when i play avengers it is like

[01:02:47] it's like a roller coaster ride like looking at what's in

[01:02:52] john wick compared to avengers boring like snooze fest snooze fest when i see that ring

[01:03:00] grab the ball in midair and then pull it through the back of the game in lord of the rings

[01:03:06] or ball rock swings out and the music's going to war and like oh wow i didn't see any of that

[01:03:15] yesterday i'm not allowed to say this stuff

[01:03:22] and either they bring that wow and they start understanding that these games they need to

[01:03:27] start designing them where the games themselves have personality it's just feeling flat it's flat

[01:03:36] like john wick is a flat game you can see it it's flat it's mono it's it's it's it's one dimensional

[01:03:41] it's monochromatic it's like it just you just don't i don't feel like john wick at the machine

[01:03:49] you know like when you start the game it should be like you killed my fucking dog

[01:03:53] like there should be like get in it there's nothing there's nothing it's just like all

[01:03:59] this stuff's happening like it's just it's just it's just i know michael michael huntsman

[01:04:05] well you know look it's sometimes i feel like i'm on an island here saying this stuff but i know

[01:04:12] i'm not i know like i know people are gonna watch this throughout the day and it's it's gonna get

[01:04:19] i think if there's any facebook live that i get i get comments on it's gonna be this one

[01:04:26] but you know you just can't go from like a bali williams period where there was all this wow

[01:04:35] happening in the games mechanically the codes were shallow but that's because remember those games

[01:04:39] were designed to wow us in an arcade environment you know from three to five minutes experiences

[01:04:45] that's it they weren't meant to be owned at home you know now the games have home ownership sure

[01:04:50] but you can have both you can have the physical wow and you can have the code that gives you

[01:04:56] longevity that's called godzilla that's called stranger things that's called loratherings that's

[01:05:03] called tron oh by the way i just let my patreon subscribers know this but since we have about

[01:05:11] 100 people here tron vault edition 100 coming john borg is working on it it's coming it's going to be

[01:05:19] like tron leon crack it's coming it's coming it's not a it's not an if it's coming it's just a matter

[01:05:28] when now if you have a tron le that you think is worth 18 000 might be a good time to sell it

[01:05:40] because they're making enhancements to it

[01:05:42] yeah well two years ago a lot of stuff got put on the back burner

[01:05:52] john borg's working on it why would he be working on it

[01:05:59] i'm just saying like trust me it's coming because you know when george gomez says

[01:06:07] if there's demand there we want to make it and the problem now i think with stern is

[01:06:13] collectors don't want to hear well if there's more demand we'll just make more

[01:06:20] like that's not that's the last thing a collector wants to hear especially guys who buy le's

[01:06:25] and that's the only fomo there is i don't understand because i don't this is like the part that i just

[01:06:29] it always confused me why would there be fomo around a pro or a premium there's no fomo there

[01:06:33] so the only fomo that exists is around the limited edition or the collector's edition right

[01:06:38] and for those people to feel good in their fomo and secure and their heavy investment in your product

[01:06:44] what they want to hear is that you're never making any more again what they want to hear is

[01:06:48] that even if the demand over time increases for this we are still not making more but that's not

[01:06:57] what george gomez is saying he's like we're listening to the demand and and we want to you

[01:07:02] know bring out like stuff where there's demand i don't know george tron had it's i would rather

[01:07:09] him say we made tron we love seeing the fact that there's still demand for that game like 15 years

[01:07:16] later but we're never making more and i hope everyone who has one enjoys it and and it becomes

[01:07:22] like a centerpiece of their stern collection he doesn't talk like that no he keeps the door wide

[01:07:27] open to screw over those le owners you know when when they sold 500 drastic park le's and all those

[01:07:34] le owners were feeling great right they had a game they loved it it was bolted to the ground

[01:07:41] they had an le they felt special it was a centerpiece of their collection the games were starting to go

[01:07:47] way up in value right 16 000 17 000 and they were never going to sell them and it was just nice

[01:07:53] knowing that it was just nice knowing that one day i wanted to sell this i now have a game that

[01:08:00] might be worth almost double what i paid for it it's great right you need some stocks to double

[01:08:05] for to to absorb the losses because not every game goes up yeah it was all the way up to 18 000

[01:08:11] and then what did they do they made a nicer version of the game with better artwork another 500

[01:08:17] which made all the original owners not want theirs anymore and then all of them tanked and now you

[01:08:22] can go get a new drastic park 30th le for like 10 5 so they that's an 8 000 loss

[01:08:32] because they got greedy did they need to do that did they need to did they need to burn those 500

[01:08:38] faithful owners just to make another quick buck

[01:08:47] so i just i don't know how you feel good about this stuff gang i don't know like i don't know why

[01:08:52] i don't want to talk to george gomez about lions gate licensing i believe him when he says that

[01:08:57] stuff what i can't believe is how you get to a two thousand dollar price tag on a foo fighter topper

[01:09:06] you know i i don't understand why you thought it'd be a good idea to make more drastic park le's

[01:09:13] everything should have a time and a place and if you just keep remaking them you destroy what

[01:09:20] like makes things special

[01:09:25] absolutely gregg every value proposition of every le now is destroyed there's no

[01:09:31] fomo around any of them anymore and without fomo and this is the thing i think set date

[01:09:36] this doesn't get because he doesn't know pinball he came from other industries if you lose the fomo

[01:09:42] like the hype drop moment right of a new product that fomo needs to that game needs to sell out

[01:09:49] pretty much within the first week that will that will lift up all of your sales of

[01:09:55] you know premiums and pros because there's no there's no more of the ellies to get so i'm

[01:10:00] going to get this but every day now every week those john wick ellies sit unsold it makes everyone

[01:10:07] realize it's it's not a stock that's going anywhere north i mean that's all it is

[01:10:12] and everyone was winning it was a win-win for stern the distros and the consumers

[01:10:22] it was a win-win i mean you know a distributor wants to see gregg colton buy a game for 8500

[01:10:31] and if it's a hot game maybe gregg makes a few grand and if it's not a hot game

[01:10:37] gregg gets out for 8 right and gregg gets his 500 plays a thousand plays and he didn't feel like

[01:10:43] he lost anything but nowadays it's like gregg gets in at 13 when he goes if he wants to sell it he's

[01:10:53] getting nine and that's just on one game so if he does that three times in a row he's losing 12

[01:11:00] dollars on three stern ellies that that's the endofomo

[01:11:08] it's the endofomo

[01:11:12] um i love doing this content i love this being a distraction from everything else going on in life

[01:11:22] i think that pinball will be fine i think the market is going to force these companies to adjust

[01:11:31] i think the consumers are exhausted i think they are i think you can read it on pinside you can see

[01:11:40] it on facebook there's not enough super rich fat cats who don't care about losing three to four

[01:11:47] thousand dollars every game um to create growth to absorb the volume of of these ellies and and the

[01:11:55] number of premiums they need to sell i think distros are really need to get together you know they

[01:12:03] need to like it's like reverse collusion they need to get together to lower the prices with these

[01:12:07] manufacturers they need to push back you know i'm saying like like they need to push back against

[01:12:13] the manufacturers i can't i'm not gonna buy your product anymore if you need me to sell it for this

[01:12:20] much money and and that's to me the 2024 pinball battleground you know as we wait for stuff like

[01:12:28] harry potter and muppets and and back to the future you know i'm i'm happy to wait

[01:12:39] guys let's do something here okay i i mean this when i say this because i'm seeing donald saying

[01:12:45] stuff about jeng is and jeng is saying stuff about guns and um i i i really think everybody needs to

[01:12:53] just let's just let all the gun gate stuff go all right let's let's not let's not hold on the anger

[01:13:01] towards anybody around that topic the topic never should have been even a topic like stern should have

[01:13:08] have shown the clips of the game we never would have had gun gate um you know if jeng is over in

[01:13:14] denmark and he's anti gun and you're in america and you are a gun a gun enthusiast it's okay like i

[01:13:21] think it's okay that we live in a world where people can have opposing viewpoints on something

[01:13:26] um what we shouldn't be doing and and this is where i think everybody got a little bit maybe a lot of

[01:13:33] maybe a lot of it they got it wrong i don't think we should be insulting people for either one of those

[01:13:41] opinions right uh it's why i don't i'm not coming out here and saying like you're an idiot if you

[01:13:47] like guns and you're an idiot if you don't understand second amendment and you're you know you're a

[01:13:50] snowflake socialist no i know let's just all use this saturday morning as a moment to realize

[01:13:57] a lot of us have differences of opinions around these things let's not focus on that okay let's

[01:14:05] keep our energy and our attention on the topic in which brings us all here okay because i can't tell

[01:14:12] you the amount of times people come at me and say stuff that is like either sexist or homophobic

[01:14:20] or this or that and i'm like i'm not i'm not engaging this and i'm also not here to try to

[01:14:28] change you on that level like you know everyone here is a grown adult i think we're this is a place

[01:14:34] and will always be a sanctuary away from all the garbage we're trying to avoid

[01:14:42] okay and look yes look there's gonna be consequences right and and shawn like

[01:14:49] if if you know kary hardy lost some fans jeng has lost some fans i mean that's the truth

[01:14:54] that's the truth like through all of this isn't it crazy like through all of this debate and all

[01:15:00] of this controversy i've actually gained a lot of fans this last couple weeks and i haven't taken

[01:15:06] a real hard stance on this stuff uh i'm just trying to cover it like to me there was like a

[01:15:13] little bit of a gun gate issue i think jormit gomez clarified the issue for me it was dead

[01:15:19] there like i did two shows back to back at first i said that stern was firing blanks with no guns

[01:15:25] you know woke john wick john woke whatever and then i'm like oh okay gomez clarified boom to me

[01:15:30] it was over like that thing was over in 24 hours um you know i think we all should just be like

[01:15:40] you know it's it's um there's that scene in the transformer movie we're like we're we're optimus and

[01:15:46] and you know rodimus i gotta get the scene right it's rodimus and and galvatron right like these two

[01:15:56] vehemently opposed points of view and beliefs and they're like we're we're allies now against a common

[01:16:03] foe and what i think everybody should do as we get ready to turn off this very crazy episode of

[01:16:11] saturday morning's spectacular we should all just at least be allies against the common foe

[01:16:18] of ridiculous prices these companies are ripping us off we need to get the prices to come down or

[01:16:27] we need a significant investment in the bomb and in the innovations and in the physical game of pinball

[01:16:34] again because if it's just lights and lcd and internet connections and downloadable content as

[01:16:40] the future of this hobby they can have it i'm not doing this i will just go buy a dvd player

[01:16:48] i will just go play xbox with $50 games that is not what makes people love pinball

[01:16:57] i will say i did find kary's video funny where he sped up jengas's voice

[01:17:03] to sound like mickey mouse a lot of mickey mouse voices this week um i was like jeg is

[01:17:08] you're gonna take that you're gonna take that from kary um but yeah i mean we all should just be

[01:17:16] telling these companies to f off at these prices and we should stop fighting each other sucks there's

[01:17:23] no more twippies man what's collin doing man is anyone even like did everybody unsubscribe to

[01:17:29] this week in pinball like i i don't even like i don't even know what happened to that site and to

[01:17:34] the kineticists like i don't even talk about it anymore because like it's become as irrelevant

[01:17:38] as like like that dude didn't even get invited like like b kong has got more access than than

[01:17:45] that dude um i don't care man like i people were like you're jealous you didn't get in it i i'm

[01:17:51] stern's not going to invite me to unveil a game for them guys like i don't want i wouldn't even take

[01:17:56] that invite i've got to remain neutral i've got to stay where i'm at they didn't invite jason nap

[01:18:03] though and that's bs um jason's a great guy has the best pinball media site i think you know you

[01:18:11] read jason nap's site you go to pinside for just shits and giggles and then you listen to canada

[01:18:18] and you've got all you need to know i mean i'm doing like three shows a week real time when

[01:18:22] stuff happens like nobody else is doing that nobody else is doing that nobody and nobody's

[01:18:28] nobody's mixing it up like this nobody's talking the real real right and i know that's why you're

[01:18:32] here it's like just real i mean i i would love for someone to say to me christ you understand

[01:18:37] like stern prices should be this like nobody's gonna say that nobody but i think as we end this

[01:18:45] episode let's just all not buy for a while and see what happens watch them lower their prices

[01:18:56] that is exactly what will happen they won't go out of business they will just lower their prices

[01:19:00] because they're they're making more than enough and they know that

[01:19:04] everybody thank you for being here on saturday um i think i should upload the audio of this show

[01:19:11] for my fans i'll do it right now i think i might have blown a blood vessel or two but i think i just

[01:19:20] said what had to be said and you know it is what it is i think it was a great show

[01:19:24] i think it was the best show ever anthony good joan wick is a good game godzilla is a great game

[01:19:32] donald donald donald donald you gotta be kinder empathy and kindness donald you gotta learn a

[01:19:42] little bit of that you you know what i'm saying everybody enjoy there's a question from b kong

[01:19:53] in the chat is be here and thank you guys for the 8400 stars oh come on we can get to 10 000 stars

[01:20:02] after all of this heat before i go um what was his question

[01:20:12] what was the question from well god can someone just be con what did you say hold on

[01:20:16] i'm looking i'm looking i'm looking i'm scrolling oh here i go i have a genuine question you did

[01:20:25] complain about me and vik getting a chance to play john wick what would you have liked to see

[01:20:29] for a first impressions video given one hour of time to interview stern and play the game that would

[01:20:35] have appeased the corp pinball community um all right be be good question so here's the thing be

[01:20:46] i think um i think the issue and thank you for the stars i think the issue was nothing you're

[01:20:53] going to create would really appease the pinball community and i'll explain why because you're not

[01:21:00] yet a content creator for the pinball community i i know you're getting into it and you got to

[01:21:07] start somewhere but getting this level of access when stern ignored all the pinball content creators

[01:21:16] sets you up for failure so there's nothing you and vik could have done i mean at least vicks whole

[01:21:23] thing seems to be more pinball lately and i don't always agree with vicks you know top or

[01:21:28] hack up decisions but that's the thing be is like you well here's what annoyed us be i'm going to be

[01:21:35] completely candid a lot of us have spent so many hours of our lives and years of our lives making

[01:21:44] tons of pinball content and stern ignored all those people and then when we saw your face like i

[01:21:51] got to play john wick in a very like you know like like animate it with like comic sans font like

[01:21:58] and then you were driving people to subscribe to hear your take on our thing you know i'm saying

[01:22:06] like that's that's the thing be is like you should not have been the first line of information for us

[01:22:14] that and it because it's our thing and it's not an entitlement thing man and it's like it's like

[01:22:18] who are you to pinball community and again we're happy you're here but it's like you've got to earn

[01:22:27] like the respect of the community before you know you're highlighting the products on a launch

[01:22:35] like that's the thing it was like i was like i was like imagine this be like you don't even cover cars

[01:22:39] right we use a car you mean you don't really cover cars you've been covering watches your whole life

[01:22:43] but part but there's crossover right between car fanatics and watch fanatics and there is

[01:22:48] then all of a sudden like lamborghini has their newest lamborghini and all of a sudden it's not the

[01:22:55] car media that's introducing us to it it's a watch guy so that's the thing is because be it's like

[01:23:02] you you know i don't think you have and it's a weird place to be in because i also i don't really

[01:23:10] know i don't even think be like they needed vic or you or anybody i think they needed to just show

[01:23:16] the game like they were fully capable of just showing us the game because here's what was annoying

[01:23:21] being because because b you don't know you don't know what it's like right i'm gonna i'm gonna give

[01:23:27] you like a real quick and i know then i know we're over but i want to i want you to i want to answer

[01:23:31] this thoughtfully um you don't know what it's like b where a company wants you to make a 13 000

[01:23:39] dollar decision in like one day right you've made arcade one-up stuff it's like 300 bucks

[01:23:45] stern pinball's marketing has always been this we're gonna give you as little information as we

[01:23:50] can about a product and we all for so many years we had to make a decision within a day

[01:23:57] whether or not we committed to buying a super expensive elite right and so we need as much

[01:24:03] information on that first day as that we can get and so then when you're introducing john wick the

[01:24:10] way you did with like over-the-shoulder gameplay like just zack sharp like smiling it wasn't enough

[01:24:17] info like and it was like and that and again it just it's just more of a i think you got thrown

[01:24:23] into a marketing model that's been annoying people for a really long time and then you were an

[01:24:28] unfamiliar face and and they ignored all the familiar faces and i'll say this the the social

[01:24:36] media agency that stern hired should be fired because i've worked at social media agencies

[01:24:44] i've worked building media lists for launch moments you would never leave off the core media

[01:24:50] you know they jumped right to the you know you would be a second tier invite and it's not to say

[01:24:56] you wouldn't be invited you'd all you'd absolutely be invited but like first and foremost it would be

[01:25:01] like who are the core pinball media that we need to get that we need to hit they they just ignored

[01:25:07] all those people and then they went right to like the second tier and that's why i think people are

[01:25:13] just like what what wasn't going to be me but like there's no way be that you should have had more

[01:25:19] details on john wick than jason nap and that's that's it it was just the optics of it all and that's

[01:25:26] it how much pinball content is being made where is all this content well look guys you're not going

[01:25:37] to expand pinball because b puts up some videos you're not going to expand pinball when prices

[01:25:44] are this ridiculous to me it's a it's a moot point it's a moot point you're not going to expand pinball

[01:25:51] because you just buy ads in more places or get more content creators to create like you know ad like

[01:25:59] you know videos celebrating the product it's just not going to happen and all they've done on this

[01:26:06] launch for every new be that that content attracted they pissed off their core buyer and their core

[01:26:15] you know content creation creators and b it's not you know it's it's again i don't think it's on you

[01:26:22] i think you guys had no idea what was going on but but gang it's not about exposure like there's

[01:26:30] not there's not like a lack of awareness that there's pinball machines in the world like

[01:26:35] people just don't get this like i deal with this every day it's like bud light thinking they're

[01:26:40] going to reach new consumers if they do this the same way as certain's thinking the same way

[01:26:46] stern is losing its core audience the moves they're making recently they're hemorrhaging their core

[01:26:52] audience what are you talking about kongs are us let me let me explain something to you kongs are us

[01:27:02] has zero credibility in the pinball community i don't understand like what pinball community you

[01:27:10] guys are reaching is it like arcade one-up pinball machines but like who the who is this guy who is

[01:27:17] this like rafael rafael guy rafael i've been covering pinball for 10 years kongs are us has

[01:27:25] never come up once like you sound like you sound like and like i don't know what you're even basing

[01:27:32] this on he's known now john ehrlich i don't really like gang i got to be honest all of this john wick

[01:27:41] launch was terrible it was a fumbled launch and it's it's um it's divided everybody in all these

[01:27:49] dumb ways and underneath it all is is is not a spectacular game and that's just the end of it

[01:27:55] and they need to lower the prices the prices don't work for a game like this um and you know i'm i

[01:28:01] don't i i welcome any and all pinball content creators but i think stern's marketing department

[01:28:07] absolutely flub this thing and i think the conversations we've had this week are a prime

[01:28:12] example of a botched marketing launch okay all right guys later have a good saturday

[01:28:22] canada's pinball again it's gonna bring you down

[01:28:36] it's making the fault
