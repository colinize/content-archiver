[00:25] Welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:28] I'm your host, Canadian.

[00:29] On this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast, we are going to do the 2021 pinball year in review.

[00:36] What kind of year was it, right?

[00:38] How many games came out where manufacturers struggling to get products out the door,

[00:44] pinflation hit us really hard, deep root pinball collapsed.

[00:48] When you really write it all down on one piece of paper and you see this is how many games came out

[00:53] and this is the kind of year it was.

[00:55] It is a very interesting year to discuss in the pinball world.

[01:00] So let's go right into it right now.

[01:02] What kind of year was 2021 for pinball?

[01:05] Well, let's look at the games that came out.

[01:07] Let's just go down a list of these were all of the games that shipped to customers in 2021.

[01:14] We had Led Zeppelin.

[01:15] We had Mandalorian.

[01:17] We had Godzilla.

[01:18] We have Jurassic Park home edition.

[01:21] We've got what else?

[01:22] We've got Guns and Roses machines were going out the door.

[01:26] We have Halloween and Ultraman.

[01:28] We have no cactus Canyon remakes.

[01:30] We have Legends of Vahala.

[01:33] We had some Celts being put together by Haggis Pinball.

[01:36] We had P3 Multimorphic sending out some Heist machines.

[01:40] We had Alien SE.

[01:42] We have the big La Bousskeap.

[01:44] That's a lot of machines, right?

[01:46] But when you added all up and you look at all of these games and you just asked the very macro question,

[01:51] was it a year in which we got a lot of magical and ultra creative pinball machines?

[01:58] I would argue that Godzilla is the main attraction this year in the pinball world and everything else was sort of in the shadow of that big lizard.

[02:07] But let's do this.

[02:08] Let's go down the list of every manufacturer and talk about what kind of year I think they had.

[02:14] Because I do think it's a little bit of a mixed bag in 2021.

[02:17] I think every single pinball company experienced demand like never before, right?

[02:24] If you could put a pinball machine in a box, there were way more people who are ready to buy that game than you could supply.

[02:31] So there was demand through the roof and supply was very limited.

[02:36] So we saw stuff like Legends of Vahala like sell out immediately.

[02:40] And that is why in this marketplace we saw prices of used games skyrocketing.

[02:46] We saw games like Pirates of the Caribbean collectors edition a game that sat in a box for a year for $12,500 that nobody wanted it for a year.

[02:57] Now is selling for $36 to $40,000.

[03:01] We saw games like Ghostbusters, Ellie, double in price.

[03:04] We saw games like Stranger Things, Ellie.

[03:07] They were on eBay, Ellie's up Stranger Things for almost eight months.

[03:12] Nobody wanted them.

[03:13] And now a Stranger Things, Ellie, new in box would sell for $15 to $20,000, right?

[03:20] The entire pinball marketplace is hotter than hot.

[03:24] And so in this extremely hot market, does that mean that everyone succeeded?

[03:29] Does that mean everyone reached their goals?

[03:31] Does that mean we had an amazing 2021?

[03:34] Well, let's go down the list right now.

[03:36] So I was going to start with Stern, but let's go from the bottom up.

[03:39] Because I think it's more fun to end with the big dog.

[03:43] So we are going to start from the bottom up.

[03:46] And I'm going to go through each pinball company and say what kind of 2021 I think they had.

[03:51] And I think I'm going to do it from a couple of vantage points.

[03:54] I think as a business, what kind of year did they have?

[03:57] And just from a public relations consumer standpoint, how do I think the community viewed this company in 2021?

[04:05] And I'm going to do my best to channel all of your thoughts.

[04:08] And if you disagree with anything I say, just hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com.

[04:14] Before we go into each company, we are going to start 2021 with the one major company that didn't make it,

[04:22] that failed in a colossal way.

[04:24] And that is the downfall of deep root pinball and what this did to the pinball community.

[04:29] Now, I would argue that most people, most people saw through this company on day one.

[04:36] That is why most people did not order Raza when Robert Mueller opened up the order banks.

[04:42] They only sold an embarrassingly low number of 122 Raza's.

[04:48] That was proof enough that everyone saw through this BS.

[04:52] And so in 2021, we finally saw the collapse of deep root, the SEC filing.

[04:59] And it was much worse than anybody thought.

[05:03] This guy stole $60 million from other investors.

[05:07] And this company was a fraud.

[05:10] It was a scam.

[05:11] And I still believe to this day that more people involved with this company should have came out and said stuff earlier on.

[05:19] Instead, they brought more people on board.

[05:22] But the good news is this is that most people got their money back.

[05:25] Most people got their credit card chargebacks.

[05:28] And ultimately, the pinball community was not impacted that bad.

[05:33] It's all those poor old ladies that sent quarter million dollar checks to Robert that lost their life savings.

[05:41] And I do think that there is a little bit of a dark stain on the pinball community that we allowed J-pop another chance.

[05:48] That we weren't more vocal, that we weren't more upfront in shutting this thing down from the very beginning.

[05:55] And I think a lot of the people in the pinball community that join forces with Robert Mueller have some responsibility

[06:02] and have some accountability to creating the entity that took all this money from outside people that had no idea they were investing in pinball.

[06:12] But you know what, let's put a final nail in this coffin.

[06:15] Deep root is done.

[06:16] And Robert Mueller should be in jail.

[06:18] What a dramatic ending to this joke of a company and a joke of a man who thought he can make more games

[06:24] in one year than Stern pinball.

[06:27] Bye bye Bobby, it's over.

[06:29] Okay, so let's go from the bottom up.

[06:31] Home pin, Mike over there in Taiwan has said that he is making spinal tap pinball.

[06:37] Now we have not seen anything other than a few teasers that he was contractually obligated to get out the door.

[06:44] So it's basically another dead year for Home pin pinball.

[06:47] This is a company that is really in probably last place in the entire pinball world.

[06:53] And so do we think spinal tap will be any good in 2022?

[06:57] I really don't know.

[06:59] From the pictures I've seen, I don't think this company can compete on any level with what's in the pinball marketplace

[07:07] and with so many companies providing products.

[07:10] Why would you send your money here?

[07:12] That's just my thoughts on Home pin.

[07:14] I don't think spinal taps going to be a game that wins many people over.

[07:18] Alright, Dutch pinball, the big Lebowski, what kind of year did Dutch pinball have?

[07:23] Well, it's sort of like the same year over and over and over for Dutch.

[07:28] It is kind of like a Groundhog Day reporting on this company.

[07:32] They are slowly getting big Lebowski's out to people.

[07:36] There are still a lot of EA's that are old games.

[07:41] And I would have liked to have seen them made more EA's whole, but I didn't.

[07:46] So what kind of year did this company have?

[07:48] I think this is a company that just wants to get these games done.

[07:52] And then I don't think we're ever going to see a game too from Dutch pinball.

[07:57] I just don't. I really don't.

[07:58] I don't know how long they can keep this up with the price of raw materials going through the roof in 2021.

[08:06] I also think this whole charging more to make the old buyers whole isn't really working out in their favor.

[08:14] So I think Dutch just had another Dutch year.

[08:17] I don't think most people care about Dutch that much anymore.

[08:20] And I don't think there's much attention on this game.

[08:24] And I think they have nobody else to blame, but themselves.

[08:27] Alright, pinball brothers, alien pinball.

[08:30] Remember they announced this way back in December.

[08:34] They said we're going to be making alien pinball with an Italian manufacturer.

[08:39] And I will say this, if you're the pinball brothers, you got it done.

[08:43] You made the games, you started getting games to people,

[08:47] you just revealed your LV version of the game.

[08:50] And you know, look, what kind of year did they have?

[08:53] I think this is a sort of like mixed bag year for the pinball brothers.

[08:57] I think they got games out the door, but I think communication with their customers was pretty piss poor.

[09:03] I think anyone who was in on these games doesn't really feel ultra satisfied

[09:08] with the buying experience from the pinball brothers.

[09:11] And if you ordered this game, you kind of knew you were going on a journey.

[09:15] That was very ambiguous.

[09:17] You did not know when you were going to get your game.

[09:20] You were probably told the ship is on the ocean, but who knows?

[09:24] You know, when you read the threads about alien pinball,

[09:27] it's such a mixture of this is the greatest, most immersive game of all time.

[09:32] And I'm having all these quality control issues.

[09:35] Or I'm not sure when I'm getting my game.

[09:37] These guys don't communicate on any level.

[09:40] I ordered it so long ago.

[09:42] I've waited a year for my game.

[09:44] You know, so you've got alien.

[09:45] It's just another game that has been around for so long

[09:49] that has a little bit of a sorted history.

[09:52] And it's another product that I think most of us out there just don't care about.

[09:57] We just don't care about these failed pinball launches that keep relaunching and relaunching.

[10:03] Now, if you want a unique game,

[10:05] yeah, go get an alien pinball machine and I hope it doesn't break down.

[10:09] But then they also had an interesting 2021

[10:12] because we saw that they had queen pinball.

[10:15] And we saw that they brought it out to this like queen pop-up store celebrating the band.

[10:20] And do we think we're going to see queen pinball from the pinball brothers in 2022?

[10:25] It's another one.

[10:26] When you look at the game, maybe five years ago,

[10:30] this kind of product looked impressive.

[10:32] But in 2021, 2022,

[10:36] with what is coming out in the pinball marketplace,

[10:39] it looks dated, it looks a bit stale,

[10:42] it doesn't look like a modern pinball machine.

[10:46] So I bet the pinball brothers are satisfied they got games out the door.

[10:49] But I bet they're also like, this is really hard.

[10:53] This isn't as easy as we thought it would be.

[10:55] And I'm not sure they're going to stay in it for the long run.

[10:58] I'm really not.

[11:00] We'll see what happens.

[11:01] But I've been feeling the pinball brothers are going to fulfill all of their alien orders.

[11:05] And that might be it for the pinball brothers.

[11:07] All right.

[11:07] Okay, P3 multi-morphic.

[11:09] How is 2021 for Jerry and the P3 multi-morphic platform?

[11:13] Well, how many people out there show of hands have a P3 multi-morphic?

[11:18] This isn't a huge volume platform.

[11:20] I don't know how many they've sold to date.

[11:22] If I were to guesstimate how many P3s have been sold,

[11:26] I would say it's south of 300 units.

[11:30] Now Stern makes more pinball machines in a week

[11:32] than maybe Jerry has sold in seven or eight years.

[11:35] It is a very, very niche platform.

[11:38] And the heist is definitely like their best offering to date.

[11:41] But as we know, nothing they've made to date

[11:45] has created a surge in demand for the product.

[11:48] And you know, I think we all were expecting in 2021

[11:52] for them to reveal their license theme.

[11:54] We didn't get it.

[11:55] We didn't get it at Expo.

[11:57] Maybe we'll get it at T-P-F.

[11:59] But it was pretty much a stale year for P3 multi-morphic.

[12:04] It also probably was a year in which Jerry was delivered

[12:08] a pretty harsh financial blow

[12:10] with spooky pinball moving away from the P-Rock platform.

[12:14] I'm pretty sure P-Rock drives all the big Lebowski's.

[12:17] Charlie was using P-Rock boards and all of his Rick and Morty's.

[12:20] And so, 1,750 spooky games did not place an order with P-Rock.

[12:27] Charlie went with Ben Heck's system.

[12:29] So it definitely was a year in which Jerry took a financial hit.

[12:32] All right, Haggis Pimball.

[12:35] What kind of 2021 did Haggis Pimball have now?

[12:39] Look, we all know what Haggis has been going through.

[12:42] This company in 2021, they came out

[12:45] and they said they were remaking Fathom.

[12:47] They were making this beautiful mermaid edition.

[12:50] They were making 250 of them.

[12:52] We know the story.

[12:54] They took money.

[12:55] They took pre-order dollars.

[12:57] Those pre-order dollars were non-refundable.

[12:59] They said production would start in July.

[13:02] July, August, September, October, November, December.

[13:06] Now, Damien is saying that January

[13:09] is when production will start on Fathom.

[13:11] I asked a few weeks ago if production was going to start in January,

[13:16] could you show us pictures of the parts

[13:18] because you can't start making this game

[13:20] unless you have the parts in house.

[13:22] Nobody really feels strong enough to ask that question

[13:26] and he has not shared with the community

[13:28] where the parts are for the game.

[13:30] Instead, he's sending out Christmas cards.

[13:32] Now, what kind of year was it for Haggis Pimball?

[13:35] I'm not going to beat around the bush.

[13:36] This was a bad year for Haggis Pimball.

[13:38] They staffed up.

[13:40] They got into this big factory.

[13:42] They hired 20 employees.

[13:44] And then COVID really locked stuff up for them.

[13:47] I mean, COVID really did hit Australia really, really hard.

[13:51] And the lockdowns there were much more harsh

[13:54] than other parts of the world.

[13:55] So this was kind of like a nightmarish year

[13:58] if you're Haggis Pimball.

[14:00] There is no way around it.

[14:01] They got a few keltz out the door.

[14:03] But for the most part, Haggis Pimball has been burning money

[14:07] and has not been able to make Fathom.

[14:10] And so hopefully, in 2022, they can turn a corner

[14:14] and start getting the game on the line

[14:17] that they took money for six months ago.

[14:20] But I bet Damien is having a lot of sleepless nights

[14:23] and I bet he is really feeling the pain

[14:25] of Pimball manufacturing.

[14:27] I think he ran into it with the best of intentions.

[14:30] I don't think he's in this to rip people off.

[14:32] But I think he's learned how hard it really is.

[14:36] It's one thing to make a few keltz.

[14:39] It's another thing to say you're going to make 500 of another game.

[14:43] And it's an even harder thing to start planning games three, four, and five.

[14:47] And you're scaling up for the future

[14:50] but you haven't figured out how to make it work in the present day.

[14:54] And I think he might have bit off a little bit more than they could chew.

[14:58] I think he scaled up too fast.

[15:00] And if you look at the way Spooky did it, they did it right.

[15:03] I would argue that Haggis has not done it right.

[15:06] I would argue that Haggis has skipped a few steps

[15:08] in how they're scaling up.

[15:10] And I think they must be taking on water,

[15:12] no pun intended because it's mermaid.

[15:15] And I think it was a rough year from Haggis.

[15:17] I really, really do.

[15:18] But I do hope people get their fathoms in early 2022

[15:22] because if they don't, I do think people are going to become more restless and anxious.

[15:28] But ultimately, this also shows that nobody's learned a lesson

[15:33] when it comes to pre-ordering.

[15:34] Right? We are still pre-ordering games

[15:37] that are not even close to being on the line.

[15:40] We are taking people's word for it.

[15:42] We're still doing it.

[15:43] This community in 2021 has proven once again

[15:48] that it has learned nothing

[15:50] that it continues to say,

[15:52] Hey, if you're a nice guy

[15:55] and you can make game A slowly,

[15:58] I have total faith that you'll make game B

[16:00] regardless of the context,

[16:02] regardless of how much more money it might require

[16:05] to make that game B.

[16:06] Very susceptible community we are

[16:09] to just believing in anyone's ambitions.

[16:11] But you know what?

[16:13] I think we all need to, moving into 2022,

[16:16] stop buying games unless they're on the line or in a box.

[16:20] Is it that hard?

[16:21] I mean, it's not that hard to just wait until something is actually made.

[16:26] All right, what kind of 2021 did American Pimball have?

[16:30] Now, I would argue that I think American Pimball probably had

[16:33] maybe the best year of any manufacturer.

[16:36] And I mean that.

[16:37] They probably had the best year of any manufacturer

[16:41] because American Pimball took the biggest gamble ever.

[16:44] They had the biggest risk releasing legends of Vahala

[16:48] an original IP game in which Canada was like,

[16:52] no way anyone's gonna buy this thing.

[16:54] And on day one, they increased their order

[16:57] and their sell through two distributors

[16:59] from 300 units to 500 units sold through.

[17:03] So I think 2021 was an amazing year for American Pimball.

[17:08] They hit the market at the right time.

[17:10] I still don't think it was the right game at the right time,

[17:13] but it didn't matter.

[17:15] The market was so hot and distributors are thirsty

[17:18] for any new products in boxes because they're out of inventory.

[17:22] So it was a great time to come out with a game.

[17:25] Now, I would say that the only hiccup for them right now

[17:28] is they are not manufacturing these things fast enough.

[17:32] They got the orders.

[17:34] Where are the games?

[17:35] I am seeing slow, slow rolling out of this title

[17:40] and I think the speed of their manufacturing

[17:42] is letting them down a little bit.

[17:44] I bet they would have liked a lot more legends of Vahala's

[17:48] to have gone out the door before the end of the year,

[17:51] but still that money is in the bank.

[17:54] And if you're David Fix, you have to be somewhat satisfied

[17:57] that your gamble paid off

[17:59] and you are moving on to Dennis Norman's original theme next.

[18:03] I still think this company will struggle

[18:05] with original IPs against license themes,

[18:09] but you know what, I can't fault them.

[18:12] They got a game out and the market is hot

[18:15] and they're going to build these games.

[18:16] Like nobody is worried that they won't get

[18:19] their American pinball game.

[18:21] The first three titles they launched

[18:23] all made their way to customers.

[18:24] There's no drama here.

[18:26] You might have to wait a little bit for your game.

[18:28] So I think American pinball had a really good 2021

[18:31] and I think if they're smart,

[18:33] they will sign up Sonic Spinball

[18:35] and they will stop with this nonsense

[18:37] and they will make some of the finest

[18:39] homebrew games that are licensed

[18:41] and bring them the market.

[18:42] And David, if you make Sonic,

[18:44] you're going to sell a few thousand units.

[18:47] It'll be your most successful game of all time

[18:49] and it's sitting there waiting for you

[18:51] to just green light it, okay?

[18:53] Please call Ryan McQuade and get Sonic Spinball made.

[18:58] Okay, next on our list of 2021 pinball companies

[19:02] is Chicago Gaming Company.

[19:04] What kind of year did CGC have?

[19:06] Well, strange year if you ask me for CGC.

[19:09] They revealed a game that we all knew

[19:11] was coming for years so no surprise there.

[19:14] They revealed it in the worst way possible.

[19:17] It was probably the sloppiest pinball launch of all time.

[19:21] They legitimately didn't even know

[19:23] all the information about the game.

[19:25] They created consumer confusion about everything

[19:29] associated with cactus canyon.

[19:31] It was almost like they were making it up

[19:33] as they were going.

[19:34] They didn't really know the price.

[19:36] They didn't know if the translate was going to be included

[19:38] in this or that.

[19:39] They didn't know if the topper was going to be

[19:41] on every single unit.

[19:43] They didn't know this.

[19:43] They didn't know that.

[19:44] It just felt like this company after having so many years

[19:48] to get this game to market, launched it in a way

[19:51] that showed absolutely no respect for themselves.

[19:55] Like the weirdest thing, right?

[19:57] All the years you've been spending

[19:59] making cactus canyon remake

[20:01] and you didn't really have your ducks in a row.

[20:03] And it showed.

[20:04] And I think what they did with the Ellie

[20:06] and then the next day you've got the SE Plus.

[20:08] I think they burned everybody.

[20:10] I think Doug's mission backfire.

[20:12] Like we want to price these things at a great value.

[20:15] But now you don't even know the value, Doug.

[20:17] Like no one really knows.

[20:18] Like how much is the Lyman Sheets code going to cost?

[20:21] I have to add the translate to my order.

[20:23] At the end of the day you add it all up

[20:25] and this thing's going to be just as much

[20:27] if not more than a stern Ellie.

[20:29] And so I'm not even sure they understand

[20:31] what's happening here.

[20:32] And also the games aren't on the line.

[20:35] So it was a really weird time for them

[20:36] to reveal the product because they're not manufacturing them.

[20:40] And we didn't see any SEs go out the door

[20:42] before the end of the year.

[20:44] We didn't see any Ellie's go out the door.

[20:46] In fact, I'm hearing the Ellie's are delayed till April May.

[20:50] So if that's the case, why didn't they just reveal

[20:53] this game at TPS when they were closer to launch,

[20:56] when they had all parts in house?

[20:58] They really sloppy launch from a company

[21:01] that shouldn't be sloppy with their launches.

[21:03] They have a great product.

[21:04] They might make arguably the best quality

[21:07] Pimball machines on the market.

[21:09] Everyone says it.

[21:10] These games are worth the wait.

[21:13] But in the marketing department

[21:14] and in the communication department,

[21:17] really, really sloppy.

[21:18] And I really hope they get their act together.

[21:20] And the other thing with CGC

[21:21] and the reason why I consider 2021

[21:23] to be kind of like a fail for them

[21:25] is they need to get more than just one game out

[21:28] every three years.

[21:30] They need to.

[21:30] They need to also get that original license game

[21:33] out the door from Mark Richie.

[21:35] We keep hearing like what's coming from this company,

[21:37] but the future seems to take forever to get to with CGC.

[21:41] All right, spooky Pimball.

[21:43] Spooky Pimball, this is the one.

[21:45] Spooky Pimball is the one when I think about companies

[21:47] that had mixed bag years.

[21:48] Spooky Pimball is at the top of my list

[21:51] because on one level,

[21:52] Spooky Pimball had the greatest financial day of their lives

[21:56] when they announced 1,750 games,

[22:00] 1,250 Halloween's and 500 Ultramans

[22:04] sold through in one day,

[22:06] sold through to distributors.

[22:07] So they had the greatest financial day of their lives.

[22:12] And from a financial standpoint,

[22:14] these guys are doing jumping jacks and cartwheels

[22:17] all the way to the bank.

[22:18] So was 2021 an amazing year for Spooky Pimball.

[22:23] Well, then you look at the other side of the coin.

[22:26] They launched these titles and they were very incomplete.

[22:29] They launched these titles with a lot of bugs

[22:32] that made them nightmares for operators.

[22:34] They launched these titles with animations

[22:37] that weren't up to the standard of the industry.

[22:40] And there was just like a lot of confusion

[22:42] of what's going on here, spooky.

[22:45] You've been around all these years.

[22:47] You know what people want and you came out with games

[22:50] and they weren't ready for the market.

[22:52] I think that's the best way to put it.

[22:54] These games were not ready for the market.

[22:57] And all of the goodwill that Spooky Pimball

[23:00] has built up over the years.

[23:02] I do think that goodwill is in jeopardy

[23:05] because I think people ran to these games in 2021

[23:09] simply because of FOMO.

[23:11] There are so few people out there

[23:13] that even know what Ultraman is

[23:15] or would want an Ultraman Pimball machine

[23:17] but why did they sell every single one?

[23:19] Because there was FOMO.

[23:21] We were watching all of these Pimball machines

[23:24] flip for so much more money.

[23:26] And we all felt like, well, there's only 500.

[23:29] How can I lose money on an Ultraman?

[23:32] There's only 1,250 Holoweens.

[23:34] How can I lose money on Holoween?

[23:37] It was like a sure bet.

[23:39] But now the market is showing everybody out there.

[23:41] If you bought a Holoween or an Ultraman,

[23:44] you're losing 50% of your deposit right away.

[23:49] These deposits for these collectors editions

[23:52] were $2,000.

[23:54] And go on Pinside 2 Day.

[23:56] And everyone is trying to get rid of their spots

[23:59] who are trying to get rid of their spots.

[24:01] And they're taking a $1,000 hit.

[24:04] And it's impossible not to look at this behavior

[24:08] as somewhat of a failure,

[24:09] as a lack of faith and spooky's ability

[24:12] to make these games great.

[24:14] I think people are basically saying

[24:16] with their wallets, we're unhappy.

[24:18] And I'm never coming back to these shores.

[24:21] And I think it was a mixed bag year for spooky.

[24:23] I think they made so much money with these games,

[24:26] but I don't think they invested enough

[24:29] in the talent over at spooky.

[24:31] I don't think they invested enough in these games.

[24:35] I think they're trying to build the ship in the ocean

[24:37] and I think people are seeing right through it.

[24:40] And they're saying, look,

[24:41] we understand that this sometimes takes a long time

[24:43] to get code into a game, to polish a game.

[24:46] But when you're a company like spooky,

[24:48] there's no excuse anymore

[24:50] because you're not making the amount of games stern is.

[24:53] When Jersey Jack Pimball comes out with a game,

[24:56] it's pretty complete.

[24:57] So for a company like spooky,

[24:59] that is focused on each title at a time.

[25:02] It was inexcusable how incomplete these games were.

[25:06] And it really feels like they handed this company over

[25:09] to more of the junior talent.

[25:11] They're not that experienced.

[25:13] They don't know fully what they're doing.

[25:15] And they lost a lot of their talent

[25:18] that made their prior games more enjoyable.

[25:21] So I think what's happened to spooky Pimball

[25:24] is that even though they made so much money,

[25:26] we're seeing a product that is somewhat inferior

[25:29] to what's come before it.

[25:31] And that has made a lot of people

[25:32] lose some confidence in this company.

[25:35] And I think a lot of that goodwill has been eroded.

[25:37] And I don't think people are gonna run to spooky

[25:40] on the next title and just buy it

[25:41] because I can't lose money on it.

[25:43] I don't think they're gonna be able to create another

[25:45] FOMO moment.

[25:46] And I said it like a year ago,

[25:48] that Rick and Morty was the greatest theme

[25:50] they might ever get for a Pimball machine.

[25:53] And that Rick and Morty is one

[25:54] that they're probably kicking themselves

[25:56] that they said they're only gonna make 750

[25:59] Rick and Morty's,

[26:00] because that could have been their cash cow

[26:02] for years to come.

[26:03] But you know what, they said they're never making anymore.

[26:06] Not the best year from spooky Pimball again.

[26:08] Financially they crushed it,

[26:10] but the perception of their brand

[26:12] I think took a huge hit in 2021.

[26:14] All right, we got two more left.

[26:16] Can you tell who they are?

[26:17] We've got Jersey Jack Pimball and we've got Stern.

[26:20] So what kind of 2021 was it for Jersey Jack Pimball?

[26:24] Well, again, another company, we're financially,

[26:27] you had a jug or not year.

[26:30] You had so many orders for guns and roses,

[26:33] it overwhelmed your manufacturing line probably,

[26:36] it overwhelmed your schedule to get to the next game.

[26:39] And they probably got somewhere around

[26:42] 5,000 orders for guns and roses.

[26:44] And so the story of Jersey Jack Pimball in 2021,

[26:48] another mixed bag a year on one level,

[26:52] financially amazing year for them.

[26:55] Probably their best game to date.

[26:57] I think the consumers have spoken,

[26:59] this game is a masterpiece.

[27:00] For those who hate it, I don't know what to tell you.

[27:02] I think the game's a masterpiece,

[27:04] but that wasn't the story of 2021 for Jersey Jack was it.

[27:08] We weren't talking about how great the game was.

[27:11] We weren't talking about how many they sold.

[27:14] We weren't talking about how this was finally a cool theme

[27:17] that wasn't a family friendly thing.

[27:19] The only thing we were talking about all year

[27:22] was the poor quality of the machine.

[27:25] Was the play fields falling apart again?

[27:28] It wasn't just the quality control issues

[27:31] that dominated Jersey Jack's 2021.

[27:34] It was their lack of response.

[27:37] And I think this is another company

[27:39] that even though they had financial success,

[27:42] their brand took a huge hit.

[27:44] And every time we talk about Jersey Jack Pimball now,

[27:48] it's an army of people complaining about quality.

[27:51] And it is crazy to me that throughout the entire year of 2021,

[27:57] Jersey Jack Pimball never came out

[28:00] with an official statement about the play field quality.

[28:04] And you just have to think about that for a minute.

[28:06] A company turned its back on its customers

[28:10] by never officially saying anything.

[28:13] That's not good.

[28:14] That's not good.

[28:15] Now they were communicating behind closed channels

[28:18] to people with emails, but nothing was ever official.

[28:22] We did hear from Jersey Jack himself in 2021

[28:25] in which he basically blamed consumers

[28:28] for the issues with the play field.

[28:30] And we've heard that sound bite

[28:32] and Jack probably regrets saying that.

[28:35] I don't know what the problem is.

[28:36] I don't, I don't know if it's overtorking.

[28:38] I don't know if it's Mirko.

[28:40] I don't know what I can say is this is now

[28:43] like the fourth Jersey Jack machine

[28:45] in which the play fields have had issues.

[28:47] And so I think it created a dark cloud over Jersey Jack Pimball

[28:51] all throughout 2021.

[28:54] And even now as we look at like the Godfather rumor

[28:57] and all the new games coming out, toy story,

[28:59] you can't escape it.

[29:01] And I really hope in 2022, all I can hope for

[29:04] is that Jersey Jack Pimball solves this issue

[29:08] and comes out and says we've solved it.

[29:10] I don't know how they're gonna prove they've solved it

[29:13] unless we play these games and they don't fall apart

[29:16] because no one's gonna believe in some quality seal

[29:20] that Mirko puts on the play fields.

[29:22] It's gonna come down to the actual product itself.

[29:25] And will they be able to ship toy story with no issues?

[29:29] I really hope, I really hope for their sake

[29:31] that they have like 10 toy stories made already.

[29:35] And I mean CEs and Llies, I hope they're sitting

[29:39] in a private room and they are pressure testing

[29:42] these games like never before.

[29:45] And I doubt they're doing it

[29:46] because I bet they're trying to keep it a secret

[29:49] like and not have it leak.

[29:50] But you know what Jersey Jack, you need to get over that.

[29:53] You need to put quality in front of secrecy.

[29:57] We know what the game is, we know it's toy story.

[29:59] So they would be smart to say, hey look,

[30:01] we're gonna put toy story on location for two months

[30:04] and have it be beat on before we turn on the assembly line

[30:08] because we wanna make sure these play fields

[30:09] are bulletproof.

[30:10] I feel like everyone would stand up and applaud that move.

[30:14] Instead, I feel like we're gonna get another like,

[30:17] well, we're all gonna be guinea pigs when they ship this game

[30:20] and who knows what the outcome will be.

[30:22] But it wasn't all quality control issues

[30:24] at Jersey Jack in 2021.

[30:26] We also got the big switch.

[30:28] They hired Steve Richie, right?

[30:30] The King of all Pimbal joins Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[30:34] They also hired Mark Sayden or Seedin

[30:36] who did a Metroid Pimbal.

[30:38] So they brought two new designers into the company.

[30:42] And so on a surface level, Steve Richie joining

[30:46] Jersey Jack Pimbal should seem like a humongous accusation

[30:50] and some amazing move by the company.

[30:53] But I also think a lot of people are like,

[30:55] well, I don't know, you know?

[30:56] Steve Richie's last few Stern games

[30:58] haven't really been the best.

[31:00] And Steve's sort of been complaining

[31:02] that the bomb over at Stern isn't good enough

[31:04] and then we see what Keith Owens does.

[31:06] And so it's pretty clear that the new King at Stern is Elwin.

[31:10] And so Will Steve Richie show us what he can do

[31:13] over at Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[31:15] But again, it's 2021.

[31:16] And I think most people are like,

[31:18] we're not gonna see Steve's efforts anytime soon.

[31:21] But Jersey Jack is saying that we will see two games in 2022.

[31:26] Have we heard that before?

[31:28] Jack has said that for years.

[31:30] So do we think they will actually get two new games

[31:33] on the line in 2022?

[31:35] I can tell you this, everybody hopes they do.

[31:38] But I'll believe it when I see it.

[31:40] All right, let's go over to Stern Pimbal

[31:42] because this is a company that had a ton of activity in 2021.

[31:46] Let me go down the list of everything that Stern did in 2021.

[31:50] They got Led Zeppelin out.

[31:51] Then we got Mandalorian.

[31:53] We got Godzilla.

[31:54] We got Elvira 40th, Jurassic Park home edition.

[31:58] We got Stern Insider connected.

[32:00] Talk about a huge thing right?

[32:02] Stern connected its games using QR codes and the internet.

[32:07] We got Lyman Sheet's left Stern for CGC.

[32:10] That was big news as well.

[32:12] Jack Danger is hired as a new designer over at Stern Pimbal.

[32:15] And we finally got new code for the monsters

[32:18] after years of people complaining.

[32:20] Okay, so what kind of 2021 did Stern Pimbal have?

[32:24] Well, obviously, Stern Pimbal is the number one

[32:28] Pimbal maker in the world.

[32:30] There is more demand for Stern Pimbal machines

[32:33] than anywhere else.

[32:35] This is the number one company by far.

[32:37] They had an amazing 2021.

[32:40] Not only did they do this new stuff,

[32:42] but all of their old games are skyrocketing in value.

[32:47] If you're Stern and you're looking at

[32:49] where this market is going, you are seeing nothing,

[32:53] but dollar signs and googly eyes over there.

[32:56] Because they must be like, look, we've got it.

[32:58] We've got everyone right where we want them.

[33:01] We have now shown that we can sell games at $6,000

[33:06] and $25,000 for pretty much the same product.

[33:11] It's crazy.

[33:12] But Stern deserves it.

[33:14] Head of all the Pimbal companies out there.

[33:16] This company deserves all the success they're having.

[33:19] They deserve all the demand they're having.

[33:22] I will say it and I've said it before.

[33:24] This company has the best Pimbal licenses.

[33:27] This company has the best teams.

[33:30] They have the best manufacturing capability.

[33:33] They have the best leadership.

[33:35] And ultimately, Stern Pimbal, are you ready for it?

[33:38] Has the best quality.

[33:40] There is no one who even comes close to Stern's quality.

[33:46] And the thing about quality is this.

[33:48] Go and try and make 15,000 games a year.

[33:52] Can you imagine if anyone else made the amount

[33:54] of game Stern makes?

[33:56] For the amount of games Stern pumps out the door.

[33:59] I rarely, and I mean this.

[34:01] I rarely open up threads about Stern machines

[34:05] and see moaning and groaning about quality issues.

[34:07] There's nobody complaining about play field issues.

[34:11] There's nobody complaining that much about mech issues

[34:13] for the most part.

[34:15] At the volume they create this game,

[34:17] they're the best quality in the whole industry.

[34:20] And then you could argue that they've got the best coders now.

[34:23] And they're putting more into their games

[34:25] from a software standpoint than everybody else.

[34:28] Or at least they're up there, right?

[34:29] I mean, because this isn't Jersey Jack.

[34:32] It's not like Stern just makes one game every 18 months.

[34:35] The fact that they make four to five games a year

[34:38] and all of them launch pretty complete now, right?

[34:41] We're no longer waiting two years for games to be done.

[34:44] These games are coming out the door with real polish

[34:47] and you're not going to regret buying a Stern on day one anymore.

[34:50] Those days are over.

[34:52] Now that being said, do I think Stern Pimball

[34:55] from a consumer standpoint made the most magical games in 2021?

[35:00] And what was their portfolio like?

[35:02] Was it quality over quantity or quantity over quality?

[35:07] Led Zeppelin led the year for Stern Pimball.

[35:10] Arguably, this game is one that everyone has forgotten.

[35:13] This is one of the Stern LEDs that's not going up in price.

[35:16] This is one of the games that people look at

[35:19] and say, Steve Richie kind of mailed it in.

[35:21] There's nothing really that innovative

[35:23] or creative about Led Zeppelin.

[35:25] And I also think this was Stern's response to Guns and Roses.

[35:29] And it was sort of like a pathetic response.

[35:31] I mean, even in their press release,

[35:33] they tried to say this is like going to a Led Zeppelin concert.

[35:37] If you put Led Zeppelin next to Guns and Roses,

[35:40] it's embarrassing.

[35:42] And I don't care you guys complaining about Eric's multi-balls.

[35:45] I don't care.

[35:46] It's such a better game, Guns and Roses.

[35:49] It's not even funny.

[35:50] And I know what the Steve Richie fanboys will say,

[35:53] but it shoots better.

[35:54] I'm sorry.

[35:55] It's really easy to make a game shoot better

[35:57] if there's nothing in it and nothing happening in the game.

[36:01] I mean, nothing shoots smoother

[36:02] than an empty play field people wake up.

[36:05] All right, so Led Zeppelin at a dud.

[36:08] Then we get to Mandalorian and don't forget,

[36:11] who is Canadian who told you Mandalorian was coming?

[36:13] I mean, I put that rumor out there before anybody else.

[36:16] And so Mandalorian comes out.

[36:18] Brian Eddie's follow-up title to Stranger Things.

[36:21] Would Mandalorian have the magic of the show we all love?

[36:25] Would it create a world under glass

[36:27] that brought Baby Yoda and the bounty hunter world to life?

[36:30] And I would say this, Mandalorian great theme.

[36:34] The theme integration is not there for me.

[36:37] And I just don't see the magic on the game itself.

[36:40] I understand that people who love this game

[36:42] and why they love it, but it's another one of these things

[36:45] where all the magic is in the software.

[36:48] It's not in the hardware.

[36:50] And I think Mandalorian should have been a game

[36:53] that had a lot more magical toys

[36:55] and wow moments happening on the play field itself.

[36:59] I think it's a boring, uninspired design

[37:02] and that's just my point of view on it.

[37:04] Now I get it if you love it.

[37:06] But once again, I think Stern Pimball has taken

[37:09] our love of Star Wars and they've flushed it down the toilet.

[37:13] The fact that we don't have a Star Wars game

[37:16] that makes people as excited as like ghost busters

[37:20] or Lord of the Rings or Tron or Metallica is crazy.

[37:25] It is the greatest source material of all time.

[37:28] The Steve Richie Star Wars Pimball Machine is arguably

[37:32] the worst theme integration in the history of theme integrations

[37:36] considering what the source theme is.

[37:39] And I really think Stern should go give Star Wars

[37:42] to Keith L. Win and try it again.

[37:46] Can we please just have L. Win make everything we love?

[37:49] And we all knew Keith L. Win's Godzilla was coming.

[37:51] It was so hyped and did it deliver on the hype.

[37:54] Obviously it did.

[37:56] Godzilla from Keith L. Win has really been the juggernaut theme

[38:00] of 2021.

[38:01] It is arguably the most popular game of the year.

[38:04] It is gonna win every single award that it is entered into.

[38:08] I would say that the only controversy around Godzilla

[38:11] was whether or not Zambietti's art style

[38:13] was the right fit for the Godzilla theme,

[38:16] considering it was Toho Godzilla.

[38:18] But for the most part, right?

[38:20] Every time Keith L. Win comes out with a pin,

[38:24] it's a special moment.

[38:25] He's arguably the best designer over at Stern Pimball right now

[38:29] and they are giving him a little bit more to work with

[38:32] when it comes to the bomb of the game.

[38:34] And then we had the surprise launch,

[38:36] which was Elvira's 40th, a $15,000 pinball machine

[38:42] that Stern Pimball let its distributors price themselves

[38:46] and they are selling for $15,000 to $25,000.

[38:51] I think most of them are selling for closer to $25,000 to $30,000

[38:55] and Stern is only making $199.

[38:58] This is crazy because what Stern did with this launch of Elvira

[39:02] was they said to the distributors,

[39:04] you set the price much different

[39:06] than Stern selling Batman S.L.E.s for $15,000.

[39:10] I think this is probably the most interesting move

[39:14] Stern did all year for collectors

[39:16] because they are gonna start doing this more and more.

[39:19] They are gonna start S.L.E. dropping their hot titles.

[39:23] And we heard Zach many talk about this,

[39:24] like he thinks of Vault is coming

[39:26] and you best believe it if they vault any of their games

[39:30] that people want,

[39:31] well, what if they just make 200 special versions of Tron

[39:35] or Lord of the Rings or Metallica?

[39:37] You could go down a list of games,

[39:39] probably not Metallica, but you could go down a list.

[39:41] Imagine if they made more Ghostbuster games

[39:44] and there was a special version of only 200,

[39:47] the sky's the limit on what they could charge the collector.

[39:51] So if you were a collector, I think 2021 was a year

[39:54] in which you realized your wallet is in big trouble.

[39:57] It's in huge trouble.

[39:59] And I think for those of you out there

[40:00] who want to collect rare machines,

[40:02] you're looking at 40K, 35K for pirates of the care of being C.E.

[40:07] You're looking at $25,000 for Elvira 40th.

[40:11] It's crazy, right?

[40:12] Two hot pinball machines are now gonna cost you 50 to $60,000

[40:18] for just two machines.

[40:20] And all of a sudden this market starts to feel a little

[40:23] ridiculous, right?

[40:24] We start to feel like how did it come to this?

[40:26] Like machines never used to be this much.

[40:28] And now the only good deal in town seems like MSRP

[40:33] if you get a game right when it comes out.

[40:35] So Elvira 40th though, smashing success for a stern pinball,

[40:39] it showed them that they have not hit any sort of ceiling.

[40:42] It also showed them that this is a future for them.

[40:45] In the collectible space, they might as well

[40:48] just limit the supply of a special version of a game

[40:52] that won't really cost them more to make

[40:54] and they could charge $20,000, $30,000

[40:57] and people will spend the money.

[40:59] We got Jurassic Park Home Edition.

[41:01] And I think Jack Danger joining the team over there

[41:03] at Stern is a great move for Stern.

[41:05] Jack is a great personality.

[41:07] And Jack's design skills, I think past the test

[41:10] of a lot of people.

[41:11] I think when you jump on the Jurassic Park Home Edition,

[41:14] people have a lot of fun with that game.

[41:16] I mean, there's more in that game.

[41:18] There's more in that game than Legends of Vahala, right?

[41:21] The game shoots amazingly well.

[41:23] And Jack Danger, I think is gonna have a really awesome

[41:26] future with Stern Pimball.

[41:27] And I think he's a great ambassador for Stern in general.

[41:31] So Jack Danger joining the team, we kind of knew it.

[41:33] I think we're gonna see him working on Foo Fighters in 2022.

[41:37] That's just my speculation.

[41:39] And then we had the big news of the year

[41:40] which was Stern Insider Connected.

[41:42] I mean, this is long overdue.

[41:44] Stern has tens of thousands of Pimball machines

[41:47] out there in the world.

[41:48] And now they're gonna connect them all

[41:51] with Stern Insider Connected.

[41:53] Absolutely, this is the biggest move.

[41:56] And I bet more work went into this

[41:58] than all of their games combined in 2021.

[42:01] Because this is gonna open up

[42:03] so many new revenue streams for Stern Pimball.

[42:06] It is.

[42:06] It's also gonna make playing Pimball more enjoyable

[42:09] for all of us.

[42:11] If you have a game on location,

[42:13] this opens up so many new opportunities

[42:16] for bar and business owners to make these games fun,

[42:19] to add achievements that can be connected

[42:21] to the business you're in.

[42:22] It also makes owning the game in your home

[42:25] more enjoyable to connect to people out there

[42:27] who also have that machine.

[42:29] And I love this.

[42:30] And I think this was long overdue for Pimball.

[42:33] And obviously Stern took their time.

[42:35] And I think they're doing it right.

[42:37] Jersey Jack Scott scorebit and that's great too.

[42:40] But connecting people in this community

[42:42] through the games themselves has really been lacking.

[42:45] And it's crazy.

[42:46] We're at 2021, 2022.

[42:49] And internet connecting these games

[42:51] is still really not where it should be.

[42:54] But this is a first step in the right direction.

[42:57] But it does come with a little bit of a negative.

[43:00] And that is this will also open up the door for DLC,

[43:05] which is downloadable content.

[43:07] And we know that Stern is gonna find new

[43:09] and interesting ways to charge us money

[43:12] even after we buy the games.

[43:14] And I think that's the one part that people don't want.

[43:17] I don't want to spend $10,500 and then have to keep spending

[43:22] more money to unlock the game.

[43:25] And at these price points,

[43:26] you should get everything in the kitchen sink

[43:28] in your purchase.

[43:30] But Stern's gonna be smart.

[43:31] They're gonna charge you extra.

[43:33] You know, and they're gonna start doing more

[43:34] and more stuff like this.

[43:35] You want the topper?

[43:36] Well, you have to spend like five bucks

[43:38] to unlock the topper mode.

[43:39] Like they're gonna do it

[43:40] because with this much of an audience, think about it.

[43:43] With this much of an audience,

[43:44] there's millions of dollars they can make

[43:46] in additional revenue.

[43:48] If they just do small micro transactions

[43:51] across the community.

[43:52] Stern deserves to do this stuff

[43:54] because they saved Pimball.

[43:56] Without Stern Pimball,

[43:57] this hobby would be pretty boring.

[43:59] The whole community would collapse

[44:01] if Stern went away.

[44:02] Without Stern, you know, there's not much going on.

[44:05] And I think when I look at the year in review,

[44:07] it really is like Stern's doing like 75% of the work

[44:11] and everyone else is just hanging on.

[44:14] Right?

[44:15] Everyone else has like one game and only one game.

[44:17] But Stern Pimball keeps going.

[44:19] We're probably gonna get rushed like this week or next.

[44:23] And then they're gonna keep going onto Venom.

[44:25] You know, everyone else, it's like who knows, right?

[44:27] It's just a guess of when these companies are actually

[44:30] gonna get two games out of the year.

[44:31] Most of them can't figure that out.

[44:33] I mean, when David Fix came back

[44:35] and said we're gonna make two games a year,

[44:37] he said that at the beginning of 2021,

[44:39] they didn't get two games out of the year.

[44:41] And as much as everyone's blaming COVID,

[44:44] Stern still got all of its titles out the door.

[44:47] They still did it.

[44:49] Jersey Jack never got a second game on the line.

[44:51] And so you gotta give these guys credit.

[44:54] And I think we have, like their sales success,

[44:56] 17,000 games are backlogged.

[44:59] That's incredible.

[45:01] All right, so what kind of year was it, right?

[45:03] I think 2021, in summary,

[45:06] what kind of year do I think we had in 2021?

[45:08] I think it was a little bit of a mixed bag year.

[45:10] I think we saw prices go through the roof

[45:13] and I think that's deflated a lot of people in Pimball.

[45:16] I think this hobby we used to love

[45:18] used to be much more approachable for so many more people.

[45:22] And I think the hobby has become a little bit ridiculous.

[45:26] I do.

[45:26] When I see some of these prices

[45:28] and I see how fast things are selling

[45:31] for double the price they did just a year or two ago,

[45:34] I kinda laugh at it because I don't think

[45:36] any Pimball machine is worth more than $10,000.

[45:39] Let alone 20, let alone 30, let alone 40.

[45:44] But if you have the means and you're impatient

[45:47] and you just wanna have what you wanna have

[45:49] when you wanna have it

[45:51] and you're a multi-millionaire,

[45:52] I mean, I got a great hobby for you.

[45:54] It's called Pimball.

[45:55] And I think there's just a lot of money

[45:57] has moved into this hobby.

[45:59] A lot of us have gotten our friends into Pimball.

[46:02] And now that they're in it, they want stuff.

[46:05] And they want stuff now and they're excited.

[46:08] The most exciting time is when you first get into a new hobby.

[46:11] And that is who is buying these games.

[46:13] Don't be mistaken.

[46:15] We all knew that stranger things,

[46:17] Ellie wasn't the best Pinever.

[46:18] Who do you think's buying stranger things,

[46:20] Ellie at 15,000?

[46:22] A new person in the hobby who has money.

[46:25] Same with Ghostbusters.

[46:26] So there's just so much new money in the hobby.

[46:29] And what's gonna happen now is for those of us out there

[46:32] who have been in this hobby for a while.

[46:34] Like we're legacy into it in a lot of ways.

[46:36] We have the relationships with the distributors and whatnot.

[46:40] And I think you're gonna see a lot more of scalping

[46:43] and flipping machines as people take advantage

[46:45] of all this new money.

[46:47] They don't have the relationships, but they've got the cash.

[46:50] And I think this hobby is gonna keep going up in price

[46:53] in 2022.

[46:54] I think supply shortages are still gonna be an issue.

[46:56] And I think if you have a game in a box that people want,

[47:00] you might as well ask a lot for it

[47:02] because there's not a lot of games

[47:03] that are gonna be on the line in 2022.

[47:06] I think 2022 is gonna be a lot like 2021.

[47:09] In the sense that prices are not gonna dip.

[47:11] It is an exciting year we're headed into.

[47:13] I'm really looking forward to a new Jersey Jack machine.

[47:16] That's always a moment.

[47:17] It's always a special moment when Jersey Jack launches

[47:20] a new game, but we know it's coming from Stern.

[47:22] We know it's James Bond.

[47:23] We know it's Venom.

[47:24] We know it's Rush.

[47:25] And we know it's probably not back to the future

[47:28] from Keith Ellwyn.

[47:28] Well, anyone else surprises.

[47:30] I think that's gonna be the big question of 2022.

[47:33] Will anybody else surprise us with something

[47:36] we didn't see coming?

[47:37] I'm not sure. I'm really not sure.

[47:39] Everybody out there.

[47:40] I wanna say thank you so much for your support.

[47:43] It's been a really sort of weird like few days for me.

[47:45] I've had an amazing time with my family during the holidays.

[47:48] You know, and even though people try to say

[47:50] a ton of nasty stuff about me,

[47:52] I really don't care, pay attention to any of it.

[47:53] I just wanna do this show and do a show like this

[47:56] and keep making Canadian Spinball podcasts for all of you.

[47:59] Thank you so much.

[48:00] The numbers are going in the right direction.

[48:02] 317 people.

[48:03] It's just gonna keep growing as people realize

[48:05] this is the only place to enjoy

[48:07] the most entertaining Spinball podcasts on the planet.

[48:09] Well, I think it is. Who knows? Who knows?

[48:11] It's no longer about awards or numbers for me now.

[48:14] It's just about making show for my fans.

[48:15] And that's what I wanna do.

[48:17] And I know you enjoy listening.

[48:18] If you're having any issues with the show,

[48:20] let me know at canadapimbaladgmail.com.

[48:23] Thank you so much for the support.

[48:25] It means so much to my family.

[48:26] And I've had so many nice conversations

[48:28] with a lot of you out there.

[48:30] And I'm hoping each and every one of you

[48:32] has a very happy and healthy 2022.

[48:36] And I'll be back with more episodes

[48:38] of Canada Spinball Podcast. Have a good day.
