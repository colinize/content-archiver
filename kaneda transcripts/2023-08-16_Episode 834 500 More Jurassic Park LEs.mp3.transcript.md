[00:00] Oh, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast everybody, I'm your host, Canada, out of the blue today.

[00:18] It wasn't the mystery company, it was not the mystery game I thought it was going to

[00:22] be.

[00:23] Stern Pinball releases a game we've been speculating about ever since we saw that little logo on

[00:28] the translate, a 30th anniversary limited edition of Jurassic Park.

[00:34] We're going to talk about this because you know what happened to the other limited edition

[00:38] versions of Jurassic Park which were supposed to be, wait for it, limited.

[00:43] What does the word limited mean if you are going to make more?

[00:48] There's a real ethical question going on right now with Stern Pinball's decisions to say

[00:53] one thing and then do another.

[00:56] I've been thinking a lot about this podcast today and how I want to approach this topic

[01:01] because am I mad, am I furious?

[01:04] If I owned a Jurassic Park LE and I bought one years ago, three years ago for like $9,000

[01:12] would I be pissed off that they came out with this game now for freaking $13,000?

[01:17] I would be kind of annoyed, I'll tell you why, but I wouldn't be totally mad and here's

[01:22] why I would be annoyed.

[01:24] Because Jurassic Park LEs were special because they only made 500.

[01:29] Remember that was the period when Stern was making just 4-500 games and maybe like on a

[01:34] super hot title like Star Wars they would bump it up to 800 games, Monsters had 600

[01:40] LEs, but Jurassic Park, much like Stranger Things, it was really nice to know that you

[01:46] got one of the last Stern machines that were truly somewhat limited because we're all seeing

[01:51] right now when you make a thousand LEs, that's a lot of machines and then when you make a

[01:56] thousand LEs at $13,000, that's a lot of machines at a very high price, it's really hard for

[02:04] those machines to maintain their value.

[02:06] And I know what people are saying like don't buy a pinball machine as an investment, but

[02:11] come on everybody wake up into the real world.

[02:15] Everybody wants to know when they spend this kind of money on what is being marketed to

[02:19] us as a collectible item.

[02:21] I mean remember like LEs are for collectors, there'd be no reason whatsoever to buy an

[02:27] LE machine when they have a premium available for much cheaper, they are definitely marketing

[02:32] these LEs towards the more high end collector.

[02:35] Now look years ago I would fly off the handle at a move like this, I'm not surprised by

[02:40] the move.

[02:41] Is anyone really surprised that Stern did this?

[02:44] We know this is coming and they're going to do it again and again and again.

[02:48] This is Stern's new business model.

[02:50] In just one move they can put this game out into the marketplace, it's $6.5 million in

[02:56] revenue that will come into Stern Pinball simply by running a game that they can make

[03:01] in one week.

[03:02] I mean they can make in one week 500 LEs of Jurassic Park, move the games in and out,

[03:08] there's nothing special about the play field, it's the same old Jurassic Park, it's just

[03:12] the same game Jurassic Park has always been.

[03:15] What I don't like about this move and I mean this, I don't like the fact that they're calling

[03:19] this limited edition, I think they should have called this game the Jurassic Park 30th

[03:25] anniversary edition and even if you put like one out of 500, I don't care, at least you're

[03:30] calling it something different.

[03:32] It is the anniversary edition of the game.

[03:35] I don't like it still but at least then you're not creating confusion because now when you

[03:40] go to list your Jurassic Park LE for sale it's going to be version 1 or version 2.

[03:46] And it's also like interesting that they are doing this and they're kind of using this

[03:49] as somewhat of an excuse.

[03:51] Now that we're making 1000 LEs we can make 500 more Jurassic Parks because we only made

[03:56] 500 the first time around.

[03:59] So does this mean that Stern Pinball is now going to go look back at some of the older

[04:03] titles that were popular and go make more of them just around everything up to 1000?

[04:09] That is why we'll make 600 Tron LEs, brand new ones because now we've got 1000 Tron LEs.

[04:14] And look, this is a move that indicates that they are very likely going to do that more

[04:18] and more and more because when you look at this game it does look nicer.

[04:22] I like this version of Jurassic Park.

[04:24] I like the artwork much better on this version than the older LE.

[04:29] So right now if you love Jurassic Park this would be the game I want to have.

[04:34] Now look for $13,000 Stern did not even give you everything they gave the other game.

[04:38] It doesn't come with the shooter rod that's got that Jurassic Park Amber shooter rod.

[04:43] There's no topper included.

[04:44] It's got this nice red armor.

[04:46] It's got a new translate.

[04:48] I like that translate a lot more than the previous LE translate with the dinosaurs ruled the

[04:53] earth banner.

[04:54] Everything about it looks really nice.

[04:56] You know but then you sit back and you think about it.

[04:58] It's like alright like is this wowing us?

[05:01] Have we been waiting for this moment to bring back more Jurassic Park pinball machines?

[05:05] I think they fully have satiated the Jurassic Park market to this date.

[05:10] But you got to remember who the target for this is.

[05:13] Stern saw a lot of new people come into this hobby during COVID.

[05:17] They saw a lot of people paying a crazy amount of money at the height of COVID.

[05:21] Jurassic Park LEs were selling for like $18,000 or $19,000.

[05:25] Now look if you ran into this hobby and you bought a Jurassic Park for like $17,000 or

[05:31] $18,000.

[05:32] Yes you are feeling so bad today.

[05:34] You are going to kick yourself that you didn't listen to Canada and wait and see.

[05:39] Because you know as this stuff happens and the more and more I look at this hobby and

[05:42] what these companies are doing or trying to do.

[05:45] The more and more I'm just looking at myself in the mirror and I'm also suggesting everybody

[05:49] do this.

[05:50] At some point we're going to just have to come to peace with where this hobby is.

[05:55] That a lot of the fun that was in this hobby and following all these new games, new and

[06:00] box games.

[06:01] A lot of the fun has been sort of taken out of the hobby.

[06:04] The games are so expensive.

[06:06] These companies aren't being ethical and honest with you.

[06:10] When they released James Bond 60th and they said this topper is exclusive to this game.

[06:16] And then they saw that people got excited about it and they can make more money and

[06:20] then they released the topper afterwards.

[06:22] I mean why are we accepting this behavior from Stern Pimbal?

[06:26] And the reason why they can abuse us as consumers is so simple because we allow them to abuse

[06:32] us.

[06:33] And I'm not children ladies and gentlemen.

[06:36] We are grown adults.

[06:37] And if people actually put their foot down and say hey we're not going to take any more

[06:41] of this and actually help them accountable for staying true to their word, it would be

[06:46] a different scenario.

[06:48] But everyone just hides behind the fact that this is a toy.

[06:52] This is a hobby where we're supposed to have fun.

[06:54] I'm not going to pressure Pimbal companies to stay true to their word.

[06:58] I don't think I've seen this happen in other hobbies I'm a part of.

[07:01] I mean in the watch collecting community if they say we're only making 500 they're only

[07:05] making 500.

[07:07] And I get that they made changes to the artwork so they see this as a separate limited edition

[07:11] game.

[07:12] But I'm coming to peace with all of this.

[07:14] That I don't really care about more Jurassic parks.

[07:17] I don't really care about Stern's ability to rerun old games.

[07:20] You know spend 300 bucks to slap new artwork on a game and then charge us $4,000 more.

[07:25] Like I remember what this game used to cost.

[07:28] You're not going to fool us with just artwork and armor.

[07:30] Like I know it doesn't cost that much money.

[07:33] You know what's weird about this hobby?

[07:35] Jurassic Park was like 9 grand.

[07:37] So this is $4,000 more.

[07:40] That's over a 40% increase in price over what this game used to cost.

[07:45] Are all of you making 40% more money now than you did 3 years ago?

[07:49] I just find it really hard to believe all of these moves that are just cash grab moves

[07:54] we don't need more Jurassic Park and we know where this is going to go next.

[07:58] We're going to get an anniversary edition of Godzilla.

[08:02] We're going to get an anniversary edition of fill in the blank game across the board.

[08:07] Every single property, every 5 or 10 years has an anniversary that Stern could leverage

[08:13] and do this time and time again.

[08:15] I do worry that a pinball keeps going in this direction.

[08:18] If you burn your LE buyers, if you burn those people, how many times are they going to go

[08:23] back and buy from you again?

[08:25] So what we're all learning now, and again this is just me looking at the marketplace,

[08:29] there's clearly a lot of new people.

[08:31] There's new demand and these games are meant to supply and satiate that new demand.

[08:37] Stern does not care about you once you buy the game from them.

[08:40] They don't care about the second hand value of the game.

[08:43] They don't see any of that money.

[08:45] So yes, they just burned 500 people today.

[08:48] As far as I'm concerned, it's only those 500 people that should be really pissed off because

[08:53] a lot of those people just love Jurassic Park, right?

[08:55] That's why they bought an LE.

[08:57] And now they're going to want this one.

[08:58] This is obviously a nicer package.

[09:00] They've made it look even better.

[09:02] If I was a Jurassic Park fan, could I just be happy with the old one?

[09:05] Sure, but I wouldn't be happy.

[09:07] Like deep down inside, I would want this one.

[09:10] Do I think this Jurassic Park announcement is what kept that mystery company from revealing

[09:15] their game this week?

[09:16] I absolutely do.

[09:17] There are clearly people on the inside that know what's going on.

[09:21] They know the release schedule.

[09:22] Like someone put up yesterday before this Jurassic Park got announced today for $13,000,

[09:28] they put up for sale a Jurassic Park LE with $2,000 in mods up for sale for $12,500.

[09:35] So how did that person know that this was going to happen today?

[09:39] And before today, those Jurassic Park LEs with $2,000 in mods, they would have been

[09:44] listed for sale for like $16,000 to $18,000.

[09:48] So clearly there are people that know what's going on behind the scenes.

[09:52] So the other thing I was thinking about when I saw this game is what a jerk move to do

[09:55] to Brian Eddy.

[09:57] Brian Eddy's Venom just got revealed.

[09:59] It just got announced.

[10:01] And they have not sold all the Venom LEs.

[10:03] And Venom marketing needs to get people excited to buy the game.

[10:07] And now you do this.

[10:08] Was Stern so desperate to get another game on the line that they had to crap all over

[10:13] Venom's sales window like this?

[10:16] And once again, you know, waiting and seeing, like if you just waited a few weeks and for

[10:20] some of you out there, you might have been like on the fence.

[10:22] You might have been looking at Jurassic Park LEs and waiting for the prices to come down.

[10:27] And you might have been considering picking up a Venom just to have some fun with one.

[10:31] And now this happens.

[10:32] So look, it's Stern doing what Stern does best.

[10:35] They make money.

[10:36] They execute.

[10:37] The crazy thing is that they're going to make all these games in one week.

[10:39] And so when do I think we're going to see this mystery game from this mystery company?

[10:43] I think possibly sometime in September.

[10:46] I think a week from now, no one's really going to care that much about this Jurassic Park

[10:50] new version of an LE.

[10:52] I think it's going to have a very short shelf life when it comes to conversation around

[10:56] it.

[10:57] I think the game looks good.

[10:58] I don't like the move.

[11:00] Nothing feels very limited anymore in pinball.

[11:02] And I'm hoping, right?

[11:03] I'm hoping that this new company that's going to reveal something, I'm imagining whatever

[11:08] they reveal to the world, they're going to have a limited run of the game because no

[11:12] one else is going to come out right now and get into large scale manufacturing.

[11:17] So they might release a game where they're only making 500.

[11:20] Maybe they're only making 750.

[11:22] I truly do miss the days when things were truly limited, right?

[11:25] When there's only going to be 200.

[11:27] There's only going to be 500.

[11:29] Once they doubled the amount and almost doubled the price of the machines themselves, it's

[11:33] not supposed to work that way.

[11:35] You're not supposed to be able to increase the supply and then charge so much more and

[11:39] still have demand.

[11:41] It's not supposed to work that way.

[11:43] And maybe we're all just waking up to this new reality that the people who buy pinball

[11:47] machines are pretty wealthy.

[11:49] This is not a lot of money for a lot of the people in this hobby.

[11:52] And it's a global hobby.

[11:54] Like there are people all over the world who want these machines.

[11:58] And I feel bad for anyone who's not in the United States of America because if you look

[12:02] at what people are paying in Europe and Australia for these LEs, it's like $19,000.

[12:08] I mean, that's a lot of cheddar for one single electrical mechanical device like a pinball

[12:13] machine.

[12:14] I don't think any pinball machine really gives a $19,000 experience, but it is what it is.

[12:20] Everybody will do what they want with their own money.

[12:22] So I was reading on Pinside people's feedback about this move and it's pretty consistent

[12:26] with what I've been saying on this show.

[12:28] People just think Stern did another cash grab.

[12:31] You don't have to buy it.

[12:32] If you have a friend who has an LE, they probably are wishing they sold it a year ago.

[12:36] So that's it.

[12:37] Everybody hoping somebody soon is going to do something that really makes us happy.

[12:42] I mean it, like just makes us happy.

[12:45] This move by Stern today, did it really make us happy?

[12:47] I don't think so.

[12:48] I don't think it made most people happy because I don't think most people agree with this

[12:52] kind of move.

[12:53] I think it is unethical business decisions to do it like this.

[12:56] I think we're all waiting for Jersey Jack to show us a machine that's going to make

[12:59] us happy again.

[13:00] I think people are excited to see what's next from Spooky Pinball.

[13:04] I think Scooby-Doo, you know, we've seen it a million times.

[13:06] I don't think there's a ton of conversation and buzz around Scooby-Doo right now.

[13:10] I think people are just fingers crossed hoping they get their Centaur machines from Haggis.

[13:14] Who knows?

[13:15] Will they finish the Fathom builds this year?

[13:17] But think about it.

[13:18] Like who's really generating a ton of excitement right now?

[13:21] American Pinball is another one.

[13:23] I think they need their next game out sooner than later.

[13:25] They're not going to get people reignited into Galactic Tank Force.

[13:29] You know, I listened to a little bit of the Dennis Nordman interview on the Slam Tilt

[13:32] podcast and I have to say, like, it's like all he wanted to do was make this interesting

[13:37] cabinet.

[13:38] It's like the weirdest thing ever.

[13:40] I get what he was going for, but man, the whole thing just doesn't come together for

[13:44] me.

[13:45] All right, so that's two shows in two days.

[13:47] Hopefully I'll get a little bit more news on this new pinball machine coming out.

[13:51] It's definitely happening.

[13:52] It's definitely a company we haven't heard from before and it's definitely going to

[13:56] be running on this fast pinball board.

[13:59] I will say this, people have done a good job respecting the NDAs around that game because

[14:04] nobody's really talking.

[14:06] We know it's happening.

[14:07] They're dropping these teasers around at different pinball shows and speaking of pinball

[14:11] shows, I heard the rooms for Texas Pinball Festival sold out in like two minutes.

[14:16] So yeah, for everyone out there saying like, oh, pinball is losing its momentum, like people

[14:21] are going to be leaving this hobby.

[14:22] They're not.

[14:23] They're not.

[14:24] There's a lot of enthusiasm for pinball and there's a lot of wealthy people that will

[14:27] float this hobby.

[14:29] And I don't even think we've seen the price ceiling, which is crazy to say.

[14:32] Everybody, thank you for being a club member.

[14:34] We'll be back with more shows.

[14:35] Maybe this week we'll see what happens, but I'm so happy you're here listening to

[14:38] Canadian Spinball Podcast later.
