[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:22] Happy Saturday morning.

[00:23] We are going to have to move the Saturday morning spectacular to tomorrow because Killian

[00:28] has T-Ball.

[00:29] I went to Allentown yesterday.

[00:32] If I didn't see you there, I did not stay very long.

[00:37] I stayed for about two hours, but I just want to say for those people I did meet, it was

[00:42] very nice meeting you.

[00:44] I got a chance to jump on the newest pinball machines, King Kong from Stern Pinball and

[00:51] Dune Pinball from Barrels of Fun.

[00:54] I want to share with you my first impressions of both games.

[00:59] I got a decent amount of time on both.

[01:02] I have some opinions I'm going to share.

[01:04] We're going to get to that.

[01:06] I just want to say though, if you went to the show yesterday or are going today, prepare

[01:13] to be disappointed, there is only one King Kong game there in the Cointaker booth.

[01:24] That is a tragedy.

[01:26] The line to get on the game was about an hour long and it is on three balls.

[01:33] We sat there and we played games for a while.

[01:37] If you're looking to go on a Saturday when the show is going to be super crowded, you

[01:43] are most likely not going to get any time on King Kong on the ride back from the show.

[01:49] Frank, thanks so much for taking us.

[01:51] I just felt like I should have just waited and gone to automate it.

[01:57] Not go two and a half hours to wait a long time to play the games, but just go a half

[02:02] hour.

[02:03] Mike is going to unbox the games.

[02:05] He's going to get some games soon.

[02:07] He's getting L.E.'s in this week.

[02:09] I see people are unboxing their L.E.'s and setting them up.

[02:13] Congratulations, if you got one.

[02:15] Congratulations because you just also lost $3,000.

[02:20] We're going to talk about it.

[02:21] You know, Retro Ralph, I want to give him a shout out.

[02:23] He hit me up.

[02:24] He's like, Chris, you keep harping on price and your show is stale because of it.

[02:31] Ralph, we're stale.

[02:32] He's not wrong in the sense that I haven't impacted the prices of pinball machines.

[02:36] I haven't.

[02:37] Like I've been harping on these high prices for a while.

[02:40] Have any of these companies lowered their prices?

[02:43] No, but you don't get change in life if you stop.

[02:47] I don't think it's stale.

[02:49] I think it is the topic of the time.

[02:52] As I went around the show and I played all these games, there was evil dead there.

[02:56] There was everything new.

[02:57] There was Avatar.

[02:59] When you get your hands on every single new machine and you experience what all of these

[03:05] modern pinball machines are putting into their games, you can't help but walk away and feel

[03:12] like none of this.

[03:14] None of this is worth even $10,000.

[03:18] None of it.

[03:19] Heck, most of these games are far more than $10,000 and that's just how I feel.

[03:26] When I play these games and I get satisfied with playing them, I would rather leave and

[03:32] go home and have $10,000 to $15,000 still in my checking account and just get my fill

[03:39] now on location if this is how much modern pinball is.

[03:44] I get that some of you out there, you want to spend your money on this.

[03:48] I just don't think most modern games are giving the magic that warrants these extremely high

[03:57] prices.

[03:58] Okay, let's talk about Kong and Dune and then we'll talk about some of my other observations

[04:03] at the show and we'll also discuss what's going on in pinball if there is any news.

[04:09] Let's just start with Alice real quick.

[04:11] There's no way they're going to make all the Alice games by the end of the year.

[04:16] You guys know this, but what will happen is they will make, I don't know, like 350, then

[04:23] the decision will be yours if your game is not made.

[04:28] You can go get a refund.

[04:30] That's what they said they were going to do.

[04:32] Here's what I think is going to happen.

[04:33] I think they're going to come up short on that 500 number.

[04:37] I think they're going to be somewhere around like 350 to 400.

[04:41] I think what's going to happen is the last 100 or so games they might not make because

[04:49] I think what will happen between now and the end of the year is enough Alice's will be

[04:55] made and once people start trading these things, if they start to trade for below 12.5 and you

[05:03] can go get one, then the people who have a deposit down for one at 12.5, that's nonrefundable,

[05:12] they're going to get their money back and go buy one for less than they're on the hook

[05:18] for.

[05:19] That is what I think is going to happen.

[05:20] If I were a betting man, I would say they're not going to make all 500 Alice's.

[05:25] I think it might end up around 450 or 425 or something like that.

[05:30] It just goes to show you, there's only so long you can delay getting people the product.

[05:36] Remember, the product was supposed to go out the door in January and it's mid-May people.

[05:41] It is mid-freaking May and does anybody have their Alice adventures in Wonderland game

[05:47] and with Harry Potter right around the corner?

[05:50] We didn't get anything on Harry Potter Day.

[05:52] Who told you you were getting nothing on Harry Potter Day?

[05:55] Canated it.

[05:56] I was kind of excited that nothing happened because it means I'm right once again.

[06:02] We are right every once in a while on this stale edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[06:08] The only Pinball Podcaster that has almost 700 paying subscribers because each and every

[06:14] one of you finds this show to be stale.

[06:17] It's just the same show every time.

[06:19] While I'm about to tell you something that's not stale, I'm going to give you my hot take

[06:23] on King Kong and Dune.

[06:25] Let's start with King Kong first.

[06:28] This game is the latest game from Keith Elwyn.

[06:32] It's got the same coding team and I walked up to it and I will say in person a few things.

[06:37] The colors are not as bad in real life.

[06:42] What I mean by that, it's not like over the top, overly saturated clown puke like people

[06:50] were saying.

[06:51] It's much more muted in real life.

[06:55] There's still way too much going on.

[06:59] I will say this, when you look down at the play field because there's so much going on

[07:03] and there's so much happening with inserts and details and illustrations and Kong at

[07:09] the gate and there's a woman with a torch and there's a spider and there's a big gorilla.

[07:13] All of that stuff, the artwork on the play field just doesn't do anything for me.

[07:19] It just doesn't.

[07:20] It doesn't leave any indelible impression.

[07:24] It's not a great art package.

[07:27] It's not bad.

[07:28] It's just not great.

[07:30] There's nothing about it that makes you feel giddy like when you stand over a game.

[07:35] I don't know.

[07:36] Let's say something like Ghostbusters art package.

[07:38] Wow, right?

[07:39] What a work of art.

[07:40] Kong's play field just doesn't feel like something when the game is off, you'd walk by it and

[07:46] really sort of like be mesmerized by what's on the play field artistically.

[07:51] I'm going to give you an example.

[07:53] I felt the complete opposite when I first walked over the Uncanny X-Men.

[07:58] I think Uncanny X-Men is one of the coolest art packages ever on a play field.

[08:03] I love the uniqueness of it.

[08:05] I think Zombie Eddie's art style on that game.

[08:07] I think X-Men as an overall game is so much nicer to walk up to than King Kong.

[08:14] It's so much prettier.

[08:16] It's so much more cohesive and that's the other thing.

[08:19] I don't really love the artwork on the cabinet.

[08:22] I don't.

[08:23] It just feels a lot more like a kid's comic book versus King Kong.

[08:30] You know?

[08:31] And again, because I just think this isn't how all of us think about King Kong when we

[08:37] think about King Kong art.

[08:38] You know, I know we had similar response to Godzilla.

[08:41] It wasn't the Toho Godzilla looking feel and I would agree.

[08:45] I also don't think Godzilla as an art package is one of Stern's best.

[08:49] The other thing I noticed when I first walked up to the game was how big King Kong is.

[08:55] I think there's a false narrative and I was perpetuating it that this is a recycled version

[09:00] of the Incredible Hulk mechanism from the Avengers.

[09:05] And ladies and gentlemen, King Kong is twice the size of that Incredible Hulk in Avengers.

[09:10] So this is not the same exact mech.

[09:13] It might be driven by the same internals, but King Kong is big.

[09:17] Like he's really big back there.

[09:20] He's twice the size of Godzilla in Godzilla.

[09:23] Like he's up there.

[09:24] He's moving his arms.

[09:26] It almost looks like he's masturbating in midair, but he's up there.

[09:29] He's moving and grooving.

[09:31] He's shaking.

[09:32] He's doing his thing.

[09:33] He's hitting the subway car.

[09:34] He even stops the ball.

[09:36] I heard they're going to make him touch the glass as like a knocking moment in the game.

[09:40] And look, it is King Kong.

[09:43] Like he really does dominate what you look at when you look at in the game.

[09:48] You know, seeing him back there in the upper right really does sort of force most of your

[09:54] attention to go in that direction.

[09:57] But what's interesting about that is I did find like most of the interesting shots in

[10:03] this game are in the other direction.

[10:06] Starting from the ramp up the middle to the shots on the left side of the game, that seems

[10:11] to be where the more interesting stuff happens.

[10:14] I spent in total maybe about like 15 minutes on this game.

[10:18] I had one really long game on King Kong.

[10:23] And after playing it, you know, what are my thoughts?

[10:25] It's hard, right?

[10:26] It's my first time playing it.

[10:27] So first impressions, you always have to take with a grain of salt.

[10:31] Also, you know, know that I played the game at a show.

[10:34] So it's not like the call outs and all the stuff was coming at me in the right way.

[10:40] And I'm sure people who went to Stern had a similar experience when you're playing a

[10:44] game and it's noisy and it's crowded and there's people waiting to get on the machine behind

[10:51] you.

[10:52] All of that goes against your first impressions with the game.

[10:56] See we know what's going to happen now is all these guys that unbox their LEs and spent

[11:02] $13,000, they're going to gush about the game because they own it.

[11:08] They're going to justify owning it and they're going to say it's amazing.

[11:12] I want to say this, I think this is a really good shooter.

[11:15] Obviously, it's a Keith Elwin game.

[11:18] I don't think it shoots as well as Godzilla and I don't think this game pulls you in nearly

[11:25] as much as Godzilla pulls you in from the moment you hit start in Godzilla on day one.

[11:31] And I played Godzilla right when it came out from the moment you hit start.

[11:37] Godzilla just grips you more.

[11:39] It grips you with the assets, it grips you with the music, it grips you with the callouts

[11:45] and I think the Godzilla layout is far more interesting than King Kong.

[11:51] I also think Godzilla's mechanisms, all of them, are far more interesting than the mechs

[11:57] happening in King Kong and that's what I want to talk about next.

[12:00] I just really feel bad that in a Keith Elwin game, right?

[12:05] This is the best designer in the world.

[12:08] His games are Stern's hottest selling games.

[12:12] His games should be statement pieces about what this company can do.

[12:18] Everybody remembers when Godzilla came out, it reignited our faith in Stern pinball that

[12:23] they can really engineer truly innovative mechanisms, right?

[12:28] The building, the bridge, the mecha-Godzilla, that magnet that grabs the ball and throws

[12:35] it back at you.

[12:37] Everything that's in Godzilla, collectively, the wire forms, the ramps, everything about

[12:42] the game just came together in such an amazing way and that is why Godzilla is celebrated

[12:48] the way it is and then they hit you with every single asset you want if you love the theme.

[12:55] And I just want to say this about King Kong.

[12:58] Everything in King Kong comes up short when you look at it through that lens.

[13:04] One of the mechanisms are that interesting.

[13:07] They're just not.

[13:08] The gong is not that much fun nor is it that satisfying to shoot.

[13:14] The spider is the modern version of a Thai fighter on a spring.

[13:19] I am so shocked that Keith Elwin and the design team ended up with that as a mechanism in

[13:27] his game.

[13:28] It's so lazy and it also looks so silly in real life.

[13:32] The spider is on this metal piece and then it just starts vibrating and it keeps vibrating

[13:38] after you've even been in that area, after the magnets grab the ball and it's just distracting.

[13:44] It's like someone taking their finger and just moving it up and down.

[13:47] And how did the biggest pinball company, with the best designer in all of pinball, with

[13:53] the biggest team of engineers, both mechanical engineers, software engineers, just the most

[13:58] amount of people, how did they stand over this and say this is going to go into the

[14:03] game?

[14:04] It just feels like a cheap trick.

[14:07] It feels bad.

[14:08] It feels like an afterthought.

[14:10] It was just disappointing.

[14:11] I mean, I've just got to say that it was just like seeing the mechs in this game and you

[14:15] think about the subject matter of King Kong.

[14:18] I really did miss not being able to A-bash King Kong.

[14:24] I did miss not being able to actually swat at and hit an airplane.

[14:30] I did miss not feeling like I was climbing a building.

[14:34] I did miss not feeling like I'm banging on a gate in a jungle.

[14:39] You don't feel like you're ever battling anything like a dinosaur or a T-Rex.

[14:44] All of that's happening on the screen.

[14:46] So I think from a mechanical standpoint and toys in a game, I do think the toys in King

[14:53] Kong are just underwhelming.

[14:55] The toys and jaws were underwhelming.

[14:59] And maybe this is just it now, people.

[15:01] Maybe he peaked with his toys when it comes to Godzilla because we know that Keith Owens'

[15:07] whole thing is not about toys.

[15:09] It's all about gameplay.

[15:11] So let's go there.

[15:12] Like, how does the game shoot?

[15:13] Well, the game does shoot phenomenally well.

[15:16] I think you're going to be very, very happy with this game.

[15:19] There's a lot of interesting things happening in this game.

[15:23] And that is really what is the genius of Keith Owens is that there are more ball paths than

[15:29] you realize.

[15:30] And you discover them in all these different unique ways.

[15:34] And the ball doesn't always do what you expect it to do in terms of the shot geometry.

[15:39] There's this really interesting plastic in the middle of the left side.

[15:42] I think it's like the river where the ball goes through it.

[15:45] It's interesting what's happening down by the left out lane and how the ball is fed

[15:49] into the left flipper.

[15:51] The upper right flipper shot into the airplane that loops around that wire form.

[15:57] That is probably and easily the most rewarding shot in the game.

[16:03] It is super cool, super satisfying.

[16:06] It's definitely a game where you're not going to learn.

[16:10] You're not going to learn the magic of the gameplay in one day at a show in Allentown.

[16:16] I think this is going to be a game where homeowners, when they have it and they got a lot of time

[16:22] on it, they'll be able to judge better where this game falls in terms of Keith Owens best

[16:28] shooters.

[16:29] If you were to ask me right now, just from a first impression of all the Elwin games I've

[16:34] ever played, I think two of them stand out the most in terms of fun to shoot.

[16:39] And those two games are Avengers and Godzilla.

[16:43] I think those are his two best shooting games when you first hop on the game and you're

[16:49] just enjoying the gameplay.

[16:51] From there, I would probably go Iron Maiden and then Jurassic Park.

[16:56] And that's just me saying it's too early for me to know exactly where King Kong will fall

[17:01] into the mix.

[17:02] I am worried though after playing this game.

[17:05] I am worried that I think when the gameplay wears off a little bit, when the mechs don't

[17:11] really have wow moments, because none of these mechs do have wow moments.

[17:15] I do worry that this code and the way the game is coming at you is just not going to

[17:22] click.

[17:23] The moment I first played Jaws and you see Roy getting into the Jeep, you're in the Jaws

[17:30] movie.

[17:31] The moment you first hit start on Godzilla and you hear that call out and the dinanit,

[17:37] dinanit, nanananit, nanananit, like you're in it, it just grabs you.

[17:43] This game does not have that feeling and I'm just not sure it's ever gonna have that feeling.

[17:51] I just think the way it's coded, the way the assets are coming at you are just not gonna

[17:58] emotionally, you know, make you feel the goosebumps you'd feel when you play

[18:03] games like Godzilla and Jaws. There is a lot of code that needs to happen in this

[18:09] game as well. And because of that, here is my recommendation for each and every

[18:14] one of you. If you really want to play King Kong right now, I think what you'll

[18:19] enjoy the most about this game, it's not going to be the artwork, it's not going

[18:24] to be the mechanisms. I think what you're going to enjoy most is the shot layout.

[18:30] And that is why if I were you, I would just go grab a King Kong Pro. If you buy a

[18:37] Pro, you're gonna get the best parts of this game. You're not gonna miss out on

[18:42] anything that's really magical. And it's the same exact software, right? As in the

[18:48] premium and the LE. I don't think you're gonna miss the balls locking into the

[18:52] subway car. I don't think you're gonna miss the gong. You're definitely not

[18:56] gonna miss that cheap spider. And you're gonna get all the great shots. Also, if

[19:01] you buy a Pro right now and you enjoy it, you're not gonna lose much money. I

[19:07] really do believe if you buy a $13,000 LE, you're gonna lose your shirt. The

[19:13] artwork, the armor, everything about that LE, it's just not that special. And

[19:18] again, I think making $932 at $13,000 this games, it's not gonna be the next

[19:26] Godzilla. It's not. It's not gonna grab people the way Jaws does. Jaws has 50

[19:32] years of people loving that iconic movie. That's why people don't want to sell Jaws

[19:39] LE. It's also like the LE package of that game is so much nicer than the

[19:45] premium and the pro. But Kong, man, it kind of all looks and feels the same. So

[19:51] that's my first impressions of King Kong. Great shooter, mechs that are not that

[19:56] magical. Kong is really big and will be the focal point of your attention when

[20:02] you play the game. I wish he interacted with the ball a bit more. And I also just

[20:08] think the mechs in this game, I think it's just really disappointing to see that

[20:13] spider mech in a Keith Elwyn game. It just felt really cheap. It needed more

[20:19] magic in the mech department that it does not have. And given the source

[20:24] material of King Kong climbing a building and hitting planes and battling major

[20:30] monsters on an island, I just don't think the creativity in the mechs is there.

[20:37] They just didn't go far enough with the creativity. And when you're playing the

[20:41] game, you don't really feel like you're either in a jungle or a city. It's just

[20:47] all happening in front of you. It's not terrible. You know what I'm saying? Like

[20:51] it doesn't feel like a world under glass. It feels like a King Kong pop up book

[20:57] where he's just up there in the upper right corner. But I don't feel like I'm

[21:00] in New York City. And I also don't feel like I'm in a jungle. I just feel like

[21:04] I'm in this like colorful pop up book that is inspired by King Kong, if you

[21:09] will. So ultimately, I think all of you should just wait. I would absolutely

[21:14] wait because there's a lot more code that needs to go into this game. And I

[21:17] don't think it's ready for prime time. And I think if all of you wait, you'll

[21:22] be able to get any model of King Kong for much less money. Heck, I'll probably

[21:27] buy retro Ralph's for 10 grand when he's ready to sell it. We all know he didn't

[21:31] pay 13 for it. Oh, damn shots fired, Ralph. Damn it. Can you stop firing these

[21:36] stale shots at your boy retro Ralph? No, I love Ralph. He's a great guy. We have

[21:40] good back and forth. He can take it. He can take it. All right. So Dune Pimbal,

[21:45] Dune Pimbal walk over to Dune Pimbal. There was more than one Dune Machine at

[21:49] the show, which was nice. I was able to play with Cliff Albert Cliff. It was

[21:54] awesome watching him blow up the game. I mean, he's a good player. And he was on

[21:59] this game for a long time. Here's the thing about Dune Pimbal walking up to

[22:04] it. It is a really beautiful machine. It is. I know it's brown, but it definitely

[22:09] if you're a fan of these Dune movies, it definitely does the movie justice. The

[22:15] Translight is really nice seeing all of those actors up there. It is Dune Movie

[22:21] in Pimbal format. Looking down at the game, such a radically different looking

[22:27] game than King Kong. It's almost so jarringly different when you go from the

[22:33] colorful King Kong world to the sandy world of Dune. And look, there's not a lot

[22:39] of artwork on this Dune Playfield, but coming from the clutter of the King Kong

[22:44] Playfield, I actually really do appreciate the simplicity of the Dune

[22:50] artwork. I do. I do. Maybe it's something as I get older in life. I'm more about

[22:55] simplicity and zen. And when it comes to art, I think it's important not to

[23:00] overdo it. And you know, you want details. You also want there to be an area of

[23:05] focus. And I think Dune has that and Dune is obviously pushing you up. The artwork,

[23:11] it's moving your eye to the north of the Playfield where they can show off all

[23:15] the sculpts, the sandworm, all the shots that are in the game. Now, here's my

[23:19] take on Dune right now. There's just not enough in this game right now to really

[23:24] adequately review the game. And not only when I was playing it, Cliff was blown the

[23:29] game up. He was on the game for like eight minutes and he's like, I'm hitting

[23:32] everything and nothing is really happening right now. There is no callouts.

[23:37] Nothing's guiding you through the game. When there were movie clips up, it said

[23:42] on the clips themselves, waiting for license or approval. And there's just

[23:47] not much game. You got that cool screen in the back under the glass. Nothing's

[23:52] really happening on that screen right now. I just want to say this, this game

[23:57] is not ready. And I just don't think it's ready to be shipping to customers

[24:02] like this. And so my review of this game or first impressions of this game is

[24:08] just that. It's just not ready. Like the things I did like the sandworm mech, I

[24:13] got to see that go. Really cool mech in the game. I mean, it is. And I think

[24:18] they're going to obviously incorporate that in really interesting ways. Was

[24:22] it too slow? I didn't find it too slow. And coming from King Kong, it was just

[24:27] nice to see a mech do something absolutely cool that I'd never seen before.

[24:32] I'd never seen a mech do that before. So I applaud the creativity that went into

[24:38] that mechanism. The other thing that I noticed and I noticed this on Labyrinth

[24:44] and I'm not sure what the fix is. The flipper power in this game was really

[24:51] weak. Now, sometimes you get weak flippers at a show, but that wasn't the case

[24:55] with King Kong. It played perfectly fine. And it was at the same show. So I just

[25:01] don't understand why any game in 2025 has weak flipper feel. Everybody has

[25:10] told these companies we want games that feel like a stern. The flippers

[25:16] should be strong. They should be snappy. The other thing I noticed about the

[25:21] Dune flippers is when you flip them, they don't really flip up at a steep angle

[25:28] that makes trapping the ball easy. At the top of the flipper travel, it still

[25:33] feels like it's only at like a 30 degree angle. And the ball rolls off those

[25:38] flippers a lot easier than other games. I prefer games that have a little bit

[25:43] of a steeper, you know, like 40 degree angle on the flipper where it's easier

[25:47] to trap. It's easier to control the ball that way. But the flipper power was my

[25:53] biggest concern because there's this steep ramp on the left side of Dune. And

[25:58] the first few games we were playing, the ball couldn't make it all the way up

[26:03] it. It would only make it up that ramp if you hit the ball on the fly as it was

[26:08] coming off the right flipper. But you couldn't trap with the right flipper

[26:12] and make it up that ramp successfully. And that's an issue, right? I just

[26:15] don't think the game was set up right. The thing I liked the most about Dune

[26:20] was the music. And there's moments in this game where that orchestration is

[26:25] going and you've got the music and you've got this sort of like intensity of the

[26:30] scenes from the film itself, which is really awesome to hear. Now, what I

[26:35] don't know is if the gameplay with flippers that are not so strong and

[26:39] you've got this intense music going, I think the gameplay needs to mirror that

[26:45] excitement of the music. And I think it's all way too early. It's a shame,

[26:51] right? Because if you're bringing Dune to a show, it's not done enough to leave

[26:56] a successful first impression. Then what's the point of releasing it right

[27:01] now? What's the point of having it at a show? It's like, then the only way you're

[27:06] going to win people over is with the art, is with the theme. And we all know

[27:12] this, that I just don't think Dune is a strong enough theme where you're

[27:16] willing to buy it early on because it's a bolt to your floor theme. I just

[27:21] don't think people feel that way about Dune. And so my overall feeling about

[27:26] this game is I want to play it in like three to four months when there's a lot

[27:31] more in it. I don't think buying one right now makes any sense because it's

[27:36] just not far enough along. And I'm worried about that with them because when

[27:41] Harry Potter comes out in just a few weeks, it's going to be fully baked.

[27:45] This isn't going to be like, oh yeah, we got a way to see what, no, no, no, no,

[27:48] no, no, no. Harry Potter, when it comes out, will be like 95% done. Right now,

[27:54] as it stands, Dune feels like it's 40% done. That's not enough. And again,

[28:00] you only get one chance to make a first impression. And I've said this to David.

[28:05] I'll say it to the team over there again. I think these guys put a lot of

[28:08] passion into this machine. But if you can't serve it up on day one, in a way

[28:14] that is showcasing magic, you got to hold back. You got to wait because

[28:20] you're not going to get another chance to make that first impression. So that's

[28:24] my take on Dune is another one where I recommend you really should just wait

[28:30] until the code is further along. And I'm just shocked that with all the people

[28:34] over there, they thought that this was ready to get out. I think a lot of people

[28:39] were afraid of getting lost with King Kong and with Harry Potter. But if you're

[28:44] afraid of being lost in the mix, and it's going to get very crowded still,

[28:49] though, like if you show up in a crowd, think about this metaphor. If you show

[28:53] up and there's a crowd that's formed, do you want to walk into the crowd half

[28:58] naked? And that's what they look like. They've showed up and they're shirtless

[29:02] with so much missing in the game. I don't think most people are walking up to

[29:07] Dune, just so giddy that there's finally a Dune machine in the world. And I think

[29:13] they need to win people over. And this is not how you win people over by releasing

[29:19] it way too early. Evil Dead was there, got to meet spooky Luke. Great guy. He was the

[29:25] only thing at the show with bigger arms than King Kong. He's built like a tank. I

[29:29] need to get him as my security when people start calling my show stale. I will

[29:33] say Evil Dead. I know I was wearing a shirt that said spooky shill. I still think

[29:38] Evil Dead. When it comes to total package, even though it's not a theme I love,

[29:44] Evil Dead is out of all the new games. I mean, this King Kong, Dune, Avatar, all

[29:51] the new games that are out there in the world right now. I got to see Portal,

[29:54] which looked really cool. I didn't get to play Portal because the line was so long

[29:58] and I wasn't going to wait, but it looked really cool. Nobody was online to play

[30:02] Princess Bride. I played that game. It feels empty. Next to Portal, Princess

[30:05] Bride feels so empty. But I will say Evil Dead looks the best. It looks the most

[30:11] loaded. It just aesthetically looks the best. It's just a game that puts a smile

[30:17] on your face like nothing else at the show. I mean it when I say it. If these

[30:23] guys have Beetlejuice next, it's going to sell out in 10 minutes. Not even one

[30:28] minute. They're going to sell a thousand Beetlejuices in less than 10 minutes.

[30:33] To me, spooky is like, it's crazy to me. Spooky's now got the most impressive

[30:39] looking Pimbal machine out of all the manufacturers. Did you ever think we were

[30:43] going to say that 10 years ago? And this is the issue. It's like has Stern Pimbal

[30:48] elevated its game over the last decade? Has Jersey Jack? Everybody else is still

[30:54] making the same games. And that to me, Ralph, is what's stale in Pimbal. Where's

[31:00] Stern Pimbal's expression lighting in King Kong? It's not there. Where's the

[31:05] larger screen? Where's Spike 3? Where's innovation? It's just the same over and

[31:12] over and over again. You know, Jersey Jack's same platform over and over and

[31:17] over again. And they've yanked all the toys out of its games. The only company

[31:21] that's like, innovated and advanced is Spooky Pimbal. Now you could argue they

[31:26] needed to. Yeah, but now they've gone a step further than everybody else. Even

[31:30] though the price is north of the $10,000 I was talking about, they sold every

[31:35] single one of these evil deads. I'm telling you right now, if Beetlejuice is a

[31:39] game that's like 12 grand and there's only a thousand, I think the demand's

[31:43] gonna be so damn high, you're gonna be looking at a game that stays, stays at

[31:47] like 15k to get one. If it looks like this and we know Franchi's gonna crush it,

[31:52] we know they're gonna put tons of toys in the game. And then the goodwill of the

[31:56] company, it's just total package. Everything about it makes you feel good.

[32:00] You know, when I look at King Kong, I feel like, they cut corners. I feel like the

[32:04] creativity wasn't really there. Dune's obviously an improvement over Labyrinth,

[32:08] but still, you know, it's still half-baked. You can't show up to the party now with a

[32:14] half-baked incomplete game. And you need to take your time to get it right. Take

[32:18] your time to get it right. Spooky Pimbal didn't release evil dead and ship it to

[32:22] people when it was so incomplete. They didn't. There's enough in it to make you

[32:27] feel great. And that should be something that all these manufacturers taken to

[32:31] consideration. We can't launch these games until there's enough in it that

[32:35] makes people feel great on day one. And I'll end this show by saying on my trip back,

[32:40] as I think about a lot of these new games like King Kong and Dune and Evil Dead and Avatar,

[32:47] you know, we're now in a stage where it really is gameplay that a lot of people are gushing about,

[32:54] right? You're not seeing people gush about the Kong mechs. It's the gameplay. And I'm just here

[33:00] to tell you right now, out of all the games I've played in the last like two years, if what I wanted

[33:07] was a game that was just the most fun to shoot, let's just stop there. The game that I've played

[33:14] that's just the most fun to shoot. Doesn't have the greatest toys. It still is a beautiful game.

[33:21] But if game plays your thing, if the fun that you want to have to justify the prices of Pimbal

[33:27] is all about how fun is it to shoot, there is no better game than Elton John. Elton John is so

[33:36] much more fun to shoot than King Kong. It's more fun to shoot than Dune. It's the most fun I've had

[33:44] from just a gameplay standpoint. I still don't want to own it because of the theme. But again,

[33:49] but for those of you out there that are going to defend King Kong's lack of magical mechs because

[33:54] it's got gameplay, I'm just here to tell you it doesn't shoot as good as Elton John. It's not as

[34:01] much fun to jump on it as Elton John. And also right now it doesn't have the moments. Elton John

[34:06] really has like awesome moments in the software that are so much fun. And it's just a rocking good

[34:12] time. Everybody, thank you for being a member of the world's most stale Pimbal podcast. Never a

[34:17] shill, not in the back pocket, not sponsored by distros, not spending my money to fly to

[34:23] manufacturers. I'm keeping it real and I know you love it. Canada out.
