[00:00] It's a world of laughter, a world of kiss.

[00:04] It's a world of hopes and a world of kiss.

[00:08] There's so much that we share that it's time we're aware.

[00:12] It's a small world after all.

[00:15] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:19] Aw, welcome everybody.

[00:21] Canada is back from Disney World.

[00:23] It was exhausting.

[00:25] It is chaotic.

[00:26] It is a total mess for parents trying to navigate how to get their little toddler from A to B at Disney World.

[00:33] I will say this.

[00:34] Killian had the time of his life and that is all that matters.

[00:38] I'm not even looking at how much money it costs, but I will say this.

[00:43] Disney has a lot of work to do to make that place feel magical.

[00:47] You can just see the looks on the parents' faces as they are staring at their cell phones trying to figure out how to get on the next ride.

[00:55] So they don't have to wait three hours to see Winnie the Pooh that only lasts three minutes.

[01:01] Alright everybody, let's talk about pinball.

[01:04] I had a week away.

[01:05] And the reason why I wanted to call this show something different is after a week away from pinball.

[01:11] A week away from pinside.

[01:13] I didn't go on Facebook live.

[01:14] I didn't even think about pinball for a week.

[01:17] And now as I'm getting back into the pinball fold, you know what it feels like?

[01:21] It feels like imagine if pinball was a room

[01:24] and you were about to re-engage the pinball community and you're looking into the room.

[01:29] What would you see?

[01:30] Would you see people laughing?

[01:32] Would you see people like cheers-ing and having a good time and hugging it out and celebrating and making it the kind of room you just can't wait to run into?

[01:41] Instead, it's like a bunch of people still arguing about a pinball machine they've never played.

[01:47] And after a week away from this, I wanted to call this podcast

[01:51] Pinball Patience, Paranoia and Profit.

[01:55] And I think those are the four things I want everybody to think about on this episode.

[02:00] No, we're not going to talk about the latest rumor that maybe there's going to be a little shop of horrors pinball machine.

[02:07] I don't know about some of you out there, but I'm just getting so tired of 15 pinball companies.

[02:13] Here's all the rumors of what might be coming around the corner.

[02:17] Who the heck has money to buy 15 pinball machines?

[02:20] The whole new and box pinball thing is about to collapse.

[02:23] Everybody knows it.

[02:24] There's no room for all of these companies about to drop products between like nine and fifteen thousand dollars.

[02:31] And all we're thinking about and all we're dreaming about is what's around the corner and what's currently available.

[02:38] Who really wants most of it?

[02:39] I mean, be honest with yourselves.

[02:41] Who really wants to spend more than ten thousand dollars on what's currently available in the pinball marketplace?

[02:48] And we're going to talk a little bit about that, but let's just start with the first P on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast pinball.

[02:54] It's just pinball people.

[02:56] This isn't a cure for cancer.

[02:58] And I really do implore each and every one of you.

[03:01] This is pinball.

[03:02] It is a toy.

[03:03] Yes.

[03:04] Is it overpriced?

[03:05] Absolutely.

[03:06] Is there innovation happening in every single game?

[03:09] Absolutely not.

[03:10] Does the product stay pretty much the same every single year?

[03:14] Absolutely.

[03:15] Are we seeing less go into these games than there used to be in these games for a lot more money?

[03:21] Yes.

[03:22] Has Stern pinball and Jersey Jack absolutely destroyed the collectability of pinball?

[03:27] Yes.

[03:28] Buying an LE is no longer a smart decision.

[03:30] We're going to talk about that.

[03:32] But at the end of the day, when you stop thinking about pinball and you engage in everything else going on in the world, like go on to any media site, any news site, look at the vapid content kids are looking at on Tik Tok.

[03:44] At the end of the day, it's pinball.

[03:46] And we're here because we enjoy pinball.

[03:48] Now look, what I'm asking each and every one of you to do is just look at this hobby a little bit differently as we go into 2024.

[03:56] The amount of bickering and complaining and arguing and over cheerleading a game you've never played is really what's taking the fun out of the hobby for me.

[04:06] I would just like us to get back to a place in which we can discuss pinball topics.

[04:11] We can discuss a new game without people who bought the LE saying it's the greatest game ever and then people who can't afford the damn game saying it's the worst game ever.

[04:21] And there's so much back and forth moaning and groaning around these titles and here's the good news for everybody.

[04:28] If you just don't care about buying a limited edition version of any of these games because none of these games are limited or scarce or will be hard to get and chances are you're going to lose a ton of money if you want to buy a game.

[04:40] If you just remove that FOMO then each and every one of us can just go back to the way it used to be.

[04:49] You could jump on a machine, you could know you like it, you could play it for months, heck you could play it for a year and then you could go get one anytime you want for probably a lot less money than it was brand new.

[05:02] And you can just absorb the game without being so emotionally defending it or so vitriolically downgrading the machine before you've even played it.

[05:13] I think it's getting to the point where it's kind of exhausting.

[05:16] Now look, I think a lot of that behavior happens on pinside and I think for a lot of you out there, you're much more even keel, you're much more middle of the road.

[05:25] I don't know about you, but I've calmed down like Jaws doesn't offend me.

[05:30] I'm not annoyed by the lack of toys in Jaws because I'm not going to buy one and I'm happy for people who love the theme because they get a Keith Elwyn Jaws machine.

[05:39] Is it the second coming of pinball? Absolutely not.

[05:43] Is there a lot of innovation in the game? Absolutely not.

[05:46] But am I going to waste the small time I have on planet Earth?

[05:50] Arguing with people about it, like why argue about it? Just don't buy it.

[05:54] The greatest way you can send a message that this is not as great as it should be is to just not buy one, but you then don't have to march into places where people are excited about the game and try to reign on their parade.

[06:09] Like let the Neil McCraves of the world, let the guys who ordered LEs that say this is the greatest game ever, let them have their fun, this is what they need.

[06:19] They need to convince themselves that every single stern LE is amazing and nothing you say is going to change their mind and nothing they say is going to change your mind.

[06:30] And so it's just pointless to get into that debate.

[06:34] So in the end, just try to approach everything with that lens of it's just pinball, it's a toy, it's wood, it's lights, it's a steel ball, it's some software.

[06:44] None of this is going to make your life significantly better.

[06:47] Most of you don't need more pinball machines.

[06:50] Most of you would be a lot happier if you thinned out your pinball collections.

[06:55] You know, we're starting to see some of the older collectors get out of the hobby and you see the message, right?

[07:00] I want to simplify my life.

[07:02] I want to travel more.

[07:04] I want to have more experiences that are meaningful.

[07:06] Guess what's the first thing to go?

[07:08] The static box of lights where each game itself is a round-trip ticket around the world first class to go do something memorable in the short time we have on this planet.

[07:19] And so what's more valuable?

[07:21] Having quarter million dollars in pinball machines or going around the world and having experiences you'll never forget.

[07:28] Now for some of you, you can do both.

[07:30] But if I had to choose, I'd rather just have a couple pinball machines in my home and have the rest of my money going towards memories, not material possessions like pinball.

[07:41] Now that's not a message Stern wants you to hear.

[07:44] It's not a message the distributors want you to hear, but it's something that we all know deep down inside.

[07:50] Less is more in life.

[07:52] You've never heard anybody.

[07:53] No wise man would say the pathway to happiness.

[07:57] Acquire as many pinball machines as you can possibly acquire.

[08:02] Absolutely not.

[08:03] Alright, so it's just pinball.

[08:05] The next thing I want to encourage everybody to have, and this goes with the first thing I was saying, is just patience.

[08:11] Patience is really the most valuable thing right now in all of pinball.

[08:15] If you have patience and if you just wait and if you see the way the market plays out on all of these games, and by patience I don't mean just like waiting to buy.

[08:25] I mean sometimes just wait to react a little bit.

[08:29] Wait do you see more of the game?

[08:31] Wait until you play it.

[08:33] And you know where I'm seeing the least amount of patience and I'm just gonna say this and I'm gonna do this broadly.

[08:39] Pinball content creators as a whole, most of which have never even played Jaws pinball, they don't have any patience either.

[08:47] Like they're either like praising this game before they've even played it.

[08:50] I bought one.

[08:51] It's amazing.

[08:52] It's a Keith L. One masterpiece.

[08:54] It's like you've never played it.

[08:56] And on the same front there's no patience in like whether or not they're gonna slam the game.

[09:00] This game is terrible.

[09:01] There's no innovation.

[09:02] It's lazy.

[09:03] This and that.

[09:04] There's not many shots.

[09:05] Like this isn't Keith L. One's greatest game.

[09:07] It's one of his worst games.

[09:08] And it's like you've also never played it.

[09:11] And so I just wish there was more patience.

[09:13] Why is there such a rush in the first week or two of a game being revealed for us to either like celebrate it as the greatest ever or to damnify it as the worst game?

[09:23] Now look, we all give first impressions and it's fun, but I think we all need a lot more patience.

[09:28] And I think the impatience is not our fault.

[09:31] The reason why we are all impatient is for so many years, all of us, it's been ingrained in our DNA as a pinball follower.

[09:39] We had to be impatient because we had to make up our mind in just a few minutes on whether or not we were gonna pull the trigger on an LE.

[09:47] Now you can't have a whole community of people that's been engineered to think that way, right?

[09:52] I got to pull the trigger in one day where I'm gonna miss out on getting this game, on getting a Rick and Morty, or on getting an Iron Maiden LE, getting a Ghostbusters LE.

[10:01] So for all of these years as pinheads, we had to make up our mind instantly on a game before we played it, before we even saw much video footage of the game, before we even saw gameplay.

[10:12] A lot of those stern LEs were selling out instantly.

[10:15] And I think we all collectively as a community, we have to unlearn that behavior.

[10:21] We don't need to be impatient anymore.

[10:24] You're never gonna have a hard time getting any single pinball machine for the rest of your life.

[10:29] Every single stern LE that comes out will be available for less than $13,000.

[10:35] If you think Jaws LE is gonna go up in value, you're wrong.

[10:40] Look at what's happened to every single game.

[10:42] They haven't just lost like $1,000.

[10:46] They've all lost $3,000 to $4,000.

[10:49] And those are the limited edition games.

[10:51] We're gonna talk about that when I get to profit.

[10:53] And so we are now in a new period of pinball.

[10:56] Just be patient.

[10:58] Don't rush in and buy anything right away.

[11:01] There is no point whatsoever.

[11:03] And if you're patient, here's what's gonna happen.

[11:06] You're gonna be able to get the game at the best price when the price is the best.

[11:10] There are gonna be a ton available.

[11:12] You're gonna be able to buy the game when the code is complete.

[11:15] You're not gonna have to wait like six to eight months to get final code on James Bond.

[11:19] I mean the people who bought James Bond LE on day one, they got an incomplete game.

[11:24] They waited eight months for the game to get great.

[11:27] And if you marched in now eight months to a year later,

[11:30] now you can have the same exact game they have with code that's much better

[11:35] and save yourself $4,000.

[11:38] You can save yourself $4,000 off of what those people bought their James Bond LEs for.

[11:44] There's no case anymore to being impatient.

[11:47] And when I see all these impatient people getting all riled up,

[11:52] when I see people sending in deposits on games they've never even flipped,

[11:56] and then I'm just saying to myself,

[11:58] man I can't wait to watch these people who order direct from Spooky,

[12:02] and then they're gonna start to complain because distributors are gonna get the games before them.

[12:07] They're gonna be able to cut the line with a cheaper version of the game if they just wait it.

[12:12] There's absolutely zero benefit.

[12:15] There's zero benefit in Pimball now to being impatient, so just be patient.

[12:21] And now the next P is this, profit.

[12:24] There's no profit to be made anymore.

[12:27] There's no profit in Pimball buying New and Box.

[12:31] And I think this is the single most important thing.

[12:34] If you take anything away from this podcast, trust me when I say this,

[12:38] every single New and Box game you buy from now on,

[12:42] the only exception might be Pulp Fiction LE,

[12:45] but every single New and Box game at these prices, you are gonna lose a lot of money.

[12:51] Notice how I said a lot of money.

[12:54] We are now at the point in Pimball,

[12:56] where in LE purchase, you are losing way more money than anyone who buys a pro or premium of the machine.

[13:03] Think about that for a minute.

[13:05] All the LEs that have come out at $13,000, they've all lost at least $3,000.

[13:11] Has any Stern Pro lost $3,000 ever?

[13:16] If you buy a Stern Pro now, right, it's like $6,500.

[13:20] Are you seeing those games for sale in a year for $3,500?

[13:26] No, you're not.

[13:27] But when you buy a $13,000 LE within a year,

[13:31] you're seeing all of them for sale for around $9,000 to $10,000 in one year.

[13:37] So then what is the point?

[13:39] When is everybody gonna wake up and realize you're all getting hosed?

[13:43] And the LE edition, the one that was supposed to hold value,

[13:47] the one that historically always held value,

[13:51] now the LE does not stand for a limited edition,

[13:54] it stands for Loser Edition,

[13:57] because you are losing the most money out of everybody else.

[14:01] And nobody is looking at LE buyers anymore with any envy.

[14:06] It's the other way around.

[14:08] We're looking at LE buyers now like, you're a sucker.

[14:11] You're a sucker because I'm gonna be able to get exactly what you bought

[14:15] just a few months from now for like 30% less money.

[14:19] And everybody knows these games are overpriced.

[14:22] Did you really think we were gonna look down and see a Stern LE

[14:25] and really see freaking $13,000 in value

[14:29] and they don't even give you a topper?

[14:31] People, it's time to wake up.

[14:33] A Stern LE is twice the price of a Stern Pro.

[14:37] Twice the price.

[14:39] And what's different in the game?

[14:41] In upper play field, it has the same exact software,

[14:44] the same lighting system.

[14:46] What are you really spending twice as much money on?

[14:49] Think about that for a minute.

[14:51] When you really stop and think,

[14:53] I'm spending twice as much money for what?

[14:56] For what?

[14:57] For a translate?

[14:59] For some stickers?

[15:01] For some powder coat?

[15:02] For an upper play field?

[15:04] And maybe a couple more coils in the game and a few more toys?

[15:08] And that's it.

[15:09] I mean, if you totaled up everything different from a pro to an LE,

[15:13] I bet you at most you're at $2,000 added to the game.

[15:17] At most!

[15:18] And yet you're spending $6,500 more

[15:22] on the LE version of the game.

[15:25] And you know how we used to say pros are for hoes?

[15:28] I don't know anymore.

[15:29] It's really starting to feel like people who buy the pro version of the machine

[15:33] are not only having the most fun,

[15:36] but their game's gonna hold the greatest value.

[15:39] You're not gonna lose $3,000 on a pro.

[15:42] And so the whole entire hobby has been flipped upside down.

[15:46] It used to be a race to get the LE.

[15:49] If you got an LE, it went up in value instantly,

[15:52] and it held its value nicely.

[15:55] Now it's the complete opposite.

[15:57] And for a lot of people out there, for you collectors out there,

[16:00] this is taking a lot of fun out of the hobby.

[16:03] I don't know about you.

[16:04] I don't even feel like the desire to be in the good graces of distros,

[16:08] and oh yeah, they're gonna hook me up.

[16:10] Is a distro really hooking you up?

[16:12] Now if they hook you up, you're losing $3,000 to $4,000.

[16:15] So thanks so much.

[16:16] They're actually steering you in the wrong direction.

[16:18] And the problem with LE's becoming stupid now is this.

[16:22] The LE was the big bargaining chip between Stern and its distros.

[16:26] If you wanted an LE, you had to agree to buy a series of pros and premiums.

[16:31] Remember, the distros are Stern's customers, not you.

[16:34] So now what happens in a world where the LE purchase is idiotic,

[16:38] and everyone's losing money on it,

[16:40] and so what's gonna happen now, right?

[16:43] When everybody starts to realize this.

[16:45] Because here's the part, is like everybody knows,

[16:48] the way people get money to buy the next new and box game

[16:51] is to sell older new and box games,

[16:53] and how long now are all of these collectors

[16:56] gonna lose $3,000 to $4,000 and realize,

[16:59] I'm not gonna go in on the next LE.

[17:01] It's a fool's purchase.

[17:02] I think Stern and Jersey Jack absolutely destroyed,

[17:05] you know, the collectible nature of pinball.

[17:08] I think it's over.

[17:09] I think we're gonna see more and more of it collapse in 2024,

[17:13] and I think there's absolutely no profit to be made anymore.

[17:17] The only profit to be made in pinball now

[17:20] is if you bought at the original prices years ago,

[17:23] and you have a title that's in demand.

[17:26] Yes, you will still make a profit on that,

[17:29] but looking down the road in pinball,

[17:31] I'd be really nervous if I was a pinball company

[17:34] and a pinball distributor right now,

[17:36] because this hobby survived,

[17:39] because people invested in these items.

[17:42] And I'm sorry, yes, they are investments.

[17:44] There are so many people that instead of buying other things,

[17:48] they put money into pinball,

[17:50] and the reason why they invested in these machines

[17:52] is not just because they're fun,

[17:54] it's because they didn't lose money.

[17:56] And now that so many people are losing money on every single game,

[17:59] you think those people are gonna keep buying pinball?

[18:02] Absolutely not.

[18:03] All right, and the last point I wanna say is paranoia, right?

[18:07] And I know this is a dramatic one,

[18:09] but I really do encourage each and every one of you out there,

[18:12] don't be paranoid that these companies are out to get us, right?

[18:16] There's like paranoia in this hobby.

[18:19] Sometimes I feel like people think these companies are out to harm us.

[18:23] Like they don't even wanna give us a fun pinball machine,

[18:26] they're just greedy companies that are profiteering.

[18:29] All they wanna do is make money, and they don't care,

[18:32] and they're not putting passion into these games.

[18:34] I wouldn't have that level of paranoia.

[18:37] I don't believe that.

[18:38] I think these companies put a lot of effort into these games.

[18:42] I think there are some business realities that most of us are not aware of.

[18:47] That being said, we all know we're getting ripped off.

[18:51] And I think that's just the bottom line,

[18:53] is that they saw what was happening during COVID,

[18:56] and then they jacked all their prices up,

[18:59] and then we looked at the games that were coming out after COVID,

[19:03] and they were all stripped down.

[19:05] There wasn't that much in Foo Fighters compared to Godzilla.

[19:09] There wasn't nearly as much in freaking Godfather and Toy Story

[19:13] and Elton John as there was in games like Pire to the Caribbean.

[19:17] And so prices went through the roof,

[19:20] and then we didn't see as much in the games.

[19:23] And then we saw the supply go through the roof.

[19:26] But don't be paranoid that there's some conspiracy against us.

[19:30] I don't think anybody out there, whether they're a content creator,

[19:33] manufacturer, or distributor, nobody's got an agenda or an ulterior motive

[19:38] that's at play here.

[19:39] It's very simple, people.

[19:41] It's a toy that you already have many of.

[19:44] Do you need another one?

[19:46] The only time you should really be opening up your checkbook

[19:49] is if it's a dream theme,

[19:51] or there's something about the game that's just special or unique.

[19:56] And the only time you should really have to move fast on a game

[19:59] is if it really is a small run game.

[20:02] And I haven't seen that anywhere.

[20:04] Like nothing with a thousand units is a small run game anymore,

[20:08] especially with prices over $10,000 left and right.

[20:12] And I think when you add all these peas together, right, patience,

[20:16] I should be more patient.

[20:18] There's no profit to be made if I act quickly in pinball

[20:21] so that makes it easy to be patient.

[20:23] It's just pinball, right?

[20:25] There's no reason to wake up every day and argue with fools on the Internet

[20:29] about their purchase of a pinball machine.

[20:31] And I shouldn't be paranoid that these companies are out to get me.

[20:35] And I think when you add those all together,

[20:37] you end up at a place where you can just approach this hobby

[20:40] in a much more calm fashion.

[20:43] It's gonna be fine.

[20:45] If we all just wait for the special games and only buy those games,

[20:49] that's gonna make the manufacturers do a few things.

[20:53] It's gonna make them lower their prices.

[20:55] We're gonna see a lot more pinball machines on sale this year.

[20:58] Get ready for it.

[21:00] The return must have made a few thousand Venoms and they're sitting in boxes.

[21:04] You think they're gonna sell for MSRP? Absolutely not.

[21:07] You know, the same thing is gonna happen with Jaws.

[21:09] Once they make a few thousand of them, is it gonna feel special?

[21:13] Is it gonna feel rare?

[21:15] Are we gonna have mods that eat the ball?

[21:17] Who's even gonna care?

[21:18] Right, then we're gonna start thinking about Matrix

[21:21] and Back to the Future and Harry Potter and Pokemon.

[21:24] But mark my words, people.

[21:26] This train can go off the track.

[21:28] Everyone keeps losing a ton of money on these games.

[21:31] People are gonna be tapping out.

[21:33] This hobby needs to get back to a point where it is a more stable investment for its buyers.

[21:40] Everybody knows that.

[21:42] Each and every one of us has the power to create the positive change in the hobby.

[21:47] Think about it.

[21:48] We've got 700 people here who are potential pinball buyers.

[21:53] If each and every one of you just doesn't go in on a game,

[21:57] that's a good portion of machines that are not gonna be sold to a company that needs those games to sell.

[22:03] I mean, more people listen to this show than bought Galactic Tank Force.

[22:07] The same amount of people listen to this show that could buy every single Rick and Morty that was released.

[22:12] I think this audience of Canadian Pinball Podcast is smart.

[22:15] I think you guys know all of this.

[22:17] And this was just the perspective I had when I stepped away from pinball for a week.

[22:22] I'm telling you people, I'm struggling to stay enthusiastic on some of the moves by these companies.

[22:26] And I don't really care anymore.

[22:28] It's like I'm so tired of waiting for Pulp Fiction.

[22:31] I'm tired of the Jaws debate.

[22:34] Somehow all of this is just starting to erode the weekly fun of pinball because it's just too expensive, right?

[22:41] It's just too expensive.

[22:42] And I think we need to see a company, whether it's Jersey Jack or Stern.

[22:47] Somebody's got to lower prices.

[22:49] They do.

[22:50] And it has to be one of the big companies because the boutique companies have all moved their prices upwards as well.

[22:55] And I just don't think we can survive where every single pinball machine is around $10,000.

[23:01] I think it's too much money and I think people are gonna balk.

[23:04] Alright everybody, I'm back.

[23:06] I'm not feeling 100% but we will be back with more shows.

[23:10] We'll talk about what's going on in this pinball hobby.

[23:13] You know, and look, I survived Disney World.

[23:15] Killian had an amazing time but as a parent it is more about survival than feeling the magic of the Magic Kingdom later.

[23:23] It's a small world after all. It's a small world after all. It's a small world after all. It's a small, small world.
