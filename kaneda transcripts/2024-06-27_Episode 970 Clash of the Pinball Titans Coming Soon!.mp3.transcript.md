[00:00] This is mom, it's gotta go in on, she's all I want, and I've waited so long.

[00:08] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up.

[00:12] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast. Have you been waiting for so long?

[00:18] I know so many of us out there have been waiting so long for Jersey Jack to finally check all of the boxes in the Pinball world.

[00:29] They've got the most beautiful lighting system, they put the most mechanics into games when they want to, not recently, but they used to,

[00:40] and they really know how to code a game that has a lot of replay value and depth.

[00:46] Yet through the entire tenure of this company's history, Jersey Jack Pinball hasn't really fired on all cylinders.

[00:54] I think Wizard of Oz and Guns N' Roses were the two most successful machines for the company.

[01:00] Guns N' Roses had the play field issues, and you know, the multi-balls are annoying.

[01:06] I don't care what anybody says, they're annoying. I have the game right now on the new code,

[01:11] and without even trying to start a multi-ball, for some reason you hit one switch and all these balls are coming at you,

[01:18] and then you're in a multi-ball and then you're stacking a multi-ball, and I don't like it, I gotta turn it down.

[01:23] Alright, so, but this company, right, they have the most beautiful machines.

[01:27] Now Elton John shoots amazingly well, but it's Elton John, it's not what most of you want, and I'm here to tell you right now.

[01:36] On this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, then I'm going to, as much as I can, confirm for you that the next game from Jersey Jack Pinball

[01:48] is going to be Harry Potter by Eric Minier.

[01:53] This game is coming, it is real. Not only that, Canada has exclusive detailed information on what will be in this game.

[02:05] I will, a week from tomorrow, next Friday's show, I am going to tell you what is going to be in this game.

[02:16] What's going to be where on the play field. Remember when I did it with Jaws, and I told you this is going to be here, there's going to be a chum bucket,

[02:25] there's going to be a boat with a shark underneath it. All the stuff I said was going to be in Jaws, was in Jaws.

[02:33] So get ready, Jason Knapp, there's about to be some real pinball news in the world.

[02:39] Get ready everybody, and you're going to get it here on Canada's Pinball Podcast, but the real big confirmation that also is groundbreaking is that Harry Potter is next.

[02:50] And Jersey Jack Pinball has seen that Stern Pinball is very vulnerable right now, and so they've bumped Harry Potter in front of Mark Sidon's game.

[03:01] And I still don't know what Mark Sidon's game really is going to be. It is not the Matrix, I heard it's not Muppets, I don't know what it's going to be.

[03:12] Maybe they have Sonic the Hedgehog, I don't know what it is, but I do know that Mark Sidon will not be the next game from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[03:21] I could be wrong on this, but I have some of my best sources, my best people out there are telling me that Harry Potter is next.

[03:31] And now it's going to get interesting. You know, it's going to be the Titans are coming in Pinball.

[03:37] I think we might have, and this is crazy to say it, we might have the ultimate battle of like 90s and 2000s geeks take place in the Pinball world.

[03:48] It might be Harry Potter versus Pokemon. Now for some of you out there like me, I'm not really sort of driven towards either of those themes.

[03:59] I would much rather have Back to the Future, but that being said, from what I'm hearing, and I've spoken to multiple people, I've spoken to people in the industry, inside the company.

[04:12] From what I'm hearing that this game is going to be like Wizard of Oz on crack, and you're going to get like this world under glass like you've never seen before.

[04:28] And I've also heard from people that are like Chris, when you see this game, you're not going to believe how much they got to fit underneath the glass.

[04:38] And we are talking about magical castles heading towards the sky. We're going to talk about all of it a week from tomorrow.

[04:48] So get ready. Canada is going to annoy you with teasers and reminders. And you're not hearing this anywhere else.

[04:56] This is why I love doing this show. And I'm just super excited for Jersey Jack.

[05:01] And I don't just mean this because I now own a Guns N' Roses. I mean it because in pinball people, with these stupid prices, we need companies to come at us with triple A themes.

[05:15] We need them to put more into these machines. We're now at a point now in pinball where people think ABBA can sell for 10 grand. It's not going to.

[05:26] People think just because you redo the artwork on Fun House, it's now a $10,000 machine. Heck, a spooky machine with Butter Cabinet is now like $12,000 plus.

[05:40] I don't care how many free, flat plastic toppers these companies want to put on top of a game.

[05:47] There is no pinball machine in modern times that looks as good and feels like it's somewhat worth the money as a Jersey Jack machine.

[05:58] And we all know they've never really nailed it. But what is it going to be like if it's Potter vs. Pokemon?

[06:05] I can't wait because I think the battlegrounds are drawn. I think we're now in this new pinball period, right?

[06:12] Where all these newbies came in during COVID and they bought all this stuff and they lost all this money.

[06:18] But I think even those suckers are waiting. They came in after Godzilla and they really have never been around.

[06:27] When a game came out that just captivated the entire pinball landscape, think about it. After Godzilla, was there a single machine that really captivated everybody?

[06:39] Foo Fighters was a great machine. First machine from Jack Danger. It's a great machine, but it didn't capture or win over the imagination of the pinball demographic.

[06:50] And it's also because most people, they like the Foo Fighters, but it's not like they're crazy in love with the Foo Fighters.

[06:56] And Dave Grohl was an idiot this week and just said that Taylor Swift doesn't perform live. He's 100% wrong.

[07:04] And what a stupid thing to say to probably the most passionate and energetic fanbase on the entire planet.

[07:12] So that was weird to do that. So Foo Fighters didn't do it. James Bond didn't do it. We know that Venom didn't do it.

[07:21] And now what? Jaws was like, alright, but Jaws didn't really bring anything.

[07:26] I mean, they made a game about a shark that freaking eats people and then the shark doesn't even eat the ball.

[07:34] I'm sorry, I still will never get over the fact that Stern Pinball could not figure out how to make a dramatic, amazing moment with the damn shark.

[07:43] And we all sort of forgave them for this. And then they come out after that debacle with freaking John Wick with no guns, none chucks, and swords,

[07:53] and probably the worst launch. I mean this. John Wick was the worst launch in the history of Stern Pinball.

[08:01] And the sales are abysmal and the game is not selling. And all those dealers and distros are going to be discounting this game.

[08:10] And now that we know that Harry Potter is next from Jersey Jack Pinball, enjoy your $13,000 John Wick people because it's going to be worth $8,000 a year from now.

[08:21] Mark my words, John Wick Elyse will be selling for $8,000. Nobody, nobody's going to want one after the big Titans hit Pokemon.

[08:34] Back to the future, Harry Potter. Oh no, I don't want those games, guys, I don't want those games.

[08:39] I want a stained glass window of John Wick holding up a samurai sword.

[08:46] Again, Stern Pinball and dealers are going to sit on this game forever.

[08:51] So John Wick didn't do it, right? And so for these newbies, they've never seen a game like win over people.

[08:58] I mean, look at Jersey Jack. Since Guns N' Roses, they haven't had a launch that really captivated the imagination of people.

[09:06] It was not Toy Story 4, it was not The Godfather, and it is not Elton John.

[09:11] Look, I love Elton John just like everybody else who's played it, but the game's not really flying off the shelf.

[09:18] It hasn't really captivated the imagination of the community.

[09:22] You know, you got Pulp Fiction, yeah, kind of like we were all excited two years ago when that game happened, and now we're still waiting on the games.

[09:31] So the hype on that game is gone.

[09:33] If you brag about having a Pulp Fiction LE like nobody cares, cool, you got nothing. You got nothing.

[09:38] Hey, I got a spot with a topper. Cool, where's your game? Well, I don't know. When's the game coming out?

[09:43] I don't know. When are they making it? I don't know. Do you think someone's just going to pirate the topper, and then your game's not going to have much value?

[09:49] Probably. That's the modern world. Hey, AI can make anything. I bet AI can make a 3D printed topper of Pulp Fiction.

[09:56] So that didn't do it, and then we look at the other companies like ABBA didn't do it, Funhouse didn't do it, Ripley Alienversion didn't do it, right?

[10:05] We've got all of these new people, all of this new money who's been buying up everything, and they haven't really experienced what it's like to get a AAA theme done right with the right platform where it's going to be a feeding frenzy to get one.

[10:23] Let me tell you this right now. If Harry Potter is done right, everybody who's saying FOMO is dead is about to witness the resurrection of FOMO.

[10:34] Because if they're going to make a thousand collector's editions of Harry Potter with a topper, with all the stuff that I know is in this game, for 15K, all of a sudden, all of a sudden it's quite clear there's going to be way more than a thousand people globally who are going to want one.

[10:55] And the narrative around it is like JK Rowling finally gives in and allows there to be a pinball version of her iconic property. And if this game has what it needs, right? It does need to have stuff. Don't get me wrong.

[11:10] Jersey Jack Pinball can make the most beautiful games that suck, that they're not fun to play. I hate to be so strident, but they've made some beautiful games that just don't work.

[11:22] Like you don't want to marry them. Beautiful women that are terrible in bed. That's been the JJP experience for some of you out there. And I think now, maybe now, right? Maybe now, they're going to get it all right.

[11:37] They're going to have to have the following. You need the assets from the movie. I don't want to see muted clips like Toy Story and Willy Wonka. I need to see the scenes from the movie. They need to have the movie.

[11:54] It can't be like Wizarding World. It's got to be from the movie. I heard they have the movie assets. Then you got to make sure the game has magic in it. And when you say magic, what I mean by that is just magical moments.

[12:09] Like when you play the game, that everything works together. The music, the callouts, the layout, the gameplay, the toys, the mechs. I mean, it's freaking Harry Potter. If this game doesn't have magical moments where the ball is doing stuff that looks like magic is taking over the game, then what are we even doing here?

[12:31] And that is going to be the lens at which I look at Harry Potter. This game better do stuff that makes it feel like some magic intervened with the gameplay experience. If it does not have that and all the magic is on the screen and showing the magic happening from the films, then that is a missed opportunity.

[12:55] I want to see magnets. I want to see balls disappear. I want to see something go from here to there without knowing how it got there. I need to see Quidditch. I need to see spells. I need to see magic wands. I need to see this stuff.

[13:10] And it's perfect. Like there's no greater source material to create magic under the glass of pinball than freaking Harry Potter. And Pokemon is also another great theme for pinball. You know, gotta catch them all. I mean, the game just like makes itself.

[13:26] And so are we gonna have a clash of the titans in the pinball world this year of Harry Potter vs Pokemon? And now that we know that at least Harry Potter is coming, it's really gonna put the pressure on Stern Pinball. I mean, Stern Pinball has got 500 people working there today making a game nobody wants.

[13:50] They are there building John Wick, a game with no demand. And so they're gonna basically have to pivot to probably Metallica remake next month.

[13:59] But then when Harry Potter drops, like it's gonna be this like atom bomb that drops into the pinball space and all these newbies who bought all these Venoms and John Wick's. You know who they are.

[14:13] These content creators who bought Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, they're all gonna look down their line up and be like, I'm an idiot. I should have waited. I should have listened to Canada because the big games to get in this year over the next six months to a year.

[14:31] Back to the future, Harry Potter number one and number two. All day long. If Stern has Pokemon, put that on the list as well. And everything else, I'm just telling you this. Everything else is gonna be a tough sell.

[14:46] And that's what's exciting because Spooky Pinball knows that. They've gotta come out with something big to compete with those themes. Barrels of Fun can't keep making David Van Esses pre-puberty like Love Affair with Muppets.

[14:59] No, you gotta make something that's gonna compete with those kinds of themes. And the same is true for everybody. I mean Dutch Pinball is locked and loaded with Back to the Future. They're gonna make that game for a decade.

[15:12] Stern Pinball, we know they can get great themes. They just haven't been dropping them since Godzilla. And I would argue Godzilla is not even the greatest theme ever. But Keith Elwin takes everything to a great level.

[15:24] But man, other than Elwin, when's the next big hit gonna come from John Borg? When is Brian Eddy gonna actually make a hit game at Stern Pinball? The competition is gonna be so fierce.

[15:36] But what's awesome about Potter, what's awesome about the possibility of Pokemon, what's awesome about Back to the Future is these are the kinds of games where just on theme alone, you're gonna sell 5,000.

[15:50] Unless Homepins make any games, you don't even have to see the game. I'm telling you right now, Harry Potter Collector's Edition, once we get closer and we're very close people, once people start realizing it's real,

[16:05] Do you need to make sure you reserve your Alice in Wonderland? Or do you need to make sure you reserve your Harry Potter Collector's Edition? Your Pokemon Limited Edition. It's about to get crazy people. I love it. And nobody's gonna give you this information like Canada.

[16:21] Everybody, thank you so much for being a member of the show. I'm having such a good time podcasting right now from Killian's bedroom. I'm bringing the excitement. I'm bringing the hype train, baby. I'm all for this Harry Potter hype train.

[16:34] If you could have heard the enthusiasm I heard from the people that have seen this game and yes, they have seen this game. It is real. This isn't me just making stuff up. This game is coming. It is imminent. It is around the corner and it is next.

[16:51] So if I were you, if I were you, I wouldn't be stupid and order a John Wick or a fun house or get in on these like, you know, just be smart. Just call up and get on the list today. Just in case you want a Harry Potter.

[17:09] They won't take your money. You're just on the list. A thousand people around the world is all they need for one of the biggest properties of all time. So like you can listen to me or not. And if you think Canada is not gonna get the hype train going, you're wrong.

[17:29] I love the hype train. I love hyping these games up up until the point they disappoint us. But until then, let's have some fun and get ready. Harry Potter coming from Jersey Jack sometime in 2024 from Eric Minier.

[17:45] They bumped him in front of Mark Sidon's game because they know the giant is vulnerable. Stern doesn't have anything to counter punch with unless they've got Pokemon. I can't wait to see what happens. Canada out. Jason nap. Get ready brother. Get ready.

[18:03] I'm gonna be dropping where the mechs are in Harry Potter next week. Mark your calendars. I don't even know what date that is, but welcome all you newbies to Canada's pinball podcast. Peace out.
