[00:00] When I find all over the reason, maybe I'll find another way, find another day.

[00:08] Welcome to episode 213, Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:20] I'm your host, Canadian, coming at you from New York City on a very rainy, snowy, slushy

[00:25] night.

[00:26] I didn't think I was going to do a podcast this evening, but I kept getting inundated with

[00:33] emails and Facebook messages that were updating me on things going on in the world of pinball

[00:38] that we just have to cover as they happen.

[00:41] On this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast, we're going to talk about some very, very recent

[00:47] developments about Texas Pinball Festival and some big companies pulling out of the show

[00:55] and not revealing some of their big pins that we all expected to see in a couple weeks.

[01:00] We're going to talk about that.

[01:02] I'm going to talk about some of your listener feedback that I've been getting, which I

[01:07] really appreciate.

[01:08] You guys have to hit me up at canadaepimballadgmail.com and we can have almost like indirect correspondence

[01:17] or conversation on this podcast.

[01:19] I also want to address, because I got a bunch of people who emailed me after the last

[01:25] episode and they were like kind of concerned.

[01:27] They were worried that there was real beef and anger between Canadian Pinball Podcast and

[01:34] head to head pinball podcast over there in Australia.

[01:38] I just want to set the record straight.

[01:40] I want to set the record straight that there is no bad blood between this podcast and

[01:46] head to head pinball.

[01:47] In fact, I talked to Ryan C. Probably on a daily basis on Facebook Messenger.

[01:55] We talk all the time.

[01:57] Ryan's a good friend.

[01:58] I'm going to see him when he comes to New York in like a week.

[02:02] We're hanging at Texas Pinball Festival.

[02:04] So don't for a minute think when we jab at each other that we are doing it with malicious

[02:11] intent.

[02:12] They take some fun shots at this podcast on their pinball podcast.

[02:17] They make fun of some of the repetitive stuff I say on this show.

[02:24] The only thing I knew I could do to stay competitive with that podcast and that was to go out and

[02:30] use my own money.

[02:32] I spent a lot of money guys.

[02:34] A lot of money to license the official lap track from head to head pinball.

[02:39] Some people have been saying to me like are you going to still use it like enough is enough?

[02:44] You know what?

[02:45] I've decided to actually stop using the head to head pinball lap track.

[02:49] I don't think it's that funny.

[02:51] And I think you guys will appreciate this show not trying to be two hours long.

[02:55] So that's my official stance on the whole thing.

[03:01] So the big news today is we have absolute with 100% certainty.

[03:18] We have confirmation that two of the big titles we were expecting to see at Texas pinball

[03:23] festival next weekend will not be shown.

[03:29] And the two titles that will not be shown are Chicago gaming companies new title title

[03:35] number three.

[03:37] Now I heard from a bunch of people it was going to be monster bash remake.

[03:41] Then I heard there were some licensing issues and it might have been circus full tear that

[03:46] might be bumped in front of monster bash remake.

[03:50] But whatever it was going to be is now confirmed by Chicago gaming company themselves that

[03:57] they will not be at T.P.F. with the game.

[03:59] And I want to read what they wrote.

[04:01] They said like a fine wine a pinball is not done till it's done.

[04:08] We have elected to delay the introduction of pinball number three.

[04:13] Additionally we were scheduled to introduce our next pin at the Texas pinball festival

[04:18] in Dallas Texas on March 16th to the 18th.

[04:23] Additional features are being added while deploying some newer technologies.

[04:29] While we know this will disappoint a few people we are confident that once they see the

[04:35] final product they will be blown away.

[04:38] Chicago gaming will still be present in Texas pinball festival regardless.

[04:43] More information on pin three in the weeks to come.

[04:46] That sucks.

[04:49] That really sucks.

[04:51] I think a lot of people out there were really looking forward to seeing the next game from

[04:56] Chicago gaming.

[04:57] Now I'll say who's really happy about this about monster bash remake being delayed.

[05:04] But there's one company that must be doing back flips with this news.

[05:09] It's spooky pinball.

[05:11] And Alice Cooper is Nightmare Castle.

[05:13] We've said it all along.

[05:14] I mean there were two spooky thing games being revealed that Texas pinball festival and one

[05:20] of them just bailed out.

[05:22] So this is really really good news for Charlie and company that they are not going to have

[05:28] to compete with monster bash remake.

[05:33] Now I have also I also have confirmation as of today that Stern pinball will not be bringing

[05:43] iron maiden to Texas pinball festival.

[05:46] There will be no new Stern pinball machines brought to tpf.

[05:52] And I want to talk about this for a minute because I think this warrants me going off a

[05:57] little bit on a rant.

[05:59] At Stern pinball the biggest pinball company in the world is once again snubbing people

[06:08] who are going to the main pinball shows and look there are two pinball shows.

[06:13] Let's be honest there are two pinball shows where reveals a curve for the most part.

[06:18] Right?

[06:19] Chicago expo and pinball expo in Chicago and Texas pinball festival in in March.

[06:27] And they make total sense because they are like six months or so apart and they are the

[06:32] perfect time for a company to reveal its games because most of the news and most reveals

[06:40] happen at those two shows.

[06:42] And now we have two for two.

[06:45] Stern failed to show up to pinball expo in Chicago with Guardians of the Galaxy and now they

[06:51] are failing to go to Texas pinball festival where thousands of people will go who are pinball

[06:57] fans to see the latest and the greatest and they are not going to be present.

[07:01] And I just have to say that's bullshit.

[07:04] It is total bullshit.

[07:06] There is no reason why Stern can at least show up and even if the game is not playable,

[07:13] even if it's not 100%.

[07:15] There is no reason why they can't show us the game all out what they did with Batman

[07:19] 66 and at least have the game there or have a seminar in which Keith L.W. George Gomez,

[07:26] Zombietti are there to reveal to us the game.

[07:29] It doesn't have to be playable.

[07:30] We don't have to have it on the floor.

[07:32] But I think it's absolute bullshit that Stern is not going to reveal the game at this

[07:38] show.

[07:39] And I think Stern is going to do something that they always do is they are going to find

[07:41] some stupid like comic book convention or some other way or some like Vegas show or some

[07:48] other moment in time to just plop this thing out into the world with some bullshit,

[07:53] IGN exclusive.

[07:54] Let me tell them something.

[07:57] They might think that an IGN story about pinball is like getting pinball out there, bullshit.

[08:03] This is such a niche hobby.

[08:05] Nobody that reads IGN is a pinball new inbox buyer.

[08:10] Those stories get no traction.

[08:12] They get no comments.

[08:14] It is absolute I think enane-ness.

[08:19] And I think it's absolutely unforgivable that Stern continues to turn its back on the

[08:25] main shows in this hobby.

[08:27] I see absolutely no reason why we can't see what is happening with Iron Maiden at this

[08:33] show.

[08:34] Okay?

[08:35] I'm so upset that I'm almost tempted to just leak the Deadpool images that are out there

[08:43] in the world.

[08:44] But I'm not.

[08:45] I'm not going to do it.

[08:46] I'm not going to do it.

[08:47] I will never do that.

[08:48] And I see that people are speculating whether or not there are Deadpool images circulating

[08:53] around in the world.

[08:54] There are maybe a few, but no one I know is going to reveal anything.

[08:59] But it's happening.

[09:00] Deadpool is happening.

[09:02] I've seen it.

[09:04] Multiple people have seen it.

[09:05] All right?

[09:06] But you're not getting shit.

[09:07] I love going on to the thread and people are like, I don't think the images exist.

[09:11] Yeah they do.

[09:12] But let me go back to Texas for a second because I was talking to some people and they were

[09:18] like, you know, now I don't know if I want to go to the show.

[09:22] Now I'm not really sure if I'm as excited to go to TPS as I was before.

[09:27] And look, I get that new games are revealed at shows.

[09:31] But for the most part, the reason why these shows are great is not because pinball machines

[09:37] are revealed.

[09:38] Because for a two to three day period, grown men can actually hang out with other grown

[09:45] men that actually give a shit about pinball.

[09:49] And for a, what, like a 72 hour period, you can actually get drinks, turn to the guy next

[09:57] to you at a bar and have a conversation about pinball where that guy doesn't want to break

[10:05] the beer bottle over your fucking head.

[10:08] All right, you can't go into most bars in the world and turn to the guy next to you and

[10:14] start talking about pinball.

[10:16] And that is what makes shows great.

[10:18] It is not about reveals for the most part.

[10:23] Yes, it would be nice to have seen both the games from Chicago gaming and Stern.

[10:30] But I also, you know what, it's not a deal breaker.

[10:32] I'm not not going to go now.

[10:35] So I'm still excited to play more of Houdini.

[10:38] I'm excited to play Pirates of the Caribbean for the first time because I've never played

[10:42] that machine.

[10:43] I'm excited to see Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle and play that game at the spooky booth.

[10:49] You know, there's plenty of new stuff that's going to be there.

[10:52] So don't for a minute think that, you know, I'm devastated.

[10:57] Do I think Stern having a presence there without Iron Maiden is freaking lame?

[11:01] Of course I do.

[11:02] But you know what I think Stern is doing this?

[11:05] Because some bean counter at Stern is like, you know what, we really need, we need to

[11:10] sell more garbage of the galaxy.

[11:13] We need to sell more math wars.

[11:16] You know, by that I mean gardens of the galaxy and Star Wars.

[11:19] We need to sell more of these games that we paid all this money for on the license and

[11:23] we really shouldn't show Iron Maiden yet because you know what, like let's bring the stuff

[11:28] that hasn't moved in the numbers that we expect it.

[11:31] That's what's going on at Stern.

[11:33] There is no way they couldn't reveal to us the layout, the artwork, the cabinets of

[11:40] Iron Maiden.

[11:41] And you know why I know that because there is like, they're ready.

[11:46] They are ready.

[11:47] This game is going to be revealed what in like a couple weeks after Tpf, I think it's just

[11:52] a total slap in the face and I say shame on them.

[11:56] I say shame on Stern.

[11:58] I think you guys out there should, you know, if you love Pimball, if you love Pimball,

[12:03] you should go buy something else from another manufacturer that actually cares about these

[12:10] shows and actually shows up with their new product.

[12:13] I mean, if you like go into these major car shows and none of the manufacturers want to

[12:17] bring anything new, it's like a total fuck you.

[12:20] And then all they want to do is like put up their new releases on websites that don't

[12:24] even sell to car enthusiasts.

[12:26] I mean, the Pimball enthusiast world is so small and I constantly think Stern is acting

[12:32] like they're bigger than us.

[12:34] Like they don't talk to us on the forums.

[12:36] They don't really communicate with us at all.

[12:39] And I think this period of them acting wholelier than whole is getting kind of old.

[12:45] It's getting kind of old and I think shame on them.

[12:47] Shame on them.

[12:48] I'm really disappointed in this decision by them.

[12:51] All right.

[12:52] All right.

[12:54] What else is going on in the world of Pimball?

[12:56] So there was an interesting post by Robert Mule or over at Deeproot regarding what's going

[13:06] on with Deeproot.

[13:07] And I think that for those of us who have sort of been following, we know the story.

[13:13] We know they're going to make or trying to remake John Papaduks is the Edward Titles.

[13:19] Now, I think the thing with John Papaduks over the years is it's constantly been this sort

[13:25] of desire to make John's games work.

[13:29] And it's been a never ending sort of fiasco trying to get the J-Pop games off the ground.

[13:36] And we saw that Zidware failed on their own.

[13:39] We saw that Pentasia failed.

[13:42] We saw that American Pimball failed.

[13:45] And so here we are at another round of getting this thing off the ground.

[13:51] And I want to read what Robert Mule wrote in the Deeproot thread about what it's like

[13:57] currently sort of working to get John Papaduks games off the ground because there's a lot

[14:04] of skepticism and rightfully so.

[14:06] And so no other than our favorite friend, Orrick Lawson was talking about J-Pop games

[14:14] and he was skeptical.

[14:16] He wrote, this is what Orrick wrote, I just don't really think the lessons should be

[14:21] don't worry, someone will bail you out.

[14:24] And then J-Pop gets to have a job again.

[14:27] He should never get to work in the industry again instead of being enabled.

[14:32] That's my perspective.

[14:34] So he wrote that and then Robert Mule wrote Chimden.

[14:37] And it's been a while since Robert has talked to us.

[14:39] So he wrote, I think it's natural to have this perspective without the facts.

[14:44] However, you have no idea what is going on behind the curtains.

[14:48] J-Pop is not getting a free ride.

[14:51] He is not getting bailed out.

[14:53] He is not being enabled.

[14:56] And he is not getting an amazing compensation package that our other designers enjoy.

[15:02] The price he has paid and will continue to pay will be stiff.

[15:07] He knows it and still is committed to seeing things through.

[15:11] He does not need support or forgiveness.

[15:14] He needs to finish what he promised, period.

[15:17] And I am making sure he, at the end of the day, does just that.

[15:22] In fact, this last visit we had some tough love talks about several design issues.

[15:29] It wasn't pleasant at all.

[15:31] So I want to stop there for a minute because I want to stop there because I want to

[15:36] discuss what a tough love design talk with John Papaduke is like in 2018.

[15:44] In March of 2018, when Robert Mueller sits down with John Papaduke and there's a magic

[15:50] girl layout between the two of them.

[15:54] And hardly anything in magic girl works.

[15:56] There are missing ramps that are supposed to go to magnum flip sections of a middle mechanism.

[16:04] The Atomatron, the whole thing doesn't work.

[16:07] There are targets that can't possibly be hit.

[16:10] There are spinning black disc outlaying things that are supposed to stop the ball.

[16:16] The jinks thing doesn't work.

[16:19] There is something that doesn't work with the levitation.

[16:22] Everything in magic girl, nothing works.

[16:24] And so how do you talk to John Papaduke about designing a magic girl that works?

[16:32] How do you do it?

[16:33] What conversation do you have?

[16:36] It literally is a game where the only thing that really is enjoyable is shooting the ball

[16:40] straight up the middle and hearing the fun sounds that play when the spinner flips over

[16:45] around and around and around.

[16:47] And that's it.

[16:49] All right?

[16:50] So Robert Mueller went on to say, so where is it right for anyone, especially someone

[16:57] who has no stake in the Zidware mess, to dictate whether someone has a right to right

[17:03] wrongs?

[17:04] Finish what was promised.

[17:06] Pay hard punishments were being employed or involved in any passionate diverse industry,

[17:14] all with no stake in an outcome and little to no knowledge of what the facts really are.

[17:19] Oh shit, man.

[17:21] Robert Mueller just stuck a nuclear warhead inside Orics butt and lit the fuse on that thing.

[17:31] I actually kind of appreciate Robert saying that because I think it's time that people

[17:43] tell people, you know what, if you have no skin in the game, just shut up.

[17:48] Just go away.

[17:49] Like why is Oric even chiming in on the deep root thread?

[17:54] But I'm going to play devil's advocate for a minute on this whole thing because, you

[17:59] know, look, we're in the pinball.

[18:00] We all want to give opinions about games, whether or not we're in on it, right?

[18:04] So it's like, it's like saying, I can't give an opinion about highway pinball or their

[18:08] practices unless I'm in on a game.

[18:11] But we all know that that's not how this hobby works.

[18:14] That everyone is connected to what's going on because there's not that many games going

[18:20] on.

[18:21] There's not that many companies.

[18:23] And if you want to spend your day talking about pinball and conversing on a forum, you

[18:28] are going to end up migrating into threads that you may or may not have a skin in the game.

[18:35] Okay?

[18:36] So I just, I want to play devil's advocate there.

[18:39] The other part that I want to talk about this whole thing is, is this notion and we hear

[18:43] it all the time that zidware customers need to be made whole, that there is like this manifest

[18:51] destiny, this almost like desire or necessary movement, if you will, like a social responsibility

[19:03] for all the pinball stars to align and make sure that people who went on zidware games

[19:09] are made whole.

[19:10] And I just want to ask the question, why?

[19:14] Why is it so important that these people are made whole?

[19:18] If you remember back, way back to when people invested in zidware, oric lossin was one of

[19:25] the only people, one of the only people that was telling people to be cautious, what are

[19:32] you guys doing?

[19:34] Why are you backing a guy?

[19:36] One guy who doesn't have any clue how to make pinball machines and he was almost universally

[19:43] told to shut up by all the people who had stars in their eyes.

[19:48] They saw John's beautiful artwork, they believed in his magical promises, they got super

[19:54] excited when he sent them a receipt that had like a bunny rabbit on it.

[19:59] And he was one of the only people that was telling people to be cautious.

[20:03] And I agree with Orc, he didn't call out, he didn't brag that he was right, but he was

[20:08] right.

[20:10] And now here we are in 2018 and we still have this mentality that these people need to

[20:16] be made whole.

[20:18] And I 100% agree with Orc that like you know what?

[20:22] No they don't, no they don't.

[20:25] These people took a risk, they took a gamble, they went in on something before they even saw

[20:31] something.

[20:33] And I don't know why there's such an overwhelming obligation on the part of other individuals

[20:40] to pick up John's mess and make his customers whole.

[20:44] And I've said it before, like the only reason I can think of is that Robert Mueller and

[20:50] anyone else who's ever tried to sort of give John another chance, they believe that John

[20:56] Papaduke is worth it and they think that his talents and his skills are valuable enough

[21:04] to make his, you know, his other customers whole.

[21:07] Because until you do that, he has no future.

[21:10] But I do find it interesting that Robert is being transparent in the troubles he's probably

[21:17] facing with John Papaduke when it comes to design issues.

[21:21] Now here's the thing, is Robert is promised to get these games made like a little over a

[21:27] year from now.

[21:28] And if he's still having design issues with J-pop and having tough love conversations with

[21:34] John, I mean I'm skeptical.

[21:37] I remain skeptical because I still think that John Papaduke, as whatever skills he has,

[21:45] his bad qualities and his inability to focus and his meandering and his design, you know,

[21:54] his wishy washi designs like where he like has things that can't even physically work

[22:00] is going to be very problematic to unravel the mess that is J-pop.

[22:04] And I think everyone feels the same way is why would you hire these new designers who

[22:10] have no baggage, who can build a game that works from day one, why would you waste your time

[22:17] trying to unravel the mystery of magic girl, of rasa, of Alice in Wonderland, and why

[22:25] would you have to have all these tough love conversations with a man who clearly is a

[22:31] few cans short of a six pack.

[22:34] All right, well that's Robert's thing to figure out.

[22:38] And we look forward to seeing what comes of it all, but it sounds like there's still some

[22:43] tension in the J-pop deep route world in terms of figuring out all of this stuff, okay?

[22:52] All right, let's move on to what else is going on in the Pimbal hobby.

[22:57] So I want to read some of your feedback, all right?

[23:02] I want to read some of your feedback on my last podcast because I got some good stuff.

[23:07] I got some really good stuff from you guys.

[23:08] And again, I appreciate all of you who write in.

[23:12] All right, I got an email of an email Dave Sanders because in my last podcast, when I

[23:21] did the Highway Pimbal, the Broadway show, I misspoke when I said that's so good.

[23:27] This Lamptilt was Dave Sanders.

[23:30] It was actually Russell from Highway Pimbal.

[23:33] Okay, so I apologize to Dave.

[23:36] It's not Dave Sanders exiting stage left.

[23:39] It's actually Russell from Highway Pimbal.

[23:42] So can you forgive me for that mistake?

[23:45] Oh, so funny.

[23:52] So Dave, sorry about that man.

[23:53] I really do apologize.

[23:55] But everything else in that show was pretty damn accurate.

[23:59] All right, let's go on to the next email I got, which was from Mark Felt.

[24:06] So Mark Felt wrote me something really interesting.

[24:09] I want to read almost all of his email and I want to respond to stuff as he says it.

[24:16] So he says the answer to many of your questions about these zombie Pimbal companies is always

[24:22] follow the money.

[24:25] Higher Dutch and highway still in business because there is money in a bank account

[24:30] somewhere for people to draw salaries from.

[24:35] That's all.

[24:36] Do you know how many millions of dollars of salary to overhead was pissed away at Kodak,

[24:41] RIM, makers of Blackberry and Nokia as they circled the drain?

[24:48] You know that they pay the top executives extra bonuses to stay on the sinking ship.

[24:54] That is what is going on with Toys or Us right now.

[24:57] But do you think Hasbro and Mattel will ever get paid?

[25:02] Of course not.

[25:03] So why don't they go away because there is still money left?

[25:08] Will people ever get their aliens or big Lebowski's?

[25:12] I doubt it.

[25:13] All right, I want to stop there for a minute and address that.

[25:16] So there is definitely money in a bank account with highway and Dutch Pimbal.

[25:24] Now all that money that's in that bank account, that money was given to them to pay for the

[25:32] parts and the labor necessary to make the Pimbal machine that those individuals ordered.

[25:39] That money was not meant to be allocated to Barry or Yop's salaries.

[25:45] And I've always wondered this.

[25:47] When you've got guys who don't have other day jobs, who is paying them?

[25:53] How are they making money?

[25:55] You know, it's very simple question.

[25:57] Like who is paying for the airplane tickets to send Barry and Yop to China?

[26:04] Who is paying for Barry and Yop to fly out to Pimbal Expo last year?

[26:10] Or who is paying for them to fly out to Texas Pimbal Festival and they did last year?

[26:14] All the different expenses, hotel rooms, airline tickets.

[26:20] Now who is paying all the money to order the parts?

[26:24] Who is paying all the money to train the new employees at the contract manufacturing

[26:29] place to make the game?

[26:32] All that money is coming probably from that bank account.

[26:36] And then what happens, right?

[26:37] That bank account starts to run out.

[26:41] And then there's absolutely no money to build the game that those people paid for.

[26:48] And we see it with highway Pimbal.

[26:49] I mean, I think highway is the most concerning for me too because people want refunds and

[26:55] they refuse to give them refunds.

[26:57] So what does that say about the health of the company when they still refuse to give

[27:02] people their money back when they asked for it?

[27:05] And I said it from day one, these companies need to make these products with their own money

[27:14] and their own investment dollars and they should not be taking customer dollars until

[27:20] they've figured out production.

[27:23] So then I want to read where his email goes next.

[27:26] So Mark wrote next, now like it or not, you wield more power than you may think.

[27:33] You basically just fucked American Pimbal because your audience of 1000 plus plus the

[27:41] other 1000 that they talked to are American Pimbal's only real customer base.

[27:48] No operator in their right mind would buy a Houdini with no clue if they will be able

[27:54] to get parts long term.

[27:57] And there is no reference point for resale value unlike Stern.

[28:02] Speaking of Stern, when they announce the vault edition of Batman SLE and do another run

[28:07] against their previous announced decisions to only make whatever number, you will have

[28:12] no one to blame but yourself.

[28:16] You have a force of one resurrected a game that everyone had forgotten about and written

[28:22] off.

[28:23] You can't preach, play it for yourself all day long.

[28:27] Many of your listeners follow the drum of canada and the run on Batman is your fault.

[28:34] Not promising a Batman SLE vault edition but look at ACDC Lucy again, follow the money.

[28:41] Stern needs at least 50 a day.

[28:43] Let me stop there for a minute Mark because I think you're saying some very bold things

[28:49] right now.

[28:50] So you're saying let's rewind this.

[28:53] You're saying that you think Stern is going to make another run of Batman super limited

[29:00] edition games.

[29:02] You're saying that because there's money to be made if they do that.

[29:07] And I would go out on a limb and not even a limb.

[29:11] I would be utterly shocked if Stern was going to fuck over the 80 people that plunked down

[29:18] $15,000 and remade a super limited edition of Batman.

[29:24] Now will they make a vault edition of Batman?

[29:29] That's a different story.

[29:30] If I were Stern and I'm going to give them some marketing advice right now, they should

[29:35] do what ACDC what they did with Lucy.

[29:40] Because Batman had such a shitty launch and people didn't really go in on the game at

[29:45] launch because the code was like in beta form, now that Batman is great.

[29:50] If I were Stern to drum up new excitement for Batman, I would make a Batgirl version of

[29:58] the game.

[29:59] I wouldn't make it limited edition.

[30:01] I wouldn't call it anything special.

[30:03] I would just have a Batgirl version of the game and sell it to people.

[30:09] Because I still don't think that that diminishes the value of the 80 SLEs that are out there.

[30:16] Now look Stern will never remake Batman SLEs.

[30:21] There's just certain things that you just can't do as a company because the people who bought

[30:27] Batman SLEs, they were guaranteed that there would only be 80 of them ever made.

[30:35] If Stern remade more, those individuals would have legal cause to go get money back from

[30:44] the manufacturer.

[30:45] I'll give you a argument.

[30:47] People who bought Dodge Demons, Dodge confirmed publicly that we are making no more than

[30:54] 3,300 Demons ever.

[30:58] That's it.

[30:59] No more.

[31:00] That doesn't stop Dodge from making a better version or a better car a year later, but they

[31:07] can't call it a demon.

[31:09] That's just the thing.

[31:10] They can't call anything a Batman super LA.

[31:14] Interesting point is, could Stern make?

[31:18] Even if Stern said we're going to make 500 Batgirl Limited Edition Batman 66 machines.

[31:27] They could easily do that.

[31:29] Stern could and they have the right to.

[31:31] They could say we're only going to make 50 Batgirl editions and they're $20,000 each.

[31:38] They don't have to call them a super LA.

[31:40] They could do that.

[31:41] You just can't remake the exact game that people bought.

[31:46] I know.

[31:48] We are always vulnerable to the pinball machine we buy.

[31:53] We are always vulnerable to having the carpet pulled out from underneath us when it comes

[31:59] to the value of these limited machines.

[32:02] If you own a Big Bang bar, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

[32:07] If you own a cactus canyon that you spend $10,000 restoring, you're fucked.

[32:14] If you own a circus full tear or theater of magic and you spend all this money restoring

[32:20] it, I'm sorry, but they're about to remake that game with new technology and make it

[32:28] even better.

[32:29] That's just the issue with pinball.

[32:32] Is there's always the remake possibility that could screw people.

[32:36] Mark goes on to write.

[32:38] He said speaking of Stern, when they announced the Vault Edition of Batman SLE.

[32:45] And do another run against the previous announced decision.

[32:47] Alright, I already read that part.

[32:49] Sorry guys, he says speaking of SLE, you will never get custom code because they are nothing

[32:54] more than a cash grab on the part of Stern.

[32:57] You can see it for yourself.

[32:59] Anyone would take the extra couple grand of pure profit per game and slap a 34 of 80 sticker

[33:05] on it.

[33:06] They are not going to debug and track a special version of software because they don't

[33:11] have to.

[33:13] On another note, enough with calling people stupid that buy a game without playing it.

[33:20] Wealthy people tell a guy, I want a game room.

[33:24] Their guy then spends 100k to 200k to put in the dartboard pool table video games, pinball

[33:29] machines, foosball, air hockey, jukebox.

[33:33] You think the wealthy guy who cares how the pinball game plays, it's a commodity other than

[33:40] the theme.

[33:41] My kids like Star Wars so I'll get one.

[33:44] There are guys with fully stocked game rooms just for their kids.

[33:48] They themselves don't even play.

[33:51] But you know what is bad if something is broken.

[33:54] So there are guy buys Stern games and stocks node boards instead of jerking around with anything

[33:59] else.

[34:01] And what about the average pinball player that wants new in box the first week just so they

[34:06] can have bragging rights?

[34:09] It is their right to behave like that.

[34:11] If they are able to feed their family and keep their roof over their heads then let them

[34:16] have it.

[34:17] I know guys that eat McDonald's drive an old car, never take vacations just to be able to

[34:22] afford new in box because that is what they care about.

[34:28] Not my thing but buy live and let live but live and let live.

[34:32] They don't need you telling them they are stupid or let me stop there for a minute because

[34:37] again Mark first of all, Mark, thank you.

[34:40] I wish everybody who emailed me put his much thought into what Mark is writing and saying

[34:47] because Mark is bringing up some very valid counter points to things we talk about a lot

[34:55] on this show.

[34:57] Let me start first by saying that I don't think most people who buy pinball machines are

[35:01] these really wealthy guys who just deflect to someone else to put in a game room in their

[35:07] home.

[35:08] I think most people who buy pinball machines they know a lot about pinball.

[35:14] I think they know which games they want.

[35:17] I think they are following the hobby somewhat.

[35:20] This is not just like the percentage of people that casually put in 100 to 200 thousand

[35:26] are game rooms is .001% of every pinball manufacturer's customer base.

[35:33] I think yes, you might have that wealthy sort of ignorant dude who just does it and doesn't

[35:39] give a shit and I'll tell you what, there are those people but we also don't give a shit

[35:44] about those people because those people don't really give a shit.

[35:47] Those people are called posers.

[35:50] Like you're a poser when you want a game room but you don't really care about which games

[35:55] go in the room or you just like arbitrarily select them.

[36:00] It's like the guy who wants a collection of cars but doesn't really know anything about

[36:04] cars and just has someone curate his collection for them.

[36:08] Yeah, you're a poser.

[36:09] You're not really well versed in the hobby and I think those people I could care less about

[36:15] them.

[36:16] For the people that you mentioned who eat at McDonald's and sacrifice in other areas so

[36:21] they can get new in box machines and I know I sort of come down hard on those people

[36:28] and I will remain hard on those people and I'll explain why.

[36:33] If you have any financial advice coming to people who live like that, the last place

[36:42] you should put your money.

[36:44] When you have excess money is in a pinball machine.

[36:48] Pinball machine purchases should come when you have money on top of your excess money.

[36:55] It is money that's on top of your primary savings.

[36:59] Look, if someone wants to live that way, if they want to drive whatever car and they

[37:04] want to eat cheaply and all they care about is pinball and they save up and they get

[37:10] a new in box machine that they've been waiting for.

[37:13] Yes, God bless those people.

[37:17] It's not what I would do with my money but I'll say this and we've been talking a lot

[37:22] about this on the podcast recently is that life is really short.

[37:27] Life is really short and we don't know how much time we have on this planet and you

[37:32] should surround yourself with the things that you enjoy because it's pinball and you

[37:38] don't want to take the second place trophy in life and for go surrounding yourself with

[37:47] the things you love and I forget where I heard that.

[37:49] It really is just the epitome of that's pinball and you just have to shrug it off and get

[37:56] your trophy for second.

[38:00] Alright, and then I want to end up Mark's email with the final things he said so that he

[38:06] goes on to say, a psychiatrist might say you're just flogging yourself for your magical

[38:13] fuck up every time you attack someone who made a mistake four years ago by paying in

[38:17] full for whatever or buying a game site unseen.

[38:21] You have a right to be a fuck up and you learn your lesson.

[38:26] Fair to share your lesson with others but you are really becoming a broken record on

[38:31] this subject.

[38:32] Also, you can't just go out and play many of these games.

[38:36] There are not lots of dialed in games on location or TNA or Houdini.

[38:42] How a dart at a map of the US and 99% of the time you will be lucky to find a newer

[38:48] stern much less the latest stern just because you are in a fantastic place to play all the

[38:54] latest games does not mean the rest of us are.

[38:58] Keep up the good work, keep preaching good health and a balanced life, worthwhile messages.

[39:03] Well Mark, thank you.

[39:04] I appreciate the note.

[39:07] So I get that I got burned on magic girl and I learned a lesson and I think a lot of

[39:13] people did not just with magic girl.

[39:15] I think everyone who's gone in on alien or the big Lebowski or predator or any zidware titles.

[39:23] I think these I think everybody has changed their tune and the enthusiasm to get in on any

[39:32] pinball that's announced is over and that we all require more than just someone to rock

[39:40] up to a show with a prototype to get our money.

[39:43] We actually want to know the game is done and there's a pathway to production.

[39:48] So you know there's that.

[39:50] The other part in terms of not being able to have access to a machine before you buy

[39:56] it or you know look here's a deal and this is just my opinion.

[40:00] Don't buy it.

[40:02] Don't buy it.

[40:04] It is so stupid in my mind to buy a pinball machine that is out there in the world and buy

[40:11] it before you even get a chance to play it.

[40:15] Alright.

[40:16] Alright so but here's the thing.

[40:18] If you're gonna buy a game.

[40:20] If you're gonna roll the dice on a game and you can't get to it.

[40:25] Alright.

[40:26] And I would recommend this.

[40:28] I would recommend doing all the homework you can.

[40:31] I would recommend being on all the forums you can and asking as many people's opinions as

[40:38] you can to determine which is the right game for you because I do get it.

[40:43] I do get it that you know if you don't know that you want a Houdini or it's the right

[40:50] game for you how would you know.

[40:53] So I think with Houdini it's a good example of a game that because it has really tight

[40:59] shots you know people aren't going to immediately go in on it and it might be frustrating for

[41:05] some and I think you know I didn't address what Mark said earlier in that that this podcast

[41:10] has a lot of influence and he says he almost is saying that I fucked over American pinball

[41:17] because I came on this show and I said my first impressions of Houdini were a bit lukewarm

[41:24] and I encourage people to play it and make up their own minds.

[41:28] Now I want to address that because I think it gets to both of that part of his email

[41:34] and the end part about playing something before you buy it but here's the thing is I know

[41:40] I have over a thousand people who listen to this show on a weekly basis who actually are

[41:48] in the market for the most part most people are in the market for new pinball machines and

[41:53] that's why you listen to this show you're not going to listen to this show if you're like

[41:58] a big tournament player you're not listening to this show to learn how to get better at

[42:04] playing certain pinball machines because I self admittedly suck at pinball and I absolutely

[42:10] think talking about pinball tournaments is the worst thing you can do on a podcast.

[42:20] But what this podcast will never be is a podcast that just cheerleads every single new pinball

[42:27] venture.

[42:28] I mean I'm allowed to give my opinion about a game.

[42:31] I'm allowed to like a game and not like a game and if I gave opinions about games that

[42:37] were way off that people totally disagreed with then I guarantee you I would not have all

[42:44] these people listening to this podcast and I hear other podcasts when they take digs

[42:49] at me you know they say stuff about me because I might not be the most knowledgeable about

[42:54] all the little nuances in pinball but you know what it doesn't matter it doesn't matter

[42:59] because none of my lack of knowledge makes the shots in Houdini any less tight and any

[43:07] less frustrating so that's just the way it is and I gave my opinion about Houdini and

[43:13] so then what happens is other people are hopping on Houdini and they are looking for the tight

[43:20] shots and they're looking to see if those shots in the game and the layout of the game

[43:26] is something that they would enjoy.

[43:28] I saw someone say I'm one of the Houdini threads the shots are really tight and really

[43:34] hard but you know over time you'll get really good at them and I'm in the camp of you

[43:40] know what when something is super super tight I don't think you ever will get to the point

[43:45] where you're going to be hitting them very frequently.

[43:48] That's just the way I think most people play pinball.

[43:51] I think there's no reason to have shots that are ultra frustrating but again like I don't

[43:58] when I say that stuff I don't stop myself and say wait a minute I shouldn't give my

[44:05] honest opinion about this game because that might hurt this company's ability to sell

[44:10] the machine right do I do do movie reviewers go into a movie and say you know wait a minute

[44:17] they spend a hundred million dollars on this movie and I'm not really going to give my

[44:21] honest opinion about the film because it might hurt the feelings and might hurt this company's

[44:26] ability to make profit on this movie.

[44:30] You know I consider myself to be a media outlet for pinball and I give one person's opinion

[44:37] about a machine.

[44:38] Now if if if people want to crucify me or blame me for hurting a company's ability to

[44:46] survive in pinball because of one man's opinion I would argue against that and say that if

[44:52] you only listen to me and you don't formulate your own opinion on any game I talk about

[45:00] or any company I talk about then shame on you.

[45:04] It's not my responsibility to make up your mind for you.

[45:08] Of course I have some influence of course I can tell you what I think and of course what

[45:14] I say might influence the opinion you formulate but we're all grown adults here talking

[45:22] about probably the most ridiculous unnecessary topic to have a conversation about on planet

[45:28] earth which is pinball and go formulate your own opinion.

[45:32] Now look I've been saying this about Houdini for a while.

[45:35] I say enough negative things about stern machines I've said enough negative things about spooky

[45:40] machines I've said enough negative things about every manufacturer and I've also said a

[45:45] lot of positive things about every manufacturer and I also am very excited and I'm going

[45:52] to be very enthusiastic about the new machines coming out.

[45:55] If this was just a negative Nancy podcast you know this was just a place where I complained

[46:00] all the time I would have nobody listening because nobody wants to hear someone who's

[46:05] just down and out on the hobby.

[46:07] I'm actually really really excited for what's coming out in pinball and I think there are

[46:12] some amazing games that have come out in the last five years.

[46:15] I think you just have to be patient and I think you have to really play these games now.

[46:22] There's just too many of them.

[46:23] Alright?

[46:24] Alright I got an email from Michael Shaulis.

[46:28] He said dear canada just finished listening to your lap track podcast.

[46:32] May I make a suggestion?

[46:34] Never again.

[46:45] I do not need the extra minutes and I get it.

[46:48] You are digging head to head pinball but it was more irritating than humorous maybe your

[46:54] point but I am confused.

[46:56] Somewhere in my journey of discovering, listening and enjoying the Twippy award winning podcast

[47:01] I miss the beginning of your feud with head to head.

[47:04] Can you enlighten this listener?

[47:06] Well Michael I explain it to the beginning of this podcast there is no feud.

[47:10] This is just simple jabbing back and forth at each other.

[47:15] He said since listening to their canada podcast I have enjoyed their interviews with Scott

[47:19] Denise, Eric, Munair, Jonathan Justin, Charlie Emory and Bowen Kernes.

[47:26] But I have no time or patience for the rest of the podcast since any pinball podcast updates

[47:32] I can get from you in a much more concise and interesting format.

[47:36] And really their game show is just stupid.

[47:40] What is your pinball sound?

[47:43] And how many times do I need to hear about ball bags?

[47:46] It only took me trudging through a couple of episodes to focus only on the interviews.

[47:52] Looking forward to hearing about the Texas trip and hoping you come around to my previous

[47:56] assertion that Jersey Jack Pire to the Caribbean will be known as the great game of this decade

[48:03] and maybe one of all time best.

[48:07] I am sure you saw the straight down in the middle show by now that again confirms my assertion.

[48:12] Because always my best to baba Mike.

[48:14] Well Mike, thank you.

[48:15] Wow, you're saying Pire to the Caribbean will be the great game of the decade.

[48:21] Maybe I think it's too way too early to tell.

[48:25] I'm sorry that you can't stomach getting through all of the head to head pinball podcasts.

[48:31] You only listen to the interviews.

[48:33] I'm like everybody does their show.

[48:35] Everybody does their thing.

[48:37] This is my thing.

[48:38] This is my show.

[48:39] This is how I decide to do it.

[48:41] When I first started doing this show, I got a whole bunch of people telling me I should

[48:46] do it like once a week.

[48:47] I should do it this way.

[48:48] I should do it that way.

[48:50] And I just decided since I'm not being paid, since this makes me no money, that I would

[48:56] just do a pinball podcast whenever I felt like it.

[49:01] And the reason why I love not having a guest every episode and I don't like having a co-host

[49:08] and one time some guy was like, I should be your co-host and it'd be great.

[49:11] The reason why is I want to do it when I'm in the mood.

[49:14] And I think this is why this podcast is better for that reason is because you only are going

[49:21] to get me when I really feel like doing it.

[49:24] If it's scheduled, that's the part that always sucks because my friends that had to head

[49:31] like they're scheduled to do it every week at the same time.

[49:34] What if they don't feel like doing it at that time?

[49:36] Well, they have to do it.

[49:38] And then when they have a guest on, they're at the mercy of how enthusiastic that guest

[49:44] is when they're interviewing them and everything relies on that.

[49:48] And they have to just make up the entertainment value as they go, even if they don't feel

[49:54] like being in that kind of mood.

[49:57] So that's the challenge with all pinball podcasting.

[50:00] I think it's more fun to do it when you actually want to do it, when you feel obligated

[50:05] to do it because of scheduling.

[50:07] All right.

[50:08] I got an email from Max.

[50:10] Max, thank you for listening to the show.

[50:12] He said, hey, Chris, I will start off by saying that I don't agree with everything that

[50:16] you say.

[50:17] And sometimes I staunchly disagree.

[50:21] Take Houdini, for example, I played one recently that was not leveled well at all, but I was

[50:26] able to make the shots and had a blast.

[50:29] But pinball is so subjective when it comes to what some people like and what others

[50:35] don't, that I can't be too mad at you for not liking it.

[50:39] Okay, Max, I think I was fair in the game, the game I was playing, in the environment I

[50:46] was playing it in, had more to do with me not liking it than the game itself.

[50:51] Okay, the shots are going to be tight.

[50:54] I couldn't hear the game.

[50:55] The game wasn't set up right.

[50:57] I will play Houdini again, and I will give a new impression when I play a game fully

[51:01] set up.

[51:02] So Josh Kugler, I know you listen to the show, bro, your game at T-P-F, it better be played

[51:08] if it better be like dialed in properly, because that'll be my next review.

[51:13] He then wrote, but dude, highway pinball to musical is one of the best things I have ever

[51:19] heard in pinball podcasting.

[51:21] It was the perfect bit.

[51:23] And then you tossed in the head-to-head lap track.

[51:26] I think that may be your best podcast yet.

[51:30] Something like that is the reason why I listen to your cast.

[51:32] I know it's going to be witty, and at least make me think.

[51:36] I'm one of the lucky ones who got my $1,500 deposit refunded back in early 2016.

[51:44] Shills, man, what the fuck?

[51:47] Don't let all this praise go to your head, keep up the good work.

[51:50] Well, Max, I will not let it get to my head.

[51:53] I'm glad you enjoyed highway pinball the Broadway play.

[51:56] I think we should actually put it on.

[51:59] You know what I need to do one day?

[52:00] I think you guys will fully enjoy this.

[52:02] I need to do an entire podcast where I get somebody else to do it with me, and all we're

[52:09] going to do is we're going to read the, I have in my possession.

[52:15] Someone like who worked at highway with Andrew pinball, they grabbed a correspondence between

[52:21] them and Andrew highway arguing about coming in to work on alien pinball.

[52:29] And there is the most amazing back and forth between that employee in Andrew highway.

[52:34] And we need to just like read it in sort of like Broadway play fashion.

[52:39] So people can actually get a real understanding of what it was like to work when things weren't

[52:45] going well over there.

[52:46] All right.

[52:47] So I got an email from pinlink.

[52:49] He said, why snow has changed his avatar?

[52:53] No doubt because of the Hilton hoodie.

[52:56] So I don't know if you guys saw this, but our friend Hilton, who for years has always

[53:02] had his classic Homer Simpson with the beer mug avatar on pinside, has recently changed

[53:09] it to like someone holding a bunch of puppies.

[53:14] And a lot of people have said to me, you know what?

[53:16] He's really nervous because at T.P.F. the Hilton hoodie will be revealed and it will have

[53:23] his original pinside avatar on it.

[53:28] And look, it's a big change.

[53:30] You don't just change your avatar after all this time because when we read pinside, our

[53:35] visual cue of to who's saying what is more the avatar than anything else.

[53:40] So I think we did.

[53:41] I think we did get Hilton to change his avatar.

[53:45] He'll never admit it.

[53:46] All right.

[53:47] So another bit of news.

[53:49] I actually, you know, I want to cover this earlier, but I'll talk about it now.

[53:52] So I got an email from Simon Hastings and he wrote another dummy spit from Mike.

[53:59] So here's a deal.

[54:00] Home pin is about to ship Thunderbirds.

[54:05] And we haven't really covered home pin very much.

[54:08] I think we covered all about them that you need to know.

[54:13] I personally brought to light a lot of what I believe to be insensitive and ignorant

[54:21] comments that Mike has made.

[54:24] Not just about pinball and the pinball marketplace, but about, you know, certain people's lifestyle

[54:31] choices and ethnicities and whatnot.

[54:35] Okay.

[54:36] I don't want to go over it again, but I want to read what home pin wrote.

[54:41] So this is from the moderator at Ozzi Arcade Forum.

[54:47] He received this note from Mike from Home Pin.

[54:51] Says home pin has p.m. to me to say he wants his account deleted and doesn't want to be

[54:57] part of the Ozzi Arcade community.

[55:01] Yay.

[55:02] Happy stress free days for me on a serious note.

[55:05] Thanks for your help over the years, Mike.

[55:07] I'm sure a lot of AA or is appreciated.

[55:11] However, it's a shame you couldn't keep it on a professional level instead of letting

[55:16] certain people bait you into arguments in which AA suffers the consequences.

[55:22] I fully understand home pin.

[55:25] He's like me a straight shooter and some people don't know how to take him, but if you

[55:30] met the guy you'd understand.

[55:32] All right.

[55:33] So here's the thing.

[55:34] He's a straight shooter.

[55:35] He just shoots from the hit.

[55:37] Mike speaks his mind.

[55:38] I'm sorry.

[55:39] You're running a pinball company.

[55:42] This guy has gone out of his way to crap all over the American pinball market.

[55:48] Who by the way, he is now realizing was a colossal mistake.

[55:54] You don't start a pinball company and then piss all over the world's number one pinball

[56:00] market.

[56:01] He's now trying to correct that wrong.

[56:04] He now has a discussion's going on or distributors in America are looking at the possibility

[56:11] of selling thunderbirds.

[56:13] Good luck with that.

[56:16] But it's saying Mike is misunderstood.

[56:18] I want to just for a moment just call bullshit on that.

[56:22] I want to give you just again the example of when Mike bragged about using the N word in

[56:29] terms of describing black people at a pinball show in Canada and then when told, hey, that's

[56:37] not appropriate.

[56:38] He said, like, FBI, I do it again.

[56:43] That's all I need to know.

[56:45] That's all I need to know.

[56:47] Again, I understand that in Australia, talking this way is appropriate to certain people,

[56:55] but not in America.

[56:57] We live in 2018 and saying things that are insensitive and derogatory, even if they're

[57:04] funny to you, you can't do that.

[57:08] Not in a public setting and especially not when you're the head of a company.

[57:13] I've said it before and I'll say it again, I don't understand why Mike would do all of

[57:18] this work to make a pinball company and then go stick his foot in his mouth on so many social

[57:26] issues and political issues and basically make home pins ability to sell machines to people

[57:35] to make it harder on himself.

[57:37] The number one job of any business and any marketing effort is to get as many people

[57:43] as you can to buy your item and all he's done is made it that much harder.

[57:50] I don't think Thunderbirds is going to do well.

[57:53] I mean, after all of it, if the game was great and he was an asshole, it's one thing.

[57:58] It's like Kanye West.

[58:00] It's like you might hate Kanye West personally, but there's no denying his talent as a musician.

[58:07] But Mike talks all this shit and then you look at the game and you're like, this guy's

[58:13] done.

[58:14] He's done.

[58:15] All right.

[58:16] All right, let's go on.

[58:18] I got an email from Steve Daniels, latest pod.

[58:22] Very glad to hear about your dad.

[58:23] Thanks for the entertainment.

[58:25] Hope the head to head stuff is all good fun in both directions.

[58:28] Well Steve, thank you.

[58:29] I appreciate that.

[58:31] I got a lot of people who said, you know, I hope your dad feels better and I really appreciate

[58:36] all that stuff.

[58:37] And yes, the head to head stuff is all in.

[58:40] It's all in good humor.

[58:42] All right.

[58:43] One last thing.

[58:44] I got an email, best thing since Magnus Link's from Jared job.

[58:48] You said, the Laptrack is the best thing.

[58:51] So innovative.

[58:52] I was dying.

[58:53] It was so funny.

[58:54] So I love the polarization of the Laptrack.

[58:58] You know, I mean, some people love it.

[58:59] Some people hate it.

[59:00] But again, I told you guys, I spent a lot of money on it.

[59:03] A lot of money.

[59:04] I mean, Ryan, C and Marty, they can disclose the terms of the deal.

[59:09] But it cost me a small fortune and I'm not about to give it up anytime soon.

[59:14] Stop it.

[59:15] I sound like I'm going to the toilet.

[59:18] Well, that's episode two, thirteen of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[59:21] I hope you enjoyed it again.

[59:23] As you see, if you email me, there's a very good chance your email will be read on an

[59:30] episode of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[59:32] It's CanadianPinball at Gmail.com.

[59:35] We will talk to you guys real soon as we head into Texas pinball festival.

[59:41] Have a great day, everybody.
