[00:00] I am yours now and you are mine and too,

[00:04] Gathering love through all space and time, so don't cry,

[00:11] One day or seven we'll die.

[00:30] So, you are going to hear on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast some Jersey Jack

[00:37] Pinball news that nobody knows and this is news that is going to have to make its way

[00:43] onto NAPS Arcade. I know Jason NAP is trying with every ounce of his being to not give

[00:50] Canada a shout out but he's about to realize why Canada's Pinball Podcast is number one,

[00:56] why we give you the news nobody else will, why we don't care about blowing up our bridges to

[01:03] the manufacturers because nobody, nobody gives you news, rumors and speculation like Canada.

[01:10] Everyone else is talking for like two hours but they ain't saying nothing.

[01:14] All right, I first want to welcome Leon to the show. Now, Leon is a Haggis Pinball series ticket

[01:21] holder and he joined the Canada Club because he heard that Alex Moss, the recipient of Fathom

[01:30] number one, has canceled his subscription to Canada's Pinball Podcast. Do you want to know why

[01:34] Alex Moss canceled his subscription because he's fed up that I am trying to figure out what's going

[01:40] on over at Haggis? I get that he got game number one but here's the real thing. Where's game number

[01:46] two? Where's game number three? Where's game number four? Where are any of the games? I don't really

[01:51] care anymore. I'm just going to say it right now. There is no way Haggis Pinball makes four or five

[01:57] more titles after this. There's no way. They are losing money on every single fathom they make.

[02:03] They made every single mistake a small boutique company can make and you've seen the way this

[02:10] movie ends people and I'm so tired of people shooting the messenger. If Damien wants to control

[02:16] the narrative around Haggis Pinball, he can simply do what he said he was going to do and that is

[02:22] share photos of the production of these games. He's not doing any of it and he knows better and

[02:28] Marty knows better and all of you other pinball content creators out there that are shilling for

[02:33] these companies, you also know better because I'm listening to every single show out there

[02:39] and nobody is even talking about this and for this much money you deserve to know what's going on

[02:46] in the pinball world without having to suffer through two hour shows and you also deserve to

[02:52] know what's happening because these games cost so much money now. They cost so much money that I

[02:59] think it's absolutely a name that you have no idea what's coming out down the road right? You know

[03:06] what movies are coming out, you know what like video games are coming out, everything else in the

[03:10] world is pretty much out there but when it comes to what's happening next in pinball it's always

[03:16] got to be a secret and you know why it's got to be a secret because they want to create FOMO.

[03:21] They want you to buy these games without seeing them. They want you to spend $15,000 without even

[03:28] thinking about it without even deconstructing what you're about to buy and Canada is the

[03:33] destroyer of that world because I'm here to tell you what's next. Like you know Venom is coming

[03:38] out from Stern, did anyone else tell you Venom was coming? Nope, you heard it here. Let's just get

[03:43] right to it because I don't want to spend all Sunday inside the office. Here is some news you

[03:49] don't know about and you're hearing it here first on Canada's Pinball podcast. Thank you for being a

[03:55] club member, this is why you get the info first. So here's the first bit of news, Jack Winari is

[04:00] traveling to Chicago tomorrow to be at the JJP factory. Now Jersey Jack himself does not travel

[04:09] to the Chicago factory unless, get ready for it, unless there is a reveal imminent and so what does

[04:17] this mean? Jack is going to be there. Does this mean we are going to see Toy Story as early as

[04:23] early this week? Now I don't know for sure if that is going to happen but Jack being there

[04:30] is a very good sign that we are going to see Toy Story within the next couple of weeks and for

[04:38] those of you out there that think they're going to save it and reveal it at Pentastic, you're

[04:43] absolutely wrong. Jersey Jack is not going to unveil this game at Pentastic. They are going

[04:50] to unveil this game with a video from the same video production company that made the guns and

[04:58] roses video. There will be like a walkthrough video of the making of this game and if Jack is going

[05:05] there tomorrow that means we are either going to hear from Jersey Jack early this week or this.

[05:12] Jack could be there to be filming the video that they are going to put out very, very soon. This

[05:19] game is coming very, very soon. It is not like a month away. We are going to see the next title

[05:25] which is Toy Story from Jersey Jack Pinball in just a week or so and I still think that my May

[05:32] 23rd date could be the accurate date. I think we're going to see it any day now. So Jack being there

[05:40] that is news but is that the big news I have? No, it is not. So I have not seen Toy Story so I can't

[05:48] answer whether or not this game is going to be loaded with toys. What I do know is this. I heard

[05:53] that Jersey Jack because they have the license with Disney that gives them access to the characters

[06:00] in Toy Story that are Disney owned. It does not give them access to the characters in the Toy Story

[06:07] franchise that are not owned by Disney and that's stuff like Ken and Barbie. It's stuff like Etch-a-Sketch.

[06:15] It's stuff like The Slinky. So that's going to be interesting if we see Toy Story. Will we see all

[06:21] of the Toy Story characters from the movies or will we see more of Buzz and Woody and stuff like

[06:28] Rex and the piggy bank but they won't have the rights to stuff like Mr. Potato Head. So very,

[06:34] very interesting the way the Toy Story license works but I hope that Leonard spent more money

[06:40] and got access to everything in those movies because how can you have Toy Story and not Mr.

[06:46] Potato Head. Alright, so what else is new? So here's the big thing. So I am here to tell you right now

[06:52] with 100% confirmation. Are you ready for this? 100% confirmation that Steve Richie's next game

[07:02] with Jersey Jack pinball will be and I have 100% confirmation on this will be a music pin. So Steve

[07:12] Richie is working on a music pin. Now what is the music pin? I'm going to get you the title.

[07:19] Don't worry people. I know someone who knows what it is but we're not going to give it to you just

[07:24] yet but here is a clue for you. Steve Richie is working on a music pin that is based not on a band

[07:33] but on a solo act and it is also a solo act that is older. So what do we think Steve Richie's

[07:42] musical pin will be that is based on a single performer? So here's what my guesses were originally

[07:49] and I'm going to tell you what it's not. I know it's not Ozzy Osbourne. I also know it's not Michael

[07:56] Jackson. So what solo performer will be the musical pin that Steve Richie makes? A really curious

[08:03] decision if you ask me because we're going to go from Toy Story to Eric Minier's godfather to a Steve

[08:11] Richie music pin and then from there we are going to Mark Saden's pin. Now if you were to ask me

[08:17] what would Steve Richie's pin be about? So my first guesses for Steve Richie's music pin would be stuff

[08:23] like Elton John, it would be stuff like Billy Joel, it would be stuff like Bruce Springsteen,

[08:30] it would be stuff like Paul McCartney. Now think about Paul McCartney for a minute. So Paul McCartney

[08:36] has never had his own pinball machine and we know the Beatles have a pinball machine but we also know

[08:43] that Slash was really good friends with Paul McCartney and that's why Live and Let Die is in

[08:50] Guns N' Roses Pinball Machine. So do you think that Jersey Jack Pinball has a relationship with

[08:56] Paul McCartney now and they are going to make a Paul McCartney pinball machine? Now I don't think

[09:01] Paul McCartney would be the best selection. I think something like Elton John would be better

[09:06] but here's another thing I was thinking about Jersey Jack Pinball always loves to follow in the

[09:12] footsteps of Stern Pinball and so when you think about it like that what do you think about a Jersey

[09:17] Jack Pinball version of Elvis? I mean that would be killer Jersey Jack Pinball's Elvis. So we are

[09:25] going to be speculating on this but what is not up for speculation is whether or not Steve Richie's

[09:31] pin is a music pin. It is. Take my word for it, it's a music pin. Now here's the other thing I'm

[09:37] hearing that's very very interesting. So Mark Sadin was hired by Jersey Jack Pinball and you

[09:43] hear nothing about him. He made Metroid Pinball. Jersey Jack hired him. They put out a press release

[09:51] and I'm hearing from my very good source over at Jersey Jack Pinball that the theme that Mark is most

[09:58] likely working on is a little theme called the Matrix because they have the relationship with

[10:06] Warner Brothers. Who do you think makes Wizard of Oz? Who do you think has the license for stuff

[10:12] like Willy Wonka? I think Mark's inaugural game with Jersey Jack Pinball is going to be the Matrix.

[10:19] Everyone's like, Canada stop, you're spoiling all this. So now we know Toy Story, Godfather,

[10:26] music pin, the Matrix. I think that's going to be the next four releases from Jersey Jack Pinball

[10:33] and if they stay on the current schedule it will take us eight years to see all of those games.

[10:40] It's just crazy people. Look, this is it. There's nothing left for me to say. I'm going to tell you

[10:46] what I know and now you know it and now you know why. For five dollars a month you're getting the

[10:52] greatest news in all of Pinball. Take it to pin side. Say Canada said Steve Richie's game is a music

[10:59] pin. Say Canada said that Mark is making Matrix. Say Canada said Godfather, you know what's happening.

[11:05] You know, Canada's going to be right. I am right about 90% of the time when it comes to new games

[11:12] coming out. Everybody have a great Sunday. I'm going back home. I'm going to see my family. I'm here

[11:18] to prove to you that in just like 15 minutes I can give you all you need to know in the Pinball

[11:25] world and Damien and Marty if you don't show more fathoms soon we're coming for you guys. You can't

[11:31] hide in Australia. You got to show production. It's getting pretty lame. Everybody have a great day.

[11:37] We'll talk to you soon.
