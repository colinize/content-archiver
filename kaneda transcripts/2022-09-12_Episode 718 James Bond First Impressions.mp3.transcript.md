[00:00] And I said that you can't always get what you want.

[00:05] Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon.

[00:10] What a weird day in Pimbal.

[00:13] An hour ago, I was gonna do a show all about James Bond.

[00:16] I'm still gonna do that show, but we thought we were one day away

[00:20] from the official reveal of this game.

[00:22] And now Stern put out an announcement today

[00:26] that they're gonna delay the reveal of James Bond Pimbal

[00:30] in honor of the Queen passing.

[00:32] Okay, so this is really weird to me.

[00:34] I think this is one of the weirdest marketing mistakes

[00:37] I've ever seen in all of Pimbal.

[00:40] Stern, you knew the Queen passed away days ago.

[00:44] Then why did you bring the games over to the UK?

[00:47] Why are you setting them up at IAPA in the UK?

[00:50] Are you gonna leave the games on the show floor tomorrow?

[00:53] And so then everyone's gonna get a week

[00:55] of crappy cell phone images and videos of this game.

[00:59] This game is revealed.

[01:01] I think I wanna start with this.

[01:03] Jody Dankberg, and this is all Jody Dankberg.

[01:06] This is amateur hour.

[01:08] Jody needs to wake up and understand

[01:11] that in the modern world, you can't do it like this anymore.

[01:16] He's trying to sync up simultaneously revealing this game

[01:19] at a show in real life on a Tuesday

[01:22] with an internet reveal of the product.

[01:25] So what did you think was gonna happen, Jody,

[01:27] when you march these games out

[01:29] and you have people walking around the trade show,

[01:31] no one's gonna take a photo,

[01:33] no one's gonna share anything about the game.

[01:35] And so their chance to reveal this game to the world

[01:37] the right way was once again spoiled.

[01:41] And I just have to ask this question.

[01:42] How many messed up launches

[01:44] before the world's number one Pimbal company

[01:47] stops with this amateur hour approach

[01:49] to launching these games?

[01:51] It's such a disrespect to all the men and women

[01:54] who worked really hard on this game.

[01:56] It's such a disrespect to George Gomez

[01:59] and everybody who wanted to have their stuff

[02:01] shown to the world the right way for the first time.

[02:04] Why did you think this was gonna work?

[02:05] Remember, it was Jody Dankberg

[02:07] who brought like stranger things to CES people.

[02:11] He brings a game that's using a projector

[02:13] and puts it on a show floor in Vegas

[02:15] that has super bright lights above it.

[02:17] It's not gonna look good.

[02:18] It's not gonna work well and it didn't.

[02:20] It's almost comical now

[02:22] that every single Stern launch goes this way.

[02:25] And they need to learn from Jersey Jack.

[02:27] They need to learn how to launch a game.

[02:28] And I know what everyone's saying right now.

[02:30] Well, Jersey Jack needs to now learn from Stern

[02:33] how to put toys into a game.

[02:34] All right, so let's jump into the game

[02:36] now that we've seen it.

[02:38] Now that the mystery is over,

[02:39] now that James Bond Pimbal is out in the world,

[02:43] what are my first impressions of this game?

[02:45] And I'm gonna talk about it

[02:46] from a little bit of a macro point of view.

[02:49] I'm not gonna go over each insert

[02:51] and everything about the game.

[02:52] I wanna give you my broad strokes

[02:54] first impression of the game because I haven't played it.

[02:57] And I'm gonna give you

[02:58] my complete honest feelings about the game.

[03:00] My initial reaction to seeing James Bond was a mixed bag.

[03:05] My first reaction was I don't like the art.

[03:08] That's the first thing that jumped out at me.

[03:09] I just didn't like the art package on the game.

[03:12] We are used to seeing some beautiful Stern machines.

[03:15] And that was the first thing that just rubbed me

[03:17] the wrong way.

[03:18] I was looking at the artwork

[03:20] and I saw all the drag and drop kind of artwork.

[03:23] This feels very much like a Stern game

[03:25] before Stern games got good with art.

[03:28] It feels like a major step backward in the art department.

[03:32] I will not allow anyone out there to say,

[03:35] it looks pretty good.

[03:35] No, it does not look good.

[03:37] The art on this game,

[03:39] it looks like when Stern was making games like Elvis

[03:42] and the Sopranos, okay?

[03:43] So it has a throwback look to it.

[03:45] I will give you that,

[03:47] but it is not a good throwback look, okay?

[03:50] So the artwork sort of was like,

[03:52] oh no, it doesn't look as beautiful as I wanted it to.

[03:55] And then I looked at the game

[03:56] and I looked at what matters most.

[03:58] And I looked at the mechanisms in the game

[04:00] and I looked at the shots in the game

[04:02] and I looked at the features of this game and OMG.

[04:06] Am I excited to shoot this game?

[04:08] This game is packed.

[04:10] Like it is loaded.

[04:12] Like there is so much to shoot at

[04:14] that I got so excited looking at this game

[04:16] because that is what pinball is supposed to be.

[04:19] All of these years,

[04:20] I've been saying when you see a pinball machine

[04:23] for the first time,

[04:24] the world of that theme should come to life

[04:27] in a three-dimensional way,

[04:29] where you look at the game and you say,

[04:30] wow, I wonder what that does.

[04:32] I wonder what happens when I shoot over there.

[04:35] I wonder what happens when the ball hits there.

[04:37] I wonder how to get the ball from here to there.

[04:39] This game has that in spades.

[04:42] This is one of the most packed stern machines of all time.

[04:47] I was like, this is the greatest response

[04:49] to like the reaction we had to Toy Story,

[04:51] a game that didn't have many toys in it.

[04:53] Here's the thing about this game.

[04:54] This game has so many toys

[04:56] in which every single toy in this game,

[04:58] everything I'm looking at interacts with the ball.

[05:01] This isn't just like a static figure that does nothing.

[05:04] There are no cake toppers in this pinball machine.

[05:07] I thought it was like some ironic justice.

[05:09] If you think about it,

[05:10] what we saw in Toy Story

[05:12] and what we're seeing in this game right here,

[05:13] right where Pat Lawler put a huge L-City screen,

[05:17] what did Stern put?

[05:18] A ginormous missile that is physical,

[05:21] that locks balls, that is super amazing.

[05:24] And this is what pinball is.

[05:26] It's not about L-City screens.

[05:28] It's not about LED lighting.

[05:30] It's not about just artwork.

[05:32] Pinball is always about physical stuff

[05:34] that the ball should interact with.

[05:36] I mean it when I say this,

[05:37] when I glanced at this machine for the first time

[05:40] and saw all of these mechs and all of this stuff,

[05:42] this game feels like Stern Pinball is the company

[05:45] that's bringing Baldy Williams' error game.

[05:48] It just did.

[05:48] It feels like Stern Pinball is starting

[05:50] to load their games up with a lot of toys

[05:53] and this is good.

[05:54] This is such a good sign.

[05:56] And what I like about a lot of the stuff

[05:57] that the ball interacts with in this game,

[06:00] it's not just flat plastic.

[06:02] You've got an Aston Martin car.

[06:04] You've got the missile that sculpted.

[06:06] And my favorite thing in this entire game,

[06:08] my favorite mech in this entire game

[06:10] is the James Bond on a jet pack

[06:12] that has a magnet that grabs the ball

[06:15] and swings over and drops the pinball

[06:19] on top of the tank to destroy it.

[06:21] How cool is that?

[06:23] I wanna stop right there on this one thing.

[06:25] This is one of the coolest mechs

[06:26] if it works right in Stern Pinball history.

[06:30] I mean it.

[06:30] This stuff is super cool.

[06:32] You've got drop targets.

[06:34] You've got physical ball locks that mean something.

[06:37] And you've got a layout that's non-traditional.

[06:39] Like this is not a fan layout.

[06:41] This game doesn't look like anything else

[06:43] I've ever seen Stern do.

[06:45] It has a lot of originality.

[06:47] And I feel really excited about that.

[06:49] And so from a toy standpoint

[06:51] and from a mechanical world under glass standpoint,

[06:54] this game looks phenomenal.

[06:56] And I think all of us can't wait

[06:58] to see this game in action.

[06:59] And I think it's gonna shoot really well.

[07:01] You can tell it's pretty wide open,

[07:03] but there's a lot of unique shots in this game.

[07:05] I think there's gonna be a lot of fun combos in this game.

[07:08] When you just look at the layout of this game,

[07:10] it doesn't feel like a game

[07:11] where the ball is gonna get stuck

[07:12] in the pop bumpers all the time.

[07:14] You know, if you play Toy Story,

[07:15] a lot of the time you're just lobbing the ball up the middle

[07:17] and into those Buzz Lightyear pop bumpers.

[07:19] And I just think this game has a lot of wow.

[07:21] I absolutely am in love with this

[07:23] because I also think that this shows us

[07:26] that Stern Pinball is going to start packing their games

[07:29] more and more and more.

[07:31] And they know for these prices,

[07:34] you have to start putting stuff like this

[07:36] in pinball machines.

[07:36] You know, there's no middle ground anymore.

[07:38] You know, with all these pinball prices going higher

[07:41] and higher and higher, when you first see a game,

[07:43] you wanna see where the engineering went.

[07:46] And you wanna see toys and mechs in a game

[07:48] that make you feel giddy inside.

[07:50] And I think this game delivers on that.

[07:53] And that's why we love pinball, analog stuff

[07:56] that interacts with the ball, toys that lock the ball.

[08:00] A James Bond on a jet pack,

[08:02] carrying a pinball across the air,

[08:05] across the play field and dropping it on a target.

[08:08] This is exactly why we all love pinball.

[08:10] And this is what we wanna see more of.

[08:12] But then I look at the art again

[08:14] and I feel so deflated on some level.

[08:17] I won't lie to you.

[08:18] I feel deflated that Franchi's not doing this art package.

[08:21] Franchi would have made this game look so damn good.

[08:24] And I'm just gonna say it,

[08:26] the art department has let down the engineering department.

[08:30] Of course they're gonna say,

[08:31] this is what the licensor wanted us to do.

[08:33] This is the direction they made us go in.

[08:35] Of course they're gonna hide behind that excuse.

[08:38] And that's why Franchi would have been perfect

[08:40] because Franchi could have taken these assets

[08:42] and re-illustrated them in a way

[08:45] that would have looked so beautiful.

[08:47] Instead, everything looks very Photoshop dragged and dropped.

[08:50] The thing that Franchi does so well,

[08:52] he gives the images depth.

[08:54] He gives them warmth and character.

[08:56] And this stuff looks very flat.

[08:59] It just looks like it has no dimension to it.

[09:01] I don't know, this blue cabinet on the premium

[09:04] looks a lot like Thunderbirds

[09:05] and then you've got all that yellow on the doctor no.

[09:08] So I think these games aesthetically,

[09:11] aesthetically are not gonna win any awards.

[09:13] I do.

[09:14] I think aesthetically these games are a step back.

[09:16] I think they look like older stern machines.

[09:19] It's unfortunate because the art department

[09:22] should never let down the engineering department.

[09:25] It is so easy to get the art right.

[09:28] It is so hard to engineer magic.

[09:31] And I just wish these games looked more beautiful.

[09:35] Now you could argue that we haven't seen the HD images,

[09:38] but that's not my fault.

[09:40] This is what Stern always does.

[09:41] We're always looking at stuff

[09:43] in the most washed out and bad way possible.

[09:46] And that's Jody's fault and it's Stern's fault.

[09:49] Now the question becomes this people,

[09:51] do they keep these games on the floor at IAPA all week?

[09:54] Or are they gonna yank them off the floor?

[09:56] I mean, I think it would make sense

[09:58] if you're going to delay the launch

[10:00] that you take the games away.

[10:02] I mean, that would be the worst thing ever

[10:03] to delay the launch and then have three days

[10:06] of crappy cell phone footage of the game.

[10:09] Now, I mean, this is unbelievable.

[10:10] This is really one of the worst fumbled launches

[10:13] in the history of Pimbal.

[10:14] And I know how much this game means to Stern

[10:17] and they had so much time to plan it.

[10:19] And they knew the queen died a few days ago.

[10:22] This makes no sense.

[10:23] Absolutely no sense.

[10:24] And I think this is Gary Stern's the last minute decision

[10:27] because I've heard from people that Gary is always like,

[10:29] whenever something happens in society,

[10:32] Gary always wants to be sensitive to it.

[10:34] But are you telling me that as the world mourns

[10:37] the loss of the queen, that that overlaps somehow

[10:41] with the launch of a niche little Pimbal machine?

[10:44] There is absolutely no overlap there.

[10:46] This is not an insensitive thing to do.

[10:49] Like the world is still going on.

[10:51] Like concerts are still happening in the UK.

[10:53] Other sporting events are still happening.

[10:55] But launching Pimbal, that's where we draw the line.

[10:58] Can't do that because there's so many people paying attention.

[11:01] No, there's nobody paying attention to this.

[11:04] No, there's only a few thousand people

[11:05] that even care about this reveal.

[11:07] I also think it's a big mistake

[11:09] because you have a short FOMO window.

[11:11] And I mean this.

[11:12] There's a reason why they reveal a game in like 48 hours

[11:16] and lock in all of our money.

[11:18] Now we're gonna look at these crappy photos for a week.

[11:21] We're gonna study this game so much now over the next week

[11:24] that when the order banks open up,

[11:26] it's not gonna have the same frenzy it would have

[11:30] if they opened up tomorrow.

[11:31] The worst thing for FOMO is time.

[11:34] The worst thing you can give anybody on the fence

[11:36] about spending this much money on a toy

[11:38] is a lot of time to think about it.

[11:40] So we will see if that will impact sales.

[11:42] I don't think it really will,

[11:43] but it's not gonna be the same frenzy.

[11:45] It's not gonna be the same level of excitement

[11:48] because now we all have seen the game.

[11:50] And look, I see the comparison in the thread

[11:53] of Toy Story 4.

[11:54] Yes, I agree.

[11:55] This is the kind of mechanical stuff

[11:57] people wanted to see in Toy Story.

[11:59] I just think the launch of James Bond

[12:01] is going to hurt Toy Story sales.

[12:04] I think they're gonna hurt the sales of Toy Story.

[12:06] I think if you're locked into a $15,000 Toy Story CE,

[12:11] you're looking at this James Bond

[12:13] and it's hard not to look at it and say,

[12:15] I wish there was more stuff like this in Toy Story.

[12:18] I wish there were more analog toys.

[12:20] I wish there was more scopes.

[12:22] I wish there was more interaction with the ball.

[12:24] And you'd be right.

[12:25] And it doesn't have it.

[12:26] And that's just the way it is.

[12:27] I'm not gonna beat up Toy Story on this podcast.

[12:30] I just think that Storm Pinball gave us a game

[12:32] that is super packed.

[12:34] It looks like a really fun James Bond world under glass.

[12:37] I think the artwork is a swing and a miss.

[12:40] I do.

[12:40] I don't like the artwork in the game.

[12:42] I really wish the art would be as exciting

[12:44] as all the other stuff in the game.

[12:47] But when you start playing a pinball machine,

[12:49] you're not gonna be looking at the art.

[12:51] You're gonna be looking at all the fun stuff to shoot at.

[12:53] And that's the key people.

[12:55] A pinball machine should just have

[12:57] a lot of fun stuff to shoot at.

[12:59] And this game has fun stuff to shoot at in spade.

[13:03] You can see it.

[13:03] It's all right there.

[13:05] And that is what we want.

[13:06] That's what we want, Jersey Jack.

[13:08] It's what we want, Stern.

[13:09] It's what we want, American Pinball.

[13:11] It's what we want, Spooky and everybody else.

[13:14] You need to make games that have fun stuff to shoot at.

[13:18] This is pinball.

[13:19] I don't wanna play in LCD screen.

[13:22] I don't wanna be hoodwinked by just artwork.

[13:25] I want physical stuff that interacts with the ball

[13:28] that does magical stuff.

[13:30] I want James Bond on a jet pack,

[13:33] picking up a ball with a magnet

[13:35] and moving across the play field

[13:37] and dropping it on a tank.

[13:40] That's pinball, people.

[13:42] We will talk again this week.

[13:44] I feel a little bit deflated.

[13:45] I got the energy up.

[13:46] And now we have to wait a week.

[13:47] I don't wanna wait a week later.

[13:49] And I said that you can't always get what you want, honey.

[13:56] You can't always get what you want.

[14:02] You can't always get what you want.

[14:07] But if you try sometime, well, you might just find

[14:13] that you're what you need.

[14:15] Bye.

[14:17] Yeah.
