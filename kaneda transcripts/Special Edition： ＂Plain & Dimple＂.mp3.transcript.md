[00:00] and I've- I took her and joined his whiz.

[00:01] Yay!

[00:02] B�slet's wake!

[00:03] Smoke deal pie!

[00:03] Hi guys!

[00:04] Because obviously you have a tendency to over-react!

[00:06] Let's-

[00:07] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪

[00:13] Alright, we're gonna do a little special edition of

[00:16] Canadian's Pinball Podcast called Plain and Dimple.

[00:20] Plain and Dimple, short little podcast about things

[00:25] that should just be obvious to all of us by now.

[00:29] Plain and Dimple.

[00:30] I'm calling it Plain and Dimple because number one topic

[00:33] on this special edition of Canadian's Pinball Podcast

[00:35] are dimples in the play field.

[00:38] I- I think we have heard more complaints about play fields

[00:42] dimpling in the last two weeks than we've heard in

[00:47] an entire century of playing pinball.

[00:49] And can we all for once?

[00:51] Just finally agree that play fields dimple.

[00:56] This is not like some new phenomenon.

[00:58] This is not Stern Pinball now has cheap play fields

[01:03] and that's why they're dimpling.

[01:05] Play fields will dimple.

[01:07] Now yes, some play fields may dimple at a higher rate

[01:11] than others, but you are not gonna find a play field

[01:15] that never ever dimples.

[01:17] Now maybe some of you out there do have play fields

[01:20] that don't have any dimples, right?

[01:22] You've got a machine that never has air balls,

[01:25] nothing ever lands on the play field in a hard way.

[01:29] And those people will go up there and be like,

[01:32] I bought a Stern X-Man O'Lean and it has zero dimples.

[01:35] And now I got Batman and it's just,

[01:38] it's like moon craters everywhere on this pinball machine.

[01:41] I mean, can we stop?

[01:43] Can we stop?

[01:44] There will be dimples, right?

[01:46] But here's the thing.

[01:47] And as I read about this sort of shifting trend

[01:53] in people's reaction to Batman 66,

[01:56] I really think the other thing that's just

[01:58] playing in dimple or playing in simple is this.

[02:01] What did you guys expect Stern quality to be on Batman 66?

[02:07] I really don't understand why people thought

[02:09] because they were spending more on Batman 66,

[02:12] they were gonna get a machine that had higher quality

[02:17] than the machines that came out previously,

[02:20] especially previously in the year.

[02:22] Let's not forget the title before Batman 66

[02:26] was Ghostbusters, which was plagued,

[02:29] plagued by quality issues.

[02:32] And what happened?

[02:34] Did people wait to see if Batman would come out

[02:38] with no issues?

[02:39] Did people play one first?

[02:41] Did people see what a play field looked like

[02:43] after a few hundred plays before giving their money

[02:47] to Stern?

[02:47] No, you guys went all in without even seeing it.

[02:51] You bought 80 editions of Batman Super Ellie

[02:55] for $15,000.

[02:59] And you expect what?

[03:01] What product did you expect you were gonna get

[03:03] when you were paying three times

[03:06] what a Stern Pro was costing three times?

[03:10] Did you think you were gonna get a game

[03:11] that had three times better quality?

[03:13] Did you think you were gonna get a game

[03:14] that had three times the amount of clear coat?

[03:17] Did you think you were gonna get a game

[03:19] that people went over multiple times

[03:22] before it went in a box and went to you?

[03:24] No, we're still seeing the same sort of quality issues

[03:29] on a $15,000 pin that we saw on a $5,000 pin.

[03:32] You know why?

[03:33] Ding, ding, ding, people.

[03:35] Cause it's the same game.

[03:36] You really ran in and bought something

[03:40] that's the same quality as something that was $5,000

[03:44] for $15,000.

[03:46] I hate to use a car analogy,

[03:48] but you can't go buy a Honda Accord

[03:50] and expect to get the quality of a Bentley

[03:54] or a Mercedes or a Rolls Royce.

[03:56] But you spent Rolls Royce money

[03:59] and you got Honda quality.

[04:02] Now look, I don't even like using Honda

[04:04] cause Honda quality is probably better than

[04:07] that it rolls Royce.

[04:08] But you know what I'm saying?

[04:09] The fit and finishes just aren't there.

[04:12] So we need to stop.

[04:13] People need to stop complaining about dimples.

[04:15] And I saw someone's Batman 66 Playfield.

[04:19] I just had tons of dimples,

[04:20] even had dimples on the magnet, right?

[04:23] Even the magnet was dimpling.

[04:25] And then you got people on there who say like,

[04:28] I turn my play field upside down

[04:30] and I drop a ball on it and it doesn't dimple.

[04:33] It doesn't dimple.

[04:34] So something's going on with the clear code.

[04:36] Something's going on with this.

[04:37] Chasing after what causes dimpling

[04:41] and going on this crusade to find the answer

[04:46] is the most futile journey ever.

[04:49] It's common sense guys dropping a steel ball

[04:53] on you a piece of wood will create a dimple.

[04:57] It's just, and as people are saying,

[05:00] the games nowadays are moving faster.

[05:02] Balls are hitting so much more,

[05:05] they're ricocheting in all sorts of directions,

[05:07] they're breaking off of stuff,

[05:08] there's air balls left and right,

[05:10] you're gonna get dimpling.

[05:11] So we need to just stop.

[05:13] And this whole thing now where people are like,

[05:16] I'm demanding Stern replace my Batman

[05:18] because of these dimples, I'm doing this,

[05:20] I'm gonna take a picture of my play field

[05:22] at the exact angle I can see the dimpling.

[05:27] No, no, we're at the point now where people should know

[05:31] that if I'm buying a Stern, this is what I'm gonna get.

[05:35] And you guys rushed in and spent $10,000, $15,000

[05:40] from Batman 66, and you should have known

[05:43] that the quality was not gonna be levels above

[05:48] of what it was on Batman.

[05:51] I'm sorry, I'm Ghostbusters, on Game of Thrones,

[05:53] on Spider-Man, all those games had some issues,

[05:57] and you're not gonna get an issue-free game.

[06:00] You're not gonna get an issue-free game.

[06:01] And for those of those saying like,

[06:04] well, who's Stern even playing these games

[06:07] before they ship them out, right?

[06:09] We saw so many Batman's, it looks like

[06:12] we're the Batmobile, on the rotating mech,

[06:14] it just flies off, it just flies off the machine.

[06:18] More than one person has had that happen,

[06:21] screws are coming loose, and I think we all at this stage,

[06:26] no for sure, that yes, Stern doesn't test these games

[06:31] long enough before they go into market.

[06:34] They are not playing them,

[06:35] they're not putting these machines on location

[06:37] to go through its paces before asking you for your dollars

[06:41] before putting them in boxes for you.

[06:43] And that's a problem, like we saw this with Game of Thrones.

[06:46] The orbit shot didn't work on Game of Thrones,

[06:49] clearly when they made the L-leaves and the premiums,

[06:51] they didn't test it long enough,

[06:53] and the ball was getting stuck in the orbit.

[06:55] And what happened, people had to like rip apart

[06:57] their upper playfields.

[06:59] We saw it with Ghostbusters, the slimer mechanism,

[07:01] didn't really work at all.

[07:04] It was so finicky, and so what happened?

[07:06] They had to redesign the mech.

[07:08] Now that's something that should have happened

[07:10] and been caught at the factory.

[07:12] Same thing is maybe happening with Batman.

[07:14] It seems like the ball's getting held up on the mechanism

[07:18] and things are questionable in terms of their quality

[07:22] and their ability to take shots

[07:24] and take the punishment that happens in a pinball machine.

[07:27] Because we know they rushed Batman out

[07:29] to get it out by the end of the year

[07:31] to hit that anniversary date.

[07:33] So yes, if you go in on a stern,

[07:37] there might be a chance that it wasn't tested long enough.

[07:41] So, but at what point, people, at what point?

[07:45] Do we start saying to ourselves,

[07:47] this is what happens, this is the risk you take

[07:50] when you buy a stern.

[07:51] So if you get a stern, you might have some issues to deal with.

[07:55] Now look, I'm on the fence, 50-50 here,

[07:57] because I do think this is also a pinball machine.

[08:00] And yes, you should go around your machine,

[08:02] maybe in Titan, all the screws before you play the game

[08:06] for the first time.

[08:07] Yes, if there are certain items on there

[08:09] that it might be smart to put a little glue or proxy

[08:12] and keep those items, those toys are just tacked on.

[08:17] Maybe secure them a little bit more.

[08:19] That is what operators always had to do.

[08:23] This notion that new-in-box collectors now

[08:25] don't have to go through a machine,

[08:27] don't have to lift the plate, they'll ever,

[08:29] don't have to check stuff is a bunch of BS.

[08:32] So look, I think it needs to stop.

[08:34] I think it needs to stop.

[08:35] I think people need to realize that this is stern,

[08:39] that sterns will have some issues.

[08:41] And I'm just over seeing people complain

[08:45] and demanding new playfields left and right, excuse me.

[08:50] Speaking of that, plain and dimple, plain and simple,

[08:53] KPG, man.

[08:55] Look, I said it on our previous podcast,

[08:58] I really want you to get a new playfield from stern.

[09:01] And I know that they reached out and they contacted Trent

[09:04] finally, but that still doesn't give you a date

[09:07] and doesn't let you know exactly

[09:09] when your replacement will happen.

[09:10] But this guy, come on KPG, you gotta stop.

[09:14] I don't know if you saw what he did recently,

[09:15] but he put up an open letter to Gary Stern.

[09:19] Two pages, I read it, he talks all about his issues,

[09:22] how Gary's a Harley fan and how,

[09:26] would he ever accept his Harley,

[09:29] paint was chipping off and all that stuff.

[09:31] We get it, you've been waiting a long time.

[09:34] But, but they're going to take care of you.

[09:38] But I do think you've been blacklisted

[09:41] and put on the end of the line to be helped

[09:44] because of everything you've done

[09:46] and you continue to do it.

[09:48] Your obsession with getting your new playfield

[09:51] is gotta simmer down, bro.

[09:55] It's gotta simmer down.

[09:57] That's all I'm gonna say.

[09:58] I think you need to get a repair.

[10:01] If I'm Stern, yes, the squeaky wheel does get the grease.

[10:05] I really think plain and simple Stern needs

[10:08] to fix this guy's machine.

[10:09] But I also think KPG, the lesson for everyone else to learn

[10:13] is if you are gonna go onto a public forum

[10:16] and slander a company left and right

[10:19] and it still doesn't make sense.

[10:21] It still doesn't make sense to me how you and Gary

[10:24] were personally talking

[10:26] and you decided to take it to the forum

[10:30] before taking it to Gary.

[10:31] Gary ignored you and Stern stopped responding to you

[10:36] after, after you went on Pinside

[10:40] and went kinda crazy.

[10:42] And I think this is a lesson to a lot of people

[10:45] on their Pinside is not your customer service channel

[10:48] for Stern.

[10:49] It's not.

[10:50] It's not where you should have to go

[10:52] to get your customer service questions answered.

[10:54] In fact, if you go there too much

[10:57] and create too much of a PR and nightmare for a company,

[11:00] they may blacklist you

[11:02] because that's also the way the world works.

[11:06] Stern can stand behind its product

[11:07] but it also can say, I don't give a F

[11:10] if we burn this dude because he's going nuts

[11:14] and not giving us time to actually fix his machine

[11:17] because they didn't give you a timeline KPG.

[11:19] They didn't miss a date, right?

[11:21] They didn't say we're gonna have your replacement

[11:24] within 60 days or 30 days.

[11:26] You never got that in writing.

[11:28] So be patient, you have other machines.

[11:31] Don't you have a McLaren car?

[11:33] Aren't you like successful and wealthy?

[11:35] Chill the F out, bro.

[11:37] Chill out.

[11:38] They're gonna get your fix.

[11:40] So speaking, and this is the last point

[11:42] I wanna make on this special edition

[11:44] of plain and dimple, plain and simple,

[11:46] talking about promised dates

[11:50] and something that people shouldn't have to do.

[11:52] You should never have to go on pin side

[11:55] and complain about not getting a refund

[11:59] from a manufacturer.

[12:00] And I've seen this over and over and over again.

[12:04] People have to go on and say, I asked for a refund

[12:07] and I didn't get it and I'm still waiting

[12:09] and I'm talking about alien pinball right now

[12:13] and how someone had asked for a refund

[12:16] since October.

[12:18] Now, alien pinball, alien pinball, a refund policy.

[12:23] You put $1,500 down and they said,

[12:26] we will refund your money within 30 days.

[12:28] Now even when I went in on alien, Ellie,

[12:31] I asked for a refund.

[12:33] It took me much longer than 30 days

[12:35] to get my money back when I asked for a refund.

[12:38] I also am confused as to why it takes 30 days

[12:42] to get your money back when they get your money instantly.

[12:45] All right, that to me, that indicates

[12:48] that they can't quickly move money around.

[12:51] So I think that is a red flag.

[12:52] But we saw this gentleman, he had been emailing

[12:57] and asking for a refund since October.

[13:00] Now, I say what you will, this is not me rooting

[13:03] against highway, this is me making a statement,

[13:06] plain and simple, people should get refunds

[13:10] when they are promised their refunds.

[13:12] If you take someone's harder money and say to them,

[13:15] if for any reason you want your money back,

[13:18] we will give it back to you within 30 days.

[13:20] You are promising them a refund timeline.

[13:24] So someone who gave their money

[13:25] who asked for a refund in October,

[13:28] just got it yesterday.

[13:30] Let's count the amount of time that was.

[13:33] So let's just say October, November, December.

[13:36] So right there, right there.

[13:39] If it was mid-October and he asked for a refund,

[13:41] that's 90 days.

[13:43] 90 days.

[13:45] And he only got it because he had to go on

[13:47] Pinside and complain.

[13:48] And see, this is the issue.

[13:50] Is some people have to go complain

[13:53] on a public forum to get a response from Andrew.

[13:56] Andrew only did reply because of this person's

[14:00] Pinside complaints.

[14:03] And I think the reason why is Andrew doesn't want there

[14:05] to be a run to the bank where other people

[14:08] are asking for refunds.

[14:10] Now, what has happened?

[14:12] Andrew says, I took care of it.

[14:15] I refunded his money.

[14:16] Sorry for the delay.

[14:17] OK.

[14:18] Didn't answer why there was a 90-day delay.

[14:20] Didn't give any explanation.

[14:21] But what happened?

[14:22] This morning, you go in the thread.

[14:24] And you'll see, another individual has come forward

[14:27] and said, I am also waiting for a refund since October.

[14:30] So I just think this is not right.

[14:34] This is not right.

[14:36] These people, when they ask for a refund,

[14:38] should get their money.

[14:39] They shouldn't have to go on to Pinside.

[14:41] And I think the community needs to hold these manufacturers,

[14:45] whether it's Stern, whether it's Highway.

[14:47] We saw this happen with Skit B. People wanted refunds

[14:50] and they couldn't get them.

[14:51] God forbid, something goes wrong with the company.

[14:54] And then you can't get your refund.

[14:56] And no one spoke up that there were delays.

[14:58] Because we have to.

[15:00] We have to people as a community raise those red flags

[15:05] when we see them.

[15:06] So people can be careful with their money.

[15:10] And the red flags are everywhere.

[15:13] If people have quality issues with their Batman,

[15:15] they should share them.

[15:16] Everyone should.

[15:17] Because it's hard to tell if there's

[15:20] just two or three people that are having issues

[15:22] and quality control issues with their Sterns.

[15:24] Or if it's happening to a lot more people,

[15:26] but those other people just don't care.

[15:28] I got to say this.

[15:29] I sold my Batman, Ellie, to someone who didn't even

[15:32] know about code, code updates.

[15:34] He wouldn't, he doesn't know.

[15:35] He would just play the game the way it was for years,

[15:38] thinking that's the game.

[15:40] He doesn't know what a dimple is.

[15:41] He doesn't know what a ghosted insert is.

[15:43] So there are lots of people out there, not sure how many,

[15:47] but are just unaware of these issues.

[15:49] So plain and simple, plain and dimple,

[15:52] this little special edition is all about.

[15:56] Stop the constant complaining about dimples.

[15:59] Stop slamming Stern.

[16:02] Look in the mirror, everybody.

[16:04] And realize a Stern is a Stern.

[16:07] We could easily write down on a piece of paper.

[16:09] These are the things that you need to be aware of

[16:13] when buying a Stern.

[16:14] And if one of these conditions happens,

[16:17] you need to behave in the following manner

[16:20] to get a resolution.

[16:22] But to constantly think that you're getting more

[16:25] because you're spending more with a Stern is idiotic.

[16:28] And for people who thought that way,

[16:30] let's be honest, people.

[16:31] Let's just be honest for a minute here

[16:33] on this Return to Work Tuesday morning.

[16:35] Let's be honest.

[16:36] Stern's stuck.

[16:38] $5 toys on a machine,

[16:41] at charge 15 grand.

[16:43] And you were like, take my money, take my money.

[16:45] Look, they got away with it.

[16:47] They got away with it.

[16:48] And they rushed them out.

[16:49] I really wish they would have waited for code

[16:52] to be further along.

[16:53] I don't think Batman should have gone out

[16:55] as soon as they did.

[16:56] And maybe they should have just started

[16:58] with the premiums and get them out there.

[17:00] I know people who have 15,000 invested in a super LE

[17:05] really wanted to make sure that their pins

[17:07] were as close to perfect as possible.

[17:09] But it is what it is.

[17:11] For KPG, you gotta relax, bro.

[17:16] You can't do this.

[17:17] You can act like a little kid who's not getting his candy,

[17:21] especially when Willy Wonka, the candy manufacturer,

[17:24] invited you to the chocolate factory,

[17:27] invited you to deal with him personally

[17:30] to get a resolution.

[17:32] And then you can't go online and slam him.

[17:34] And you keep doing it.

[17:35] It's time to stop.

[17:36] I mean, open letters, petitions, all of this.

[17:40] You're, it's more indicative of your inability

[17:44] to have patience and relax.

[17:46] They're gonna take care of you.

[17:48] And for Andrew Highway, get refunds out when you promise.

[17:53] All right, so that's this little special edition.

[17:56] I also saw that Rick confirmed that attack from Mars

[18:00] remake is the next title.

[18:01] I think that's the horse kept secret

[18:03] and pinball everyone kind of knows that.

[18:06] It's Tuesday.

[18:07] We're all getting back into work

[18:08] for those of us who had off yesterday.

[18:11] Enjoy your pinball.

[18:12] Everyone, when you set a date, meet the date.

[18:16] If you see dimples, don't lose your shit.

[18:18] It's just pinball.

[18:20] It's a hard object hitting a softer object.

[18:23] A dent will occur.

[18:25] Enjoy your machines later.
