[00:00] You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me.

[00:04] I'm a weed.

[00:06] I'm never, ever, ever, ever.

[00:09] Getting back together.

[00:11] I'm a weed.

[00:13] I'm a weed.

[00:15] I'm a weed.

[00:16] Which one to get?

[00:17] Rick and Morty, or Guns and Rose, is that

[00:19] is an interesting question that someone posed on Pinside?

[00:23] Would you trade a blood-sucker edition of Rick and Morty

[00:27] for an Ellie of Guns and Rose?

[00:30] Is now the Rick and Morty spot is not made yet.

[00:33] It's like 500 and something.

[00:35] And I want to talk about this on this episode of Canita's

[00:37] Pinball Podcast, because I've played both Rick and Morty

[00:40] and Guns and Rose's.

[00:42] And I want to give my point of view on which direction

[00:44] I would go on.

[00:45] If those were the two options on the table, right?

[00:47] We're not talking about Zeppelin.

[00:49] We're not talking about cactus Canyon.

[00:51] We're not talking about Avengers.

[00:53] Let's keep it very focused here.

[00:55] Rick and Morty, 750 of them out in the world

[00:59] with great theme integration versus Guns and Rose's,

[01:03] which will have 5,000 Ellie's out in the world at some point.

[01:09] So almost 10 times as many Guns and Rose's Ellie's

[01:12] will be out in the world.

[01:13] So we're going to talk about whether or not we think

[01:15] it's better to keep the rareer, sort of less volume game

[01:19] with Rick and Morty, or go down the road of the jungle

[01:22] with GNR.

[01:24] And then after I talk about this,

[01:25] I'm going to talk about Big Lebowski's.

[01:27] And there's some issue with the shipping of these games

[01:29] and people paying in full.

[01:30] And then waiting a really long time.

[01:32] I'm not seeing anyone else talk about this.

[01:34] We're going to talk about that.

[01:35] And then we're going to talk about Rick and Morty's

[01:37] that were shipped shoved into a truck.

[01:39] And people are opening their boxes

[01:41] and seeing damaged cabinets.

[01:42] It's so painful.

[01:43] This photo is so painful.

[01:45] But let's get right to it.

[01:47] So if you were to ask me, Rick and Morty, or Guns and Rose's,

[01:51] it's subjective.

[01:52] OK, all pinball is subjective.

[01:54] And so the way I want to break this down

[01:56] is these games both have pros and cons.

[01:59] And we know that.

[02:00] And so let's start off by saying on a pure investment level.

[02:04] Let me start there.

[02:05] Which one on a pure investment level

[02:08] do I think will hold value more?

[02:11] And the answer there is easily Rick and Morty.

[02:15] There will only be 750 Rick and Morty's out in the world

[02:20] versus 5,000 Guns and Rose's.

[02:23] So when it comes to supply demand,

[02:25] it's always going to be harder to find a Rick and Morty

[02:28] than it will be to find a Guns and Rose's elite.

[02:31] Now, not right now.

[02:33] That's not the case.

[02:34] Now, I do agree that when all 750 Rick and Morty's are made,

[02:39] it's not going to be impossible to find these games.

[02:41] But here is why, if I were you and I

[02:44] were ordering a Rick and Morty, there

[02:46] is no way I would not check the box on the Butter Cabinet.

[02:50] The Butter Cabinet will be the LEDs of Rick and Morty.

[02:55] And the Butter Cabinet looks so damn amazing.

[02:58] If you've ever seen it in person,

[03:00] you are a fool if you ask me.

[03:02] You are a fool not to check the Butter Cabinet box

[03:05] because that turns any Rick and Morty into an LED.

[03:09] And you could go a step further and maybe do the cruise

[03:11] and play field.

[03:12] But I think that Butter Cabinet, Rick and Morty's

[03:15] will hold their value and they will be worth more.

[03:18] I love when people are like, well, it's not worth more

[03:20] in Rob Zombie, it's not worth more on Alice Cooper,

[03:22] it's not worth more on T&A because those games are not

[03:25] in high demand.

[03:26] Rick and Morty will always be in high demand

[03:28] because it is above and beyond the best theme

[03:31] spooky's ever done.

[03:32] But the Butter Cabinet will be the ones that

[03:35] maintain most of the value.

[03:37] But on a sheer supply number, absolutely owning Rick and Morty

[03:41] will be the better way to go than Guns and Rose's elite.

[03:44] Now right now, a GNR LE is rarer than Rick and Morty.

[03:49] There's less in the wild.

[03:50] So on that level, Rick and Morty wins.

[03:52] It's always going to be a game that is rarer

[03:55] and harder to find than a GNR LE.

[03:58] OK, now that's not why we buy Pimbal Machines.

[04:01] We're not buying Pimbal Machines solely

[04:04] to protect the investment in the game itself.

[04:06] It's a toy.

[04:07] It's meant to be played.

[04:08] It's meant to be enjoyed.

[04:09] If you had $8,500 bucks or $9,500,

[04:12] and you want it to buy something that's

[04:14] going to hold value or go up, you

[04:16] could buy much better things than a Pimbal machine.

[04:18] You could put that money in the market.

[04:20] You could buy a Rolex watch.

[04:21] You could buy way more things that would probably

[04:23] be good investments.

[04:24] But on a pure Pimbal investment level,

[04:27] Rick and Morty takes the nod.

[04:28] Now, from there, let's talk about theme integration

[04:31] because these two pins are probably

[04:33] the best theme integrated pins we've

[04:35] had in Pimbal in a very long time.

[04:38] I would argue these are the best theme integrated Pimbal

[04:41] machines since Batman 66, since, ah, from there,

[04:45] where do you go?

[04:46] Since Star Wars had decent theme integration in terms

[04:49] of the assets.

[04:50] But when it comes to theme integration,

[04:51] Pimbal is sorely lacking when it comes to it.

[04:56] Now, Rick and Morty is incredible theme integration.

[05:00] The call outs are incredible.

[05:01] The fact that the creator made this game.

[05:04] I mean, both of these games are very unique in that slash

[05:07] and Justin are the ones who made these games with the companies.

[05:11] So they gave them almost everything

[05:13] and then some that you would want in terms of theme integration.

[05:17] Now, which one has better theme integration?

[05:19] And I think without it out, without it out,

[05:22] they're both really good.

[05:23] But the best theme integration has to go to guns and roses.

[05:26] I mean, it's got more than Rick and Morty has and then some.

[05:29] Now, Rick and Morty has better call outs for sure.

[05:32] But come on, I mean, it's like, you know,

[05:33] he's doing the voices of Rick and Morty

[05:35] and it's a cartoon show that's all about humor.

[05:37] So of course, it's easy to incorporate those call outs

[05:41] into a pinball machine better than GNR.

[05:43] But other than call outs, if you think about it,

[05:46] I think GNR has way better theme integration

[05:48] with everything else in the game.

[05:50] You've got all the songs, studio recorded songs, 22 songs.

[05:54] Do we have 22 adventures in Rick and Morty yet?

[05:57] Not there yet.

[05:58] But for me, this is the big part.

[05:59] This is where Rick and Morty on theme integration

[06:01] is a little bit of a letdown.

[06:03] It's a little bit of a letdown

[06:04] in how the theme is integrated onto the game itself, right?

[06:08] The game itself just doesn't really scream Rick and Morty

[06:12] with the mechanisms.

[06:13] It doesn't really scream Rick and Morty

[06:15] with what you shoot at in the game.

[06:17] It just doesn't.

[06:18] It just doesn't.

[06:19] Like the house is there, it's the Rick and Morty house.

[06:22] But I'm just telling you, shooting into the garage,

[06:24] it's just not a moment.

[06:25] It's not a moment.

[06:26] The garage door doesn't open up.

[06:28] There's not much going on.

[06:29] And we've got a spaceship on a spring.

[06:32] That was a fight all our toy.

[06:33] The Galaxy and Crystal's, I think that's the name of it.

[06:35] It's just there.

[06:36] It's 3D sculpted.

[06:37] The stuff is there like in the artwork and whatnot,

[06:40] but it's not really that interactive, okay?

[06:43] Now the other thing is this.

[06:44] And I think this is the big thing that,

[06:46] I think loses some of the charm of the show for me

[06:49] is that none of the other characters from the show

[06:52] are represented in the game other than their images

[06:55] on the play field.

[06:56] And you know, you see them sometimes on the screen,

[06:58] but you never hear from the other family members.

[07:01] And I think just on that level,

[07:03] that loses a few points when it comes to theme integration

[07:06] because Jerry and Beth and the family of Rick and Morty,

[07:09] you want to see more of it come to life.

[07:11] I want to see the dog talk when he turns into the robot.

[07:13] So we get so much of Rick and so much of Morty,

[07:16] but that's it.

[07:17] In G&R, we get all the band members

[07:20] playing all the instruments.

[07:21] Like no one's left out of the songs themselves.

[07:23] I know people are gonna be like,

[07:24] that's a stupid comparison,

[07:25] but you know what I mean?

[07:26] You know what I mean?

[07:26] It's so much of Rick and Morty,

[07:28] but not everyone we love on the show.

[07:30] It would have been great if we could have got a few more

[07:32] of the characters from the show into the game

[07:35] and into those clips.

[07:36] But look, it doesn't hurt it that much.

[07:37] I mean, don't get me wrong.

[07:38] I'm not complaining that much about them omitting that.

[07:42] And we know why,

[07:42] because it's just another licensing agreement

[07:44] to get those additional voices into the game.

[07:47] So G&R I think is just theme integration on crack.

[07:50] I don't think we're ever gonna see another game

[07:52] that gives us as much as Guns and Roses

[07:55] when it comes to theme integration.

[07:56] I mean, it literally is everything you could hope for

[07:59] and then some in a pinball machine.

[08:00] I mean, the only thing that I probably would love

[08:03] to have had was Axe or Rose doing custom callouts

[08:06] in the game,

[08:07] because Axe is the voice of the band.

[08:08] He's the most animated.

[08:10] You know, I don't get excited by Melissa.

[08:11] She's not really a member of like the Guns and Roses

[08:14] we know in love.

[08:15] She's a newer member of Guns and Roses.

[08:17] She's incredibly talented, nothing against her.

[08:20] But when I hear her talk, that doesn't make me, you know,

[08:23] I don't associate a female voice with Guns and Roses.

[08:26] It's just not the band that everyone loves.

[08:28] That's not the band that sold all these albums

[08:30] and slash as a chill dude.

[08:32] He's not a hugely animated guy.

[08:34] So, you know, you're not gonna get that level of callouts.

[08:37] Now, the best callouts in Guns and Roses I love

[08:40] are they got the guy who introduces them.

[08:42] Like, you want the best?

[08:43] Well, they couldn't make it.

[08:44] I forget what his name is.

[08:45] But when you play G&R and I've played G&R,

[08:48] never did I feel like the callouts were an issue.

[08:51] There's so much more going on and it's a rock and roll concert.

[08:54] Like, if you think about it,

[08:55] when you're at a rock and roll concert,

[08:57] there's not someone over the PA system,

[09:00] constantly talking and interrupting the songs.

[09:03] And that's why you don't even want too many callouts

[09:05] when you start a song in G&R

[09:06] because you want to just enjoy the concert

[09:08] and you want to make it through the song

[09:10] to get to the jackpot, all right?

[09:11] And just in general, in terms of like what's on the game itself.

[09:13] Now, I hear a lot of people complaining.

[09:15] There's no toys in Guns and Roses.

[09:17] There's nothing to do in Guns and Roses.

[09:19] You gotta go play Guns and Roses.

[09:20] There's way more to shoot at in G&R

[09:23] than there is to shoot at in Rick and Morty.

[09:25] So, let's go to the next topic,

[09:26] which one shoots better?

[09:27] And without a doubt, G&R is a much better shooting pin

[09:31] than Rick and Morty.

[09:32] But there's a caveat coming.

[09:34] I would argue that Rick and Morty is much faster

[09:36] and quicker to play and jump into

[09:38] and get going right away.

[09:39] I think G&R is a little bit of a slower game.

[09:42] You will spend more time on a G&R game

[09:45] than you would on a Rick and Morty game.

[09:47] And so, for those of you looking for fast,

[09:49] again, that's a little bit faster,

[09:50] a little bit more brutal, a little bit more chaotic.

[09:52] I think Rick and Morty will be of more appeal to you.

[09:55] So, if that's your type of game,

[09:57] you might rank the game play on Rick and Morty

[09:59] over Guns and Roses.

[10:00] But Guns and Roses shoots so buttery smooth.

[10:03] I mean, it is really a pleasure to shoot that game.

[10:06] I will say this though, I will say this though.

[10:08] It does feel a little bit floaty.

[10:10] I need to crank up the power on the flippers

[10:13] when I get my G&R because I did feel

[10:16] that it's a little bit in slow motion,

[10:18] especially coming from a Rick and Morty

[10:19] where the ball is really just flying all over the place.

[10:23] G&R does not feel that way.

[10:24] Now, there is no escaping the fact that no matter

[10:27] how much tweaking you do, no matter how much moving

[10:30] of screws and rails and this and that,

[10:32] adjusting flippers, Rick and Morty is clunky.

[10:35] It is clunky.

[10:37] The shots are really tight.

[10:39] There is no way.

[10:40] I don't care what you do.

[10:42] I don't care what you do.

[10:43] There is no way you can make Rick and Morty shoot

[10:46] as smoothly as G&R.

[10:48] And I think to me, that is like the one thing

[10:51] that really a lot of pinball people who love pinball machines

[10:54] because of how they shoot,

[10:55] they will find Rick and Morty to be somewhat disappointing

[10:58] in the shots of the game.

[11:00] And that's just the way they design the game.

[11:02] I mean, Scott says he wanted to make it brutal.

[11:04] He lives off of the tiers of pinball players.

[11:06] I think the game would have been more enjoyable

[11:08] if some of those shots were smoother and opened up more,

[11:11] but it's never gonna happen.

[11:12] So if you like a challenging game,

[11:14] Rick and Morty will challenge you.

[11:17] You won't be as challenged in G&R

[11:20] to find the shots and hit the shots.

[11:22] So that's why some people think G&R might be

[11:23] too easy and there's too many multi balls

[11:26] and missing that, okay?

[11:27] Now, light show.

[11:28] Obviously, Rick and Morty has one of the best light shows

[11:31] in pinball.

[11:32] Unfortunately, it ran up against the greatest light show

[11:35] in the history of pinball and that's G&R.

[11:37] So you gotta give the visual experience to guns and roses.

[11:40] Okay, let's go to audio.

[11:42] Now, it's really hard to compare the amazing music

[11:45] that's in Rick and Morty to guns and roses.

[11:48] You know, a band that sold over 100 million albums

[11:51] versus the music that Scott put in Rick and Morty.

[11:54] Now, I think both, I think it's a toss up.

[11:56] I don't think one wins over the other

[11:57] when it comes to music because they're both incredible.

[12:00] The thing I love so much about Rick and Morty

[12:02] is how the music changes throughout the game

[12:05] when you go into different dimensions,

[12:07] when you start different adventures.

[12:08] The music is incredible.

[12:10] Both of them, I would say this,

[12:11] both of them do a perfect job of using music

[12:15] to transport you into the world of those two pins

[12:19] and they both are phenomenal.

[12:21] So it's a coin toss on which one has better music.

[12:24] There's just more music in G&R.

[12:26] What about creativity?

[12:27] I know creativity is a really subjective thing.

[12:30] I mean, how creative is the game?

[12:32] How creative is the approach of how they brought

[12:35] each theme to life?

[12:36] I do think that guns and roses and the creative approach

[12:40] to make the pinball machine feel like you're going

[12:42] to a concert wins because it just felt like

[12:46] such a unique and interesting way to sort of explore

[12:50] a rock and roll pinball machine.

[12:52] When it comes to creativity and Rick and Morty,

[12:54] and I look down at the game and you've got the Denise-Sea lock,

[12:57] you've got the scoop up the middle.

[12:58] I mean, both games are dominated by a scoop up the middle,

[13:01] which is really interesting.

[13:02] They have a very similar feature in the middle of each game.

[13:05] I just think that Rick and Morty knowing the Rick and Morty

[13:07] universe, I do think there is a little bit of a lack

[13:11] of creativity going on with how they brought the game to life.

[13:15] Again, to me, and I'm just going to say it,

[13:17] it feels a lot like TNA with ramps.

[13:19] It does.

[13:20] It feels like TNA and we're going to add some ramps to it.

[13:23] And again, that's not a bad thing.

[13:26] People love TNA.

[13:27] They love how the game shot.

[13:28] But I just wanted there to be a little bit more creativity

[13:32] on how they brought that theme to life under the glass, okay?

[13:36] Let's talk about art package.

[13:37] Which one has the better art package?

[13:38] Well, again, this is another one where,

[13:40] Rick and Morty looks like Rick and Morty.

[13:43] And I'm really happy with the Rick and Morty art package.

[13:46] I love the cabinet artwork on Rick and Morty.

[13:48] I thought it was amazing.

[13:49] I love that there's art on both sides of the cabinet

[13:52] that's different.

[13:53] It's not a deal breaker for me.

[13:54] I see people complaining about the CES

[13:56] or the same art on both sides.

[13:57] Yeah, but you can't stand on one side or the other.

[14:00] You can only get to see one side at a time.

[14:02] So I never get bothered by that.

[14:04] When it comes to art package or just like visually

[14:07] looking down on the game, I will say that guns and roses

[14:10] just visually, all of it together.

[14:12] The artwork, the upper play field, the layout.

[14:15] I do think visually, without a doubt,

[14:17] G&R wins it here.

[14:20] It's just way more going on in the game, way more detail.

[14:23] I just think G&R, like again, if you had them next

[14:26] to each other and you said, which one visually

[14:29] is blowing you away, it's gonna go to guns.

[14:31] Now look, all of this seems to feel like,

[14:33] oh, it's unanimously guns and roses.

[14:35] And I'm here to tell you, it's not that unanimous

[14:38] because G&R obviously is going to be a level above

[14:41] a spooky machine or two levels above a spooky machine.

[14:43] I mean, I don't think anyone would ever doubt

[14:46] that Jersey Jack Pimball puts way more into their games

[14:49] than spooky does, right?

[14:50] So without a doubt, I'm not surprised it's winning

[14:53] in a lot of these categories, okay?

[14:55] Now the next category is code.

[14:57] Which one has better code?

[14:59] Right now, as it stands, I definitely think G&R code

[15:03] is deeper, has more in it, there's more to do in the game.

[15:08] Now, Rick and Morty will continue to give us more

[15:11] and more code updates.

[15:12] I will say this and I keep saying this,

[15:14] Rick and Morty has the potential to beat G&R on code.

[15:18] It also has the potential to get way more creative

[15:22] in its code than G&R.

[15:23] The ability to mix adventures with going through

[15:26] different dimensions, I think opens the door

[15:29] for some of the most creative code in Pimball history.

[15:33] But I'm here to tell you right now,

[15:34] I still don't think the dimensions are nearly

[15:38] as creative as they could be in Rick and Morty.

[15:41] I really want you to go through dimensions

[15:43] and I want the machine to do crazy stuff.

[15:47] I really do, there needs to be a blackout dimension.

[15:50] How do you not have a dimension in Rick and Morty

[15:52] where the lights go out?

[15:53] Like it would be so cool to do stuff.

[15:55] I could sit in a room with the coders of this game

[15:58] in Scott Dinesy and come up with 15 dimensions,

[16:01] using all the mechs, using everything in the game

[16:03] that would just be so hysterical and amazing

[16:06] to jump into.

[16:07] That's where I think they have such a great opportunity.

[16:09] Now I'm not gonna say they're not gonna get there,

[16:11] but it needs more of that wackiness.

[16:13] Just really wacky shit going on, sorry,

[16:15] I don't mean the curse.

[16:16] When it comes to adventures, like there's a lot.

[16:18] There's a lot of people's favorite adventures

[16:21] in the show that have not been transported over yet.

[16:24] Okay, when the dog gets really smart,

[16:26] I love that adventure.

[16:27] I love the adventure when it's like mini-rick, right?

[16:29] That's so awesome.

[16:30] So are we gonna see more of these put into the game?

[16:33] The answer is yes, like they are coming.

[16:35] It's just gonna be, you know, a while.

[16:37] When all this said and done,

[16:38] I think Rick and Morty will have tons of variety.

[16:41] I think GNR will have tons of variety,

[16:44] but ultimately, I think right now,

[16:46] GNR takes the cake on code.

[16:48] This seems like it should be 90% of the votes

[16:50] for GNR only 10% for Rick and Morty,

[16:51] but if you look at the votes on Pinside,

[16:53] it's like 57 to 43.

[16:56] Now, here's the part with all of this comparison.

[16:58] I just sat here right now and probably told you,

[17:00] GNR wins in the majority of these categories

[17:04] in which one I think is better or gives you more.

[17:06] And in Pimbal Fashion, none of that matters

[17:09] if the following category isn't the box you check.

[17:13] And that is, you know it's coming.

[17:15] It's Gary Stern's favorite line.

[17:17] Which one is more fun, right?

[17:20] So all of that in mind, which one is more fun?

[17:23] Because this is always where Jersey Jack Pimbal falls down.

[17:26] They always put more in their games.

[17:29] They always have deeper code.

[17:31] They always have a lot going on in the Pimbal Machines,

[17:34] but then you say, is it more fun

[17:37] than the other games in the market

[17:39] and you don't check the box?

[17:41] So is Rick and Morty more fun than Guns and Roses?

[17:46] All right, now what is Knai to think about this loaded question?

[17:49] Here's how I'm going to answer this question.

[17:52] If I had just five minutes to play Pimbal

[17:55] and I was brand new on each machine,

[17:57] Rick and Morty is more fun immediately.

[18:00] It is more fun to jump on a Rick and Morty

[18:02] and play a quick, fast, fun Pimbal experience.

[18:06] It just is.

[18:07] It's easy to understand what's going on.

[18:09] There's just, you know, you hit the ramp,

[18:10] you start the adventure, you're in the adventure

[18:12] and all of a sudden you're being fed

[18:14] what you love about Rick and Morty and it's super simple.

[18:17] It's easier to start an adventure

[18:18] than even start a song and Guns and Roses.

[18:20] Like chances are you're going to start an adventure

[18:22] on your first ball of Rick and Morty.

[18:24] So it is immediately satisfying.

[18:27] Which is what Pimbal needs to be.

[18:28] You know, Jersey Jack games usually take a little bit longer

[18:31] to get into the game and into the fun.

[18:33] Now, out of all the Jersey Jack games in the world,

[18:36] G&R is the one that gives you much more immediate fun

[18:38] than anything else they've ever released, okay?

[18:41] But here's the thing.

[18:41] The fun of Rick and Morty, it wears thin quickly

[18:46] because after like a half hour or an hour

[18:49] of playing that game, you are going to almost

[18:52] see everything in the game.

[18:54] You will probably randomly see almost every adventure.

[18:57] You'll start most of the dimensions

[18:59] and you will not have a lot more left for you to experience

[19:04] after a few hours with the game.

[19:06] After a few hours with Guns and Roses,

[19:08] will you see the whole game?

[19:09] No, after a few hours of Guns and Roses,

[19:11] will you make your way through songs?

[19:13] Probably not.

[19:14] So I think that in the short term,

[19:16] Rick and Morty is a great pin

[19:18] when you have a lineup of games.

[19:20] Some of them have longer ball times,

[19:22] some of them have deeper code.

[19:23] But it's a great addition to any collection

[19:26] in which you want a game that's fast and fun

[19:28] and it'll make you laugh right away.

[19:30] I mean, when people walk up to Rick and Morty

[19:32] and Rick is cursing at you to fire the ball

[19:34] and hit the F and ramp,

[19:35] I mean, there is no game out there

[19:37] that has this kind of personality in it.

[19:39] I mean, on a purely personality level,

[19:41] Rick and Morty wins.

[19:43] Like it wins.

[19:44] Like it's one of the most hysterical pinball machines ever

[19:47] and I think it's a great addition because of that.

[19:49] But it wears thin quickly.

[19:51] And once you hear those jokes over and over again,

[19:53] and you see the same adventures over and over again,

[19:56] and you realize that filling out your adventure card

[19:59] doesn't really get anything more to you,

[20:01] then it starts to wear thin quickly.

[20:03] And I think GNR is just gonna have more replay value

[20:06] in the long term.

[20:07] See, and that's ultimately where I think

[20:09] a lot of you are gonna have to make up your minds.

[20:11] How many games do you have in your collection?

[20:14] Is this your only pin?

[20:15] And if so, that might change which direction you go in.

[20:18] Now personally, I don't think if you had both

[20:21] of these you'd be unhappy.

[20:22] I mean, I would love to have a Rick and Morty

[20:24] next to a Guns and Roses.

[20:26] I think those two machines would nicely complement each other.

[20:29] I think any game that does a theme justice

[20:32] is a game you wanna own.

[20:33] So if you're a fan of Rick and Morty,

[20:36] I think you're gonna love Rick and Morty.

[20:38] You might not love the shots.

[20:39] You might wish there were more toys in the game,

[20:41] but if you really, really love this theme,

[20:44] I think there's a lot you're gonna be satisfied with.

[20:46] But I will tell you this, I've heard

[20:47] from Rick and Morty fanboys who love the theme so much,

[20:51] but the game let them down on a pinball level.

[20:53] Okay, and for that reason,

[20:55] some of them have sold their pins already,

[20:57] and some of them have dumped them already

[20:58] while the going is good on getting your return on investment.

[21:01] And if you're a huge Guns and Roses fan,

[21:03] I don't think you'll ever find anything

[21:05] that makes you wanna get rid of Guns and Roses.

[21:06] This is the coolest rock and roll pinball machine of all time.

[21:09] It is like being transported to a Guns and Roses concert.

[21:13] It's a pinball experience like no other.

[21:15] Now, if you're not the biggest Guns and Roses fan,

[21:18] and you want something that wins on a pinball level

[21:21] as much as a theme level,

[21:23] you might be a little bit mixed on G-N-R.

[21:25] I can see why people might be a little bit mixed on G-N-R,

[21:28] but I would implore you, have a whiskey or two,

[21:31] drink some beer, get on the night train,

[21:34] and if you walk up to G-N-R,

[21:36] and you walk up to it and experience it for what it is,

[21:39] a rock and roll concert in pinball form,

[21:42] I find it hard to believe that anyone

[21:45] cannot really enjoy what that game is doing

[21:48] because it is unbelievable.

[21:51] It is as much fun to play as it is to watch.

[21:53] Now, I think some people out there are getting cranky

[21:56] about it not shooting like Avengers or it's not this or that.

[22:00] It's a rock and roll concert in a box.

[22:02] And again, a few whiskey's in

[22:04] and all of these pinball machines become more enjoyable.

[22:06] Don't get me wrong, this is what pinball was meant to be.

[22:08] So, you see what I did here?

[22:10] G-N-R wins almost every category,

[22:12] but ultimately it might not be the machine for you

[22:15] based on the variables that you're looking for

[22:17] in a pinball machine.

[22:18] Now, look, spooky games are still spooky games,

[22:20] right? They're getting better each game.

[22:22] They're nowhere near the level of a JJP game.

[22:25] JJP games put more in them, but they're not often fun.

[22:28] I think G-N-R is the first JJP game that is fun.

[22:32] It's easily accessible.

[22:34] You don't need a 25-page book to learn how to play it.

[22:37] And even with one game,

[22:39] even if you just play one game on G-N-R,

[22:41] you're gonna start a song.

[22:42] You're gonna get to experience the magic of this pin.

[22:44] Everybody will get to experience it.

[22:46] Nothing's buried too deep into the game.

[22:48] It's not like walking up to pirates

[22:50] and you're completely confused

[22:51] about why you're selecting 22 characters.

[22:53] It's not like dialed in

[22:55] where you don't even care about the theme itself.

[22:56] It's not like the hobbit where there's really nothing

[22:58] to shoot at, but chop wood all day long in that game.

[23:01] So, that's my take on what I would do.

[23:03] Now, if I were this guy, if I were this guy,

[23:05] I gotta be honest, if I were this guy,

[23:07] I would keep the Rick and Morty spot right now.

[23:10] And just go get the Guns and Roses if you can get it.

[23:12] If it's one or the other, because here's the thing,

[23:14] you're not gonna be asked to pay for that Rick and Morty spot

[23:16] for months.

[23:17] And you can maybe grab a GNR LE right now.

[23:20] You could play it, you could enjoy it,

[23:22] and you could sell your GNR LE

[23:24] when your Rick and Morty payment is due.

[23:26] And you probably won't lose much money.

[23:28] So, that is what I would do.

[23:29] Now, speaking of GNR production,

[23:31] I've heard that CES will not be on the line this year.

[23:35] They're waiting on parts.

[23:36] They're waiting on parts.

[23:38] I think they're waiting to see what the play field issues are.

[23:40] And if the new batch has any issues,

[23:42] because I saw that, someone posted that,

[23:44] they found the problem.

[23:45] It was just a batch of 40 games.

[23:48] And those were the ones that were impacted.

[23:50] In the other batches, it was only one out of like,

[23:52] so many that were affected.

[23:54] But here's the thing, nobody believes that.

[23:56] Because if that were the case,

[23:58] and it was only a small batch effected,

[24:01] how did that small batch get made?

[24:03] Was Mirko asleep at the wheel?

[24:04] Was he drinking one day when he made those 40 play fields?

[24:07] And also, here's the real thing that just discredits

[24:10] that being the case.

[24:11] We saw the same issues on Willy Wonka.

[24:14] We saw the same issues on Pirates of the Caribbean.

[24:16] So you mean to tell me that this isn't a real issue

[24:19] that's affecting many games.

[24:20] It's only on 40.

[24:22] I don't buy it.

[24:22] Now, there are going to be eagle eyes,

[24:25] looking at the new alleys that go out the door.

[24:28] I really don't know how many they're shipping.

[24:29] Because if you look at G&R right now,

[24:31] I feel like we're not seeing people unbox ones every week.

[24:34] It feels like they're building them,

[24:36] and they're not shipping them out

[24:37] until they've built a certain number of them.

[24:39] So I don't know if they're shipping them out

[24:40] 50 at a time, or 100 at a time.

[24:43] It definitely doesn't feel like these are going out

[24:45] the door every week.

[24:46] And so the new builds of the alleys

[24:49] are going to be scrutinized for quality.

[24:51] And we should be looking over these things

[24:54] to make sure the quality is there, all right?

[24:55] All right, the big Lebowski.

[24:57] So here's the thing, you know,

[24:59] the irony of the big Lebowski right now

[25:01] is that new buyers need to stay patient

[25:04] and buy these games at 12.5.

[25:07] They're the only chance the old EAs have

[25:10] of getting their game.

[25:11] Now, the EAs have waited almost five years

[25:13] to get their game.

[25:14] And so what's happening now is new buyers

[25:16] are paying for games in fall

[25:18] in which they're being told that their games

[25:20] will ship in four to six weeks.

[25:22] Now what's happening is they're buying these games

[25:24] and their games aren't always shipping in four to six weeks.

[25:27] And that's frustrating many people.

[25:29] And they're starting to complain,

[25:31] why did I pay in fall if it's not here?

[25:33] Why did I pay in fall if I'm not getting my game?

[25:36] And then the EA guys are like,

[25:37] are you really complaining?

[25:39] You have to wait three months.

[25:40] Try waiting five years.

[25:42] But the EA guys can't really be upset with the new buyers

[25:46] because without the new buyers,

[25:47] the EA guys don't get their games.

[25:49] Are you confused yet?

[25:50] You should be.

[25:51] Because this whole thing on some level,

[25:53] on some level, if you break it down,

[25:55] this thing still sucks.

[25:56] Like this is so stupid that people paid in fall

[25:59] for this game five years ago.

[26:01] And their only hope of getting a game

[26:03] is that you had to jack the price up

[26:05] and you had to like make people come in with new money

[26:08] to build games that old money already paid for.

[26:11] Look, they're slowly getting it done.

[26:13] But I'm not surprised that Barry is taking money

[26:16] and not shipping games out when he says he is.

[26:19] I'm not surprised that coin taker is taking money

[26:22] and they're not quite sure what's going on

[26:24] over there in the Netherlands.

[26:25] I mean, this isn't like they're making these games

[26:27] down the block.

[26:28] And so Melissa at coin taker is being told

[26:31] one thing from Barry.

[26:32] So then she takes the money.

[26:34] And then who knows, right?

[26:35] I mean, my thing is this.

[26:36] I wouldn't want to pay money for a game

[26:39] until it's built until it's built and in a box.

[26:42] The problem is they need the money to order the parts.

[26:45] It really is like, it's not like a lose, lose situation.

[26:48] It's just a situation that's not ideal.

[26:50] And if you go in on a big Lebowski now,

[26:52] I think they should just stop telling people

[26:54] four to six weeks, you must go in now knowing

[26:57] that it could be a much longer wait.

[26:59] And I still think this game to this day, amazing game,

[27:03] but the code, I mean, how do you get excited

[27:05] about a 12, 5 Lebowski, a 12, 5 Lebowski

[27:09] with the code being where it's at?

[27:11] I mean, for 12, 5, go get it guns and roses,

[27:13] collectives edition when they became available, okay?

[27:15] All right, anything else going on in Pimball?

[27:18] Spooky Pimball machines were shipped and jammed into a truck.

[27:21] You should see this picture.

[27:22] There's a picture on Pimside of Rick and Morty's

[27:25] that were like stacked on top of each other inside a truck.

[27:28] We did, one of them was turned sideways

[27:29] and just jammed into the truck.

[27:31] I think the dude was in, I think Australia,

[27:33] he unboxed his Rick and Morty

[27:35] and the Butter Cabinet was all cracked and there was chips.

[27:38] There is no worse feeling in the world

[27:40] than unboxing a Pimball machine to find damage.

[27:44] That's what sucks is when you see that hole

[27:47] inside the cardboard that feeling in your gut

[27:50] that, ah, chances are something's wrong with this game.

[27:53] And then if something is wrong,

[27:55] you then have to go down that headache road

[27:57] of insurance and blaming the shipping company

[28:00] and did you already sign for it?

[28:02] And if you sign for it, are they gonna help you out?

[28:05] Just a really crazy photo to look at.

[28:07] Anyway, let's end this episode by thanking.

[28:09] We have more people donating to Canadian Spinball Podcast

[28:13] on Patreon.

[28:14] Let's thank David Hanna.

[28:16] David, thank you so much for contributing

[28:18] to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[28:20] Mark B. Walker, Mark, thank you so much.

[28:23] Let's see, I think I thanked David Denholz

[28:26] for contributing.

[28:27] David, thank you so much.

[28:29] And Hector, Hector Castorhong.

[28:31] I think I said that right, Hector.

[28:33] Thank you so much for donating to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[28:35] I really do appreciate everyone you contribute

[28:38] to this show.

[28:38] It really means a lot.

[28:41] you can always paypal a Canadian donation

[28:44] to enter ENDRKOOLURIS at Gmail.

[28:52] That is my PayPal account.

[28:54] We accept donations in multiple forums, ladies and gentlemen.

[28:57] I'm sorry, anyway, this has been episode 529.

[29:00] Let's see if Led Zeppelin is around the corner.

[29:02] Are we gonna get that teaser that Stern loves

[29:05] to do on a Friday and then reveal the game

[29:07] early the following week?

[29:08] We'll see, we'll see.

[29:09] This could go either way.

[29:10] This could go either way.

[29:11] I could see Zeppelin coming out.

[29:13] Stern has a track record of December releases,

[29:16] but we also know they are extremely backlogged

[29:19] and does it make sense to put another game on the line

[29:22] when they've got tons of adventures

[29:23] and Jurassic Parks and other games to build.

[29:25] So we shall see.

[29:27] It's gonna be fun.

[29:28] And then throw Cactus Canyon into the mix

[29:30] and you realize this fall there's way more games

[29:33] than dollars to go around.

[29:34] Okay?

[29:35] Everyone, talk to you soon.

[29:36] Get it, stop, take your friends,

[29:38] stop, take my friends, talk to me,

[29:41] stop me, or never, ever, ever, ever, ever.

[29:46] Getting back together.
