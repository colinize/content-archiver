[00:00] Go n'ja go n'ja go!

[00:09] Go n'ja go n'ja go!

[00:17] Welcome to Episode 132 of Canadian Pimball Podcasts, your source for weekly Pimball news

[00:28] and interviews with the people who make the Pimball industry so amazing and we're going to

[00:34] continue our streak of incredible interviews and I am also just really thrilled to talk

[00:40] to this individual on Episode 132.

[00:44] It's no other than Jared from Stern Pimball.

[00:48] You all know Jared.

[00:49] Jared was a hyper fan on Pinside for a long time.

[00:53] He's sort of like the world's greatest geek and he's like into everything I'm into.

[00:59] He's into everything like most nerds are into.

[01:02] Everything from Ninja Turtles to Transformers to Pimball to Star Wars to movies to cars.

[01:10] But he's not just into these things.

[01:12] He understands the power of social media and the power of getting your word out there

[01:19] using all the different channels and mediums that are available.

[01:22] He's got lots of really cool clients.

[01:24] I see him on Facebook every day.

[01:26] He's telling me I'm going to go get some free hooters soon.

[01:29] He's sharing with me great Facebook live videos from car meetups.

[01:34] He got the Dallas Cowboys to give him the stadium to have Nerf battles in.

[01:39] Who can do that?

[01:42] Jared.

[01:43] And Jared, you know, I consider him a personal friend and I think he's really a very valuable

[01:49] member of the Pimball world and I'll explain why.

[01:53] Because a lot of what drives people crazy in Pimball is the distance between the hobbyist

[02:00] and the manufacturers, right?

[02:02] And a lot of the die hard hobbyists, they're on Pinside and they're arguing amongst each

[02:07] other every day.

[02:08] They're talking about Pimball and they care a lot about Pimball and they don't normally

[02:14] get enough information from the manufacturers to satiate the volume of conversation these

[02:21] guys want to have around Pimball, right?

[02:23] These guys want to talk like every minute, every hour about Pimball.

[02:27] And Stern, you know, Stern is an old Pimball company.

[02:31] They've been around for decades.

[02:33] They've been around before the internet.

[02:36] And so as we move into the 21st century and social media is blowing up and more and

[02:43] more companies are realizing the power to use social media not only to energize their

[02:49] fan bases but to sell new products to tell the stories of their brand.

[02:56] It's great that Stern has partnered with Jared.

[02:58] Now he's been on board for a little over a couple years and you know, it's a work in progress.

[03:03] Everybody knows this.

[03:04] Like, it's hard to figure out how to market Pimball to Pimball fanatics, right?

[03:11] Because on one level, the die hard people, they almost will buy anything.

[03:16] The way they just need new Pimball.

[03:18] You know, Pimball to them is like, it's like a drug and they need their next fix.

[03:23] But there's also a huge Pimball player and collector and hobbyist world out there that

[03:28] isn't on Pinside, right?

[03:30] That people who, more people don't know about Star Wars Pimball than do know about Star

[03:36] Wars Pimball, right?

[03:38] A lot of people will find out about Star Wars Pimball for the first time right now.

[03:44] They'll see it on IGN.

[03:45] They'll see it on Facebook when Stern promotes it out into the world.

[03:51] And those people will be excited and they're not, they haven't been waiting for it for months,

[03:57] even years like Pimball fanatics wait.

[04:01] And Jared's going to help Stern move into an era where transparency and learning about

[04:08] the games and learning about the people behind the games, you know, only adds to the excitement

[04:13] of Pimball and only adds to the desire to own these products.

[04:18] And on this podcast in particular too, I've had the pleasure of talking to George Gomez,

[04:23] Christopher Franchi, Zambi Yeti, Jersey Jack.

[04:28] And when we talk to the people who are behind the games, I really do think it gives a lot

[04:32] of you out there more insight into what went into making the game.

[04:38] And it also puts a lot of people's minds at ease because when you hear the story behind

[04:43] a game, you often let go of a lot of the speculation and rumors and whatnot.

[04:48] And you'll listen to our conversation and you'll hear me ask Jared to sort of, to continue

[04:55] to open up a little bit of the story behind the Stern games and let us in a little bit

[05:00] more because I think the more we know, the further her enjoyment goes with these games.

[05:06] And I think that the interview I did with the Jack is testament to that.

[05:10] I'm, I, I, look, this podcast, I don't advertise it, I don't promote it, I don't have any

[05:16] sponsored anything.

[05:18] Over 1700 people have listened to the interview with Jersey Jack.

[05:23] Now that, that's an incredible number for me.

[05:26] I mean, it's almost like a 70% increase in people listening to Jack talk about his company,

[05:32] about dialed in.

[05:33] And so this is a great medium to tell the story of these companies and these products and

[05:40] these brands.

[05:41] And I hope that more people from Stern join the show.

[05:44] I'm glad that Jared came on and keeping my Jared is, he is a client of Sterns, right?

[05:50] He's not a Stern employee.

[05:52] So there's only so much he could tell me.

[05:55] And you know, I ask him some of the tough questions.

[05:59] But you know, look, I appreciate him coming on.

[06:02] And I think for those of you out there who have felt sort of burned by some of Stern's

[06:07] social media approaches, if you've been banned by Stern's Facebook page for saying nasty

[06:11] stuff, all you got to do is go to Jared and work something out.

[06:16] I mean, Stern is a company that cares and they care a lot.

[06:20] And we hear this all the time.

[06:22] Stern doesn't care.

[06:23] Stern's doing this.

[06:24] Stern's doing that.

[06:25] I know Stern cares.

[06:26] All right, Stern might make marketing moves that upset certain people and we talk about

[06:31] that, you know, polling items out of limited edition machines.

[06:35] But they care and decision Stern makes.

[06:39] Those are decisions that, you know, I don't always agree with all of them.

[06:42] I don't.

[06:43] But what I will say is this, Stern gets pinball machines out.

[06:48] Whenever I put money on a Stern machine, Stern has delivered.

[06:53] Stern gives us, all right, on a frequent basis, three to four incredible pinball machines

[06:59] a year based on some of the most incredible properties and licenses out there.

[07:05] And they're going to keep going.

[07:07] They have never burned anyone.

[07:09] They've never sort of taken your money and never got you a game.

[07:12] If we look at the pinball hobby around Stern, it's kind of a disaster.

[07:17] There's just a couple other manufacturers out there that have sort of got it together.

[07:23] But everyone else, the highways, the duchess, all this other sort of floundering and people

[07:28] losing money and people hating the hobby.

[07:31] Man, you've got to look at the full picture and appreciate what Stern pinball does do for

[07:38] pinball because imagine just one thing.

[07:40] If Stern pinball went away tomorrow, where would we be?

[07:43] There would be no Canadian pinball podcasts.

[07:46] There really would be no pinside conversation going on.

[07:48] I mean, how long could you talk about Fun House before you want to blow your head off, right?

[07:52] So Stern is the future of pinball.

[07:55] Stern is shepherding the competition with them.

[07:58] As long as there's a Stern, there will be a Jersey Jack.

[08:01] As long as there's a Stern, there will be a spooky.

[08:02] There will be opportunities for others to come in and find the white space.

[08:07] But I just don't think anyone's ever going to even come close to being at the size of

[08:12] Stern and producing games at that volume and even be able to get that many great licenses

[08:19] going out.

[08:20] So it's a great time to be in it.

[08:21] And I'm excited to air this interview with Jarrett.

[08:24] And we look forward to playing Star Wars.

[08:27] I know a lot of you guys, like we've got a lot of opinions.

[08:30] And look, personally, I'm still not sold on Star Wars.

[08:35] I'm still not sold.

[08:36] I don't know if I see the Star Wars universe that I wanted to underclass.

[08:40] I have Star Wars ordered.

[08:43] I'm going to go in on it.

[08:44] And I hope it plays.

[08:45] And I hope it's as fun as it should be considering the theme and how much expectations we have

[08:52] around it.

[08:53] So look, not everything Stern does is amazing, but Stern will keep doing it.

[08:57] And that's life.

[08:58] And you have a decision to buy it or not buy it.

[09:02] But I just am very thankful that Stern is around because they give us that opportunity

[09:06] to make those decisions.

[09:08] Everyone else out there for the most part has made those decisions very stressful, very

[09:13] anxious, very frustrating.

[09:15] But Stern, they're going to deliver.

[09:16] And you're going to listen.

[09:17] We say this, Star Wars Ellie will probably be in people's homes in July.

[09:22] That's incredible.

[09:24] In July, Ellie's are going to be shipping.

[09:26] So that's awesome.

[09:27] Without further ado, let me give you Jarrett from Stern.

[09:31] All right, ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome to Canadian pinball podcast.

[09:36] A very, very special guest, someone again from within the walls of the world's biggest

[09:43] pinball manufacturer.

[09:45] But not just that.

[09:46] This man does epic things all the time.

[09:48] He brings Barbie Chew Sauce back to...

[09:52] What was it?

[09:54] It wasn't...

[09:55] What brand was it?

[09:56] It was Chick-fil-A.

[09:57] Chick-fil-A.

[09:58] He brought it back.

[09:59] He got the Dallas Cowboys to give him the stadium to do Nerf battles in.

[10:06] He's...

[10:07] They had the Ninja Turtles vanilla ice at his birthday party, no other than Jarrett

[10:12] from Stern.

[10:13] Everyone knows your name, Jarrett.

[10:14] So you want to welcome you to his pinball podcast.

[10:17] Thank you very much, honor to be on the show.

[10:19] Is this my first time on the show?

[10:21] This is your first time on Canadian pinball podcast.

[10:25] Well, you've come a long way.

[10:27] I know.

[10:28] I've actually...

[10:29] I broke a record a week ago.

[10:30] We'll talk a little bit about George Jack.

[10:32] But his podcast has actually gotten, I think, almost 1700 listens, which is amazing.

[10:40] He's past George Gomez.

[10:41] We have to get George back on one day soon to...

[10:43] So that's really...

[10:44] That's your most listened to episode so far?

[10:47] It is.

[10:48] And I think it hit it in an interesting time because Dildin is ready to ship.

[10:52] So we'll talk about the competition.

[10:54] But Jarrett, what I want to talk about on this episode is pinball in general.

[11:00] Because you're roll it, Stern.

[11:03] And marketing and how marketing applies to pinball.

[11:07] And I think it's a really interesting topic.

[11:10] Oh, yeah.

[11:11] It's so interesting.

[11:12] And I love...

[11:13] I'm a marketing nerd.

[11:15] So I get into it.

[11:16] I love the ideas of it.

[11:17] I pay attention to billboards.

[11:20] I love to watch commercials and check out the pre-rolls and stuff on YouTube because

[11:25] I just geek out on how all the different marketing people around the planet try to

[11:30] come up with ideas to get people to buy stuff.

[11:32] I think it's interesting.

[11:33] Right.

[11:34] And let's start there too, right?

[11:36] So Jarrett, you are like...

[11:39] You're like a hype man.

[11:40] I follow you on Facebook.

[11:41] We talk all the time.

[11:43] You're working for Hooters.

[11:44] You're working for all these other companies where you help drum up excitement for products

[11:49] and brands.

[11:50] And you're...

[11:51] You're like me on crack.

[11:54] You love toys.

[11:56] You love cars.

[11:57] But you don't just love these things.

[11:59] You then broadcast your passion for these things across social media.

[12:04] And let's talk about social media and its relationship to Pimball.

[12:08] Let's start there because I know you're deep in both worlds.

[12:11] And those two worlds are like worlds apart when you think about Pimball and using social

[12:16] media to get people excited about Pimball.

[12:19] Yeah.

[12:20] It's...

[12:21] You know, when you take a...

[12:22] I don't know.

[12:23] The stereotypical cross section of a...

[12:26] Of a Pimball player.

[12:28] They don't always line up with the stereotypical cross section of the avid social media user.

[12:34] So there's obviously some overlap.

[12:37] But when I came into this two and a half years ago, the vast majority of any discussion

[12:46] and ideas and planning around Pimball related anything seemed to happen on forums or deep

[12:52] in the thresholds of some hidden Facebook group.

[12:57] And in the last 24 months, especially, and not just from Stern and from everybody, you've

[13:02] seen a whole lot more social media presence and a whole lot more embracement of a variety

[13:08] of social media channels from YouTube to Instagram to whatever.

[13:13] And it's just really interesting to see now how integrated something like Facebook is

[13:18] for all the Pimball manufacturers.

[13:21] And of course, Stern, we're always looking to lead the way.

[13:25] So we broke that they realized that this is an opportunity that we need to dedicate resources

[13:32] to.

[13:33] And there wasn't a lot of people on site that could dedicate the time needed for such

[13:41] a big project.

[13:42] So they reached out to see if I'd be the guy.

[13:45] And I'm the guy.

[13:46] And I'm still the guy.

[13:47] I see people post online sometimes like, where's Jared?

[13:50] Where did he go?

[13:51] Is he even...

[13:52] Does he work for Stern anymore?

[13:54] At least as of the time of this podcast.

[13:56] Right.

[13:57] I'm still with the company.

[13:59] You're still in.

[14:00] Okay, so talk to me about what it's like taking a company like Stern who works in an

[14:09] industry that developed and flourished well before social media.

[14:14] And what it was like chipping away and getting them to understand the value and the power

[14:21] of using social media.

[14:24] And when you came into the role, did you assess how they were using it and are like, guys,

[14:31] I know the big thing that people always talk about is, I said something negative and I

[14:36] got kicked off a Facebook on Stern's page and it's like, that's not social media guys.

[14:40] You've got to be able to go on the New York Jets page and be like, the Jets suck this

[14:43] week.

[14:44] But you can't get fans out.

[14:45] So what was it like?

[14:47] Well, you know, so you said me getting them to recognize the value.

[14:53] I want to be clear to say that I think they've always recognized the value.

[14:56] I think they've always realized the value and the power of it.

[15:01] I think the realization was that we don't have time to dedicate to this with the current

[15:08] manpower.

[15:09] We need to bring someone in to sort of wrap their hands around it and see what they

[15:17] can do with it.

[15:18] So, and it has been slow and steady because Stern has been around a long time.

[15:25] There's only what, who Shelley Sacks and I'm trying to think there's a couple that will

[15:31] kill me for not remembering.

[15:32] But there's a handful.

[15:34] And I mean a handful of people who have been with the company since 1986 and everyone

[15:38] else has come later, including some of the, what we call like the executive management.

[15:47] Everyone has come on at different times.

[15:48] So, you know, Gary and his team that he's assembled and people have come and gone over

[15:54] the years, they've, they have their way of doing things and they've figured out how to,

[15:58] you know, make pinball machines and make them, make them great.

[16:01] And of everybody who's ever made pinball machines, they're, they were the last one standing for

[16:06] a long time.

[16:07] So, but with that said, they always want to embrace, you know, the latest and greatest

[16:11] new stuff and push forward.

[16:14] And so, they're not shaying away from social media, but, but to touch on your point about,

[16:18] you know, banning people for saying something negative.

[16:22] You know, I think that, I think that, you know, in the past we have been heavy handed.

[16:26] And I think that, you know, you have seen some people that just got, you know, instruments.

[16:31] But, you know, from the outside looking in, I thought, wow, how short-sighted, you know,

[16:36] they, uh, maybe they shouldn't do that.

[16:37] But once I get in the other side of the curtain, I'm looking and seeing, well, some of that

[16:41] was because, um, when you don't ban someone who's problematic, now you need to engage

[16:46] with that person.

[16:47] You need to respond to them.

[16:48] You know, you need to spend some time and energy.

[16:50] And like we, like we said, we established that there wasn't the resources for that.

[16:53] So me coming in was supposed to fill that role.

[16:56] That's, that's my role is to maybe not instaband somebody, but instead to, um, see what their

[17:02] criticism is or see what, or, or see what's going on and respond.

[17:06] And I will say that when somebody has a criticism or, um, something that they need to

[17:11] bring up, but they want to talk about, that does not earn them an instant ban on our Facebook

[17:15] today.

[17:17] Um, however, if someone's coming on, they're being absolutely nasty or unprofessional,

[17:21] or just going straight up rated R or cussing or just, just being slanderous, then yeah,

[17:27] then there's just not a place for that on our social media channel.

[17:30] You know, so it's like there's a, there's a right way to bring up negativity.

[17:35] There's a right way to ask for things.

[17:36] And, and when those people do it, the right way, hey, they, they will, they, they will

[17:40] remain access.

[17:41] All right.

[17:42] But I'll, uh, let me also say too, if people ask politely to come back, if they've been

[17:46] removed for whatever reason, uh, we've reinstated plenty of people, they just need to ask,

[17:51] all right.

[17:52] Well, there, there you go, listener, if you, if you're one of those people who are banned,

[17:58] hit up Jared and say, you know what, I'm going to behave a little bit better.

[18:00] And I think, look, I think they're to your point, right?

[18:04] And I used to work at a social media agency and we used to do community management, which,

[18:09] when I started a few years ago, we had a rule that we had to respond to every comment

[18:14] within 10 minutes.

[18:16] And it was like, it was kind of like slave labor a little bit.

[18:18] We, you know, we're just like always tied to it.

[18:21] And, and we did manage pages for like the New York Jets.

[18:25] And we, we managed certain, certain pages have really passionate communities and pinball

[18:30] is one of them.

[18:31] You know, I'd also manage the page for like cheesets.

[18:34] And we never really got a lot of, you know, anger.

[18:37] I like cheesets.

[18:38] Yeah, there was never a lot of anger coming on there.

[18:41] But I think, you know, let's, we're going to talk about how the forums and how people can like overreact.

[18:50] And let's, let's start in the present day, right?

[18:53] Because I'm curious to talk about Star Wars rollout.

[18:57] And I know everybody is as we, we can't talk about pinball marketing without talking about the most current

[19:01] and probably the biggest release in Stern's history.

[19:04] And I know Star Wars marketing is probably challenging for you to, Jared, because there's just a lot

[19:09] people don't know about what it's like to work with a big license like Disney.

[19:14] Absolutely right.

[19:15] Um, what, what has it been like rolling out Star Wars and sort of as much as you can tell us?

[19:21] Right.

[19:21] Um, so, so, you know, of course, you know, going into this, you have to understand there's only so much I can say.

[19:28] You know, there's only so much that I can say or that is professional to, to even bring up.

[19:33] Um, but I do read comments.

[19:34] In fact, it's my job to read them.

[19:36] So, um, I can't say if anyone else at Stern reads every comment like I do.

[19:40] I know that there's plenty of people in the company who will look in on comments here or there or whatever the case is.

[19:45] It's time a lot.

[19:46] But for me, specifically, one of my roles literally is to keep up with everything.

[19:51] So, um, whomever in Chicago might call me and ask for a status update or, you know,

[19:57] hey, what's the pulse?

[19:58] What's, what do you feel?

[19:59] And you know, is there anything that stuck out?

[20:01] So, I'm the median, you know, I'm the, I'm the buffer in between a big part of the pinball community and, uh, and senior management.

[20:11] So, um, with that said, I read a lot of comments, you know, of course, uh, so much negativity about they should have done this.

[20:19] Why didn't they do this?

[20:20] Oh, they, they really missed an opportunity with this.

[20:23] And, you know, man, the people, the people in the marketing department at Stern, uh, they're not stupid.

[20:31] And, uh, there's some, there's some great, great talent there that's got a laundry list on LinkedIn that would just blow you away with the,

[20:38] the project they've worked on, the things that they've done.

[20:40] Um, when you see something that maybe isn't like you'd imagine it would be or it's not like how you think it should be.

[20:47] It's a more reasonable explanation to assume that maybe we couldn't, um, or weren't allowed to or, um, wasn't as easy to do it that way.

[20:57] Um, there are several versions of, uh, rolling out the game that had been passed along that I saw that were kicked around and stuff and, um, at the end of the day, what ended up happening was, uh, what happened.

[21:12] So, you know, we, we, we, a lot like a designer, you know, in their first stage of presenting a game, might present a version that the public never sees because of the bill of materials or whatever the cases.

[21:25] Um, they have to, you know, rearrange things, take things out, you know, move things around in the game or whatever.

[21:30] It's the same thing with marketing. You know, we might have a, you know, here's our phase one original idea with all the glitter and gold and polish on it.

[21:39] And you're like, ta-da, here's our idea. And then we have to, we have to send that off most of the time to California, some office in California, depending who we're working with.

[21:47] And then it comes back and, you know, sometimes it's this way and sometimes it's that way. But, um,

[21:53] you know, I've, I've, I've tried to be so careful here. I don't want to, I want to get in trouble with anything because, uh, you know, all of our partners are so valuable.

[22:03] Obviously, so valuable. And we know you guys want, you know, look, it's, I think people realize, and when they saw it with even when we, when Game of Thrones came out in HBO and Disney and there's, there's, there's definitely different license or is that, you know, they're very protective over their IPs for, and those are always.

[22:22] The big IPs, you know, it's course, you know, no one really cares what you do. And there's, and there's, there's not really much of a bigger IP than Star Wars.

[22:32] No, there, there's only a handful. If there was a, a list of IPs, Star Wars would be at the very front of the line of the, of the, of the, a list of IPs. It's one of the hottest IPs on the planet or in history.

[22:47] Period. You know, so, let me, so obviously it's, it's a big deal. And as much red tape, as you can imagine, there is all of that and more.

[22:57] Right. Let me ask you a question, sort of slash suggestion. So a lot of the conversation, right? A lot of the, a lot of the, a lot of the conversation, obviously, with how Star Wars was released, started with the artwork.

[23:11] Right. And I know it is probably frustrating to be like, oh, great. We've got low res artwork as the first introduction and everyone's like scrutinizing it, saying it's not hand drawn and it is hand drawn, but you can't see it close enough.

[23:25] When, when we talked to Christopher Franci on this show, he really give a lot of valuable and awesome information and awesome stories.

[23:34] Just about the creation of the Batman 66 game, right? And, and I think transparency sometimes, right? To a, to a, to an extent, do you think there would be a time where we would be able to hear from, from the individuals at

[23:50] or maybe Greg, you know, Greg Ferris, maybe I'm trying to get Steve on. I'd love to get Greg on this show. But tell in the story of what it was working with Lucas and with Disney on creating the art package.

[24:04] You know, those sometimes just hearing it like this, this is what we had to work with. I don't think people are going to be like, what? Like you shouldn't have done Star Wars then like it's Star Wars.

[24:13] You know, I think I think that's definitely a conversation that'll happen, but it's going to happen at like, you know, a fireside chat at XBOX 2019.

[24:24] Right. You know what I'm saying? It's not it's not the kind of conversation that anyone inside the company is going to be ready or willing to have when we're still right in the middle of the rollout when the games haven't even shipped a customer's yet. You know, right.

[24:37] Right now is the very tip top of the hype train for Star Wars. It's all about Star Wars right now.

[24:43] So, you know, peeling back the curtain on the creative process on some decisions and stuff, but you know, before anyone's even seen the game in public.

[24:52] I just I couldn't foresee anything that happened like that this year, but I do think there's there, of course, will be a time and a day.

[24:58] You know, sort of like, you know, I saw at the Texas Pimball Festival this year.

[25:02] Greg Ferris and Dennis Norman telling like every possible secret and looking cranny about making their all a viral game.

[25:09] Right. Right.

[25:09] You know, so when enough time passes, these, you know, designers will be pulling out the Polaroids and the cell phone pictures and, you know, telling what they talked around, you know, this night and that night in the every single little detail will end up coming out.

[25:23] But it's just, you know, when things are still very active and very fresh and very current.

[25:28] I think that sometimes you can, you know, like, and it really just depends on the license or.

[25:33] Right. But we're I think we're kind of dealing with the biggest license or in the world. Right.

[25:38] So it's a really it's a colossal deal, honestly. It's a colossal deal.

[25:43] And and I think too, right, you guys know this better than anyone and you know, there's personally better than anyone that the Pimball fanatic, the the hyper user on Pinside, like these guys, like, they lose their minds, even though they've just ordered four of them. You know, it's like it's it's it's

[26:00] And as a marketing, you know, so if marketing's goal is to sell, what is the feeling of do we even need to bother with these diehards who will buy everything we put out?

[26:15] Yeah, you know, I think there is I don't think that we take any of the cells for granted, you know, so, you know, we have had great luck to to generally sell out of, you know, every limited edition for every game we put out.

[26:31] I can only think of one in the last two years that we didn't completely sell out of, but that's neither here nor there. So I don't think we should ever take the cells for granted. I think that a customer always has a choice of where to spend their money.

[26:45] And you know, every game that we're sellers, we sell were super thankful for that. And the collector community is super important to Stern. It's one of the one of the three legs of the stool that Gary talks about in his and his speeches all the time.

[26:57] And they're the collector community. That's why we have the limited edition machines. And it's something that we embrace to the tune of 400, 600, 800, 1000 units depending on the title. And that's that's a lot of money. You know, it's a big deal. So in 50% of the business. And you guys can believe this or not. But I've seen the boxes and I've talked to the people and 50% of the businesses outside of the United States.

[27:23] And really, it's that accurate. That's accurate. It's like, I mean, it might be 47 or 51 or whatever. But yes, it's, I mean, it's about a percent. If you talk it's shocking, right? But it's true.

[27:34] If you talked to Dutch pinball these days, whether 51% is a big difference from 47% of ownership. No, I digress. But so have them do go overseas. Right. So this really this no

[27:47] kind of Canada Canada also counts. So if it not overseas, some of them will go north of the border. But yeah, outside the United States. Okay, absolutely. So the

[27:57] the game is we're so it is accurate that when an limited edition comes out that half of them will go outside of the United States.

[28:05] Approximately. Okay. Yes. No, it's good. It helps me if I want to flip a game on eBed to be like, there's only going to be 400 in America.

[28:12] Yeah. So yeah. So for example, in the case of Star Wars, there's 800 units. You could pretty well guess that about 400 of them are not in the United States. You know, they'll be, they'll be, you know, they'll have different, different regulators in the back of them and

[28:28] different, they'll come with different plugs. It's just, it's just cool. It's cool. The demand and, you know, pinball is growing all over the place. But it's growing in places like Norway and Finland and

[28:41] Switzerland and Germany and Australia, especially Australia. But there's there's a there's just all this great growth going on all over the place. But we're so lucky in the United States because we still have access to the use games. Right.

[28:56] So, you know, from a collector's point of view, you know, we could still find great Craigslist deals or, you know, dealer deals or deals with friends and stuff. We can go to shows and buy games for, you know, cash money and bring them home.

[29:10] Man, some of these guys in Australia are different foreign countries. The games are gone because what happened is nobody wanted them for a few years there in the early 2000s. And they were boxing them up in crates shipping crates and shipping them back here for flat rate by the boat low back to the United States. So there's a ton of games here that have like, you know, French coin doors or whatever on them. And we took all their games. So it's really expensive to love pinball outside the United States. But despite that, they still love it anyways.

[29:40] Oh, yeah, my friends in Australia pay a fortune and and those guys are crazy to say they know exactly how many Star Wars Ali's are coming.

[29:48] Australians are a little crazy. Yeah. But that's why we love them. They're great. The Australian people have you. I mean, seriously, honest. Have you ever met an Australian person that wasn't a blast to hang out with?

[29:58] Never.

[29:59] Not every time. They're all not every every time. There really are. Whether it's good in your by the beach. I mean, what's that? What's the angry about?

[30:07] Let's talk a little bit about Star Wars marketing and some of the questions I've been reading on the form, right? Just for the listener of the show.

[30:14] Oh, so let's talk about when we talk about the collectors and giving people the limited edition. Then there's a lot of people that are just like

[30:23] Stern's yanking stuff out of the Ellie and, you know, and and charging a little bit more and their like stuff like that. There's no real mirrored back glass. Like it was in Aerosmith. Now it's office star wars.

[30:34] And then it's there's no shaker motor. They have the new non reflective glass. It's not included like. Yeah. You know, how do you guys juggle that balancing act between staying profitable, but giving people the value and because the price of these games are getting pretty high.

[30:52] And people's expectations of what will come in those packages is aligned with with the cost of these machines. Now, so what are your thoughts? Do you feel like the

[31:02] Well, I think you're too much out or well, in this case, I could only give thoughts because you know, I have to sort of remind the listener that I'm a contractor, you know, happily working for Stern now for more than two years, but I'm not on site. I'm not in Chicago. I'm not in the office.

[31:20] I'm not seven days a week nonstop like everyone else is, you know, I'm, you know, Stern is in my collection of clients that I deal with. But but so putting on that hat.

[31:32] There's only so much information I have access to. So I'm a little bit unique in the Stern in the company, because I still get to look at it from the outside like you guys sometimes too.

[31:43] But literally because I'm in Dallas, Texas.

[31:46] So so everyone else's Stern is in Chicago inside the building every day. So they have a lot more of an intimate understanding. So I think the question that you just asked me is a lot more of a George Gomez type of question. So

[31:58] so in terms of me answering it, you'd have to go almost into more theoretical territory. Sure. So but so let me just say like I get it. I understand that, you know, when you look at a game like Star Trek LE that had a laser in the apron and LEDs in the laser cut armor and a mirrored back glass and lights in the head.

[32:22] And it just was just ridiculous, you know, then you almost think, well, okay, so that's what an LE is, right, it has all this stuff. But then the next LE might be totally different.

[32:32] Or you know, in my might or might not have this feature might or might not have this feature on Ghostbusters, Ellie.

[32:39] It had side armor, but then later we sold a laser cut side armor as an upgrade.

[32:44] So, you know, one of the things you saw this well, why not just give it, why not just give it to us? Why not just put that, put the accessory armor on their stock, you know, because you're already putting armor on there, why don't you just put the cool armor in there. So I read all that. And I have to admit that even I don't really understand the process of why this game might have a shaker and why this one won't and why this one has a mirrored back glass and why this one doesn't. Here's what I do know for sure.

[33:11] You know, pinball died on account of several major manufacturers in the 90s and nearly stern, nearly stern, but not quite not enough.

[33:25] And it's because it wasn't profitable.

[33:28] You know, so this is the big part that everyone forgets about. No one really wants to talk about is that like pinball was on the absolute brink of death and maybe extinction.

[33:39] And Gary stuck around and trudged it out and, you know, basically clawed and clawed and we got all the way to this point and at some point, you know, smart people who understand business and understand everything look at everything and say, OK, well, how can we make a fantastic product that we can make an X amount of time for X amount of money that we could profit X amount of money on.

[34:04] So we can build this company and most importantly, keep it around forever so we can keep pinball live forever. So does that mean that for the sake of pinball going on forever, Star Wars doesn't have a mirrored back glass. I don't know. I really, I don't know. I can't, I can't answer that question.

[34:23] It's a tough one. You know, I will say that, you know, I think that the LE game should be the coolest one. And I think they'll all the designers agree with that too. That's why they, you know, they try to put the best of this or the best of this or the best start working everything. But then when you put the game out in public, somebody might say, well, I like the premium artwork better.

[34:45] Well, that back glass is better than this back glass. Well, so they quickly made the decision on the limited edition of Star Wars and say, well, hey, we'll give you all three.

[34:54] So, hey, whichever one you like pop it in. Right. You know, so that's kind of a, you know, that's kind of a cool move. I dig that. But you know, I don't, I don't know a lot about the mechanics of the decision of why because honestly, what our next came out, whatever it is, it may or may not have those features that you talked about.

[35:13] Right. And I just don't know enough about the process to really comment officially on it. I'm sorry. Right. Well, yeah. And look, at the end of the day, there is a point to or it is what it is. You know, like here's the LE, do you want it or do you not? And people want it. I mean, I've been hearing stories that it is almost impossible to get a Star Wars LE at the current time. We all know that the distributor list were, were very, very deep.

[35:43] That if you tried to get one a week ago, good luck. Um, and I don't think, you know, a lot of people, it's funny because I'm sorry a lot of people will be like, oh, I'm bailing on the LE go and premium. They're, they're not. I keep asking my distributors. And I'm with a lot of them. I'm like, some people might drop off. But for the most part, right.

[36:03] A lot of the big distributors, you know, they've got list 50, 60 people long for an LE and they're like, yeah, one guy got off the list. But I've got 40 people wanting on.

[36:11] Kind of somebody says that they're off. There's somebody not on the forum that you'll, that you don't know who their screen name is or who they're at and they're in.

[36:19] Right. And you know, don't underestimate, you know, the power of this IP and it's, you know, it's a global popularity.

[36:28] There's a lot of people out there that this will be their very first Pimbal machine they have ever bought.

[36:33] And it's going to be a limited edition and they'll never post pictures of it on Facebook and they'll never share pictures of it on a forum.

[36:39] And it'll go in a house that you'll never walk into and see. And there it is. There's one of the 800 in the world is gone. You know, so

[36:47] these games, you know, I did hear that. I did hear some feedback, you know, out of Chicago about sales and they said they're very, very happy with the way things are going.

[36:57] It's been a great week. A lot of phone calls, a lot of great things going on. So in terms of the, in terms of the sales, you know, you know, you read what you read, but the games doing great.

[37:10] Right.

[37:11] Games being great. And what are the, what's the ultimate barometer of the success of a game other than how many are we selling?

[37:17] Right.

[37:18] Why they're the challenge to from, you know, when we look and then you do this and I do this and we, you look at it through the lens of the consumer, right?

[37:26] You look at it to the lens of the enthusiasts. And that's what makes you successful at social media is you have to do that. Like you help companies understand how consumers are feeling and thinking.

[37:36] And that's, that's what social media does. It creates a bridge between companies and Stern cares.

[37:41] You know, and you'll hear this. Oh, Stern doesn't care. They don't care. They are, they're not, hey, Stern cares. They, they care. It's just it's a big ship.

[37:49] There's a lot of people on board. A lot of people.

[37:52] No, and even when everyone says, let's turn the ship. It might take a while, you know, because it's such a big deal going on. But man, I, I know the powers that be, I know them personally.

[38:02] And they really do care. So for anyone listening who's wondering like, do they care not man, we do. And I do. I personally care about all these.

[38:09] The last couple of weeks I've just been laughing because on, on the forums, I'd always hear like Stern doesn't care.

[38:16] Andrew highway, he cares about us. He communicates to us every week. At its like, Stern gets your game in your living room. Stern picks up the phone. If you have a problem, there is never, I've never, you know, you always hear those guys who like run to the form. If they have like a switch out and they go nuts. And they're like, it's Sunday and Stern's not gotten back. It's, everyone gets taken care of everyone.

[38:38] We have a hotline. Right.

[38:40] We have a hotline and we've had the same number since the 1990s. How cool is that?

[38:44] No, it's, you look, I, when my hundred kickers, when my Lord, the rings out in Ellie, when it went down, you guys got me like a new board of a game that came out in 2008. It was

[38:54] and Chaz are amazing. And if you guys ever go on the Stern Pimball factory tour or you're in town in Chicago and you email tours at Stern Pimball.com to to set up a tour time, which by the way is something you can do.

[39:09] Stop by poke your head in the Chaz in Pat section, if the let you and look at their laboratory. And it is absolutely incredible. They've got the old data East diagnostic machines.

[39:20] They've got the old Sega diet, not some machines, the white star stuff. They've got pieces of boards and springs. And what they'll do is inside their little lab.

[39:28] They'll recreate problems that are being described to them over the phone or over email. And they'll, they'll basically reengineer things. It's just, it's remarkable what, what they do.

[39:38] And man, they will talk to anyone. You can call these guys about a problem with your Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

[39:44] And they won't be like, sorry, games are longer supported. They'll literally they'll spend time and help you out. And and we pay for that. We know, you know, Stern's committed to providing that to the community and has been for decades.

[39:56] You know, so you can't you can't say Stern doesn't care. You know, when they keep two people online, you know, two people employed full time to just answer any old phone call and any email from any person.

[40:10] It's it's huge. It's it's huge.

[40:13] And so have you guys done market research, Jared, in terms of how many of your buyers are on Pinside and how many are in.

[40:22] Yeah, we know the numbers. Is it? I'm assuming more or not on the forum.

[40:30] I don't know how active. I don't know.

[40:32] Because I feel like whenever I'm at people at shows and collectors like, yeah, it's like a lot of I'm always surprised because when you are on the forum so much, you just assume the whole world's on it, right?

[40:41] And you go to shows and you know, I've sold a couple games on eBay and guys will come up and they're like, I don't even know what Pinside is. Some guy who bought my Batman from me is like, I don't know what code is.

[40:51] Yeah, it's the game. For

[40:53] Yeah, it's on you know, there's, there's you know, 60 or 70 or 80% of the people who I just went 30% but

[41:01] let's say I'll hold a lot of people who touch a pinball game. Just think the point of the game is to keep the ball from going down the hole.

[41:08] Right. That's it. There's no code. There's no multi ball. There's no wizard bow. There's no multipliers. There's just keep the ball from going down the whole the end. That is all pinball is to

[41:19] millions of people. Okay. So, so we got a long way to go. And so when you go all the way to something like Pinside, which is like the the crime delo crème

[41:28] of hardcore pinball people. These are people who literally want to read what other people are doing with pinball and see pictures in here stories and and and spend hours and hours of their day just a

[41:40] mercs in the world of pinball. So these are like your super super super fans. And and I think I don't know how many robins got now is it 28 or 30,000 registered members. I mean, I'm sure they might need more. But yeah, it's not that they're active. But that's yeah.

[41:55] Well, and that's so that's the real question, you know, and so you got to say, here's the total amount of people who are registered. And then that's one number. Then how many people are active like active lurkers, active readers. And then you how many are active posters. And then you go all the way down to how many people post daily. And when you get all the way down to that, how many people make post daily. We're talking about in the hundreds. Right. You know, I'm saying. And now in terms of lurkers readers. You know, there are there are certainly thousands. But in the

[42:25] terms of, you know, pinball enthusiasts like worldwide, there are tens of thousands. There are tens of thousands. And in terms of players, there are hundreds of thousands, if not even millions. So so pin sight is.

[42:37] It's an interesting thing because it is no doubt the largest collection of pinball fanatics on the internet in one place. Right. But it couldn't be again to be. All of them or half of them. You know what I'm saying. It's just a process. It's a vocal.

[42:54] A very vocal cross section. Right. And knowing knowing that to be true. And stern has, you know, upwards of more than 90% of the pinball market. And is not really actively on pin side. Talk to me about the future of stern and pin side. You see stern coming back on in any capacity.

[43:15] Then the back on is a too much work to answer all these guys all the time. It would be a full type job. You know, I thought about that, you know, because, you know, a young, a younger.

[43:28] Jared, two and a half years ago, I came into stern from being a very active pin side member. So I was someone who, you know, averaged somewhere between 15 and 30 post a day.

[43:39] So I would have been in the top 100 or top 150 of active members on pin side. But today, there's a lot of members who don't even remember me or know who I am because, you know, you disappear for a couple of years and people sort of forget or move on.

[43:55] But I believed in it and it was something I wanted to embrace. And when I came in and I sort of brought that to table and like, hey guys, we need to, you know, let's be on pin side. They're like, whoa, hold your horses.

[44:05] There's been a couple of rodeos you haven't rode in yet, partner. Let us talk to you, you know, and when you hear about the years and years of experience and all the different things that have happened and stories that happen well before I have ever even bought my first pinball machine, you start to understand some of the position.

[44:23] And then it really kind of boiled down to one question is like, what do we have to lose? What do we have to gain? You know, like, you know, does it, does it move the needle? So, you know, ultimately, we decided to focus more on our own social media channels to really focus on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter.

[44:46] And to, you know, to be graded those and to put a lot of information out there as much as we can and to commit to new things like live videos and tours and different cool stuff like that.

[44:56] And really just sort of, you know, leave pin side alone, you know, right. So that's not to say that I don't still read it as a guest. I do log in and read strictly as a guest.

[45:08] But my main account, my Jared account has long since been deactivated and you could go there now and verify it's been deactivated. So I'm not like logging in secretly and still, you know, sending messages.

[45:19] It's completely deactivated. It's done. And I've had lunch and breakfast with Robin and his brother.

[45:26] The nicest guys, nicest guys. And I know that you met him in Texas too, right. So when they came here, they got together. They stayed right down the street from my house. So of course, we got together.

[45:39] And we had a lot of conversation, you know, a lot of conversation. And I believe that they are trying their best to provide a great pinball community.

[45:47] But when you have so many different people from so many different parts of the world with so many different opinions and it's hard. It's a full time job. So in terms of like stern interacting with pin side and like, you know, having like a duly appointed forum representative.

[46:03] Right.

[46:04] That may or may happen. But couldn't you imagine that such a thing existed? It would be almost a full time job.

[46:10] No, it definitely would be. And I don't I think it's it's an it's an it would be just an uphill battle for them to deal with the kinds of hyper users on there that just would be relentless in in in poking them. Right.

[46:27] So that's the thing. It's because when you're at the top, you know, you're just going to take insult after insult. And I saw like this week with I have to bring it up. So like when Steve Richie says pin side is a cancer.

[46:38] And so there's obviously some he said that. Yeah, there's something like that. Like I think on Facebook or really? Yeah. And look at the fish up. Yeah, yeah, it's been passed around and people have been discussing it on there. And it's one of those things where like there are definitely cancerous people on pin side. And we know who they are.

[47:01] And they are. And it's you know, it's unfortunate that the entire community gets labeled by a very vocal minority. And I think that's what Steve was reacting to. Look, he's you know, the guy's working on the game for two years and you know, pin side pulls it apart on on low res images. And I can understand, you know, I mean, he's very passionate about his product.

[47:23] And Stern's positioning, you know, the other the other example that always came to mind is when Gary was really trying to help people out with when there was some ghost busters issues and people go on there.

[47:33] And not even give Gary time to help. And he's getting like slandered or Gary would help them. And then and then they'd come on a come online a week later and throw them under the bus or say something else.

[47:46] Right. Terrible or or angry. Yeah, you know, I guess, you know, and and just to touch on what Steve Richie said, you know, he's a legend. Steve Steve Richie's paid his dues.

[48:00] And he's done the entire planet a favor for working on the games that he's worked on and doing the things he's done, whether we're talking about Mortal Kombat or Atari or you know, Williams and just all the different stuff he's done. He's amazing.

[48:15] But I think saying, Pennside is a cancer. I think a maybe a more accurate statement would be to say, you know, there are some elements of Pennside that are cancerous. Right. You know, it's not it's not.

[48:30] I don't think it's accurate to label an entire community as one thing or the other. It's a little more like society, you know, like people are mostly good. But there's a couple of bad dudes.

[48:42] You know, and so and so you get some of that. But but he's you know, he's free to have his opinion. You know, I think just because you work for Stern or any pinball manufacturer doesn't mean you should not get to have opinions. But, you know, obviously, nobody wants to, you know, you don't want to make anyone upset about anything. But, but to kind of come around, you know, in terms of the low res images.

[49:03] You know, all I can say to that is that we put out the high resolution images as soon as we were able. Right. That's all I can say about him. Yeah, no, like it's the thing to is, I always say this. Pennside is like a little bit of a pressure cooker environment where like you are saying the majority of the hyper users. They post not just hourly like every minute. Like I don't even understand like how that's an exaggeration.

[49:28] Yeah, every 60 times, 60 times an hour. Well, look, there's some the hyper users. You look at the total number of posts and it's like 35,000. And it's okay. So then you start to do the math. And it's like these guys are literally at work though, or doing what they do for a living and they're refreshing pages and threads every.

[49:47] They love it. Yeah, it's what is their hobby. They're into it, man. So there's not like I'm like I have to be on there to get my show. You're the, I mean, you're you're so into it that you created a podcast so you can talk about it even when you're not playing it.

[50:02] I think you like talking about pinball morning like playing it. Of course. I don't see it's you know, because it's free to do this. I have to go spend money and I got a broken magic girl. Like I don't even have a pinball machine that works in my home.

[50:16] Well, look, it's it's it's a topic that you know, like I always say this. There's not always enough new news every day to satiate the amount of conversation these people want to have. So then the conversation rumors, rumors speculation. And then it also becomes it's it's like it's more about like personality versus personality with the members on there. Right. So half of the threads are just these two guys have been fighting for 10 years on the inside and they both come into the Star Wars thread.

[50:45] And are going to tell each other how they feel about not just the game, but each other. And that that's a lot of what you know, it's like it's like it's like it's like that on their forum speaking of pinside.

[50:55] You're still permaband from that website, right? Yeah, I actually had a lot of back and forth with Robin in email this week that I.

[51:02] Oh, this is yeah. Well, here's a thing and things looking good. No, like you basically said you're we're never lifting the ban and and like never never say never.

[51:13] Robin, you know better than I told them on the Rob and we got we went back and forth and it pretty it got pretty like I got pretty angry because I said to him.

[51:23] Well, look, I said look, Robin, you asked me eight months ago to turn to turn the corner to make my podcast more positive, right to stop the personal attacks.

[51:32] And I did exactly that. I mean that this podcast has done a 180. I've had great guests on here like George Gomez, Christopher Franchi, zombie Yeti, Jersey Jack.

[51:41] The list goes on and on and on and I think this podcast is really added a lot of value to the pinball world because we're chronicling.

[51:49] I would agree with that. Yeah, it's and I've changed. I mean, I you know, I've stopped all that personal attacks. I've stopped the pinside baby stuff. I've stopped all that.

[51:57] And so you got mad and you buried yourself. Well, no, so what happened was this? I said look, I said look, I said I can't get more positive and I can't add more value than I am.

[52:10] Then I've currently been showing you over the last eight months. Right. And I've done what you said. It's almost like when you tell a prisoner.

[52:18] If you want to be paroled, here's what you need to do. And you do it and you go before the parole board and they're like rejected.

[52:27] At some point, you just get fed up with being told, did you lose your temper?

[52:35] Well, what I did was this. I said, look, I just think it's I think he's being unfair allowing it's just it's not even robbing it and it's it's a few of the moderators that just won't let me and they say this.

[52:47] We don't want to deal with the drama. I'm like fine. If and I tell him if I came back on pinside, I wouldn't be like stirring up drama on pinside.

[52:57] I lit the main reasons I want to be back on are simple. I want to be back on to be able to communicate to individuals and have more guests come on the show.

[53:05] Because a lot of people all I know are their avatars. I don't know who they are. I can't go invite them. I also just, you know, sometimes I think look, even if it doesn't let me back on.

[53:17] I'm just a middle ground that they just still won't do. You can't even mention my name on there. You can't wait. So that's my question is.

[53:25] So is this podcast going to be linked on pinside where they can listen to it? No, like you people. So wordy. So wordy or 17,000 listens come from right. Isn't that incredible? Right. So we had 17,000 players listening to them.

[53:37] So when I find so here's here's here's what I'm proud of when I got banned from pinside. I thought oh my god, like no one's going to be able to know who's going to really listen to my show because there won't be a discussion happening on pinside.

[53:52] Yeah, honestly, I think it's all word of mouth that my whole podcast I don't I don't even I have like a Facebook page. I don't even update. I don't promote it anywhere. I don't have t shirts. I don't even have a website.

[54:07] And take out full page ads and pinball pinball. I've done that before. Right. I've done ads at different shows. Yeah. But for the. Just to be just to be funny. Well, you know, it is in the world of marketing. And I believe this is like if you create something of value, people will come.

[54:21] And I think people enjoy this podcast for a few reasons. It's timely. I mean, I do too many probably. It gives you the news when you want it. And, and you know, we're honest, you know, and we have good interviews with great guest. And half of those great guests have been members from the Stern family. And and my little begging of you, Jared is like, let's get more great Stern people on because I think this will see we can do. You know, I can't. You know, man, I'm not I'm not in a position.

[54:50] Now or and you know, maybe in the future, I don't know, but I'm not in the position to direct or dictate that people are available for the show or not. It's sort of, you know, it be really, you know, let me tell you something else. I learned that is a little bit of behind the curtain sort of secret that you may not know. Be aware of sort of interesting. So you know how like some pinball shows will have a designer or an artist or someone from Stern there. And I think that's what I'm going to do.

[55:19] And some of them will even have like many of them. And then some shows have none of them. So you might think that like Stern wanted George Gomez and Steve Richie and John Trudeau, whoever to go to this show, but not to the show, whatever. The truth is, Stern completely stays out of that. And those show organizers reach out personally to those designers or those artists or those programmers, or whoever. And they independently make arrangements to get them down to the show or whatever.

[55:47] It's completely on their own. So like when John Trudeau or George Gomez or John Borg or Dwight Sullivan, whoever is like at a pinball show, it's because the organizer of that show reached out, accommodated them, made it happen.

[56:01] Yeah.

[56:02] You know, whatever the case is, however they negotiate, it's so Stern's not saying you can or cannot go to the show. These guys just go to the show.

[56:10] So with that said, you know, not doing media interviews is a little different. They go into a show. But these guys will go to the show and then do a panel. They'll talk for an hour.

[56:22] And isn't this just really sort of a version of the same thing?

[56:27] Definitely definitely.

[56:28] But I would suspect that anyone at Stern before they went on any major podcast would have to get some sort of at least verbal approval or something before they would go.

[56:37] Right. Well, and I think the reason why I like talking to George and and zombie Eddie and the different individuals at Stern is, you know, people listen to the past interviews and they realize, you know, they all go well. There's never been.

[56:51] There's never been like a bad interview. No one's ever like walked off set or taken the mic off. I mean like, can you know, how could you ask me that?

[56:59] They've always been good. And but look, it's pinball here. It's pinball we're talking about. You know, I think I think people need to remember that. And I think the listener needs to remember that too is that, you know, we're talking about pinball here.

[57:12] This is something that was originally designed for, you know, teenagers and young adults, you know, to, you know, go out and hang out at the arcade on a Friday night and and have fun and play around. It's always been about fun.

[57:28] It's always been about entertainment. It's always been about that sort of escape. So, you know, when you start taking it so seriously that it's like getting under your skin or keeping you up at night or making you sincerely angry.

[57:41] Man, and I don't care if it's from this forum or this Facebook page or whatever, like you got to, you got to take a step back because pinball is not supposed to be a negative thing.

[57:50] It's never was never supposed to be about nasty stuff. But unfortunately, man, a lot of people have lost a lot of money. And I'm not talking, I'm not talking about us. I'm, you know, just just been some negative stuff that has happened for a variety of reasons for, you know, whatever the case is.

[58:07] And so people are upset and people people are on edge and there is a whole drama element. It's so funny because you and I like we're in the pinball world. So we get it in the listener listening. They're probably in the pinball world too. So they get it. But guys in the world outside of this bubble that we're in. People don't even know what the heck's going on.

[58:27] I know. Like they don't even know what a plunger is or where the start button is or any of this. So you think that they're going to believe you when you say, and there's amazing drama that you wouldn't believe this what happened with this buyout and this merger and this and these investors like they'd be like, what are you talking about?

[58:44] Exactly.

[58:45] Yeah. Go tell someone that man once in 1988. I don't know what you're talking about.

[58:51] I know. Go tell someone like highway pinballs being trying to be refinanced and like, who's highway pinball? I think that's what makes most of the drama though and you're right. And I think it's also, you know, if you're over at Stern and you're within the Stern company walls, you know, Stern is never not ship someone a game they paid for.

[59:09] And the main drama, the main pain source that is infiltrated pinball has occurred over the last like five to six years and it's the rise of the boutique company, right?

[59:21] I want to talk a little bit about Stern's sort of feelings about all these other companies.

[59:27] Crowdfunded pinball.

[59:28] Right. Who have really sort of, I believe, tried to come out in these like blaze of glory ways and say like we're going to make the best pinball machine and we have no understanding of how to make pinball but but F Stern, they're not doing it right.

[59:44] Here's our game. Here's our game. Here's our game and year after year after year, we watched these companies fail.

[59:50] We watched their games struggle to launch and we watch buyers and consumers lose their love of fair with pinball, which then hurts Stern.

[59:59] So like, what are your feelings about what the boutique hobby, the boutique manufacturers have done to the pinball collecting world?

[01:00:06] I think it, I mean, listen to what you just said. boutique pinball manufacturer. I think the fact that there really is such a thing as that and there's many of them.

[01:00:16] I think that just speaks to the excitement and the momentum and the massive resurgence of pinball popularity that's going on right now.

[01:00:26] And I like to think that Stern is right in the middle of that. We're right in the middle of that.

[01:00:31] And not all of it, but a lot of that momentum and that excitement has been because of the games that have come out of Stern or because of different moves that they've made or I think that competitive pinball is massive.

[01:00:43] And you might have seen a teaser even just today about the Stern Pimball Pro Circuit.

[01:00:49] And there's cool things on the horizon with competitive pinball, guys like Robert Gagnow have given us like so much exposure for pinball.

[01:00:59] So, you know, the competitive side of it and the development of really complex and deep and satisfying code that games for the 90s couldn't even imagine.

[01:01:09] There's been a lot of things that have been pushing pinball forward and out of that rises on parallel demand that even exceeds the demand for our three titles a year to where now there's even there's even room for people to say, hey, let's start a pinball company.

[01:01:26] And I think that's interesting. It's remarkable even that such a thing's even possible.

[01:01:32] But somebody said what pinball pinball is hard, right?

[01:01:36] And it is. It is. It even even for Stern, it is.

[01:01:42] And we have it. We have our stuff together. Obviously the best.

[01:01:49] So if anyone else is starting up or buying their first factory or you know grabbing an order of 10,000 nuts and 40,000 bulbs or whatever, man, that's.

[01:02:02] That's got to be crazy. And you know, I don't want anybody just like you for the reason you said, I don't want anyone making a pinball machine to fail.

[01:02:13] I don't think that anyone inside the Stern organization wishes that and you might think, well, how could you not, but no, really, we don't wish anyone to fail because.

[01:02:23] Because a loss of one pinball manufacturer sort of has a ripple effect that could go all the way up to us. So you're so you're absolutely right that you know it is bad for pinball.

[01:02:35] It's bad for pinball when someone takes millions of dollars out of the marketplace or sucks the enthusiasm or the momentum or the love of pinball out of people.

[01:02:45] And we've seen, you know, I've seen people that said, I'm out. I'm cash and out. I'm done. I'm selling all my games. This isn't worth it.

[01:02:53] You know, they took a, you know, $6,000 hit on the chin or $8,000 hit on the chin. Some people, $15,000 hit on the chin. They said, I am done.

[01:03:02] And they're gone. And they're gone, man. Now thankfully pinball is growing faster than it's going backwards. But still I, I regret that. I regret that those, that those people and we weren't responsible for that. But just as a pinball enthusiast, I regret that that's the reality for some people that they had to learn the lesson trying to support someone who had the best of intentions.

[01:03:24] Do you think people have learned the lesson of pre-ordering before a company has proven they can do it?

[01:03:30] Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I mean, you hear a couple of times that, okay, guys, we really learned our lesson this time. It's done. We're never going, we're never following Kevin, another Kevin Kool-Aik.

[01:03:41] And there's just been two or three or four games now that have been announced or come out since then that absolutely people have put money down on.

[01:03:52] And you know, it's sort of like, it's one of those things where like your parents tell you better and then you just go out and do it anyways. And you're like, my parents were right, I should've listened to them.

[01:04:02] You know, sometimes you just got to learn the lesson for yourself, I guess. But the pinball lesson man could be a thousand very expensive lessons. So I regret that.

[01:04:13] In terms of in terms of like cadence and you're saying demand is greater than Stern's three major titles a year, I think it is.

[01:04:23] Do you ever wonder like if games have long enough time to to stay in the spotlight? And I talk about this law on the show because I think a lot of my listeners are new unboxed buyers.

[01:04:34] And you know, the guy who buys Batman who's like still waiting for code to mature that guy probably had ghost busters at you know, and by the time ghost busters had all the issues Batman is on.

[01:04:47] And then by the time Batman is even just beginning to ship Aerosmith is announced. And by the time Aerosmith is everyone's really realizing it's a great game.

[01:04:55] Star Wars hype is taken over. You know, it's well imagine if Star Wars was announced on May 4th like everyone wanted to be.

[01:05:02] Right. You know, that would have been a approximately a month ago. And that would have sucked, you know, that would have sucked some well deserved attention and momentum right out from me underneath Aerosmith.

[01:05:15] You know, and an Aerosmith is a game that should have been out earlier. But due to some some logistic reasons some other things in the factory on the production of the game ended up getting pushback.

[01:05:28] So, you know, the game plan when we lay it out on paper, it all looks great, right. But then like I told you, pinball's hard. So then we lay out this perfect game plan.

[01:05:38] But then reality comes. And this doesn't work out right or maybe this has a little error or we have to send this back or we're waiting on this piece or these parts or whatever the case is and you know life happens.

[01:05:49] And now things aren't like we planned. And so they have to sort of adjust and and and go to plan B or call an audible and just sort of, you know, go with the flow. And it and then you finally, you put yourself in a position where, you know, hey, if we don't make adjustments to this plan,

[01:06:06] Aerosmith is only going to have, you know, a 60 day, 65 day rollout before Star Wars hits. Well, that's that's not fair because Aerosmith is a great game.

[01:06:18] It's a great it's a great game. Seriously, I ask anyone who plays it, they'll tell you it's a lot of fun. It's great. It shocks people and looking at it you say, well, that lay out similar to this. But then you play and you're like, well,

[01:06:29] it's amazing. It's completely different. So the last thing you want to do is cast a gigantic shadow over a game that's not even out in the spotlight yet.

[01:06:40] So they try to make that and they're aware of that. They know that that's that's a part of the reason not the only reason, but part of the reason why Star Wars has come out when it when it did.

[01:06:50] So, you know, these games all do need time to shine. They all deserve time to shine. But they try to basically more or less plus or minus block it out every four months.

[01:07:03] What's interesting, you know, when a trying compare a nut like video games to pinball or video games, lot like the movie industry, like we know what's coming out years and events.

[01:07:17] And even if things shift, like if Grant, like Grant of the auto, we know it's coming out. We know red deads coming out.

[01:07:24] Video game companies will also allow people to see like the development process as they get with, you know, within a year of launch and they start to invite media to see.

[01:07:36] Pinball is like a tightly kept secret until right before launch. And it's just a completely different way. I think you know why I mean it's the hype. It's like people's like it's because it's because it's all that hype windows so tightly.

[01:07:52] I think it's because a console game is $60. I think that you know a console buyer is saying, hey, I'm going to buy this and this and this and they have a collection of dozens or hundreds of games.

[01:08:04] And I think that when you're talking about a six or eight or a $9,000 purchase, people plan those out and they may only make one year or one every two or three years or sometimes once in a lifetime.

[01:08:17] You know, so you know people plan those out and you know if you had the luxury of knowing the next six titles we're going to make.

[01:08:26] Right. Then you can lay all the cards down on the table and say, well, out of these six titles, I'm potentially interested in three, but this one I got to have on the biggest fan of that one.

[01:08:37] And when you only have X amount of money to allocate to whichever game, you might end up deciding, hey, okay, I'm going to wait for game four. So I just saw the next six, but game four, that seems the coolest to me because I've got all their albums or I've got all I've got every blue ray and box set of that on the biggest fan.

[01:08:55] So you say, I'm a wait for it. Well, we know since it's four games away that it's not going to be out for another 16 months.

[01:09:02] So you say, okay, that's my next game. Well, over the next 16 months, the AC goes out in your house, your engine breaks on your car.

[01:09:10] You get catastrophic hell damage on your roof. There's a foundation leak. There's an unexpected whatever. Guess what your Pim all money just went somewhere else.

[01:09:19] So life happens. And then now by the time game four comes out, your situation, shadows you haven't never buy it. You know, we had a saying back in the car business. And that's where I really got my teeth in the marketing as I was managing the marketing department of the nation's largest niece on dealership nation worlds.

[01:09:37] The United States largest niece on dealership. And we said the best time to buy cars today. And if you can't sell them a car today, sell them a car tomorrow.

[01:09:48] Every day to days the day today's a day. So so and Gary, you know, you could hear Gary will tell you this, you know, what's your favorite game, Gary, whatever we're selling right now.

[01:09:57] I admire that in him because I think that is the correct for for a businessman. That is the correct mentality to have is hey, we're whatever we're making. That's what we're selling.

[01:10:10] And I guess the actually the auto industry is actually much more of a good comparison to Pim ball because just like the auto world, like they don't tell us what hot next sports cars coming out until right before it's ready to go because to your point, like they don't want people buying today's car feeling they have regret they should await it for the next model, even though we know it's coming right everyone.

[01:10:33] See Star Wars they know and there's rumored titles of what's next in the lineup, whether it's guardians or this or that they they know the rumors like they may or may not yeah, they may or may not come out, but everyone's aware that turns not going to stop at this game.

[01:10:50] This isn't going to be. There's lots of other game, you know, three and a half months, your only ever four months away from the next title.

[01:10:58] So talk to me about Star Wars when it's when stuff's actually shipping so yeah, so what I what I've heard most recent numbers I've heard these are direct from, you know, emails and information that's readily available.

[01:11:11] I think that.

[01:11:13] L. E's will be shipping sometime in July.

[01:11:18] So I think I think you'll start seeing the first games and I'm not sure what order it's going to be if they're doing L. E's first and then pros and then premiums.

[01:11:25] I know they always do premiums last.

[01:11:28] But I have a client here in Dallas, really cool barcade called cidercade and you still with me I can't hear you.

[01:11:38] Okay, so cidercade they have 20 20 pens on the floor and God bless them for operating at many games and they said, hey, do we need to get the new Star Wars?

[01:11:48] I said, yeah, you said, I think you should that like will she get pro premium or L. E. I so you should probably just get a pro, you know, because people are going to beat on it and whatever.

[01:11:56] It's like, well, doesn't the premium have more features? I said, yeah, yeah, it does. But I mean, but people are coming here to drink alcohol and just, you know, walk around, have a good time.

[01:12:05] It's fine. It's plenty of game. And they're like, which one gets to us first? And so they call the distributor here in Dallas and the distributor said, well, if actually of all the three you'll get an L. E. first.

[01:12:15] If you get a L. E. sometime in the early to the middle part of July and they said, well, we want the game first. So we'll just pay the difference.

[01:12:22] And for that reason alone that they can get the game in July and not maybe August or September, that's why they bought the L. E.

[01:12:29] But that was hilarious that they were dedicated to get the difference in price is nothing to them because they're they're all about having the latest and greatest.

[01:12:39] And let me tell you if you think a stern games expensive, you should check out a game from Ralph Reels.

[01:12:44] How much are they're well, well, I don't know and I'm not throwing shade on them because I love those guys. In fact, they're good friends.

[01:12:51] But you know, I think a cruise in blast is what like $15,000 or $20,000 or something. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe you know, maybe maybe I had to double check that it's a ton, a ton of money.

[01:13:01] I mean, I had to I have a guitar here arcade in my garage. And I was just looking at parts just out of curiosity and the replacement guitar, one of the two guitars direct from their parts companies like $780.

[01:13:14] Oh my God. Little possible. I could buy a PlayStation 3 with guitar hero three with two guitars and a 60 inch LCD 4K plasma TV for less than that.

[01:13:23] Oh my God. Yeah, I had a pipe dream because I was so excited when I saw they're bringing back Daytona USA, the the singer. Yeah, I was like, I'm going to buy these.

[01:13:33] And then they're like, they're probably like eight grand each, like maybe 10 grand each. And like, you can't just buy one. You need to lease like two or four.

[01:13:41] And the reason they cost so much money is because they pay for themselves. Oh yeah. You know, so they're not meant to be in your living room. I think a store was I think a store was battle pod.

[01:13:51] I don't know if you ever saw those at David Busters or something. But I think a store was battle pod is like either 25 or 28,000. Yeah, they're 30. They're around 30 grand. Right. Exactly. Exactly. So, you know, and it was funny because at an auction somewhere in the 60 years in the future, someone will be trying to get 800 bucks for it.

[01:14:07] Well, I just my friend just got one. He paid 16,000 for it. And you know, it's funny too because like these guys who buy them for their homes, they they plummet in value because to your point, those things are designed to just sit in a big restaurant or bar and just people pump, you know, David Buster is just constantly people pumping in like two dollars a play, three dollars a play.

[01:14:31] I just I just got go squad today. I don't know if you know remember go squad is one of the one of the first games to have like a full size rifle light gun. And it has like the coil inside of it that rattles your whole body when you're shaking it's like to do to do to do.

[01:14:44] You know, and this game must have been 10 or 15,000 dollars when it was new. And this bowling alley owner here in town says listen, I want this game out. And if someone doesn't come pick it up by Friday, it's going in the dumpster.

[01:14:58] And the games fully functional fully functions good for just but it's just big. It takes up a lot of space and he doesn't care. So he would rather throw it away.

[01:15:06] Then do something with because throwing it away is faster and easier. So I had to go and you know, do a rescue mission to to say the sarcage today. But that's you know, just just to turn it back around. I think we got a little bit.

[01:15:17] What were we talking about? Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean my our listeners are like wait, they're talking about our case in game room stuff now. We're sorry.

[01:15:24] So let's bring back the pinball. So in terms of cadence. When so Star Wars Ellie shipping sometime July, then we'll follow with premiums probably like August September.

[01:15:36] Is it is stern planning to go next title at expo mean expo is usually the time when stern does start to pull the curtain off of the next title.

[01:15:47] Yeah, you know, I haven't I'll be honest with you. I don't know if we just we just hadn't got around to talking about that yet or whatever. So I'm not sure. I'm not sure the exact timeline. You know, and I've got it's gotten to the point now where.

[01:16:00] You know, I I just sort of take any timelines with a grain of salt because there hasn't been a title yet that hasn't switched something than what we originally said. So thank goodness all these conversations happen.

[01:16:12] You know, privately. So when something switches only us and me and six other people or 10 other people know about it. Right. You know, I'm saying so that's another reason. That's another reason why we shouldn't publish our titles two years in advance because we'd be like, you know, summer of 2019. Get ready for blah blah blah. And then summer 19 comes and we're like, whoops.

[01:16:33] No, so it's safer to not say anything until we're ready. That way we're always on time.

[01:16:38] What let's talk about. I know I told you I was going to bring this up. So I was at I was at expo last year.

[01:16:45] Yep. And Jared's epic party.

[01:16:48] Let's talk a little about like when you're trying to sort of like what stern sort of marketing strategy around expo right because expo has a show. And I think

[01:16:58] it's like sure was not Jared epic party that was stern epic party. Stern's epic. Yes. I feel like you own the word epic. You should like trade market though. Like whenever I would like to word.

[01:17:09] So stern had the epic party. Yeah. Expo is as a show. And it's been going like south for a while. Right. And people have been saying I didn't say I'm not saying I'm saying it. I'm saying it. And it's not just me saying it. But like the thing is this is like Chicago is like Stern's hometown.

[01:17:26] Yeah. You know, do we see Stern like why does he started just do a show? Why don't they just do a show? Like why don't they just like knock it out the park.

[01:17:35] They could even like I guess like the only thing is like we still want to see what other manufacturers have have going on. But I think it's your point.

[01:17:43] It would even benefits. Turn to have everyone just show what's going on. But Stern hosted right. I mean you 90% of the market plus we could have pro tickets premium tickets and then I would like to limited edition ticket.

[01:17:55] We could. No, I just know. And you know, I think expo, you know, expo has been around for what is it 30 years now?

[01:18:04] You know, it's it's it's. I've only been following for like three a long time, a long time. You know, and you know, those guys who put on the show, you know, Mike Mike pay sack and and his partner.

[01:18:17] You know, they're good guys are pinball guys. So I don't think that Stern is in a position that we want to, you know, take over anything.

[01:18:27] So I think expo needs to be expo and they're going to continue doing their thing and and we'll continue to participate as far as I know now. But let me also say just completely separate.

[01:18:37] It's completely possible that in the town of Chicago in the in the in the pinball city that Stern, the world's largest manufacturer of arcade quality pinball machines decides one day to do their own two day or three day event.

[01:18:53] That's in a similar style to other pinball events that you see and no one love around the country. Right. But it would not be in place of or instead of expo to my knowledge.

[01:19:04] Gotcha. And nor and nor will I say that those plans are necessarily seriously being considered or thought out. I'm just simply saying that it would make sense for the world's largest pinball manufacturer to maybe also host the world's largest pinball convention.

[01:19:19] Yeah, it seems to you know, it seems to make sense. I'll give you some advice though and suggestions. Now if they do a party, if you throw party for yourself, go ahead. Don't make people pay for the drinks.

[01:19:30] And don't make people pay to get in. It's your birthday party. And what else I want to say have pinball there. Would you pull people from a football show to come to party and there's not many machines.

[01:19:45] There's a few. I mean, but come on. There could be right down the listen. There's a hundred games right down the street. If you wanted to play a hundred games, you stay at the hotel. Why are you going to come to a party and keep playing pinball down the street from where we are just.

[01:19:58] People who go to these these conventions, Jared. I mean, yeah, well, maybe we need to you know, get them socializing like, Hey, guys, listen, look, it's a musician. You should you can stop and listen to him for a few hours without refreshing your phones and looking at the latest threat. You know, I mean, absolutely. I think Viper alley was great. That venue was cool. We had a lot of fun there. Ernie Hudson was was wonderful. Zombie. He's wonderful. Ed Robertson. Of course, great friend. Wonderful. I'm happy with that event. And the way I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it

[01:20:28] in a way that went that it went down. But you know, in terms of, you know, you know, hey, you know, Stern, pay for more stuff. You know, that's something that we hear all the time, right? But I don't. I don't. I don't. Be a Gary. Buy me a beer. Buy me a beer and put a shaker motor my machine. But you know, I, I. I hear you criticism. I don't want to just, you know, put our fingers in areas and say we were perfect. And anyone thinks otherwise is wrong. That's not true. We definitely could have done a lot. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I

[01:20:58] remember every소�te time. I didn't tell V pótheer murders because I said, I don't know, we've been to other places, broken tiles, we've been attacked. We've been on a lot of Thanks

[01:21:14] better. I take the critics. I'm seriousness. And should we do a party to that scale or in that nature be for all absolutely

[01:21:24] Yeah, in marketing it's like 35 and 40 are next.

[01:21:27] No one ever does the off the off years.

[01:21:30] Well, let's talk it.

[01:21:32] We talk a little bit about, and this is something we talk about offline is how Jersey

[01:21:37] Jack is good for Stern, right?

[01:21:39] And how competition is important in any category for manufacturers of entertainment to continue

[01:21:47] to up their product, right?

[01:21:49] And Jack came on to the scene and Jack has, you know, long history with Gary and with

[01:21:53] Stern and Jersey Jack has, you know, I think been humbled in the process of making games.

[01:22:00] And I think when Jack came out, it was a lot of like, you know, a lot of people come out

[01:22:05] with that, et cetera, and we're going to do it better.

[01:22:07] And then they realize like actually how hard it is when they go to do it.

[01:22:11] But how much has Jersey Jack had an impact on you in terms of like marketing your games

[01:22:17] and also just Stern continuing to increase the quality of their games and pushing them

[01:22:24] to create those world under glass is that everyone is looking for with these hot, because

[01:22:27] these games are now like, you know, high priced items.

[01:22:31] These are no longer.

[01:22:32] Yeah, yeah, I don't, you know, unfortunately for this question, Chris, you know, I really,

[01:22:38] I think this is more of a George Gomez question again.

[01:22:40] You know, I think that, you know, you know, how has that changed, you know, so much of those

[01:22:45] questions are just so personal in terms of the mechanics of the business and how it's

[01:22:50] arranged and why and, you know, I'm a contractor.

[01:22:54] I only know so much.

[01:22:55] So I can't, I can't say anything other than sort of speaking in hypotheticals because

[01:23:01] I'm just guessing.

[01:23:02] So, but what I will say, and I guess if there's a way to say that this is just personally speaking,

[01:23:10] I do think Jack being around is good for Pimble.

[01:23:14] And he's always been very kind to me in public, you know, he knows who I am.

[01:23:19] And I've seen seen or run into Jacket Texas in a Chicago and in New England and a bunch

[01:23:25] of different places that run into him.

[01:23:27] He's always been very professional, very kind.

[01:23:29] So I've got no problem, no problem at all with him.

[01:23:34] No, no, so whatever anyone else has, I don't know, I can't speak to that, you know, but

[01:23:39] I think that more Pimble is good for Pimble.

[01:23:42] The more people who actually announce a game, build a game and ship a game, that's good

[01:23:48] for Pimble because, you know, the word Pimble is not something that Stern gets to own.

[01:23:54] It's something that we're stewards of and I think we're very proud stewards of that.

[01:24:00] But we don't get to own Pimble.

[01:24:02] Pimble was around even before Stern was.

[01:24:05] So right now we're like the major stewards of it, but we're not the only ones either.

[01:24:10] So whoever takes money from someone and builds a game and ships it and then stands by

[01:24:16] that product, man, that's, they're a part of team Pimble.

[01:24:20] And that's it that we're all sort of whether we like it or not, we are all collectively pushing

[01:24:26] Pimble forward and keeping Pimble alive and making a generation of new players emotionally

[01:24:33] invested into this game so that way it can live on and people, you know, like my daughter

[01:24:38] will grow up and have brand new Pimble machines to play when she's old enough, you know.

[01:24:44] So that's, you know, and I think anyone pushes that forward.

[01:24:47] That's that's that's someone who's cool and I respect that.

[01:24:50] Completely agree.

[01:24:51] Completely agree.

[01:24:52] Yeah, and I completely agree.

[01:24:53] I think all competition is healthy.

[01:24:56] It's good.

[01:24:57] I think more Pimble going out there is good.

[01:24:59] I also think, you know, there's so much room for these collectors to get both company

[01:25:04] games and enjoy them both.

[01:25:06] And look, let's, I mean, just be honest, I mean, the cadence of stern games doesn't stop.

[01:25:12] It's like you guys are well oiled machines.

[01:25:13] They can't stuff.

[01:25:14] They can't stuff.

[01:25:15] No, three, four games a year.

[01:25:16] There's room for both companies to survive and both companies have a different approach.

[01:25:20] Let me throw a marketing sort of question at you.

[01:25:22] What would you do if I, because you're a your man who knows how to control the crowd,

[01:25:27] how to get people hyped, how to get people to buy tickets for nerf battles, how to get barbecue

[01:25:32] sauce back.

[01:25:34] How would you market the current situation at highway Pimble?

[01:25:39] What would you do if the investor said, Jared, you're, you're our guy.

[01:25:44] Help us get people back on board.

[01:25:46] Was that an accent?

[01:25:48] I think it was.

[01:25:49] I'm sort of acting.

[01:25:51] That's my Swedish, my, my combination Swedish and German accent combined.

[01:25:56] I think, man, you know, and that's a, that's a fun question, isn't it?

[01:25:59] But I just, you know, I, I am keeping an eye on what's going on just because it is, that

[01:26:04] was not because of some directive.

[01:26:07] I'm keeping an eye on what's going on just out of pure curiosity of what's going on

[01:26:10] in the world of Pimble.

[01:26:12] And I think it is an interesting and unique situation what's going on.

[01:26:16] But man, you know, I just, I don't want to comment on that actually.

[01:26:20] You know, I, I've all my mental capacity and all my, all my creative juices and, in

[01:26:27] regards to Pimble is all about, you know, bettering the stern brand and pushing the stern

[01:26:32] brand and, you know, making stern Pimble the best.

[01:26:34] So I don't, I still, I'm all out of creative juice when it comes to other Pimble.

[01:26:38] I would, I think it's a great answer because I honestly, if they asked me to help them

[01:26:42] with my marketing skills to turn the ship, I'd be like, I don't want this job.

[01:26:46] So it's a, it's a, it's a fair answer.

[01:26:50] There's a saying, there's a, there's a saying and I like it.

[01:26:53] They said, everyone with a check is not your customer.

[01:26:58] Right.

[01:26:59] You know, Jessica, someone can hire you just so someone could pay you.

[01:27:02] That doesn't mean you should take it, you know, and in terms of contractors, you know,

[01:27:05] my team and I, and there are, there are more than me.

[01:27:08] I have my, my, my business partner, Pedro and my right hand Jessica and either one of

[01:27:13] those two work on the stern account, I handle that exclusively.

[01:27:17] But I have a team and we get approached all the time from, from all spades of business

[01:27:22] that you would imagine.

[01:27:23] And we turn a lot of them down because there's just too much heat or it's just, you know,

[01:27:28] too much bad PR they've done themselves in the whole or, or whatever the case is.

[01:27:32] And you know, in terms of, you know, doing business with people, I'm interested in doing

[01:27:36] business.

[01:27:37] People who are on the up and up who are have a good track record, who are committed to

[01:27:42] customer service.

[01:27:43] And I'm not saying that highway or the new investors aren't.

[01:27:46] I'm just saying that I, I had the luxury of picking and choosing who I work with.

[01:27:50] So I pick, I deliberately pick clients that give me the best odds of being professional.

[01:27:56] So, so, you know, if someone came to me, they're like, hey, we got a little bit of a forest

[01:28:01] fire.

[01:28:02] We're looking for, we're looking for, you know, park rangers and firefighters.

[01:28:05] You know, I'm like, I'm going to stay home.

[01:28:08] Right.

[01:28:09] Well, that's, no, I mean, I mean, that's, that's, that's really in the world of marketing

[01:28:13] too.

[01:28:14] It's a luxury to be able to pick your clients and, yeah.

[01:28:17] And look, it, I work at an in big agencies.

[01:28:20] So a lot of times like, I don't get to pick like it's like, hey, these guys have a $10

[01:28:23] dollar budget.

[01:28:24] You're working on that.

[01:28:25] And I'm like, all right, I mean, like, when am I old agencies?

[01:28:29] We did the PR for, for Russia and Putin.

[01:28:32] And we, I'm like, guys, like, this is like bad.

[01:28:35] Like we should have be helping this guy get pressed.

[01:28:37] We got him on the cover of Time Magazine.

[01:28:39] Well, because, because then he like, you isn't every, well, our agency did that.

[01:28:43] And then when, when he like poisoned all of his, you know, sort of like detractors,

[01:28:50] the agency got dragged into all those stories, being like, these guys are doing PR for the

[01:28:54] devil kind of stuff.

[01:28:55] It's like, yeah, I thought it was like, guys, come on.

[01:28:58] This is like, well, aren't you guys who put their word America on the side of the Budweiser

[01:29:03] camp?

[01:29:04] Well, that was, it wasn't my idea, but yeah, we brought that to market.

[01:29:07] That was awesome.

[01:29:08] I mean, look, that was, hey, let me go golf, golf clap on that one, my friend.

[01:29:12] Yeah, it was great.

[01:29:13] I mean, having an ice-fold glass of America.

[01:29:15] That's a good idea.

[01:29:16] It's drink it up, drink it up.

[01:29:19] Well, Jared, here's the thing.

[01:29:20] I, we're a little over the hour.

[01:29:22] I really appreciate you coming on.

[01:29:24] It's fun though.

[01:29:25] You know, I know that you're, and look, we talk all the time and I know that you're

[01:29:29] in a really interesting situation because when you go from being a fan of a hobby to having

[01:29:35] a position with a company, it changes the game.

[01:29:39] Yeah, of course.

[01:29:40] You've been very professional.

[01:29:41] I think you're very nice.

[01:29:42] I think everyone who's ever met you, I think you are an advocate for pinball.

[01:29:48] An advocate for a stern.

[01:29:50] That customer service goes a really, really long way.

[01:29:54] There's that human connection that I think alleviates a lot of the drama and the angst.

[01:30:00] No one's going to tell Steve Richie to his face like anything negative.

[01:30:04] They're going to shake hands and they're going to thank him for making so many great

[01:30:07] pinball machines over the years.

[01:30:09] I think the more stern can utilize your ability to sort of give transparency and create great

[01:30:18] content for such a fun topic like pinball, the more people are just going to be excited

[01:30:24] about the games, the company and what's coming down the line from stern.

[01:30:28] So we appreciate that you are opening up the organization to.

[01:30:32] I'm trying.

[01:30:33] I'm trying.

[01:30:34] I'm thank you for saying that.

[01:30:36] Thank you for recognizing.

[01:30:38] But I'm not the only one.

[01:30:41] There's a big team.

[01:30:42] There's a lot of people who care about the customers and a lot of people who never get

[01:30:46] credit at all.

[01:30:47] A lot of ladies in the office, a lot of guys that are ordering a lot of guys back in production.

[01:30:53] In the production team, I've been back into that secret door that's off there and where

[01:30:59] they're actually designing the games.

[01:31:01] And there's maybe two or three times more people in there than you'd expect.

[01:31:04] You don't know their first and last names, but they're helping just as much on these games,

[01:31:09] coding dots and making things and just working so hard.

[01:31:13] This one cool thing that I've learned coming into stern from a collector's point of view

[01:31:17] and down into the now being on the business side is that there are hundreds and hundreds

[01:31:23] of people working weekly to make these products.

[01:31:27] And they all really sincerely care about making a great PIMMAL product and making the best

[01:31:33] they can in the circumstances that they're given with the materials that they're given.

[01:31:37] And so some of the negativity stings, but they push on anyways and they push on for

[01:31:43] the greater good.

[01:31:44] I'm so thankful.

[01:31:45] And it sucks to have maybe stepped away from some of my ability to get in there and be

[01:31:53] a super active, visible member of the PIMMAL community.

[01:31:56] But I think I'm helping in a different way now by being in the role that I'm in and

[01:32:01] I'm really proud and happy, of course, to have been given the opportunity I was given

[01:32:05] something that I take really seriously.

[01:32:08] But if I had one wish, it would of course be that we could be even more open and communicate

[01:32:15] even more.

[01:32:16] And I think slowly and surely we're getting there.

[01:32:20] And I think that as time goes on, we'll see more of this kind of thing and not just

[01:32:25] from me, just from everybody.

[01:32:28] And I think I speak for everyone in the stern organization when I say that we're very

[01:32:31] thankful for all of our customers, very sincerely thankful for our customers.

[01:32:36] And we're working to improve in all manners and aspects, whether it's code or game design

[01:32:43] or shipping or communications or everything.

[01:32:48] And so my little piece of that pie is the social media side of it.

[01:32:53] And believe me, they're committed to improving there too.

[01:32:56] And as long as they'll have me, I'll be right here trudging along and working with them.

[01:33:00] So thanks for having me on the show.

[01:33:02] Thank you for giving me an opportunity to talk to everybody.

[01:33:04] And I'm only a Facebook message away.

[01:33:08] So for anyone who's not banned, you can send me a Facebook message.

[01:33:12] And Jared, or you can hit up my personal page is fine.

[01:33:16] Spell out your last name.

[01:33:17] So it's Jared and then your last name.

[01:33:19] So it's G-U-Y-N-E-S.

[01:33:23] I'm very easy to find on Facebook because I actually have a blue check mark next to

[01:33:27] my name.

[01:33:28] Very easy to find.

[01:33:29] Just be careful people though because when you friend Jared, you're going to get content

[01:33:34] times 10.

[01:33:35] Like Jared's going live all the time.

[01:33:37] But it's all good stuff.

[01:33:38] I love having Jared come up in my feed all day long with fun stuff.

[01:33:43] I never know what I'm going to do with it.

[01:33:44] I do do a lot of content.

[01:33:46] I'm a hyper user.

[01:33:47] So I post on average three to six times a day.

[01:33:51] So that's heavy in the Facebook world.

[01:33:54] But I go out of my way to make sure that my content is entertaining or informative or

[01:33:59] engaging or fun.

[01:34:01] And I definitely try to keep away from drama and negativity or anything that's going to.

[01:34:04] Now, try to provide value because when you're lucky enough to take up a little bit of

[01:34:09] somebody's newsfeed on Facebook, that's space that you shouldn't take for granted.

[01:34:12] I think you should provide value with that.

[01:34:15] So I try.

[01:34:16] Well said.

[01:34:17] Well, ladies and gentlemen, Jared from Stern improving and getting the word out about

[01:34:23] their, not even the word improving, but helping us sort of see more and learn more about

[01:34:27] Stern through social media.

[01:34:29] I know Jared's really excited about what the future has has in store with Stern.

[01:34:34] And I don't know what the future titles are as much as I talk to Jared all the time.

[01:34:38] He won't tell me.

[01:34:39] So I dream at night about what they could be.

[01:34:42] But maybe something.

[01:34:44] I know that you're excited.

[01:34:45] I know that the future for Stern looks really exciting.

[01:34:48] And you can just keep telling me, Jared's like, you haven't seen anything yet.

[01:34:50] And like, that's all he has to tell me.

[01:34:52] For me to be like, oh man, like, but I'm not going to say that whatever's next is going

[01:34:57] to be even better.

[01:34:58] You just wait.

[01:34:59] I know I'm like, well, I mean on Star Wars, I sent my deposits in today for graduation

[01:35:05] say, Ellie's.

[01:35:06] Thank you.

[01:35:07] Well, two, why did you get to?

[01:35:09] How do you keep one to keep one to keep one for me?

[01:35:12] The deal was one for me, one for my brother.

[01:35:14] I'm saying if he wants it or not.

[01:35:17] And we'll see.

[01:35:18] Maybe I'll flip one.

[01:35:19] Maybe a wall.

[01:35:20] We'll see.

[01:35:22] I mean, Kelly might actually need you to pick one of them to pick you up.

[01:35:24] Are you on the iconic charts?

[01:35:26] I mean, I had to pick one, I had to go back on the boards.

[01:35:30] I think you know, dancer like a king.

[01:35:34] And if they the reporters are not going to answer.

[01:35:38] So I think he's going to hang out with So it's really fun.

[01:35:42] Hey.

[01:35:43] Who I'd enjoy.

[01:35:44] I never had one.

[01:35:46] I never had a hot boo.

[01:35:47] But my friends and the crew told me that the free expector came out like I did just

[01:35:51] everyone's comfortable talking in front of a microphone.

[01:35:54] Not everyone's comfortable building questions.

[01:35:56] And some people, they'll talk your ear off,

[01:35:59] off camera and you're like, okay,

[01:36:01] and what's your statement.

[01:36:02] And you go live and they see the red dot

[01:36:04] and the men they turn into a deer and headlights.

[01:36:06] So as much as I'd love to be like interview everybody,

[01:36:09] I don't think everybody is interviewable

[01:36:12] because just some people just don't have that tempo.

[01:36:15] That's why I'm gonna leave it to you

[01:36:18] to help me find some of those people.

[01:36:19] All right, well here's the,

[01:36:21] we'll, we'll say good night.

[01:36:24] We'll say Jared, thank you and we'll say everyone,

[01:36:28] you're gonna get the play star wars soon, settle down.

[01:36:31] Play it.

[01:36:32] Keep on flipping and remember to always stay tuned.

[01:36:35] Oh, okay, all right, well Jared, have a great night.

[01:36:38] Thank you again for being a guest of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[01:36:41] Okay, thanks man, I appreciate it.

[01:36:42] All right, bye bye.

[01:36:44] Go ninja, go ninja, go.

[01:36:46] Go ninja, go ninja, go.
