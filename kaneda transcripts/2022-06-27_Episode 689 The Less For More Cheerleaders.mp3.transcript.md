[00:00] What else should I be? All about a jazzer. What else should I say? Everyone is gay.

[00:15] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast that is not going to raise

[00:25] its prices this year. Everybody, I'm back from France, I'm back from Paris, I'm happy to have

[00:31] the microphone in front of me and to talk to you about pinball. Let's get right to it.

[00:37] So here's the thing. I had a week off. I had a week to reflect on everything that's been

[00:41] happening in pinball. And there's been a lot happening. We had a lot of expectations around

[00:46] Toy Story. We've been waiting for companies to get games out the door like Cactus Canyon,

[00:51] Weird Owl, Fathom, where's the new game from American Pinball? Is Dutch Pinball going to

[00:56] get the EA owners their games? There's a lot happening in pinball and there's a lot of

[01:01] expectations and there's a lot of stuff we're looking forward to. And then we get a game.

[01:05] So I want to talk a little bit again about my feelings about Toy Story after processing

[01:10] it even more. And I haven't played the game yet and I'm going to play the game. So this

[01:14] is not a review. This is not a review of how the game shoots. It's not a review of how much

[01:18] fun the game is. This is just my feelings on what I'm seeing in the pinball community as of late.

[01:24] And then I want to go around the horn and let's talk about what else is going on in pinball.

[01:27] And I think you're going to enjoy this episode 689 of Canada's Pinball Podcast. And thank you,

[01:32] each and every one of you, for sticking with me. I lost a few subscribers. We're still holding

[01:37] really strong at 521. So I'm glad I'm back in the saddle. Let me start out by asking one question.

[01:43] And this is one question I have for John at Jack Bar. It's one question I have for Zach Many.

[01:48] This is a question for everyone out there who is sort of supporting and justifying Toy Story

[01:54] because it's fun. The one question I have for everybody and it's not just those two gentlemen.

[01:58] It's for all of us. How many of you out there want to pay more money and get less for your money?

[02:06] That is all that comes down to you for me with this game. Why are we spending more money and

[02:12] getting much less in the game? That is it. It is a question of value. And I know that the game

[02:20] is going to be fun. I am going to play this game. I will play this game. I will have fun playing this

[02:28] game. But I will never buy the game because I do not see the value in the game. And that doesn't

[02:36] mean the game doesn't shoot well. It doesn't mean the game is not going to have Toy Story-like

[02:41] elements. But I just don't see the value. Now look, I respect you if you buy the game and you enjoy

[02:47] it. Of course, distributors and dealers want you to believe the game is so much fun because they

[02:52] make money on every single one sold. But the way I look at this game and the reason why this game

[02:58] is disappointing to me was Jersey Jack Pinball was always supposed to be the company that would

[03:04] go above and beyond. They were supposed to be the company that was going to pack these pinball

[03:10] machines, load it with all the fun toys we wanted. And the ultimate hard stop for me is this. You

[03:16] made Toy Story Pinball and there are no toys in the game. That's it. Hard stop. How are we as a

[03:24] community celebrating a game that is the most expensive game Jersey Jack Pinball has ever made

[03:30] and it has no toys in it and it's based on Toy Story. That's it. I don't care how much fun it is.

[03:37] I don't care how great the flow is. I don't care about the slot machine music. You made Toy Story.

[03:43] You put no toys in it. Hard stop. I'm out. I'm not buying it. I can easily find more toys in games

[03:50] like Jurassic Park. I can easily find more toys in games like Godzilla. Think about the major mech in

[03:56] Black Knight for a minute, right? We all ragged on Black Knight how empty it was. There is more of

[04:02] an impressive toy in Black Knight Pro than in all of Toy Story 4 for $12,000 to $15,000. And that's

[04:11] where my hard stop begins and ends because if you're not going to put the effort in and you're not

[04:17] going to engineer stuff in Toy Story that brings toys to life, then I'm not buying. And I think for

[04:23] some of you out there, I don't know why you're defending the game. I really don't. I really don't

[04:28] understand. I'm not saying the game's not fun, but can anyone honestly and earnestly look anyone in

[04:34] the eye and say, after I played this game, I saw why this game is $12,000 to $15,000. And the argument

[04:43] that if it's fun, it doesn't matter what the price is, is bogus. That's like saying a watch, if it

[04:50] accurately tells time, can be valued at anything. And sure, you could price anything and anything,

[04:56] right? A company can say, we're charging this much for this. But at some point, each and every one

[05:03] of us, in our own personal way, we have our own line in the sand. And in our minds, we're saying, if

[05:08] I'm going to spend this money, I want to see this much in a game. And if I'm going to spend $12,000

[05:12] to $15,000, I want to see a game that's loaded like Godzilla, or a game that's loaded like the Big

[05:19] Lebowski, or a game that's loaded like Pirates of the Caribbean, or a game that's loaded like

[05:23] dialed in, or a game that's loaded like the Wizard of Oz. You know, a friend of mine who's a big

[05:28] Jersey Jack fanboy, I'll say it again, his name is Derek, you know Derek, he went and played a

[05:33] Metallica. And Derek's a huge Jersey Jack fanboy. I don't think he realizes that Stern actually

[05:41] makes amazing machines. I also don't think he realizes that Stern has been packing a lot of

[05:47] their favorite machines with a lot of really fun toys. And so if you go look at Metallica now, and

[05:53] you compare Metallica and what's in it from a mechanical standpoint, it embarrasses, absolutely

[06:01] embarrasses what's in Toy Story on a mechanical level. And Derek walked away from it and said,

[06:07] wow, like it's got the hammer, it's got sparky, it's got the drop targets, it's got the snake, it's

[06:14] got all this stuff in the game. So then you look at Toy Story, you're like, what does it have? It

[06:18] has a $30 iPad. It has a ramp that flaps up. And that's about it. That's about it. Cake toppers,

[06:26] lights, more cake toppers, more lights, wide open shots, three flippers. That's it. That's it,

[06:33] people. I wish I was saying it had a crane. I wish I was saying it had RC in it. I wish I was

[06:38] saying Buzz Lightyear's wings popped open. I wish I was saying all this stuff. I wish it had the

[06:43] Etch-a-Sketch, which became the Wonka vision in it. It doesn't have anything in it. That's a toy

[06:49] that comes to life. Hard stop. I'm glad you guys enjoy your games. I'm glad you guys can justify

[06:53] the price. I can't do it. Now, I was wondering how did this become just Toy Story 4? Now,

[06:58] I'm hearing two separate rumors. One is that Pat Lawler just wanted to make Toy Story 4, but I'm

[07:03] also hearing that Disney wanted them to make the most recent one because Disney is most proud of

[07:10] how the latest movie looked because if you go back and watch the original Toy Story, it doesn't

[07:15] look nearly as good as Toy Story 4. Now, someone should have told the folks over at Disney, go look

[07:21] at pinball animations. They're all pretty bad. So we could use the footage from the first movie

[07:26] and still get away with it, but I'm not quite sure what the truth is there, whether or not

[07:31] JJP had the rights to use one through three, but they ended up with just four. But I'll say this,

[07:36] it's Jersey Jack's job to show Disney how they can make Toy Story 1 and make it work,

[07:44] even with the animations not looking as good as the ones in Toy Story 4. That's the job of Jersey

[07:50] Jack Pinball, to make Disney realize if we're going to immortalize this theme and we get one shot at

[07:56] it and they should have said that. Like the greatest thing about pinball is we're making a physical

[08:01] thing and once we make it, we can't really change it. And so if we're going to immortalize Toy Story

[08:08] in pinball format, the smartest thing we can do is to base it around the very film that made everybody

[08:16] fall in love with this franchise. And I'm not sure if they did that. I'm not sure if they were

[08:21] given the rights to all four. I'm not sure who made what decision, but I still can't get over the

[08:27] fact that it's not based on the movie we all love. Alright, so the other part I heard is this

[08:31] that's interesting that Jersey Jack Pinball has the rights to two or three Disney movies when they

[08:38] signed up for Toy Story. So what other films do we think they're going to make? Now I think they're

[08:44] going to do an Avatar pinball machine because Avatar is a Disney property and I think that is

[08:50] going to happen. They're going to have to wait for some of the Avatar sequels to come out before

[08:55] they make the pinball machine. There's no way they're going to make it in conjunction with. There's

[08:59] just no way. I think Jersey Jack Pinball making something like Avatar probably excited people

[09:05] maybe two years ago, but now that we see they're stripping these games down, it's almost like

[09:10] that's the thing too. I just want to be honest with everybody. The fact that JJP is now going to

[09:15] strip games down and charge so much money, it really bums me out. And so the next title, right,

[09:21] if this was Pat Lawler's last game and this is what he believed he needed to do,

[09:26] then maybe Eric Minier's next game, I think it's Godfather, maybe Eric will show us that this isn't

[09:32] the future of Jersey Jack and they are still going to pack a lot of fun stuff into the game. So we

[09:37] shall see. The other part of this price point that we haven't really talked about much is the cost

[09:42] to operators. Imagine if you're an operator and you buy this game and you have to spend $12,000

[09:50] to put this game on location. That's twice the price of a Stern Pro. And you could put Star Wars

[09:56] next to it. You could put Ninja Turtles. You could put Jurassic Park. You could put Godzilla.

[10:01] You've got to spend twice as much money to buy this game. That means you need to make twice as much

[10:07] money on location to break even. So normally playing Pinball on location is $1 per play.

[10:15] So because this game is $12,000, do operators need to charge people $2 to play this game? I think

[10:22] it's sort of strange to me that Pat Lawler always wanted to get his games back out on location.

[10:28] And while I think they made this the most operator friendly gameplay game, right, it's an easier game

[10:34] to understand. It's an easier game to play. They financially just made it silly for operators to

[10:41] buy this game. Because why would you buy a game for twice as much? I know what some operators would

[10:45] say. Look, it's the brand new game. It's going to get all the plays. And so yeah, we can get tons

[10:50] of plays on it. Then we can sell it and make money back. I'm not really sure what the resale

[10:54] market is on this game, guys. It's way too early. It's way too early. I do think you're going to be

[10:59] able to get a collector's edition for $15,000. I do. I don't think all 1000 of them are going to be

[11:05] spoken for. And if they are, I think there's a lot of people who speculate it on them. And I think

[11:10] the flippers aren't going to make the money they thought they were going to make. You can see it

[11:13] already. People trying to flip a CE can't even get 1500 bucks over sticker for it. Like I got

[11:19] Godzilla LE immediately made $5,000 over sticker on it. The problem is at 15K to make anything over

[11:27] that, right? Think about it. It's already not worth 15K with what's in it. And then you're going to

[11:32] spend $17,500 on one, $18,020 grand on one. But I will say, if this game was based on Andy's room

[11:41] and the original movie and had toys in it, people would be fighting over each other to get one.

[11:47] That's not the case. So I think we're going to see Godfather next. Then we're going to get Steve

[11:53] Richie's music pin, which I'm going to let you guys know what that is real soon. I'm not going to

[11:57] get scooped on this one like I did Godfather. And then we are going to get what I think is going

[12:02] to be the Matrix. So I think it's going to go Godfather, Richie Music Pin, and then The Matrix.

[12:08] And I really hope and pray that Jersey Jack Pinball is not going to make the Matrix 4. Like

[12:14] they better make the first Matrix movie. Now, if it's not the Matrix, I could see it being Avatar

[12:21] because that would kind of make sense. If there's a new Avatar movie coming out in December, that

[12:26] would be perfect time to make a Pinball machine based on it. But I really am hoping and praying

[12:32] that Jersey Jack games are not this simplified moving forward. I think if they do that, I think

[12:38] they're going to run into a real issue. There's two games that are really hard to look at for me.

[12:42] It's a $9000 Godzilla premium, and then it's $6,000 more dollars to get a Toy Story CE. And which

[12:51] is the better game? Which is the better game? Because if you want to talk about fun and you

[12:55] want to talk about flow and you want to talk about this and you want to talk about code and shots,

[13:01] Godzilla premium is a better Pinball experience than Toy Story. It's more fun. It's got more flow.

[13:07] It's got more code. It's got more toys. It's got more of everything. So why would you spend $6,000

[13:14] more? You know, they don't want you to ask these questions. You know, FOMO is an interesting thing.

[13:19] It's like dealers and distributors. They want you to turn off your common sense when you're

[13:24] thinking about this stuff. But this is the show that just going to implore you to look at it a

[13:30] little bit this way. I mean, look, I'm the biggest Toy Story fanatic. I'm walking away from it. I am

[13:34] not going to do this. I am not going to support stripping stuff out of games. And then I'm not

[13:40] going to spend my hard earned money on this game. I think now is a good time to officially announce

[13:45] I'm walking away from Ultraman. I'm not buying Ultraman number 500. I'm not going in on it.

[13:50] I wish Spooky would let me roll over that $2,000 on to like Scooby-Doo, but there's no way I'm

[13:56] cutting them a check for eight grand for Ultraman. It doesn't have it. They don't deserve 10 grand for

[14:02] that game. So I'm going to wait. I'm going to wait. I'm going to save $15,000 by not buying Toy Story CE.

[14:09] I'm going to lose $2,000 on Ultraman, but the lesson learned, the lesson I've learned is more

[14:15] valuable to me than that $2,000 because I'm done. Like I'm not chasing these games sight unseen.

[14:21] I'm not buying all these games to try to make a buck on them because if you spend $2,500 on a Toy

[14:27] Story CE, you might not be able to flip it. You might not be able to even get back 15,000 for it by

[14:33] the time they make it. Think about that. They're not making this game for four months. So you might

[14:38] sit on that order. Everybody might get an LE. Everyone might play the game, have fun with it,

[14:44] but also realize I don't need to own it. And then what are you going to do? You're either going to

[14:48] lose that $2,500 deposit, then you got to send in a check for $13,500 in the middle of a recession

[14:55] that's going to come and hit people real hard. Again, if you're going to spend $15,500 on a game,

[15:01] doesn't that have to be a dream theme for you? Like a dream game, a dream experience? Are you

[15:07] seeing it in this game? You might be, and I'm happy if you are, but I just don't see it. All right.

[15:12] So let's move on from Toy Story because it's just going to be this. There's nothing left to talk about.

[15:15] Like the next thing is I'll play the game and I guarantee you I'm going to have fun playing it.

[15:20] I'm just saying it right now. I'm going to have fun. I'm just not buying it. So if you move on from

[15:24] Jersey Jack, let's go to Stern Pinball. So Stern Pinball has given new Godzilla code. The game

[15:29] keeps getting better and better and better. And I think Godzilla LE is going to be a game that

[15:33] just keeps going up and up in value. I probably sold mine too early at $16,000. There are a thousand

[15:40] of them out there, but Godzilla keeps shaping up to be maybe the best Stern Pinball machine of all

[15:46] time. And I'm going to say it right now. It is shaping up to be maybe one of the best pinball

[15:51] machines overall of all time. And I think the team with Keith Elwin that Stern has on his games

[15:57] is the best team in pinball right now. They might be the best team ever assembled to make

[16:04] pinball machines because what I love about the team that Keith is working with, it's not just

[16:09] Keith. I think what makes his games so special and his team's games so special is I think they have

[16:14] a real vision for the game. I don't think they do one piece at a time. I think he goes into each

[16:21] game knowing everything he would want from a rule standpoint, from a design standpoint, from a toy

[16:27] standpoint. Everything feels so cohesive that when a Keith Elwin game comes out, it just checks

[16:33] every single box. And I think other games don't do that. And I think at these price points,

[16:39] you don't want any compromises. You want to make sure they get it all right. I mean, look at the

[16:44] code in Godzilla. It might be one of the best codes that's ever been in a pinball machine,

[16:49] and everything works so perfectly together. I don't hear any complaints about this game. I mean,

[16:55] yeah, there's a few tweaks here and there, but for the most part, this is what we want. Can you imagine

[17:01] if spooky pinball made Godzilla? Can you just imagine? I mean, just imagine like the layout for

[17:06] Halloween in Ultraman being turned into Godzilla pinball. That would be like a metaverse world you

[17:11] don't want to live in. So Stern pinball is crushing it with Godzilla. I'm hearing a lot of good stuff

[17:17] about Rush. I think people are playing Rush more and more. I think they're really enjoying the layout.

[17:22] I think Rush pinball shoots really good. I think Borg has made every Rush fan very happy, and I think

[17:27] he's made a lot of people just enjoy how a game should shoot very happy. So that's exciting. I never

[17:32] thought I'd say this. I'm much more excited to see what's next from Stern pinball than I am from

[17:39] Jersey Jack pinball. I never felt that way. I always felt like the Jersey Jack launches were the big

[17:44] ones. That was the one where we were going to see everything that was possible in a pinball experience

[17:50] or innovations. I no longer feel that way. I'm more excited to see what Keith Elwyn does next with

[17:55] Jaws and what James Bond is like and what Back to the Future is like and what Venom is like.

[18:00] Stern pinball is going in the right direction. Jersey Jack is going in the wrong direction.

[18:06] That's just how I feel. And look, it's up to Jersey Jack to change our minds on the next game.

[18:11] So Stern pinball isn't going to be Venom next. I think it is, but I think we might see James Bond

[18:17] sneak out in front of it. Here's what I heard that's happening over at Stern pinball. This extra time

[18:23] during the delay to put out a new game has given each designer a lot more time to work on their

[18:29] games. So I think the next games that come out from Stern over the next 12 months might be some of

[18:35] the greatest pins they ever put out because they've had more time. And that's a good thing. And that's

[18:41] the other reason why people are so disappointed in Toy Story is Pat Lawler got the work on this for

[18:46] like three years. Like he had so much time to work on this game and Jersey Jack pinball only puts out

[18:52] one game every 18 months to two years. So that's why people are like, no, that's not good enough.

[18:59] Imagine if Stern pinball said, look, we're going to put out just one game in 18 months and all of

[19:05] our greatest talent is going to work on it. It would blow away Toy Story. Stern pinball usually

[19:12] has a new game every four months, people. It's amazing what they do and they're going in the

[19:17] right direction. And I'm so bullish on Stern pinball right now. And I'm so bearish on JJP. So

[19:24] who's next? So Stern's got a lot coming, but I think we're going to have to wait till like August,

[19:28] September before any of it happens. So right now, I think they're just going to flood the market with

[19:32] Godzilla premiums. All right, what's happening over at Spooky? So Spooky pinball, they're still

[19:37] polishing Ultraman and Halloween. Again, I've lost interest. I have if you get a game, I'm happy for

[19:43] you. I'm never unhappy for someone who's enjoying their pinball experience. Scooby-Doo is next.

[19:48] I think that's going to be the theme they need. And I think it's going to be the title they need.

[19:53] And I think it's going to be the game that can win back all of the goodwill they've lost. Now,

[19:58] they need to nail it. I don't think anyone's convinced Bug is a great designer yet. I don't

[20:03] think anyone's convinced this new team over at Spooky, right? A lot of the old talent left.

[20:08] I think they have to win people back. And if there's any title that can do that for them,

[20:13] it is Scooby-Doo. Now, we might see a small run of TNA. They might run like 200 TNAs in between,

[20:19] but I'm hearing from a good source that Scooby-Doo is next from Spooky Pinball. So excited to see

[20:25] that game. All right, let's go over to American Pinball, a company that I'm not seeing a lot of

[20:31] Legends of Bahá'la unboxings. I don't know where the game is. Like, do you know where these games

[20:35] are? Like, where are the unboxings of these games? I've been hearing they're having a hard time getting

[20:39] cabinets. So we'll see if that's the issue. But everyone knows that there's one game that is

[20:44] going to show us if American Pinball knows what they're doing or not. And that is Dennis Nordman's

[20:49] game. This is it. Dennis Nordman and David Ficks and Sophia and everyone over there. I think

[20:55] Franci's working on the artwork. This is going to be the game. Like, if they knock it out of the

[20:59] park with something really amazing and load this game up. So that's the other thing about

[21:03] Toy Story being so barren. If you load up your game now and you charge $8,000 to $9,000 for it,

[21:10] people will throw money at it. But if you remove stuff from your game and charge $12,000 to $15,000,

[21:15] I think you're going to see people saying pass. But the thing that they don't have, right? They

[21:19] don't have a license. Like, Toy Story is a huge license. Like, all of these games coming out from

[21:23] everybody else are pretty huge licenses. So will they be able to do it? I don't know. I don't know

[21:29] what the game is. What I do know is this American Pinball in the past has not shown us. They have

[21:35] a George Gomez visionary over there. And will they be able to do it? I'm a little worried that in the

[21:42] past, they don't understand the details. They don't understand like the artwork. They just don't

[21:48] understand what people really want. But this is the first game that's made by the new vision of

[21:53] American Pinball. So no pressure. Actually, it's all the pressure in the world. Because I think

[21:58] this entire company, and I think Mukesh is going to either see this game succeed or pull the plug

[22:03] on American Pinball. I mean it. And it couldn't be coming out at a worse time with recession and

[22:08] right on top of Stern coming back with new titles. I think American Pinball has taken a really long

[22:14] time to get this game to market. And I hope it's worth the wait. That's the thing. If you're going

[22:18] to make people wait, it better be worth the wait. So speaking of worth the wait, cactus canyons are

[22:24] starting to ship more and more games out to customers. We still have not seen the limited

[22:29] edition games, which is, you know, it is what it is. I mean, I hate that you guys had to buy this

[22:34] game back in last October, and you're still waiting. The part that has me a little worried, and again,

[22:39] I'm just going into the thread. There are owners of these games noticing issues with quality. Now,

[22:46] Chicago Gaming Company has always been a company that prides itself on making the best quality

[22:52] product. And I go into the thread and I'm seeing decals are wrinkling. I'm seeing posts are all

[22:58] rusted in the game. And I'm seeing like issues with some of the mechs. But here's the scary part.

[23:03] I'm hearing owners saying they're having a really hard time getting anyone on the phone or getting

[23:09] anyone to answer their quality issues. And this is another company where you made people wait so

[23:15] long that if you make people wait this long, you got to get it right. And I hope they figure this

[23:21] out before the LEDs go on the line. We're starting to see some real quality issues on this game that

[23:27] weren't present on the first three titles that they released. So hopefully CGC, I thought Butch was

[23:33] doing their customer service. And Butch is usually so good at getting back to people. So I hope they

[23:38] have someone on the other end of the phone. That's the thing, you know, for 10 grand, you want to be

[23:43] able to call up these companies and get somebody because think about it, if you have a customer

[23:47] service department in a pinball company that's only selling a few hundred games, maybe a couple

[23:53] thousand and only like a couple hundred have even shipped, the only people calling you right now are

[23:58] your early adopter buyers. So there should always be someone who picks up the phone. Because what

[24:03] else are they doing? Like, isn't this their job? All right, so what else is going on? So I talked

[24:08] to Barry over at Dutch pinball. I asked him a very simple question. How many big Lebowski's are you

[24:13] making? Because remember when big Lebowski came out, I thought it was like limited to like five

[24:17] or 600 units. And there was some sort of scarcity to them. But I heard from him right now that they

[24:23] are making an unlimited amount for now. They might cap it at 1000. But here's the thing that I don't

[24:30] think anyone really knows how many eas are owed games. I think it's still got to be a few hundred,

[24:37] right? And I'm not sure how many new games they need to make to then send a game to an EA buyer.

[24:43] They've definitely got the production going now. I'm not sure how many a week they're making.

[24:48] But here's the thing I would love to see from Dutch. And it's the same thing I would love to

[24:51] see from Haggis Pinball. I would just love to see more transparency. How many games a week are you

[24:58] making? And how many EA games are going out on a weekly or monthly basis? That is all I would

[25:05] like to know. The same thing with Fathom. I'm so tired of Fathom thread. It's so confusing. Like

[25:11] another game went out. But what does that mean? Like how many have you built? It's been almost

[25:15] two months now since they said productions be gone. No words. And I don't know what to say anymore.

[25:21] It's like, can't they just be transparent and tell us how many they're making a week? As an owner

[25:27] of both of these games, as an EA owner of Lebowski and the owner of Fathom, shouldn't you know from

[25:34] the company just how many a week are you making? Like why is that like a question that nobody wants

[25:40] to ask? It's also a question nobody wants to answer. And that leads you down a road of negativity,

[25:47] right? Then everyone starts speculating that things aren't going well. But at least with

[25:50] Dutch Pinball, we have all those great photos from the new factory where it actually looks like

[25:56] there's a lot of progress happening. Have we ever seen a photo from Haggis where it looks like a

[26:01] lot of progress is happening? Still haven't seen it. I still think they're just like slowly building

[26:05] these games like in a garage fashion. And I'm just not sure they're making more than like a couple

[26:11] a week at best. And you can't just make eight a month or 10 a month and make it in pinball. So

[26:16] we'll see what happens. Same is true with p3 multi morphic. I wish I had more to talk about with Jerry's

[26:22] whole new weird owl game. But where is it? That's the only question Jerry, where's the game months

[26:27] have gone by, and nobody has got a new one. And what happened? So you made a few prototypes,

[26:33] you got a bunch of deposits, and now we wait, now we wait, now we wait, the real weight is this,

[26:39] they got to find workers. It's all a worker shortage. These companies, they don't have people

[26:44] on the line, they don't have like a dedicated staff to make the games. They have a dedicated staff to

[26:49] design the games, which is what leads you to a prototype. And then they bring that prototype

[26:55] to shows. But then they get screwed because they get a bunch of orders. And the only way you can

[26:59] make your orders is if you have a dedicated workforce that can actually make these games.

[27:05] That's really the hold up for these boutique companies. All right, everybody, where is spinal

[27:09] tap home pins, spinal tap haven't seen anything lately on it. I still think when it comes out,

[27:15] it's going to be good. It's we're all going to be able to look at it and laugh at it and then move on

[27:19] and not order it. That's what's going to happen with spinal tap. I'm also hearing that the pinball

[27:24] brothers, they're getting their alien machines out the door. They're going to reveal very soon

[27:29] the queen pinball machine. If it's the queen pinball machine that we saw in that queen pop up

[27:35] boutique, I'm worried the game looks like it's a game that would have came out 10 years ago. The

[27:40] artwork is not up to standards of where we are. And it's also a music pin. So you are now following

[27:46] in the footsteps of games like Rush and Guns N' Roses. It looks really dated. And I think they

[27:52] need to sort of rethink it. Because remember, this queen pinball machine was still made by the team

[27:57] that was working over at Highway Pinball. And it just feels like, I don't know, queen's a great

[28:02] band that deserves a great machine. And from what we saw, it just doesn't look like something that's

[28:08] going to be able to compete with like the newer games that are out in the marketplace. Who am I

[28:13] missing? Like, is there anyone else I'm missing? I think that's kind of it. I think that's kind of it.

[28:17] Everybody, I look forward to giving you more shows. It's a really interesting time in pinball. I mean

[28:23] it when I say that. Like, there's a lot coming. There's a recession happening. And pinball prices

[28:29] are going through the roof. I just saw a stranger things out of box, not even new in box for sale

[28:35] and le $18,000 $18,000 for a pinball machine that was 9,000 just a couple years ago. And when it was

[28:44] 9,000 new in box, they sat new in box for a long time. I'm not saying that stranger things didn't

[28:50] get better. It did. I'm not saying stranger things isn't fun to shoot. It is. I'm not saying stranger

[28:56] things code isn't now like much better than at launch. But what I'm saying is for $18,000, I

[29:02] wouldn't go near a stranger things le. The more we jump in and inflate these prices, we're going to

[29:08] get what we're getting right now. We're going to get less for our money. And I don't know why anyone

[29:14] thinks that's a good thing. I would love it if every pinball machine I bought doubled in price

[29:19] in three years. I would absolutely love it. But what's happening now is this is the companies

[29:24] are seeing what the second hand market is doing. And now they're going to start charging that for

[29:30] games new in box, but they're not upping the bomb by two times. And I think we're about to see a lot

[29:36] more people just be a lot more selective if this is where pinball pricing is going. It's not even

[29:43] going there. It's here. Like if I told you a few years ago, Jersey Jack is going to ask for $15,000

[29:49] and then I said, here's the major toy and toy story. And it's just a flap that pops up. If I told

[29:54] you that's the major toy and toy story, you'd be like, you're crazy. Nobody's going to buy it,

[29:59] but they're selling games. Don't get me wrong. People are buying toy story left and right. This

[30:03] isn't like a sales flop. But I think when the dust settles, when the dust settles, it's not just

[30:08] toy story. I think this entire hobby has gotten out of hand. And I think the dust is going to settle

[30:14] for a lot of people in a lot of ways over the next year. And I think we're in for a really rough

[30:19] ride financially. And I think a lot of people are going to realize, what did I do? What did I do?

[30:24] Why did I tie up $100,000 in pinball machines? Or why didn't I sell my pinball machine when I could

[30:30] have got double for it? Right? At some point, like no pinball machine is $18,000 of fun. It's not.

[30:36] We all know this. Like everyone's going to wake up from this crazy period in which everyone just

[30:42] wanted to show how much money you had and what you could acquire, but the product itself. Pinball

[30:48] is super fun. Pinball was always super fun, but it's not $20,000 fun. Not to me. It's not. And

[30:56] maybe not to you. The only people that can say it's $20,000 fun are people who $20,000 to them

[31:04] is more like $2,000. And because pinball machines used to cost like $2,000. Everybody, thank you for

[31:10] tuning in to Canadians Pinball Podcast. I love doing the show. I'm going to get more shows up now.

[31:15] My vacation is over and we will always find interesting stuff to talk about. On my next

[31:20] episode, the topic will be this. And I'm curious what your thoughts are because I want to read what

[31:24] your answers are on the next show. Here's the topic for the next show. If you had $10,000,

[31:30] what pinball machine would you buy? You can only buy one machine. It doesn't have to be exactly

[31:37] $10,000, but you can't exceed $10,000. I hand you $10,000 and I say, pick one machine you can get.

[31:45] Okay? So I would love to hear from you at canadepinball.com. What machine would you buy? If I gave you

[31:52] a $10,000 check to buy any machine, I will tell you the game I would buy and it's going to be a

[31:57] great podcast and we're going to focus on that on the next episode. Everybody be good. More episodes

[32:03] coming and thank you so much for the support. It means so much. I'll talk to you soon.
