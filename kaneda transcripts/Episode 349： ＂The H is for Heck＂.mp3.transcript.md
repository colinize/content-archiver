[00:00] I wanna rock!

[00:01] I want to rock!

[00:05] I want to rock!

[00:08] I want to rock!

[00:11] I want to sing a singer!

[00:15] It feels like an eternity when we take five days off from this podcast.

[00:19] Welcome to episode 349 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:23] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:24] Got a great show for you.

[00:26] It's gonna be worth the wait this return.

[00:28] We're gonna talk to Ben Heck again.

[00:30] He's always a great guest.

[00:32] What else is going on?

[00:33] Here's the reason why I took about a week off from pinball podcasting.

[00:36] First and foremost, the weather is getting really nice.

[00:40] The last thing I sometimes want to do is think about pinball.

[00:43] Be on pinside.

[00:44] Get out and enjoy the weekend.

[00:47] Enjoy the nice weather.

[00:49] Last weekend especially.

[00:50] Friday night Brenda took me to a 11 Madison park for a special dinner.

[00:57] If you don't know the restaurant, three Michelin star got voted the best restaurant in

[01:02] the world in 2018.

[01:05] Was it the best food I've ever had?

[01:07] I gotta be honest with people.

[01:09] I sometimes enjoy just a bacon egg and cheese and a slice of pepperoni pizza and a nice

[01:14] coke every once in a while.

[01:16] But the food was phenomenal.

[01:17] But you go there for the service.

[01:19] They gave us a to go treat where they hand drew Bubba's face on it.

[01:25] And that was what our goodie bag was or a doggy bag when we left the restaurant.

[01:30] They went online.

[01:31] They researched who we were and they found that we had a dog named Bubba.

[01:35] I'll upload that as the podcast image for this podcast.

[01:38] Then I had a friend's 40th birthday Kentucky Derby and then we had Cinco de Mayo.

[01:43] But here I am.

[01:44] Sobered up and ready to talk about pinball.

[01:46] I have to be honest with all of you out there.

[01:49] I know I say that like I lie to you.

[01:50] I don't lie to you.

[01:51] I need to be honest.

[01:53] And that's just been like eating away at me a little bit.

[01:56] Is sort of the blowback I got after I hyped Willy Wonka.

[02:01] I was really excited for the game.

[02:03] I still am really excited for the game.

[02:06] And I don't know.

[02:07] Something about people being upset with me for saying how excited I was about the pinball

[02:11] machine has sort of rubbed me the wrong way.

[02:15] And you know me, I like to be rubbed the right way.

[02:17] But the whole notion of you're not allowed to get over excited.

[02:20] You're not allowed to raise people's expectations.

[02:22] You're not allowed to like tell people that it's a game changing game and it's going to

[02:26] change the pinball landscape.

[02:28] Let me tell you something.

[02:29] I can say whatever I want about a pinball machine.

[02:32] And if I get really excited about a game, I'm going to let you know.

[02:35] I'm going to tell you how I feel in the moment.

[02:38] Of course, the first impression with the game that shoots amazingly well, that is a

[02:42] theme you love is always going to make you pretty giddy inside.

[02:45] So I just want to say that that was a little annoying to me that I got that kind of blowback.

[02:51] I still I still.

[02:52] I see people like accusing me of ruining their ability to enjoy Willy Wonka.

[02:58] And I just want to say if that ruins your ability to enjoy the game, then I think you need

[03:04] some help.

[03:05] All right, make up your own mind.

[03:06] I want to just say bluntly make up your own mind on these games, but I'm still getting

[03:11] a Willy Wonka.

[03:12] All right.

[03:13] Now, when will they ship?

[03:14] I don't know.

[03:15] I think they released it too early.

[03:16] I don't think we're going to see it in homes in June.

[03:19] Do you?

[03:20] I don't know.

[03:21] The whole thing of in homes in June.

[03:24] Deeproot June 30th.

[03:25] I'm still hearing that owners of Zidware claims are being told that by June 30th, they will

[03:32] be able to buy one of three.

[03:36] Or choose from one of three games that are available to them.

[03:40] Let me read you, let me read you the goodwill terms of the Zidware contract.

[03:46] Okay, because this is really interesting.

[03:48] I don't know about you, but I'm fascinated that this is actually like what the terms are.

[03:53] So it's something like this goodwill agreement is between so and so and deep root pinball.

[04:00] All right, so the customer and deep root tech are here and after collectively referred to as the parties.

[04:08] All right, whereas the customer entered into an agreement with Zidware and or John A.

[04:14] a popative junior collectively Zidware related to the purchase of one or more of the following pinball games.

[04:23] Magic girl, Raza, Alice in Wonderland and space mission X.

[04:29] Whereas the customer submitted one or more proofs of claims to deep root tech and has placed it a positive in the amount of 4250 prior to the effective date of this agreement.

[04:42] So I think that's what the that's the amount of money I think they're giving people.

[04:46] Okay, so whereas deep root tech seeks to provide pinball games to the customer and as agreed here in in exchange for certain promises.

[04:55] Okay. Now here's the promises.

[04:58] This is the interesting part delivery date.

[05:01] Deep root tech shall begin delivering pinball game machines by June 30th of 2019.

[05:10] As or as may be amended by deep root tech to an earlier date by the delivery date.

[05:17] Deep root tech shall offer at least three different titles and shall identify all titles of deep root games that may be elected under this agreement.

[05:29] At least 30 days in advance of the delivery date.

[05:32] Okay, so what that means is by the end of May, we will know what the three titles are that these gentlemen have available to them to buy.

[05:44] Okay, so this is coming up very quickly.

[05:46] All right, then it goes on to say, should deep root tech elect to manufacture or sell any of the subject games.

[05:54] Deep root tech has the soul and absolute right to alter the nature of the subject games.

[06:00] IE title theme structure graphics or layout and the quantity produced of the subject games.

[06:07] So what they're saying there is if you want a magic girl and you think you're getting a magic girl or you're not going to get the magic girl you saw before there.

[06:14] They might make changes to that game and it might be a different kind of magic girl.

[06:18] It also means they originally only going to make 16 magic girls.

[06:21] Now they might make unlimited magic girls.

[06:23] All right, what else?

[06:26] Number two, so these are the three things you get your delivery.

[06:28] Number two, customer benefits, the customer may elect deep root games by applying the deposit to the following tiered pricing structure.

[06:37] So $5,000 for one deep root game, 9500 for two and 14,500 for three.

[06:45] All right, and then it says the third part is the election and that means within 30 days of the delivery date, you must let them know how many games you want

[06:55] and what games you want.

[06:56] And then it goes on to say failure to delivery, notwithstanding any other terms here in the deep root tech fail if deep root tech fails to deliver a deep root game to the customer by the delivery date, then deep root has to pay the claim for that customer.

[07:18] So if you have a $4,500 credit with them and they don't deliver by June 30th and you are in on a John Papadu game that they gave you credit for, they owe you that money back.

[07:28] So that just leads everyone to believe there is a lot riding on this date.

[07:34] So June 30th and as of a few weeks ago, Robert is still telling people they're going to hit that date.

[07:40] So everybody, let's see what happens by May 30th even because that's that's what I think we should hear the titles.

[07:47] All right, I'm going to stop rambling. Let me talk to Ben Hack. You'll enjoy it. We talk about all this stuff and more. Have a great day everybody.

[07:56] All right, welcome back. We've had a week hiatus because I've been scouring the earth to find this man to talk about internet connection and the letter H, Mr. Ben Hack.

[08:11] Hey, you can't spell heck without the letter H. Now let's start there because I know that you believe that the Willy Wonka logo needs a massive overhaul. What are your thoughts?

[08:25] Well, one's a massive overhaul. But when I was at mid was gaming class, like that's where I played it for the first time.

[08:33] There was something off about the logo. I mean, I definitely got that impression like I thought overall the art looked really good.

[08:40] I mean, I know a lot of people complain that it's just, you know, collage, you know, the same image of Gene Wilder 50 times, but I mean, it looked good.

[08:48] Yeah, I mean, I don't know the logo. We're just like really like brownish. I know chocolate's brown.

[08:54] Yeah, but then when I saw that.

[08:56] A dissertation that Ork did, I was like, oh, right. So that's that, you know, it's like I could tell that there was something wrong, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it and and he nailed it.

[09:12] Are you surprised, Ben, when you see you were like really enraged.

[09:16] No, I mean, here's a thing. I think this is what I thought was funny is is this logo has changed numerous times since 1971.

[09:25] I think even or point that out that somewhere along the line, it was vectorized and it was scanned in and then it was, you know, it hasn't looked like it did originally and years.

[09:39] But I still think 99.9% of people that would walk up to that machine. That is not where they would ever stop and say, wait, this needs to change. That was my point.

[09:51] Right. That's completely understandable, but I would say counter that that doesn't mean it's not wrong.

[09:58] I can't look at a lawn and tell you wrong with it. I can't look at drywall and tell you what's wrong with it, but I can look at a circuit and tell you what's wrong with it or fonts.

[10:09] I used to be a graphic artist. I mean, the number of times people would come in with just a business card with a logo on the business card and say, make this into a sign.

[10:19] Or put this into my car and it's like, seriously, you got business cards made, but you don't have the original art. You only have what's on the business card.

[10:27] So I've, this is I'm talking like 20 years ago, but I've scanned many, many pieces of shitty artwork in my younger life.

[10:35] And I understand like if you even back then, you know, we had auto tracers. They didn't work as well as they do now, but you couldn't just click it and rely on it to work 100%.

[10:46] Especially if you talk about typography.

[10:49] Right. So yeah, I think I think order is right there. There was a they auto traced it, but then they didn't think about the fonts as far as fonts are concerned.

[10:58] Like how the stroke with need to be consistent on, you know, all the letters on the left hand side versus the right hand side.

[11:04] And that's why some of the letters look a little thin.

[11:06] Do you think they didn't pay attention to it or they were just handed that by the studio by Warner Brothers?

[11:13] They were probably handed handed up by Warner Brothers who had it some, it detised it 10 years ago who wasn't paying attention.

[11:20] Right. I mean, you know, it's it's it's it's always a churn at studios. Like they don't always care.

[11:25] Like, you know, it's like the interns assistant is doing things.

[11:29] Right. What do you think they don't give a shit?

[11:31] We haven't talked since Willy Wonka was revealed. What do you think of the game? Artwork, everything design.

[11:36] I enjoyed it, especially compared to something like Black Knight 3000, which I was taken a back at how empty it was.

[11:48] At least the pro and you know, I know Willy Wonka is, you know, considerably more expensive than a black knight pro, but still it just it seems like a complete, it feels like a completely different game.

[11:58] You know, actually, I guess people were expected more, but I don't know.

[12:02] I thought it had enough stuff in it. It had a rotating gobstopper.

[12:06] It had a lot of paths that the ball could take. That's one thing that I liked like the screen on the upper right.

[12:12] Give a like indicate.

[12:16] Left half the right path. So if that was the screen is part of the gameplay. I guess I'm saying you know, we have an indicate.

[12:21] Yeah, I think when people play the game, they will understand that that screen is more than just wonka vision. It also helps indicate where to shoot.

[12:29] So it's really, it's really well integrated, but I think until you play it, you kind of don't get a sense of how integral it is into the gameplay.

[12:38] Correct. This is the same thing that well that like alien didn't do. Alien had that big honken screen that didn't work half the time.

[12:45] And there was a scoop right under it. It's like, this is a perfect place for mode start, right?

[12:50] Right. And that's that's not how it worked. But so yeah, whereas with Wonka, I mean, you think about what Hobbit had that

[12:59] book screen and you know, it's basically telling you kind of redundant information and it wasn't really interactive. So yeah, I mean, I think the screen on

[13:07] Wonka is really cool. It fits the theme, you know, because you know that the Wonka vision in the movie. I like the rotating scoop. I know it wasn't like super innovative, I guess.

[13:17] I mean, I thought about making a rotating scoop before myself. So that's why I appreciate it that. And there's a lot of nice little touches like the upper left ramp.

[13:26] The ball can come back and it was diverter. So can drop the ball onto the lower flipper or can continue down into the left in lane.

[13:34] So there were just a lot of different paths the ball could take, which I thought was good because that gives you a lot of room for code in the future.

[13:42] Right. And I think that's one of the things I love the most. And I don't know if you heard any of my, my, my hype of the game, but I've been blamed for rising.

[13:50] Oh, I the expectations. I remember you. I remember your hype. Yeah, definitely. Let me show. Let me show you a question about that.

[13:56] Because I kind of after a few weeks have gone by since that. And part of me is just like, people are mad at me, Ben, for being excited about a pinball game.

[14:05] Do you agree with their victory all towards me for being excited? Did I ruin their ability to enjoy this game?

[14:12] Well, first of all, the fact that Jack invited you to his factory after all the things you've said about his company is pretty amazing.

[14:20] I mean, you've never held back with him. So I think that was pretty cool that he, you know, had you over. So that was, yeah, that spoke vibes.

[14:28] But I think you know, that's because you know, he must have been really confident in the game. There is the phenomenon though.

[14:35] What's the word access media where you'll have someone that like, oh, I hate EA, I hate EA. And they get to go to an event in Los Angeles. Oh, the next EA game is great. Right.

[14:47] So there, I think if anything, people are probably thinking about that sort of thing, you know, like the YouTuber who hates all the new Star Wars movies.

[14:54] They get invited to the premiere of Han Solo and all of a sudden they love it. They love it.

[14:58] That's definitely something that happens. So I think people are probably probably mostly worried that you're retainted by that.

[15:04] But you know, it's, it is a really cool game. I mean, I think, yeah, if Stern, if Stern invited me to go play Star Wars, I was not leaving Stern and gushing over how they handle the Star Wars franchise.

[15:16] Here's the thing. I think Willy Wonka, I heard all the feedback. I've heard the complaints about the music and the artwork and this and that.

[15:24] I just fell in love with you. I fell in love when I shot it. I just fell in love with the way the game shoots.

[15:29] Yeah, it shoots really well. It has a fairly unique layout. I mean, it's actually, it is pretty unique because it doesn't have, you know,

[15:37] paddle all our allot time. So put like pop bumpers on the left side of the play field halfway up and then he'll have some sort of orbiter toy on the upper right, which I guess you kind of have with that, that wonky vision.

[15:48] But it actually felt fairly unique. It felt different from dialed in definitely. No, I probably only played it about four times, but I thought it was really cool.

[15:59] The LCD is done really well. It's a little too skew morphing if you ask me. There's too many LED displays and literal representations of computers.

[16:09] But they also have CGI, what's it called? Oompa Loompas. So that's cool.

[16:14] Right. Yeah, I mean, the display is interesting. I think the main question for me is how they fully integrate the movie into the code.

[16:21] I'm still a little nervous that I don't really feel like the scenes I love from the film are happening in mode form. I don't know why.

[16:30] Like there's not clips and callouts and video from the film.

[16:37] There is a lot of a lot of it is represented with CG graphics. Wait, that's redundant.

[16:42] But why would you do that when the what when the movie is available?

[16:46] Well, one thing that we've come across or in the past tense, you know, since I'm just a wandering vagabond now is sometimes you have to pay by the minute.

[16:55] So you don't just get the whole movie. It's like, okay, tell us what 10 minutes of the movie you want and it's going to cost you this much.

[17:02] Really?

[17:02] That is something. Yeah, that's something that they could have bumped up into as well.

[17:06] So what we might be experiencing is cost-cutting measures might be the reason why theme integration isn't stellar in the game.

[17:16] I wouldn't say cost-cutting, but think about it. I mean, you have not permitted.

[17:20] Is it not cost-cutting if it's cost per every 10 minutes?

[17:29] I wouldn't call it cost-cutting so much as it makes the video unaffordable.

[17:33] And you know, it's quite possible that they're like, hey, it's cheaper to do CGI representations of the super machine or whatever and then get it approved by Warner Brothers.

[17:43] Then it is to pay like, I don't know, like $30,000 in a minute or whatever they want for the footage.

[17:47] I mean, we have no idea. I mean, something to think about. It's just like with the labor market.

[17:52] There are what? 94,000 pinball companies right now.

[17:56] And they're all going after the same titles. So it's a seller's market for the studios and the content producers.

[18:02] Right. And so, which is interesting because Batman 66, obviously not based on the movies, based on the TV show,

[18:09] they can use them. It seems like any clip from the TV show, there's also a reason why they didn't use the Batman.

[18:16] The movie clips at all because I heard those were much more expensive to utilize.

[18:20] Hold me in the 1960s movie.

[18:23] Yeah. So a whole different contract, probably a whole different, you know, good.

[18:27] Wasn't Batman the 1960s Batman like not on a video for like decades for some sort of rights issue?

[18:35] Do you remember that?

[18:36] No, I mean, I don't personally. I mean, I just remember watching it in reruns.

[18:40] Okay. So let's go back to Black Knight.

[18:43] So just one more thing. I'm kind of wondering if maybe whatever finally freed up the rights issues

[18:51] for the 1960s Batman series, perhaps made the footage and using it more affordable.

[18:57] You know, like maybe it was just a certain way or that was CBS, right?

[19:01] So maybe it was on the right side of the CBS via Com Split.

[19:05] But here's the thing that I'm just a little confused about because the Hobbit, modern movie,

[19:11] so many clips from the film, I know they didn't get all the rights for the sound actors,

[19:16] like E. McAllen's replaced with the sound alike, but it's just kind of a sound alike who is not

[19:22] Gandalf technically. Yeah. It's like Gandalf's brother in law.

[19:25] Right. But that was the same studio. That was Warner Brothers, same studio.

[19:29] Right. That's what I'm saying. Wizard of Oz seems to have a lot more clips from the movie itself.

[19:34] So I'm just, you know, I guess the right exact we don't know how long we don't know how far along

[19:39] this code is. So that's the other thing is people are saying 40%, 60%, I do think there's going to be

[19:45] a lot of pressure over the next few weeks for more of that movie to be integrated in the game.

[19:53] Or I think people could be on the fence and wait until the game is finally fully coded.

[19:59] It did seem like most of the times when you saw a movie clip, it was used for transitional

[20:04] purposes, you know, like when a mode started and it seemed to recall seeing the same clip over and

[20:10] over. But again, you know, Batman started the same way and we all know Keith Johnson will finish a

[20:14] game eventually. This is not Keith Johnson. Oh, it's not. It's Joe Katz. Oh, okay. Well,

[20:23] I was going to say one other thing regarding that. That was weird though. When you see the clip,

[20:26] the transitional clips, Ben, and like there's, you see them, but they're not, you don't hear them

[20:30] talking. It's like, it's like the scenes on you. Yeah, that's true. And then they do have a lot

[20:36] of sound delikes in it as well. I'm sure you noticed that. And Jersey Jack does his sound delikes

[20:43] very well. I mean, like, he's like, was it a pause? They were fantastic. And then, well, then,

[20:47] like what Zen Pinball had, incredible sound delikes for their Star Wars tables, which makes you

[20:51] wonder, you know, what, what happened with like some of the Stern games. I don't know. Again,

[20:58] I can't, I'm just speculating. It is possible also. I mean, Gene Wilder's dead unlike, you know,

[21:02] is there anyone dead from the Hobbit movie? So maybe his estate is more difficult to work with.

[21:07] Right. It's, we don't, we don't know. I'm sure Jack knows something else to think about. Jack

[21:13] and Stern were fighting over that license like a hyena with a scrap of meat. So that could have

[21:19] also bumped things up and Jack had lost it at one point. I don't know about that. I did hear that,

[21:28] Stern like wrote, what was the word? They wrote like chocolate river or something on their

[21:33] pin press machine just to like antagonize him because they knew he wanted. Well, same thing happened

[21:38] with Hobbit. I mean, they're, they fight over you. Jack and he said he woke up one day and was

[21:44] told that he no longer had the license. And I think what happened was, I think because he did

[21:49] such a good job. Yeah. I think because he did such a good job with Wizard of Oz. I mean,

[21:54] if you're Jack, imagine this, imagine you've done Wizard of Oz and Stern has done their games,

[21:59] right? And Warner Brothers is like, well, we're looking for the next, the pinball company to make

[22:04] Willy Wonka. Really not hard for Jack to show them who's going to do it better justice.

[22:10] Right. And you know, if you're, if you're, I mean, obviously Stern manufactures games better than

[22:16] anyone. That's their major superpower. And perhaps that is at a cost of making simplified games.

[22:24] However, if you're a movie studio, you don't care really how much the manufacturer makes,

[22:30] you want to see the best representation of your product. Right. That's why we give them a

[22:36] vectorized logo that's been a mistake for the last 15 years. Just run with it, people.

[22:43] It also, it was like, it was like too brown, you know, it was kind of muddled. It was like,

[22:48] it was like, they had not great vector work. And then I think Orrick brought this up as well. They

[22:52] put on like three or four different Photoshop things like they had bevel in boss, outer glow,

[22:57] stroke. Like they were kind of like, for lack of a better word, horing up the logo to like make it

[23:03] look better. Yeah. You know, the thing is, Arda's, Arda's God in so good with so many of these new

[23:12] titles that it's glaringly not at the same level of where other stuff has been. And Jersey Jack,

[23:19] I will say this Jack's art packages for the most part have been weak in compared to what

[23:24] Stern and even spooky's games look like now. I mean, they they're just well, they don't look as good.

[23:30] He's never, he hasn't done a, you know, he hasn't only done a fully illustrated art package yet.

[23:35] Has no no. And and if you think about it, I guess that dialed in. Nobody liked it. They didn't like,

[23:40] yeah, but Johnny Aussie style. Yeah. But and Johnny Aussie did Willy Wonka, right?

[23:45] That I don't know, but Willy Wonka is basically, you know, it's a Photoshop montage game. It's very well done.

[23:52] Well, I mean, same thing with Chris Franchi. It's, you know, it's, but what you're saying with Stern,

[23:57] like everyone wants like the clean line art, zombie Eddie look because it works for both the cabinet

[24:03] and the play field. And yes, when you have like more of the painterly Johnny Aussie style,

[24:07] it seems like people aren't even really interested in that anymore. But Franchi's not Photoshop drag

[24:11] them drive. I mean, it's illustrated over. It's illustrated. But he does custom illustrations

[24:18] of the compositions for the Stern games because I thought he used some of his old stuff before,

[24:23] like with Batman. He had like the lunch box. It depends. I mean, it depends. I mean, with Batman,

[24:27] I know he had like two weeks to make the whole package. But with with other stuff, he, you know,

[24:32] it's fully illustrated. He has different source materials that might come from the studio,

[24:36] but it's all illustrated. Okay. All right. All right. Well, if you look at Guardians next to Batman,

[24:43] you'll see there's like Batman. There's a more like the gradient background. But, you know,

[24:47] the illustrations come from Franchi, but but Guardians has much more illustrations and monsters,

[24:53] even more if you look at that play field. Okay. All right. So yeah, the art. I thought for some reason

[25:00] he was reusing some of his old art. But I mean, you, you, you clearly know more about Chris Franchi

[25:05] than I do because I know you're like a big fan of his art. So no, I think he, he, he, he does

[25:09] stellar our packages. Yeah. Some of the Batman was reused. But again, like Batman was a different

[25:14] case. It was a rush job. And he's, he'll be the first one to tell you that. So let me, let's talk

[25:19] about. So now that we're on art, art versus theme versus gameplay. What do you think's most important?

[25:27] I think, I think gameplay is most important, but I don't think that's where the market is right now.

[25:36] I think people have just gone head over heels with art. And I'm not saying that art's not important,

[25:43] but I think sometimes it's over, overvalued. It's disguising a lack of other stuff in the game.

[25:51] Does that mess my up? Yeah. Oh, that's definitely what Stern does. And you know, I would hope that

[25:56] Jeremy Packard doesn't kick me in the nuts because I said that, but there's a lot of detailed artwork.

[26:03] And it does help distract you from the fact that the games are getting emptier. Let's talk about

[26:09] Black Knight being empty when you saw it. What'd you think? So I was at, I was at MGC. And I was doing

[26:17] a few laps through the hall while we're still setting up. I kind of wish MGC was open all day

[26:21] Friday, but that's a different issue. Anyway, so I come across your best friend, Hilton. And he's got

[26:27] his Black Knight pro there that he just bought. Like he bought it and then he had it at the show

[26:31] all weekend and then he took it home to route. I'm sure. Anyway, so I play it and I'm just, he was

[26:39] all excited about it. So I didn't like say how I felt, you know, I'm somewhat diplomatic in person.

[26:45] At least when I haven't been drinking. And I was, yeah, it's really not much in it. There's

[26:50] like the night, which is cool. Then the pro, there's a ramp and a habit trail returned from the ramp

[26:56] and two vux that put the ball into the habit trail. That's basically it. Like without that,

[27:01] I per play field. It's even even by stern standards. I was like, it looked shockingly empty.

[27:07] But even the upper play field, they're shockingly little to do. There's an orbit of flipper and a

[27:13] lock and that's it. Yeah, I think I only played the alley version of it. I mean, honestly, like at the

[27:21] show, I was like, I tried to get more time on Walker than Black Knight because it just seemed like

[27:25] a more interesting game. Yeah, but the upper play field didn't seem like you did a whole heck of a lot.

[27:31] Yeah, but animations are really cool. I mean, they're pretty effective. So for a game that is like

[27:38] Richie's original title, I think they just have the license the name Black Knight right from

[27:43] someone right Williams, right? Or scientific games or planetary pinball hazard or something like that

[27:49] or CGC has planetary. I don't think planetary pinball owns the rights of those games. I think they

[27:54] own like the rights to reproduce things. It's like, you know, so many doesn't own the rights of

[28:01] Spider-Man. They own the theatrical distribution rights for Spider-Man, same kind of thing. Okay.

[28:05] Anyway, I'm sure they did have to license the word Black Knight. Not an expensive thing to

[28:09] license compared to the major franchise, the Stern normally licenses. So, oh, were you expecting more?

[28:20] Where's this Richie's thing? Like flow flow flow flow flow flow. I was never a huge fan of the Black Knight

[28:25] games. Be quite honest. I know the first one's important because of his first game with the ramp.

[28:28] But there's just so much of the play field covered up. You know, the ball is going into all these

[28:32] paths and it's like, I don't know where it goes. I mean, obviously if you play the game or if you

[28:36] own the game, you start to learn. But I don't know. So, I guess I was never a huge Black Knight fan

[28:40] to begin with. But I love I love like the animations like skulls and skeletons and monsters. Like,

[28:46] I love that kind of stuff. But I think you've talked about this before with the games. They put

[28:50] everything on the LCD. It's everything's moving to the LCD and moving away from the play field.

[28:54] And that's kind of unfortunate. Okay. Right. So you're battling the Black Knight and his army,

[29:00] right? There's absolutely no army. You're battling on the play field anywhere. There's like

[29:08] skeletons. There's hydras. But nothing nothing. But look at. Okay. So imagine a game like

[29:13] monster bash where you're fighting all these different monsters. But yet the monsters are on

[29:18] the play field. Yeah. Imagine if there's only like one Dracula mech in the middle and then everything

[29:22] else is on the screen. Well, then that company, CGC, they the monster bash. What?

[29:30] Is like 6,000, 7,000. It's not that bad. The new one. No, I like the cheap one. Yeah, it's like

[29:35] 6 grand. It's like basically the price of a storm pro. Yeah. And it's got all that stuff on it.

[29:41] And so yeah, I don't know makes you think. I mean, yeah, I mean, I was just actually I was talking

[29:49] to a buddy of mine a couple days ago. And and we were talking. I came or working. We were talking

[29:54] about what he was talking about Disney world. He's like, Hey, I know how in the haunted mansion,

[29:58] they project images onto spheres to make like faces and the heads and whatnot. He's like, why

[30:04] don't people do that in a game? He's like, he was saying how he saw a redemption game, a new

[30:08] redemption game that does that, right? So you could have like a generic character, like in a

[30:12] generic baddie or a ghost or something. And you could, you know, have like a $40 projector or

[30:18] whatever. And just like shine the images on it. It's like, Oh, look, now it's this character. Now

[30:22] it's this character. No, even if you did have it just a single toy, you could use video

[30:28] change it up. But but you just like that argument about switches on the deep route.

[30:32] Yeah, let's talk about deep because I saw you in that thread too. So deep route so you know,

[30:37] it sounds like June 30th, they're they're going to give Zidware customers an option of three games

[30:44] to pick from that will be delivered within a few weeks. First of all, do you think they're going

[30:49] to hit that date? And then what do you think we can, I mean, it's all speculation. Like, are they

[30:54] going to have like different tech in the game that we've never seen before and switches, goodbye,

[30:59] optos, hello, or some new way to track the ball. Like what are your thoughts? Well, the fact that,

[31:04] I mean, you again, any sufficiently advanced company could track a pinball in their sleep. It's

[31:11] not hard at all. I mean, we have rockets that land themselves now for grind out loud. I mean,

[31:17] pinball is simple. But as I said in that thread, the kind of people that could do that all work at

[31:22] SpaceX or Tesla, they don't work for, no work for the ball industry. I know that sounds crass,

[31:27] but hey, I can't do it. And a lot of people can't do it. But if you can, go out west and make the

[31:32] mega box. But I was just, I think if anyone is going to try some innovations, it obviously will be

[31:38] a deep route. So I guess we'll see if it succeeds. I don't think they're going to make that June 30th

[31:44] date. I think in that same forum, Iceman or someone was posting and he's, I think he said there's

[31:51] three options. It's like you get your game, you get a refund or you defer the deposit forward

[31:57] to when the game is released. Right. I guess the question is that's only less than two months away.

[32:04] Right. So there's that. They also are indicating that the games will be $5,000. And you've got a wonder

[32:10] well, how much innovation and how much quality can you build into a game at that price point? We

[32:16] all saw how Thunderbirds ended up feeling. I was just going to say, I mean, you have to be in China

[32:21] or maybe Mexico to actually feel like that's where manufacturing is happening. Which is not cheap.

[32:28] She states, well, no, it's a cheaper state than Illinois or New Jersey by a long shot.

[32:36] What is the most expensive thing Ben like establishing a manufacturing facility? Isn't that super

[32:41] expensive to go from no manufacturing to building an entire company that can make a pinball game?

[32:46] Here's the thing with Deeproot. And obviously Robert is a better businessman than I am because I'm

[32:51] sure he's many, many, many multiple times richer than I am. However, like he seems to be the one

[32:57] putting the most money into actual research and development and also basically creating IP or

[33:02] story development. And you know, I would agree that little trailer that they had of the Deeproot

[33:08] wasn't anything spectacular, but at least showed their thinking about storytelling and whatnot.

[33:14] So it seems that he's spending the money on that. So why even bother with manufacturing? Why not

[33:20] just pay American pinball to do it or spooky? Although, spooky might not be big enough for his goals.

[33:25] But you know, I'm saying like why why waste the time trying to be a creative house and a

[33:30] manufacturing house when other people might have underutilized production capability that you

[33:38] could segue into? Right, but I guess the question then becomes, I mean, who's going to do that?

[33:46] Because he seemingly are competitors when it comes to because right now, even without any games

[33:51] shipping, he's competitively hurting the other manufacturers because people are holding on to their

[33:57] money, waiting to see what Deeproot delivers. So right, right, right then and there, he's a competitor.

[34:04] And yeah, I mean, you had that thing with GC headstone make medieval madness, but now they don't

[34:09] work out. So I mean, ostensibly, American pinball would be the most likely place to go and they

[34:16] move into their new factory. If they have two or three lines that they're capable of making games

[34:21] on why not do that? But I don't think they don't strike me as a company that's going to like do all

[34:27] this development and then ask someone else to make it. I just don't get that sense.

[34:32] You're right. I'm sure they're going to try to do it all down there. And again, it would make

[34:38] more sense to build something in Texas and Illinois. However, that manufacturing is, well,

[34:44] we've seen it time and time again, manufacturing is where people get fucking wrecked. I mean,

[34:48] look at the big Lebowski, they were the bells of the ball, but when the rubber hit the road and

[34:52] they're trying to build the game, they were DOA. And that's what kills you. It's like what you

[34:57] said about George Gomez. It's like they're going to get killed by contract manufacturing, but not

[35:02] to the fact that contract manufacture, but just the fact that they're even manufacturing in the first

[35:06] place. It's, there's a huge chasm as I look at my new Grand Canyon wallpaper, my computer.

[35:13] There's a huge chasm between making a working prototype game and manufacturing one.

[35:18] So I heard that and I reported something incorrectly, which I never do on this show, Ben, never.

[35:25] The screen on deeproot games will in fact be above the glass, which then makes that

[35:33] aspect ratio video seemingly point to a display that is very much like Chicago gaming companies

[35:40] wide display. It's even wider than Chicago's display though. Chicago's display is only, no, it's

[35:47] affordable. So maybe this one is a prider. So this, so then this might go across the entire

[35:54] back box at the bottom with speakers above it. Possibly it looks like I'm surprised they're not going

[36:01] to go ahead. It looks like it could run the length of the back box. Yeah, honestly, it wasn't

[36:10] see my thing is I think Roberts after Zidwares patents. It's possible that Zidwares has patents that

[36:17] could be huge gushes for other companies that could be part of the play. And I think one of the

[36:23] is screen under glass. Yes, and I don't know if it was ever granted, but John definitely

[36:28] spent a lot of time filing patents because he had a buddy that would basically do it for free,

[36:32] whereas the rest of us pay like two or three thousand dollars. You could, you know, filing a patent

[36:37] is an expensive hiring a patent lawyers will cost money, right? But not when they're your friend.

[36:42] But I don't get that bad. And because screens have been used under glass in multiple games.

[36:48] So what does it mean it hasn't been patented? But if you patent it, then you prevent other people from

[36:52] doing it. Right, but what I'm saying is is it specifically the display of the entire game has to

[37:00] be under the glass, all of us circus Voltaire, or is a screen like WankoVision, can they sue for

[37:06] something like that? I'm not a lawyer. It would be, it would be such a shame. No, I mean, I think if

[37:15] this company became a patent troll company alongside a entertainment company and started to sue

[37:21] pinball companies for their designs, like especially once it's especially anything John Poppiduke

[37:28] patent it, right? It's like if there's any man that does not deserve to hold things hostage from

[37:34] companies are actually making games, it's John Poppiduke. Yep, but you know, that's how the patent

[37:42] system works. It's like, well, yeah, it's like a patent troll. I mean, but John was like the patent

[37:48] troll because he never figured any of it out. So he gets to apply the patent, own it, and then yet

[37:53] he never has a commercial product. Then he prevents real companies from putting it into games.

[37:57] Then he's the troll. If he's going to sue you for doing it, right? But the thing is,

[38:07] he would be within his legal right to do so, even if it seems like bullshit. I know, but that's

[38:12] a definition of patent trolls is like they own the rights to the troll the people who want to use the

[38:17] patent. Or well, there is an episode of Silicon Valley about that where this basically they have,

[38:24] someone will have a patent that's very broad. And so they can even if another company's not in

[38:28] violation of it, there's risk of them being in violation of it where it's actually, well, and

[38:33] while that episode, the thing was the patent troll base and he just wanted to shake them down

[38:36] like 50 grand or whatever. Yeah, I'm just saying, I keep thinking about the Zidware thing and I'm like,

[38:43] all it was was art, right? Stern saved Zidware the right way by hiring Jeremy.

[38:48] What was left, right? So who knows what the play is. However, I mean, they seem committed to

[38:57] you know, technological innovation, although I will say this. How do we know that? How do we know

[39:02] that? Who's there? They're deep. And then a lot of money. Yeah, deeper. They're at least trying

[39:08] something different. But how do we even know that? You know what I'm saying? I'm just playing

[39:12] devil's advocate a little bit because I've been there's SCC filings. I mean, it's public record. How

[39:17] much money they raised. Right. So I guess the point is we know that they've raised money. We know

[39:22] they hired a huge team. How do we know they've successfully done things in pinball that are truly

[39:28] innovative? We don't. Well, we won't not until we cease. However, the amount of people they've hired

[39:34] and the Jean-Raz or industries they've hired them from tells me that they are attempting some sort

[39:40] of innovation, especially in the scheme of storytelling, although they could go too far with that and

[39:44] make a game that just won't shut the fuck up. So you think like they like the ghost game I made,

[39:48] which had too much storytelling. Yeah, no, it was just the greatest journey of pinball. Ben,

[39:54] do you think they're going to try and bite off more than they can chew? Clearly, they're doing

[39:58] more than pinball. There's other IP going on and development and games and whatnot. Do you think

[40:03] this is a mistake to try and do all this at once? Well, regarding the June 30th date, that was

[40:10] set over a year ago when they first announced their plans. That was also set well before they

[40:16] missed their GPF reveal. So I would say the fact that they canceled TPF as early as they did

[40:24] means they're further behind than they thought they would be. That doesn't really answer your

[40:30] question, but that's just my take on the situation. June 30th is just the maker break date for,

[40:35] because that's where there's actual money on the line and a contract sign between the Zidware

[40:42] customers and Robert. But I'm seeing from like a week ago, you know, Robert is telling people,

[40:49] we're hitting it. Like it's until he says we're not going to hit June 30th, he listens to this

[40:55] show. He's got my email. So I talked to Robert. Like that he should tell us now he's not going to

[41:01] hit. They're going to they're going to have a game or three games. They're apparently. So this

[41:07] is the other interesting question is because we don't know what Zidware, not Zidware, Deeproot games

[41:11] are alike. So if he's saying you can choose from one of three games, like what does that mean,

[41:16] right? Like it is other swappable parts of the games. I don't think so. Does it mean like you buy

[41:21] a cabinet like a P3 multi more for a game? I thought he was working on like five titles at once.

[41:26] 12 whitewoods, he said more than 12. He said more than 12 white lights. Gosh.

[41:33] I bet that's a lot. I bet Robert's going to go to the customers. Be like, hey guys,

[41:37] I'm here to offer you one of three games. The names of those games are Lexi Light Speed,

[41:42] Cosmic Cart Racing and Canon Lagoon, which one you want? Oh gosh. Yeah. I still think Canon Lagoon's

[41:50] like the best game Jerry ever made. I love the game with like the when you're you battle someone

[41:55] and there's like the rocks and they pop up and you have to maybe is that not the rocks one?

[41:59] Is that Canon Lagoon? And maybe it is the Canon Lagoon is the one where they've got a LCD

[42:04] in the under the glass in the back and there's ships going back and forth and you fire balls

[42:09] with them to sink them. And that's it. You don't have to explain to the player what to do. That's

[42:13] kind of game people should be making. So speaking of innovation, something I know we wanted to talk

[42:18] about was internet connectivity with pinball. Yes. And it's implications. It's feasibility

[42:25] and should we ever implement it into pinball? What are your thoughts? You've heard my take on this.

[42:31] I think it's going to be a game changer. Okay. Yeah. So yes, I've heard that because I listened,

[42:37] I do listen to your podcast. There's a few there's a few things about it that I don't necessarily

[42:42] agree with or think are feasible. The biggest one being head to head play. And mainly because

[42:50] I think the chances of being online, well, someone else is online with a pinball machine that sold

[42:56] units of thousands is very, very low. Obviously, you'd have to basically set this match up

[43:02] manually with a friend like an old doom server. If only there was a website Ben where like

[43:06] thousands of pinball owners were on all the time with nothing better to do.

[43:12] Oh, that's okay. That's actually a good idea. It's

[43:17] okay. So I set up a pinside chat room. Hey, who with an ACDC wants to play right now?

[43:24] Right. So, you know, I played video games, right? And I want to have been playing the most lately

[43:28] is Call of Duty blackout the Battle Royale and Call of Duty. Right. And so that's a game that sold

[43:35] like 20 million plus units or whatever. And after about four months of release, like you can wait

[43:42] like a minute or two to get into a match with a game that costs $60 that 20 million people bought.

[43:49] So I just think about those those things scaled down and not just scaled down, but you're scaling

[43:55] also you're scaling up the age. So instead of like, you know, it might suck that everyone on an

[44:00] online video game is a racist teen year old kid. However, there were warm bodies whereas pinball,

[44:07] the demographic skews older. So people have less time and availability. So that's one of my issues.

[44:14] But yeah, there was some sort of matchmaking or scheduling. Then it could work that but that

[44:19] just gets you to the connected part though. Like how exactly would it work in game? Because like,

[44:23] what if one player drains way faster than you? Like it's just like a race for points or I would

[44:27] have worked. Well, I think you'd have to have much like other games online play. It would be

[44:33] completely different than the traditional like mode based journey as a single player game. I

[44:39] think you'd have to you'd have to figure that part out, right? And that's where I was like,

[44:45] so here's where I think it works. So you you either do like, it would be more like about time

[44:51] to play. So let's say you and I both have Batman 66 and when we do you versus me, it's just a five

[44:59] minute game. When you drain, you just, it just, you know, it reshoots the ball and we've got five.

[45:05] So it'd be like, why not? Yeah, why not? It would be like, it would be like safe, safe cracker.

[45:10] That game where that same thing, it's like a timed game. It doesn't matter. It's a time

[45:14] dream. And it's whoever scores the most, whoever jails the most villains by the end of five minutes

[45:18] wins. And that's it. And then you and I can have a five minute pinball experience head to head.

[45:22] And so yeah, is it going to is it going to do a webcam with the screen?

[45:27] And the camera wants to see you and you're going to watch me play, you know, I'm going to play bearback

[45:33] to distract you from it.

[45:37] I guess, I mean, that that could work if you would need some sort of portal or some easy way to connect.

[45:44] Like, like, it would need like the intercell phone connectivity. What, or, you know, maybe your cell phone,

[45:50] or you could set up a friend's list. I just, I don't know, I just have a feeling.

[45:56] I get what you're saying. And again, like, I don't, I guess the question would be this.

[46:01] And this is a metaphor I hear at work every day. Is the juice worth the squeeze? So the amount of money

[46:07] would be right to set up that network to set up all that stuff. Would it be worth it to do all that

[46:13] and network these games? If the, you know, only five percent of people are ever going to utilize it

[46:18] because then you got to think about the R&D cost into making those modes for network play. You

[46:23] got to the cost of running the servers, all that stuff, right? But my point is yes, for $9,000,

[46:30] these $3,000 Stern machines, that's where the cost should be. For nine grand, I want my goddamn

[46:38] pinball toy to be connected to the internet, which everything else I use in my life is connected to

[46:43] for far less than $9,000. You've definitely, and you're, huh? And a modern, a modern car certainly

[46:49] is connected. I mean, it's more expensive than pinball, but yeah, but people wouldn't accept a

[46:55] non-internet connected car nowadays, same kind of thing. But I have to assume the cost to connect

[47:00] to the internet for devices is pretty damn cheap in 2019. You know, I really couldn't tell you

[47:06] what the development cost would be. You would need an additional FCC certification because you're

[47:12] an intentionally wireless ice, you know, Wi-Fi. But again, I don't think it would be that huge of

[47:19] a deal in the grand scheme of things. I know one thing companies think about or worry about is

[47:24] attack vectors, right? Again, like we talk about like our cell phones and operating system. And

[47:32] these are products made by companies infinitesimally larger than the pinball industry. What is that

[47:38] phrase? That's a phrase most of my listeners, is that like getting hacked by somebody?

[47:43] Yes, yes. So I don't know why someone would try to hack into a PIMO machine, but you know,

[47:47] people try to run doom on old printers. Yeah. So you'd have to figure out all the possible ways

[47:54] that it could be hacked. And like even if they can't, you know, they could steal your personal info,

[47:58] they could steal your location. If you are an operator and you were like paranoid, they could try

[48:03] to figure out your earnings and then maybe try to come into your market like, oh, that bar.

[48:08] Guard is the galaxy. That's really well at the spa. I'm going there and try to get my games in.

[48:11] I'm going to pay the world's greatest computer hacker to hack into all of Hilton's games. And so

[48:16] the only audio that can play is Kaden Ijo on all of his games. Oh, God, he would love that.

[48:24] Oh, I'm sure that's part of the trepidation for. I mean, there's no reason these systems couldn't

[48:29] go online. Like you can go online with a super wimpy microcontroller. So certainly what they've

[48:34] got in these games now could do it. I mean, you know, it's good. Well, they would just don't fight

[48:39] on goal. So versus mode is is one thing we, you know, we talked about there is a way to do it. It's

[48:44] completely different way of playing PIMBALL. That's the other thing. Just keep thinking about with PIMBALL.

[48:49] And he's not even as I watched these PIMBALL tournaments, which I have to be honest, they bore me.

[48:54] Because the notion of watching someone play like a 20 to 30 minute game has no appeal. And

[49:00] I'm still shocked that nobody out in the PIMBALL tournament world has understood if you want more

[49:04] people to even play competitively a clock, a countdown, where you only have a certain amount of time,

[49:11] is more enjoyable than the way it currently goes. That's that's for for the viewer for sure.

[49:18] They might they might not want to play that way. But there's a reason why

[49:23] you know, when you watch a basketball game, there's a clock. Like some sports have clocks and some

[49:27] sports have innings and some sports, I guess go to the you reach a certain score, but I think PIMBALL

[49:35] would be better served with a clock. Is there any sport where there's not a clock? I can't even think of it.

[49:41] Baseball has no clock. I mean, you just go innings. You can play a base. That's still a unit of

[49:47] time based off. Okay. Yeah, but you're right. So code wise, it wouldn't even be that big deal. You

[49:56] would just say drains don't matter. And you've got 10 minutes to play. So whoever gets the most points

[50:01] in 10 minutes, because again, like what happens if one person whiffs all three balls and they're

[50:06] sitting there watching another person play for half an hour. Right. So yeah, you definitely want to

[50:10] avoid those sort of things. So by making a time limit, you're right. That would solve that problem.

[50:14] Also, maybe help if there was a time limit on how long you could cradle the ball in a tournament

[50:19] play. Because think about it. They can hold the ball for like two minutes while they're lining up

[50:25] their show. True, but if you're cradling the ball, you're not making points. But there's no, but there's

[50:30] no clock. So it doesn't matter. They can, you know what I'm saying? Like if there was a, yes, yes,

[50:36] but if there was a, there is a block. Yes. So if there was a clock, you're right. There would be no

[50:41] point in cradling because you'd be, you'd be at a disadvantage. But currently, it's the way

[50:46] these pinball tournaments are working right now. And that's why I think they're boring to watch.

[50:50] Is these games go on forever? And it's like, and then a tournament, a pinball tournament is like an

[50:55] 18 hour venture. Like what are we doing here? Anyway, yeah, it seems like at all the shows, the tournament

[51:02] always goes long or they have to go into the run. Actively make it short. Those guys look like they

[51:08] just crawled out of Vietnam at the end of a pinball tournament. Yeah, it's, it's, well, you know

[51:16] what? That's their thing. I mean, it's, it's why are they tortured? I was when they could just

[51:20] probably condense it down to, if they each got five minute, you know, and it was like a round,

[51:25] like like a bracket at tournament with five minutes per round. But you know, always just going to say,

[51:31] you know what else is weird? Like if you think about pinball machines that have fundamentally changed

[51:35] the way they work, like safe cracker or flipper football, they, they fail as well. So that's something

[51:41] else to consider. But yeah, you're right. They should, well, not just head to head play for online.

[51:46] They should be online, but they should update themselves. They could have like weekly specials or

[51:52] weekly events, right? You could have things based off data, you know, like what I told you, but I

[51:59] thought it'd be cool to make like a rampage pinball machine. I told you that before, right? Yeah.

[52:03] Let me need. Right. Right. So you know, that take all these random cities. So you could actually

[52:08] like go online and get the city data. I'm like, Oh, okay, the city has this many people in it.

[52:13] Like you could use internet data to procedurally generate rules based off where you are.

[52:17] Right. And you could also have weather effects or, you know, like, oh, this got this many buildings

[52:21] and this many people. And you know, you could do things like that. Like people complain about rules.

[52:26] Like with the internet and, you know, you know, calling data from anywhere, basically,

[52:30] so many public public available sources, you could, you could basically, uh,

[52:33] procedurally generate rules based off things that are random. Like we've talked nature,

[52:39] traffic even. We've talked a lot about creativity and pinball. The coding of a game and the

[52:47] coding of the experience is so much of where creativity can occur. And I think it doesn't occur

[52:53] at all. I think people still approach these games the same way over the last 30, 40 years. I'll

[52:57] give you an example. I'm looking at Batman 66. If I have a kid and I want him to learn how to play

[53:03] Batman and just learn how to shoot, maybe create a ball. Why isn't there just a mode for like a

[53:09] junior beginner level mode in which it's just the crane going back and forth and saying how many

[53:13] times can you hit the crane in like five minutes or two minutes? And that's it. Video games,

[53:18] video games have things like that already. Why is, why is none of that? None of that coding

[53:24] to modern pinball? Well, I think it's because pinball is still meant to be a very immediate arcade

[53:31] experience, but basically wants to suck the money out of your pocket as quickly as possible.

[53:35] And a lot of things we're talking about definitely sound more like home use video game aspects.

[53:40] Right. But I mean, like I just mentioned my buddy who stopped by and like he's an operator. He

[53:45] doesn't bother with pinball machines because they don't make money. Like why buy a pin when he can

[53:49] get one of those kitty gambling coin push or key master machines and make 10 times the money.

[53:54] Right. So I mean, but some people like to operate like, yeah, but that's not to me. That's always like

[54:01] the the dichotomy and maybe even like the bi polar problem I have with the way pinball machines

[54:07] are approached these days because if you just want a fast game that's brutal and like it's still fun

[54:11] but people drain quickly and just make another TNA or black night and put it on location,

[54:15] you'll make more money with a game like Ghostbusters is the ultimate earner because it's the ultimate

[54:20] drain fest, but it's got a thing everybody loves and a good. Deadpool does really well from what I

[54:26] hear. Yeah, because it's it's a it's a theme people under 50 are familiar with. So yeah, I guess

[54:32] the thing is I think we're at a state because there are so many games out there where do you think

[54:38] these companies are creatively looking at these machines and saying, are we giving the home use buyer?

[54:45] All we can in terms of it reimagining what people want in a game in their home because right now

[54:50] it's just one size fits all like same game in your home as location as in tournaments. One size fits

[54:56] pretty much. Well, I mean, on top of that, Stern's programming like what two different

[55:01] sets of code for the pro and the premium. So maybe they just don't have the resources to make

[55:05] different versions. I don't know. I mean, you think here's something to think about. If you think

[55:10] about rules and pinball or code, it's basically static. I mean, you can stack things and you can

[55:15] have different approaches, but there's still only so many ways you can come at it, right? Now compare

[55:20] that to something like Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption where it's this very well-programmed

[55:26] world and you can kind of create the scenarios, you know, like you can you can create the fun. Like,

[55:32] oh, you know, I've got 10 bear pelt on my horse and my crashing into train and see what happens or

[55:38] you know, I'm going to do this with a helicopter. But again, those games have armies of people

[55:42] programming them, programming these advanced world, whereas pinball is much more limited. But so,

[55:48] yeah, I if there was a way to make games have more divergent or procedural gameplay, I think that'd

[55:54] be really cool because in a way they would never get old. It would be like a roguelike. It would

[56:00] like generate itself. Yeah, I mean, it's the balance, right? Because we saw Pirates of the Caribbean

[56:06] with, you know, choose from 22 different characters and every game is will be different because of

[56:11] all the different possibilities. And then people were like, that was too confusing for me. But I do

[56:17] think there's a middle ground in which you might be able to shape your own adventure a little bit more

[56:21] with more control without it being too complex, right? I think that that balance is a little bit hard.

[56:27] But my hope thing is that's what I just want to do. That they made excites me the most about

[56:32] deep route is I is what I hope they do is I hope they reimagine what the experience can be.

[56:39] But still keep the magic, the physical magic under the glass that is what pinball needs to be.

[56:48] Yes, going back to medieval madness, you don't have to explain castle seizures to people.

[56:56] Everyone goes to school and they hear about medieval times. You don't have to explain a draw of

[57:01] Ridge or Port-Claus or destroying a castle, right? It's like it's so self-evident. And all of that

[57:07] game is on the play field. Like, oh, I destroyed a castle. And that's why that game still earns, you know,

[57:13] decades later. And I think we need more of that. Even if the toys, I mean, I also, you don't have to

[57:18] explain a knight to people either, like with black knight. But I just don't, it's not really satisfying

[57:23] to see a castle break. Yeah, so I think if there was, if people were smart about what they put in the

[57:30] play field, like, make games that don't need to be explained. Like, do the plate. Do you think

[57:36] you need to explain Martian's land on a nuclear power plant that was built on top of an amusement

[57:42] park if that's completely infected by zombies? Is that too much? Well, the video explains it so

[57:50] clearly it needed to be explained. It was a pretty clearly though. I think that was, I think they

[57:56] did a good job for something that had four elements going on. And concisely, and in a way that was,

[58:02] you know, quite, it was well aware of how stupid it was. Right. You know, like the irony was built

[58:07] into it. Well, I was, well, one thing, I think Aaron Davis and I were talking about this years ago,

[58:11] but like, we were talking about like a minecraft pinball machine was made, although I think,

[58:16] well, minecraft is totally done now. Kids only care about Fortnite. But, you know, you'd have a section,

[58:21] like a grid of blocks, like block drop targets and you shoot them and they drop, you'd like to be

[58:26] chipping away. Like you wouldn't have to explain that to anyone. And I don't know, that's the kind of

[58:31] things I'd like to see in a play field like you walk up and you don't need to be, you don't need to be

[58:36] told what to do. You can figure it out physically because of what the ball does and how it reacts

[58:41] with the environment. But then you can also obviously have more depth for the advanced players.

[58:46] Right. That's what I'd like to see. So how 2019, are we over saturated right now, even before

[58:53] deep route? Well, it's really that much being released. I mean, Stern has the normal schedule.

[59:00] Then we have, I mean, what else is really coming out? It feels like we're in a low right now.

[59:04] If for sure, I mean, it is a, it is a pinball buyers market of used games right now. There are

[59:10] so many games people have up for sale. I mean, right now the next game is either going to be Jurassic

[59:16] World or Godzilla. I would think Jurassic World, because I heard Stern was going to do that years

[59:23] ago. It makes sense, actually. Does it? But the movie was like two years ago. What is it?

[59:28] Godzilla is coming out this year. Yeah. Oh, so you think they're going to do the Godzilla

[59:37] King in the Monsters Godzilla like the new movie? I heard they don't have that. It hurts like the

[59:42] Toho one. Is that it? Is that right? Well, I mean, they, they mostly did that just to spooky. I

[59:48] mean, I don't think they had much of a plan beyond that. It's all the same Godzilla to me to be

[59:53] honest. I gotta be honest. I don't like, I don't know. I do like compartmentalizes their Godzilla's,

[59:58] but apparently there's different ones. Are you, are you kidding? So like the, the Brian

[01:00:03] Cranston Godzilla, I think was acceptable to Godzilla fans. The 1998 one was, they hated it.

[01:00:11] And then for most Godzilla fans, it's classic Godzilla, like the Toho made in Japan.

[01:00:16] So this one, this King in the Monsters one that there's that Toho the new movie?

[01:00:21] No, it's the it's Warner Brothers. It's the sequel to the 2013 movie by Gareth Edwards.

[01:00:28] Okay. The one that made you think Brian Cranston was a star and he died in the first five minutes.

[01:00:33] Yeah, they're wanting. Yeah, yeah. So it was, it was Godzilla then Kong Skull Island,

[01:00:37] which is the same universe. And now Godzilla looking at the monsters. So it's basically,

[01:00:42] get ready to roll your eyes. It's a giant monster shared universe. Gotcha. Yeah, they did a bad job.

[01:00:49] I was gonna, I was gonna, well, yeah, because you were in a wherever. I was gonna say one more thing.

[01:00:55] Like if, if you said to me, like, oh, what should we make Jurassic World or Godzilla? I would say

[01:00:59] Jurassic World because we just talked about games earning on locations.

[01:01:04] Millennials are spending all their money at bars. Like they're like, that's all they do. They

[01:01:08] don't buy houses. They don't buy cars. They don't even buy TVs. They just go drink.

[01:01:13] And they're the ones, they're the ones dropping money into like Deadpool and they love Jurassic Park.

[01:01:18] They worship that film. Right. That's why I think that would be, I mean, if you're,

[01:01:22] if you want to get money on location from like 30 year olds, that would be a great title. Even though,

[01:01:28] well, Jurassic World isn't same as Jurassic Park, but it's close enough. Right. Yeah, I don't think

[01:01:34] the, the game is going to resonate with as many of the stern, like, new-in-box collectors, but

[01:01:42] we'll see because like, there, no one really knows who's designing it. It's gotta be, it's,

[01:01:46] I keep hearing it's not Brian Eddie, so then it has to be Keith L when I would assume is next.

[01:01:53] Uh, I have no idea. Because board just did monsters. Gomez just did Deadpool and,

[01:02:01] and I don't know. Maybe it's Gomez. We'll see. So, uh, what, what, uh, what's next for Ben Hack?

[01:02:08] Before we get to our out here, give us the juice. Oh, yes. Well, I haven't been working on

[01:02:14] any pinball stuff. Well, maybe a little. I've been talking with the idea of doing a new controller board.

[01:02:20] I've just been, everyone asks me, what are you doing now? It's like this big mystery.

[01:02:24] I dug up part of my driveway that that was fun. Uh, and now I'm filling it back in. I was redoing

[01:02:31] electrical. So that's something that I did. Can it is paving podcasts I should do. I was gonna,

[01:02:35] I want to corner like all these different like random verticals. Like, can it is rocking chair

[01:02:39] podcasts where I just go off on rocking chair designs these days? For there are rocking chair enthusiasts

[01:02:46] who would be like, do there's a podcast. I should do a wheel of like what community will

[01:02:52] I infiltrate and troll next year? And will I be their best podcast out there? There's probably

[01:03:00] a community of like, you know, like seven-year-old woodworking guys who make rocking chairs or,

[01:03:05] or I, well, I bet this is probably a big omniscient thing too. Oh, I guess.

[01:03:11] Would you, if you could, if you could, if you could, a lot of home remodel, but that's not

[01:03:16] interesting to people. If you could go work at one of these companies, I think I always ask you

[01:03:19] this. I'll ask you again, but like, which one would you want to be at right now? If you could

[01:03:25] take the reins and just be like, would it be American pinball? Would you lock normal and dava on a

[01:03:31] room until you actually had a good art package? Would you, would you go over to Jersey Jack and get

[01:03:36] more of a bomb and more, you know, toys to play with? Would you go to Stern and actually know your

[01:03:40] game's gonna be made? Oh, I don't think Stern would ever want me. Oh, I don't know. I mean,

[01:03:47] I don't know. I mean, I think J.J.P might be kind of cool. I don't know if, I know, I still have

[01:03:54] my unfinished game at spooky, but that thing will probably, you know, maybe it'll get released in

[01:03:59] 40 years, you know, they'll dig it up from some archaeological site or something. Do they own it?

[01:04:03] I don't, or do you own it? Yes, because I was on retainer when I designed it. Okay.

[01:04:08] Alice Cooper is finally shipping. It sounds like, you know, the game's turned a corner and the code

[01:04:14] is great and animations are great and, you know, I think people are getting past the tight shots.

[01:04:18] What's it like seeing that game finally shipped for you? Well, it was the last PIML machine that I

[01:04:25] worked on. Well, you know, Charlie and I had many, many, many, many arguments about it, but in the end,

[01:04:32] I mean, still a lot of the DNA that David Van S and I put into it is still there. I know they have

[01:04:38] Bowen working on the rules with David Fosman, but the basic idea of traveling through rooms,

[01:04:46] fighting monsters and collecting items which give you modifiers against the monsters,

[01:04:51] that's still there and that was basically something that I came up with and I think that's still

[01:04:55] cool because when we were talking about rules a little while back and, you know, you're traversing

[01:04:59] through the castle, right? Right. And when you start, when you start your journey, the monsters

[01:05:05] are already selected. So once you get to the end of the castle, you're going to fight, you know,

[01:05:09] pit creature or whatever, right? And then there's three things that could affect each monster,

[01:05:17] right? So like if you're fighting like the tentacle monster, it's like salt from the kitchen and like

[01:05:23] shears from the garden or, you know, things like that. The thing is you can never collect all three.

[01:05:28] They're arranged and deposited around the castle in such a way that you'll never get all three,

[01:05:33] you can only get two at most, right? And that's so when you get to the monster, you never have

[01:05:39] all three possible modifiers, which means there's always a different way to approach it. Gotcha.

[01:05:44] So that was, so in that case I used the geography of the castle to limit the amount of effects you

[01:05:51] could have when you get to the monster to hopefully give it more depth. So we'll see.

[01:05:56] Little rocks, paper, scissors decision to make when you're battling him compared to, you know,

[01:06:00] depending on what you got. Okay, cool. Now would you ever own an Alice Cooper's name or castle

[01:06:05] since you worked on it? It would not be no. I don't even have my own game. I don't.

[01:06:15] Why not? I think if I was so sick of it, but how am I was done with it? Charlie was going to give

[01:06:21] me like the beat or one. I'm like, you know what? I don't even want to look at this thing anymore.

[01:06:26] Orcs orcs, orcs like the same way with Ali and he's just like, I just, I just wouldn't,

[01:06:30] it wouldn't make me smile seeing it every day in my home. It would be like a Vietnam that

[01:06:37] having a big poster of apocalypse wall, apocalypse now on their wall. That's probably a bit of

[01:06:42] extreme of an example. Yeah, I think all the tournament guys have that in their house.

[01:06:48] I think if you're not completely sick of something by time you're done with it,

[01:06:52] you didn't work on it hard enough. I agree. I mean, I'm even like, I used to be the biggest

[01:06:57] guns in our own as a fan, but after all the stuff I did in the marketing world and seeing them so

[01:07:02] many times, I'm just like, I don't know if I even want to own the pen because I'm just kind of

[01:07:06] get tired of stuff that you've just spent so many hours thinking about. I agree. Yeah, I think about

[01:07:11] think about like David Fosma like if he hears a Rob Zombie song, he probably would throw

[01:07:16] us a brick at the radio. Amazing, amazing. Well, Ben, always a pleasure. We are right on the one

[01:07:22] hour mark, which I love to keep these interviews to and we will do this again soon. You know, let's,

[01:07:27] I think we're going to have a lot to talk about the next couple of months when deep root comes out

[01:07:31] and reveals something, hopefully by June 30th. And also we might see Jurassic World in that time frame

[01:07:38] as well. So we'll get you back on soon. Always a pleasure. Sounds good. All right, well,

[01:07:43] I'll talk to you later. All right, later Ben.
