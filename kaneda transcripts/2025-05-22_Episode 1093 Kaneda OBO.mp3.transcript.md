[00:00] Curious about the boat that I must travel? Curious about the darkness of the night?

[00:30] I'm hearing stuff from them that it's loaded and then I'm hearing stuff from people that

[00:35] say they know people that have seen the game and it's empty. I don't know who to believe.

[00:40] I love those people, right? Oh, I know somebody who saw it and you're like, well who? They're

[00:44] like, I can't tell you. This is the dumbest hobby when it comes to secrets. You know something

[00:51] about him, ball. Guess what? Nobody cares. Nobody cares. You can't go anywhere in this

[00:59] world. There's only like a few hundred people that really do care. What would happen? Let

[01:04] me just do a hypothetical here. What would happen if all of the pinball companies releases

[01:10] for now until the end of 2026? What would happen if they all leaked? Just think about

[01:17] it. What would happen? Would Spooky sell any less Beetlejuice games? Would Stern sell any

[01:23] less Pokemon or Star Wars? Would Back to the Future struggle to sell? Would? Let's see.

[01:30] What else do we know is around the corner? No one's going to buy a Cuphead. It doesn't

[01:34] matter. You know what I'm saying? It's like we kind of already know. The only games we

[01:38] don't know for sure right now, but we're going to find out before they even come out is Steve

[01:43] Richie's next game. Look, I don't think we're going to get Steve Richie's next game. I'm

[01:47] just going to say this. I don't even think we're going to get it. Anytime in 2026, I

[01:51] think Harry Potter is going to take over the line for a long time. I'm hearing that Steve

[01:56] Richie's game is delayed. It's so stupid. He would just say that. I feel stupid. I feel

[02:00] dumber saying Steve Richie's game is delayed. It's maybe a little slower than normal in the

[02:07] development of the game, but who can even say it's delayed? Nothing's delayed. Harry

[02:13] Potter's not delayed. Back to the Future is not delayed. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[02:20] It's not even really delayed. They said they were going to get all the games out by the

[02:23] end of the year. Guess what? It's not the end of the year. Now, what I want to talk about

[02:28] on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast, I want to talk about Predator. Do we think

[02:33] the Pinball Brothers can make a great Predator machine? Now that we've seen the underside

[02:38] of the playfield, it looks like there's going to be four pop bumpers. Four. And is it going

[02:44] to sort of try to create some machine gun kind of action? We know it's a wide body. Now,

[02:50] if you've stood over the wide body of Alien, it's a wide game. For some reason, that game

[02:56] feels wider than Evil Dead. Is it? I want to take a tape measure because Alien is like

[03:03] so wide. When you walk up to it, it feels like you're walking past two stern machines

[03:10] when you walk past one alien machine. Now, this game, I'm just feeling like, I don't know,

[03:17] these guys feel pretty confident about it. I think they know they have a theme that some

[03:23] of us like. I made a joke. Real men are into Predator and not Harry Potter. It's a joke.

[03:29] I'm being satirical. Like I just posted on Facebook that Harry Potter is going to come

[03:33] out two weeks after it comes out. Do you get the joke people? Because Pinsides making fun of me

[03:42] that on May 6, I said that Harry Potter was going to be out in two weeks and distros were told to

[03:48] get ready for it. Now look, they were and it's not out. And guess what? I don't care. I don't care

[03:54] because I'll tell you what I'm not going to do. Come release week of Harry Potter. What I'm not

[03:59] going to do is order one for $15,000. I don't see the point unless they limit the number of CEs.

[04:08] There is no reason why any of us should order it right away. Let the dealers and the distros

[04:15] load up on this thing and they're going to make so many of them. I think it's going to be G&R

[04:20] all over again. I do. It's going to be interesting. I'm so curious with Potter that all three models

[04:27] of the game are the same mechanically. That makes me worry that it's not loaded. Because think about

[04:35] it. How can they sell it for 10 and 15? So there's $5,000 in additional cosmetic things that are not

[04:47] on the play field. Think about that. Is there going to be like, I don't know, Radcals and anti-reflective

[04:54] glass, a shaker motor, and what else? Speaker lights and they might take out the expression

[05:01] lighting thing they use. I don't know what they're called. The Hot Rails. But $5,000 difference.

[05:08] That's insane if none of the mechanical stuff is different. So we shall see. Everyone's just

[05:14] tired of speculating. I'm a little worried now that Jersey Jack is waiting a little too long.

[05:19] I do. I feel like people are kind of burnt out on Harry Potter. The moment it comes out,

[05:23] it's going to feel like it's been out already for two years. What's weird about the Potter launch

[05:29] is the way they're just not following up that letter that something's coming and then nothing,

[05:35] nothing, not even another letter. What Harry's too busy to write us and then wax seal it. Then the

[05:41] envelope is still sealed while the letter is out of the envelope. Did you see that teaser? It made

[05:47] no sense. Why is the letter out of the envelope if the envelope is sealed shut? Details matter.

[05:56] So what details do you want to see in Predator? First of all, it has to be the first movie and

[06:01] obviously it has to have Arnold. If it's not the first movie and it doesn't have Arnold,

[06:06] I think that's a deal breaker for almost everybody. Now, from a mech standpoint, you got to have a

[06:12] chopper. Ironically, they put a chopper into Abba pinball because of some album cover. So maybe

[06:19] they're going to use the same mechanism. That would be funny. You got to have a jungle and maybe

[06:24] those four pop bumpers are trees in the jungle and maybe the predator is jumping across the top.

[06:30] Maybe it's something like that. You got to have that Gatling gun, the one Jesse the body has,

[06:35] right? If there ever was a game where you need to load up a machine gun to fire into the jungle,

[06:42] it's predator. I mean, that's what they do in the movie. That's one of the most iconic scenes in

[06:45] the movie. When Jesse the body gets his entire chest blown open, they pick up his like Sambini

[06:52] gun, whatever the name of it is. You know how we all know the name of that gun? If you're a nerve

[06:56] like me, Arnold uses the same gun in Terminator 2. I don't know if he's in the helicopter. I think

[07:02] he's in the building. He's just like leveling the building. And one of the LAPD guys says it like,

[07:07] oh, he's got a Zambini gun, something like that. I don't know Zambini, Zamboni. This is not like

[07:12] an ice cleaner. This is a damn machine gun. So I think this game should have some sort of machine

[07:17] gun. I don't think it's going to be like John Wick and without guns. You also got to have the

[07:22] predator. Now, we know that predator by Kevin Coolick famously failed at trying to use the UV

[07:29] black light to do the blood of the predator, right? That bright green blood iconic movie scene,

[07:36] right? First time ever, I think in any movie, a creature has bled. This green ooze that's

[07:42] bioluminescent. Are they going to be able to incorporate that into the game? What's funny

[07:47] about UV lighting is only one game ever has really done it successful. And that is stranger things.

[07:55] It is one of the coolest moments in all of modern pinball. When you go into the upside down,

[08:01] and then you look at Avatar really bad, really poorly done, and Kevin Coolick could never get

[08:07] it to work in his predator. So we'll see if they try to do that. The other thing you need in predator,

[08:14] you need the camouflage, right? You need somehow to find a way creatively under glass

[08:22] to sort of create it. So the predator goes from being in that mirrored camouflage look

[08:28] to then revealing himself, maybe just his eyes glow. But how are they going to do that? You know

[08:34] what they need to have in this game? And I said it earlier, there needs to be a topper for predator

[08:40] that has his head and shoulder. And on it, it's got his laser pointer. And what should happen in this

[08:47] game is that laser pointer at different times in the game should turn on and appear on your chest

[08:55] and move across you the way it does in the movie. How cool would that be? How cool would it be if

[09:01] they could program it where it could move across you to your left arm or your right arm to signify

[09:07] something going on with the gameplay itself? I mean, that's creativity. It's right there,

[09:13] staring them in the face. But again, it's the pinball brothers. These guys are not known for

[09:20] making great games. So we'll see what's going to happen. Now we do know that predator is in a box.

[09:27] I shared the photo. So it is close. Like wherever that box is, if someone gets an exacto knife and

[09:33] opens it up, we could see predator. So I think we're going to see this game pretty soon. They've

[09:38] been telling us that they've set the release date a while ago and nothing has changed. Here's my

[09:43] guest. And I'm going to give credit to my boy, Melvin Williams over there at DPX. I think it's

[09:49] going to be June 12. June 12 is the day the Predator movie came out in 1987. It's not an

[09:56] anniversary year, but it's still the day that Predator came into the world. So I think we're

[10:02] going to see on June 12, Predator pinball. It's weird. I'm like, oh, that feels like right when

[10:07] Harry Potter is going to launch, but we don't know when Harry Potter is going to launch.

[10:11] Harry Potter was supposed to be out two weeks ago. I don't know. So time will tell. I think

[10:15] everyone's feeling right now the same way. I feel like we all just want to hit game.

[10:19] We want something that makes us go, wow, it wasn't King Kong. It wasn't Dune. The last game that really

[10:27] made everybody go, that's really awesome was Evil Dead. Since then, nothing and Evil Dead was December.

[10:34] So December, January, February, March, April, May, here we are almost in the June. We're like six

[10:42] months into the year. Half of the pinball year has gone by and nothing's really blown us away.

[10:50] And maybe this might be a scary thing. Maybe we're getting to the point where unless these companies

[10:58] put more creativity into these games, like a lot more, nothing ever is going to really blow us away

[11:06] again because there's just been so many great games. And those great games have raised the bar

[11:13] so much that the new stuff just doesn't hit anymore like the old stuff. You know what I'm saying?

[11:20] Because we've seen so much Zambietti. We've seen so much of this, so much of that, so much of

[11:25] Frenchy, so much of all these different designers. And it's not feeling new. It's not feeling original.

[11:32] And then when people try to get more creative, like X-Men's layout, look what happens. And now I'm

[11:38] reading reports to Dungeons and Dragons owners. Playfields are falling apart on some of the games.

[11:45] And what the owners are being told is to put Mylar over the damage. That is Stern's official response

[11:55] to its customers. Look, you don't need me to tell you that that's not going to go over well.

[12:01] You don't need me to tell you that that's going to make you not want to buy these expensive games.

[12:08] If the quality is not there, it's the easiest way to keep you away from buying new in box,

[12:13] if you feel like you're going to buy something and you're not going to get a quality machine for

[12:17] this much money. All right, speaking about for this much money, let's do this. We haven't done this

[12:21] in a while as we're waiting for new games. Let's go on the pin side marketplace and let's look at

[12:27] what people think is worth $12,000 or more. And we'll ask ourselves, is this a fair price

[12:34] or is this a crack pipe price? Star Wars LE. Remember this game? They made 800 of them. Star

[12:43] Wars LE. When it was brand new, I want to say Star Wars LE was like 8,500, maybe 9,000 at most. Well,

[12:50] you can get one for $15,000. Now that's in Canada, so I think that needs to be price adjusted.

[12:57] Here's another one for $12,000 or best offer. Here's why this game is going up for sale. Here's

[13:04] why the other one is up for sale. People are nervous. Star Wars owners are nervous that another

[13:11] Star Wars game might be around the corner. And I think they're nervous that it might be based

[13:18] on the original movies. See, the rumor is it's episode one through three. Then there was another

[13:25] rumor that it was episode three through five. Then there was another rumor that it was Skeleton

[13:30] Crew. But I think the rumor that it's a Star Wars pin and it's going to be on spike three most

[13:37] likely and it's going to be better than the Steve Ritchie game because the Steve Ritchie game is

[13:42] bad is probably why these guys are listing these games for sale. I wouldn't go anywhere near a

[13:48] Star Wars LE. I just don't even like the game. I don't like the artwork. I don't like the TIE

[13:53] Fighter on a spring. I don't like what Dwight did with the code. I don't like anything about it.

[13:57] All right, here's one. Evil Dead. Evil Dead with the topper, $13,900. With a sale pending. Damn,

[14:06] Canada, you should have scalped this game. I'm telling you Evil Dead is going to hold value.

[14:11] And as of now, it's going to win Game of the Year. I love this one here. James Bond 60th,

[14:17] $15,500 or best offer. I got your offer, buddy. And it's $10,500, not $15,500. You need to be

[14:25] smoking a crack pipe if you think James Bond 60th is going to sell for $15,500 in this market.

[14:31] Stranger Things LE loaded, loaded, $13,000. I'm going to tell you something right now. I think

[14:38] that's a fair price. They didn't make a thousand Stranger Things. It's also to me, I mean this,

[14:44] as much as it's like an insert mania, the play field on that game, I feel like this game out of a

[14:49] lot of stern machines, I feel like this one in general is aging better than most games. I think

[14:56] the theme is always going to be iconic. It's got like modern nostalgia, which most modern TV shows

[15:03] don't have because it's based on a period we're nostalgic for, right? It's also got innovation

[15:09] in it. It's the only pinball machine ever to have that projector. As I said earlier, it's the only

[15:15] pinball machine ever to do the UV successfully. And it's got mechs that move that interact with the

[15:22] ball, a magnet that holds the ball in the back of the game. I know that's like a problematic mech,

[15:26] but it's still got stuff and it's a fan layout. And it's got the music, the theme songs, the call

[15:32] outs, everything, the clips from the show synced up with the audio. In a day and age with a thousand

[15:37] unit King Kong and thousand Venoms and thousand Foo Fighters and thousand this, thousand that for

[15:44] 13,000, I'm all in on a $13,000 Stranger Things. I'd rather play that game than most of the new

[15:51] LEs that have a thousand units. So I think this game is going to sell. I think I just sold this

[15:56] game. I think I just sold this game. This gentleman in Los Angeles, California with his loaded and

[16:02] he's got some nice mods in this game. He's got the topper on this game. I'd rather buy this than a

[16:08] King Kong with no assets and no topper. Which one people in Canada? Elvira House of Horrors,

[16:13] just a premium $12,800. What for a premium? All right, here's it's funny, a James Bond 60th.

[16:20] Remember I was making fun of the 15,5 one. Here's one with the topper. They all had the topper

[16:26] for 12,5 but here's the scary part. It's not sold. It's not sold. It's been up for a week,

[16:32] 12,5. Nobody wants this game for anything more than 10. Here's another Stranger Things LE

[16:38] recently unboxed for 13 just sold. I'm telling you, the other one's going to sell. If you want to

[16:43] sell Stranger Things right now, 13, you're getting it. You're getting that money on the table. Godzilla

[16:49] LE. Godzilla, the best game of all time. I think it's number two now. I think Evil Dead bumped it

[16:55] down a spot. Godzilla LE, $15,400. What is this $400 crap? Give me $15,500 or $15,000. You know,

[17:06] you got to do increments of $500 in this hobby. I love the description. I'm the second owner

[17:11] and I have barely played it under 400 games and 1,000 balls played in total, barely played it

[17:18] under 400 games. $15,400. Now, if this guy is the second owner and he wants $15,400, what did he

[17:25] pay for it? You know what? I don't know. I just feel like at this point, the LE of Godzilla

[17:32] means nothing to me. It doesn't. Nobody cares you have one. I don't even think the LE is that nice.

[17:36] I wouldn't go anywhere near it. Jaws LE, I love much more. I love Jaws LE way more than I love

[17:41] Godzilla LE. Just from an overall package, I think as a game, it's way more stunning and impressive

[17:47] and iconic looking. This one, Jaws LE is $14,500. It has 110 plays in total. What's wrong with these

[17:56] people? I put 110 plays on Guns N' Roses in a weekend. These guys have owned these games for years.

[18:03] 110 plays in total and the game, he says, is dialed in. Why would you dial in your game

[18:12] and then not play it? And then the sad reality of the modern times, people. King Kong, Myth of

[18:19] Terror Island, LE, sitting at a distro in a box, $12,500, unsold. More of them for sale for $12,000

[18:27] from distros. Really, really, this has got to make Stern nervous. Their great Keith Elwyn did not

[18:34] achieve a sellout. Game has been out now. What? Three weeks? Really bad sign. I told you that game

[18:41] would be $10,000 in six months and it might even be lower than that. I mean that. All right, here's

[18:46] someone on the crack pipe, Avengers Infinity Quest Limited Edition for $13,000. Or best offer. Okay,

[18:53] you put the OBO. It's like, when you put the OBO, it's kind of like, I know I'm being a jerk, but

[18:59] I'm not really a jerk. That's what OBO is. OBO means no one's going to offer this, but I just want you

[19:05] to know that I know, that you know, that I know, that you know, that I know, I'm a little bit of a

[19:13] jerk. That's what OBO means. All right, Pirates of the Caribbean, LE for $18,000 firm. I don't know.

[19:21] Might as well just wait to see Harry Potter at this point. Medieval madness, $13,000 or best offer.

[19:28] Yeah, no one's paying that. Especially with all these Merlin editions about to be made.

[19:33] Wizard of Oz, Emerald City Limited Edition. I didn't realize this. They made a thousand Emerald City

[19:41] LEs of waz. This guy wants $13,000 for it. That game knew was $6,500. Smoking crack is not good.

[19:52] This one's crazy. Pirates of the Caribbean, LE low place. $22,000. Nope. Metallica remastered LE,

[20:01] right? It was $13,000. I had one. This guy wants $16,250 firm. Firm. So he wants to make $3,250 on this

[20:13] game. I don't know. I don't know. I feel like interest in this LE is waned. It really has. I think it's

[20:20] holding around $13,000. $14,000. I don't think people are spending $16,000 on it anymore. There's

[20:25] the troll post for the punny factory edition for $15,000. That's just a troll post. Got another

[20:32] King Kong LE for sale. Avatar CE for sale. This is funny. Avatar CE for $13,250. I just had to remind

[20:40] myself that that game originally was $15,000 and he writes, space is limited and prefers something

[20:47] different. Let me tell you something, people. What you don't want to write when you're selling a game

[20:52] for $13,250. You don't want to write in the description of your for sale ad that you want

[21:00] a different game because you're just telling someone they're going to feel the same way.

[21:04] If you spend $13,250, you're going to want something different if you buy my machine.

[21:09] What a foolish thing to write. Come on, guys. Common sense, my mama says. Another Elton John CE

[21:15] for $13,000. Oh my gosh. There's more King Kong LEs. There's a lot of these inboxes, man. Anyone

[21:22] who thinks this game is sold out, go on the pin side marketplace. There's two more of them right

[21:27] here. Here we go again in Philadelphia PA. This guy, I've reached out to this guy, Batman 66,

[21:35] Super LE, $35,000 or best offer. The problem is, if you look at this guy's game, he absolutely has

[21:43] ruined it. He tacked on so much crap to the game. I'm not even sure you could even restore it to

[21:49] its original beauty. Everybody, thank you for being a member of Canada Spinball Podcast. That was

[21:53] fun. We're always going to make this show entertaining. I'm really hungover today. I don't

[21:57] know if you could tell, but I am. Damn, man. A lot of vodka sodas. The Knicks lost. Crazy night.

[22:03] Ended up at a jazz bar, not my Japanese one, but another jazz bar in New York City. Fun time in

[22:08] the city, but I'm getting too old for this. Canada out.
