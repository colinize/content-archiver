[00:00] Bam bam, monster splash, he's sure mon lit a bouffet,

[00:02] Saint-Angandu, Ventron, mon whiskey, can't a moi,

[00:05] Peux dormi, vide, brie, mais j'ai du dormi dans la goutte,

[00:08] J'ai rouge, j'ai eu un flash.

[00:12] En quatre couleurs.

[00:14] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:18] Ah, we still got pinball machines in front of windows.

[00:21] We've got this Elton John Owners Club turning into a tribe.

[00:26] There's like 30 Rocket Men who think this game is gonna go up in value.

[00:30] And we've got a new pinball machine this week.

[00:33] That is the most exciting thing I can possibly say.

[00:37] Whenever there's a new machine, especially from Sturm Pinball,

[00:40] there is a level of excitement in the air.

[00:42] There is hype, there is excitement, there is drama, there is expectations.

[00:46] There is all of this speculating going on.

[00:48] What will be the inaugural machine from Mr. Elliot Eisman?

[00:53] He's an engineer.

[00:54] Is he gonna load this game with mechanisms?

[00:57] Is it gonna have a great layout?

[00:59] It's gonna have three ramps.

[01:00] We know it's gonna have toys.

[01:03] Is it gonna have all the assets from the John Wick movies?

[01:06] There's like four of them.

[01:07] There's gonna be a fifth one.

[01:09] How is he going to tackle this?

[01:11] How is he gonna make his name for himself in the pinball legacy hall of fame?

[01:15] The guy's already in the pinball hall of fame.

[01:18] Did you know this?

[01:19] He's the youngest inductee into the pinball hall of fame ever.

[01:24] He was like 31 years old when that happened because of all the mechanical stuff he put into games.

[01:31] And we've never even said his name.

[01:33] It's like this guy made the hyperdrive in Star Wars.

[01:37] He's made a lot of other mechanisms in pinball that we love.

[01:40] He made Rush Pinball.

[01:41] And look, this is gonna be really exciting because in less than 48 hours,

[01:47] we are gonna get a new Stern machine.

[01:50] Now here's the other thing that's not so exciting.

[01:52] In the next 48 hours, it is still just gonna be a Stern machine.

[01:57] I feel like every time we have these lofty expectations of what Stern's gonna do next,

[02:02] are they gonna innovate?

[02:03] Are they gonna put scopes?

[02:04] Are they gonna make stuff magical?

[02:05] Are they gonna create that world under glass we're all clamoring for?

[02:09] And it's Stern, you know, when I look down at Jaws,

[02:12] the real missed opportunity to create that world under glass.

[02:16] Like it's not there, people.

[02:18] The orca is terrible.

[02:20] It doesn't look like a boat.

[02:22] It looks like a flat piece of plastic.

[02:24] That shark fin mech is terrible.

[02:27] It's not exciting to shoot.

[02:29] There's no kinetic energy.

[02:30] It doesn't make any sense.

[02:32] You bash a boat.

[02:33] Explain to me how this makes sense.

[02:35] Why do you bash a boat to reveal Jaws?

[02:39] Like why?

[02:40] Like why are you hitting the boat?

[02:41] That doesn't make any sense.

[02:43] A bash toy should not open up another bash toy.

[02:46] It doesn't make any sense.

[02:48] The same way like in The Walking Dead,

[02:50] when you bash the barn,

[02:52] why does it open up doors to bash a big zombie head?

[02:55] None of that makes sense.

[02:57] This scale doesn't make sense.

[02:59] It's lazy creativity.

[03:01] So I'm hoping Mr. Elliott Iceman brings some new creativity to Pimball.

[03:07] That he thinks about the toys and the mechs in a unique way.

[03:10] And he brings us a new legacy in the world of Pimball.

[03:14] Here's my topic on today's episode of

[03:16] Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[03:17] First and foremost,

[03:18] if you have Pimball machines in front of windows

[03:21] or mirrors or anything like that,

[03:23] directly in front of those windows,

[03:25] get them out of there.

[03:27] Harmony, people.

[03:28] We need to get back to harmony in our world

[03:30] and in our lives.

[03:31] It just doesn't look right and you know it.

[03:34] And if you don't know it,

[03:35] I know your wives know it,

[03:37] and I know your kids know it.

[03:38] It's not what you do.

[03:40] It's like a six feet tall piece of furniture.

[03:43] Would you put an arm wall in front of a window?

[03:46] It's the same thing with Pimball.

[03:48] This is going to be my legacy.

[03:50] I am going to travel around the world

[03:52] and remove every single Pimball machine

[03:55] from a window that I can possibly do.

[03:57] It is like me doing surgery on the room

[04:00] and the energy and the harmony of that room.

[04:02] And if you know who you are,

[04:05] trust me,

[04:06] just move it and realize how much better your life will be.

[04:09] But the real topic I want to talk about,

[04:11] two things I want to talk about,

[04:13] whether or not Stern Pimball is burning the wick from both ends.

[04:16] And here's what I mean by that.

[04:18] Here's what I mean by that.

[04:19] I think Stern Pimball is almost setting up

[04:22] all of its designers to somewhat deliver underwhelming games.

[04:27] And what I mean by that is at this price point,

[04:30] seven to $13,000.

[04:32] I don't think Stern Pimball has increased

[04:35] the bomb of their machines enough

[04:37] so these designers can actually put enough into these games

[04:42] to justify games costing that much.

[04:45] So we're going to talk about that.

[04:47] And then I also want to talk about what would you do

[04:50] if you were Damian?

[04:51] If you were Damian Hardin,

[04:53] what would you do if you're a Pimball company,

[04:55] you know, the dream,

[04:57] stars in your eyes,

[04:58] Pimball company that you created,

[05:00] fell on hard times like this?

[05:02] What would you do?

[05:03] I'm going to tell you what I would do.

[05:04] But I want each and every one of us to close our eyes

[05:07] and imagine we were over there in Australia

[05:10] and we promised people all these Pimball machines

[05:13] and we sort of ran out of money.

[05:15] What would you do if you were in his Australian shoes?

[05:18] All right, let's talk about this burning the wick from both ends

[05:22] because we're about to see this game tomorrow.

[05:24] Now look, imagine you're a Pimball designer

[05:26] and Stern Pimball gives you a bomb, right?

[05:29] A bill of materials.

[05:30] This is how much money you have to put stuff into your game.

[05:35] Now here's my fear about the current state of Pimball.

[05:38] I don't think these designers are like putting less

[05:41] into these games per se.

[05:43] I just think the bomb that they have to make a game

[05:48] is not aligned anymore with where Pimball pricing is at.

[05:52] Because I'm just going to assume that the bill of materials

[05:55] that a designer has to make a game

[05:58] is somewhere around the ballpark of like $4,000.

[06:02] Now, when they were designing games

[06:04] with the $4,000 bomb and then they would release a game

[06:08] to the world in which the LE was like $8,500,

[06:13] think about the way we all responded to those games.

[06:16] We looked at all of those games with much more open arms.

[06:21] We didn't get so angry.

[06:23] Nobody who bought an $8,500 LE was losing $3,000 to $4,000 in one year.

[06:30] And I feel like those designers were able to make games

[06:33] that were in line with what Pimball cost.

[06:37] And here's where I think it doesn't work anymore.

[06:40] Because imagine if you're LE and you're designing John Wick.

[06:43] Your bomb on John Wick is probably still basically what the bomb was

[06:48] when LE machines were $8,500 and premiums were like $7,000

[06:54] and pros were $5,000.

[06:56] But now you got to make a game where the LE is going to be $13,000.

[07:02] And there's going to be a thousand of them.

[07:04] And you've seen the last four Stern LEs at that price

[07:08] have all gone down in value and the customers have been disappointed

[07:12] in what they're losing on the second hand value.

[07:14] And even though Stern is charging about $5,000 more than what an LE used to be,

[07:22] they didn't give you like another $2,000 to make that game better.

[07:27] And that's my point is I think Stern is somewhat

[07:30] setting up all these designers to release games

[07:34] that when we look at them, we're not going to look at them the same way.

[07:37] There's not going to be enough in those games to ever justify

[07:41] what these games are costing us.

[07:43] Remember a pro is now $7,000 for a pro.

[07:47] Like when did that happen?

[07:49] And they didn't even do it gradually.

[07:51] It was like LEs went from $10,500 to $11,500 to $13,000.

[07:55] And it happened like really quickly during COVID.

[07:58] But I just wish that Stern would reevaluate this.

[08:01] What I really wish Stern would do is give their designers

[08:05] like another $500 to $1,000 in bomb to make these games elevated.

[08:11] Like a Stern machine at this much money should look more like a Jersey Jack machine.

[08:16] It should have better lighting.

[08:18] It should have more mechanisms in it.

[08:20] I know they've simplified the computing system and the node boards,

[08:24] but I feel like they've made efficiencies without increasing the mechanical engineering in the games.

[08:31] That is why I think something needs to give in pinball.

[08:34] If Stern wants to keep charging these prices, that's fine.

[08:38] That's on them.

[08:39] But they need to give their designers more money to make the games more magical.

[08:44] Now who amongst us would have a problem with that?

[08:47] They're making so much money.

[08:49] The problem now is, and I hear the rumors and I think they're true,

[08:52] that thousands of new and box games are piling up.

[08:56] And the inventory with dealers and distros are piling up.

[09:01] And it's about to collapse people.

[09:03] It's like an avalanche, right?

[09:04] It's like enough pressures building up where there are thousands of new and box games with no homes.

[09:10] And you keep raising the prices and the used market is making it impossible for dealers

[09:16] to sell any of these new and box games.

[09:18] I mean, how do you sell a new and box Venom LE?

[09:22] Think about it.

[09:23] The map pricing on it is 13 grand.

[09:26] How do you sell that game when an opened one is 8,500?

[09:30] And I was going over and looking at some of the major dealers and distros.

[09:35] They have so much inventory on games that are worth so much less.

[09:40] The second that cardboard box is removed.

[09:42] And I think that's going to create a lot of trouble.

[09:45] And I just want to see Stern stop being so greedy.

[09:49] You're making more money than you ever did before.

[09:52] But I do think much like an earthquake, the pressure is building and it is building over at Stern

[09:59] because you can't have thousands of unsold new and box games.

[10:02] And you can't justify the prices of these games unless you give your designers more money

[10:09] and allow them to create more magic in their machines.

[10:12] So I'm super excited to see John Wick.

[10:15] We're going to talk a lot about it tomorrow.

[10:17] I'm guessing we're going to see some crappy cell phone leaks of the game today.

[10:22] Because here's what happened with Jaws.

[10:24] Those videos that introduce us to the game, they're already done.

[10:28] So normally what happens is this.

[10:29] Those videos get shared with like dealers or distros today.

[10:33] People see them and then they screen grab those videos.

[10:37] That's how all the Jaws stuff leaked.

[10:39] So I fully expect that at some point today, we are going to get a leak of John Wick Pimbal.

[10:44] All right. What would you do, ladies and gentlemen?

[10:46] If you were Damian Hardin, you started a company like four or five years ago.

[10:52] You made one Keltz game and then you thought you could just scale up and you scaled up.

[10:57] You got the factory.

[10:59] You got the second title.

[11:01] You got orders on the game.

[11:03] You got deposits that were all non-refundable.

[11:06] What would you do if you were him right now?

[11:08] This is the thing I've been thinking about.

[11:10] I mean, he's waking up every day.

[11:11] He's a family man.

[11:13] He's got angry customers.

[11:15] They're lynching him on pin side every single day.

[11:18] Now he's got Flinnybus on the case.

[11:20] Once Flinnybus is coming after you, it's over.

[11:23] Your thread will never be the same.

[11:25] He's got Marty Robbins just ignoring the entire damn thing.

[11:29] Marty keeps doing podcasts and pretends like none of this is happening.

[11:32] It's like the entire house is on fire and Marty's over there laughing and insulting other Pimbal

[11:38] podcasters that want to have debates about price and value.

[11:42] How dare you, Marty?

[11:44] Get your games in boxes and get them to your paying customers.

[11:47] Nobody wants to hear your cheeky laugh, brother.

[11:49] It's kind of creepy.

[11:51] Grow up, man up, and take responsibility for the company that has been ripping people off

[11:56] for the last year and a half, two years.

[11:58] Oh, Canada, no personal insults, but I'm allowed to go at these companies

[12:02] because nobody else will and they know that.

[12:04] So here's the thing I would do if I was Damien.

[12:06] I would just come clean and tell the truth.

[12:09] I would say, hey, look, this is the current situation of this company.

[12:13] If we continue to operate the way we're going, we're going to be out of business.

[12:17] He's got to be more transparent about what he actually needs.

[12:20] Does he need to raise the price of the game?

[12:23] We saw Dutch Pimbal do that with the big Lebowski.

[12:26] That game went from being what, like 8,500 to 13,5.

[12:30] They had to do that to figure a way out of the whole.

[12:33] Would that help them out?

[12:35] I don't think they could do that because the Fathom resale value is plummeting.

[12:39] So there's no way you could charge more.

[12:41] I mean, they tried to charge more with this like or oblivion edition of Centaur.

[12:45] I mean, remember, that was $17,500.

[12:48] And there's some people that paid in full for that game.

[12:51] And here's the thing.

[12:51] I just think if I were Damien, I know that I could keep up the lie.

[12:56] I know that I could keep trying to rob Peter to pay Paul.

[13:00] I know I could draw this thing out for a longer period of time, but I wouldn't do it.

[13:05] And I know it's hard to stop and say, hey, look,

[13:08] this is what we were doing and it failed.

[13:11] And the only way forward is to either come clean and be 100% transparent with everybody.

[13:18] The truth will always set you free.

[13:21] The truth will always set you free.

[13:23] We have an issues in crisis department at my company.

[13:26] I mean, a lot of public relations deals with issue and crisis.

[13:29] And the thing is this, the truth is really the only way out for everybody.

[13:34] And so if I were Damien, I would wake up one day and just turn on the camera

[13:40] and be honest with us for once.

[13:42] And what I mean by that too is you don't have to go into like all the details of the financials,

[13:48] but stop hiding.

[13:49] You know what I want to see him do?

[13:51] I want to see him ask for forgiveness.

[13:54] I want to see him not just ask for forgiveness.

[13:57] I want to see the pain.

[13:59] I want to see some of the suffering.

[14:01] I want to see some of the anguish.

[14:03] And I want to see him ask for forgiveness.

[14:05] We bit off more than we could chew and we're sorry.

[14:08] And this is the only way out, right?

[14:10] Because we all know like recapitalizing and trying to find investors is never going to work.

[14:16] I know this is the hardest thing to do is to ask for forgiveness,

[14:21] lay out for everybody what the only way forward is, and also lay out for people the reality

[14:28] that there might not be a way forward, that we might have to start winding down.

[14:33] And I know that's the most difficult thing to do because nobody ever wants to accept defeat.

[14:40] The thing about the world of business and manufacturing,

[14:43] if the numbers don't work, you're just never going to get out of the hole.

[14:47] So if I were Damien, that's what I would do.

[14:50] I would come clean.

[14:52] I would turn on the camera more and I would have weekly updates about where we are,

[14:57] whether they're good or bad, even bad news, even no news.

[15:01] If you just communicate that you're trying, that I understand you want your game

[15:05] and I'm working as hard as I can to get you guys your games

[15:09] and we're having meetings with investors, whatever it is,

[15:12] to just hide and say nothing is never the answer.

[15:16] And if there's one person that never hides and never says nothing, it's Canada.

[15:22] Everybody, thank you so much for the support.

[15:24] I'm waiting on this baby any day now, any minute now.

[15:28] Knowing my luck, this baby is going to pop out right when Stern shows John Wick pinball.

[15:34] Everybody, more shows come this week.

[15:36] This is kind of like my therapy for all the anxiety happening in this family right now.

[15:41] We'll talk to you soon.

[15:42] Stern, give your designers more money.

[15:45] Damien, come clean.

[15:46] And please, Elton John owners, we get it.

[15:50] You like your game.

[15:51] But stop acting like a crazy cult.

[15:54] Like this is the only game where people are never going to get tired of it.

[15:58] Come on, you're going to get bored of this game.

[16:01] You know you are.

[16:02] I know it's exciting that there's finally a Jersey Jack game that shoots well,

[16:07] that actually makes you want to play it.

[16:09] I mean, think about it.

[16:09] It's so funny to me.

[16:10] It's like 10 years of Jersey Jack pinball.

[16:12] And they finally make a game that's fun to play.

[16:15] Finally, no mushy flippers, no over-the-top multi-ball, no bad design.

[16:21] They finally make a game that's really fun to shoot.

[16:23] And people are acting like it's the second coming of pinball.

[16:26] And these things are never leaving people's game rooms.

[16:29] Trust me, Jersey Jack is going to be making these Elton Johns for the next like six months.

[16:35] There are going to be so many Elton Johns out there.

[16:38] And they're not all going to be bolted to the floor.

[16:40] And after you get tired of the six songs that have energy

[16:44] and collecting his glasses and his sequins shirts,

[16:47] you're going to move on to something with more storyline and more narrative.

[16:51] Canada loves the game, but come on, gang.

[16:54] Like it's not the greatest game ever.

[16:55] It's not even based on a theme you even wanted.

[16:58] And so just wake up a little bit.

[17:00] I know you're in the honeymoon phase, but man, for 12 to $15,000,

[17:04] it better be a dream theme.

[17:06] And how many of you are experiencing a dream theme experience?

[17:10] And if that game, if it shot the way it shoots,

[17:12] and that game was Top Gun or Karate Kid or Die Hard, yeah.

[17:17] But it's Elton freakin' John people.

[17:19] Come on, we're going to get those greater themes from Jersey Jack soon,

[17:22] but just not yet.

[17:24] I'm happy you're having a good time, but everybody, come on, come on.

[17:27] We're waiting for a triple A theme that shoots like Elton John.

[17:32] That's what everybody's waiting for.

[17:33] Everybody have a great Monday.

[17:35] We'll be back soon with more Canada's Pinball podcast.

[17:37] Thank you for the support.
