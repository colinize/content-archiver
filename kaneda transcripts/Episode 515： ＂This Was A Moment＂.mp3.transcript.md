[00:00] This is what the Pimball community sound at like today at 1 p.m. Eastern Standard Time when you finally got to see guns and roses. It's sound like this.

[00:30] Woooow! Woooow!

[00:41] Come on!

[00:44] Woooow!

[00:49] Woooow!

[00:51] I have four words for you.

[00:54] I love this company. Yeah!

[01:02] Woooow!

[01:05] What did I tell you was going to happen when people saw guns and roses?

[01:08] Did you think Canadian was going to be wrong again?

[01:10] And I was going to pull another Willy Wonka and my entire credibility in the Pimball world would be shattered forever.

[01:17] I knew I knew if this game didn't deliver.

[01:20] It was going to shatter my credibility forever.

[01:22] And there's a reason why I've been sitting on this game for so many months and I've been so excited and I've been hyping the hell out of guns and everything.

[01:30] I'm just like exhausted like at the end of this journey seeing this game months ago knowing what Eric and J.J.P had in store.

[01:36] I was just so excited to see how they were going to reveal this game and let me just say this was the best Pimball reveal of all time.

[01:49] And let me repeat that this was the greatest Pimball reveal the world has ever seen.

[01:53] greatest pinball reveal the world has ever seen.

[01:56] I feel like Jersey Jack Pinball sent a message

[01:59] to every single pinball company at one o'clock today

[02:02] and this is like the theme song

[02:03] for the launch of this game.

[02:05] This is how we do it.

[02:07] This is how we do it.

[02:09] This is how we do it.

[02:11] La, la, la, la, la.

[02:13] Let's do it.

[02:15] Let's do it.

[02:17] Oh.

[02:18] Oh.

[02:19] Oh.

[02:20] All right.

[02:21] So let's deconstruct the greatest pinball launch

[02:24] that we've ever seen in the history of pinball.

[02:27] And look, look, I know that we haven't played the game yet.

[02:31] I know that that is a huge thing that everyone wants to see.

[02:35] And you're going to see it tonight probably

[02:37] because people have picked up these games already.

[02:40] A hundred machines were completed and are already

[02:44] at the factory being picked up.

[02:46] There are some around the world that are already unboxed.

[02:49] And I've seen this game in full motion.

[02:52] I've seen the video of this game.

[02:54] And it's going to blow you away.

[02:56] The more you see of Guns and Roses, mark my words.

[02:59] The more you're going to be impressed by what Eric and company

[03:02] have done with these games, I've lost my voice.

[03:04] I've been so excited screaming at everything

[03:07] I've seen in this game.

[03:08] And so here's how I want to deconstruct this thing.

[03:11] I want to talk about the launch first

[03:13] because I will say it is the greatest launch

[03:16] in the history of pinball machines.

[03:17] But there was one thing I would have done differently.

[03:19] And I told Ken Cromwell, I think they did it perfect.

[03:22] But there was one thing I would have done differently.

[03:24] And I'll explain what I mean by that.

[03:26] But other than the thing I'm going to talk about,

[03:29] how amazing was it to see the high production video

[03:31] they put together to show this game to the world?

[03:35] On one level, you've got Stern Pimball having

[03:37] Zach Sharp stand over Ninja Turtles looking all serious

[03:41] with his serious face.

[03:42] He's kind of cranky trying to put up a high score

[03:45] during a demo video.

[03:46] Did that get you excited about Ninja Turtles?

[03:48] And they've got a super attractive woman.

[03:51] She slaps high five and all of a sudden,

[03:54] the ding, ding, ding, ding, jungle, ba.

[03:56] And then the game pop right into gameplay footage.

[03:59] And this is exactly how you should launch a pinball machine.

[04:02] It's exactly how you should sell a toy to the world

[04:06] with an exciting piece of content that people can share.

[04:09] And people are excited to share.

[04:10] And doesn't go too deep.

[04:12] It doesn't go too hard into the rules.

[04:14] It's really just about a flash moment, right?

[04:18] A moment to sell the sizzle of this game.

[04:21] And my God, when I saw this video, though,

[04:23] the one thing about it, when I saw it,

[04:25] it was so high energy, there was so many quick cuts

[04:29] that I was like, you know, it's almost too much

[04:31] to even understand what's going on with the game

[04:33] when you see the video.

[04:34] Because people are missing stuff

[04:35] like that there's a big LCD screen underneath the glass.

[04:39] That's in the upper right corner.

[04:40] People are like, no, it doesn't have that.

[04:42] And my kids right here in this part of the video,

[04:44] and that part of the video, oh, and look,

[04:46] here's like another thing and another thing.

[04:47] And like, so it was really hard to sort of take it all in.

[04:50] Because we're used to videos sort of showing us,

[04:53] you know, more of the top down look of the play field.

[04:55] But that's okay.

[04:56] That's okay.

[04:57] This is what a high energy sort of sizzle teaser

[05:00] is supposed to do to get you excited about the game.

[05:03] I mean, who watched this video?

[05:05] And didn't think that this was the greatest

[05:07] launch pinball video that we've ever had.

[05:10] I mean, this is how it should be done.

[05:11] And if you're another pinball company out there,

[05:14] and you're thinking of revealing your game to the world,

[05:17] Jersey Jack Pinball just set the bar super duper high

[05:20] on this game.

[05:21] And then we got another great video.

[05:23] Like they had all these assets ready to go.

[05:26] Zach Manys straight down the middle video.

[05:29] I don't know if you've seen it yet,

[05:30] but you should go check it out.

[05:31] They did a 22 minute deep dive video on the game.

[05:35] And this is a game in which you need to hear it.

[05:37] You need to see it.

[05:38] You need to see it in motion.

[05:40] And his video is phenomenal.

[05:42] And I think when people see the light show

[05:45] interacting with the music with the gameplay,

[05:47] I think it starts to bring even more

[05:50] of why this game is so special.

[05:52] And what I loved about Zach's video

[05:54] is how he interviews Eric.

[05:55] And he tells the story of making this game.

[05:58] And I know Eric did an interview

[05:59] with our boy Christopher Franchi on his show.

[06:02] You guys should check that out.

[06:03] But here's why I think this game is so damn special.

[06:06] And I think for those of you out there

[06:08] who don't understand the hype,

[06:09] let me break it down for you real simple.

[06:12] Let me break down why Slash is telling everybody,

[06:15] you're never gonna see another music pin.

[06:17] And maybe not even another pinball machine

[06:20] that gives you this much in your lifetime.

[06:23] And here's what I mean by that.

[06:25] The most valuable thing in this game,

[06:27] though, and people are talking about the price

[06:29] and we're gonna talk about the price

[06:30] and why I'm all in on a CE.

[06:32] But the most valuable thing in this game

[06:35] is the fact that Slash, the lead guitarist

[06:39] for Guns and Roses worked on this game with Eric.

[06:42] They have everything and then some that you would want

[06:46] in a Guns and Roses music pin.

[06:48] I mean the access to the band, to their footage,

[06:52] to their songs, 21 songs, 21.

[06:56] Name me another music pin that comes anywhere close to that.

[07:00] Not only that, they got so many hours of HD concert footage.

[07:05] They got access to the band's photographer

[07:07] for all their imagery.

[07:09] They got access to the artists who's done all the guns

[07:11] and roses posters over the years.

[07:14] Tell me what other music band, what other music band

[07:18] has given anyone remotely, remotely this kind of access

[07:22] to the game.

[07:23] The last pinball machine that had this much sort of access

[07:27] was Rick and Morty and Batman 66.

[07:29] And both of those games were developed

[07:32] with the creator of the series, right?

[07:35] So just in worked with spooky on Rick and Morty,

[07:38] and that's why the theme integration in Rick and Morty

[07:40] is so phenomenal.

[07:41] And Adam West and Joe Kamikau put everything

[07:45] that you could think of from the Batman 66 world

[07:47] into the game.

[07:48] And now we're getting this game that has complete access

[07:52] to the world of Guns and Roses.

[07:53] And that is so rare.

[07:55] And that is worth so much.

[07:57] Like you can't even put a price tag

[07:59] on having that level of access to the license

[08:01] that you're working with.

[08:02] And I think anyone out there who doubted,

[08:04] like if Guns and Roses is a good theme,

[08:07] doubt it whether or not G&R has mainstream popularity,

[08:10] doubt it whether or not a G&R pinball machine

[08:13] in 2020 would be relevant.

[08:15] This is why G&R is a phenomenal pinball machine

[08:20] and still is relevant today.

[08:22] When you hear that music,

[08:24] when you see that woman dancing to Paradise City

[08:27] over the machine, I mean, tell me, tell me,

[08:30] what gets people more excited?

[08:31] Like that, the way you can market a game with that in it,

[08:35] or just the stock pinball music that you're gonna get

[08:38] in your Avengers machine.

[08:39] I mean, I don't mean to take punches at other companies

[08:42] because there's great games being developed

[08:45] all throughout pinball right now.

[08:46] It's a win-win for everybody.

[08:48] But I'm just saying this is why I knew G&R was gonna be

[08:52] so special because Erick's design coupled with slash,

[08:56] coupled with the fact that the band was involved

[08:58] in the production and design of this game

[09:00] throughout the entire process of making it,

[09:03] you're never gonna get this level of integration

[09:06] very often in pinball.

[09:08] It's not gonna happen.

[09:09] There is no way you're gonna get this level of integration

[09:12] with Toy Story.

[09:12] It's not happening.

[09:13] You are never gonna get the creators of Toy Story

[09:16] are not working with Jersey Jack on the game.

[09:19] They are licensing assets.

[09:20] This was not a Jersey Jack and Guns and Roses licensing deal.

[09:25] This was a complete collaboration between Erick, J.J.P.

[09:30] and Slash and the Band, complete collaboration.

[09:33] I mean, I was just talking to Frank Thunderchucker.

[09:36] Awesome dude, super nice guy.

[09:38] He's in the muscle cars.

[09:39] I met Frank years ago when I did my Dr. Pepper promotion,

[09:42] super nice guy.

[09:43] I'm like, Frank, man, I'm looking at your drumsticks

[09:45] in the pinball machine.

[09:46] You know what he said to me?

[09:47] He goes, wait, the game's out.

[09:48] He's like, no one even told him the game was out yet.

[09:50] When you're a member of Guns and Roses,

[09:52] you're always the last one to find out

[09:53] what's happening with the band.

[09:56] But he's excited.

[09:57] You've got his drumsticks in this game.

[09:59] You've got Axel, Slash and Duff

[10:02] are going to sign these games.

[10:04] I mean, seriously, if that doesn't get you excited,

[10:07] I mean, Axel Rose and Slash and Duff McKagan

[10:10] will be signing this game.

[10:12] Look how much money you spent

[10:14] with Elvira's signature edition.

[10:17] Elvira, all they gave you was a piece of couch

[10:20] and that thing sold out and it was $2,500 more

[10:24] than the Guns and Roses Collector's Edition.

[10:26] And I get there's 10 times more CE's,

[10:29] but there's 10 times more in the Collector's Edition

[10:32] that's gonna make people go crazy.

[10:34] All right, so there's so much to unpack here

[10:36] that I can't unpack it all on this podcast,

[10:39] but I just wanna say how amazing is this game?

[10:43] I mean, look what Eric did with this game.

[10:45] I'm trying to pull up.

[10:46] I don't see, that's the thing about this game.

[10:48] It's like, it's hard to figure out where to even go

[10:51] to start talking about the awesomeness

[10:54] that he pumped into this game.

[10:55] I mean, I'm looking at a spinner.

[10:57] It's the details that are all over this game

[10:59] and that's why it's the sum of the parts.

[11:01] I was saying, when you want pinball innovation,

[11:04] you're not gonna see like one whiz-bang innovative thing.

[11:07] The entire thing together is an innovative package

[11:11] in pinball, right?

[11:12] The one question nobody is saying is where's the pinball?

[11:16] No one's saying that.

[11:17] No one's giving up their food truck orders for this thing, right?

[11:20] Yeah, they are.

[11:21] Everybody is.

[11:22] All right, before I go over the game

[11:23] and the things in the game that I think make it so amazing

[11:26] and why I think the collectors edition is worth the money

[11:29] and why I went in on a few of them today.

[11:31] I'll explain who they're for, but before I do that,

[11:33] I do wanna say that I think there's one thing

[11:35] they should have done differently on the reveal of this game

[11:39] and I think all the assets were perfect,

[11:40] but here's what I would have done a little bit differently.

[11:43] Now that I think about the way everything hit today.

[11:45] So the thing that I would have done differently

[11:47] is I would have revealed the Slash and Eric video on Friday.

[11:53] I would have put out something

[11:55] that got people super excited on Friday for this game

[11:58] and even you could have released the one

[12:00] with the woman playing the machine on Friday.

[12:03] I would have basically got that thing out there

[12:06] and got people so excited and I would have said

[12:09] order banks are opening up for the collectors editions

[12:13] on Monday morning at 9 a.m.

[12:15] Cause here's the problem that happened today

[12:17] and this was the one issue I had.

[12:19] Is nobody knew when anything was happening?

[12:22] Absolutely nobody knew when stuff was gonna drop.

[12:25] They didn't know what time stuff was gonna drop.

[12:27] They didn't know when assets were gonna be available.

[12:29] So Jersey Jack Pimble for all the incredible assets

[12:32] they created, the one thing they did also create

[12:36] was mass confusion by the customers.

[12:39] The customers had no idea when they would be able

[12:43] to see stuff, they had no idea when they'd be able

[12:45] to order stuff and that actually I think was a mistake

[12:49] because if you think about what spooky did so well,

[12:52] they showed you the game before the weekend

[12:55] and then they told you the exact time

[12:58] in which the order banks opened up for the game

[13:01] and that's the way you do it

[13:03] because you wanna create a frenzy

[13:06] at a specific time and place.

[13:08] It's like the way Jersey Jack did it today

[13:10] is like we all knew what city to be in for the concert

[13:14] but nobody knew what time the concert was

[13:16] and nobody knew where the venue was.

[13:18] Like people were asking like,

[13:19] well where do I get to go to see stuff?

[13:22] Like is it gonna be this?

[13:23] Is it gonna be IGN?

[13:24] Is it gonna be YouTube?

[13:25] And I think they should have done it

[13:27] a little bit differently because now like you didn't get

[13:30] everybody lined up, like they really should have got everyone

[13:33] lined up to buy it at the exact same time

[13:36] and had more than 500 people barging through the door

[13:40] to get that collectives edition

[13:41] and I still think they're gonna sell out

[13:43] but I just don't think they're gonna sell out in one day.

[13:46] Just because everyone's so scattered,

[13:48] like they didn't know and knew, like nobody knew

[13:51] that this is where you had to be with your money ready to go.

[13:54] It's just nobody knew.

[13:56] But that being said, it's a minor thing

[13:59] but maybe it's not so minor

[14:00] but it's something I think that for the next launch

[14:02] they should work on is like really, really giving people

[14:05] more clarity as to when and where all this is gonna happen

[14:09] because again you want people to buy,

[14:12] like you want people to put their orders in

[14:14] and I think spooky still,

[14:16] that's the one tactics spooky did better

[14:19] was they let people line up to buy it.

[14:21] That being said, it didn't take very long for me

[14:25] to order some of these games

[14:27] and I'm ordering one for me,

[14:29] one for someone else in my family,

[14:32] one for a very good friend

[14:34] and one for another friend of mine who's a huge GNR fan

[14:37] because I knew that my friends who love guns and roses,

[14:40] they have no idea pinballs a thing,

[14:43] they have no idea this game was coming out,

[14:45] they have no clue,

[14:46] but I told them you're gonna wanna get in on this game.

[14:49] Now I'm on this week in Pimball right now

[14:51] and I'm just looking at the game right now

[14:53] and there's so much in this game too unpack.

[14:56] What I love about this game is you don't even know where to start.

[14:59] Like where do you start with the things to get excited about?

[15:02] Do you start with the unique lighting system

[15:05] that's over the stage that looks like the hexagons

[15:07] from the GNR stage?

[15:09] Do you start with that big LCD screen below it

[15:11] that's gonna show the actual videos

[15:14] that GNR shows on stage?

[15:16] Do you start with the record spinner?

[15:19] Do you start with the ramp that goes to the upper playfield

[15:22] that has an actual Gibson Les Paul ball lock

[15:25] that holds six balls for multi ball?

[15:28] Do you start there?

[15:29] Do you go to the Duff's bass guitar

[15:30] that's the entire upper left side of the playfield?

[15:34] I mean look at that wire form

[15:36] where it's like you're tuning the bass.

[15:38] How sick is that?

[15:39] Do you go to the drumsticks that are in this game

[15:42] that are like the ball trail?

[15:43] That's a better two full-size drumsticks.

[15:46] And then you know, we're not even seeing like all the different fun pathways

[15:49] for the ball to go in this game.

[15:51] There's so much to shoot at in this game.

[15:53] I can't wait.

[15:55] All right, so let's talk about some of the features that are in this game.

[15:57] There's 21 full-length studio master recordings.

[16:01] Okay, so we got this wrong by one track.

[16:03] There's exclusive Pimbal Music created by Slash, right?

[16:07] Slash made original music for the game.

[16:10] That's awesome.

[16:11] There's exclusive original instrumentation

[16:13] and sound effect recordings by Slash,

[16:15] Duff McCagan, and Richard Fortis.

[16:17] The game narration by Duff McCagan and Melissa Reese.

[16:21] Additional voice recording by Axler Rose,

[16:24] Slash, Richard Fortis, Frank Farer,

[16:27] Dizzy Reed, and GnR announcer, McBob.

[16:29] That's amazing.

[16:30] So I think what's amazing about that,

[16:32] additional voice recordings,

[16:33] I think you're gonna have Axel

[16:35] because that McBob guy is the one who goes,

[16:37] do you want it the best?

[16:39] Well, they didn't make it.

[16:40] So here's what you get from Hollywood.

[16:42] I think you're gonna get an introduction to this game

[16:44] that's gonna be this guy doing something like that.

[16:46] And Axel might do something like,

[16:48] do you know where the F you're playing Pimbal?

[16:51] You're in the jungle, baby.

[16:52] If we get some of that,

[16:54] if we get original voice recordings

[16:56] by Axler Rose in this game, you start to tell me

[16:59] that this game's not worth the money.

[17:01] You're not seeing where the value is.

[17:02] Come on people.

[17:03] Live footage and concert screen animations

[17:06] from not in this lifetime tour.

[17:08] And there's tons of footage they got.

[17:09] I think they got three hours from 18 different shows

[17:13] to choose from.

[17:14] It's got a jukebox attract mode option.

[17:16] And this is another huge thing.

[17:18] It's got content settings.

[17:20] You can do family friendly, which is default,

[17:22] but here's the best part.

[17:24] There's an adult explicit song,

[17:26] explicit video content, and explicit voice work.

[17:29] So there's an adult setting in this game

[17:32] that's gonna make it more R-rated

[17:34] and more guns and roses.

[17:35] It's got 120 watt 2.1 stereo sound system.

[17:39] Just seeing 2.1 in stereo together,

[17:41] it doesn't seem right.

[17:42] Or like, shouldn't it be like five, whatever?

[17:44] It's got Bluetooth, headphone, and Wi-Fi connectivity.

[17:48] You know my favorite part of the launch video

[17:50] besides the woman playing the game,

[17:52] having a great time,

[17:53] was Axler Rose throwing the mic into the air

[17:56] and on the mic, it says game over.

[17:59] I mean, what a great way to let the other competition know.

[18:04] We've got Axler Rose.

[18:06] We've got Slash.

[18:07] All you other pinball manufacturers out there, game over.

[18:11] What a mic drop moment.

[18:13] This is, right?

[18:14] Yeah, Keith Owing can drop a mic with one of his launches,

[18:17] but it's still just Keith Owing dropping the mic.

[18:19] This is Axler Rose throwing the mic into the ring.

[18:22] This is Axler's pinball machine

[18:23] and Slash's pinball machine.

[18:24] I love it.

[18:25] See, this is why competition is great.

[18:27] It's nothing against Keith.

[18:29] He's amazing.

[18:30] Avengers is an amazing game.

[18:31] It's just, this is just another level up it looks like

[18:34] and we'll know how it shoots coming up.

[18:36] I mean, how cool is the guitar pick?

[18:38] That's the spinner.

[18:39] Like, it's the details in this game.

[18:41] Some other features.

[18:42] There's an exposed core play field magnet.

[18:45] I don't know where that is.

[18:46] I don't know where that core play field magnet is.

[18:49] There's three pop bumpers, a lockdown bar action button,

[18:53] a seven inch display with additional game rules

[18:56] and animations, familiar in-song performance assessment

[19:00] rocket meter, new non-mechanical ball sensors,

[19:03] 75 plus mini insert LEDs for world tour map

[19:08] and music notes, unique guaranteed progress in lane

[19:11] configuration, all the coma area out lane ball save.

[19:15] We're gonna talk about the coma thing

[19:16] because I think it's a unique feature

[19:17] on the collector's edition.

[19:19] All right, so we have the standard edition

[19:21] which doesn't have the upper play field.

[19:22] It's got the standard edition art package.

[19:24] I really don't get nor do I like.

[19:26] I don't know what that is.

[19:27] Like, what is this?

[19:28] Like, these little comical zombie looking guns

[19:31] and roses characters.

[19:32] I've never, I don't get it.

[19:34] I don't get it.

[19:35] They really did do a good job of making it

[19:38] so you're gonna want the Ellie.

[19:39] Like, you're gonna want the Ellie.

[19:41] I know the collector's edition is the one for me

[19:43] and I do think it has the value

[19:45] but you're really gonna want the Ellie in this game.

[19:48] The other thing is it only has 200 RGB LEDs

[19:52] in the standard edition

[19:53] because you're losing all those lights

[19:55] that are in the upper play field areas of the game.

[19:57] All right, so the collector's edition

[19:58] and limited edition are really where this game comes to life.

[20:01] So you get, I mean, this fender base is so sick.

[20:05] You get the triple path forestering base ramp wire forming.

[20:08] I mean, it's just a work of art.

[20:10] You get two full motion articulating RGB LED stage spotlights.

[20:14] These spotlights, if you see them go during the game,

[20:17] I've never seen that before in a pinball machine.

[20:19] Have you?

[20:20] Is that considered innovation?

[20:22] I think so.

[20:23] You have a high hat and symbol interactive drum kit,

[20:26] pop bumper toys.

[20:27] I mean, how cool is that?

[20:28] I mean, Eric is all about the details.

[20:31] The pop bumpers are drum symbols

[20:34] that are next to life size drumsticks.

[20:37] And when you hit the pop bumpers, they make the symbol noise.

[20:40] They go up and down,

[20:41] haven't seen anything like this before.

[20:44] So don't say there's no innovation in this game.

[20:47] The limited edition has 350 individually controlled RGB LEDs.

[20:53] There's gonna be 5,000 LEDs.

[20:55] Here we go again with this 5,000 LED thing.

[20:57] I mean, stupid.

[20:58] Just say it's unlimited.

[20:59] It's like the premium.

[21:00] It's so, see, it's 5,000.

[21:03] Oh, they just, you know, they're so close.

[21:05] I love the art package on the LED.

[21:08] I would argue that it's just as good as the collector's edition

[21:11] if not better, because there's so much detail

[21:13] in those awesome posters.

[21:14] I love that the red armor on the LED as well.

[21:17] I mean, you pretty much have the game in the LED.

[21:19] Now, here's why I got the collector's edition.

[21:22] Let me explain real simple.

[21:24] Why I think the collector's edition is the way to go

[21:26] and they've listened to me.

[21:28] If you've heard this show, I've always said,

[21:30] when you pay more, you should get a unique gameplay feature.

[21:34] You should have a unique gameplay experience

[21:37] and they've listened to me in this game.

[21:39] The collector's edition has a mechanism

[21:42] that is not available on the LED.

[21:44] It has a ball lock in the apron of the game

[21:48] on the left side that you can see through

[21:50] and see the ball's locking in that mechanism.

[21:53] And I also heard that there's a special mode

[21:56] for those balls.

[21:57] There's a special coma mode

[21:59] in which those balls come to life.

[22:01] So let me repeat that.

[22:02] You're gonna have a special mechanism

[22:04] and a special mode that is exclusive

[22:06] to the collector's edition owners.

[22:08] And right there alone is reason enough

[22:11] to buy this machine just for that coma special feature.

[22:15] And it's real.

[22:16] Like this is even more than just the Tron Vault edition

[22:19] that had the Daft Punk Multi-Ball.

[22:22] This is even cooler because not only is it coma multi-ball,

[22:25] but it's coma with a mechanism

[22:27] that you don't get anywhere else.

[22:29] And so they went a step further

[22:32] than what people got in Tron.

[22:33] And just there, just there alone

[22:35] that only 500 people in the world

[22:38] are gonna have that special coma mode.

[22:40] And it's an coma as a song with these lights going

[22:44] and oh my god, it's gonna be so crazy.

[22:46] But here's what the collector's edition has.

[22:49] It has the appetite for destruction,

[22:51] RadCal, cabinet, art package, which is really cool.

[22:53] I mean, it is the character from the original

[22:57] appetite for destruction, art package.

[22:59] You're gonna get the powder coat purple,

[23:01] which looks really good.

[23:03] You're gonna get the purple emotion plastic set.

[23:05] The hand drawn mirrored back glass.

[23:08] Only 500, 600 controlled RGB LEDs.

[23:12] Now look, this number is misleading

[23:15] because they're counting all the LED RGBs

[23:18] that are actually the under cabinet lighting.

[23:21] And there's cabinet lighting

[23:22] on the back of the back box.

[23:23] That's what, and then there's lighting on the top.

[23:26] So that's how it's jumping from 350 to 600

[23:29] is because of those.

[23:31] You're gonna get a special sparkle,

[23:33] Gibson headstock upper playfield.

[23:36] You're gonna get the signature card

[23:37] signed by Axel Duffen slash.

[23:40] And the drumsticks will be signed by Frank.

[23:42] You get the unique CE exclusive playfield artwork.

[23:45] Again, the playfield artwork is different

[23:47] around that world map.

[23:48] It's different colors, like purple and gold.

[23:50] And it's sparkles, which looks amazing.

[23:53] And then you're gonna get this awesomely huge.

[23:55] The Skull and Rose Shooter housing sculpture,

[23:58] which just looks awesome.

[23:59] It's like the plunger's coming through the skull's head.

[24:02] Also the side armor is engraved.

[24:04] This CE has the top or with the speaker too.

[24:07] I mean, I love this CE package.

[24:10] I mean, I think this is more than enough

[24:12] to justify the cost in going in with the CE.

[24:15] And I know some of you out there

[24:16] don't feel that way, but I do.

[24:18] And when I saw it, I'm like, I'm all in

[24:20] on the Collector's Edition.

[24:21] And I think it's special.

[24:23] I do, I think it's special.

[24:24] And I just think this pen in general is so special.

[24:27] And I just wanna have the nicest version

[24:30] of this super special pen.

[24:32] Now for the roast of you out there, $9,500,

[24:34] you're all in on this Ellie

[24:36] and you get pretty much the entire game.

[24:38] And so I don't think you're gonna miss out on much.

[24:40] I think the Ellie, you add a little inner art blades

[24:43] and you're good to go.

[24:44] There's gonna be tons of guns and roses toppers

[24:46] that become available for this machine.

[24:48] And you know, I'm sure someone will figure out a way.

[24:51] There's so many modders to add a speaker bar

[24:53] to the top that you guys can put out there in the world.

[24:55] And I just love the fact that it's out.

[24:57] You can hear my voice.

[24:58] I'm so exhausted.

[24:59] I literally have been screaming and shouting

[25:01] about how excited I am with this game.

[25:03] And I think this game delivers.

[25:05] I think this game is going to cause a seismic shift in Pimbal.

[25:09] I do.

[25:10] I would rather have a game like this

[25:13] than have four to five games a year

[25:15] that just don't get us going like this.

[25:18] I'm sorry.

[25:19] A Jersey Jack game that has checked all of the boxes

[25:21] has never happened before.

[25:23] And I mean all of the boxes, hand drawn art.

[25:26] A great rule set which we know Keith is gonna provide.

[25:30] If the games are shipping the day they reveal them.

[25:32] You know, there's no weak point.

[25:34] I've always said this.

[25:35] Every Jersey Jack machine always had an Achilles heel.

[25:39] If you think guns and roses is the weak point,

[25:41] you're crazy.

[25:42] You're crazy.

[25:43] Everyone in the world knows who slashes.

[25:45] Everybody in the world knows who slashes.

[25:48] And you know, and guns and roses music is iconic.

[25:50] If you don't think so, you're crazy.

[25:52] All right, so like I think this game

[25:54] just checks all the boxes.

[25:55] I also think people are gonna start to realize

[25:58] we deserve games this good.

[26:01] This is what Pimbal should be.

[26:03] This level of excitement, the launches should get us

[26:06] going like this.

[26:07] These are expensive games.

[26:09] We've been so used to the cookie cutter approach.

[26:11] It's just been so cookie cutter.

[26:13] You know, have Zach Sharp in a black room

[26:15] and just show a minute of the game.

[26:17] And then you stream the game to death

[26:19] and you do the same boring reveals

[26:21] and you do these confusing streams on Twitch.

[26:23] And that's it.

[26:24] And that's how you launch a Pimbal machine.

[26:25] And then we're on to the next.

[26:27] No, this did it right.

[26:29] This got everybody excited.

[26:31] And I'm already starting to see.

[26:32] Here's the other thing I want you guys to do.

[26:34] Don't go on Pinside.

[26:36] Just enjoy this.

[26:37] I'm already starting to read losers on Pinside.

[26:40] I'm serious.

[26:41] If you don't like this pin, what are you doing in Pimbal?

[26:45] Like I already see people starting to complain,

[26:47] starting to break down things.

[26:48] Oh, you can get the speaker bar for 70 bucks at Walmart.

[26:51] There are so many joyless people on Pinside

[26:55] that they're gonna try and now complain about this

[26:58] and complain about that.

[27:00] I don't think there's anything to complain about with this game.

[27:03] In fact, once you see this game being played,

[27:05] you're gonna be blown away.

[27:06] And I would urge you.

[27:08] I would urge you.

[27:08] I mean, the sentiment on Pinside is predominantly positive.

[27:11] It is.

[27:12] But you can start to see those cranky people

[27:15] who can't even afford one.

[27:17] You can start to see those cranky people creeping in.

[27:20] And you can't tell me if you just bought an Avengers.

[27:23] If you just bought an Avengers,

[27:25] you can't tell me that you didn't wake up

[27:27] and see all this today and say, damn,

[27:30] maybe I should have weighed it.

[27:32] I should have listened to Canada and just weighed it.

[27:34] Right?

[27:35] And I love that people are like,

[27:36] whoa, it doesn't have to be one or the other.

[27:39] But that's also like BS.

[27:40] Because nobody wants to spend $20,000 in one month on Pimbal.

[27:45] And if you just bought an Avengers LE for $9,200

[27:49] and now you see this,

[27:51] well, you're 20 grand in now.

[27:53] In one month on a Pimbal purchase.

[27:56] And nobody wants to be $20,000 into Pimbal.

[28:00] I think everyone just wants a great game.

[28:02] If I could give Jersey Jack some advice, it's this.

[28:06] Just do this once a year.

[28:08] Make this happen once a year

[28:11] and you will sell so many of these games

[28:14] and we will be satisfied.

[28:16] I don't think you need to get to the level of Stern.

[28:18] Let's Stern be Stern.

[28:20] Let's Stern sell four to five games a year.

[28:22] Let them sell 20,000 games globally a year.

[28:26] Let them maybe just sell of your Jersey Jack,

[28:29] maybe sell 5,500 at a premium price,

[28:32] but make every game matter.

[28:35] Make it worth it.

[28:36] I'd much rather have one of these

[28:38] than four to five cookie cutter games

[28:40] that just always feel like recycled ideas.

[28:43] When you look at this game and you look at what's in it,

[28:45] you're not seeing this level of creative thinking

[28:49] over at the other manufacturers.

[28:51] I mean, there are some manufacturers now

[28:53] which you can't even put into the conversation anymore.

[28:56] What a wake up call this was to Deeproot Pimbal.

[28:59] Steve Bowden woke up today

[29:00] and shared another page from the Razakomak book.

[29:03] Ironically in which Ned is saying drumroll please.

[29:06] I mean, think about how delusional

[29:09] their marketing is right now.

[29:11] This is what people wanted, a game, a real game,

[29:13] on a line in a box.

[29:15] This is all we want, a magical game,

[29:18] on a line that you can buy.

[29:20] And what I love about the footage that Zack took,

[29:22] where does it take place?

[29:24] Where does it take place?

[29:25] Not in the special design room.

[29:27] It doesn't take place in the auditorium.

[29:30] It takes place in the factory.

[29:32] All we see in the background is Jersey Jack's factory.

[29:36] That's what it takes to make Pimbal.

[29:38] So I think it's an amazing day for Pimbal.

[29:40] I think Ken and team over there did an incredible job.

[29:43] I think Eric has designed a game

[29:45] that is going to be the talk of the town for a very long time.

[29:50] I even think people are not going to be clamoring anymore

[29:52] for more pirates.

[29:53] I think this is going to scratch the itch for so many people.

[29:57] And then some, I can't wait to see your reaction

[30:00] when you see it being played.

[30:01] I am completely exhausted.

[30:03] I have no energy left.

[30:05] And I hardly have any money left

[30:07] after all the money I just put down on this game.

[30:10] An amazing day for Pimbal.

[30:11] They just showed everybody how it's done.

[30:14] Not just from a marketing standpoint,

[30:17] but from a game standpoint.

[30:19] This is what we want.

[30:20] They have now raised the bar.

[30:22] This is good for everybody out there.

[30:24] You best believe Keith L. Win is looking at this saying,

[30:27] I can do this too.

[30:29] You best believe the other companies out there

[30:31] know that this is the new bar.

[30:33] I mean, how is Steve Richie going to show Led Zeppelin

[30:35] if it comes nowhere near this level of creativity

[30:39] and integration with the band?

[30:40] I mean, seriously, how are you going to show a music pin

[30:42] after this?

[30:43] This just changed music pins forever.

[30:46] It did.

[30:47] And you're going to see why when we get streams tonight

[30:50] and this week, and it's a great day, everybody.

[30:53] Have an amazing night.

[30:54] I'm so happy you all get to finally see what I've been

[30:57] hyping all of these months.

[30:59] And please, forgive me for Willy Wonka.

[31:01] It's over.

[31:02] I know I made a mistake.

[31:04] This is so much better than Willy Wonka.

[31:06] And I know you know it.

[31:07] And that's why I knew I wasn't going to pull another

[31:10] Wonka, guys.

[31:11] Have a great night.

[31:12] We'll talk to you soon.

[31:13] Oh, it's part of time.

[31:15] This is how we do it.

[31:17] Straight up, come back on the west side.

[31:19] This is how we do it.

[31:21] Oh, Steve got the flavor.

[31:24] Yeah.

[31:25] This is how we do it.

[31:26] This money doesn't feel like nobody does.

[31:29] Tell how it is.

[31:31] Come on now.

[31:32] Just tell me.

[31:33] You know that this is how we do it.

[31:35] It's a huge deal.
