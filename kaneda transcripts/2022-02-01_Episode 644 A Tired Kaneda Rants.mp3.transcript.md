[00:00] Last name ever, first name greatest, like a spring ankle, boy ain't nothing to play with.

[00:06] CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU

[00:10] Alright, can I do a podcast that's just gonna drop 20 minutes of truth? That's all I'm gonna do.

[00:15] I see all these other shows going hour and 90 minutes. There's nothing to talk about in the pinball world right now.

[00:21] Well, maybe there is. Maybe someone out there is unboxing a fathom. Not happening.

[00:26] So, Canada's gonna give you 20 minutes of how I really feel about this pinball hobby right now.

[00:31] And I wanna talk about last year and going into 2022, what I'm excited about and what I'm disappointed in,

[00:38] and I'm not gonna hold back. Let's do a little bit of the old school Canada, right?

[00:42] Let me tell you what I really feel. I feel that if you remove Godzilla from 2021,

[00:48] it was probably one of the worst years in pinball for all of us when it comes to these games and these manufacturers.

[00:55] And putting magic under the glass. Right, remove that one game.

[00:59] If any of you saw the Pinball Industry Awards last weekend, Zach and Greg, they did a great awards show.

[01:05] Godzilla won everything. Godzilla's gonna win everything at the Twippies this year.

[01:11] But why is it when there are so many companies and so many games and so much effort and so much creativity

[01:20] and so many games from yesteryears that show us amazing ways to make pinball machines come to life,

[01:28] we only get one game in an entire year that is noteworthy, that is winning everything.

[01:35] Can only Keith Elwin do this? Can nobody else make a pinball machine as magical as Keith Elwin?

[01:42] Okay, so let's remove Godzilla from the table. Then what else happened in 2021 that we are like,

[01:48] wow, that was incredible. Was it Led Zeppelin? No. Was it Mandalorian? Nope.

[01:54] Was it all the Guns N' Roses play field issues? Nope. Was it Spooky Pinballs?

[01:59] Two titles which you can't find anyone to buy your spot now for 50% off? Nope.

[02:04] And I want to address this real quick. There are people on pinside that are blaming me for the reason why people are not excited about these two games.

[02:13] When are we going to start pointing the fingers at the companies making these games, making millions of dollars,

[02:19] letting all of the great talent walk out of the institution? Are you wondering why these games are not special?

[02:25] Because all of the people who made the other games really special are gone. And this is what you get.

[02:31] You get the B team. Is this even the B team? Maybe it's the C team. They need to learn how to make these games great.

[02:36] And it's not Canada's fault. I'm not the one who took your money. I'm not the one who put millions of dollars in the bank.

[02:42] I can't even get most people to give me $5 a month, let alone millions of dollars to make a pinball machine.

[02:47] So what? We also had Haggis come out in 2021. Take your money on Fathom, which they said would be on the line in July.

[02:55] And then they said it would be summer. And then they said it would be the winter.

[02:59] And now they said games would be on the line in January. And I'm here to report on February 1.

[03:05] Not one single Fathom has been built. So once again, a pinball manufacturer has misled people.

[03:11] Oh my God, Canada's toxic. How can we have this podcaster? Well, at least I'm behind the paywall now.

[03:16] So not everybody is hearing this. So it was like a dead year, but it wasn't really a dead year, right?

[03:21] Because we also got Cactus Canyon remake is coming out sometime in the near future.

[03:27] We waited three years for Cactus Canyon remake. They bring it into Pinball Expo, arguably the worst launch of a game ever.

[03:35] And then the games aren't even on the line. And then we get Legends of Vahala for $8,700.

[03:40] And there's nobody out crying about that. You can just charge whatever you want.

[03:43] Stern can march in and $9,000 premium. And nobody said anything. It was an amazing year to witness.

[03:50] Everyone started to go bonkers with used game prices.

[03:54] I mean, you know right now, do you know right now how much money you have to make before taxes to buy a pirate to the Caribbean Collector's Edition?

[04:04] You have to make $70,000 to be able to afford a Pirates of the Caribbean Collector's Edition.

[04:12] Is that not the moment where this hobby has jumped the shark? I was there people. It's like I'm Taylor Swift.

[04:18] I remember it all too well. I was there when Pirates of the Caribbean Collector's Edition could not sell for $12,500.

[04:28] You couldn't give them away. They were sitting in boxes for a year.

[04:33] I was there when nobody wanted Stranger Things LE for an entire year.

[04:38] I was there. I remember it all too well when Willy Wonka Collector's Editions were sitting at distributors for a year.

[04:46] One distributor had 35 of them unsold. And what happened?

[04:51] People went on Pinside and they got a little FOMO and the guy sold everyone within a week.

[04:57] And that is where we're at. You don't even need great games. You don't need anything other than a bunch of FOMO

[05:05] and a bunch of people who are bored at home. COVID has mentally hit all of us.

[05:11] And maybe it's hit Canadian the hardest with this show right now.

[05:15] But I'm not going to go crazy. I'm not going to go John McClain on everybody.

[05:19] I'm crawling through an air conditioning vent being like, they said buy a stern John. It would be fun, John.

[05:26] There's no way premiums will ever be $9,000, John. Yes, turn inside and connect it, John.

[05:33] We're using QR codes in 2022. Acting like this is new technology. It's not. It's not. This is not new technology.

[05:42] It's amazing. QR codes in 2022 we are celebrating as innovation in Pimbal.

[05:48] So 2021, it was a total bust for Pimbal. It really was.

[05:53] I mean, Godzilla is a great game. But again, shouldn't we have more than just one great game in Pimbal through an entire year?

[06:02] Can you imagine if there was only one good movie or one good TV show or one good bottle of wine or one good car that came out?

[06:11] Why is it that this hobby that has so many people just waiting to throw money at these companies,

[06:18] we can't get more great games out in one fiscal year? Is that a lot to ask for?

[06:26] Like this same pattern over and over and over again, where every three to four months Stern launches a game,

[06:33] everyone considers it to be the greatest game ever, then we look at it and realize there's really not that much in it.

[06:39] But if you're a fan of this theme, it's going to be fun.

[06:42] Then we have nothing from CGC and we almost have nothing from Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[06:47] See, here's why 2021 was such a bust. It wasn't because of Stern's lack of effort.

[06:53] It wasn't. Stern does what Stern does and Stern did it successfully.

[06:58] This company is now almost a year backlogged on both pro and premium orders of their machines.

[07:06] Stern Pimbal could not release a new game for an entire year and still not fulfill all of their orders they have.

[07:15] That is crazy. So Stern Pimbal had another Stern Pimbal year. They are making so much money.

[07:22] They are doing what they do best. Everybody else, and I mean this, everybody else in the Pimbal world in 2021

[07:30] was an utter and complete disaster. If you really look at how their year transpired,

[07:37] who had a good year in 2021? Who? Spooky Pimbal? Because they sold those games in one day.

[07:43] They didn't have a good year. They had a good financial year.

[07:46] But the impact of these games being where they're at, it is really going to severely hurt this company.

[07:52] There is nobody excited. You cannot find anybody but Roder Dave excited about what is happening over at Spooky Pimbal.

[07:59] So Spooky Pimbal, I think, had a bad year in 2021.

[08:03] Haggis Pimbal, don't even get me started on Haggis Pimbal. Another dead year for them.

[08:08] Pimbal Brothers, Dutch Pimbal, Dutch Pimbal is still making a game that they revealed seven years ago.

[08:17] Seven years ago, Dutch Pimbal has to get up every day and work on games that people ordered from them seven years ago.

[08:25] And we're still cheerleading this company? No, come on. I mean, this is ridiculous.

[08:30] The Big Lebowski is so ridiculous. It is one of the biggest calamities in the history of Pimbal.

[08:37] And there is no way, and we all know this, they're never going to make everybody whole.

[08:42] They're not. There is no way every EA gets their game. What year is that going to happen?

[08:48] 2027? Like 15 years after I ordered my game, I'm going to get it.

[08:53] I mean, it's just, it's absolutely crazy. And then we got P3 Multimorphic.

[08:57] Jerry's still trying to sell like 500 games after like 500 years.

[09:02] I mean, how many years is this platform going to be marched around to every show?

[09:06] And are you seeing any unboxings of P3 Multimorphic at all this year?

[09:11] Like, I'm not seeing any of it. Am I being too cruel? Is this the old Canadian have I had no sleep?

[09:17] I haven't. Have I had a cup of coffee? I have. Have I had breakfast? No.

[09:21] Do you want to hear more like diehard impersonations right now?

[09:24] Should I do a little Hans Gruber when talking about P3?

[09:27] Just another ridiculous platform that nobody really wants.

[09:32] Just another unlicensed theme from a platform nobody wants.

[09:37] That's P3 Multimorphic. Okay, people, like, come on.

[09:40] We've got misses from everybody else. Then we've got Chicago Gaming Company.

[09:45] The worst kept secret in all the pinball. They revealed the game at Expo and the games were not on the line.

[09:51] And now nobody knows when they're getting their LE.

[09:54] Nobody knows what the status of the code is now. And it's a remake.

[09:58] It's a remake. How many times can we remake the old stuff?

[10:03] Why can't Chicago Gaming Company actually show us a new game?

[10:07] Like, where's the Mark Richie game? Where's Mark Richie's Pulp Fiction, which is happening?

[10:11] Where is it? Where's Ben Hexgame? Where's Christopher Franche's stuff that he's been working on with Chicago Gaming Company?

[10:18] Where is this stuff? This industry just doesn't move anything forward unless the company is called Stern Pinball.

[10:27] Why can't people move stuff forward? Why are we buying games in 2021 that are not even close?

[10:35] They're not even close to being as magical as stuff we got in the mid-90s. What is wrong with people?

[10:41] How can you actually plunk money down on the table for a game like Legends of Vahala

[10:48] when for less money you could go get an Addams family? You could go get a Twilight Zone?

[10:54] You could go get a Dialed In? I mean, it is crazy to me that Dialed In is cheaper than Legends of Vahala.

[11:01] Who are the 500 people that decided to buy Legends of Vahala for $8,700? I would like to know who they are,

[11:08] because they're the reason why this hobby is just in the weirdest space ever right now,

[11:16] because you shouldn't be able to sell stuff unless it's great.

[11:19] You shouldn't be able to command this kind of money unless there's a magical world under glass,

[11:24] and yet all I see is anything sells. And in a world in which anything will sell, then nothing needs to be innovated.

[11:32] In a world in which anything will sell, you don't need magic if anything sells, and that is where we're at.

[11:39] And I think this climate of anything will sell as long as it's in a box.

[11:44] If there's any inventory by distributors, they'll find a customer. That's not good for Pinball.

[11:49] That is not good for Pinball at all. And the thing I'm dreaming of is that customers within the Pinball space will actually one day speak with their wallets

[12:00] and say, I'm not buying that if that's not good enough.

[12:04] But since I've been covering this hobby, the last couple years have been the worst in terms of like anything will sell.

[12:12] Anything will sell. You could put out Led Zeppelin, Ellie, Baron Led Zeppelin, and it's sold out.

[12:19] Everything will find a customer. And that is not good. That is not good.

[12:24] The reason why the Pinball machines were so amazing in the mid-90s, you know why they were so amazing?

[12:30] Do you know why the Ballet Williams games were filled with magic?

[12:33] Is because they were not competing with like Gottlieb and Stern and Data East for a spot in your living room rich man listening to this right now?

[12:43] The reason why Pinball machines were so amazing in the mid-90s and they put so much under the glass is for one simple reason.

[12:51] They needed to make games magical enough to compete with the arcade games.

[12:56] They needed stuff under that glass that would pull you away from Donkey Kong, from Street Fighter, from Mortal Kombat, from Pac-Man.

[13:05] That was their competition. They were using Pinball to create something magical enough that it would pull people away from those arcade and video games.

[13:15] And they were magical.

[13:17] Now think about nowadays, who is Stern competing with? Nobody. They have no competition.

[13:23] There is not a single Pinball company out there that even makes Stern think twice about the games it's making.

[13:30] Their only competition is themselves. The only thing they're competing against is how much can I get into this game to keep it within the bomb?

[13:39] Like that is it. That is it. The creativity is limited to the bomb.

[13:44] But how much better would Stern games be if Jersey Jack had their act together?

[13:49] How much better would Stern games be if Dutch Pinball was successful?

[13:53] How much better would all of these games be if each of these companies were successful in making great games?

[14:01] But that has not been the case and you guys know I'm right. Like deep down inside, when you see the price of these machines now and you see $11,000 for Stern LE and $9,000 for a premium and $13,000 for a big Lebowski

[14:16] and you're going to see the new Jersey Jacksies be like $15,000 when you start looking down at these things and at these prices, are you seeing what you're paying for?

[14:27] The only reason these games are priced at these prices are not because of what they're putting into the games.

[14:34] The only reason they're being priced at this price point is because they know we're all a bunch of suckers who will spend this much money.

[14:42] That is it. The moment we all stop spending this much money on these games, the prices would either go down or they'd have to pack these games with more fun stuff to make them enticing.

[14:54] But Stern's got everybody beat. They've got everybody beat because they know they don't have to do that.

[15:01] The Stern army is the greatest thing Stern ever created. They've got all these fanboys.

[15:07] They've got these beautiful colorful games and then when you lift up the hood on the game, look how little is underneath those games.

[15:14] There's so little to see. There's so little to break because all the stuff now is mostly on the artwork and on the LCD screen and they know that.

[15:25] They know that. Elvira House of Horrors. Do you think Stern would have made that game? Dennis Nordman made that game.

[15:32] I mean, look at the mechs in most of these Stern games. Look at the mechs in them.

[15:36] Putting the building in Godzilla does not erase the fact that when you look at most of these Stern games and you look at what's in them, it's a joke, people.

[15:44] I mean, look at Led Zeppelin. Look at Mandalorian. Let's just stay on Mandalorian for a minute.

[15:50] Look at the mechanisms in Mandalorian and you tell me that this is worth this much money, that they really engineered a marvelous thing with that game.

[16:00] Am I missing something? All right. So I was missing lunch and I took a break. I listened to those like 16 minutes and now I'm back.

[16:08] I've lost a little bit of my voice. But what I want to do to end this podcast is I want to be completely transparent with you about how I feel.

[16:16] I think last year was a miss in the pinball hobby. I think you're going to see it during the awards show in March.

[16:21] I think you're going to realize that one game, winning everything, is pretty boring.

[16:26] It is boring and we want more competition and I want more companies out there to give us games that are worthwhile.

[16:34] Like why would you make a pinball machine if you don't feel like this machine is great?

[16:39] Why would you bring something into the pinball marketplace if you don't think this thing is improving upon what's already in the marketplace?

[16:48] But you and I all know the answer to this question. Why? Because some companies just fundamentally lack the talent.

[16:56] Some companies fundamentally lack the resources and finances needed to secure great themes.

[17:02] So you take a company like American Pinball. I know I rag on them all the time, but they don't have the money to go get a great licensed theme.

[17:10] They don't. So they'll try to convince us that we want original IP games. We don't. The market doesn't want it.

[17:17] And the only reason they're in this situation is because they had three swings at the plate and they messed up.

[17:23] And they should have just invested that money in one great theme from the very get-go.

[17:28] And themes like Masters of the Universe were available to them and they didn't get any of those themes.

[17:34] And now they've spent what? Three titles in a row, now four titles in a row, and they can't make a single game that can sell a thousand units.

[17:42] And why go into pinball if you can't figure that out? And then there's all these other games from yesteryears that just won't die like Alien and like the big Lebowski.

[17:51] And both of these companies, we're not going to see more games from these companies. Does anyone want to see more games from these companies?

[17:58] They can't really get their act together. They can't ship you a game when you buy it.

[18:03] If you order a game from Dutch Pinball or the Pinball Brothers, you're waiting like eight to nine months to maybe get your game.

[18:10] Maybe. And you don't feel confident and you don't feel good about ordering those games.

[18:15] So who is the competition to stern pinball? Is it Chicago Gaming Company?

[18:19] I mean, they're not showing anything revolutionary or new. That's boring.

[18:24] So the only real competition, and I mean it when I say this, the only real competition to stern pinball in terms of making a magical game, a magical world under glass, is Jersey Jack Pinball.

[18:37] And that is why this hobby sucked so much in 2021. The one reason it sucks so much, there was no new Jersey Jack game.

[18:46] Without a new Jersey Jack game per year, this hobby is not that exciting to follow. It's just not.

[18:54] They spend a lot of time and a lot of effort on each game. They put so much into each game.

[19:01] Now, it's unfair, right? Imagine if stern pinball only made one new game every 18 months the way Jersey Jack does.

[19:09] Imagine if their coding team had like a year and a half to work on just one game.

[19:15] Jersey Jack spends three times the amount of effort and focus on each title than stern pinball does.

[19:22] And here's the part that kind of sucks. Because of that, a Jersey Jack game should be three times better than every single stern machine.

[19:32] And you and I both know that that's not the case. That's not what's happening in pinball.

[19:37] But in 2022, we are finally going to get Pat Lawler's next game.

[19:42] And all of a sudden, we're going to have something else to at least be some competition for stern.

[19:48] Something else that will at least want to make you call up your distributor and think about getting something else.

[19:54] We need more variety in this hobby. We need more competition in this hobby.

[19:59] If we don't get it, we are going to see stern continue to raise their prices.

[20:05] They're not putting more in these games. It just pains me to see people look at a game like Rush and just hand over $11,000 for an LE.

[20:16] $11,000 and then $9,000 for premiums and $6,700 for pros.

[20:23] Like stern is just going to keep charging more and more and more and we're not getting more.

[20:28] And it doesn't seem like anyone else is upset about any of this.

[20:32] I guess it just doesn't matter to most people. I guess if the game is fun, you'll pay whatever and anything will sell.

[20:39] And I mean that. And I really hope Jersey Jack pinball can come out with a game that is problem free.

[20:45] I know this has been a little bit of a ranty show. It's not going to be like this every time.

[20:51] I'm pretty exhausted. I'm pretty tired. I'm seeing these prices continue to go through the roof and I don't see an end in sight.

[20:58] In fact, I think it's only going to get worse in 2022.

[21:02] I was bored by most of the pinball machines that came out in 2021.

[21:07] I don't want to be bored. I want to be excited.

[21:10] I want to get excited about Mandalorian and then have the pinball machine actually exceed my expectations.

[21:16] I want Jersey Jack pinball to come out with a machine in 2022 that just excites everybody.

[21:22] I don't want the playfields to fall apart and I hope they can do it.

[21:25] Right Jersey Jack with all the effort and all the focus, they haven't really been that successful.

[21:32] Wizard of Oz was a hit. Then the Hobbit was a miss. Then dialed in was a miss.

[21:37] Then Pirates of the Caribbean was a miss. Then Willy Wonka was like middle of the road and then Guns N' Roses was a hit.

[21:44] They really only have two games that arguably were hits.

[21:49] So thousands and thousands of units. People loved the game and the game brought something new to pinball.

[21:55] I would say that only Wizard of Oz and only Guns N' Roses have done that for Jersey Jack pinball.

[22:00] The other games haven't done that.

[22:02] They really have not brought anything truly unique or given us a totally unique experience in the world of pinball.

[22:09] And I think that's what we expect from a company that spends an inordinate amount of time focusing on just one game.

[22:16] Will 2022 be better than 2021? I hope so. I really do.

[22:21] Unfortunately, we're all going to get hit hard in our wallets and it's not just pinball. It's everywhere.

[22:27] But here's the thing and I understand why dealers are gouging. I understand why people are spending ridiculous amounts of money on secondhand prices.

[22:35] I wish I still had my Batman SLI to sell today because I could sell it for $40,000.

[22:42] I understand why the market is so hot and why the prices are so high.

[22:46] But there's one thing I think people in pinball don't seem to understand about me and maybe you feel this way.

[22:51] Our brains allow us to hold two competing thoughts in our head at one time.

[22:56] We're allowed to have an opinion in which the two things we agree with might be conflicting.

[23:02] Or even though I don't like the way prices are going, I absolutely agree with the sellers charging what they're charging because it's a free market.

[23:11] They'd be stupid not to ask these inflated prices because people are buying at these prices.

[23:17] I don't like it, but I understand and agree with that behavior and that's where we're at.

[23:22] I wish, I wish if I could put my little Canadian head on my pillow tonight, I just want to see more magic in these games.

[23:30] I mean this. So many of us just accept what we get and that was cool when games were like $5,000 or $6,000.

[23:36] Is that still cool when games are $9,000, $12,000, $15,000, $36,000.

[23:43] I need to make 70 grand before taxes to get a Pirate's CE.

[23:47] Ridiculous. I was there. I remember it all too well.

[23:52] This hobby is crazy right now. It is absolutely crazy right now.

[23:57] It's fun to see it go. I'm priced out now.

[24:00] Like I can't buy two or three pinball machines a year anymore.

[24:03] It's hard to even speculate on these games anymore because I don't think there's going to be money to be made on all these games anymore.

[24:09] And I think in a few years when the supply chain opens up, a lot of people are going to be caught holding the bag and needing to liquidate these pinball collections because people are just not going to care anymore.

[24:21] I think people are going to get burnt out by it. I think the community is going to be less fun.

[24:25] And I think these games are just not worth the experience.

[24:29] Do you agree or disagree with me?

[24:31] Canadianpinball.com. Thank you for the support. You can tell I'm tired.

[24:35] It's so hard for me to find time to do the show. And I'm going to still give you at least a show a week, probably more.

[24:41] I thank you guys all so much for the support. And I can't wait for 2022. I just can't because I think 2021 was a wash in the pinball world.

[24:49] And most of the games that came out were mediocre at best except for Godzilla.

[24:53] That's not what I want to say. I want to say everything next year is awesome.

[24:57] For these prices, they should be awesome. Have a good day, everybody.

[25:01] Canada out.

[25:27] Never mind.
