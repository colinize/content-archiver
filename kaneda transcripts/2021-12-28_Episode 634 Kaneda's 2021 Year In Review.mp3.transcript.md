[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada Spinball Podcast, I'm your host, Canada.

[00:29] On this episode of Canada Spinball Podcast, we are going to do the 2021 Pinball Year in

[00:36] Review.

[00:37] What kind of year was it?

[00:38] How many games came out?

[00:40] Were manufacturers struggling to get products out the door?

[00:45] Pinflation hit us really hard.

[00:46] Deep root pinball collapsed.

[00:48] When you really write it all down on one piece of paper and you see this is how many games

[00:53] came out and this is the kind of year it was, it is a very interesting year to discuss in

[00:58] the pinball world.

[01:00] So let's go right into it right now.

[01:02] What kind of year was 2021 for pinball?

[01:05] Well, let's look at the games that came out.

[01:07] Let's just go down a list of these were all of the games that shipped to customers in

[01:12] 2021.

[01:14] We had Led Zeppelin, we had Mandalorian, we had Godzilla, we have Jurassic Park Home

[01:20] Edition, we've got what else?

[01:22] We've got guns and roses machines were going out the door.

[01:26] We have Halloween and Ultraman.

[01:28] We have no cactus Canyon remakes.

[01:30] We have Legends of Vahala.

[01:33] We had some Celts being put together by Haggis Pinball.

[01:36] We had P3 Multimorphics sending out some Heist machines.

[01:40] We had Alien SE.

[01:42] We have the big Lebowski.

[01:43] That's a lot of machines, right?

[01:46] But when you add it all up and you look at all of these games and you just ask the very

[01:50] macro question, was it a year in which we got a lot of magical and ultra creative pinball

[01:57] machines?

[01:58] I would argue that Godzilla is the main attraction this year in the pinball world and everything

[02:03] else was sort of in the shadow of that big lizard.

[02:08] But let's do this.

[02:09] Let's go down the list of every manufacturer and talk about what kind of year I think they

[02:13] had because I do think it's a little bit of a mixed bag in 2021.

[02:18] I think every single pinball company experienced demand like never before, right?

[02:24] If you could put a pinball machine in a box, there were way more people who were ready

[02:29] to buy that game than you could supply.

[02:32] So there was demand through the roof and supply was very limited.

[02:36] So we saw stuff like Legends of Vahala like sell out immediately and that is why in this

[02:42] marketplace we saw prices of used games skyrocketing.

[02:46] We saw games like Pire to the Caribbean Collector's Edition, a game that sat in a box for a year

[02:53] for $12,500 that nobody wanted it for a year now is selling for $36,000 to $40,000.

[03:01] We saw games like Ghostbusters LE double in price.

[03:05] We saw games like Stranger Things LE.

[03:07] They were on eBay.

[03:09] LE's of Stranger Things for almost eight months.

[03:12] Nobody wanted them.

[03:13] And now a Stranger Things LE new in box would sell for $15,000 to $20,000, right?

[03:20] The entire pinball marketplace is hotter than hot.

[03:24] And so in this extremely hot market, does that mean that everyone succeeded?

[03:29] Does that mean everyone reached their goals?

[03:31] Does that mean we had an amazing 2021?

[03:34] Well let's go down the list right now.

[03:36] So I was going to start with Stern, but let's go from the bottom up because I think it's

[03:41] more fun to end with the big dogs.

[03:43] So we are going to start from the bottom up and I'm going to go through each pinball

[03:47] company and say what kind of 2021 I think they had.

[03:51] And I think I'm going to do it from a couple vantage points.

[03:54] I think as a business, what kind of year did they have?

[03:57] And just from a public relations consumer standpoint, how do I think the community viewed this company

[04:04] in 2021?

[04:05] And I'm going to do my best to channel all of your thoughts.

[04:08] And if you disagree with anything I say, just hit me up at CanadianPinball at gmail.com.

[04:14] Before we go into each company, we are going to start

[04:17] 2021 with the one major company that didn't make it, that failed in a colossal way.

[04:24] And that is the downfall of deep root pinball and what this did to the pinball community.

[04:29] Now I would argue that most people, most people saw through this company on day one.

[04:36] That is why most people did not order Raza when Robert Mueller opened up the order banks.

[04:42] They only sold an embarrassingly low number of 122 Razzas.

[04:48] That was proof enough that everyone saw through this BS.

[04:52] And so in 2021, we finally saw the collapse of deep root, the SEC filing.

[04:59] And it was much worse than anybody thought.

[05:02] This guy stole $60 million from other investors and this company was a fraud.

[05:10] It was a scam.

[05:11] And I still believe to this day that more people involved with this company should have came out

[05:17] and said stuff earlier on.

[05:19] Instead, they brought more people on board.

[05:22] But the good news is this, is that most people got their money back.

[05:25] Most people got their credit card charge backs.

[05:28] And ultimately the pinball community was not impacted that bad.

[05:33] It's all those poor old ladies that sent $1,500,000 checks to Robert

[05:38] that lost their life savings.

[05:41] And I do think that there is a little bit of a dark stain on the pinball community

[05:45] that we allowed J-pop another chance.

[05:48] That we weren't more vocal.

[05:50] That we weren't more upfront in shutting this thing down from the very beginning.

[05:54] And I think a lot of the people in the pinball community that joined forces with Robert Mueller

[06:00] have some responsibility and have some accountability to creating the entity

[06:06] that took all this money from outside people that had no idea they were investing in pinball.

[06:11] But you know what?

[06:12] Let's put a final nail in this coffin.

[06:14] Deeproot is done and Robert Mueller should be in jail.

[06:18] What a dramatic ending to this joke of a company and a joke of a man who thought he can make more

[06:24] games in one year than Stern, pinball.

[06:27] Bye bye Bobby.

[06:28] It's over.

[06:29] Okay.

[06:30] So let's go from the bottom up.

[06:31] Homepin.

[06:32] Mike over there in Taiwan has said that he is making spinal tap pinball.

[06:37] Now we have not seen anything other than a few teasers that he was contractually obligated to get out the door.

[06:44] So it's basically another dead year for home pin pinball.

[06:47] This is a company that is really in probably last place in the entire pinball world.

[06:53] And so do we think spinal tap will be any good in 2022?

[06:58] I really don't know.

[06:59] From the pictures I've seen, I don't think this company can compete on any level with what's in the pinball marketplace.

[07:07] And with so many companies providing products, why would you send your money here?

[07:12] That's just my thoughts on home pin.

[07:14] I don't think spinal tap is going to be a game that wins many people over.

[07:18] All right.

[07:18] Dutch pinball.

[07:19] The big Lebowski.

[07:21] What kind of year did Dutch pinball have?

[07:23] Well, it's sort of like the same year over and over and over for Dutch.

[07:28] It is kind of like a Groundhog Day reporting on this company.

[07:32] They are slowly getting big Lebowski's out to people.

[07:36] There are still a lot of EAs that are owed games.

[07:41] And I would have liked to have seen them made more EAs whole, but I didn't.

[07:46] So what kind of year did this company have?

[07:48] I think this is a company that just wants to get these games done.

[07:52] And then I don't think we're ever going to see a game two from Dutch pinball.

[07:57] I just don't.

[07:58] I really don't.

[07:58] I don't know how long they can keep this up.

[08:01] With the price of raw materials going through the roof in 2021,

[08:06] I also think this whole charging more to make the old buyer's whole

[08:11] isn't really working out in their favor.

[08:14] So I think Dutch just had another Dutch year.

[08:17] I don't think most people care about Dutch that much anymore.

[08:20] And I don't think there's much attention on this game.

[08:24] And I think they have nobody else to blame, but themselves.

[08:27] All right, pinball brothers, alien pinball.

[08:30] Remember they announced this way back in December.

[08:34] They said we're going to be making alien pinball with an Italian manufacturer.

[08:39] And I will say this, if you're the pinball brothers, you got it done.

[08:43] You made the games.

[08:45] You started getting games to people.

[08:47] You just revealed your LV version of the game.

[08:50] And you know, look, what kind of year did they have?

[08:53] I think this is a sort of like mixed bag year for the pinball brothers.

[08:57] I think they got games out the door, but I think communication with their

[09:01] customers was pretty piss poor.

[09:03] I think anyone who was in on these games doesn't really feel ultra satisfied

[09:08] with the buying experience from the pinball brothers.

[09:11] And if you ordered this game, you kind of knew you were going on a journey

[09:15] that was very ambiguous.

[09:17] You did not know when you were going to get your game.

[09:20] You were probably told the ship is on the ocean, but who knows?

[09:24] You know, when you read the threads about alien pinball, it's such a mixture of this

[09:29] is the greatest, most immersive game of all time.

[09:32] And I'm having all these quality control issues, or I'm not sure when I'm getting

[09:37] my game.

[09:37] These guys don't communicate on any level.

[09:40] I ordered it so long ago.

[09:42] I've waited a year for my game.

[09:44] You know, so you've got alien.

[09:45] It's just another game that has been around for so long that has a little bit of a

[09:50] sordid history.

[09:52] And it's another product that I think most of us out there just don't care about.

[09:56] We just don't care about these failed pinball launches that keep relaunching and relaunching.

[10:03] Now, if you want a unique game, yeah, go get an alien pinball machine.

[10:07] And I hope it doesn't break down.

[10:09] But then they also had an interesting 2021 because we saw that they had queen pinball.

[10:15] And we saw that they brought it out to this like queen pop up store celebrating the band

[10:20] and do we think we're going to see queen pinball from the pinball brothers in 2022?

[10:25] It's another one.

[10:26] When you look at the game, maybe five years ago, this kind of product looked impressive.

[10:32] But in 2021, 2022, with what is coming out in the pinball marketplace, it looks dated.

[10:41] It looks a bit stale.

[10:42] It doesn't look like a modern pinball machine.

[10:46] So I bet the pinball brothers are satisfied they got games out the door.

[10:49] But I bet they're also like, this is really hard.

[10:53] This isn't as easy as we thought it would be.

[10:55] And I'm not sure they're going to stay in it for the long run.

[10:58] I'm really not.

[10:59] We'll see what happens.

[11:00] But I have a feeling the pinball brothers are going to fulfill all of their alien orders.

[11:05] And that might be it for the pinball brothers.

[11:07] All right.

[11:07] Okay. P3 Multimorphic.

[11:09] How is 2021 for Jerry and the P3 Multimorphic platform?

[11:13] Well, how many people out there show of hands have a P3 Multimorphic?

[11:18] This isn't a huge volume platform.

[11:20] I don't know how many they've sold to date.

[11:22] If I were to guesstimate how many P3s have been sold, I would say it's south of 300 units.

[11:30] Now Stern makes more pinball machines in a week than maybe Jerry has sold in seven or eight years.

[11:35] It is a very, very niche platform.

[11:38] And the heist is definitely like their best offering to date.

[11:41] But as we know, nothing they've made to date has created a surge in demand for the product.

[11:48] And, you know, I think we all were expecting in 2021 for them to reveal their license theme.

[11:54] We didn't get it.

[11:55] We didn't get it at Expo.

[11:57] Maybe we'll get it at TPF.

[11:59] But it was pretty much a stale year for P3 Multimorphic.

[12:04] It also probably was a year in which Jerry was delivered a pretty harsh financial blow

[12:10] with Spooky Pinball moving away from the P-Rock platform.

[12:14] I'm pretty sure P-Rock drives all the big Lebowski's.

[12:17] Charlie was using P-Rock boards in all of his Rick and Mortys.

[12:20] And so 1,750 Spooky Games did not place an order with P-Rock.

[12:27] Charlie went with Ben Hex System.

[12:29] So it definitely was a year in which Jerry took a financial hit.

[12:32] All right. Haggis Pinball.

[12:35] What kind of 2021 did Haggis Pinball have now?

[12:39] We all know what Haggis has been going through.

[12:42] This company in 2021, they came out and they said they were remaking Fathom.

[12:47] They were making this beautiful mermaid edition.

[12:50] They were making 250 of them.

[12:52] We know the story.

[12:54] They took money.

[12:55] They took pre-order dollars.

[12:56] Those pre-order dollars were non-refundable.

[12:59] They said production would start in July, July, August, September, October, November, December.

[13:06] Now, Damon is saying that January is when production will start on Fathom.

[13:11] I asked a few weeks ago if production was going to start in January.

[13:16] Could you show us pictures of the parts?

[13:18] Because you can't start making this game unless you have the parts in-house.

[13:22] Nobody really feels strong enough to ask that question.

[13:26] And he has not shared with the community where the parts are for the game.

[13:30] Instead, he's sending out Christmas cards.

[13:32] Now, what kind of year was it for Haggis Pinball?

[13:35] I'm not going to beat around the bush.

[13:36] This was a bad year for Haggis Pinball.

[13:38] They staffed up.

[13:39] They got into this big factory.

[13:42] They hired 20 employees.

[13:44] And then COVID really locked stuff up for them.

[13:47] I mean, COVID really did hit Australia really, really hard.

[13:51] And the lockdowns there were much more harsh than other parts of the world.

[13:55] So this was kind of like a nightmarish year if you're Haggis Pinball.

[13:59] There is no way around it.

[14:01] They got a few Celts out the door.

[14:03] But for the most part, Haggis Pinball has been burning money

[14:07] and has not been able to make fathom.

[14:10] And so hopefully in 2022, they can turn a corner and start getting the game on the line

[14:17] that they took money for six months ago.

[14:20] But I bet Damien is having a lot of sleepless nights.

[14:23] And I bet he is really feeling the pain of Pinball manufacturing.

[14:27] I think he ran into it with the best of intentions.

[14:30] I don't think he's in this to rip people off.

[14:32] But I think he's learned how hard it really is.

[14:36] It's one thing to make a few Celts.

[14:39] It's another thing to say you're going to make 500 of another game.

[14:43] And it's an even harder thing to start planning games three, four and five.

[14:47] And you're scaling up for the future.

[14:50] But you haven't figured out how to make it work in the present day.

[14:54] And I think he might have bit off a little bit more than they could chew.

[14:58] I think he scaled up too fast.

[15:00] And if you look at the way Spooky did it, they did it right.

[15:03] I would argue that Haggis has not done it right.

[15:06] I would argue that Haggis has skipped a few steps in how they're scaling up.

[15:10] And I think they must be taking on water.

[15:12] No pun intended because it's mermaid.

[15:15] And I think it was a rough year from Haggis.

[15:16] I really, really do.

[15:18] But I do hope people get their fathoms in early 2022.

[15:22] Because if they don't, I do think people are going to become more restless and anxious.

[15:27] But ultimately, this also shows that nobody's learned a lesson when it comes to pre-ordering.

[15:34] We are still pre-ordering games that are not even close to being on the line.

[15:39] We are taking people's word for it.

[15:42] We're still doing it.

[15:43] This community in 2021 has proven once again that it has learned nothing.

[15:50] That it continues to say, hey, if you're a nice guy,

[15:55] and you can make game A slowly, I have total faith that you'll make game B,

[16:00] regardless of the context, regardless of how much more money it might require to make that game B.

[16:06] Very susceptible community we are to just believing in anyone's ambitions.

[16:11] But you know what?

[16:13] I think we all need to, moving into 2022, stop buying games unless they're on the line or in a box.

[16:20] Is it that hard?

[16:21] It's not that hard to just wait until something is actually made.

[16:25] All right.

[16:26] What kind of 2021 did American Pinball have?

[16:30] Now, I would argue that I think American Pinball probably had maybe the best year of any manufacturer.

[16:36] And I mean that.

[16:36] They probably had the best year of any manufacturer.

[16:40] Because American Pinball took the biggest gamble ever.

[16:44] They had the biggest risk.

[16:46] Releasing Legends of Vahala, an original IP game in which Canada was like, no way anyone's going to buy this thing.

[16:54] And on day one, they increased their order and their sell through to distributors from 300 units to 500 units sold through.

[17:03] So I think 2021 was an amazing year for American Pinball.

[17:08] They hit the market at the right time.

[17:10] I still don't think it was the right game at the right time, but it didn't matter.

[17:15] The market was so hot and distributors are thirsty for any new products in boxes because they're out of inventory.

[17:22] So it was a great time to come out with a game.

[17:25] Now, I would say that the only hiccup for them right now is they are not manufacturing these things fast enough.

[17:32] They got the orders.

[17:34] Where are the games?

[17:35] I am seeing slow, slow rolling out of this title.

[17:39] And I think the speed of their manufacturing is letting them down a little bit.

[17:44] I bet they would have liked a lot more Legends of Vahala's to have gone out the door before the end of the year.

[17:51] But still, that money is in the bank.

[17:54] And if you're David Fix, you have to be somewhat satisfied that your gamble paid off and you are moving on to Dennis Norman's original theme next.

[18:03] I still think this company will struggle with original IPs against licensed themes.

[18:09] But you know what?

[18:10] I can't fault them.

[18:11] They got a game out.

[18:13] And the market is hot and they're going to build these games.

[18:16] Like nobody is worried that they won't get their American Pinball game.

[18:21] The first three titles they launched all made their way to customers.

[18:24] There's no drama here.

[18:26] You might have to wait a little bit for your game.

[18:28] So I think American Pinball had a really good 2021.

[18:31] And I think if they're smart, they will sign up Sonic Spinball and they will stop with this nonsense.

[18:37] And they will make some of the finest homebrew games that are licensed and bring them to market.

[18:42] And David, if you make Sonic, you're going to sell a few thousand units.

[18:46] It'll be your most successful game of all time.

[18:49] And it's sitting there waiting for you to just green light it.

[18:53] Okay, please call Ryan McQuade and get Sonic Spinball made.

[18:57] Okay, next on our list of 2021 Pinball companies is Chicago Gaming Company.

[19:04] What kind of year did CGC have?

[19:06] Well, strange year, if you ask me for CGC.

[19:09] They revealed a game that we all knew was coming for years.

[19:12] So no surprise there.

[19:14] They revealed it in the worst way possible.

[19:17] It was probably the sloppiest pinball launch of all time.

[19:21] They legitimately didn't even know all the information about the game.

[19:25] They created consumer confusion about everything associated with Cactus Canyon.

[19:31] It was almost like they were making it up as they were going.

[19:34] They didn't really know the price.

[19:36] They didn't know if the translate was going to be included in this or that.

[19:39] They didn't know if the topper was going to be on every single unit.

[19:42] They didn't know this.

[19:43] They didn't know that.

[19:44] It just felt like this company, after having so many years to get this game to market,

[19:50] launched it in a way that showed absolutely no respect for themselves.

[19:55] Like the weirdest thing, right?

[19:57] All the years you've been spending making Cactus Canyon remake,

[20:00] and you didn't really have your ducks in a row.

[20:03] And it showed.

[20:03] And I think what they did with the LE and then the next day you've got the SE Plus,

[20:08] I think they burned everybody.

[20:10] I think Doug's mission backfired.

[20:12] Like we want to price these things at a great value,

[20:14] but now you don't even know the value.

[20:16] Doug, like no one really knows.

[20:17] Like how much is the Lyman sheets code going to cost?

[20:20] I have to add the translate to my order.

[20:23] At the end of the day, you add it all up.

[20:25] And this thing is going to be just as much, if not more, than a Stern LE.

[20:29] And so I'm not even sure they understand what's happening here.

[20:32] And also the games aren't on the line.

[20:34] So it was a really weird time for them to reveal the product because

[20:38] they're not manufacturing them.

[20:40] And we didn't see any SEs go out the door before the end of the year.

[20:44] We didn't see any LEs go out the door.

[20:46] In fact, I'm hearing the LEs are delayed till April May.

[20:50] So if that's the case, why didn't they just reveal this game at TPF when they were closer

[20:55] to launch, when they had all parts in-house?

[20:58] A really sloppy launch from a company that shouldn't be sloppy with their launches.

[21:03] They have a great product.

[21:04] They might make arguably the best quality pinball machines on the market.

[21:09] Everyone says it.

[21:10] These games are worth the wait.

[21:12] But in the marketing department and in the communication department,

[21:16] really, really sloppy.

[21:18] And I really hope they get their act together.

[21:20] And the other thing with CGC, and the reason why I consider 2021 to be kind of like a fail

[21:24] for them, is they need to get more than just one game out every three years.

[21:29] They need to.

[21:30] They need to also get that original licensed game out the door from Mark Ritchie.

[21:34] We keep hearing like what's coming from this company,

[21:37] but the future seems to take forever to get to with CGC.

[21:41] All right, spooky pinball.

[21:43] Spooky pinball.

[21:44] This is the one.

[21:44] Spooky pinball is the one when I think about companies that had mixed bag years.

[21:48] Spooky pinball is at the top of my list, because on one level,

[21:52] Spooky pinball had the greatest financial day of their lives when they announced 1750 games,

[22:00] 1250 Halloween's, and 500 Ultramans sold through in one day, sold through to distributors.

[22:07] So they had the greatest financial day of their lives.

[22:12] And from a financial standpoint, these guys are doing jumping jacks and cart wheels all the way to

[22:18] the bank.

[22:18] So was 2021 an amazing year for Spooky pinball?

[22:23] Well, then you look at the other side of the coin.

[22:26] They launched these titles and they were very incomplete.

[22:29] They launched these titles with a lot of bugs that made them nightmares for operators.

[22:34] They launched these titles with animations that weren't up to the standard of the industry.

[22:40] And there was just like a lot of confusion of what's going on here, Spooky.

[22:44] You've been around all these years.

[22:47] You know what people want and you came out with games and they weren't ready for the market.

[22:52] I think that's the best way to put it.

[22:54] These games were not ready for the market.

[22:57] And all of the goodwill that Spooky pinball has built up over the years.

[23:02] I do think that goodwill is in jeopardy because I think people ran to these games in 2021 simply

[23:09] because of FOMO.

[23:11] There are so few people out there that even know what Ultraman is or would want in Ultraman

[23:16] pinball machine.

[23:17] But why did they sell every single one?

[23:19] Because there was FOMO.

[23:21] We were watching all of these pinball machines flip for so much more money.

[23:26] And we all felt like, well, there's only 500.

[23:29] How can I lose money on an Ultraman?

[23:31] There's only 1,250 Halloween.

[23:34] How can I lose money on Halloween?

[23:37] It was like a sure bet.

[23:38] But now the market is showing everybody out there.

[23:41] If you bought a Halloween or an Ultraman,

[23:44] you're losing 50% of your deposit right away.

[23:49] These deposits for these collector's editions were $2,000.

[23:54] And go on Pinside today and everyone is trying to get rid of their spots who are trying to get

[24:00] rid of their spots.

[24:01] And they're taking a $1,000 hit.

[24:04] And it's impossible not to look at this behavior as somewhat of a failure.

[24:09] As a lack of faith and Spooky's ability to make these games great.

[24:14] I think people are basically saying with their wallets,

[24:17] we're unhappy and I'm never coming back to these shores.

[24:21] And I think it was a mixed bag year for Spooky.

[24:23] I think they made so much money with these games,

[24:26] but I don't think they invested enough in the talent over at Spooky.

[24:31] I don't think they invested enough in these games.

[24:34] I think they're trying to build the ship in the ocean.

[24:37] And I think people are seeing right through it.

[24:40] And they're saying, look, we understand that this sometimes takes a long time

[24:43] to get code into a game to polish a game.

[24:46] But when you're a company like Spooky, there's no excuse anymore

[24:50] because you're not making the amount of games stern is.

[24:53] When Jersey Jack Pinball comes out with a game, it's pretty complete.

[24:57] So for a company like Spooky that is focused on each title at a time,

[25:02] it was inexcusable how incomplete these games were.

[25:06] And it really feels like they handed this company over to more of the junior talent.

[25:11] They're not that experienced.

[25:13] They don't know fully what they're doing.

[25:15] And they lost a lot of their talent that made their prior games more enjoyable.

[25:21] So I think what's happened to Spooky Pinball is that even though they made so much money,

[25:26] we're seeing a product that is somewhat inferior to what's come before it.

[25:31] And that has made a lot of people lose some confidence in this company.

[25:35] And I think a lot of that goodwill has been eroded.

[25:37] And I don't think people are going to run to Spooky on the next title

[25:40] and just buy it because I can't lose money on it.

[25:43] I don't think they're going to be able to create another FOMO moment.

[25:46] And I said it like a year ago that Rick and Morty was the greatest theme

[25:50] they might ever get for a pinball machine.

[25:53] And that Rick and Morty is one that they're probably kicking themselves

[25:56] that they said they're only going to make 750 Rick and Morty's

[26:00] because that could have been their cash cow for years to come.

[26:03] But you know what?

[26:04] They said they're never making anymore.

[26:06] Not the best year from Spooky Pinball.

[26:08] Again, financially they crushed it, but the perception of their brand,

[26:12] I think, took a huge hit in 2021.

[26:14] All right, we got two more left.

[26:16] Can you tell who they are?

[26:17] We've got Jersey Jack Pinball and we've got Stern.

[26:20] So what kind of 2021 was it for Jersey Jack Pinball?

[26:24] Well, again, another company where financially you had a juggernaut year.

[26:30] You had so many orders for guns and roses.

[26:33] It overwhelmed your manufacturing line probably.

[26:36] It overwhelmed your schedule to get to the next game.

[26:39] And they probably got somewhere around 5,000 orders for guns and roses.

[26:44] And so the story of Jersey Jack Pinball in 2021, another mixed bag year on one level,

[26:52] financially amazing year for them, probably their best game to date.

[26:57] I think the consumers have spoken.

[26:58] This game is a masterpiece.

[27:00] For those who hate it, I don't know what to tell you.

[27:02] I think the game is a masterpiece.

[27:04] But that wasn't the story of 2021 for Jersey Jack, was it?

[27:08] We weren't talking about how great the game was.

[27:11] We weren't talking about how many they sold.

[27:13] We weren't talking about how this was finally a cool theme that wasn't a family friendly thing.

[27:19] The only thing we were talking about all year was the poor quality of the machine.

[27:25] Was the playfields falling apart again?

[27:28] It wasn't just the quality control issues that dominated Jersey Jack's 2021.

[27:34] It was their lack of response.

[27:36] And I think this is another company that even though they had financial success,

[27:42] their brand took a huge hit.

[27:44] And every time we talk about Jersey Jack Pinball now,

[27:48] it's an army of people complaining about quality.

[27:51] And it is crazy to me that throughout the entire year of 2021,

[27:57] Jersey Jack Pinball never came out with an official statement about the playfield quality.

[28:04] And you just have to think about that for a minute.

[28:06] A company turned its back on its customers by never officially saying anything.

[28:13] That's not good.

[28:14] That's not good.

[28:15] Now they were communicating behind closed channels to people with emails,

[28:20] but nothing was ever official.

[28:22] We did hear from Jersey Jack himself in 2021 in which he basically blamed consumers

[28:28] for the issues with the playfield.

[28:30] And we've heard that sound bite and Jack probably regrets saying that.

[28:34] I don't know what the problem is.

[28:36] I don't.

[28:36] I don't know if it's over-torquing.

[28:38] I don't know if it's Mirko.

[28:40] I don't know.

[28:41] What I can say is this is now like the fourth Jersey Jack machine in which the playfields

[28:46] have had issues.

[28:47] And so I think it created a dark cloud over Jersey Jack Pinball

[28:51] all throughout 2021.

[28:53] And even now as we look at like the Godfather rumor and all the new games coming out,

[28:58] Toy Story, you can't escape it.

[29:01] And I really hope in 2022, all I can hope for is that Jersey Jack Pinball solves this issue

[29:07] and comes out and says we've solved it.

[29:10] I don't know how they're going to prove they've solved it unless we play these games and they

[29:15] don't fall apart because no one's going to believe in some quality seal that Mirko puts on

[29:20] the playfields.

[29:21] It's going to come down to the actual product itself.

[29:25] And will they be able to ship Toy Story with no issues?

[29:28] I really hope, I really hope for their sake, that they have like 10 Toy Stories made already.

[29:35] And I mean CEs and LEs.

[29:38] I hope they're sitting in a private room and they are pressure testing these games like

[29:44] never before.

[29:44] And I doubt they're doing it because I bet they're trying to keep it a secret,

[29:49] like and not have it leak.

[29:50] But you know what Jersey Jack, you need to get over that.

[29:53] You need to put quality in front of secrecy.

[29:57] We know what the game is.

[29:58] We know it's Toy Story.

[29:59] So they would be smart to say, hey, look, we're going to put Toy Story on location for two months

[30:04] and have it be beat on before we turn on the assembly line because we want to make sure these

[30:09] playfields are bulletproof.

[30:10] I feel like everyone would stand up and applaud that move.

[30:14] Instead, I feel like we're going to get another like, well, we're all going to be guinea pigs

[30:18] when they ship this game.

[30:20] And who knows what the outcome will be.

[30:21] But it wasn't all quality control issues at Jersey Jack in 2021.

[30:26] We also got the big switch.

[30:28] They hired Steve Ritchie, right?

[30:30] The king of all pinball joins Jersey Jack Pinball.

[30:33] They also hired Mark Sadin or Seedon who did a Metroid pinball.

[30:38] So they brought two new designers into the company.

[30:42] And so on a surface level, Steve Ritchie joining Jersey Jack Pinball should seem like a

[30:48] humongous acquisition and some amazing move by the company.

[30:52] But I also think a lot of people are like, well, I don't know, you know, Steve Ritchie's

[30:57] last few stern games haven't really been the best.

[31:00] And Steve sort of been complaining that the bomb over at stern isn't good enough.

[31:04] And then we see what Keith Elwyn does.

[31:06] And so it's pretty clear that the new king at stern is Elwyn.

[31:10] And so will Steve Ritchie show us what he can do over at Jersey Jack Pinball?

[31:15] But again, it's 2021.

[31:16] And I think most people are like, we're not going to see Steve's efforts anytime soon.

[31:21] But Jersey Jack is saying that we will see two games in 2022.

[31:26] Have we heard that before?

[31:28] Jack has said that for years.

[31:29] So do we think they will actually get two new games on the line in 2022?

[31:35] I can tell you this, everybody hopes they do.

[31:37] But I'll believe it when I see it.

[31:40] All right, let's go over to stern pinball because this is a company that had a ton

[31:44] of activity in 2021.

[31:46] Let me go down the list of everything that stern did in 2021.

[31:49] They got Led Zeppelin out.

[31:51] Then we got Mandalorian.

[31:53] We got Godzilla.

[31:54] We got Elvira 40th, Jurassic Park Home Edition.

[31:58] We got Stern Insider connected.

[32:00] Talk about a huge thing, right?

[32:02] Stern connected its games using QR codes and the internet.

[32:07] We got Lyman Sheets left stern for CGC.

[32:10] That was big news as well.

[32:11] Jack Danger is hired as a new designer over at stern pinball.

[32:15] And we finally got new code for the Munsters after years of people complaining.

[32:20] Okay, so what kind of 2021 did stern pinball have?

[32:24] Well, obviously stern pinball is the number one pinball maker in the world.

[32:30] There is more demand for stern pinball machines than anywhere else.

[32:34] This is the number one company by far.

[32:37] They had an amazing 2021.

[32:40] Not only did they do this new stuff, but all of their old games are skyrocketing in value.

[32:47] If you're stern and you're looking at where this market is going,

[32:51] you are seeing nothing but dollar signs and googly eyes over there because they must be like,

[32:57] look, we've got it.

[32:58] We've got everyone right where we want them.

[33:01] We have now shown that we can sell games at $6,000 and $25,000 for pretty much the same

[33:10] product.

[33:10] It's crazy, but stern deserves it.

[33:14] And of all the pinball companies out there, this company deserves all the success they're having.

[33:19] They deserve all the demand they're having.

[33:21] I will say it and I've said it before, this company has the best pinball licenses.

[33:27] This company has the best teams.

[33:30] They have the best manufacturing capability.

[33:33] They have the best leadership.

[33:35] And ultimately, stern pinball, are you ready for it?

[33:38] Has the best quality.

[33:40] There is no one who even comes close to Stern's quality.

[33:46] And the thing about quality is this, go and try and make 15,000 games a year.

[33:52] Can you imagine if anyone else made the amount of games Stern makes?

[33:56] For the amount of games Stern pumps out the door, I rarely, and I mean this,

[34:01] I rarely open up threads about stern machines and see moaning and groaning about quality issues.

[34:07] There's nobody complaining about play field issues.

[34:10] There's nobody complaining that much about mech issues.

[34:13] For the most part, at the volume they create this game, they're the best quality in the whole industry.

[34:20] And then you could argue that they've got the best coders now and they're putting more into

[34:24] their games from a software standpoint than everybody else.

[34:28] Or at least, you know, they're up there, right?

[34:29] I mean because, you know, this isn't Jersey Jack, it's not like Stern just makes one game every 18 months.

[34:35] The fact that they make four to five games a year and all of them launch pretty complete now, right?

[34:41] We're no longer waiting two years for games to be done.

[34:44] These games are coming out the door with real polish and you're not going to regret buying a stern on day one anymore.

[34:50] Those days are over.

[34:52] Now that being said, do I think stern pinball from a consumer standpoint made the most

[34:58] magical games in 2021?

[35:00] And what was their portfolio like?

[35:02] Was it quality over quantity or quantity over quality?

[35:07] Led Zeppelin led the year for a stern pinball.

[35:10] Arguably, this game is one that everyone has forgotten.

[35:13] This is one of the stern LEDs that's not going up in price.

[35:16] This is one of the games that people look at and say, you know, Steve Ritchie kind of mailed it in.

[35:21] There's nothing really that innovative or creative about Led Zeppelin.

[35:25] And I also think this was Stern's response to Guns N' Roses and it was sort of like a pathetic response.

[35:31] I mean, even in their press release, they tried to say this is like going to a Led Zeppelin concert.

[35:37] If you put Led Zeppelin next to Guns N' Roses, it's embarrassing.

[35:42] And I don't care, you guys, complaining about Eric's multi-balls.

[35:45] I don't care.

[35:46] It's such a better game, Guns N' Roses.

[35:49] It's not even funny.

[35:50] And I know what the Steve Ritchie fanboys will say, but it shoots better.

[35:54] I'm sorry.

[35:54] It's really easy to make a game shoot better if there's nothing in it and nothing happening in the game.

[36:01] I mean, nothing shoots smoother than an empty playfield.

[36:04] People, wake up.

[36:05] All right.

[36:05] So Led Zeppelin and a dud.

[36:08] Then we get to Mandalorian.

[36:10] And don't forget, it was Canada who told you Mandalorian was coming.

[36:13] I mean, I put that rumor out there before anybody else.

[36:16] And so Mandalorian comes out.

[36:18] Brian Eddy's follow-up title to Stranger Things.

[36:21] Would Mandalorian have the magic of the show we all love?

[36:25] Would it create a world under glass that brought Baby Yoda and the Bounty Hunter world to life?

[36:30] And I would say this, Mandalorian, great theme.

[36:34] The theme integration is not there for me.

[36:37] And I just don't see the magic on the game itself.

[36:40] I understand that people who love this game and why they love it,

[36:43] but it's another one of these things where all the magic is in the software.

[36:48] It's not in the hardware.

[36:50] And I think Mandalorian should have been a game that had a lot more magical toys and wow moments

[36:56] happening on the playfield itself.

[36:59] I think it's a boring, uninspired design.

[37:02] And that's just my point of view on it.

[37:04] Now, I get it if you love it.

[37:06] But once again, I think Sturm Pinball has taken our love of Star Wars.

[37:11] And they've flushed it down the toilet.

[37:13] The fact that we don't have a Star Wars game

[37:16] that makes people as excited as like Ghostbusters or Lord of the Rings or Tron or Metallica

[37:23] is crazy.

[37:25] It is the greatest source material of all time.

[37:28] The Steve Ritchie Star Wars Pinball machine is arguably the worst theme integration in the

[37:34] history of theme integrations, considering what the source theme is.

[37:39] And I really think Stern should go give Star Wars to Keith Elwyn and try it again.

[37:45] Can we please just have Elwyn make everything we love?

[37:48] And we all knew Keith Elwyn's Godzilla was coming.

[37:51] It was so hyped and did it deliver on the hype?

[37:54] Obviously it did.

[37:56] Godzilla from Keith Elwyn has really been the juggernaut theme of 2021.

[38:01] It is arguably the most popular game of the year.

[38:04] It is going to win every single award that it is entered into.

[38:08] I would say that the only controversy around Godzilla was whether or not

[38:12] Zambietti's art style was the right fit for the Godzilla theme, considering it was Toho

[38:17] Godzilla.

[38:18] But for the most part, every time Keith Elwyn comes out with a pin, it's a special moment.

[38:25] He's arguably the best designer over at Stern Pinball right now and they are giving him a

[38:30] little bit more to work with when it comes to the bomb of the game.

[38:34] And then we had the surprise launch, which was Elvira's 40th, a $15,000 pinball machine

[38:42] that Stern Pinball let its distributors price themselves and they are selling for $15,000-$25,000.

[38:51] I think most of them are selling for closer to $25,000-$30,000 and Stern is only making $199,000.

[38:58] This is crazy because what Stern did with this launch of Elvira was they said to the distributors,

[39:04] you set the price much different than Stern selling Batman SLEs for $15,000.

[39:10] I think this is probably the most interesting move Stern did all year for collectors because

[39:16] they are going to start doing this more and more.

[39:19] They are going to start SLE dropping their hot titles and we heard Zach Manny talk about this,

[39:24] like he thinks a vault is coming.

[39:26] And you best believe it, if they vault any of their games that people want, well,

[39:31] what if they just make 200 special versions of Tron or Lord of the Rings or Metallica?

[39:37] You could go down a list of games, probably not Metallica, but you could go down a list.

[39:41] Imagine if they made more Ghostbuster games and there was a special version of only 200,

[39:47] the sky's the limit on what they could charge the collector.

[39:50] So if you were a collector, I think 2021 was a year in which you realized your wallet is in

[39:56] big trouble. It's in huge trouble. And I think for those of you out there who want to collect

[40:01] rare machines, you're looking at 40K, 35K for Pirates of the Caribbean CE, you're looking at

[40:08] $25,000 for Elvira 40th. It's crazy, right? Two hot pinball machines are now going to cost you

[40:15] $50,000 to $60,000 for just two machines. And all of a sudden this market starts to feel a little

[40:22] ridiculous, right? We start to feel like, how did it come to this? Like machines never used to be

[40:28] this much. And now the only good deal in town seems like MSRP if you get a game right when it

[40:34] comes out. So Elvira 40th though, smashing success for a stern pinball, it showed them that they have

[40:40] not hit any sort of ceiling. It also showed them that this is a future for them in the collectible

[40:46] space. They might as well just limit the supply of a special version of a game that won't really

[40:53] cost them more to make and they could charge $20,000, $30,000 and people will spend the money.

[40:59] We got Jurassic Park Home Edition and I think Jack Danger joining the team over there at Stern is a

[41:03] great move for Stern. Jack is a great personality and Jack's design skills, I think, past the test

[41:10] of a lot of people. I think when you jump on the Jurassic Park Home Edition, people have a lot of

[41:15] fun with that game. I mean, there's more in that game. There's more in that game than Legends of

[41:20] Vahala, right? The game shoots amazingly well and Jack Danger, I think, is going to have a really

[41:25] awesome future with Stern Pinball and I think he's a great ambassador for Stern in general. So Jack

[41:31] Danger joining the team, we kind of knew it. I think we're going to see him working on Foo Fighters

[41:36] in 2022. That's just my speculation. And then we had the big news of the year, which was Stern

[41:41] Insider connected. I mean, this is long overdue. Stern has tens of thousands of pinball machines

[41:47] out there in the world and now they're going to connect them all with Stern Insider connected.

[41:52] Absolutely, this is the biggest move and I bet more work went into this than all of their games

[41:59] combined in 2021 because this is going to open up so many new revenue streams for Stern Pinball. It

[42:06] is. It's also going to make playing pinball more enjoyable for all of us. If you have a game on

[42:12] location, this opens up so many new opportunities for bar and business owners to make these games

[42:18] fun to add achievements that can be connected to the business you're in. It also makes owning the

[42:24] game in your home more enjoyable to connect to people out there who also have that machine. And

[42:29] I love this. And I think this was long overdue for pinball and obviously Stern took their time and I

[42:35] think they're doing it right. Jersey Jacks got score a bit and that's great too. But connecting

[42:41] people in this community through the games themselves has really been lacking and it's crazy.

[42:46] We're at 2021, 2022 and internet connecting these games is still really not where it should be.

[42:54] But this is a first step in the right direction, but it does come with a little bit of a negative

[43:00] and that is this will also open up the door for DLC, which is downloadable content. And we know

[43:07] that Stern is going to find new and interesting ways to charge us money even after we buy the

[43:13] games. And I think that's the one part that people don't want. I don't want to spend $10,500 and then

[43:20] have to keep spending more money to unlock the game. And at these price points, you should get

[43:26] everything in the kitchen sink in your purchase, but Stern's going to be smart. They're going to

[43:32] charge you extra, you know, and they're going to start doing more and more stuff like this. You

[43:35] want the topper, well, you have to spend like five bucks to unlock the topper mode, like they're

[43:39] going to do it because with this much of an audience, think about it, with this much of an

[43:43] audience, there's millions of dollars they can make in additional revenue if they just do small

[43:49] microtransactions across the community. Stern deserves to do this stuff because they saved

[43:55] pinball. Without Stern pinball, this hobby would be pretty boring. The whole community would collapse

[44:01] if Stern went away. Without Stern, you know, there's not much going on. And I think when I look at the

[44:06] year in review, it really is like Stern's doing like 75% of the work and everyone else is just

[44:13] hanging on, right? Everyone else has like one game and only one game, but Stern pinball keeps

[44:19] going. We're probably going to get rushed like this week or next, and then they're going to keep going

[44:24] on to Venom. You know, everyone else, it's like, who knows, right? It's just a guess of when these

[44:29] companies are actually going to get two games out a year. Most of them can't figure that out. I mean,

[44:33] when David Fix came back and said, we're going to make two games a year, he said that at the beginning

[44:38] of 2021, they didn't get two games out a year. And as much as everyone's blaming COVID, Stern still

[44:45] got all of its titles out the door. They still did it. Jersey Jack never got a second game on the

[44:51] line. And so you got to give these guys credit. And I think we have like their sales success,

[44:56] 17,000 games are backlogged. That's incredible. All right. So what kind of year was it? Right?

[45:03] I think 2021, in summary, what kind of year do I think we had in 2021? I think it was a little

[45:08] bit of a mixed bag year. I think we saw prices go through the roof. And I think that's deflated a

[45:14] lot of people in pinball. I think this hobby we used to love used to be much more approachable

[45:20] for so many more people. And I think the hobby has become a little bit ridiculous. I do.

[45:26] When I see some of these prices and I see how fast things are selling for double the price they did

[45:32] just a year or two ago, I kind of laugh at it because I don't think any pinball machine is

[45:37] worth more than $10,000, let alone 20, let alone 30, let alone 40. But if you have the means and

[45:45] you're impatient and you just want to have what you want to have when you want to have it and

[45:50] you're a multimillionaire, I mean, I got a great hobby for you. It's called pinball. And I think

[45:56] there's just a lot of money has moved into this hobby. A lot of us have gotten our friends into

[46:01] pinball. And now that they're in it, they want stuff and they want stuff now and they're excited.

[46:07] The most exciting time is when you first get into a new hobby and that is who is buying these games.

[46:13] Don't be mistaken. We all knew that stranger things, Ellie wasn't the best pin ever. Who do you

[46:19] think is buying stranger things, Ellie at 15,000? A new person in the hobby who has money. Same with

[46:25] Ghostbusters. So there's just so much new money in the hobby. And what's going to happen now is for

[46:31] those of us out there who have been in this hobby for a while, like we're legacyed into it in a lot

[46:35] of ways. We have the relationships with the distributors and whatnot. And I think you're

[46:40] going to see a lot more of scalping and flipping machines as people take advantage of all this

[46:46] new money. They don't have the relationships, but they've got the cash. And I think this hobby is

[46:51] going to keep going up in price in 2022. I think supply shortages are still going to be an issue.

[46:56] And I think if you have a game in a box that people want, you might as well ask a lot for it,

[47:01] because there's not a lot of games that are going to be on the line in 2022. I think 2022 is going

[47:07] to be a lot like 2021 in the sense that prices are not going to dip. It is an exciting year we're

[47:12] headed into. I'm really looking forward to a new Jersey Jack machine. That's always a moment. It's

[47:17] always a special moment when Jersey Jack launches a new game, but we know it's coming from Stern.

[47:22] We know it's James Bond. We know it's Venom. We know it's Rush. And we know it's probably not

[47:27] back to the future from Keith Elwin. Will anyone else surprise us? I think that's going to be the

[47:31] big question of 2022. Will anybody else surprise us with something we didn't see coming? I'm not

[47:38] sure. I'm really not sure. Everybody out there, I want to say thank you so much for your support.

[47:42] It's been a really weird few days for me. I've had an amazing time with my family during the

[47:47] holidays. Even though people try to say a ton of nasty stuff about me, I really don't care or pay

[47:52] attention to any of it. I just want to do this show and do a show like this and keep making

[47:56] Canadian Spinball Podcasts for all of you. Thank you so much. The numbers are going in the right

[48:01] direction. 317 people. It's just going to keep growing as people realize this is the only place

[48:06] to enjoy the most entertaining Spinball Podcast on the planet. Well, I think it is. Who knows?

[48:11] It's no longer about awards or numbers for me now. It's just about making show for my fans.

[48:15] And that's what I want to do. And I know you enjoy listening. If you're having any issues with the

[48:20] show, let me know at canadepinball.com. Thank you so much for the support. It means so much to

[48:26] my family. And I've had so many nice conversations with a lot of you out there. And I'm hoping each

[48:31] and every one of you has a very happy and healthy 2022. And I'll be back with more episodes of

[48:38] Canada Spinball Podcasts. Have a good day.

[49:08] Thank you.
