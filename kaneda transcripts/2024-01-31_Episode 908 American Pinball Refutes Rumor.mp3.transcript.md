[00:00] Jerry, just remember, it's not a lie if you believe it.

[00:30] You are going in on these games, we are absolutely getting hosed and I think the more we talk

[00:35] about this, the more we share the realities, right, if you bought every Stern LE, you lost

[00:42] $11,000, two Jersey Jack games, you lost $9,600, you know, you're not going to hear anybody

[00:51] refute this information and I think it's a wake up call for the entire industry, but

[00:57] we just got the best news today, right, in a world in which everybody is losing thousands

[01:01] of dollars on every single limited edition game.

[01:06] All of us were taken out of our somber pinball mood because we found the greatest news today,

[01:13] that American Pinball is not for sale.

[01:17] David Fix has squashed the rumors floating around American Pinball that Aime Tron was

[01:23] done with this company, that they were looking to sell the pinball division, that American

[01:29] Pinball's days are numbered and now we know, their days are not numbered, they're going

[01:36] to do a Twitch stream tomorrow night and show us a four year old game.

[01:42] Let me repeat that, they're not going to try to sell you more Galactic Tank Forces or

[01:47] Legends of Valhalla, no we got to go back even further people, they're going to show us

[01:52] Hot Wheels, Hot Wheels Gameplay and so I just want to talk about this on this episode of

[01:57] Canada's Pinball Podcast because to me this is just getting into a comical zone right

[02:02] now and I don't know about you, but raise of hands amongst all of you out there, over

[02:08] 700 of you, how many of you actually believe anything American Pinball says?

[02:15] How many of you actually think that this new statement of theirs, that they were not looking

[02:21] to sell the company?

[02:22] Let's read the statement from American Pinball, shall we?

[02:25] American Pinball addresses false rumors and announces upcoming live stream.

[02:31] Now they spelled the word addresses wrong, there are two D's in addresses and if you're

[02:37] going to do a press release American Pinball, a word of advice, don't use the color red

[02:43] as your headline in your press release.

[02:46] The color red signifies an emergency so that might not be the color to use.

[02:52] They go on to say the following, in response to some recent speculation American Pinball

[02:58] Incorporated would like to clarify to our valued customers, partners and the pinball

[03:04] community that the rumors regarding the company being sold or in talks of being sold are baseless

[03:11] and untrue.

[03:13] American Pinball continues to be owned and operated by our parent company AIMtron and

[03:17] is more dedicated than ever to delivering high quality pinball experiences.

[03:23] We have some very exciting announcements that we will be making on our upcoming Twitch live

[03:28] stream on Wednesday, January 31st at 8 o'clock PM.

[03:33] You know what they don't say in this announcement, if it's 8 o'clock Eastern, 8 o'clock Central,

[03:38] 8 o'clock West Coast time, but we do know that it is Central time because they are

[03:43] in Central time.

[03:44] They go on to say we want to grant our fans, customers as well as the members of press

[03:50] an opportunity to take part in this exclusive reveal and an insight on what the future holds

[03:56] for American Pinball.

[03:58] Well first and foremost, if you're inviting everybody to your Twitch channel which anybody

[04:03] can watch with a computer or a cell phone, guess what?

[04:07] It's not an exclusive event.

[04:09] It's only an exclusive event if you exclude people from it and only a certain number of

[04:16] people are exclusively invited to your event.

[04:19] And you know look, I know I pick on these guys because everything they do from a marketing

[04:23] standpoint is an absolute joke.

[04:27] Now here's the thing, let's tackle this right?

[04:29] And then they put out another announcement on Facebook, big news from American Pinball.

[04:34] We are gearing up for an epic night on Twitch with our Hot Wheels livestream on Wednesday

[04:40] at 8 PM Central time.

[04:43] Along with exciting gameplay, we also have incredible news to share with all of you.

[04:49] Trust us, you don't want to miss this.

[04:52] Set your reminders now and join the fun.

[04:55] Go to our Twitch channel, twitch.tv backslash American Pinball Inc. to see if we can defeat

[05:01] Draven and stop his plans to take over Hot Wheels City.

[05:06] Alright, so I don't even know where to begin here.

[05:08] So let's just get this straight.

[05:10] A week ago, there was a Pinball podcast, I believe it was the Pinball Party podcast.

[05:15] Naps Arcade broke this story.

[05:17] And on that Pinball Party podcast, Cal Hernandez got a text message in which someone told him

[05:24] that AIMtron was looking to sell American Pinball.

[05:27] And so Jason Knapp picked up this story and that's where this rumor started to gain some

[05:32] traction.

[05:33] Now I've been saying for a while now that American Pinball is in trouble and they need

[05:38] to sell these galactic tank force machines.

[05:41] And if they don't get them sold, they're not going to move on to their next game.

[05:45] And so that's what I've been told from people on the inner circles, you know, sort of circling

[05:49] around American Pinball.

[05:51] And so here's the thing that's a little fishy, ladies and gentlemen.

[05:54] That rumor came out a week ago, a week ago, right?

[05:59] And everyone's been talking about it.

[06:00] I talked about it.

[06:01] Naps Arcade talked about it.

[06:03] Carrie Hardy's talked about it.

[06:05] Everybody's talked about it, right?

[06:06] Every single Pinball media person.

[06:08] Why did American Pinball wait an entire week to shut down such a rumor if it was untrue

[06:16] and there was no basis to that rumor?

[06:18] Don't you think you would have responded immediately?

[06:22] You don't think David Fix got notified instantly the moment that Pinball Party podcast went

[06:28] live or instantly the moment Canada's Pinball podcast is talking about it or Carrie Hardy

[06:33] or the pinball show or everybody else in the pinball space in the pinball community.

[06:38] There was a pin side thread.

[06:40] So you've got all these people speculating that your company is in dire straits, that

[06:45] you're looking to sell the pinball division and all you had to do is go somewhere, go

[06:49] live on Facebook and say there's no basis to this rumor.

[06:54] Why did it take them a full week?

[06:55] Why would it take them a full week to do this?

[06:58] Okay, so that's one side of this.

[07:00] That's comical, right?

[07:01] Why wait so long if you have the truth, just announce it right away and shut down the rumor

[07:06] immediately.

[07:07] They didn't do that.

[07:08] And now what are we going to get, right?

[07:10] What are we going to get?

[07:11] They set up a Twitch channel.

[07:12] And instead of streaming the game that they need to sell, they're going to stream for

[07:17] us Hot Wheels, a game that came out over three and a half years ago.

[07:21] Why are they streaming Hot Wheels?

[07:23] Well, here's what I've been told because they simply renewed the Hot Wheels license.

[07:28] Now here's the question.

[07:29] If they renewed the license, are we going to see an updated version of Hot Wheels?

[07:34] Because remember like three or four years ago, David Fix went on a podcast and he said

[07:39] to everybody, we might add stuff to the Hot Wheels game.

[07:43] We might add a loop to loop.

[07:45] We might add a car wash.

[07:46] We might add a jump.

[07:47] So are we going to see a new 2.0 version of Hot Wheels now that we know that American

[07:54] Pinball has renewed the license to Hot Wheels?

[07:57] If they come out tomorrow night and they just announced that they renewed the license and

[08:02] you can get a brand new Hot Wheels today for like $6,500, who cares?

[08:08] Who cares about looking in the past at this game?

[08:11] And for those of you who say this is American Pinball's greatest game, it's not.

[08:16] And it's not good enough.

[08:17] And the game is completely empty.

[08:19] And I can go to a toy store and buy a $30 Hot Wheels set for Killian that has a lot

[08:25] more toys in it, has more loop-de-loops, has more jumps, has more magic in it than the

[08:31] Hot Wheels pinball machine.

[08:33] It is one of the most lazy interpretations of a theme I've ever seen in the history of

[08:38] pinball.

[08:38] I mean, it's right there.

[08:40] Every single Hot Wheels set that every kid has ever played with has a loop-de-loop, has

[08:46] a jump, has a car wash, has a unique way to store the cars.

[08:51] There's nothing in this game except for a car on like a chopstick that spins around.

[08:57] And that's it.

[08:58] And for them to stream a game, that is almost four years old.

[09:02] I've never seen another company do this, like go so far back into the well.

[09:07] And this isn't like a game like Tron, right?

[09:10] Or Lord of the Rings, or a game where people have been clamoring for more Hot Wheels to

[09:15] be made.

[09:16] This just makes no sense.

[09:19] And this is the thing with American Pinball.

[09:21] You know, you add up all of these decisions that they make.

[09:23] The decision to make Galactic Tank Force in the first place.

[09:27] The decision to make Legends of the Hala, which even though it sold okay, there really wasn't

[09:32] much demand for that game when Riot Pinball asked people if they wanted the game.

[09:37] The decision to make Oktoberfest.

[09:40] You know, all of these American Pinball decisions year after year after year.

[09:44] I gotta ask, everybody out there, have they ever made a great decision ever?

[09:50] Has anything they've ever done pay off?

[09:52] And then you start to zoom out a little bit and you ask yourself, well, where did this

[09:55] rumor even come from?

[09:57] Why would we even speculate that American Pinball is in dire straits?

[10:02] Why would the rumor that they're looking to sell the Pinball division even come to fruition?

[10:07] Would this rumor even happen if American Pinball was successful?

[10:11] And let's just be honest, ladies and gentlemen, there are some pinball companies making pinball

[10:16] machines right now if they did not have ancillary revenue coming in from another company.

[10:22] If Ametron was not backing this company, if this company had to survive on their pinball

[10:29] decision making, they would be out of business many times over.

[10:34] Many times over.

[10:35] You know this.

[10:36] You know this.

[10:37] Galactic Tank Force would have sent this company into bankruptcy.

[10:42] Okay, so here's what I hear we're gonna hear tomorrow.

[10:44] Here's what I hear is going on at American Pinball.

[10:46] I hear that there's a skeleton crew over there.

[10:50] If they want to prove me wrong, that it's not a skeleton crew over there.

[10:54] If David Fixx wants to tell us that all is fine in American Pinball land, then instead

[11:00] of doing a Twitch stream tomorrow night, I would love to see him during the day just

[11:05] open up the door to American Pinball, walk around the joint on a random Wednesday, win

[11:11] the Canada's Pinball Podcast Pizza Challenge, and just show us how many people are there,

[11:17] how many games are on the line, what does it look like tomorrow at American Pinball.

[11:22] That would be the greatest way to silence all of the critics that things are not going

[11:27] so well over at American Pinball right now.

[11:30] I don't know if they're gonna do that.

[11:31] I hope they do.

[11:32] I don't know why it's a mystery what goes on inside these companies.

[11:35] If you're a manufacturing company, why would you shy away from showing people you're manufacturing?

[11:42] It shouldn't be a secret.

[11:43] So I'm hearing that there is a skeleton crew over there.

[11:46] I'm getting new word now on what the next game is.

[11:50] I am hearing that it is a Berio game and it is a game based on, are you sitting down

[11:56] on BBQ?

[11:57] Yes, BBQ.

[11:59] They are making a BBQ themed game that is a Berio design.

[12:04] Again, it's bad comedy.

[12:05] It's like first they make a tank game that has tanked the company and now they're gonna

[12:10] make a BBQ game that you could stick a fork in it because that's also not gonna sell.

[12:16] Hey, do you wanna get Jaws, Honey or Berio's BBQ game?

[12:21] Should we go get James Bond?

[12:22] No, I'm really feeling this BBQ game.

[12:25] It's like what the heck are they thinking over there?

[12:28] And so I think we've got Berio's BBQ game.

[12:31] And then the other rumor I'm hearing from my sources is that yes, while they have Dennis

[12:35] Nordman's Yeti 2 or Whitewater 2 game, the bomb is way too high on it and they're not

[12:42] gonna make it unless Dennis Nordman yanks a lot of stuff out of the game.

[12:47] And yes, Ryan McQuade is still working on Cuphead.

[12:50] And when they go on the stream tomorrow night, people, everybody just asks, are you making

[12:54] Cuphead Ryan?

[12:55] Are those rumors true?

[12:57] Any validity to those rumors that Canada is saying you are making Cuphead Pinball?

[13:02] And let's see how they respond.

[13:03] But I can tell you this right now.

[13:05] What people don't wanna see tomorrow is another stream of Hot Wheels.

[13:09] What people don't wanna see from American Pinball to prove that the future is looking

[13:13] bright is for this company to look backwards and remake a theme that came out three and

[13:18] a half years ago.

[13:19] But I think all of this just reeks of a company that is basically in a tailspin.

[13:25] And you can see it.

[13:26] None of the decisions they are making make any sense whatsoever.

[13:30] And look, think about it, people.

[13:32] Galactic Tank Force has been out for a year.

[13:35] Nobody's really bought it.

[13:36] They've probably only sold a few hundred of them at most 300 of those machines, right?

[13:42] And the big mistake they made with Galactic Tank Force, they fumbled all of it.

[13:47] There's too many tank versions and then that stupid $17,000 version made nobody really

[13:53] feel like the $11,000 version was special.

[13:57] They really nuked their own ability to sell that game.

[14:00] And what they should have done is just made like 200 tank versions.

[14:05] That's it.

[14:06] Probably would have sold everyone, only have one version of the tank version, and then

[14:11] just sell all those like standard or deluxe editions of the game.

[14:15] Like don't get cute, don't get fancy.

[14:18] And what did they do?

[14:19] They got cute and they got fancy.

[14:21] You know, it's like, do you really want to see David Fix in a tuxedo and try to become

[14:26] fancy?

[14:27] No, just get the job done, American Pinball.

[14:29] And they didn't do it.

[14:30] And so now that game was dead on arrival.

[14:33] And they've been trying for an entire year to breathe new life into that game.

[14:38] And so here we are.

[14:40] It's January 31st, 2024.

[14:43] And so the only way forward for American Pinball is to announce a new game that people want.

[14:51] And I'm telling you right now, when they announced this Barrio game, it is going to be laughed

[14:57] at.

[14:58] People are going to make fun of it and it is not going to work.

[15:01] I don't even have to see it.

[15:02] I don't even have to see it.

[15:03] I just know the biggest mistake David Fix is making is he thinks people care about these

[15:10] pedigree designers.

[15:12] He thinks people care and are going to spend their hard earned money to buy a Barrio tribute

[15:18] game.

[15:19] It's never going to happen.

[15:21] Dennis Norman couldn't sell you games.

[15:24] Barrio is not going to sell you games.

[15:27] It's not going to work.

[15:29] And there's too much competition.

[15:31] There's too many other companies executing on a much better level.

[15:36] Jersey Jacks, Elton John is executed much better than Tank Force.

[15:40] All of the stern machines are executed much better.

[15:43] Chicago Gaming Company makes a better machine.

[15:46] And if they ever make the damn Pulp Fictions, that's going to take away sales from this

[15:49] Barrio game.

[15:51] And by the way, people, we are so susceptible to companies misleading us.

[15:56] You know, I went back and I looked at the Pulp Fiction video in which we're all giving

[16:01] CGC credit.

[16:02] We're like Pulp Fictions on the line.

[16:04] And then I went back and I looked at the video.

[16:06] I'm like, where?

[16:07] Like, it's just a bunch of cabinets.

[16:09] And of course there's a bunch of cabinets stacked a mile high because CGC is a wood making

[16:14] company and they make their own cabinets.

[16:17] Where are the games?

[16:18] Where are the games on the line?

[16:20] Where are the games going out the door?

[16:22] They didn't show us any assembly line.

[16:24] And all of a sudden we're all giving them credit and we're saying production's begun.

[16:28] It's so easy for these companies to manipulate the pinball public because we want to believe

[16:34] them.

[16:35] You know, we really do want to believe them.

[16:37] Like I want to believe Stern Pinball when they say they're not going to make an anniversary

[16:41] edition nicer than an LE.

[16:43] I want to believe George Gomez is going to be honest when he says that.

[16:48] So I think tomorrow night's going to be funny, ladies and gentlemen.

[16:50] I don't know about you, but I think all of us tomorrow night.

[16:54] To grab a whiskey, head to American Pinball's Twitch channel and let's see what they're

[16:59] going to tell us.

[17:00] What's the big news going to be?

[17:02] Is Canada going to be right?

[17:04] Is it going to be Barrios' BBQ game?

[17:07] They're probably going to announce that they're going to bring it to Texas Pinball Festival.

[17:11] Right?

[17:12] It's March.

[17:13] A year on the anniversary of Galactic Tank Force's release, we're going to get that game.

[17:17] And that's it.

[17:18] I think they're going to announce that and I think they're going to announce how they

[17:21] renewed the Hot Wheels license and maybe they added a loop-de-looper, something to that

[17:26] game to make it more exciting.

[17:28] And that's what I think we're going to hear.

[17:30] And again, I don't think this company is executing as well as Spooky Pinball, as Jersey Jack,

[17:37] as Stern.

[17:38] There's just so many more options as Barrels of Fun.

[17:42] And now we're going to get Princess Bride from Multimorphic.

[17:46] Somebody out there is making a little shop of horrors.

[17:48] I mean, there's so much going on in Pinball.

[17:51] And I'm just going to say this.

[17:53] Eventually, we need some of these Pinball companies that are making terrible decisions.

[17:59] We need them to fail.

[18:01] Because if these companies never fail and they never have any consequences for terrible

[18:06] decision-making, so then what are we going to get?

[18:09] Just a series of mediocre games funded by AIMetron.

[18:13] And imagine if you had AIMetron's money and Mukesh's money, but someone over there who

[18:19] was actually making good decisions, someone over there with a creative vision.

[18:24] Why do we want this mediocrity?

[18:26] There's no room for it.

[18:27] And it's just sad to me because I've never seen an industry quite like Pinball, where

[18:32] companies can fail year after year after year.

[18:36] And these people with these deep pockets just keep investing in the Pinball operations,

[18:40] even if they're not making much money and even if the games they make are flops.

[18:45] I don't understand.

[18:46] It's like they're failing up in Pinball.

[18:48] They're still around.

[18:49] Like American Pinball at this stage in the company's existence should be making hit

[18:54] games.

[18:55] I shouldn't even have to do this podcast.

[18:57] There shouldn't even be a rumor about whether or not they have to sell the Pinball division.

[19:01] They should be making hit games and they're not.

[19:04] And so tomorrow night, we'll see what they say, everybody.

[19:07] And I just want to end this podcast by reiterating what my last show told all of us.

[19:13] We've all got to be patient.

[19:14] Like as Pinball buyers, like the writing is on the wall, all of these games are overpriced.

[19:20] All of them.

[19:21] Every game out there right now is probably a good $2,000 more than it should be.

[19:27] And we're all eating it.

[19:28] Like everybody's eating it.

[19:30] And eventually people are going to get tired of eating all of these losses.

[19:34] It's so eye-opening.

[19:35] Like if you just bought all those games over the last year and a half, you lost $31,000

[19:41] in value.

[19:42] One James Bond.

[19:43] I mean, there are people out there who bought James Bond's 60th with tax.

[19:48] It was like $22,000.

[19:51] And their game is now worth $12,000, a $10,000 loss in one year.

[19:57] And again, everybody, the reason why I want to highlight this stuff is if we band together

[20:04] and distributors start giving feedback to these manufacturers, guess what's going to

[20:09] happen?

[20:10] The prices are going to go down.

[20:12] They're absolutely going to go down.

[20:14] These distributors are going to be allowed to sell the games for less than MSRP just

[20:19] a few months after the games come out.

[20:21] We're not going to have to wait years.

[20:23] I'm talking like six months down the road.

[20:25] Elton John Platnams will be selling from distributors for $10,000.

[20:32] They just will.

[20:34] It's the only way to move the inventory.

[20:36] I don't understand why we would wake up as a community, take these humongous losses.

[20:42] Remember, the distributors are not losing money.

[20:45] The distributors are not losing money.

[20:46] They're making a lot of money on every game they sell.

[20:49] The manufacturers are cleaning house because they bullied all of the distributors into

[20:54] having to buy these bulk purchases.

[20:57] I don't know who to even feel bad for.

[20:59] I feel bad for the buyer.

[21:00] At the end of the day, I do feel bad for the buyer.

[21:03] Here's the thing.

[21:04] Nobody's making us buy.

[21:06] That is why buy, buy, buy is just a failing way to approach this hobby now.

[21:11] It really is.

[21:12] Just wait and see why buy now.

[21:15] If you just wait it out, just a little bit, people, you don't even have to wait years.

[21:19] You wait a few months and you're going to get every game you want for a lot less money.

[21:24] Now we're going to see it, people.

[21:25] They're going to be new in box.

[21:27] It's going to be new in box Jaws Elise selling for less than $13,000 in just a few months.

[21:34] You all know it's true.

[21:35] Everybody have a great night.

[21:37] Let's take it away with the Seinfeld music.
