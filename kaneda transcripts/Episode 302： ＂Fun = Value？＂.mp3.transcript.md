[00:00] So you get your stomach bite is gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye

[00:05] Until that baby, oh you gonna let it hold you dead and make it right

[00:16] Good morning everybody welcome to episode 302 of Canadian Spinball podcast

[00:21] I'm your host canada it was supposed to snow and be a blizzard in New York City

[00:26] And there's not in ounce of snow on the ground and I know I owe you an interview with Quinn from deep root pinball

[00:34] And that is coming this week early on I am transcribing it not really transcribing it

[00:40] I'm just too lazy right now to upload it into my system and get it up on the air

[00:44] But it's coming real soon. But the reason why I've cut in front of that podcast is I woke up and I just had something

[00:52] That was on my mind that I wanted to share with you and I think that's what makes this podcast special is

[00:57] Is I don't really have an agenda?

[00:59] I don't really have a schedule of things to come I sort of go with the flow I sort of

[01:06] Attached to the culture of the hobby I think in real time and give you guys what I think a lot of people are thinking about

[01:13] So in this episode we're gonna cover a few bit of news items

[01:16] But then I want to get to the heart of what I want to talk about

[01:19] And that is a very simple concept is does fun equal value in pinball

[01:28] And what do we mean by that because we hear that all the time that a game has to be fun and that's what's most important

[01:34] But does that mean that a game should be worth 100?

[01:38] 100?

[01:39] 10,000?

[01:41] 25,000?

[01:43] At what point does the conversation shift from being about fun to being about value?

[01:50] And I think it's something that all pinball people I believe this hobby struggles with that and I think they struggle significantly with that

[01:58] But before we talk about that and when we do talk about that I actually have a statement from Zach Sharp at Stern Marketing about that topic

[02:06] Because I asked him to come on the show a couple months ago he declined to come on but he did give me a statement about his belief on the subject

[02:15] So I think you're gonna find what he says pretty interesting

[02:18] Before we do that a few news items and then we'll get right into it all right

[02:23] So number one on my news item list is that Chicago Gaming Company has come out and they have explained why there is a delay in getting people their monster bash remake at least

[02:34] And I want to read what they wrote they said I want to make a quick update on monster bash production first off I apologize for the delays in the early production

[02:45] As many of you know we manufacture all of our playfields in house each monster bash playfield is carefully hand silkscreen with 10 spot colors

[02:57] This is how the original playfields were manufactured the spot colors create a color spectrum far richer and wider than what we can produce using for color process

[03:10] Each playfield we produce is a unique handcrafted piece of art with its own unique characteristics

[03:18] I believe we are the we are the only pinball machine manufacturer still utilizing spot colors on our playfields

[03:26] Some have moved away from screen printing altogether and now digitally print their playfields in for color process

[03:35] Digitally printing is certainly more consistent and far less expensive but it comes with certain compromises

[03:43] We are trying to keep the bar as high as possible and not compromise quality I believe with few exceptions the playfields we have shipped in every monster bash have been beautiful

[03:56] We do not hold sorry we do hold even higher standards for playfields going into L.E.s

[04:02] To date art production has yielded less L.E. worthy playfields than we hoped as a result we have produced some scs and CEs more scs and CEs than originally scheduled and less L.E.s

[04:17] We have made several changes in the screen printing process and we are finally seeing much improved results

[04:23] These results are starting to allow us to move forward quickly through the production of L.E.s

[04:29] The number of people participating in our serial number matching program far exceeded expectations there were 246

[04:37] We are anticipating completing all domestic serial number matching program L.E.s by February 1 after that we will focus on the balance of domestic and international L.E.s

[04:48] I want to thank everyone for their support and allowing us to do work that we love.

[04:53] So what do I think about that statement?

[04:56] Really interesting update because there is a level of transparency and honesty there that I think is interesting and that is the word I will use because they were really honest and what they said

[05:11] There is no way of taking it back now is that they will put better playfields in the L.E.s versus the CEs and the scs and that has made people upset that you all are not getting the same quality playfield

[05:28] You know how like CPR does the gold, the silver and the bronze I believe in terms of quality if there was a little mistake that is a cheaper playfield but they are still all really nice

[05:40] So what do you think about that for a minute?

[05:43] Now you all out there you crave transparency for manufacturers right you want to know the truth well they just told you the truth

[05:51] that people who spend more money are going to get the better playfields and they are going to take extra care of the L.E. owners and make sure that their playfields are more flawless than the other two versions of the game

[06:06] Do you think Stern would ever come out and say that the L.E. playfield buyers that they are going to make sure that those people get the nicer playfields

[06:14] never they would never even have you believe that there is any difference between let's say a Deadpool, Ellie and a Deadpool premium playfield

[06:24] This opens the door for the people who are buying the other versions to not feel as good about what they are getting

[06:32] It doesn't do any benefit other than make the L.E. people feel like they are getting something that is improved and better and more special

[06:41] Now I want to talk about this from the other angle because shouldn't you get a better product when you spend more money

[06:52] I remember for the longest time people use to speculate on a certain game and they use to speculate if it had an extra code of clear

[07:01] Remember back in the day when Stern started doing limited editions there was always like these mythological rumors about the playfield having extra clear on it

[07:11] And that's why it was nicer and that was one of the differences with the L.E.'s Stern never confirmed has never and will never ever put down in writing that a game got an extra code of clear

[07:23] Because it was a limited edition now in other industries and other hobbies and other collectibles

[07:29] There are times when if you pay more you get something like that like there might be a I always use cargaments but in summer, say these are porches

[07:39] Sure there are paint options in which you can you can order nicer paint for a higher price but that doesn't really relate to Pimball

[07:46] I think Pimball is different if you're going to make a playfield nicer on the L.E. you have to come out and say that but what's weird is everyone expects every playfield to be perfect

[08:01] Whether you buy a pro or a premium a $5,000 machine a $2,000 machine playfield perfection is just always expected out of the box

[08:11] Nobody wants a playfield with any blemishes or any hazing or any chipping or anything right it's you're just not going to get away

[08:18] With selling something brand new to someone and it's not perfect out of the box

[08:23] And so I think Chicago gaming company really mess this up in that statement is not good

[08:30] They should have thought about what they were saying they should have thought about the anticipated feedback to that

[08:36] And now I think they're going to have C E and S E buyers being like whoa, what did I get?

[08:41] And didn't some L.E.s already go out the door and were those L.E.s flawless or were they just they didn't catch the problem until later on?

[08:50] I don't know but you see what happens when you don't really take the art of communication too seriously you just say whatever happened without thinking it through

[09:00] You can get yourself in trouble and that's why part of my industry exists it's not what I do I don't do the issues and crises

[09:08] I don't think companies should tell you everything I really don't I think they should just give everyone a satisfactory product out of box

[09:17] But I don't want to know that the S E's and the C E's are not going to get playfield as nice as the L.E.'s and I think you all agree all right

[09:25] All right, let's going on to the next topic here. So let's talk about this because the tide is turning on the monsters and if you read Pinside

[09:36] I've always said it you give people two weeks and they'll come back with some reason that they don't like the game that they all of a sudden loved

[09:43] Right and that's that's the that's a concept that I watch play out time and time again

[09:48] Given enough time everyone will talk themselves out of being excited for a game it's why you need to get your game to people quickly because if you give them enough time

[09:58] AK Pires of the Caribbean and entire year to think about it people will find reasons to fall out of love with the machines

[10:09] It's never the other way around right there's never been a game that was revealed like a year ago and a year passes by

[10:16] And over that time people found new ways to fall in love with that machine has happened never all right

[10:23] Now look it's not like Batman 66 where yeah two years later people love the machine because the code was updated that's different

[10:30] You know I think that these games now are are really designed to create a short hype window to get people to jump in without ever playing it

[10:40] And by the time people wake up no one's really sure what they bought but anyway here's what people are complaining about with the monsters

[10:47] They're looking at the game and they are saying wait a minute that really big Dracula target and the lily targets on the left and right of the game

[10:55] There is like one big target that the Dracula one looks like it's like six inches long a lily ones like four inches

[11:03] Instead of spelling each letter by hitting individual targets one hit anywhere on that big target spells a letter

[11:12] And people are looking at that and saying well that's really cheap that's not fun to hit and that's another example of how Stern is cost cutting in these games

[11:22] And I think the bigger concern for people is how easy it is

[11:26] And I think people who play pinball they want there to be a little bit of a level of difficulty

[11:31] You know but like I'm looking at my Batman right now and they got the gadgets lined up and they're not drop targets but they are individual targets

[11:39] And I will say they spell gadget and you have to hit the corresponding target with the letter

[11:45] It's just more rewarding to see the word being spelled on the play field because you're hitting the corresponding letter

[11:52] There's no denying that does it wreak of being cheap absolutely

[11:57] You would rather have drop targets there you get drop targets in Deadpool why don't you get them

[12:04] You get the drop targets in front of the Deadpool character but they don't get them on the side Stern really has taken drop targets out of most of their games

[12:14] How rewarding is the Beatles because of the drop targets like beetles is the most rewarding thing is are hitting those drops

[12:21] Imagine if you looked at the beetles and you replace those drop targets with just a mono block target that didn't go down and didn't move

[12:33] And you just had to spell fab 4 by hitting a single target in each area how boring that would be

[12:40] There's something that we physically love about seeing a target go up and down

[12:44] You know people love it in AC DC it's just so rewarding we got it in Avengers and so yeah it doesn't it doesn't add to the game

[12:53] Now the other thing people are complaining about is the code people are playing the monsters and saying after 10 minutes I feel like I saw all there is to see

[13:00] I got to a wizard mode on my first ball yada yada yada I don't know I don't know what to tell you when it comes to this stuff because

[13:07] The ultimate lesson is always the same you got to play the game to make sure you want to you want to have it

[13:16] And the thing that I think is is really you know again I've been in this hobby for enough time to just say this bluntly to all of you who listen to this show

[13:24] How do you know when you want to own a machine you you love the theme you love the artwork is that enough you don't know if the game is shallow

[13:33] You don't know if they're trying to make this monster's game really easy similar to monster bash right not very deep but very fun right it's very fun monster bash but it gets boring old quickly if you're a good player as people say there's a lot of debate about that

[13:49] You know so like the ultimate thing is you don't really know you want to spend 9000 or 7500 on the machine and you want to own it in your house unless you've played it a bunch of times and you you feel confident that it's going to have the replay value that you're looking for

[14:07] But they're all sold out stern sold I think now they're sold out of all 600 monsters L.E.s. They're selling premiums left and right they probably sold let me just I'm going to say in a whim stern is probably sold the eight like a thousand to 1500 months is already right a thousand to 1500 and I bet out of those 1500 buyers probably only 50 to 100 people have actually played the game so think about it.

[14:37] 1400 people are just going in on it not even knowing if they'll really like the game and that's where we are with the hobby that is where the new inbox craze comes from and I don't know what to tell you I love sitting on the sidelines I love watching all of this transpire because we all know a year from now a monster's L.E. will be worth $1,500 less

[15:06] and those people saying that I'm crazy the you're crazy because you know games next Superman 78 is next from stern that's what I'm hearing that's what distributors are telling people Superman 78 by I don't know either Steve Richie or Brian Eddie so what is that is that a title that you want more than the monsters I think more people were fans of the Christopher Reeves Superman movies then the monsters TV show

[15:35] which only had two seasons before Batman 66 put it out of business that's what happened people want to batman more I don't know I don't know what to tell you these games it's the hype is so strange but we're going to talk more about that when we talk about funny equals value but anyway that's what happened

[15:53] here's here's a good example of the hobby and I'm going to use someone who has another pinball podcast I'm going to use Marty for example from head to head pinball so Marty on a recent show said how much he loved playing Pirates of the Caribbean he played the game you know Jack makes a trip all the way over to Australia to hang out with the you know the Australian collectors in the community he brings pirates with them he spends all this money getting over there

[16:17] Marty plays Pirates of the Caribbean thinks it's great has a lot of fun playing it he orders a monster is that he's never played I mean just that that is the hobby and a nutshell and Marty's not alone a lot of you people out there do it you know you for some reason you maybe you just see enough maybe you think you've seen enough pinball videos and streams and maybe it's because he interviewed Dwight I don't know but for whatever reason you know that's indicative of where we are he bought a game he's never

[16:46] played and passed on a game that he played and loved I don't understand anymore how to really apply intelligent critical thinking to this hobby I really don't I think you listen to this podcast for pure entertainment because my mind my my collegiate you know I went to really good schools expensive schools my parents sent me to I can apply my critical thinking and common sense to this hobby anymore

[17:16] I just can't on any level right I can't and you know so speaking of Marty too I just have to bring this up for for for you guys out there for the twippy debate continues to rage on and I think we're done talking about monsters the twippy debate continues to rage on it over head to head they said something interesting they said what they're talking about the twippy's what they're meant to do is celebrate pinball but like everything in life that's not always what happens

[17:46] right and I'm just I just want to I just want to respond to that because Jeff Greg and Zach put on an amazing show last year and what about the twippy's was not celebrating pinball you know and I don't get it I think what he's referring to

[18:04] and I think for you guys who listen to the show and this is why bring it up is if you go back to last year when we won the twippy for best pinball podcast you know what happened

[18:14] a lot of the other pinball podcast out there refused when they did their recap of the twippy's they refused to say that canators pinball podcast won the twippy they actually skipped the category I think head to head did that to me I know a few others did Buffalo did slam tilt did it as well

[18:35] and so when they're saying stuff like you know it's meant to celebrate the best in pinball but that's always not what happens what they mean is that canators pinball

[18:45] podcast winning is not a celebration of what's best in pinball and what they're so what they're implying is that I'm a bad member of the pinball community that this show is not healthy that this show is not celebrating all that's great in pinball

[19:00] and I've always said if this show is just a negative Nancy show if we just came out here to poo poo on the pinball hobby and the industry nobody would listen right this show is not a negative tirade against pinball in fact I think my love for pinball is sincere and I think this show has always been about trying to get the best pinball product for you the customer not only that trying to get people to think

[19:30] differently about chasing after every new machine and spending so much money on machines without thinking about it twice right so then Marty came back on and he clarified what he meant and I want to read this right now he says we love the twippies don't get us wrong and have had a good chat with Jeff about it we would really like it if people voted for us and we and if we won we would be over the moon but when it has a competitive nature to it which it has become to an extent

[19:59] we are saying that we are not going to be competitive all right I want to stop Marty right there because again I mean look it be yeah it be really convening if this showed it and talk about any of the drama any that okay this is not drama Marty for you to say that statement I love your show guys I do and I still I here's here's the thing do you know where it got competitive you know who who fire the first shot that made it not fun

[20:27] when there was a thread on Pinside a couple months ago that said do you listen to pinball podcast and it was a great thread people are just talking about what they listen to a lot of people responded that they that they listen to canators pinball podcasts and you know what happened Ben had came on and said his favorite show was canators pinball podcast because we know we sort of call it like it is and we we were we're a little bit shooting from the hip but we don't hold punches right so what happened after he said that Ryan

[20:57] came on and posted this huge thread about how when Ben heck was on head to head it got twice as many listens as canators pinball podcast how how I'm negative this and that and I you know I focus on the draw and basically just threw me under the bus just because Ben heck said he liked my show more and so I just have a hard time for Marty to say it's not you know when it's not fun he doesn't want to you know he's they're not about that that's not how they roll that's but but I don't

[21:27] I again go back and listen to all of my shows and and point out where I threw any of the other podcast under the bus and yet these are the kinds of arrows that I've got stuck in my back over and over and over again but at least

[21:41] own up to it that's the thing at least own up to it it if you if you are competing and if you then just own up to it the one thing I can never understand to is

[21:51] you know behind the scenes and this is what Ryan did behind the scenes Marty and Ryan are saying they get like 4,000 people to listen to every show which is cool I mean I hope they get 4,000 people to listen every show that's twice as many people that comes up on usually more than twice as many that supposedly listen to canators pinball podcasts but then it started to make no sense that in that thread the podcast that people kept saying over and over and over again that they listen to is this one.

[22:20] So how do they have 4,000 people listening if this one's only got to but yet when people are chiming in so that's the thing it's like I don't know and that's why the twippies I think are cool because it's like a good time to see what people enjoy the most and I'm going to leave it at that but I just think that you know when you're honest and you tell people exactly what's really going on it's better it's better it like I would just love for them to come out and say we want to know what the best of the best of it.

[22:50] would love to beat Canada. And then you know when they list all the interviews they do

[22:54] that's great. I mean look they have a completely different format of show. It's a it's two to

[22:58] three hours show with an interview every time you know what you're gonna get on this show.

[23:03] You don't know what you're gonna get at any point. I might have someone great on. I might

[23:07] not. I might just talk to you. But again this is my show. Canada's pinball podcast and I love

[23:11] that you love it and I have no hard feelings against any other pinball podcast that are

[23:16] out there. All that I ask of all of them is just stop ignoring my existence. Like how silly

[23:23] is that? Like I'm here. It's like you I'm not like Moses where you can strict me from all the

[23:28] records of Egypt. I will set you free people. All right. Let's go on to something more positive.

[23:35] So fun equals value. A topic that we all struggle with on a daily weekly basis in pinball. I want

[23:42] to do one thing right now. I want to read you. I think this is a great example of exactly what I'm

[23:48] talking about. I want to read you the comments and I'm not going to tell you what the games are

[23:52] first. There are two games for sale in the pinball hobby right now. And I want to read you the comments

[23:58] and then I want to tell you what the game is they're talking about. All right. So this is game number

[24:06] one. $8,000 seems to be a good price for an Ellie especially with low plays and home use only.

[24:15] That comment right that $8,000 seems to be a good price for this Ellie got 17 down votes and zero

[24:23] up votes. All right. Another comment on this game $8,000. I'd be interested to see where this

[24:31] actually settles seems a bit high. All right. Then okay says the guy who owns one. This is way

[24:41] over price. The person who said this game is way over price for $8,000. Got a 17 up votes.

[24:48] All right. 17 no down votes. All right. Seems like seven case stock but market for more. All right.

[24:59] So the market has been soft as you get to 7,500 they tend to be modded out. Most of these seem to be

[25:04] home use only so that doesn't add more. So the owner who is price pumping nice try. Okay. So

[25:10] I just want to stop there. I want to stop there on a low play home use only Ellie version of a game

[25:17] by which there are only $400. $8,000 is a rip off. You're getting screwed. How dare you right? You

[25:26] know game that is it just happens to be what I think is probably Stern's best pinball machine of

[25:32] all time Lord of the Rings Ellie. So here we are. And the reason why I want to do it this way. Here

[25:39] we are Lord of the Rings Ellie was originally what? What $6,600 okay. I get it all Stern's were

[25:48] that price back then. But now fast forward fast forward like 10 11 years right it came out in 2008.

[25:56] Lord of the Rings is more packed is better has better code has better toys is a better experience is

[26:04] more fun than almost all need Stern pinball machines that I've played bar none. And yet when someone

[26:10] wants to sell one for a price that's still cheaper than a Deadpool Ellie. All right. Still cheaper

[26:19] than an Aerosmith Ellie. Still cheaper than a monster's Ellie. Still cheap I could just keep going

[26:25] on and on and on. It's basically you don't think a Lord of the Rings in nice condition Ellie

[26:32] is the same price as a Beatles gold you that's ludicrous. And so this is exactly what I'm talking about

[26:41] is what has gone on in this hobby. I mean Lord of the Rings is a classic. And let me tell you what

[26:47] happens in classic cars or classic watches that you know they become a classic because they're great

[26:54] and people who own them love them. And so if there's no more I don't see Lord of the Rings Ellie is

[27:00] coming up for sale very often. In fact if you go over to eBay there's one on eBay how much is

[27:04] it listed for 11,000 dollars. And I don't care if this owner bought it and is selling it quickly

[27:12] it doesn't matter how are we in a hobby right now where we look at a Lord of the Rings for $8,000

[27:20] and everybody loses their shit everybody's going nuts everybody's going crazy and yet people are

[27:27] paying $9,000 and they've never played the monsters before and everyone's applauding. I got one

[27:32] you really think the monsters is going to be better than the Lord of the Rings. Do you really

[27:37] think that's going to be the case? Do you forget that Lord of the Rings is so goddamn special. I mean

[27:43] I'm not I'm not even showing the game out of all the games I've owned. The one that I missed the most

[27:49] is the Lord of the Rings because it's just it's just the perfect theme integration perfect callouts

[27:55] they didn't rely on the LCD but the LCD animations are great when you put in a color DMD the brass

[28:00] looks incredible when you brass plate that game it's it's even more beautiful you could argue yeah

[28:07] maybe 8,000 is a lot because he didn't add in the figures or the toys or have any mods in it

[28:12] but I just can't believe it all right now let's go on to the other game let me read you the comments

[28:17] here here's a comment I wish it would go into full production but I've been told it's unlikely to

[28:26] ever happen game is super fun and a premature welcome to whoever scoops this up based on the last

[28:34] unsolicited offer I got I assume this goes quickly if the seller is willing to ship stateside

[28:43] quickly he says that comes from someone you know is Hilton keep keep that quote in mind all right

[28:49] all right this is my favorite one I think this sells fast most seem to have given up seeing this

[28:55] game go into productions all right I love the opportunity to own one of these someday I love a

[29:03] boutique small run of these super cool game all right you know game they're talking about

[29:11] that this should go quickly wrath of Olympus you know how much money 25,000 dollars 25,000

[29:20] dollars because they made only six of the wrath of Olympus is one of which Hilton has which is so

[29:27] convenient for him to say that based on an an offer I got this should go pretty fast all right

[29:33] so look let's talk about this let's talk about it wrath of Olympus again that's nowhere near as

[29:39] good as Lord the Rings gets listed at 25,000 dollars does it get 17 downvotes no it has one up vote no

[29:49] downvotes no there's actually there's no downvotes anywhere my favorite comment in this whole section

[29:56] was from crazy levy he wrote I'm interested in this but only if it's more expensive and if I don't

[30:03] actually receive the game we got to do this boutique stuff right I thought that was probably one

[30:09] of levy's greatest comments of all time and he's right this this is like ludicrous and take a step

[30:16] back of the history of this game all right did we do we all do we all have revisionist history

[30:21] this isn't some rare game that is amazing that people have wanted that that didn't go into

[30:26] production because the company closed down no this game didn't go into production for one reason

[30:32] people didn't want it they couldn't line up 100 buyers of this game you know why because it's not

[30:41] that great of a game it's not first of all look at the cabinet artwork on wrath of Olympus it's

[30:48] total shit it looks like shit a five thousand dollar stern pro has much nicer artwork

[30:56] than wrath of Olympus it's like crappy Photoshop art in this game like it's it's so bland the

[31:04] cabinet just just has the logo of the game on it nothing else on it garbage garbage again I'm not

[31:10] here to insult the game I mean the guys who made this game congratulations but I'm I'm here

[31:16] looking at your machine being where it's where it's being offered for twenty five thousand dollars

[31:22] and I think that's ridiculous and yeah it's great that hilton you have one there is if anyone buys

[31:30] wrath of Olympus for twenty five thousand dollars do I think you're a moron and the answer is yes

[31:37] was I moronic for buying a broken magic girl absolutely I was the biggest idiot on the planet

[31:43] I thought magic girl would have worked I can't imagine they would have spent an entire year

[31:48] and not be able to fix the game now now that being said that's a reason why you see where magic

[31:54] girl prices are these days magic girls still ten times sexier than wrath of Olympus but at least

[31:59] you can play wrath of Olympus but magic girl prices now they've there's been one listed for sale now

[32:05] for sixteen thousand dollars it's my I think it's my friend Robert's over there in New Jersey

[32:10] no offers still it's almost at the point now we're you know and even wants it because they know how

[32:17] frustrating it is to own one it's it's not it's not even in the same territory of like a predator

[32:24] or wrath of Olympus or an alien where at least the game is there like you can play it albeit you know

[32:31] you got to be anxious that you're gonna break something on these rare games so I think it's that's

[32:36] where we're at is now this games were twenty five thousand dollars how much was wrath of Olympus

[32:41] originally do you remember I think it was something like seven thousand seventy five hundred dollars

[32:47] that so he needed a hundred people to spend something like seven thousand dollars to get the

[32:53] game into production and he came up short and remember when he was asking for that money that was

[32:59] when we had Dutch pinball we had highway we had Zidware other people were getting deposit on games

[33:06] easily so why didn't he get deposits on this game he brought this game to shows the pinheads all

[33:12] got to play it and they decided it wasn't the game for them and now we're supposed to just forget

[33:17] all that wake up one day and be like it's a twenty five thousand dollar game and who's to say that

[33:22] this game doesn't get made again in the future this it's all been designed who's to say that they

[33:27] don't strike a deal with like an American pinball who we know is in desperate need of other games

[33:33] to get on the line and why not make wrath of Olympus and do new artwork in the games done

[33:38] and sell a few of them sell sell two hundred of them make them sell them for ten thousand each

[33:43] I don't know but this isn't how you do boutique right boutique done right is from the beginning

[33:50] you said a limited number you make a great game that people want and then your game becomes

[33:55] classic and becomes the celebrated and it becomes in demand this this whole notion of like take

[34:02] a game that had no demand around it and then say we're not making anymore and then all of a sudden

[34:07] it's worth this that's not how just this to me these are like kick cars these are these are just

[34:12] prototype homebrew projects that that's it's not the same it it just should not warrant this kind

[34:20] of money and anyway that that's where we are with the hobby and it brings me to the point of the

[34:24] show of does fun equal value and I want to read what Zach Sharp said and then I wanted to discuss

[34:31] so he wrote pinball has always been about fun and it's capital F u n he writes it is the most

[34:38] important factor in the success of any game and the only thing that will keep people engaged

[34:45] and hitting that start button over and over well let me tell you something Zach I want to I want

[34:51] to stop there and say I agree I agree if a game is boring if a game sucks if it's not fun you're

[34:58] not going to want to replay the game you're not going to want to own the game so I wholeheartedly

[35:02] agree there he then goes on to say so much of the lifeblood of a game has nothing to do with the cost

[35:11] of the components used to build that game theme integration via sounds speech lights rules etc almost

[35:21] work in tandem to hide in the experience of being able to live in that 3d world under glass

[35:29] every game I've ever enjoyed and wanted to add to my game room creates those emotional

[35:34] experiences for me as a player interacting with that world that's at the control of my finger tips

[35:43] I agree with everything he just said there but then he closes out this statement with something

[35:48] interesting he says whether a game cost 100 1000 10 thousand or 100 thousand is ultimately irrelevant

[36:03] how can you say that how can you say that the price of a pinball machine is irrelevant if it's fun

[36:13] and this to me is where we are with pinball this notion that costs should just be forgotten

[36:22] that all the hard work you do in your life to make enough money to buy these non-essential toys

[36:28] we should not even discuss whether or not you're getting your money's worth the only conversation

[36:34] we should be having is are you getting your fun worth and your fun worth to a pinball company like

[36:41] Stern or any of them out there that's the easy part you're making pinball pinball by nature is fun

[36:50] it is really hard it takes more hard work to make a pinball machine not fun like magic girl then

[36:58] fun like almost every single pinball machine I play is fun like I have fun flipping it's also fun

[37:07] too see I have fun too when I play game and I enjoy it but you know it it's also fun to say hey

[37:11] it's not for me I'm not loving this I don't need to buy it that's also fun because then then you

[37:17] come to the mental conclusion that you can save some of your hard-earned money but to say that

[37:23] the price of machine doesn't matter what do you guys think about that like that's coming from

[37:31] Stern that's the Stern mentality so we should just not want you know so it doesn't matter

[37:39] and you know and I agree that theme integration sound speech light rules all that does have to work

[37:44] together and that's the games that we love the games that become classics they do all those things

[37:50] so well right they almost do them there's like it's like an orchestra there's a synchronization of

[37:56] all the elements that are blending together in beautiful harmony that leads to a magical pinball

[38:03] experience right and that's always what all of you want when you when you buy a game some of you

[38:11] are so rich you can just buy games just to play them you know you buy a game like you're renting a

[38:15] movie from blockbuster you get it in your home you lose a few hundred bucks you pass it on and

[38:21] it's an endless cycle of of of how you want to enjoy your pinball machines and I'm saying there's

[38:26] nothing wrong with that there is nothing wrong with that but I just don't think this whole fun

[38:33] equals value equation is one that is accurate I think the way I look at it is this almost all pinball

[38:44] equals fun right magic equals buying right you should only buy a game that's magical right but

[38:54] that's not the case right we we buy them theme and artwork now they know that stern knows that

[38:59] you you we are theme and artwork suckers before we even know the game is magical right before

[39:04] Marty knows that monsters is is great game he bought it even though he played pyrr to the Caribbean

[39:09] but he's not alone a lot of people are doing that so we're in that new state now where it doesn't

[39:14] matter how magical the game is right and then then when it comes to like you know these rare games

[39:23] like what should be worth what I think when it comes to rarity it needs to be like a combination of

[39:31] things needs to have be a great game have a great story shoot amazingly well have incredible artwork

[39:39] do something that a pinball machine is never done before are these boutique games should be aiming

[39:43] for that and I think then then you should get something that really skyrockets in value like no

[39:51] one no one looks at a king Kong from daddy ease and and wonders why it's worth so much the story

[39:58] of king Kong was never meant to be fifty thousand dollar game same with the original king pins

[40:03] same with the big bang bar I mean I saw some guys trying to sell that big bang bar still for

[40:08] twenty five thousand dollars when we know the games going to be remade better it'll be remade better

[40:14] for for eight thousand dollars who the hell who the hell would throw away

[40:19] seventeen thousand dollars on that game that's in a box we're not that stupid and that's that's

[40:27] just the thing I just I think we're we're we're being marketed to we're being spoken to like we are

[40:35] dumb and the more we behave like children right just run into the candy store and grab everything

[40:41] even if even if we only have a dollar in our pocket we put ten dollars of candy in our bag

[40:46] we need to stop acting that way and I I think we are smart though but when I see that wrath of

[40:54] Olympus thread and there's no down votes and everyone is just celebrating the fact that this guy's

[41:00] asking twenty five thousand dollars for a machine that didn't get made because people didn't want

[41:06] it and nobody's there to be like what the fuck this is bullshit and yet a guy is asking eight

[41:11] thousand dollars for Lord of the Rings one of the best machines of all time that's seventeen thousand

[41:16] dollars cheaper than wrath of Olympus and people are crapping all over him that to me is where this hobby

[41:25] is at it's stupid it's ludicrous it's odd world insanity at its best we are shitting on an amazing

[41:35] game that's that's simply being asked just just because think about it that guy's only asking maybe

[41:41] two thousand dollars more than that game was new yet wrath of Olympus the guy's asking eighteen

[41:47] thousand dollars more than it was when it was new and and that's okay and that's what I want to

[41:52] leave you with I don't have a conclusion here I think people are smart because I know no one's

[41:57] bought the wrath of Olympus yet and and and Hilton if you got offered twenty five thousand dollars

[42:02] for your wrath of Olympus and you did not sell it for twenty five thousand dollars you are fool my

[42:09] friend you should have sold it what so think about that for a minute he didn't want to take an eighteen

[42:17] thousand dollar profit on a game because of his love for pinball how stupid is that how silly are

[42:26] people that game is not worth eighteen twenty five thousand dollars it's just not it's not you'll

[42:34] never get an experience it comes anywhere close to that and you'll never have a good story the

[42:39] game doesn't look good the game's on a great game it's not if it was so great why didn't people want

[42:44] it right so think about that this weekend as you watch football you enjoy beer and think about

[42:52] how do we how do we actually comment in these threads in a way that shows that you guys are

[42:58] educated thought provoking critically thinking men we should not allow this kind of ridiculousness

[43:05] to exist all right and if you haven't voted for me in your twippies now's the time go to this weekend

[43:12] pinball dot com favorite pinball podcast canada you don't even have to vote for anything else you can

[43:17] just you can just write in your on the second page right in your favorite pinball podcast

[43:22] close out this show with one last bit of news that I forgot to mention that our friend Zach many

[43:28] he is now a pinball distributor Zach had some really big news he bought a pinball distribution

[43:35] company and I should know the name I don't want to get it wrong I think it's like this flipping pinball

[43:41] is the name of the company or flipping pinball and now he's a distributor which is really awesome news

[43:49] and and Zach we congratulate you how they'll do an objective pinball reviews now that he's I

[43:56] think he's got to give it up I think when you actually it's like it's like it's like buying a

[44:02] a card dealership you kind of then can't still work in the automotive media so how's he going to do

[44:09] both of those things I'm curious it's okay though it's okay Greg needs a place to go and do podcasts

[44:15] he's always welcome to come back on the show but I did see that that Zach is pretty much selling

[44:21] everything so if he is selling almost all manufacturers that I don't think that would prohibit him

[44:27] from being honest about the games but but but he's now by nature a salesman and so when you're

[44:36] a salesman are you gonna be honest I don't know how you do it I don't know how you do it but I know

[44:43] that I'm glad he took this step and I'll explain why because he knows what I know what it Marty knows

[44:49] what Ryan knows what everybody knows you make no money in this industry doing what we do the money

[44:56] is made you know making money Nick Parks knows making money Stern Pimball a lot of distributors out

[45:02] there making good money they're selling a lot of machines and I think that Zach loves Pimball he

[45:07] thinks about Pimball all day long he wants to make Pimball part of his career in a way where he can

[45:13] do wake up and do what he loves every day and make money doing it and this was a really smart move

[45:18] to do that so we wish him the best of luck we look forward to seeing what comes of his venture

[45:26] and he's got a lot of fans and so if you're gonna buy from someone and you're a fan of Zach

[45:32] now you got now you now you can actually not just be his buddy but you can you can help

[45:37] you know send his kids to college I think that's a good thing Zach congratulations brother

[45:41] um we'll talk to you all real soon that the next podcast will be the Quinn interview uh I think

[45:47] you'll enjoy it I'll say this though like he couldn't talk about that much so that that's just

[45:52] where right deep roots keeping stuff close to the vest so there's not gonna be like a huge reveal

[45:58] that's happened on the show but it's interesting to see his take on Pimball because he doesn't come

[46:02] from Pimball and that's that's interesting I don't think any other game company has a story teller

[46:08] on board the way they have Quinn on over at deep roots so check it out that'll be episode 303

[46:14] everyone have a great Sunday have a great Martin Luther King day I know you guys are probably off
