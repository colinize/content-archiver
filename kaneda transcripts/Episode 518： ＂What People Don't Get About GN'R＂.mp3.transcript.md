[00:00] We need some time on your own

[00:06] We need some time on your own

[00:12] Oh everybody need some time on your own

[00:18] Oh don't you know you need some time on your own

[00:30] Does anyone else out there just think you need some time all alone with guns and roses pinball just to see for yourself how great this game is or how bad this game is or how amazing it is or how annoying the scoop is or how much fun it is to go through a rock and roll concert or how annoying it is to have so many multi balls right I think I've been so exhausted and drained this week you know we've gone through the typical love affair with the game on day one

[01:00] Inside 24 to 48 hours and they will do what pinside does they will find ways to fall out of love with every single game that comes out it's what they do best you know because I've always said it people bring themselves to this hobby and there's just a lot of joyless people that are in pinball for some reason and I don't understand it I don't get it but look there's always a lot to love about every game

[01:25] There's always a lot to be annoyed about with every game a game can be half empty a game can be half full and every pinball machine is an experience that is subjective and you might love it and you might hate it now here is my thoughts on the week first and foremost I can't wait to play this game I mean I don't know about you but I'm not watching streams in this game I just can't wait to play it and I'll talk a little bit about streams in a minute but my thoughts after this week are simply this

[01:55] is a grand slam home run for Jersey Jack pinball there's no way around that they sold out all 500 remember people thought I was crazy that they would sell out of C.E.'s they sold all 500 in one day at 12500 dollars so I want to say congratulations to Jersey Jack pinball for finally doing it none of their other titles none of their other titles ever had this kind of launch had this kind of reveal

[02:24] and this kind of sales success on day one so that is a really good thing you know why because that means Jersey Jack pinball is going to be around for a while they figured out how to become profitable and successful in Chicago this is the new company right I mean I feel bad for Jack but really Jack being removed from this thing is maybe the reason why it worked this time I mean when he was in charge this stuff wasn't going this efficiently and this effectively so kudos to everyone over there in Chicago

[02:54] who got it done because you gentlemen you got it done okay it was the best pinball reveal ever in the history of pinball reveals no game has ever been revealed so well and brought to the world in such stunning fashion in such energetic fashion and that's all everyone needed to see we all we needed to see on this game

[03:14] we saw Monday and that's why everyone is in on this game okay so now we've seen more of gameplay we've seen more of the footage of the game people have own the game people have it in their homes people have it at distributors and I just want to say this I've talked to in overwhelming amount of people who have played the game

[03:32] not look that streams with no energy not look that streams in which they're just sort of boring you with with low volume and and stuff like that I've talked to people who have played this game who have played every single new game who have played Avengers who have played

[03:48] Ninja Turtles who have no skin in the game they're not J.J.P. fanboys like Derek you know who Derek is these people have played this game and everything else available right now and they said Chris this game is amazing it's spectacular

[04:01] nothing else comes close to giving you the experience this game gives you and that's the part that I think a lot of people out there that are like the old pinball

[04:10] cramogens and look I hate to call you guys old cramogens because you're not all old cramogens but I think a lot of you out there are just so used to pinball being delivered to you the same way

[04:21] the same type of approach the same type of rules the same this the same that and I think what people are missing is very simply this you have to approach this game with this in mind this game this pinball machine this box of lights is actually a many guns and roses concert in a box you have in your home a guns and roses concert in pinball form hard stop you need to understand that that is what you are buying

[04:50] you are buying and if you don't love guns and roses think about it like this you're buying a rock and roll concert in a box that will blow you away with lights with sound with energy with all the things you'd expect at an amazing rock and roll show in a box that doesn't happen with AC DC

[05:08] it doesn't happen with Metallica it doesn't happen with any other music pin in the history of pinball so if you think about it like that you start to understand why this game is genius

[05:18] why this game is so creative and why as I've been saying the entire game is the mech the entire game is the bash toy the entire game is the experience and everyone's now everyone who approaches this game who tries to deconstruct it like another pinball machine and look for those singular things to get excited by you're missing the forest through the trees it's the game that's the exciting thing it's the game that's the game that's going to be the same thing

[05:47] it's the game that's blowing people away the experience of this game is blowing people away and the other thing is you can't capture that experience with a stream and that you can you capture if you look at a gunzer roses concert on YouTube it's like that watch a gunzer roses concert on YouTube and then go to one

[06:06] and then go to one you know how many of my friends out there said guns and roses sucks Axe Rose sounds like crap this band's not good and then I take him to a concert and they're like oh my f in God this band is insane and you see them live and you hear Axel live and you hear a slash live and you see everyone going crazy you can't you can't replicate a concert going experience unless you're there

[06:31] you can't get the experience of guns and roses pinball unless you're standing in front of it and that's awesome it is so awesome that they made a pin where when you're in front of it it transports you to another world to a concert it's never been done before

[06:48] and right there hard stop is the reason why all 500 sold out in one day it's the reason why people playing this machine are being blown away and it's the reason why

[06:59] the old cramudge and pinside nitpickers the pinside babies you hear them I mean I'm reading them these joyless men who will find something to complain about they don't understand that

[07:10] they don't understand that that's what this game is about keeping these songs going keeping the rock concert going so when you start to understand that and how the

[07:19] multi balls work and how the code works with that you don't complain you stop looking at it like it's just it's not like pirates of the Caribbean it's not like Willy Wonka it's not like Metallica it is unlike any other

[07:33] pin ever so you can't compare how you're going to feel when you play this game by comparing it to other pinball experiences you had and I get you might have

[07:43] hated multi balls in the habit so guess what this ain't the habit you might have hated multi balls in pirates of the Caribbean guess what this is in

[07:52] pirates of the Caribbean so when you play it I have a hard time believing anyone's going to walk away from guns and roses with those songs blasting in the light show going and the

[08:02] shots you're hitting I have a hard time believing anyone's going to walk away and say that wasn't fun that wasn't amazing this is going to be one of the most

[08:12] pinball experiences you have because it's a completely new take on what a pinball rock and roll game can be and I'm not even talking about all the stuff they put into this game I mean for

[08:24] months I had the white wood and I have the artwork on the game that's all I had I did not know anything that was going to be in the game and after learning about all the

[08:33] things slash put into this game and all the things key for put into this game and all the little things they put into this game all the attention to detail you

[08:43] slash re recording guitar licks when you hit switches you hear new licks of guitar it's insane I never thought it was going to be this much the

[08:51] amount of effort that went into sinking up the video with the studio track is incredible I mean I I cheated I said I wasn't going to listen to

[09:01] this I said I wasn't going to watch streams and I watched one stream and I watched these three people I think it was like flipping stream or

[09:08] something like that they they flipped it and they were playing the song better and it was three of them having fun and better and I was watching

[09:15] axel just hit every note and I was watching the game light up and I was like I'm I'm sold I mean this is this is a this is a

[09:22] mini guns and roses concert for me this is like having a jukebox that you can play that's actually a concert featuring the one of the

[09:30] back and roll bands of all time this is insane like the way they did this is insane it's not going to annoy I was I was so worried that it was going to be concert footage like

[09:39] wanka where it wasn't synced up with the songs and I was so worried it was going to be that I'm so happy they listened they

[09:46] listened and here's the thing for some of you out there who are complaining about the multiples and the scoop and this and that they can tweak stuff you

[09:55] think they're not listening to feedback they get that stuff's easy it is easy to tweak some of those things to make the game a little bit harder for some of you

[10:03] but here's what I'm really taking away from the pinside complainers and and I mean this and I mean this and I've said this before

[10:10] incredible pinball players tournament players have sucked the life out of the pinball hobby and I mean that and here's what I mean by that

[10:18] and I'm not nothing personal against them but what they look for in a game is not what you and I look for what they look for in a game

[10:26] isn't like an experience or a moment they just care about scoring like that's what they look for rules set to understand how to get to big

[10:34] points to them it doesn't matter to keep November rain going to the end it doesn't matter you know the feeling you get when you play

[10:41] paradise city a tournament player could play the game on mute and just know where the scoring pathways are and that's all that matters

[10:48] because that's all that matters in a tournament you don't walk away from a tournament and win because you have the most fun

[10:54] you win because you put up the biggest score and pinball was never meant to be a tournament game it just was never meant to be a tournament

[11:01] game yes I get that there was always scoring in pinball machines and the high score one absolutely but I think

[11:08] somewhere especially when pinballs become more of a home product a home product right you're not in our

[11:13] Kate somewhere along the line the best pinball games the best pinball games give you moments and give you

[11:20] experiences and guess what when those moments equal high score that's when you have the best games ever okay

[11:26] but I just see there's so many people that complain about things and it's like they don't care about the moments

[11:32] they don't care about the magic of the light show that doesn't matter to anyone why would a light show

[11:36] anyone who's playing you know in a tournament to find high scores okay and I just think a lot of these pinball

[11:42] companies have been catering to the super amazing players and they left all of us behind they made the games too

[11:48] hard they made the games for those amazing players so those guys could be challenged but somewhere along the line

[11:55] they left us out they made the games too challenging for us too frustrating and they just weren't you know

[12:00] appealing long term for most pinball buyers they made this game guns and roses was made for a more casual

[12:06] audience you have to agree and I agree it was it was made to be flipped it was made so everyone can start a

[12:12] song so that almost anyone who plays this game can find their way to a multi ball it was made for that

[12:17] and I'm glad they made it that way this will bring more pinball joy to the masses than almost any

[12:24] game I've seen recently this will make people happy people will walk up to guns and roses and have a great experience

[12:31] you can't say that for all these stern that have come out a lot of games are just confusing you people can't walk up to

[12:37] pirates of the Caribbean and know what to do they can't it's too confusing this game was made for the masses

[12:43] and I guarantee you key for and the team over there there are going to be things that are going to be hard to get

[12:50] to for the more advanced players he always does that you know that's coming all right so I also want to say look the whole

[12:57] collector's edition debacle for those of you out there who missed out I'm here to tell you something

[13:02] and I have a collector's edition I was able to secure a collector's edition and you know me I've been talking

[13:07] about this pin forever I've been saying that I'm going to get a collector's edition forever I'm the biggest

[13:12] guns and roses fan I don't mean to be selfish but you have to admit if anyone deserves a collector's

[13:18] edition of guns and roses it's canada okay and it belongs in my world all right but for those of you

[13:24] out there who didn't get one here's the good news the Ellie is amazing the Ellie art package I would argue

[13:30] is probably better than the C.E. art package I don't think you're ever going to be disappointed that you don't

[13:36] have a collector's edition I don't now that being said I always like to speculate on prices these things went

[13:44] really fast and there are 800 plus people I heard there were a thousand people that wanted a C.E.

[13:50] They're not making more they're not making more C.E.s if I were to guess what a C.E. will be on the second hand

[13:57] market and again don't kill me here and I'm not flipping mine it's okay I'm not flipping mine but I'm looking

[14:03] at like 20k if you want to get your hands on a C.E. I mean if look at what Rick and Morty is going

[14:08] for when it was hot you know and this game's so much hotter than Rick and Morty it shoots so much better

[14:14] than Rick and Morty it has so much more in it than Rick and Morty not to take anything away from

[14:17] Rick and Morty Rick and Morty is a great game at like 7500 bucks everyone knows that you can dress it

[14:23] up to get to $9500 but it's a $7500 game and spooky is a smaller company Jersey Jack has way more resources

[14:30] in their game you know to put in their games so I think you'll be happy with the Ellie now some

[14:36] regions got really screwed on the C.E.s I mean Australia is only getting 10 I mean 10 but if you think

[14:43] about the prices in Australia a C.E. over there I think is like 20 grand to begin with so those 10

[14:50] people are going to have probably the most sought after pinball machine in the history of new game

[14:55] releases for Australia right so ultimately people I might play the game tomorrow at Coin Takeer

[15:01] I'm not sure if I can get down there I'm going to try but ultimately I'm exhausted I love what I've seen in

[15:08] this game I can't wait to own this game this game will be bolted to my floor just because I'm such a big

[15:14] guns and roses fan I think pinside is becoming more and more a place of ultra negativity of so much complaining

[15:22] and it's not everybody but you know because here's the thing I talked to the people that love this game and I'm like

[15:27] go to pinside and say how amazing it is and like dude I don't bother with that site anymore like why would I go there

[15:33] it's like you go there to get upset you go there for people to rag on you you go there to get into a

[15:40] bad mood and there's one weird thing about this hobby and then I'll let you guys go today there's one really

[15:45] weird thing and I've noticed it as I've been hyping this game like people get upset they get upset when you're

[15:51] happy about pinball like they want to tear down your joy of a game and I've never understood that I've never

[15:58] understood that I mean that's I guess I do that sometimes if you love October fish you're going to hear it from

[16:03] canada but ultimately ultimately if you love a game it doesn't matter what anyone else says

[16:08] all right I got a few emails let me read these and then we'll be done I want to thank my new

[16:12] patreon contributors Ryan Gableman and Brandon Hoffman guys thank you so much for donating to

[16:18] canada's pinball podcast I really really appreciate it right and also sorry didn't forget you Al

[16:24] Wilson also contributed to the show Al thank you so much so I emailed from Tim father be Tim said

[16:30] you know when a wrestler oversells a move I know you're trying to build hype but it's still just a

[16:36] box full of LEDs which is also a pinball machine do you see any moments under glass outside of

[16:43] the light show that's what I wasn't able to see that you normally say a new pinball machine must

[16:49] have the video clips animations do look good however staying positive seemed a little simple

[16:55] however from a pinball perspective the ball isn't doing anything crazy amazing or different the

[17:01] art looks great theme integration awesome I do consider buying one but it faded or I did consider

[17:07] buying one okay Tim thank you Tim as I said as I said you know this is a unique game because I

[17:12] will agree with you the ball isn't doing anything amazing that makes you go wow you know what's doing the amazing

[17:17] thing that makes you go wow the machine itself and again I think that's the big the big change

[17:22] over and in this game and this isn't been done before right this this hasn't been done before I'll

[17:27] give you an example of what I mean you know when you destroy the ring and lower the rings and the

[17:31] machine goes haywire right that's a wow moment in which the machine itself is creating the

[17:37] wow and there's no balls going it's just the machines going crazy this is that this is that non stop the entire game is going crazy

[17:45] because you're at a rock and roll concert and it's not about what the ball is doing as much as it is about what the machine is doing

[17:52] and you're simply playing inside that rock concert so Tim I think if you look at it like that you're going to start to understand why this game is so magical

[18:00] so Ryan Lowe said G&R first I think you should read some letters on a show sometime in regards to thanking Eric and slash

[18:09] second if you hadn't primed me for G&R I may have looked at it skeptically and perhaps cynically because I listen to other

[18:16] genres of music back then this game is more than a genre title this game transcends

[18:22] pinball this is a complete immersive audio video experience and is like nothing we have seen in this hobby many

[18:29] people are still processing and do not fully realize the gravity of what we only dreamt about but was never quite

[18:37] possible due to cost and licensing overruns this reminds me of the iPhone remember how other phones have the same

[18:44] features but they never really worked this game is magnificent so thank you for the primer I'm hopefully in on a

[18:52] CE as I ordered directly yes I ordered direct yesterday from J.J.P. Ryan Lowe Ryan you get it you win the prize for understanding this game perfectly

[19:03] and I hope you got your CE I know Jen was calling people giving them confirmations so you should have got it if you ordered

[19:10] directly from Jersey Jack pinball are you going to email from Troy Troy says hey Chris first welcome back to

[19:16] podcasting I missed the show and the pinball world was not the same without it I agree Troy you're very smart let's see

[19:23] what else you say you said you were right about G&R what a game I'm in on a CE and like you I will not watch

[19:30] streams or gameplay videos I want the initial excitement for the first time when I get my machine nothing like

[19:36] seeing it fire up for the first time I did the same with dialed in collectors edition in iron maiden and it was great

[19:42] J.J.P. definitely takes it up a notch but I love my maiden premium as well we have a lot to look forward to from both Eric and Keith

[19:50] that said I'm a huge lawler fan his games and innovations helped make pinball what it is today I think he and others

[19:56] helped make it possible for these young guys to grow up loving pinball and wanting to create new and exciting

[20:02] games I mentioned this as one of my favorite guitar players passed away today Eddie van hailing he changed the way

[20:09] people thought about guitar playing and influenced so many young musicians I think it's the same in pinball

[20:15] thanks again for all you're doing to keep us entertained and up on the latest pinball news hope to see you at tpf

[20:21] and winning another twippy hope you Brenda and Bubba are well Troy well Troy thank you so much I'm so happy

[20:27] you're excited about this game and I do agree that Eddie van hailing first of all God rest his soul he changed guitar playing he

[20:35] changed the way people thought about guitar and Eddie van hailing was an icon that that spawned other guitarist for sure the only difference

[20:43] I would say between Eddie van hailing and and pat lawler is one thing Eddie van hailing was a nice man okay I'll leave it

[20:50] at that I got an email from Justin call and take Chris got in on a CE with Joe within 60 seconds of his email going out

[20:57] pinside and Facebook groups are up in arms tonight about J.J.P. holding allocations to sell direct and maximize margin any chance

[21:04] you may address this yes Justin I did and you heard there's an entire show on it so you can go listen to my thoughts on what went down

[21:11] I got an email from Jason Mick Lenin he said welcome back I had no idea you returned I had no idea you returned

[21:18] until today I like J.J.P. games and have interest in G.N.R. but I am waiting I like J.J.P. machines but they are always slow to put them out

[21:26] and I would bet they pulled the yellow brick road in black arrow edition route alright so J.T.

[21:31] things are going to make more additions of this game and so here's the thing people keep asking me do you think they're going to make more

[21:35] do you think they're going to make more they're not going to make more collectors additions they're they have 5,000

[21:40] L.E.s like that's a lot to get through I don't think they're going to sell 5,000 guns or roses L.E.s maybe in one year maybe I

[21:47] think they're going to sell all of those I do and then yeah they'll have to make a new addition to it and that won't be too hard

[21:53] but I think we're at least a year away from seeing another guns and roses addition and by then we're going to get toy story I don't know I don't

[22:00] if J.J.P. can keep games coming out I don't think we're going to see the demand continue on for years and years and years just because they'll have new games

[22:07] and that's where the demand will go so Bruno Severino said I like you and the big guns roses fan having seen them 5 times since 1988

[22:15] in Australia I really wanted to like this machine but after watching the Buffalo stream I will pass the assets and light show is fantastic

[22:23] second to none but the game looks pretty clunky to me and lacks any major toy there's nothing mechanically on the play field that really excites me

[22:31] and when a J.J.P. cost $3,500 Australian dollars more than it's turned premium I will pass okay so Bruno again man I think you're seeing it wrong

[22:40] and I think the Buffalo pinball stream did more harm to this game than anything this week because it was low energy

[22:47] it's like again it's like watching a guns roses concert on your cell phone it's not how it's supposed to go down

[22:53] and everyone else that I've seen play the game who's actually stood in front of it and communicated their excitement for it that they've been blown away

[23:01] and I just didn't get that excitement from the Buffalo stream I didn't get excitement from them playing it it was just one guy playing it right

[23:06] like that's not how this game needs to be streamed the way this game needs to be streamed is this way

[23:11] you go to a strip club you put the machine inside a strip club it's guns and roses you get a bottle of Jack Daniels

[23:16] you pound it with your friends and then you go play Guns and Rose's pinball that's how you stream guns and roses pinball

[23:22] I mean I told someone I want to hear the rules set from a stripper sitting on my lap when I play guns and roses

[23:27] I mean this is guns and roses people this is guns and roses this is what this band saying about all right one last note from West was Kowski

[23:34] he said hey Chris just heard on your Facebook stream from earlier where you took issue with Buffalo pinball streams

[23:41] and mention why not have Jack danger in or fly you in I know your views on travel but really why didn't you attempt to extend that offer

[23:50] if even just to play the game immediately rather than wait for local play which might not happen or wait longer for CE production

[23:57] well first of all west there is no way Jersey Jack pinball is inviting me to do anything with them

[24:01] there's no way there's no way I they don't like me they're they're not fans of Canadian pinball pockets think about it

[24:07] everyone else out there is doing shows in which they're interviewing people at JJP I'm the number one show

[24:12] I have the largest audience they did not knock on my door or offer me anyone to talk to you

[24:17] do I want to talk to people over there absolutely I asked Eric to come on the show see it's the same situation as Stern

[24:23] they have to get permission to go on Canadian pinball podcasts and they won't do it

[24:27] they won't do it because I have shows that have ruffled their feathers and I'd rather have my show be like this

[24:33] and say whatever I want about them then to simply being good graces to get the interviews but here's what you should do

[24:39] go listen to the interviews because they're phenomenal there's an amazing interview with Keith on Jeff T. Olis and Marty's show on the pinball network

[24:47] go listen to that it's incredible the super awesome pinball show Christopher Franchi they interviewed Eric go listen to that

[24:54] right you're gonna hear these guys interview left and right left and right you know they were never gonna invite me down there but Jack danger should have gone

[25:01] and played the game with slash slash was at Chicago this week he was at Chicago and I do think they under utilized him when it came to streaming again

[25:11] Jack danger and slash with a bottle of whiskey is how I want to see this game played for the first time

[25:17] he goes on to say then you seem to continue the discussion of why do these streams when you also seem to just keep going live

[25:24] and discussing a game you haven't played yet there's irony there both practices can be viewed as redundant in ways wait wait a minute

[25:31] Wes you're saying that me going on Facebook live and saying how much I love this game is being ironic or contradictory to my viewpoints

[25:40] that these streams are hurting they're hurting people's excitement around these games how is me getting excited on Facebook

[25:47] hurting anyone all mom doing is getting people excited when you watch this stream and it's presented in such a low volume low energy way

[25:55] that to me is doing the game in injustice me hyping it is not doing in injustice because I know it delivers he then goes on to say

[26:04] the reality is that even in a healthy error location play is rarely possible for many and next day location play like hella con where I was at is almost entirely impossible for many

[26:15] so yes dull streams or amazing streams they're still allowing access to many I just don't understand your pent up frustration as in reality you need to play this game ASAP to see whether or not you'll love it as much or more than you hope keep up the good work

[26:30] but at the same time stay balanced ground it and get the energy out via exercise so Wes thank you i am going to play the game and you write you know I can call this game the game of the year until I play it but I'm calling it right now this is the game of the year it's going

[26:45] to win game of the year it's going to win designer of the year it's gonna win light show of the year its going to win

[26:52] It's gonna win sound of the year. It's gonna keep winning. It's gonna win animations of the year.

[26:56] It's just gonna win. It's gonna sweep at the twippy's the same way last year Jurassic Park swept almost everything.

[27:02] Get ready for it Wes and is that balance? No because it's Canadian Spinball podcast. Why not? I've been balanced.

[27:07] You know, I'm Canadian. Canadian's point of view is always 51% correct.

[27:12] Have a good day guys. We'll talk to you soon.
