[00:00] Sweet dreams are made of these, who am I to disagree?

[00:07] I travel the world and the seven seas, everybody's looking for something.

[00:15] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up!

[00:19] Ah, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] You survived the latest billing cycle for Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:26] I'm gonna do something fun for each and every one of you.

[00:29] I'm gonna do a special episode right now about what I believe are the top 10 pinball machines

[00:35] that I consider to be collectible in modern pinball times.

[00:39] And I'm gonna go back to pinball machines that were sort of released since 2016 and today.

[00:46] These are the games that I think if you wanna build a pinball collection, you want people

[00:50] to walk into your game room and say, wow, you've got one of those, these are gonna be the 10

[00:56] pinball machines that I think are gonna be the staples for any great pinball collector.

[01:02] If you own any one of these machines, I think you have a great pinball machine already in

[01:07] your collection.

[01:08] If you bought any of these games for sticker price, congratulations, I think the value of

[01:14] each of these games is gonna hold steady and will probably go up over time.

[01:20] I'm gonna explain why in a minute.

[01:22] But these are Canada's top 10 pinball machines worth collecting.

[01:26] Now I wanna go over how I scored each of these games.

[01:29] And I'm not gonna give everything a B plus score.

[01:32] I'm gonna go over the criteria I use to come to the top 10 and I'm gonna do this in order.

[01:38] I'm gonna score these in terms of desirability from 10 to 1, 1 being the most desired.

[01:44] Now here was my criteria for coming to Canada's top 10 most collectible modern pins.

[01:50] The first criteria is gameplay and layout.

[01:53] How does the game play?

[01:54] From a pinball perspective, how popular is this game with pinball players?

[02:00] How much do people love playing this game and flipping this game?

[02:03] The second is visual wow.

[02:06] And I mean that.

[02:07] A lot of collectors out there just wanna have a collection that when you walk into their

[02:10] game room, it like visually pops.

[02:13] You know, you see the game, you're like, oh my gosh, you got one of them.

[02:16] And you could legitimately just stare at the machine while it's off and be super satisfied

[02:22] that it's in your game room.

[02:24] I'm gonna say right now, I did not include Magic Girl in my list of top 10 most collectible

[02:30] pins.

[02:31] I'm sorry, I'm sick of talking about Zidware stuff.

[02:33] I know there's an auction going on for the storage units for J-Pop.

[02:37] I just don't think we should still be talking about J-Pop on any level.

[02:41] Okay, so visual wow.

[02:43] The next is rarity.

[02:45] How rare is the game, right?

[02:47] How many did they make?

[02:48] How hard is it to get?

[02:50] And on a scale of one to 10, how rare is this machine?

[02:53] The next is theme.

[02:55] On a scale of one to 10, how good is this theme?

[02:58] Because theme matters when it comes to collectibility.

[03:01] Because the more popular and universal the theme, the more this thing is gonna remain

[03:05] collectible over the years.

[03:07] The more recognizable the theme is.

[03:09] All right, so here's an interesting category.

[03:12] Does this pin have a unique story or some unique elements?

[03:16] And that is why the pin is a collectible.

[03:19] So I'm gonna tell you how I scored each of these one through 10 on that.

[03:23] And then just what's the collector demand for this pinball machine, right?

[03:27] How often do these games come up for sale?

[03:30] How frequently are people letting them go?

[03:32] And we're gonna score on a scale of one to 10.

[03:35] 10 being it's the most desirable and it rarely comes up for sale.

[03:39] You've got one, two, three, four, five, six criteria by which I'm scoring these machines,

[03:45] which means the top score you could get is a 60.

[03:48] I'll tell you right now, none of them are gonna get a 60.

[03:50] So are you ready for Canada to do a pinball podcast that is not negative, that is not

[03:55] toxic, and he's not even gonna beg for your trippy vote right now.

[03:59] Coming in at number 10 is The Big Lebowski by Dutch Pinball.

[04:04] And here's how I scored it.

[04:05] I gave it a gameplay score of a seven.

[04:08] I gave it a seven.

[04:09] The game is a good shooter.

[04:10] It's not the best shooter.

[04:11] It's pretty standard fan layout, but it's got an upper play field.

[04:15] It's got the lower bowling alley.

[04:17] It's got a lot of toys and mechs in it.

[04:19] So this thing from a shooting standpoint, I gave it a seven.

[04:21] From a visual wow standpoint, I gave The Big Lebowski a 10.

[04:26] When you stand over a Big Lebowski, it is one of the most visually stunning games I've

[04:32] ever seen.

[04:33] It is probably the greatest theme in a graded pinball machine of all time.

[04:37] And that lower bowling alley, that lower play field, is probably the coolest mech I've seen

[04:44] put in a pinball machine since I've been covering this hobby.

[04:47] So it gets a 10 there.

[04:48] Now what's the rarity of The Big Lebowski?

[04:51] I gave it a five at a 10.

[04:52] And here's why.

[04:53] Because you can still order it today.

[04:55] If you want one, you could call up Melissa at Cointaker and get on the list to get one.

[05:01] So we don't even know how many they're gonna make.

[05:03] And so they're obviously gonna make at least a thousand of them, but we don't know when

[05:07] they're gonna stop making it.

[05:09] But it's not that rare.

[05:10] I see these games come up for sale all the time.

[05:13] You usually have to spend a couple more thousand dollars in MSRP, but you can get one.

[05:18] It's not hard to get.

[05:19] So when it came to theme, I gave Big Lebowski a six.

[05:22] It is a cult classic film.

[05:24] It is not for everybody, but it's a good theme for pinball.

[05:28] It's an adult theme.

[05:29] It syncs up very well with the pinball buying community.

[05:33] But I gave it a six.

[05:34] I think that's a fair score for theme.

[05:35] In terms of the pin having unique elements and a great story, this is where it got really

[05:41] interesting because I gave it a four.

[05:44] Now you might be saying, Chris, that's way too harsh for this game.

[05:48] And the reason why I gave it a four is this pinball machine, regardless of all the mechs

[05:53] and toys in it, the Dutch pinball history isn't a positive one.

[05:59] Now they've obviously turned a corner, but there's no way around it.

[06:03] This thing was released like eight years ago, and there are still people who paid for this

[06:08] game that never even got it.

[06:11] So I'm going to ding them for this.

[06:13] I don't think it's a great story.

[06:14] I think these negative stories about these boutique companies that took people's money

[06:19] and they didn't get their games, it's not a great story.

[06:22] So I gave it a four.

[06:24] In terms of collector demand, I gave it a five.

[06:27] I am somewhat surprised, right?

[06:28] I don't think this game is like, I need to find one.

[06:31] I need to get one right now.

[06:32] I think for a lot of you out there, you definitely are considering a big Lebowski in your collection.

[06:40] But because they're still making them right now, I don't think there's that sense of urgency

[06:45] to get one right now.

[06:46] And that's why it gets a five, and its total score is a 37 out of 60.

[06:52] All right, number nine on my list of top 10 most collectible modern pins is Godzilla

[06:58] Ellie by Stern Pinball.

[06:59] Now I gave this game a nine when it comes to gameplay and layout.

[07:03] It's a Keith Elwin pin.

[07:05] What else do you have to say?

[07:06] It's one of the best shooting pins Stern Pinball has ever made.

[07:10] The game shoots tremendously well.

[07:11] The visual wow on this game, I gave a seven.

[07:15] Now I think it's really fun to look at Godzilla with the zombie-eddy artwork and all the toys

[07:20] and mechs in the game, but the Ellie version of the game, and I mean it when I say it,

[07:24] I don't think the Ellie version of Godzilla really pops.

[07:28] There's something about that silver armor that's really boring.

[07:32] And we don't have a topper for the machine yet, so when you see a Godzilla Ellie in person,

[07:38] it doesn't really wow me that much.

[07:40] Now I gave it a seven, which I think is a fair score, but it's not the most visually

[07:45] stunning pin.

[07:46] All right, in terms of rarity, how rare is a Godzilla Ellie?

[07:51] I gave it a five out of 10.

[07:53] There's no way around it.

[07:54] There are a thousand of these.

[07:56] I think at any given point, you're going to be able to get one of these.

[08:00] You'll never be able to get one ever again for 10,500, but you will probably always,

[08:06] and I mean always, see a Godzilla Ellie offered for sale every single month as long as you

[08:14] are alive.

[08:15] So it gets a five out of 10.

[08:16] When it comes to theme, how good is the Godzilla theme?

[08:20] I gave it a five out of 10.

[08:21] Look, and the reason why is this.

[08:23] How many of you out there watch Godzilla movies?

[08:26] How many of you out there collect Godzilla stuff and merchandise?

[08:30] It's a niche theme.

[08:32] Godzilla is not a mainstream theme that everyone is clamoring for, so I gave it a five out

[08:38] of 10.

[08:39] When it comes to the pin having unique elements and a great story associated with it, right,

[08:44] if you walk up to a Godzilla pinball machine, is someone going to be able to tell you the

[08:49] story of what went into making it and how it's special and unique, I gave it a five out

[08:54] of 10.

[08:55] It's a beautiful shooter.

[08:56] It's got fun toys and mechs.

[08:58] It showed us that Stern can actually make an effort when it comes to mechanisms, but I

[09:03] just don't think Godzilla has a very unique story other than the fact that Stern pinball

[09:08] supposedly robbed Spooky Pinball from this theme.

[09:12] So I gave it a five out of 10.

[09:14] In terms of collector demand, I gave it a seven out of 10.

[09:17] The reason why I gave it a seven out of 10.

[09:19] Again, I think it's another pin that people want to add to their collection, but because

[09:24] there are so many of them out there, Godzilla LE does not light a fire under people every

[09:30] time one goes up for sale.

[09:32] But I definitely think Godzilla LE is going to be a pinball machine that collectors will

[09:36] desire for many years to come.

[09:39] But I also think Godzilla LE might fall off of this list.

[09:43] If Keith Elwin's next pin, and I don't mean the James Bond one, I mean maybe Jaws or something

[09:47] else, if he does something with more mainstream appeal, I could see Godzilla's going up for

[09:53] sale pretty frequently if he does something like Jaws or something like Back to the Future.

[09:59] So Godzilla LE is number nine.

[10:01] Number eight on my list might surprise some of you.

[10:05] I think the eighth most collectible pinball machine right now is no other than Spooky

[10:10] Pinball's lightning in a bottle theme, Rick and Morty.

[10:14] Now look, Rick and Morty when it comes to how the game shoots, I gave it a five.

[10:19] It is not a great shooter.

[10:20] I owned one, I've played one, I've played them on location.

[10:24] It is a clunky machine to shoot, but you don't buy this machine for the shot layout or the

[10:29] geometry.

[10:30] When it comes to visual wow, I gave Rick and Morty a six out of ten.

[10:35] The game looks like a Rick and Morty pinball machine, but it doesn't really like wow you.

[10:41] The butter cabinet is beautiful.

[10:43] I would absolutely get it with butter cabinet, but when you look at the playfield artwork

[10:47] and the cabinet artwork, it's not going to blow you away like some of the other games

[10:52] I'm about to mention.

[10:53] So it gets a six for visual wow.

[10:56] When it comes to rarity, I also gave Rick and Morty a six.

[10:59] Now here's what's interesting.

[11:00] Now here's what's interesting about this rarity category is basically there are 750

[11:06] Rick and Morty pinball machines ever.

[11:08] That's all they're ever going to make.

[11:09] So you could argue, Kanata, you should have a higher number for rarity, but the reason

[11:13] why I gave it a six is this game comes up for sale all the time.

[11:18] And I think the reason it comes up for sale all the time is because the game doesn't

[11:22] shoot very well, but it's still a very collectible pin.

[11:26] And it's still only one of 750 Rick and Morty's in the world when one goes up for sale.

[11:32] I don't think people who have this game for the most part are bolting it to the floor.

[11:36] Now when it comes to theme, I gave Rick and Morty an eight.

[11:40] I think this is a great theme for pinball.

[11:42] I think spooky pinball caught everybody else sleeping on this theme and it has millions

[11:48] and millions of fans around the world and the humor in the show is perfect for pinball.

[11:53] So it gets an eight when it comes to theme.

[11:56] When it comes to the pin having unique elements and a great story, I also gave this pinball

[12:02] machine an eight because I think the fact that they made this game with Justin and they

[12:07] got access to like all of the clips from the show and they so perfectly integrate it, the

[12:13] adventures of Rick and Morty in this game.

[12:16] I always enjoyed playing Rick and Morty.

[12:18] It just felt like the creator of the show gave them so much to work with and I think

[12:23] they put it into the game in such a fun way.

[12:26] So it gets an eight on that level because I think it's so cool to know that Justin and

[12:30] the team at spooky built this game together.

[12:33] When it comes to collector demand, I gave it a six.

[12:36] Again I think it's one of these games that collectors will always want but it's not like

[12:41] impossible to get and it's also a game I think if you love playing pinball, you are going

[12:47] to be somewhat frustrated with like the lack of good shots in the game.

[12:51] So overall Rick and Morty beating out Godzilla.

[12:54] I know it's beating out Godzilla only by one point.

[12:57] It gets a 39 out of 60.

[12:59] You guys are like already turning me off.

[13:01] You're like how can a spooky pinball machine beat Godzilla?

[13:03] Again, it's because there's a thousand Godzilla LEDs.

[13:06] It's just never going to be that rare.

[13:08] Number seven on my list of most collectible modern pins is medieval madness, Royal Edition.

[13:14] Now they only made 369 Royal editions of medieval madness.

[13:19] When it comes to how good does this game shoot, I gave it a nine out of 10.

[13:24] This is one of the best pinball machines of all time.

[13:27] It's one of those games that 30 years later this game still holds up and people love playing

[13:32] this game.

[13:33] When it comes to the visual, wow, I gave the medieval madness Royal Edition a six out of

[13:38] 10.

[13:39] I'll tell you why I gave it a six out of 10.

[13:41] Like I'm looking at it again.

[13:42] The topper is really cool but you know it doesn't really really stand out.

[13:47] Like it's black powder coated armor.

[13:50] We've already seen that in other versions like the Ellie version of medieval madness and

[13:56] you could pretty much make your Ellie of medieval madness look exactly like your Royal Edition.

[14:02] So I don't think you walk into a game room and you're like, oh my God, from across the

[14:06] room I can identify that as a Royal Edition.

[14:10] It just doesn't pop like that.

[14:12] When it comes to rarity, I did give this game a nine.

[14:16] Like there's not many of them.

[14:18] There's only 369 and it's really hard to find this game.

[14:22] As I was saying, you don't often see Royal Editions go up for sale.

[14:27] People are bolting these games to the ground because there's only 369.

[14:33] I think that's the number and it's medieval madness.

[14:35] It's one of the greatest games ever and you feel like you've got the sort of SLE version

[14:39] of it with the Royal Edition.

[14:41] When it comes to theme, I gave it a five.

[14:43] Like only people who love pinball like know what this is.

[14:46] This doesn't pull in other people.

[14:48] If people walk into your game room and see medieval madness next to Mandalorian, which

[14:54] one do you think they're going to want to jump on right away?

[14:56] It's not going to be medieval madness.

[14:58] So it gets a five out of 10.

[15:00] When it comes to the pin has unique elements or a great story.

[15:04] I gave it a three.

[15:05] I really don't know what the great story is here.

[15:09] It was just part of a rerun of medieval madness and you know, it was meant to create some more

[15:13] urgency and FOMO to buy the rerun of the game.

[15:17] And here's the other thing.

[15:18] I think they might do another run.

[15:20] They're probably going to do another run of medieval madness games.

[15:24] And so now we don't even know if the Royal Edition is even going to hold its value.

[15:30] So I would be somewhat nervous that they're going to make another edition of this game

[15:35] that's going to make the Royal Edition feel like it's not the top dog.

[15:39] There's also so many versions of medieval madness out there.

[15:42] The classic, the standard, the LE, the Royal.

[15:45] When you get to that level, I don't really know what the story is anymore.

[15:48] So that's why it gets a three out of 10.

[15:50] When it comes to collector demand, it gets a nine.

[15:53] This is high.

[15:54] People want this machine.

[15:56] Medieval madness Royal Editions do not stay on the marketplace very long.

[16:00] This is one of the most in-demand modern games.

[16:03] Even though it's a remake, it's one of the most in-demand games.

[16:05] And when these things go up for sale, they are pretty much sold immediately.

[16:10] The medieval madness Royal Edition gets a total score of 41 out of 60.

[16:17] Coming in at number six on Canada's top 10 most collectible modern pins is Elvira, the

[16:23] signature edition or the 40th anniversary edition of the game.

[16:28] In terms of gameplay layout, it's a great shooter.

[16:31] It's a great shooter.

[16:32] This is one of Sturm Pinball's most fun games to shoot.

[16:35] I gave it an eight out of 10 in terms of gameplay and layout.

[16:39] When it comes to visual wow, I gave it an eight out of 10.

[16:43] Now it almost got a nine.

[16:44] It almost got a nine.

[16:45] I gave it an eight out of 10.

[16:47] I think these games are stunning.

[16:48] I think when you stand over them, they're stunning.

[16:51] It's just the way they drew Elvira is a little weird on the translate.

[16:54] It's just a little off-putting like she does.

[16:56] She looks normal on the cabinet, but then on the translate, like her features are so abnormal.

[17:02] It's just kind of strange.

[17:03] When you stand over the game as well, it's got a really nice art package.

[17:08] It's very colorful and bright, but it doesn't have the detail on some of the other games

[17:12] that you're going to see on this list.

[17:14] So I gave the visual wow, I think a very, very healthy eight out of 10.

[17:18] When it comes to rarity, how rare is this game?

[17:21] I gave it an eight out of 10.

[17:24] And the reason I did that is that if you go on the marketplace right now, you can still

[17:28] get them.

[17:29] The problem is everybody wants like 21, 22, 23, $25,000 for like a new in box 40th anniversary.

[17:38] And we all know that Stern gave those two distributors for $15,000, but they still are

[17:45] very rare.

[17:46] They're hard to find.

[17:48] It's impossible to find one at a good price.

[17:50] So they are very rare.

[17:52] Remember, they only made 50 versions of the signature edition, which came with a piece

[17:56] of couch.

[17:57] And then they made 199 of the 40th anniversary edition.

[18:02] So in total, there's only what 249 of these games available for people if you want one.

[18:11] When you start to think about what's happening now, where everything that's supposed to be

[18:15] a collectible has a thousand units made, these are going to be the ones that people go after

[18:22] because there's just not many of them out there.

[18:25] And that's going to keep the value of these things very high and very sought after.

[18:29] And when it comes to theme, I gave Elvira a four.

[18:32] And I'm telling you why it's a four.

[18:34] I mean, come on.

[18:35] Like I get that she's popular.

[18:37] I get that she's popular within like the pinball demographic per se, but this isn't like a

[18:42] mainstream universal property that everybody loves.

[18:46] I think you might have problems putting this theme into some game rooms where there are

[18:50] family and young kids for obvious reasons.

[18:54] So I gave it a four out of 10.

[18:56] You can argue with me on that.

[18:58] But if I had to pick a theme that I think pinball people absolutely would die to have

[19:01] a theme of, I don't think Elvira is where I would go.

[19:04] When it comes to the pin having unique elements or a great story, I gave it a seven.

[19:09] You know, I don't think there's like an incredible story attached to this game.

[19:12] I think it has an interesting story in which Dennis Nordman made the game.

[19:16] I think that's really unique.

[19:18] I think it's really awesome that Elvira worked with Stern on the game.

[19:22] You get her callouts in the game, which is super cool.

[19:25] But there's a little bit of a cash grab element to this game.

[19:29] And I think that taints the story a little bit about how Stern launched this game.

[19:33] I wasn't happy the way they did it.

[19:35] They didn't set a price.

[19:36] You didn't know what you were supposed to buy it for.

[19:39] So I think it was a little bit sloppy there.

[19:41] And I think that turned off some collectors the way they launched this game.

[19:45] But I would also say the most interesting part of this game is this is the last pinball

[19:50] machine that Lyman Sheets ever did with Stern Pinball.

[19:54] And I think that carries a lot of weight.

[19:56] And I think, you know, as we think about what's worth collecting, it goes without saying,

[20:00] if you want to have one of the greatest pinball collections on planet Earth, you might as well

[20:04] just go collect every single game that Lyman Sheets worked on.

[20:08] Because he also worked on a game called Medieval Madness, right?

[20:11] He coded Medieval Madness, The Walking Dead, ACDC Metallica, Spider-Man.

[20:16] I mean, the guy was so prolific and put the best experience ever into the software of

[20:21] the pinball machines he programmed.

[20:23] So Elvira gets a seven when it comes to great story and unique elements.

[20:27] I would also argue that that house in the game is so awesome and that's such a great

[20:31] mech.

[20:32] When it comes to collector demand, I think right now Elvira is sitting at a seven.

[20:37] And the reason why I say seven is there are a bunch of them for sale right now.

[20:42] And that's because I think all the people trying to sell them are pretty greedy.

[20:46] I don't think people really want to buy it over $20,000 for one of these games.

[20:52] And that's the thing.

[20:53] It's like the sloppy way they launched it, the fact that they never priced it.

[20:57] You know, and also the fact that it is Elvira.

[20:59] I think the collector demand is around a seven.

[21:02] So Elvira finishes with 42 points out of 60.

[21:06] All right, coming in at number five, coming in at number five on what I think will be

[21:11] the top 10 most collectible pins in the modern era is Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition by

[21:16] Jersey Jack Pinball.

[21:18] And you know me, I'm a fan of this game.

[21:19] I think it's a masterpiece.

[21:20] But let me explain to you why.

[21:22] If I'm going to build a collection, I think this is one of the games you should really

[21:25] consider collecting.

[21:26] And here's why.

[21:27] When it comes to gameplay, it's not the best.

[21:30] I'm not going to lie.

[21:31] It doesn't shoot as good as Stern pinball machines.

[21:34] It doesn't have the best flow.

[21:35] So I gave it a six out of 10 when it comes to gameplay.

[21:39] When it comes to visual, wow, when you walk into a room and you see a Guns N' Roses Collector's

[21:44] Edition and you see the light show and the cabinets and the radcals and the illustrated

[21:49] artwork.

[21:50] This game blows you away visually.

[21:53] I gave it a nine out of 10 in terms of visual pop.

[21:57] This game just makes a statement.

[21:59] When it comes to rarity, how rare is Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition?

[22:04] I gave it a seven out of 10.

[22:06] They only made 500 of them, but they do come up for sale pretty often.

[22:12] And there was a period a few months ago when the prices of CEs were dipping into like 13

[22:17] to $15,000.

[22:20] Now we are seeing the prices go back up to $18,000, but there has always been a handful

[22:26] of these games for sale over the past few years.

[22:30] But at any given moment, they are always available to get.

[22:32] So that's why I gave it a seven.

[22:34] When it comes to theme, how good is the Guns N' Roses theme?

[22:38] Now, look, I probably could have gotten a little bit lower on rarity and I also probably

[22:43] could have gotten higher on theme because Guns N' Roses, this global music act that

[22:48] everyone knows, they have all of their greatest hits in this game.

[22:52] I gave the theme a seven out of 10.

[22:55] I do think music is somewhat polarizing, but GNR and its music is perfect for Pimbal.

[23:02] When it comes to unique elements, great story, it gets a nine out of 10.

[23:07] And here's why.

[23:08] The unique element and the great story here is that slash of Guns N' Roses made this machine

[23:15] with Eric and the team over there.

[23:18] You are never, ever in a million years going to see another music pin with as much in it

[23:24] from the musical act as you will see in Guns N' Roses.

[23:29] This thing raised the bar like no other.

[23:32] The fact that slash called up Paul McCartney to get the rights to a Beatles song is unbelievable.

[23:40] You're never going to see it again.

[23:42] We are never going to see a theme-integrated music pin as good as Guns N' Roses ever again.

[23:47] I also think the story of this machine, I know I probably should ding it a few points

[23:51] because of all the playfield issues, but the story of how they launched this game, how

[23:56] excited everybody was when this game came out, it gets a nine out of 10, and then Collector

[24:01] Demand.

[24:02] And this is where I'm being honest, the Collector Demand on this game is a five.

[24:05] Again, it's not like the most sought after game.

[24:07] I think a lot of the FOMO has worn off.

[24:10] I think people who don't like Guns N' Roses wouldn't consider it.

[24:13] I also think because of the playfield issues and the fact that it's not the best shooter,

[24:17] I don't think collectors are clamoring at the bit to get one.

[24:21] And even though there's only 500, it just seems like they're always available to buy,

[24:26] so it gets a five out of 10.

[24:28] Now that makes GNR score a 43 out of 60.

[24:33] Now coming in right after Guns N' Roses is another machine from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[24:37] Coming in at number four on Canada's top 10 list of most collectible modern pins is Pirates

[24:43] of the Caribbean Collector's Edition.

[24:45] Now look, this is no surprise to anybody out there.

[24:48] Now when it comes to gameplay and layout, I gave it a seven out of 10.

[24:52] As a wide body machine, this machine actually shoots really nice for a wide body, but wide

[24:58] body machines are not the best shooters.

[25:00] And I actually think Pirates actually shoots better than Guns N' Roses, so it gets a seven.

[25:05] When it comes to visual wow, I gave Pirates CE with Davy Jones on the cabinet artwork

[25:11] and he's on the play field.

[25:13] I gave it a seven out of 10.

[25:15] It is a unique and interesting pin to look at with like all the coral reef on the armor

[25:21] and the topper.

[25:22] And when you see one, it is really nice, but it doesn't pop and have the most wow.

[25:27] It's a darker themed game.

[25:29] So I gave it a seven out of 10 when it comes to visual wow.

[25:32] When it comes to rarity, this is where we start to make up some real points.

[25:36] This is where it starts to gain some ground.

[25:38] It gets a 10.

[25:40] Like this game is rare.

[25:41] There are only 200 collector's editions out there in the world.

[25:45] There are only a thousand Pirates of the Caribbean games in total and it doesn't seem like they're

[25:50] ever going to make this game again.

[25:52] With so little Pirates of the Caribbean games being out there, it is a rare game.

[25:57] Like these things never really come up for sale that often anymore.

[26:01] And if they do, you're looking at like $30,000 plus for a CE.

[26:06] Now when it comes to theme, I gave it a six out of 10.

[26:09] I would give it more.

[26:10] The reason I gave it a six out of 10 is I think the Pirates franchise is kind of stale.

[26:15] The first couple of movies were great, but then they got really mediocre.

[26:19] And also like it's not a fully theme integrated pin, right?

[26:23] Like this pin is like really bad at theme integration.

[26:25] It just is.

[26:26] Like it's just not the best theme integrated version of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[26:30] So as a theme, it gets a six.

[26:32] Like a pirate theme pinball machine is good.

[26:35] It's just not like, oh my gosh, like Pirates of the Caribbean.

[26:38] Like, you know, like you find yourself watching those movies every year.

[26:41] No, it's not that kind of theme.

[26:42] When it comes to pin having unique elements and a great story, I gave it a six out of 10.

[26:48] And here's why.

[26:49] The story of Pirates of the Caribbean is simply this.

[26:52] The only reason why people really want this pinball machine is because they can't have any more.

[26:57] When this thing was available, it's sat in box.

[27:00] Nobody wanted to buy this game when they could buy it.

[27:04] Automated had a bunch of CEs sitting in a box for like two years at $12,500 and nobody wanted it.

[27:13] And then we saw one sell for 40,000 new in box when COVID hit.

[27:16] But the only reason this thing is super in demand, I get that some people will argue it's a really great game.

[27:23] I would say it's a good game.

[27:25] It's somewhat confusing, you know, picking 22 characters and you have no idea what you're doing

[27:30] when you walk up to this role playing game called Pirates of the Caribbean.

[27:33] But the only story that really matters is they yanked out the mechs, right?

[27:37] The triple spinning disc map thing.

[27:40] They yanked that out.

[27:41] They yanked out the treasure chest mech that closed the treasure chest and locked the balls.

[27:46] And remember, like that was how this game launched.

[27:48] Then people didn't really want it.

[27:50] And then the demand spiked when people realized they couldn't have it.

[27:53] So it's an interesting story, not the best story.

[27:56] It gets a six.

[27:58] In terms of collector demand, it gets a nine.

[28:00] I mean, this thing is sought after like people want it.

[28:03] Like even if you don't like Jersey Jack Pinball and you're just a pinball collector,

[28:06] this is on your very, very short list of super rare, fully featured game with really deep code

[28:13] that you could replay over and over and over again.

[28:16] And it's going to go down as Jersey Jack Pinball's most sought after pinball machine ever.

[28:21] It just is.

[28:22] So it gets a total score of 45 out of 60.

[28:27] All right, we're at the top three.

[28:28] Are you ready for Canada's top three choices for most collectible pins of the modern era?

[28:34] Here we go.

[28:35] Coming in at number three on my list of the most collectible pins you should think about

[28:41] if you want to build a collection that's going to hold value is Stranger Things, Ellie.

[28:47] I can't believe I'm endorsing Stranger Things, Ellie.

[28:50] I've ragged on this game for years, but I'm trying to be objective here, people.

[28:55] If I was a collector, this is a machine I would be looking to get my hands on.

[29:00] When it comes to gameplay and layout, how does this game shoot?

[29:05] It's a fun shooter.

[29:06] It gets an eight out of 10.

[29:08] This is a typical Brian Eddy fan layout, but when you flip this machine,

[29:13] you're going to enjoy flipping this machine.

[29:15] Now, the visual wow of the Ellie, you know, you've got the demogorgon, the purple armor.

[29:21] How does this thing look when you walk into a game room?

[29:24] I gave it a seven out of 10.

[29:25] It's not the best playfield artwork.

[29:27] It's not the best cabinet artwork.

[29:29] It looks nice.

[29:30] I think a seven out of 10 is fair for this game.

[29:33] Now, how rare is Stranger Things, Ellie?

[29:36] It gets an eight out of 10.

[29:38] They only made 500 of these and mark my words, people, all of these stern

[29:44] Ellie's where there were only 500, you could just start there on like where to collect

[29:49] like Jurassic Park only has 500 Stranger Things, only 500.

[29:53] Now that they are making a thousand and they double the number of Ellie's,

[29:58] it's really hard for me to put any modern Ellie on a list as being something

[30:03] you should try to collect because there's just so many of them out there.

[30:06] So when it comes to rarity, knowing there's only 500, it gets an eight out of 10.

[30:11] Now, here's the thing.

[30:12] This is where it makes up a lot of points.

[30:14] Theme, nine out of 10.

[30:16] I mean it.

[30:16] This is Stranger Things.

[30:19] I think it's the most popular Netflix show of all time.

[30:23] It's perfect for the family.

[30:24] Who doesn't like Stranger Things?

[30:27] As a theme, this is a nine out of 10.

[30:30] Even though you don't have all the seasons, it doesn't matter.

[30:33] Once that Stranger Things music starts, it pulls you into this game and puts

[30:39] a smile on your face and I think that's why it gets a nine out of 10.

[30:43] The next category, does this pin have a good story and unique elements?

[30:47] Now, like I gave this a high score here.

[30:49] I gave this game a nine out of 10 when it comes to unique elements.

[30:53] We ragged on this game and the projector in it.

[30:56] We ragged on Stern for making people wait and buy the UV kit at a later date.

[31:01] It was a cash grab move by Stern.

[31:03] Okay, we got to forget all that.

[31:04] When you stand over a Stranger Things Ellie pinball machine in a dark game room,

[31:11] this thing does something much like Guns N' Roses does, like when you start a

[31:15] mode and you're in a song and you see all the lights.

[31:17] When you see this thing with the projector and when you go into the upside down

[31:22] with that UV kit, it has one of the most wow moments in all of modern pinball.

[31:28] And I think that's why this thing is going to become so collectible and in

[31:32] such high demand, it just does something really unique that we've never seen

[31:38] before in pinball and it executes it perfectly in a dark game room, not at CES,

[31:44] but that's why it gets a nine out of 10.

[31:46] And in terms of collector demand, I gave it an eight.

[31:49] Like collectors now want this thing.

[31:51] Collectors have now woken up and they have put Stranger Things as a game that is

[31:56] like really hard to find.

[31:58] And if I find an Ellie, I got to move quickly because I listened to that

[32:02] jackass, Kaneda all those years.

[32:04] He was ragging on it and I didn't move on one when it was 9,500.

[32:09] And now I might have to be spending like 18,000 to get one.

[32:12] Thank you, Kaneda.

[32:13] If I had not listened to you, I would have got one at MSRP.

[32:17] All right, so that's Stranger Things, Ellie, with a total score out of 60 of 49.

[32:22] All right, beating it by just one point.

[32:25] Number two on Kaneda's top 10 is Stern's Ghostbusters, Ellie.

[32:30] Now look, it's crazy that this finishes number two because when I go to gameplay

[32:34] and layout, it gets a five, right?

[32:37] This is one of the worst shooting games Stern has ever made.

[32:40] I'm not going to keep going on about it, but you know that with the flipper gap

[32:44] and the out lane issues and the shots are really tight, this thing is not

[32:49] enjoyable to play from a shooter's standpoint.

[32:52] I will fight anyone who thinks differently, but then visual.

[32:56] Wow.

[32:56] The green Ellie Slimer edition that Zombie Eddie did.

[33:00] Zombie Eddie's artwork on the play field.

[33:03] Zombie Eddie's translate.

[33:05] This game is a 10.

[33:07] When you walk up to a Ghostbusters, Ellie, it pops like nothing else.

[33:11] You know what I love about Zombie Eddie's art on the Ellie?

[33:14] He actually designed the artwork after they put on the lollipop rails.

[33:20] The slime is dripping down from the lollipop rails and it just looks amazing.

[33:24] And then you have this bright green pinball machine.

[33:27] I mean, think about how boring Godzilla Ellie is when you put it next to Ghostbusters.

[33:32] Ellie and then the bright colors.

[33:34] I feel like this is when he still had John Papadook in his head because all of the color

[33:38] palette on Ghostbusters is carried over from Magic Girl.

[33:43] And it looks so amazing.

[33:46] Probably one of the most stunning pinball machines of all time.

[33:49] And then when you go to Rarity, how rare is Ghostbusters, Ellie?

[33:52] There's only 500.

[33:54] It's very rare.

[33:55] It gets a nine out of 10.

[33:56] And then when you go to Theme, it's a 10.

[33:58] I mean, this might be the best theme of any pinball machine ever.

[34:02] You've got this game that like everybody loves Ghostbusters and you made the most beautiful

[34:06] pinball machine of all time.

[34:08] Even if you never play the crappy gameplay, it is like putting the most gorgeous Ghostbusters

[34:13] poster that you can play in your game room.

[34:17] And once that Ghostbusters theme song starts up, I mean, you just transport it to a whole

[34:21] another level of pinball fun.

[34:23] All right, when it comes to pin having unique elements and a great story, it gets a six.

[34:27] You know, there's nothing like super unique about it.

[34:29] It is the last DMD game from Stern pinball.

[34:33] So that is unique.

[34:34] But I also think people would have liked it if Stern had made this the first LCD game

[34:40] they made, but they didn't.

[34:41] They made Ghostbusters.

[34:43] So it gets a six out of 10.

[34:44] When it comes to collector demand, this game is a 10.

[34:48] Everybody wants one now.

[34:49] There is no way around it.

[34:51] Everybody wants a Ghostbusters, Ellie.

[34:53] If you have one, do me a favor, bolt it to the floor or ask $20,000.

[34:59] I'm looking for it because you will get it now unless Stern vaults this game and they

[35:04] might vault this game with an LCD.

[35:07] If they never vault this game, this game is going to keep going up and up in value.

[35:13] It is just one of the most beautiful pinball machines of all time.

[35:16] All right, coming in number one drum roll.

[35:19] And this just goes to show you people how underwhelming 2022 was because the number one

[35:25] game on our list came out the same year that Ghostbusters came out.

[35:30] Talk about a one to punch by Stern Pinball.

[35:33] And number one on the most collectible modern pin that is out there in the pinball world

[35:39] is Batman 66, both the Ellie and the SLE of this game.

[35:44] And you know the SLE takes it to a whole other level.

[35:46] Now look, how does Batman play from a gameplay standpoint?

[35:49] I gave it a six out of 10.

[35:51] It is not the best shooting game.

[35:53] It is clunky.

[35:54] It does have the fun crane mechanism.

[35:56] I love that mech in the game, but the shots in this game are not the best.

[36:01] So it gets a six out of 10.

[36:03] When it comes to visual wow, this was the greatest launch image in the history of Stern

[36:08] Pinball when they showed the SLE next to the Ellie next to the premium of this game with

[36:15] that bright Batman artwork and Christopher Franci just crushed it.

[36:20] The most visually wow game in Stern's history is a Christopher Franci Batman 66 game.

[36:27] When you stand over this machine and you see these games with the topper, with the lights,

[36:32] with all the bright colors, it is just a sexy work of art.

[36:37] It gets a 10 out of 10.

[36:39] When it comes to rarity, it also gets a 10 out of 10.

[36:42] This is when Stern actually made stuff limited.

[36:44] So here's how they did it.

[36:45] They made a 120LEs that were based on every single episode of Batman 66 because there

[36:52] was 120 total episodes.

[36:55] They then made a 120 based on each bat gadget.

[36:59] So there were 240LEs and then they made 80 SLEs and that was it to symbolize like the

[37:06] 30 years of Stern and the 50 years of the show.

[37:09] And that was it.

[37:10] And remember you had to like beg Stern with a video for a chance to buy it for $15,000.

[37:15] And so these things are rare.

[37:17] They rarely come up for sale.

[37:19] Someone's trying to sell a topper, just the topper for this thing for $6,800.

[37:24] So these are super rare games.

[37:26] When it comes to the pinball having unique elements and a great story, I give Batman

[37:31] a 9 out of 10.

[37:32] And here's why it gets a 9 out of 10.

[37:34] This is the last creative project that Adam West ever worked on.

[37:39] And it was amazing that right before he passed away, he worked on this game with Stern Pinball.

[37:44] He did callouts in the game.

[37:46] They made personalized callouts for all the SLE owners.

[37:50] It just captured a moment in Batman history like nothing else.

[37:55] The other thing is this.

[37:57] I would argue that this might be Lyman Sheets' greatest code of all time.

[38:02] I also think it is the best usage of a Stern LCD ever.

[38:07] You're never going to see Stern ever again.

[38:10] Theme integrate.

[38:11] These many assets into a single pinball machine.

[38:14] It took Lyman like 3 years to finish this game.

[38:18] But when he finished it, the theme integration on the code in this game is absolutely perfect.

[38:24] I've never played another pinball machine where you can enjoy what's on the screen and

[38:28] play the game at the same time without missing a beat.

[38:32] It is perfectly done.

[38:34] Lyman knew how to make the game approachable yet very deep because it has a lot of different

[38:38] pathways to go with all the minor villains and the major villains and the wizard modes.

[38:43] Even though I'm not the best pinball player in the world, I was able to see all that was

[38:47] in this game and it is incredible.

[38:50] It is absolutely incredible.

[38:52] And I think everyone out there feels the same way I do.

[38:55] We're never going to see a pinball machine ever code it as good as a Lyman Sheets game.

[39:01] And now that he's gone, you've got to add more value to the stuff he touched because

[39:07] you're never going to see Lonnie do with James Bond what Lyman Sheets did with Batman.

[39:11] And the final point I'll make is this.

[39:13] It's a capoe game.

[39:14] Joe Kamikaw worked on this with Stern Pinball.

[39:17] We thought we were going to see Kamikaw work on a lot with Stern.

[39:20] We haven't.

[39:21] He didn't even work on James Bond.

[39:22] I think that's another thing that makes this story unique.

[39:25] It is at one game that Joe Kamikaw and Stern Pinball really put together.

[39:30] So that is why when it comes to collector demand, just like Ghostbusters, it's a 10 out

[39:34] of 10.

[39:35] So coming in at number one is BatmanLE SLE with a total score out of 60 of 55.

[39:43] I hope you enjoyed this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[39:46] Thank you for staying with the show.

[39:48] Every month when we do the billing, we lose like 20 or so people.

[39:52] They usually come back.

[39:53] I think this was a really fun episode to do to just recap and go down the list.

[39:58] We've got Batman at number one, Stern's GhostbustersLE, Stranger Things, Pirate to the Caribbean,

[40:05] Guns N' Roses, Elvira, Medieval Madness Royal, Rick and Morty, Godzilla and the Big

[40:10] Lebowski.

[40:12] If you own any of these games, you're very lucky.

[40:15] If you own many of these games, you're even luckier.

[40:18] But look, this just goes to show you there's a lot of great pinball out there.

[40:22] And if you're starting your pinball collection, don't just go off of what I'm saying right

[40:25] now.

[40:26] Jump on a machine, play it, make sure you love it.

[40:29] Because even if the thing is beautiful, if you don't love playing it, it's never truly

[40:34] going to satisfy you.

[40:36] And I think the reason why these games are going to hold their value and keep going up,
