[00:00] [♪ INTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪

[00:15] Fine, people. I'll give you a podcast about stranger things rumors. I mean, I'm having lunch

[00:24] at the Capitol Grill in New York City and I'm looking at my Facebook messages and it says,

[00:30] you haven't talked about the rumored things that are going to be in the stranger things,

[00:36] Pimball Machine, Canada, and here's why, because I don't care until we actually get to see something

[00:45] with stranger things, the worst cap rumor and Pimball. So here I am. I also got a Facebook

[00:52] message from someone who works at Stern Pimball. Yes, they work at Stern Pimball and they said,

[00:59] Chris, I'm here to confirm with you that stranger things will be revealed on Monday, December 23rd.

[01:10] Okay? So for all of you out there tapping Canada on the back for a Pimball podcast to talk about

[01:19] stranger things, can we just wait a few days until we actually have a game to look at? But you

[01:28] know what? I'm here to oblige you guys who can't go a few days without an episode of Canada's

[01:34] Pimball Podcast. So we're going to talk about the rumored features in Stranger Things on this

[01:40] podcast of Canada's Pimball Podcast. But before I do that, I also want to talk about Puni, Puni,

[01:48] whichever freaking way you pronounce it, Puni Pimball and why I have not done any feedback or opinions

[01:58] or given any insight into how I feel about the new company from that guy that was making the Pimball

[02:06] book with Todd Tuckie. And I'm going to be real short on this and I'm going to be completely honest

[02:10] and transparent. And as Candid, maybe as I've ever been on this podcast, what do they say about

[02:17] good artwork? What do they say about getting a reaction from people? Is that anything that elicits

[02:25] a response from people both good or bad? That's art. You're either going to like it or you're not.

[02:30] And it's going to give you some sort of response. And I'll tell you this. In my four or five years

[02:38] covering the Pimball hobby, nothing. And I mean, nothing has made me feel more dead inside

[02:47] than Puni Pimball or Puni Pimball. I have no I have no feelings on it. I think it's stupid. I

[02:55] think it makes no sense. And when I read the story of how this company came to light,

[03:02] and this guy listened to team Pimball, the mafia people's seminar and said, those are my dudes.

[03:10] Those dudes couldn't even sell 10 machines. And you pick them like Romain or whatever Romain,

[03:16] whatever his name is. And then you look at this game in the midst of everything happening in Pimball,

[03:22] Rick and Morty, stranger things, Ninja Turtles, Willy Wonka, Jurassic Park, Batman, Star Trek.

[03:29] You know, all these things coming out, Toy Story, Guns in Freakin' Roses, and you want to put

[03:34] that out in the world? I have no opinions about it. I don't care. It's not real to me. It's a nightmare

[03:43] to wake up and look at that game out in existence. And this guy's commentary. He doesn't care if he

[03:49] sells one of them in the buyer's happy. He's content. And then he says like, if games three or four

[03:55] are successful, then he'll be happy. You know what? Honestly, let's all collectively stand up

[04:02] and tell this company, GTFO, get the F outy here with this crap. Crap! Who's buying this crap?

[04:12] Nobody. Nobody. And the fact that he hitched his wagon to these guys who made a game that is the

[04:18] biggest Pimball failure in the last 15 freaking years, I'm done. I'm never gonna talk about this

[04:26] company again in all their stupid themes. I'm sorry. It's not worth my time. I don't understand.

[04:32] I really don't understand. I was gonna have Dave Sanders on to talk about it. I know he worked on

[04:36] this with them. Nothing to say. You know, it's like when a Pimball makes you feel dead inside like

[04:44] that. What are you supposed to talk about? We're done. We're done with that. All right. Let's talk

[04:49] about stranger things. The worst kept secret in Pimball. What do I want to do on this episode?

[04:57] Okay. Here's a deal. Here's a deal. Let's talk about the fact that it's confirmed that December,

[05:02] December 23rd is the date. Okay. So that's Monday. We got Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Monday,

[05:08] we're gonna see it. Okay. So this podcast is gonna be garbage come Monday because we're gonna have

[05:13] the actual game to look at. But because you people want another episode of Canadian Pimball podcast

[05:19] before then. Here we go. These are the rumors happening with the game. The layout design is by Brian

[05:26] Eddie. It is coded by Lonnie and Mike. Now Lonnie being the coder of stranger things I think has

[05:34] people nervous. Now Lonnie did Guardians of the Galaxy and he did Aerosmith. He's not exactly

[05:43] sterns like, you know, home run coder. And this is a home run theme for stern. So what will Lonnie do

[05:51] with this game? I don't know. But Lonnie is the coder of the game now. The artwork is based on

[05:58] Netflix illustration style artwork. Now I think that makes people feel happy because if you Google

[06:04] Amant Search, stranger things, all the Netflix art is really dope. Now I do hope that stern does

[06:11] something more interesting than just dropping the existing stranger things artwork onto a Pimball

[06:19] game. So we'll see. I don't know. I have not talked to anybody who's seen the art. I heard it's

[06:23] okay. I heard the arts fine. It's a fan layout. Okay. What does that mean? Fan layout. Like as if

[06:30] there's like layouts and Pimball that are not for fans of Pimball. I hate this phrase. But I

[06:37] think what fan layout means is there's two flippers and and you have shots that go up the playfield.

[06:44] Like two ramps, but there's more than two ramps. I don't know. Here's what I heard from someone who's

[06:48] played the game. A major person in the industry who's played the game. He said Chris, the layout

[06:55] of this game is very similar. Wait for it. It's very similar to attack from Mars and medieval madness.

[07:05] All right. Made both by Brian Eddie. So shocking. Brian Eddie designed another game that is

[07:12] laid out like other Brian Eddie games. The same way every John Borgame is every John Borgame

[07:18] and every Gomez game is every Joe. You know, it's like these designers. They make me laugh because

[07:24] they have their design philosophy. So it's a fan layout. That's fine. Okay. So fan layout. What else

[07:32] we got? All right. We have flow. I love that. That's like a bullet point. Progression and shot

[07:38] balance is designed to feel like medieval madness and attack from Mars. All right. So we get to toys.

[07:45] Here are the toys we're hearing about. There is a demo Gorgon head bash toy up the center with

[07:53] drop targets in front. Okay. Supposed to be Hawking's lab with the portal to the upside down.

[08:03] There is a projector under the apron that transforms play field objects. So ramps, stand-ups,

[08:13] drops and other elements on the play field changed based on the location in the mode you're playing.

[08:21] So upside down, wills house, wherever there are even scoring elements projected onto things like

[08:30] numbers on drop targets. Okay. Now, this is the big thing. This is the big question mark because the

[08:38] person I talked to who played this game, they played the pro version of the game. And let me tell

[08:44] you right now, I don't think that this projector upside down thing in Majiggy is on the pro version

[08:52] of the game because they said to me that they did not experience this on the game they played.

[08:58] And that if Stern is successful in executing this element in the game, it will be a game changer

[09:08] and a new type of innovation that we've never seen before in Pimbal. Okay. So I've got that person

[09:15] telling me that. Now, I have another person who's very, very, very embroiled in Stern and is very

[09:21] close to everything who's played this game as well and told me that I would have a field day with

[09:27] this game, both good and bad. And that some stuff works and some stuff just doesn't work and it's

[09:32] going to give me a ton of content for my show. So it leads me to believe that the major element

[09:38] of this game that is up in the air is whether or not the execution of this projectile imagery or

[09:47] this projector that's supposed to create the upside down world in this game. This is the big

[09:54] question mark. Ken Stern nailed this. Does it work? Will it work in all types of lighting?

[10:02] Will it work if you have bright overhead lighting in your game room? Will it work on location?

[10:08] Will it work if you have pin stadium lights in your game? Probably not. Here's the other part

[10:13] that I heard and I'm not sure this is the way it's going to work. I know they were experimenting.

[10:18] This is crazy. They were experimenting with a projector that would shine on the glass of the game

[10:26] and that there would be a sort of like a filter or some sort of filter substance on the underside

[10:33] of the pinball glass that when the projector hit it, it would create the illusion of the upside

[10:41] down world for the person who's standing over the game looking down onto the play field.

[10:47] Now look, nobody, nobody and I've talked to many people. Nobody can quite articulate what this whole

[10:54] thing is. We're going to have to see it. This is going to be one of those pinball machines where it's

[10:59] not just like there's a slimer that moves around or there's a black knight toy with a flail in a

[11:04] shield or you've got Groot up the middle whose mouth opens up and that's where you lock multiballs.

[11:10] Now the major feature of this game is a new type of technology or new use of technology. We've never

[11:19] really seen before in pinball and whether or not it works and is effective. I think that's going

[11:26] to be what this entire game is riding on and I'm excited to see what it is, right? I don't know

[11:34] about you but I'm so sick and tired of reading people post about this, hearing podcasts, talk about

[11:42] it. Let's just see it. Let's just see how they execute this and if it actually adds to the experience

[11:49] of pinball. Now the reason why I kind of feel like it's going to be a miss is because of the guy

[11:55] that I trust who played the game. I don't feel like he would have told me what he told me if this

[12:01] thing was an executional home run and the other thing I've heard from people over at Stern

[12:08] that have played the next few Stern machines is very simply this. I've universally heard from people

[12:15] that I know that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game is the one that this is not the one. That

[12:21] stranger things is not the big game coming from Stern that's going to showcase what this company

[12:27] can do. I keep hearing it's Ninja Turtles. They don't want you to hear this. Distributors don't

[12:32] want you to hear that but I am hearing that this is the okay next game but the real game that you're

[12:40] going to want is Ninja Turtles with Zambiyeti and John Borg and an internet connectivity and ramps

[12:47] that you can control the direction of the ball. A lot is coming. A lot is coming with Ninja Turtles

[12:52] and I kind of feel like stranger things might be like Ghostbusters and what I mean by that is the

[12:58] new Stern platform. The new thing they're going to switch over to I think Ninja Turtles is going to

[13:04] be the first game that has the new sort of operating system with with Stern Pimball and it's not going

[13:09] to be stranger things. Remember when Ghostbusters came out and it was like it was like the game right

[13:14] before they went to the LCD screen. It's like why didn't you go LCD with Ghostbusters okay. All right but

[13:20] that's not all we're hearing about stranger things. Let's keep going. I'm hearing there are let's

[13:25] see there's upside down is random hurry up mode. One of the kids flips into the upside down and you

[13:33] need to hit shots to bring them back. Okay and then gameplay. Half a dozen multi ball modes. Three

[13:41] staging areas to hold the ball. 40 plus modes designed for longevity in the home. That's such a

[13:49] weird way to freeze it. Do you think Stern Pimball would be like this is for longevity in the home.

[13:54] That just sounds really cheesy. All right. All right and then when it comes to premium LE there's a

[14:00] telekinesis ball lock up the left ramp. Multiple balls can stick to the backboard via magnet like 11

[14:11] pinning the demogorgon to the wall and the demogorgon toy will move with the premium and LE.

[14:18] See when I read these features it sounds like the projector is also part of the pro but when I

[14:23] talk to my boy he mentioned nothing about experiencing that in the game. So I don't know what I don't

[14:30] know what to tell you guys. I really don't know what to tell you guys other than Monday is going

[14:36] to be the day in which all of our questions aren't answered. Now if I were a betting man see maybe

[14:45] I'm being set up right maybe this is the most like oh my god game of all time and the people

[14:50] close to it are just trying to troll me and tell me that this isn't the end all be all but I got

[14:58] I got to tell you I've heard from multiple people that I really trust that are close to this project

[15:05] and other Stern games coming and I just keep hearing this isn't the one. This isn't the one to go

[15:10] all in on and get like excited about because it's not going to deliver what people think. Now I

[15:17] don't know if they're again if they're trolling me or if this game is going to introduce this

[15:22] phenomenally new way to like experience pinball here's what I think is going to happen this is just

[15:27] me this is just me guessing I think this game is going to to try and do something ambitious. I

[15:36] think it's going to try to do something overly ambitious. I think Brian Eddie knows that there's

[15:41] tremendous pressure on him to create a mechanism or magic or world under glass that is reflective of

[15:50] his previous pinball classic titles and I don't know you know if if that pressure is going to lead him

[16:01] over reach in what's possible in pinball because here's the problem with pinball is it still needs

[16:07] to be physical and when I hear about it being like a projector and hitting project it like images

[16:14] I don't know if that's going to be satisfying there's just you know pin 2k was not satisfying like

[16:20] hitting those digitally projected targets on the play field was just never satisfying it was

[16:26] always more satisfying to hit physical targets the castle and medieval madness so satisfying

[16:33] because it's physical you know the the spaceship and getting into it in an attack from Mars it's so

[16:38] satisfying like lowering those drop targets and hitting the ship you know so I don't know I don't

[16:44] know what this is going to be but I do worry that it's going to reach too far try to do something

[16:51] never done before and it might just be unfulfilling in terms of a pinball experience now look you

[16:59] take it for what it's worth these episodes to me these are the ones I always never want to do because

[17:07] I just don't understand why we're all not just waiting to see what happens here because we're

[17:13] going to find all the answers out real soon okay I think a better use of your time over the next

[17:20] like few days is not to speculate on stranger things it's not to go on pin side and and try

[17:27] and ask people why they did or did not buy Rick and Morty I think a good use of your time

[17:33] tomorrow and into Saturday is to hop on to the special win lit project pinball fundraiser that they

[17:41] are doing to me that is the most exciting thing going on in pinball over the next 48 hours yes we

[17:48] will learn about stranger things on Monday but please join can and bill and all the amazing people

[17:56] that are going to raise as much money as possible for project pinball the check for 30 500 hours from

[18:02] my big Lebowski is going to go to that cause which is doubled by Adam Schwartz in New York City so

[18:08] that's a $7,000 donation alone just from the big Lebowski sale let's do that this weekend let's

[18:16] all enjoy the weekend before the holidays with our friends and family and let's get ready to geek

[18:23] out over stranger things pinball on Monday for me the main question on my mind when I see this

[18:30] machine yes I'm excited to see the layout I'm excited to see the toys in it my main the main

[18:38] thing I'm looking at does it sound like I'm losing my voice because I think I am sorry guys the

[18:43] main thing I'm looking for is I want to see what the assets in the game are I'm really curious

[18:50] if we're going to see clips from the show with synced up voice from the actors in the show if

[18:57] we're going to get music beyond just a theme song in the game and I'm just I'm just curious like

[19:04] are the modes going to be reflective of the scenes in the show or are they going to be more

[19:09] Jurassic Park like where it's animated stuff inspired by scenes from the show because I think

[19:17] stranger things to me is going to be indicative of what direction stern pinball is going and moving

[19:24] forward but it doesn't matter you know I tell this to someone the other day of like it doesn't

[19:27] matter stern has stranger things pinball they're going to sell like 5,000 of these things easily

[19:36] this property is so hot and then they're going to sell Ninja Turtles and they're going to sell

[19:41] Jurassic Park and they're going to keep going stern pinball is without a doubt a a jug or not

[19:49] freight train that can't be stopped you know absolutely like stern is going to sell more stranger

[19:55] things in a month than the total numbers of Rick and Morty machines that will be made over 18 months

[20:02] okay like let's not even let's not even try and compare what Rick and Morty has done then

[20:10] what stern is going to do you know I saw people being like well stern must really be kicking

[20:14] themselves that spooky pinball sold 750 games in four hours they don't care at all they don't

[20:21] they really don't because in those four hours stern pinball went and made like another 25 games

[20:30] in just that amount of time and and they're making games every day the line doesn't stop the line

[20:35] does not stop all right what's on the line right now at American pinball what what are they making

[20:41] right now even spooky pinball like they're they're just ending up with Alice Cooper they're going to

[20:47] make 10 games a week to small operation it it's a mom and pop it's a small business and that's fine

[20:53] I mean I love that about spooky you know I'll say this I feel good I feel really good about buying

[21:00] from spooky pinball I'm excited to get a Rick and Morty machine I did just something about buying

[21:06] for spooky pinball just makes me feel better inside than buying a stern game now that doesn't mean

[21:13] I think the games are better than stern games I'm not saying that stern is just a huge company

[21:19] they're a huge company the distance between stern executive and the fan base of pinball is so far

[21:27] in my mind like they don't care they're not engaged with us now we're the diehards we're the

[21:32] enthusiast it's stern doesn't even care I'm gonna say this we're not their primary target

[21:40] they know that losers like us that listen to podcasts every week that are on pinside for hours

[21:49] they know we're gonna buy their games they don't need to engage with us

[21:55] Charlie needs to engage with us and Chuck needs to engage they're the same person by the way

[21:59] spooky pinball engages with us because they can sell every single one of their games to just the

[22:06] enthusiast base stern can't only sell to people like us they need to find new buyers and they do

[22:14] they do but they also have more money when it comes to marketing and distribution and and

[22:21] productivity right I mean imaginative stern bimbal was making stranger things at the pace that

[22:29] spooky pinball was making a game they couldn't go out there what happens if you get 5,000 people

[22:33] who want to stranger things game imagine that imaginative spooky pinball got an order for 5,000

[22:40] games right for you know you know how long that would take this is I'm not even making this up

[22:45] for spooky pinball to make 5,000 games at their current rate of manufacturing this is going to

[22:53] make some of you it would take 10 years no 10 years for spooky pinball to fulfill 5,000 orders but

[23:01] you know what they're totally different companies I love that we have spooky I love what they're doing

[23:06] I love Rick and Morty I love the theme for pinball I love stranger things I love the stranger things

[23:13] show I hope stern figures out how to make this stranger things game a home run I'm just hearing

[23:20] that it's not that now all answers will be settled on Monday and then I don't love puny pinball

[23:26] puny pinball I just don't understand that I don't understand like making a pinball company with

[23:32] people that have never made a successful pinball game and then telling us that you don't really care

[23:37] if you sell them to me that's just like that's a lack of intelligence it's a lack of direction it's

[23:43] a lack of market research everything it's stupid it's not I'm not even gonna cover them it's stupid

[23:50] all right all right everybody you got you got an episode you got canada with a horse voice

[23:56] who's now going to this one I'm gonna go do it's 336 on a Thursday I should be at

[24:02] work but I took off the second half of the day to go wait online to see rise the rise of skywalker

[24:10] the new Star Wars movie that is getting panned panned by the media unfortunate for me and my crew

[24:18] we got tickets at the RDX 40X wherever the hell the crappy thing is with the seats move and the

[24:23] smoke but they're not reserved seating so I have to go line up early on a movie that I know is

[24:29] gonna suck man I don't envy me right now all right everybody thank you for putting up for this

[24:36] show this is like a way like I'm really dying here today but I just hope you remember this that

[24:42] that that canada is going to get you a show to talk about this stuff when he when he's really a

[24:48] little under the weather I mean come on I'm dedicated to this all right the world's most super awesome

[24:54] pinball podcast that you deserve ladies and gentlemen we'll talk to you real soon we're going to talk

[24:59] a lot more on Monday when we see stranger things I'm not going to do a show over the weekend there's

[25:04] no new news there's no new news hopefully all of you who bought Rick and Morty hopefully you know

[25:10] what number you are by the weekend that's going to be a whole another thing that happens when

[25:17] everyone who ordered their blood sucker who thinks their games going to be made first realizes that

[25:22] number 573 blood sucker you're not first Johnny Boy have a good day
