[00:00] I don't know about the rest of you out there, but I know it's really hard to get all

[00:20] of your work done in a day and to focus on your day job when Stern Pimball decides to

[00:27] release a brand new Pimball machine in the middle of the workday, but I have to say, for

[00:33] many of us out there, today was the culmination of so many weeks and weeks and weeks of speculating

[00:41] and wondering what would the Munsters Pimball machine, probably the worst kept secret in all

[00:48] of Pimball, what would the game be like? And we saw it today at CES in Las Vegas, and

[00:55] I want to just give my impressions of the game and the reveal that Stern pulled off at CES,

[01:01] and it's just going to be a short little podcast. We will, of course, talk more about this

[01:06] game in the weeks and days to come, but I want to just sort of zoom out a little bit and

[01:13] just start this podcast by saying, wow, I think it was a really good reveal, and I'm really

[01:21] happy for a few reasons. I'm happy that Stern showed us all three titles on the same day. So this

[01:28] was not going to be another case in which we just saw the pro machine and people who were going to

[01:33] buy the premium and the L leaves were going to have to guess about what it was going to be,

[01:37] especially for those L-E guys, they actually got to see the full game that they are going to be

[01:42] either ordering or passing on from their distributor. So I love the fact that Stern showed us all three

[01:49] models of the game. I love the fact that Stern had video of the game ready to go. I love the fact

[01:56] that Stern had the game matrix. I love the fact that Stern had high-res images of the game itself,

[02:03] very, very awesome high-res images that were put up on Stern's social channels pretty much

[02:11] immediately when the game went live. So I think as far as a reveal can go, and showing us this game,

[02:18] I give Stern and its marketing team amazing kudos for doing it this way. I think it was great that it

[02:25] was at CES. I also love the fact that Jack Danger dressed up as Herman Munster and Gary Stern was

[02:33] grandpa, and I believe it was Zach as Eddie Munster. It just goes to show that this company is really

[02:43] passionate about this title, and that they are very excited to pull the curtain off this title at CES.

[02:49] And so from just a pure release of the game, I think they did a really, really good job.

[02:56] And I'm thankful that and you all should be thankful that we got to see the game in Living Caller,

[03:03] no pun intended with the Black and White edition all day long, and that the dead flip stream that

[03:09] Jack put up was pretty much running for hours, and I don't know about the rest of you, but it got to

[03:14] the point where I almost just had overload of the Munster's music and the sound effects and the

[03:20] call outs where I was just like I couldn't take it anymore. Is that an indication of what it will

[03:25] be like to own the game? I don't think so. I really don't think so because it's one thing to be playing

[03:31] a pinball machine and enjoying it, but there's only so much you can watch of a pinball machine being

[03:36] streamed over and over and over again. So what are my just overall impressions of the game?

[03:44] I am going to say that I think this is one of the nicest stern packages they've released

[03:52] in years, and I mean that when I say it, and I've said this before, I really think stern is going

[03:58] to start firing on all cylinders, and as I look at this game and I'm staring at it right now,

[04:06] you can't tell me that stern isn't putting a lot into this game. And again,

[04:14] compared to other sterns recently, let's compare it to Deadpool, let's compare it to Iron Maiden,

[04:20] let's compare it to Star Wars, this game looks leagues above other games that stern has brought out

[04:29] recently, and I'm not again, I'm not comparing it to other manufacturers. I'm just saying as a stern

[04:34] release, I think this is one of the most impressive stern releases in years, and you could agree or

[04:40] disagree, okay? Now, all of the attention I think fell on two areas of this release, and I've

[04:49] been reading Pinside, you know I'm on there, you know I'm reading, I'm lurking, I'm lurking,

[04:53] like spot under the stairs on Pinside. The majority of the conversation was about the Black and

[05:00] White Premium Edition, and about the lower playfield in the game, and I want to tackle it in that

[05:08] order. What do I think of the Black and White edition of the Monster's Premium Pimble? I have to say,

[05:16] I don't quite understand Stern's marketing strategy with the Black and White, and putting it on

[05:25] the premium, and I've said this before, I think if you're going to make a drastic and very unique

[05:33] design decision, an art package decision like this is, and this is drastic. We have never seen

[05:41] a company do this where they've offered a completely gray scale Black and White

[05:47] variation of the game alongside a full color version. Now, it absolutely makes sense that they did

[05:55] this because the show was in Black and White, but putting it on the premium was bound to be controversial,

[06:05] because if you think about it from a marketing standpoint, why does this make sense? Here's why I

[06:10] don't think it quite makes sense to put the Black and White on the premium, because I think

[06:16] that if you're only making 500 monsters, Pimball machines, and you have packed the game the way you've

[06:24] packed this game, and 250 of those machines are going to go overseas, and 250 of those games are going

[06:31] to be in the United States, I think you're going to sell out of a game this packed based on an

[06:39] nostalgic theme like the monsters, I think you're going to sell out if you make a Black and White

[06:45] version of it as an Ellie, and I think it also would have made sense to give the Ellie guys the

[06:52] truly limited version of the game. Instead, they've done something really interesting, and I agree,

[07:01] it's very debatable whether or not it was the right move, because now they have given the Ellie

[07:08] owners the full vibrant Frenchy-color palette version, sorry, palette version of the game,

[07:15] and the pro people get the full vibrant Frenchy-color version of the game, and the premium owners,

[07:22] they're the ones who have to either like or dislike the Black and White, and I think that creates

[07:30] a real dilemma, and I've read on Pinside people who love the Black and White, rare hero, and I've

[07:38] read people who can't stand it, and so you, I think we can all agree that the Black and White version

[07:44] of the game is very polarizing, and it's not completely Black and White, right? The inserts are still

[07:50] colorized, and another interesting design decision there, right? Why didn't they make the inserts

[07:57] clear or white and just have them change with color changing, you know, RGB lights,

[08:05] because it's not, it's, it's, it's sort of like an amalgamation of halfway there by being

[08:10] completely Black and White. Now, I'll say this, again, my personal opinion is I think it looks cool,

[08:17] I do, I think it looks cool, and I think it looks unique, but do I think it looks better than the

[08:25] Ellie colored, you know, fully populated playfield, and the answer is I don't, and, and it doesn't

[08:34] mean I don't like the Black and White, I just think you see much more of the detail in Franci's

[08:41] artwork when it's in full color, and so this debate will not be settled on this podcast, this

[08:50] debate will rage on for weeks to come, and now the question becomes, and people have been speculating

[08:58] this, will Stern listen to the feedback and then offer a color version of the premium machine

[09:08] for people, and if they're going to do that, they're going to have to do that before, and I

[09:17] believe this, they're going to have to do that before they lock people into the Black and White,

[09:24] and send people Black and White versions of the premium, because here's what I think will be a

[09:30] marketing disaster for Stern, is if they sell people the Black and White premiums during a time

[09:38] in which people could only order Black and White, and then at a later date, they offer you a color

[09:44] version of the premium, that won't that piss off people who would, may have preferred the color

[09:52] version, but were locked in to only be able to buy the, buy the Black and White when they had a,

[09:58] you know, pay for the game, so I, look, I like that Stern is taking a, a, a, a real chance here,

[10:06] I do, I think it's a huge risk, and I, I think it's really strange that they didn't make the

[10:14] Ellie, the Black and White, and that's just my overall feelings about the whole thing, and if we go

[10:20] back to the leaked images originally, we know that Christopher Fransche was planning to make the

[10:30] coffin, the Ellie version of the game, so someone made a decision to switch it, and we will see how

[10:39] it plays out, there, there is, there is again, there is going to be a lot of debate around that

[10:45] decision. Now, the other thing that was talked about a lot was the lower play field, and I have to say,

[10:53] it's pretty freaking cool, I, I, I, I, like, I've been following Pimbo long enough, and I've seen

[10:58] enough, you know, upper play fields, lower play fields, Stewie Pimball, ACDCs, lower play field,

[11:04] Big Lebowski's bowling alley, this lower play field has a ramp, has, has, has a, has a, a

[11:11] wire form, has a vertical upkick, has a bash toy, has a, has a freaking multi-ball in it, and,

[11:18] and I can't believe, I can't believe when I was on Pinside, and I heard people complaining about

[11:24] that lower play field, it, it literally blows my mind. When, when I start reading people complain

[11:30] about everything that's starting put into that lower play field, it really almost depresses me,

[11:37] because it, it, it, it makes me feel like, are you not satisfied with, with, with anything?

[11:45] Those people who complain about that, I just feel like, Stern can never win in those people's

[11:50] eyes, because this is a really awesome lower play field. It's not a rehash of Stewie Pimball,

[11:57] it's not a copy of, of ACDC, I've never seen a lower play field like this, have you? Has anyone

[12:04] else? Am I, am I missing something here? Um, and so let's see how it plays, but I, I, I,

[12:10] I will say this, I've always thought that when you do a lower play field or an upper play field,

[12:17] the right way, it's always a really fun thing for casual players to enjoy in a Pimball machine.

[12:24] I always think that people who hate these things are more of the diehard, enthusiast players,

[12:30] but I'm glad it's there. It's something very visually interesting to look at, and it's something

[12:36] very inviting, and when, and you know me, when I talk about the world under glass, I like seeing

[12:42] something like grandpa's, you know, laboratory underneath there, and it, it's got all that stuff

[12:49] going on, and I love the light show that happens when you enter it, and it's got the countdown

[12:53] clock. I saw a lot of people were saying Stern stole that from Scott Dinesi in TNA, as Scott

[12:59] Dinesi didn't invent a countdown clock. It is a little weird that that countdown clock is not

[13:05] flush with the play field, the way it is in total nuclear annihilation, not really sure why it's

[13:11] sitting, you know, about a quarter inch lower than the actual play field itself. If you take a look,

[13:16] you'll notice that, all minor things. But how can you not be happy with the lower play field that's

[13:24] in the game? I mean, I think it looks great. I've heard people complain, it's same old fan layout,

[13:30] two ramps, two orbits, and you know, two, you know, like a bash toy and a magnet, like what?

[13:37] Okay, like what? Sometimes I think people are just really stupid in this hobby, and I think they,

[13:45] they want to absolutely blow up the any elements that fans enjoy shooting in a pinball machine,

[13:50] and just have some radically new design that is going to just blow everyone away. And as if the

[13:56] designers over at Stern Pinball have no clue how to make a game fresh and interesting, and it's

[14:02] just the same recycled crap. I'm sorry, but I look at, I look at the monsters, and I'm not seeing

[14:09] like same old recycled crap. It feels like the monster's world being brought to life under glass.

[14:17] It looks phenomenal. All right, I want to just give a shout out to the one and only Christopher

[14:24] Franci because I think he has given us one of the most beautiful pinball machines I've seen. And

[14:31] I do think this is his nicest work to date by far. And I say that because I'm looking at it right

[14:39] now, and I'm standing over my Batman 66, and I will say this, this blows even Batman away. And I

[14:48] know how big of a Batman fan he is, but again, remember, he didn't have as much time with Batman,

[14:52] and the reason why I think this just blows it away even there's so much more detail in this.

[14:59] And I think in Batman, you know, he had to drop his Batman figures over a much more simple

[15:06] background. It still works great. And Batman still looks phenomenal. Don't get me wrong.

[15:12] I think this is just Franci on crack in a good way. It's like Franci won't level up from what we've

[15:19] had before. And I really, really think his art style complements the monsters iconography so

[15:27] perfectly well. And so I think from a visual standpoint, can we all just like for a moment say

[15:33] Christopher Franci just knocked it out of the park now in terms of which cabinets I like,

[15:38] they're all really nice. I have no issues with any of them. And not just like an overall thing,

[15:43] like as I come out of this game and looking at all three options, I think they all look really nice.

[15:48] I mean, I do like the black and white with the green monsters. I think if I had that,

[15:53] I'm wondering if it would look good with green armor to make it pop, but I think that might take

[15:59] away from what I love so much about it is that black and white look. The Ellie, they've obviously

[16:06] colored in what was the leaked image of the cabinet that we had before. They colored in the characters.

[16:13] And this coffin look is really, really cool. There's only one thing I'm trying, like I'm just trying

[16:19] to make sense of and like maybe this is just me, but the leagues on the game are this like

[16:26] mustardy gold color. And yet the armor on the game itself in terms of the lockdown bar and the

[16:35] side rail armor and the most of the, I always like the bracket that holds up the back box. Sorry,

[16:43] I'm, I mean, it's late at night. I'm tired. Those things are black. And you've got this sort of

[16:51] laser etched web design black. And I'm not sure I love that. I like it when the color of the

[16:58] legs and the and the lockdown bar match. But it's, it kind of works here. It kind of works.

[17:05] Just haven't really seen stern breakup. Those two colors before. You know, I'm not going to go over

[17:10] all the different artistic things going on in the game. You guys have seen the photos. I think

[17:14] that will be boring. Is the Ellie worth it? Let's talk about that for a minute. So the Ellie

[17:20] 500 units is it's $9,000. So we did not see a price increase in the game. Now,

[17:28] the Ellie game comes with a black wrinkle laser cut spider web armor with gold insert and gold

[17:38] metallic legs, shaker motor, high definition anti reflection glass, high definition speaker system

[17:45] with three channel amplifier, limited edition exclusive art blades, limited edition mirrored

[17:52] back glass with stunning and distinctive hand drawn art. I love when stern adds that kind of

[17:58] shit. Like just stern stern marketing. Sometimes I'm like, come on guys, the limited feature is that

[18:04] you get mirrored back glass with unique art, right? When stunning and distinctive, like, come on,

[18:11] though that that is ridiculous jargon. It's like when stern says there are lifestyle brand.

[18:17] Whenever I read a stern press release and like stern is a lifestyle brand, no, you're not a

[18:22] lifestyle brand. You're a fucking pinball company. You're not a lifestyle. It doesn't make any

[18:26] fucking sense. Like, come on, who are you fooling? It's not like, hey man, what's your lifestyle? My

[18:32] lifestyle's pinball. Like, well, I guess for some people, but that's a really sad thing to admit.

[18:37] Anyway, so you also get exclusive custom casket themed cabinet artwork. And then you get like the

[18:44] cheap stuff. This here lies number plate, the autograph from John Borg, the autograph,

[18:51] the certificate of authenticity from Gary Stern and production limited to 500 machines.

[18:58] Now, I didn't notice that John Borg does not sign the play field. And I would always prefer

[19:05] that the LEDs are signed on the play field and not on the apron card. I don't know why they do

[19:12] that. Possibly, it's easier for stern to replace a play field if they don't have the signatures

[19:20] on the actual play fields themselves. If anything ever happens or you just swap out, it's just

[19:26] easier to do that. All right, what else is going on? So another question I have, because there are

[19:30] four flipper buttons. And why are there four flipper buttons? The lower buttons control the

[19:36] mini play field flippers and the top ones control the regular ones. This leads me to believe that this

[19:42] game will have a multi-ball in which you will be able to control both the upper and lower play fields

[19:51] at the same time. To me, that is the only thing that would make sense to warrant having four

[19:59] buttons like that. And I think it would be really cool if that was an option. Now, we also got to see

[20:04] the game in play. And we got to see the code on the screen. And I don't, again, I implore you guys to

[20:13] go watch Dead Flip and see it. It was on for hours. Again, hours to the point that I was just so tired

[20:21] of watching people play. And that's the thing, too. It's always really hard to understand,

[20:28] whether or not you'll like a game or not. But I'll say this, based upon the stream itself,

[20:33] I think the music, the callouts, the sound effects are awesome. I think they're really fun and

[20:41] kooky and I think they're perfect for pinball. I do think that monsters are really fun theme for a

[20:46] pinball machine. I will say that I did feel like the clips on the screen. And again, this is coming from

[20:53] someone who's so used to watching Batman 66 and the way it's coded. I did feel like there was

[21:00] a lot of jumping around to clips. And it did feel like a little bit of like in LCD salad where I

[21:07] just kept getting served up new things like so quickly. And it was like breaking up a lot. I hope

[21:12] it's not as choppy. But I'll, I will say that Dwight has learned his lesson from Star Wars. And

[21:19] there's just less going on in general. And it's, it's simpler. And I think that's important. And I

[21:27] love the fact that they have access to all the monsters clips, all the voice actors from the show.

[21:33] You know, this isn't a theme integration where we're without the imagery and the visuals and the

[21:40] sounds of the people that come from the show itself. So well done there. I do love something that

[21:46] they did. And they had, they had to make a choice. When you listen to the clips from the show,

[21:52] you will hear the laugh track from the TV show itself. And the reason why, and Stern told us why,

[22:01] is because it's a mono audio track from the show itself. So the laugh track was actually,

[22:07] you know, on top of the show audio, and you couldn't separate them. If they were to separate them,

[22:14] they would have had to have re-recorded all of the callouts from the actors on the show. And that

[22:21] would have been terrible. I've never seen a pinball game that's ever had a laugh track from a TV show,

[22:28] like incorporated into the gameplay. And I have to say, it's really cool because I think it sounds

[22:35] like you're playing through the show itself. And you're almost like playing a sitcom via a pinball

[22:41] machine. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But I actually found it to be quite hilarious.

[22:48] And I think it adds to the jokes. The only thing I could hope for or wish for is that

[22:54] they could add in one of the code updates, the Marty and Ryan laugh track as one of the

[23:01] added laugh tracks into the game. And it would make sense. It would incorporate in perfectly. And

[23:06] you might not even notice it. It was there. Anything else around this reveal. I mean, look,

[23:14] I just want to say that I think Stern is continuing to raise the bar. That being said,

[23:23] we all hope that this game has the quality control that we're looking for in the game.

[23:29] Because the more they put into the game, the more chances are things can go wrong. But if you

[23:35] look at John Bork, he typically uses similar mechanisms in a variety of his games. And that's just

[23:42] a good thing because it means things are tried and tested more. Look at the troubles we had with

[23:49] Iron Maiden with all new mechanisms that Stern designed. So hopefully this game is not going to

[23:56] suffer from any quality control issues. All we can do is cross our fingers, we don't know.

[24:02] I will say that this game is going to, I think, be put up there as one of the better Stern

[24:11] releases in the last few years. And again, I haven't played it. Nobody else has played it unless

[24:17] you were at CES. But I think it has the fun, campiness, and lighthearted fun that makes Pimball

[24:25] enjoyable. All right. I probably wouldn't want to be over at spooky Pimball today and see all the

[24:30] excitement around the game itself. Because, you know, as I said, you've got now monster bash remake,

[24:38] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, and Monsters Pimball. All very similar themed games that are

[24:46] fighting for your Pimball dollars. And I highly doubt people are going to buy one, two, or three,

[24:53] all three of them, right? You're going to have to make up your mind. And, you know, I do think the

[24:58] battles going to be between monsters and monster bash remake. You know, it doesn't matter, Chuck

[25:04] has sold all 500 spots. I do think there are going to be people who are in on an Alice Cooper's

[25:11] Nightmare Castle that are going to want to get their thousand dollars back and go buy the monsters.

[25:16] They're not going to be able to unless they sell their spot. The jury is still out on whether

[25:21] all the 500 LEDs will sell out. We will know more tomorrow on that. I definitely just want to say

[25:30] thank you to Stern Pimball for constantly giving us a game to either applaud or bitch about.

[25:38] You know, the opinions on Pinside are all over the place, and that's fine. You know, if it was

[25:44] in first turn, we really wouldn't have much to talk about in Pimball. And this company continues

[25:52] to deliver games every few months, and I have to say this to you to them. How excited we're all

[25:58] of you today? Like how excited were you knowing that you were going to see a new Pimball machine

[26:05] birthed into the world? And I know I was really giddy. I know you were probably really giddy. I know

[26:13] you were probably really excited. And I know there is nothing quite like that moment of seeing a new

[26:19] Pimball world, sorry, a new Pimball machine enter the world. And if it wasn't for Stern, we would

[26:25] have to wait a really, really, really, really long time just to see new games. And then we'd have

[26:31] to wait a really, really, really long time just to get those games. And what's exciting to about

[26:36] monsters is I hear the LEDs are going to ship to consumers in February. And pros are already on the

[26:44] line. I mean, you're literally going to have this game in four weeks. And that's incredible. And so

[26:51] I just want to say thank you to Dwight, to Christopher Franchi, to John Borg, to Gary Stern, to George

[26:59] Gomez, to Zach, to Jack Danger, to Jared, to Jody. I think you guys put together a very stellar

[27:09] launch today. And I think you delivered a Pimball machine to the world that shows us that you are

[27:18] very passionate about getting people the best Pimball machine you possibly can get them. And

[27:26] again, I say that with a little bit of like, we could always do better. But that's just Pimball, of

[27:30] course. But I do think Stern is going to start firing on all cylinders. And I keep saying this,

[27:38] a little bit of a broken record. And I would hate to be competing with them if they keep delivering

[27:44] games like this and keep improving upon this new bar that they keep raising. And I know the

[27:52] designers that Stern listened to this podcast. I know the marketing team at Stern listens to this

[27:57] podcast. And I want to say this to the bean calendars at Stern Pimball, continue to invest in your

[28:05] designers, imaginations, continue to give people more. And you will see the difference in how

[28:12] games sell. You know, someone said to me, man, I'd hate to be a Deadpool owner right now. And

[28:19] it's kind of true in a little, you know, I look, and nothing against Deadpool, but maybe something

[28:24] against Deadpool. You can't tell me that the this game looks like it's the same price as Deadpool.

[28:32] It just looks like they went another level above. And it looks like just more passion and

[28:41] enthusiasm was poured into this game. And I think it shows. And I think the sales will show that.

[28:48] Can you imagine if they keep getting better and it's jaws and it's James Bond and it's Superman 78?

[28:58] Literally, it's going to be a battleground in 2019. Anyway, I'm going on too long. I think it

[29:04] was a great day. What I hope doesn't happen is this. And we know this is going to happen. You give

[29:10] people on the pin side enough time and they will just find stuff to bitch about. But I will say this,

[29:18] when I looked at this game today, I really didn't have any complaints. I can, I understand the black

[29:25] and white complaints, but take those out of the picture. I really don't see how you can look at

[29:31] a pinball machine like this and find much fault with it. I don't. I don't. I think we're getting

[29:40] to a point where the magic is coming back. Not 100%. Don't get me wrong. I'm, you know, you know,

[29:47] Kenyade, I'm never satisfied. I'm always, always going to push for there to be more. But I think this

[29:52] is a good day in pinball. I think you should be excited. And here, here's the great news. Nobody is

[29:58] forcing you to buy any of these games. And if you don't like this stern in like three, four months,

[30:03] they'll be a whole new stern. You didn't even know about that you could choose from. And that's

[30:06] incredible. There might be a Willy Wonka or a toy store. You're going to see a TPS. There might

[30:11] be a deeproot game. Poor, you know, I'm just going to say this, man, it's not a good day if you're

[30:17] like trying to get people excited about October fest. And again, this is just the reality of pinball.

[30:23] This is where the bar is at. And, you know, you, you need to deliver a game that has this much or

[30:32] more if you want to compete with stern at this price point. And that's just pinball. It's going to

[30:39] be competitive. It's going to be a battleground. I love it. And you should love it because the

[30:42] customer is going to get better pins because of it. And competition is a good thing. Everyone,

[30:49] happy monsters reveal day. Lots more is to come. I know stern is going to stream at stern's

[30:54] factory with with Dwight and John on Thursday. But we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll be talking about this

[31:02] pin for a while. But that was just my initial one day impressions. I'm a tired man. I'm work

[31:08] has been crazy. I've come back from the New Year and it's just nuts. But I still will muster up

[31:14] the energy to get you a pinball podcast. And I hope you vote for Canadian pinball podcast on the

[31:20] Twippies. If you haven't, go to this week in pinball. Fill out the answer forms. It only takes

[31:28] three minutes. And when it says favorite pinball podcast, Canadian pinball podcast, everyone,
