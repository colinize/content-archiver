[00:00] Just another manic Monday.

[00:04] Wish it was Sunday.

[00:08] That's not Monday.

[00:12] I don't have to Monday.

[00:16] Just another manic Monday.

[00:20] I don't know about you guys, but this Monday is a good day.

[00:24] I'm not going to say it's a good day.

[00:28] I don't know about you guys, but this Monday especially.

[00:32] I wish I had another day off on the weekend so I could just

[00:37] veg out, sit on the couch, and finally finish.

[00:41] Uncharted 4, which is what I'm playing right now, as I wait for my

[00:45] toad in pinball parts to get back to me.

[00:48] It's Monday morning. It's New York City.

[00:51] The sun is coming through the window.

[00:53] It's a gorgeous day.

[00:55] I want to get a Canadian pinball podcast at the

[00:58] number 39 up today.

[01:00] I can't believe we're at 39.

[01:02] That's not even counting all the special additions.

[01:05] What I want to talk about on this podcast, and this is just going to be

[01:08] a little bit of a one-on-one session with Canada.

[01:10] I have a lot of really awesome guests lined up for you guys

[01:14] in the next few weeks.

[01:16] Look forward to those.

[01:18] You're definitely going to see some more interviews coming up.

[01:20] They'll be one this week as well.

[01:22] Today I want to talk about a few things.

[01:24] I want to talk about the delays at Stern Pimball.

[01:27] What does that mean?

[01:29] Why is this happening?

[01:31] Where do we go from here?

[01:33] I want to talk a little bit about Rob Zombie, and the fact that that pinn is

[01:37] shipping and the code in that machine, and what people have been talking about.

[01:41] I want to talk a little bit about Hobbit versus Ghostbusters.

[01:44] That seems to be a topic that just won't go away.

[01:47] I want to give my thoughts on that.

[01:50] You want to talk and end the show about my Ghostbusters, Ellie, and what I should do with it.

[01:56] Let's just start the show.

[01:57] You guys know, when I do this podcast, I wish I had the time to always find awesome movie clips

[02:04] and other sound bites to play throughout the podcast.

[02:07] I'm still going to do that as much as I can, but it takes an inordinate amount of time

[02:11] to pull all that stuff together.

[02:14] Some of my earlier podcasts, when you guys listen to them, they might only be

[02:18] like a half hour, 45 minutes long, but their hours that would go in a preparation for some of those things.

[02:24] I don't have time to do it because I actually have to rush to a meeting in a couple of hours,

[02:28] but I just wanted to get this up for you guys.

[02:30] Let's talk first and foremost about one thing.

[02:33] This is before I get to those topics.

[02:35] I want to talk about a lot of the drama that has been happening on this podcast,

[02:40] and it's sort of carried over from form drama from months ago.

[02:45] I really had a crappy day on Friday, and I'll tell you why.

[02:51] As much as there are times when we're going to call people out, and we're going to keep people honest on this podcast,

[02:57] we're going to say things that I never could have said on Pinside,

[03:01] there's also going to be times when we take things too far, and we go down a road that doesn't make anybody happy.

[03:09] Where nobody's winning, and that happened between myself and Orrick Lawson of Alien Pimball.

[03:17] No one even knows where the drama really began.

[03:20] I think it even started in the John Poppiduke thread where he was saying a lot of stuff,

[03:26] and I think I chimed in.

[03:27] You can't even buy one, why are you even...

[03:29] It just started in some dumb place like that.

[03:32] As if any feud that begins in a J-Pop thread should ever continue,

[03:35] but it went on from there, and it's been going on for months, and look, it crossed the line,

[03:43] and I'll be the first admitted, when things get too personal and too nasty,

[03:47] it goes too far, because it saps the fun out of the entire hobby for everybody involved.

[03:54] As much as it might seem enjoyable to call people out, if you go too far,

[03:59] for me personally, I don't even enjoy listening to those podcasts afterwards,

[04:06] because they're just too negative.

[04:09] I did the thing that I think was the right thing to do, and I emailed Orrick, and I just squashed the beef.

[04:14] I was like, look, dude, man, it's just gone too far.

[04:17] Let's just let bygones be bygones, and call the day, because I start to hear stuff like people

[04:23] were personally threatening him and attributing it to me, and all this stuff,

[04:27] and it's just garbage. It's done. It's over with.

[04:30] And what I like about men is we can get over stuff, and we'll move on.

[04:37] What we'll do is what we always should do, is we will critique alien as a work of art,

[04:41] as a pinball machine, and we will discuss it when the time comes to discuss it.

[04:45] I also want Orrick to actually be in that thread, and to give people the updates they want,

[04:50] because I think people who are in on pinball machines deserve to have communication

[04:54] from the companies that are making them.

[04:58] I think Orrick and I have also both agreed wholeheartedly that things should wait to be revealed,

[05:04] and I think that will solve a lot of the issues.

[05:06] I actually think alien is in an interesting place, because without much being revealed,

[05:10] there's still a lot of curiosity around the pinball machine.

[05:14] And I'll say this, the number one emotion that we try to evoke in the marketing world is curiosity.

[05:20] That leads people to engagement.

[05:23] Not that they're doing that on purpose, but they have people in a good situation where

[05:27] what people are hearing seems exciting.

[05:30] And I think the door is open for them to deliver a pinball machine that can raise the bar,

[05:35] simply because they know it's out there.

[05:37] They know what people are playing, and they know what people's experiences are,

[05:40] and they have to build something better.

[05:42] We'll see how that develops, but I want to say that that beef is over.

[05:46] Okay, so let's end it there.

[05:49] I still want to play a mystery fighter that'd be fondly out there for 200 bucks,

[05:52] and I still have my bet that I don't think that alien will ship in September.

[05:56] That's not even a personal bet.

[05:59] It's just every time a date's been given, that something's going to ship,

[06:03] it never really hits that date.

[06:05] So I'm just betting across the whole industry as a whole, I think it's a smart bet.

[06:09] But if it does ship, I won't do a podcast in September.

[06:11] We'll stay true to our word there.

[06:14] Alright, so let's switch gears to stern delays.

[06:17] Man, this is like a really new territory for I think all people involved,

[06:23] because when you hear the word pinball delay, what do you normally think of?

[06:28] You think of a delay that takes months, if not years.

[06:33] Usually years.

[06:35] The pins that have been delayed for people in terms of like,

[06:39] you know, in terms of like, was big Lebowski, a Hobbit,

[06:43] and you can even get into the J-pop and the predator and the things that people have been waiting for

[06:48] for a long time, Thunderbirds.

[06:50] Where's pinball circus at, right?

[06:52] Where are all these pins that people have heard our shipping in 2016?

[06:57] And then most of them are even, were even initially slotted for 2014, 2015.

[07:03] So when stern gets accused of having delays or people are concerned about stern delays,

[07:08] I get that a lot of people are just like, really?

[07:12] Cut them a break.

[07:14] These guys might have a delay of a few months, but at least you know you're going to get a pin.

[07:17] And I get that.

[07:19] But stern is also not have this issue.

[07:22] People have been able to order pinball machines and get them within a couple months.

[07:27] And I was reading as much as I could, because these threads, they spiral out of control.

[07:32] Where we're talking about the delays and then we're talking about whether or not the upper playfield on Game of Thrones,

[07:37] premium is good or not.

[07:39] It's amazing how much these threads meander like the Mississippi.

[07:45] So, but when it comes to the delays, I know that people ordered Game of Thrones pro,

[07:51] some of the people ordered them way back in February still having gotten them.

[07:55] So it is a little strange that people are getting Ghostbusters pro before people are even getting Game of Thrones.

[08:04] And from what we saw this week, Ghostbusters, Ellie is on the line.

[08:09] And so it has to just come down to parts and the vendors being able to keep up with the parts.

[08:14] And stern's ability to really address the demand, right?

[08:21] The demand for pinball is through the roof now for them.

[08:25] They moved into the new facility and they are ramping up to meet up that demand.

[08:31] And even though stern is ready for the demand, are there vendors ready for the demand?

[08:35] Are there parts suppliers ready for the demand that's going to happen?

[08:38] Because there has never been a demand like this in pinball for new in box pinball machines in 20 years, guys.

[08:46] So as much as stern is ready for the demand, I don't think everyone else is.

[08:50] And I think everyone would agree with that.

[08:52] So what none of us can do is we can't pinpoint speculate what is causing the delays.

[08:58] But I think what some people have said, and I think it's the right way to look at this.

[09:03] All of these delays could be mitigated by stern in terms of the court of public opinion

[09:11] if stern would communicate differently when a delay occurs.

[09:16] And we've said this not just of stern, but of every pinball manufacturer.

[09:19] It seems that marketing and communications is one of the most difficult challenges for a pinball company.

[09:26] And as someone who works in the communications industry and in marketing, I understand what I'd want them to do.

[09:33] But I also understand what they're up against.

[09:36] And I don't think most people understand the latter part there.

[09:39] That yes, transparency is key.

[09:42] But you just can't always be 100% transparent about everything that goes on all the time.

[09:47] Because there are going to be times when a company needs to do something because of a cost measure

[09:53] that you just can't come out and be like, oh, we've got to do this.

[09:58] And here's 100% truth about it.

[10:00] Because then you might end up like pissing off everyone you bought the product already.

[10:04] And we're going to talk about that a little bit when we talk about slimer.

[10:07] So hold on to that thought.

[10:08] But when there's a delay, I think stern needs to do a better job of letting people know

[10:14] Game of Thrones pro is delayed.

[10:16] And you could say like here's why.

[10:18] Like there's a ramp or there's a play field issue.

[10:21] We were waiting on play fields to be printed.

[10:24] And here's what the timeline is roughly.

[10:27] We expect them to be in here.

[10:29] So if you order a machine, we apologize for the delay.

[10:33] And that's it.

[10:34] But with no communication, all that happens is you have people who are having, and I believe this,

[10:41] who are having sleepless nights.

[10:43] People, home collectors, when they order a new inbox pinball machine,

[10:48] it is something that you think about a lot.

[10:52] And I know this personally because when I've been thinking about Ghostbusters,

[10:57] new inbox, Ellie, since I place the order.

[11:00] And you just, it starts to become part of your daily thought.

[11:03] And so when a delay happens, you really don't know when Christmas is this year.

[11:09] That's sort of like what happens.

[11:12] It's like this moving target of awe.

[11:14] I'm excited, but I don't know when.

[11:16] I mean, I can't even imagine the guys who wait years for pinball machines.

[11:19] And all those hobbit guys who thought they were definitely going to have it by the third movie.

[11:23] You know, that excitement that anxiousness to get it turns the frustration,

[11:27] almost turns the hate that you had to wait so long.

[11:30] And then it turns the pain.

[11:32] So I don't, I can't quite say that people who have waited since February should be

[11:36] in a painful situation with the wait, with Stern and with Game of Thrones.

[11:40] But Stern needs to do a better job.

[11:42] They need to let people know.

[11:44] If Spider-Man Vault Edition has some delays, what are they?

[11:47] For people who are ordering Metallica and Star Trek that are having delays.

[11:51] It just seems, I think it seems to people I don't understand why it's taking long.

[11:55] They've already made this game. This game has finished. This game is done.

[11:58] There needs to be no new changes. They just have to put it on the line.

[12:02] It doesn't seem right that the game, the Ghostbusters should be shipping before Spider-Man VE to people.

[12:09] And people see that and they freak out.

[12:11] So look, Stern knows this. They have their way of doing business.

[12:15] And I understand. It is a very slippery slope when it comes to communication with pinball.

[12:21] Because once you give the fans information, will that stop them?

[12:27] Will they keep demanding more and they want to know more?

[12:31] So let's segue right there.

[12:34] Because we're talking about communications into the world of the Ghostbusters,

[12:40] Ellie, and Premium and Pro issues.

[12:43] And what has happened with the slimer mechanism?

[12:46] Because I think this has been a really...

[12:49] I don't think I've seen Stern have to deal with something when it comes to the most hyped pinball machine I've seen the last years.

[13:00] This is going to be their biggest pinball machine.

[13:02] And they really want to make sure they get this launch right.

[13:05] And they've been doing all these great launch parties.

[13:07] People trust on them. Like Ghostbusters, the Pro has been shipping. People have it.

[13:12] But there's an issue. There's an issue with the slimer mechanism.

[13:15] And it wasn't registering on a bunch of hits.

[13:19] And it seemed like there was a cable or wire that hangs down.

[13:24] And if that wire is not completely centered, it won't register the hits properly all the time.

[13:29] And the wire the way it worked in or the cable in the original mechanism could move around.

[13:36] So they... I'll give Stern credit. They redesigned the mech.

[13:40] I mean, how that must have been like a holy crap guys.

[13:43] We got to burn them in night oil and come up with a saw for this end-manufactured parts and get them into machines and get them back on the line.

[13:49] So there's a new mechanism.

[13:51] And it has sort of like a...

[13:55] I don't know. It almost looks like a ball that sits in the middle that groove and holds the wire dead center.

[14:02] And so that it can't move out of the center position and it'll always register hits.

[14:07] And the mechanism now... I don't know if this is the final one, but it seems to have like a clamp at the top of the...

[14:15] Like a connector at the top of the mechanism and then the wire is zipped high to the black tubing behind the mech.

[14:23] And it... you know, people said it looks a little sloppy, a little... a little like a hack job.

[14:29] And you know, I do agree that that doesn't look good.

[14:34] That if that's the final design of the mech.

[14:38] But I'll also say this because we saw this with like Game of Thrones and the Dragon and you could sort of see like screws and not everything was like completely flush.

[14:48] I think that mech looks bad when you zoom on it with a camera, take a photo of it, put an arrow or have a circle around it and be like, look at this.

[14:58] This looks horrible.

[15:00] Okay. Because when you look at it under a microscope, of course it doesn't look great.

[15:05] But you know, we know that when you step back and look at that game, if you were to have someone walk up to that game with that new mech on it, no one is going to be like, oh, but look at that.

[15:17] You know, it's the anal nature of the collector that zones in on everything or zeroes in on every single part of the game.

[15:26] I don't think people are going to care. I think it's still going to look fine. I don't think it overshadows all the beautiful playfield art, all the toys, all the things going on, the ectogogles and the...

[15:34] You know, when you have these things going on in the game, I don't think people are going to worry about that.

[15:38] But the issue is not that. The issue is this.

[15:41] People who have the old mechanism are not being sent the new mechanism. And I disagree with that. I think that is an issue.

[15:50] And I think it's wrong too that they won't sell people the new mech. My only guess, and again, this is all guessing, is that to change out the mech is a bitch.

[16:02] It requires really, really taking apart that entire mechanism. And to do that, it would be just...

[16:11] I think Stern doesn't want to go down that road because let's say they do hand everyone who bought the initial pro that has an old mech.

[16:20] Let's say they mailed everyone the new mech. I guess they would have to have the distributors call up a repair guy to come in and fix it.

[16:31] I don't know. As I'm saying this, and I'm doing this podcast in real time, it's not a bunch of notes. As I'm saying this, yeah, that seems like the right thing to do.

[16:40] You just bought a four to five thousand dollar toy and something and it doesn't work right. It needs a repair.

[16:49] I do think the company should be on the hook to repair it. If I bought a five thousand dollar TV and there was some pixels dead, they would take the whole TV back.

[16:59] Without question. I think that Stern, it's a cost-cutting measure. It has to be.

[17:08] I think this is going to be an issue moving forward where I hate it when it's like, oh, I have the Ghostbusters with the new mech and I have it with the old mech.

[17:18] Are the guys who bought the old mech slimer is going to have their values just plummet because no one's going to want it. No one would want the old mech machine.

[17:28] I think Stern really, this is going to be a moment where they're tested. I say this because I think Stern is maturing as a company and they're maturing into a company that is dealing with home collectors primarily.

[17:42] When it comes to what they're used to and most of the games shipping to operators and to people who are die hard fans, that's the thing.

[17:53] I think for years the people who bought Stern, knew in boxes were their operators or die hard pinball fans who knew how to tinker with machines.

[18:02] Both of those buyers wouldn't mind opening up and fixing changes. But as the primary consumer becomes a guy like myself who's pretty much a neo-fight to lifting a play field and working on a machine,

[18:19] Stern can't expect those people to work on a machine that's new in box and change out a mech. They can't.

[18:25] If you read the Ghostbusters thread, I don't think I've ever seen in any other pinball thread. So many people say this is my first new in box pinball machine ever, ever.

[18:37] When we talk about expanding the pinball collecting community, this is the pin that's going to do it. So Stern needs this launch to be hit out of the park.

[18:47] Everything is going for it. The theme, the art, the code is fun. Everyone's having a good time. The reviews are really positive.

[18:56] The slimer issue, the captive ball wire, the railing there is bent, the wire gets bent and doesn't register the captive ball. It doesn't seem like that was fixed.

[19:10] And then you also have the rail by the out lanes where the ball hops, where everyone's been saying that rail needs to be lifted.

[19:19] And it doesn't look like anything other than the slimer was worked on. I don't know for sure though, but the LEDs are on the line. I would hate.

[19:30] I hate to see Stern release Ghostbusters LE, which is the cremdola crem version of this pinball machine that I think is going to go down as one of the greatest pinball machines.

[19:45] Just in terms of the fun factor, the theme and all that stuff. It's going to be one of the most popular ever. I hate to see the LEs still be like in this guinea pig phase where things might have to change.

[19:56] Now, if Stern comes up with fixes and is able to get them out to 500 LE owners, that's not so bad. Maybe they're thinking that. Maybe they're like, let's just get the LEs out. We need to keep the line moving.

[20:08] If there's simple fixes that only 500 have to be dealt with, that could be the way they address it because the pros and premiums are going to ship in the thousands.

[20:18] You have to imagine that they're going to sell a few thousand of each of those different ones. They need to get those right. Right now, no premiums or no pros are on the line. Just the LEs, it seems.

[20:29] I think everyone also would feel better if Stern said, look, we're going to take two months off and we're going to fix these three issues that people have noticed on the initial shipments of games. Everyone would be happy.

[20:41] It would be unprecedented for Stern to do that and they're not doing that. We'll see how it all shakes out. I think that it's going to be really interesting to see how this whole plays out.

[20:53] I think all the people who have pros should get the new slimer mechanism. I think Stern needs to address the issues people are having with the games because you can't make LE buyers be your guinea pigs. You don't want to do that.

[21:06] The cost-cutting is one thing but really screwing over your best customers who are paying the most is another and you got to make sure you get it right. Let's hope that everyone does the right thing there and let's move on.

[21:17] What's the next topic on this episode, 39 of Candace Pimbal Podcast? Let's just talk about Hobbit versus Ghostbusters real quick because we're in the world of Ghostbusters.

[21:30] There's a poll that's up there which is better Hobbit or Ghostbusters and the poll is still fixed at 70% for Ghostbusters 30% for Hobbit.

[21:42] Initially I was like yeah that's totally accurate. The more I look at that poll though the more I just feel like it's just a pure opinion, a subjective opinion, Paul versus anything.

[21:54] And here is why nobody's played Ghostbusters premium or LE. Nobody. People have played Hobbit. It seems like the Hobbit code is coming along and getting better and I'm happy to see that.

[22:07] Look, I have to say this. If you were to put both machines side by side, I mean I love Zombietty's artwork. I think it is the most beautiful Stern Pimbal machine I've ever seen.

[22:22] The Hobbit artwork is also gorgeous. This is where I think it is a little bit in terms of which one looks the nicest apples to apples in a way.

[22:32] I still think Jersey Jack's quality in terms of the materials and the solidness of a Jersey Jack Pimbal machine is still better. It's more expensive though.

[22:46] I mean you have to add that caveat. It costs more. But the, God those decals of the smog artwork, smog, smog, I don't know how to actually say it. But if you've seen those with those rad decals, whatever, the glossiness of them is unbelievable.

[23:06] If Stern were to say to me, hey you can have Zombietty's artwork on those rad decals, print it with that level of glossiness. Hell yeah. I think everyone would pay the 400 bucks to have the cabinet art be that amazing. The print quality is incredible.

[23:19] I think it goes back and forth. You have to give it the JJP for the screen, just from a visual standpoint, red dots versus HD footage of the movie. It's not even close.

[23:32] But from there, I think the machines become harder to judge. There's definitely more to shoot out in Ghostbusters. There's so much more to shoot out. Ghostbusters is more of a fast sort of brutal game that is more of what I like in Pimbal, which is jumping in and have fun.

[23:50] I have having owned Lord of the Rings for such a long time. I don't want another long journey pin right now. So, you know, we'll see what happens. There's only one thing I wish that would happen though is I just wish that pans are freak on Pinside, which is we get it.

[24:08] You flip flopped from a Ghostbusters premium to a Hobbit. How many times do you have to remind us that you did that? Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to offer pans or freak. 25 dollars. If he can go the next two months without reminding us every time he ordered a Hobbit and didn't order Ghostbusters.

[24:36] Okay, so starting today, what is today? It's like May, was it 23rd? I don't even know today's date. If he can go two months without mentioning the fact that he switched over to the Hobbit, I will pay him 25 dollars. Every time he mentions that he switched over, he loses five dollars from that offer. So let's just keep it there. All right. 25 bucks. For doing nothing other than just stop saying it. We get it. There's nothing new to add pans or freak. You made the switch. You've always been a judge.

[25:06] You should have just stayed loyal and stayed in this whole Ghostbusters thing you did for a while. It just didn't even feel right. What's this guy doing? Just stop. Stop. It'd be like Captain Kirk becoming the biggest Hobbit fanboy. That's what that switchover felt like. So we'll see how both pens develop. Here's our thing about Hobbit. They finally showed what the 3rd flipper was for. It's pretty cool. It shoots the ball around the orbit and you have to with one shot.

[25:35] Shoot smoug. Why didn't they just say that? We talk about pinball communications. Why didn't Jersey Jack and Keith and those guys just articulate. Here's what it's used for. It's a really cool shot.

[25:48] He had one shot chance to kill the dragon. Whatever. They could have just said that. I'm in done with it. Instead they let people shit all over the design for months. It's not a reveal where when you see it. You're like, oh, they totally have this big surprise waiting. No, it's like a little anti-climatic to be like, oh, that's what it's for.

[26:04] And I'll tell you why because I still think smoug is a mess. I think I still think not having a bash toy in the Hobbit is a big mistake.

[26:13] They had so much opportunity to put. I need to like even as I do this real time. Yes, the pop-ups you can consider bash toys and then you do bash them.

[26:24] I mean, not having a bash dragon was a mistake. The troll heads are the small little bash things. But you want a big thing to bash at when there's a huge freaking dragon in your story.

[26:36] Right? He's like, right now he looks like a moped. He's just a talking head. Like there's someone like a little hand underneath the plate. He'll talk to you. I want to bash that fucking dragon to his dead.

[26:45] But you know, I'll take what I can get. But look, it seems like Hobbit's coming around. I still think that pin is going to, I don't know, I just can't. When people say it's getting so much better, I think it's hard to articulate what the changes are.

[26:58] So I look forward to hopping on one soon. If here's what I want. I want someone who has a Hobbit. I want someone to come on the show.

[27:05] If you have a Hobbit, can you please come on, Canadian Spinball Podcast and talk about the machine itself, what the different code changes are, what they entail. Can you articulate verbally what you love about the pin and all the other stuff you want to talk about?

[27:22] But I just, I don't want to speculate on this. I know I get over 600 people plus listening to this podcast every episode.

[27:30] Someone must own a Hobbit or know someone who owns a Hobbit. If you do, please reach out to them, say go on, Canada Show and talk about why you love the Hobbit. It's Canada, K-A-N, E-D-A, pinball at gmail.com.

[27:42] Alright, so let's move on. Let's, I want to talk about Rob Zombie real quick. And I want to try and keep this podcast about a half hour. So Rob Zombie, it's been shipping the LEDs have been shipping.

[27:53] I have noticed that there's not a lot of like fanfare and celebration going on. And simply because not many people are going to get it. Right, only 50 LEDs are going out. I, you know, I, I guess most of those members are on pinside but a lot of them are probably not active.

[28:10] So the pin is landed and you know, it's, it's, it's interesting because I did expect a little bit more hype and a little bit more enthusiasm around getting that pin. I'm not even seeing people upload videos of gameplay. I'm not even seeing a lot of people share their reviews of the pin.

[28:30] And so I guess I'm asking people who have gotten a Rob Zombie LED, please share more information with the community because we rely on you. I mean, there's, even if there's like say like 10 of shipped, we need from you 10 people to help keep us excited and help keep us informed because you're the only ones who can do it.

[28:51] It's not like Ghostbusters Pro where, you know, people can even go into arcade to play it. People are getting them in their homes. There's, there's a lot more than 10 people that have experienced Ghostbusters Pro that are sharing reviews. So if you're in on a spooky pinball machine, I think you need to get a camera.

[29:09] Just even just type out your reviews of the code. Like what, what, what are you experiencing? Share it with us. I did want to also call out Hilton, why snow, who this guy? I mean, the most amazing parade to be going on. There could be not a cloud in the sky. And why snow, which has become this cumulonimbus version of Hilton and just sort of float up into the sky and rain down on the beautiful parade.

[29:38] He always finds like the one thing to complain about and all of his complaints originate from one area. He wants everything to be for tournament play. And I, why snow, I just want to tell you right now that 99.9% of pinball players and buyers and collectors don't give a shit that a game's code is coded for your little pinball tournaments.

[30:04] We don't care. And when I say we, I mean the 99.9% of people who buy pinball machines don't give a shit the way you look at a pinball machine. And so if you look at Rob Zombie, he jumps into the thread and is like, this code's got a long way to go. He's used a word long way as if the game right now sucks. And it's not good for tournament play in the scoring is not balanced. Yada, yada, yada.

[30:28] And then the guy who coded the machine comes in and says, hey man, like it's done. Like this code is pretty much done. Other than a few tweaks I'm scoring and some wizard modes to add, you know, that we shipped this pinball machine pretty finished.

[30:43] And I've played Rob Zombie and it's fun to play. Like, here's why like Rob Zombie. I understand what I'm doing. I understand where to shoot. I understand how to get to multiple on holy shit. Like, what a multi ball. There's like what eight ball multi ball is.

[30:56] And there might be more. Sorry, I need to have my notes in front of me. But it's so it's so clear what you're doing. And here's the thing about Rob Zombie. And this is what Y Snow doesn't understand. People are not buying Rob Zombie pinball machine for tournament play at all.

[31:12] They're buying it because a it's they love Rob Zombie be it's rare. See they want to support spooky. And like if you love Rob Zombie and you have this pinball machine, you're cranking up the fucking songs man. And you're like in it like you're playing your favorite guys like pinball machine with like Dracula blast in and all that stuff.

[31:34] It's like that's why you have that pinball machine all those are ready to call out. It's like it's just it's an experience like no other. It really is like the only R rated pinball machine out there right now like that you can buy that it's it's like a mature game.

[31:48] And people are buying it to have fun on that level. So I just wish Hilton would just stop. It's not all about you with every pinball machine man. There's plenty of games for tournament modes. But here's the thing.

[31:59] What if Rob Zombie is never a good game for tournaments who gives a shit man. It's still a rare awesome like Rob Zombie themed game that is mature and his fans are going to love. Heck even Rob Zombie was pissed off that they're not making more for more of his fans.

[32:16] So let's let's look at Rob Zombie the way that pinball machine was intended to be and I'm sure the coder will make things more balanced but every coder is not lineman sheets man every coder is not a tournament player that's always going to make sure things are coded perfectly for tournaments.

[32:32] When it comes to code and pinball and what makes most players happy they want to know they want to feel fun when when when modes get started so like I think all the mode should be in a game.

[32:43] So I don't want inserts with modes I don't even think so every mode should be there and when a mode starts it should fucking like excite you like there should be light shows and there should be call outs and sound effects and all like how fucking awesome is the midnight mode on ghost busters.

[32:58] I don't know if you guys saw this but if you play the pinball machine in your house or at midnight it goes into a special mode because it reads the internal clock of the spike system and like it's awesome like the lights go out like the balls drain and all of a sudden like midnight mode starts and it that's what people want.

[33:17] They want excitement they want unexpected things to happen with the code they don't give a shit about your tournament scoring oh my god I'm going to cover this on another podcast but I just want to say like all you tournament players out there that wine all the time about balance scoring and code as being the things that like are that don't make a machine worth owning you guys are in the minority you're like the 1% of players and it doesn't mean you're wrong because I do think you guys and your feedback helps complete a game.

[33:46] It does it does but it's not the first coding that needs to go in to make a pinball machine worthy of being in people's home so we'll stop there.

[33:55] The last thing I want to bring up in this episode of Canadian pinball podcast is what to do with my ghost busters Ellie so I have been offered as you guys know a little bit over $10,000 for the machine and I still I'm having a hard time saying I'm just going to sell it and I'll tell you why I was I was on Friday when I was in the

[34:15] on Friday when I was all bummed out and about all the drama I was in a mode or mindset where I just want to like turn it all off and you know it felt the same way or it was like I just want to drain the alien threat and I'm going to be a part of it I just want to like stop talking my pinball for a while and just

[34:32] just enjoy my toad in and get rid of ghost busters and simplify my life a bit where I'm pinball and then I you know squash the beef I felt good again.

[34:43] And I watched the video if you haven't seen this go on Stern's Facebook page and watch the video of the Stern factory tour that took place a few days ago and ghost busters Ellie is on the line and my God it looks incredible incredible for those of you saying like the slimer artwork is hideous and the green is hideous you guys are out of your minds like I get it was hideous on you didn't like it on the whole but the whole green was even more like a puke green like this green is is much much better.

[35:12] It's much more like a neon slimer green but it works with like the big slimer and it works the way that the green the green and purple just in general that's why they're the whole colors they go together nicely and there's a lot of purple

[35:26] hues and overtones and zombieities artwork I just think it's gorgeous I think people who are complaining about it are probably just jealous they didn't get it on one and I also don't think the premium looks better than the Ellie I just don't I like it I like it a lot I but I think the pro art cabinet actually looks better than the premium I think the pro is more detail I'm so confused when you look at the cabinets of the pro and the premium the pro is more going on than the premium so just a little bit we're there that they did it that way but anyway should I sell it?

[35:56] I don't know what to do I I mean talks with a few people one person I met on eBay a couple other people I got connected to and they're interested in buying this pinball machine and so I'm going to make up my mind this week I don't have to though I might wait I'm they're not going to ship until probably next few weeks I I just don't see people who get these selling them I don't think they're going to come up very often and they will come up though I don't think they're going to come up very often

[36:26] I mean I'm not fooling myself this isn't trawl is greatest at pinball machine is and it's a real le it's definitely different than the premium it doesn't it comes up for sale it comes up for sale and you can buy one and the question is new unbox and that's the thing I did trawl

[36:45] new inbox today would still fetch close to $15,000 as I would. I mean you might say nope,

[36:52] but it would. Of course if a V comes out all bets are all right. So that's it. Here's

[36:56] the thing. Would you guys email me at canadapimbal at gmail.com and tell me if I should sell it

[37:02] yes or no. I want to hear your opinions and I'm going to read your opinions on the next

[37:06] episode of Canada's Pimbal Podcast. You know what I'll do is I'll do a special report

[37:10] where I just read people's feedback. Like it's almost like a poll that I want to do and

[37:16] I'll read your feedback word for word what I should do. So here's your chance without

[37:20] actually coming on the show to get your opinions shared out to the show. So I'm going to do

[37:25] a special edition. I'm going to do it. Let's say tomorrow night I'll do it. I'll read

[37:30] everyone's emails. So you have for what 24 hours a little bit more to email me at canada

[37:36] pimbal k an eda pimbal at gmail.com. Should I sell ghost busters for $10,000 and I will read

[37:45] exactly what you say out into the community even if it is an obscenity. Okay. So that's

[37:51] it for episode 39. Have a great week guys. We will be back this week with an interview

[37:57] and some more fun around pimbal. Keep flipping.
