[00:00] Now the Chinese gotta punch you in the air.

[00:02] My god, I'm gonna be the same.

[00:09] Gini gotta gun.

[00:11] Set, set, set, set, set, set, set, set, set, set, set, set, set, set, uh, Jenny's got

[00:17] a gun, but not even John Wick.

[00:19] Here's the thing about this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:21] I'm on fire.

[00:22] I've been waiting for this baby.

[00:23] I'm gonna come in with the heat on this episode and I'm gonna say some truth bombs that

[00:28] you need to hear.

[00:29] We're also gonna talk about what I know are gonna be the next two titles from Jersey

[00:33] Jack.

[00:34] I'm gonna let you know who commissioned these like fun house pinball machines.

[00:37] I know exactly who it is.

[00:39] I know where the games are at and I know why they're delaying bringing the game to market.

[00:44] We're also gonna talk about what else.

[00:46] Why Stern pinball lost the Indiana Jones license.

[00:49] The word lost is weird.

[00:51] They didn't lose it.

[00:52] You're gonna hear why they're not making Indiana Jones.

[00:55] But before I do that, I wanna do a very strident.

[00:59] I'm gonna rant about Stern pinball right now and what's happening around this John Wick

[01:04] launch because it's absolutely a debacle.

[01:09] It is a dumpster fire and I've been thinking about this like how did this like game John

[01:14] Wick?

[01:15] You know, it's like just an innocuous new game from Stern.

[01:18] There's nothing really new in it.

[01:20] There's no real innovation and all of this anger and all of this vitriol.

[01:25] It can't be only about the artwork in the game.

[01:28] It can't.

[01:29] And what I think I'm gonna articulate right now is the real reason why a lot of us are

[01:35] really angry at Stern pinball and this was just the final thing that lit a fuse that's

[01:43] been brewing for a long time.

[01:45] I think this thing has been a powder keg ready to go off and I want to explain why because

[01:51] I think there's one simple thing that has destroyed Stern pinball.

[01:56] If you look at all of their moves over the last three years and I think what happened

[02:00] with John Wick and it's not even what you think it is.

[02:04] It's not even the fact that John Wick is not holding guns.

[02:08] I'm telling you, the main reason why I think a lot of people are upset is I think Stern

[02:14] pinball is now a company that is just 100% out of touch with what people who supported

[02:21] them all these years want.

[02:23] They're out of touch with who the real community is that's gonna keep them successful.

[02:29] They're out of touch with the people that are gonna spend seven to thirteen thousand dollars

[02:33] on their products and not only are they out of touch with us, they are treating us

[02:39] like we don't even matter.

[02:42] They are treating us like we're not even their target.

[02:45] Like they're now gonna aim beyond us and find new customers to buy these overpriced

[02:51] box of lights that used to cost 50% less money with a lot more in it as if we don't

[02:56] know all this stuff.

[02:57] As if we haven't been on this journey all these years, if you guys did not unbox an ACDC

[03:02] and see all the stuff and mechs that were in that game, as if you didn't unbox Metallica's

[03:06] and Lord of the Rings and Batman's and Ghostbusters and Star Wars and Jurassic Park's as if you

[03:11] don't know what Stern was capable of making when games were 40% cheaper and yet we were

[03:17] still willing to go on the ride with them.

[03:20] We were still willing to go on this journey with Stern Pimball.

[03:23] We still showed support for Jack Danger, someone everybody loves when he had his first game.

[03:29] Even though Foo Fighters didn't have much in it, it was still a thirteen thousand dollar

[03:33] game that this community supported and why do you think they supported that game?

[03:38] Not just because it was a great game because we also had a lot of love for Jack and now

[03:42] Jack's over there at Stern.

[03:43] It's like joining the NWO.

[03:45] I don't know if it's gonna be the same next time around.

[03:49] But here's the thing and here's the reason why Stern's arrogance is catching up with

[03:53] them and I think it's over for them unless they truly, unless they truly do a meocopa and

[03:59] start to build bridges back to the very people that supported this company all those years.

[04:06] You know I've seen this people in the marketing world.

[04:08] I've seen it.

[04:09] I work on Bud Light.

[04:10] I work on Bud Light.

[04:11] I remember when we used to do Dilly-Dilly.

[04:13] I remember when we used to do football stuff.

[04:16] We used to do all the most fun things the world had seen in the marketing world and then

[04:20] all of a sudden, right, Bud Light tried to aim beyond the people who drank Bud Light and

[04:25] look what happened to them.

[04:26] And so when Stern Pimball wants to launch a new Pimball machine, John Wick and put it

[04:31] into the world and you're telling me with all of the Pimball content creators that have

[04:36] supported Stern for so many years that have spent so many countless hours dedicating their

[04:41] lives to advancing and growing the Pimball hobby.

[04:45] The person you go to to launch John Wick Pimball is some YouTuber named Be Kong that no one's

[04:52] ever heard of who's never made any real significant Pimball content in his life who has no

[04:57] followers that are Pimheads and so Zach Sharp is going to chummy up with this guy and

[05:04] that's how you launch this game.

[05:05] So that's Strike One right there.

[05:07] And then George Gomez wants to go up and say that they did a media tour.

[05:11] In the center of America, on the east and the west coast and they invite it media to see

[05:15] this game, they didn't invite any Pimball media.

[05:19] They didn't even invite Jason Napp to come check out the game.

[05:22] I know Jason would have gone to the east coast sort of showcasing of John Wick.

[05:27] I know all of us would have loved to have signed an NDA, see the game, hear about how they

[05:32] made the game.

[05:33] No, they didn't invite any of us.

[05:35] And you know what that shows us everybody that they don't care about any of us.

[05:40] And Stern's arrogance and their ignorance to this is going to be their downfall.

[05:44] They don't care.

[05:45] They're not doing surveys about how much do you want to spend on a game.

[05:49] They're not doing market research.

[05:50] How many John Wick's can we make?

[05:52] The fact that they think they can sell 1000 John Wick's at $13,000 a pop just shows you

[05:59] how arrogant they are.

[06:01] That's more machines than they made of freaking Star Wars.

[06:04] Right, what happened to all of a sudden, Stern?

[06:07] You think that a man for your product has doubled since you made games like Ghostbusters

[06:12] and Metallica and ACDC and since you've doubled the price of your games, you really think

[06:19] that a man for your product has doubled.

[06:21] And I know what's happened to this company.

[06:23] I know exactly what's happened to this company during COVID when there was a feeding frenzy

[06:28] on their product.

[06:29] They thought that demand was going to last forever.

[06:32] And instead of just embracing that.

[06:34] Instead of saying, hey, this is great.

[06:36] Business is going to be healthy for a really long time.

[06:39] Instead of doing that, what do they do?

[06:41] They significantly raised the prices on everything.

[06:45] They didn't raise the price on the bomb.

[06:46] They didn't put more into these games and they just started charging more and more and

[06:50] more for less and less and less.

[06:53] And they really, their arrogance really has them believing that we would just keep spending

[06:58] money on these games.

[06:59] And I've said it before and I'll say it again.

[07:02] It's a series of moves that Seth Davis has made and best believe it, people that Gary

[07:08] Stern is on for these moves.

[07:10] So is Gomez.

[07:11] They all are on for these moves.

[07:13] No one said stop.

[07:15] Nobody said stop.

[07:16] When Keith Owen designed a game that looks like a $5,000 James Bond home pin game that

[07:23] should have been sold for like $7,500 no more.

[07:27] When he designed that game, who do you think Greenlit?

[07:31] $20,000 to this community to me and you.

[07:35] Who do you think Greenlit that price?

[07:37] It was Gary.

[07:38] It was Seth.

[07:39] It was George.

[07:40] Nobody said no.

[07:42] Nobody said if we do this, if we make this move, this is going to piss off all of our loyal

[07:47] customers that have made this company so healthy, they didn't say that.

[07:51] Nobody said stop.

[07:52] Not even Keith Owen said stop.

[07:54] You know, Keith Owen could have said, I'm going to quit this company.

[07:57] If you charge my fans and people who love Pinball $20,000 for this game, I know as a designer,

[08:05] this game is not worth anywhere near $20,000.

[08:09] Did Keith Owen stop in and say no?

[08:11] He could have played that card.

[08:13] He could have used his leverage.

[08:14] He's got a lot of leverage over there.

[08:16] No, they all went ahead with it.

[08:18] And then all these shield distributors were like, it's price perfectly.

[08:21] Remember those people?

[08:22] They don't even want to admit what they were saying when that game came out.

[08:25] But what that move did was that signify to everybody, we don't give a crap about you.

[08:31] We don't give a crap about what your eyes are showing you.

[08:34] We don't give a crap about what your ears are telling you.

[08:37] We don't give a crap about having a screen with any real code in this game.

[08:40] We don't give a crap.

[08:41] We're going to charge you the most money any Pinball machine has ever been over at Stern Pinball

[08:46] and it's going to be a barren game.

[08:48] It hardly has anything in it and we don't give a crap and we're going to push it down

[08:52] your throats.

[08:53] Not only that, if you bought some of our older LEDs and we said we were never making more

[08:58] Jurassic Parks, we were never making more of these Elvira LEDs.

[09:02] We don't give a crap about you because we're going to make more and they went and they

[09:06] made more and they double the number of Jurassic Park LEDs, tanking all of the value on those

[09:11] original owner LEDs and they just destroyed all the Elvira collectors.

[09:15] Everybody who had that machine believed Stern when they said this game is limited, we're

[09:20] never going to make another version of this game and what did they do?

[09:24] We don't give a crap about you.

[09:26] Errogance and greed.

[09:28] Errogance and greed.

[09:29] Over and over and over again over the last three years and here's where we are now.

[09:33] Not only are they so arrogant and treating us like we're stupid rich guys that don't want

[09:37] to ask if there's any value in these machines but then they want to go and ignore all the

[09:41] Pinball content creators who've helped Stern Pinball over the years, drum up all of this

[09:46] excitement whenever there's a new game.

[09:48] It's people like me.

[09:49] People like Zach Mani.

[09:50] People like Carrie Hardy.

[09:51] People like Slam till people like loser kid.

[09:53] All of us combine.

[09:54] All of us.

[09:55] All of us.

[09:56] I mean that.

[09:57] If there's ever a moment where there should be some solidarity among the Pinball content creators,

[10:01] it's right now because all of us are the ones that help Stern Pinball get people excited.

[10:07] Who do you think makes content on a weekly basis to keep people excited about Pinball?

[10:11] Is it Zach Sharp?

[10:13] He doesn't make crap.

[10:14] He doesn't do anything to keep people excited.

[10:16] He's just going to a few college universities slapping high five with basketball players

[10:21] that are never going to buy these damn games.

[10:23] He doesn't reach out to any of us.

[10:25] He doesn't do anything for any of you.

[10:27] Does Jared make any content on social media?

[10:29] No.

[10:30] He doesn't do anything.

[10:31] None of them do anything.

[10:32] Their marketing department is absolute garbage.

[10:35] They never do anything.

[10:36] All they ever do is every Friday show us that they're making games.

[10:40] Cool.

[10:41] You're making games.

[10:42] But are you engaged with the community?

[10:43] Are you talking to the people that are spending money on your products?

[10:46] No, you don't even want to engage the community.

[10:49] And here's the BS thing.

[10:50] Is they're going to take what happened this week and say, see, this is why we don't engage

[10:55] with the community because look at how the community responds to us whenever we try to engage.

[11:00] We're all seeing George Gomez running around trying to do damage control.

[11:04] It's not working.

[11:05] The whole thing just feels like unprofessional amateur hour for a guy like him to have to

[11:10] do this.

[11:11] It doesn't really work.

[11:12] He shouldn't be arguing about his integrity, which is random dudes on Facebook.

[11:16] But it's on you, George.

[11:18] It's on you, Gary.

[11:20] It's on you, Seth.

[11:21] It's on you, Zach.

[11:22] It's on you, Jody.

[11:23] It's on all of you because all of you made a whole aggressive greedy moves that showed

[11:29] us what you think about us.

[11:31] And you can't escape it now.

[11:33] You can't escape it now.

[11:34] And John Wick, all John Wick is.

[11:36] The tip of an iceberg of this big iceberg that Stern Pimball has been sailing into for

[11:42] the last three years.

[11:44] Seth Davis is the captain of that ship that says, we're Stern Pimball.

[11:48] We sell the most games in the world.

[11:50] Surely we can't sink.

[11:52] Well Seth, wake up brother.

[11:54] You've steered this company in such a direction now where like there's no excitement anymore

[12:00] when a new game comes out because of your greedy moves.

[12:03] All of them.

[12:04] All of them have made greedy moves.

[12:05] There's no excitement anymore.

[12:07] And now you're going to steer this company in a whole new direction with spike three.

[12:11] You want to know what spike three is all about?

[12:13] It's about two things, all right?

[12:15] They're going to have more computing systems that's going to be able to have like two 4K

[12:19] screens.

[12:20] Wow, big deal.

[12:21] Two 4K screens.

[12:22] Those screens are going to be so small.

[12:24] They don't even need to be in 4K.

[12:26] And the other real thing they're doing with spike three, it's all about internet.

[12:30] They're going to have a lot faster internet connection on these games.

[12:34] It's all going to be about internet and downloadable content and insider connected because the

[12:39] big move they want to make with spike three is not to make a stern machine look like

[12:44] it's jam packed like a Jersey Jack game.

[12:47] The big move that's coming at Stern Pimball is they're going to want to bring downloadable

[12:51] content into every single game.

[12:53] So you're going to have to spend more money on your game after you buy it.

[12:57] You think they're going to keep updating code for free?

[12:59] No, they're going to probably have these games come out around 1.0 code.

[13:04] And then when you want to get new levels or new songs or new modes, you're going to

[13:08] have to spend more money.

[13:10] And a really interesting debate is happening now because dealers and distros are saying,

[13:14] well, wait a minute.

[13:15] Like we're going to help you sell all these games and then you're going to make all this

[13:18] money with all this DLC.

[13:20] Like are we going to get any cut in this?

[13:22] And the whole thing just sucks because for the longest time, all of these dealers and

[13:27] distros and Stern Pimball and you and I, all of us were in a win-win situation.

[13:32] You know, you got to buy a game where the value of the game you saw it.

[13:36] You saw it in the price of the game.

[13:38] You saw it in the mechanicals.

[13:39] You saw it in the theme.

[13:41] You saw it in the artwork and it felt good and you bought the game and you played it for

[13:45] a year.

[13:46] And if you moved it on out of your collection at most, you lost $502,000 at most, but you

[13:52] got at least $502,000 in place.

[13:55] And so it was a win-win.

[13:56] And every once in a while in Ellie that had really strong demand, you would actually make

[14:01] a few bucks when you went to sell it because the demand always exceeded the supply of the

[14:05] game.

[14:06] Now look at today.

[14:07] There's never going to be even close to a thousand people that won a John Wick Ellie

[14:11] ever, ever.

[14:12] I mean, look at the powder coated armored.

[14:14] It's just black.

[14:15] They're not even doing anything interesting with it.

[14:17] There's no interesting mechs in the game.

[14:19] So if you buy a John Wick right now for $13,000, you're always going to have something where

[14:24] there's going to be way more supply than the man.

[14:27] We've heard from distributors this week.

[14:28] I've reached out to distributors.

[14:30] This game is selling worse than Venom.

[14:32] And this is going to be a death blow to distributors that are already sitting on so much unsolved

[14:37] inventory.

[14:38] So it's no longer a win-win.

[14:40] And now we're in a place.

[14:42] We're in a place now.

[14:43] I think we're in a place now, everybody.

[14:44] And I mean this when I say this.

[14:46] After all of these arrogant moves, after all of these like BS excuses, it's not about

[14:52] no guns in the artwork.

[14:54] It's about a major pinball company that had the ultimate golden goose.

[14:58] They were in such a good position to continue to drive pinball forward over the next five

[15:03] years.

[15:04] And I think they have all become arrogant.

[15:06] I think they've become out of touch.

[15:08] And I think it's caught up to them.

[15:10] And I'm so happy to see you and me.

[15:12] And the rest of the pinball community saying we're not supporting this.

[15:16] We're not buying your products.

[15:18] It's oversturned.

[15:19] And there are enough boutique pinball companies out there that I think we all should happily

[15:23] support who are not going to pull these greedy moves.

[15:26] And again, it's a series of very calculated greedy moves that they did not have to do.

[15:32] They absolutely did not have to raise prices on at least from 10.5.

[15:37] Godzilla was 10.5.

[15:38] How are you going to charge 10.5 for Godzilla?

[15:41] And then all of a sudden, John Wick is $13,000.

[15:45] Food fighters is $13,000.

[15:47] Did you up the bomb by 500 bucks?

[15:49] No you didn't.

[15:50] Did you put anything new into the game?

[15:52] No you didn't.

[15:53] And why is it now $25,000 more?

[15:57] All of these were calculated greedy moves.

[16:00] They cooked the books and all the rumors that Seth was doing that to prime-stern to get

[16:05] sold, to get the highest price possible, seem kind of feasible now.

[16:09] But now they're screwed.

[16:11] They've gotten so much blood from us.

[16:13] As a community and as customers, there's no more left.

[16:16] We have no more left.

[16:17] I have no more patience for stern pinball.

[16:20] I'm so happy I'm selling my Batman SLE because I just want to be done with them until

[16:25] they make a move that shows us they care again about us.

[16:29] I am not going to support stern pinball.

[16:31] I don't even care.

[16:32] How are you going to come to New York City with a pinball press tour, not even invite Jason

[16:37] Napp?

[16:38] I mean just think about that for a minute.

[16:40] Jason Napp has tens of thousands of people.

[16:44] He takes his personal time to make the world's best pinball media website in the world.

[16:49] There is nothing better than Napp's arcade.

[16:52] And stern and zack sharp, you're going to come to the East Coast and you're not even

[16:56] going to invite Jason Napp.

[16:58] And yet we have to see this wack-a-doodle-doodle-doodle-be-cong be the face of the John Wick release.

[17:05] And that's all I need to know.

[17:07] Really, it really is.

[17:09] Sometimes it can be one move a company makes that just signifies they don't care about

[17:14] us anymore.

[17:15] So stern pinball, if you think you're immune to failure, if you think you're so big,

[17:20] you can't sink, I want to introduce you to a beer named Bud Light.

[17:24] I want to introduce you to a ship named the Titanic because you're making the dumbest

[17:28] moves ever because you're not listening to your community.

[17:32] You're not listening to your buyers.

[17:34] And I think you've absolutely shown us that your arrogance is what's driving you.

[17:39] And I don't want to see pictures of Gary drinking at bars with Jack Danger at 2 in the

[17:43] morning.

[17:44] And we don't care, Jack, we don't care.

[17:47] We can tell that you were having more fun when you were unshackled and you could actually

[17:52] talk about your love of pinball.

[17:54] Now you have to shill every single move that stern pinball makes.

[17:58] And it makes me sad because I know there was a time where Jack Danger was probably only

[18:02] making like $25,000 a year streaming pinball machines because he loved it so much.

[18:09] And now he's got to work for a company that's going to charge $20,000 for a James Bond

[18:15] 60th.

[18:16] No, that's not cool.

[18:18] And you can't escape anymore guys because Kaneda and the rest of us have seen all of

[18:23] your greedy moves.

[18:25] We've seen all of your arrogant plays.

[18:27] And if you're not going to invite Jason Nab to a Northeast mediator, it just shows us

[18:33] you don't care.

[18:34] And that's it people.

[18:35] That's why people are mad about John Wick and no guns.

[18:38] It's not just about that.

[18:41] It's a series of things that have shown us this company does not care.

[18:45] And I'm going to upload this show to be public.

[18:48] You just everybody has to hear this.

[18:49] Like I can't just do this for the paying customers.

[18:51] I'm sorry gang.

[18:53] And I know you're on board for this because this needs to be something that everybody hears.

[18:57] You know what?

[18:58] I'm just going to make this show public.

[19:00] And then I'm going to do another show right now where I'm going to give you all that

[19:05] other exclusive information nobody else has given you.

[19:08] Some of it is new.

[19:09] Some of it's been in the rumor mail.

[19:10] But this needs to be a standalone show.

[19:13] Stern Pimball's arrogance has killed them.

[19:16] And they need to find a way back.

[19:19] And I think they're going to take it on the chin with this launch because this launch signifies

[19:24] way more than just John Wick.

[19:27] This is three to four years of treating your loyal customers like crap.

[19:32] All right, Canadian out, drop in the mic.

[19:35] 7th Twippy if we actually had Twippy's later.
