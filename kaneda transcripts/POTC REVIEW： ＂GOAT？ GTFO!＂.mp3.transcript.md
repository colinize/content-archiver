[00:00] I don't care about you, but you!

[00:07] I don't care about you, but you!

[00:16] Welcome to a little special edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:20] I'm your host, Canada, the only pinball podcaster that has to take a taxi to go get the two cars he owns.

[00:27] What do I want to do on this episode?

[00:29] I just want to give a little short review of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[00:34] As many of you know, I'd been saying for weeks I was going to get a chance to go back and play the game

[00:40] and be walked through the game by someone who really understood the game,

[00:46] appreciated the game, and considered Pirates of the Caribbean to be one of the greatest pinball machines of all time.

[00:53] That gentleman's name was Serge, he's a listener of the show, he's originally from Queens,

[00:59] and so we met up today, and we played a bunch of Pirates of the Caribbean for a couple hours.

[01:06] We also played some other games, so I want to give you my review after finally playing the game with someone who appreciates Pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:14] How does that sound for a little short episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast?

[01:19] So, before I met up with Serge, I also watched the Jack Danger Eric Streaming of the game,

[01:28] and they did it on February 14th, and I finally watched it, and I have to say this,

[01:33] after watching that stream and after playing the game for a couple hours today,

[01:38] I've sort of made up my mind on this game, and I think you're going to be,

[01:43] you know, I don't know if this is going to shock you, but I think you'll enjoy what I have to say.

[01:48] So, here's my take, my overall take on Pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:51] I think this game is probably the most confusing pinball machine I've ever played in my entire life,

[02:00] and I don't mean that to be negative, I just mean that to be the reality of what this game is all about.

[02:08] And if you go and watch the Jack Danger and Eric Stream, it takes Eric who designed the game,

[02:15] it takes Eric over 15 minutes to explain the Jack Danger how to play the game.

[02:22] Now, imagine standing over Batman 66.

[02:26] How long would it take Lyman Sheets to explain to you how to play the game?

[02:30] Probably a minute or two, and then you're in and you're going and stuff is happening.

[02:35] Same with most modern Sterns, it should never take anyone over 10 minutes to explain the rules of the game.

[02:44] And I don't know about you out there, but my head was spinning when I was listening to all those rules.

[02:51] And then when I met up with Serge, it was the same sort of thing.

[02:54] It was this really complex and overly difficult way to grasp.

[03:02] I think that's a good word, to just grasp what this game is about.

[03:06] And the hardest thing is this.

[03:08] The game just doesn't seem to have any sort of story or narrative in which you can understand.

[03:14] And if you know the movies and you know the storylines of the films, that doesn't really help you at all.

[03:20] From what I can take away from the game itself, it's all about starting the five different films

[03:27] and getting through the five multi-balls.

[03:30] And if you go through five multi-balls and that unlocks five wizard modes in which you try to get through all of those.

[03:38] But you could, after hearing about those different approaches, you could just ask one simple question,

[03:45] oh why? Like why am I doing all this? Like what is the point of this game?

[03:50] Like is there an overall point of the game?

[03:54] And without a narrative, and without an ability to explain a narrative and a goal, like a simple to articulate goal,

[04:03] it sort of creates an atmosphere of like there is absolutely no reason why you're doing any of this other than to try and get to wizard modes.

[04:16] But there's no narrative. There's no like connective tissue that emotionally brings you into this kind of experience.

[04:23] And I think that's a real problem in the game. And for those of you out there, I heard from Serge, he's like you know some games are all about modes and getting through the modes.

[04:37] And then other games are all about scoring and stacking stuff. And he's like pirates is the best of both of those worlds.

[04:46] And I have to disagree. I think pirates attempts to do both, but ultimately ends up being an utterly confusing, overly complex experience.

[04:58] And that's how I felt when I finished my two hour experience with the game today.

[05:06] And for those of you out there saying, this is the greatest game of all time.

[05:11] I want to just vehemently oppose that kind of feeling. This game is to me the complete opposite of what pinball is supposed to be.

[05:23] Pinball is supposed to be an experience in which within the first few minutes you are accomplishing something.

[05:30] You have a sense of progression, you have a sense of satisfaction. And I think pirate to the Caribbean presents the complete opposite of that kind of feeling.

[05:42] In fact, I think pirate to the Caribbean is more like a role playing game than a pinball machine.

[05:49] And if you think about pinball, see pinball to me needs to be more like Super Mario Bros.

[05:54] The original Super Mario Bros. Okay, do you remember the game? We all do. You run. And within the first few minutes of that game, you're hitting a brick that has a question mark.

[06:06] And you see the little flower come up and you grab the flower and all of a sudden you can shoot fireballs from Mario.

[06:15] That kind of immediate satisfaction pulls you into the experience. For me pinball is very similar to that.

[06:23] That you need to do stuff within the first few minutes that just feels like you're accomplishing something fun and rewarding that you want to do again.

[06:32] And for me, pirate to the Caribbean has none of that. It just doesn't pull you in.

[06:38] You have to understand this complex rule set. You have to understand sort of this approach to pinball that just doesn't give you the immediate satisfaction that I think pinball needs to deliver.

[06:53] And the other thing I'll say about the game as well is I just don't even feel there are that many satisfying shots in the game.

[07:03] And to to surge his defense because you know we've spent a couple hours and he immediately immediately was saying to me how this game wasn't set up properly that that location based pirates is a problem and getting someone to love the machine on location is difficult.

[07:21] And so I see I don't know all I know is this we played pirates a lot and he kept saying that this wasn't working right that this shot wasn't delivering the ball backward should and if only I could play his machine because he owns one pinball machine he owns a pirates.

[07:39] If only I could play his machine that I'd understand what's going on with the game.

[07:43] And then what happened we hopped on every new modern stern monsters L.E. we played monster bash we played dialed in every other game we played played fine but yet pirates the Caribbean didn't play fine and so I don't know what to do other than say this game is really finicky it's very fragile that you know playing on location is difficult.

[08:09] Is that is that good or bad and I think that's the Jersey Jack story is you make a game and the the margin of error in how a game is set up the margin of error and how mechanisms are working is so is so minuscule with these Jersey Jack pirates games that there's a good chance that stuff just isn't working right and apparently the treasure chest wasn't working quite right the rocking ship wasn't working quite right.

[08:38] The you know the scoops were ejecting the balls in a way that he said wasn't the right way compared to his game and I don't know like the consistency of gameplay in this game is really problematic whereas in a stern machine the consistency of gameplay is is is easier to create a consistent experience than it is with pirates.

[09:05] But here's a thing I'm looking at this wide body game and I said this surge you know like where the toys like this game why is it even a wide body.

[09:17] I don't see the reason why this game is being heralded as the greatest game of all time I think it's got a so I think it's got an overly complex code I think what's on the screen is also very complex but then if I just stand back and say well where the toys that are in the game is not working well.

[09:34] Where the toys that are super impressive I don't see them if you remove the rocking upper playfield if you remove that from the game and you look at pirates of the Caribbean and you ask yourself well where are the toys that are magical in this game let's go across the play field and analyze them let's go to the left you got the treasure chest this treasure chest is very very fragile it's very finicky it was it.

[10:03] When the balls go up the center to lock in this treasure chest the balls do this weird thing they sort of like squeeze out it's kind of like you're pushing out a turd and the ball kind of squeezes out to the left sometimes the ball even when it's supposed to lock the ball squeezes out all the way and it doesn't register the lock and it's just this weird feeling like the balls pushing pushing pushing and then thank God when it comes back to the right and it actually locks but it's very awkward.

[10:32] A treasure chest should be a thing that is very secure like it's a chest right you want it to be powerful and strong and just watching that ball squeeze towards the left and push out that that whatever's holding it there it is it is the complete opposite of what I think about in terms of a strong way to lock a ball a strong way to lock a ball the way a treasure chest should feel so there's nothing.

[11:02] To me that's rewarding about that ball lock whatsoever okay all right then you go to the left you've got the the world pool left ramp. All right I mean is that a toy yes maybe kind of you know it's cool when it goes down the funnel for the most part it's really hard to hit that left ramp it it doesn't give me the like the wow satisfaction and that's kind of it when you're done with that there's nothing else really.

[11:32] And then the ball is really in the game that warrants this wide body experience you've got the you've got the modes start that is in the upper sort of upper to the right side of the game and that's where like this little white sort of post shoots up and then the ball is magnetically sent around within these different targets.

[11:55] It's really rewarding about that it's not really cool in you know in comparison to dialed in that has so many magnets that fling the ball around in this magical way because you don't see the magnets I love the fact that there's magnets underneath dialed in playfield that that that wreck havoc on the ball but it's like cool because the balls being grabbed and thrown around in this really interesting way within the middle of gameplay but

[12:21] pirates so strange to me because that white post comes up and a magnet is like throwing the ball around but there's no reason to even care because the post is up there's no consequence of that magnet grabbing the ball it's just up there doing something but who cares because the magnet is it's all the way at the top of the playfield there's the ball can never be thrown into the path of the player it's just locked up there in this like sort of prison cell moving around.

[12:51] For you to watch but there's absolutely no consequence or a randomness that impacts gameplay whatsoever and then you've got the spinning disc and this spinning disc is completely pointless it does absolutely nothing it does absolutely nothing it's it's pointless it's soulless it's meaningless it's just there the spinning

[13:16] disc when we played didn't didn't do anything ever it it never sent the ball down the middle which is good but it also never did anything random and cool that was also that that you're fighting or struggling with it has absolutely zero impact on gameplay and it also has zero impact in terms of the coding and the game itself and so in the middle of this game you've got this toy that is pointless and how can a game that has a pointless game

[13:46] is pointless device and toy that takes up this huge piece of real estate how can that be part of a game that is being heralded as the greatest game of all time and and that's just my overall feeling as I walk away from the game is that it's got this wide body what where that just feels unnecessary and there really aren't many things in the game that make it feel like super special and necessary for a wide body there's no there's no

[14:15] drop targets there's no other mechanism that makes the ball do something magical you know you're really just trying to get through the game it feels like work it does feel like you're chopping wood and surgeon I played this game over and over and over again and yet even with all of our efforts it just didn't feel like we were

[14:39] progressing much through the game in fact the game feels like to progress through it would require really really long ball times okay you know if you want to if you want to understand like that's the

[14:52] reality of owning a pirates when Jack danger and Eric played pirates on his stream they played two four player games and Jack was it took like two and half hours to get through everything

[15:09] for them so that's my takeaway on pirates because we then left pirates and played monster bash and I don't think you could put up the greatest of

[15:22] yesteryears against what is being heralded as the greatest of today and I don't think anybody who just truly loves pinball for what pinball is I don't

[15:33] see how anybody could find more satisfaction in pirates the Caribbean than in monster bash monster bash to me is exactly what pinball should be it's amazingly rewarding shots it's toys that interact with the ball all

[15:51] over the game itself like there's way more toys in that are rewarding to hit in monster bash that in pirates the game lights up you feel like you're going through

[16:00] something you see movement you see the kind of movement that you want to see in pinball when Dracula you know swings across the playfield when Frankenstein comes comes down you're also able to

[16:13] understand what to do in the game simply by looking at the lights and seeing you know the toys interact with the way the lights sort of go into

[16:23] sequence it's so easy to understand you don't need some pointless compass on the apron to tell you what what is the thing to shoot next and pirates the Caribbean like I get it there's a lot to do in the game

[16:37] but does having a lot to do in a pinball machine make a game better and and I disagree that that equals a better more fun pinball experience and maybe I wouldn't be so hard on the game if guys didn't

[16:52] consider this to be the greatest game of all time and in terms of just shot geometry and shot layout pirates the Caribbean is not even nearly as fun to shoot as dialed in and dialed in was a few games down from pirates at sunshine and we played a couple games of dialed in and I have

[17:11] to say immediately off the bat dialed in is so much more rewarding to shoot than pirates of the Caribbean and even if you don't know what you're doing there's a good chance you're going to hit the you know the guy with the lightning bolts above his hands and then all the sudden you'll hit the scoop of the cell phone and a

[17:30] mode will start it's just so much easier to explain to someone what you need to do in dialed in even easier to explain to someone what to do in the monsters which we also played and we got multi balls and we got this

[17:45] that and you know that's my ultimate takeaway I just think pirates of the Caribbean is an overly complex overly engineered game that when you add it all up when you add it all up and you slap the

[18:01] pirates of the Caribbean theme on it it just feels soulless and unrewarding to me now that doesn't mean you're going to feel that way but I walk away from this machine feeling thankful that

[18:17] Jersey Jack is going to move beyond this game pretty quickly I don't think this game is going to go down as a classic I don't think this game is going to go down as the greatest game of all time I think this game is going to go down as a game that lacked vision I think it's going to go down as a game that

[18:38] lacked direction I think it's going to go down as a game that tried to do too much and I think it's going to go down as a game that ultimately really didn't do anything magical within

[18:52] the game ball and I get that you people who own it are loving it and I'm not here to change your mind I'm here to give you my opinion of the game that on some level

[19:06] that the game ball should also be enjoyable approachable and entertaining to those people who play it on location and if the people's facial expressions at sunshine today who were playing pirate the Caribbean were any indication of how enjoyable this game is to flip without having a 15 minute tutorial on how to play it

[19:35] then I don't know what to tell you I think this game completely fails to do it pinball all pinball should do and that is give you some level of immediate gratification because it's pinball this isn't a role playing game this isn't a you know one hour journey this isn't supposed to be that it's supposed to be something that within the first few minutes

[20:03] you're having the time of your life and surgeon I then went and jumped on monsters Ellie we jumped on monster bash we jumped on dialed in we jumped on tails of the Arabian night we jumped on star wars

[20:17] and I'm here to tell you when you go between monsters and pirates of the Caribbean you immediately understand why stern pinball is so successful and why Jersey Jack pinball has struggled all these years I think those two games are great games to go between

[20:38] and stern pinball knows how to make a game that is immediately satisfying and within a few minutes you immediately feel like you've accomplished something stuff is happening in the game and you can you can understand what to do in the game even if you don't have you know a five minute explanation you don't need any of it you can kind of just pick up on what the game is

[21:07] about and I just I just feel like pirates of the Caribbean is going to go down in history as as as a total miss because I think it misses to do it pinball needs to do up front I do understand that it delivers the depth I get it it delivers the depth it delivers the longevity that a lot of you home collectors crave in a machine I understand that I completely get that

[21:36] and I'm sure for many of you it's clicked on that level and once you understand everything there is to understand in the game then you're really excited to walk up to it you know after you've memorized what the 22 characters provide after you understand how to get to the modes and the wizard modes and the multipliers and you understand all of that you've memorized the entire

[22:04] Keith Johnson approach to this game and then you're like excited to tackle it and I'm here to tell you that that's not really pinball that's role playing game that's chess that's math and that's why this game is going to cease being produced come March

[22:27] this is the last month they are making the game and I don't think this game will ever be remade I don't think this game is going to go down as a game that people want to see remade and I think it's going to go down as the worst selling Jersey Jack pinball machine ever and I think that's for a reason and it's not because of what I've said on this show I think consumers and I think people who play this game on location

[22:55] I think they're coming to the conclusion that this game it's just not where we want pinball to be and maybe you disagree maybe you love it and that's great but I think this game is an overly complex mess and I think that I hope that Jersey Jack pinball learns a lesson from Stern that you need to make games more immediately satisfying and I think that's great

[23:24] and then also give the depth that makes them onable for people in their homes and you have to look no further absolutely no further and I'm not saying this because I own it but you have to look no further than Batman 66 and to understand how that you can do both that you can have both of those things happening harmoniously

[23:49] but you can still I mean I was watching a dude just a random dude who had never probably doesn't play pinball he's not great at pinball and he had like the penguin crane going and he was excited and he was hitting and he was having fun

[24:03] you watch the same people walk up to pirates and there's just nothing really moving there's nothing to do there's no way you can get into it.

[24:13] So that's my overall take on pirates of the Caribbean. I really wanted to jump on the machine and feel like my mind would be changed that my mind would be blown that I would finally understand why everyone is who owns one is saying it's the greatest of all time.

[24:28] Instead it solidified my earlier thoughts on the game and I will never own this game I think will he wonka toy story and guns and roses they will all be standard body machines and I think pirates the Caribbean will never be this like sought after classic it had its chance to do that and that's the point I don't get people are already like jumping forward saying this is going to be some rare Jersey Jack game that people are already jumping forward saying this is going to be some rare Jersey Jack game that people are going to be playing the game.

[24:57] I'm here to tell you enough people have played this game enough people have played this game at shows enough people have played this game at people's homes and they are not walking away saying I need to own this game this is a magical game this is a theme I want these are toys I love people are not walking away from this game wow at all and I get that some of you playing it may feel that way but I'm not going to be playing this game.

[25:26] I don't feel that way but I don't feel that way I never will and I'm closing the book I'm closing the book on my opinion of pirates the Caribbean I think it's a complete miss I don't think it's great and I look forward to seeing what's next from Jersey Jack but I have all the Jersey Jack games that have come out to date I think pirates the Caribbean is the worst in terms of my enjoyment of the pinball machine that is just my opinion I do look forward to seeing what I'm going to be playing this game.

[25:55] I look forward to seeing what Eric does next I do look forward to seeing what Keith does next I am rooting heavily for Jersey Jack pinball but this is just not a great pinball machine this is not how you make great pinball it's too complex it's too confusing it's too all over the place and it doesn't even have enough in it to warrant the wide body nature of the game and that's just this episode of canatus pinball podcast if you disagree please.

[26:25] I'm going to be email me at canada pinball edg mill dot com I will happily have you on the show to to run counterpoint and explain why it's such a good game but I just didn't feel it I left feeling like it was a little bit of a soulless numb experience and I think a lot of talented people's talents were wasted or or get like they get suffocated by the way this game is approached and it's just it's just not designed and not laid out.

[26:55] And the lack of narrative ultimately for me sink this game it they push this game off the ship it walks the plank and it will go down as just a mediocre game of couple years from now you'll see you'll see this won't this won't be heralded it as one of the greatest games of all time and I think the call this the greatest game of all time is is the dumbest thing you could possibly say canada out
