[01:00] When I look into your eyes, I can see a love restrained

[01:20] Darling, when I hold you, don't you know I feel the same?

[01:36] Nothing has forever and we both know I can change

[01:52] And it's hard to hold again, no, in the cold, no feel my reach

[02:04] Through this a long, bound time, you're trying to kill the pain

[02:12] No one's coming, no one's going, no one's gonna let it go today

[02:24] Walkin' away, like a sicker, down to lead on the line I can rest my head just no one now you want mine

[02:36] Oh, mine

[02:41] If you want to love me, then darling don't betray

[02:48] For others as I walk in the cold, no better for me

[03:00] Feel me some time, run your own, feel me some time, all alone

[03:16] Oh, everybody needs some time, run your own, don't you know you need some time, all alone

[03:29] No one's hard to keep an open heart, when even friends seem out of you

[03:40] But if you can't get the broken heart, wouldn't die me out, don't you

[04:41] You need some time, let me need some time, all alone

[04:50] Sometimes, let me need some time, all alone

[04:56] Everybody needs some time, run your own, don't you know you need some time, all alone

[05:26] When your fears inside you, and shadows still remain, oh yeah

[05:48] I know that you can love me, when there's no one left to play

[05:58] So never mind the darkness, we're still getting by the way

[06:15] Last forever, even though November rain

[06:45] I know that you can love me, when there's no one left to play

[07:16] Oh, everybody needs some time, all alone

[07:25] Oh, everybody needs some time, all alone

[07:56] Everybody needs some time, all alone

[08:00] No one's hard to keep an open heart, when there's no one left to play

[08:05] Oh, everybody needs some time, all alone

[08:10] Everybody needs some time, all alone

[08:13] No one's hard to keep an open heart, when there's no one left to play

[08:19] Oh, everybody needs some time, all alone

[08:50] I know that you can love me, when there's no one left to play

[08:56] Oh, everybody needs some time, all alone

[09:02] How will that be the moon of friends, and then the sun came crashing in?

[09:10] I know that you can love me, when there's no one left to play

[09:15] Oh, everybody needs some time, all alone

[09:20] I know that you can love me, when there's no one left to play

[09:26] Oh, everybody needs some time, all alone

[09:32] This is gonna be the best day of my life

[09:42] This is gonna be the best day of my life

[09:46] I hear a calling outside my window, I feel it in my soul

[10:08] The stars were burning so bright, the sun was out till midnight

[10:13] I say we lose control

[10:30] This is gonna be the best day of my life

[10:35] This is gonna be the best day of my life

[10:41] This is gonna be the best day of my life

[10:47] This is gonna be the best day of my life

[10:52] Everything is right enough, everybody, I feel it

[10:57] This is gonna be the best day of my life

[11:03] I know I took the path that you would never want for me

[11:10] I know I let you down, did not

[11:15] So many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me

[11:19] Well, I'm just to slave unto the night

[11:23] Now remember when I pulled you, that's the last you see of me

[11:28] Remember when I broke you down the teeth

[11:33] I know I took the path that you would never want for me

[11:37] I gave you hell to all the years

[11:43] So I've been my life, I've been my life

[11:49] I've been my life on you

[12:00] I've been around the world and never in my wildest dreams

[12:06] Would I come running home to you?

[12:10] I've told you millions lies but now I tell a single truth

[12:15] This you and everything I do

[12:19] Now remember when I pulled you, that's the last you see of me

[13:09] And left you on your own

[13:12] And please believe them when they say that it's left for us today

[13:17] And the records that I play, please forgive me for all I've done

[13:30] So I've been my life, I've been my life

[31:13] I don't know where I'll be in my own, that depends where I lay my head tonight

[31:23] No matter where I go, I'm always thinking about them contrary rules

[31:31] L.A. is cool, New York's great, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere but my own state

[31:36] And I'm going everywhere, but everywhere as a compare to the thrill's

[31:40] Beverly don't want to talk about hills, bone and race, in the 304 where everybody tries to drink till they can't know more

[31:46] No matter where I be at on the globe, I'm singing this to everybody knows

[31:50] And no matter what direction I'm at it, I know I've been a camarader home

[31:54] If I leave I'll come back again, been around the map, but wherever I'm at, it's for bus

[31:58] Got a West Virginia, welcome, master that's that ain't I'm going to place that pride

[32:02] Just a West Virginia kid, but we gon' where a wide if you are

[32:05] From there you and no I feel, think I have my first beer inside of my near feel on

[32:10] I don't know where I'll be in my own, that depends where I lay my head tonight

[32:20] No matter where I go, I'm always thinking about them country roads

[32:29] Oh, Texas cool, DC's great, but I never want to be anywhere but my own state

[32:34] And lately I've been on the road, but I've been on the road to feel like everywhere

[32:37] I go, I lose another little piece of my soul, growing up I never thought I'd leave this life

[32:41] But now I'm running around the nation like I'm fat white

[32:44] And no matter where I be going tonight, I'm always right from going to blue stripes

[32:48] The one thing I was top in the start, I don't need a big city because I got big heart

[32:53] Never knew what it meant to laugh in a mean, but it helped to battle me into the person you see

[32:58] I hold a lot to the place on its race, I just pray that I find my way back one day

[33:03] If you were from there you would know I feel, I'd do anything to see them wide and wonderful hills

[33:08] I don't know where I'll be tomorrow, that depends where I lay my head tonight

[33:19] No matter where I go, I'm always thinking about them country roads

[33:28] Everywhere that I go, all the places I've been

[33:33] Don't compare to my home, they say it's almost heaven

[33:38] That's why I never wanna leave small town, but it got everything that I love and needing you

[33:42] Never know what you have until it's gone, and that's why I wrote this song

[33:47] That's why I never wanna leave small town, but it got everything that I love and need

[33:52] And if I do got to say goodbye, that's cool, just know my first song is by my high school

[33:56] I'm going to take a look, take me home, to a place I belong

[34:05] Where's your genuine mouth, and my heart, take me home country roads

[34:16] I don't know where I'll be tomorrow, that depends where I lay my head tonight

[34:27] No matter where I go, I'm always thinking about them country roads

[37:30] I take a tip-on, deret, and I watch a skate, I mean what a ski, Ali Ali oxen fruit

[37:35] I'm cruising down forth and they watching me, I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat, well hello

[37:39] But baby, the kicks don't ain't free, nothing you or do you not, when I ride with me

[37:43] I got one girl, I got two wills, she a big girl, but in a big deal, I like a big girl

[37:48] I like a sassy, going down a back street, listening to black street, running around the whole town

[37:54] Neighbors yelling at me like you need to slow down, going 38, damn, chill the buck out

[37:59] Moke your damn lawn and sit the hell down

[38:01] I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you

[38:05] Cruising down, bro, wait girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view

[38:09] There's layers to the shit player, tear my suit, tear my suit

[38:13] Let my coat tail drag, but I ain't tear my suits, tear my suits

[38:18] Don't town, don't town, don't town, don't town, don't town

[38:28] She has arms and roll away most, you're the balance that we keep in sight

[38:37] Can you ever bump the woman, baby, I'm gonna let her sit between the legs

[38:45] Don't town, you don't wanna be boy, no I wanna street's boy, better follow me to a downtown

[38:55] Don't you feel it's what you get, girls, don't ever forget, girl, it's nothing yet until you're downtown

[39:05] You don't wanna be, no I wanna street's boy, better follow me to a downtown

[39:14] Don't you feel it's what you get, girls, don't ever forget, girl, it's nothing yet until you're downtown

[39:23] I was left to my own diva, our eyes, many days fall away with nothing to show

[39:43] And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love

[39:50] Great clouds all over the hills, bringing darkness from above

[39:58] But if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

[40:07] And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing, baby, I'm a boy

[40:15] How am I gonna beat up to miss the ball this?

[40:19] How am I gonna beat up to miss the ball this?

[40:24] We were caught up and lost in all of our vices

[40:30] In your pearls, is the dust settled around us

[40:37] And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love

[40:45] Great clouds all over the hills, bringing darkness from above

[40:53] But if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

[41:00] And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like you, baby, I'm a boy

[41:09] How am I gonna beat up to miss the ball this?

[41:13] How am I gonna beat up to miss the ball this?

[41:24] Where do we begin? The rubble or our sins?

[41:32] Where do we begin? The rubble or our sins?

[41:39] And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love

[41:47] Great clouds all over the hills, bringing darkness from above

[41:54] But if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

[42:02] And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like you, baby, I'm a boy

[42:11] How am I gonna beat up to miss the ball this?

[42:18] How am I gonna beat up to miss the ball this?

[42:21] If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

[42:29] Feel my way through the darkness, got it by beating hard

[42:41] I think tell where the journey will end, but I know where to start

[42:49] They tell me I'm too young to understand, they say I'm caught up in a dream

[42:58] Well I will pass by if I don't open up my eyes, so that's fine by me

[43:04] So wake me up when it's all over, when I'm wise I ran out of molding

[43:12] All this time I was finding myself in love, didn't know I was lost

[43:21] I think tell where the journey will end, but I know where to start

[43:26] They tell me I'm too young to understand, they say I'm caught up in a dream

[43:33] I think tell where the journey will end, but I know where to start

[44:03] I try to carry in the weight of the world, but I only have two hands

[44:31] Hope I get the chance to travel the world, but I don't have any plans

[44:38] Wish that I could stay forever this year, not afraid to close my eyes

[44:46] Life's a game made for everyone, and love is a prize

[44:54] So wake me up when it's all over, when I'm wise I ran out of molding

[45:00] All this time I was finding myself in love, didn't know I was lost

[45:08] So wake me up when it's all over, when I'm wise I ran out of molding

[45:16] All this time I was finding myself in love, didn't know I was lost

[45:24] I didn't know I was lost, I didn't know I was lost

[45:32] I didn't know I was lost, I didn't know I was lost

[45:46] When I was a boy I dreamed I'd be a place in the sky, playing in the fields

[46:15] B all the way to my shoes, and I'd be a place in the sky

[46:22] I wish I could see this world again through those eyes

[46:28] See the child of me in my fantasy, never growing old

[46:36] Will we ever feel young again?

[46:43] Will we ever feel young again?

[46:51] Will we ever feel young again?

[46:58] Will we ever feel young again?

[47:28] When I was a boy I searched for a world that's unknown

[47:57] All we have is fun, everybody runs until the sun goes down

[48:04] I wish I could see this world again through those eyes

[48:12] See the child of me in my fantasy, never growing old

[48:20] Will we ever feel young again?

[48:26] Will we ever feel young again?

[48:34] Will we ever feel young again?

[48:41] Will we ever feel young again?

[49:11] Will we ever feel young again?

[49:42] Nobody here knocking at my door

[49:48] The sound of sight and I can take it more

[49:55] Nobody bringing my telephone now

[50:02] Oh, how I miss such a beautiful sound

[50:09] And I don't even know how I survive

[50:15] I won't make it to the shore without your light

[50:21] No, I don't even know if I'm alive

[50:28] Oh, without you now, this is what I feel like

[51:08] I've been to home but the memories and frames

[51:15] Oh, they remind me of the battle I face

[51:21] Without you, I try

[51:28] Somebody save me, I'm going down

[51:34] And I don't even know how I survive

[51:40] I won't make it to the shore without your light

[51:46] No, I don't even know if I'm alive

[51:52] Oh, without you now, this is what I feel like

[52:04] I've been to home but the memories and frames

[52:11] Oh, without you now, this is what I feel like

[52:18] I've been to home but the memories and frames

[52:25] Oh, without you now, this is what I feel like

[52:31] I won't make it to the shore without your light

[52:38] No, I don't even know if I'm alive

[52:43] Oh, without you now, this is what I feel like

[52:51] I've stayed up at the sun

[52:58] I stayed up just to see

[53:05] But all of the faces could do the one next to me

[53:11] You can feel the light and start to tremble

[53:15] Watchin' what you know out to see

[53:18] If you can see life out the window tonight

[53:26] If I lose myself tonight, it'll be by your side

[53:33] If I lose myself tonight

[53:40] If I lose myself tonight, it'll be you and I

[53:47] If I lose myself tonight

[53:54] I woke up with the sun

[54:17] And I woke up with the sun

[54:23] The light of all of the people places and things I've loved

[54:31] I woke up just to see

[54:34] With all of the faces you were the one next to me

[54:41] You can feel the light and start to tremble

[54:45] If I were to be known tonight

[54:52] If I lose myself tonight

[54:56] It will be by your side

[54:59] I lose myself tonight

[55:06] If I lose myself tonight

[55:10] It will be you and I

[55:13] It will lose myself tonight

[55:33] If you just stop and keep trying

[55:36] If we are to be fine

[55:40] It will be just by your side

[55:43] If we are to be fine

[55:46] If someone just stand and keep me shining

[55:50] So they'll be alive

[55:51] If you will remember

[55:54] My father told me when I was just a child

[55:57] These are the nights to never die

[56:01] My father told me one day

[56:03] You'll live this world behind

[56:05] So they'll be alive

[56:07] If you will remember

[56:09] My father told me when I was just a child

[56:13] These are the nights to never die

[56:16] My father told me once upon a young age

[56:19] When all our shadows disappeared

[56:21] The animals and sight came out to play

[56:24] When face to face with all our fears

[56:27] Learned our lessons through the tears

[56:29] Made memories when you would never fade

[56:32] One day my father told me

[56:34] So I don't let this slip away

[56:36] It's the day that I'm tired of saying

[56:39] You get older, you're wild

[56:42] I will live for you, I'm getting days

[56:44] Think it's every other phrase

[56:47] He said one day

[56:49] You'll live this world behind

[56:51] So they'll be alive

[56:52] If you will remember

[56:55] My father told me when I was just a child

[56:58] These are the nights to never die

[57:02] My father told me

[57:28] So I don't let this slip away

[57:30] It's the day that I'm tired of saying

[57:32] You get older, you're wild

[57:34] I will live for you, I'm getting days

[57:38] Think it's every other phrase

[57:40] Learned our lessons through the tears

[57:42] Made memories when you would never die

[57:44] My father told me when I was just a child

[57:46] These are the nights to never die

[57:48] My father told me once upon a young age

[57:50] When all our shadows disappeared

[57:52] The animals and sight came out to play

[57:54] When face to face with all our fears

[57:56] Learned our lessons through the tears

[57:57] Made memories when you would never die

[57:59] My father told me when I was just a child

[58:01] These are the nights to never die

[58:03] My father told me

[58:27] These are the nights to never die

[58:33] My father told me

[58:57] My father said one day

[59:05] You'll live this world behind

[59:07] Cause I'll live a life

[59:09] You will remember

[59:11] My father told me when I was just a child

[59:15] These are the nights to never die

[59:17] It's been a long day

[59:21] Without you, my friend

[59:23] Tell me tell you all about it

[59:25] Can't see you again

[59:27] Come along the way

[59:31] Where we began

[59:33] I'll tell you all about it

[59:35] When I see you again

[59:37] When I see you again

[59:39] Damn, you know

[59:43] All the planes we flew

[59:45] Good things we been through

[59:47] They'll not be standing right here talking to you

[59:49] About another bad

[59:51] And what if we just go to lab

[59:53] Or something for me that it wouldn't last

[59:55] And to switch up

[59:57] Looking things different see the bigger picture

[59:59] Those were the days

[01:00:01] Hard work for ever pays

[01:00:03] Now I see you in a better place

[01:00:05] See you in a better place

[01:00:07] How can we not talk about family

[01:00:09] My family's all that we got

[01:00:13] And now you're going to be with me for the last ride

[01:00:27] But I'll see you again

[01:00:49] Fresh and both go

[01:00:51] Watch your way in the back

[01:00:53] It's feeling stronger with small turn to a friendship

[01:00:55] A friendship turn to a bond

[01:00:57] And that bond will never be broken

[01:00:59] The level never can last

[01:01:01] And what brother will come first

[01:01:03] And the land will never be crossed

[01:01:05] The stab is still on our own

[01:01:07] When that land had to be drawn in that land

[01:01:09] It's what we reach

[01:01:11] So remember me when I'm gone

[01:01:13] How can we not talk about family

[01:01:15] When family's all that we got

[01:01:17] And now you're going to be with me for the last ride

[02:20:41] Oh, oh, red wine, gone through your doubts

[02:20:48] Oh, oh, I've had a little bit too much of fun

[02:20:54] All of the people start to rush and to run away

[02:20:58] Oh, as it twists the dance, can't buy my drink on land

[02:21:02] Where all my cheese I love my phone, phone, phone

[02:21:06] Oh, what's going on in front of the door

[02:21:10] I love to speak with baby, but I can't be sweet

[02:21:13] And it's all worth it, it's all worth the name of the love

[02:21:18] I can't remember, but it's alright, alright

[02:21:21] Just be okay, just be okay, not a true love

[02:22:08] Wish I could shut my playboy mouth

[02:22:11] I got to my certain side out, inside out

[02:22:15] Control your poison, baby, for there's a lonely day

[02:22:19] And we all get in homes tonight

[02:22:23] Oh, what's going on?

[02:22:25] And what's going on?

[02:22:27] I love to spend my baby, but I can't be sweet

[02:22:30] And it's all worth it, it's all worth it

[02:22:33] And it's all worth it, it's all worth it

[02:22:35] And it's all worth it, it's all worth it

[02:22:38] Stay in touch, wait till the day you leave

[02:22:43] Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop

[02:23:25] And we have to say that you got so much to do

[02:23:29] The way you're twirling up the minutes from the round

[02:23:32] And we're still there for you, we'll wait till you leave

[02:23:36] And for me, toss it, and we'll be back to waiting now

[02:23:39] Yeah!

[02:23:41] Baby, baby, it's all worth it, it's all worth it

[02:23:45] Baby, baby, it's all worth it, it's all worth it

[02:24:06] Baby, baby, it's all worth it

[02:24:10] Baby, baby, it's all worth it, we'll be back to waiting

[02:24:14] For the two of us to live

[02:24:17] Yeah!

[02:24:18] Stay in your life, be my love

[02:24:22] Baby, baby, it's all worth it

[02:24:24] Yeah!

[02:24:25] Baby, baby, it's all worth it, we'll be back to waiting

[02:24:29] For the two of us to live

[02:24:32] Yeah!

[02:24:33] Baby, baby, it's all worth it, it's all worth it

[02:24:36] Baby, baby, it's all worth it, it's all worth it

[02:24:39] She was more like a baby queen, from a movie scene

[02:24:43] I shared the mind, but what could do you mean I am the one

[02:24:48] Who danced on the floor in the round?

[02:24:53] She said I am the one, who danced on the floor in the round?

[02:25:03] She told me her name could be a queen, as she calls to sing

[02:25:08] Then every year turned with the eyes to dream of being the one

[02:25:13] Who danced on the floor in the round?

[02:25:19] People always told me, be careful what you do

[02:25:23] Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts

[02:25:27] And my brother always told me, I beg you, I'm who you love

[02:25:31] I beg you what you want, I can't live, I can't want you

[02:25:36] Baby, baby, it's all worth it, we'll be back to waiting

[02:25:40] For the two of us to live

[02:25:43] Yeah!

[02:25:45] But the chair doesn't have my son

[02:25:50] She says I am the one, but the chair doesn't have my son

[02:25:57] We can feel all alone before the days and before the nights

[02:26:04] I was on a side, but who can stand when he's in the manners?

[02:26:08] He's in the balance, but the dance on the floor in the round?

[02:26:13] Something might stroke advice, just remember to always stay twice

[02:26:22] Don't dance twice, she told my baby, there's two, three

[02:26:28] She looked at me and then she would have moved away

[02:26:31] Baby, pride and pride, it would have been like mine

[02:26:34] Don't I know, you're going dance on the floor in the round, baby

[02:26:40] Baby, all of us told me, be careful what you do

[02:26:45] Don't go around, bring us down girls' hearts

[02:26:49] Don't ring me, we should keep this still right behind me

[02:26:52] I just smell us, we don't feel, I can't see anyone's smile

[02:26:56] I should fall in love, hey, the baby changes, not my love

[02:27:02] She just together, can't know the girl I love

[02:27:08] Baby, the baby changes, not my son

[02:27:15] Baby, the baby changes, not my love

[02:27:19] She just together, can't know the girl I love

[02:27:24] Baby, the baby changes

[02:27:38] She was a fast machine, she kept them all in her place

[02:27:45] She was a fast and womaned, I keep them all in her place

[02:27:49] She had the same size, tell them in her life

[02:27:53] Knock on the out for those American thighs, take them all in a shell

[02:27:58] Have me find it for her, she told it had come, but I was already there

[02:28:04] Cause the world's got chicken, the hell was quaking my mouth was aching

[02:28:10] We were thinking, we were new, should be all I know

[02:28:19] Yeah, you should be all I know

[02:28:27] Welcome double time on the seduction floor

[02:28:30] She was one of the kinds of just men I'm back

[02:28:34] One of no applause, just another cold

[02:28:38] Man, be a lot of me, I come back by my boy

[02:28:42] Had to cool my doubts, to take them all around

[02:28:45] Now I'm back in the ring, to take another sweet and death

[02:28:50] The walls were shaking, the earth was quaking my bones was aching

[02:28:55] We were thinking, we were new, should be all I know

[02:29:04] Yeah, you should be all I know

[02:29:10] And I can be all the best you, should be all I know

[02:29:18] Yeah, you should be all I know

[02:29:26] Yeah, you should be all I know

[02:29:36] I came up first real sick string, loaded up the fire and done

[02:29:42] Played it till my fingers bled, was it summer of 1969

[02:29:49] To be here, some guys from school, had a bad end, we tied real hard

[02:29:56] To be quick, Jody got married, should've known, we never get far

[02:30:03] Oh, when I'm back now, the time I seen the last forever

[02:30:10] And if I had the choice, yeah, those won't open it

[02:30:17] Those were the best days of my life

[02:30:28] Ain't no use saying complaining, when you got a job you do

[02:30:34] Still might miss down at the top end, and that's when I'm until you

[02:30:41] Standin' on your mama's porch, you told me that you wait for me

[02:30:48] Oh, when I hear my hymn, I knew that it was not one never

[02:30:55] Those were the best days of my life

[02:31:01] Oh yeah, back in the summer of 1969

[02:31:12] Man, we're killing time, we're really on your restless

[02:31:17] We're meeting two and one

[02:31:20] I guess nothing can last forever, forever

[02:31:31] And now the times are changing, look at everything is coming down

[02:31:37] Time's around, we got old six dreams, take a picture of the one when wrong

[02:31:44] Standin' on your mama's porch, you told me that you lost forever

[02:31:52] Oh, when I hear my hymn, I knew that it was not one never

[02:31:57] Those were the best days of my life

[02:32:03] Oh yeah, back in the summer of 1969

[02:32:11] Man, we're killing time, we're really on our restless

[02:32:16] We're killing time, we're killing time, we're killing time

[02:32:22] They're back in the summer of 1969

[02:32:27] Now I am at a payphone Now I am at a payphone

[02:32:36] Now I am at a payphone

[02:33:16] I've been sick of this smile that it seems to me reminds me of childhood memories, where

[02:33:34] everything was impressed as a bright blue sky.

[02:33:41] Now in them when I see a face it makes me wait a lot special place and if I stay too long I'll probably

[02:33:51] break down and cry.

[02:34:21] You got eyes of the blue skies and you fade from the rain.

[02:34:33] I hate to look into those eyes and see your gowns fade.

[02:34:42] But every mouth still belongs to a place where as and child I die and pray for the thunder and the rain can fly in the faster light.

[02:34:57] Oh, oh, oh, we just find...

[02:35:03] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

[02:48:20] I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:48:24] I wanna feel the heat with somebody

[02:48:44] Yeah, I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:48:48] With somebody who loves me

[02:48:56] Lots of strengths are running out

[02:49:00] And the sun begins to fade

[02:49:04] I'm still in a time to figure out

[02:49:08] How to chase my blues away

[02:49:12] I'm gonna ride up to now

[02:49:16] It's the light of day that shows me how

[02:49:20] And when the night falls

[02:49:24] Loneliness comes

[02:49:26] Oh, I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:49:30] I wanna feel the heat with somebody

[02:49:34] Yeah, I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:49:38] With somebody who loves me

[02:49:50] Yeah, I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:49:54] With somebody who loves me

[02:50:02] I didn't love and lost my senses

[02:50:06] Spin through the town

[02:50:10] Sino-relate to the fear of ins

[02:50:14] And I find a feeling down

[02:50:18] I need a man to take the chance

[02:50:22] On the love that burns high enough to last

[02:50:26] So when the night falls, my lonely heart falls

[02:50:32] Oh, I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:50:36] I wanna feel the heat with somebody

[02:50:40] Yeah, I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:50:44] With somebody who loves me

[02:50:48] Oh, I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:50:52] I wanna feel the heat

[02:50:56] To the end of the dance, somebody

[02:51:00] With somebody who loves me

[02:51:04] Oh, I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:51:08] With somebody who loves me

[02:51:12] With somebody who loves me

[02:51:14] Oh, I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:51:16] To hold me here, here's my song

[02:51:20] I knew that when the night falls

[02:51:24] I wanna love and lose my senses

[02:51:26] Spin through the town

[02:51:28] Sino-relate to the fear of ins

[02:51:32] And I find a feeling down

[02:51:34] I need a man to take the chance

[02:51:36] On the love that burns high enough to last

[02:51:38] So when the night falls, my lonely heart falls

[02:51:42] Oh, I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:51:46] I wanna feel the heat with somebody

[02:51:50] With somebody

[02:52:20] With somebody who loves me

[02:52:24] Oh, I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:52:36] With somebody who loves me

[02:52:40] Oh, I'm a dancer, somebody

[02:52:44] I wanna feel the heat with somebody

[02:52:48] Yeah, we're dead with somebody

[02:52:53] With somebody we love

[02:52:56] We love, we're dead with somebody

[02:53:01] I'm gonna be with you, we're dead with somebody

[02:53:05] Yeah, we're dead with somebody

[02:53:09] With somebody we love

[02:53:22] We're saving

[02:53:25] With somebody we love

[02:53:28] Yeah, we're saving, don't want to

[02:53:31] See you somewhere in a place to find

[02:53:43] When you want me, give me a sign

[02:53:46] And kids were breathing even closer

[02:53:58] I'm touching the ground

[02:54:00] I'm on the hunt, I'm out of the youth

[02:54:04] Smell like a sound

[02:54:05] I'm lost in the crowd

[02:54:07] I'm down hungry like the wolf

[02:54:11] Staring at the rain

[02:54:13] And disco and rhyme

[02:54:15] I'm on the hunt, I'm out of the youth

[02:54:18] Now this is alive

[02:54:20] Just as I'm flying

[02:54:22] And now I'm hungry like the wolf

[02:54:31] Start through the forest

[02:54:32] To close the high

[02:54:35] I'll be a plonk, you'll find a way my side

[02:54:46] I have my drum and my knees hidden so tight

[02:54:49] If you're mahidim just a moment behind

[02:55:01] And touch with the ground

[02:55:03] I'm on the hunt, I'm out of the youth

[02:55:07] Smell like a sound

[02:55:08] I'm lost in the crowd

[02:55:10] And I'm hungry like the wolf

[02:55:14] Just go to the night, just go to the prime

[02:55:17] I'll have no way that I'll master you

[02:55:21] Now is the light, all right inside

[02:55:24] And I'm hungry like the wolf

[02:55:44] Go in the ground, I'll break through the crowd

[02:55:50] I'm on the hunt, I'm left, I you

[02:55:54] I spell like a sound, I'm lost and I found

[02:55:57] And I'm hungry like the wolf

[02:56:01] Just go to the night, just go to the prime

[02:56:05] I'm on the hunt, I'm left, I you

[02:56:09] Now is the light, just as I'm right

[02:56:12] And I'm hungry like the wolf

[02:56:17] Go in the ground, I'll break through the crowd

[02:56:20] I'm on the hunt, I'm left, I you

[02:56:24] I spell like a sound, I'm lost and I found

[02:56:27] And I'm hungry like the wolf

[02:56:31] Just go to the prime, I'm hungry like the wolf

[02:56:42] If you don't live now, please don't see me

[02:57:11] All the way, I promise you

[02:57:14] Just one more night, we'll go on a separate way

[02:57:20] We always have time on our sides

[02:57:24] Now it's fading fast

[02:57:28] Every second, every moment

[02:57:32] We've got to, we've got to make it last

[02:57:36] Touching words, touching twice

[02:57:40] I won't let go, I'll never leave my sight

[02:57:44] And you will, I'll never leave you

[02:57:48] You always said, we'll still be friends someday

[02:57:56] If you don't live now, I won't rest

[02:58:02] We'll sing a day, but if you don't look back

[02:58:09] I'll be running the other way

[02:58:12] Seven hills, well under the bridge

[02:58:16] Black time, standing still

[02:58:20] No one knows what happens now

[02:58:24] You've got to, you've got to stay with us

[02:58:28] Touching words, touching twice

[02:58:32] I won't let go, I'll never leave my sight

[02:58:36] And you will, I'll never leave you

[02:58:40] You always said, we'll still be friends someday
