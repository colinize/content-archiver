[00:00] But if you close your eyes,

[00:02] there's a thousand moments to be like nothing,

[00:06] change that all.

[00:07] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪

[00:13] Welcome to episode 310 of Canatus Pimball Podcast,

[00:17] Omnirohost, Canada.

[00:18] This is the only Pimball Podcast that runs on node boards,

[00:22] and we're gonna jump right into it.

[00:24] It's been a busy week.

[00:25] It always is in Pimball, and this is the podcast

[00:28] you go to for the gossip, the news, the rumors.

[00:31] We're gonna talk everything that has gone on in the last few days.

[00:34] Andrew Highway has resurfaced.

[00:36] A Pimball machine has been stolen.

[00:39] A five pack of Pimballs is now $10.

[00:43] Stop the press.

[00:44] Head to head Pimballs back without Ryan.

[00:47] My God, I hope he comes back soon.

[00:50] Nate Shivers returned interviewing GeneX Wong.

[00:53] Oh, man, I thought it would be some bigger personality

[00:56] in the Pimball world, but anyway, here we are on episode 310,

[01:00] and let's jump right into it.

[01:02] So here's what I wanna talk about first on this episode.

[01:05] I wanna talk about a Chicago gaming company.

[01:08] They responded to the decals and the splitting cabinets

[01:12] that people are reporting on the Monster Bash remake.

[01:15] Now, it turns out that the cabinets are not splitting.

[01:19] The issue on the game, and they've said this,

[01:21] it's affected 1% or less of games they've sent out.

[01:26] They believe the issue has to do with the cold weather

[01:30] and shipping these games in cold weather

[01:33] and wrapping the decal around the front of the cabinet

[01:37] is causing the decal to shrink a little into that seam.

[01:42] So it's not the wood splitting as some people are worried about.

[01:46] And so they have solved the problem by simply

[01:50] not wrapping the decal around the cabinet,

[01:53] and they believe that will prevent it

[01:55] from creating that sort of that line in the decal

[01:58] that people are noticing.

[01:59] And I assume they will send people new decals

[02:02] who have experienced that problem,

[02:03] but good to see Chicago gaming company

[02:07] are responding to people who are having issues with that.

[02:09] So that is the latest on that issue.

[02:12] Let's go on to spooky Pimball.

[02:14] Where is Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle?

[02:17] It's the game that just keeps on not wanting

[02:19] to actually get to customers.

[02:21] We know they have a bunch in box.

[02:23] We know they're about to go out to people,

[02:26] but man, spooky has really tested the patience

[02:30] of buyers of this game.

[02:31] Have they not?

[02:32] I mean, it will be in March, which is next month.

[02:36] It will be one year since this title was revealed,

[02:40] a full year.

[02:42] And I have not seen many people unbox this game.

[02:45] And the majority of 2019 is just gonna be this game

[02:49] going out because they're backlogged.

[02:52] They owe people these games.

[02:53] And so that is where we're at.

[02:56] Do you wanna cry about something?

[02:58] If you took the $1,000 that you gave to spooky Pimball

[03:02] as a non-refundable deposit,

[03:05] and you bet that the LA Rams would only score three points

[03:10] in the Super Bowl.

[03:11] Do you know how much money you would have?

[03:13] A $1,000 bet would net you in your account

[03:17] for $100,000.

[03:20] Isn't that incredible?

[03:21] I saw that because there was a new story

[03:23] where it dude bet $250 and won $100,000 back on it.

[03:27] Incredible.

[03:28] Hindsight is always 2020.

[03:30] Okay, so spooky, we'll see what's going on over there.

[03:33] It's not like them to be so delinquent

[03:35] on getting people games in a timely manner,

[03:37] but this has happened.

[03:39] And you know, we'll see if the game is worth it.

[03:41] That's the one thing we're looking to see.

[03:43] American Pimball, where the fuck is October fest?

[03:47] Every month we get further and further from October,

[03:51] it becomes a real head scratcher

[03:53] as to why they revealed this game at Expo.

[03:55] If you think about it, and I know,

[03:57] I get people keep saying, I'm unfair to American Pimball

[04:01] and I'm gonna read some of your emails

[04:02] and people have called me out on that as well.

[04:04] I'm unfair to these guys.

[04:05] I'm not giving them a shot.

[04:06] They, Keneda, you're so gowning out on American Pimball.

[04:10] So what was, tell me, what was the strategy

[04:12] to bring the game out in October

[04:14] and reveal it to the world?

[04:15] And you know, okay.

[04:17] So October was five months ago.

[04:19] So you revealed a game five months ago,

[04:22] and then what do you do?

[04:23] Have you continued to keep this game top of mind

[04:26] out there in the Pimball world?

[04:28] Have you continued to excite people

[04:30] by showing them the game?

[04:31] I almost forget what it even shoots like

[04:33] because I haven't seen anything.

[04:35] I haven't seen any, if they've made any improvements

[04:38] to the shot geometry, I don't know what is going on

[04:40] with this game.

[04:41] I assume they're gonna bring it to T-P-F

[04:43] to show it again, reveal number two.

[04:46] I hope they come back with an all new art package.

[04:50] I've seen the latest cabinet artwork design.

[04:52] We've all seen that, but I really don't understand it.

[04:55] I really don't understand how you just go

[04:57] five months dark on a game.

[04:59] And you know, this is just where we're at.

[05:02] This is how these companies have decided

[05:04] to reveal their titles.

[05:05] And again, I think I'm gonna be accurate in saying that

[05:10] they're not gonna be able to get the hype back.

[05:12] And I think that revealing it number again at T-P-F,

[05:17] it better blow people away.

[05:18] They're better not be, artwork that is not appealing,

[05:22] they're better not be animations that look bad.

[05:24] They've had another five months to polish the game.

[05:26] So hopefully it comes back.

[05:28] And it has to be like take my money now kind of experience.

[05:31] And you know, but again, it's gonna be like,

[05:34] it's gonna be the freaking spring summer

[05:36] by the time they're shipping October fest.

[05:38] I don't get it.

[05:40] Anyway, all right, Stern of the Union in February,

[05:43] ironic that we got the Stern of the Union

[05:45] sort of at the same time of the presidential state

[05:48] of the Union.

[05:49] So did anything interesting happen

[05:51] in the Stern of the Union of Dress?

[05:53] I say this on the new website, the Stern of the Union,

[05:57] has become more about, it's almost like a full blog post,

[06:01] sort of recap of everything going on at Stern.

[06:04] They talk about monsters at CES.

[06:06] They talk about the monsters launch parties.

[06:09] They talk about the Stern army updates.

[06:11] Like apparently, this is, you know, these generals

[06:14] in the Stern army, you get like promoted from a private

[06:17] to a private first class to a specialist.

[06:20] And it's kind of nice recognition of all the people out there

[06:23] that are putting Stern Pimbal machines on location

[06:26] that are hosting league nights.

[06:28] I do like the fact that they recognize those people

[06:30] in such a way.

[06:32] The Stern Pro Circuit Championship is happening.

[06:35] Really cool poster by Zambi Yeti.

[06:37] That Stern has put out there.

[06:40] And let me see, it's on March 9th.

[06:42] So it's like the 40 best Pimbal players in the world.

[06:45] I was 41 this year.

[06:47] So apparently I won't be invited to be a part of it.

[06:51] But Jack Janger is going to stream it.

[06:53] So if you guys are into the tournament Pimbal,

[06:54] that March 9th is a day to look out for.

[06:57] Let's see what else is going on in the world of Pimbal

[07:00] in the Stern of the Union of Dress.

[07:03] You know, some of it, they were at the X Games.

[07:05] I didn't notice that.

[07:06] I guess JJ set up some pins.

[07:07] The Deadpool Ellie vinyl albums are finally shipping.

[07:11] Once again, it's finally the Deadpool topper is out.

[07:14] And now the vinyl record is out.

[07:15] How many months ago was it?

[07:17] Six months ago the game came out.

[07:19] Way to really have those assets and those things

[07:22] ready to go with the game launch guys, terrific, whatever.

[07:26] I mean, whatever.

[07:27] Who even has a record player?

[07:29] I mean, I don't know.

[07:30] Again, this is Pimbal collect.

[07:31] There was a they probably do.

[07:33] So the status of code, that's always like the big thing.

[07:35] So here's the deals.

[07:36] Deadpool, the latest code is version 0.98.

[07:40] And it is interactive with the topper.

[07:42] So if you have a topper, make sure you get that new code.

[07:45] The Beatles has new code coming this month.

[07:48] The monsters, the team continues to work on the next code

[07:51] release.

[07:52] This is everyone's favorite.

[07:54] This one, the next one.

[07:55] Ghostbusters code update is delayed,

[07:58] but remains in our schedule.

[08:01] The source spot of Ghostbusters code update

[08:04] continues to be unbelievable.

[08:06] How long ago did Ghostbusters come out?

[08:10] Was it like two years ago, at least, maybe longer?

[08:14] And you're still not done with the game.

[08:17] We know Dwight is working on the monsters.

[08:19] So he's clearly not working on Ghostbusters.

[08:22] You know what, I would love to see happen.

[08:24] I would love for Lyman Sheets to come in and polish Ghostbusters.

[08:29] I don't I think he's done that before where he comes in.

[08:32] And on top of someone else's code sort of brings it home

[08:36] in a unique and fun way.

[08:37] Has he?

[08:38] I think he has.

[08:40] And why not?

[08:41] I mean, he's a coder.

[08:42] Can he just simply polish out what needs to be polished

[08:46] and do what needs to be done in that game?

[08:47] But I don't know.

[08:49] As a creative, though, too, I'd never

[08:51] like inheriting someone else's work and having to fix it.

[08:55] But this Ghostbusters, I don't know if it needs fixing as much

[08:58] as it just needs to be finished.

[09:00] And people who have that game have been waiting

[09:02] a long time.

[09:03] Speaking of Ghostbusters,

[09:04] there's an Ellie for sale for like $7,300

[09:07] in really nice condition.

[09:08] If you want it, Ghostbusters remains the game

[09:11] that I look at.

[09:12] I just want to I want to want it.

[09:14] I really want to want it more than I do.

[09:17] And the reason why I don't want it,

[09:19] because I played it, it's it's turns best visual game

[09:23] of all time without a doubt.

[09:25] I would look over that game and it gets me so excited.

[09:28] And then you flip and I can't.

[09:31] I wish they would just remake Ghostbusters.

[09:33] I wish they would have someone go over that game

[09:35] and redesign it.

[09:36] They'll never do it because Ghostbusters sold so well.

[09:39] And the people who bought the Trudeau version

[09:42] would basically burn the company down.

[09:44] But it probably was, it is the greatest pinball theme

[09:50] and the theme that lends itself the best to pinball.

[09:54] I think almost ever.

[09:56] And with the music, with the fun factor,

[09:59] the state puff man, everything in it, like slimer,

[10:02] it's perfect for pinball.

[10:04] And it just sucks that the final,

[10:06] the only Ghostbusters game we will ever get

[10:09] just shoots like shit.

[10:11] And there's just nothing you can change.

[10:12] There's nothing you can do about it.

[10:14] All right, so that's turn of the union.

[10:16] Anything else in the turn of the union before I move on?

[10:19] Engineering updates and then they're trying to

[10:21] hack the accessories on us.

[10:23] Great, I get it.

[10:24] Last chance to buy accessories for for for Ghostbusters.

[10:27] All right, so there's a post on pinside.

[10:30] And this is something that we talk about a lot

[10:33] and we see people complain about a lot.

[10:35] And that's dimples.

[10:36] Now, someone posted a recent photo

[10:39] of a Beatles pinball machine

[10:41] and they took a picture of it

[10:43] and it is the dark side of the moon.

[10:46] The creators on this game are worse than,

[10:49] I think almost any new game I've seen.

[10:52] And it's hard to look at this

[10:55] and to understand what is going on.

[10:58] And this game does not have ramps.

[11:00] It doesn't have the ball sort of flying all over the place

[11:04] like a lot of other games.

[11:06] I don't understand why it looks like that.

[11:10] And I don't know what conclusion to come to.

[11:12] You know, you've got people saying they're using software

[11:14] wood, they're using more clear coat.

[11:16] We know Stern saying that dimpling is normal.

[11:20] And we all have had Stern pinball machines in the past

[11:23] that have had very few dimples.

[11:25] We've owned other machines by other manufacturers

[11:28] that don't display nearly as much dimpling.

[11:30] So what is the reason why this happens?

[11:34] I don't know.

[11:35] But I can tell you this, it does look like shit.

[11:40] Regardless of the cause,

[11:41] when I played the Beatles for the first time

[11:44] at a modern pinball in New York City,

[11:47] the first thing I did was I did notice

[11:50] an extreme amount of dimpling on the game.

[11:52] And for such a highly sort of collectible piece of pinball,

[11:57] which is how it's being marketed.

[11:59] This is a game for collectors.

[12:01] I was really turned off by the amount of dimpling.

[12:04] And the same thing when I would look at the Batman Super Ali

[12:08] at Pioneer Bar, the dimpling and the cratering in the game

[12:11] was just horrendous.

[12:14] And so it seems to be something that's happening

[12:15] on almost all New Stern machines.

[12:17] Now, it is why I use a play field protector.

[12:21] I literally do not want, I use it again.

[12:25] I do not want to see a game in a play field so beat up.

[12:29] And the whole notion that it will even out over time

[12:31] is also bogus.

[12:33] I've never seen that happen with any of these new Sterns.

[12:35] So I don't know the cause.

[12:37] It just is what it is.

[12:38] I think people are not saying nearly as many dimples

[12:40] on Jersey Jack machines or on American pinball machines

[12:44] or on spooky machines.

[12:45] So until we, I don't know if we'll ever get an answer,

[12:49] but it just is the modern state of Stern play field.

[12:53] So take it for what it is.

[12:55] All right, let's talk about monsters.

[12:58] So something interesting someone pointed out on the monsters

[13:01] is when you look at the video clips on the monsters,

[13:04] there's a weird arc, like a shading arc

[13:07] that goes over the video clips.

[13:10] It's really strange.

[13:11] And you have to look at it.

[13:12] He actually calls it out in the monsters thread.

[13:15] And basically what it looks like

[13:17] is on the left side of the video clip.

[13:20] It's a lighter contrast than on the right side.

[13:23] And there's like a picture of like Eddie Munster sitting

[13:27] on the table and what the chair on the left side of the table

[13:32] is much lighter than the chair on the right side.

[13:34] And you can actually see like through the middle of the screen

[13:38] is like this arch.

[13:39] It almost looks like a half moon line

[13:42] that goes over the video clip where you can definitely see

[13:46] it's different contrast between the right and left side

[13:50] of the video clip.

[13:51] I know it's a little hard to follow that on a podcast,

[13:54] but go look at it.

[13:55] And then he actually shows you where that line is.

[13:57] And then once you see it, you can't unsee it.

[14:00] So it's clearly something in how they process the video clips.

[14:05] I assume that they might not even be aware of this,

[14:09] but it is something that hopefully they'll fix

[14:11] in a new code update.

[14:12] It's just a weird thing.

[14:13] It's just a weird phenomenon that someone picked up on.

[14:16] I mean, it's kind of amazing.

[14:17] The eagle eyes that people have in this hobby.

[14:20] So something the worst thing that could be happening

[14:22] to the Munsters right now, and this doesn't really mean much,

[14:25] but it's just funny to watch this happen on Pinside.

[14:27] The worst thing that could happen to this game

[14:30] is that one individual we know his name,

[14:32] he's now shilling the game in some weird way.

[14:35] And that is Hilton.

[14:36] And we know Hilton, it's so strange whenever he decides

[14:40] to pick a game that he then promotes.

[14:44] He almost like promotes it in his grandiose way.

[14:48] And I think he does it because he gets called out

[14:52] for being too negative.

[14:53] But all we need to know is this.

[14:54] What is always fun to watch when he always picks

[14:57] a weird game to promote is someone always reminds us

[15:00] of one game that he rated a certain way.

[15:03] And he gave Metallica a one out of 10

[15:07] on in terms of like pinball rankings on Pinside, a one.

[15:13] And so when you do that, your opinion no longer matters.

[15:16] And he's also like, we've seen him before

[15:19] show games like Wrath of Olympus.

[15:22] And remember when he drew all those lines

[15:25] on the Alien Play field to show us all how great

[15:28] of the game was and how it was the a genius design.

[15:32] It was one of the best flowing pinball machines of all time.

[15:34] And yet every time everyone would step up to an Alien,

[15:37] it's anything but that.

[15:39] I get it's an immersive experience,

[15:40] but Alien Pimball is not one of the greatest flowing

[15:42] pinball machines of all time.

[15:44] So if you're a manufacturer, you might as well suggest

[15:48] to Robin and everyone, you kind of want this guy

[15:51] not hyping your game.

[15:52] Because whenever he hypes the game,

[15:54] the opposite usually comes true.

[15:55] He also jumped on the Beatles train as well.

[15:58] But it is, I'd rather see him say nice things

[16:01] and negative things, but just weird the way

[16:03] he picks his battles on Pinside.

[16:05] All right, so let's see something else.

[16:07] Stern, Beatles, how is it selling?

[16:10] How is Beatles selling?

[16:12] The reason I asked this question is on Pinside,

[16:15] if you go into the Beatles Club thread,

[16:17] is this a telltale sign?

[16:19] In the Beatles Club thread, there is only

[16:22] and are only four pages of conversation.

[16:27] Four, which is nothing.

[16:29] In the Batman owners thread, there's 247 pages

[16:33] in the Alien, there's probably like 500,

[16:36] four pages of people in the Beatles ownership club.

[16:40] Now that can be one of two things.

[16:42] It can mean that the game's not selling.

[16:45] That's why people aren't talking on the form

[16:48] about owning it or that the majority of people

[16:51] buying Beatles' pinball are not on Pinside

[16:54] and they're more of the Beatles collector

[16:56] and Stern's marketing that was targeting them

[16:59] was successful.

[16:59] I don't know which one it is.

[17:02] It definitely seems that there are more Beatles for sale

[17:05] than other pins that have been like in demand.

[17:10] And I see on eBay, there's still the platinum

[17:13] and diamond edition ones that are up for sale.

[17:15] I think those $25 diamond editions

[17:18] are gonna sit for a really long time.

[17:19] You're not gonna see those things move quickly

[17:21] anytime soon, all right?

[17:23] All right, what else is going on?

[17:25] So there was an interesting take on pirates

[17:28] of the Caribbean and someone who owns

[17:30] a Pirates of the Caribbean and a Star Wars.

[17:33] I don't know if they own both,

[17:35] but they've definitely played both.

[17:37] They wrote an interesting post

[17:40] and it's Aalah Dubseed, I don't know, he's from England.

[17:44] But he wrote this comment and I wanna just read it on air

[17:47] because I do think it's an interesting take

[17:48] on how these two games have sort of developed

[17:52] and been coded and he wrote this in the thread.

[17:56] This thread always makes me laugh.

[17:58] It's like Jersey Jack Pinball, Pirates of the Caribbean

[18:01] is really easy to understand

[18:02] and then you open up the thread

[18:04] and it's like so confusing what he's trying to explain

[18:07] and it shouldn't be that difficult to explain

[18:09] how to play a pin and apparently like Jersey Jack Pirates

[18:13] is more like a hero's journey.

[18:15] And so he writes this, I'll give my honest opinion.

[18:18] There's nothing inherently wrong with Keith's,

[18:23] hold on with Keith's hero journey approach

[18:25] to the game rules, but this wasn't the best game

[18:29] to put it on.

[18:30] If you were to take Jersey Jack Pinball Pirates

[18:33] and stern Star Wars with Dwight's more abstract,

[18:37] these are the things you want to hit,

[18:39] keep hitting them as a way to carry the big points

[18:43] for as long as possible and simply swap the two codes around

[18:48] then both games would have been so much better

[18:51] or at least that much more immediate to get into.

[18:55] So what do you think about that?

[18:56] Do you think if the approach that's in Star Wars

[19:00] was put into Pirates and Pirates approach into Star Wars,

[19:05] it would be easier to get into.

[19:08] I don't know, I don't know.

[19:09] What I do know is this.

[19:11] I do find both of those games confusing.

[19:13] I don't find either one of those games

[19:15] to be very intuitive.

[19:17] I've never liked the way Star Wars,

[19:20] a story that I completely love has been so chopped up

[19:24] and sort of all the layering and stacking of scenes.

[19:27] It just seems so poorly done.

[19:30] And maybe what he's saying is Star Wars

[19:32] is more of a hero's journey as you're journeying

[19:35] as Luke Skywalker to defeat the Emperor.

[19:38] Maybe that approach, I don't know.

[19:41] Is that even, I don't even know what Pirates is,

[19:43] how is it a hero's journey?

[19:44] I don't get it.

[19:45] You choose from 22 characters.

[19:48] So are you choosing, but they're not all heroes.

[19:51] There's like bad guys.

[19:52] I'm still confused.

[19:53] I'm so still confused.

[19:54] Anyway, so here's some news for all of you out there.

[19:57] For those of you out there expecting

[19:59] to see a new Jersey Jack Pimball Machine revealed

[20:03] at the Texas Pimball Festival,

[20:06] I am here to tell you that you will be disappointed.

[20:10] There will not be a brand new reveal

[20:14] at Texas Pimball Festival for Jersey Jack Pimball.

[20:17] And I think that's a good thing.

[20:19] I've said it.

[20:20] I can't criticize them for revealing games too early.

[20:22] It would be a mistake to bring a game there.

[20:25] So that is not going to happen.

[20:28] I'm hearing this.

[20:29] I'm hearing that the earliest,

[20:31] the earliest we will see a new Jersey Jack Pimball reveal

[20:36] will be in the month of May for Shipman

[20:40] and sometime probably later summer.

[20:43] So how does that sound?

[20:46] Then if it's a Pat Lawler game,

[20:47] is it Toy Story in May?

[20:48] Would that make sense?

[20:49] Because the new Toy Story movie comes out in June.

[20:52] That does seem to make sense.

[20:54] So hopefully we'll see what happens.

[20:56] It also might be difficult

[20:57] because if there's stuff in the game

[20:59] that's based on Toy Story 4,

[21:02] then you can't show that in the game

[21:04] because you'd be spoiling the movie.

[21:05] Now I don't think you need Toy Story 4

[21:09] to be part of the game.

[21:12] I actually think it would make most sense

[21:15] if Toy Story, the Pimball Machine,

[21:17] was simply based on the first Toy Story movie.

[21:20] And I don't always think you need to have

[21:22] every single film represented in a game,

[21:25] especially when even though all Toy Story's

[21:27] are great films, they all three are great.

[21:29] I do think you can make a Pimball Machine

[21:31] that's all about the first movie

[21:33] and getting Buzz and Woody back together again at the end.

[21:36] I just think it's such a nice tight story

[21:39] when you're trying to do things from all three,

[21:41] it makes it much more difficult.

[21:43] Right, remember because the narrative

[21:46] in Toy Story 1, 2, and 3 is not one long trilogy.

[21:50] It's just three separate movies.

[21:52] The narrative in Lord of the Rings

[21:54] and the narrative in Blankin' Star Wars,

[22:00] it's one trilogy.

[22:03] It's every movie continues the story to the finale.

[22:09] So it's like kill the Emperor at the end of the trilogy

[22:12] and it's destroy the ring at the end

[22:14] of the third one there.

[22:15] And that's why those sort of themes work.

[22:18] It's also why Pirates of the Caribbean

[22:20] is a jumbled mess

[22:21] because it's five separate movies.

[22:23] Each movie has a beginning and an end.

[22:27] You could watch them independently of each other

[22:29] and you're fine.

[22:30] They each create a whole new narrative.

[22:32] And that's why I think the only pins

[22:36] based on franchises that should have all three

[22:39] are ones that the story was written cohesively

[22:43] if that makes sense, all right?

[22:45] All right, so what does that mean?

[22:47] I think what we're gonna get at Texas Pimball Festival

[22:50] from Jersey Jack Pimball,

[22:51] I think we're gonna get the Yellow Brick Road edition

[22:54] of Wizard of Oz.

[22:55] And what I'm hearing from people

[22:57] is it's a more stripped down version of the Wizard of Oz

[22:59] that it's more like a Wizard of Oz Pro.

[23:02] So they might be yanking some stuff out

[23:04] and lowering the price to get more people into the Wizard of Oz.

[23:09] Waz, we know has been Jack's best selling game.

[23:12] And so it sort of makes sense that he would wanna keep

[23:15] that game on the line because it continues to be

[23:18] his money maker, his annuity.

[23:20] And I'm assuming that Pirate of the Caribbean sales

[23:24] are not as strong as they would have liked

[23:27] and the delay definitely hurt them.

[23:30] All right, speaking of trilogies though,

[23:32] this is interesting.

[23:33] So the Matrix, there's a thread about

[23:35] the Matrix Pimball ever be made.

[23:38] And we know that one was made from the friends

[23:40] over in Europe who made like 10

[23:42] reskin Johnny Numanic Matrixes.

[23:45] There's about 10 or more out in the world.

[23:47] There's a feeling in the United States,

[23:49] they sell for like 20 to $25,000.

[23:52] And they're really, it's a cool machine.

[23:54] It's very immersive.

[23:56] But you know, it's a reskin of Johnny Numanic.

[23:59] Would people love to see the Matrix

[24:02] be made into a Pimball machine?

[24:03] I think unanimously that is such an awesome

[24:06] deep storyline game that would make

[24:09] a perfect Pimball experience.

[24:11] And look, if Keith were gonna make a Pimball machine,

[24:14] I think a movie like The Matrix would be perfect for Keith

[24:18] because he loves to go deep with the code.

[24:20] And that is a very deep storyline.

[24:22] It sinks up perfectly.

[24:24] See, that's the thing is like going deep

[24:26] on prior to the Caribbean narrative

[24:28] doesn't make sense to me because it should be

[24:31] much more simpler and intuitive.

[24:33] And he went like deep with it.

[24:35] And I think The Matrix though, it would be like ideal

[24:38] for a code or like Keith.

[24:41] But here's why it'll never happen

[24:43] because Jersey Jack considers a movie like The Matrix

[24:46] to be too violent for families.

[24:48] And so he won't make it.

[24:50] Although someone needs to tell Jack

[24:52] what the lyrics are to guns and roses.

[24:55] If he's thinking family friendly,

[24:57] how family friendly are these lyrics?

[24:59] You get nothing for nothing

[25:00] because that's what you do.

[25:01] Turn around, B-I-T-C-H,

[25:04] because I got a use for you besides,

[25:06] I got nothing better to do and I'm bored.

[25:09] You know, guns and roses are misogynistic as it gets.

[25:14] At least they were like when they,

[25:15] with appetite for destruction.

[25:17] So we'll see, we'll see.

[25:19] But I mean, Jack just needs to get off of this.

[25:22] Like we're gonna make games for the family only.

[25:25] We're gonna make games for operators.

[25:26] And it's just silly.

[25:29] I think he's leaving a lot of themes on the table

[25:31] that would work well for his company.

[25:33] All right, so let's, I don't think Jersey Jack

[25:35] will ever make The Matrix.

[25:36] But I would love to see The Matrix come out.

[25:38] So an alien pinball machine was stolen in Sweden

[25:41] and I'll read you what happened.

[25:43] This guy writes, hi all,

[25:45] we had a client to us who bought an alien LE number 146

[25:49] and it's stolen and had it stolen.

[25:52] Okay, hold on, I'm just gonna scroll over here.

[25:55] Okay, Alien 146 had a burglar this weekend

[25:58] and got his game stolen.

[26:00] All of us on this side have our eyes.

[26:03] Please give us information if you find this game around.

[26:07] The game was stolen in Sweden

[26:08] and I think it would be hard to tell in our country

[26:11] as it's a small country.

[26:13] And the pinball guys know about this also.

[26:16] Any hands, please send me information.

[26:18] And if you got a good price on the game,

[26:20] you all know why.

[26:22] From Kenneth Peterson.

[26:23] Now what made me laugh about this

[26:25] is someone posted immediately after this

[26:28] and says, I think I know the getaway vehicle

[26:30] and someone posted the hydrofoil

[26:32] that Andrew Highway purchased

[26:34] at leaving supposedly the scene of the crime.

[26:37] Look, it sucks when people steal pinball machines.

[26:41] If you do see an Alien 146 for sale,

[26:45] I would let these guys know and recovered for the owner.

[26:50] They also seem to, they didn't just steal the pinball machine.

[26:52] They stole a bunch of computers and whatnot.

[26:54] So it was a legitimate burglarity

[26:56] but stealing a computer, like an Apple computer

[26:58] is one thing, a 400 pound pinball machine

[27:00] that's humongous, a lot harder to steal.

[27:03] And it's a lot harder to sell, right?

[27:06] Selling a stone, those guys probably don't realize

[27:08] they stole a game that came from a company

[27:12] that collapsed where there's a hyper focus on them.

[27:15] Like, it's super easy to identify each Alien pinball machine.

[27:20] You know, they didn't steal a Ghostbusters Pro

[27:23] where there's thousands of them.

[27:25] They stole a game where there's literally only like

[27:27] 150 out in the entire world.

[27:30] And so when this goes up for sale,

[27:32] it's gonna be a huge red flag.

[27:34] I think they're gonna have a really hard time selling it.

[27:36] And because, think about it,

[27:38] the only person who would really buy an Alien pinball machine

[27:41] would be someone who's into pinball

[27:43] and they would know that they're buying a stolen good.

[27:47] So this is like, this is gonna be interesting

[27:49] to see how this whole thing plays out.

[27:50] But anyway, we heard from Andrew Highway,

[27:53] which was interesting.

[27:55] So he posted a thing outside of pinball

[27:59] that I wanna read for you,

[28:00] but we haven't heard from him in a very long time.

[28:02] Apparently, his hydrophoil business plan

[28:05] did not get off the ground in Australia.

[28:07] And he's back in the UK.

[28:09] I don't know what he's doing.

[28:10] I never got served any papers in the pending lawsuit

[28:14] when he said he was gonna sue me.

[28:16] But let me read for you what Andrew Highway said recently.

[28:19] Hold on, let me pull it up here.

[28:22] All right, so he writes,

[28:25] I know a lot of people internationally,

[28:27] maybe some think that the UK would be a nice place to live,

[28:30] but I doubt it.

[28:32] I've been married for nearly four years to my wife.

[28:35] She is Russian and has been living in the UK

[28:38] with a residency visa for 3.5 years.

[28:40] Today, her visa renewal was rejected.

[28:43] She can appeal, but can now be deported

[28:46] in as little as four weeks.

[28:48] The home office has offered me advice though.

[28:51] As I visited Russia before,

[28:52] they feel I should move there, learn Russian,

[28:55] and get a job there.

[28:57] So as a British citizen, since birth,

[28:59] I apparently have no right to a family life in this country.

[29:03] Meanwhile, the country is at civil war over Brexit,

[29:07] quite how people think this country can survive

[29:13] on its own when it can't run trains with leaves on the lines,

[29:16] can't fly aircraft when there is snow,

[29:18] can't keep its roads and good repair,

[29:20] can't keep food on supermarket shelves

[29:23] when there are a few days of snow.

[29:24] The list goes on.

[29:25] I would add to that list, Andrew Highway,

[29:27] can't manufacture pinball machines that they promise people.

[29:30] And then he writes,

[29:31] I'm really sick of the country I once loved,

[29:33] and soon it will be time to leave.

[29:35] So look, that sucks.

[29:37] I mean, the personal issue of,

[29:39] I know what it's like, I married an Irish girl

[29:41] and your visa is not approved.

[29:43] Brenda got stuck in Ireland once for like three or four weeks,

[29:46] waiting to get back into the country here.

[29:49] So that sucks.

[29:50] I mean, I don't wish that upon anybody.

[29:52] All I would say is this,

[29:54] if you see a Russian pinball company pop up

[29:57] in the next six months, buyer beware, all right?

[30:01] What else is going on in pinball?

[30:04] Let's see, deep root and back to the future.

[30:06] So when deep root was teasing,

[30:09] they're trying to play around with like smoke

[30:11] and lanes of fire and people were just assuming

[30:14] that was the DeLorean.

[30:15] And they commented on something in Robert Road,

[30:18] by the way, it is common knowledge by anyone

[30:21] who has inquired that back to the future

[30:23] is not available to be licensed.

[30:25] And so that has people speculating,

[30:27] well, is he saying that because they have the license

[30:30] or is he saying that because it really can't be licensed?

[30:33] We also know that there was a back to the future pinball machine.

[30:36] So why can't it be made again?

[30:38] I don't know.

[30:39] I really don't know.

[30:41] But I do know that deep root will not be a TPL showing you games.

[30:45] Now, that just begs the question.

[30:47] What actually will happen at TPL?

[30:51] It sounds like there are going to be zero new game reveals

[30:57] at the show.

[30:58] And I think that has to bum some people out.

[31:00] And we all know that the reason to go to shows

[31:02] is not just about the reveals.

[31:03] It is about hanging out with your pinhead friends

[31:06] that you don't normally see in playing pinball

[31:08] and drinking beer like you're in your 20s

[31:10] and staying up late and all that good stuff.

[31:14] And you'll still have fun at TPL.

[31:16] Don't get me wrong.

[31:17] But I do think it is a bit of a bummer

[31:20] that there is going to be nothing new shown

[31:22] to people at the show.

[31:24] And TPL is usually a platform in which we do get

[31:27] new game reveals and we do get to see stuff

[31:29] for the first time.

[31:31] And so, and by that I mean new new game.

[31:33] I don't mean like the other big road version of Waz.

[31:36] We were really expecting deep root pinball to own this show.

[31:42] This was going to be the moment in which we were going to find out

[31:45] if they were going to be able to deliver on all of their hype.

[31:48] And we're just not going to know.

[31:50] And we're not going to know.

[31:50] And TPL is just not going to be the place where it happens.

[31:54] And then it just begs the question,

[31:56] well then if not then when?

[31:58] When are we going to hear this stuff?

[32:00] All right, so let me read some emails I got from you guys.

[32:03] Then I'm going to call it a David Johnson writes,

[32:06] code updates, Hey Chris, heard you say how hard it is

[32:09] to update code on machines since you lose your high scores

[32:12] and settings.

[32:13] Did you know that Houdini updates don't lose settings

[32:16] and scores?

[32:18] Josh has been an outstanding addition to the community

[32:20] for implementing details like this.

[32:22] I think it is long overdue that Stern and JJP catch up

[32:26] and make code updates easy.

[32:28] No reason why they can't.

[32:29] You want to help the community in a positive way,

[32:32] make this a big issue.

[32:33] Never miss a show.

[32:34] See you in Texas, Dave.

[32:36] Angus on Pinside.

[32:38] Look, Dave, I agree.

[32:40] I don't understand why we can't update these games

[32:43] without losing all of our progress to date.

[32:46] And it's a little bit frustrating.

[32:48] It also is a little bit fun for people

[32:50] because everything starts over again.

[32:51] But I think when you start putting up big scores

[32:54] and you're proud of those scores,

[32:56] it's not fun to lose your combo record

[33:00] and to lose your this record and your that record.

[33:03] Why can't they do that?

[33:05] And I do.

[33:05] I think there should be pressure on the other companies

[33:09] who have code updates not for that code update

[33:11] to erase everything.

[33:13] So I'm glad that Josh has code that into Houdini.

[33:16] Got an email from Dave Sanders.

[33:19] I got a few from him.

[33:19] I'm going to read them both the master.

[33:21] He writes, he's quite right.

[33:23] And that's also why designing under Andrew's stewardship

[33:29] became such a slog and stopped being fun

[33:31] once full throttle have been set in stone.

[33:34] And most of the creative control

[33:35] have been taken out of my hands.

[33:37] Designing by committee is always bullshit.

[33:40] It's like the Lorax movie.

[33:42] All the individual parts may be decent in their own right,

[33:46] but put them together in that combination.

[33:48] And suddenly you may find you've absolutely missed

[33:51] the point of the source material.

[33:53] And it's the lack of enthusiasm that people pick up on.

[33:57] If you didn't have your heart in the product,

[33:59] you were making your damn right that players

[34:02] won't get any reason why they should care either.

[34:05] Alien turned out as good as it did

[34:07] thanks to the American side of the team.

[34:10] Joe and Brian on code, David deals sound ambiance.

[34:15] And Kelly, I'm not going to put you

[34:17] on this last name, Kelly M's animations.

[34:20] By the end, they were the ones calling the shots

[34:23] on what should go into the game to fix it up

[34:25] as an experience as much as possible.

[34:28] They were executing the creative vision.

[34:30] And Andrew was too preoccupied with things at RN

[34:34] to try and control them.

[34:36] Did I write animation?

[34:38] Question mark?

[34:39] I meant amalgamation.

[34:41] All right, well, I agree.

[34:43] Dave, I totally agree.

[34:45] Something that people forget when you look

[34:48] at a pinball machine is that it is a creative toy.

[34:54] And when you play a good game, when you play a magical game,

[34:58] there's a cohesiveness to everything going on

[35:00] because the game was creatively directed by a winner,

[35:05] by a smart person, by someone who had a vision

[35:08] what he wanted in the game.

[35:10] And I think that's why people really enjoy

[35:13] the old J-Pop games, even though the code is shallow.

[35:17] I think they really feel a connection to his creative vision.

[35:22] And I think when we look at the games that are hits,

[35:24] we also see that connection with the designer.

[35:28] And I think when we see games that are a miss,

[35:30] they do feel a little schizophrenic.

[35:32] They feel like the sum of the parts just doesn't work.

[35:36] That somehow there's a little too much random chaos going

[35:40] on it just doesn't click.

[35:42] It doesn't connect.

[35:44] And I feel that, and that's sort of,

[35:48] even how I feel about pirates.

[35:50] I feel like there just wasn't a simple creative direction

[35:55] for the game.

[35:56] I feel like the coders off doing crazy stuff.

[35:59] I feel like the mechs are being built.

[36:01] I feel like there wasn't like, okay, here's the goal

[36:04] of the game.

[36:06] I just feel like they sat down with a ton of movie scenes

[36:11] and a ton of things that they had in their head.

[36:14] And they kind of like put it all in in random ways

[36:17] that just don't work for me.

[36:19] And I'm sorry, I don't think I'm being too harsh.

[36:22] I think that a game should have a simple,

[36:26] easily digestible creative direction.

[36:30] And if it doesn't, I think that's what misses the mark for me.

[36:33] All right?

[36:34] Okay, so let me also go on to, let's see Dave Sanders.

[36:38] He also wrote another thing.

[36:40] One thing about Angry Birds.

[36:42] The point that you're missing is how different

[36:45] the pinball marketplace was just six or seven years ago.

[36:48] Jersey Jack had yet to reveal anything substantial.

[36:51] Spooky hadn't even started.

[36:53] Stern were the only real players in town.

[36:56] The time to make Angry Birds would have been 2012

[37:00] when we pitched it.

[37:02] Andrew wanted a slice of the operator market,

[37:04] and that would have been the game to hopefully bring

[37:06] in some new and younger players precisely

[37:10] because of its casual pick and play theme.

[37:13] Redemption machines, for example,

[37:15] were filled with Angry Birds toys.

[37:17] Without that crucial avenue, the license was unfeasible.

[37:21] Nowadays, of course, you're quite right.

[37:23] Even if the brand still had the same poll,

[37:25] you wouldn't touch it with a barge poll.

[37:28] Look, Dave, I disagree.

[37:30] I don't care if it's 2012, I don't care if it's 1912,

[37:33] I don't care if it's 2024.

[37:35] Angry Birds just doesn't appeal to the pinball player,

[37:40] nor to the pinball buyer.

[37:42] And Andrew Hyo, it was creating a pinball company

[37:44] where he needed to sell pinball machines.

[37:47] This whole notion of his that I need to get this game

[37:49] on location is idiotic.

[37:52] Why?

[37:52] You don't need to get games on location to find buyers.

[37:55] You don't.

[37:57] The majority of pinball buyers are not location.

[38:00] They're not operators.

[38:01] So why do you need to get the game on location?

[38:04] And in fact, the reason why Rovio passed on it

[38:08] is they didn't want it in bars.

[38:10] And they wanted to make sure that it was a game

[38:12] that would be bought by families and not by a bunch

[38:15] of drunken dudes at league night.

[38:17] So I just, I don't understand this.

[38:21] It's the same way I look at Jersey Jack.

[38:23] I don't understand why he thinks he needs to sell games

[38:25] for location play.

[38:26] A Jersey Jack pinball experience

[38:28] is absolutely horrendous on location.

[38:32] It's meant for a home environment.

[38:34] And that's okay because luckily,

[38:37] for these companies, the majority of sales

[38:40] happen to the home buyer.

[38:42] And so it's just called market research.

[38:45] I think it's the reason why I think these guys

[38:48] want their pins out on location.

[38:50] It's more of like an ego play.

[38:52] Like I want to see my game out in the barcade.

[38:55] And hey, if your game is great,

[38:56] the barcade guys will put it out on location.

[38:59] But you should still always make these games

[39:02] to appeal to the home buyer first.

[39:05] And that's my take unless you're making a cheap game.

[39:07] Like a pro because that's what the storm pro is for.

[39:10] All right, I got an email from Jeffrey Jones,

[39:11] monsters, Hey, Chris, good podcast today.

[39:14] FYI, there's a monsters at Sunshine in New York.

[39:16] So I'm going to go check that out.

[39:18] Thank you for letting me know that.

[39:20] I got an email from Steve,

[39:21] Paradis Steve writes,

[39:22] canada, you are probably right that I was a little hard on

[39:25] stern.

[39:26] There are many people over there who live for pinball.

[39:28] I still hold a grudge after Williams closed

[39:30] and they survived.

[39:32] You do have to agree though that some things

[39:34] have really been questionable at times.

[39:36] Build quality, world under glass,

[39:37] or lack thereof, $9,000 L.E.'s, $8,000 B.

[39:41] Eels.

[39:42] But if people are paying the money,

[39:43] what do I know?

[39:44] I definitely would not.

[39:46] Well Steve, first of all,

[39:47] that's exactly the reason why they do it.

[39:50] It's successful for them.

[39:52] Why would Stern not take the money that's on the table?

[39:55] All right, he then goes on the right.

[39:57] In general, there are really not many games from them

[40:00] that I really like.

[40:01] Lord the Rings, pinball party, Batman 66.

[40:05] These are three machines I would actually pay money for.

[40:08] I hope they come out with more like this,

[40:10] not all art and code.

[40:12] I'm looking forward to playing Monsters Premium.

[40:14] Jersey Jack, I really believe they are going to come through

[40:18] with a true masterpiece.

[40:20] Will they be able to survive the oversaturation

[40:22] and the next downturn?

[40:24] I very much hope they do.

[40:26] I don't know that they will.

[40:28] So first of all, look, Jersey, we all want it.

[40:32] We all want Jersey Jack to have that masterpiece.

[40:34] The question I always have is how many chances

[40:37] are they going to get to get there?

[40:39] And my whole thing is this.

[40:40] It's like Einstein said,

[40:41] when you're making the same products with the same people

[40:44] with the same teams, but you expect different results,

[40:47] isn't that insanity?

[40:49] So what will happen over at Jersey Jack

[40:52] that actually creates that masterpiece?

[40:55] Last time I checked, it's the same people,

[40:58] the same teams, the same individuals,

[41:00] and they keep missing the mark on a masterpiece.

[41:03] Now some of you might think they've hit that before

[41:05] with dialed in, and that's cool.

[41:06] Again, remember, this is all subjective.

[41:09] This is all opinions, but I just don't think

[41:11] they've made a game.

[41:12] That is a masterpiece yet.

[41:13] He then goes on to write deep root.

[41:15] I feel stupid having so much faith in this company,

[41:17] having seen nothing, but I really think they're going

[41:19] to do some wonderful things.

[41:21] If they do, it is really going to put pressure

[41:23] on every other company, even Stern.

[41:25] Steve Peep.

[41:27] All right, Steven, Steven, Steven, Steven, Steven.

[41:30] Stern sells 10,000 Pimball machines a year.

[41:33] Stern has a manufacturer and capability

[41:35] that is untouched, unparalleled, and above and beyond

[41:40] what anyone else has ever done in Pimball

[41:43] in the last like 30 years, 20 years at least, right?

[41:47] So why would Stern feel pressure?

[41:49] Well, I don't get this.

[41:51] Stern has 90% of the market.

[41:53] They have some of the best themes in Pimball,

[41:55] and they're able to crank out machines like nobody else.

[41:59] They have probably the best coder in all of Pimball history.

[42:04] They have the best artists in Pimball lined up currently.

[42:08] Where they are a week is in the mechanical error of the games,

[42:12] but they also know that the mechanical side of Pimball

[42:15] is also where you have most of your issues.

[42:17] And so they've decided not to rely too heavily

[42:21] on complex mechanical things and simply put more emphasis

[42:27] on reliability and on code and on art and on theme.

[42:32] And in doing so, they've been very successful.

[42:35] Now again, this is not me saying that's how I would love it to be.

[42:38] I get really excited when I hear Robert talk about levitating balls

[42:42] and all the mechanical things are doing and just wait and just wow.

[42:45] But what Deeproot has not done is ship a thousand games

[42:50] with complex mechanical parts in it

[42:52] that we know are reliable, that we know will hold up.

[42:56] We don't know that they can even ship games quickly to consumers.

[43:00] I mean, we've heard Robert say people are going to get their game

[43:03] within two weeks.

[43:04] So I mean, look, it's painful to me that they set all these bold claims

[43:09] because not even Stern can get you your Stern-Elly

[43:11] within two weeks of order.

[43:13] So how are they going to do it when Stern has 200 employees,

[43:17] has an assembly line, has a distribution model,

[43:20] has everything in place, has 30 years of experience doing it,

[43:24] and then a company that doesn't have any experience doing it

[43:27] is overnight going to do it better.

[43:30] I mean, just think about that for a minute.

[43:31] Again, this is not me rooting against Deeproot.

[43:34] I really do.

[43:35] I can't wait to see what they do.

[43:38] But they've said some things that I don't think have Stern worried.

[43:43] I think they said some things that have Stern laughing.

[43:46] And I think the onus is on them now to not become the joke

[43:53] of the pinball industry because they've teed up some really big promises

[43:58] and they now need to deliver.

[43:59] I would not have done it the way they did it in that sense.

[44:03] I also think the big question mark is Deeproot and art is an art.

[44:12] Our Deeproot going to reveal and release mostly original IP games.

[44:17] And we know that original themes don't sell as well as license themes.

[44:24] And are they banking the company on originality versus license themes?

[44:31] And how are you going to go again some of the powerhouse licenses that Stern has?

[44:35] And we'll see.

[44:36] Again, I don't know.

[44:37] I don't know what's going on over there.

[44:40] All I know is what some people who have seen stuff tell me.

[44:43] All right.

[44:44] Steve also wrote Collectibility.

[44:47] He wrote Canada.

[44:48] You touched on something important.

[44:50] One thing I don't think most people don't get is that almost nothing that was designed

[44:56] and marketed as a collectible ever actually goes up in value.

[45:00] Most valuable collectibles are things that were not expected.

[45:03] Baseball cards, comics, pinball games.

[45:05] I've tons of comics from the 90s.

[45:08] Very few are worth anything.

[45:10] Everyone bought them as collectibles and kept them in bags and boards and they are in

[45:14] perfect condition.

[45:15] Millions of them.

[45:16] Same goes for baseball cards worth 10 cents on the dollar mostly.

[45:19] Now that every valuable pinball is being remade, the days of pinball being investment grade

[45:24] collectibles is over.

[45:26] You missed it people with a few clusterfuck situations like Lebowski and Alien and as exceptions.

[45:32] Again, these were not expected to be limited and a rare thing.

[45:36] I'll just it just happened that way.

[45:38] There were a few more like this over the next couple of years as other companies fail.

[45:43] Do you really want to pay $20,000 for a game with no support?

[45:46] What do you think?

[45:47] Well, look, Steve, we talk about this all the time.

[45:51] Pinball is a weird hobby for me because I do think the LEDs are designed as collectibles

[46:00] and I think if you get the right number of LEDs and you get the game good enough, it

[46:07] will be something people will want to collect and own for a very long time and the game

[46:12] has to be great.

[46:13] It can't be a just rare.

[46:15] It can't be a shitty game.

[46:17] It can't have no support.

[46:19] If I were to look at all the games right now and say, well, what's really held its value

[46:23] or gone up in value?

[46:24] Minus all the games you've talked about right now, which are like the aliens and the Lebowski's,

[46:30] the manufactured rarity, not even manufactured, rarity by unfortunate circumstance.

[46:36] And I wouldn't want to own those games because I think they're ticking time bombs.

[46:41] I'm not saying this because I have it, but I think the only game that's like, I think

[46:45] a collectible right now that's going to keep going up in value for the most part is a

[46:51] Batman Ellie and an SLE because it's such a good game and there's just so few of them.

[46:58] In total, there's only 240 Batman Ellie's.

[47:01] That's only 120 in the United States and the SLE's even rare.

[47:07] They were meant to be collectibles and I think they actually in the end, they turned out

[47:13] to be that because of just no, because of how great the game is and also how great the

[47:17] game looks.

[47:18] I think people who own those games have a real sense of pride in what they have.

[47:23] I think there's a few other titles like that.

[47:25] But for the most part, all the collectibles from the 90s, if they're remade, yeah, they're

[47:29] going to struggle to hold value for sure.

[47:32] All right, let me go on.

[47:33] A few more than we got to go.

[47:34] Got to go to work.

[47:36] I have an email from David Dennis.

[47:38] He writes, new to the hobby with an interesting perspective.

[47:41] Lots, he writes a lot here, but he said he just joined the hobby.

[47:47] He hasn't experienced the past dramas of Zidware and other things going on.

[47:52] I want to read his quick thoughts.

[47:53] He writes, North America's blow, we blow our excess cash on hobbies, be it pinball, motorcycles,

[48:00] snowboarding or vacations.

[48:02] Everyone has something they waste money on and we have chosen pinball.

[48:05] There are no different than any other hobby or niche.

[48:08] I recently joined a league because I want to meet people and play many different machines

[48:12] without spending a lot on coin drops.

[48:15] I would never buy a machine from any manufacturer has only built one or two machines with 2000

[48:21] total unit sales when I can see the industry struggles with startups going bust with people's

[48:26] money.

[48:27] Stern and JJP are likely the only manufacturers I'd consider maybe spooky.

[48:32] Will you prove yourself there's no way I'm going to lose $6,000 with non-delivery or

[48:36] poor quality.

[48:38] Stern has some great bang for the buck but they are a little lacking on imagination.

[48:43] If I had 10 grand today, which I don't, would I buy a machine with pinside club thread

[48:48] that looks nothing is ever working?

[48:51] Perception is reality and a quick googling can kill your sales.

[48:56] Themes King, I'm not going to buy a machine that I can't take pride in or doesn't speak

[49:00] to me.

[49:01] Oh the art is crap but it shoots great.

[49:03] It breaks off then but it's moving under upper play field.

[49:06] You can't make the ramp to lock the ball in the sword but it looks cool.

[49:10] The first pirate to the Caribbean was a good movie remember.

[49:13] Those are quotes that he writes about how people are always trying to sell us on the games.

[49:17] He writes, I'd never buy a machine without playing it.

[49:20] It's just like I'd never buy a house without walking through it.

[49:23] I want to have fun.

[49:24] I don't want to be punished and get angry trying to keep my ball alive for more than a minute.

[49:30] I want to walk up in play not study a rule book or spreadsheet.

[49:33] I don't want to solder ever.

[49:35] I'm not going to buy an L.E. because that seems like a lot of money for some plastic toys

[49:39] and a plaque.

[49:40] Pinball is a depreciating asset so I don't want to lose my shirt on a purchase and I'd

[49:45] rather a game that mostly keeps its value.

[49:49] I'm considering a use tron pro so if a vault came out it would make my purchase shit.

[49:56] Thanks a bunch.

[49:57] PS, congrats on the Stella and very nice ad.

[50:00] Thank you David.

[50:01] Sorry guys.

[50:02] Sometimes when I'm reading fast and the font is small in my Gmail I stumble a little bit.

[50:09] But look David first of all welcome to the hobby.

[50:12] Welcome to the world of pinball and yes we all do lower money on pinball machines.

[50:16] None of us really need a pinball in our lives but we're addicted to the fun that it presents.

[50:22] I think you have some good approach.

[50:24] Play the game, you love, enjoy it.

[50:27] It sounds like if you're in a league and you're having fun you might even stop there.

[50:32] The notion that you need to bring a machine home and have it in your house is not really

[50:37] necessary if you are in close proximity to location play.

[50:41] But every time I go out to location a lot of times these places don't maintain the pins

[50:45] very well.

[50:46] So you can't go wrong with the tron pro.

[50:48] I would just wait to see if tron vault comes out this year.

[50:53] I got an email from all right I'm going to stop there because I got more emails.

[50:57] We'll have more people's commentary on a future show.

[51:01] That was episode 310 of Canada's pinball podcast in closing in closing.

[51:06] I just want to say we are coming up on a period.

[51:10] I've said this before where there's just not a ton going to happen.

[51:15] Not a ton is going to happen.

[51:16] I think what if I had a wish for what I hope happens in the next month or so it's that

[51:20] more people get their Alice Cooper's more people get their pirates pirates pirates

[51:25] are shipping also very slowly more people get their monster bash remake L.E.s.

[51:31] And enjoy your pins you know something I've been doing recently more and more and more

[51:34] of is just been turning on my Batman and enjoying it.

[51:40] I do think there's like a new light show when you get to the villain escape that's absolutely

[51:44] incredible and what I love about Batman.

[51:47] I'm going to end on someone else's comment that they wrote what I love about Batman is

[51:52] I love how many different ways there are to tackle the game and how easy it is to figure

[51:59] out your strategy going in.

[52:02] You know you could either go for minor villains you could go for major villains you have

[52:07] very clear goals on what you want to achieve and it's super simple to get.

[52:13] If I jail two major villains I get an extra ball if I hit 20 combo shots I get an extra

[52:17] ball.

[52:19] If I jail all the major villains I get to that wizard mode if I if I if I jail three

[52:26] villains from the minor villains in each season I get to the three wizard modes that

[52:32] await there and I can select which ones they are and that's pretty much kind of it.

[52:35] You know there's other things layered in for deeper players and like but for the most

[52:40] part.

[52:42] I just I think the game is super fun because of how easy it is to jump into and understand.

[52:47] I want to read something that someone wrote and I want to end on this because I think

[52:50] this sort of summarizes how a lot of us feel about this hobby and I think the subject

[52:57] was happiness is dot dot dot and this is from pin side member cod and M4 and he writes

[53:03] he's from Kansas being retired waking up on a cold day cranking up the furnace putting

[53:11] a pot of coffee on to brew turning on a couple of pins to get them warmed up crawling back

[53:18] under the covers until the coffee is ready and then turning on the radio and listening

[53:24] to the helicopter reporter bleeding about the traffic snarl at exit 13 and then you plunge

[53:31] the ball and that is why pinball is amazing that last part was me but I think he hit it

[53:38] on the head ultimately these machines are fun and we have a good time with them we have

[53:45] a good time going back and forth speculating on the companies there's now 35 pinball

[53:50] podcast out there there's so many of them how many can you listen to it once but but pinball

[53:57] has a ways to go to get back to the magic and that is why you listen to this podcast

[54:02] because some games are special but the majority of them coming out these days I just don't

[54:07] think they're capturing the magic and it's because they don't have the creative director

[54:14] sitting over at all that has a vision from day one I think a lot of these pinball machines

[54:19] it's like they're building the ship in the ocean and they're just they're throwing stuff

[54:23] down you know and it just it just doesn't feel like it has the same cohesive magic of

[54:28] some of the other stuff we've seen but for the most part all of us can stand in front

[54:34] of a pinball machine and have a good time and that's really what it's all about so everyone

[54:38] have a great day we'll talk to you soon this was episode 310 of Canada's pinball podcast

[54:43] does it almost feel like nothing changed at all
