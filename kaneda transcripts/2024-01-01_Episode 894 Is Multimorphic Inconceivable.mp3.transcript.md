[00:00] Stars waiting, but I linger, still craving your kiss.

[00:09] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:13] Aw, welcome everybody.

[00:15] It's the first official Canadian Pinball podcast of 2024.

[00:19] I hope everybody had a great New Year's, a great holidays.

[00:23] I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm looking forward to like a little bit more

[00:27] normal routine.

[00:29] When the holidays come, you can't wait for your relatives to come over, you can't wait

[00:33] to have all those days off, but then you realize quickly as an adult, there's only so many

[00:39] espresso martinis and eggnog and eating and sitting and drinking a grown adult can do

[00:46] before you feel horrible.

[00:48] I can't wait to get back to a little bit of a normal daily routine, but that being said,

[00:54] the holidays go way too fast and the years go way too fast.

[00:59] But as we look forward to 2024, raise your hand if you're not excited for the pinball

[01:06] landscape of 2024.

[01:08] When we look over 2023 and we think about everything that happened in pinball, you know,

[01:13] it wasn't that much.

[01:14] I'm looking over the award results from the People's Choice Awards and after Foo Fighters,

[01:20] the number two game that won everything didn't even come out in 2023.

[01:25] It was Pulp Fiction.

[01:27] Now I do want to say this.

[01:28] I still will argue that Pulp Fiction won for best theme, best call outs, and best topper,

[01:36] and best bang for the buck.

[01:37] And even though the game didn't ship, I still would argue that those categories are relevant

[01:43] because the call outs are not going to change, the toppers not going to change, the freaking

[01:48] theme is not going to change, and the price is not going to change.

[01:52] And I think it's kind of embarrassing for everybody else that Pulp Fiction won the

[01:57] second most amount of awards and cleaning up easily was Foo Fighters with Game of the

[02:03] Year, Designer of the Year, Animations of the Year, Best Rule Set of the Year.

[02:08] And so congratulations to Jack Danger and Team over there.

[02:12] I think maybe the big upset was freaking Christopher Franci, dethroning Zombie Yeti who worked on

[02:19] two titles in 2023, but I don't think anyone would argue against the fact that Elton John

[02:25] looks beautiful.

[02:27] So here's what I want to talk about on this first episode of the year.

[02:30] I want to talk a little bit about some news.

[02:33] Then I want to talk a little bit about what I think we're about to get with Jaws Pinball.

[02:38] And then I just want to give you a few of Canada's resolutions for the year.

[02:42] And if you know me personally, I don't really believe in resolutions.

[02:46] I don't believe in January.

[02:48] I don't think we should pick a month and then decide to change stuff.

[02:52] I think we should always be trying to change ourselves and we should all be a work in progress

[02:59] every single month.

[03:01] It's going to be funny this week when I go to the gym and all of a sudden it's crowded

[03:05] and then two weeks later all those people are gone.

[03:08] I've been going to the gym all throughout the holidays even though I didn't want to.

[03:12] It's all about consistency.

[03:14] It's all about that routine.

[03:16] And man I got my ass kicked today because Brenda said, hey hop on my Peloton.

[03:20] She got me some Peloton shoes for Christmas.

[03:23] And I'll tell you this, as many pull-ups, push-ups and sit-ups that I do, 30 minutes

[03:28] on a Peloton with non-stop cardio completely kicked my ass.

[03:33] Alright so let's talk about the big news item this week.

[03:36] We did not get the Jaws trailer yet.

[03:38] We're all waiting on it.

[03:40] The big news this week is the Princess Bride Pinball is a real game and it is coming out

[03:46] from Multimorphic P3 or P3 Multimorphic.

[03:50] I'm never quite sure which order to put those two things in and let's discuss this for a

[03:56] minute.

[03:57] Because I really, really, really believe that this is a good theme for Pinball.

[04:00] I know some people out there aren't the biggest fans of this theme but if you watch the movie,

[04:06] it's got everything that a good pinball machine can want.

[04:09] It's got a campy storyline.

[04:11] It's got really funny scenes that are memorable.

[04:14] It's got iconic characters and actors in the movie itself.

[04:18] And it's a fun journey from beginning to end and you could see how all the different

[04:22] scenes in that movie would lend themselves really nicely to like great modes in the game.

[04:28] You've got sword fighting.

[04:30] You've got torture chambers.

[04:32] You've got like electric eels.

[04:34] You've got big rats.

[04:35] You've got trying to get through the forest.

[04:37] I mean the entire movie itself is like one mode after another and you could see how it

[04:42] would work perfectly.

[04:44] Now will they be able to get all the assets from the movie?

[04:47] I think you kind of need it, right?

[04:49] Because it's got so many one-liners and iconic scenes that you need to recreate it in the

[04:54] game itself.

[04:55] Now here's the big thing.

[04:57] When I posted on Facebook that multi-morphic would be making the Princess Bride, 90% of

[05:03] the comments were disappointed that this game was going to end up on the multi-morphic platform.

[05:09] And this is the dilemma of this entire platform.

[05:12] Think about it for a minute.

[05:13] All of these years we've been saying Jerry needs a great theme to sell his platform.

[05:18] And then when he gets a decent theme on his platform everybody is like oh my gosh I love

[05:23] this theme but I don't want it on this platform and it just begs the question is multi-morphic

[05:30] just a no-win scenario for anybody?

[05:33] Like nobody's winning here.

[05:34] And at what point is Jerry going to just read this feedback?

[05:38] People would rather have a normal pinball machine that is based off of the Princess Bride than

[05:44] a multi-morphic machine that is making the Princess Bride.

[05:48] And the issue with this platform is very simply this.

[05:51] It's not about just one title.

[05:53] If you commit to this platform you kind of have to commit to all of it.

[05:58] It's like you're not just marrying one person, you're marrying into the family.

[06:03] And you can't say that about other pinball machines.

[06:06] Other pinball machines are you're just marrying the person you want to marry, right?

[06:09] I want to marry Venom, I want to marry the Big Lebowski, I want to marry this.

[06:13] I don't have to marry Dutch, I don't have to marry Stern, I don't have to go all in

[06:17] on this company.

[06:19] But when you buy a P3 multi-morphic game you're committing to the entire family and

[06:25] portfolio of games.

[06:27] And that's the issue, right?

[06:28] It's like, okay, so you love the Princess Bride and it's going to be like over $12,000

[06:34] for the LE.

[06:35] So then you own this thing and the whole point of owning a multi-morphic is to pop in the

[06:39] different modulars but then do you really want to commit to the heist and to Weird Owl

[06:44] and to Cosmic Cart Racing and to Lexi Lightspeed?

[06:48] And then if you go on the pin side and you see the people who have done that, right?

[06:52] You see the people that have gone down this road before and married into this family and

[06:57] then what happens when you want to divorce, right?

[06:59] You want to move on from the platform, you're like $20,000 in on this platform and nobody's

[07:05] going to buy your P3 and all your modular games for like $18,000, $19,000, $20,000.

[07:12] And this is the big dilemma and I mean it's a dilemma because a dilemma is something with

[07:16] no solution.

[07:18] And I don't think there's a solution here.

[07:20] He's just going to keep pushing this platform forever.

[07:23] Why can't Jerry just listen to the feedback and make a normal pinball machine for once?

[07:29] Like just try it.

[07:31] You know what I'm saying?

[07:32] It's like he's built this thing and it's always going to be this thing and the majority

[07:36] of pinball buyers have said to him, this is not the thing we want.

[07:41] And I know he's got a few supporters.

[07:42] He probably hasn't even sold 500 of this platform over like an eight year period of

[07:49] time and it's just not going to work.

[07:52] And these machines are barely coming out and this is the dilemma, right?

[07:55] It's like he needs good themes to move the platform but nobody wants a good theme on

[07:59] the platform.

[08:00] I mean that's it.

[08:01] That is the ultimate summary of what multi-morphic P3 is.

[08:05] It was a neat new way to envision pinball.

[08:08] It's been around for 10 years now and people are not really into it.

[08:13] Just replace that screen play field with a wooden play field, put more mechs in the game

[08:18] and use your engineering team which is great and don't force them to retrofit normal pinball

[08:24] stuff.

[08:25] It seems like it's so much harder to retrofit a great pinball experience onto the platform.

[08:31] And we shall see with this game as we see more of it, how are they going to sort of

[08:35] disseminate the assets over that big LCD play field along with the screen in the back.

[08:41] Because remember, multi-morphic has never had a movie theme ever transported onto its

[08:47] platform.

[08:48] How is that going to work?

[08:49] Are the animations going to be better than what they were on Weird Owl which was more

[08:53] like 1990s clip art?

[08:55] Look, I didn't see this coming from multi-morphic.

[08:58] It's also weird they're doing this like strange marketing campaign where it's like a weird

[09:03] clandestine website.

[09:05] I think they're trying to like parody what Barrels of Fun did and maybe it's because

[09:10] both of these companies are in Texas I believe.

[09:13] I don't know, I don't know why they're doing it this way but Jerry, we know it's you.

[09:18] We know that this is going to be a multi-morphic game and now that the cat's out of the bag,

[09:23] you might as well reveal this thing before Jaws Pinball drops.

[09:27] I don't know how this thing is going to work and I don't think they sold a lot of final

[09:32] resistance games.

[09:33] I think they brought Scott Denisey over and he came onto the platform and his game didn't

[09:38] sell nearly as good as what he sold with Spooky Pinball with the traditional game.

[09:44] Again in marketing, when you get stubborn and you don't read the room and you don't

[09:48] read the feedback, what's the point now?

[09:51] If this guy just made a normal pinball machine, by now he would be up there with Spooky Pinball.

[09:58] He would be up there with Spooky Pinball.

[10:00] He would be selling over a thousand games a year and he would have great tremendous success.

[10:06] I have to imagine, if you're Jerry, you're a nudie, I think a lot of his nudie was coming

[10:11] from P-Rock sales and a lot of those P-Rock boards were going into companies like Spooky

[10:16] Pinball but he doesn't have nearly the amount of P-Rock customers he used to.

[10:21] I have to imagine some of his nudie is drying up.

[10:25] I have to imagine like this is going to be a make or break year for multi-morphic.

[10:29] I really mean it.

[10:30] There's just too many companies.

[10:32] There's too much out there.

[10:34] And now that we've got companies like the European Pinball Corporation that's going

[10:38] to start remaking Balli Williams games, we've got all these stern machines, we're going

[10:43] to get Jersey Jack Matrix or Harry Potter, we're going to get Back to the Future from

[10:48] Dutch Pinball and another mystery game possibly from Dutch Pinball.

[10:52] There's just so much happening in pinball.

[10:55] In a year in which pinball is so expensive, I just can't see multi-morphic being the company,

[11:01] that's going to get people to write checks.

[11:04] And again, it's because nobody wants to date the family.

[11:07] If Jerry put up a poll, that said, would you like us to make the Princess Bride with our

[11:12] traditional platform or make it like a normal pinball machine?

[11:17] He does not have the guts to put up a poll because over 95% of people would say just

[11:23] make it a normal pinball machine.

[11:26] And that's the whole thing about market research.

[11:28] If you turn yourself off to it and you just want to go with your gut and your hunch on

[11:32] what you think people want, it's not going to work out.

[11:35] And it's so obvious what people want.

[11:38] They just want normal pinball done right.

[11:41] Like that is it.

[11:42] That is all people want.

[11:44] That's what we want from Barrels of Fun.

[11:45] It's what we want from Jersey Jack and from Stern.

[11:48] And when your game is not turned on, I want to look down and see beautiful artwork.

[11:52] I want to see a world under glass.

[11:54] You know, when you go up to a multi-morphic and you look at the front of the game, the

[11:57] front of the cabinet that you see the most, it's just pitch black.

[12:00] There's no artwork on it.

[12:01] How is this improving the pinball experience?

[12:04] Because as we all know, half of the pinball owning experience is not even playing your

[12:08] games.

[12:09] The majority of people who buy these high-end games, yes, and once you're at like $12,000

[12:14] for the platform, you are now selling a high-end game.

[12:17] The majority of people, they don't even play their freaking games.

[12:20] I mean, we see this every single day.

[12:22] A new game pops up for sale.

[12:24] Ghostbusters LE, 177 plays.

[12:27] Pirates of the Caribbean, Collectors Edition, 20 plays.

[12:31] People don't want to play these games.

[12:32] They just want to stare at them.

[12:34] These things are works of art.

[12:35] As one of my friends always said, they're just movie posters you can play, you know,

[12:39] and nobody wants to play a flat-screen TV.

[12:42] It's just the way it is.

[12:43] All right, so we'll see what happens there.

[12:45] But that was kind of out of left field.

[12:47] And now the cat's out of the bag.

[12:48] And you're hearing it from Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[12:50] I'm confirming it is a multi-morphic game.

[12:53] Ah, new year.

[12:54] You thought Canada would be kinder.

[12:55] You know, I'm just calling it like it is.

[12:57] I'm just calling it like it is.

[12:59] And I usually don't give much airtime to multi-morphic

[13:01] because most people don't really care.

[13:03] And we're all just waiting for Jaws Pinball.

[13:06] Now look, are we going to get it this week?

[13:08] If Stern is going to CES next Tuesday, like a week from tomorrow,

[13:13] then we are going to see this Jaws game any day now.

[13:15] We might see the teaser tomorrow.

[13:17] We might see the full game reveal Thursday, Friday.

[13:20] It's going to happen any day now.

[13:22] Now look, what also could happen is this.

[13:25] If we don't see it at CES, then I think it might be

[13:28] a whole another month wait to see the game.

[13:31] But I keep hearing they're going to unveil it at CES.

[13:34] Stern likes to do that.

[13:35] But they also normally don't take off

[13:38] the last two weeks in December.

[13:40] So maybe because they shut the factory down,

[13:42] there's going to be a little bit of a delay.

[13:44] If we think about when they revealed Foo Fighters,

[13:47] it was in February.

[13:48] So we might all be wrong.

[13:50] And we might have to wait a little bit longer.

[13:52] Now every day that Jaws is delayed is good news for Elton John.

[13:57] It's good news for these spooky pinball games.

[14:00] It's good news for Labyrinth.

[14:02] It's good news for everybody else.

[14:04] Because once Jaws happens, a lot of money, a lot of attention,

[14:09] and a lot of enthusiasm is going to move in that direction.

[14:12] And I know every single pinball content creator out there

[14:15] is just waiting for Jaws.

[14:17] Like we're all just waiting for Jaws.

[14:18] I mean, there's nothing else really happening of significance

[14:22] that has our attention.

[14:24] We're still waiting for Pulp Fictions to ship.

[14:26] I don't know when that's going to happen.

[14:28] I have no idea.

[14:29] You can march up to a distributor today

[14:31] and walk out with an Elton John Platinum edition

[14:34] of the game, which is great.

[14:35] I'm reading the same reviews over and over about Elton John.

[14:39] Everybody likes the way the game shoots.

[14:41] Everybody thinks the game is beautiful.

[14:43] I just don't know how you spend $12,000 on one.

[14:46] I really don't.

[14:47] I really don't.

[14:48] I still think these games are going to be like $9,000

[14:52] in just a few months, especially knowing

[14:54] what's around the corner, especially knowing this is not

[14:57] like a dream theme.

[14:59] I don't know.

[14:59] I just don't see Elton John being a game,

[15:02] or like you're going to want to keep going back and back

[15:04] and back, especially because it's a music pin.

[15:07] I mean, that's the issue with all music pins.

[15:09] Unless the music pin really has a narrative in it, right?

[15:13] And I don't feel that way with Elton John.

[15:15] Every time I watch the stream, it is beautiful.

[15:18] It is colorful.

[15:19] It does shoot well.

[15:20] But what are you even doing in the game?

[15:22] What's the purpose of the game?

[15:24] And I think that's why it's a good location pin.

[15:28] It's a good pin to maybe go play at your friend's house who

[15:31] dropped $12,000 on one.

[15:32] But in terms of owning one and spending that much money,

[15:36] I just don't see why you would want to own one right now.

[15:39] If you're a huge fan of Elton John, absolutely it makes sense.

[15:43] But even then, I would just wait.

[15:45] If you love Elton John, you know you're

[15:47] going to be able to get this pin in just a few months

[15:50] for so much less money.

[15:51] All right, so that's what's happening at Jersey Jack.

[15:53] I think they're going to have to show their new game by the summertime,

[15:56] and it's going to be Mark Saden's game,

[15:57] and I think it's going to be The Matrix.

[15:59] So we got Jaws.

[16:00] We got The Matrix.

[16:02] We don't even really talk about what's after Jaws.

[16:04] Is it going to be Journey?

[16:06] Is it going to be Dungeons and Dragons?

[16:08] Is it going to be Pokemon?

[16:10] I don't know, but did you see that Stern Factory tour?

[16:13] Did you see that Stern video of the move to the new factory?

[16:16] It's ginormous.

[16:17] After watching it, I was kind of worried about Stern.

[16:20] I'm like, oh my gosh, at these prices,

[16:22] how is Stern Pinball going to fill that factory every single week?

[16:27] Like there's no way Pinball demand has increased,

[16:30] with the prices being where they are at.

[16:32] And I just started to get a little bit worried.

[16:34] I wouldn't want to be in Stern shoes.

[16:36] I wouldn't want to have to fill all of that space with activity

[16:39] and people and games going out the door,

[16:42] because yeah, like maybe for Jaws, but then the game after Jaws,

[16:46] how are you going to make like six to 800 games a week

[16:49] if the demand is not there?

[16:50] I think Stern is very vulnerable

[16:53] because they're so damn big right now.

[16:55] And there's been some really interesting exits over at Stern Pinball.

[17:00] Like their engineering head left and went over to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[17:05] Why do you think that is?

[17:07] It can't just be because of the money.

[17:09] You know, we always hear these rumblings over at Stern,

[17:12] like things aren't as great as they seem,

[17:14] and there's a lot of infighting,

[17:16] which is probably normal in a category like this,

[17:19] where you've got all these people making games

[17:21] and you've got your designers who are creative.

[17:24] And then you've got your financial guys telling them,

[17:26] you're not allowed to put this in your game, right?

[17:28] I think that's the tug-of-war at every single game.

[17:31] It's like Seth Davis wants to make money.

[17:34] Keith Elwin wants to make the best damn game possible.

[17:37] I don't think Seth Davis is like waking up

[17:40] and wanting there to be as much as possible in a Stern machine.

[17:43] I think he wants to make as much money as possible

[17:46] with doing as little work as possible, right?

[17:48] That's his job, to grow the profits of Stern Pinball.

[17:51] And the easiest way to do that

[17:53] is to instead of rerunning Elvira,

[17:56] just redo the artwork for a few hundred bucks

[17:59] and make it a freaking blood kiss edition.

[18:01] And so all of a sudden, you went from selling a game for 9,500,

[18:05] and now we can get 13,000 for him.

[18:07] Same thing with Jurassic Park.

[18:09] Let's not make more Jurassic Park premiums.

[18:11] Let's just make another LE.

[18:13] And all of a sudden, we're selling these

[18:15] for an additional $3,500, and you have to understand,

[18:19] you have to understand how cheap it is for Stern

[18:21] to change from a Jurassic Park premium or an Elvira premium.

[18:25] The moment they decide to make another nicer edition,

[18:28] it's costing them nothing, people, over a premium.

[18:32] That's another few million dollars in the bank per game

[18:36] for just stickers, people, stickers and a plaque.

[18:39] Crazy, right?

[18:40] Crazy 2024 upon us.

[18:43] I also think what we're gonna see in early 2024,

[18:46] I'm just gonna make a prediction.

[18:47] I think American Pinball might be closing its doors.

[18:50] I really just have this bad feeling about American Pinball.

[18:53] I don't know how they get themselves out of this hole.

[18:56] Like how are they gonna turn a corner now?

[18:58] They don't have He-Man, people.

[19:00] They don't have a winning game next.

[19:02] They don't.

[19:03] We all know this.

[19:04] The only way they can get themselves out

[19:06] of this galactic tank force hole they're in

[19:08] is if they have a hit title next and they don't have it.

[19:11] And they have no way to get people

[19:13] into this galactic tank force game.

[19:15] And I'm really worried about them.

[19:17] I think the rumor that they have to sell all these tank forces

[19:19] before they move on to their next game,

[19:21] I'm starting to believe that rumor.

[19:24] They were supposed to sell those games

[19:25] by the end of the year.

[19:27] And I think we might see American Pinball

[19:29] be the first one to duck out.

[19:30] I could be totally wrong on that.

[19:32] That's just Canada's prediction.

[19:34] But when I look at the health of all of these companies

[19:36] going into 2024, I think AP is the most vulnerable.

[19:40] Even though they have the money,

[19:42] I really don't think like Mukesh's passion is Pinball.

[19:45] It's not.

[19:46] If his passion was really Pinball,

[19:48] do you think we would have got the games we got

[19:51] from American Pinball?

[19:52] I think he's put trust in people that guided this company

[19:55] in the wrong direction.

[19:57] You're like, my gosh, Canada, it's a new year.

[19:59] I thought we were gonna be more positive.

[20:01] We are gonna be more positive once Jaws comes out.

[20:04] All right, everybody.

[20:05] So what are my resolutions?

[20:06] What are my resolutions for the year?

[20:08] Well, first and foremost,

[20:09] I wanna actually unbox my Pinball machines.

[20:12] So with another baby on the way, we have to buy a house.

[20:16] So this house is happening.

[20:17] There's no if-ans or buts about it.

[20:19] Canada will have to get a house this year,

[20:22] which I'm super excited about.

[20:24] It means I can unbox my Pinball machines.

[20:26] I can be within walking distance to my demon

[20:29] and we can actually live like normal adults.

[20:32] I'm so excited for this.

[20:33] That is one of my resolutions for 2024.

[20:36] No more apartment living.

[20:38] No more living like I just got out of college.

[20:41] So that's number one, right?

[20:43] That'll create a happy wife,

[20:45] which will lead to a happy life.

[20:47] My other resolution that I wanna do,

[20:49] I wanna stop any conversation and drama

[20:51] around Pinball content creators.

[20:53] So you have my word on that.

[20:54] We are gonna stay talking about the companies

[20:57] and the people associated with the companies.

[21:00] And that is that there was too much negativity

[21:03] at the end of this year.

[21:04] It really brought us nowhere good for anybody involved.

[21:08] And I don't think anyone wants to go down that road again.

[21:10] So you have my word, you have my word on day one.

[21:14] I'm not gonna mention any more content creators

[21:17] unless it is in a positive light.

[21:20] And that is that.

[21:21] The other resolution I wanna do

[21:23] is just make this show as good as I can.

[21:26] And I really feel like we're gonna get there.

[21:28] My goal for the end of this year

[21:29] is to get to 800 subscribers.

[21:31] I think that's fair.

[21:33] It's really hard when you're at where we're at

[21:35] to keep growing.

[21:36] If you're listening to this show right now

[21:38] and you're not a subscriber, please subscribe.

[21:41] It's kinda sad to steal my podcast

[21:44] when it's only $5 a month.

[21:46] I went into Hillstone, one of my favorite restaurants.

[21:48] You might know it as Houston's

[21:50] and other areas of the country.

[21:52] The $55 Filemon Yon is now $68.

[21:56] Have you walked into your favorite restaurant

[21:58] and compared prices from 2019 to today?

[22:02] Like everything's gone crazy.

[22:04] The only thing that has not increased in price

[22:07] in the world of pinball is Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[22:10] So I appreciate all the support.

[22:12] And no, I'm not gonna raise my prices.

[22:14] I'm just gonna give shout outs

[22:16] when people out there raise the roof

[22:18] and increase their donations.

[22:20] You know the thing is everybody is this.

[22:22] I'm not gonna change my formula too much.

[22:24] I'm still gonna be hard on these companies

[22:26] because at these prices, this to me is the year.

[22:29] Like 2024 is the year where these companies

[22:33] either deliver products that are worthy of these prices

[22:36] or I think we're gonna start to see

[22:38] a much larger mass exodus from new and box purchases.

[22:42] I feel it.

[22:43] You just feel it.

[22:44] You feel the climate is in the air.

[22:46] Like these games are so much money now.

[22:48] The days of just writing checks for like,

[22:50] you know, 10 to $15,000 on a whim.

[22:54] And I saw so many of my pinball friends lose so much money

[22:58] on every game they bought in 2023.

[23:00] I mean, I'm staring right now.

[23:02] And now like Foo Fighters LE with hardly any plays

[23:05] is a $9,500 game.

[23:08] That's crazy people.

[23:09] You're losing like $3,500 in one year on the game.

[23:13] That's the game of the year.

[23:15] This isn't some crappy Thunderbirds game.

[23:17] You didn't even lose $3,500 on Thunderbirds if you bought it.

[23:21] You know why?

[23:21] Because Thunderbirds was like $6,000.

[23:24] And that's the problem with pinball now

[23:26] is at these high prices, the prices are going south so fast

[23:31] and it doesn't matter what the game is.

[23:33] Like let's take James Bond LE for example, right?

[23:35] Everyone's like, oh, James Bond LE is now

[23:37] one of the greatest games of all time.

[23:39] I love James Bond fanatics.

[23:41] I know the code is good now.

[23:43] I know you guys are enjoying the game

[23:45] but there's no denying the fact.

[23:46] You can go get a James Bond LE now easily, easily

[23:50] for $3,000 less than it was brand new.

[23:52] I mean, easily for less than $3,000,

[23:55] 9,500 or best offer.

[23:57] I mean, I'm looking at these games right now.

[23:59] I mean, $9,500 and then you see all these people

[24:02] trying to sell them for 12 and 11.

[24:05] Who's gonna buy your $11,000 James Bond

[24:08] when one is sitting right next to it for $9,500?

[24:12] And once Jaws comes out,

[24:14] what do you think the demand for James Bond is gonna be?

[24:16] And that's where we're at, right?

[24:18] It's like the market is basically saying

[24:20] that a Stern LE should be 9,500.

[24:23] So guess what?

[24:24] That's what it used to be.

[24:26] And so it's gonna be a really interesting year

[24:28] to see if any of these manufacturers

[24:30] actually wake up and read the room.

[24:33] And there's not enough of these newbies

[24:35] coming into the hobby that are just gonna buy

[24:37] every single new game.

[24:38] I'm gonna buy both spooky machines in one day.

[24:40] Like, you know, like most people are not gonna do that.

[24:43] Some people might wanna do it.

[24:44] That's their prerogative.

[24:46] And speaking of spooky, come on,

[24:48] is it really taking this long

[24:49] for license or approval on Looney Tunes

[24:51] or is the code just not far along?

[24:53] Come on, like seriously, come on,

[24:55] you can show us something, right?

[24:57] Ah, everybody, welcome to 2024.

[25:00] Welcome to Canada Spinball Podcast.

[25:02] I feel like I'm gonna be back on the airwaves tomorrow.

[25:05] I feel like the Jaws trailer is gonna drop tomorrow.

[25:15] that's my thing.

[25:16] The only thing I ask of you in this year,

[25:18] if you have one friend, just one friend,

[25:20] think about it, one friend,

[25:21] who's not a member of Canada Spinball Podcast,

[25:24] you could say to your friend,

[25:24] hey, look, man, I'm gonna give you 60 bucks.

[25:27] And here's why I'm giving you the money.

[25:28] You're gonna sign up for Canada Spinball Podcast.

[25:38] Word of mouth, everybody, word of mouth.

[25:40] Everybody, welcome to the new year.

[25:42] I can't wait to cover what happens

[25:44] in the pinball industry this year.

[25:46] And I can't wait for you to know

[25:48] what I know is happening in pinball this year.

[25:51] It's gonna be crazy.

[25:52] It's gonna put 2023 in the rear view mirror so fast.

[25:56] And it's gonna happen any day now, later.

[25:59] Starts fading, but I linger on dear.

[26:04] Still craving your kiss.

[26:09] I'm longing to linger till God dear.

[26:15] Just saying that there is.

[26:20] Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.

[26:25] Sweet dreams that mean no worries far behind you.

[26:32] But in your dreams, whatever they be.
