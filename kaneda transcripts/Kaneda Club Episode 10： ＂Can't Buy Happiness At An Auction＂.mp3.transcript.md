[00:00] I want money, now sell out some money.

[00:04] So don't be asking me why.

[00:07] I want to be real.

[00:08] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say.

[00:13] Welcome to episode 10 of The Canadian Club.

[00:15] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:16] I'm super happy to be here.

[00:17] Thank you, everyone, for contributing to the show.

[00:20] I'm always excited when I sit down

[00:22] and I do these special club episodes.

[00:24] So this weekend, right?

[00:26] So this weekend was interesting because the Pimball Museum

[00:29] was going on in California.

[00:31] We're one day away from Godzilla Pimball

[00:34] and we're watching these Pimball prices go through the roof.

[00:38] Now, I want to tell you right now

[00:40] that this auction is total BS.

[00:43] If anyone thinks that a Hercules is now $18,000,

[00:49] like a Star Wars premium is $11.5, a Rob Zombie.

[00:54] This one's interesting.

[00:56] A Rob Zombie is for sale on Pinside right now

[01:00] for $5,000 firm and it sells at the auction house

[01:06] for $11,000.

[01:08] So then you have to ask yourself,

[01:09] what exactly is going on here?

[01:11] And here's what I think is going on with these auction houses.

[01:14] I think they're all bogus.

[01:15] I do.

[01:16] I think they're all scams.

[01:18] I think there is shell bidding that goes on.

[01:20] I also think this auction got so much press.

[01:23] The Wall Street Journal wrote about it.

[01:25] I think it was on the today show, the New York Times.

[01:27] It was in a lot of media outlets.

[01:29] So a lot of people that are not part of this community

[01:33] and not part of this hobby, they might have seen this

[01:36] and they might have been like, oh honey,

[01:38] I'm gonna go get a classic arcade and video game

[01:41] that I grew up with and they have no way

[01:44] of understanding what something is worth.

[01:47] Cause think about it.

[01:48] If you're just off the street, business man

[01:51] or successful dude who hears about this auction,

[01:54] how do you know what a rob zombie is worth?

[01:57] How do you know what an Adam's family gold is worth?

[02:01] There's not really a price guide anywhere

[02:04] that you're gonna find, that these people

[02:05] would be able to find.

[02:06] These people don't even know,

[02:08] Pinside exists, they don't know, Clav exists,

[02:11] they don't know any of this stuff.

[02:13] All they know is the shiny toy is right in front of them

[02:17] and that's how much money it is to get that toy.

[02:20] And so some of these fools are gonna get these machines,

[02:23] get them home and they're gonna tell someone

[02:25] who knows something about pinball

[02:27] and they're gonna be like, man, you got ripped off.

[02:29] Like that machine is 50% cheaper

[02:32] and we were seeing it across the board.

[02:34] I did not watch this auction at all

[02:37] because I've seen the way these auctions go.

[02:40] They're stupid.

[02:41] The games are routed, that's the other part too.

[02:44] These aren't museum quality games.

[02:46] And the moment I started to see

[02:48] what some of the less desirable pens were selling for,

[02:51] I knew right away that the in-demand pens

[02:54] were gonna go for ludicrous prices

[02:56] and we're seeing ludicrous prices.

[02:58] Now, I want everyone to realize

[03:00] that this auction is not going to change.

[03:03] The prices of pinball machines out in the marketplace.

[03:07] These prices will not be some new standard

[03:10] by which things are graded against.

[03:12] This is just a blip, it's an anomaly,

[03:15] it's a glitch in the matrix, if you will,

[03:18] of pinball pricing.

[03:20] But pinball prices are on the rise.

[03:22] We've seen it and they're gonna continue to rise.

[03:25] Now, the main reason they're gonna rise

[03:27] is there is just a shortage of manufacturing happening.

[03:31] There is a shortage of supply.

[03:33] And more and more people are getting into this hobby.

[03:36] So the demand to get your hands on these pinball machines

[03:39] is higher than it's ever been before.

[03:41] Take a game like Tales of the Arabian Nights.

[03:44] If you wanna get a nice Tales of the Arabian Nights,

[03:48] where are you gonna go get it?

[03:49] There's no restored collector quality game

[03:52] for sale anywhere.

[03:53] And if you had one, you best believe

[03:56] you could probably walk away

[03:58] with somewhere between 10 and $12,000 for a game

[04:02] which normally used to sell for $7,000.

[04:06] I think what each and every one of us has to do right now.

[04:09] You need to take the prices you thought these games were

[04:12] just a few years ago and you need to throw it out the window.

[04:16] Everything is super inflated right now.

[04:19] It is why if I were somebody today,

[04:22] the only thing I would buy is a new inbox game at MSRP.

[04:28] That is your safest investment.

[04:31] That is the safest place to put your money

[04:33] because if you're able to get a new inbox game at MSRP,

[04:38] you're not overpaying because nobody was able

[04:41] to get that game cheaper.

[04:42] Let me repeat that.

[04:43] If Godzilla Ellie is $10,500,

[04:47] nobody ever got that game for a penny less.

[04:51] And the market value of that game is $10,500.

[04:55] If the game's a dog, which it's not gonna be,

[04:58] then it would go below $10,500.

[05:01] But the problem right now is even games that were dogs

[05:05] that people didn't want.

[05:06] Look at stranger things.

[05:09] That game sat for a year, nobody wanted it.

[05:13] The only reason it's now something people want,

[05:17] it's not because of a code update

[05:19] or people now like shooting the demigorgan.

[05:21] The only reason people want it now

[05:24] is there are a lot of new people in this hobby

[05:27] and stranger things was available.

[05:29] Remember, stranger things Ellie's sat on eBay

[05:33] and sat with distributors for an entire year.

[05:37] The same was true with Willy Wonka,

[05:39] collectors editions.

[05:40] They were at distributors for over a year

[05:43] and then all of a sudden COVID hits.

[05:45] People get bored,

[05:47] people are not spending money on vacations

[05:49] and going out as much.

[05:50] And then all of a sudden there's a run

[05:53] to go get those last 35 Willy Wonka

[05:56] collectors editions.

[05:56] Now, if you spend $15 to $16,000

[06:01] on a Willy Wonka CE now because of the hype

[06:04] and the FOMO and the COVID fatigue,

[06:07] you're gonna lose your shirt.

[06:09] Everybody knows that these games can't continue

[06:12] to go up and up and up.

[06:14] It's gonna plateau and things are gonna sink back down.

[06:18] The natural order of pinball will end up this way.

[06:22] The games that are masterpieces,

[06:25] those are the games that people are gonna want

[06:27] in the long run.

[06:28] A lot of these recent titles, we don't know yet

[06:31] if these games are gonna have long term appeal.

[06:34] We don't.

[06:35] We've only had them for a short period of time

[06:38] and there's a lot of new stuff coming out every single year

[06:42] and when new stuff comes out, what happens, right?

[06:44] You might get bored of some of your older titles

[06:47] but you're gonna need to move some of your older titles

[06:50] out of your collection if you wanna make room

[06:53] for the new stuff.

[06:54] For some of you guys you just need the physical space

[06:57] freed up.

[06:58] For some of you guys you need the financial money

[07:00] freed up so you can actually afford these new games.

[07:03] I won't lie.

[07:05] It's getting very, very expensive to buy these games now.

[07:09] Nobody wants to drop this much money

[07:11] on pinball machine year in and year out

[07:14] because when it becomes this much,

[07:16] we look at it differently.

[07:18] And this auction was funny this weekend

[07:20] because a lot of people were getting upset,

[07:22] they were looking at the prices

[07:23] and they were screaming at the clouds like an old man,

[07:26] I didn't watch a single minute of this auction.

[07:29] How could you take it seriously after just a half hour

[07:34] of seeing where the prices were at?

[07:36] How can you trust these auctions?

[07:38] Think about it like this.

[07:39] If you run this auction,

[07:41] how easy it would be to have your friends

[07:44] chill bidding on each of these games.

[07:46] If they win the auction,

[07:48] you don't have to make them pay for it

[07:50] because they're your friend and you just do some

[07:52] like behind the scenes deal

[07:54] and then you sell the game at a later date

[07:55] for what it's really worth.

[07:57] Like every single game that I saw being sold

[08:00] and you gotta add on top of that taxes

[08:03] and the 18% commission for the auction house,

[08:06] the prices are stupid.

[08:07] Most of them are like two times

[08:10] what those machines would normally sell for

[08:12] if you add up all the costs.

[08:14] So are there that many morons out there

[08:16] that don't know this or is this chill bidding?

[08:19] Is it money laundering?

[08:21] That's the other thing that happens

[08:22] with auction houses too.

[08:24] It's really easy to overpay for something

[08:26] and come out with your cash clean on the other side.

[08:29] But I don't trust these things.

[08:31] I don't think anyone who knows what they're doing

[08:33] would buy any of these things.

[08:34] I would love to see who all these games go to.

[08:38] Pretty much 1700 items sold for more than they were worth.

[08:42] I did not see anything.

[08:44] I mean anything go for the right price.

[08:47] And so it was just comical to watch.

[08:49] It was comical to see everybody get so upset.

[08:51] But I'm here to tell you that pinball prices

[08:54] are not gonna be affected by this.

[08:55] We know that and you know that.

[08:56] The question I've been thinking about lately

[08:59] is where is the ceiling with new inbox prices?

[09:02] That's the part that I'm wondering about.

[09:05] At what point do these companies realize

[09:08] that they do have the ability to find buyers

[09:12] at prices that are even more inflated than they are right now?

[09:16] Because the most enticing pinball machine is

[09:19] and will always be a new inbox machine,

[09:23] a brand new version of something.

[09:26] That is what gets people so excited.

[09:29] There is no way to generate excitement for games

[09:32] that have been out for 20 years.

[09:33] It just is what it is.

[09:35] Now those games that have been out for 20 years

[09:38] and are still great,

[09:39] to me that's still the best version of pinball.

[09:42] If you're still enjoyable 20 years later,

[09:46] then you did something amazing.

[09:48] And the Bally Williams games from the mid-90s

[09:50] are still the best versions of pinball the world has ever seen.

[09:55] Yes, the software is not as deep or as interesting

[09:59] as modern software.

[10:00] Yes, the displays are not as nice as the modern displays.

[10:04] Yes, the artwork isn't as good

[10:06] as the artwork we're getting today.

[10:08] But the physical pinball world under glass, nothing,

[10:13] and you know this, nothing in modern times

[10:16] has been more impressive on a physical pinball world

[10:19] under glass level than the Bally Williams games.

[10:23] And we're still chasing stuff that's 20, 25 years old.

[10:27] And that's why this hobby is very interesting.

[10:29] I really don't know another hobby

[10:31] where the modern version of something.

[10:33] Imagine if brand new TVs today were not as impressive

[10:37] or did not outperform TVs from 25 years ago.

[10:40] Imagine if video game consoles didn't do that.

[10:42] It's this weird hobby where it's trying to catch up

[10:44] to where it used to be physically 25 years ago,

[10:48] but it's made leaps and bounds when it comes to software

[10:51] and to display and to artwork.

[10:54] Now that's why I love pinball because every new machine

[10:57] is a moment in which we get excited

[11:00] about the potential of what that world under glass could be.

[11:03] And I've heard a lot about Godzilla over the last 24 hours.

[11:07] And I keep hearing from my people over at Stern

[11:10] that this game is going to be special.

[11:13] This is gonna be a statement game by Stern Pinball.

[11:16] And this is gonna be one that you're gonna want.

[11:18] And I know for some of you the theme

[11:19] doesn't nothing for you.

[11:21] And I understand that.

[11:22] It's not like most of us wake up day in and day out

[11:25] and think about Godzilla.

[11:26] He's an iconic figure, he's super cool,

[11:29] but he's not a dream theme.

[11:31] And I would argue that over the past year or so,

[11:34] we really haven't had many dream themes in the pinball hobby.

[11:38] Ultraman's not a dream theme for most people.

[11:40] Neither is Halloween, neither is Led Zeppelin,

[11:44] neither is Avengers Infinity Quest, neither was Guns and Roses.

[11:48] To me the biggest dream themes for the pinball buying audience

[11:51] is usually something that the majority of the community

[11:55] agrees on and thinks is awesome.

[11:58] I think stuff like Matrix would do that.

[12:00] I think stuff like back to the future would do that.

[12:03] You know everyone's dream theme is different,

[12:05] but there are a lot of really interesting themes

[12:08] that people would want that would be in front of stuff

[12:11] like Godzilla, in front of stuff like Ninja Turtles.

[12:14] But in the end I do think Godzilla is a great theme for pinball

[12:18] because I don't think people like hate Godzilla.

[12:21] I don't think it turns that many people off.

[12:23] And I think when you see it and you see the world under glass

[12:26] and I think when you see the colorful art of Zambietti

[12:29] and you see the great LCD graphics

[12:31] and you see all the shots and all the mechs in this game,

[12:34] I think this game is gonna win people over.

[12:37] I think it's gonna win more people over

[12:39] than a title like Iron Maiden.

[12:41] I think it's gonna win people over more than a title like Avengers.

[12:44] And I think Jurassic Park to me is the one

[12:47] this will be measured against.

[12:48] Is this gonna be Jurassic Park on crack?

[12:52] Is this gonna be a level up from Jurassic Park?

[12:55] I hope so.

[12:56] And the other thing you should know is this game

[12:58] is gonna be revealed tomorrow morning

[12:59] sometime between nine and 10 central standard time.

[13:03] It's because in Japan it is later in the day.

[13:07] So look for this game early tomorrow morning.

[13:09] I expect people to see this game hopefully in super high res

[13:13] and not get crappy cell phone pictures of the game first,

[13:16] but it's an exciting time to be in pinball,

[13:19] but it's also a bit of a terrifying time

[13:21] looking at the prices.

[13:22] The other thing I would do if I were you

[13:24] and I'm just saying this to my club members,

[13:25] if you have the ability to get in Ellie, just grab one,

[13:29] hold on to it, play it, enjoy it, or keep it in a box,

[13:33] it's basically free money for you.

[13:35] It's always gonna be really hard to get in Ellie

[13:37] as we see these Ellie prices selling for more and more and more.

[13:41] I mean, Mandalorians, you could never get one for $9200.

[13:44] I have not seen a Mandalorian Ellie go for anywhere near 9200.

[13:50] I think the cheapest you could get a new in box game

[13:53] is $2,000 over MSRP.

[13:56] And I don't subscribe to the fact that buying a game

[14:00] and selling it for more money is this evil act

[14:03] that some people would have you believe

[14:05] because this is not a cancer drug.

[14:08] This is not something you need.

[14:09] This is something that's a toy and let's face it.

[14:13] The reason you're able to get one at MSRP

[14:16] is because you are in the know.

[14:18] You either have a relationship that's really good

[14:21] with a distributor or you're just in the know

[14:23] and you are at the right place at the right time.

[14:26] Why would you just hand that value up

[14:28] and give up your spot for the next person online?

[14:32] And I get it, some people will just give up their spot

[14:34] for the next person online and not care.

[14:36] But I'm telling you, that next person in line,

[14:38] there's a good chance that next person in line

[14:41] is just gonna buy your spot

[14:43] and then flip it for thousands of dollars more.

[14:45] And why should that person put thousands of dollars more

[14:49] on their table when it could have been for you?

[14:51] That's how I look at it.

[14:52] I mean, this is collecting, this is a toy.

[14:55] Like don't fool yourself and think

[14:57] there's a lot of ethics in play here.

[14:58] This is not, like you're not doing anything good for the world.

[15:02] If you helped some rich guy get his machine at MSRP

[15:05] when that rich guy easily would have wrote a check

[15:08] for $3,000 more, you know, this is not some charitable act.

[15:12] And the fact that all of us, think about it, all of us

[15:15] could take the money we spend on pinball machines

[15:18] and do something better with it.

[15:20] You could take the $10,000 that you're gonna buy

[15:23] of this Godzilla Ellie with and how many of you out there

[15:26] even need another pinball machine.

[15:28] You could take that $10,500 and you could go by toys

[15:32] for kids who are in need this holiday season.

[15:34] Are you gonna do that?

[15:35] Probably not.

[15:36] Again, when we're at the point where we're buying this stuff,

[15:39] we have to look at it through the right context

[15:41] that these things are completely unnecessary.

[15:43] And that is why I don't begrudge anyone

[15:46] who does whatever they want with this.

[15:48] I don't begrudge people who bought the games

[15:50] at that auction for those crazy prices.

[15:51] I'm just envious of the auction house

[15:53] that is making a fortune off of people's stupidity.

[15:57] But you could zoom out even more and say,

[15:59] is it stupid that someone bought something

[16:01] that makes them happy?

[16:02] It's just money at the end of the day.

[16:05] If someone has $18,000 for a Hercules, God bless them.

[16:10] So be it.

[16:11] I mean, I wouldn't spend $18,000 on Hercules,

[16:13] but clearly that person wants it and values it at that.

[16:16] I think the one thing that was bought right

[16:18] was the environmental disc of tron

[16:21] went for like $10,000.

[16:23] That was well bought.

[16:24] Because if you restore that E-DOT,

[16:27] that thing would be worth $20,000

[16:30] if you put it on the market in the right place.

[16:32] But it's also a pain in the ass to move.

[16:34] That's another reason why people are hesitant

[16:36] to buy those things.

[16:37] But look, club members, I would be patient

[16:39] if I were you.

[16:40] There's gonna be a lot of hype.

[16:42] I'm gonna hype this stuff.

[16:43] There's gonna be a lot of excitement for Godzilla.

[16:45] It's gonna deliver.

[16:46] But never forget this.

[16:48] This isn't Keith L. Wins last game.

[16:51] This isn't Stern Pimball's last game.

[16:53] Guns and Roses is not the end of Eric Minier.

[16:56] Jersey Jack, Stern, American Pimball,

[16:58] Chicago gaming company.

[17:00] There are so many games coming down the road.

[17:03] So many future titles you're going to want.

[17:06] If you don't get a Godzilla Ellie,

[17:09] don't beat yourself up over it.

[17:11] This game will have a hype window like every other game.

[17:15] Haven't you noticed that in Pimball?

[17:17] A game is super hot for like a month or two,

[17:19] and then nobody ever talks about it again.

[17:22] That is how this industry is.

[17:25] That is how Stern has created this industry.

[17:27] They want there to be these small windows

[17:30] in which you overvalue each of these games,

[17:33] where you need to have them in your life

[17:36] or your life will feel incomplete.

[17:38] Here to tell you right now, it's not true.

[17:41] Most of you don't need another pin.

[17:44] Most of you know that.

[17:45] Most of you don't even play the games you have that often.

[17:50] And so the thing we really want

[17:52] is we just want to be part of something exciting

[17:56] and a new pin launch is exciting.

[17:58] And there's that weird endorphin release that I got one.

[18:01] I mean, that is what FOMO does.

[18:03] It's like you're worried that you might not get a Godzilla Ellie.

[18:07] And the moment you get one, you're excited.

[18:10] Now, what's not exciting is when you look

[18:12] at your checking account and it's $10,700 depleted

[18:16] because you went and bought something

[18:18] you know you really didn't need another of.

[18:20] When you look at the Zen way to live life,

[18:23] when you really step back and you turn off Pinside,

[18:26] you turn off these stupid auctions,

[18:28] everybody knows that true fulfillment in life,

[18:32] that feeling some sort of spiritual fulfillment in your life,

[18:35] having a Zen outlook on life doesn't come from acquiring stuff.

[18:41] I know that's weird for me to say as a pinball podcaster

[18:43] that talks about stuff, especially an unnecessary toy,

[18:47] but everyone is going through the same battle in life.

[18:50] And I do think that in this country,

[18:52] we have reached a point when you're looking at what people

[18:54] are throwing money at cars and watches and pinball machines,

[18:58] we are all, and I mean this,

[19:00] we are all so overly consumed by consumption.

[19:05] And there comes a point in each of our lives

[19:08] in which many of you out there will still consume

[19:10] and still chase and still hoard stuff

[19:12] and buy as much as you can.

[19:13] But I do believe that the ultimate peace of mind in life

[19:17] is when you reach a point where you say,

[19:19] I have enough, I don't need anymore.

[19:22] I'm simply going to enjoy what I have,

[19:25] and you can still get enjoyment by spectating

[19:29] and watching others get enjoyment as they buy all of this new stuff.

[19:33] Like it's fun to watch an auction and not buy anything.

[19:37] It's fun to watch people kick and scream

[19:39] to get a Godzilla Ellie knowing deep down inside.

[19:42] You don't want one.

[19:43] Because once you know you don't want one, you're free.

[19:46] You are absolutely free.

[19:48] You feel no obligation to be part of the madness,

[19:50] but you can still get entertainment from the madness.

[19:53] Now I know some of you are saying,

[19:54] Canadian, you're a hypocrite.

[19:55] Look, you're sitting on two or three machines,

[19:58] and I don't want to be there.

[19:59] Like I don't want to have all these games in boxes

[20:02] when I finally find a house,

[20:04] and I finally have more room in my life.

[20:06] I would say that I will probably never have

[20:09] more than four pinball machines in my collection.

[20:12] I just don't need to have more than that.

[20:15] I have these beautiful Neo Geo cabinets

[20:17] and the Capcom Mini-Cute, and I barely turn them on.

[20:20] I don't have time.

[20:22] How many of you have time to play this stuff as much as you'd like?

[20:26] A pinball machine is a very noisy toy.

[20:29] For me, the ideal situation is this.

[20:31] I've got four machines in a little game room I've created.

[20:35] It's away from the rest of the house,

[20:37] so I don't wake everybody up.

[20:38] I drink a few beers, I have a few whiskeys,

[20:41] and I play my machines, and I enjoy them.

[20:45] I don't chase every single new game.

[20:47] My friends come over every once in a while,

[20:49] and we enjoy the games, and that's it.

[20:52] And I want those four games to be dream themes

[20:54] that really speak to my personality,

[20:57] and when people come over like,

[20:58] wow, in a Kira pinball machine,

[21:01] wow, guns and roses, wow, transformers, G1,

[21:04] wow, fifth element, wow, the matrix.

[21:07] Those are the kind of things I wish I could have

[21:09] in my pinball collection, not all of them are made yet,

[21:12] but that's what makes this hobby fun, right?

[21:14] It's like waiting to see if your dream theme

[21:17] will be made one day.

[21:18] But I do implore all of you to just take a deep breath,

[21:21] don't worry about these prices.

[21:23] Prices will come back down to reality.

[21:26] They will.

[21:27] It just can't keep going up and up and up like this.

[21:29] But if it does, right?

[21:30] If it does keep going up and up and up like this,

[21:33] just know that if you have the mental strength,

[21:37] you can absolutely stay in the hobby.

[21:39] You can be happy with what you have,

[21:41] and you can just reach a point of feeling fulfilled,

[21:45] and you don't need anymore games.

[21:48] And when you reach that point, you will be liberated,

[21:50] and you will be able to actually enjoy

[21:53] everything happening in the hobby even more.

[21:55] You'll enjoy going to shows, you'll enjoy talking to people,

[21:58] you'll enjoy the conversations without feeling

[22:01] the financial need to have to make enough

[22:03] to keep chasing all of these games.

[22:05] I'm gonna be 100% transparent.

[22:07] I'm not there yet.

[22:08] I still get suckered into the FOMO.

[22:11] I still, every time a new pen comes out,

[22:13] I feel the need to buy it.

[22:15] There's something about following this hobby,

[22:17] and when you think about it every day,

[22:20] it like becomes a part of you.

[22:22] It like latches onto your psyche.

[22:24] Like you read the news, and even though all this stuff

[22:27] is happening in the world,

[22:28] you still put pinball somewhere near the top

[22:30] of the most important stuff happening in the world.

[22:33] And then every time a new game comes out,

[22:35] like I don't wanna be locked out,

[22:37] how dare they think I can't have one,

[22:39] and I fall victim to it every time.

[22:42] I'm trying to work on that myself.

[22:44] I mean, I ran after Ultraman,

[22:46] and I don't even know if the game's any good.

[22:48] I haven't even played the game.

[22:50] I'm not even an Ultraman fan.

[22:51] I chalked it up as being like,

[22:53] I'm a Neo Tokyo geek, which I am,

[22:55] and the theme does fit with my Neo Tokyo arcade,

[22:58] but that game made me a hypocrite.

[23:01] I ran and I bought it, and it's not a dream theme,

[23:04] and I don't know if it's a great game yet.

[23:06] And I'm a little bit disappointed in myself

[23:08] that I did do that, but I did wanna support spooky pinball,

[23:12] and I did wanna send a message

[23:14] that I agree with what they're doing,

[23:16] but I could totally support spooky pinball

[23:19] without buying their games.

[23:21] That's the part that makes me kick myself is,

[23:22] I don't have to buy the game from spooky pinball

[23:25] to support spooky pinball.

[23:27] Again, I really do think,

[23:28] I do think the ultimate happiness

[23:30] and the ultimate fulfillment in this hobby comes from

[23:34] having a few games you love, supporting companies you believe in,

[23:37] but you don't always have to open up your wallet.

[23:40] This has been episode 10 of the Canadian Club.

[23:43] Thank you everybody for your support on a monthly basis.

[23:45] I'm gonna keep doing these shows.

[23:47] Thank you, everyone, you ordered a Viva Laraza t-shirt.

[23:50] We've got about 60 something left of them.

[23:54] I'm super excited that you guys are getting some fun out of that.

[23:57] There's new Canadian merch coming that has the logo.

[23:59] We have coffee mugs, we have other stuff, we have hats coming.

[24:03] So if you did not want to wear the Viva Laraza,

[24:06] I understand there's gonna be other ways

[24:09] to sort of show your support for Canadian pinball podcasts.

[24:12] Everybody, thank you so much.

[24:13] Episode 10, Canadian Club, I'm out.

[24:15] Enjoy Godzilla tomorrow.
