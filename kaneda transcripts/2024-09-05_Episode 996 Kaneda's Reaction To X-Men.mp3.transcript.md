[00:00] Boom! Should I clock boom?

[00:01] All right now!

[00:02] Boom! Should I clock boom?

[00:03] Every night!

[00:04] Boom! Should I clock boom?

[00:06] All right now!

[00:07] Boom! Should I clock boom?

[00:09] You're saying a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city, a city!

[00:13] Aw, where's everybody that said we don't need another Marvel game?

[00:18] I'm not buying another Marvel game until they see Jack Danger's Uncanny X-Men from Stern Pinball, and it is.

[00:27] A creative uncanny game that has taken the pinball world by storm, and I think everyone is just feeling like relief.

[00:36] That finally, Stern Pinball makes an effort and actually puts amazing mechs in a game.

[00:43] Has an amazing art package in a game.

[00:46] Has amazing theme integration in a game.

[00:49] It kinda checks every single box.

[00:51] I'm really not seeing anything in this game.

[00:54] I don't like!

[00:55] There's nothing to complain about.

[00:57] Welcome to the shortest episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:59] No, but in all seriousness, this game, I think, has reawoken people, or reawakened people's love for pinball because it's creative.

[01:12] Because it's unique.

[01:14] It's not cookie cutter.

[01:15] We haven't seen anything like this in forever.

[01:19] I've been covering pinball for 10 years or more.

[01:23] And I've never seen a layout this unique, this creative, and guess what the result is?

[01:29] People are excited.

[01:31] People wanna buy it.

[01:32] People wanna get in on an LE.

[01:34] Now look, here's the thing.

[01:36] When I look down at this game, it just screams fun.

[01:41] I mean, everything about this game screams fun.

[01:44] I love the colors!

[01:45] I love the Sentinel armor on the LE.

[01:48] I love Zambietti's art package on this game.

[01:51] I love the Sentinel.

[01:53] I love everything about this game.

[01:55] I love Magneto.

[01:56] I love the little mini Danger Room playfield on the left side of the game.

[02:01] I love how the Sentinel can break up the wire forms.

[02:04] I love everything I've seen so far.

[02:06] Now, everybody still remember we haven't played it.

[02:10] We don't know if it's actually as fun as it looks.

[02:13] Is it gonna play a little bit narrow because the flippers are all moved over to the right?

[02:19] I don't know, but when I look at the video, the amount of ball paths in this game,

[02:25] it's like I think there's more direction in this game than like Jaws and John Wick combined.

[02:31] I mean, there's so much going on in this game.

[02:35] I also think, you know, Jack Danger being his second game has really shown everybody

[02:42] why we need new young blood in Pinball.

[02:47] Everything about this launch, his enthusiasm, his excitement for this game came through in his video.

[02:54] It came through in George Gomez's video.

[02:56] It's like I always say, if you give people something they're passionate about, they will go the extra mile.

[03:05] If you hand the designer a theme they don't even love, like handing Eric Minier the godfather,

[03:10] that's exactly what you get.

[03:13] If you hand Pat Lawler Toy Story 4, that's exactly what you're gonna get.

[03:18] So I really do believe when we think about Pinball and at these prices, ladies and gentlemen,

[03:24] we're gonna talk about prices and how games are finally starting to live up to the wow of the prices

[03:30] because over the last three years, let's be honest, the games haven't been wow at all.

[03:36] The only thing wow in Pinball has been the pricing.

[03:40] Like James Bond didn't wow us, Jaws didn't wow us.

[03:44] It was cool, but it didn't wow us.

[03:46] We know Venom didn't wow us.

[03:48] We didn't get wowed by John Wick, but this is the first Stern game.

[03:52] Since Stern's pricing has been this much, where the game actually wows us as much as the price,

[04:00] and they needed that, this is the best launch Stern has had since Godzilla,

[04:06] and I think this game is gonna be a home run for the company.

[04:11] And here's the thing, it's like now we've got this game, the L's are on the line,

[04:16] and is there anything that I wanna talk about other than the wow of the game?

[04:20] Here's the thing, here's the thing, here's the thing I was thinking about this morning.

[04:23] It's like I'm looking at all three models, and they're all beautiful.

[04:27] And I'm almost like, well, they're all too nice because all of a sudden,

[04:32] it almost is really hard to justify $3,000 more for the LE.

[04:39] That's the main thing I was thinking about.

[04:41] It's like, Zambietti makes each package so nice that the LE really does not stand out.

[04:49] Like, I don't know, it just doesn't.

[04:51] Like, it just, all of them look great, right?

[04:54] All of them, and it's like a weird knock on the game and how they're delivering it,

[04:58] but I do think Stern should have made the apron, you know, with the Sentinel artwork on it.

[05:04] I do think they should have made that an exclusive to the LE.

[05:08] I also think for this much money, people, let's just stop being jerks about the pricing Stern.

[05:14] Let's give LE games at $13,000 an exclusive topper.

[05:20] Jersey Jack gives everyone who buys the CE an exclusive topper.

[05:24] I think they need to do that, again, because I just don't see $3,000 more in value

[05:31] for the limited edition version of the game.

[05:34] Now, that being said, I think they're going to sell all $811,

[05:39] because I do love the Wolverine art package on the LE.

[05:42] I think the armor is beautiful.

[05:44] I don't really care about the speaker lights.

[05:46] I think it might have a mirrored back glass.

[05:48] They usually do that.

[05:49] I don't know if, like, the artwork on the cabinet is foiled.

[05:53] There's no expression lighting in this game.

[05:56] I don't care.

[05:56] I love the inner art blades, and I really like the fact that the Sentinel hand, you know,

[06:01] I don't think they could have done the expression lighting with the Sentinel hands where they are.

[06:05] But man, the hands, like, break up the wire forms, magnetically grabs the ball.

[06:11] We've got that sort of, like, locking chamber, the beast chamber,

[06:14] where it's, like, stolen from Venom, where it locks the ball.

[06:18] It's a captive ball that locks as it goes up the pathway.

[06:21] Super cool game, everybody.

[06:24] And now we know next Thursday Jersey Jack has a high hill to climb.

[06:31] They are going to reveal Avatar next week.

[06:34] Now, look, if I were Jersey Jack, and I said this on my post,

[06:38] I kind of don't understand waiting a week.

[06:40] You're going to allow Sternpinball to not just release this game,

[06:45] reveal the game, take all this money, do this incredible victory lap,

[06:49] and look, people don't have, like, $20,000, $30,000 just lying around.

[06:55] Like, some people do, but trust me,

[06:58] most people don't want to spend $30,000 on pinball in a seven-day period of time.

[07:06] They want a little bit more breathing room to collect more paychecks,

[07:10] to buy the wife some more bags, to take the kids on vacations,

[07:14] to do whatever else they need to do to justify buying another pinball machine.

[07:18] And the other reason simply is this.

[07:20] If you buy a brand new modern pinball machine,

[07:24] it's going to keep you satiated for a while.

[07:27] You're not going to need two, because if you get two,

[07:30] you're not going to be able to appreciate any one of them

[07:33] because you're going to have to go back and forth, back and forth.

[07:36] And I think everybody, when you buy a new game,

[07:38] you kind of want to have an intimate honeymoon period with that game

[07:42] and buying two right on top of each other.

[07:45] Very few people will do that.

[07:47] Operators might, but are operators looking at these expensive Jersey Jack games?

[07:52] I'm not so sure they are.

[07:54] I have to see if I can make it.

[07:56] I want to say thank you to Ken Cromwell and the folks over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[08:00] I was invited over there next week to check out Avatar.

[08:04] I'm going to see if I can make that work, and I think that's a great move.

[08:08] I'm super happy they want to invite me through the doors.

[08:11] Not everybody wants Canadian to walk through the place,

[08:14] but I've always had a good relationship with Jack.

[08:16] I've had a good relationship with Ken, and I've always respected their company.

[08:20] And heck, I only own one machine people, and it's a Jersey Jack guns and roses.

[08:25] And I really am looking forward to checking out Avatar.

[08:28] I think it's going to be equally a very stunning, unique game.

[08:32] I think it's a good time to be in Pinball.

[08:34] And I'm in the thread. They're like, oh yeah, Avatar is screwed because of X-Men.

[08:38] Wait until you see it.

[08:40] I really want to encourage each and every one of us to keep an open mind

[08:43] until we actually see the product.

[08:46] You know, if anyone's in trouble, it might be what they're cooking up over in Benton, Wisconsin.

[08:51] It might be Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[08:54] Again, because I just don't think people are going to be able to buy so many of these games,

[09:00] and so many games are coming out.

[09:01] We also know Metallica's right around the corner, and it really should make everybody nervous.

[09:08] When Stern Pinball goes the extra mile, when they actually put stuff in games

[09:13] and they actually fire on all cylinders,

[09:17] their ability to manufacture so quickly.

[09:21] And let's face it, Stern quality is good.

[09:23] When people knock them for quality, I think it's unfounded.

[09:27] They sell thousands of games.

[09:29] Of course, every once in a while there's going to be some issues,

[09:32] but everyone else is just selling a few hundred games.

[09:34] So remember that.

[09:35] When Stern does this, they can monopolize this hobby and this industry so quickly.

[09:43] And imagine if Avatar came out on top of John Wick.

[09:47] That's what they would have liked to have had happen.

[09:51] I would not have wanted to follow up this game.

[09:54] And again, I'm just reading the room.

[09:56] The vibe is incredible.

[09:58] The response is incredible.

[10:00] Jack Danger and Team knock this game out of the park.

[10:05] I really hope Stern can consistently do this.

[10:09] And I'm just going to say this.

[10:10] I think people would be happy if Stern Pinball was just Jack Danger and Keith Elwyn

[10:17] releasing two awesome games a year, one from each of them.

[10:22] And that's all we would need.

[10:24] We don't need more.

[10:26] I think people like John Borg have their work cut out for them.

[10:30] Brian Eddy, even George Gomez.

[10:33] The old guard is looking a little repetitive, maybe very repetitive, right?

[10:38] Steve Richie just gave us Star Trek and he skinned it as Elton John.

[10:42] And these new guys, right?

[10:44] And that's why I'm excited for Mark Seiden.

[10:46] He's new blood.

[10:47] And I think all of these pinball companies, you don't need five designers, six designers.

[10:51] You just need one or two great designers.

[10:54] It's like a baseball team.

[10:55] If you have two great pitchers, you can win a World Series.

[10:58] You don't need any bats.

[11:00] You don't need anything else.

[11:01] You just need to shut down the competition.

[11:03] And that's what two great designers will do for any pinball company.

[11:08] I'm not sure Spooky has those two great designers yet.

[11:11] We shall see.

[11:12] And as far as everybody else, you know, we'll see, right?

[11:15] Eric Minier has been hit or miss.

[11:17] I wouldn't say Jersey Jack has a designer that's delivered like two stellar games.

[11:22] I really wouldn't.

[11:23] Maybe Eric with Pirates and Guns N' Roses, but those games are very controversial as

[11:27] shooters, they're not really universally loved.

[11:30] So look, it's an exciting time in pinball.

[11:32] I got to run to get the train.

[11:34] I just want to say everybody, thank you for the subscriptions.

[11:37] And if you haven't seen the posts, Canada will be back this Saturday morning live on

[11:43] Patreon and YouTube.

[11:45] So check it out.

[11:46] Come to the Patreon page and you can join live the Saturday morning spectacular returns

[11:53] exclusively for members of the Canada club.

[11:57] I really hope you come and you hang out.

[12:00] It's going to be a good time.

[12:02] Everybody, a good time to be in pinball.

[12:04] These companies are finally waking up and realizing they need to deliver magic to justify

[12:10] these prices.

[12:11] Whether or not these LEDs are worth it, I don't know anymore.

[12:15] I mean, that's my final thought.

[12:16] I just don't feel like LEDs matter anymore.

[12:19] I just don't.

[12:21] It's just like there's something about it, 3000 more and I'm looking at the premium.

[12:26] And it's just like the guy that buys the LE is not having $3,000 more fun.

[12:32] There's nothing really exclusive that's worth the money.

[12:35] And it's just like, ah, it just sucks because I wish the LEDs were 10, 5 and the premiums

[12:41] were like 8,500 and it would just feel better.

[12:45] All right, everybody have a great day.

[12:47] We'll talk to you soon.

[12:48] Boom, sh-t-a-t-t-b-boom.
