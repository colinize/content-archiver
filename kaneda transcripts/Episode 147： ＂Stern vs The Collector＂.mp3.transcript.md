[00:00] I know I made you cry, but baby, you're my girl, back down

[00:07] You're my girl, but I'm away

[00:12] I take back all the world where I'll hurt you

[00:16] You've sted

[00:24] When you're at a wedding, you get into a lot of small talk

[00:27] And every once in a while, I would reveal the embarrassing fact that I have a pinball podcast and people would ask me

[00:33] How can you talk about pinball on a weekly basis?

[00:37] We're going to show them right now in episode 147 that there is a constant influx of news in this hobby that we discuss on Kinatus Pinball podcast

[00:46] So let's jump right into it now

[00:49] The main topic of this podcast is going to be about Stern Pinball

[00:53] And I have done a complete 180 on Stern Pinball

[00:57] If there's one thing about this podcast that I think you appreciate, it's that I call it like it is

[01:03] I'm not a show for anyone company for anyone game

[01:07] And when I see a manufacturer do things that's positive, I'll congratulate them

[01:12] But when I see a manufacturer do things that I think is negative and questionable, I'll call them out on it

[01:19] And maybe that means I don't get as many guests on my show

[01:22] Maybe that means interviews are harder

[01:25] Maybe that means they're not going to talk to me at a different expose

[01:28] I don't care, this show exists to tell you the listener

[01:33] My feelings in an honest way

[01:37] And I think that's why you listen to this podcast and I think that's why you enjoy it

[01:40] So what we're going to do is here, we're going to talk about some news items

[01:44] We're going to talk about what's going on with some of the manufacturers that are out there

[01:48] And then I really want to dive in a little bit into Stern Pinball

[01:51] And my thoughts on what's going on over there lately

[01:55] So news item number one, Star Wars Pinball has a topper that will be coming out that is R2-D2

[02:03] We know this because someone found in the code of the game

[02:06] There is a menu item that describes it

[02:09] The topper will have a projectile

[02:13] We would assume that that projectile will be all sort of Batman symbol topper sort of feature

[02:20] But it would probably be the I would assume the hologram, the holographic image of Princess Laya leaning over

[02:27] And handing the Death Star plans to R2-D2

[02:29] Not sure if that's what it is, but that's what we know about the Star Wars topper

[02:34] Alright, the next news item of the day is Highway Pinball

[02:38] Now, I've been speculating ever since these new investors have taken over Highway Pinball

[02:44] That they were going to stall on giving people their refunds

[02:48] I didn't say they were going to not give anyone their refunds

[02:51] But I definitely felt they were going to do a juggling act of controlling how quickly certain people got their refunds

[02:58] And also ordering parts to get manufacturing up and running

[03:02] Because I didn't think they were just going to...

[03:05] If everyone ran for the bank instead of needing my money back, were they going to refund them?

[03:09] No, they weren't going to do that

[03:11] So here's the latest update from them

[03:14] And I want to sort of say what I think this means

[03:16] So they wrote on their Facebook page

[03:18] We are pleased to announce that our game Alien Pinball is now in full production

[03:22] We aim to start shipping games out in numbers on August 14th

[03:27] And onwards

[03:28] We are currently manufacturing alien standard games

[03:32] And we'll start building limited edition games at the end of August or early September

[03:38] Pre-order customers will be contacted shortly to decide on trim collar and possible add-ons for their game

[03:46] Games are available through our distributors which can be found on our website

[03:50] There are still some LEDs available

[03:53] Please get in touch with us if you want to buy a game and there's no distributor in your area

[03:58] And MSRP for the standard is 7,500

[04:02] And the LED is 8,500

[04:05] Pre-order customers who already placed it at a positive will keep the price at the time of their order

[04:11] The models are equal in terms of gameplay but the LED version comes with several extra add-ons

[04:17] Including exclusive artwork and uniquely numbered limited edition certificate

[04:23] Add-ons can be added to an SE game as well except for the early exclusive extras

[04:29] Alright, more information to follow shortly

[04:31] So this is big news

[04:33] Seeing Alien Pinball in full production

[04:37] That's something we didn't think we'd ever hear again

[04:40] When Andrew Highway drove this company into the ground

[04:43] This company could easily gone away

[04:46] So this game going into full production in mid-August

[04:49] Is sooner than a lot of us thought and it's good news for those out there who want an Alien

[04:54] Now the bad news is this

[04:57] The bad news is this

[04:58] For those people who are still waiting for refunds

[05:01] When are they going to get their refunds

[05:03] I'm a little concerned that these guys are going to sort of

[05:06] Rob Peter to pay Paul with this

[05:08] That they're going to wait for new orders to come in

[05:12] And then refund people with some of that money

[05:14] Because why can't they just get everybody who wants a refund?

[05:17] They're money back immediately

[05:20] So that's my issue

[05:22] That's my issue

[05:23] I think they've gone halfway with getting all the refunds back to people

[05:27] But I'm still hearing from multiple sources

[05:31] That their emails are not being returned and they haven't received the money that they asked for

[05:37] So these guys, if they clear that up

[05:40] If they clear up all the refunds

[05:42] And the game's going to production and they start shipping

[05:45] Then I feel like all of us need to give them a clean slate

[05:50] And let them take highway pinball into the future

[05:54] I still think they should change the name from highway pinball

[05:57] And I still am not very confident that this company survives

[06:02] Into 2018

[06:03] And the reason why is I think this game is going to come out

[06:08] At quite possibly the worst time it could come out

[06:12] If this game came out when it was supposed to to actually celebrate the 35th anniversary of alien

[06:18] I think it would have done fine

[06:20] But in the current climate with everything that's shipping with all these new games and all this new excitement

[06:25] This game feels old

[06:27] It feels stale already

[06:29] It feels like it's already been out for years

[06:32] You really don't get two chances

[06:36] To drum up the hype you need

[06:38] To get pinball orders to fly in

[06:40] You just don't as much as people say they'll go in on it

[06:45] New games are coming out

[06:47] And if these things aren't really flying out the door come expo when new games are gonna be shown in Chicago in October

[06:54] People are gonna hold on to their money and see what else is coming out

[06:57] They've seen so much of alien

[06:59] A few die-hards will stay in

[07:01] But when these guys say they have a few Ellie's left

[07:04] How many do you think there are really left?

[07:06] They're making 500 Ellie's

[07:08] Do you think

[07:09] They're 100 are sold

[07:11] 350

[07:12] 499

[07:14] I don't know

[07:14] I would assume that there are plenty of Ellie's left

[07:18] And I think that language of there are few

[07:21] Is such

[07:23] Specifically designed to make you feel like you're gonna miss out and you should go in on the Ellie

[07:29] I don't believe any of the communication from these guys

[07:32] Remember I kept asking Andrew Highway over and over and over again

[07:35] How many full throbs did you sell and you would never answer that simple question?

[07:39] So how many Ellie's are left?

[07:42] I asked you know they're never gonna give you that answer

[07:45] I bet you there is hundreds left to be purchased

[07:48] Okay, so let's move on from alien

[07:50] We'll see if those guys can get the refunds out

[07:52] And we'll see if games actually ship when they say but it's two weeks from now

[07:56] So we should see a lot of people opening their aliens and hopefully those games play better and less clunky than the ones Andrew was sending out

[08:03] All right, what else is going on?

[08:05] So the other big news that everyone's been talking about is total nuclear annihilation and we covered this on my last podcast

[08:12] Which was just like a day of go

[08:15] But in that time period a lot's happened now the I fully expected the following to develop

[08:22] Once you showcase a game once you showcase a game

[08:26] Where is it talked about right people aren't talking about pinball machines in a lot of places

[08:31] Their pin-side is the form where pinball conversation happens

[08:35] Nobody out in the real world except for pin-side users even know what total nuclear annihilation is

[08:42] Nobody really knows what spooky pinball is these companies are so niche so small

[08:49] These products have so little real world awareness

[08:52] So the place to go is pin-side so I've been reading everyone's feedback and it doesn't surprise me

[08:58] The feedback always is I love it. I hate it. I love the art. I hate the art

[09:02] You get such a polarizing response to any new game and it's just it's just the way it is so you have to sort of

[09:10] Emotionally side step that those sort of extremes that you get from people you know, I saw

[09:16] Pac-Man this this guy is an arcade restore works on tons of games works on tons of art packages

[09:23] Just just destroyed the art in this game saying how terrible it was how hideous it was and he showed examples of

[09:31] Other games from the 80s error machines that this game supposedly is paying homage to and he

[09:39] I mean I look I agree with him that and I don't agree with him in like being like such a jerk about it

[09:45] But I agree with him that the details not there now

[09:48] I did find it extremely funny and we haven't brought up this user in a long time

[09:52] I did find it extremely funny that oric of all people asked he asked the community to be really kind and nice and polite

[10:02] When giving their feedback on the artwork the reason I just found that so hilarious is that he is the one person who

[10:10] Rail Don other individuals art packages for years

[10:15] He was always the harshest critic and wouldn't stop complaining when he saw stuff

[10:21] He didn't like and now because Scott's his friend

[10:24] He wants everyone to be nice. I also love the fact that he said I've already seen the artwork before so it's really cool to see

[10:31] You know like why why say that I'm always trying to give orica pass

[10:36] But I feel like every time he has to just drop that nugget. That's just like the douchey thing to say like

[10:43] If you've already seen it you don't already you don't have to tell people that like the whole point of

[10:47] Being in the in circle with people where they share stuff with you early is not to then brag that you got to see it early

[10:57] That's the whole point you shouldn't anyway, so here's my take

[11:03] I think that the artwork is definitely lacking in detail and I

[11:09] I asked people to do one thing so Matt Andrews did this artwork now

[11:13] Matt Andrews did the artwork for the magic girl cabinets for the

[11:17] Razic cabinets for J pop but he also did the artwork for a playfield once before and a lot of people don't remember this or have

[11:25] Shows into forget

[11:27] But go look at the American pinball

[11:30] American pinball's

[11:32] Houdini J pops Houdini, okay?

[11:35] Go look at that art package on there and that was all Matt Andrews

[11:40] So Matt Andrews is capable of very highly detailed work on a playfield and the the artwork that is on

[11:50] Total nuclear annihilation. It's it's not that detailed. It's not that layered and

[11:56] Personally, I would have liked to have seen more of that come through on the game itself

[12:02] Is it a deal breaker for me or for people who are out there?

[12:06] I don't think it's going to be I think the game is is not about the art

[12:11] It's about the lights. It's about the sound

[12:14] People but my point is

[12:17] People always want games so look as freaking awesome as they can when the games turned off now

[12:24] Art is really important. It is very important and

[12:28] Every new pinball machine. There is an opportunity to make that playfield something really special and I think

[12:36] Everyone is looking down at this playfield

[12:38] Would have a hard time saying there's something special going on with this art package

[12:43] It does look a little home brew. It does look very basic

[12:48] But again, it's $6,000 if you want to buy one go buy one if you don't don't

[12:54] The other thing too and this is just one of my pet peeves I have with with art packages

[12:59] Why don't people when they do the artwork for the side of the cabinet?

[13:04] Why don't they lay the art down after?

[13:08] After they understand the real estate of that cabinet with the armor on it and the reason I say that it I always feel like it looks

[13:16] So shitty on pinball machines and this is not just

[13:20] This game any game whenever the art is cut off by the armor right especially games right where there's like the lolly pop rails

[13:30] I feel like the only time someone took into consideration the armor first was

[13:36] Zambi Yeti when he did Ghostbusters Ellie because he clearly designed that artwork to

[13:43] Be cohesive with the with the green lolly pop rails that are on Ghostbusters

[13:46] So I look at the total nuclear lie inhalation armor and it just like the font is not the same and the armor cuts off the artwork a little bit

[13:55] And and you have that huge beautiful piece of real estate and there's just a big swooshing pinball and I get it

[14:02] It's like the old bali midway games

[14:06] From the 80s I get it

[14:09] But if you want to say this is a throwback to that error then you can't you can't crucify Pac-Man

[14:15] For for taking the games from that error and putting them up and saying look at the detail on these play fields

[14:23] And you're telling me this is paying homage to that?

[14:27] No way right you can't you can't see you can't just pick and choose

[14:33] I mean you could but I would just say look I think there could have been more done and I know that's a great artist and it just looks very limited

[14:41] Okay, that's that's all I'm gonna say look but it's another reason why like when you when you release these games early

[14:46] I mean all you do is create an

[14:49] Environment where people are just gonna nitpick it and then that's just like I

[14:52] Personally if I was Charlie I wouldn't even like reveal a game until it's like you've made like 30 of them and you can just send them out

[15:00] The next day and they're they're shipping immediately because I think time makes people

[15:07] You know it makes some people excited but it also will give the community a chance to sort to tear it apart and then people lose

[15:14] Excitement for it so it works both ways on this thing

[15:16] I was so like I'm curious with spooky pinball

[15:21] Timing for these guys why would they release total nuclear annihilation

[15:26] Almost at the same time they're about to reveal Alice Cooper because aren't we supposed to see Alice Cooper in August?

[15:33] That's what the time frame is supposed to be so for Charlie to have two games

[15:40] Coming out kind of right on top of each other probably in very similar price points

[15:45] It's just interesting. I'm from a marketing standpoint. I probably would have spread them out a little bit more

[15:52] But then again TNA really was is not really a spooky game

[15:57] It is a game spooky is manufacturing

[16:00] But this was not a game that was developed by spooky pinball

[16:04] It's more like a game that spooky has option the right to build for Scott

[16:10] So I'm not sure this is part of their plan. I think that Mike this is again. This is just me

[16:18] Speculating this is my opinion. I think Charlie saw that Rob zombie excitement really waned

[16:25] He was probably super happy when he was seeing America's most honoured pinball machines selling for eight

[16:31] 9,000 dollars new inbox because everyone had that that was the error right where we had that fear of missing out and anything rare

[16:38] Was going up in value and because it was a collectible and there's only a hundred and fifteen if you have a pinball collection

[16:43] You don't have an America's most honoured it. It's gonna be hard to get one and so everyone was like clamoring for them

[16:49] I watched it. I saw games selling for eight nine thousand dollars new inbox during that error

[16:54] Then Rob zombie sold out immediately immediately 300 gone can't get one

[16:59] There's gonna be 50 Ellie sold out gone immediately

[17:03] As Rob zombie came out what happened there was no secondary market and the reason why because so many more titles

[17:11] Were announced and people realized I can't just chase every new inbox pinball machine. I have to be

[17:18] More discerning with my money and I have to make sure the game is great and we've heard this from people like rare hero all the time

[17:26] Games shouldn't be come collectible unless they're also great and then the word was out that Rob zombie probably wasn't the greatest game

[17:34] And people started to

[17:36] Sell their games without making any profit and people started to bail on it and people start to ask for refunds

[17:41] And so Charlie probably was a little nervous that I you know look

[17:45] I don't know if we can sell 500 of

[17:50] Alice Cooper and keep the line going so I might as well hedge my bets and

[17:55] What's the game everybody's talking about at the shows?

[17:58] What's the game everyone's excited about to play? What's the game people keep

[18:02] Saying nothing but universally positive things about it was total annihilation. I mean even George Gomez said if there's one game

[18:10] You could get what would you get he says total annihilation and so Charlie?

[18:14] I think does the smart thing and goes and gets it and makes it one of his games

[18:19] I still think they're leaving money on the table. I will always think that Charlie doesn't great quite get pricing

[18:25] He's sort of like I feel like he feels guilty if he prices it too high

[18:29] He's got to stay in business. He's lucky. He's lucky because his rent is like one dollar right isn't his like benton rent like nothing

[18:36] If he actually had a pay rent

[18:39] Like a normal manufacturing company. He would definitely have to raise the prices so

[18:44] This game I don't I don't know when it comes out, but there's gonna be a lot more discussion about total nuclear annihilation

[18:51] Some good some bad and it's gonna be up to you. I do think it's good that it's out. I think it's great that

[18:58] We have options

[18:59] The question is this though like if they get a lot of feedback that people don't like the art

[19:03] Would would they be open to going back to mad Andrews and adding more?

[19:07] I don't know. You know, I don't know. I do again

[19:11] I find it so hypocritical that the people are asking people not to critique these things

[19:16] They and they were actually successful when they complained they didn't like artwork and got it changed

[19:21] I mean I give or credit for getting the hobbit changed to what it is today because it's much better than what

[19:27] Jack showed originally anyway

[19:29] I digress let's get to the real subject of today's podcast and that is stern pimple now

[19:34] I couldn't believe what I saw

[19:38] Yesterday I saw two things that really have just made me rethink

[19:44] my opinion about

[19:47] Stern's

[19:48] management and their leadership and their sort of

[19:53] Just this thing keeps eating away me and and it's the one thing is this it's does stern care about

[20:01] You the pinball collector are they doing things that show us that they care that they're doing everything possible

[20:10] To get you the best possible pinball machine that they're putting the best quality items into these machines

[20:16] And that they stand behind their product 100%

[20:21] So that when you spend the increased price that they have now put on their games when you spend

[20:30] $7,000 $9,000 $15,000

[20:33] There you know their prices go all the way from like around 50

[20:37] 500 all the way to $15,000 for what is basically the same product?

[20:42] All right, let's not fool ourselves

[20:44] What is basically the same product has almost a $10,000 gap in price are they standing behind it?

[20:51] So here's what happened

[20:53] Stern put into I guess it's the warranty with Star Wars Pimball a line that might just look like a line item

[21:01] But it actually means a lot and basically what they said was

[21:06] Dimples on the play field and ghosted inserts are part of normal

[21:12] Pimball where okay now that might seem insignificant and I would agree that dimples are part of Pimball where but ghosted inserts has become

[21:23] the topic of

[21:25] sort of

[21:27] Of the year because ghosted inserts plagued

[21:31] Ghostbusters release and ghosted inserts have sort of creeped up and and been

[21:39] Problematic on a variety of Stern Pimball machines for the last year and a half now nobody really knows the exact cause of it

[21:45] Whether they switch play field manufacturers what not they were gonna bring play field production in house

[21:52] But it's been worse it has been worse now

[21:54] Maybe people are just looking for it more and that's the real reason why it feels like it's been worse

[21:59] And we've seen some ghosting inserts on Star Wars already so that also has people who are worried about this really concerned

[22:07] I'll say this that

[22:09] Clause in there. Yes. I think it's being a little bit blown out of proportion by people

[22:14] I think Stern is trying to cover their ass a little bit because they have people if they see any little hairline ghosting

[22:21] They're getting inundated with calls from collectors saying I want a new play field now the reality is

[22:27] They're not gonna replace your play field if you have a little bit of ghosting and I've said this in prior podcast

[22:33] I've had I've had ghosting a little bit of tiny bit of ghosting on a CPR gold playfields that cost a thousand dollars

[22:40] And those things are made with white glove service and the best in the best possible way you can make a play field

[22:47] And you still might have a little bit of ghosting

[22:50] But the problem is this the problem is

[22:54] Stern is just

[22:55] Sort of doing these things without any real communication to the community

[23:00] And I think that's a big problem with Stern right now is any little move they make always seems like

[23:06] It's it's a sort of a sneak attack against pinball collectors

[23:10] That it's them cutting corners that it's them trying to be cheap that it's them sort of legally protecting themselves

[23:16] from what they feel are

[23:19] I

[23:21] Unrealistic

[23:22] Expectations by collectors and it just it's just this climate where

[23:28] It's kind of becoming Stern versus the new inbox collector and who's who's gonna come out on top and the problem is

[23:36] The new inbox collector as much as they want to run to pin side and and and sort of bang their fist against the wall and and make these bold claims

[23:45] How we're gonna get together and we're gonna tell Stern no not anymore. We're not buying your games

[23:51] These guys are all such hypocrites because I see this with every single

[23:57] Stern games since I've been following this hobby. It's it's always groundhog day with these individuals

[24:04] They always complain about something Stern is doing about Stern's lack of this or Stern's

[24:11] Cheapening out on that and even if they're right like even if they're right

[24:15] They still run and go buy the next new inbox game and I see it over and over and over again and

[24:21] For those individuals who have an addiction to buying new pinball machines and want the latest and the most talked about and the most hyped game

[24:30] It doesn't matter what Stern does these people still jump in with total

[24:38] Disregard for all of the sort of values. They said they were gonna live by moving forward

[24:44] There's also the other part is that if you think pin side can really put a dent in

[24:51] Stern

[24:52] Proof it prove it

[24:54] Everybody on pin side everyone on there who's like the hyper user all these guys don't buy the next Stern

[25:00] Let's see if they go on sale don't buy the next turn

[25:03] Ellie for a hot title like Guardians or Deadpool or Star Wars don't buy it

[25:09] Let's see if they sell out or not

[25:12] Because I still believe that pin side represents such a small small portion

[25:18] Less than probably 10% of Stern's actual customer base and and within that 10%

[25:26] I bet 90% of those people who complain about this stuff all the time are

[25:33] Hypocrits and will go buy the game if the theme is what they want it doesn't matter

[25:39] But I'm still on the side of the customer here. I I hope that's that might not be clear in when I just said over the last few minutes

[25:49] Because I do think Stern is cutting corners. I think Stern is putting things in place that really make me feel like they don't have our backs anymore

[26:00] And did they ever did they ever?

[26:03] The other thing that happened and it's sort of like this the combo of these two things

[26:08] Sort of made me sad because I feel like

[26:12] All my friends at Stern that keep telling me how much we care how much we you know

[26:17] We want to put all we can into these games and then I see on Star Wars Ellie

[26:22] That the signature of Steve Richie. It's not on the playfield

[26:28] it's on

[26:30] A card that goes on the apron just signing a piece of paper now

[26:36] What like what what is going on like why?

[26:41] Why is this stuff happening and look there's no real value like monetary value

[26:47] Unputting the signature in one place versus the other the reason why is Steve Richie's signature is worth

[26:53] Absolutely nothing. Let's be honest. It's like these stupid certificates that go with these Ellie machines

[26:59] They're worthless if you have a tronally and you lose that piece of paper that says you have one of 400

[27:06] Your game doesn't go down in value at all. It doesn't matter

[27:11] These aren't these aren't like

[27:14] You know authentic Shelby Cobras where if you don't have the paperwork

[27:18] You're gonna lose value. These are pinball machines

[27:22] But what what like doesn't Stern know that

[27:27] Every every collector out there wants to see the signature of the game designer on the playfield in that

[27:36] quintessential spot which is

[27:39] Near the the outlane drain on the you know right above the apron

[27:43] That's where George Gomez signed Lord the Rings Ellie. That's where other designers sign the games

[27:50] Why isn't the signature there?

[27:52] And then what people were doing is they were putting two and two together

[27:55] I mean people were making funny jokes jokes like well Stern doesn't want to sign the playfield because the playfield's gonna start chipping if they try to sign it with a marker

[28:04] And Stern doesn't want to sign the playfield because they know they're gonna have to replace playfields

[28:08] And then it'll just be a nightmare having to replace them and also have to resign them all so

[28:13] I don't know why these decisions are happening remember when

[28:17] Kiss Ellie came out and they offered those special versions for kiss fans and and Gene Simmons signed the apron card

[28:24] Two and it's the same thing WWE had that it's just no

[28:29] No like people people want the actual item to be signed

[28:34] They don't want a piece of paper to be signed and then just slapped on the item and it just goes to show though

[28:39] It's like whoever's making these decisions that's turned these days

[28:43] It seems like they're not doing this stuff that their target audience wants and at these price points

[28:50] They need to start doing what the target audience wants and deserves

[28:56] I you know I still think that when you look at where pinball's going these days

[29:01] I look at Jersey Jack as trying to put as much as he possibly Ken into the game

[29:08] For $8,000 and I look at Stern Star Wars and it just feels like

[29:14] Hardly anything is going into the game for that price point. Did you see the video of the hyperdrive working?

[29:21] I mean it almost looks

[29:24] Like so mediocre

[29:26] I hope that's just like early code because the ball just goes in and one goes around and it just drops the ball out

[29:31] It wasn't anything super super special and part of me is concerned and like this is so premature and we're gonna see Ellie's in a few weeks

[29:39] So I could be totally wrong

[29:41] But my my gut tells me that the reason why Stern hasn't shown any gameplay of the premium or the Ellie

[29:49] Hasn't let Jack Danger play it the reason why is they don't want people to see

[29:56] How it works because they don't want people to feel like it's lackluster and they don't want people to drop out of their

[30:05] Ellie orders because all of their distributors have bought into their Ellie a lot of men's and and don't want people

[30:13] Bailing

[30:14] Because I think it'd be a huge problem for them if if all of a sudden

[30:19] Everyone is just like I don't even need the hyperdrive if it doesn't add much

[30:24] I mean I thought we all were expecting balls to go in there and it would act as a physical ball lock and balls would be zooming around while you're playing

[30:32] And and this and that and if that's not the case like if that hyperdrive doesn't really add much to the game

[30:39] All then you have that separates a pro for like $5,000

[30:45] Versus an Ellie for $9,000 is that little ramp into the Death Star that opens up. That's it. There's nothing else different that is it

[30:56] Other than like different art packages which again cost them nothing. There's no there's nothing else

[31:02] There's nothing else that makes that Ellie special and what what I did today was I I wanted to go just go back and and and look at

[31:12] Star Wars Ellie

[31:14] $9,000

[31:16] $9,000

[31:18] What does it come with that really separates it from the premium which is what $1500 less what separates it?

[31:27] What are you actually getting for that $1500?

[31:33] Okay, you're you're only getting

[31:36] You're only getting a different art package which doesn't cost earn any more money. Okay, so so right there there's

[31:43] You we still have $1500 to account for

[31:46] You're getting different armor on the sides that's cut out right to look like the metal grading in Star Wars

[31:53] How much is that worth met that metal grading made by Stern in a mass-produced fashion?

[31:59] I would let's say we put a price tag on that at because it's just the side parts. It's not even like

[32:06] Different powder coated legs. No, no, it's just that those two pieces. I would put a value at let's say

[32:13] 250 bucks. Okay, so where's the other?

[32:18] $1250 going you don't even get a topper with the Ellie you don't get a shaker motor you don't get anything different on the playfield

[32:27] You don't get any

[32:29] Different toys you don't get any different art package on the playfield you don't even get different code

[32:33] You don't get different legs for the game. You don't you don't get anything anything

[32:39] That's that can make up for that $1250. Okay, so then what you are doing is you are paying Stern

[32:48] $1250 just to have one of 800 which doesn't cost them anything

[32:54] You are paying Stern $1250 just to have Steve Richie's name on a piece of paper stuck on the apron

[33:00] Which doesn't cost them anything you are basically handing them

[33:03] $1250 for nothing for absolutely nothing times

[33:09] 800 okay

[33:11] What is that what is $1250 times 800? I want to do the math right now and actually I'm gonna go into calculator

[33:19] On my computer and I'm gonna type in 800

[33:25] times

[33:28] $1250 equals

[33:30] $1 million dollars

[33:35] $1 million dollars that

[33:38] Pimball collectors are going to hand to Stern Pimball for absolutely nothing a million dollars

[33:47] That's more money than Charlie

[33:50] Has ever made with all of his games all the years all the sweat all the hard work that Charlie has put in the spooky

[33:58] Pimball that is more money than he's he's ever grossed

[34:03] For doing nothing do you see what I'm getting at here with Stern Pimball why I'm getting I'm losing my love for them

[34:10] And I'm starting to feel like we should stop supporting them when you're giving them a million dollars and you're getting nothing in return

[34:19] Nothing nothing you it's like if there was something if it was like well you can open up the coin door and there was

[34:26] A hundred dollar bill inside each machine or at least then you got something

[34:30] And if you go back and this is the thing that I think a lot of people in

[34:34] Pimball nowadays maybe they're new to the hobby

[34:36] Maybe they just don't want to look back

[34:38] Maybe frolic doesn't want to look down his collection and remember what he got for his money

[34:43] But if you go back and look at what Stern Ellie is used to give you for the additional amount of money and

[34:50] Remember that price difference wasn't even as extreme as it is now between the pro and the LA

[34:55] If you look at what they gave you you start to realize

[35:00] Man, I'm getting ripped off in

[35:03] 2011 let's go back to what started it all Tron Ellie

[35:08] This is what you got in Tron Ellie over a Tron pro you got

[35:14] Multi-colored fiber optic light tubes that interact it with the game you got a motorized

[35:20] Recognizer toy so different toy in the game you got four bank drop targets

[35:25] Okay, where they were just stationary targets you actually got drop targets in the Ellie

[35:30] You got additional lamps and LED lights you got new game rules right the daft punk multi-ball and play field art

[35:39] You got chrome armor all the way around the game you got all of that all of that stuff which also separated from the pro

[35:47] For five thousand seven hundred dollars

[35:52] Take a moment

[35:54] Everyone close your eyes for me close your eyes and let's reflect all

[35:58] The things that you used to get in a Stern pinball machine

[36:03] That separated it from the model below it didn't cost $1,500 more

[36:09] For five thousand seven hundred dollars they actually put different toys in they put different code in different art

[36:18] Different armor and railings all the way around

[36:22] targets that moved that dropped and

[36:24] What did you get now?

[36:26] What did you get in Batman super early on the play field that was different

[36:30] Then Batman premium right people paid seven

[36:35] Thousand dollars more

[36:37] Seven thousand dollars more for Batman

[36:41] Super Ellie versus Batman premium

[36:44] Seven thousand dollars. What did you get?

[36:49] Let's just say what did you get on the play field you probably got in total in total

[36:55] For a seven thousand dollar increase on the play field itself

[37:00] Less than fifty dollars in toys

[37:03] That's it nothing else different nothing else different

[37:09] X-Men came out in 2012

[37:13] Limited edition Wolverine they made 300 of them

[37:17] Same features as the pro with the additional features real screened dedicated back glass

[37:23] To added pop-up targets moving ice man ramp added spinning dis magnet blue powder coated trim

[37:33] Okay, they made eight they made a there that was eight thousand dollars. So that's where the Stern price increase started right?

[37:41] But a lot of extra stuff in there

[37:45] ACDC limited edition

[37:48] 2012 8,500 dollars

[37:51] 300 units same features as the premium but with these additions. Okay, remember this these additions shaker motor a

[38:00] Larger 12 inch subwoofer as well as a distinctive cabinet art package with black chrome trim and legs an exclusive real screen back glass

[38:11] Okay, so you could argue right here? Well for my star wars

[38:15] Shouldn't I at least get the real back glass?

[38:18] Shouldn't I get the shaker? Shouldn't I get the subwoofer?

[38:22] Shouldn't I get armor and legs that are completely different than on the premium?

[38:27] But you don't and that's the problem I have and

[38:31] On this podcast, you know, you're not gonna hear this in all the other podcasts because a lot of other people out there

[38:36] You know some of them they'd rather just have everyone at Stern love them and support them and I look

[38:42] I love my friends at Stern. I have a great relationship with people over there

[38:46] but I feel like we're getting the height machine all the time and

[38:52] And a lack of value and a lack of value and and that is why my love affair for

[38:59] Manufacturers has really shifted from Stern to Jersey Jack and and I want to love both

[39:05] I want to love every manufacturer out there

[39:08] But I think we've reached a point now where we don't you don't have to cheerlead all these manufacturers and

[39:15] Mike I kept trying to think why why is this happening is Stern really going in the wrong direction and and what's what's going on?

[39:24] And all I can come to as a conclusion is this I think a lot of us

[39:30] expected Stern to turn a corner with Ghostbusters when Ghostbusters came out

[39:35] It was the one game that universally just blew us away

[39:39] It looked like a world under glass. It looked incredible

[39:43] Zambi Eddie blew it out of the park the difference between the Ellie and the premium was really unique in

[39:49] In the sense of it looked completely different. It looks so much. It looked very special

[39:53] It felt like an Ellie and I think we all thought that this was going to be

[39:59] The new benchmark by which Stern made games moving forward and now all I feel is that they really

[40:06] It was really like a couple amazing artists were putting lipstick on pigs because

[40:13] Imagine Ghostbusters without Zambi Eddie's artwork on it. Imagine how Stern normally would have done it

[40:20] How Greg Ferris normally would have approached this is they would have just dragged and dropped

[40:24] Photoshopped art from the Ghostbusters universe onto John Trudeau's whitewood and that's what Ghostbusters would have been if it had been that

[40:32] The game would have just not been received the way it was. It wouldn't have been as fun and I think people would agree that

[40:41] Ghostbusters is a brutal game

[40:42] There's so many flaws in the design of the game

[40:44] But because it's so beautiful and Zambi Eddie made it so amazing

[40:48] We're willing to to forget that and then I would jump to dirty Donny and what he did with

[40:54] With Erasmith and with Metallica Metallica, you know great game great design

[40:59] But look at look at Erasmith. It's basically just a rehash of kiss

[41:02] But the artwork is so good like you get the money because the artwork is so freaking amazing and then Christopher

[41:08] Franchi to realize that Stern was gonna release Batman 66 without

[41:15] Handron art and make it this big 30th anniversary celebration game with crappy Photoshopped

[41:23] Images Christopher Franchi only had a few weeks to save them from releasing that game and remember that game came out right after

[41:32] Ghostbusters so our expectations of what Stern's games were gonna look like moving forward was super high and look

[41:40] I think he did the best possible job he could do and it still looked good

[41:44] It was carlfall the art was hand drawn even if it was repurposed

[41:48] But that's my that's my feeling about this company is that

[41:53] They are being saved by a few amazing artists and the artist are the ones saving the company not the designers

[42:01] The designers are still stuck in cookie cutter land and look what happens when the art isn't great on a stern

[42:08] Everyone is unhappy with the game for the most part and and and the only people defending it are the tournament players and the guys who love

[42:15] The deep code but at the end of the day the game doesn't look magical like a Star Wars pen should

[42:21] It doesn't bring that world to life at all game of Thrones total failure when it came to artwork

[42:27] I mean you can even look at the walking dead and say what what what's this art package?

[42:32] You know they really struggle Stern to to to to make me feel like they're putting the passion into all areas of these games

[42:41] Uh and so look at dialed in dialed in is the same price is Star Wars and has a completely original hand drawn playfield and cabinet package and everything

[42:53] And has all those toys and mechanisms and magnets and lights and everything in the beautiful LCD

[42:59] It's the same price is Star Wars same price and yet you're gonna hand stern

[43:05] A million dollars for putting nothing extra into those alleys

[43:10] This is not going to be a popular podcast

[43:13] um

[43:14] Over at Stern and I don't expect it to be

[43:17] But I don't I don't really care. I expect more from them

[43:22] And if they're listening to me George Gary

[43:25] Jared jody

[43:28] Make these games better

[43:33] Don't give me five games a year

[43:35] Give me two games a year that are magical

[43:39] Me every we don't need volume of pinball. We don't we don't need so many freaking pinball my games

[43:46] What we need is just a couple a year that are fucking amazing

[43:51] And everything else is fucking pointless in my book. There's no room for mediocrity and pinball

[43:57] It's either magic or mediocrity and at this price point

[44:02] Everything needs to be good enough to be in a pinball collection because that's the main customer

[44:09] What is the point of making a game that's just like yeah that within like six months everyone's gonna want to sell it or move on to the next

[44:18] I don't see the point in that and I think the only people that are aiming for that magic

[44:23] I would say Dutch was aiming for it with a bouss game. They achieved it that game is freaking awesome

[44:29] I think that jack and pat lawler achieved it would dialed in

[44:34] I don't think Andrew got to that magical level with alien. How can you say an alien pins magic without Ripley? Come on guys

[44:40] uh, you know

[44:41] I think spookies trying to get to that magical point. They haven't made it there yet. They haven't

[44:45] I think Alice Cooper needs to be magical if spooky wants to really have a future

[44:50] It needs to be how can you release these games when there's like magic available? And here's the thing too

[44:57] We're just talking new in box on this podcast. There are there are like

[45:01] 50 magical pinball machines that you could go buy that are proven to be great games

[45:08] For so much less than these new in box games you could go get them and look them over and see there's no ghosted in search

[45:16] There's no chip playfields. They could be modded up. They could have beautiful shooter lanes

[45:21] They could have art packages that were made in an error when companies weren't cutting corners

[45:27] Beautiful hand drawn artwork go look at the sims you know, I keep doing this to people

[45:31] Go look at the simsins pinball party go look at one with even just a thousand dollars in mods

[45:37] That game looks like it would be the ultimate Stern super early go look at it and tell me that star wars

[45:45] Is twice the price of what a simsins pinball party is selling for now. I don't get it. I don't get it

[45:54] um

[45:55] So that's it. This is my sunday

[45:57] Canator rant I expect more from all these manufacturers

[46:02] Um, and I think you should too and I think you're I think you're all whizing up. I I can see it on pinside

[46:09] There really is just this

[46:12] This sort of dark cloud moving over the hobby where people are just saying I'm just gonna wait

[46:17] I'm out like

[46:19] Maybe he's right on his podcast

[46:21] Maybe these other people are right if these things aren't really magical and memorable

[46:26] That they don't I'm not gonna buy it because it's not gonna bring me

[46:30] Anymore happiness or joy than the games that I do currently own that are magical

[46:36] And I think Stern needs to have ghost busters just from a visual standpoint of all the toys in it all the artwork

[46:44] That needs to be their new benchmark if we can't make something look as freaking cool as this then we're doing something wrong

[46:50] We're doing something wrong if the license is prohibiting us from making that world then we move on to the next license

[46:55] I'd rather have a fully featured

[46:59] Blade Runner game then a then a Star Wars game that looks barren because Disney wouldn't let us do certain things. Okay

[47:06] I think Jersey jacks the doors open for him. I think he's gonna

[47:10] I think he's gonna fumble if he has pirates and it's a theme that people don't want

[47:16] It's shame. I think he should bump toy story ahead of that

[47:19] I think spooky needs to hit with house Cooper

[47:22] I do because as much as people say they love total nuclear annihilation

[47:26] I think that theme might get old for people real fast in the home environment

[47:31] And I think I think as much as people say they want to support it

[47:34] I hope they do but I also think pinball people say they're gonna go spend their money

[47:38] But I think everyone's gonna wait to see what it's like to own one because it's one thing to play something at a show

[47:43] And and be excited by lights and sounds it's another thing to have it for months and see if the depth is there

[47:49] So I think people are gonna you know, they're gonna but don't get that but I'm glad it's coming out

[47:53] I'm glad that they're making it. I'm glad Scott made it. I want to see more options

[47:58] Or at least people who are making them like give a shit. I know he cares. I support that

[48:04] All right, doesn't mean I'm gonna buy one doesn't mean I think it's the greatest game ever all right
