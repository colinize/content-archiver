[00:00] I want to know what love is.

[00:06] I want you to show me.

[00:16] All right, well you know, I don't normally do podcast back to back

[00:20] but I felt compelled to put up another Canadian pinball podcast

[00:24] right after we did one yesterday and because a couple reasons why.

[00:28] A couple reasons why. One reason is I was able to go play Houdini

[00:34] for a pretty long time today and I want to give my impressions of that game.

[00:38] But before I do that, I have to do something that's Uber important.

[00:42] I have to clarify and retract something I said in my previous podcast

[00:48] that was a mistake and the more I think about this, the more I'm pissed off

[00:54] at myself and I'm pissed off at somebody else for emailing me something.

[01:00] So in my last podcast, I reported that the Jersey Jack Pinball CEO,

[01:06] Joel Balber is out at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:10] Now that is not the case and I heard from people specifically over there today

[01:16] that that is not the case.

[01:18] And so you can imagine how upset I was that I would have reported something so erroneously.

[01:26] And it's my mistake.

[01:28] I mean, I should not have taken somebody's tip at face value and just reported it.

[01:36] And you know, I kind of said it's what I heard but I didn't follow up and I didn't go ask anyone at Jersey Jack

[01:44] if that was the case. I want to go on the record for saying I'm sorry for reporting that incorrectly.

[01:50] And you have my word that I will do a better job in the future when I get information

[01:56] that is indicating sensitive occurrences at a pinball manufacturer that I'll do my homework before reporting.

[02:03] So let's move on. We've corrected that. I want to apologize and move on to Houdini.

[02:10] Now I got a chance to play a good amount of Houdini.

[02:15] Now I think we all know that when you play a pinball machine for the first time,

[02:21] it's not something that you're just going to get on on ball one or ball two.

[02:26] So I had a huge, huge pocket full of quarters and I was able to sit on Houdini

[02:32] at Sunshine Laundromat in Brooklyn, New York uninterrupted.

[02:37] I played probably 15 to 20 games in a row, like one after another after another after another.

[02:45] And I want to give my initial impressions to the game.

[02:49] And I've heard you know, certain pinball people give their reviews of Houdini and you know,

[02:56] I've been waiting to play a more final version of the game.

[03:00] Now here's the thing. When you review a game that's on location,

[03:05] you do have to explain to the listener of the show the conditions by which you play the game.

[03:12] So here are the conditions that were impacting my Houdini experience.

[03:17] First and foremost, the sound on the game was really low.

[03:22] And some of the games at Sunshine, their volumes are great. Some of them not so much.

[03:27] But I have to say the volume on Houdini was super, super low.

[03:33] So I was not able to be pulled into the game on an audio level,

[03:38] which I know is super, super important to all pinball machines.

[03:43] I was playing Batman 66 at Pioneer Bar and the volume on that game is all but off.

[03:49] And I think like 75% of the enjoyment of playing Batman is the audio in the game.

[03:57] And so to not have that, I think that's really puts my initial impression of the game.

[04:02] At a disadvantage. So I want everyone just to realize that.

[04:07] The other part of the experience is, you know, there's a lot of games in there.

[04:12] So it's not the brightest environment, but I was able to see the game pretty nicely.

[04:17] I actually didn't feel like there were any, so any real lighting issues on the game that sort of made gameplay difficult.

[04:25] Now let's talk about the game itself.

[04:28] So we all know that Houdini is a game that has been sort of reviewed the following.

[04:38] I think everyone agrees that the game is jam packed and the game is jam packed with features.

[04:42] I mean, there is a lot going on in this game. You've got subways, you've got magnets, you've got two ramps, you've got, you know, a lot going on.

[04:52] You've got spinners, you've got a lot of stuff.

[04:56] So it's a jam packed game for $7,000. Right now I'm trying to get a picture of Houdini Pimbal.

[05:03] If you Gmail, sorry guys, I'm a little rattle tonight.

[05:09] If you Google search for Houdini Pimbal, you still get so many images of John Papadouk's machine, which is really, really annoying.

[05:18] Because there is no John Papadouk Houdini.

[05:21] But I want to see if I can get a high res image.

[05:24] This is another marketing thing folks.

[05:26] It's like you should make sure that your game is sort of searchable and findable.

[05:32] And you shouldn't have to like, I don't know, I'm struggling to find one high res image of the Houdini play field.

[05:38] One, nothing's coming up in an image search.

[05:42] All right, so here's a thing.

[05:45] I'm just going to go out and say exactly what I felt with my experience with Houdini.

[05:50] You can take it or leave it.

[05:52] You know some of the issues I faced in terms of the conditions.

[05:55] But regardless of conditions, I want to talk about my gameplay experience.

[05:59] All right. So I will say this.

[06:01] And I'm going to confirm for you guys that for those of you who don't like frustrating tight shots, I think you're going to have an issue with Houdini.

[06:12] And I know that we've been hearing from the very get go in this machine first sort of popped up at TPF a year ago that there were some really tight shots.

[06:22] And you know, I'm going to confirm that there are like really, really tight shots in this game.

[06:28] I still think that this game has some shots that are almost ridiculously tight.

[06:35] And by that I mean it's like you don't feel confident in some of the really important shots in the game.

[06:44] And the one that really just is like, and you look at it and you stare at it, it's the shot that's directly to the left of the right orbit shot.

[06:53] I believe it's the shot that puts the ball into that milk can cannon shot.

[06:59] And literally if you look at that shot, there's like a post and then in opening that's just larger than the size of a pinball and then another post.

[07:10] And so when you try to hit that shot, you are going to miss it probably eight out of 10 times.

[07:18] Now some people out there like to say that shots that are really tight, they're really rewarding when you finally do hit it.

[07:27] And of course it is really rewarding to hit a shot that's difficult.

[07:32] But I am in the camp of no shot should be that hard in pinball.

[07:39] You know, another shot I played or I experienced in the same day because I went over to another machine during my stint over a sunshine.

[07:48] The same shot I had the same issue with was the death star shot for Star Wars.

[07:53] I think both those shots are equally as frustrating as each other.

[07:58] And they're both equally important to progressing through the game.

[08:03] And they both are real headscratchers to me because it's like why would you make a shot in pinball that goddamn frustrating?

[08:13] Okay, I mean that's just like I just felt that way.

[08:16] Because here's the thing about who Dini pinball, it's not an easy game.

[08:21] And the reason why it's not an easy game is it's a combination of tough shots.

[08:26] And again, most of my review will be the shots in the game because I literally didn't get much of the audio experience.

[08:34] I think the game looks great. I do. I think it's it lights up really nicely.

[08:39] But here's here's the thing. The shots on the left side of the play field, all those shots with like one shot sort of goes into the left orbit, the other shot sort of banks around and goes, you know, sort of through the pops and into the theater.

[08:55] Another one goes up the middle into the pops. The entrance to those shots.

[09:00] They are so damn close to the flippers and that's my issue.

[09:05] It's like it's like building a house right on the street. There is no room for error when you are shooting those shots.

[09:13] I mean, there were so many times when I was playing tonight where the ball would just hit the post and boom, like ricochet right down in the middle of the game.

[09:24] Like even though there's a post in between the flippers, I had some wicked, wicked, wicked dreams.

[09:30] And maybe you could chalk this up to it's my first time playing the game and I'm not that good and I'll learn the shots.

[09:36] And maybe so, maybe so. But, you know, by putting shots that close to the flippers, you are really, really asking for, you know, punishment if you don't hit that shot clean.

[09:52] Because the second you hit that post, where do you think that ball's going? After it's coming off the flipper at full velocity, that ball's hitting that post.

[10:00] And it's ricocheting right back down. And so, I guess my takeaway is you're really going to have to learn how to shoot this game.

[10:10] And by that, I mean, there's not a lot of margin for error. You know, I mean, it is a game that will punish you if you don't really hit the ball.

[10:21] But really hit the shot or take your time. You can't just sort of flip on it the way you can flip on guardians or flip on Star Wars or flip on Batman or, you know, flip on most turns with fan layouts that are more forgiving.

[10:38] This machine will punish you. It will punish you.

[10:42] I also think that most of the shots, I can't really tell again this might have been the way Sunshine was set up. But there's not really like a lot of backhanding going on.

[10:52] I think most of the shots on the right of that game need to be hit from the left flipper and vice versa.

[11:00] So if you try to backhand one of the left shots with the left flipper, you're going to hit a post probably and it's going to come right back down.

[11:09] So a lot of tight shots. And so, you know, I think it does beg the question, will that equal a fun experience for people?

[11:20] And maybe I just played a game that was set up a little bit off and maybe that will make a difference. But I just, I just think like all of the real estate in terms of where your shots begin in Houdini, they're just push so far forward.

[11:35] So I had that issue with the game. I did like the magnetic hands of Houdini. There's a magnet switch that's behind or target that's behind each of those that's, I think it says magic or magnet. I think it says magic.

[11:51] And when you hit that, it activates its hands. It's kind of cool. It's a little bit like the, you know, like I can't tell if it's meant to stop a ball from draining when it's going towards an outlane.

[12:02] But I think it's more of the effect of, you know, the ball's being grabbed by Houdini like in this magical way. And then it drops the ball usually into, it usually feeds the flipper.

[12:13] So that, that was cool. The trunk shot that's up the middle is really interesting. And so I'm curious is like how you're supposed to enter the trunk. Because I don't think, I don't think you're supposed to go straight up the middle.

[12:26] There is a shot directly to the left of straight up the middle where you go up the bumpers. That's almost like a little miniature orbit that sort of hooks the ball into the theater.

[12:38] And so I once I got that shot down, I liked that. It was really cool. The way the ball disappeared inside the theater and ended up, I believe it comes out of the subway scoop that is to the right of the game.

[12:51] Again, I'm not, I wish I need to pull up. I can't find a freaking image. Chris, good job talking about Houdini pinball. And there's not even like good images. Let me see Houdini pinball. I'm going to type in play field.

[13:05] So, let's see, you know, more and more of the jump hop, but you keep coming up and the old images come up with the cell phone sort of vertical on the Houdini play field.

[13:20] Man, this is funny, man. There's like, there's just, I don't know. I wish it was easier to find a nice image. All right.

[13:29] So, the, I did like the fact that, you know, the ramps were, were easy to hit. The orbit shot is so satisfying. The orbits really easy to hit. I, and I think that's a thing too is you've got this beautiful smooth as butter orbit shot in the game.

[13:48] And then you just have like the, the frustrating like tight shots right next to it. And I think the game just like if it just lost one shot and opened up all the other shots, I just think it'd be so much more fun to shoot.

[14:06] Okay. See, the game I was playing right next to it. And if you go into sunshine laundromat tonight or any, you know, anytime soon right next to Houdini is dialed in and dialed in very similarly to Houdini has a lot of shots that start very early on on the play field.

[14:27] In fact, it's almost identical where the dialed in ramp starts and the orbit shot starts with bobs and all those shots that they sort of have the same distance to the flippers as the Houdini shots do.

[14:41] Go look at the opening sizes for those shots compared to the opening sizes for Houdini again. It was just designed to be this way.

[14:53] Now, what does that mean? I think the key takeaway is does that mean you are going to like or not like Houdini? And I'm here to tell you absolutely not. I think what you need to do is you need to go play Houdini and decide for yourself if it's a game that you enjoy.

[15:14] And I need to play Houdini again because I could not fully get into the game with the audio being what it was. So I was almost like hyper focused on the shots. And that's also probably problematic for developing an opinion about the game overall because I didn't really know what to do.

[15:36] I'm trying to listen to the things that are going on. But I'll say this. I started to learn when you hit the spirit sort of scoop. Then it told me what the combos were. I like the fact that it wrote what the combos were on the screen. I thought the screen looked great.

[15:54] I thought the overall like package of the game looked really great. Those two those two spotlights that are designed like like movie spotlights. They lit up the game nicely.

[16:07] The other thing I forgot about this the other thing though is that milk can shot on the left side of the game right the magical shot all the way up the play field.

[16:19] It never made it into the trunk once it missed about an insured it hit like the front of the trunk every single time now that has to be the game not being set up properly.

[16:34] So that's not on American pinball. I think that's on Peter and sunshine and not getting this game dialed in properly. With shots being this tight I would assume that this is a game that is going to require sort of perfect setup to make everything achievable and make the shots you know make make you be able to find the shots.

[16:58] So that's my review of who Dini that it is a little you got a lot for your money. It's a very challenging game. It is a game that will punish you if you don't find your shots.

[17:14] There's not just one shot to punish I think there's there's a few shots that are hard to hit. I went from who Dini tonight to Stern's Guardians of the Galaxy Pro to Lord of the Rings to dialed in and to Star Wars Ellie.

[17:35] Now it was interesting jumping around all those games in the middle of playing who Dini because you know what you do realize when you jump on a modern Stern is Stern does give you for the most part more of a wide open fan layout that at least allows you a little bit more leeway in getting into the game the game is not going to punish you immediately.

[18:04] I thought the build quality of who Dini was very good I thought it felt more solid than the Stern machines I jumped on I had no issues whatsoever with the feel of the game I mean it feels like a rock solid machine.

[18:21] I think you guys who love pinball will figure out the shot geometry okay but I think it is going to be one of the first things people walk away noticing about the game.

[18:34] When I went back to Star Wars Ellie a game I talk about all the time going from Star Wars to who Dini it is like those are the polar ends of the spectrum in terms of how games are laid out like Star Wars is like super wide open all the shots are at the top of the play field and the shots are meant to like whip around back at you but it's constant.

[19:04] I think it's the most ridiculous use of inserts and lighting I've ever seen in the game because it's like everything louder than everything else is there.

[19:33] I have no idea why everything in Star Wars has to light up at the same time completely ridiculous but the game is fun because it's fast I'll give it that like it's fun because it's fast I barely even notice the tie fighter on the spring but I'll come back to that death star shot is you've got this hyper loop that takes up all the real estate in the game it's the main feature of the game and you want to see the hyper loop work multiple times during a game and I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

[20:03] It's freaking almost impossible to get that ball into that into that death star shot it's such an awkward shot to if you look at it like the opening to it is like who thought that this is this is how we should have the opening to the death star the opening to the death star shot should be a lot more like shooting up the center ramp into the Lord the ring center ring that at least allows you to like engage and enjoy the main toy and features of the game.

[20:33] And that's my whole thing with all the pinball people is this these reviews are coming at you from me like I'm a I'm an okay player I'm not great I'm not a tournament player but I played enough pinball where I know the difference between fun and frustrating I do I've played enough machines where you want the shots to be fun and if you want to make it difficult I think the difficulty level in pinball should come from the bottom of the game.

[21:03] I'm from combos and other things of that nature because the reality is is all pinball is hard on some level just watch a casual person walk up to a pinball machine drain their three balls in 30 seconds and they're off playing a redemption game or Pac-Man I mean pinball is hard pinball is not easy and the fact that some of these games have shots where the openings are freaking ridiculous is just a game.

[21:33] It's beyond me it's equally as freaking ridiculous to have a flipper gap the size of ghost busters right or to have cheap out lane drains I just think games should first and foremost be designed to be fun and yes you can have difficult shots that are rewarding but they just shouldn't be too difficult and I think who Deany it's right on the borderline of who thought these shots who thought these shots opening and then you have

[22:03] a ghost in front of them who thought these shots opening would work or would they be to and then like part of it is like they designed this game so quickly that I'm not even sure they had enough time to accurately like do full testing I don't know I just I just found the shots to be really hard again that's just my take on it I think for you guys who are really good at pinball it's probably going to be something that you enjoy but I just want to be honest

[22:33] I this is my take on the game and it's nothing personal against Joe and Josh I still think what they accomplished over to American pinball in a year is a good thing but I am going to give you guys my honest feedback on a game when I play it and I will and here's the other thing here's the other thing and I want all of you guys out there to remember this.

[22:56] This doesn't mean that I won't play the game some more and change some of my opinions about the game now I can't change shot layout so I doubt I'll get really good and and I don't think I'll ever I don't think I'll ever feel that those shots aren't tight I don't think I'll ever feel that way because they're going to be like my opinions are not going to open up the shot entrance but I can learn how to play the game more and I could obviously hear the game.

[23:26] I can get into the game in the future and I can get into the modes and the actual sort of progress of moving through Houdini which I look forward to doing so this is just a preliminary my experience at sunshine don't shoot the messenger all right all right let's go to some user mail and I don't think there's any news that's happened in the people world in one freaking day I got an email from Matt he said she's going to be a good guy.

[23:56] I'm going to show feedback and Houdini he said first off I've tried to listen to other pinball podcasts they are unlistenable to most I turn off after 10 minutes or so this was even before yours I'm just start stating what I hear even on your worst days you still make it interesting to listen to it makes for good listening when I'm at work the podcast with Brenda was solid as well.

[24:26] Brenda sitting here she's smiling all of a sudden she's she's she's she's she's no now she's not smiling now she's looking at me funny he said I encourage her to be a guest on some more podcasts perhaps you can co host with her co interview some guests to give another perspective to the questions Brenda I'm shouting out to you will you come back on the show.

[24:48] She said if I'm lucky with an Irish accent he then goes on to say as for Houdini I get that everyone wants us to be the darling of pinball I want to like it the artwork in color usage is stunning I keep on playing it to try to get into it it just doesn't feel that satisfying I posted my initial impressions on the pin side thread some changes were made to the machine I have access to which did indeed improve my mind.

[25:18] I've been able to improve the play but still not enough for me to fall in love with it I will play it some more this evening after pinball league at analog and Davenport Iowa the shots are tight sure it is challenging but is it fun first time I played medieval madness I grinned from ear to ear first time I played big Lebowski I grinned from ear to ear the same for Wizard of Oz I was not grinning when I played Houdini

[25:46] this thing I have to get used to is the flipper feel the flippers feel very different from any other game I have played

[25:53] Valley William Stern spooky you get the idea I have a friend getting one I will really reserve judgment until I can get some time on a properly dialed in machine but this is just my initial feelings which are still relevant because if this machine is on route it needs to get played people need to want to come back and play it again Matt Drucker well Matt first of all thank you for emailing me I actually didn't realize Matt had wrote me an email about Houdini

[26:23] after I just gave my Houdini impressions and look Matt I mean falling in love with a pinball machine falling in love with the machine the moment you first play it that's really hard and you name games like medieval madness but someone could equally go on to a medieval madness and have a horrendous first few balls

[26:46] so I think grinning ear to ear when you first play a machine it's not that easy to do I think you know Houdini because it's not Wizard of Oz because it's not a classic game that people love I think it's going to take people probably some time to warm up to the game I mean it's a new game it's coming from a new manufacturer it's probably got a different feel to it because it's coming from a brand new company

[27:15] but I think people will get used to that as far as the big Lebowski goes they also had one at Sunshine Laundromat and it was as our most big Lebowski machines broken and there is a sign over the coin slot that says sorry out of order all right well I don't have any more emails because as you guys know I did a podcast yesterday

[27:40] so this this short edition of Canadian pinball podcast was to give my initial impressions of playing the Houdini the way it's set up at Sunshine and to retract that incorrect information about Jersey Jack pinball the final note I want to make is this and this is something that I struggle with because

[28:03] how do you give an honest opinion about a pinball machine or a pinball company when you want to root for them to succeed and you may or may not like their product and I think people are going to run into this with Houdini I think people run into this with total nuclear annihilation I think they ran into with Rob Zombie I think any new pinball venture or game that comes to market I think people really really really wants

[28:31] to have more competition I really think people deep down want to see every new pinball game be successful be fun be something they want to add to their collection I think the reality is that's not the case that's not going to happen that you really can't just be a blind cheerleader of anything that comes out in pinball it's like saying I love every movie or I love every car I love every restaurant

[28:59] that's not always going to be the case now what I think people should do though is give constructive feedback when they have those experiences and don't just be like I played it I played this and it sucked I played that and it sucked nothing about these games that suck I mean I think all pinball on some level on on the majority of the levels of pinball it's a game it is everything is is fun I'd rather be playing pinball

[29:26] than doing half the things I have to do with my day right half the responsibilities I have in the world pinball is still more enjoyable so I try not to get like really angry by any of your pinball experiences

[29:43] but I'll say this though my final point is the reason why people do need to give honest feedback on games is there's a lot of money at stake now for people and there's a lot of options out there and you know if you don't have access to a machine you are going to go on maybe some of the opinions about which games are great

[30:07] and let me give you guys an example of that when I was looking for my first pinball machine and I didn't have access to all these games that have come out for years and I asked people like what's a great game what's a great game if you're going to own one that has longevity and I kept hearing the Lord of the Rings right we keep hearing people say like the walking dead is great Metallica is great I only think it's worth owning a great pinball machine

[30:35] I don't get people who buy pinball machines for six seven eight nine thousand dollars unless they personally feel the game is great I think there's too many collectors out there that are probably just really rich and bored into them like dropping this kind of coin doesn't mean much but man I only want to have I was saying this to a friend of night after going through all the games that sunshine which is great because I can play like a 200 thousand dollars

[31:04] worth of pinball machines with 20 bucks and I basically said to him I would be happy with just like two to four pinball machines at max in my home if those two to four machines were great right I'm happy with one great pinball machine in my home I really don't I think it's going to be really hard if these new companies coming out are expecting to sell like a thousand of them because there's just so much coming

[31:33] and I think the only way you do sell a thousand of them is if you make an extraordinarily great game fun game enjoyable game and that is why the final point I'll make I think this is like my fourth final point you got to make the game fun you can't have a game that's too frustrating and if I was going to design a game to sell to a thousand people 2000 people 3000 people I would make the game I would make the game fun game.

[32:03] Immediately enjoyable I wouldn't have there be like frustrating shots and I think you know you might be able to get some tournament players to say well the shots aren't that bad well I don't you know Steve Bouton and crazy levy and these guys who play pinball in unhealthy amount I don't care if those dudes are gonna find the shots because those dudes aren't buying like these new box machines and these tournament players for the most part aren't

[32:33] who you need to appeal to when you want to sell a thousand 2000 3000 games you know so that's just the challenge that's out there for all new pinball manufacturers not just American pinball but if you want to make a game that sells a ton of them it needs to like have magic it needs to be rewarding to shoot it needs to like make people fall in love with it as as as the email said and and again that's a subjective thing

[33:03] you guys play these machines I encourage you all to play them don't just listen to me and take my word for it play them but here's what I would love for you guys to do if you played houdini please share your feedback with me you know I interview Dave Falgren over in Chicago right what did he say all he said was he loved he loved Houdini it was so much fun he loved it he couldn't stop saying how much fun it was said the shots were a little tight but he had fun now Dave probably played it in an environment where he's with his four buddies and they're

[33:33] drinking beers that are playing pinball and you know what happens when you do that?

[33:37] Mostly all of it is freaking fun.

[33:39] So that's all I'm gonna say.

[33:41] Don't cancel your enthusiasm for a game until you get a chance to jump on it.

[33:46] Everyone have a great day.
