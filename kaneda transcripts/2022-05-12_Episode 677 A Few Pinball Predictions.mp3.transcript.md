[00:00] I was just guessing, the numbers and figures, pulling the puzzle was a part.

[00:11] Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera.

[00:16] Ah, the crypto markets are crashing.

[00:19] Inflation is sweeping the globe, and somebody out there has listed a Batman Super Limited

[00:25] Edition for $60,000.

[00:28] And people are telling me now that Toy Story will not be out May 23rd.

[00:33] What is going on in the pinball world, people welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:36] I want to talk on this episode about where we're going right now in pinball, right?

[00:40] It seems to be like opposite forces are colliding right now.

[00:44] Each and every one of us is probably losing some money in the markets, but as I've said

[00:49] before, I don't think anyone sells their investments to buy pinball machines.

[00:53] I think you use your cash flow and your passive income to buy these unnecessary pinball machines.

[01:00] Do I think the pinball market is going to go for some collapse?

[01:04] Do I think it's going to fall apart?

[01:05] Do I think these companies are going to go away?

[01:07] No.

[01:08] If I were to look at what's happening right now, here's what I think is going to occur.

[01:11] I do think people's desire to buy every single new game that comes out, I think that's going

[01:18] to start to diminish.

[01:19] I think many of us out there are going to be happy with the games we have and the only

[01:24] time we're going to jump back into a new purchase is if the game is something we really, really,

[01:29] really want.

[01:30] I think in the past you haven't had to really, really, really want the pin because you wouldn't

[01:34] have lost much money on it.

[01:36] Also the games weren't that much money, right?

[01:39] There's no way around it.

[01:40] And let's face it, the smartest ones to go in on are going to be your LEs and your CEs.

[01:45] They're just so expensive now.

[01:47] So if you want to spend $12,000 or $15,000, that's just a lot of money out of pocket

[01:53] for people.

[01:54] We're also on the summer months and I think for a lot of you out there, you're probably

[01:58] planning vacations with your family.

[02:00] You're probably about to spend money on some other high ticket items.

[02:04] And so will you pause your pinball purchases in 2022 as we go into spring summer?

[02:10] Now I said on the last show I thought this was like the perfect time for Jersey Jack

[02:13] Pinball to release Toy Story.

[02:16] And I still feel that way.

[02:17] I think if Toy Story comes out sometime in the next month or so, I think they're going

[02:21] to have the most tremendous sales they've ever had for a pinball machine in the single

[02:25] week of sales.

[02:26] I do.

[02:27] I think they're going to sell more of these than Guns N' Roses.

[02:30] They will sell more of these than Wizard of Oz and any of their other titles.

[02:35] Toy Story is a game that's just going to cross generations and it's also a game that every

[02:39] family household who has a pinball machine, you best believe anyone who asks their wives

[02:44] or their kids, hey, do you want Toy Story pinball?

[02:47] You're going to get a lot more enthusiasm than you would if you said Rush or Venom.

[02:52] So I think it's going to do very well.

[02:53] Will it be Pat Lawler's greatest pin ever, a JJP?

[02:57] Will it be one of his best pins of all time?

[02:59] I don't know yet.

[03:00] I am a little bit worried that this game will not be packed.

[03:03] But I cannot and will not accept a game called Toy Story without a lot of toys.

[03:09] See here's the problem.

[03:10] As the narrative writes itself, like the worst headline ever would be this, Jersey Jack

[03:16] Pinball and legendary pinball designer Pat Lawler today released Toy Story Pinball without

[03:22] any toys.

[03:23] Right?

[03:24] You don't want to hear that.

[03:25] We don't want to have the subhead be all of the great moments you love of Buzz and Woody

[03:29] come to life on the LCD screen.

[03:32] No, we want to see this game loaded with toys.

[03:35] I think anything else is going to be seen as a failure.

[03:38] I do.

[03:39] I think it's going to be seen as lazy and cost cutting.

[03:42] And I hope we really get a lot of magical toys in this game.

[03:47] And the other unfortunate part, right?

[03:48] If you look at a theme like Godfather, you could arguably say, well, what would the

[03:52] mechs or toys be in Godfather?

[03:55] You might come up short with what those things could be.

[03:58] But with Toy Story spanning these four movies filled with toys, there are about 75 different

[04:05] toys in these movies that you could make in physical form and have them do something

[04:10] interesting in a pinball machine.

[04:13] So there's no way out of this.

[04:15] This game has to have toys or it's going to be a failure.

[04:17] I'm a little bit bummed out that I'm hearing May 23rd is not the date.

[04:21] How long are we going to wait?

[04:23] Now we know the Buzz Lightyear movie is mid June.

[04:26] So this game is basically probably going to come out sometime between now and then.

[04:32] I'm still holding to end of May as the reveal of the game.

[04:35] So I said May 23rd.

[04:37] That's a Monday.

[04:38] Now we know Jersey Jack released guns and roses on a Monday.

[04:41] So if they don't hit May 23rd, maybe it's May 30th.

[04:45] Who knows, right?

[04:46] I do know this.

[04:47] They've stopped teasing the game.

[04:49] And I really wish they would put out more teasers for Toy Story.

[04:52] We got that one image on Facebook of the coils that look like plants about to sprout.

[04:57] And then we got nothing else.

[04:59] Now if you're making a pinball machine, it's really easy to tease each and every one of

[05:03] us.

[05:04] Usually we'll see like the upside down of the play field, right?

[05:07] The lift the hood and show us what's underneath.

[05:10] Remember Eric showed us that with guns and roses.

[05:12] We got to see underneath the play field before we saw the game and all the cutouts, all the

[05:16] inserts.

[05:17] There really doesn't seem to be much of a marketing effort happening here.

[05:20] I know you don't need it.

[05:21] This game is going to sell anyway.

[05:23] But I would like to see Jersey Jack pinball each week leading up to Toy Story.

[05:28] Start to tease more and more and more.

[05:30] Now here's where I get a little bit concerned.

[05:33] Maybe the reason why they're not doing that is they're not really ready.

[05:37] And they know the game's not about to ship in the next few weeks.

[05:40] And that's why they're holding back their teaser program.

[05:42] I'm not sure.

[05:43] I am just speculating.

[05:45] But I would have to imagine that if I was marketing the release of a pinball machine, I would

[05:49] be working back from the ship date about two months.

[05:53] About two months out, I would start to really get people excited about my next title.

[05:57] Who knows?

[05:58] We will see where this goes.

[05:59] The other thing that's happening in pinball right now is if you bought a game like Godzilla,

[06:04] the game just keeps getting better and better and better.

[06:08] I was seeing people just gush over the new like Terror Mechagodzilla Wizard mode.

[06:13] And this game to me, if you own one, you're going to be very satiated with your pinball

[06:18] experience throughout the year.

[06:20] And I know a lot of you are waiting for your Godzilla's.

[06:23] I see a Godzilla premium for sale for $14,000 on pin side.

[06:28] That's crazy.

[06:29] $5,000 over because you're waiting for it.

[06:32] I would not spend that money.

[06:34] Stern is going to make Godzilla premiums for years to come.

[06:38] So just be patient.

[06:39] But when I go into the Godzilla thread, it's a lovely place to go because everybody is

[06:44] loving this game.

[06:46] Every code update is making this game much, much better.

[06:49] And this game shoots amazingly well.

[06:51] It's a great world under glass.

[06:52] The other thing that people are doing with Godzilla is they're modding the game and

[06:56] they're having a lot of fun adding things to this game.

[06:59] And I think this world under glass lends itself so nicely to the mods I'm seeing people put

[07:04] into the game.

[07:06] The one mod I'm not crazy about, I saw there's a Translight mod.

[07:09] I don't know who makes this.

[07:10] Maybe it's Mezzlemods.

[07:11] I'm not sure.

[07:12] I just threw that out there.

[07:13] It's like the classic Godzilla movie poster artwork.

[07:17] It just doesn't work.

[07:18] If there's one thing you shouldn't do on a pinball machine, it's Mix Artist.

[07:22] And I know that like Brian Allen does Translights for Cactus Canyon, but there's something about

[07:27] cohesiveness to artwork in a pinball machine that I think you need to consider.

[07:32] Now look, I'm not going to tell you what to do with your machines, but if I were you,

[07:35] I would not have Zombie Eddie's artwork interrupted with a classic Godzilla poster.

[07:41] It just doesn't look right.

[07:42] It looks off.

[07:43] It looks weird.

[07:44] Lover hate the fact that Zombie Eddie did Godzilla.

[07:46] His artwork on the Translight is one of the best parts of the actual art package.

[07:51] I would not change that Translight.

[07:53] I think for many of you out there, whether you have a Godzilla or a stranger things,

[07:57] you've had a lot of really good stern machines in your arsenal over the last few years.

[08:03] And because of that, I think many of you out there are going to say, you know what?

[08:06] I'm good.

[08:07] I'm good.

[08:08] I don't need to buy every single nine to $12,000 pinball machine that comes out.

[08:13] And there's just no way around this fact.

[08:15] As the stock market and people's investments go south and people have less disposable income

[08:20] and it's just going to be that way.

[08:22] I don't think the used pinball market can sustain itself much longer where it's been

[08:27] at.

[08:28] It's been absolutely bonkers crazy, crazy where people are spending like 18,000 on

[08:33] a game like Jurassic Park, LE or 16, five on a stranger things, LE.

[08:39] Once Stern catches up with production and starts making premiums of all of these games

[08:45] again, remember because the premium is the same exact experience as the LE.

[08:51] There is absolutely nothing that an LE does better than a premium.

[08:55] I think once they catch up with premium production, you're going to see the market soft in a

[09:00] lot.

[09:01] It's not there yet.

[09:02] We still have a lot of supply shortage going on with inventory when it comes to distributors

[09:06] and what they can sell you, but it's not going to be like that forever.

[09:09] All right.

[09:10] What else is going on besides looking at your wallet and realizing you lost a pinball machine

[09:14] or two in crypto this week?

[09:15] Okay.

[09:16] So here's what's going on in pinball.

[09:18] Dutch pinball has shared an image of all of these big Lebowski's about to be picked

[09:22] up.

[09:23] Cool image, but I'll never be fully impressed because as I stare at that image in 2022,

[09:28] I still know that I'm seeing somebody's game that was paid in fall in one of those boxes

[09:33] and that person still has not got their game and that is like eight years ago.

[09:38] So I like that.

[09:39] Dutch pinball is slowly figuring this out, but they're just not a company that I will

[09:44] ever congratulate for doing it this way.

[09:48] I don't think a company that robs Peter to pay Paul should ever really be congratulated.

[09:54] Now great, you're getting it done, but I am not going to be satisfied until every single

[09:59] original owner of a big Lebowski gets their game.

[10:03] And it still makes me sick when I see people buy this game for like 12, 5 or 13 and then

[10:09] flip it for $18,000.

[10:11] You make $5,000 on your game and the original buyer who gave Barry and Yop 8,500 still has

[10:20] nothing.

[10:21] It's not worth celebrating people.

[10:24] Speaking of celebrations, can we just talk about this for a minute and I think this is

[10:28] the most ridiculous item of the week.

[10:31] On Monday, it will be three weeks ago in which Haggis Pinball put up their reveal video,

[10:36] which you know how I feel.

[10:37] It was a staged reveal video.

[10:39] Okay, so three weeks later in which one game went into a box, ask me how many games have

[10:45] we seen unboxed since then and the answer is zero.

[10:50] And what's even funnier is people are trying to track where this game is in Australia and

[10:55] when it's going to be unboxed and I get it like Australia is a huge place.

[11:00] It's like almost the size of America, right?

[11:03] It's like picking up a game in New York and driving it to Las Vegas.

[11:06] It's going to take time to get to its destination, but that's not the part that's ridiculous.

[11:11] So that was three weeks ago in this three week time period.

[11:16] Have no other Haggis games been built?

[11:20] Have no other fathoms been picked up?

[11:22] And if they have been picked up, it then begs the question, why haven't we seen one photo,

[11:28] just one photo of multiple games about to be picked up?

[11:33] You know what hasn't happened?

[11:34] None of them have shipped.

[11:36] But nothing has shipped.

[11:37] People have driven to the factory and picked up a game.

[11:40] No games have been shipped.

[11:41] There is not a bulk amount of these games going out the door.

[11:45] And I just want to know like the rest of you, why is it still a secret what is happening

[11:51] every week over at Haggis and the fact that everyone who's in on this game is following

[11:57] the journey of just one game?

[12:00] Like what is that prove if one game is unboxed?

[12:03] For Damien to hit his goal of finishing all of these games by the end of the year, they

[12:09] need to be making at least five games a week.

[12:13] So three weeks have gone by.

[12:15] Where is the image of 15 fathoms built?

[12:19] And this story just keeps getting better and better.

[12:23] I still don't have tremendous faith and there's nothing anybody can do because you paid for

[12:29] your games with nonrefundable deposits.

[12:32] And the other thing is this, for some of you out there who paid in fall and were promised

[12:37] you'd have your game in eight weeks, that eight weeks is up at the end of this week.

[12:43] And you didn't get your game.

[12:45] But let's have revisionist history.

[12:47] Let's have Kim Mitchell text me that he's still in, but he's nervous.

[12:50] That's what he's been saying.

[12:51] He's still in.

[12:52] I love you, Kim Mitchell.

[12:53] I know you listen to the show.

[12:54] And we're finally getting Flinnybus to hold this company accountable.

[12:58] Like he's finally back into the thread.

[13:00] And it's amazing to me because if any other company pulled this, if any other company

[13:04] pulled these shenanigans, people would be all over them.

[13:08] I thought the Aussies were like tough.

[13:10] I thought they held people accountable.

[13:12] I thought they took no bullocks from people, but here they are falling over like lawn chairs

[13:18] as pumpkin.

[13:19] His name is Gary continues to defend this company to no end.

[13:22] It's kind of funny.

[13:23] Now, speaking of defending a company to no end, the other thing I've just been thinking

[13:27] about is like spooky pimple and how there's just absolutely no conversation happening

[13:31] around both Ultraman or Halloween.

[13:34] They said they were getting new animators to work on these games.

[13:37] Has anyone seen an update?

[13:38] Has anyone seen anything?

[13:40] I'm a little worried.

[13:41] Here's what I'm worried about.

[13:42] I think these games are going to continue to go south.

[13:45] I think these games are right now trading somewhere between $7,200 and $7,500.

[13:51] I think once Toy Story comes out, I think once more Cactus Canyon starts shipping and

[13:56] I think once we get closer to August in which Stern's next game is coming out, I think you're

[14:02] going to see both Ultraman and Halloween collector's editions go into the high $6,000 range.

[14:10] And sadly, I don't think the price drop is going to stop there.

[14:15] My prediction by the end of the year, because more of them are going to be out in the world,

[14:21] they're not going to get better.

[14:22] These games are not going to get much better.

[14:24] My prediction is by the end of the year, both Halloween and Ultraman will be games that

[14:30] will trade roughly around $6,200.

[14:34] And I mean that for a collector's edition.

[14:36] And if you've got the butter cabinet, you're going to lose even more money.

[14:39] And I just don't think there's any way to turn these games around.

[14:43] They don't have the love affair that Rick and Morty had.

[14:47] And people are just feeling absolutely zero excitement or enthusiasm for these games.

[14:54] And again, it's just that bad.

[14:56] These games just can't seem to turn the corner.

[14:58] All right, speaking of turning the corner, will Ryan McQuade joining American Pinball

[15:03] turn the corner for American Pinball?

[15:05] Will Dennis Nordman's game turn the corner for American Pinball?

[15:09] Now I have spoken to both Ryan McQuade and to David Fix and they have agreed to come

[15:14] on Canada's Pinball podcast.

[15:15] So you're hearing it here first.

[15:17] We are trying to find a time.

[15:19] Now if you saw Ryan McQuade's post earlier this week, he has basically confirmed that

[15:25] they do not have the license for Sonic the Hedgehog.

[15:28] That is what Canada reported.

[15:30] He also said he used the game to become his resume to getting a job in the pinball industry.

[15:37] Can't argue with him on that.

[15:38] He got a job with American Pinball.

[15:40] Now do I think Ryan McQuade wants to make a game that is not Sonic the Hedgehog?

[15:46] Well look, is he capable of designing a game?

[15:49] Yes.

[15:50] Will he ever have as much love or passion for another title like he did with Sonic?

[15:56] I don't know how you do it, right?

[15:58] Because Sonic is like his dream theme of all time.

[16:01] It's like his holy grail pinball theme that he always wanted to see and he made it.

[16:06] So I think it is sad that he's not going to be making his dream theme.

[16:10] What will he make?

[16:11] Here's the thing.

[16:12] I don't know.

[16:13] And we're so many years away from seeing what it is.

[16:16] See I think companies like American Pinball, if you were to ask me, I think companies

[16:20] like American Pinball are the companies that are a little bit on the bubble.

[16:25] They are the companies that will be vulnerable if people put more of their money back in

[16:30] their wallet and don't buy every single new pinball machine that comes out.

[16:35] Because the problem for companies like American Pinball is they don't really have licensed

[16:40] themes.

[16:41] So when they put out a new game, there's not an existing fan base for that theme usually.

[16:47] And they have to work like five times as hard as a company like Stern or Jersey Jack to

[16:52] get you excited about the game.

[16:54] Because if you've got Dennis Nordman making an original game and you're going to charge

[16:59] like eight to nine thousand dollars for it, maybe more.

[17:02] And I can go get the best games that Balli Williams ever made for eight to nine thousand

[17:07] dollars.

[17:08] You basically are saying to people to entice you to buy a game that's an original IP from

[17:13] a designer like Dennis Nordman.

[17:15] This game needs to be loaded like a Balli Williams game from the 90s.

[17:20] If it's anything less, if it's barren like Hot Wheels, if it doesn't have a lot of really

[17:25] cool stuff happening under the glass, I don't see why people would run and go buy it.

[17:31] The only reason Legends of Vahala sold through when it did is because there was nothing available.

[17:38] Absolutely nothing available.

[17:40] Inventory was short.

[17:41] And don't forget this part.

[17:42] When they sold Legends of Vahala, Bitcoin was like sixty thousand dollars.

[17:48] Disney stock was a hundred and ninety dollars.

[17:50] Now it's a hundred bucks.

[17:51] The market was much hotter.

[17:54] People were throwing money at this stuff left and right like there was no tomorrow and they

[17:59] hit at the right time.

[18:01] But now that the market has cooled down, how many of those five hundred Legends of Vahalas

[18:07] do you think people are regretting getting right now?

[18:11] And my prediction is this.

[18:12] I think a lot of those games were sold to distributors.

[18:15] I think they're going to be sitting on them for a while.

[18:18] And I do not think you're going to have a hard time getting Legends of Vahala like deluxe

[18:23] edition.

[18:24] I think they're going to be sitting and I think people's money is going to go elsewhere

[18:27] because it's not even a good investment.

[18:29] If you buy one, you're immediately going to lose a thousand to two thousand dollars.

[18:34] That's just the way the market goes.

[18:36] And nothing drops in price like an original IP game.

[18:40] Go look at dialed in.

[18:42] Dialed in has more in it than like every single American pinball game combined.

[18:47] And it came out around nine grand and now you can get them in like the seven thousand

[18:51] dollar range.

[18:52] And there's like no demand for it.

[18:54] And that's what's crazy to me is I could go buy a dialed in tomorrow over a Legends of

[18:59] Vahala.

[19:00] It's not even a question of which one I'd rather have dialed in.

[19:03] All right.

[19:04] What else is going on in pinball?

[19:05] What about multi-morphic P3?

[19:07] Jerry's looking for friends or friends to make these games.

[19:10] So clearly Jerry is having the same problem as Damien.

[19:13] Both of these guys are very similar.

[19:15] When I hear people talk about both of them, they're very stubborn.

[19:18] They don't really want to listen to other people and they think their way is the right

[19:23] way.

[19:24] But what's happening with both of them is this.

[19:26] They're having a problem finding workers.

[19:29] The biggest challenge in making pinball machine next to parts is finding enough skilled workers

[19:36] to work on these games.

[19:38] This is not a fun industry to work in.

[19:41] Would you want to be on a line making pinball machines for like twenty dollars an hour?

[19:46] You could make what they probably pay people to build pinball machines.

[19:51] You could probably make that money doing something so much easier.

[19:56] It is not a fun job.

[19:57] We know that Jersey Jack used to use temp workers.

[20:01] Maybe they still do.

[20:02] Temp workers to make highly skilled pinball machines.

[20:06] And so it's not fun.

[20:07] And so finding labor is just as hard as finding the parts.

[20:11] And if you look at P3 multi-morphic, it's like how many weird owls have gone out the

[20:16] door?

[20:17] Are we seeing Jerry share photos of games completed?

[20:20] We're not seeing anything.

[20:21] There's absolutely nothing going out.

[20:24] He took money and he told you the wait would be long.

[20:27] Like Jerry didn't lie to anybody.

[20:28] He said the wait would be long and he said you can't get your money back unless he missed

[20:33] that date by six months.

[20:34] But I really can't wait till we get games on the line again.

[20:38] I really can't wait to game start shipping and all of our hope and all of our faith is

[20:43] now in Jersey Jack Pinball.

[20:45] Like can they deliver a magical toy story game?

[20:48] I don't know people.

[20:49] I'm pretty nervous.

[20:50] I am nervous because Pat Lawler was the guy yanking stuff out of Pyre to the Caribbean.

[20:55] He was the guy that made Wonka simpler.

[20:58] So I am really, really nervous that Pat Lawler might be like the rest of those guys from

[21:04] the 90s.

[21:05] And what I mean by that is they stood on the shoulders of the engineers over at Balli

[21:10] Williams.

[21:11] It was the engineers over at Balli Williams that made all those magical mechs in Twilight

[21:15] Zone, in Addams Family, in Theater of Magic, in Toten.

[21:20] Right?

[21:21] We keep giving these designers credit.

[21:22] Like look at what Brian Eddy has done since Medieval Madness.

[21:26] Like Brian Eddy, the guy that's oh he made the castle and then look what he's made over

[21:30] at Stern.

[21:31] Nothing.

[21:32] There's not even like an interesting mech in any of his games since he's been back in

[21:35] Pinball.

[21:36] And that's why I think all of these guys were propped up.

[21:39] The real gods of Pinball were the engineers at Balli Williams and they all know it.

[21:44] These guys really do know it.

[21:46] Alright everybody, this has been a little Thursday edition of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[21:49] I hope you guys have a great day.

[21:51] We will be back with more episodes and stuff's gonna happen soon.

[21:55] This is just the calm before the storm.

[21:57] But I'm not taking breaks.

[21:59] I'm staying on the air.

[22:00] I'm always gonna give you your money's worth.

[22:02] So thank you so much for being a subscriber and a member of the Canadian Club.

[22:06] Later.
