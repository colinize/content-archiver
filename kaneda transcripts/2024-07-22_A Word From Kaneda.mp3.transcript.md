[00:00] I know I can't be the only one who's holding off a delight.

[00:12] But God knows, I know when it's all said and done.

[00:18] I'm not okay, but it's all gonna be alright.

[00:24] CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA

[00:54] I've been speculating about what's around the corner, wondering if anyone, in modern times, at these prices, can put Bally Williams Magic underneath the glass and how infrequent that really is.

[01:06] And it is surprising, and it keeps this show going on a weekly basis and it's a lot of fun.

[01:12] And I've always tried to make this show the most entertaining pinball podcast on the planet.

[01:17] It's gone through many, many evolutions.

[01:20] There were days when I was cursing with pinside babies.

[01:24] There were days when I was going off on personal attacks against people.

[01:28] We were making fun of Willy Wonka lettering.

[01:31] We were saying Willy Wonka was the greatest game of all time.

[01:34] And then I was telling you not to buy it just a few weeks later.

[01:37] And yet you're all still here.

[01:39] And it's been a real passion of mine.

[01:41] It's been a creative outlet of mine that I've truly enjoyed.

[01:44] It's become maybe like an extra limb.

[01:46] It's just something that allows me this great freedom to talk about such a unique and interesting item in the world.

[01:53] Really, when you think about it, are there many items like this in the world that could keep so many of us captivated

[01:59] for so many years, take so much of our money, take so much of our time away from so many other things.

[02:07] And I think that speaks to the amazing ability of this product.

[02:11] And beyond the product, the most amazing ability of this product is its ability to bring people together from all over the world,

[02:18] from all walks of life, from all financial backgrounds.

[02:22] I can honestly say that this hobby has given me my best friend in life, which is Derek over there in California now.

[02:31] He doesn't make smart decisions.

[02:32] I mean, he's my best friend and he's listened to every single show.

[02:36] He picks up the phone almost every time I call him, almost every day.

[02:40] And even so, he bought a Godfather.

[02:42] And that just goes to show you that even when you're the nicest and the tightest with somebody,

[02:48] you can still make horrible mistakes like buying a Godfather collector's.

[02:52] He didn't even buy a collector's edition.

[02:54] He bought an LE and then he put all this money into the accessories and he ended up losing like $7,000 because he didn't listen to Canada.

[03:01] But everybody, I know there's a lot of people looking at like my Facebook page being down and sort of what's going on.

[03:07] And I've been doing some like lives and I've been saying some stuff and I just want to just sort of nip all the speculation in the butt.

[03:14] I am taking a break for many, many reasons that are personal.

[03:18] I alluded to stuff happening with my new family.

[03:21] And yes, that is why I'm stepping away.

[03:23] I have over prioritized this pinball hobby to the point now where the things that are truly important

[03:30] and the people that truly need me and everything that truly matters.

[03:34] I've put in jeopardy because of my overemphasis and my sort of just like my focus so much on this.

[03:43] And you know, I have been doing a lot of really, really difficult soul searching over the last like 48 hours.

[03:50] And I just realized, you know, I don't want to have to like make these like one or the other decisions.

[03:56] I need to focus on what really matters the most right now.

[04:00] And it doesn't mean that this show is going away.

[04:02] It just means there's going to be a pause.

[04:04] And I think in all of our lives, you know, I say wait and see all the time is my tagline and I need to wait.

[04:10] I need to wait and see, you know, how I can get everything else that is much more of a priority in the right place.

[04:17] Before I have the right mindset to do this show the way I want to do it, because you know me,

[04:22] I never want to do this show and not make it the most entertaining, the most fun,

[04:27] like the greatest place to hang out in all of pinball.

[04:30] And I don't know if I'm ever going to turn the Facebook back on and be honest.

[04:33] I kind of might just do everything here.

[04:35] I know that Patreon is going to start to have a Patreon live.

[04:39] So all of what we love about sort of Saturday morning spectacular is I think are going to carry over here.

[04:45] But I definitely wanted to emphasize for all my fans out there first and foremost, thank you so much for the support.

[04:52] I hope I don't lose your support as I take this break.

[04:55] I know there's a little bit of a monetary thing you guys contribute.

[04:58] And trust me when I say this like now more than ever I could use the support in life.

[05:02] And I hope you don't leave the show.

[05:04] I hope you don't think it's going away.

[05:06] I hope you don't think you haven't gotten your money's worth over the years and over the months and over the weeks that I've been doing this.

[05:12] So I thank you so much.

[05:14] I know that it's a lot for a lot of you.

[05:16] You know, we're all getting hit left and right with inflation and subscribe to every damn channel and all this stuff.

[05:22] And yet you've found room in your world and time in your world to listen to Canadian pinball podcast.

[05:28] So I really do appreciate that because the time you give me is the most valuable thing in the world.

[05:34] I also don't want anyone to think that what I'm doing right now that this step away is somehow like pinball related.

[05:40] No, it's personal and it's family.

[05:42] There's no pinball company that's making me do this.

[05:45] There's no personality.

[05:46] I know that I, yeah, of course I get hit from people every once in a while, but that is not the reason for any of this.

[05:51] So I don't want anyone to go on any stupid witch hunts or sort of try to speculate and go after people.

[05:57] I don't.

[05:58] I want each and every one of you to enjoy the pinball machines you have.

[06:01] I want you to look forward to what all these companies are trying to put into boxes.

[06:06] I want you to start to think a little bit about like how do we really truly celebrate all that we really love about pinball?

[06:12] And I mean this like it's a weird thing to me because like if we really do like distill it down, it's the people and the relationships that matter the most.

[06:21] And that isn't really what's going to help new inbox sales.

[06:25] It's not going to help anything other than maybe like us content creators and the places in the communities you hang out and talk pinball.

[06:32] And that's always going to be the most valuable thing.

[06:35] And I'm never going to let that go.

[06:36] I really do mean this.

[06:38] I mean, I've met some of the greatest people ever.

[06:40] This creative outlet means so much to me and I've been working so hard on it for 10 years.

[06:46] But right now I need to take a pause and I need to really place my energies in the most important places.

[06:53] And when I look at my baby Cassian's eyes and Killian and Brenda and this house and every all my responsibilities, you know,

[07:01] I've really sort of been rocked to the core of who I am as a person, as a man and taking responsibilities for my actions.

[07:11] And I think that is the hardest thing to do.

[07:13] It is really easy to sort of just become a man child and think someone else is just going to handle this and that.

[07:20] And I'm just going to be able to wake up and walk in and do this dream job and have this dream podcast and have this dream wife and have this dream life and have this dream house.

[07:28] And all of it is just going to happen if I just keep doing who I am and not making any changes and not growing up and not taking more responsibility or accountability for who I am.

[07:38] It's not that simple.

[07:40] And we all deal with this on a daily basis.

[07:42] Life is very complex, you know, and we all are struggling.

[07:46] We're all not okay.

[07:47] I mean, it's true.

[07:48] Like we're all going through a lot and we all see like a surface level of who I am on this show.

[07:52] I think I give you more than most, right?

[07:54] I mean, I'm not just this guy who comes out every day and is like, I love everything about pinball.

[07:58] We love pinball.

[07:59] Everything we do is going to be about that.

[08:01] No, it's not about that.

[08:02] It's not about that.

[08:03] I think you get a lot more of the yin and the yang and the full spectrum of what it is.

[08:07] And this is part of it.

[08:08] This goes with the Canadian territory.

[08:10] Like you're getting all of me.

[08:11] So I just want to say to everybody out there, enjoy your summers.

[08:15] I've always said pinball is a winter sport.

[08:18] I don't think there's a lot happening.

[08:19] I think when this show goes back on is when stuff's going to start kicking again in pinball.

[08:23] I mean, I don't think we're going to see much over the next like few weeks.

[08:26] The show will return.

[08:28] I also implore each and every one of you.

[08:30] I know so many of you are going to want to reach out and say, Chris, and I've already had it from a bunch of you.

[08:36] Are you okay?

[08:37] Are you okay?

[08:38] And I just want to say just truthfully, the answer is no, I'm going through a lot.

[08:42] I've got a lot on my plate.

[08:44] I've got a lot I'm dealing with and I know that you care.

[08:47] So just know that like you don't have to reach out.

[08:49] I know you guys all care about my well-being and that is what I'm working on.

[08:54] Everybody thank you.

[08:55] I love you.

[08:56] Thank you for the support and the show will return.

[08:59] You know, and maybe it's good that we just cancel social media out of our lives.

[09:03] I think that is a dumpster fire and we're going to make everything happen here.

[09:07] And for those people that have been on the ride for free for so many years,

[09:11] I don't know what to tell them like you guys are going to get it and it's going to be as good as it's ever been.

[09:16] And I just need to reset and step away and reprioritize all the things that really matter in life.

[09:22] Everybody bless you.

[09:24] I love you and have a great summer and let's enjoy each other way more than we enjoy these pins.

[09:31] I'll be back.

[09:46] I know I can't be the only one who's holding on for dear life.

[09:56] But God knows I know when it's all said and done.

[10:06] I'm not okay but it's all gonna be alright.

[10:16] It's not okay but we're all gonna be alright.

[10:26] Gonna be alright.

[10:32] Gonna be alright.

[10:40] I had no one there.

[10:43] We'll see the other side.

[10:46] The pain a while so way.

[10:49] In a holy water tide.

[10:52] And we all gonna be alright.

[10:56] I know I can't be the only one who's holding on for dear life.

[11:08] But God knows I know when it's all said and done.

[11:14] I'm not okay but it's all gonna be alright.

[11:21] It's not okay but we're all gonna be alright.

[11:27] I'm not okay but it's all gonna be alright.
