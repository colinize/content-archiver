[00:00] I ate it a little chili peppers to wake me up a little bit to get you guys this podcast

[00:23] tonight.

[00:24] I'm sorry it's been delayed.

[00:25] It's been a long, it's not just been a long day.

[00:28] It hasn't been a long weekend.

[00:31] It's been a long five to six months waiting for Magic Girl, the daily ups and downs, the

[00:39] constant roller coaster ride.

[00:41] I know that it's only a fraction of what a lot of you have experienced as you've waited

[00:47] for Magic Girl.

[00:49] What I'm going to do on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast is I'm going to talk about

[00:53] unboxing Magic Girl and my impressions of the machine on day one.

[00:58] Also, realize that I haven't had much time to play the machine.

[01:04] I know a lot of you are waiting for gameplay videos, but I will give you my assessment of

[01:08] where I think the game is at.

[01:10] Gameplay wise.

[01:12] I will talk about the game itself.

[01:15] It is really amazing to have a Magic Girl in your living room right now.

[01:21] I'm looking to my right and I see it there and I almost can't believe it.

[01:26] This thing has been the Moby Dick, the white whale of the entire Pimball industry since 2011.

[01:35] It's out of John Papaduke's hands and it's now in the hands of us.

[01:40] What that means is we now can judge it for what it really is and we don't have to live

[01:46] in some fantasy world anymore.

[01:48] As I look at it right now and as I think about how to talk about it and how to review my

[01:54] experience with this machine, it's almost like trying to review a unicorn.

[01:59] How does someone explain to you the magic of a unicorn?

[02:04] On one level it's just a horse with a single horn on its head, but on another level it's

[02:11] a rare thing that is hardly ever seen.

[02:15] Magic Girl is sort of like that.

[02:17] I really don't know where to start, but let me start with thanking a few people for getting

[02:22] this Magic Girl machine from American Pimball in Chicago all the way to New York City.

[02:29] I want to throw some shout out.

[02:32] I definitely want to thank Chris from CoinTaker for doing the lion's share of the journey.

[02:40] Chris drove the machine from American Pimball.

[02:43] He picked it up.

[02:45] I believe it was Friday and drove it back to Pennsylvania to CoinTaker on Saturday.

[02:52] I want to thank Crazy Levy for recommending a guy named Fast Eddie to go pick up this Pimball

[03:01] machine at CoinTaker today.

[03:04] He got there at 9am and he drove it straight to my apartment.

[03:09] He also wrapped up my tails of the Caribbean nights.

[03:12] He wrapped this thing up like it was King Tut.

[03:15] For those of you in the Northeast who need a guy who is just meticulous at moving Pimball

[03:22] machines, I cannot recommend anyone better than Fast Eddie and I will happily give you his

[03:28] information if you email me at www.cane.com.

[03:33] You probably can hear the strain in my voice.

[03:35] I'm really exhausted today.

[03:37] It's been a long day.

[03:39] I want to thank those people for making it happen.

[03:43] I want to thank Bill Brandness.

[03:45] I want to thank all the other individuals who have sort of been on this journey.

[03:50] I want to thank Kim Mitchell for selling me his spot without Kim doing this deal with

[03:58] me.

[03:59] This never would have happened.

[04:00] I still think Kim made out really well.

[04:03] I'm both happy with our purchases or my purchase of his spot and all that.

[04:10] I think all that is just like bygones by now.

[04:14] I want to thank Pinside for banning me and not letting me share photos and videos with

[04:21] you guys.

[04:22] I did find it funny how Robin had to come out and say that I'm banned for life.

[04:27] That's fine.

[04:28] Robin, you know what?

[04:29] I did send a bunch of jerky emails when I was drunk at times telling you to f off and

[04:35] what not.

[04:36] You know, because I do feel like offended that I'm was banned from the site.

[04:41] But you know what?

[04:42] All that's in the past.

[04:43] I really don't care.

[04:44] I really don't care.

[04:45] Like, let's talk about magic, girl.

[04:47] What it was like unboxing this thing.

[04:49] So it comes in this just like non-descript box.

[04:53] There's nothing on it.

[04:54] It doesn't even say Zed where anywhere.

[04:56] It just says which side is up.

[04:58] We get the thing in and you know, like unboxing a magic girl is not any different than unboxing,

[05:04] a stern or any other pinball machine, right?

[05:06] Like nobody jumps out of the box and gives you like a hand job.

[05:10] There isn't like a rainbow that is circling overhead.

[05:15] It's just a game inside a box.

[05:18] So we get it out.

[05:19] We get it set up.

[05:22] And it wasn't too hard to set up.

[05:24] You just have to put the back box bolts on.

[05:28] It comes inside the box.

[05:30] It comes with two boxes alongside the game itself.

[05:36] And one box has the legs inside it along with the topper.

[05:41] And another box has the bracket for the back box.

[05:44] It has the bolts.

[05:45] It has some extra plastics.

[05:47] Not all the extra.

[05:49] Like there are so many plastics in this game.

[05:51] And they, it's weird.

[05:52] They only give you like a few extra.

[05:54] They're not even, I don't even think they're like replacement plastics for what's in the

[05:58] game.

[05:59] It's, they're the, I don't even, I don't even know.

[06:02] There's, you get documentation on the machines.

[06:06] I did find it interesting that there's nowhere on this machine does it say like magic girl

[06:11] number 16, which is my spot.

[06:13] It doesn't say, you know, 16 of 20 or 16 of 25.

[06:18] There's no certificate.

[06:20] There's nothing.

[06:21] Like, there's nothing signed by John Papaduke on this machine at all.

[06:26] I was kind of disappointed in that.

[06:28] I thought after all this time, John would have had some sort of magical sort of documentation,

[06:36] fancy sort of Willy Wonka kind of certificate that he would proudly sign.

[06:41] And I think that sort of indicates the overall sort of the materials and the, and the supplemental

[06:51] things that come with this machine.

[06:52] You know, I think some of it was just kind of like rushed out last minute.

[06:57] It comes with a magic girl owner's manual, which is about like five or six pages.

[07:04] Let me, let me open it up for you right now.

[07:06] So it's like a vanilla envelope and it says magic girl game manual.

[07:11] Interesting.

[07:12] It says shipping edition.

[07:13] So I don't know what the non shipping edition would be, but I'm opening it up right now.

[07:18] I want to tell you guys like exactly what's inside this.

[07:21] I might have put some extra stuff in here though too.

[07:24] So you got a packing slip from, from that, that has like a check box of stuff.

[07:30] And it says back box, topper box, one topper assembly, three pinballs, one tilt assembly,

[07:37] one line cord, four metal legs, four leg levelers, four leg protectors, eight leg bolts, two

[07:45] back box bolts and washers.

[07:46] Yeah, it's a three pinball game guys.

[07:49] There's only three pinballs I've never, I was kind of laughing when I saw that.

[07:52] I was like, oh, they ran out of money.

[07:53] They couldn't afford the fourth ball for the game.

[07:57] Let's see what else we got.

[07:58] So the goodie bag, it says sling plastics, three inch rubber rings, two flipper rings and

[08:09] miscellaneous parts.

[08:10] Now when I'm looking at my goodie bag now, I'm going to pull it up because I want, again,

[08:15] I want you guys just to get the experience of what it would, what it's like to open up

[08:18] a magic girl.

[08:20] I only have one rubber ring.

[08:24] I just won.

[08:25] I don't know if like that's considered three inch rubber rings, you know, it'd be nice

[08:32] to get more than just one, but I have one.

[08:35] So that's great.

[08:37] I've got that sort of bulls eye thing that says magic spot.

[08:40] It's just a plastic.

[08:41] I don't know where that goes.

[08:43] I think we saw that above the ramp on the left side.

[08:47] I've got some sling shots, sling shot plastics, or two of those.

[08:53] I got a plastic that is just a swirly blue and purple thing.

[08:59] I actually have another one that's green and gray.

[09:03] And then I've got a plastic that is a, it says pin game journal with a cat wearing a

[09:10] wizard hat.

[09:11] This looks like the keychain plaster.

[09:14] Then you also get like inside this box.

[09:16] I've got, it's weird.

[09:18] Guys, it's so weird that there's just two lights.

[09:21] There's two LEDs in here and that's it inside the goody bag.

[09:27] And then I also have the tilt mechanism and the back box bracket.

[09:31] Now I'm not going to put the tilt mechanism into the game.

[09:34] I'll tell you why because no one's going to be coming over and shaking this thing to

[09:37] the point where it's tilting.

[09:38] I'm not going to let that happen.

[09:40] Alright, so also inside the game manual, there's a warranty certificate that looks like

[09:47] it's photocopied and it says limited 90 day warranty, valid in US only.

[09:53] So sorry for you guys who are getting the game overseas.

[09:55] I'm sorry, I know you're in Canada.

[09:58] Zidware warrants to the original consumer purchaser that this pinball machine, not including

[10:04] computer software, shall be free from any defects in material or workmanship under normal

[10:10] home use for a period of 90 days from the date of delivery.

[10:14] And then it just links to the Zidware website.

[10:18] Then there's a really bright orange, read me piece of paper that says, perform overall

[10:24] play field inspection before turning on power switch, remove all packaging material, install

[10:29] three balls, home use only, and then it has the sort of the power out.

[10:35] And then back box important, lift out back glass and install two back box bolts to

[10:41] cabinet to prevent injury, connect all back box cables, then lift back back glass, install

[10:49] ground strap under washer, install back box set on top.

[10:55] Okay, so it's interesting.

[10:56] This is back glass, back glass, back glass because it's, it's, it's that class.

[11:01] It is, it is the magic girl, it's, it's translate is plexi glass.

[11:07] Okay, and I, I think it has to be that because you can't have glass with, with the speakers

[11:11] built into it the way it is.

[11:13] And then there's a magic girl.

[11:15] Uh, let's see, this is the like the owners manual, the home edition manual.

[11:22] And this machine is intended for home use only.

[11:26] So I, it has the magic girl game charts, which has all the different sort of switches

[11:34] and I don't know, I'm not going to go through all this stuff guys, but I'm just saying,

[11:39] um, it's got, yeah, it's very sparring guys.

[11:43] Like this stuff is, there's a little, there's a piece of paper on how to install the

[11:47] topper, which I did.

[11:50] Um, but look, you're not going to get much in terms of documentation, but you guys, you

[11:53] guys are not listening to this podcast to hear about, can you to fucking ramble on about

[11:57] fucking paperwork.

[11:58] So let me talk about my impressions of the game and let's just get right to it.

[12:02] So first of all, the game is gorgeous.

[12:04] Like the artwork is beautiful.

[12:06] I, it looked, it feels like the, the cabinet, our decals, like these like thick sort of decals.

[12:14] Um, I'm not sure, I don't think the artwork is screened onto the wood directly.

[12:20] I don't think that's the case.

[12:22] I might be wrong.

[12:23] I might be wrong, but I, I feel like I can see almost like a thick sort of decal, uh,

[12:30] adhering to the wood.

[12:32] Uh, I have two, there's two buttons for flippers on each side.

[12:37] The one, they don't glow though.

[12:40] I thought the ones that were in front of the red flipper button, the clear ones would

[12:44] glow green, but I don't think they light up.

[12:47] Uh, and then you've got the silver plunger rod.

[12:51] Okay, so I just want to like cut the stuff because I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm tired and then

[12:56] this is not the best like review.

[12:58] I'm sorry guys.

[12:59] I'm just exhausted.

[13:00] I've been waiting all day for this thing.

[13:03] So here's my thing.

[13:04] The, when, when you start to sort of pull off the, the lock down bar, uh, that's right

[13:12] away when you just get this feeling like this machine is, it's, it's like a, a custom

[13:18] like one off machine.

[13:19] It doesn't feel like a, a Williams quality machine when you lift up that lock down bar.

[13:26] Like, it stuff just doesn't really fit like exactly right.

[13:31] I noticed it when I took the, the back glass off or the translate, you know, there's like,

[13:37] it's just almost too tight.

[13:39] It barely fits in there.

[13:40] Um, and then when the lock down bar is like, it's like sticking, uh, and you just get

[13:45] the feeling that John never really like put the game together fully the way a customer

[13:51] would like this thing lived for five years, probably without glass on it.

[13:57] It probably lived five years without ever having legs on it.

[14:01] It was never really, they never really thought about the, the quality and, and the experience

[14:08] of, of taking stuff on and off, like taking the glass on and off the machine frequently.

[14:13] They, it just, it stuff just feels a little bit like, I hate to say, but like flimsy or

[14:20] just like, you just like nervous.

[14:22] And yeah, that's just the feeling.

[14:24] Take off the, the lock down bar.

[14:26] It just, it just, it was like sticking and it wasn't coming up smoothly.

[14:29] Uh, and it just didn't feel, uh, the way like my tails, the Rabie and Nights lock down

[14:34] bar, lock down.

[14:36] The thing that I noticed probably right away was the play field artwork, the quality on

[14:43] it is not top notch.

[14:45] I, I can't, the best way to explain it is it's sort of like pixelated.

[14:51] And I was shocked when I saw that because I've, I've been staring at a, at a CPR gold

[14:56] tails of the Arabian Nights play field for, for many months.

[15:00] And, and that is just gorgeous.

[15:02] Like the blacks are black.

[15:04] Like there's, there's no, this looks like it was like, like printed like onto the wood

[15:11] using like, I don't know like a Photoshop print job on the wood.

[15:15] I don't know how to say it.

[15:16] Like it just doesn't seem like it was silk screened onto the wood properly.

[15:21] And, and, and you guys who are unboxing yours, I'm curious to see like what your quality

[15:27] is.

[15:28] But I, I don't see like, like the fonts on all the different inserts.

[15:33] Like the, it's just, you see that pixelation in the black.

[15:37] And it's not just like a, like a deep black.

[15:40] So it's disappointed to see that this, the artwork wasn't, it, you know, applied to the

[15:46] wood in the best possible way.

[15:48] Now that the cabinet artwork, the lion saw and the, and the translate art, that is just

[15:53] stellar.

[15:54] It looks amazing.

[15:55] And these things look like ride cows or just, they're, they're absolutely gorgeous.

[15:58] But I have to say I'm disappointed in the play field printing quality.

[16:03] It's, it definitely doesn't feel that great.

[16:07] It doesn't look that great.

[16:09] But the art is great.

[16:10] Okay.

[16:11] And so there's that.

[16:13] And then if we look at the inserts in this machine, I know a lot of people were talking

[16:17] about them.

[16:18] I'm actually going to walk over to the machine now.

[16:20] We look at the inserts where it says magic in the middle.

[16:25] Those are no longer clear on mine.

[16:27] They, they are colored blue.

[16:29] And I definitely see like a little ghosting guys.

[16:32] Don't go crazy.

[16:33] A little ghosting on the big G in that insert.

[16:38] And you know, I, I definitely think it looks better versus being clear.

[16:44] But, but that is, that is the case.

[16:47] There is already a little bit of ghosting.

[16:49] But yeah, I mean, I'm just, I'm staring down at the artwork.

[16:53] And again, like it just feels like it's not like, the quality is just not amazing.

[17:03] It just, it just has that like graininess to it that just seems really unfortunate.

[17:08] Now, I think if I look like, like higher up on the play field, some areas are better than

[17:13] others.

[17:14] But again, it just doesn't, it, it, it, it, it deserved better.

[17:19] Um, I'll say that.

[17:20] It's okay.

[17:21] So, I guess, you know, if I go from there, the other thing that just like stood out right

[17:25] away from me, and this is just like annoying.

[17:28] And this just kind of like just shows like the overall attention to detail.

[17:36] There are so many details on this machine.

[17:39] But I looked over and the, my owl, the, you know, that little owl figure that is near

[17:44] like the center spinner.

[17:46] My owl is put on backwards.

[17:49] He's, he's put on incorrectly.

[17:51] He's not looking at me.

[17:53] He's looking to the back of the machine.

[17:54] And I'm just like, I, I really like, they, they just, they couldn't put the owl on correctly.

[18:02] And I know it sounds like a little detail, guys.

[18:06] But as John is inspecting and going over all these machines, I just found it hysterical

[18:13] that, that that was put on incorrectly.

[18:15] It's not like they were making 2,500 of these things.

[18:18] They're only making 25.

[18:21] So really, really confused as to how that happened.

[18:28] What else we got here?

[18:29] I'll read you the magic girl game instruction.

[18:32] So the first bullet is insert coin, press start and wait for the machine to reset.

[18:38] The next is shoot the ball to change the Tesla machine skill shot.

[18:43] The next is all targets collect magic power to light magic letters.

[18:48] Get the ball into the magic shop to light magna save.

[18:53] Collect all bonus levels at the end of each ball played.

[18:57] King and Queen lanes multiply bonus two times three times four times five times.

[19:02] Master of the universe magic to become a morsel.

[19:05] All right.

[19:06] So look, I'm looking down at the machine right now and I have to say like it, it still

[19:09] is gorgeous.

[19:10] Like this thing is a world under glass.

[19:13] Like it is absolutely phenomenal.

[19:17] But you can see though, definitely like John just got carried away with plastics.

[19:22] Like there's just so many pieces of artwork on plastics that really don't do anything.

[19:29] Like the tiger saw doesn't, it's not powered.

[19:31] Like I can't, does it, does it, is it wired?

[19:35] See, I'm trying to see, but it doesn't look like the saw is ever really going to move.

[19:42] It looks like we're the enchanted hairs on the right side.

[19:46] I don't know, there's like a springy thing there, but that's connected to a switch.

[19:51] I don't know what that does.

[19:54] You know, the thing is like nothing, the game is on this novice code.

[19:59] And it's the same code that Bill had when he when Pintasia took the game to shows.

[20:04] And I think that's unfortunate.

[20:06] We keep hearing from Apple juice, right?

[20:08] Is that his name?

[20:10] The coder of this machine that he coded in arcade mode that unlocked so many of the features.

[20:16] And I'm here to tell you, day one when you turn magic girl on, it is in that novice code.

[20:24] And it is not, it is not a game yet.

[20:28] Like it doesn't tell you to do anything.

[20:31] Like there's nothing going on.

[20:35] So yes, I think John locked the code in the most basic form possible.

[20:41] But here's the good news.

[20:42] And I was worried about this.

[20:44] Like when I talked to Chris, a coin taker, he was basically saying how the game doesn't

[20:48] even really plunge well and it doesn't really work.

[20:52] I never had a ball hang up on the plunge.

[20:54] It plunged every time.

[20:56] You just have to pull the plunger back and do it a full plunge to get it into the scoop.

[21:04] For some weird reason, again, these are these little details that just leads me to believe

[21:10] John never played the game.

[21:11] Like they never just stepped back and played it like a normal pinball machine.

[21:17] The shooter lane, if you look at your shooter lane, you know how it has the V sort of like the,

[21:21] it's cut in in the middle to guide the ball.

[21:26] This doesn't have any indent in the play field.

[21:30] It is just flat.

[21:31] The shooter lane is completely flat leading up to the play field.

[21:36] Like there's no indent or groove there.

[21:40] Like that V groove that all shooter lanes have.

[21:42] And that's the part that just like, you see stuff like that and you're like, John,

[21:47] like you're supposed to be this luminary of pinball and you don't even put in like the

[21:53] basic part of a shooter lane.

[21:56] And again, it's like, there's like all these like quirky like head scratching things in

[22:00] this game that make you wonder.

[22:03] I'm trying to think like what else really caught my attention?

[22:08] The ramp.

[22:09] Okay, so everyone's talking about the ramp.

[22:10] Can you hit the ramp?

[22:11] Can you hit the ramp?

[22:12] I'm here to tell you, yes, you can hit the ramp.

[22:15] The ramp is not blocked.

[22:16] I just played a few games.

[22:18] I hit the ramp like four or five times.

[22:20] It's not that difficult of a shot.

[22:22] The entrance to the ramp is pretty big.

[22:26] And the ball goes up the ramp.

[22:27] And it goes two different ways.

[22:29] It either goes up and loops all the way around and goes back down the left or it goes down

[22:37] the right.

[22:38] Now, here's like the biggest head scratcher for me is this big mechanism in the middle.

[22:44] Right?

[22:45] I don't know what this thing does.

[22:47] It's ginormous.

[22:49] It's got three magnets.

[22:51] It looks like it's got a magnet.

[22:54] So it's got that guy's face and it says mystic ring.

[22:57] And clearly the ball can float in the middle of that mystic ring.

[23:01] And it looks like it's going to drop down through this middle hole.

[23:06] And then there's two magnets in front of it that look like they're supposed to be a

[23:10] magnetic flippers.

[23:12] Right?

[23:13] Because it says in this triangle by those two magnets.

[23:17] Use magic flip to feed the power.

[23:21] But none of that works.

[23:22] None of it works.

[23:23] It's wired to work.

[23:24] Those magnets are wired.

[23:27] And it looks like this weird circular, like WWE ring in there where I think you're supposed

[23:34] to move the magnet around.

[23:36] Yeah, because you can see the ball can either go down the middle underneath that guy's head

[23:42] or it can go around the right.

[23:45] Oh, I see.

[23:46] So if you get it up the magic, get up the middle.

[23:50] There's a ramp to the back of that section that feeds it down into this right area where

[24:00] it looks like it's like the mirror, the guy looking into the mirror glass.

[24:06] It's like over the pop bumpers.

[24:09] But man, I don't know.

[24:11] I don't know how the ball gets there.

[24:15] That's the thing.

[24:16] It's like, does this work?

[24:19] If I'm going to ask John one question, besides why the hell did you put my owl on backwards?

[24:26] It's how does this big middle mechanism work?

[24:30] Like it just seems all over the place.

[24:35] Another thing I noticed too, guys, and be very careful when you're working with this machine.

[24:39] You know, because you don't want to break any parts, because we may never get more parts

[24:43] ever again.

[24:44] But I didn't notice that the plastics on them are very, they're very thin.

[24:50] They're very thin.

[24:51] So I just would be very careful about not breaking any of the plastics on this game.

[24:59] What else?

[25:00] Okay.

[25:01] So the game also comes with the side decals.

[25:04] Now let me tell you something.

[25:06] They should have put these side decals on at the factory because these things are such

[25:11] a bitch to put on when you have a game in here.

[25:15] Like Brenda and I spent about an hour and a half frustratingly trying to put them on

[25:21] and line them up perfectly.

[25:22] We got them within like a quarter of an inch of each other.

[25:26] It looks like, but they look great.

[25:28] But man, they were such a bitch to put on.

[25:30] I almost, you know, this game would look awesome with big mirror blades on it.

[25:37] Just know that you're going to be in for a frustrating journey trying to get these side decals

[25:42] on.

[25:43] What else can I tell you guys about this game?

[25:46] So it shoots, guys.

[25:47] It shoots.

[25:48] Like, I did have some issues where there's something buggy in the software where sometimes

[25:55] I'd be playing and the flippers won't stay up.

[25:59] Like it won't let you create a ball.

[26:02] Like every time you hit the flipper button, it like flips and then goes back down.

[26:05] Like it won't let you hold the button down and trap the ball.

[26:09] It's weird.

[26:10] Like it doesn't happen every time.

[26:11] It happens just a few times.

[26:13] I also noticed a little like twitchiness, almost like like an electric surge going to

[26:18] the flipper a few times, not that often.

[26:22] So there's some software bugging this.

[26:24] But again, I think a lot of that is because we're, it's running the software that Pentasia

[26:29] ran a long time ago.

[26:31] Like this isn't the game that Apple juice coated.

[26:35] Like this is the very basic game.

[26:38] For those of you who are worried about the center plastic, like what is this?

[26:42] Like the the jester or the jinks, I don't know, the hell, I don't, you know, there's so

[26:47] much shit here.

[26:48] Don't worry.

[26:50] That thing is way above the ball.

[26:52] The ball cannot hit that.

[26:53] The ball can just hit the spinner.

[26:55] That's above it.

[26:57] There's not really any plastics here that I'd be worried about breaking.

[27:02] I also, you know, I didn't get any air balls at all.

[27:07] So that was good.

[27:09] You know, it just doesn't, there's not a lot of like brick shots.

[27:12] I'll say this to the scoop, really shoots the ball out really fast.

[27:18] I might even like think about lowering it.

[27:20] It was a little, little too fast.

[27:23] There's this weird spinner.

[27:25] Okay, like on the left out lane, there's this black spinner thing, right?

[27:31] I know John was working with this like this magged in, but this looks like this black

[27:35] 3D printed spinner.

[27:38] And I don't know like when this had to activate this thing, but when you do activate it,

[27:45] I think it's the jinks, I don't know what the hex, I don't know, I'm just reading all

[27:49] these.

[27:50] There's like a million words on this play field.

[27:51] No, no, no, what, what's what?

[27:54] And it's cool.

[27:55] Like the ball, when it's activated, the ball does go over it.

[27:58] And sometimes, you know, I noticed the ball, like it just dances back and forth.

[28:01] Like it's deciding if it wants to go into the outlane or go into, into, into return to

[28:07] the flipper.

[28:09] So look, I am, I think that, you know, when we look at the prototype to this game, John

[28:15] had much, he had plans for like magnets over the out lanes.

[28:18] I think he was trying to do like a shooting star type of thing.

[28:21] And I don't think any of that was really integrated into this game.

[28:24] They're interesting thing.

[28:25] I don't have the play field up, but I believe it's under the, on the right side, where it

[28:31] says enchanted hairs.

[28:32] I believe that there's a space cut out underneath the play field for what looks like would be

[28:39] a magnet, but it, but then it, it looks like there's just like a piece of plastic there.

[28:45] There's no magnet there.

[28:46] So I'm not sure if that's an idea that I just sort of got scrapped at the last minute.

[28:51] What else can I tell you?

[28:52] I tell you that the LCD is gorgeous.

[28:55] Yes, the big mechanism does block it a little bit.

[28:58] So it's a little weird, but it also is, it doesn't really bother me, but there's not

[29:05] really any animations.

[29:06] There's nothing really going on.

[29:08] Like you pick your character and then, you know, stuff, stuff is beeping and lights are

[29:16] going, but again, like there's absolutely no code in this thing right now.

[29:21] Like it is pretty much as coldless as a machine can get.

[29:26] I'm trying to think if there's anything else that I missed.

[29:30] There's just, there's so many little details in this game, but again, like the game just

[29:35] doesn't, it's just, it's just not alive.

[29:39] I think that's the best way to put it.

[29:40] The game is, the bones are there.

[29:43] And I think for those people who are worried that the game wasn't even going to shoot, wasn't

[29:47] even going to be flippable.

[29:48] I think you guys can, can, can sleep better tonight.

[29:52] And that was my biggest concern.

[29:53] I just thought like the ball would have hangups and there wouldn't be the ability to

[29:59] even play it.

[30:00] And then that would be super embarrassing.

[30:01] But I'm here to tell you, the game does work.

[30:04] When you first plunge it though, do a full plunge and you'll get it up there.

[30:09] If you try to like do a half plunge, it, it's weird.

[30:12] Like there's like two posts right in front of the shooter lane.

[30:15] And the ball just like will hit them and, and not go anywhere.

[30:19] So it's, it's quite clear that John just never really shot this thing very often.

[30:26] He spent more time tinkering with his mechanisms and he did actually trying to just play the

[30:31] game.

[30:32] I, what I really think John did, and I'm going to get more into this.

[30:36] Like we're going to have many more podcasts talking about Magic Girl.

[30:39] I really think he just, he sort of, he treated this game almost like, like he was designing

[30:45] like a Disneyland theme park.

[30:48] And he had areas of the game that were supposed to represent certain things like here is going

[30:53] to be the tiger, here's going to be the tiger saw or the lion saw and here is going to be

[30:58] the levitating ball and here is going to be the Tesla coil and here's going to be this

[31:02] and any like drew the artwork around these different sort of theme park areas of the

[31:08] play field before even having mechanisms that were designed to bring those themes to

[31:13] life.

[31:14] And he, like everything was backwards, like totally, totally backwards.

[31:18] And, and you can see that when you look at the pin, it's like there's, there's all

[31:22] these descriptors, right?

[31:24] If you, if you read the feature list of what's in Magic Girl, it, it sounds incredible.

[31:29] And then you turn the game on, there's nothing.

[31:32] There's nothing working.

[31:34] The ball doesn't do anything magical yet.

[31:37] It's still the most magical thing is, is when it goes up the ramp, that, that's a satisfying

[31:42] shot.

[31:43] But it's nowhere near as cool as like the ramp shot and, and toad in and what that ball does

[31:48] when you shoot there.

[31:50] So I, I really want answers.

[31:53] I want to know from the code, or from John, like what, what's the deal here?

[31:57] Like, how is this still the code after a year and a half since Pentasia showed the game?

[32:06] How are we still only at this phase with the code?

[32:10] Something is off.

[32:12] The John, like just locked the code as a final F you to all of us and, and ship it the way

[32:17] it is because he doesn't give a shit.

[32:19] You, so another thing I noticed too is I can't even put two players on.

[32:23] So the way the code is now, you can only do one player and you only get two balls.

[32:28] You don't even get three balls.

[32:30] And so it's just this weird sort of, you know, sample run of the game.

[32:37] And I don't know if, like, John wants to just get the games out first and then give

[32:41] everyone a code update.

[32:44] So, so like, that's, that's sort of like my day one assessment of Magic Girl.

[32:50] What else can I tell you about it?

[32:52] The toper is cool.

[32:54] I screwed it into the top.

[32:55] I used some of the screws that came for the latch and the back boxes because they didn't

[33:00] give you any screws for the toper.

[33:01] That was kind of frustrating.

[33:04] It takes four screws.

[33:05] I only put two.

[33:06] It only needs two.

[33:07] It lights up green.

[33:08] It doesn't light up, it doesn't light up like the purple and blue the way the one did

[33:12] at the Pentasia show.

[33:14] But the toper looks really neat.

[33:16] The game looks great.

[33:17] The game looks phenomenal.

[33:20] But I just think that this doesn't even have, like, it doesn't have any code.

[33:26] Like there's no way to say it.

[33:28] Like, imagine your favorite Pimmel machine taking away all the modes, all the objectives,

[33:34] all the, all the reasons why you play it and just have sound effects with a score tiling

[33:40] up.

[33:41] Almost like it's like a juke, like a slot machine just counting up points as you hit stuff.

[33:46] But there's, there's no rhyme or reason to any of it right now.

[33:50] So that's what you're going to experience on day one with Magic Girl is what are my

[33:55] thoughts?

[33:56] I'm just exhausted guys.

[33:58] I really am.

[33:59] Like I wish I had more energy.

[34:02] Do I regret getting this machine?

[34:04] Absolutely not.

[34:05] Absolutely not.

[34:06] I still think it is.

[34:08] It's just amazing feeling to have a Magic Girl Pimmel machine.

[34:12] It's hard to describe.

[34:13] You know, even I was telling a friend, even though this thing doesn't even play as well

[34:18] as just like your average Stern pro right now because there's nothing in it.

[34:23] There's just something still special about flipping Magic Girl.

[34:27] There's just, it's hard.

[34:28] It's like an intangible experience.

[34:30] It's like riding a unicorn versus riding a horse.

[34:33] There's just something about it.

[34:35] And I think the thing too, and this is just so J-pop.

[34:39] Like the fact that all this stuff is wired, but yet nothing is on yet, it either leads

[34:46] me to believe that there's still magic to come.

[34:50] Or John is the biggest fraud ever because he's just through stuff in that he knew didn't

[34:55] work and then walked away without activating any of it.

[34:59] He's going to leave it to someone else to figure out.

[35:02] But I mean, I don't know.

[35:04] I really don't know.

[35:07] So I think this is going to be just the beginning of Magic Girl's sort of story.

[35:14] I mean, it's the end of the Zidware chapter of Waiting for Magic Girl.

[35:20] Now the new story is all going to be about how do we unlock the potential of this game?

[35:26] Is code the issue?

[35:29] Are there mechs that actually work that just aren't turned on right now?

[35:34] Will someone get Apple juice a game to see if he can code it and get it to the point

[35:40] where he says it should be?

[35:42] He says he's done all this work and nobody's experiencing it on day one right now.

[35:49] But will Magik Girl ultimately become?

[35:51] I think it's always going to be a little bit of a boutique handmade custom machine that

[35:59] is a novelty and a rare piece of Pimble history.

[36:04] I think John is done.

[36:06] I don't think you're going to see Roz.

[36:08] I don't think this game is going to be the magical journey people thought.

[36:14] I definitely don't think this game like buys John time.

[36:18] If John shipped the Magic Girl after partnering with American Pimble for a year and it came

[36:25] out and it blew us away, right?

[36:27] If they did all this magical shit and like balls were levitating and magnets were grabbing

[36:32] balls and like the animations were incredible and the sound was spectacular.

[36:37] I think people would be like, oh, we need another one.

[36:42] He was ambitious and it took him a long time but he delivered.

[36:46] What he shipped, what he let go from American Pimble's factory right now with that code

[36:52] is beyond embarrassing to let it go in that condition, like to not turn the stuff on.

[36:59] I think it's kind of pathetic and to see it there but not having it activated is kind

[37:05] of pathetic.

[37:06] He knows exactly what he shipped.

[37:07] There's a reason why those gameplay videos that he uploaded are so spartan and I don't

[37:12] think John ever played the game.

[37:15] The other thing is just like for a $16,000 Pimble machine, lots of questions about the

[37:22] glass.

[37:23] It's just basic glass and let me say this is another thing.

[37:26] Because this glass is on a steeper angle than normal Pimble, the glare is even worse.

[37:33] Not having an Invisi glass or PDI glass with the angle being as steep as it is, the reflection

[37:39] is horrible.

[37:40] It was kind of sad putting the glass on because the bright colors, the vibrancy of the game

[37:47] is completely washed out by the glare that happens with the cheap glass that's in the game.

[37:54] So hopefully someone will make it in Invisi glass or PDI glass that fits Magic Road because

[38:00] we all know it's a little bit longer than normal glass.

[38:04] Yeah, I mean just be careful too when you take your lockdown bar on and off.

[38:10] I was putting it down and you can easily start to scrape away some of your decals on

[38:17] the side if you're not careful.

[38:21] So that's it guys.

[38:24] I uploaded a ton of photos to Facebook.

[38:27] There's going to be more.

[38:28] I want to upload a gameplay video so you guys can see.

[38:31] But the game shoots pretty decent.

[38:33] There is, when we talk about geometry, I forgot to mention this, there is a captive ball

[38:38] that's located to the upper left of that center spinner.

[38:42] You know that center spinner with a jester.

[38:44] There's a captive ball to the upper left.

[38:46] I don't even know how you hit that captive ball.

[38:50] It seems like you would need an upper right flipper to hit it square and without that,

[38:56] it just seems like an impossible shot to hit.

[39:00] So this is day one guys.

[39:01] I think I'm like, I'm exhausted.

[39:02] I'm waiting for this game all day.

[39:05] And his parents were in town, so it's been like a back and forth weekend.

[39:09] But Magic Girl is out.

[39:12] It's in the wild.

[39:13] Canada unboxed his.

[39:14] Canada is going to keep his.

[39:15] He's not flipping it.

[39:17] I'm really interested to see what happens with this game.

[39:22] And look, I'm really interested to see what happens when experience, pinball people lift

[39:27] up the play field and tell us what they see.

[39:31] I have to be honest.

[39:32] I can't recognize whether or not those magnets are hooked up properly and what they would

[39:40] actually do.

[39:41] I'm really a very basic level of understanding of mechanisms when it comes to pinball.

[39:50] But we have to just be excited that Magic Girl is out.

[39:53] It's out of John Papaduke's hands and into the wild.

[39:56] I think this is going to be the end for John Papaduke.

[39:59] I think if you're in on other titles that he owes you, good luck.

[40:03] I wouldn't hold my breath on any of it.

[40:06] And this game, as it is right now, does not, won't make you sort of salveate to see

[40:13] what games two and three are like.

[40:15] He had more than enough time to ship Magic Girl with stuff working.

[40:19] And it really is a head scratcher what the hell the guy's been doing the last year.

[40:23] It's a head scratcher when I see the quality, the artwork on the play field.

[40:28] But again, it feels a lot like Chinese democracy to me.

[40:31] If you listen to Chinese democracy, there's a lot of tracks that are the mixing isn't perfect

[40:39] because it's crazy to say this.

[40:41] But a lot of times, these really long projects that people have spent years on when they

[40:46] go to release them.

[40:48] A lot of corners are cut at the very end.

[40:52] And that is like, I think what we're seeing here is John just had a rush and get these

[40:56] things out.

[40:59] I don't know why my owl is facing backwards.

[41:02] Why?

[41:03] I want it to hold forward.

[41:07] That's it guys.

[41:08] I'm going to bed.

[41:09] If you have any questions, anything you want me to answer, anything you want me to do,

[41:13] feel free to email me at canadapimbalgemail.com.

[41:18] You guys, if you don't know my name, I'm just going to give you my name and go to my Facebook

[41:22] page.

[41:23] There's tons of photos.

[41:24] Add me as a friend.

[41:25] Real name.

[41:26] Can you just real name is Chris, CHRIS.

[41:30] My last name is Cooloris, which is K-O-O-L-U-R-I-S.

[41:36] I think it's pretty well known by everyone on Pinside.

[41:40] Go and see all the photos on my Facebook page.

[41:43] Hit me up there.

[41:45] Thanks, Pinside, for allowing people to share my images and videos that I upload.

[41:51] Even if you guys can't do anything that's promotional and nature.

[41:54] I love how they said that.

[41:55] It's like what they really say is you can't link to his podcast.

[41:59] He doesn't exist in our world.

[42:01] Any mention of him.

[42:02] These guys treat me like I'm mose this and they're ramsy.

[42:06] He shall be stricken from all communication moving forward.

[42:10] Robin, I'm sorry.

[42:12] Get over it.

[42:13] All right.

[42:14] Let's move on.

[42:15] Let's move on to a new chapter.

[42:16] More to come on Magic Girl.

[42:18] I hope that gave you guys a somewhat of a good representation of what it's like opening

[42:23] Magic Girl and experiencing it on day one.

[42:26] I'm exhausted.

[42:27] Give me some credit if I sound tired.

[42:29] I did this for you guys.

[42:30] Have a good night.
