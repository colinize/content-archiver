[00:00] Day for weeks, for months, for years.

[00:02] Let's get everybody in here right now.

[00:04] Let's copy this link.

[00:05] Let's start this right now on Patreon.

[00:09] Opening this up to everybody.

[00:11] You know, it's just one of those days

[00:12] where we shouldn't keep it.

[00:14] We shouldn't keep it too close to the best.

[00:15] We got 738 subscribers.

[00:18] Let's do it live right now.

[00:20] Alice, reveal.

[00:22] Is it a reveal party?

[00:23] Yes, not a launch party.

[00:24] This game's not out yet.

[00:26] Canada.

[00:31] Alice, reveal party.

[00:33] Shoot, shoot.

[00:36] Let's do this.

[00:38] All right.

[00:40] Next, the backstamp is for yesterday.

[00:43] Boom, boom, boom, boom.

[00:45] Publish.

[00:47] And we're in the house.

[00:48] Now look, if you're on Facebook right now,

[00:50] I'm going to send you the link.

[00:53] Because we're not doing this on Facebook.

[00:56] See the link.

[00:57] I'm about to post.

[00:58] Let's do this.

[00:59] Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[01:03] Woo, woo, woo, woo.

[01:06] Oh, I can't wait.

[01:07] We got less than an hour to go.

[01:09] Now you're going to, I'm going to start it just a little

[01:11] bit early.

[01:12] I told Melvin, yeah, I got ease.

[01:14] Yeah, I got to start it a little bit early.

[01:16] You're going to see it like right when it,

[01:18] right before 1 o'clock, we're going to see some Alice's

[01:21] adventures in Wonderland.

[01:24] And I'm going to, I made a great PowerPoint to walk you guys

[01:28] through the asset.

[01:29] So I highly recommend just seeing it like this.

[01:32] And we're going to go through it.

[01:34] And we're going to see all the detail.

[01:35] We're going to see all the magic.

[01:37] I just shared the link.

[01:39] Let me share it on Facebook real quick.

[01:42] And we're going to, I'm going to share screen.

[01:44] So I haven't really done this before because I can't share screen on

[01:46] Facebook.

[01:47] So if you're watching this on Facebook right now,

[01:49] look for the link right now about to be posted on, on Facebook.

[01:54] Go there.

[01:55] And let's hang out for the next hour.

[01:58] So and talk about Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[02:01] I mean, I'm, I'm excited.

[02:02] I really am excited.

[02:03] You can tell I've sort of been hyping this game for a while.

[02:07] But for a reason, for a reason, this is not going to be a flash in

[02:12] the pan title.

[02:13] This is going to be something that I think a lot of people are

[02:16] going to be excited about and not everybody's going to be able to

[02:19] get their hands on, which is actually fun for the first time in a

[02:23] long time.

[02:24] FOMO is back.

[02:25] We're going to talk about that.

[02:27] I'm going to show pictures, Charles, but you got to come over to the

[02:29] YouTube page.

[02:30] You got to come over to the YouTube page.

[02:32] First one out the gate.

[02:34] First reveal party out the gate.

[02:36] Don't try to snake me.

[02:37] Carry.

[02:38] Don't try and do it.

[02:39] Don't try and do it.

[02:40] Here we go.

[02:41] We are live on YouTube right now.

[02:45] Come over and see Alice.

[02:50] Photos right before like seconds of me.

[03:09] All right.

[03:10] There we go.

[03:11] Post it.

[03:12] All right.

[03:13] I'm live.

[03:14] I'm live.

[03:15] All right.

[03:16] You're on your Patreon.

[03:17] Tom is good.

[03:18] Charles.

[03:20] All right.

[03:21] So you guys are there.

[03:22] I'm going to keep this going for a little bit.

[03:24] They're not going to be able to see photos.

[03:25] If you want to watch me here, you can, but you should have it over to

[03:27] YouTube because I'm not going to be paying attention to Facebook.

[03:29] I'm paying attention to YouTube.

[03:30] Guys, what is in the house?

[03:31] We've got more of this.

[03:32] These guys can follow directions.

[03:33] What's up?

[03:34] We've got Mr. Brian Kossner.

[03:36] Oh, guys, let's do a test run right now.

[03:39] You ready?

[03:40] You ready right now?

[03:41] What we're going to do?

[03:42] We're going to do this right now.

[03:43] If you're on Facebook, you're in the wrong place.

[03:45] Get over to YouTube right now for the Elfardi with Canada.

[03:48] We get to see photos.

[03:49] You're going to see photos before anybody else.

[03:52] Just a few seconds before anybody else.

[03:54] Don't worry.

[03:55] If you're reaching out, I'm not going to scoop their launch.

[03:58] But I, I'll organize these photos in a better way than what they're probably going to dump

[04:04] onto Facebook.

[04:05] So you'll see.

[04:06] And I think it's going to be more fun for us to see it this way.

[04:08] So don't cheat.

[04:09] But you're going to get a little bit ahead.

[04:11] A little bit ahead.

[04:13] A little bit ahead of everybody else.

[04:16] So let's do this right now.

[04:17] How's everybody doing?

[04:18] Roy's in the house.

[04:19] We got 44 people in the house.

[04:20] Look, it is, it is new pain revealed day.

[04:23] It is Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[04:25] This has been a game that like we've been waiting for since Zidware showed that cabinet.

[04:32] I want to do a test run right now, gang.

[04:34] Let me know if it's working.

[04:35] If you're on Facebook, you're in the wrong place.

[04:37] Look at the post above this and join that YouTube party.

[04:40] We're all hanging out right now.

[04:42] We've got 52 people.

[04:43] We've got 17 on Facebook.

[04:45] Guys, don't double-screen me.

[04:46] Get over here.

[04:47] Get over here.

[04:48] All right, let me know if you see this.

[04:50] Get ready.

[04:51] I want to make sure I don't make a mistake.

[04:54] But let me know if you see this right now.

[04:57] And I'm going to share it.

[04:59] And I'm going to do side show.

[05:02] So again, can you see right now?

[05:05] Yes or no.

[05:06] A full screen that says ready to see Alice.

[05:11] You let me know.

[05:13] You see it?

[05:14] No.

[05:15] Do you see it now?

[05:17] How about now?

[05:19] How about now?

[05:21] All right.

[05:23] All right.

[05:24] So that's good to know.

[05:26] So you can't now.

[05:31] You can't see it now.

[05:32] Is it all black right now?

[05:34] Let me know.

[05:35] This is what I'm doing the test.

[05:37] Because we're just going to have to go backward.

[05:39] All right, so you can see it.

[05:43] All right, so you can see right now.

[05:49] All right, did you see that little flick?

[05:51] Did you see that little flick?

[05:53] All right.

[05:55] All right, hold on a second.

[05:56] Hold on a second.

[05:57] I'm going to stop screen sharing.

[05:59] Stop screen sharing.

[06:03] All right, so you can see it.

[06:05] I'm going to stop screen sharing.

[06:07] All right, here we're going to do this right now.

[06:10] Do do do.

[06:17] All right, ready.

[06:21] I have two pages here.

[06:24] We're going to test it again.

[06:26] All right, here we go.

[06:28] Ready, ready, ready, ready.

[06:29] People in the house.

[06:30] 92 people.

[06:31] Everyone wants to see Alice.

[06:32] I'm going to do it right before one o'clock.

[06:34] People.

[06:35] All right, so don't, you know, I hope you're hanging out here right

[06:38] before one o'clock.

[06:39] A little bit before one.

[06:42] I'm going to start the PowerPoint and you're going to start to see

[06:45] images.

[06:46] I think you might see them here the first place ever.

[06:49] And you're going to be, I think you're going to be, I think you're

[06:52] really going to be excited.

[06:53] And I'm going to, I'm going to walk you through it.

[06:55] We have a little bit of a lead up to it.

[06:57] But you're going to get to see the pictures you've all been waiting

[07:01] for.

[07:02] What is the hype?

[07:03] What is driving canada?

[07:04] Why is canada doing this?

[07:05] And it's going to be really fun.

[07:07] It's going to be really fun.

[07:08] And so check it out.

[07:09] I want to do another test real quick.

[07:10] What I'm going to do right now.

[07:11] What I'm going to do right now is I'm going to go back to that

[07:15] PowerPoint.

[07:16] And I'm going to flip a page.

[07:17] Now I want you to let me know if you can see both the flips.

[07:21] Because what I'm trying to just figure out is if I can stay on the

[07:25] full screen of the image.

[07:27] While I show you guys the stuff, instead of going back and forth,

[07:30] but I'll probably go back and forth just because it'll be easier.

[07:33] And I can read your chats because here we go.

[07:35] Ready?

[07:36] Share screen.

[07:37] Bum, bum, bum, bum.

[07:41] Do do do do.

[07:43] All right.

[07:45] Patreon.

[07:46] Do slides.

[07:47] All right.

[07:48] Now.

[07:49] I know right now you see ready to see Alice.

[07:50] I'm going to go back there and flip.

[07:52] I'm going to go back there.

[07:53] I know right now you see ready to see Alice.

[07:55] I'm going to go back there and flip.

[07:57] And you let me know if you see the second slide over.

[08:00] Okay.

[08:03] Ready to see Alice.

[08:04] Do you see this right now?

[08:05] And are you seeing me change the slide right now to a slide that says,

[08:10] do you see me turn to page two?

[08:12] I made I dumb this down for you people.

[08:15] I dumbed it down.

[08:16] Did you see it?

[08:17] Okay.

[08:18] Yes.

[08:19] All right.

[08:20] We're good to go.

[08:21] I know we're going to do this.

[08:23] We're going to stop sharing Green.

[08:25] And we're going to go back real quick.

[08:29] Hold on.

[08:30] Did I stop sharing.

[08:32] And yeah, I did.

[08:34] Okay. Great.

[08:35] All right.

[08:36] We're all teed up.

[08:37] All teed up.

[08:38] We don't place to go.

[08:39] As Meatloaf would say, we're going to do share screen.

[08:42] We're going to slide show.

[08:45] Share screen.

[08:48] Presentation.

[08:49] I'll send you guys this link too,

[08:51] so that when we get ready to see Alice,

[08:54] we get ready to see Alice together.

[08:55] Who's ready to see Alice as adventures in Wonderland?

[08:58] I know I am.

[08:59] Now look, if you guys are on YouTube, click on the,

[09:03] if you guys are on Facebook, I see 24 of you.

[09:05] Click the link on the post above and join us in YouTube

[09:12] for the reveal party.

[09:13] You're not gonna snake me, Carrie Hardy.

[09:15] You're not gonna do it.

[09:16] We were here first.

[09:17] I had my party up first.

[09:21] We've got Zambi Yeti's artwork in the background.

[09:24] We're gonna talk about his contribution to this game.

[09:26] And I think he's, again, it goes without saying,

[09:31] there wouldn't be this game if it wasn't for Zambi Yeti.

[09:34] There wouldn't be anything happening

[09:36] around any of these did wear titles.

[09:38] The greatest thing John could ever have,

[09:40] the silver lining and all of his disasters

[09:44] was the fact that he found Zambi Yeti for us.

[09:46] And I think Zambi Yeti's become a member of the society

[09:49] and our community and delivered the greatest pinball art

[09:52] of all time.

[09:53] We're gonna talk more about that in a little bit

[09:54] when we start the PowerPoint.

[09:56] But I definitely wanna say, what up Yeti?

[09:59] We got Dave Howard, you can't comment on YouTube

[10:01] but I can see the video weird.

[10:03] Why can't you comment Dave Login?

[10:05] We'll keep this Facebook thing going.

[10:07] Just for these little, you know, I'm reading Facebook too.

[10:10] So I'll keep it open, but you're not gonna be able

[10:12] to see this, but it's okay.

[10:13] It's okay.

[10:15] How excited are you guys?

[10:16] See, right now, here's what's crazy.

[10:18] Right now, we have already in the house,

[10:22] basically like one, if there's only four,

[10:28] three hundred and eighty games, if each of you bought a game,

[10:31] there'd only be three hundred and eighty games rest

[10:33] for the rest of the world.

[10:35] I think we're at a period now,

[10:37] and I said this on my show today,

[10:38] like FOMO is back with this game and that's fun.

[10:41] And we need to get back to a period of FOMO and TEMPLE.

[10:44] New inbox releases were so much fun because of that.

[10:48] Like you had the FOMO going on with the collectors,

[10:50] you had the operators excited about the pros,

[10:53] and then you had like, you know,

[10:54] the premium guys who wanted the full feature games

[10:57] but don't care about the vanity and all, you know,

[10:59] the less endowed people chasing Elise.

[11:02] So the fact that we're finally back to some sort of FOMO

[11:06] and excitement and I can't wait to see something

[11:08] and I know I know I'm not maybe gonna be able to get it,

[11:12] but I might get locked out of getting the game.

[11:15] I think there's a little bit of fun there.

[11:17] There's zero FOMO for this game.

[11:18] Joe, you're out of your mind, brother.

[11:20] You're gonna see the FOMO for this game

[11:22] when this launch happens in just like 40 minutes.

[11:26] So 40 minutes, order banks open up.

[11:29] Now a lot of you are gonna have to go and get your, like,

[11:33] you know, your email's ready and paid for your deposits

[11:36] because you're not gonna wanna lose out.

[11:38] So I think this is gonna be an instant sell out

[11:42] this week.

[11:43] I think it's gonna sell out today.

[11:45] I think this game is easily sold out

[11:47] before we get to Pimball Expo

[11:49] and I think there really hasn't been a game like this.

[11:52] I've seen come out.

[11:53] I think it's far superior than Raza.

[11:56] I do.

[11:57] I think it looks way better than Raza.

[11:59] It shoots way better than Raza.

[12:01] It doesn't have some stupid Pimball like Raza did.

[12:04] And you know what's silly is that Melvin and the team at Dutch,

[12:08] Melvin made this game in eight months.

[12:11] In eight freaking months, he made this game.

[12:14] And John Papadu could have eight years

[12:16] and couldn't finish this game.

[12:18] Deeper could go through $61 million

[12:20] and couldn't finish this game eight months.

[12:23] And so I'm really excited to see the team over

[12:26] at Dutch Pimball release their soft morric effort in Alice

[12:30] and knowing, you know, they're gonna reveal back

[12:33] to the future at Expo.

[12:35] This company's got the win behind their backs, right?

[12:37] The win behind their sales.

[12:38] Like they've got a lot of momentum

[12:41] and I think it's exciting.

[12:42] Cause I think, you know, we've all been celebrating Spooky.

[12:45] But people want to see Spooky elevate.

[12:47] More attention to detail, right?

[12:49] Better build quality.

[12:51] They want to see more mechs in spooky games.

[12:53] They want to see a little bit more magic.

[12:54] And I think we're gonna get there with Spooky.

[12:56] Stern, it's Stern does what Stern does.

[12:59] Stern is the juggernaut.

[13:00] They make so many games.

[13:02] They destroyed their own Ellie market.

[13:04] Seth Davis made terrible decisions

[13:07] that made every Ellie collector really question

[13:11] why I would give Stern my hard earned money.

[13:13] The fact that they kept remaking Jurassic Park, Elvira,

[13:17] James Bond's 60th for $20,000, all of those moves.

[13:21] Just think about that.

[13:22] There are 500 James Bond's 60th in the world

[13:27] for 20 grand when they came out.

[13:30] There are gonna be 500 Alice's.

[13:31] Now I want you to look at Alice's adventures in Wonderland

[13:34] and tell me you don't see way more game in there

[13:38] than James Bond.

[13:39] And it's gonna cost $7,500 less.

[13:43] And I'm telling you this right now,

[13:45] I think the only direction Alice is gonna go is north.

[13:49] It's gonna head towards 20 grand

[13:51] where look at James Bond, the irony.

[13:53] James Bond headed all the way down to 12.

[13:56] So if you bought a James Bond Ellie 60th, right?

[14:01] On launch day from Stern, your invoice

[14:07] because they charge you tax was around $22,000.

[14:13] So you've lost $10,000 on that game.

[14:18] And I love it.

[14:19] Even when I talk to George,

[14:20] nobody over at Stern, you've been wanting to admit

[14:23] they priced the game that high.

[14:24] Even he was like, oh, we didn't price it.

[14:26] George, he was on your website.

[14:29] It was on Stern's website for $19,999.

[14:34] Look, Hulk fictionally, not only yesterday's news,

[14:37] two years ago, you news.

[14:39] We got 151 people here.

[14:42] Thank you guys for hanging out with Canada.

[14:44] We're gonna show you guys world premiere,

[14:46] Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[14:48] We're gonna be right up on the precipice

[14:51] of Dutch dropping everything on its Facebook page.

[14:54] You're like, we're a small little subsection of the culture.

[14:58] We're not gonna spoil anything.

[14:59] I think I've been doing more marketing for this game

[15:02] than they have.

[15:04] I didn't get paid for any of my efforts.

[15:06] I simply was contacted by Melvin and he's a great guy

[15:10] and we've established a friendship

[15:12] that even I think goes beyond thin ball.

[15:14] Like the way it started was typical

[15:17] Canadian relationships.

[15:19] I think we were like cursing each other out

[15:21] and then we called each other up

[15:23] and now we're like besties.

[15:24] It's great.

[15:25] That's how it always goes with me.

[15:27] I'm gonna acquire taste.

[15:29] After the first few sips, you might not like it

[15:31] but keep going and boy, you're gonna love it.

[15:33] It's like a fine.

[15:35] Anyway guys, we're only 40 minutes away.

[15:39] I can feel the excitement that countdown has begun.

[15:43] And like show of hands gang,

[15:45] like how many of you out there have a collection at home?

[15:49] Right, how many of you out there

[15:51] are just a little bit tired of the same old, right?

[15:54] The beautiful Jersey Jack game

[15:57] that's so stunning to walk up to.

[16:00] And then you play it and it's a little bit soulless

[16:03] and a little bit heartless

[16:04] and it doesn't have the personality, right?

[16:07] It doesn't have the call outs.

[16:08] It doesn't have the synced up video with the voices.

[16:11] All the things you want, it's like, ah, they keep telling us.

[16:15] We've got everything imaginable in this game here.

[16:17] I go, cool, where's the one toy in Avatar?

[16:21] And you just ask that, like where's the one toy in Avatar?

[16:25] And they kind of look at you and they're like,

[16:26] you know, like we, there was no room for it.

[16:28] There was no room for it.

[16:29] And it's like, well, instead of maybe all this lower play field stuff

[16:34] that's not that much fun, maybe, maybe use some of that space

[16:41] for some more engaging stuff.

[16:44] And again, I think the mic is clipping.

[16:49] Is my mic clipping?

[16:52] Is it clipping bad?

[16:54] How am I sounding?

[16:56] Is it me or is it you?

[16:59] Sound spine in my ear.

[17:00] How are we going?

[17:03] It's better?

[17:04] All right, hold on.

[17:11] Is that better?

[17:14] All right, I think I'm just screaming into it.

[17:17] Is that better?

[17:18] Tell me if that's better.

[17:21] All right, good, good, good.

[17:23] All right.

[17:27] Right now it isn't, it isn't.

[17:28] Unplug and replug it in.

[17:32] I think I'm just having bandwidth issues.

[17:37] All right, here we go.

[17:38] Okay, so if you're on Facebook, all right.

[17:42] So look, I think that, you know,

[17:44] Jersey Jack has just put out a gorgeous game.

[17:47] I've played it a lot.

[17:50] I hope the code updated Expo improves.

[17:52] I think that's going to be the big thing with that game.

[17:54] I think they're going to have to show

[17:57] that they've integrated more of the movie scenes

[18:00] and get you going with them.

[18:01] They have to.

[18:04] No clipping is a USB issue.

[18:07] The only solution is to do that.

[18:12] I'm breaking up or I'm breaking the internet.

[18:14] Which one is it?

[18:15] All right, I want to keep going.

[18:16] It sounds okay though, guys,

[18:17] because I want to make sure the sound's good.

[18:18] Because if not, I'll plug it back in.

[18:19] I'll see if I can do something with the sound.

[18:23] But I want to make sure we're good.

[18:24] We've got, we've got a little.

[18:29] Sound is bad.

[18:30] All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.

[18:32] Let me, let me do this.

[18:34] Let me unplug and plug back in and see if that helps.

[18:37] Hold on.

[18:39] I mean, I can just unplug this mic.

[18:41] Is that better?

[18:42] I mean, I don't need the mic.

[18:45] Is that better?

[18:49] I don't even have the mic in.

[18:51] Are you hearing anything?

[18:56] That is better.

[18:57] Let me try the mic again.

[19:08] Oh, Terry's going to get me with his professional sound.

[19:13] Is that better?

[19:14] Did we, you know, let me turn off Facebook.

[19:16] Maybe the Facebook is making a clip.

[19:21] Hold on.

[19:22] Or maybe I'm just trying to think if something's like interfering.

[19:33] It's still bad.

[19:39] It's my bandwidth.

[19:40] Oh.

[19:44] It's my Wi-Fi.

[19:47] Yeah, my Wi-Fi is not the best.

[19:48] Let me, let me try and move.

[19:50] Let me try and move the locations, OK?

[19:52] Hold on.

[19:56] I'm going to take this to the garage,

[19:58] because the garage is where the router is.

[20:02] All right.

[20:06] Because I think, let me know if it gets better.

[20:08] Because I think it just might be, if it's the bandwidth,

[20:12] then I think it's going to be where I'm sitting upstairs.

[20:15] So let me know if it gets better or not

[20:17] when I go to the garage.

[20:20] Is this any better?

[20:21] Still clipping?

[20:23] Let me know.

[20:28] Let me know, Jens.

[20:30] That's sounding like the bandwidth being on my mic.

[20:33] Why is that?

[20:38] All right, let me just, let me take the mic off.

[20:41] Let me just, let me just, let me just, let me take the mic off.

[20:47] Let me, let me take the, let me take the mic off.

[20:53] I want to make sure this sounds good.

[20:54] All right.

[21:00] All right, let's, is that sound better?

[21:12] This is, is it still clipping?

[21:14] Are we good?

[21:16] Let me see my internet.

[21:20] All right, I'm going to keep talking.

[21:22] Are we clipping?

[21:24] This and that.

[21:25] Is it maybe because it's, maybe it's because I'm sharing the screen.

[21:34] It might be the screen, let me stop screen sharing.

[21:42] Oh, man.

[21:44] That's up YouTube.

[21:46] All right, we're going to figure this out.

[21:47] Let me stop, let me stop screen sharing.

[21:51] How about now?

[21:52] Is that better?

[21:53] Because I think it just might be when I'm screen sharing,

[21:57] it's taking up, is it sound better now?

[22:02] Are you on, babe?

[22:04] Now it's okay.

[22:06] All right.

[22:09] All right, so I think it's because the screen sharing,

[22:14] all right.

[22:16] All right, it's, it's, okay.

[22:17] So what we're going to do is this, okay.

[22:19] Thank you, we figured it out.

[22:21] The screen sharing is what's making it clip.

[22:23] So what, what I'm going to do is I'm going to,

[22:29] it's still bad.

[22:31] What?

[22:35] It's back.

[22:39] All right, let me, let me restart this gang.

[22:42] All right, should we do that?

[22:43] Can I do it down here, babe?

[22:44] I think there's something with location.

[22:46] Do you mind doing your call stairs?

[22:58] Do you guys want me to restart the link?

[23:01] Should we, we have 272 people in here?

[23:44] Trying to think, wait.

[23:54] All right, how's that?

[23:58] Well, I haven't said anything yet.

[23:59] Does that sound good?

[24:01] Are we,

[24:04] I know, Brenna's like, what are you doing?

[24:06] What are you doing?

[24:09] All right, well, look, this is the sound today.

[24:11] If it's clippin' my apologies,

[24:13] you didn't come here to hear my voice.

[24:16] Lord knows you hear my voice enough.

[24:18] All right, so we're gonna,

[24:22] we're gonna get,

[24:24] we're gonna get these,

[24:25] these photos out real soon.

[24:26] It's 12.30, all right.

[24:28] We've got,

[24:29] Dutch is gonna drop everything in a half hour.

[24:32] We're gonna go a little bit early.

[24:34] Don't tell Melvin I did this, don't tell Barry I did this,

[24:38] but we're gonna go a little bit early.

[24:41] It's bad again.

[24:42] I don't understand, you know, I can't hear it.

[24:45] I can't hear what you guys are hearing,

[24:46] because it just sounds fine in my ear.

[24:49] Let me try closing some programs down, hold on a second.

[24:52] System references,

[24:53] and let's force quick some stuff.

[24:55] Maybe I'm running out of memory.

[24:57] I don't really have much open.

[25:00] Let's do that.

[25:02] Let's close our density.

[25:05] Okay.

[25:07] It's fine, it's good.

[25:09] Okay, it's get over it.

[25:11] It's gonna go back and forth apparently.

[25:13] All right.

[25:14] So let's do a little poll here, all right.

[25:17] So did you, are you on a, let's see, start a poll.

[25:21] Are you,

[25:24] are you on a list for Alice?

[25:30] I'm curious.

[25:32] Who feels good about getting one today?

[25:34] We've got 170 people here.

[25:40] All right, so Pete Rosen, thank you, Pete.

[25:42] I know, technical difficulties will always haunt me.

[25:46] You know, I'm sure Carrie has a much nicer mic setup

[25:48] than this.

[25:49] So okay, so here's the thing.

[25:51] Here's the thing.

[25:53] Let me, do you guys have any questions about Alice

[25:55] that I can answer right now before you see the game?

[26:02] You're getting one to flip.

[26:04] Ten to flip.

[26:05] You know, there's, there's a lot of people are like,

[26:07] this is just gonna be a game that,

[26:09] can he just gonna buy and he's gonna flip for a profit?

[26:12] That's not, that's not gonna happen.

[26:17] I do think that it makes no sense

[26:20] not to get on a list for this game though.

[26:21] Like, what, cause here's the thing, if you're on the list,

[26:24] all you're gonna get is an email with an opportunity to buy.

[26:28] Why wouldn't you just wanna like have the opportunity?

[26:31] I think a lot of people that are just so used to the last three

[26:34] years where everything is readily available

[26:36] are gonna be significantly disappointed

[26:39] when they realize what true FOMO shut down

[26:41] and shut out of a game feels like.

[26:45] You know, 500 globally, 300 in America.

[26:57] It's intermittent.

[27:00] What's going on guys?

[27:01] You still having sound problems?

[27:02] It's gonna get on with the show.

[27:02] It is what it is.

[27:03] The sound might suck.

[27:04] I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on.

[27:07] What's the link to the wait list?

[27:09] So the wait list, the wait list is at CoinTaker,

[27:14] Great American Pimball, and it's at,

[27:19] it's at Pimball traders.

[27:22] Now interesting, Pimball traders sent around a like,

[27:29] an email like, like a, it was an invoice for no money.

[27:35] It was like an exchange to get on their list.

[27:37] And then they said we're out.

[27:39] And I think they're getting 50,

[27:42] Great American Pimball is getting 50,

[27:44] and CoinTaker is getting 200.

[27:46] That is the shake down I got because they listed

[27:49] how many they had in their allotment

[27:51] over at Pimball traders.

[27:54] Our spots transferable, you know,

[27:57] I think you're gonna be okay transferring spots

[27:59] on this game.

[28:00] Melvin is not gonna be uptight about it.

[28:04] He's not, I think he's gonna be fine with that.

[28:07] Is your FOMO only to flip it?

[28:09] No, as I keep saying,

[28:13] for those of you who know me,

[28:14] I owned an original Magic Girl.

[28:15] I paid $23,000 for it from Mr. Kim Mitchell.

[28:21] I ended up selling it in its broken state for $21,000.

[28:27] But I don't, I wanted it.

[28:29] Like I always wanted,

[28:32] like one of these art piece, J-Pop,

[28:34] weird, whimsical, kind of magical games.

[28:38] And I'm happy to report, I think this is it.

[28:40] I'm just gonna turn some lights on in here

[28:41] because it's hard for me to read, hold on.

[29:00] Light, Z is light.

[29:03] It's also hard for me to read

[29:04] because I'm wearing sunglasses inside.

[29:07] There's that problem I have.

[29:09] All right, I would love to be on the list for the game.

[29:14] It's just priced out of it.

[29:16] Yeah, I mean, look, it's no chump change.

[29:18] Lord Olaf, Mr. Avatar, CE himself is in the house.

[29:24] Congratulations on being here.

[29:28] Congratulations on being able to secure an Avatar CE.

[29:33] I don't think they'll be hard to get.

[29:35] Beautiful machine though.

[29:36] Gang, like absolutely, when you walk up to an Avatar CE

[29:40] and you're gonna see it at Expo, it's absolutely stunning.

[29:45] It's absolutely stunning.

[29:46] I mean, it visually might be one

[29:49] of the most beautiful pinball machines ever.

[29:52] I just don't get the code just doesn't speak to me.

[29:56] I don't walk away from Avatar craving to play it more.

[30:01] It just doesn't pull you in.

[30:03] And again, that's a software thing.

[30:05] I can overlook the lack of toys

[30:07] if the software and the adventure in the game

[30:11] was just more captivating.

[30:13] I think that's the right word.

[30:14] I'm just not captivated because it's all muted.

[30:17] It's like, you know how we feel about it?

[30:19] They gotta like sync up the sound effects

[30:23] and the actors with those scenes in the movie.

[30:25] So we'll see what they drop at Expo.

[30:27] We've got almost 200 people in the house.

[30:29] Gang, we're gonna go a little early.

[30:32] Don't tell Melvin I did this.

[30:34] And we're gonna see, you're gonna see

[30:37] for the first time anywhere in the world.

[30:40] Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[30:41] Let me do the test again.

[30:43] Let's see if this messes up with the speaking

[30:46] but I'm gonna do the test again

[30:48] and I wanna make sure you guys see this.

[30:51] Now, when I go back to the other page,

[30:55] let me know if you see me switch over to the other page.

[30:57] I have it in slideshow.

[31:03] Did you see that?

[31:06] Did you see that switching?

[31:10] Do you see me switching back and forth

[31:11] between the blurry and the non-blurry?

[31:14] Okay, all right, I'm gonna keep it on this.

[31:18] We'll see if it goes scratchier or not.

[31:21] Is this for Patreon only?

[31:23] Hector, I open this up for everybody, Hector.

[31:26] There's no way I could get 200 people on here

[31:29] if it looks for Patreon only.

[31:30] And the reason why is,

[31:32] is this is a favor for Melvin and the team over there.

[31:37] It's a celebration of their game creation.

[31:39] And so I want everybody to come through the door.

[31:41] And look, if you're not a member of the Canadian Club,

[31:43] I also want people to get a little bit of an exposure

[31:46] to Canadian Spinball podcast.

[31:47] I know a lot of terrible things are said about me

[31:50] by some people on Pinside who just can't get over it.

[31:53] Some people refuse to shake my hand

[31:55] when I meet them at pinball companies.

[31:58] But I've been doing this for 11 years.

[32:00] I believe I've been making the most entertaining

[32:02] pinball content there is.

[32:04] Me and Zach Manie, I think are the one, two in that category.

[32:06] I'll put Carrie Hardy in there too and Todd Tucky.

[32:09] You know, there's like a, there's a sub-pernal realm

[32:11] of pinball content creators.

[32:13] And yeah, I do weekly shows and do lives on my club only.

[32:20] So no more Facebook lives.

[32:22] It's all behind the paywall.

[32:24] I do a lot of work.

[32:25] I do a lot of research.

[32:26] It takes a lot of time out of my life away from my family.

[32:29] And so when I ask for $5 a month,

[32:31] I hope people don't see that as an insult.

[32:34] And I think anyone who's a member of the Canadian Club

[32:36] knows you are getting your money's worth

[32:39] when you join up and you listen to this show.

[32:43] I do believe I try to be 100% authentic.

[32:45] I know I went on the hype train for this game.

[32:48] I want to address that because I do think it is important

[32:51] for us to hype and get excited and get that photo train

[32:56] back in the pinball because if we lose photo in pinball,

[32:58] we've lost, I think, half of what makes a new game launch

[33:02] exciting.

[33:03] It is because it's exciting to watch

[33:06] that people on the photo train,

[33:08] it's exciting to capture their excitement.

[33:10] It's also exciting to speculate whether or not

[33:13] we think those people got on the right train.

[33:16] Remember when people went to Stern

[33:18] because they were invited and Stern put them

[33:20] on the photo train around John Wick, LE.

[33:23] Remember those people and some of them bought John Wick, LE's.

[33:27] Remember those people who just lost $4,000 to $5,000

[33:30] now because nobody wants a John Wick, LE.

[33:32] So it's fun to watch and be like,

[33:34] ha ha ha, like you got on the wrong train.

[33:37] And look, in previous years,

[33:42] I got a photo train going around Willy Wonka.

[33:46] And it was bad for me.

[33:48] It was bad.

[33:49] I was talking about it.

[33:50] It was the second coming of pinball.

[33:53] And a lot of people believed in my excitement.

[33:55] And then the game never delivered.

[33:58] And the CES sat unsolved for like a year or two years.

[34:03] And to my defense,

[34:07] I was excited because I got to see the game

[34:09] before everybody else.

[34:10] But it was more that Jack did tell me

[34:12] that all the assets were going to be in the game.

[34:15] And none of them were.

[34:16] So I felt a little bit like Miss Lead

[34:19] on what was going to be in the game.

[34:20] I'm always unsure what Jersey Jack means when they said,

[34:24] when they say stuff like, we have all the assets you want.

[34:28] And even when you look at the Avatar video people,

[34:30] they say in that Avatar launch video

[34:33] that we've synced up everything you want.

[34:36] But they haven't.

[34:38] So I was like, why do they keep saying that?

[34:40] Just stop saying that.

[34:42] And then I won't complain about it.

[34:44] No, John Wick is, I mean, even George Gomez regrets John Wick.

[34:48] All right, we're at 1241.

[34:50] We're going to go at like 1255-ish, all right?

[34:55] People, we're going to go at like 1255-ish.

[34:57] We're going to start going through my deck.

[34:59] I'm going to be looking at the clock.

[35:00] But I guarantee you, you're going to start

[35:02] to see Alice's adventures in Wonderland just a little bit

[35:06] before everybody else.

[35:07] We've got a very captive audience here.

[35:09] I think you're really going to enjoy the PowerPoint slideshow.

[35:12] I put together.

[35:13] It took me about an hour to do this.

[35:16] Again, I'm not paid by Dutch Pimble X.

[35:19] I am not sponsored by them.

[35:21] I don't have any special arrangement with them.

[35:24] Melvin simply reached out to me and Kerry.

[35:27] We signed NDAs.

[35:28] And I'll say this, we barely got anything.

[35:32] We barely got anything.

[35:33] And if you were on my chat last night,

[35:35] I was given out to Kerry because when

[35:37] he did the promo for his reveal party that he's doing right now,

[35:43] can someone go over there and tell me how many people he has?

[35:46] I'm curious how many he's got.

[35:47] We've got 189, which is not bad.

[35:48] He's got a much bigger face or YouTube audience than I do.

[35:52] So I'm sure he's probably right around here as well.

[35:55] I love Kerry, by the way.

[35:56] He just made a bone-headed mistake.

[35:57] We weren't supposed to use any of the assets.

[35:59] Any used assets.

[36:00] You know, that's great.

[36:01] No, it's awesome.

[36:02] I mean, look, Kerry's got like 5,000 YouTube subscribers.

[36:06] So I think that is awesome.

[36:07] We both got some good audiences going right now.

[36:11] He used an image that we weren't supposed to use yet.

[36:14] And it didn't look right.

[36:15] Because it was like thumbnail, then the colors were off.

[36:18] And then I knew what would happen.

[36:20] It's like people were going to start deconstructing the colors.

[36:25] And saying, oh, it's not good.

[36:26] It's not this.

[36:27] It's not that.

[36:29] Well, here's what's funny.

[36:30] Between my 194 and Kerry's 291, you know what that is?

[36:36] People, it's like the exact amount of games being made.

[36:39] If everybody who's watching Kerry and me right now

[36:44] wants an Alice, they're sold out around the world forever.

[36:47] And I also heard from Melvin that they're never ever

[36:54] making anymore.

[36:55] There will never be other additions.

[37:00] This is it.

[37:01] You're not going to buy this game,

[37:03] and they're going to see the overwhelming demand and make more.

[37:07] It's just never happening.

[37:10] So I think some people have that concern.

[37:14] You should have that concern because you

[37:16] saw Jersey Jack make more Wizard of Oz machines.

[37:20] And Stern's been doing nothing but screwing over the people.

[37:24] So yeah, Kerry's got 10,000 subscribers.

[37:26] That's right.

[37:27] He just crossed the 10,000 mark.

[37:28] That's awesome.

[37:29] Kerry's the YouTube guy.

[37:31] Like YouTube is not my thing.

[37:33] I use this only when I do lives periodically.

[37:37] My thing is podcasting.

[37:39] That's my lane.

[37:41] And then Facebook lives basically because they were live and phone

[37:45] and unedited.

[37:46] But I just have to pick and choose where I want to apply my efforts.

[37:51] And we've got just a little over 10 minutes,

[37:56] and we're going to start seeing out.

[37:57] So you guys ready?

[38:00] You guys want to see just a little bit?

[38:02] Should we give you just a little bit?

[38:04] All right.

[38:04] So I've got this blurry image.

[38:06] I just want to show you, like, if you see Kerry's thumbnail,

[38:10] if you see Kerry's thumbnail, I'm going

[38:11] to give you just a little bit, just so you can see, like,

[38:14] we're going with the colors in this game.

[38:17] And you can see, like, the colors are not nearly as muted

[38:22] as they were in that teaser.

[38:24] But we're going to see, you know, in it, you know,

[38:28] I think a really hard achievement is to take zombie Eddie

[38:32] artwork and to make it into something that he didn't touch

[38:37] or colorize.

[38:38] And would he have colorized this differently?

[38:41] Absolutely.

[38:42] Are we ever going to get that game never?

[38:45] So I think you could look at it and wish for something

[38:48] different.

[38:49] I think you're going to look at it and think it's awesome.

[38:51] And I think it's just that.

[38:53] And I think this game not exists if it were not for him.

[38:57] We're going to get going in a little bit.

[38:58] Five, give me five minutes.

[38:59] We can't jump the gun too much.

[39:02] There's an embargo.

[39:04] And I do respect that stuff.

[39:06] But I want to give all of you guys who are here, 224 people.

[39:12] It's funny.

[39:12] It's like, what's he showing over there?

[39:14] Is he jumping the gun?

[39:15] And like, this is not a competition.

[39:18] This is not a competition.

[39:22] It's like it's really going to be, I'm curious,

[39:26] because I want to go back and forth between the Google

[39:32] Doc and here, because I want to hear your comments.

[39:36] It's going to be good.

[39:37] It's going to be good.

[39:39] I think today could turn into a little bit of an SHIT show.

[39:46] And I do mean that.

[39:48] I think what could happen is that coin taker and dutch

[39:54] sent out that email that I would not have sent out.

[39:58] That was like, if you're an EA and you still own your labowski,

[40:04] you can have an Alice.

[40:05] Like you can get first dibs at one.

[40:08] I don't like, Barry, like what are you thinking?

[40:10] I told this to Melvin, like common sense guys,

[40:13] like how are you going to now manage that portion of it?

[40:17] Because I think there's like 180 EA's.

[40:21] And even if just a third of them, one in L,

[40:25] is how are you going to figure out now how

[40:29] to hold those 60 games back?

[40:31] Because the order banks are opening up in 15 minutes right now.

[40:35] And those people have to verify they still

[40:38] own a labowski by holding up a newspaper.

[40:40] It's like, what?

[40:42] Just sell the game.

[40:44] And I know they're trying to be loyal and show some loyalty

[40:50] and give some rewards to the early achievers.

[40:53] But man, I just think that could make it a little bit hard

[40:59] for all the distributors to know their allotment when

[41:03] you only have 500.

[41:04] Because I think, again, I think the distros

[41:07] are going to sell out pretty instantly.

[41:10] All right.

[41:11] So let's start this PowerPoint again.

[41:14] Because we're going to get into it.

[41:15] I'm going to have things to stay on each slide.

[41:18] So we all know that games started as a dream of J-pop's

[41:23] more like a Ponzi scheme item to try and lure more people in

[41:29] to save his bankrupt but because he had gone well overboard

[41:34] on the magic girl financials and on the raza deposit.

[41:37] So he had this phone court of Alice's Alice in Wonderland

[41:42] in typical J-pop fashion.

[41:44] He didn't check on Disney with the IP.

[41:47] That's why this game is called Alice's Adventures

[41:50] in Wonderland is because Melvin just

[41:54] wanted to avoid putting all the work in

[41:57] and then Disney, who's very litigious,

[42:00] maybe tries to put a stop to the game.

[42:02] And I think it was a smart move.

[42:04] I think it was a smart move because especially

[42:06] with like an adult version of Alice in Wonderland,

[42:09] you just don't want to run into problems.

[42:12] So he did the smart move.

[42:13] Now what do you see here?

[42:16] I want you to see this.

[42:17] What you see here was nothing more than phone

[42:20] core with some thought starters and Zambiati artwork.

[42:26] And it's obviously the Zambiati artwork,

[42:28] the super deep zidware cabinet that never really worked.

[42:32] And Melvin took this.

[42:36] It's just literally these two guys, Melvin and his team

[42:41] took that phone core and were able to make something

[42:47] that you're going to see today.

[42:49] A fully working, fully functioning,

[42:52] fully operational, pinball machine based on something

[42:57] that if John had a decade, he wouldn't be able

[43:01] to finish the game.

[43:03] And Melvin did it in eight months.

[43:05] We've been talking a lot about Jack Danger doing X-Men

[43:09] in a 12 month production cycle.

[43:13] I think these two guys, Melvin and Barry combined,

[43:16] I think you're looking at two very, very talented,

[43:20] Kimball luminaries who are really going

[43:23] to be household names over the next five years.

[43:26] And I think you're going to see them not just in this project.

[43:29] I think you're going to see them in back to the future.

[43:32] And I think there's going to be a big future for this company

[43:35] even after that.

[43:37] Because I think they're just going to put products

[43:38] into the world that are unlike everyone else's product,

[43:43] but also deliver.

[43:44] I think they have a good understanding

[43:46] of what made us love Valley Williams games so much,

[43:50] but also in a modern way.

[43:52] And I know the Lebowski manufacturing debacle was a disaster.

[43:58] But you got to remember the context of when Barry rocked

[44:03] into, I think it was Pinball Expo with that game,

[44:07] how he showed up the entire industry.

[44:12] Now, obviously, we know all the other negative sides

[44:15] of the contract manufacturing and people being like Lied To

[44:20] and not getting their money and all that stuff.

[44:23] But I'm happy to report as of today,

[44:26] this company is 100% fine.

[44:31] They're doing great.

[44:32] They have all the EAs have their games.

[44:34] They owe nobody anything.

[44:36] They're in the green.

[44:37] And they're looking at the future with a lot of optimism.

[44:42] And they've built a really, eat off the ground,

[44:45] super clean factory.

[44:47] And they're going to make more Lebowski's production on Alice

[44:52] will start sometime in January.

[44:55] And they're looking on a good week.

[44:57] They're putting out around 10 machines a week.

[45:00] That is like how the factory operates at its capacity.

[45:05] So you take 500 games 52 weeks.

[45:09] It's kind of like everyone's going to get their game in 2025.

[45:13] It's going to be the promise you get from them today.

[45:17] They are going to make an announcement that all deposits

[45:21] will be refunded if you do not get a game in 2025.

[45:27] So that is interesting.

[45:28] All right, we're going to show this baby.

[45:29] And just a little bit in there.

[45:32] I wanted to include this in today's discussion

[45:35] as we talk about Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[45:40] I don't even know where to start with this.

[45:42] There wouldn't even be a game without Jeremy Packer.

[45:47] This man, the amount of work and the amount of effort

[45:52] he put into John's projects at Zidware.

[45:58] And it just was backbreaking.

[46:00] And I know it was really depressing for him

[46:04] to put all this effort into a company that

[46:07] turned out to be a mad scientist Ponzi's game.

[46:10] And people lost all this money.

[46:12] And his artwork never saw the light of day.

[46:15] Now I know this is not the way he wanted to see his artwork

[46:21] on a game he probably would have loved

[46:23] to have had it all work out.

[46:25] His artwork was not stolen from him.

[46:28] I want to clarify some things.

[46:29] As zombie Eddie, Jeremy, he was paid by John.

[46:33] He was paid by Billet, Pantasia.

[46:36] And he's been compensated for the work

[46:38] he did on this stuff.

[46:40] So he wasn't stolen from him.

[46:43] Melvin didn't steal his laptop and download all the files.

[46:48] OK, so I think you got to be careful in the words you use here.

[46:53] And we're not in a negative space here.

[46:54] We're in a positive space about this man.

[46:58] And what you're about to see is all

[47:00] because of the foundation he laid for this game.

[47:03] And everything you're about to see

[47:05] is building on his foundation.

[47:07] And the only good thing John ever did

[47:11] was that he Googled one day, zombie artists,

[47:14] because he had retroatomic zombie adventure land.

[47:17] For you newbies, that's how he discovered Jeremy.

[47:20] He was just looking for a zombie artist.

[47:23] And he found this guy.

[47:25] And history will always be kind to Jeremy,

[47:30] because he's historically maybe the best

[47:32] pinball artist ever.

[47:34] And his games are phenomenal.

[47:35] And I just wanted to say that that even though he's not a DPX

[47:38] and he has a lustrous career at Stern, this man,

[47:43] it's always hats off to him.

[47:46] Even though I'm not taking my hat off right now,

[47:48] Jeremy, because I've got my headphones on and everything.

[47:50] All right.

[47:51] All right, we got a few minutes people.

[47:53] I told him, I'm going to go just a few minutes early.

[47:55] And we're going to start to see the game.

[47:58] How many people have we got in there?

[47:59] 2.30?

[48:00] Yeah, we can't catch him.

[48:01] We can't catch him.

[48:02] I love it.

[48:03] It's carry-showing stuff already.

[48:04] Come on.

[48:06] All right.

[48:06] All right.

[48:07] Let me give you a minute.

[48:08] Give me a minute.

[48:08] Give me a minute.

[48:09] Give me a minute.

[48:10] Give me a minute.

[48:11] Give me a minute.

[48:12] All right, we're going to go to the next slide.

[48:14] All right.

[48:15] A couple of minutes.

[48:16] Give me a minute.

[48:16] Give me a minute.

[48:18] All right.

[48:18] We're getting close, people.

[48:20] I feel it.

[48:20] Love is in the air.

[48:22] Just a couple minutes.

[48:23] A couple minutes.

[48:24] And they just go look a few minutes early.

[48:27] You're going to see it.

[48:28] I mean, come on.

[48:28] This is how we should do it.

[48:29] This is how companies should do it.

[48:31] They should build it up like this on one person's laptop.

[48:35] Not like cell phone screenshots to Joe Abadi.

[48:40] Bill Brands is like, just show me, man.

[48:41] I won't show anybody.

[48:42] I'm like, Bill, the moment I give you an image,

[48:45] Joe Abadi's got it in like three seconds.

[48:48] I feel like you guys share a cell phone.

[48:50] I'm not giving you an image.

[48:52] And I'm proud to say I did not leak anything.

[48:56] Everything that you're about to see has been kept quiet.

[49:02] All right.

[49:03] Bill, this is not.

[49:03] All right.

[49:04] Are you guys ready?

[49:05] Are you ready?

[49:06] Are you ready to see Alice's adventures in Wonderland

[49:11] by DPX and Melvin?

[49:14] And let's talk about it.

[49:15] I'm going to go through each of these images

[49:17] and we're going to get to talk about it.

[49:18] All right.

[49:20] All right.

[49:20] We'll just a little minute.

[49:22] I'm just like going a little slower.

[49:25] I don't want, and gang, do me a favor.

[49:28] Do not, do not like get me in trouble.

[49:32] And I know asking this is going to make you do this.

[49:34] So it's like, I know the internet and I know people.

[49:38] It's like, do not take these in the next two minutes

[49:41] and screen grab them because high res images of all this

[49:45] is about to drop in, I'm going to go at 12.56.

[49:48] All right.

[49:48] I'm going to go at 12.56.

[49:50] High res images of all this stuff is going to be out there.

[49:54] So just let that be the shareable images and we're off.

[50:00] All right.

[50:01] Are you ready, Brenda?

[50:03] Boom.

[50:05] Alice's adventure in Wonderland.

[50:08] I like almost like want to just let you guys see stuff

[50:15] and not talk it.

[50:17] So here is our cabinet.

[50:21] And it looks like it looks a little on.

[50:26] I'm like, I'm like, how does it look?

[50:29] It looks a little, it doesn't look as colorful as,

[50:32] let me see, on my PowerPoint, hold on, hold on a second.

[50:37] I think it looks great.

[50:38] I'm just trying to make sure the colors are popping

[50:39] on the Google Doc.

[50:40] Hold on.

[50:41] One second.

[50:47] What's up?

[50:48] Maybe take your glasses off.

[50:50] Is it my glasses?

[50:52] No, hold on, hold on, hold on.

[50:57] Let's see.

[50:58] Open.

[50:59] I'm going to go here.

[51:06] Yeah, look.

[51:16] It might be more red on your guys.

[51:17] It just might be the way it's coming through on my, all right.

[51:19] Let's keep it up.

[51:20] All right.

[51:21] So we got that we've, as you can see, we've got the cabinet artwork

[51:28] on both sides.

[51:29] It's reversed.

[51:30] And there's reversal of the Cheshire cat.

[51:34] I mean, I love this cabinet.

[51:35] I hope the colors are popping like it pops on my computer.

[51:41] But this, this to me is stunning.

[51:44] And I love it.

[51:45] And I love how they've gone even more.

[51:48] I'm going to get to the Playfield gang.

[51:49] There's a journey here.

[51:50] Relax, all right.

[51:52] Relax.

[51:53] All right.

[51:54] So there's having it.

[51:55] I got a, I got a feisty bunch.

[51:57] But if you can zoom in here and, and I hope these colors are popping

[52:00] because they're very muted on my Google doc, which I think it just might be

[52:04] in my computer's coloring is gang for you.

[52:06] Is that red or red, red?

[52:07] Just let me know.

[52:08] Is there a bright, red?

[52:11] I just want to know.

[52:13] I'm very showing the play field.

[52:18] All right.

[52:18] All right.

[52:19] Here we go.

[52:20] We'll get to the Playfield.

[52:21] There you go.

[52:22] There's your back box.

[52:24] We're going to go through it all.

[52:26] There's your Translight.

[52:29] OK, with your Sirecat on top.

[52:32] All right.

[52:33] All right.

[52:34] I'm going to click through.

[52:36] So you guys can see the details.

[52:37] I want to talk about all this.

[52:38] But we got your sword shooter rod.

[52:42] You get your powder coated corner.

[52:43] OK, there's the Playfield.

[52:45] You got the Playfield.

[52:47] You got the Playfield.

[52:49] The powder color is bright red on mine.

[52:53] It's coming through darker on here for some reason.

[52:56] It's not maroon brown and tone at all.

[52:58] It's not.

[52:59] Like, I don't know what happened with these photos.

[53:04] I'm sorry, guys.

[53:05] I think the photos, like our darker when I uploaded them

[53:08] from PowerPoint to Google Doc.

[53:13] Let me see if I can share.

[53:14] I'm going to show you guys on this first and then back.

[53:16] But you can see as we move up the Playfield,

[53:24] you see you've got the Outlane saves.

[53:27] You've got these beautifully yours scopes.

[53:30] You've got a magnet under here, under that flamingo on the left eye

[53:34] that you can't see.

[53:37] You've got the Cheshire Cat scoop.

[53:40] That's a scoop there that's going to fire the ball back.

[53:43] You Cheshire Cat, Brenda says.

[53:45] You've got the clock.

[53:47] We've got this huge upper Playfield.

[53:50] I'm just going to flip through photos, guys,

[53:52] because the photos are out now.

[53:53] And then we can go back and talk the magnet flip.

[53:59] You've got the mirrored.

[54:00] This is what I was talking about, the mirrored side art.

[54:02] So it's mirrored.

[54:03] And then the art is over it.

[54:06] OK, so this is a good photo.

[54:07] You start to see some of the depth.

[54:09] I think all the colors, I don't know.

[54:11] I think they just get a little washed out on PowerPoint.

[54:13] But you're going to see the high res ones.

[54:16] This is really cool, the way the clock.

[54:18] It's digital, but it can show like it's

[54:20] been cracked, the glass.

[54:21] I love these kinds of attention to details.

[54:25] Real lights, right?

[54:26] Sculpted street lamps.

[54:30] There's our Jabber walk, right?

[54:32] Jabber walkie.

[54:34] He moves.

[54:34] His arm goes up and down when he battle him.

[54:41] A little bit more of an image there of the,

[54:43] so you can see the ramp to the left.

[54:46] See that ramp going up, then you've got.

[54:48] And I can't wait to see some gameplay footage.

[54:51] But I wanted to just give you some images of what

[54:54] you're going to see in the game.

[55:02] This is a really cool magnet flip.

[55:03] So you move the ball around and you

[55:05] hit the targets as the ball loops around with the magnet

[55:08] and goes into like that little kick out

[55:11] and the upper right.

[55:20] I know I'm going fast.

[55:21] So it's going to have, if you look at the upper left here,

[55:23] a mirror.

[55:25] So you're going to be able to see the ball,

[55:27] like kind of like theater of magic,

[55:28] what's happening back there with that mirror.

[55:32] So I think it's a throwback, the theater of magic.

[55:34] You're also going to see the balls lock

[55:36] underneath the play field.

[55:37] I'll have Avatar has that, right?

[55:39] Elton John Piano.

[55:41] So that's another really cool feature.

[55:45] Yeah, I mean, I want to go back and go through it.

[55:48] But I think that I want to try and open up.

[55:52] I'm going to stop screen sharing.

[55:54] I want to go back and open up.

[55:57] I don't like plastic ramps.

[55:59] Pastic ramps, Olaf, are more expensive than wire forms.

[56:02] So you don't know what you're talking about.

[56:12] Hold on.

[56:12] Let me go through.

[56:18] I'll keep it here.

[56:20] I'll keep it here.

[56:21] I'm just curious what you guys think.

[56:23] Wait, you guys, you don't like it?

[56:25] A bad joke.

[56:31] Wow.

[56:31] Tough critics.

[56:33] Is this a world under glass?

[56:38] OK.

[56:38] No, the guy is like, I think this is a beautiful game.

[56:45] And I'm not sure.

[56:47] If you don't think this looks like going into Alice

[56:51] and Wonderland with the different areas and territories

[56:55] and Queen of Hearts upper play field and the Jabber Walk,

[56:59] and I don't know.

[57:02] I don't know.

[57:04] I don't know what to tell the critics.

[57:06] Other than this looks like a damn fun Pimble machine.

[57:11] And I also think when you look

[57:16] at, and for people that say, I don't like the plastic ramps.

[57:19] And plastic ramps, if you ever played on them,

[57:21] there's a reason why they don't have them in those games,

[57:24] is that it's not because they break.

[57:26] They're just much more expensive to mold these plastic ramps

[57:30] than it is to do wire forms.

[57:32] And they look so nice.

[57:34] And so again, seeing this game, all it up,

[57:38] I think it's going to be great.

[57:40] Do I expect to win each of you over?

[57:44] No, I mean, I absolutely do not.

[57:47] I'm just not sure why the colors on my computer,

[57:50] hold on, I'm going to stop screen sharing,

[57:52] pull up my PowerPoint here.

[57:55] So I want you to see, I'm going to do this.

[58:03] Let me see if I can screen share.

[58:11] All right, do that.

[58:12] Wow, it's going to go crazy.

[58:14] Let's look at this now.

[58:16] Can you guys see this or just me?

[58:22] Oh, I think it's just on the monitor.

[58:27] All right, let's hear what you want me to do.

[58:29] Let's do this.

[58:32] I'm going to pull up the Facebook page for Dutch

[58:38] and this will work.

[58:44] You know, I can tell, I can tell just like

[58:47] why these pinball companies, you know, it's like,

[58:51] man, everybody, everybody is like,

[58:55] it's hard to please people.

[58:56] I actually love it.

[58:58] I actually love it.

[58:59] I mean, maybe I'm looking for the good in it

[59:01] and people are looking for the bad,

[59:03] but I think it's a gorgeous game.

[59:06] Let me pull up Dutch pinball X.

[59:08] Let's see the game.

[59:11] They have to have it up by now.

[59:13] Now there we go.

[59:15] Yeah.

[59:16] All right, let's screen share here.

[59:24] Screen share.

[59:32] Let's see.

[59:36] Can you go, let me know if you can see

[59:38] when I go over.

[59:43] Let me know when I go over to Facebook,

[59:45] if you can see this.

[59:46] I don't see this.

[59:48] You know, YouTube, really finicky.

[59:51] I got it.

[59:54] Here we go.

[59:55] Okay.

[59:58] Okay, all right.

[59:59] Now I know you can see this, right?

[01:00:00] Okay, you see the colors here?

[01:00:02] You see that these colors,

[01:00:05] I, these are coming through better, right?

[01:00:07] I didn't, was on my Google Doc.

[01:00:13] So let's go here.

[01:00:16] I mean, come on,

[01:00:18] you tell me your wife's not going to let.

[01:00:21] Yeah, okay.

[01:00:22] I'm sorry, I don't know why the colors got washed out

[01:00:24] when I uploaded it.

[01:00:25] So let's go through so you can see.

[01:00:30] I mean, this is stunning.

[01:00:32] This is a stunning cabinet.

[01:00:35] Absolutely stunning.

[01:00:39] Like, you're not going to get,

[01:00:42] you're going to tell me

[01:00:45] that this is not beautiful amateur.

[01:00:50] Look at these, I mean, you do know that a lot,

[01:00:53] like I, like some of you guys,

[01:00:56] like, this is an amateur.

[01:00:59] Okay.

[01:01:02] All right, here we go.

[01:01:06] Get to the play field.

[01:01:10] I know.

[01:01:18] All right, so you can see the colors are more,

[01:01:21] it's, you know, it's hard, it's hard to,

[01:01:28] I'm just going to slowly scroll up this.

[01:01:36] I mean, this upper play field is massive.

[01:01:39] I mean, you just got to, I mean, look at it.

[01:01:41] It goes all the way from my,

[01:01:42] it's half the width of the, of the, of the, of the, of the net.

[01:01:51] Do, do, do, do.

[01:01:53] See, this is why I love when you're standing over the machine,

[01:01:56] I think this gives you a good sense of like the depth

[01:02:00] and the perception and what it's going to feel like to shoot.

[01:02:02] Also, like those plastic wire form, they're not wire form,

[01:02:06] the plastic ramps are so nice when you see them on a game.

[01:02:22] Now, the thing is, like, you know,

[01:02:24] I didn't upload all these photos,

[01:02:25] but you can see how they've kind of arranged them all.

[01:02:29] Petit, Leo, did a great job on all the scopes.

[01:02:45] All right, I don't know what that page is.

[01:02:48] All right, I mean, there, there, there it is.

[01:02:52] Like we, we can keep looking at it.

[01:02:54] I'm sorry gang about the Google Doc callers.

[01:02:57] I don't know what happened there.

[01:02:58] They were fine when I uploaded them earlier.

[01:03:01] So let's just talk about it.

[01:03:03] I mean, let's talk about seeing Alice for the first time.

[01:03:07] Upper play field is a waste of space.

[01:03:09] You guys are like, man, I honestly, I understand now.

[01:03:13] Why I would never get into Pimble manufacturing.

[01:03:16] Like, what, how could you say the upper play field is a waste of space?

[01:03:20] Do you not want fun stuff in Pimble?

[01:03:23] I don't get it.

[01:03:25] I really don't get it.

[01:03:26] I know there's just like trolling going on, but man,

[01:03:28] it's like really weird to be.

[01:03:30] What's the cool count and how many ball paths are the coiled count?

[01:03:34] I don't know.

[01:03:35] The plastic rams are on my toe and are awesome.

[01:03:38] It has no toys.

[01:03:40] I don't, I don't think it has no toys.

[01:03:46] I mean, I would think that upper play fields like magnetic flipping,

[01:03:49] upper play field is a toy to me.

[01:03:51] I absolutely, I think that, you know,

[01:03:53] the outlane saves are toys.

[01:03:55] You know, you turn them on.

[01:03:56] Like anything where like you're interacting with the ball in a physical way to me is kind of like a toy.

[01:04:02] That's not a flipper or a generic, you know, normal part that's in every game.

[01:04:06] Like a pop bumper is not a toy.

[01:04:23] I'm just reading all your comments, gang, it's going fast.

[01:04:28] Where's the bash toy?

[01:04:29] You know, bash toys.

[01:04:31] You know, like does it have a sentinel mech like X-Men?

[01:04:35] Absolutely not.

[01:04:38] Yeah, I mean, like everyone's in the same boat.

[01:04:47] Of the game is gorgeous.

[01:04:50] You know, is it fun to play?

[01:04:52] I don't know.

[01:04:53] I haven't played it.

[01:04:54] I haven't played it.

[01:04:58] Remove me from the list.

[01:05:01] But we'll see like gang, I'm really curious to see, you know, what the market's going to do today.

[01:05:08] I think it's going to sell out.

[01:05:09] I still think it's going to sell out.

[01:05:10] I think I think 500 of those things out in the world is going to do.

[01:05:18] I think the video is supposed to come any minute now.

[01:05:22] Like I don't have the video.

[01:05:24] Let me check my email, but I know that Nelvin didn't give, carry or myself the video.

[01:05:31] As of last night, let's see.

[01:05:41] No video.

[01:05:42] Hmm.

[01:05:47] Oh, here we go.

[01:05:52] Wow.

[01:05:53] No, I'm just, I'm here for the conversation now guys.

[01:06:02] Yeah, I mean, I, I definitely think it's, it's, you know, I agree, I agree with kind of everybody's sentiments on the game.

[01:06:13] I do. I, I hear the sentiments around like, there's no toys, there's no magical mechs, there's no that I wouldn't, you know, I think, I think it's hard with these kinds of like projects is, is understanding the beginning and the end.

[01:06:30] I mean, it's like, you know, Melvin's a small team.

[01:06:36] And, you know, for him to make what was a phone core game into this in eight months and get it ready for market, you know, they got to do software, they don't, they don't have, they don't have a big team guys.

[01:06:49] This is, this is going to be a very bespoke sort of not for everybody.

[01:06:56] Fun, whimsical, pinball machine. I mean, I guess our magnets under the play field, I guess those are not toys. I mean, I don't know, I think like, I think when you see like what the game play is and how,

[01:07:12] how the ball paths work and how the magnets grab the ball and how, you know, the ball can be diverted into different areas, you know, it's not, I don't know, I got to see it too.

[01:07:24] I got to see it like the rest of you guys, but I just know standing over that game with the theme, the art, the music, the callouts, the animations are neat, they really are.

[01:07:36] I've seen them. I think it's going to be like a really fun sort of like throwback, valley Williams kind of pinball experience. Right. I mean, I just do, I do.

[01:07:47] That's, that's my, that's my story and I'm sticking with it. Look, and if we see more, you know, I need to see more just as much as the rest of you guys.

[01:07:57] Yeah, I mean, like, I'm not, I'm not going to make toys materialize at a thin air. I mean, I see the same game you guys do.

[01:08:13] It looks like a game from the 80s. No, I don't know. Does it from the 80s? Well, definitely is meant to be more of a throwback kind of looking game for sure.

[01:08:26] You're failing on cross examination. No, like, King, this, this to me, this to me is, is exactly, you know, what I thought, oh, this was going to be.

[01:08:49] When I look at, you know, and look at the, the zidware game, and I look at what Melvin created. I see that game in working form.

[01:09:00] I mean, you know, I'm saying like it wasn't like that game had this like major mech that's now missing.

[01:09:10] Target's are not, are not drop targets. Well, there's a, there's a drop target in the game. There's a drop target. That's the, the queen of hearts is soldier. His head is a drop target.

[01:09:33] Like, there's going to, there's going to have to be, there's going to have to be a photo. The photo is coming out today. I mean, sorry, the photo, the video is coming out today.

[01:09:43] Hold on one second. I'll be, I'll be right back. Don't get it. Let's, let's go through the photos again. Let's look at it again. I know, I know, I know you guys. I know you guys. Like, this is like, this, this, this like, I think this game speaks to like the zidware J-pop fanboys, which are missing.

[01:10:02] I know that like, man, some of you guys out there, like, it's like, you act like there's nothing in this. That looks fun to shoot, which I think is wrong. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. I'll be right. I'm, I just got to take this out and like sweating, for views.

[01:10:18] I think is all I'm like sweating, for views. I'm, hold on.

[01:11:18] Oh, yeah. Oh, Alice.

[01:11:48] Yeah.

[01:11:58] All right.

[01:12:08] What's the, what's the consensus here is everybody, as everybody, um, all right. Here we go. Sorry. I was just like dying. And I'm still like on the meds.

[01:12:21] So, so if I get blamed, I'll never get blamed for like, Wanka hype, because I didn't say Alice was like loaded with toys. You'll never see me on record saying it's loaded with toys, or it's the best game ever.

[01:12:34] I think it is a beautiful game. I'll tell you what I like about the game. I think the game is beautiful. I think the game is stunning. I think the shots look really fun. And I think the code with the objectives of battling all the different characters.

[01:12:50] Alice meets in Wonderland. And I've seen the animations. I've seen the game. When you hear the music and you see the lights and you see it all come together. It just looks damn fun. That's it.

[01:13:03] And it's sexy. And there's not a lot of them. And I, I don't know what else to tell you. Like that's why I like the game.

[01:13:10] I don't want another like Keith Johnson 27 mini modes in Avatar kind of game. Like I get it. Like some people enjoy that. It's not for me.

[01:13:22] I when I look at Alice, it looks like a game that like anyone can walk up to and enjoy playing it. That's what I like. I mean, that's what Pimbo used to be.

[01:13:33] I don't know. I don't know. I can't predict the way the market's going to go. I can just tell you my feelings on the game. I'm going to get one.

[01:13:45] I don't, I don't think you're going to see these things available for that long. I think you're.

[01:13:53] I think you're maybe I don't know. Right. I mean, ultimately the market will do what the market does. I can't, I can't dictate right now.

[01:14:03] You know, it's 120 right now. People are people are well, the polling here doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Like this. Right now.

[01:14:15] What matters when it comes to selling this game out, I'll start a poll. I'm not avoiding the poll. What matters is what the people do that get hit up by the distributors today.

[01:14:28] You know, and that that's going to be it. That's going to be it.

[01:14:36] All this looks bitchy. Yeah, people are saying that she's got like that like sassy look on her face.

[01:14:46] Wow, Chris, I did, did you get in a deposit before DPX page crash? Did it crash?

[01:14:57] Yeah, it's good to touch pinball X.

[01:15:07] Now. Let's see.

[01:15:21] Where's the order? I'm like looking for the order.

[01:15:29] I, Chris, what about American pinballs?

[01:15:37] Um.

[01:15:44] You think that looks like an average game.

[01:15:49] I don't buy it. I don't buy it. I've been covering this hobby for 11 years. Like I look, I'll, I'll end it a pin where in, in areas where it deserves to be indicted, but like an average pin.

[01:16:08] I think what's hard for this one gang, I mean, as I think what's hard for this one is like what you're comparing it to and should we compare all pins equally probably at this price, right?

[01:16:24] So like, I'm looking at this game and I know it's 12 5 and you know,

[01:16:35] depending on the gameplay, right, depending on the experience. I don't know, I just, I just, I don't think this is going to go like down as an average pin that like, but it's weird too, because it's like it's meant for collectors and like a collector who wants something like that.

[01:16:53] That's it. You know, so I think what's going to be interesting about today is whether or not, you know, Melvin's, Melvin's initial plan was to have 350 and buried bumped it up to 500.

[01:17:06] We're going to see today gang like I didn't make this pin. I've just been hyping it, you know, because I'm excited about it because again, because it's targeting someone like me who wears two watches and pink sunglasses inside.

[01:17:20] I'm excited about this pin. I can't wait to get it. I'm going to have some time before I need to pay for mine because I'm near the end of the line because I got a, you know, I got a apartment to sell and I've got no room right now.

[01:17:34] I got to figure out where to put the second pin. I think it's going to go in the garage.

[01:17:38] But man, I still think there's enough pinball collectors out there where this thing is going to sell out.

[01:17:49] I'm not going to bail on my, my Alice. No.

[01:17:55] It's a, well, here's a thing.

[01:18:00] It's, it's a $9,000 pin. Someone just said, you know, look, pricing is, is difficult. I'll tell you right now the bomb on this game is more expensive than a sternally.

[01:18:14] What have I told you that? Like much more expensive.

[01:18:20] And that's the thing. It's like I just don't think people appreciate are really looking at what's in this. And I get it.

[01:18:28] Like you might not want to appreciate the top or the sculptor, the plastic ramps or the magnets in it and the, you know, the other features of the game full RGB RGB lit like side rails.

[01:18:41] And I, the bomb is higher than a sternally in this game much higher.

[01:18:47] And without an IP cost. Remember that.

[01:18:53] So like, you know, I don't know if it's, you look, I, I feel like this is going to be one of those games where the collectors that this game was designed for are going to get one and be happy.

[01:19:07] And everybody else is just going to like chastise them.

[01:19:12] Which is like kind of par for the pinball community, you know, we're a very, we're very territorial. Like a game comes out.

[01:19:22] And you know, we have opinions about, I mean, like I've got strong opinions about this game. I got strong opinions about avatar. I got.

[01:19:28] And in the end, like all of our opinions are valid gang. Like this is not a math problem. There's no right and wrong. So I mean, I, I wholeheartedly love all of your feedback that I'm reading right here.

[01:19:41] I know that I do know this because I live this hobby and live social media.

[01:19:48] That the person that says it's beautiful. I love it will be drowned out by eight people saying they hate it. And the people that hate things are always going to have more, more attention. It's just the way it goes.

[01:20:08] Let's see. I'm just trying to reach some of the comments. I'm not super impressed with this game, but I still completely agree with you. People are not seeing it at all, all the cost.

[01:20:21] Yeah, I mean, it's, it's got a lot. It's got a lot, you know, and.

[01:20:27] So this is better than the 90s. I think gang, you got to remember, you got to remember like small little team made this game.

[01:20:39] Right. They don't have the resources. They don't have the, and I'm not saying this as an excuse. I'm just saying, like, you know, this is like craft pinball.

[01:20:50] You enjoy craft beer, right? You spend a lot more for it. This is craft pinball.

[01:20:58] And look now, you know, I think now.

[01:21:02] It's going to, you know, I don't know. I have no line of sight over what's happening last half hour with the orders.

[01:21:13] We need the video.

[01:21:19] I think, I think in an hour when you guys are, I've gone through the same emotional journey. You guys are all going on. I have. I like, I was like excited at first. I like, well, I don't know.

[01:21:33] Like as a month in it. Like, is this like, like, you know, could the artwork of men this way? Like, what's the, you know, do we need the topper.

[01:21:42] And then when Melvin started talking me through the gameplay and how it all works and how there's a lot of like fun quirky things happening.

[01:21:52] The other part I left out guys the exclusive that I have for each and every one of you is that no one else knows this. So you get this here first exclusively.

[01:22:03] The all of the yours sculpts in the game have been painted with UV ink. I mean, this is like, I'm not making this up. It's all been painted with UV ink.

[01:22:16] So you can add UV lighting to this game and really go on a trippy Alice adventure in Wonderland.

[01:22:25] So I just, I'm they didn't do it in response to Avatar. It's already been done. Just kind of funny that two games are using UV ink at the same time to create like a trippy experience.

[01:22:49] Now there's there's not UV from the factory John. It's not it's not it's not like in there now, but and Melbourne's like made this game like very open source. So you're going to be able to add.

[01:23:04] You know, it's just the lighting as you want. He's also got open source software in it. So like, if you wanted to go into this game and add.

[01:23:15] You know, some scenes from, I don't know, Johnny Depp's Alice in Wonderland. Like, they're not going to, they're not going to lock up the ability for people to add stuff all out like the way people have putting clips from, you know, stern games and stuff like that.

[01:23:45] Well, I think I've been a little bit, a little bit softer on the bye bye bye around this game. I think I've sort of communicated my excitement.

[01:23:55] I, you know, like I, I think I think one day my, my FOMO hype train and the product itself, I think G and R like I was accurate. Like I think, you know, G and R is still a masterpiece on every level.

[01:24:11] It's a game that just will never leave my household. I think it's a game where like Jersey Jag will never make a game with the integration that well ever again in the history of the company because slash gave them everything.

[01:24:27] How's everybody doing ordering one? I'm curious like, has anyone pulled the trigger? Did you get, because I'm not on the emails. Did you get an email?

[01:24:40] I'm curious what the, what the feedback is on your front.

[01:24:48] You can be flash light.

[01:24:53] Alright, let's go to the website. Let's do that. That's a good point. Let's go to great American pinball.

[01:24:59] And see if we can order one right now.

[01:25:05] Do do do do.

[01:25:12] Let me put in. I love these sites. Let me put in. That's more for customer.

[01:25:18] I love it. His deposit $50 more.

[01:25:22] Oh, there's a processing fee.

[01:25:28] Yeah, I think what's going to be interesting now.

[01:25:32] If the game doesn't sell out and you know, the, the, the market will deal with the market does, you know, the,

[01:25:44] the importance now of the game at expo becomes interesting.

[01:25:48] Again, we've only, this game's only been available for 32 minutes. So, you know, I have no idea.

[01:25:56] It's at a stock already.

[01:26:00] I thought I could add it to card now. That's, I mean, so like that was pretty fast game.

[01:26:09] That 50 games at gap just went in 30 minutes. That's a good sign. No.

[01:26:19] I, I, I think that's a good sign.

[01:26:27] Oh, that's actually interesting. A bunch of people have put it in their cart, but haven't checked out.

[01:26:33] So let's see. Let's go back.

[01:26:38] So I think gap at 50. Here, let me, let me.

[01:26:44] By the way, is it, is the mic better? Does it sound better?

[01:26:54] So, Quintaker is not even putting it on the website.

[01:26:59] Because Melissa's like, I have more people that want it than, than I, like, I'm not even going to bother.

[01:27:05] Like, I, I, she had like 300 people interested and she had 200 games.

[01:27:17] Alright, so people are saying that great American pinball is now going to hold back games.

[01:27:23] Because he's going to scout them for over.

[01:27:28] Now we, we have our beautiful feelings about distributors and then price gouging us.

[01:27:34] Yeah, let's air all that out while we're here.

[01:27:42] Well, we, we all know that some districts do that, right? We saw that like, like,

[01:27:48] like Jurassic Park during COVID, we're popping up new in box for like 19,000.

[01:27:58] So the pinball trader site has crashed.

[01:28:02] Gang, these seem like good signs for a sell out, you know, all the moping and grope in.

[01:28:11] So Quintaker seems to be doing hers in order.

[01:28:16] If you were asked because just on the list, she guaranteed a game to those early on list.

[01:28:22] If you replied within an hour.

[01:28:25] So I just want to say like, it's too early to call it.

[01:28:29] I mean, I said day one sell out.

[01:28:32] And what I'm looking at now, gang is one just rose website has crashed.

[01:28:39] And the other is out of stock.

[01:28:42] And then the other one won't even let you order it.

[01:28:46] So again, FOMO, FOMO, we have no video.

[01:28:53] We have no this. We have no that. All we have is a super sexy rare pinball machine that is going to be super cool.

[01:29:02] And I think a lot of the early vitriol against it, y'all going to be eating your words.

[01:29:09] I'm telling you, it's going to sell out.

[01:29:12] And like, you can tell, like I was a little like worried for a minute, but like the market will do what the market does.

[01:29:17] And if the market speaks the way I thought it was going to speak.

[01:29:22] Now look, I'll play devil's advocate.

[01:29:26] If it sells out, it doesn't mean it's a great game.

[01:29:30] You know what I'm saying? Like I haven't played it.

[01:29:33] You should unsubscribe to me and never listen to a word I say.

[01:29:39] If I tell you a game is amazing, and I've never played it, like then you're just in Kuku land.

[01:29:46] Like I need to play the game.

[01:29:48] The same way, like I ragged on Elton John. I ragged on it.

[01:29:53] I made more fun of that game before playing it.

[01:29:58] And then I played it and I felt like an idiot because it's amazing.

[01:30:03] It is maybe the best shooting, best looking modern pinball machine of all time.

[01:30:09] It just is. It runs circles around Avatar, runs circles around GNR.

[01:30:12] It runs circles around like, like almost any game.

[01:30:16] It's that good.

[01:30:18] I, you know, you just got to on Elton John.

[01:30:21] I don't really want to own an Elton right now, but I'm happy the game exists because it's phenomenal.

[01:30:31] See what's going to happen here now is like, you know, FOMO is interesting, right?

[01:30:36] The way FOMO works. And I've seen it for over a decade in pinball.

[01:30:44] If, if we don't get a sense that the demand is outpacing the supply,

[01:30:51] which we don't on games like, you know, a thousand John Wigs, a thousand Avatar,

[01:30:55] is a thousand Elton John's like a thousand Godfather's.

[01:30:58] When we know that the demand isn't even at where the manufacturer's supply is at,

[01:31:05] when we know it's not there or catching up to it, the problem then becomes the opposite is happening.

[01:31:13] Is that there's going to always be far more supply than demand.

[01:31:18] And that's going to cause the price to keep decreasing and sometimes crash pretty quickly.

[01:31:25] And that's why today is so pivotal for Alice because if, if the demand is super strong

[01:31:32] and they're locking in all these non-refundable deposits that aren't refundable until 2026,

[01:31:38] it goes to show you what's going to happen next is the price will probably just be steady.

[01:31:46] I don't think it's going to, you know, not going to trade them for like 20 grand.

[01:31:50] That's not that kind of theme.

[01:31:52] But I think you're going to see a stable ownership of the game.

[01:31:58] And I also think a lot of people are not going to want to trade out because trading back in

[01:32:03] is going to be really hard when there's only 500 forever.

[01:32:21] Yeah, see, Bill Brandes gets it.

[01:32:23] Bill, they made this game for people like you and me.

[01:32:25] They made this game for posters like me who, who, who, who, who wish they were as rich as Bill.

[01:32:32] But that's who this game is made for.

[01:32:35] The, the, the, the collector of high quality items and the poser like me.

[01:32:42] Who, who can afford those items but will feel it the next month.

[01:32:47] Bill won't feel it. I will.

[01:32:50] That's who this game is made for.

[01:32:52] And there's, I guarantee you there are at least 500 of bills in Canada's out there.

[01:33:00] There's at least 250 of each in each camp.

[01:33:03] All right. So are some people saying they never got a coin takeer email?

[01:33:12] Because I think I was worried about coin takers strategy here.

[01:33:18] Because I think Melissa's.

[01:33:21] Kind of like just, I bet they never blasted out an email.

[01:33:25] I bet they're going like down the list.

[01:33:28] All right, you got Kelly got one.

[01:33:33] Prozer for hose.

[01:33:35] Alice is for gentlemen.

[01:33:38] Let's, let's do this.

[01:33:41] Let's go back.

[01:33:46] Okay, I want to go back and just like, let's just look at it again.

[01:33:50] I think sometimes we get very critical and we say a lot of stuff quickly.

[01:33:59] But the truth is, you know, I really do think I think this game is going to.

[01:34:13] I think this game is going to be really like really cool.

[01:34:19] And I've been saying that.

[01:34:22] Like let's just go back and look at this thing.

[01:34:26] I mean, I don't, I don't know.

[01:34:29] Someone said this game just looks average.

[01:34:33] I mean, I wish this was the average looking pinball machine.

[01:34:37] That we got.

[01:34:40] I mean, I think this.

[01:34:43] And I say this as someone who has like a guns and roses CE and I've seen X-Men and I've seen Avatar.

[01:34:48] I got the coin tick email.

[01:34:53] They had a list of 200, I believe they will go down the list after a few people don't confirm.

[01:35:00] Gap sold out while I was trying to check out.

[01:35:05] Does this look like an average pinball machine to you guys?

[01:35:13] I don't know.

[01:35:16] I think it looks better than average.

[01:35:19] You know what I love?

[01:35:22] I mean, come on guys.

[01:35:25] Like I'm curious how many of you.

[01:35:31] If this is going to fly in the household.

[01:35:36] You know what I'm saying?

[01:35:39] It's cool.

[01:35:42] This is.

[01:35:48] I mean.

[01:35:55] Let's get to the good stuff.

[01:36:15] Okay.

[01:36:17] Now.

[01:36:21] I really.

[01:36:24] You know, as I look at this layout, it reminds me a lot of J-pop.

[01:36:30] Right. And I think.

[01:36:33] And I like that because there's, I think there's going to be a real.

[01:36:38] I think it's going to be very, you know, more of a casual players game.

[01:36:45] But I think these spinning discs on the sides, I love.

[01:36:51] I mean, that looks like a pretty big pathway to get to them.

[01:36:54] So like charging them up is going to be a strategic part of the game and using your reflexes to hit it.

[01:37:02] But I love, you know, looking at this, I do love just like.

[01:37:08] Kind of like thinking about these shots coming off these flippers.

[01:37:11] I mean, think about this.

[01:37:14] Like you've got.

[01:37:17] Got ball going in here.

[01:37:18] Now, there's a, can you guys see my mouse?

[01:37:20] There's a.

[01:37:21] See that on the left side.

[01:37:23] There's a pelican or flim, sorry.

[01:37:26] There's a magnet underneath there.

[01:37:29] That will grab the ball and throw it, which I think is really cool.

[01:37:33] Then you've got the pathway up there.

[01:37:36] To the left.

[01:37:37] And it looks like it loops around, right?

[01:37:40] I think this game's going to have a lot of zaniness to the shots and the ball paths that you can't quite see on this top down angle.

[01:37:51] I love the shot up the middle right into the ramp.

[01:37:54] I mean, there's nothing more satisfying than a shot right up the middle, whip it up that ramp.

[01:38:00] Whip it up that ramp is going to be your as I said it.

[01:38:03] I was like, I feel like people are going to make fun of me for this entire thing.

[01:38:08] You are, you are one of the 200 names on our list for this title.

[01:38:13] Deposit of 1500 will be due and we will be sending out invoices as soon as DPX tells us we can send them out.

[01:38:22] Yeah, see what's happening with coin taker and Melissa and the allocation is as expected is.

[01:38:30] They don't know exactly how many they're going to get.

[01:38:36] Again, because I think of that EA promise, I don't know how many games like they're going to have to pull from gap or even just from the European distributors like there's a distributor in Europe.

[01:38:48] There's one in Canada and Australia, I think.

[01:38:52] Where's the play field LCD.

[01:38:54] It's the play field LCD Joe is the clock.

[01:38:58] So let's show you that.

[01:39:00] See, it's right here.

[01:39:03] So, let's just look at this thing.

[01:39:06] Someone said, someone said earlier that the upper play field is stupid.

[01:39:13] Upper play field is dumb.

[01:39:16] So for someone who said that it's just the watch, I would like to remind you guys that.

[01:39:23] Isn't that cool that there's a stopwatch like an old school stopwatch.

[01:39:28] That's going to basically communicate with the player.

[01:39:38] Account down when you're in different modes, the clock is going to activate and countdown and give you that nice sense of urgency.

[01:39:48] Right there on the play field.

[01:39:50] You don't like that.

[01:39:51] I like that.

[01:39:53] But I'd rather have this than like a big tablet like toy story.

[01:39:59] I mean, it's integrated into a sculpt.

[01:40:01] I mean, this is beautiful.

[01:40:10] The colors are bad.

[01:40:19] I'm trying to find.

[01:40:42] It's exhausting.

[01:40:48] It's exhausting because on one front, you know, there's thousands of new inbox pinball buyers, right?

[01:40:59] Every year.

[01:41:01] And there's only going to be 500 of these and they're all going to sell today.

[01:41:07] Let's just, again, I don't know what to tell you.

[01:41:11] You're buying it for the wrong reasons.

[01:41:14] Dream theme, nope, haven't ever seen it shoot.

[01:41:19] Well, the flippin ball of musements.

[01:41:22] Let me tell you something.

[01:41:23] Who are you to tell me what my reasons are?

[01:41:31] Why do my reasons for wanting this game have to be the same as your reasons?

[01:41:39] Do I need to have the same reasons as you?

[01:41:45] Am I wrong if my reasons are to have a rare work of pinball art that is playable and highly addictive and fun?

[01:41:55] Is it might not allowed to have something where I don't want to have something that everybody else has?

[01:42:03] You know, I do find there to be a level of, oh, okay, wrong reasons for you.

[01:42:10] Well, that's fine.

[01:42:11] That's fine.

[01:42:12] And we're cool again.

[01:42:15] But yeah, everyone's got different reasons.

[01:42:17] Totally.

[01:42:18] Like, I get it.

[01:42:19] Like, different strokes for different folks.

[01:42:20] I get it.

[01:42:24] From the Wade and C guy.

[01:42:30] Like, I'm going to tell you right now, Cody, that this game is going to shoot fun.

[01:42:34] It, you know what, Cody, I don't have to play this game to tell you that it's going to be fun to shoot because it's a fan layout.

[01:42:41] And, you know, I know everything in it.

[01:42:43] Melvin walked me through all the different ways the ball goes and all the different like things.

[01:42:48] It, it, it sounds really fun.

[01:42:50] I'd be shocked.

[01:42:52] I'd be shocked if Barry and Melvin and everyone over at Dutch Pimball has had this game in development for a year and it's not fun to play.

[01:43:01] I'd be shocked.

[01:43:03] Okay.

[01:43:07] The tail, the trailer is dropping in 10 minutes.

[01:43:10] How about this?

[01:43:11] How about we stay on here and we watch the trailer together and we hold hands.

[01:43:17] And, you know, we remind each other to flush after going to the bathroom today.

[01:43:22] How about we do that together?

[01:43:26] Um.

[01:43:31] Well, here's a thing gang.

[01:43:33] If you got Melissa's test email.

[01:43:38] I think she's struggling with the demand.

[01:43:46] 45 available on Pimball traders website.

[01:43:49] So wait, what happened in Pimball trader?

[01:43:51] I thought they were sold out.

[01:43:53] Let's go back.

[01:43:55] How did 45 become available?

[01:43:57] Like they, they only sold five.

[01:43:59] There's no way that's.

[01:44:01] I think Pimball traders is having trouble.

[01:44:06] They're not used to this.

[01:44:08] Let's see.

[01:44:09] I'm on Pimball traders website.

[01:44:11] New Pimball.

[01:44:15] Let's see.

[01:44:18] He's got 45 in stock.

[01:44:23] Oh, maybe, maybe he was slow.

[01:44:28] Yeah, you're right.

[01:44:31] But that just leads me to believe that he.

[01:44:35] He just got his allotment and hit go on this.

[01:44:39] But for those of you who are interested.

[01:44:43] I think he's going to be.

[01:44:46] Here's the.

[01:44:50] If you don't want to wait for Melissa to get back to you.

[01:44:54] There you go.

[01:44:56] Well, let's watch it, right?

[01:44:57] Let's watch it because he's.

[01:45:01] He's got the number there.

[01:45:02] I like that.

[01:45:03] We can keep refreshing it.

[01:45:05] And see if it goes down 45 and stock.

[01:45:08] It's still 45.

[01:45:10] Nobody's buying.

[01:45:12] He's buying.

[01:45:20] Wait, so like, why do you have to be on the list?

[01:45:23] Can you just click that link with Pimball traders and buy it?

[01:45:34] The site number isn't valid.

[01:45:38] He has.

[01:45:39] He had his original 50.

[01:45:52] What kind of business is that?

[01:45:54] Are you going to cancel your order?

[01:45:56] If you're not on the list, then just shut down the list.

[01:45:59] If he's sold.

[01:46:01] All right.

[01:46:02] So I think I've been validated a little bit.

[01:46:04] You most this game is sold out.

[01:46:06] This game is selling out as we speak.

[01:46:09] This is what a sellout looks like.

[01:46:12] And y'all made me feel bad.

[01:46:14] Like a half hour ago.

[01:46:15] I was in height mode.

[01:46:16] And you're like, game bug league.

[01:46:18] Game's got no toys in it.

[01:46:19] No one's going to buy it.

[01:46:20] Like neck neck neck.

[01:46:21] So that's all that.

[01:46:22] So that's all that.

[01:46:23] So that's all that.

[01:46:24] So that's all that.

[01:46:25] We got one dude over here who like is taking orders.

[01:46:28] He can't even fulfill.

[01:46:29] So he's canceling orders.

[01:46:30] We got another distributor who's out of stock.

[01:46:33] And then we got another distributor that was supposed to

[01:46:35] blast the email everybody a chance to get the game first come first serve.

[01:46:39] And they haven't sent out the email.

[01:46:41] So they can't they can't fulfill the demand.

[01:46:45] So it's sold out.

[01:46:50] I actually don't know if it sold out.

[01:46:52] But let's let's wait for the video.

[01:46:56] And let's see the video together.

[01:46:59] Like I'm worried about this video because I know it's not going to be amazing.

[01:47:02] I don't mean the gameplay.

[01:47:03] I mean, I know it's not going to be like a hundred thousand dollar deep dive like

[01:47:09] Jersey after Jersey Jack spent a hundred grand on that video.

[01:47:13] I mean, it shows it was amazing.

[01:47:15] But man, like damn, like I'd hate to follow that with this video.

[01:47:21] We're about to see.

[01:47:22] But I hope it's just like dairy like kind of drunk like what you got now.

[01:47:26] I mean, what the hell you been working on all these months?

[01:47:28] All right.

[01:47:29] I'm filming it back.

[01:47:30] You know, like they should just go as like low fire as possible.

[01:47:36] I think that'd be the best way to do it.

[01:47:41] Oh, look, it's selling out now.

[01:47:44] Now when people get locked out, who are they going to come?

[01:47:48] Who are they going to come crawling to to try to get one?

[01:47:51] I'll tell you who can he just pinball podcasts because I might have one for one of my fans.

[01:47:59] I might have like, I might have had them hold one for one of my fans because I love my fan base.

[01:48:06] I could just look at this all day.

[01:48:08] I don't even want to play pinball.

[01:48:09] That's what I'm want to look at this.

[01:48:11] Who needs to play pinball when you've got like I love this lit up arm.

[01:48:15] Oh, so good.

[01:48:18] Flippers again to flip.

[01:48:22] Let's see the armor.

[01:48:24] I don't know if I can zoom in anymore.

[01:48:25] I can't zoom in anymore.

[01:48:27] I've got that hours phrase on it.

[01:48:32] Yeah, but again, guess what?

[01:48:33] A flipper is not going to flip it for for 12 5.

[01:48:39] I never I never charge more than the game is worth when I give it to a Canadian club member.

[01:48:45] So just just just keep that in mind.

[01:48:47] If you think you're getting this game for 12 5 and it sells out in an hour, you're you're out of your mind.

[01:48:54] This is this might even be selling out faster than Pulp Fiction.

[01:49:04] I love today like this is fun like I wish every Monday in the pinball world was like this because it's normally not.

[01:49:13] So where do they say they're dropping this this this trailer.

[01:49:18] Does anyone know?

[01:49:22] What about the all black apron?

[01:49:26] I want to go to that.

[01:49:32] I'll tell you why he did the all black apron, which also if you don't like it.

[01:49:38] Customize it.

[01:49:39] It is like the easiest thing to customize.

[01:49:42] So the reason he did this and I kind of get it is he wanted.

[01:49:47] You'll hear it when we talk to them, but he really wanted it to feel like.

[01:49:54] You know she's entering into wonderland and like everything's in front you know sort of like in front of the flippers is where all the wonder is and not have like distractions below there.

[01:50:07] Now remember a J pop game.

[01:50:08] This was just stainless steel.

[01:50:09] There was nothing on Zidware.

[01:50:11] But I think you know I think this will be.

[01:50:16] This lights up though so the the queen of hearts.

[01:50:21] imagery in the middle here that all lights up and I think that glowing red while the whole game is lit up is going to be really cool.

[01:50:33] The original concept had nice apron art did it let's see.

[01:50:40] Why am I art.

[01:50:46] I see what you're saying it did have like the the Alice's well that's like.

[01:50:52] You know really it kind of had like the logo here and like some vines here.

[01:50:57] Well look I gang I'm not I'm not going to say that apron art is really important.

[01:51:08] You know the again this is the kind of thing where it's magnetic where if the mod community wants to add art here super simple it's all magnetized.

[01:51:26] Who who didn't get one.

[01:51:31] So are people buying from.

[01:51:34] Kimball traders and you're not really sure you're going to get it is that what's happening now like they're going to like even though it says 41 in stock he.

[01:51:44] These are backups that he might refund people.

[01:51:53] Is every is is all metal magnetized John.

[01:51:57] Is that accurate.

[01:52:00] I wasn't I wasn't sure that all metals magnetized.

[01:52:11] I don't I don't think you'd want to sculpt it apron I think that's too much I do.

[01:52:21] We're.

[01:52:33] Yeah I I'm glad someone brought up this point is Dutch has like 5000 followers on Facebook and turns got 100,000.

[01:52:42] And then you know that's a good thing that you can sell 500 games in in you know in an hour or a day. Bravo Bravo.

[01:53:00] Yeah back to the future gang is like earliest is the unveil be expo next year.

[01:53:09] I I I really.

[01:53:12] You know it's not like they've got a huge team developing it while they're making all these libouss keys.

[01:53:20] One minute for the trailer. Where is the trailer going to be because I'll screen share and we'll go there.

[01:53:26] Does anyone know where the trailer is going to drop.

[01:53:29] I'm assuming it's going to be on their Facebook page so let me pull that up right now.

[01:53:43] It's just fun to see another game on Dutch pinball's Facebook page you know like it's been a libousky for a decade.

[01:53:52] This game really does photograph well I really do think it looks sexy a but okay so two o'clock is that one that when it's dropping so I'm just kind of surfing around here.

[01:54:13] We need a big full play field HD image I think I've got that hold I think I don't know.

[01:54:28] All right let's see.

[01:54:32] Okay here we go we're in.

[01:54:44] Oh hold on I have to play it.

[01:54:47] I have to play it in Facebook hold on.

[01:54:53] No I don't hold on.

[01:54:56] I'm going to show you this screen share.

[01:55:05] I don't know if you're going to be able to hear this but let's do this.

[01:55:36] I don't know.

[01:55:39] Oh jackpot I was jackpot.

[01:55:45] Welcome.

[01:55:53] Wow that's magic.

[01:55:58] Oh that hurts.

[01:56:05] Get out.

[01:56:10] Get out.

[01:56:17] I don't understand why they don't have like you even have a lazy thing.

[01:56:26] You can see the magnet there.

[01:56:29] I'm just going to put it in.

[01:56:32] God's God's who's down all the time.

[01:56:40] What is it?

[01:56:44] What the hell you got?

[01:56:52] Oh yeah jackpot.

[01:56:57] Oh wow.

[01:57:02] Wow that's great.

[01:57:07] Multi-mode.

[01:57:14] Oh man.

[01:57:20] Oh man.

[01:57:25] Have you ever played pinball before?

[01:57:32] They needed to have like a like you needed to be able to see the popper from the top of the plate.

[01:57:40] I knew the video was not going to be great.

[01:57:46] Oh my gosh.

[01:57:50] Very zidware.

[01:57:53] Not a video.

[01:57:58] I would have released.

[01:58:01] You can't show a video and not have the ball go from flipper up to things.

[01:58:07] I don't know.

[01:58:13] No one here is confused on whether or not the flippers work.

[01:58:18] That was bad.

[01:58:21] I don't.

[01:58:25] There's no way else around it.

[01:58:28] The reason why I'm like what was that?

[01:58:31] It wasn't even like the game being played.

[01:58:34] You get to be really fun.

[01:58:40] You get to get better at that.

[01:58:44] That's ridiculous.

[01:58:46] You got to know how to shoot the very product you're selling.

[01:58:49] No.

[01:58:51] That's what I'm saying.

[01:58:53] The game.

[01:58:54] You don't even get a sense of gameplay.

[01:58:56] You know.

[01:59:03] You know, even like, I don't know,

[01:59:06] have like the description come up

[01:59:08] when you're seeing something and describing,

[01:59:11] you know, the environments.

[01:59:13] I told this to me open last night.

[01:59:14] I was like, the video's not good

[01:59:15] and you don't have good video, don't launch video.

[01:59:19] I, that was my advice.

[01:59:20] I was like, it's not, it's not beneficial

[01:59:25] if you launch video that doesn't showcase

[01:59:28] like the fun of the game.

[01:59:30] I mean, there's no other way around it.

[01:59:33] Yeah, let's see, that's the thing is like, Skippy is like,

[01:59:38] Skippy said, you're probably not seeing against,

[01:59:40] because it's not good.

[01:59:41] I don't, I don't know, like, no, they didn't even show

[01:59:45] like the ball go up the ramp and loop around,

[01:59:47] which is, which it does.

[01:59:48] Like, that's the thing.

[01:59:49] It's like, I don't get it.

[01:59:53] Like, I don't get it.

[01:59:54] I don't get, it's gotta, it's gotta have, you know,

[01:59:59] it's gotta have flow more than that.

[02:00:03] Like, we didn't even see anything.

[02:00:10] I am, yeah, it was like the voices were the only thing

[02:00:15] that you remember.

[02:00:17] Well, look, it's, that video's still not gonna change

[02:00:19] people's minds.

[02:00:20] It's still gonna sell out today.

[02:00:23] And I think the, you know, I think X-Pose is gonna be

[02:00:28] a moment.

[02:00:29] Like, I think Melvin will get to Expo, sold out game.

[02:00:33] And, you know, now the weight begins,

[02:00:36] and the weight's gonna be pretty significant for most people,

[02:00:41] right, around 10 games a week, starting in January.

[02:00:46] It's gonna be one of these games where you have your deposit

[02:00:49] in, you look forward to getting it, right?

[02:00:54] But, you know, there's gonna be a lot of pinball

[02:00:56] that comes out between now and you getting your Alice.

[02:00:59] But, I still think that people that want an Alice,

[02:01:02] who know what it is, are gonna be fine with that.

[02:01:05] It's hard for us because, again, as I said this all along

[02:01:07] with this game, it's like there's no real,

[02:01:10] this hasn't really happened in the pinball market.

[02:01:12] We don't really know, you know,

[02:01:15] no one's ever tried to really do this successfully,

[02:01:18] or even done it in general.

[02:01:20] So, like, we're not used to this.

[02:01:21] Like, only 500 bespoke small run,

[02:01:25] like high end pinball machine, or, you know,

[02:01:28] aiming to be high end with a high bomb and a lot of stuff.

[02:01:30] Like, I mean, it's the same price as,

[02:01:33] this game basically, you know, with the top and everything,

[02:01:35] this game is the same price as Labyrinth.

[02:01:37] You do understand that, right?

[02:01:39] I mean, given Labyrinth has a license theme

[02:01:41] and has more like emotional draw because of that,

[02:01:44] but it's like basically the same price.

[02:01:51] It's so funny, like, now the video drops

[02:01:54] and spots open up.

[02:01:56] I love it.

[02:01:56] I love watching this.

[02:01:57] Like, this is why marketing matters,

[02:02:01] and it's why I told them, if you don't have a good video,

[02:02:05] don't drop it because, you know,

[02:02:08] at least leave the day with a sense of mystery

[02:02:10] of what gameplay is like.

[02:02:12] And here's the thing, people.

[02:02:14] I don't even get a sense of what the gameplay is like

[02:02:17] from that video, and I don't get a sense that's bad.

[02:02:19] I don't get a sense that it's good.

[02:02:20] All I pull away from that video is callouts.

[02:02:27] That's it.

[02:02:29] I do not get a sense.

[02:02:34] How much is Labyrinth with the toper?

[02:02:51] Nobody would give this game the time of day

[02:02:54] without the Lioroscopes.

[02:02:56] I don't know.

[02:02:57] I think you guys have been way too harsh.

[02:02:59] I really do.

[02:03:00] Again, because I think if you look at what this game is trying

[02:03:05] to be, and it's not trying to be another X-Men,

[02:03:10] another avatar, it's not trying to be a licensed game,

[02:03:15] but yeah, no, I mean, look, as I said, gang,

[02:03:23] I didn't make the game.

[02:03:25] I've been looking at this game.

[02:03:26] I'm glad now everybody has seen it.

[02:03:29] The FOMO train is left the station.

[02:03:35] The feelings on this game over the next 48 to 72 hours

[02:03:39] are gonna go all over the place.

[02:03:41] They are.

[02:03:42] They are.

[02:03:42] And we're gonna get more opinions from Expo.

[02:03:47] I kind of love it now.

[02:03:49] We're kind of in this situation where this game is gonna sell out.

[02:03:54] The video was atrocious.

[02:03:56] Atrocious video does not get me excited about the game.

[02:04:00] I never would have dropped that video.

[02:04:03] I would have sent a game to a streamer to figure out a way

[02:04:08] to showcase it.

[02:04:10] You know what I'm saying?

[02:04:12] So now it's like Expo is gonna be the next moment

[02:04:16] in which you kind of can show people what is the game?

[02:04:21] Because that was not giving me any sense of what is the game.

[02:04:26] But it won't matter, because it'll still sell out.

[02:04:29] And that will annoy a lot of people.

[02:04:32] That something can just sell out

[02:04:36] and not really have...

[02:04:39] Derek, it didn't look epic, brother.

[02:04:42] I don't... Derek, come on.

[02:04:44] I love you, Derek, but don't be delusional.

[02:04:47] Let's go back and look at it again.

[02:04:50] It was...

[02:04:53] This is not a great gameplay trailer.

[02:05:07] Oh.

[02:05:10] It's good shot.

[02:05:16] I shall be too late.

[02:05:24] Bad, bad.

[02:05:27] Bad, I have to say.

[02:05:28] Check one out.

[02:05:29] Check one out.

[02:05:30] Check one out.

[02:05:33] Welcome.

[02:05:37] Wow.

[02:05:42] That's magic.

[02:05:44] Like right there, like you don't even get this feeling.

[02:05:47] Oh, that hits.

[02:05:52] I don't want to launch anything.

[02:05:55] Get out.

[02:05:57] Get out.

[02:05:59] Get out.

[02:06:02] We should've got jangus on callouts for that.

[02:06:10] I'll please say.

[02:06:15] I'm not even just a victim of this.

[02:06:19] Stop.

[02:06:20] Stop.

[02:06:23] Who's down on the top?

[02:06:27] Who is it?

[02:06:28] Who's up?

[02:06:30] Who's up?

[02:06:32] Who's up?

[02:06:34] Who's up?

[02:06:40] Did we even see where the ball went there?

[02:06:44] Oh, what?

[02:06:48] Wow, too early.

[02:06:54] Bull team ball.

[02:06:59] Oh, that's it.

[02:07:07] Oh.

[02:07:11] Oh, have you ever played pinball?

[02:07:29] Okay.

[02:07:31] Yeah, no.

[02:07:33] No.

[02:07:34] No.

[02:07:35] Yeah, I'm still getting my game.

[02:07:38] I just, I just, I just, I don't think that video like.

[02:07:45] Give you any sense of anything other than like callouts and the animations are cool.

[02:07:52] I mean, I like them.

[02:07:55] Kind of Harry Potter font going on there, right?

[02:08:03] No, no, no.

[02:08:05] Yeah, I think I don't, I don't think they gave themselves.

[02:08:08] I don't think that video gives anyone anything to discuss when it comes to gameplay.

[02:08:13] And to me, that's, that's a problem.

[02:08:17] You know, I'll say to you, I'll say to Melvin, like you can't release a game.

[02:08:23] You know, you can't lose touch with the fact that pinball is a game, right?

[02:08:28] So you can't release game, like the game being played for the first time.

[02:08:36] Like that's the first game play footage.

[02:08:39] The world's going to see.

[02:08:41] And you see absolutely no game being played.

[02:08:48] And you know, it shouldn't be so hard, right?

[02:08:52] Like what are the three or four to five most dynamic shots in this game?

[02:08:57] And let's show them as they, as they would be like with that.

[02:09:02] If that's hard to capture, then as someone was saying, then it makes people feel like they're not even in the game.

[02:09:08] Like there is no, there is no shot to show that's fallen or rewarding.

[02:09:12] And I know that's not the case, but you didn't show it.

[02:09:16] So now all we got is this.

[02:09:19] And I know it's a reveal video, but you know, like you're asking people for $12,500 commitment, right?

[02:09:29] With a deposit that's non-refundable for a year, you got to show more.

[02:09:35] You just got to show more.

[02:09:37] You should have shown more.

[02:09:38] You should, you had enough time.

[02:09:40] You should have shown more.

[02:09:42] All right.

[02:09:48] We've been on now for over two hours, gang.

[02:09:50] I'm going to go get some lunch.

[02:09:52] I encourage each and every one of you to do.

[02:09:57] And let's, can we, can we take it from there?

[02:10:01] Is that sound good, gang?

[02:10:04] And I'm, I feel like my pain meds are wearing off.

[02:10:08] I'm going to go get a little food.

[02:10:11] I just want to say thank you guys for hanging out.

[02:10:13] Sorry, the sound is a little choppy.

[02:10:15] It's always fun to do this.

[02:10:19] And as you know, I, I, I hyped this thing.

[02:10:24] Not as bad as Wonka.

[02:10:26] I don't think this is nearly as like bad as people think though either.

[02:10:30] I don't actually think it's that bad.

[02:10:32] I think for what it is, I think it's going to be a really fun game.

[02:10:36] I think that they haven't given us a good video.

[02:10:41] I think the art package is stellar.

[02:10:44] And now, and now I think it's going to come down to like,

[02:10:48] what is this game make you feel when you play it?

[02:10:50] Does it have like personality?

[02:10:52] Does it have, you know, does it get you excited?

[02:10:56] Like are the modes fun?

[02:10:57] Like we don't know anything.

[02:11:00] But I'm just in a, I mean, I'm just an aesthetic.

[02:11:03] The existence of Alice in this package with just 500 ever.

[02:11:09] I think that's going to be a sell out.

[02:11:14] Yes, people are going to flip spots.

[02:11:16] Absolutely.

[02:11:17] Like, yes, you'll be able to wait and see and pick one up.

[02:11:20] Do I think you'll be able to get one for less than 12, five?

[02:11:24] No, I don't not.

[02:11:26] I don't not.

[02:11:27] I don't not.

[02:11:29] Right.

[02:11:30] I think people are going to flip these for a two to three thousand,

[02:11:34] the five, the two thousand or more like profit.

[02:11:37] No, I do not.

[02:11:38] Not right now.

[02:11:40] Not right now.

[02:11:41] It's just not that kind of world anymore.

[02:11:42] Like, you know, we just don't live in a pinball world where things can just be like hovering around 15 grand or 1315 grand.

[02:11:49] I think there's, there's just too much.

[02:11:51] You're just getting, you know, all these pinball companies are diving into our wallets for this much money.

[02:11:56] It's too much.

[02:11:57] So, you know, again, I think this is targeting a very specific buyer.

[02:12:01] I think to that buyer, they've seen all they need to to make up their mind.

[02:12:04] I think everyone else is going to think it's stupid.

[02:12:07] And I think that's okay.

[02:12:10] It's okay to have all this variety.

[02:12:12] Okay.

[02:12:13] Everybody be good.

[02:12:16] Have fun today.

[02:12:18] A lot of conversation will happen around this game.

[02:12:21] I'll do a podcast maybe later today.

[02:12:23] When the hype train is the hype train derail, like that'll be the theme.

[02:12:27] I want to see by the end of the day, like if this game sells out and I want that to sort of guide a little bit.

[02:12:33] The discussion that happens around this game later today.

[02:12:36] Everybody, thank you.

[02:12:38] We'll talk soon.

[02:12:39] I'm glad you appreciate the show.

[02:12:41] I appreciate it.

[02:12:42] All of you hanging out with me for a couple hours later.
