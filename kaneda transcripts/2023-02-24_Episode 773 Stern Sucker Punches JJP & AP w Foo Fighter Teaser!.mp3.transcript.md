[00:00] Oh my gosh, did you see what just happened on a Friday?

[00:18] Sternpinball sucker punched everybody else in the entire industry that was waiting for

[00:23] March to get their new games out.

[00:25] And look what we got now.

[00:26] We've got Foo Fighters trailer and I'm gonna say this right now.

[00:29] I had no expectations of the Foo Fighters.

[00:32] I haven't.

[00:32] I had like, this band is not even on my radar, but this song kicks ass.

[00:36] Like this song is high energy rock and roll.

[00:39] And look, I know what we say.

[00:40] We say there's so much rock and roll and dad rock in the pinball world.

[00:43] But man, pinball is a high energy game.

[00:46] Can you tell the high energy in Canada's voice right now?

[00:50] And I'm going to do a short little podcast right now that's just going to get

[00:52] right to the point.

[00:53] I'm going to talk about what this trailer means for the pinball industry right now,

[00:57] because Sternpinball just sucker punched Jersey Jack and American pinball.

[01:02] And if you're Ken Cromwell and if you're David Fix, you need to get something

[01:05] together, people.

[01:06] You need to get some excitement and hype because Sternpinball dropped this this

[01:11] Friday.

[01:11] They are going to show the game next week.

[01:14] And then the order banks are going to open up.

[01:16] And how are you going to follow up a high energy trailer like this with the

[01:21] freaking Godfather theme song?

[01:23] You're going to put people to sleep.

[01:24] How are you going to follow up a high energy game like this and ask people to

[01:29] join you in outer space for a tank battle?

[01:33] It is so funny to me.

[01:34] And I also love that this trailer that had like zombie Eddie artwork,

[01:38] there is more in this trailer than is in the code for James Bond 60th.

[01:43] And I think everybody who bought a James Bond 60th, when you see this game from

[01:47] Jack Danger, you're going to realize that you also got sucker punched because

[01:51] only suckers would drop 20,000 on that game.

[01:54] Can you hear the excitement in Canada's voice?

[01:56] I am also excited because we get to move past James Bond.

[02:00] I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen, I have been a negative Nelly.

[02:05] I have been toxic.

[02:06] I have been complaining about the prices of pinball, especially the James

[02:11] Bond price.

[02:11] And I'm here to tell you right now, this food fighter trailer, it means I can put

[02:16] all of that behind me.

[02:17] We all can put it behind us.

[02:19] Most of us are not 60 year old men clamoring for a Sean Connery James Bond.

[02:23] And at least this is a band that was popular in the 90s.

[02:27] And I think there's some high energy here.

[02:29] Even this song in the trailer gets me energized.

[02:32] And this is what pinball should be.

[02:34] And I'm going to call it right now.

[02:35] I think this game from Stern pinball from Jack Danger from zombie Eddie.

[02:39] I think this game is going to be a sleeper hit.

[02:41] I think this game from a design standpoint is going to run circles around James

[02:46] Bond.

[02:46] I think Stern pinball made this game with the food fighters.

[02:50] And I think we're going to see a lot of theme integration.

[02:53] I don't think we're going to see all the struggles George Gomez had with the

[02:56] license holder with James Bond.

[02:58] I expect this game.

[02:59] I'm going to call it right now.

[03:01] I think this is going to be a modern day Metallica.

[03:04] I think it's going to be a modern day Metallica.

[03:06] I think it's going to come out of nowhere.

[03:08] And I think it's going to be a surprise hit for a lot of us in the pinball

[03:12] community and none of us were calling it every time I did a poll.

[03:15] Hey, who wants to see food fighter pinball?

[03:17] Nobody, nobody.

[03:19] And so that's actually a good thing in the pinball industry because our

[03:22] expectations are so low.

[03:25] And I think for a lot of us, we are going to get introduced to the music of

[03:29] food fighters via this pinball machine.

[03:31] The same way a lot of us got introduced to Rick and Morty through the pinball

[03:36] machine, because all of us just want to love every single new pinball machine

[03:40] that comes out.

[03:41] And with this machine coming out, I think it's going to introduce us.

[03:44] And look, I'm going to say this.

[03:45] I never in my life have heard the song in that trailer.

[03:50] And I'm like, that's a kick ass song.

[03:53] If the food fighters have a lot of songs like this and you put it into a

[03:56] fun pinball machine, I mean, I'd much rather hear that track than freaking rush.

[04:02] Oh my God, Kanata just triggered the rush fanatics, but not even rushes this

[04:06] high energy.

[04:07] And I think this could work really well in pinball format.

[04:10] I also believe in my brother, Jack Danger.

[04:13] He's a personal friend.

[04:14] And I think he's going to come out and surprise a lot of us.

[04:17] He spent the last two years really nervous and anxious about getting this

[04:21] game out. And I like that.

[04:23] He's got that nervous energy.

[04:24] He wants to make a name for himself.

[04:26] He wants to become pinball designer famous.

[04:29] You know who didn't?

[04:30] Pat Lawler.

[04:31] He was resting on his laurels.

[04:33] And that's why Toy Story is an empty joke.

[04:36] Like I'm going to tell you right now, this game is going to be way more

[04:38] interesting than Toy Story.

[04:40] And I'm so excited because it's going to be shown to us all next week.

[04:44] Who thought stern pinball was going to come out of nowhere the end of February

[04:48] and sucker punch the marketing efforts of Jersey Jack pinball and American

[04:53] pinball. And I would even argue for Scooby-Doo buyers out there.

[04:56] Some of you are going to wish you would have weighed it.

[04:59] If you look at this trailer, we've got the Foo Fighters inside a van.

[05:02] And maybe their van adventure is going to be better than the Scooby-Doo van

[05:06] adventures. We shall see.

[05:08] But I will say this.

[05:09] If you're a grown man and an adult, you're probably more into rock and roll

[05:14] when your friends come over to drink than Scooby freaking do people.

[05:18] Are we still wearing Scooby-Doo pajamas or are we grown adults?

[05:22] Ladies and gentlemen, you can tell Canada is high energy.

[05:24] I'm just super excited.

[05:26] There's a lot of crap going on in my personal life that I'm plowing through.

[05:29] And I know I've been negative.

[05:31] So I definitely want to get more positive and more excited about pinball,

[05:34] the hobby we all love.

[05:35] And look, let me take it a little bit down back to reality.

[05:38] Do I think they're going to sell a thousand Foo Fighters on day one at

[05:42] $13,000 a pop? No, I do not.

[05:45] I don't think there's going to be FOMO for this the way there would with other

[05:49] themes. But I do think this thing is going to have a lot of excitement around it.

[05:54] And I also think storm pinball might lower the number of LEDs.

[05:57] Like if you're going to charge 13 K, because we know they're not going to lower

[06:01] the price, well, then just make 500 or 650 and test the wooders there.

[06:06] I think they're going to have to start doing that.

[06:07] I don't think a thousand LEDs of everything is the winning formula.

[06:11] You got to kind of look at the popularity of each theme in its own right.

[06:15] All right, so here's the thing next week it's coming.

[06:17] And then the order banks open up.

[06:19] And so then you look at a company like American Pinball and like, what were you

[06:22] waiting for? What were you waiting for? Jersey Jack, what are you waiting for?

[06:26] Your toy store sales have been flat for the last five months.

[06:29] What are you guys waiting for?

[06:31] If there's one company that you can't let get in front of you,

[06:35] it's Stern Pinball.

[06:37] And not only do they get James Bond in front of your next game, Jersey Jack,

[06:41] and in front of your next game, American Pinball.

[06:43] Now they've got two games in front of your next games.

[06:45] Stern Pinball released James Bond and Food Fighters.

[06:48] And all you have is Legends of Bahá'u'lláh.

[06:51] As you watch toy store sales plummet, they've got James Bond out and Food

[06:56] Fighters. And where's your next game? And we know it's close.

[06:59] It's not that you guys are not close, but man,

[07:01] you got to stop getting lapped by Stern Pinball because this game,

[07:05] and I mean it, you can feel it in the trailer.

[07:08] This game is going to have some swagger.

[07:10] It's going to have some energy.

[07:12] I feel like the band was part of making this game.

[07:14] They're not going to be restricted like they were with James Bond.

[07:17] It's not going to be toy list like Toy Story 4.

[07:20] It's not going to be unrelatable like a tank battle in space.

[07:23] Think about it, everybody. Who amongst us wakes up and says,

[07:27] I can't wait to have a tank battle in outer space. OK.

[07:32] And I'm going to tell you right now,

[07:33] I spoke to a friend of mine who played freaking Galactic Tank Force.

[07:36] He played it and I'm not going to go into it in too much detail.

[07:40] But he said, look, there's two big tanks. You bash them.

[07:42] There's a scoop up the middle that fires the ball back at you.

[07:45] There's two ramps. There's two flippers.

[07:47] The animations were done by Josh Kugler and the team over there.

[07:51] They got rid of Josh Kugler.

[07:53] And we're going to see some of these like, you know,

[07:54] sort of not that great animations from American Pinball,

[07:57] the same style you saw with like Houdini and Oktoberfest.

[08:01] And I also heard that they hired live actors to record parts for the game.

[08:05] So we're going to see a mixture of like mediocre animations and live action

[08:09] going on in Galactic Tank Force.

[08:12] All of a sudden, my excitement for Galactic Tank Force

[08:15] is just declining every single day.

[08:18] And I mean it when I say it, David Fix and AP,

[08:21] you need to get my excitement back up.

[08:23] You need to win people's excitement.

[08:24] This trailer is probably one of Stern's greatest teasers to date.

[08:29] Most of their teasers don't have so much high energy

[08:32] and you can't sit on your hands.

[08:34] Jersey Jack, you can't just sit on your hands and wait for Texas Pinball Festival.

[08:38] And if it's Godfather, what are you waiting for?

[08:40] This is the problem with everybody else.

[08:42] They just got sucker punched.

[08:44] They don't have an answer.

[08:46] And they're just going to sit back and wait as Stern gets thousands of orders for this game.

[08:51] They're going to get a few thousand orders.

[08:53] For every single new game, they're going to bring people into the fold.

[08:56] I think Jack Danger is going to win people over.

[08:58] And it's crazy, like Foo Fighters, I think might end up being a surprise hit.

[09:02] And Galactic Tank Force, which we all think is going to be this Dennis Norman masterpiece,

[09:07] might actually, I'm starting to worry, might actually underwhelm us a little bit.

[09:11] And then there's just Godfather, which I can't see in a million years.

[09:15] How you're going to make this slow mafia drama nearly as exciting

[09:20] as a rock and roll pinball machine from Stern Pinball.

[09:22] That's going to land with zombie Eddie artwork.

[09:25] And his artwork is not just on the play field and the cabinet.

[09:28] His artwork is in the code itself.

[09:30] And even in that little trailer, I think this stuff is going to look awesome, like on the screen.

[09:35] And so there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, out of nowhere, Stern Pinball,

[09:39] sucker punches the competition.

[09:41] They get two games out when other companies are just sitting around waiting for their next game

[09:45] as their sales have declined.

[09:47] Stern Pinball is just going to clobber everybody.

[09:51] Canada is super excited.

[09:52] Happy Friday, everybody.

[09:54] And look, Don's going to have to follow this up.

[09:56] Don, you're going to have to get a show out now.

[09:58] This is how you get the Twippies.

[10:00] You hit first and you hit hard.

[10:01] And look, we can do this in just a little over 10 minutes.

[10:05] We don't need 90 minute analysis of what we just saw with the 30 second clip.

[10:09] What we need is energy from Canada.

[10:11] We need some positivity from the man in New York.

[10:14] We need some energy from the guy with the pink sunglasses on that can hype a game better

[10:18] than anybody in pinball.

[10:20] Everybody, have a great Friday.

[10:21] Can't wait to see Jack Danger's food fighter next week.

[10:24] Later.
