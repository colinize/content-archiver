[00:00] There ain't no gold in this river that I've been washed in my hands in forever.

[00:26] I know there is hope in these waters, but I can't bring myself to swim when I am drowning in this silence baby.

[00:43] Let me go easy, honey baby.

[00:53] I was still a child, didn't get the chance to feel the world around me.

[01:06] I had no time to choose what I chose to do so go easy on me.

[01:57] Go easy on me, baby.

[02:04] I was still a child, didn't get the chance to feel the world around me.

[02:18] I had no time to choose what I chose to do so go easy on me.

[25:46] I should've said all of that, she wasn't one and I'm really hungry

[25:51] It hurts whenever someone says her name

[25:54] When we were going overnight, I guess I really played a rhyme

[26:00] I should've never let her slip away

[26:03] So I'm such a loser, I never lose her

[26:09] Only I'm a stubborn out of my mind

[26:13] I'm a liar, a loser, I love to lose her

[26:18] I'll never recover unless we be fighting, I'm sorry

[35:38] In a small club of Minnesota

[35:40] And it snowed outside at first sight

[35:42] I just wanted my name in a star

[35:44] Now look where we at still growing

[35:47] Still growing up

[35:49] I'ma layin' my bandin' dream about what I become

[35:53] Can I quit to get on?

[35:55] Can I quit to be some?

[35:57] Now that I'm here

[35:59] Wishing I was still young

[36:01] But those good old days

[36:02] Always somebody would have told me that

[36:06] Some of these will be the good old days

[36:09] All the love you forget

[36:12] All these reckless nights you regret

[36:17] Someday soon your whole life's gonna change

[36:21] You're Mr. Magic, these good old days

[36:24] Wishing I didn't think I had the answers

[36:26] Wishing I didn't drink all the lab glass first

[36:29] Wishing I made it to homecoming

[36:31] Got up the curse to ask her

[36:32] Wishing I would have gotten out of my show

[36:34] Wishing I put the bottle back on that shelf

[36:36] Wishing I wouldn't have worried about

[36:37] What other people thought I felt comfortable with myself

[36:40] Move top open

[36:41] And the stars above

[36:43] Moment flows and sneakin' out and falling in love

[36:47] Me, you and I through time

[36:49] We just begun

[36:51] On the bright streamer

[36:53] Figuring out who I was

[36:55] Let's get on with it

[36:56] Always somebody would have told me that

[37:00] Some of these will be the good old days

[37:03] All the love you forget

[37:06] All these reckless nights you regret

[37:11] Someday soon your whole life's gonna change

[37:15] You're Mr. Magic, these good old days

[37:19] Never thought we'd get old

[37:21] Maybe we're still young

[37:23] Maybe you always look back

[37:25] And think it was better than it was

[37:27] Maybe these are the moments

[37:29] Maybe I've been missing with this about

[37:31] Been scared of the future

[37:32] Thinking about the past

[37:33] While missing out on that

[37:34] We've come so far

[37:36] I guess I'm frown

[37:38] And I worry about the wrinkles

[37:40] Where my smile

[37:42] I got some scars

[37:44] I better end

[37:46] I've got some pain and sin

[37:47] Some things where I'm here now

[37:50] Let's get on with it

[37:51] Always

[37:52] You don't know

[37:54] Always

[37:56] What you got

[37:58] Always

[38:00] Till it goes

[38:02] Till it's gone

[38:05] Oh, oh, oh, oh

[38:14] Oh, oh, oh, oh

[38:16] Till it goes

[38:18] Oh, oh, oh, oh

[38:20] Till it's gone

[38:34] You don't regret

[38:37] Someday soon your whole life's gonna change

[38:41] You're Mr. Magic

[38:43] And these good old days

[38:59] Some young blood things

[39:01] There's always tomorrow

[39:05] I miss your touch

[39:07] On nights when I'm hollow

[39:11] I know you're close to bridge

[39:13] That I can't follow

[39:17] Since the love that you left

[39:19] Is all that I get

[39:21] I want you to know

[39:23] That it's broken

[39:25] Be closed to you

[39:27] I settle for the ghost of you

[39:30] I miss you more than life

[39:34] And if you keep the next to me

[39:39] Your memories ecstasy

[39:43] I miss you more than life

[39:46] I miss you more than life

[39:49] Young blood things

[39:50] There's always tomorrow

[39:52] And need more time

[39:56] A time can't be borrowed

[39:58] I'd leave it all behind

[40:02] And if I can follow

[40:04] Since the love that you left

[40:08] Is all that I get

[40:10] I want you to know

[40:12] That it's broken

[40:14] Be closed to you

[40:16] I settle for the ghost of you

[40:20] I miss you more than life

[40:24] And if you keep the next to me

[40:30] Your memories ecstasy

[40:32] I miss you more than life

[40:36] I miss you more than life

[40:40] Oh, I'm running out

[40:46] Oh, I'm running out

[40:50] So if I can't get close to you

[40:54] I settle for the ghost of you

[40:58] I miss you more than life

[41:02] And if you keep the next to me

[41:07] Your memories ecstasy

[41:10] I miss you more than life

[41:13] I miss you more than life

[41:30] I call my drivers license last week

[41:33] Just like we always talked about

[41:36] Because you were so excited for me

[41:39] To finally drive up to your house

[41:42] But today I drove through the suburbs

[41:45] Crying because you were no around

[41:53] And you're probably with that blonde girl

[41:57] Who always made me tell her

[41:59] She's so much older than me

[42:02] She's everything I'm insecure about

[42:06] Yet today I drove through the suburbs

[42:10] Because how could I ever love someone else?

[42:16] And I know we weren't perfect

[42:19] But I've never felt this way for no one

[42:26] And I just can't imagine how you could be so gay

[42:32] Now that I'm gone

[42:36] Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in the song about me

[42:42] Because you said forever now I drive alone past your street

[42:50] And all my friends are tired

[42:53] If you're in how much I miss you

[42:56] But I kinda feel sorry for them

[42:59] Because they'll never know you the way that I do

[43:02] Yet today I drove through the suburbs

[43:06] And pictured I was driving home to you

[43:12] And I know we weren't perfect

[43:15] But I've never felt this way for no one

[43:21] And I just can't imagine how you could be so gay

[43:29] Now that I'm gone

[43:32] Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in the song about me

[43:39] Because you said forever now I drive alone past your street

[43:46] Where life stops us

[43:50] I still see your face in the white cards

[43:55] Can't drive past the places we used to go to

[44:02] Because I still fucking love you, babe

[44:13] Side-ups, weak-rocks

[44:16] I still hear your voice in the traffic we're laughing

[44:22] Over all the noise got them so blue no words

[44:29] But I still fucking love you, babe

[44:40] I know we weren't perfect

[44:42] But I've never felt this way for no one

[44:49] And I just can't imagine how you could be so gay

[44:55] Now that I'm gone

[44:59] Tell me something good

[45:04] Are you happy in this modern world

[45:09] Or do you need more?

[45:14] Is there something else you're searching for?

[45:19] Out for a little bit

[45:24] In all the good times I find myself along in

[45:30] For change

[45:34] And in the bad times I fear myself

[45:44] Tell me something, boy

[45:54] Aren't you tired trying to feel that, boy?

[45:59] Or do you need more?

[46:04] Ain't it hard keeping it so hard for

[46:08] I'm falling

[46:14] In all the good times I find myself along in

[46:19] For change

[46:23] And in the bad times I fear myself

[46:28] I'm of the deep bar

[46:31] Watches I dive in

[46:33] I'll never meet the ground

[46:38] Crashed through the soft glass

[46:41] Where they can't us

[46:43] We're far from the shallow now

[46:48] In the shallow

[46:53] In the shallow

[46:58] In the shallow

[47:03] We're far from the shallow now

[47:08] Or

[47:12] Or

[47:17] Or

[47:22] Or

[47:28] I'm of the deep bar

[47:31] Watches I dive in

[47:33] I never knew the ground

[47:38] Cracked so much when they could have

[47:43] But by the shadow now

[47:49] In the shadow

[47:53] In the shadow

[47:56] I love

[47:59] In the shadow

[48:03] We're far from the shadow now

[48:15] We should have been gone

[48:18] Knowing how I made you feel

[48:22] And I should have been gone

[48:25] After all your words will steal

[48:31] What must have been a dream house?

[48:34] Keep my girl

[48:36] And I must have been so rude and sad

[48:40] And we should have been older

[48:43] Oh, don't say

[48:46] Oh, don't

[48:51] Oh, don't

[48:54] Oh, don't say

[48:56] Oh, don't

[48:58] Oh, don't

[49:00] Oh, don't

[49:03] Oh, don't let go

[49:06] You will go

[49:08] Having me

[49:12] You'll be better on the loan

[49:16] I'm not who you are I'd be

[49:22] But you're coming to the fever

[49:24] To the fever

[49:26] Oh, don't you think I'm found no less?

[49:30] To the fever

[49:33] Oh, don't

[49:35] Oh, don't say

[49:37] Oh, don't

[49:41] Oh, don't

[49:44] Oh, don't say

[49:46] Oh, don't

[49:51] Oh, don't

[49:56] Hey, my respects to grace and virtue

[50:00] Send my condolences to good

[50:03] Give my regards to soul and romance

[50:07] They always did the best they could

[50:11] And so long to devotion

[50:14] You taught me everything I know

[50:17] Way to fight, wish me well

[50:22] You've gotta let me go

[50:27] Are we human?

[50:30] Or are we dancers?

[50:33] My side is vital

[50:37] My hands are cold

[50:39] And I'm all my enemies

[50:42] Looking for the answer

[50:46] Are we human?

[50:49] Or are we dancers?

[50:53] Will your sister be alright?

[50:57] When you dream upon tonight?

[51:01] There is no message where you're receiving

[51:05] Let me know when your heart's still beating

[51:09] Are we human?

[51:12] Or are we dancers?

[51:16] My side is vital

[51:19] My hands are cold

[51:22] And I'm all my enemies

[51:25] Looking for the answer

[51:35] You've gotta let me know

[51:37] Are we human?

[51:41] Or are we dancers?

[51:44] My side is vital

[51:47] My hands are cold

[51:50] And I'm all my enemies

[51:53] Looking for the answer

[51:57] Are we human?

[52:02] Or are we dancers?

[52:11] Are we human?

[52:23] Or are we dancers?

[52:30] Are we human?

[52:34] Or are we dancers?

[52:37] Are we human?

[52:41] Nothing seems to please me

[52:45] It all feels alright

[52:48] When I play into the night

[52:52] See me at you for time

[52:58] This place is understood

[53:01] Miss, no, it's so good

[53:04] It didn't slow me down

[53:08] Miss, taking a second guess

[53:12] It underestimated the comfort around

[53:19] Pretty, pretty please don't you ever feel

[53:23] Like you're last and fucking perfect

[53:29] Pretty, pretty please

[53:31] If you'll ever ever feel

[53:34] Like you're nothing

[53:36] You're fucking perfect

[53:39] To me, you're so mean

[53:43] To me, when you talk

[53:46] About yourself, you're wrong

[53:52] Change the voices in your head

[53:57] Makes them like you instead

[54:02] So complicated, look how we are making

[54:07] Feel so much hatred, such a fly again

[54:13] It's enough, I've done all I can think

[54:17] Of chasing home and demons

[54:20] I've seen you do the same

[54:24] Pretty, pretty please don't you ever ever feel

[54:28] Like you're last and fucking perfect

[54:34] Pretty, pretty please if you'll ever ever feel

[54:39] Like you're nothing

[54:42] You're fucking perfect

[54:44] To me, the whole world scared so I swallowed a feel

[54:47] The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer

[54:50] So cool in line and we try, try, try

[54:53] To us always the mind time done

[54:55] Looking for the critics because they everywhere

[54:57] They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair

[55:00] Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time

[55:03] Why do we do that? Why do I do that?

[55:06] Why do I do that?

[55:08] Yeah!

[55:13] Oh! I've been pretty, pretty please

[55:19] Pretty, pretty please don't you ever ever feel

[55:23] Like you're last and fucking perfect

[55:28] Pretty, pretty please don't you ever ever feel

[55:32] Like you're last and fucking perfect

[55:45] And he buried deep

[55:47] Six feet on the screen

[55:49] But no one seems to hear a thing

[55:51] Do you know that there's still a chance for you?

[55:55] Because there's a spark in you

[55:57] You just gotta ignite the light

[56:02] And let it shine

[56:06] Just on the night

[56:09] Like the fire that's left in the light

[56:49] Your original

[56:51] Cannot be replaced

[56:53] If you only knew

[56:55] What the future holds

[56:57] After a hurricane

[56:59] Comes a rainbow

[57:01] Maybe a reason why

[57:03] All the doors are closed

[57:05] So you could open one the leads

[02:09:42] Oh, I'm having so much fun

[02:09:44] Well, Bobby, we're just getting started

[02:09:46] Oh, I love you, Kim

[02:09:56] When I get to the bottom of that I sink

[02:10:02] Seems like nothing I said

[02:10:06] Ever meant anything

[02:10:08] But I have none of my head

[02:10:12] Thought I made a stand

[02:10:14] Only made a scene

[02:10:16] There's no feast for the underfed

[02:10:20] All the unknown tired are dead

[02:10:24] Showing up in my dreams

[02:10:26] They stand at the end of my bed

[02:10:30] Have I ever really held

[02:10:32] Anybody but myself

[02:10:36] To believe in the power of songs

[02:10:38] To believe in the power of girls

[02:10:42] Though the point we're making is gone

[02:10:44] Played stripped down to my thong

[02:10:48] I'll shut up and carry on

[02:10:50] The scream becomes a yon

[02:10:52] I'll shut up and carry on

[02:10:56] The scream becomes a yon

[02:11:00] I'll shut up and carry on

[02:11:02] The scream becomes a yon

[02:11:06] I'll shut up and carry on

[02:11:10] The screaming comes a yon

[02:11:12] I'll shut up and carry on

[02:11:14] the screaming comes a yon

[02:11:18] I'll shut up and carry on

[02:11:20] The scream comes again, our parents' stars and sons

[02:11:26] Believed in the power of songs, what if those days were gone?

[02:11:32] My memory is strong and he won't not die this dead

[02:11:38] Baby, it won't be long, so shut up and carry on

[02:11:44] The scream becomes young, I've shared the getting away

[02:11:50] The scream becomes young, I've shared the getting away

[02:11:56] The scream becomes young, I've shared getting away

[02:12:02] The scream becomes young, I've shared the getting away

[02:12:08] The scream becomes young, baby...

[02:12:13] You are, baby, wherever you do

[02:12:18] Fast to the nifty, the time stack is on

[02:12:24] See the marketplace and old Algiers

[02:12:31] Send me photographs and souvenirs

[02:12:38] Just remember when a dream appears

[02:12:45] You belong to me

[02:12:57] I walked through the door with you

[02:13:00] The air was cold

[02:13:02] But something about it felt like home

[02:13:05] Somehow I'm died

[02:13:08] Left in my scarf there

[02:13:10] At your sister's house

[02:13:12] And you still got it

[02:13:15] In your drawer, even now

[02:13:28] Oh, your sweet disposition

[02:13:30] And my wide-eyed gaze

[02:13:33] We're singing in the car getting lost

[02:13:37] Up and stay

[02:13:39] Autumn leaves falling down like

[02:13:41] Pieces into place

[02:13:43] And I can picture it

[02:13:46] After all these days

[02:13:49] And I know it's long gone

[02:13:51] And that magic's not here no more

[02:13:54] And I might be okay

[02:13:56] But I'm not finding a

[02:13:59] Oh

[02:14:04] Cause there we are again

[02:14:06] On that little town street

[02:14:10] You're almost in the red

[02:14:11] Cause you were looking over at me

[02:14:14] Wind in my hair

[02:14:15] I was there

[02:14:16] I remember it all too well

[02:14:24] So I went on the counter

[02:14:28] Your cheeks were turning red

[02:14:30] You used to be a little kid with glasses

[02:14:32] And it's when I was last bed

[02:14:35] And your mother's telling stories

[02:14:37] About you on the tea ball team

[02:14:40] You told me about your past

[02:14:42] Thinking you've used to choose me

[02:14:45] And you were tossing me the car keys

[02:14:48] But the patriarchy

[02:14:50] Keaching on the ground

[02:14:52] We were always skipping town

[02:14:55] And I was thinking on the drive down

[02:14:58] Anytime now

[02:15:00] He's gonna say it's a love

[02:15:02] You never called it what it was

[02:15:05] Till we were dead and gone

[02:15:08] And buried check the pulse

[02:15:09] And come back swearing it's the same

[02:15:13] After three months in the grave

[02:15:16] And then you wondered

[02:15:17] Where it went too

[02:15:19] As I reached for you

[02:15:20] But all I felt was shame

[02:15:23] And you held my life this frame

[02:15:26] And I know it's forgotten

[02:15:29] There was nothing else I could do

[02:15:32] And I forget about you long enough

[02:15:34] To forget who I needed

[02:15:37] To

[02:15:42] Cause till we are again

[02:15:44] In the middle of the night

[02:15:48] We're dancing around the kitchen

[02:15:49] In the refrigerator light

[02:15:52] Down the stairs I was there

[02:15:54] I remember it all too well

[02:16:03] And then we are again

[02:16:05] When nobody had to know

[02:16:08] You kept me like a secret

[02:16:10] But I kept you like an old secret prayer

[02:16:14] And we swear to remember it all too well

[02:16:22] Yeah

[02:16:38] Maybe we got lost in translation

[02:16:41] Maybe I asked for too much

[02:16:43] But maybe this thing was a masterpiece

[02:16:47] Till you tore it all up

[02:16:49] Running scared I was there

[02:16:51] I remember it all too well

[02:16:59] And you come here

[02:17:01] Forget just to break me like a promise

[02:17:05] So casually cruel in the name of being

[02:17:09] All this time and crumbled up

[02:17:11] Piece of paper lying here

[02:17:14] Cause I remember it all

[02:17:16] Oh

[02:17:20] They say all's well live and swell

[02:17:23] But I'm in the new hell every time

[02:17:27] You double crossed my mind

[02:17:30] You said if we had been closer

[02:17:33] And age maybe it would have been fine

[02:17:38] And that baby once could die

[02:17:41] The idea you had of me who was she

[02:17:44] And never needy ever lovely jewel

[02:17:47] Cause shine reflects on you

[02:17:51] Not we've been in a party bathroom

[02:17:54] Some actress asking me what happened

[02:17:57] You that's what happened

[02:17:59] You

[02:18:01] You who charmed my dad

[02:18:04] With self-effacing jokes

[02:18:07] Sip and coffee like you're on a late night show

[02:18:11] But then he watched me watch the front door

[02:18:14] All night willing you to come

[02:18:17] And he said it's supposed to be fun

[02:18:20] Turned in 21

[02:18:35] Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it

[02:18:40] I'd like to be my old self again

[02:18:43] But I'm still trying to find it

[02:18:45] After a pleasure days

[02:18:47] And that's when you made me your own

[02:18:51] Now you mail back my things

[02:18:53] And I walk home alone

[02:18:56] But you keep my old scarf

[02:18:58] From that very first week

[02:19:01] Cause it reminds you of innocence

[02:19:03] And it smells like me

[02:19:06] You can't get rid of it

[02:19:08] Cause you remember it all too well

[02:19:16] Cause the way I began when I loved you so

[02:19:22] Back before you lost

[02:19:24] The one real thing you've ever known

[02:19:26] It was rare

[02:19:27] How is there

[02:19:29] How you remember it all too well

[02:19:36] When in my hair you were there

[02:19:39] You remember it all down the stairs

[02:19:43] You were there

[02:19:44] You remember it all

[02:19:47] It was rare

[02:19:48] I was there

[02:19:49] I remember it all too well

[02:19:56] And I was never good at telling jokes

[02:20:00] But the punchline goes

[02:20:02] I'll get older but your lovers

[02:20:05] Stay my age

[02:20:07] From when you're Brooklyn

[02:20:10] Boke my skin and bones

[02:20:12] I'm a soldier who's returning

[02:20:16] Half her weight

[02:20:18] And did the twins' leg

[02:20:20] Blues paint you blue

[02:20:23] Just between

[02:20:24] I stood the love of fair-made mew too

[02:20:28] Cause in the cities

[02:20:30] Baron called

[02:20:32] I still remember the first

[02:20:35] Fall of snow

[02:20:37] And how it glistened as it fell

[02:20:42] I remember it all too well

[02:20:49] Just between

[02:20:50] I stood the love of fair-made mew

[02:20:53] All too well

[02:20:59] Just between

[02:21:00] I stood you

[02:21:02] Remember it all too

[02:21:05] Well

[02:21:09] Just between

[02:21:11] I stood

[02:21:13] All too well

[02:21:17] Just between

[02:21:19] I stood

[02:21:21] Down the stairs

[02:21:23] I stood

[02:21:25] See the friend

[02:21:27] I stood

[02:21:29] It was rare

[02:21:33] Remember it all too

[02:21:36] Well

[02:21:37] Just between

[02:21:38] I stood

[02:21:39] Down the stairs

[02:21:41] Down the stairs

[02:21:43] Down the stairs

[02:21:45] See the friend

[02:21:48] I stood

[02:21:49] Down the stairs

[02:21:51] It was rare

[02:21:53] You were my poor head

[02:21:55] To

[02:21:56] And

[02:21:57] I stood

[02:21:59] Down the stairs

[02:22:01] Down the stairs

[02:22:03] Down the stairs

[02:22:05] Down the stairs

[02:22:07] Down the stairs

[02:22:09] Down the stairs

[02:22:11] Down the stairs

[02:22:13] Down the stairs

[02:22:15] For all the times that you're in a mappery

[02:22:19] In all the clubs you get in using my name

[02:22:23] You think you broke my heart

[02:22:25] Oh girl, forget this

[02:22:27] You think I'm crying

[02:22:29] Oh my oh well, I ain't

[02:22:31] And I didn't want to write a song

[02:22:33] Cause I didn't want anyone thinking

[02:22:35] I still care

[02:22:39] I don't but you still hit my phone up

[02:22:43] And baby I'll be moving on

[02:22:45] And I think it should be

[02:22:47] Something I don't want to hold back

[02:22:49] Maybe you should know

[02:22:51] That my mama don't like you

[02:22:53] And she likes everyone

[02:22:55] And I never lied to admit that I was wrong

[02:22:59] And I've been so caught up in my job

[02:23:03] Didn't see what's going on

[02:23:07] But now I know

[02:23:09] I'm better sleeping

[02:23:11] No more hell

[02:23:13] Cause if you like the way

[02:23:35] The only problem was with you

[02:23:39] And I found

[02:23:41] And every time you told me

[02:23:43] My opinion was wrong

[02:23:45] And try to make me forget

[02:23:47] Where I came from

[02:23:49] And I didn't want to write a song

[02:23:53] Cause I didn't want anyone thinking

[02:25:11] I fell in love now

[02:25:13] I feel nothing at all

[02:25:15] And I never felt so far

[02:25:19] When I was wrong no

[02:25:21] Was I a fool to let you break down my walls

[02:25:25] Cause if you like the way

[02:56:31] She rides with me, the new Bobby

[02:56:33] We don't speak as though it's sex in the city she gets

[02:56:35] Carey fever, the sooner the show's over

[02:56:37] She's right back to being my soldier

[02:56:39] Cause my knees are right up and I'm a roller

[02:56:42] Put us together, how'd it go, stop all of us

[02:56:44] Whatever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder

[02:56:47] When I'm off track, mommy is keeping me focused

[02:56:49] So less, like this, now like it's supposed to be

[02:56:52] The old three, born in Clyde, whole in beat

[02:56:55] Power

[02:57:03] So less, like the world on fire

[02:57:07] We're the right up and I'm sorry

[02:57:15] Tonight

[02:57:17] I'm worried, worried, worried, worried

[02:57:19] I am

[02:57:21] I can't help but

[02:57:23] I'm worried, I can't help but

[02:57:25] Tonight

[02:57:27] I'm worried, worried, worried, worried

[02:57:29] We are

[02:57:32] I can not go, I can not go to nobody yet

[02:57:35] If I was your kid, you felt that never let you go

[02:57:38] I could take a case as soon as you would never do before

[02:57:40] Baby, take a chance, say you're never perfect

[02:57:42] No, I got money in my hands that I really like to go

[02:57:45] So I, so I, so I, I'm gone

[02:57:47] You, tell him by the fire

[02:57:49] What we eat, what you far and do, I know

[02:57:51] I'm, build a fire and gather around the tree

[02:57:56] Fill a glass and maybe come and say with me

[02:58:21] So kiss me under the mistletoe

[02:58:24] Grab the wine, let's toast and pray for the summer snow

[02:58:28] Know there's been painless year but it's time to let it go

[02:58:32] Next year you never know

[02:58:34] But for now, maybe Christmas will

[02:58:38] That's enough, kid, you all I must go

[02:58:41] We both don't love, but this love we got is the best of all

[02:58:45] I wish you could see it through my eyes

[02:58:48] But you would know, my God, you look beautiful

[02:58:52] Right now, Mary Christmas

[02:58:57] She said I don't spend time like I really should

[02:59:02] She said she don't know me

[02:59:06] Anymore, I think she hates me deep down

[02:59:10] I know she does

[02:59:12] She wants to erase me

[02:59:17] A couple days no talking

[02:59:21] I see my baby and this was she tells me

[02:59:26] She said I keep on running

[02:59:29] Keep on running and I think

[02:59:32] Rose, I can't get away from

[02:59:37] Now, I keep on talking

[02:59:40] Keep on talking and I think

[02:59:43] Now, I can stop this and leave

[02:59:45] Oh yeah

[02:59:46] It's like a moon tonight

[02:59:51] Messing a cable

[02:59:54] It makes me feel a bit complete

[02:59:57] Yeah, knowing someone you love

[03:00:01] Don't feel the same way about you

[03:00:04] Memories they soon delete

[03:00:09] A couple weeks no talking

[03:00:12] I see my baby

[03:00:14] I miss this out there much

[03:00:18] Hey, I wish we could start over

[03:00:23] I told my baby

[03:00:25] This what this tells me

[03:00:28] She said I keep on running

[03:00:31] Keep on running and I think

[03:00:34] Rose, I can't get away from

[03:00:39] Now, I keep on talking

[03:00:42] Keep on talking and you know

[03:00:44] Then, I can stop this and leave

[03:00:48] Yeah, I come from the magazines

[03:00:51] On TV

[03:00:52] The matter where you are

[03:00:53] You might hear me

[03:00:55] I'm in the magazines

[03:00:56] On TV

[03:00:57] The matter where you have to hold your mind

[03:01:07] Holding me by

[03:01:09] Grabbing me

[03:01:10] Holding me by

[03:01:12] I want you to hold out the palm of your hand

[03:01:15] Why don't we leave it out

[03:01:18] Nothing to say

[03:01:20] When everything gets in the way

[03:01:23] Seems you cannot be replaced

[03:01:26] And I'm the one who's staying

[03:01:28] Oh

[03:01:31] In this world

[03:01:34] It's just us

[03:01:37] You know it's not the same as it was

[03:02:05] Harry, you know good long

[03:02:07] Why are you sitting at the top of your foot

[03:02:10] What kind of the pills do you want

[03:02:14] Ring in the bell

[03:02:15] And nobody's coming to help

[03:02:18] Your diving is worth the same

[03:02:21] It just wants to know that you're well

[03:02:23] Oh

[03:02:26] In this world

[03:02:29] It's just us

[03:02:33] You know it's not the same as it was

[03:02:37] In this world

[03:02:40] It's just us

[03:02:44] You know it's not the same as it was

[03:02:49] As it was

[03:03:03] To leave all the marina

[03:03:05] To this

[03:03:06] I don't want to talk about it

[03:29:27] The kind of man you want in here

[03:29:30] Only ten can I begin a year again

[03:29:34] An empty share, I used to be

[03:29:38] The shadow all my life was I could over me

[03:29:41] You broke a man that I don't know

[03:29:45] Won't even stand the damnest dance to be my soul

[03:29:48] Why were chewing, why were chasing, why the bottom?

[03:29:51] Why the beast man, why we got good shit in race?

[03:29:53] And why do you feel so dirty to replace man?

[03:29:55] You do wrong weight, drugs run again

[03:29:57] But when I'm in a feature town, why we can't be at the end?

[03:31:03] I'm begging you

[03:31:05] Oh, the love of love

[03:31:07] And now, baby

[03:31:09] Where the light's gone

[03:31:11] It's the day that's

[03:31:13] You and I are now

[03:31:15] In the darkness

[03:31:17] I'm disturbing

[03:31:19] In the shadows

[03:31:21] You and I are now

[03:31:23] In the shadows

[03:31:25] I'm the shadow

[03:31:27] I'm the final

[03:31:29] I'm a hero

[03:31:31] I'm the hero

[03:31:33] Yeah

[03:31:53] Oh

[03:32:09] She's got a smile that seems to me

[03:32:13] Reminds me of childhood

[03:32:15] Memories where everything

[03:32:18] Was precious, the bright blue sky

[03:32:22] Now in them when I see your face

[03:32:28] It takes me way to confess

[03:32:30] Your face and if I stay too long

[03:32:34] I'll probably break down and cry

[03:32:38] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[03:32:42] Sweet child of mine

[03:32:44] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, in the prime

[03:32:52] She got eyes of the blue skies, had give faith on the rain.

[03:33:18] I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of rain.

[03:33:26] Forever must be over once, any place where as a child I'd hide,

[03:33:33] and pray for the thunder and the rain, who'd widening fastly by light.

[03:33:41] Oh, once we judge by it, oh, once we're on the line.

[03:33:57] I have this thing where I get older, but just ever wiser,

[03:34:02] midnight's become my afternoons.

[03:34:07] When my depression works, the graveyard shift all over the people.

[03:34:12] I've ghosted stand there in the room.

[03:34:16] I should not be left to my own devices,

[03:34:20] they come with prices and prices, I end up in crisis.

[03:34:25] I wake up screaming from dreaming one day,

[03:34:30] I'll watch as you leave, and kiss you, got tired of my scheming.

[03:34:35] It's me, I'm the problem, it's me, at tea time.

[03:34:44] Everybody agrees, I'll stare directly at the sun,

[03:34:49] but never in the mirror, it must be exhausting,

[03:34:53] always moving for the anti-hero.

[03:35:01] Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby,

[03:35:06] and I'm a monster on the hill.

[03:35:11] Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city,

[03:35:16] pierced through the heart that never killed.

[03:35:21] Did you hear Michael Ferdinard's siss,

[03:35:24] some like disguises, altruism,

[03:35:27] like some kind of consciousness, or the sun?

[03:35:31] I wake up screaming from dreaming one day,

[03:35:34] I'll watch as you leave, and if life will lose all,

[03:35:38] it's me, I'm the problem, it's me, at tea time.

[03:35:48] Everybody agrees, I'll stare directly at the sun,

[03:35:53] but never in the mirror, it must be exhausting,

[03:35:57] always moving for the anti-hero.

[03:36:06] I have the stream, my daughter-in-law kills me for the money.

[03:36:10] She thinks I left them in the will.

[03:36:16] The family gathers around and reads it,

[03:36:19] and then someone screams out,

[03:36:21] she's laughing up in it from hell.

[03:36:25] It's me, I'm the problem, it's me, it's me,

[03:36:31] I'm the problem, it's me, it's me,

[03:36:36] I, everybody agrees, everybody agrees.

[03:36:44] It's me, I'm the problem, it's me,

[03:36:49] I'm the problem, it's me, at tea time.

[03:36:52] Everybody agrees, everybody agrees,

[03:36:55] I'll stare directly at the sun,

[03:36:57] but never in the mirror, it must be exhausting,

[03:37:01] always moving for the anti-hero.

[03:37:15] It doesn't hurt me, yeah, yeah,

[03:37:26] you want to feel, oh, how it feels, yeah, yeah,

[03:38:28] on the way, and cherry, you want to start now, yeah, yeah,

[03:38:46] you, it's you and me,

[03:38:52] you, it's you and me,

[03:39:01] and make a deal with God,

[03:39:03] and I get him just one,

[03:39:05] the least says, be running on that road,

[03:39:48] and I get him just one,

[03:39:53] the least says, be running on that hill,

[03:39:57] come, come, darling, let's exchange the experience,

[03:40:20] you're running on that hill,

[03:40:22] and make a deal with God,

[03:40:24] and I get him just one,

[03:40:26] the least says, be running on that road,

[03:40:30] be running on that hill, be running on that hill,

[03:40:54] what?

[03:40:57] Music

[03:41:22] There were nights when the wind was so cold

[03:41:27] But my body frozen, made if I'd just

[03:41:31] sniss into it right outside the window.

[03:41:38] There were days when the sun was so cool.

[03:41:44] At all the tears turned to dust,

[03:41:46] then I just knew my eyes were dragging out forever.

[03:41:51] I finished crying in the instant that you left.

[03:41:56] Then I can't remember where I went.

[03:42:01] And I've vanished every memory you and I had ever made.

[03:42:14] When you touch me like this,

[03:42:17] and you hold me like that,

[03:42:21] I just have to admit that it's all coming back to me.

[03:42:27] When I touch you like this, and I hold you like that,

[03:42:33] it's all hard to believe, but it's all coming back to me.

[03:42:40] It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now.

[03:42:46] There were moments so cold and there were flashes of light.

[03:42:51] There were things I'd never do again, but then they'd always seem to write.

[03:42:56] There were nights of endless pleasure,

[03:42:59] it was more than any loss in love.

[03:43:06] Baby, baby, if I kiss you like this,

[03:43:11] then the fewest part like that,

[03:43:14] it was lost along and gone, but it's all coming back to me.

[03:43:20] If you want me like this, then the few need me like that.

[03:43:25] It was that along and gone, but it's all coming back to me.

[03:43:31] It's all hard to resist, and it's all coming back to me.

[03:43:36] I can barely recall what it's all coming back to me now.

[03:43:50] What it's all coming back?

[03:43:54] There were those empty parts in our long lives.

[03:44:09] And whenever you try to hurt me, I just hurt you even worse than so much deeper.

[03:44:21] There were hours that just when I fought days,

[03:44:26] when long at last we'd come up all the chances that will last you less forever.

[03:44:37] But you were history with the slamming cough to the door,

[03:44:42] and I made myself so strong against a wild,

[03:44:47] and I never wasted any of my time of using faith.

[03:44:58] But if I touch you like this, then the few kiss me like that.

[03:45:05] It was so long and gone, but it's all coming back to me.

[03:45:12] If you touch me like this, then the few kiss you like that.

[03:45:17] It was gone with the wind, but it's all coming back to me.

[03:45:23] It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now.

[03:45:29] There were moments on goal, and there were flashes of light.

[03:45:34] There were things we can never do again, but then they'd always seem to ride.

[03:45:40] There were nights of endless pleasure,

[03:45:42] it was small then on your loss alone.

[03:45:48] Baby, baby, baby, let me touch you like this.

[03:45:54] And when you hold me like that,

[03:45:57] it was gone with the wind, but it's all coming back to me.

[03:46:02] When you see me like this, and when I see you like that,

[03:46:08] then we still walk, we want to see you all coming back to me.

[03:46:13] The flesh and the fat just sees you all coming back to me.

[03:46:18] I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now.

[03:46:38] The yesterday small town girl,

[03:46:43] living in a lonely world,

[03:46:47] he took the midnight train going anywhere.

[03:46:54] He just a city boy,

[03:46:59] born in racing, soft and shrugged.

[03:47:05] He took the midnight train going anywhere.

[03:47:29] I sing a inner smokey room.

[03:47:33] I smell a wine and sheep a few.

[03:47:37] For a small day can share the night,

[03:47:40] it goes on and on and on and on.

[03:47:44] The strangers waiting,

[03:47:49] whipping down the pool about their shadows,

[03:47:54] searching in the night.

[03:48:00] See lights, deeper,

[03:48:05] living as the final moon sun,

[03:48:09] hiding somewhere in the night.

[03:48:17] I sing a inner smokey room.

[03:48:24] I smell a wine and sheep a few.

[03:48:32] I smell a wine and sheep a few.

[03:48:38] I feel like I was born in racing.

[03:48:46] All the things that move

[03:48:49] All the things that move

[03:48:52] You're going on and on and on

[03:48:55] Strangest waiting

[03:49:00] Up in the pool of all their shadows

[03:49:06] Sat in the night

[03:49:11] Sweet lights, people

[03:49:16] There's the fun in the sun

[03:49:20] Hiding somewhere in the night

[03:49:40] Don't stop believing

[03:49:47] Hold on to that feeling

[03:49:52] Strangest waiting

[03:49:54] Up in the pool

[03:49:59] Don't stop believing

[03:50:04] Hold on to that feeling

[03:50:07] Still light, people

[03:50:12] Don't stop believing

[03:50:19] Hold on to that feeling

[03:50:34] Don't keep away

[03:50:41] I don't know what I'm to say I'm sad anyway

[03:50:46] Today is a mild day to find you

[03:50:49] Shine away

[03:50:52] All the things that move

[03:51:02] You're going on and on and on

[03:51:10] Take me on and on and on

[03:51:17] Take me on and on and on

[03:51:25] So needless to say

[03:51:29] I'm all to say it

[03:51:31] It's about me

[03:51:32] Stunned a little bit

[03:51:34] Stunned a little bit

[03:51:36] But violence is okay

[03:51:38] Say I'm for me

[03:51:41] At least I've been it to save the sun

[03:51:44] Take me on and on

[03:51:48] Take me on and on

[03:51:54] I'll be gone

[03:52:19] Why do I bother?

[03:52:20] When you're not the one for me

[03:52:23] Is it nothing?

[03:52:28] I'm all the time

[03:52:31] Open up my eyes

[03:52:33] That's all the time

[03:52:34] Life is still melting

[03:52:40] Open up my eyes

[03:52:42] That's all the time

[03:52:44] No one's going to drag you up

[03:52:45] To get into the life

[03:52:47] For you to know

[03:52:49] But I'm glad to leave alone

[03:53:01] Under the pale moon

[03:53:03] For so many years I've wanted

[03:53:05] Who you are

[03:53:06] I'll put a passion

[03:53:08] Like you, bring me joy

[03:53:11] Under the pale moon

[03:53:13] Where I see a lot of stars

[03:53:19] And I'm all the time

[03:53:22] Open up my eyes

[03:53:24] That's all the time

[03:55:14] It's time that I think you go

[03:55:17] I turn around and you're creeping in

[03:55:19] And I'll let you know my skin

[03:55:21] Cause I don't live in the sin

[03:55:24] But you know it's only me

[03:55:26] True love was growing up

[03:56:13] I see how too late

[03:56:16] Got nothing in my brain

[03:56:19] Those who people say

[03:56:22] Those who people say

[03:56:24] I go on too many days

[03:56:28] But I can't make them stay

[03:56:30] At least those who people say

[03:56:51] That's what I can't call him sin

[03:56:52] Can't stop on the stop moving

[03:56:54] It's like I got this music

[03:56:56] In my mind saying

[03:56:58] It's gonna be all right

[03:57:00] Cause the players are gonna play

[03:57:02] Play, play, play

[03:57:03] And my hands are gonna hate

[03:57:16] I'm lighting on my feet

[03:57:19] And that's what they don't see

[03:57:22] That's what they don't see

[03:57:25] I'm dancing on my own, dancing on my own

[03:57:28] Make the moves that they go

[03:57:30] And that's what they don't know

[03:57:34] That's what they don't know

[03:57:36] But I keep pushing

[03:57:39] Can't stop on the stop moving

[03:57:42] It's like I got this music

[03:57:45] In my mind saying

[03:58:41] I let you push me past the breaking point

[03:58:43] I stood for nothing

[03:58:45] So I felt for everything

[03:58:47] You held me down

[03:58:49] But I got out

[03:58:51] Already pushing off the dust

[03:58:55] Hear that sound

[03:58:57] Like thunder gonna shake the road

[03:58:59] You held me down

[03:59:15] Because I am the champion

[03:59:17] And you're gonna hear me roar

[04:00:21] Dance through the fire

[04:00:23] Because I am the champion

[04:00:25] And you're gonna hear me roar

[04:00:27] All alone

[04:00:29] Out of the line
