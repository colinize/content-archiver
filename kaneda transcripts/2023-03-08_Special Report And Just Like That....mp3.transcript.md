[00:00] And just like that ladies and gentlemen, Canada's encouragement to wait and see enough of a game

[00:15] before you order and we're seeing it right now and look it is still way too early to

[00:20] say that Godfather is going to be great or bad or a rainbow puke game or like stay true

[00:26] to the original film but I want everybody right now to remember why I'm encouraging you to

[00:32] wait and play a game before you spend your hard earned money on these pinball machines

[00:38] because I am so tired of this like selective showcasing of just enough of the game to take

[00:46] the money from us but not enough of the game to really feel like we've seen the game, we've

[00:51] seen it played, we see how it all comes together and now everybody collectively is shoulder shrugging

[00:58] and let out a big fat mafia sigh as we see this gameplay footage from Great American Pinball in

[01:06] which the Godfather pinball machine looks like it's using music that's from The Wizard of Oz and

[01:12] Toy Story 4. It sounds more like a carnival and a slot machine than the iconic movie that was made

[01:19] 50 years ago. Not only that, Godfather is a dark R rated movie and now this game is lit up like a

[01:28] Christmas tree. On top of a Christmas tree, it is the ultimate rainbow light show like more so than

[01:35] any other Jersey Jack game before it and none of it works if Godfather is the theme and I almost

[01:42] feel like we're getting bullied right that we're not allowed to not like something anymore in pinball

[01:47] at these prices. I saw the artist our friend Mr. Christopher Franci, he's celebrating the fact

[01:52] that he worked on this game and you know saying stuff like everybody be happy it's pinball you

[01:56] know it's a fragile industry well why do we have to be so happy? I would be really happy if you made

[02:03] games based on themes people love. I would be really happy if those themes were integrated in the right

[02:09] way. I would be really happy with more games like Foo Fighters and maybe Ghostbusters that Shotwell

[02:15] and Jurassic Park and games like Godzilla and games like Guns N' Roses and for those of you out

[02:21] there who say I'm rooting against Jersey Jack pinball let me remind you I only own right now in

[02:27] my possession one pinball machine on planet earth it is an Eric Minier game and it is Guns N' Roses

[02:34] so I am not rooting against Jersey Jack but if I'm gonna have this podcast and I'm gonna talk to

[02:40] you candidly about how I feel about every new game that comes out I'm not gonna hold back punches

[02:45] and that's why you're here right now and I just want to tell you right now I think we are at a

[02:49] point in this community where we need to stop with the shenanigans the shenanigans are this

[02:54] it's making strategic videos that do not show you enough information and then asking you to buy the

[03:00] game the same day I mean look we all know that when straight down the middle went to see this game

[03:06] Greg and Zach are really smart guys they know a lot about pinball they've seen a lot of pinball

[03:11] machines they walked into that room just like you and I are watching the stream right now and they

[03:16] saw the rainbow explosion and they saw the music that sounds like it's coming from a Willy Wonka

[03:22] freaking Wizard of Oz had a baby slot machine it's like welcome to the wonderful Wizard of Godfather

[03:27] and they saw all that and they heard the music and they heard the callouts and they saw the light

[03:32] show and so what did they do did they show us that did they film that no they selectively put

[03:39] together their video to show this game in the best light and look I don't blame them

[03:44] their distributors but for those of you out there who saw that video and thought you saw enough to

[03:50] pull a trigger on a game you didn't even want in the first place and now you're seeing this I just

[03:56] want to remind you this is why I'm telling you wait and see I'm not telling you don't buy the game

[04:02] I'm not telling you to boycott Jersey Jack pinball I'm not telling you Eric Minier's multi-ball heavy

[04:07] even though I'm getting scared he's starting to look very multi-ball heavy and we need to work

[04:12] for those multi-balls Eric when is his feedback going to actually reach Jersey Jack pinball and

[04:17] I mean it when I say it don't point any arrows at me the only person that can sink Jersey Jack pinball

[04:24] is Jersey Jack pinball itself the only people to blame if these games don't sell is Jersey Jack

[04:31] itself they have the time they have the resources they have the talent they have the millions of

[04:37] dollars making these things I don't I have no say what goes into these games and I'm not controlling

[04:42] what you do with your money again I am not telling you don't buy the game what I am telling you is

[04:48] anyone who bought the game yesterday and locked themselves into a non-refundable deposit how

[04:54] do you feel right now after seeing that stream shouldn't you have just waited another day

[04:58] why did you impatiently run towards the game there's no FOMO and now the bitter reality is sinking

[05:03] in after this stream if this game turns out to be like this you know like a godfather version of

[05:10] freaking Toy Story 4 guess what's gonna happen everyone who ordered already is gonna be locked in

[05:17] a lot of new orders are not gonna flood in and then all of a sudden we're gonna see games sell

[05:22] for below what Jersey Jack wants to sell them for we saw it with Toy Story we might be witnessing

[05:28] it all over again and I'm getting exhausted I'll tell you why I'm getting exhausted because we need

[05:33] to move past this period we need to get past this for this much money we need to get more of a test

[05:39] drive of the game before they ask for our money and here's the good news like I said the balls in

[05:44] our court the moment you don't buy the moment you don't run to this stuff the moment you don't turn

[05:49] into my friend Brill Brand is saying everyone's buying the game they're selling a ton everybody I

[05:54] spoke to is getting one okay everyone you spoke to and he already said to me after seeing the gameplay

[05:59] I bought one and I had to remind Bill because he's a very smart man he's got a lot more money than me

[06:03] he's got faster cars than me nicer houses I said to Bill you didn't see the gameplay you saw a highly

[06:10] edited cherry picked video that only showed you the stuff they thought would make you want to buy it

[06:17] they didn't show you anything they knew would make you be a little bit concerned about the game

[06:21] and now everyone is seeing stuff that is a little bit concerning I'm not gonna lie it's a lot of

[06:26] bit concerning this isn't the godfather if you can turn on every single light at once it doesn't

[06:32] mean you should and I don't know why jack is making these games as if they're like constantly in a

[06:37] track mode like you're trying to lure people in from like down the block on a new jersey boardwalk

[06:43] arcade these things are going into people's homes orchestrating a game's light show is very important

[06:51] it sets the mood of the film just imagine this imagine a dramatic scene during the godfather

[06:56] movie in which this rainbow Skittles light show just goes off in the middle of the scene and that is

[07:02] what's happening in this game you can't bring people in to the mood you can't create a moment if this

[07:08] is how you're gonna handle the lights in the game it worked really well for guns and roses it was

[07:14] done very strategically and the lights synced up with the songs in the game and then you get to

[07:20] toy story it's just everything louder than everything else light up everything all the time

[07:25] nothing feels special and that's just where we're at and I think instead of like banning guys like me

[07:31] jersey jack pinball needs to start listening to this feedback because they're gonna hear it with

[07:36] people's wallets and again I just feel like something's missing the soul of this company was always

[07:42] jack guinari and I can't imagine he has much say now in these games and once this company has moved

[07:48] to Chicago I don't know now man I really don't know what's going on but you know I think waiting

[07:55] and seeing now is like the way to go and I'll say this right now too David Fix is very happy right

[08:00] now the happiest man is David Fix and I'll end the show by saying the following how good how cohesive

[08:07] and how much better does foo fighter look now after seeing what this game is when you actually see

[08:13] gameplay footage canada out thank you guys for the support I'll see you at Texas
