[00:00] Alright, well it's Sunday morning, I'm up in my rooftop and I just had to get another

[00:14] podcast out and the reason why is I've very rarely find myself so emotionally disturbed

[00:22] that I just need to get to the airwaves and share my feelings with you and this is a

[00:27] pinball podcast, right? This is a place you go to hear me talk about pinball, to hear me interview

[00:33] people about pinball. It's not a place you go to hear serious topics or discussions about all the

[00:40] crap going on in the real world but what happened over the last few days is a collision of those two

[00:45] things and I think how people are handling that collision of pinball and one of its designers being

[00:52] accused of child pornography is so telling to me it's also so utterly disturbing and upsetting to

[01:00] me what I'm reading some people say and some of the comments people are putting up are sort of

[01:05] exposing the the dirty underbelly of our community and our hobby and the fact that for the longest time

[01:13] you know we could all probably agree that there's a lot of racist stuff that goes up there's a lot

[01:18] of sexist stuff that goes up every once in a while in the form but this is where I draw the line

[01:24] how can you not draw the line at child pornography at pedophilia like isn't this is this is not an

[01:32] area where you can joke where you can make light of where you can make remarks that you haven't

[01:37] thought out you know if if you're going to post something in response to what happened to John

[01:42] Trudeau you have to think about what you're saying before you say it now I mean I just saw a post on

[01:49] there where some individual on pinside basically said I don't really care who designs my game as

[01:55] long as it's fun and really you don't care who designs your game what that person has done in

[02:03] life as long as the game is fun so we're putting pinball ahead of everything else it means the game

[02:09] being fun means more than than anything else so enjoy that pinball machine if Adolf Hitler made it

[02:15] all right who cares at least you know Adolf's really great at making games fast and have his games

[02:21] have great flow so I don't really care what he did as long as the game is fun and I know I'm talking

[02:27] about this in an extreme but the real common I want it to talk about and I wanted to dedicate

[02:33] a podcast to this because I really don't think comments like this should just be able to go up

[02:41] and then be deleted without any discussion and I'm already starting to see I'm already starting to see

[02:48] different pinball forums locking threads that are discussing what John Trudeau is being accused of

[02:55] and shutting them down and then what I'm going to call out the most which I think is completely lame

[03:01] is the Ossier Kate forum has decided to lock the thread nothing left to discuss here how is there

[03:07] nothing left to discuss here the man has just been accused he's just been arrested this is going

[03:13] to be going on for a while and you lock the thread already that is like locking the J-pop thread the

[03:20] moment he takes the deposit on magic girl or the locking the Kevin thread the moment he says all right

[03:27] I can't make the games there is so much more to be said here and here's the reason why they're

[03:32] locking it because they don't want any negativity to infiltrate the pinball hobby that this is bad

[03:40] for pinball and so we're going to silence we're going to silence something that doesn't paint

[03:46] one of pinball's most celebrate designers in a bad light and to me that is a crime in itself

[03:54] that you are trying to keep people from sharing how they feel from from any of the news that happens

[04:01] around the John Trudeau case you've you've now locked the thread so now we have to start a new thread

[04:07] when we get more developments and I and again I just think it's indicative that some people in this

[04:12] hobby put pinball ahead of so many other things and I get it I get it it's an internet forum it

[04:19] brings out weird parts of people and people are anonymous so they feel they can post stuff that

[04:24] might be a little sexist or racist or this and that but again if you don't draw the line here

[04:30] if you don't make an example of people that say stuff that is in bad color around this topic

[04:38] then I don't want to be a part of this hobby I really don't and I don't think there's a person

[04:42] out there that doesn't go to pinball shows that doesn't see the majority of people who are into this

[04:47] hobby they all fall into a pretty stereotypical category all right and I but I know a lot of you

[04:55] and you guys are fucking awesome you guys have great values you guys are good parents good fathers

[05:01] good husbands good people good people now I know the Trudeau thing really sucks because it doesn't

[05:08] matter what we see on the surface people can have really really dark secrets in their closet

[05:14] that they're hiding but the reason why I wanted to talk about a comment and one singular comment

[05:20] on this podcast because I think it matters who it came from and what he said and I'm trying to

[05:25] make sense of it I've been asking a bunch of people in the pinball hobby what what does this mean

[05:31] what does this comment mean and this comment came from Steve Richie and Steve Richie posted this

[05:37] comment on Facebook before he deleted it and I want to read it to you because a lot of you might

[05:42] out have seen it it you might not see it in the pinside thread and this is Steve's response to

[05:47] people asking him throughout the day what what's going on with John and so he wrote this it was a

[05:54] bad day for pinball if we stop talking about it it might go away don't post okay what the fuck does

[06:04] he mean by that I mean I'm just I really want Steve to clarify this I don't think you can just

[06:09] delete a comment like this and it just goes away I mean he's basically literally saying if we stop

[06:15] stop talking about it it might go away what might go away the negativity this has on pinball might

[06:22] go away John his friends accusations might go away what's gonna go away Steve I just I saw that I'm

[06:34] like that's not an appropriate statement I just for the love of me for the love of me I want all

[06:42] of us in this hobby to to have some some common sense when approaching what's happening here I mean

[06:51] this isn't like a joke this isn't us just making fun of what we always make fun of in pinball

[06:57] and this isn't silence is a good thing right now because we need to not paint pick pinball in a

[07:03] bad light you know the reality is this stern pinball Monday morning needs to make a statement

[07:09] and stern pinball needs to get ahead of this crisis silence is not the way to go if I was stern

[07:15] pinball what they need to do effective immediately is put John Trudeau on an unpaid suspension it's

[07:23] the same way a football team would suspend a player who has accusations of domestic violence or

[07:28] anything really serious you are suspended without pay until the legal system can do its process

[07:35] right because John is still innocent until proven guilty this is still the United States of America

[07:40] we still have our legal systems we still have you know your time and your day in court all right he

[07:44] has a right to defend himself does it look good for John absolutely not anyone who knows these

[07:50] kinds of cases they do not issue subpoenas to go into your house and knock on your door and

[07:58] seize your computer and arrest you unless they have proof proof which means he was in possession

[08:06] of child pornography now how that got there I don't know but it doesn't look good so stern

[08:13] needs to come out immediately and say that John is suspended stern needs to tell Steve Richie

[08:19] what are you doing Steve what are you doing you know I mean this comment Steve I want you to

[08:25] clarify I think you need to clarify it I don't think you can say a comment like this and then just

[08:31] delete it like what do you what did you mean by it and I brought this comment you know to the

[08:35] off the arcade form I started a new thread and you know they you know some some a hole on there

[08:40] saying oh canada you're just doing this for your own attention I mean what for my own attention

[08:46] I swear to God I am like so close to not doing any more pinball podcast because I'm so utterly

[08:53] disgusted by some of the people on on on the forums that are talking about this because honestly

[09:00] they literally they think pinball is like all that matters in the world if you think pinball is

[09:04] all that matters and that nothing else is more important then you need to get a life and you need

[09:09] to not say shit that so close minded and puts pinball at the center of the universe because let me

[09:13] break it to you 99.9% of people don't give a shit about pinball it's a very small group of us

[09:18] that do there's a very even smaller group of us that are absolute idiots and chase down

[09:23] $9,000 toys we don't need and then argue about their merits and then complain about the features

[09:29] in it then we still buy it and then we say like the game sucks and then we say it's the greatest

[09:33] game ever if we own it and then everyone else it doesn't own it says it sucks you say it's a

[09:38] we live in a stupid little bubble it's fun it's entertaining it's enjoyable let's keep it that way

[09:44] and the way we're going to keep it that way is by calling people out who are ruining it and Steve

[09:49] Richie you're common you need to clarify it you need to clarify for people what you meant by that

[09:54] because you're a celebrated leader in this hobby you're a designer at Stern pinball you need to

[10:00] lead by example and what you said to me right now at face value either indicates that you've lost

[10:07] command of the human language somehow and you don't even know what those words um incinuit or you

[10:13] are incinuating that you just want this to go away and think people should shut up because that's

[10:17] what I read in your comment shut up don't post and this might go away and then we can get back

[10:24] to saying how great my star wars pinball machine is but I'm sorry it's not that simple it's not

[10:28] that cut and dry Steve we're not going to just let you get off the hook with this and I'm happy

[10:34] that I'm letting a lot of you hear about it because I think a lot of you out there wouldn't have

[10:37] known about it and I think people should be held accountable for what they say during a time like

[10:42] this okay and anyone out there who's making jokes I saw a joke out there like oh I was going to

[10:47] make a joke about the uh Trudeau flipper gap when it in in in in in in in in in comparison to pedophilia

[10:54] are you fucking kidding me you're really going to do that do you understand I think people don't want

[10:59] to understand like child pornography is the unwilling raping of children I mean I can't believe

[11:07] I'm talking about this on a pinball podcast um but this is time this is the time for Robin

[11:13] and the moderation team and any moderators out there that have pinball forms um to to shut down

[11:19] those individuals and kick them off the site this should be a zero tolerance topic I don't think

[11:25] you should close the threads I think it is really really stupid to close the threads let people

[11:30] air how they feel but I think you need to really start banning people who make joke or some ill

[11:37] comment about this topic I think that's inexcusable and I also I'm calling on my other pinball

[11:42] podcasters out there to also do the same as I'm doing I think we need to hold people accountable

[11:49] for what they say because no one else will and that's that's just the problem in this hobby is

[11:55] is everyone just wants it to be this this thing off in the corner that'll go away and and look this

[12:00] thing will go away when John is found either innocent or guilty but in the meantime the rest of us

[12:07] we are on trial for our own values in how we respond to this this incident and either you're going

[12:14] to show people that you're someone who has values and understands the significance of this um

[12:20] accusation or you're just going to go be an anonymous jerk and asshole and say comments that are

[12:26] completely completely disgusting and you should be banned if you make a comment like that considering

[12:31] what's at stake here okay and Stern needs to move fast you know I love it Stern wasn't happy

[12:37] Stern and I know Stern's struggling here this is a real issue in crisis this is going to be the

[12:41] first true test of of of Josh Sharp and Jared and George Gomez and the people the communications

[12:49] people Jodie how they respond will be really really critical here and I think the big and I'll say

[12:56] this and I've been talking to some people in the hobby about this look I don't think Stern should

[13:00] stop making should well I know it's an interesting question should they stop making ghost busters

[13:06] knowing what's going on here should they be like we're going to pause all Trudeau games that are in

[13:10] production um I definitely think that if he has a new game coming out I wouldn't release it

[13:18] I I think that this is going to test Stern's values versus Stern's desire to be profitable um

[13:25] because they really can they really afford to have a game that was slated for production soon

[13:31] be be delayed because of this it's it's it's completely out of left field for them they weren't

[13:38] anticipating this they couldn't have anticipated this but they really need to do the right thing here

[13:44] and I think all of us out there should if if John is found guilty and look this thing could take a

[13:49] while but as long as he's under suspension under suspicion of this I don't think you can release

[13:55] a pinball machine by John Trudeau um I think it's it's a difficult decision I want to do with his

[14:00] existing machines that are in production um but this is this is not going to go away um we're not

[14:06] going to talk about this every day on the podcast I've I've said I've said my piece in terms of

[14:12] stand alone podcast about this um I will talk about it within pinball news I will of course

[14:19] cover if Stern responds to this and what my thoughts are in that response and I I will probably be

[14:25] talking about this with guests on the show like it or not pinball people like it or not this is a

[14:31] major bombshell in your hobby it will be talked about there is no brushing it under the carpet you

[14:38] can't just go play your congos and it's all gonna go away Steve it's not gonna happen so it sucks

[14:44] it's a really really bad thing has this ever happened before in the history of pinball has

[14:48] one of pinball's greatest designers been arrested for being in possession of child pornography

[14:54] it's never happened it's hard for all of us to come to grips with this I was just talking an

[14:59] eight shivers about it you know he was saying it's weird it's it's hard to discuss it is it is

[15:04] this is not what I don't do a podcast here to to catch predators and out people and and and

[15:10] slam people's values on what they post around this on pinside this is completely out of category

[15:15] for me um but but it means a lot to me that I that I say this because I I I think we can't

[15:22] sweep this under the carpet I think Steve needs to clarify his points and I think pinball forms

[15:28] out there need to keep these threads open and let people voice their opinions about this because

[15:34] it's too serious of a topic to just delete it and and hope we can go back to loving pinball

[15:40] this is a black mark on the hobby it's a black mark on on stern it's a black mark on all of us

[15:46] and we support a hobby where our main designer is accused of owning child pornography and I don't

[15:53] know about you guys but like a lot of my friends were just like well doesn't surprise me mean look

[15:58] is in the hobby like you know it's like fuck like when am I gonna say that like you don't get it

[16:02] like everyone else is really awesome and and I'm right they're wrong but it's just you know it's

[16:07] just sad it's like you don't want to see anyone in any hobby and any anyone that people look up to

[16:14] be found guilty or charged of something like this so enjoy your Sundays this is my another rant

[16:20] on on this topic but like I think you need to know and I and I see the forms trying to delete it

[16:25] I see Steve trying to sweep it under the carpet we're not gonna let it go people have a great Sunday

[16:30] I'll talk to you soon
