[00:00] You know, when you make a lot of predictions on Canadian Pimball podcast every once in a

[00:04] while you're going to be wrong.

[00:06] And this was a time in which I was absolutely wrong in which I said that American Pimball

[00:11] would not sell legends of Vahala in large numbers.

[00:16] And so what I'm reading today is that they were able to sell 500 legends of Vahala deluxe

[00:23] editions through two distributors in just one weekend.

[00:28] So I do want to admit that I was wrong that this game sold way better than I thought it

[00:34] would.

[00:35] And so because of that, I want to offer up my congratulations to David Fix, to Michael

[00:41] Grant, to Scott Gullix, and the team who worked on this game over at Riot Pimball and American

[00:47] Pimball.

[00:48] Now I know I got upset that they bumped up the number from 300 to 500.

[00:53] And my only advice to American Pimball is that now you guys understand the importance

[00:59] of limiting the game.

[01:01] It drives people to buy it.

[01:03] The first three American Pimball games did not have a deluxe edition.

[01:08] They did not have a limited edition.

[01:10] And so see what happens when you actually put FOMO out into the world.

[01:15] It creates an urgency to buy.

[01:17] And the FOMO is not just by consumers, but it's also by distributors because distributors

[01:22] know that if there's one edition of this game, people are going to want, it's the deluxe

[01:27] edition.

[01:28] It's going to be a lot harder to sell the standard edition.

[01:30] We all know this.

[01:31] But what does it mean in 2021 that an original IP game can sell at this volume and for $8400?

[01:42] I think that's the most impressive thing.

[01:45] And that's the part that I completely got wrong.

[01:47] I did not think they would be able to sell this game at this price.

[01:51] Now you could argue that how many of these are sold to customers and how many of these

[01:56] are sold through to distributors, but it's still great news.

[02:01] And I don't think American Pimball has had a moment like this.

[02:03] They haven't seen the order banks open up and this many people try to get a game.

[02:08] I think they got overly excited about that.

[02:11] And that's also why they bumped up the number to 500.

[02:15] But I do want to give them another piece of advice.

[02:17] A couple more pieces of advice.

[02:19] First and foremost, the first piece of advice I would give is to make these deposits non-refundable

[02:24] because as we know and spooky learn this the hard way, you can get orders and you can

[02:30] get deposits, but you don't want people to be able to back out of their deposit once

[02:37] they see gameplay or once they see more footage of the game because as we know, there is

[02:43] a lot of rushing through the door FOMO on week one or day one of a game coming out.

[02:49] And if you give people too much time to think about it, they might want a bail.

[02:54] And spooky's done a great job of preventing that, right?

[02:57] No one can bail on their order.

[02:58] The other thing I would do is just own it.

[03:01] You have to own it.

[03:03] There is still confusion on whether or not the Deluxe Edition is a premium or if it's an

[03:10] Ellie of this game.

[03:11] No, the way they position the Deluxe Edition, they first said only 300, then they said 500.

[03:18] And I'm fine with that.

[03:20] I get American Pimbal was excited.

[03:22] They got all these orders.

[03:23] But even on their own communication when they said we're making 500, there's a sentence

[03:28] that doesn't make sense.

[03:30] And the sentences are intent was never to limit the number of games.

[03:35] Yes it was.

[03:36] That's exactly what you did when you said only 300 or only 500.

[03:41] And American Pimbal, it's okay to have an intent to limit a number of games to make

[03:48] people feel like they're getting something special.

[03:50] And again, I think they're just a young company.

[03:53] They're super excited.

[03:54] This is a new team.

[03:55] Michael Grant, David Fix, they haven't been down this road before.

[03:58] They haven't seen this much excitement for their brand and for their games.

[04:03] And so congratulations.

[04:04] I also think they got this game out at the right time.

[04:08] Distributors are starving for new inbox games.

[04:11] So this is what you need to do.

[04:13] You need to give a distributor some new product because they're waiting on backlog daughters

[04:18] from Stern.

[04:19] And so if you want something new in box, we now will make you a game.

[04:23] And I hear that they're able to make 20 games a week.

[04:26] So we will see how fast these games get on the line.

[04:29] And I just wanted to do this really quick show saying congratulations to American Pimbal.

[04:35] You were right.

[04:36] I was wrong.

[04:37] And I think this opens the door for a lot of excitement by Mr. Dennis Nornman and what

[04:43] this company has down the road.

[04:45] Now do I think original games are going to sell thousands of units?

[04:49] I do not.

[04:50] But, but you best believe that Dennis Nornman is looking at this and saying I can make a game

[04:56] that's even better.

[04:57] I can make a game with even better artwork and I can make a game with more toys in it.

[05:02] And if we can sell this at 8400, this definitely starts to make the business case that an

[05:08] original IP game can put a lot in it and also charge a decent amount of money.

[05:14] The other part, and then I'll end this quick show is if you're over at Jersey Jack and

[05:17] Stern and you're seeing this game sell for 8400, man, this means the ceiling is so much

[05:24] higher than people realize.

[05:26] Unfortunately for all of us out there, we are going to have to start paying a lot more

[05:32] than we used to to get what we want in a Pimbal machine.

[05:35] Unfortunately, in 2022, we're going to see prices go north way past what we've seen in

[05:41] 2021 because this game is an indication of that.

[05:44] 8400, original IP and it sold through 548 hours.

[05:50] Now how much is Guns and Roses worth next to Legends of a Hala?

[05:53] And this, how much is back to the future worth next to Legends of a Hala?

[05:58] You could charge double and you'd sell instantly.

[06:01] Everybody, this has been a very short little episode.

[06:03] Congratulations, AP.

[06:05] Thanks for shaking up the market.

[06:07] We'll see where things go later.
