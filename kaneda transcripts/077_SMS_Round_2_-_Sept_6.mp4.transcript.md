[00:00] See if this works.

[00:02] There we go.

[00:04] Well, we're live again.

[00:09] Oh, I got about like 15 more minutes gang than I got to like...

[00:15] I feel like I need an app.

[00:18] It's been a...

[00:21] It's been a week.

[00:23] It's gonna rain today.

[00:25] It got real human.

[00:35] Well, we're back on YouTube.

[00:37] Oh, in the middle of all my questions and all my answers.

[00:43] What will Star Wars be?

[00:47] Walking Dead Star Wars Walking Dead Pokemon.

[00:51] Maybe.

[00:53] Maybe.

[00:55] I don't know.

[00:57] I just like the more...

[01:01] The more I get, you know, exposed to all this stuff,

[01:07] I think more and more people are just gonna be content with the great games they have.

[01:13] And I think for newer games to...

[01:19] To make their way into your game room, they're gonna have to be really special.

[01:25] And I think that's gonna be a really difficult bar for a lot of these companies.

[01:29] I think a lot of these pinball companies were fully expecting this like inelastic demand for the product.

[01:37] They thought that, you know, people would just keep buying.

[01:41] They thought they could just keep raising prices.

[01:43] They thought nobody would notice the lack of mechanical wow.

[01:47] They thought that, you know, we would just be forking over money.

[01:51] Like, when you make a game like Predator with no Arnold in it,

[01:55] and you basically are charging $12 to $15,000 for it with tariffs,

[02:01] you gotta like remember it.

[02:03] Like that should have been killed in the conference room before any real money or effort was put behind making it.

[02:13] You can't make Predator without Arnold. It's that simple.

[02:17] Much harder to do that than even Alien without Ripley because they just doesn't work.

[02:25] And I think a lot of people are just still enjoying the hobby.

[02:31] This misconception that the only way to enjoy the hobby is by continuing to buy new stuff.

[02:41] Like that, to me, the friends of mine that are having the most fun in the hobby right now are operators because they love watching all these people lose money on these new inbox.

[02:53] You know, because they're making money on an operator level and they're making a killing and like having new games coming in actually helps them a lot.

[03:01] You know, so they're not looking to like collect the game.

[03:04] I mean, think about how silly it is. You buy a 13,000-dollar pinball machine that has a coin mech in it that's set up to make money.

[03:10] The game was designed to make money and you bought it, put it in your home, make no money off of it and lose $4,000 on top of what you paid for it.

[03:22] And you think that model is going to last for a lot longer?

[03:28] You know, we all used to buy these games and lose no money and it would gain value.

[03:34] So, you know, that's the real reckoning that's coming.

[03:39] I think spooky pinball pricing veto juice at $9,999 is going to be a killer.

[03:47] A killer problem for Dune.

[03:50] It's going to be a real problem for Stern trying to sell 13,000-dollar LEDs.

[03:56] Star Wars is going to, yeah, absolutely Star Wars is going to kill it on location.

[04:01] And here's what's amazing is when I talk to my friends who are operators, they actually want the game to flop on a collector level and a consumer home buying level.

[04:11] Because if Star Wars doesn't do well and you don't want to buy it for your home, then you're going to seek it out on location and pump in tons of money to play it on location.

[04:24] You know, because you're curious about it.

[04:27] So it's the way like Venom can make money on location because people don't want to own it.

[04:32] But you're still curious to play the experience.

[04:36] I feel like putting down deposit for 2p3s because I'm too lazy to swap out.

[04:41] Oh my gosh.

[04:43] You know, like I listening to Jerry's talk about tariffs. He's not wrong.

[04:47] I just I continually think that.

[04:50] I mean, I don't know.

[04:52] I don't know how you run a business where there's no real long-term growth and there's no.

[04:57] You're a solution in search of a problem.

[05:00] That's the problem with multi-morphic.

[05:02] The whole platform is a solution in search of a problem because the whole hobby has telegraph to him that we don't have a problem having machines that don't have swappable playfields.

[05:15] And even if space is a problem, it doesn't mean I want pinball to be like that.

[05:19] If that's the solution, most people don't want it.

[05:23] How long does curiosity sustain the earnings?

[05:30] Well, look, I mean, in the end, the other amazing part about going out and playing pinball on location is you get to hang with your friends, drink beer and play pinball.

[05:40] It's a lot of fun.

[05:41] Music going, pins are there.

[05:43] We're social creatures.

[05:45] There's nothing sad or believe me gang.

[05:48] When these content creators with all the pins and their basements, the reason why they have to turn the camera on all the time is they're bored.

[05:58] They're bored with all the games behind them.

[06:02] They when they play them lonely at night in their house, that's not fun.

[06:10] Like I've owned every, you know, I've owned so many great arcade devices, whether it's pinball, whether it's street fighters, whether it's donkey Kong, Pac-Man, it doesn't matter.

[06:23] Nothing is more fun than just getting together with your boys and having some beers and talking about the hobby is more fun than even playing.

[06:33] I mean, you guys know this to be true.

[06:37] It's the reason why you go to a pinball show.

[06:39] Like the majority of time people are not even on the machines.

[06:43] Just fun to hang out and socialize.

[06:45] And that's what owning a spot to go play.

[06:50] That's what's fun about it.

[06:52] We just want to hang out with other people that are into what we're into.

[06:57] That's why Canadian Club and our little get together is every week.

[07:03] It's just fun for people.

[07:06] It doesn't come with an extraordinary price tag.

[07:09] It doesn't change who you are.

[07:12] And I see these guys, you know, they're bored.

[07:15] They're just bored.

[07:17] And when you get more comfortable with the games you own and get more comfortable with yourself, then you stop seeking, you know, fulfillment in super expensive new games.

[07:30] And you find fulfillment in this hobby through relationships supporting your local operator.

[07:41] Listening to podcasts, whether it's free or $5 a month, you know, you find a lot more satisfaction in this type of stuff.

[07:50] Like if you were to turn this off right now and turn off the chat and just go solo, sit and play the games you own.

[07:59] I'm telling you, you'd feel more isolated and you'd feel more alone.

[08:03] And even if you put up a great score, nobody saw it.

[08:06] Now, if you look, if three of your friends came over and you guys are all drinking beers and whiskeys, it's a different story.

[08:11] A whole different story.

[08:13] More fun to play like that.

[08:16] And that is why these were meant to be in our cades surrounded by people and energy, not meant to be just in your house.

[08:24] You turn them on, nobody cares.

[08:27] I never played shows. I never played shows either, Michael.

[08:30] I always found pinball. It shows to be absolutely unsatisfying.

[08:36] I've only, if I ever do jump on it's just because the game's brand new and I've never played it before.

[08:41] But even then, I've never really had like a great experience playing a pinball machine at a show.

[08:47] Buy spooky's next game or trip to Bangkok.

[08:50] Always the trip. Always.

[08:54] Everybody, look, this is fun. I know this is like we lost about half the audience, but everybody be good.

[09:00] Thank you for the, you know, the super chats earlier, sad boy.

[09:04] Thank you for hanging out.

[09:07] Enjoy the short amount of time you have on this plan. It be good to each other, be kind to each other.

[09:12] And let's just save our, our, our laughter for what Stern thinks is a $13,000 star wars. I really hope they blows away.

[09:19] I'm nervous now. We're not even really going to see the game Monday, Tuesday.

[09:23] I think they might hide behind license or approval as the delay. I think they've botched this delay.

[09:29] I think they went out too early with the teaser.

[09:33] And, you know, I'm really, I'm really, I'm really nervous for them. I think they, they're operating in a little bit of a vacuum.

[09:43] And I think it's going to bite them. I still think they're going to sell a ton though because it's star wars.

[09:48] And you know, I'm saying it's still star wars. Like I could be two things can be two opposing things can be rights.

[09:54] Stern could have a mediocre star wars game with a horrible marketing launch and still sell five to 8,000 units of the game.

[10:02] Like two of those things can happen at the same time. And I think that might be what happens.

[10:08] Alright, everybody, let's get out of here. Have a good Saturday. I'm going to go take a bubble bath. Chill.

[10:16] Love you guys. Peace.

[10:19] We're ending it there.
