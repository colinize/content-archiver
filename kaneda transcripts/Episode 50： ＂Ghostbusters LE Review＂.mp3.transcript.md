[00:00] We just had a visit from the Environmental Protection Agency.

[00:03] How's the grid old?

[00:05] No, it's not good.

[00:06] Tell them about the Twinkie.

[00:08] What about the Twinkie?

[00:10] I don't know about you guys, but I always

[00:19] and depressed a little bit after a long weekend and you have to go back to work, but it's

[00:24] a short week, so that's good.

[00:27] Had a great weekend in New York, the weather was beautiful.

[00:30] Brendan and I took the Hellcat upstate to a vineyard on Saturday.

[00:35] Did some cruising around.

[00:37] Just relaxing nice weekend here in New York.

[00:39] And I got to play a lot of Ghostbusters, Ellie, Pinball, over at Sunshine.

[00:44] So I want to talk about this game in more detail, because I think this has been a game

[00:51] I've really been anticipating playing.

[00:55] I'm super excited that Sunshine Laundromat in Williamsburg, Brooklyn has Ghostbusters,

[01:01] Ellie.

[01:02] And I just want to give my thoughts on this game.

[01:03] And I think I've played it at least 40 to 50 times now.

[01:08] I mean, I was there all weekend, even through the fire.

[01:12] This is crazy.

[01:13] Sunshine, there was a fire that happened in the Laundromat area.

[01:17] Some woman put flammable clothes or a sheet into one of the dryers and it's literally

[01:23] it was on fire and the fire department came by and I was in the pinball area with crazy

[01:29] levy and a group of his friends and we're all just playing Ghostbusters while the fire

[01:33] people are trying to douse out the flames.

[01:36] It was pretty funny.

[01:37] We had to exit through the floor.

[01:39] It was kind of like a funny moment when the fire guy walks through the door and is like,

[01:45] what the fuck are you people doing still playing pinball?

[01:47] Get out of here.

[01:49] But here's my thoughts on Ghostbusters, Ellie.

[01:51] This is all we're going to talk about on this short little snackable edition of Canada's

[01:56] Pinball Podcast.

[01:58] I am so polarized by this game and I think two words come to mind when I think about Ghostbusters

[02:05] Ellie and those two words are fun and frustrating.

[02:11] And I think I don't know which one it's more of.

[02:16] I don't know if it's more fun or more frustrating and every time I play this game, I

[02:21] think it's like sensory overload.

[02:24] There's so many things going on that I love.

[02:27] There's so many things going on that I hate.

[02:31] But it all adds up to one thing.

[02:34] It's like it's like a math problem.

[02:36] You can have positives and negatives but at the end of the equal symbol, does it equal

[02:42] more fun or does it equal more frustrating?

[02:45] And I want to talk about what I think the equation is and then I'll make my conclusion

[02:50] and what I think comes after that equal symbol.

[02:52] But first thing before even get into that, the Ghostbusters Ellie that is at Sunshine has

[02:58] an August 24th build date.

[03:01] So I have been telling people on this podcast that Stern has fixed all the issues with the

[03:07] play field, that things are fine, that the later August builds are going to be okay.

[03:12] So when the game got there at the beginning, I think it was like mid-middle of the week,

[03:17] I was super excited.

[03:18] I went over there, I looked over the play field.

[03:21] There was no ghosting on any of the inserts.

[03:23] Everything was awesome.

[03:25] But when I got there on Saturday, I looked down and there, sure enough, on the Tobin insert,

[03:32] on the right side, there was ghosting.

[03:34] And I was like, oh no, it's happened again.

[03:40] Super tiny insert, super sort of tiny bit of ghosting.

[03:44] Didn't see any other ghosting on any of the other inserts.

[03:49] So I don't know.

[03:51] So what I did was this, instead of like running on to Pinside, I can't because I'm banned,

[03:56] instead of going nuts, I simply said to myself, well this just doesn't look that bad.

[04:02] I went to every other machine in Sunshine and I looked at the inserts because I don't

[04:08] think staring at inserts is something that we have been accustomed to doing until this

[04:13] whole Ghostbusters debacle.

[04:15] And what did I find?

[04:17] I found that on 95% of machines, there was ghosted inserts.

[04:23] On their Tron LE, there was a huge insert that had ghosting all over it, one of the

[04:29] like the Tron Light Cycle inserts that's smack dab in the middle.

[04:34] And I never noticed it before.

[04:35] I noticed ghosted inserts on all the other Bally Williams titles they had there, other

[04:41] Stern titles they had there.

[04:43] Again, these are like little things that are surrounding some of the inserts.

[04:47] I didn't notice playfield chipping on any of these.

[04:50] So my conclusion is this, that a little bit of ghosting is part of Pimba.

[04:55] And for those people that think that they deserve a whole new playfield because a couple

[04:58] of their inserts are ghosting, I think they're wrong.

[05:01] I don't know if there's a way to make a playfield that doesn't have any ghosting at all.

[05:05] I'm looking at my Tales of the Rabie and Knights and I have a CPR Gold Edition playfield

[05:11] put in this.

[05:12] And there's a little bit of ghosting on one of the inserts.

[05:14] Alright, that's a, what, a thousand dollar playfield.

[05:19] So say what you will, say what you will, but I think that we all need to just get over

[05:25] this whole ghosting and if I see a little thing I'm going to panic and freak out.

[05:29] Another thing I noticed on the machine before I get into the actual review itself, there's

[05:33] there's so many dimples on this machine already.

[05:37] It's only been on location for a few days and the thing is just dimpled like nothing

[05:42] else.

[05:43] Again, but dimples equal Pimba.

[05:46] There's dimples all over my Tales of the Rabie and Knights.

[05:49] I think people who are complaining about dimples, again, these are brand new collectors who

[05:53] don't understand anything about Pimba.

[05:56] Dimples are normal.

[05:57] They're natural wood dimples when there's a steel ball that's bouncing around it.

[06:03] I don't understand why people think dimples is a signal of an inferior playfield or

[06:08] clear code.

[06:09] Alright, enough of that.

[06:10] We just want to say I don't know if like Stern has completely fixed it.

[06:15] I just hope that they deal with the chip to playfields if those happen.

[06:22] But for the most part, ghosting is still an issue.

[06:25] And until I see otherwise, I still I guess I'm just going to have fingers crossed and be

[06:30] knocking on wood hoping the one I get is a better quality.

[06:34] So what do I think it goes, Buzzs is a game.

[06:38] The commentary and there's been lots of threads on this.

[06:41] I saw a thread that just started is Ghostbusters the best Pimba machine ever.

[06:45] And of course that created a shit storm of comments about people saying yes and no.

[06:50] And the question itself is sort of irrelevant.

[06:53] If the game's fun to you, that's all that matters.

[06:55] There's no such thing as like the top 100 Pimba machine.

[06:58] It's like the top 100 movies of all time.

[07:00] Citizen Kane is number one.

[07:02] I don't think most people think Citizen Kane is the best movie ever or the most enjoyable.

[07:08] So what do I think?

[07:09] I think Ghostbusters is here, let me go down the fun column and then the fush reading

[07:15] column.

[07:16] So the fun column, I think Ghostbusters is the greatest theme possible for Pimba.

[07:20] I really do.

[07:21] I don't think there's been a better theme that's become a Pimba machine ever.

[07:28] I gotta say it, ever.

[07:30] It's such a fun, campy quirky movie that so many people love.

[07:33] It spans generations, adults love it, kids love it.

[07:36] The original film is amazing.

[07:39] I just, and the subject matter of the film lends itself perfectly to Pimba, to Pimba

[07:45] modes, the art package, everything about it, right?

[07:50] So the theme is incredible.

[07:52] The artwork.

[07:53] The zombie Eddie artwork on this Pimba machine is, I think it's the best artwork on any

[07:58] Pimba machine ever.

[08:00] And again, I say this because at Sunshine, they've got Ghostbusters next to the best Pimba

[08:05] machines ever.

[08:06] They've got it next to a Tron Ali.

[08:08] They've got it next to Medieval Men, they've got it next to an Adem's family, Twilight

[08:12] Zone, Big Bang Bar.

[08:15] They've gotta tell us they're Arabian Knights.

[08:17] They've got a theater, a circus, a tour, they've got ACDC, they've got Spider-Man, they

[08:21] got Lord of the Rings.

[08:22] I mean, literally, fun house.

[08:24] Well, you name it.

[08:25] It's a shadow.

[08:26] They've got the best Pimba machines that have come out over the last 20, 30 years, and

[08:31] it's there, and it blows everything away.

[08:34] The colors, the playfield artwork, the cabinet artwork, the green armor, it just stands

[08:40] out like no other Pimba machine.

[08:42] And so from a, you take an incredible theme, and then you take an art package, it just pulls

[08:46] you in.

[08:48] And you've got just, oh, you're just excited before you even hit start.

[08:52] All right.

[08:53] And then what else is fun?

[08:54] The sound, okay?

[08:55] There's just something about the Ghostbusters theme song when it's playing.

[09:01] It just draws you in.

[09:02] And the sound is so good in this game.

[09:05] It's such better sound than in any other machine that I've played.

[09:10] I mean, it's the quality's there.

[09:13] And again, when you have a theme where the theme song gets you going, and there's some

[09:18] movies that have those sort of iconic theme songs or TV shows, I think Ghostbusters has

[09:22] that.

[09:24] And then I think, you know, this is just, I have to say it, just visually, the playfield,

[09:29] it's so fun to look at.

[09:31] There's so much going on with the slimer, with the stay pup, with the museum, the firehouse,

[09:38] the storage facility.

[09:39] It's just visually.

[09:41] When you look at Tron Ellie and Game of Thrones Ellie and then Ghostbusters Ellie, if you

[09:48] just look at them, I mean, Ghostbusters looks ten times as packed with stuff.

[09:54] As Tron Ellie.

[09:55] I mean, Tron Ellie looks barren, barren, compared to Ghostbusters Ellie.

[10:00] Now, that is not me saying that I think Ghostbusters Ellie is more fun or better.

[10:04] So don't flame me.

[10:05] All you Tron fanboys who love the game more than anything.

[10:10] So in all those elements, it's like, right, it's like Ghostbusters feels like a winner

[10:15] before you even plunge.

[10:16] And I think that's part of the problem with this game is that you're so in love with

[10:21] it before you even plunge.

[10:24] And what that does is it creates this prejudice, right?

[10:27] You're pre-judging the machine that it's going to be as fun to play as all of those

[10:32] things I just described.

[10:35] So what happens when we plunge?

[10:38] Okay, so this is where I think things start to get into the frustrating column.

[10:45] So why am I frustrated by Ghostbusters?

[10:47] So I'm not going to beat a dead horse about the flipper gap and the difficulty of the

[10:54] machine because I think this has been discussed so many times, but I'll have to say it.

[10:58] In a game that's a theme that is so universal and generally inviting, I do find it really

[11:05] frustrating that they made the game so damn hard.

[11:08] I don't understand that.

[11:10] This game is so hard.

[11:12] And I watch guys like Crazy Levy.

[11:14] And Levy is an amazing pinball player.

[11:16] I mean, I watched him do a dead save on Ghostbusters.

[11:20] I mean, literally the ball was about to go down the center drain hole.

[11:24] It already went in the outland and came down and he fucking nudged it and the ball popped

[11:29] back up into play.

[11:30] That's the first time I've ever seen that and I was like, holy shit.

[11:34] And he knows how to play.

[11:36] And the game's challenging for guys like him.

[11:39] And so if it's giving, like, you know, I'm just going to say this, like these guys are

[11:44] like almost pro skill level players difficulty.

[11:48] It's going to slaughter a dude like me.

[11:50] And I think that's where guys like me, guys like Rare Hero, guys like Mr. Kim, all like

[11:56] majority of us collectors, guys like Ted, we're not great pinball players.

[12:02] We enjoy playing pinball.

[12:03] We want to be able though to progress through games.

[12:06] And I think we look at this game like there's not a chance in hell.

[12:10] We're going to be able to progress through it because of how hard it is.

[12:13] Now why is it so hard?

[12:14] I think there's just so many shots in a regular body game.

[12:20] If you look at it, the shot lay it out is super tight.

[12:22] So you have it there.

[12:24] So Trudeau made it really hard to hit the shots because there are so many shots and they're

[12:28] so next to each other.

[12:30] Now that wouldn't be a problem if the ball would come back and hit the flippers more instead

[12:35] of going straight down the middle.

[12:37] But it's brutal, right?

[12:38] You miss a shot, you can't just flip up and flail in this game.

[12:43] Miss shots are punished immediately with drains straight down the middle or drains down

[12:47] the out lanes.

[12:49] I personally, I think the flipper gap is too big.

[12:52] I don't understand it.

[12:54] I just don't.

[12:55] I don't understand why nobody at Stern said like, wait a minute, like come on, man.

[13:00] It's more fun if you make them make less of a gap there.

[13:05] I don't like it.

[13:06] I don't like the fact that the left ball scoop shoots the ball straight down the middle

[13:14] without even a chance of stopping it with the flippers.

[13:19] Not to mention the pop bumper area when the ball is up there, when it dribbles out the

[13:23] left side of the pop area, I mean, it literally, it comes out of that area and goes straight

[13:29] down the middle.

[13:30] You can't even stop it.

[13:32] Now I hear people talk about how you have to nudge it like they're walking dead.

[13:35] I'm sorry, but that is a design flaw.

[13:38] There should be nothing.

[13:40] You should not have to nudge a machine to keep it from draining.

[13:44] If it's coming out of a section of the play field that is normal, right?

[13:51] You shouldn't be punished for the ball going into the pops.

[13:55] Every return from a mech or an area on the play field that the game is returning to you

[14:02] should return to the flippers or return to an area of the play field that doesn't drain

[14:07] immediately.

[14:08] It is absolutely a bad design that the ball comes out of the pop area and goes straight

[14:13] down the middle.

[14:15] Horrible design.

[14:16] I know there's things you can do to adjust that.

[14:18] That's fine.

[14:19] Why isn't that adjustment made at Stern and part of the final design?

[14:24] That is super frustrating.

[14:25] All right, let me go to what I think, though, is the most frustrating part of the game because

[14:30] I can deal with the flipper gap.

[14:31] I can.

[14:32] I can deal with it.

[14:33] I don't notice it as much.

[14:35] I don't get as frustrated.

[14:36] I don't want to punch the glass as much as I do it with the outlane drains.

[14:41] The rails, we've talked about this a million times.

[14:44] The ball has the tendency to jump over the outlane rail.

[14:49] But I didn't notice much jumping over as much as I noticed the way the ball steps over

[14:55] it.

[14:56] If you look at a picture of the Ghostbusters out lanes on the left and right side, you've

[15:01] got the outlane guide, sort of like a thick steel bar that is next to the outlane.

[15:08] Then you've got to the right or left of it.

[15:10] You've got the thinner bar that is the ball guide, right?

[15:15] The lane guide.

[15:16] My problem is that little thin guide, it's positioned lower than the thicker rail to

[15:26] the left or right.

[15:27] What happens is the ball hits that and bounces up and over the thicker railing.

[15:35] I think it's because that piece, it looks like it's too low.

[15:39] I feel like it needs to be higher and be parallel or lined up with a thicker rail.

[15:45] If it hit it and it bounced towards the out lanes, it would hit the rubber above the

[15:50] outlane and not go perfectly into the outlane.

[15:53] You see what I'm saying?

[15:54] It's like hitting it and jumping into the outlane.

[15:56] I know this is hard to describe in a podcast.

[15:59] I wish I could just show a picture.

[16:00] I feel like it's just a poor design.

[16:02] I think what would have solved everything is if Trudeau had just put a post, a simple

[16:07] post in front of that rail would have solved all of the issues.

[16:13] Then you could adjust the other post to the left or right that's near the cabinet.

[16:19] You could have moved that one up.

[16:20] The one that has three pegs.

[16:22] You could have changed that or removed it if you wanted the game to become more difficult.

[16:26] The way he designed it now is that steel ball just hits that metal rail and just rolls

[16:31] over into the outlane every time.

[16:34] It sucks.

[16:35] It sucks because I think there's not even a chance to nudge or save.

[16:40] It's, the ball just has a tendency to drain.

[16:44] What is that result in?

[16:46] It results in a game that's super freaking frustrating because you're constantly feeling

[16:51] like you're losing the ball and it wasn't even anything you did or you didn't even have

[16:57] a chance to save it.

[17:00] So that sucks.

[17:01] Okay.

[17:02] I think that pretty much to me, you know, there's other issues that are frustrating in the

[17:06] game but for the most part, like I'm not too fushored by the air balls.

[17:11] I know that someone is selling air ball plastic for 20 bucks.

[17:13] I think you just slap one on and you'll be fine.

[17:18] I know there's a lot of issues with the modes and the codes and the grind of having

[17:23] the start of skill shot when you plunge.

[17:27] But honestly, I didn't find that stuff too frustrating.

[17:30] Mainly because I'm just learning the game and I do understand how the skill shot works

[17:35] and I do find that actually fun having to hit your skill shot to start a mode and it's

[17:40] not like there's only one or two skill shots.

[17:42] You can go around the board and pick your skill shot.

[17:46] But here's the thing.

[17:47] I think I'd sort of explain the things that a lot of people have been explaining.

[17:52] But here's the intangible thing that I can't understand.

[17:55] I can't figure out.

[17:57] So with all of these headaches and all of this stuff that I enjoy, at the end of the

[18:03] day, as much as I bitched in moan about it, I found myself just continuing the pop quarters

[18:12] in it and it was the only game I really wanted to keep playing.

[18:16] And I jumped off it and I played Tron Ali and I was immediately pretty bored.

[18:22] And I jumped off it and I played the Adams family and I was bored.

[18:26] I jumped off it and played a bunch of games of medieval madness and I was bored.

[18:30] There was just something that I loved about the fast-paced nature and even the challenge

[18:37] that Ghostbusters presented that all of a sudden when I went and I played Lord of the

[18:41] Rings and it was just so easy to keep the ball and play, I was bored.

[18:47] And then I realized, well, wait a minute, all of these other games exist and they all

[18:51] play a certain way and they all allow a player of a certain skill level to keep the ball alive

[18:56] for a very long time.

[18:58] And here comes Ghostbusters, a game that doesn't allow that.

[19:02] It doesn't allow even great players to feel like they have tons of control over the game.

[19:08] Especially players, I think like Levy who have developed their style over the years and

[19:13] they've sort of been able to jump on any pen and bring their style to the game and be

[19:20] effective with that game.

[19:22] I think Ghostbusters sort of knocks everybody down to the same level and everyone is just

[19:28] hanging on.

[19:29] Right?

[19:30] When you play Ghostbusters, you feel like you're sort of just hanging on.

[19:33] And yeah, when you do things, sometimes you feel like you got lucky and the luck is what

[19:38] made you get that score or start that mode or get through the game more.

[19:44] And I hear people complaining and whining saying like, I don't like that.

[19:47] I don't like feeling like it was luck.

[19:49] I wanted to be like my skill that got me there.

[19:51] The pardon is just like, all right, as frustrating as it is, it's also so rewarding because

[19:56] of that.

[19:58] There is that sense of achievement, that sense of, wow, I was able to like hold on long

[20:03] enough to get there or to get that score.

[20:07] And the game's brutality may also be the game's charm.

[20:12] Okay, let me repeat that.

[20:13] I think the brutality of Ghostbusters, the challenging nature of it, might also be what's

[20:19] making it so damn addictive and fun.

[20:23] And I started to think a little bit differently about this.

[20:25] And let me tackle this from another angle.

[20:27] I was there yesterday with two other guys were playing Ghostbusters and they had just

[20:31] a pocket full of quarters.

[20:33] And they were decent players.

[20:37] And I was playing with them.

[20:38] We jumped in and we were all just, we just kept going game after game after game.

[20:42] And pardon me was like, we were all sharing in our gripes about the machine.

[20:46] We were all bitching and moaning about it.

[20:48] And yet we were all like, right back in, another game.

[20:52] Let's go.

[20:53] And some guy kept saying, I just want to get good at this game.

[20:55] I want to get good at Ghostbusters.

[20:57] And I think we all kind of felt that way.

[21:00] But here's another reason why I think this game is kind of genius.

[21:05] When you're playing socially, right, and pinball is a social game, there's nothing less

[21:11] satisfying than when you get on a game with a good player and they spend 15, 20 minutes

[21:17] per ball.

[21:18] And you're just seeing they're waiting.

[21:20] I think that's so boring and I think it sucks.

[21:24] And what I love about Ghostbusters is when you play with a group of people, it's, you're

[21:30] not waiting long.

[21:31] You're right, you're not sticking around waiting forever.

[21:34] And you're kind of like all rooting each other on to get to just multi ball and there's

[21:42] something about it that makes even watching people play more enjoyable because you're

[21:47] not sitting there for an in an inordinate amount of time.

[21:53] It's fast, it's furious, it's frustrating.

[21:56] But I have to say this and I think, you know, when I look at the frustrating column and I

[22:00] think, yeah, there's some really bad design choices in this game.

[22:04] I think certain things could have made it less frustrating.

[22:08] But ultimately, I have to conclude that after I put the fun stuff and the frustrating stuff

[22:15] together, after that equal symbol, I think the game equals just addictive fun.

[22:22] I really do.

[22:23] And I think the people that complain about it, I think the people that moan about Ghostbusters

[22:29] are falling to a few brackets.

[22:31] I think some people are just joyless.

[22:33] I think there's some people out there that just complain about everything.

[22:36] I don't even think any pinball brings these people enjoyment.

[22:39] I think they, if you can't find enjoyment in Ghostbusters, I do think there's something

[22:45] kind of wrong with you because of the music, the art, the theme.

[22:50] It is a game that is just fun.

[22:52] Just even as a spectator to watch all of the colors and the blinking lights and the

[22:58] music, as a deliverable package, it's just fun to be around that game.

[23:05] So I think there's just people out there that are just joyless.

[23:09] And those people, we know who they are, they bitch and moan about everything.

[23:12] Maybe they're stuck in the EM days.

[23:14] Maybe they just hate Stern.

[23:16] But they just can't enjoy anything and they remind us that.

[23:19] And I think you've got your tournament players, your serious guys that are all about points

[23:27] and playing in a tournament and being able to train themselves to have consistent games

[23:32] on machines.

[23:33] So when the time comes and that tournament, they have command over the game.

[23:36] And I think those people, Ghostbusters, but hurts more than anybody else.

[23:40] And I'm going to put Levy in that category.

[23:43] I'm going to put all the tournament league players in that category that just like, they

[23:47] fucking hate this machine for like the reasons that I was talking about with like, so the

[23:53] design flaws, so the scoring problems or the way you start modes.

[23:58] And they fucking hate this machine because of the fact that it doesn't let them have

[24:03] any command over it.

[24:05] And I sort of fucking love Ghostbusters because of that as much as it's brutal.

[24:09] And I talk to Levy just personally.

[24:11] I mean, game's fucking hard, man.

[24:13] I'll tell him, game's brutal, man.

[24:15] And when I hear him like, and why he's so upset about it, I'm like, yeah, like, well,

[24:19] maybe it's fucking time a pinball machine came out that didn't just always cater to these

[24:25] guys that, you know, and I mean, I think that tournament players, the way they tackle

[24:30] machines to get to points and to get to like, you know, super jackpots and destact shit.

[24:37] I honestly personally don't fucking care if those guys are upset about a game because

[24:41] I think those guys also represent like 5% of pinball owners, collectors and players.

[24:47] And to me, what's more important is that you actually can, you know, see more of the

[24:53] game and get to modes.

[24:54] And so that's where I'll say like, I think then the next sort of people are guys like

[24:59] Rare Hero and the collector who's not a great player who loves the theme, who wants to

[25:06] love this pinball machine, but is really frustrated with the inability to progress in

[25:11] the game.

[25:12] And I fall into that category.

[25:13] Like I, I bet if I owned it, I would start to get frustrated because I would constantly

[25:18] be playing the same modes over and over again.

[25:21] And I, I kind of see Rare Hero's gripe now more than ever, having played this machine

[25:27] like 50 times plus, played in LE.

[25:32] But, but I, I think he, you know, if you listen to him and his griping, he's still getting

[25:37] one.

[25:38] And that's the thing.

[25:39] And I think, I think the rest of us sort of fall into that category where there are things

[25:44] about the game that are frustrating.

[25:46] I think we are confident that mods will come out that will prevent the draining from occurring,

[25:53] or being so prevalent.

[25:54] Okay.

[25:55] Now, when I think about those mods, there's one thing I just can't understand.

[26:15] I get that we can, we can get the pinball life plastics that can create a center post and

[26:21] help with the, the out lane hopping and all that shit.

[26:25] But for the life of me, can somebody make flippers that are bigger, that are not ugly like

[26:31] carrot flippers?

[26:32] I get that carrot flippers exist and that stern even has them on their test mule, ghost

[26:39] bussers, that's in the stern lobby area.

[26:41] But why do, why do carrot flippers look like carrots with those rivets in them?

[26:46] I think that's freaking ugly.

[26:48] Can somebody please make carrot flippers?

[26:50] Bigger flippers that look like normal flippers so we don't have to have ugly flippers as the

[26:57] only option.

[26:58] I think whoever markets or makes carrot flippers is idiotic.

[27:02] Just make them look like normal big flippers, call them con flippers, whatever the fuck you

[27:05] want to call them.

[27:07] But if someone made those, I think, you know, people would install them.

[27:11] And the fact that there are some design issues that could use some mod help to make easier,

[27:17] you know, I don't think it's cheating.

[27:19] I think the center post is cheating.

[27:21] I don't want to put a center post in.

[27:23] I really do.

[27:24] It wasn't designed to have a center post and if you put one in, I don't know, it's like

[27:28] having a bike with training wheels.

[27:30] Do you really want to be that adult who needs that?

[27:34] And I get it for you guys who buy this machine and in your family's find it frustrating.

[27:39] I, that's what I'm worried about.

[27:41] Is Brenda likes Tales of the Rebian Knights and we have fun games playing together?

[27:46] I think she would hate Ghostbusters because of how frustrating it is.

[27:51] I think she would just walk away because I can't see her getting a new machine that would

[27:55] drain that often.

[27:57] She has hard time with even Tales of the Rebian Knights just trapping the ball, you know,

[28:01] she does this thing where whenever the ball's rolling, she often like tries to trap and

[28:06] it rolls over the edge.

[28:07] Now when you try to trap and Ghostbusters, the ball has a tendency to roll over.

[28:11] There is no saving it.

[28:12] Like it's going down the middle.

[28:13] It's going down the pipe.

[28:16] But look, I, I'm back and forth.

[28:19] After I came out yesterday, I was frustrated and I still think I want to sell it.

[28:23] But then I woke up this morning and I want to keep it.

[28:25] And I just think it's just that kind of game that there's going to be days where you hate

[28:29] it.

[28:30] There's going to be days where you love it.

[28:31] But I'll say this.

[28:33] People saying is it the top 10 top 20 would know.

[28:36] I look, I don't think you can rank games ever in this way.

[28:42] But I'll say this.

[28:43] Ghostbusters to me when it comes to fun, right?

[28:47] And I don't know how you rank your games, but I tend to rank my toys and how fun they

[28:50] are, not anything else.

[28:53] I don't think you're going to find a game that's as addictive as Ghostbusters that's

[28:58] out there that keeps you coming back for more of the way Ghostbusters does because it hits

[29:02] you so immediately with this art and this music and the callouts and these shots and

[29:08] it's challenging.

[29:09] And it just, I don't know.

[29:10] This says like, yeah, you think you're a fucking pinball player?

[29:14] Like here you are.

[29:15] Try to capture some ghosts.

[29:17] Like come back for more, but it just has this come back for more quality that no other

[29:21] pin has.

[29:22] It's sunshine.

[29:23] And we're talking like, you know, ACDC black and back in black edition, Spider-Man,

[29:29] black edition.

[29:30] We're talking the best games.

[29:31] They have the top 20 games are there.

[29:34] And Ghostbusters is more addictive than any of them.

[29:37] And maybe it's just because it's new.

[29:39] And I think that could be a big thing, right?

[29:42] And that's another reality, guys, is games get old and still and boring.

[29:45] I'm sorry, but you can't tell me that owning Adam's family for 10 years, it doesn't kind

[29:52] to get stale after a while.

[29:54] Any game will get still and boring, including Ghostbusters will get still and boring.

[29:59] So part of the thing is we are attracted to just new games that are new challenges and

[30:05] new experiences.

[30:07] And I think that's why it's stupid to just hold on to games for 10, 20 years because

[30:11] you're going to get bored of them.

[30:13] It's a toy, it's a game.

[30:16] And then the next thing I'll say is I think Ghostbusters is going to have an interesting

[30:23] Paris into one pin and one pin only in the next few months.

[30:26] And that's Batman 66.

[30:29] Because I think Batman 66 is also another iconic older theme.

[30:34] That's a fun theme, fun music, it's going to have fun colorful artwork.

[30:38] But if Batman is not as difficult and not as frustrating, I could easily see people

[30:44] saying they love Batman more than Ghostbusters.

[30:47] And that is going to be what I'm most interested to compare it to because Ghostbusters fucking

[30:54] hard game, but fucking addictively fun in a way that I think I kind of described.

[31:02] But that's my experience.

[31:04] Ghostbusters, there's Ellie to me, there's a siren coming, maybe it's the Ectawon, do

[31:07] you hear it?

[31:08] I don't know if you hear that.

[31:09] But that's my experience with Ghostbusters, Ellie.

[31:11] I think it's a winner, I think it's brutal, I think it's got some really bad design flaws,

[31:17] but I think they become like characteristics of the game that make it strangely endearing

[31:24] and make it strangely addictive.

[31:27] And it will piss off people like Levy and the tournament players who want to have control.

[31:32] But I'm kind of happy that those guys are pissed off and that when I play a match with

[31:36] them and their friends, I'm not waiting around for 20 minutes.

[31:40] I think Trudeau designed a game that makes it like a kind of like, yeah, like you think

[31:47] you're good, like fucking think again, kind of game.

[31:51] But you know what, I'm going to make you smile with what's in front of you in terms

[31:56] of the art, the music and whatnot.

[31:58] And I don't think we're going to see another art package nearly as nice as Ghostbusters

[32:02] until Zombie Eddie does his next, his next pinball for Stern.

[32:06] So that's my assessment.

[32:07] I'm sorry that went on longer than I thought.

[32:08] It was a half hour.

[32:09] I just kept talking.

[32:10] I got excited.

[32:11] But right now, I think I'm going to keep my Ghostbusters, Ellie.

[32:16] And I think I'm going to join the fun frustrating party that is known as Ghostbusters.

[32:20] And I think all of you guys getting premiums are going to fucking love this pinball machine.

[32:25] I think it's going to make older pinball machines seem old.

[32:29] I think it's going to make other games and collections seem a little bit better.

[32:32] The boring, a little bit long winded and a little bit outdated.

[32:37] And I think Ghostbusters is what I've been saying all along.

[32:41] What's exciting in pinball is the current stuff and the stuff coming down the line.

[32:45] I think remakes to me pointless.

[32:48] Why do you want to go back and get a attack from Mars?

[32:51] Why do you want to go back and get a cactus canyon again?

[32:53] I'm sorry, but these games and the future of pinball is where the excitement lies.

[32:58] And to look backwards and remake stuff, go ahead.

[33:02] At $10,000 a pop, $8,000 a pop, I want something new.

[33:05] I don't want something that's been sitting around forever.

[33:08] So I think Stern has a home run on their hands.

[33:10] I think Batman's going to be a home run.

[33:12] I think the Playfield issues have been blown a little bit out of proportion

[33:16] and they'll fix the people that have chips.

[33:18] But a little bit of Ghost in inserts, that's normal.

[33:21] Dimples normal.

[33:23] We all need to stop looking at these Playfields with magnifying glasses being like,

[33:27] I'm a collector and I want this thing to stay perfect forever.

[33:29] It's a game.

[33:30] Does it flip?

[33:32] Does everything work?

[33:34] Are the switches registering?

[33:35] That's what's important.

[33:37] Don't look at your Playfield and try to get all Ben out of shape out of every little ghosted

[33:42] and sort of little scratch here and there.

[33:43] It's going to get those.

[33:46] So guys, have a good week at work.

[33:49] I'm trying to get an individual who worked on Magic Girl to talk this week.

[33:54] If we can line that up, that's going to be amazing.

[33:57] If not, I know me in Blake.

[34:00] Blake, who's the art director for Domino's Pinball.

[34:03] We're going to talk about what Pinball is going to be like in the next 10 years.

[34:07] There's some other fun topics we're going to discuss.

[34:09] Blake's going to come on the show in the next couple of weeks.

[34:11] Have a good Tuesday.

[34:13] I know everyone's sort of depressed.

[34:14] We're back from the long weekend.

[34:15] But nothing curious depression, like a little Canada's Pinball podcast.

[34:20] Have a good day.
