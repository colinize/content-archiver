[00:00] Oh, welcome everybody to Canadi's Pinball Podcast.

[00:13] Happy Holidays!

[00:14] How is everybody doing?

[00:16] We are right on the eve of Christmas.

[00:19] It is the end of another pinball year and you know what we love to do at Canadi's Pinball

[00:24] Podcast.

[00:25] If you'd like to look back at what happened in the pinball world, was it a great year

[00:29] in pinball?

[00:31] What if I told you that like 13 pinball machines came out in 2024?

[00:38] In the year in which pinball has been the most expensive it's ever been.

[00:42] And I'm here to tell you right now when you go down the list of games that came out.

[00:47] What this hobby has put into the marketplace.

[00:50] I have to be completely candid.

[00:53] It is embarrassing how bad this hobby has missed the mark again.

[00:59] It's like the last two years when pinball prices went through the roof all the market

[01:04] research went out the window.

[01:06] So I think each and every one of us, we don't think pinball is dead.

[01:10] We don't think FOMO is completely over.

[01:13] But the days of these mediocre themes, the days of these high prices, the days of these

[01:18] pinball companies think anything that goes into a box is going to get bought regardless

[01:24] of the code, regardless of the mechanical issues, regardless if it's like the 18th Marvel

[01:30] title, those days are over.

[01:34] And we're looking for new magic in pinball, but it needs to be based on themes we really

[01:39] want.

[01:40] And I think that's the overarching theme.

[01:42] I think as we look to 2025, we start to get really excited about stuff like Harry Potter,

[01:49] the sternum of Super Mario Brothers.

[01:51] Are we going to see the Matrix?

[01:53] Are we going to see King Kong?

[01:55] What else is going to come out?

[01:57] We know Spooky Pinball might have the Goonies.

[01:59] We know Barrels of Fun.

[02:00] Remember, they're not included in this year's games because Labyrinth was a 2023 reveal and

[02:06] release.

[02:08] So what's around the corner from them?

[02:10] We know they're going to do something that's nostalgic and based on a property most likely

[02:15] from the 80s.

[02:16] But we're not talking about next year right now.

[02:19] We're talking about this year.

[02:20] And here's what Canada's going to do.

[02:22] We're going to do two shows.

[02:23] I'm going to do the best of 2024.

[02:26] We're going to call it the Canada Kudos Awards.

[02:28] And I'm going to go down a list of what I think was the best in pinball this year.

[02:34] And I'll give you the categories.

[02:35] Best sound.

[02:37] Best toys and mechanisms.

[02:39] Best animations and display.

[02:42] Best rules.

[02:43] Best topper.

[02:44] Best theme.

[02:46] Best theme integration.

[02:48] Best call outs.

[02:49] Best launch and reveal.

[02:52] The coolest company in pinball.

[02:53] I think we should give an award to who's the coolest company in pinball that's the best

[02:57] member of the community.

[02:59] The best artwork in pinball.

[03:01] The best gameplay and layout.

[03:04] And the game of the year.

[03:06] So that's going to happen most likely later this week as we head towards New Year's.

[03:11] Now what's going to happen on this episode is we're going to do the opposite.

[03:15] I'm going to tell you what I think is the worst in each of these categories.

[03:19] Who hasn't done it right.

[03:21] Who really failed horribly when it comes to executing these things.

[03:26] And I think my responses might surprise you on some of what I select.

[03:30] I'm just going to take companies like Home Pin off the table.

[03:35] There was no new game from American Pinball.

[03:38] So the companies that get represented will be the companies that have either revealed

[03:43] or released games in 2024.

[03:47] Now let's go down the list of who is eligible for the worst of pinball in 2024 based solely

[03:53] on Canada's opinions.

[03:55] We've got Stern pinball.

[03:57] They released Jaws in January.

[03:59] John Wick in May.

[04:01] Uncanny X-Men in September.

[04:03] And Metallica remastered in October.

[04:06] We've got Spooky Pinball, Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[04:10] I'm going to include in this list.

[04:12] They came out in December.

[04:14] I'm also going to include Evil Dead because Spooky Pinball because their games come out

[04:19] in December.

[04:20] It's like no man's land for the awards.

[04:23] I think they're all going to get mixed in together.

[04:25] Jersey Jack Pinball has Avatar that came out in September.

[04:29] Multimorphic had the Princess Bride revealed in February.

[04:33] Padredy Gaming had Funhouse Remake in May.

[04:37] Pinball Brothers had ABBA in April.

[04:39] Dutch Pinball X revealed Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in October.

[04:44] And Turner Pinball had Ninja Eclipse in March.

[04:48] So when you add all those up and that's not including Labyrinth which came out in 2023.

[04:54] It's also not including any Pulp Fictions.

[04:56] Nothing in here from Pinball Adventures.

[04:58] It's 13 games, 13 games ladies and gentlemen.

[05:02] 13 freaking games.

[05:04] And that is just bonkers to me.

[05:06] That when you go down this list, how many of these games do you really want to own?

[05:11] How many of these games are worth the money?

[05:14] How many of these games have improved upon what we've had before in the world of Pinball?

[05:19] And you tell me that all these Pinball companies don't need Canada as their chief marketing

[05:25] officer.

[05:26] There's no way that Pinball should be here in 2024.

[05:31] It's embarrassing.

[05:32] Let's be honest.

[05:33] That is an embarrassing list of themes.

[05:36] When you look at the target demographic, the people that these companies need to be selling

[05:41] to, this is a horrendous list of titles, I think.

[05:46] Overall, in the world of Pinball.

[05:49] All right.

[05:50] So let's go down and start to hand out the awards for the worst in 2024.

[05:56] So let's start out with the worst sound in a game.

[06:01] So sound package is always interesting, right?

[06:04] Because sometimes the best sound package goes to like ACDC or Foo Fighters.

[06:09] But what game out there would you say when you play it doesn't have the best sound?

[06:15] Oh, going down this list, this one's a little bit tricky for me.

[06:20] This one's a little bit tricky for me because the way I'm going to do this, here's my criteria,

[06:25] is like, did something miss really badly in this category when it should have nailed it?

[06:31] Because to me, that's how I'm going to come to some of my conclusions on this award show.

[06:36] So in all these games, I think the worst sound, and because when this game launched, really

[06:43] the music turned a lot of people off, the award for worst sound package in a Pinball

[06:49] machine goes to the Uncanny X-Men.

[06:54] You know, it's still a head scratcher how when they revealed this game, they've got

[06:58] that iconic theme song and it was not included on the launch of the game.

[07:04] I still don't think the music in that game is really getting people going and it should have.

[07:11] Like based on the theme, the Uncanny X-Men should have much better sound than it does.

[07:17] Alright, so what are the worst toys and mechanisms in a game?

[07:21] Which game, when we look at all these titles, has the least inspiring stuff happening on the play field?

[07:29] Okay, I'm looking at this, right?

[07:31] Worst toys and mechs in a game.

[07:34] Now, if I go down this list, there's not much in Turner Pinball's Ninja Clips, but I don't think that's the worst.

[07:40] Again, I'm going after what should have been loaded with toys and mechs and what is coming up way short.

[07:47] The award, this was between two titles.

[07:50] The award for the worst toys and mechanisms in a pinball machine goes to...

[07:58] It was neck and neck between John Wick, but the winner is going to be Avatar.

[08:04] How do you make an Avatar pinball machine that costs $12,000 to $15,000?

[08:12] And there's not a single toy in the game.

[08:15] There's not a single toy in the game.

[08:17] I know it has mechs and diverters, but for all the source material, the fact that these guys didn't put a single toy in the game that really interacts with the ball, they should be ashamed.

[08:30] Even John Wick has a captive ball connected to the Mustang.

[08:35] John Wick's toys are pretty damn bad too, but there are still at least toys that interact with the ball.

[08:42] Jersey Jack, you should be ashamed.

[08:43] Mark Sidon, I mean it.

[08:45] You're a really good guy, but man, you got to go back to the drawing board.

[08:48] A toy and mech needs to interact with the ball much better than what you put into Avatar.

[08:53] So what were the worst animations and display in a pinball machine?

[08:59] Even as I do this, I'm like, this doesn't really feel like the holiday spirit.

[09:03] We're going down the worst that's happening in pinball.

[09:06] So what was the worst?

[09:08] What machine, when you looked at the animations, did you just say, oh, what is happening here?

[09:14] Now I know a lot of you want me to vote for X-Men on this.

[09:18] It's not the worst.

[09:20] Come on, gang, you're too tough on the X-Men animations.

[09:23] I think what makes the X-Men animations come across much worse than they actually are is the lack of music or good call-outs in the game.

[09:33] And I think that's what's making you think those animations are terrible, but man, they're not the worst.

[09:39] I'm just going to say that.

[09:40] So as I look down here, the animations are always good in Avatar.

[09:44] Princess Bride is good.

[09:46] I think the worst animations, I would have to give the worst animations in a pinball machine, I think, is ABBA.

[09:55] Go watch an ABBA stream.

[09:57] There's nothing to write home about with those animations in that game.

[10:02] Again, I just think it's 2024 and animations and display should just have a lot more fun stuff going on.

[10:09] You might argue for Funhaus Remake, but again, I don't know.

[10:12] If you've got an LCD screen, the animations should be better.

[10:16] All right, so what are the worst rules in the game?

[10:19] This gets a little tricky.

[10:20] The worst rules in a pinball machine, it's hard, right?

[10:24] Because I would say that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the rules said it's not really that flushed out.

[10:33] Is it the worst?

[10:34] Maybe not because you don't really have expectations of what you want that rule set to be.

[10:42] The worst rule set in all of pinball.

[10:45] And I think the worst rule set, and I'm just going to say this, I think this is a coin toss for me between Avatar and X-Men.

[10:54] And I want to explain why I think these two rule sets are really at the top of my worst list.

[11:00] First and foremost, Avatar is just way too confusing, all the stuff that Keith puts into that game.

[11:06] When they hand out, here's the rule sets, here's 22 different song notes you need to collect, and here's all these different things.

[11:13] It's just not fun.

[11:15] I'm just tired of Jersey Jack rule sets that require you to study this humongous diner menu to understand how to play the game.

[11:24] That's not pinball.

[11:26] I've owned Guns N' Roses now.

[11:28] I've played it like hundreds of times.

[11:30] I still don't like how complex it is, why are there so many patches?

[11:34] I'm still not 100% sure how to play the game, and I don't like that.

[11:38] It shouldn't be that confusing.

[11:40] When I owned Batman, I knew how to play the game.

[11:43] When you own a Metallica, you know how to play the game.

[11:45] And I think Avatar is just way too complex, but that's not the worst.

[11:50] But I have to give the worst rule set to X-Men.

[11:53] This game's rule set is really the number one reason why people are just so upset with this game.

[11:59] The game is beautiful.

[12:01] The game's got a really creative layout.

[12:04] It just doesn't come together with the rule set.

[12:06] If there ever was a game that needed the rule set and needed the code to sort of live up and tie together this really ambitious game, it was this game.

[12:18] And it needs a major overhaul.

[12:20] And so that is why X-Men wins for worst pinball rule set of 2024.

[12:27] And I think a lot of people would agree with that.

[12:29] I don't know if Jack Danger's gonna sebi-sub holiday wishes, but it's not his fault.

[12:33] It really is not his fault.

[12:35] The software encoding department is really what let this game down.

[12:39] What's the worst topper in pinball?

[12:42] I'm trying to think which one of these games even has a topper that comes included that is not very good.

[12:50] Alright, so this one's easy.

[12:52] The worst topper in pinball, because it sits on top of one of the most beautiful games that has ever come out,

[12:58] is Stern Pinball's Metallica topper.

[13:01] OMG, did they just fall asleep at the wheel designing this thing?

[13:05] It's like they just ran out of ideas.

[13:07] They've got the most beautiful art package on this game.

[13:10] They use nothing from that artist in the topper itself.

[13:15] It's $1,000.

[13:17] And all they could do was like put Metallica up there in title alone with like some sling plastic flasher caps.

[13:24] It is so cheaply done.

[13:27] It looks way too small.

[13:29] It looks like Stonehenge from Spinal Tap sitting on top of that game.

[13:33] They should be so embarrassed that on this beautiful game, that's the best they could do.

[13:39] And it's $1,000 people.

[13:42] No moving parts, nothing interesting in it.

[13:45] No beautiful sculpts.

[13:47] Get the f out of town that that thing costs twice as much as an Xbox.

[13:52] Alright, so next is the worst theme in pinball.

[13:56] What's the worst theme in pinball?

[13:59] This one is where it gets fun.

[14:01] Which one is it?

[14:03] You know, ah man, I'm looking at the list.

[14:06] I'm looking at everything that's come out this year.

[14:09] It's almost like you don't want to be called out on this show at all.

[14:13] If you don't hear your name, it's actually going to be the one Canadian pinball podcast where you're happy he did not mention you.

[14:20] The worst theme of pinball in 2024, hands down easily without a doubt, is Jersey Jack's avatar.

[14:33] What were they thinking?

[14:35] Zero market research.

[14:38] Second would absolutely be John Wick.

[14:41] But when it comes to worst, it's Jersey Jack.

[14:45] Because Stern can have a John Wick and surround it with these other games that will sell.

[14:50] But Jersey Jack only makes one game.

[14:53] They need to get it right.

[14:54] They can't whiff on the theme and avatar as a movie franchise.

[15:00] I get the movie might make two billion at the box office, but it is not a film that you and I think about.

[15:07] We don't talk to each other about it.

[15:09] We don't quote that movie.

[15:10] You couldn't even name four characters from the movie, not even three characters.

[15:15] And so for Jersey Jack to think that we want it in Avatar Pinball Machine in 2024,

[15:23] when there's like three more movies coming out and the narrative is not done,

[15:28] and this battle for Navi, like none of it, right?

[15:31] This battle for Pandora, none of it should have been made.

[15:36] And so that is why Jersey Jack wins for Worst Theme.

[15:41] Now, what's next?

[15:42] Worst Theme Integration.

[15:45] Should Avatar also win Worst Theme Integration?

[15:50] You know, looking down this list, the answer is no.

[15:54] It's not going to win Worst Theme Integration.

[15:57] This one's easy.

[15:58] What game came out that didn't feature the main thing that the damn character uses

[16:06] in every single minute of the film to kill every single bad guy?

[16:11] John Wick Without Guns is hands down easily maybe the worst pinball theme integration of all time.

[16:19] The fact that they released John Wick With No Guns,

[16:23] one of the worst theme integrated decisions of all time,

[16:27] I don't care if the studio demanded they make it that way.

[16:31] They never should have made it if the studio wouldn't let them put guns

[16:35] in the artwork on the translate in the game itself.

[16:40] So easily John Wick wins for the Worst Theme Integrated Pinball Machine of 2024.

[16:46] All right, what's next?

[16:47] The Worst Callouts in all of pinball.

[16:50] The Worst Callouts.

[16:51] I know what you're thinking.

[16:52] I'm going to give it to X-Men.

[16:54] I'm not the worst callouts in pinball in 2024 goes to Funhouse Remake.

[17:02] If you listen to Funhouse Remake Callouts, that new voice for Rudy, it is just nails on a chalkboard.

[17:11] I mean it.

[17:12] It's not good.

[17:14] It is worse than anything happening in X-Men.

[17:18] It would make me not want to own it.

[17:20] So I give the worst callouts to Rudy's Nightmare from Prodretti Gaming.

[17:26] We got to mix it up a little bit people, right?

[17:29] All right, the best lawn.

[17:30] What was the worst launch in all of pinball?

[17:33] This one's interesting.

[17:34] You know, which game came out and had the worst launch?

[17:39] Now, I would argue that this is a tricky one, right?

[17:42] This is very subjective.

[17:44] Which game came out and poorly revealed itself to the world?

[17:50] A lot of these games come out like they just come out, right?

[17:52] There's no real missteps.

[17:55] They just reveal the game.

[17:56] They show you the photos.

[17:57] There's not a lot of drama.

[17:59] There's not a lot of backlash.

[18:01] But when it comes to the worst launch in pinball this year,

[18:04] I think there's two for me that rise to the top.

[18:07] I think one of them is Dutch pinball X's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[18:14] I mean, the way this game was revealed, Barry streaming the game in a dark room.

[18:19] Me and Kari did our best to try to get people hyped around this game.

[18:22] But the fact that there was never any real effort put into a good stream of the game

[18:27] or a good video of the game, and then they had their own employees draining left and right,

[18:34] it was really rough.

[18:35] Now, even though they sold out of all those titles,

[18:39] it still was one of the worst reveals I've ever seen in pinball,

[18:43] and they need to get their act together.

[18:44] But that's not going to be number one.

[18:47] Number one has to be John Wick.

[18:49] Again, the reason why is I've never seen a game come out that angered people so much.

[18:55] It led to Gungate and all the debate around it, and it completely destroyed this game's ability

[19:02] to ever be welcomed or accepted by the pinball buying demographic.

[19:07] It's earned how to turn on their issues in crisis and invite all these media into stern

[19:12] to try to salvage the game.

[19:15] It didn't work.

[19:15] They invited all these pinball media.

[19:17] They gave them the song and the dance, and they tried to hoodwink them with shiny decals and

[19:23] mirror trans lights, but in the end, this game never recovered from its really poor launch.

[19:30] And I don't think I've seen more negativity around a new stern game than I saw around John Wick.

[19:36] All right, so that's the worst reveal.

[19:38] The coolest company in pinball.

[19:40] You know, we're going to get to that one later this week.

[19:42] So who's the lamest company right now?

[19:45] Who's just not doing it right?

[19:47] Who's not transparent?

[19:49] Who's this?

[19:50] Who's that?

[19:51] I mean, it's hard, right?

[19:53] It's hard.

[19:53] In 2024, who wins for the lamest company in pinball?

[19:58] I mean, I have to give this award to Haggis.

[20:02] There's a few other people that could definitely be contenders on this.

[20:06] In all the pinball, Haggis Pinball is the only one that people lost money on.

[20:12] No other pinball company did you lose money on.

[20:15] Nobody really lied to you.

[20:17] These guys collapsed in 2024.

[20:21] I hate to say I told you so, but man, it's over.

[20:24] It's over.

[20:24] And look, mark my words, people.

[20:27] Marty Robbins is going to try to recover and come back into this hobby next year.

[20:32] And it's not going to work.

[20:34] It's not going to work.

[20:34] I can't wait for Jeff Teolos and Marty to try to do some sort of like convalescence tour in 2025.

[20:42] And the reason why, Marty, I'll tell you this right now, we will accept you back

[20:47] if you and Damien figure out a way to make everybody whole.

[20:51] Until that day happens, we don't want to see anything from you.

[20:56] Okay.

[20:56] So that's the lamest company, Haggis Pinball.

[20:58] I think we all can agree on that.

[21:00] So what was the worst artwork in pinball?

[21:03] If you look at these machines and you just say, man, what were they thinking there?

[21:08] This one is easy.

[21:09] I came to this conclusion right away.

[21:10] The worst art package in all of pinball in 2024 is ABBA.

[21:16] I mean, when you look at that ABBA cabinet, I mean the standard ABBA cabinet,

[21:21] it looks like Killian made it.

[21:23] Like they didn't even try.

[21:25] And it doesn't make any sense.

[21:27] How are you going to, with a straight face, release something like that and ask people

[21:34] to pay thousands of dollars for it?

[21:37] They should be embarrassed that they greenlit that.

[21:41] And the band ABBA should be absolutely chastised for approving such a terrible looking game.

[21:49] All right.

[21:50] So that's the worst artwork.

[21:52] Trust me, gang.

[21:53] The best stuff is going to be more fun than this because it's going to be positive

[21:56] and good vibes and good energy.

[21:58] All right.

[21:58] So we got the worst gameplay layout and then the worst game of the year.

[22:02] All right.

[22:02] We're going to close this out.

[22:04] So which game has the worst layout and gameplay out of all of these games?

[22:11] Oh, man, it's hard, right?

[22:13] Okay.

[22:13] So I'm going to be objective here.

[22:15] I'm going to be objective.

[22:17] I'm looking at all of these games and I've pretty much shot all of these games.

[22:21] And when it comes to just worst layout, I, and don't kill me because this game is sold out.

[22:29] But again, when it comes to worst layout and gameplay as of today, and I played it and I

[22:36] played everything here, and it's mainly because they took a design and a layout that was never

[22:42] really a real game.

[22:44] It was simply meant to be a foam core thing that J-pop could put Zombie Eddie's artwork on

[22:52] to keep his Ponzi scheme going.

[22:54] And yet Melvin did pull off the impossible and turn it into a working game.

[22:59] But that doesn't mean the gameplay is great.

[23:02] And so I hate to say it.

[23:04] I hate to say this to all you guys who ordered one.

[23:06] And I have one on order too.

[23:07] But when it comes to a bad layout, you know, there's just not much happening in this game

[23:14] from a layout standpoint.

[23:16] It is not going to blow you away with design and layout.

[23:19] And I think every other game on this list is going to shoot more like a standard pinball machine.

[23:26] And so that is why Canada has to give Alice's Adventures in Wonderland the worst layout.

[23:33] And again, it's not on Melvin.

[23:35] He just made what J-pop designed into a real game.

[23:39] And Melvin, you know, I love you, brother.

[23:41] You know, I love you, brother.

[23:42] But man, it just doesn't have the flow of what these other games have.

[23:47] I have to give it to Alice.

[23:49] But it doesn't matter, right?

[23:50] Because this thing never was about gameplay.

[23:52] It never was about layout.

[23:55] It was about a rare collectible work of art and the story that goes with it.

[24:00] And that's why they sold out.

[24:01] Remember, they sold out of this game even after people played it.

[24:04] It had long lines at the show.

[24:07] But I was there.

[24:07] Like people weren't coming off this game raving about the layout.

[24:12] And if you go from like Alice to X-Men or John Wick or Metallica or Looney Tunes or Avatar

[24:18] or Princess Bride, like they're just all going to shoot better.

[24:21] All right.

[24:22] Now, what's the worst game of the year out of all these games?

[24:27] What is the worst game of the year?

[24:31] Oh, this one's hard.

[24:33] Because when it comes to the worst game of the year, how do you come to this conclusion?

[24:38] Is it the worst shooting game?

[24:41] Is it the game that's going to be the least amount of fun?

[24:45] Is it the game that just failed to live up the expectations?

[24:49] It's really hard, right?

[24:50] We also have to factor in, are you getting your value?

[24:53] Is it worth the money?

[24:55] You know, I struggle with this one.

[24:58] I almost don't even want to give a worst game of the year.

[25:01] I'll make it more this.

[25:03] What is the worst possible game you could buy in New Inbox out of all the games in 2024?

[25:10] Okay.

[25:11] I think that's a more fair way to do it.

[25:14] And the worst game you could buy New Inbox in 2024, drumroll please, is a $15,000 Avatar CE.

[25:27] If you buy this game, New Inbox for 15,000 people,

[25:31] we're looking at Godfather's right now, which had more hype and enthusiasm for it than even Avatar does.

[25:38] They're now worth less than like 9,800 New Inbox.

[25:42] People have lost over $5,000 on it.

[25:46] And if Harry Potter is around the corner, I do think Avatar CE for $15,000

[25:53] is just the worst New Inbox game you can buy in 2024.

[25:58] The second worst would be John Wick LE.

[26:02] That's going to lose the most amount of value for sure.

[26:05] And then Uncanny X-Men.

[26:07] You know, this is the problem now, everybody.

[26:10] These games are so expensive.

[26:12] Now look, is Avatar the worst game here?

[26:15] Absolutely not.

[26:16] I know this.

[26:17] You know what I'm saying?

[26:17] Like it's a better game than Alice and Ninja Eclipse.

[26:23] And it's a better game than ABBA.

[26:25] So if I were just to say like, well, what's the worst game?

[26:28] Maybe I'll do that.

[26:29] Like that's the worst buy as Avatar.

[26:31] The worst game out of all of these, you know, just looking at all things considered would be ABBA.

[26:38] I do.

[26:39] I mean, there's just nothing about it.

[26:41] Like a music pin doesn't have much in it.

[26:44] It's a day late and a dollar short.

[26:47] It's not a theme that most people want.

[26:49] And music pins are so good.

[26:51] And so I just look at ABBA as like out of all these games.

[26:55] I think the response to ABBA has been the weakest.

[26:58] I think people just really don't care.

[27:01] I would be shocked if they even sold out of this game and they're not even making many of them.

[27:07] And again, I hope that pinball brothers is going to respond with something like Predator.

[27:13] I heard they might have an Arnold movie next.

[27:16] And I would love to see these guys do something that we really want the theme.

[27:21] Everybody, it's going to be more fun on the next episode.

[27:25] Thank you for tuning in for Canada's the worst in pinball in 2024.

[27:31] And I just want to say overall, all of these companies got a lot of work to do.

[27:35] Their marketing departments need to pick better themes.

[27:38] Their designers need to put more toys into these games.

[27:41] And we need pinball to really get much better in 2025.

[27:46] The themes are going to be there, but will they execute them on the right level?

[27:50] They need to be amazing, everybody.

[27:52] For this much money, you should be looking down at games.

[27:56] Load it.

[27:57] Load it like Twilight Zone and load it like Lord of the Rings.

[28:01] And the games need to be masterpieces.

[28:03] Who the heck wants to keep throwing 10 to 13 to $15,000 at hugely depreciating games?

[28:11] And let's not make a mistake, people.

[28:12] These games are hugely depreciating because they're not amazing.

[28:17] If Jersey Jack released Back to the Future, you'd be paying $18,000 for a CE now,

[28:23] even if they made $1,000 CE's.

[28:26] So don't fool yourself.

[28:27] It's because the themes are bad and the games are uninspired.

[28:31] And that's why these games are sinking.

[28:34] Jaws LE, you can't find one because it's a good theme and it's designed well and the code's amazing.

[28:39] And so that game will hold its value or go up in value over time

[28:43] as more crap comes out into the market.

[28:45] Happy holidays, Monday, Canada out.
