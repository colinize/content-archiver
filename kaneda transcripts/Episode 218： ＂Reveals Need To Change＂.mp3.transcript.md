[00:00] I don't even think I know what day of the week it is anymore.

[00:25] I think it's Tuesday and I think it's March something and I think this is episode 218 of

[00:32] Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[00:33] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:34] I just got back from Atlanta last night.

[00:37] I've been on a little bit of a whirlwind tour from Texas to Atlanta.

[00:41] I went right from Texas Spinball Festival into a conference room in the W Hotel in Atlanta

[00:49] where I had to rehearse for two days for a new business pitch with some big company to

[00:55] Atlanta.

[00:56] I can't say which one.

[00:57] I went really well.

[00:59] Thingers crossed is what I do for a living.

[01:01] It's what makes me be able to consider buying pinball.

[01:05] I wanted to share some thoughts I had sort of coming out of TPS and I think I got some

[01:12] podcast up when I was there.

[01:15] I think you could hear the fatigue in my voice.

[01:17] You could hear the background noise of the airport and I think now that the dust has

[01:23] settled, now that I've been able to read some of the commentary on pin sites surrounding

[01:28] TPS, I wanted to share some additional thoughts about pinball, about these shows, about

[01:37] manufacturers and how they reveal their products at these big shows.

[01:41] I wanted to just now that I've taken it all in, now that I've seen how it's done, I

[01:46] want to give my opinion about if I feel that pinball deserves more when it comes to how

[01:52] these games are revealed.

[01:54] I want to explain why.

[01:58] Here's the thing.

[01:59] I think from a very, if we zoom out, a lot of us go to these pinball shows, we invest money,

[02:06] we travel to these shows, not to play the games that we can play locally or like at our

[02:12] friends' houses.

[02:14] We also do go to see reveals of new machines.

[02:17] I think it's a very exciting time.

[02:19] Of course we go to hang out with our friends and other pinball nerds and drink and shoot

[02:24] the shit and eat barbecue food and whatnot.

[02:27] Do all the stuff we boys do when the women aren't around.

[02:32] I always say when I look at TPS, I'm like all these guys are so happy.

[02:36] Because they don't have to eat their wives cooking for three days.

[02:39] That's why they're so excited.

[02:40] They can go to Perry's Steakhouse and Wild Pitch.

[02:44] Boy is that place creepy.

[02:46] Avoid Wild Pitch and like these women and these bikinis.

[02:49] I always feel bad when I'm in there.

[02:50] I want to get out of there and like just jump into a pool of hand sanitizers when I leave

[02:56] that joint.

[02:57] But anyway, so we go there to see new games.

[03:01] I've been thinking more and more about how these new games are shown to the world.

[03:06] If we look at TPS this year, the new games that were revealed were Alice Cooper's Night

[03:11] Mirror Castle, Kingpin, trying to think if there was anything else that was Cosmic

[03:18] Cart Racing by P3.

[03:21] And I want to talk about how these games are first shown to us.

[03:26] And if showing them the way they're showing at these shows is the effective way to launch

[03:32] these titles.

[03:33] To give people the experience they need and the content they need to accurately convey

[03:39] back to everyone else in the world what the game is all about.

[03:43] And I want to take Alice Cooper's Night Mirror Castle, for example, because I think that

[03:49] was the big reveal of the show.

[03:51] And if we think about what this reveal is doing, it's showing the world for the first

[03:58] time a game that Charlie and Company have been working really hard on for over a year.

[04:03] And this is the first time they're going to pull the curtain off the game.

[04:07] And so I want to tackle this from a few angles.

[04:10] I want to tackle it from the angle of was this the right time to show the game because

[04:15] of the lack of code that was in the game, right?

[04:19] And that's a question I think we all struggle with as pinball fans is we really want to see

[04:24] what's next.

[04:26] But we all know that a pinball machine is more than just the visual representation of

[04:32] the pinball machine.

[04:33] I mean look what happened when Stern revealed Batman 66 to the world and said, hey, here

[04:38] it is, but you can't play it.

[04:39] The code's not far enough along for you to play it.

[04:42] And Lyman and George Goldman has made that decision to show the game in a non playable

[04:48] format.

[04:49] And they were not really chastised for that.

[04:51] But I think what got Stern in trouble is that game ended up shipping to customers with

[04:57] code that was nowhere near where it needed to be to go into people's homes and especially

[05:02] not on location.

[05:04] So that was I think the issue that plagued Batman.

[05:07] But so Charlie releases this real step up for spooky pinball a lot more in this game,

[05:13] a lot more of a visual package, a lot more sort of blood sweat and tears clearly went

[05:18] into Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[05:21] But we got to see something that really visually was a while.

[05:26] But from a code standpoint, it really not much in there, not a lot of the game there,

[05:31] not a lot of the features working.

[05:34] And so was that the right thing to do?

[05:37] And I'm not necessarily sure I have the answer.

[05:41] I think if they were to wait for the code to be more complete, that might have pushed

[05:47] the launch of this game a few months out.

[05:50] And I think if I have to sort of be honest with all of you out there who listen to this

[05:56] podcast, I really don't think it's beneficial to show a game until it's pretty much done.

[06:02] I think there's a lot of pressure on these manufacturers to show these games at different

[06:07] shows, to get in front of these crowds.

[06:11] But the question I always have is, what good is it to get a product in front of a crowd

[06:17] when the experience people have with that product is so lukewarm because the game's

[06:24] not nearly done.

[06:25] So then you're basically saying that pinball people will buy a pinball game based on looks

[06:31] alone.

[06:32] And I think we all know that we've moved past that period of pinball.

[06:36] And if you look at Jersey Jack Pinball and how they revealed the Pirates of the Caribbean

[06:42] so early, like we saw the game in October, and what did that do?

[06:48] Revealing the game that early, all it did was cripple their ability to keep dialed in

[06:53] sales coming in.

[06:54] I mean, I think at Texas Pinball Festival this year is a prime example of that.

[07:00] Pirates of the Caribbean, it is March.

[07:02] The game is not shipping anytime soon, and yet the hype and the buzz surrounding dialed

[07:08] in is all but gone.

[07:11] No one's talking about it.

[07:13] There were no lines to play dialed in.

[07:15] And yet dialed in is the game that Jack has on the line for maybe the next three, four

[07:19] months before Pirates of the Caribbean is even manufactured.

[07:24] So basically if you add up those three, four months plus add the eight months from Expo,

[07:29] great.

[07:30] Like Jack has his eight months or six months of great.

[07:32] So Jack has now released a product nine to ten months before it actually is being made.

[07:39] What good is that?

[07:41] What point does that accomplish for a company, especially when every single deposit on dialed

[07:47] in and Pirates of the Caribbean, every single deposit is refundable?

[07:50] And we're going to talk a lot about this refundable versus non-refundable deposit because I think

[07:56] it changes everything with these game reveals.

[08:00] And I think it changes everything with how consumers have to make up their minds with these

[08:04] games.

[08:05] But let me go back to spooky and reveals in general.

[08:09] So they reveal a game at a seminar on Saturday at four o'clock at night.

[08:14] And I already went over how I think they probably should have had more high res images and

[08:19] gameplay video of the game itself.

[08:23] They should have shown more of that instead of pulling the curtain off the game and not

[08:28] even being able to really show you gameplay in the room.

[08:31] So I think that was a missed opportunity.

[08:34] I would have had high res images and gameplay footage to go up online simultaneously.

[08:39] Okay.

[08:40] But that's not really the main reason I want to talk about that because I think that's

[08:43] what we're under the bridge.

[08:44] We've moved past that.

[08:45] What I want to talk about and this impacts more than just Charlie, I want to talk about

[08:50] revealing a game at a show and then you reveal the game and then you dump the game on the

[08:56] show floor for people's first experiences with the game.

[09:00] And I want to say coming out of TPS, I have to say that that is the worst way to give

[09:06] people a first impression of a pinball machine.

[09:10] And I think everyone was experiencing that probably with Alice Cooper because it was in

[09:15] between total nuclear annihilations which were really loud.

[09:19] You've got a mob of people and all of a sudden the first time you're experiencing this

[09:25] product, right?

[09:26] This product that is a malgamation of sounds, of shots, of callouts, of design, and you've

[09:36] got all the spooky people there.

[09:38] And they're like being inundated by a bunch of just fanboys and no one can hear anybody,

[09:44] no one can truly get a good experience with the game.

[09:47] All you can do is look at it.

[09:49] Okay, and here's my suggestion in all of these shows moving forward.

[09:53] I think all pinball reveals should happen in a separate area of the show.

[10:00] And I want to talk about what we used to do at Toy Fair when I worked in the toy industry.

[10:05] I worked for Toy Bizz and whenever we would reveal like hot new popular toy item, we wouldn't

[10:12] be out on the show floor like in the main area with all the mob.

[10:17] We would have a separate room where people would walk in and get a more personalized experience

[10:24] with the product itself.

[10:25] And that is exactly what I think these pinball companies need and it's exactly what I think

[10:30] these manufacturers need when they bring these new products to a show.

[10:34] So here's how I would envision something like that occurring.

[10:37] So Charlie's got Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle and he wants to show it to people for

[10:42] the first time.

[10:43] I think you simply find a private room in which that game, those two games will be and

[10:50] I think people can sign up and get on a list to see the game.

[10:54] And even if you have a line of people down the hallway or outside the door, that's fine.

[11:00] But I think people come in maybe groups of three to four to time and they get a little

[11:06] bit of a more in-depth immersion into the game.

[11:10] They get told, here's what went into signing it, here's how these features are going to

[11:14] work and you each are going to get to play and shoot a ball.

[11:17] But we want it to you guys to know what is going into this game.

[11:21] We want you to hear it and we want you to experience it the right way.

[11:25] And I think from there as well, the smart thing to do because you're really talking about

[11:31] the hardcore pinball enthusiasts are the only ones who really care about these new games.

[11:37] All the casual people at T-P-F that are just coming through, they have no idea.

[11:43] They have no idea what the new games are, what the old games are.

[11:45] Those people walk right by Simpson's pinball party and you could tell them that game came

[11:48] out last year and they would believe you.

[11:51] So you're kind of like at a disservice just having this mob of people and all this loud

[11:59] noise and all these distractions take away from your pinball machine.

[12:04] So I would have it in a private room and the other thing I would do is this because

[12:07] you are talking to the more serious pinball person.

[12:11] I would also give people the opportunity to buy the game and get on your list and give

[12:16] it a positive on the spot.

[12:18] I mean there's nothing more, there's no greater moment to make an impulse purchasing decision

[12:26] than out of pinball show when you are away from everything else and you're ready to buy

[12:31] a new toy.

[12:32] I heard Charlie's wife saying we're not taking any orders today.

[12:38] We're not doing anything.

[12:40] We're waiting.

[12:41] And I'm like, waiting.

[12:43] What are you waiting for?

[12:45] This is the moment when people and their money will most easily be separated because they're

[12:50] super excited.

[12:51] They just got to see it.

[12:52] And the fear of missing out is always the greatest on the first day a new pinball machine

[12:58] is revealed.

[12:59] I mean think about it.

[13:00] Stern, Batman, Stern, Ghostbusters.

[13:02] Those are machines that sold out on day one.

[13:05] And so I think Charlie had a lot of excitement and I just think it's again it's a missed opportunity

[13:10] from a marketing standpoint to pause and wait and not let people who physically are in

[13:15] front of you order the game.

[13:16] Now I would say we're only going to let people at the show who have an experience who get

[13:22] to experience it order it first.

[13:25] And I would say I don't want anyone who hasn't seen anything and that's fine.

[13:28] And you know what?

[13:29] So what?

[13:30] Tough luck.

[13:31] So what?

[13:32] And maybe he has another list of die hard spooky fanatics who he can also offer it to.

[13:38] But I just think these games being on the show floor in the middle of the madness when

[13:45] they're trying to be like revealed for the first time ever is absolutely like a horrible

[13:52] experience.

[13:53] I just I don't enjoy it.

[13:54] I don't enjoy it at all.

[13:56] And I think it's not the right way to reveal like these six to eight to nine thousand

[14:01] dollar toys.

[14:02] It's just not how I would do it.

[14:05] You know, it's not like a car show.

[14:07] When you go to a car show and you're looking at a car, it's it's a different kind of item.

[14:13] You're really like you really are mostly looking at the aesthetics of the car.

[14:17] You know what the engine is.

[14:18] You know what the performance is.

[14:19] But no one goes to a car show expecting to drive the car and get the driving experience.

[14:26] But we do go to pinball shows expecting to have a good pinball experience.

[14:32] And I have to say, you know, after two days of like all the, you know, time on my feet,

[14:37] the loud noises, this and that, you know, it's just I just didn't enjoy playing pinball

[14:43] because it's just it's overload.

[14:47] You know, I have more fun playing pinball machines at Sunshine Laundromat.

[14:51] I have more fun playing my Batman in my living room.

[14:54] I have more fun going over to a friend's house with a collection.

[14:58] And I do think that these companies should start to think long and hard, but how are we

[15:04] going to show these games differently?

[15:07] How are we going to give people a better firsthand experience than this?

[15:12] Because I've been reading on the pinside thread with with Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle,

[15:16] the dilemma now with with spooky pinballs approach of you can order Alice Cooper, but deposits

[15:25] are non-refundable.

[15:27] And let's talk about that for a minute because how does someone now make a deposit on a

[15:33] game that they've never played?

[15:36] They have no, they don't have many good sort of firsthand experiences from other pinball

[15:42] players talking about the game.

[15:45] You know, there's not like a twitch stream of the game.

[15:48] And the game is not ready to be streamed on twitch by guys like Jack Danger.

[15:52] It's just not there yet.

[15:54] The code isn't there.

[15:55] I don't see the point in showing this game this early because there's a lot of fun features

[16:01] and mechanisms and things in this game that I know Charlie and Company are really excited

[16:07] about, but I think they should wait until those things are all functioning and operational.

[16:11] And everything is in the game that really shows it off to the best of its ability.

[16:17] And I think Charlie kind of, you know, they said they were going to reveal it at T.P.F.

[16:22] I kind of don't think it was quite ready.

[16:25] And I think if we think about Chicago gaming company pulling out with Monster Bash remake

[16:31] and Stern not showing Iron Maiden, you know, something George Gomez said to me when I went

[16:36] up to him at the bar was like, well, why would I show a game when it's not ready to be

[16:39] shown like we've learned our lesson.

[16:41] We're not going to do that again.

[16:42] I see absolutely no reason in just showing it early because people want us to be here.

[16:48] I don't want people to see, would you want people to see your work, Chris, before it's

[16:51] finished?

[16:52] Would you want to share an idea before it's complete?

[16:55] And I get what he's saying.

[16:57] And I think it begs the question is what is the right way?

[17:02] Are the shows the right way to release games if games are not ready?

[17:07] And the games being released outside of shows is that does that make it difficult for

[17:13] people to get on the machines?

[17:16] And I think it's an interesting question.

[17:18] It's not something that I have the complete answer to.

[17:21] But I do think all of this, you know, we've seen so many companies launch over the last

[17:26] few years.

[17:27] I do think the best advice I could give everybody is do not reveal your game until it's done.

[17:33] I mean done, done, done.

[17:35] Don't reveal it.

[17:36] Absolutely no benefit in these early reveals.

[17:39] Do not release a game until you feel like the game before its sales have started to really

[17:51] taper off.

[17:52] Because I do think that Pirates of the Caribbean has got to just be killing the sales of

[18:00] dialed in.

[18:01] I do.

[18:02] I can't see how that helped either, either title to be really so early.

[18:09] I think you need to give an experience to people that's more intimate and more special

[18:14] and more one-on-one when you're asking them to spend this kind of money on a toy.

[18:19] And I think throwing the thing out on the show floor at these big shows that's open to

[18:24] the public, I think is silly.

[18:27] And maybe there's just a separate section.

[18:30] And there's more conference room in these big embassy suites.

[18:32] This isn't it, right?

[18:33] There's more spaces in these hotels.

[18:36] I think there should be a room that is solely the new releases room and that manufacturers

[18:43] can have a more intimate conversation with their buyer base.

[18:46] I just think that's the way to go.

[18:49] And I say this.

[18:51] I say this from the bottom of my heart because I really want these companies to put their

[18:55] best foot forward.

[18:58] And I keep seeing these games released in these ways where it's like, I don't know, it's

[19:04] like you do all this work.

[19:06] And then you can't put a PowerPoint presentation together that's engaging.

[19:11] You know, I was at the Jersey Jack Pimball seminar.

[19:15] And it's just like really, you're just going to put a bunch of photos up on PowerPoint

[19:19] and go through them one at a time.

[19:21] Like that's really the way you're going to engage the crowd.

[19:25] And I don't think that's the way to do it.

[19:29] I think all these companies need to learn that rehearsing and public speaking.

[19:35] And presentation is in art form.

[19:38] Just as much as making Pimball is in art form, the art of selling your game, the art of getting

[19:44] people excited, the art of capturing their money when hype is high is also in art form.

[19:51] And I think as more and more of these companies are trying to sell you their products at the

[19:55] exact same time.

[19:56] You know what happens in a crowded marketplace?

[20:00] Marketing becomes even more important.

[20:02] All right.

[20:03] I also want to talk a little bit about some of the other news I didn't really cover.

[20:07] And even thinking more about George Gomez sort of calling me out during the Stern seminar.

[20:12] And you know, look, it's, I wasn't expecting it.

[20:16] I wasn't expecting someone to ask a question about Lyman Sheetz.

[20:19] I wasn't expecting George Gomez to say that the only point of this podcast is to be provocative.

[20:24] And I'm good at it.

[20:26] And you know, it's bullshit.

[20:27] Some of the stuff I say, you know, it's fine.

[20:30] Like George is, is, is, is I'm, he's free to share his opinion about this show.

[20:36] And I don't want it.

[20:37] I don't want to like, you know, part of me was like, man, like should I apologize significantly?

[20:40] I'm like, you know what?

[20:42] I'm not going to go and fall down because of a comment like that.

[20:47] I respect George Gomez.

[20:48] I hope he respects this show.

[20:50] I hope he listens to this show because I don't think what we say on this show is always bullshit.

[20:56] Somebody gave me some really reliable information about Lyman.

[21:01] And I reported it as a rumor as speculation, not as fact.

[21:05] Okay.

[21:06] I think what George is more upset about.

[21:08] I think what he's really, really upset about is protecting the IP of his games.

[21:14] And he's upset that some of his future titles are out there that they've been reported

[21:20] about on this show and that that as a, from, you know, has to be an annoying thing to

[21:27] a guy who's really working hard to keep these games secret and private until they're fully

[21:33] revealed.

[21:34] And, you know, I think George should sleep well at night knowing that people haven't

[21:38] seen what these games look like.

[21:40] People don't know what the features are.

[21:43] They may know what the titles are.

[21:45] But again, you know, pinballs can go in any, any, any hundred different directions in terms

[21:51] of design and layout and art packages.

[21:54] So I think his IP is pretty safe.

[21:57] I think some things have leaked that we've reported on that probably have made him feel a

[22:01] little bit uncomfortable.

[22:03] But it's just the nature of working in the biggest pinball company in the world.

[22:06] This things are going to make their way out there.

[22:08] All right.

[22:09] And it's not a bad thing.

[22:10] I mean, the only people who listen to this podcast are the diehard, diehard, diehards.

[22:14] I think at these shows too, you see that the majority of people who buy, stern pinball

[22:19] machines, they're not on pinside.

[22:22] They don't give a shit.

[22:24] They don't listen to this podcast.

[22:26] The majority of buyers.

[22:28] I feel like the majority of pinball buyers just are dudes who have game rooms and they're

[22:33] like, you know, they're, they're friendly with their local distributor who's supplied them

[22:37] with maybe arcade games and pinball machines.

[22:39] And they're like, hey, man, you got anything new that's fun?

[22:41] They're like, yeah, we got Star Wars.

[22:42] He's like, cool, I'll take one.

[22:43] I mean, I feel like that is the level of engagement most stern pinball buyers have.

[22:51] And I think a lot of times the foreign members and the people who are just like fanatic about

[22:57] it, I think they like to project that, you know, their opinions about stern and them

[23:02] knowing something about stern is actually going to change the way stern does business.

[23:06] And I just want to tell you guys, you're wrong if you think that.

[23:10] There is nothing we will ever do or say that I think will change the way stern operates

[23:14] as a business.

[23:16] The only thing that could ever change the way stern operates as a business is if competitors

[23:22] actually deliver more for the money.

[23:25] And I think it's safe to say that that hasn't really happened very often.

[23:30] I think stern still makes great pinball machines.

[23:33] I literally, when I was by the Marco Booth, you have to give them credit for the amount

[23:39] of titles they have, the variety of themes they have, and the fact that they bring some

[23:45] of the world's most popular IPs into the pinball world.

[23:49] I mean, it is really hard to get people more excited about Houdini than a Ghostbusters

[23:55] or a Batman or a Star Wars.

[23:58] I mean, it is, it's not even like, I literally, how do you get people more excited about Houdini

[24:04] than one of those titles?

[24:06] Now, the way you do it is you make a great game.

[24:09] And I think there are people out there who think Houdini is better than anything stern is

[24:12] offering right now, and people are buying Houdini because of that.

[24:16] Same is true with Jersey Jack's offering.

[24:18] There are people who think dialed in is a much better game than Star Wars.

[24:22] And look, on a pinball level, dialed in is a much, much better game than Star Wars.

[24:27] And I bet you Star Wars will sell five times as many as dialed in.

[24:32] So does stern care.

[24:34] I mean, it doesn't, and again, I think you guys need to realize I don't mean stern doesn't

[24:38] care about making pinball because we know they do.

[24:42] But first stern it is about the money too.

[24:45] The money does drive what goes into these games and that means you're not going to get

[24:51] as much into a game as you'd like.

[24:54] Let me give you an example.

[24:56] When's the last stern game that had a left outline kickback?

[25:01] Okay?

[25:02] Just a left outline kickback.

[25:05] It's not an expensive thing.

[25:07] It's $20 to put a coil and a kickback into a game.

[25:12] When was the last time a stern machine had that in it?

[25:15] Why not?

[25:16] You know, someone told me something was very interesting and I think it's starting to

[25:20] look pretty true.

[25:22] That if you look at stern pinball machines, the reason why they don't want to kickback,

[25:26] they don't want like ball saves.

[25:29] They want to make games that have shorter ball times for operators.

[25:34] That is why stern games, if you think about them, they dial up the power on the slingshots

[25:40] and the balls tend to pretty nasty and fly into the outlines very often.

[25:46] They don't want to make games that give people too much time on the machine.

[25:51] That is an operator decision because the operator doesn't want you spending 30 minutes on

[25:56] the load of the rings.

[25:58] So I think there's some truth to that.

[26:01] A little bit of speculation.

[26:03] Don't crucify me, stern pinball if you're listening to this.

[26:06] But that's where we're at.

[26:09] That's where we're at.

[26:10] I think I'm fatigued a little bit.

[26:14] Coming out of TPS, I have to say, I'm going to be brutally honest here.

[26:19] I'm going to be brutally honest with all of you.

[26:22] I still think there's something missing from this hobby.

[26:25] And when I think he's missing from this hobby, I think that's what I'm saying.

[26:28] I think there are a lot of very, very wealthy collectors out there.

[26:33] And nobody is making games for those people.

[26:37] I want there to be games that are special, that are very truly limited, that not everybody can buy.

[26:45] I want there to be an experience that only a handful of people get, and they pay a price for that exclusive experience.

[26:53] I think pinball needs games that make people want to dream of owning them.

[27:00] I do.

[27:01] Because I see all these guys, all these millionaires, left and right, they come with like a lot of money in their pocket.

[27:08] And what are they going to go buy?

[27:10] A game that everyone else has either had for 20 years or everyone else can get like the premium edition of.

[27:16] There really is nothing that is truly limited and truly special for the high-end collector.

[27:23] And I just think, when you're a kid, what's the car that you hung up on your wall as a poster?

[27:30] It wasn't like the freaking Honda Civic.

[27:34] I think all these games now, I just none of them feel like limited.

[27:40] And that's the only thing.

[27:41] I'm not saying what's out there is bad guys.

[27:44] I'm just saying, when I walk up to Kingpin, a game where there's only eight in the world,

[27:48] and then they're like, well, we're going to make as many as we can.

[27:52] I'm just like, you just lost my interest in this game.

[27:57] It's like the Bugatti Royale car.

[28:01] They made like 10 in the world, and they're so special.

[28:05] And maybe it's the Ducenburg.

[28:07] There's one of them where there's only eight.

[28:09] But all those old things, all those things are super special.

[28:13] They're special because they didn't make a ton of them.

[28:16] And I just think, taking the Grail games and mass producing them,

[28:21] takes a lot of the fun out of the collector hobby.

[28:24] I also want someone just to make a game from scratch that is designed to be a collectible.

[28:30] Why is it that hard to design something that is just meant to be a collectible?

[28:34] I was flying back from Atlanta and I was reading DuPont Registry.

[28:38] And DuPont Registry, if you don't know what it is, it's a magazine

[28:42] where cars are for sale and other high-end items.

[28:47] And it'll make you feel broke because every car in there is like,

[28:51] you know, one of 70 Ferrari's made in this trim and it's $490,000.

[28:56] Every car is like over $100,000, all the way up to like a couple million dollars.

[29:02] And you read this and you're like, well, like, is there anyone out there who even buys

[29:06] and owns these cars?

[29:07] And the answer is yes, there is.

[29:10] If you made 50 limited editions of a very high-end game,

[29:14] there are more than enough people, more than enough people,

[29:19] in the Pimbal hobby who would quickly absorb those games if they were special and magical.

[29:24] When you were flying into Texas, do you see all those houses?

[29:28] You know what I like to do when I'm flying into a place like Texas?

[29:30] I count the roofs in just one development area.

[29:34] There might be like 300 houses.

[29:37] And I'm like, 300 houses.

[29:39] If all 300 of those people were into Batman and really wanted a super limited edition,

[29:44] I would have to tell 220 people they can't have it.

[29:48] And imagine if all those people were multi-millionaires who are never told

[29:53] they can't have something they want.

[29:55] And that's what this hobby, I just want to see more of the high-end developed.

[30:00] Because I do think everyone's fighting it out in the same area.

[30:05] And I don't know why.

[30:07] I don't know why.

[30:08] I think it's because people all want to sell it in high volume.

[30:11] And I say good luck to that.

[30:12] I think that's the hardest thing to do is to sell high-volume Pimbal machines

[30:16] because you'll never be able to compete with Stern on a high-volume play.

[30:20] You just won't.

[30:23] All right, well that's my wish.

[30:25] I hope someone does it.

[30:27] Let's see.

[30:28] So let me go to some of your user emails.

[30:31] And because I got a few.

[30:32] Not too many.

[30:34] Let's see.

[30:35] I got an email from let's see, Let's see.

[30:39] Do do do do.

[30:42] Jake Faller.

[30:43] I don't know if I read this one.

[30:44] Let me see.

[30:46] My name is Jason Faller and I'm writing Shotgun back from Texas and T.P.F.

[30:51] to St. Louis.

[30:53] First off, it was nice meeting you.

[30:55] I heard your voice as we walked into the Stern seminar and it was nice to shake your hand.

[31:00] I was the guy seated on the left in the blue Nike hat.

[31:05] Obviously I heard George Gomez and his jab, more like counter jab, I suppose, at you,

[31:11] and was really curious as to how you'd handled it.

[31:16] I see both sides.

[31:17] I can appreciate how difficult it must be to offer opinions and cutting edge news and

[31:23] not have the occasional misinformation or industry executive take exception to something that

[31:28] was said.

[31:29] I've said before, Stern is the Chevrolet of Pimball.

[31:33] For better or worse, huge budgets, huge sales, capable of blockbuster flagships, Corvette

[31:40] is the walking dead, Metallica, Lord of the Rings.

[31:44] But also capable of allowing their market share to take advantage of consumers at times.

[31:49] Let's see, citation, rolling stones.

[31:54] They might not be the sexiest brand with the most panage, but they are the biggest player

[31:59] in the game of Pimball for a reason.

[32:02] I liked your admission of a needed change in your policy of rumors and maybe considering

[32:07] the effect your opinion has.

[32:09] That being said, we need someone that questions the moves of the industry and holds them accountable.

[32:15] You are the voice for us.

[32:17] Don't shy away from it.

[32:18] I don't think you would if you always get slapped on the back and your drinks bought

[32:23] by industry execs.

[32:24] You would be doing something wrong.

[32:26] Jason, thank you for that.

[32:27] It rattled me.

[32:31] I won't lie.

[32:32] It rattled me when the lead guy over at Stern Pimball calls my podcast out and said that

[32:40] it's bullshit and just provocative.

[32:44] At first, I was like, you know, fuck.

[32:46] I don't want George Gomez to be my enemy.

[32:49] I didn't do anything that I thought warranted being called such hostile words.

[32:57] I think I've been nothing but supportive of Stern Pimball most of the time.

[33:03] I own a George Gomez game.

[33:05] My only Pimball machine in my possession is the most expensive Stern machine they've

[33:10] ever sold.

[33:12] So just from a pure, don't talk to your customers that way.

[33:16] It's a little shock to hear what he said.

[33:18] Well look, I went up and I talked to George and we had a nice conversation.

[33:22] George is a businessman and he's going to defend his business the same way I would defend

[33:26] my team and my creative ideas in my industry.

[33:30] George drives like a 350 horsepower Porsche.

[33:35] I drive an 840 horsepower Dodge.

[33:39] We're not going to back down.

[33:41] This guy is not going to become complacent or a shell or a polygetic or feel like intimidated

[33:49] by anyone who wants to call this podcast out because I don't rely on Stern Pimball or

[33:57] Stern Pimball employees to keep this show going.

[34:02] There are a lot of other podcasts out there that they care a lot about the relationship

[34:07] they have with the manufacturers and that prohibits them from speaking in the truth about

[34:12] those manufacturers.

[34:13] And I can tell you right now, I have a good job, a beautiful fiance, the world's coolest

[34:19] dog, the world's fastest production car.

[34:22] I live in one of the best cities on the planet.

[34:24] I have one of the most loving families.

[34:26] I have the job that I love.

[34:29] There's nothing.

[34:30] There's nothing a Pimball manufacturer can say that would ever make me change.

[34:34] The confidence, the sometimes arrogance, the sometimes swagger that Canada has on this

[34:41] show or in real life.

[34:43] That's just who I am.

[34:44] I'm not going to change because George Gomez calls me out.

[34:48] What I would is invite George Gomez to come on the show when he has some strong feelings

[34:53] about the show.

[34:54] I know they listen.

[34:56] But I know deep down inside, they probably respect the fact that I keep the hobby and the

[35:02] conversation going.

[35:03] I have been very positive about Stern, but they don't do everything right.

[35:09] This notion that everything they do is with the consumer's best interest in mine.

[35:14] I don't buy that.

[35:15] I don't buy that from any company, not just Pimball companies.

[35:19] Every company out there, the bottom line is what matters.

[35:22] It's what matters.

[35:23] It's what matters in my company.

[35:25] It's what matters at Chevrolet.

[35:27] It's what matters at Stern Pimball.

[35:29] And I actually like that Stern's a little bit more honest about that.

[35:32] Cool.

[35:33] We could make this game with all these features and we could end up bankrupt like Jersey

[35:37] Jack Pimball or we could end up bankrupt like Andrew Highway or we could end up bankrupt

[35:43] like Dutch Pimball.

[35:45] Those other manufacturers are lucky that George Gomez bites his tongue.

[35:50] That Stern Pimball says nothing.

[35:52] These guys constantly, and I'm going to say this, Stern Pimball took it on the chin from

[35:58] Andrew Highway from Barry and Yop, from Jersey Jack.

[36:02] They all came out and were like, fuck Stern, this is Pimball.

[36:07] Those guys are cutting corners.

[36:08] Those guys are lazy.

[36:09] Those guys don't care.

[36:10] And all those other companies, they went straight ahead into the hall of bankruptcy and

[36:17] they fucking failed.

[36:18] They failed all of them.

[36:20] Sometimes people forget how close everyone came to losing their hobbit money.

[36:26] You understand this notion people that everyone who ordered the hobbit, then there were hundreds

[36:30] of people.

[36:31] They all were going to lose their $8,000 because Jersey Jack was done until he got the

[36:38] bailout.

[36:39] Alright?

[36:40] Yop and Barry are not getting that bailout.

[36:42] Highway Pimball's bailout is running on fumes.

[36:45] That company is done.

[36:47] You can all but stick a fork in these guys.

[36:50] Trickling games out.

[36:51] Come on.

[36:52] How long are these guys going to put up with every time they get the balance sheet at the

[36:58] end of the month, it's in the red.

[37:00] And so George Gomez, Gary Stern, those guys over there, seriously, they might call me

[37:08] Bullshit.

[37:09] And that's fine.

[37:10] I'm just the podcaster with a headset on.

[37:12] They could speak up more and they could sink every other company if they were more honest

[37:19] about how everyone else has really been the companies that have been fucking over the

[37:23] Pimball industry, not Stern.

[37:25] I mean, we're lucky that they don't have the swagger of me because I would be much more

[37:29] outspoken.

[37:30] Imagine if, imagine like this, imagine if Mike from Home Pim, a guy who is talking, running

[37:34] his mouth with the shittiest game in the industry.

[37:37] Imagine if that guy was in George Gomez's position and he had all those IPs and all those

[37:43] games and all that talent making games for him.

[37:47] And what Stern Pimball would be like, right, it'd be much different.

[37:51] He'd be much more on the attack, but I have to give Gomez and company credit.

[37:55] They just, you know what, they take it and you know what speaks to them, the money in

[38:00] the bank and the happy customers.

[38:03] And it's the other way around.

[38:04] It's the happy customers first and the money in the bank.

[38:07] People who buy Stern Pimball machines for the most part are happy.

[38:12] They get their game.

[38:14] They enjoy their game.

[38:15] There's no bullshit.

[38:16] All right, this is not me shilling the company and then you know what else?

[38:20] Who else is really happy?

[38:22] The Stern Pimball employees because there's money in the bank.

[38:27] All right, let's see the spreadsheets of all the other companies out there.

[38:30] How much money is American Pimball like in the green or Jersey Jack in the green?

[38:36] P3 in the green.

[38:38] Dutch Pimball.

[38:39] No, they're all in the red probably right now.

[38:41] Just trying to break through.

[38:43] Buky's the only one that's done it right.

[38:46] But again, Stern probably makes more in one month and Spooky has in like three, four years.

[38:53] But as Charlie said, he's not trying to be Stern.

[38:55] I'm not trying to be NPR here.

[38:57] I'm not trying to be CNN.

[38:59] I'm just trying to be my little thing in my little corner of the Pimball universe.

[39:04] All right.

[39:05] All right.

[39:06] So yeah, I'm not, thank you for that email.

[39:09] I'm not going to shy away.

[39:11] You have my word.

[39:12] I will always be, I will always be me.

[39:14] All right.

[39:15] I got an email from Steven Miko Las.

[39:18] Steven said, thanks for all you do.

[39:21] You are the honest talk of the industry of Pimball.

[39:24] Keep it up.

[39:25] Keep it real.

[39:26] The show is a marathon of the hobby that I love.

[39:33] World under glass.

[39:34] That was just a subject head.

[39:35] Okay.

[39:36] So I think he was just saying thanks for the show.

[39:39] Steven or Stefan, thank you so much.

[39:41] I appreciate that.

[39:42] I got an email from Scott Drager, Scott said, hello, canada.

[39:47] I love that you picked Crash Diet for the intro music.

[39:50] So for some of you who might have heard a few shows ago, I used a very rare, unreleased

[39:55] guns and runes is so-called Crash Diet that is freaking incredible.

[39:59] And I wish they would have recorded it.

[40:00] It's better than anything on Chinese democracy.

[40:03] He said, I wish I made it to TPS.

[40:07] I was at Chicago Pimball Expo, but I'll probably head to TPS next year.

[40:12] Thanks for the coverage of the event with the extra podcasts.

[40:16] I'm looking forward to getting the Big Lebowski machine.

[40:19] I'm on a coin taker list and rumor has it, some will arrive in May, June.

[40:24] That means the engineering samples must have passed their QA test.

[40:29] The contract manufacturer decision is the thing that might save DP.

[40:34] If you compare to highway situation, highway made a big KPEX and OPEX expense that DP

[40:39] avoid it.

[40:41] If you ever want to chat marketing, I'm up for it.

[40:43] I'm a product marketer by trade, managing product marketing management for a specialized

[40:49] global enterprise software company.

[40:50] Wow, that sounds important, man.

[40:52] I'd be happy to explore marketing of Pimball as a guest.

[40:56] You bring a ton of interest with your earned media view.

[40:59] I have a product centered view of marketing.

[41:02] So it might be fun.

[41:03] Well, Scott, we will do it.

[41:04] We'll do a little Pimball marketing sort of powwow on this podcast.

[41:07] You have my word.

[41:09] I hope you get your Big Lebowski.

[41:11] Do I think you're going to get your Big Lebowski in May or June?

[41:15] I don't think so.

[41:17] I don't know.

[41:18] You're not.

[41:19] I don't have any information that says you're not.

[41:21] All I know is whenever we've heard that the Big Lebowski is going to ship, whatever month

[41:26] we've been given, we've blown by those months.

[41:29] We've blown by them sometimes years by those months.

[41:33] I have no, until I see, until I see games coming off the assembly line, we're talking

[41:40] May, June.

[41:41] So it's almost April.

[41:42] So you're talking like five, six weeks from now, you think Big Lebowski's will be arriving.

[41:49] I mean, can we just, from the sheer vantage point of like, it has to come all the way

[41:54] for China on a boat to CoinTaker.

[41:58] That alone is going to take weeks.

[42:01] We have not seen a video of the manufacturing facility.

[42:06] We have not seen a final game.

[42:07] I'll tell you why I think these guys are stalling.

[42:10] It's real simple.

[42:11] And you're a marketer, so you'll understand this.

[42:13] These guys need new money.

[42:15] What better way to get new orders in than the show the Big Lebowski on the assembly line

[42:21] being made going into a box and saying, hey guys, look, it's March, whatever, 22nd, 25th,

[42:27] whatever it is.

[42:28] I don't even know Davis.

[42:29] It's March or April.

[42:31] Here is our production line.

[42:33] Games are on the line.

[42:35] Customer products are being built.

[42:36] If you order your Big Lebowski, you will get them.

[42:40] And here you go.

[42:41] Okay.

[42:42] Now here, I have to say something.

[42:43] I hope you get it because I stood over the Big Lebowski at TPS.

[42:46] And I still think the Big Lebowski is the most beautiful and awesome looking Pimble Machine

[42:53] I have seen in like the last five years.

[42:56] I just, there's something about that game.

[42:59] The coolness of the bowling alley, the artwork, the theme, you know, the rug, the upper

[43:04] play field, it has an upper and lower play field.

[43:06] I mean, name me another game that's come out recently.

[43:09] It has an upper and lower play field.

[43:11] It's just so freaking cool.

[43:14] I really would love to have a Big Lebowski one day.

[43:17] But I would stay away from one until these guys have their shit figured out.

[43:21] And I just don't think they're going to be able to raise the capital to get the assembly

[43:25] line going because where does the money come to order all those parts?

[43:30] But look, I hope I'm wrong.

[43:31] I hope you get it.

[43:32] Alright, Kevin Sanborn wrote and he said, you left us hanging on the fate of the Hilton

[43:37] hoodie of destiny.

[43:39] Was he overwhelmed with joy when you bestowed its greatness upon him, Kevin?

[43:44] Well, I did, in fact, walk up to Hilton, wearing the Hilton hoodie and I offered it to him

[43:51] and I asked him if he would at least just sign it.

[43:55] And he said, no.

[43:56] And he looked a little pissed off, a little bummed out.

[43:59] And you know, Hilton's funny, dude.

[44:01] It's like he talks so much smack.

[44:04] I mean, I throw that guy under the bus so much and when I'm right next to him, it's just

[44:10] like, whatever, he's just, he's a harmless pinball nerd.

[44:14] That's all he is.

[44:16] I think he's a terrible shill for pinball at times.

[44:20] And I think his opinions hold absolutely zero weight.

[44:23] I saw him chiming in on Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[44:27] And if I was Chuck, I would be like, yo, dude, like just don't say anything because anything

[44:32] you say, people will do the opposite.

[44:35] So if you start shilling my game, people are going to be like, here we go all over again.

[44:40] So I think his opinions mean absolutely nothing.

[44:44] And I think everyone who is in on Pinside and on the forum, he's sort of become just

[44:49] like the, you know, the town jester.

[44:53] He's like the clown that everyone just sort of looks at, laughs at and just ignores.

[44:58] But he didn't take it.

[44:59] I still have it.

[45:00] So what that means for you is this.

[45:04] If you guys are interested in ordering your very own Hilton hoodie, I am going to start

[45:10] setting up an online marketplace for a Canadian pinball swag.

[45:16] Now my swag is going to be fun.

[45:17] It's not just going to be like, Canadian pinball podcast logo.

[45:20] No, it's going to be like the stuff that I actually created and where.

[45:23] So one shirt I had on at the show said, get Orrick his alien.

[45:28] And then the alien image, it was Andrew's banner ad that said shipping 2016.

[45:34] So that was a funny one I had.

[45:35] I had another one on that was Canadian pinball podcast was the logo and then underneath

[45:39] it real big, it said, fuck, October fest.

[45:43] Okay.

[45:44] I was wearing another shirt that said the trippy tally and it had Canadian pinball podcast

[45:50] one slam tilt podcast zero head to head pinball podcast zero underneath that.

[45:56] It said any questions.

[45:58] Okay.

[45:59] This is kind of swag.

[46:00] We're going to be talking about.

[46:03] All right.

[46:04] All right.

[46:05] So Kevin, thank you.

[46:07] So I got an email from let's see.

[46:11] This is a long email from Tim Persel.

[46:14] Tim, I'm going to read on the next podcast because I don't want this show to go too long.

[46:18] But I will read yours next time.

[46:20] I got an update from Mark felt on the show, the arcade expo show.

[46:27] Mark I'm also going to read yours on the next podcast because it's a great email.

[46:30] But it's kind of length and I want to make sure we cover off on all of it.

[46:33] So I'm going to end the show there.

[46:35] I'm going to end the show there.

[46:36] I think, you know, just the recap.

[46:38] I think pinball reveals are kind of done in a piss poor fashion.

[46:43] And I don't always think it's the manufacturer's fault.

[46:46] I think pinball shows are poorly set up for people to get a great first impression of

[46:51] a pinball machine.

[46:52] I think games are revealed too early.

[46:55] I think there's this desire and this pressure to get games out early.

[46:59] You know, we didn't even talk about how deep root pinball had ads at T.P.F. in which

[47:04] they were saying next year, the five days of deep root are going to culminate at T.P.F.

[47:10] where the games are revealed.

[47:12] I mean, I saw those banner ads and I was a little like, well, I didn't get to meet Robert.

[47:16] But I was like, kind of like, why do this to yourself?

[47:20] Why put a self-imposed deadline when you don't know for sure that you'll be ready?

[47:27] And do we believe that they're going to have these like, you know, all this stuff ready

[47:31] to show at T.P.F. next year?

[47:34] I'm 365 days counts down real quick when the goal is making complex pinball machines.

[47:41] And I'll tell you, when the goal is to try and figure J-pop out, those days, man, they

[47:47] go by even faster because it's not going to be easy for them to do what they're going

[47:52] to try to do.

[47:53] But there wasn't really much conversation around deep root at the show.

[47:57] I think what they should have done maybe has had a seminar and show us a little bit of

[48:01] what they've been working on just to get a little bit of conversation going.

[48:06] Robert, you also, and I just heard people saying this, they're going to be honest, you need

[48:10] to get someone to design you a pinball logo.

[48:13] People were saying not so nice things about that logo and something about like, it looks

[48:18] like a plug of something.

[48:19] I'm not even going to say it, but I just think you should contact some artists to make

[48:25] you a deep root pinball logo that is much better.

[48:29] There's just some advice there.

[48:31] It wasn't stuff I was saying or just passing it on to you.

[48:36] But you know, so look, it's pinball.

[48:40] There's a lot coming out.

[48:42] Do I dare say that when there's too much, it gets even harder to get excited?

[48:48] I think that's where I'm at.

[48:49] I'm a little fatigued.

[48:50] I'm a little tired of everybody trying to do like so many things with pinball.

[48:58] And I still think it comes down to the world under glass, a magical theme, and the silver

[49:05] ball doing something magical.

[49:07] You know, the news of like Bowen Kernes doing the code for spooky is cool, but I don't

[49:11] think Bowen is like a guy who's all about like the game being fun as much as it is about

[49:17] like tournament play.

[49:19] I don't think tournament players, their focus is on fun.

[49:23] I think it's on how do we make this a great game for tournaments?

[49:28] These tournament players, they never look like they're having much fun to me.

[49:31] They really don't.

[49:32] Bowen does playing TNA because he's so goddamn good.

[49:34] And TNA makes everyone look so goddamn bad.

[49:37] But man, whenever I look over to the tournament section, it is just like an army of fatigued

[49:44] and tired and stressed out dudes.

[49:46] Like, yeah, that looks like a lot of fun guys.

[49:48] Let me stop drinking beers and go do that.

[49:51] Yeah.

[49:52] Okay.

[49:53] Not.

[49:54] All right, guys.

[49:55] Have a great day.

[49:56] We'll talk to you soon.

[49:57] I guess on the show, I'm going to recuperate and get some more energy around Bimbal.

[50:02] But man, the show's take it out of you.

[50:04] They just wipe you out.

[50:06] Have a good day.
