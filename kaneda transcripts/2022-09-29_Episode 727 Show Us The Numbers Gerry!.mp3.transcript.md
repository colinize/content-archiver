[00:00] I don't care. I love it. I don't care.

[00:05] Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider.

[00:10] Ah, welcome everybody to the world's most frustrating pinball podcaster.

[00:15] No R when I say that word, everybody.

[00:17] So look, we're gonna keep going.

[00:19] I know everybody loves being a member of the Canadian Club,

[00:22] and this is why you love it, because we don't stop talking about the hobby we all love.

[00:26] Here's what I'm gonna do on this episode.

[00:27] I'm gonna go around the horn, and we're gonna shuffle the deck,

[00:31] and we're gonna talk about what is going on with each manufacturer.

[00:35] What do I think is gonna happen for these companies in the next few months, okay?

[00:39] Now, there's a lot.

[00:39] There always seems like there's nothing going on in pinball,

[00:42] because not many games are shipping,

[00:44] but there is a lot in the works at every single pinball manufacturer.

[00:49] And I also think tomorrow is when the British Film Institute kicks off,

[00:53] and I think we might see the Keith Elwin pinball machine,

[00:57] and all the other bonds lined up during that Film Institute.

[01:01] So look out for that.

[01:02] That was one of my predictions.

[01:04] Okay, so here's what I'm gonna do.

[01:05] I'm gonna shuffle the deck, and we're gonna go through each manufacturer,

[01:08] and I'm gonna talk about what's going on over there.

[01:11] I'm gonna start with an unlikely company,

[01:13] because I usually leave these guys to the end.

[01:16] Let's start with Multimorphic.

[01:18] Let's count how many months ago this company announced,

[01:22] Weird Al, Pinball, come and get your Weird Al's,

[01:25] and we're gonna make them sometime in the future.

[01:28] It was February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September,

[01:34] right, eight months.

[01:35] We're almost at nine months.

[01:37] Now look, some Weird Al's are making it out there.

[01:40] Not many, but some.

[01:43] Now, all I would love to know is how many they've made,

[01:47] and how many they're making a month.

[01:50] I'm not sure why it is a trade secret.

[01:53] Now, someone asked on the Multimorphic thread,

[01:56] you know, how's hiring going?

[01:57] Is that the delay?

[01:58] And Jerry came clean and said,

[02:00] look, it's really hard to find employees to make these games.

[02:04] And you gotta remember, like, making a pinball machine,

[02:07] most of the line workers aren't making a lot of money.

[02:10] And there are probably a lot easier jobs

[02:13] than building a pinball machine

[02:15] if you're not gonna pay these people the money.

[02:18] And I think that making a pinball machine

[02:20] is somewhat skilled labor.

[02:22] Like, this is not an unskilled job.

[02:24] You're not just putting the french fries

[02:26] into the fryer and pressing a button.

[02:28] You gotta use a soldering iron.

[02:30] You've gotta line stuff up.

[02:31] You gotta make sure everything is perfect

[02:33] before it moves on to the next line.

[02:35] Because as you all know,

[02:36] if you make one mistake on manufacturing a pinball machine,

[02:40] that could lead to a big headache for the company.

[02:43] But here's the thing, Jerry.

[02:44] And I reached out to Jerry this morning,

[02:46] and I still have yet to hear back.

[02:47] Because here's what Jerry said

[02:49] when someone asked the question,

[02:50] because Weird Owl number 27 was delivered,

[02:54] and someone asked like, is that how many you've made?

[02:56] Now the number 27 is very special to Weird Owl,

[02:59] and I think that game was delivered to the Weird Owl family,

[03:03] and they don't make their games in order.

[03:05] But this is what Jerry said.

[03:06] I'm gonna read what he wrote.

[03:07] 27th machine, question mark.

[03:09] Ha!

[03:10] 27 is a special number to Owl,

[03:13] so we made sure he got it.

[03:14] Otherwise, our serial numbers are random

[03:17] with very few exceptions.

[03:19] I love this last part,

[03:20] because it's probably directed a little bit at Canada.

[03:22] Despite how some will want to spin that,

[03:25] we're many factors higher on P3 machines,

[03:28] and also higher on Weird Owl playfields,

[03:31] which are split across existing machine owners

[03:34] and new machine shipments.

[03:36] Jerry.

[03:37] Well, here's the thing, Jerry.

[03:38] When you say people are gonna wanna spin it,

[03:41] why can't you do just one thing, Jerry?

[03:43] Just do us one thing.

[03:45] You've been in business now for like eight years.

[03:48] Why is it still a mystery?

[03:51] How many P3 multi-morphic

[03:53] or multi-morphic P3s you've sold?

[03:56] Why is your user-based number one big, fat question mark?

[04:02] We knew how many spooky games they've made

[04:04] during each run of each game.

[04:06] Spooky tells us how many games they can make a month.

[04:09] They tell us how many games they can make a year.

[04:11] Why is it, Jerry,

[04:12] that you are saying we are spinning this?

[04:15] He's saying like, people are gonna say,

[04:16] we haven't sold that many.

[04:17] We haven't sold more than 250 or 500.

[04:20] Then Jerry, why don't you put all the spin to rest,

[04:23] put all the speculation to rest,

[04:26] and just tell us how many have you made?

[04:29] It's not a mystery.

[04:31] It's not something we should speculate on.

[04:33] You have the facts.

[04:35] And this goes for a lot of these boutiques

[04:37] who hide their numbers.

[04:38] It doesn't really make much sense to me.

[04:40] If you wanna say we're spinning it,

[04:42] the only reason we have to speculate

[04:44] is because you're hiding your numbers, all right?

[04:47] And I think some of these companies

[04:48] would be somewhat embarrassed if they revealed it.

[04:51] Like we've been in business for eight years

[04:53] and we've managed to sell half as many games as TNA.

[04:57] Like nobody really wants to admit that.

[04:59] Do you think they've sold more multi-morphics than TNAs?

[05:02] I don't.

[05:03] And Jerry, if I'm wrong, guess what?

[05:05] You could prove me wrong.

[05:06] It's really easy.

[05:07] You could just say something and be transparent.

[05:10] All right, let's move on to Spooky Pinball.

[05:11] So I went over to Spooky Pinball's website

[05:14] and I went to the shop and I went to see

[05:17] if Total Nuclear Annihilation 2.0 has sold out or not.

[05:21] And I was surprised to see a little bit

[05:23] that it's still available.

[05:24] So that just goes to show that they are offering 250

[05:29] at around $9,000 a pop.

[05:31] And clearly the demand was a little bit lower than that

[05:35] because this has now been open to the public to buy

[05:38] for the last two weeks and will it sell out eventually?

[05:41] I still think they will sell all of these eventually.

[05:45] It's also kind of funny that we're gonna see

[05:47] another single level game in the Keith Elwin

[05:51] like James Bond machine.

[05:52] And if people start throwing like $20,000, $30,000

[05:55] at that thing, I don't think they're going to people.

[05:57] We'll talk about it a little bit later.

[05:59] But this is a single level game that the community loves

[06:02] and you can get a brand new version of it for $9,000.

[06:06] I think they're gonna sell all of them

[06:09] once people start unboxing them.

[06:11] And they realize like I can get it pretty soon

[06:14] and the game is real.

[06:15] I think once that first unboxing happens,

[06:18] you're gonna see more people on the fence,

[06:20] maybe jump in and get them.

[06:22] I also heard from a friend of mine

[06:23] that he just paid for his Ultraman number 476.

[06:27] And he said, Chris, are you gonna stay in

[06:29] on your Ultraman number 500?

[06:30] And the answer is absolutely not.

[06:33] And I think you know that I went in on it,

[06:35] I got excited, I had stars in my eyes

[06:37] about this Neo Tokyo theme game.

[06:40] I'm not an Ultraman fan.

[06:42] I never really saw episodes of Ultraman.

[06:44] I thought the game looked beautiful

[06:46] and the rest has been history.

[06:47] I'll tell you why.

[06:48] Here's the problem is I am committed

[06:51] to sending spooky pinball with a butter cabinet,

[06:54] $10,000 for my Ultraman.

[06:58] So I went on to the pin side marketplace

[07:00] and I looked up Ultraman collector's edition

[07:03] and guess how cheap you can get it for?

[07:05] $6,500 or best offer and still no offers.

[07:11] There's also one available for $6,400.

[07:15] $6,400.

[07:17] You know what's funny is there's one for $6,400 firm

[07:20] and then there's one for $6,400 or best offer.

[07:24] You know what that means?

[07:26] I know I'm not gonna sell this at $6,400.

[07:29] So I'll take $6,100 but shh, don't say anything.

[07:33] Don't tell anyone and then we'll put sale pending

[07:35] and everyone knows when that happens

[07:37] you spend a few hundred bucks less.

[07:39] My favorite part is the dude who's trying to sell it

[07:41] for 6,900 firm.

[07:43] Do you ever laugh at the pin side marketplace

[07:45] when these people have priced their game

[07:48] 500 more than other games on the marketplace

[07:51] and they're firm on their price?

[07:53] How could you be firm at 6,900

[07:55] when people aren't even offering $6,400?

[07:58] But just right there, right?

[08:00] Why would I spend 10 grand and lose almost $4,000

[08:06] on this machine for grand?

[08:09] I will happily walk away from my $2,000 deposit

[08:13] and never fall victim to this again.

[08:15] Now I do wanna report that it really is the Ultraman price

[08:19] that has collapsed because if you look at the Halloween games

[08:22] for sale, they're all much higher.

[08:24] They're like 8,700, 9,000, 8,500, 8,300.

[08:29] So Halloween as the more popular franchise in America

[08:33] is holding pretty steady.

[08:35] It is absolutely gonna be a downhill spiral ride

[08:40] for any Ultraman owner out there.

[08:41] There's just not enough of a fan base in America

[08:44] who wants the pin.

[08:45] And now that everyone's gone sort of south

[08:48] on the game itself, I think you're gonna see these Ultraman

[08:51] slide into like the $5,500 range in the next six months.

[08:54] All right, next stop on our Canadian tour

[08:56] is American Pinball.

[08:58] So here's what we know from American Pinball

[09:00] that Dennis Norman's game is coming up next.

[09:03] Christopher Franchi is on art.

[09:04] It is a 1950s sci-fi space theme.

[09:08] I'm hearing it as crazy ramps, cool mechs,

[09:11] really sexy game, and they're looking at a December production

[09:14] for this game.

[09:15] I do think they are most likely going to reveal this game

[09:20] at Pinball Expo October something like 19th

[09:23] through the 23rd in Chicago.

[09:26] So that is only three weeks away.

[09:28] So we will see, like will David Fix

[09:30] bring this game to Expo and steal the show?

[09:33] Because if you think about Expo right now,

[09:35] I don't think we're gonna see James Bond.

[09:37] We'll see Cactus Canyon, but people are not gonna care.

[09:39] Guess why?

[09:40] Because Cactus Canyon was there last year.

[09:42] That's where they unveiled it.

[09:44] It's crazy that Ellie's are still not out the door,

[09:46] but we're gonna talk about that in a little bit.

[09:48] But I also was wondering how much

[09:51] is Legends of the Hollow right now?

[09:53] David Fix, like he up the limited number of games

[09:56] from 300 to 500 because demand was so great.

[10:00] Went on a podcast and said the demand for the standard

[10:02] is twice as much as the Ellie.

[10:04] And then I'm like, all right, really, twice as much.

[10:08] So here's how much you can go get,

[10:10] an $8,700 Legends of the Hollow for right now.

[10:14] There is one for sale for $7,150,

[10:19] and then one for 7,300 or best offer.

[10:22] So 7,100 people.

[10:24] So that means if you bought this game,

[10:26] and this was just a few months ago,

[10:28] you now took a $1,600 hit on the game itself.

[10:32] But it's even more because you probably paid taxes

[10:35] and you probably paid for shipping.

[10:36] I think American Pinball, the past is the past.

[10:39] This Dennis Nordman game is everything.

[10:41] It's gonna have a new cabinet.

[10:43] It's gonna have a new logo.

[10:45] This is the American Pinball that David Fix

[10:48] has been building, and I'm excited about it.

[10:50] I really am.

[10:51] I really want David Fix and Dennis Nordman and Franchi

[10:55] to drop something into the pinball world

[10:58] that is completely different from everything else

[11:00] we're getting, and I think they're gonna do that.

[11:02] All right, so Chicago Gaming Company,

[11:04] where are the Elis of Cactus Canyon?

[11:07] Now, look, I've seen people say the games are in production.

[11:11] That's great.

[11:12] They should have been in production like nine months ago.

[11:15] This game was unveiled to the world 11 months ago.

[11:18] You've been waiting an entire year.

[11:20] You've seen the SE people get their games

[11:23] like four or five months ago.

[11:24] So if you paid the most amount of money,

[11:26] you are now waiting the longest.

[11:28] I'm still confused.

[11:29] I don't know about you.

[11:30] I don't know about you Cactus Canyon buyers,

[11:32] but do you feel like you've gotten the communication

[11:35] from Ryan White and CTC on what exactly is the holdup?

[11:39] Like, are they using Unobtainium

[11:41] to build the train for this game?

[11:42] Like, what is the big holdup?

[11:44] And if they knew it was gonna take this long

[11:47] to get these parts, why did they unveil this game a year ago?

[11:50] I'm still confused by that.

[11:52] So here's the other thing though.

[11:53] So some people have got this game,

[11:55] and some people have been playing this game

[11:57] and enjoying this game,

[11:58] but there is an issue with Cactus Canyon

[12:01] that people are talking about.

[12:02] And some of the owners are noticing

[12:04] that the game's volume is lower than other CGC games.

[12:09] And so the volume on a Cactus Canyon

[12:11] where most games go up to like 21 or 22 volume,

[12:15] this only goes up to eight.

[12:17] And what people are saying is the sound in this game

[12:21] might be a little washed out

[12:23] and gets distorted as it gets louder.

[12:25] And no one's really sure what the issue is.

[12:27] Like, I've been reading the thread

[12:29] and does it affect every game?

[12:31] Does it only affect some games?

[12:32] It's really weird, right?

[12:34] How could a sound issue only impact

[12:36] a certain number of games?

[12:38] And so the speculation is this,

[12:40] that the sound in the game is washed out a little bit

[12:44] and it gets distorted as you make the game louder.

[12:47] So instead of fixing that problem,

[12:50] they maybe arbitrarily lowered your ability

[12:53] to make the game louder.

[12:55] And so that is what's happening right now.

[12:58] People have been trying to get an answer from CGC.

[13:01] Owners are trying to figure this out.

[13:02] But if you're in on a Cactus Canyon,

[13:04] I just want you to know that

[13:06] you're probably gonna wonder what the solve is here.

[13:10] Is it a code issue or is it a hardware issue?

[13:13] But regardless, the biggest issue

[13:15] with Chicago Gaming Company

[13:16] is still a communication issue.

[13:19] Where are you, Ryan White?

[13:21] Why is there no communication from this company?

[13:24] It has been almost a year.

[13:27] All right, so the other thing happening at CGC

[13:29] is Pulp Fiction is coming.

[13:31] It is supposedly coming out this year.

[13:34] It is gonna be a Raw Thrill's game.

[13:36] It is a single level game.

[13:38] Another single level game, right?

[13:40] All these single level games this year.

[13:42] Who knew single level pinball was so damn popular?

[13:44] But 2022, Pulp Fiction,

[13:46] we got Bond's 60th anniversary and TNA.

[13:49] But here's the other thing I heard.

[13:50] I heard from someone who knows more than I do.

[13:53] And they said,

[13:54] Franchi is on the artwork of this game.

[13:57] They also said that the license holder

[14:00] had a lot of control how this game would look

[14:04] and that it's not gonna blow people away artistically.

[14:08] Now, I don't even know what to make of this rumor.

[14:10] This is just a rumor,

[14:12] but that is what I'm hearing is

[14:13] that you're not gonna see Franchi unleashed.

[14:16] I think you might see Franchi with his hands tied

[14:19] on this game.

[14:20] I have to be completely honest.

[14:21] I'm so tired of this rumor,

[14:23] of this Mark Ritchie single level,

[14:26] no LCD screen, like Franchi on artwork, Pulp Fiction game.

[14:30] Just get this game out.

[14:32] CGC's inability to make progress on new titles

[14:36] is the reason why Ben Hex title with them

[14:38] is now just in his basement.

[14:39] I don't even think it's still on the schedule to happen.

[14:42] And CGC just seems like a company

[14:44] where they just can't get games out.

[14:46] All right, let's move on to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[14:48] So look, what's happening at Jersey Jack?

[14:50] They must be having meetings about where do we go now?

[14:53] Toy Story sales are not where they thought they'd be.

[14:56] Everybody knows it.

[14:57] Everybody knows that except for my friend Joe Newhart,

[15:00] who sent out a fun email yesterday that said,

[15:02] hey, here's how you can get your Toy Story

[15:04] and Collectors editions are sold out.

[15:07] But if you want one, let me know.

[15:10] I'll put you on the wait list and one spot might open up.

[15:13] I think if you want a Toy Story Collectors edition,

[15:16] just reach out to Joe.

[15:18] He'll take care of you.

[15:19] I don't think there's a wait list.

[15:21] I really don't.

[15:22] I think you'll be able to get one.

[15:23] I really don't think it's gonna be hard to get one.

[15:25] And I'm still curious on whether or not

[15:27] they make a thousand of them.

[15:28] And now I'm hearing this,

[15:30] that rumors are starting to swirl again

[15:33] that there might be another run of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:36] This is an evergreen rumor.

[15:38] And the reason why this rumor never goes away

[15:41] is it makes total business sense

[15:43] that they would remake Pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:46] It is one of the Jersey Jack games

[15:47] where people would not argue on $15,000 for the game.

[15:53] You know, we're seeing Pirates use self

[15:55] for much more than this.

[15:56] So from a business standpoint,

[15:58] it makes total sense right now, right?

[16:00] You've got Pat Lawler who yanked out the triple spinning disc

[16:03] from Eric's Pirates of the Caribbean.

[16:05] And now that Pat Lawler is gone

[16:07] and his games have underwhelmed

[16:09] and never sold to their potential,

[16:11] wouldn't it make total sense to say,

[16:13] hey Pat, we're gonna stop making your game

[16:16] and we're gonna make more of Eric's game

[16:17] because there's actually more demand for it.

[16:20] Here would be the dream scenario.

[16:21] They'll never do this,

[16:22] but this would be the dream scenario.

[16:24] Because Pat Lawler yanked out

[16:26] the triple spinning disc from Pirates,

[16:28] how amazing would it be if Jersey Jack pinball

[16:31] re-ran Pirates made some special version

[16:35] and actually put back into it the triple spinning disc?

[16:39] It works.

[16:40] Eric's engineering worked.

[16:42] The reason they took that disc out,

[16:44] it's all in episode 500.

[16:46] I should just let you guys hear that section of it one day.

[16:48] I mean it because it's a really interesting story.

[16:51] It was all about how when they sent the games

[16:54] to be played when they were prototypes,

[16:56] they used the wrong screws and the motor fell out

[16:58] and then Pat didn't wanna help

[17:00] and then he just said, yank it out.

[17:01] But the engineering was there.

[17:03] The software was there.

[17:04] The thing worked.

[17:05] The thing worked.

[17:06] And that is why Eric was so dejected when they took it out.

[17:10] It wasn't because his engineering was off.

[17:12] It's because Lawler pulled it from the game.

[17:15] But the Lawler period is over at Jersey Jack.

[17:18] I don't even know if Jersey Jack set up

[17:20] to make widebodies again.

[17:21] But that's the other thing I haven't really talked about.

[17:23] For $15,000 now, this company needs to go back

[17:28] to widebody fully featured, fully packed games.

[17:32] They're not gonna get away with standard games

[17:34] without much in it.

[17:35] They're just not gonna win there.

[17:36] All right, what else is happening with Jersey Jack?

[17:38] Replacement playfields for Guns N' Roses

[17:40] are now becoming available.

[17:42] I got the email from them.

[17:43] It's great.

[17:44] They're living up to what they said they would do.

[17:46] If you wanna buy a replacement,

[17:48] I believe it's 4.99 for the lower playfield.

[17:50] I think the upper one is 1.99

[17:53] and they will ship it to you.

[17:55] Now look, do I wanna spend this on it?

[17:57] No.

[17:58] Should I have to spend this on it after I spend 12.5

[18:01] and there's a known defect?

[18:02] I don't think so.

[18:04] But am I gonna buy it?

[18:05] Yes.

[18:06] Thankful they're doing this for me at cost.

[18:08] Yes, I'm not gonna begrudge them.

[18:10] And the reason why I'm not gonna begrudge them

[18:13] is my machine is still worth way more than 12.5.

[18:16] And I know none of us ever wanted playfield issues.

[18:19] It's on Mirko.

[18:20] I don't blame Jersey Jack.

[18:21] I still do blame Mirko.

[18:23] It was all Mirko who did it, man.

[18:25] And finally, I guess he figured it out

[18:27] with the new Toy Story playfields

[18:28] because we're not seeing any issues.

[18:29] Now, speaking of like Guns N' Roses CEs

[18:32] and where the value is at,

[18:34] there is a Guns N' Roses CE in mint condition

[18:38] with a powder coated coin door on pin side for $15,000.

[18:45] This is one of the cheapest G&R CEs I've ever seen.

[18:48] And I'm just telling you right now,

[18:50] instead of buying a Toy Story CE, I would buy the G&R.

[18:54] A, it's a better game.

[18:56] B, it's twice as rare.

[18:58] C, it's the most beautiful pinball machine ever made.

[19:00] It really is.

[19:01] When you stand over Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition,

[19:04] I challenge you to put another machine in modern times,

[19:07] even old times, that is more beautiful than G&R CE.

[19:11] And I can already hear the G&R haters

[19:13] just knowing about how it looks,

[19:14] Canadian, how it shoots.

[19:15] The game shoots fine.

[19:16] You guys have no fun.

[19:17] Drink a few whiskeys and play G&R at full volume

[19:21] and tell me you're not having fun.

[19:23] If you're not, you don't belong in pinball.

[19:24] All right, Stern pinball.

[19:25] What is going on over at Stern pinball?

[19:27] So I have an interesting theory to throw out there.

[19:30] I'm curious what you guys think about my theory.

[19:32] What's been Stern's biggest problem

[19:35] they can't make games fast enough, right?

[19:37] They have such a backlog on games

[19:40] and they had to actually hit pause on new game releases

[19:43] to make up all the old orders.

[19:46] Pinball is growing.

[19:47] Pinball is growing exponentially.

[19:49] More people are getting into this great hobby every month

[19:52] and because of that, there's more demand.

[19:55] And so think about if you're Stern,

[19:57] how do you start to chip away at the demand

[19:59] so your manufacturing doesn't suffocate?

[20:02] There's only one knob you can really turn

[20:05] because you still gotta get new games out every year

[20:07] because you've got contracts to get those games out.

[20:10] The only knob they can turn to slow demand on new games

[20:14] and still make all the games people are ordering every year

[20:17] is price.

[20:18] And that's what I think they're doing.

[20:20] They're raising the price of these games

[20:23] not to just follow suit with Jersey Jack,

[20:25] not to be greedy.

[20:27] I think they're also doing it

[20:28] to slow the demand down just a little bit

[20:32] and it will slow demand down just a little bit

[20:34] because I think they've run the numbers

[20:36] and they'll actually probably make more money

[20:39] selling like 3,000 of a game

[20:41] than if they made 4,000 of it for prices that are 40% less.

[20:45] And I think that's probably a little bit behind

[20:48] the price increase over at Stern.

[20:50] As I said, I think we're gonna see

[20:51] the Keith Elwin machine tomorrow.

[20:53] It's gonna be fun, everybody.

[20:54] Get the popcorn out.

[20:55] I just want everyone to get the popcorn ready

[20:58] when the distributors set the price

[21:00] for this James Bond Collector's Edition machine

[21:02] or this like 60th anniversary machine.

[21:04] Here's why it's gonna be fun to watch

[21:06] because think about it like this.

[21:08] How are the distributors gonna set the price?

[21:11] Are they all gonna get together?

[21:12] I could see it.

[21:13] It's like this spectra meeting of the colluminati

[21:16] of distributors, gentlemen.

[21:18] We have now been given the opportunity

[21:20] to price the Stern's 60th anniversary

[21:23] single level James Bond machine.

[21:25] We know this community spends money without thinking.

[21:29] We know Neil McCrae and Bill Brandis are out there.

[21:32] And we're being given these machines for $15,000.

[21:36] Ha ha ha.

[21:37] What should we price it at, gentlemen?

[21:40] Then you got like trends like, I don't know,

[21:41] maybe we could charge 18.

[21:43] Then another distributor is like,

[21:44] ah, no, 18, why don't we charge 20?

[21:46] And then like, gentlemen, you're all being short-sighted.

[21:49] I say we go for it all.

[21:51] These men have multi-million dollar homes.

[21:54] They wear $100,000 watches.

[21:56] Bill Brandis has how many Ferraris?

[21:58] Neil McCrae will buy 18 of these things

[22:01] just because, heck, Kim Mitchell bought a Raza.

[22:04] These men have the money.

[22:05] We should charge $30,000.

[22:08] That's $15,000 in each of your pockets.

[22:12] Who's with us?

[22:13] Let's all hold hands and do it together.

[22:15] You know, I don't know the way it's going to go.

[22:16] But I think there's going to be a lot, and I mean this,

[22:19] a lot of debating, a lot of crying,

[22:23] a lot of moaning and groaning, because what this game

[22:26] is going to do, I mean it, what this game is going to do,

[22:28] it's going to create a little bit of a civil war

[22:31] between the have-and-have-nots and the pinball community.

[22:34] We don't typically see a game like this

[22:36] where I think a lot of people would be open to owning it,

[22:39] but no one really wants to own it

[22:41] for like 15 to 20 to $30,000.

[22:44] So we will see what the price is.

[22:46] I wish Stern would stop this nonsense of like,

[22:48] you set the price, distributors.

[22:50] Stop with that.

[22:51] Just set the price, Stern.

[22:53] Be the bad guy.

[22:54] I mean, that's what they're doing.

[22:55] They don't want to be the bad guy.

[22:57] Stern's basically asking for immunity

[22:59] and being the bad guy on this greedy cash grab game.

[23:02] I mean, that's what they're doing by saying,

[23:04] hey, it's not us, we didn't set the price.

[23:06] Like, they set the price.

[23:07] Yeah, but why don't you give them the game

[23:08] and say you can't sell it for more than this?

[23:10] Here's the thing, if Stern really wanted James Bond fanatics

[23:14] to get a chance to own this machine

[23:16] and do it in a way that's just first come first serve

[23:18] and doesn't want to fleece the community,

[23:20] you know what they would do?

[23:21] They would sell this game directly.

[23:24] And I mean that, they would sell it directly

[23:26] the way Batman 66 SLE was sold.

[23:29] And here's why they're not selling it directly,

[23:31] because they care more about their distributors

[23:34] than they do about the customers.

[23:36] And that's just that, because their distributors

[23:38] are their lifeline.

[23:39] The distributors are their livelihood.

[23:42] The distributors are their sales force.

[23:44] So I get why they would look out for their distributors.

[23:46] But each and every one of you out there,

[23:48] I just want you to remember this.

[23:49] These pinball companies don't care about you

[23:52] as much as you think they care about the almighty dollar.

[23:56] Cause if they really wanted you to get this machine

[23:58] at the right price, they would just sell it to you.

[24:00] Because it's a one-off thing.

[24:02] I'm not asking them to do this on every game,

[24:04] but they could easily do that and they're not.

[24:06] They'd rather the distributors get wealthy

[24:09] than you get the game for the right price.

[24:11] All right, the other thing I know about Stern

[24:12] is that Venom is 100% done.

[24:14] It's done, it's been done for a while.

[24:16] Like they are probably playing this game

[24:18] like in the rec room at Stern for the last six months.

[24:20] Now the question becomes is when is Venom gonna come out?

[24:23] Are they gonna bring it out right after James Bond?

[24:26] I don't think so.

[24:26] Here's my guess.

[24:27] I think they're gonna bring out Jack Danger's game next.

[24:30] And then I think they're gonna bring out Venom

[24:33] in June of 2023 to coincide with Comic-Con.

[24:36] Even as I say that, I'm probably regretting it

[24:39] because Stern never times up stuff properly.

[24:41] But I think that's what's gonna happen.

[24:43] Jack Danger's next and then Venom.

[24:45] And then I think we're gonna see Elwin's game

[24:47] sometime in like September.

[24:49] And I also said this, I think they're gonna sneak in

[24:52] a Tron Vault Edition somewhere in the mix.

[24:55] And I also wanna say I hope George Gomez is recovering okay.

[24:58] There was this weird post by the super awesome pinball show

[25:01] that said, hey, we're wishing George Gomez a speedy recovery.

[25:04] And then they didn't say what was wrong.

[25:07] And then they took the post down.

[25:08] Really strange, but if anyone out there knows

[25:11] what's going on with George,

[25:12] we hope he's doing well and he recovers quickly.

[25:14] All right, so we're near the end.

[25:16] Dutch pinball, nothing new going over at Dutch pinball.

[25:19] They're making the games, EAs are starting to get their game.

[25:21] So that's good.

[25:22] No news on Haggis really.

[25:24] I mean, people are getting the games.

[25:25] Another company that I just wish would be more transparent.

[25:28] The final company I wanna cover is Pinball Brothers.

[25:31] So they ever released a new trailer for Queen Pinball.

[25:34] The video is really nice.

[25:35] I will say they put effort into this video.

[25:38] A pinball machine should launch for the first time

[25:41] with a really nice piece of content we can share.

[25:44] Yeah, I think they gotta find a way to get this machine

[25:46] into the Queen fan base more.

[25:48] You know, the video's got like 4,700 views,

[25:51] which is basically not much when you're Queen.

[25:54] You know, that's a huge ban.

[25:55] In the video itself, there's a faster version

[25:58] of We Will Rock You.

[25:59] Queen used to sing the song that way live.

[26:02] And remember, the songs in this game are gonna be

[26:05] from live recordings of Queen, not the studio songs.

[26:08] You know, and I don't think this is gonna be a problem

[26:10] because Queen sounded amazing live.

[26:12] The only thing is this, the video is nicely polished.

[26:15] The video is very well done, but go watch the video again

[26:19] and watch the pinball action in it.

[26:21] I kept watching it and I'm like,

[26:23] there's really not much in this game.

[26:26] It doesn't look like there's many mechs in the game.

[26:29] It's just not a very populated pinball machine.

[26:32] And for this much money, you know,

[26:34] putting it next to James Bond and games like Godzilla Premium

[26:38] and Jurassic Park and all the other games that are available,

[26:41] I think the game comes up a little bit short,

[26:43] in my honest opinion.

[26:45] I mean, the whole thing feels like Guns N' Roses-like.

[26:47] It feels like G&R with half as much in it.

[26:50] And the whole experience,

[26:52] like if it's a concert going experience,

[26:54] is like three times as light as Guns N' Roses.

[26:57] So if you ask me, you know, if you're a fan of Queen, cool,

[27:00] but I actually would rather own a Guns N' Roses LE

[27:03] than this machine.

[27:04] And like, I can already hear the people being like,

[27:06] but canade, this machine's gonna shoot better

[27:08] than Guns N' Roses.

[27:09] You know, it's funny about Guns N' Roses

[27:11] and everyone who says it shoots like crap.

[27:13] Then how did a game that shoots like crap

[27:14] sell almost 5,000 units?

[27:16] Oh man, nobody cares about gameplay.

[27:18] Anyway, everybody, I think that's it.

[27:19] Did I miss anybody?

[27:20] I went around the horn.

[27:21] I'm trying to think if there's anyone I skipped,

[27:23] I don't think so.

[27:24] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[27:26] It's a lot of fun.

[27:27] For those of you going to Pinball Expo

[27:30] and your fans of Canadian Pinball Podcast,

[27:32] a little bit of bad news.

[27:33] I won't be going to the show this year.

[27:36] So that's that.

[27:37] I'm not really gonna talk a lot about that.

[27:39] I'm just trying to make sure everyone has a good time.

[27:41] And you know, Canadians got his fans,

[27:43] Canadians got his haters,

[27:44] and everyone is holding on to a lot of anger.

[27:46] There's nothing I can do.

[27:47] I'm always open to talk and discuss anything with anybody.

[27:50] Everybody, have a great day and be good.

[27:52] And we'll be back.

[27:53] We might be back tomorrow

[27:54] if we see the 60th anniversary game.

[27:56] We're out.

[27:57] I love it, I love it, I love it.

[28:00] I love it.

[28:06] I love it.
