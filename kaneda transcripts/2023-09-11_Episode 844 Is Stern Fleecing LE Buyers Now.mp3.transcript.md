[00:00] Bougie like nady in the Styrofoam, squeaky squeaky in the truck head all the way home.

[00:06] It's the map of Amateur Machine, my Dixieland delight.

[00:09] That's how we do, how we do.

[00:11] Set us up, set us up, set us up, set us up, set us up.

[00:15] Aw, welcome everybody.

[00:17] Happy Monday.

[00:18] It's Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:19] It was nice hanging out with people on the Saturday morning spectacular.

[00:23] We took a few weeks off.

[00:24] We went to the gym.

[00:25] We got a new positive attitude and everybody came right back.

[00:28] We've got 610 club members.

[00:30] Thank you everybody for being a member of the show.

[00:32] So here's what I want to talk about on this episode.

[00:34] A couple of news items.

[00:36] Well, maybe not really news items, but some suggestions I have for a company out there

[00:40] named Spooky Pimball.

[00:42] I'm in the thread.

[00:43] I'm reading about people downloading the latest code updates for games like Halloween,

[00:48] games like Scooby-Doo, and people are having all of these bug issues.

[00:52] Now look, the one bug issue we like having is bug over at Spooky.

[00:56] But man, all of these buggy software updates at Spooky Pimball, I want to talk about that

[01:02] for a little bit.

[01:03] And then I want to make this show topic about one simple thing.

[01:06] Is Stern burning the collector market in Pimball?

[01:11] Have they taken the collectible market and have they sort of fleeced their own buyer base

[01:16] over the last couple of years?

[01:18] And is it going to work out for them in the long run?

[01:22] We're all waiting for new games to come out.

[01:24] We're all waiting to see if Chicago Pimball Expo will reveal new games to the world.

[01:28] But if you've been on my Facebook page and you went to Pinside, someone did a great data

[01:33] analysis of how much game prices have increased over the last couple of years.

[01:39] And prices were really steady for many, many years, like really steady.

[01:43] The prices of pros, the prices of premiums, the prices of le's, they held pretty steady.

[01:48] There were marginal increases over time.

[01:52] But now we're seeing a spike.

[01:54] And this is not the good spike system we've seen at Stern with their computing boards.

[01:58] This is a spike in just, hey, used to spend $10,000 on an LE, now it's going to be $13,000

[02:05] for every single one.

[02:06] Used to spend like $7,500, $8,000 on a premium, now it's $10,000 or $9,500 for every single

[02:12] premium.

[02:13] And can this last much longer?

[02:15] We will talk about that.

[02:17] But it's really that price scourging at the top I want to talk about.

[02:21] And we all know that the limited edition games, they don't sell in mass volume.

[02:25] Well, they didn't used to when there was only 500 and it was truly limited.

[02:29] But there's something about the way Stern Pimbal, I think, is treating the high end

[02:34] collectible market and the collector out there.

[02:37] And those are the very people that you don't want to piss off.

[02:41] I'm going to talk about why you can't leave those people behind.

[02:43] All right, before we get there, let's talk about a few things I've also been noticing.

[02:47] What is with people who have bought a Venom LE and are already selling it for a loss?

[02:53] I don't get this.

[02:54] I think Delt used to be a member of this show and he does this frequently.

[02:58] He buys every single new Pimbal machine, but I don't get how people are already selling

[03:03] Venom LEs for $12,500 and the game hasn't even been made yet.

[03:09] How is anybody still speculating in Pimbal?

[03:12] And what I mean by speculating, how is anybody allowing FOMO to get the best of them where

[03:17] they're committing to buying one of these new games with non-refundable deposits?

[03:23] And we know that a lot of dealers and distros now, if you want to go in on a Stern LE now,

[03:28] you've got to commit once that game is revealed.

[03:31] And everyone's learning this lesson right now.

[03:33] It's a fool's commitment.

[03:35] There is only really a few times, maybe every couple of years, where you better act quickly

[03:40] or you're not going to be able to get the game for MSRP.

[03:44] And what we've seen since like 2023 began is almost every single new Pimbal machine

[03:49] that has come out, almost every single new machine has lost about 10 to 20% in value

[03:55] over its new in box price.

[03:57] 10 to 20% loss in value.

[04:00] If you just wait it, you can get it for much cheaper.

[04:03] There's really only one game that has held its value and actually is making money for

[04:08] people that speculate it and that is Pulp Fiction LE.

[04:12] And that's kind of funny too because that game was revealed in March.

[04:15] It's really not even going to be made until March of 2024, but I just saw someone sold

[04:20] their spot for $2,500 over the $2,500 deposit they put down on the game.

[04:27] You know, there's going to be a thousand Pulp Fiction LEs and I do think this is going

[04:31] to happen with Pulp Fiction.

[04:32] I think if you want to make the most money you're ever going to make on the game, I would

[04:36] flip your spot right now because a thousand units of anything is a lot.

[04:41] I think it's going to be really easy to get a Pulp Fiction LE once they actually start

[04:47] making them.

[04:48] You know, right now people are just trading in hypotheticals because nobody knows exactly

[04:52] when the game is going to come out and the game is not real yet.

[04:55] Once they start cranking these games out and there are 1000 of them in boxes in the world

[05:00] and they were what like $9,500 or $9,750.

[05:04] Once that's real and that game comes out exactly at the same time Jaws comes out exactly at

[05:11] the same time other games are going to come out.

[05:13] We're going to see new games from maybe Dutch pinball by the end of the year, a New Jersey

[05:17] Jack game, a new game from Spooky Pinball, maybe Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[05:22] The cycle is going to start up again and Pulp Fiction has had a lot of hype but I've never

[05:26] seen a game where the hype continues year after year after year and it's a little bit

[05:32] of a weird thing, right?

[05:33] Because we've seen the game, we've got hyped by the gameplay video and now what's going

[05:38] to happen in March of 2024?

[05:40] Are we still going to be clamoring for a Pulp Fiction or are we going to move on to the

[05:44] latest and greatest from Stern and everybody else?

[05:47] That's why I wouldn't worry if you really want a Pulp Fiction LE, I think you're going

[05:50] to be able to get one.

[05:51] I don't care what the game is anymore.

[05:53] Every time a new game comes out now, when the high end trim has a thousand units, go

[05:57] on the marketplace.

[05:58] Look at Godfather CE, Toy Story 4 CE, look at Foo Fighters LE, look at James Bond LE,

[06:04] look at Venom LE.

[06:06] Every single LE now is easy to get.

[06:10] Every single one.

[06:11] And FOMO isn't really that alive and well anymore.

[06:14] And for any of you out there who bought these games without playing them first, without

[06:18] thinking about it, I almost feel bad for you because what excites me about these high prices

[06:23] now and everybody is just waiting is you actually get to play the game.

[06:28] Think about this novel concept.

[06:29] You actually get to go to shows and play the game and make sure you really want it before

[06:36] you have to commit to a non-refundable deposit on an LE or a collector's edition.

[06:42] Who out there?

[06:43] Let's just say you really, really love the Godfather and you really love the collector's

[06:47] edition of the Godfather.

[06:48] Who out there wouldn't rather spend $12.5 on one than $15,000?

[06:54] Speaking of Godfather CE, did you see the guy who hacked up his topper because he's

[06:59] in a low ceiling game room and then he made the topper into two parts that connect to

[07:04] the sides of the game?

[07:06] Look, it's his game.

[07:07] He can do what he wants with it.

[07:08] Would I do that?

[07:09] No.

[07:10] And the main reason I would never do that, because now you can never really sell that

[07:14] game because anyone who buys a Godfather CE is going to want to have the topper with

[07:19] the game.

[07:20] And so if I were him, I would have just left the topper off, put it in a box.

[07:25] Don't do that.

[07:26] Because now you've just ruined maybe the only thing that really makes that game special

[07:30] because all the other ornamentation is available on the freaking LE now with the new accessory

[07:36] package from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[07:37] You know what I'm going to do?

[07:38] I might buy the accessory package for Jersey Jack Pinball's the Godfather, but I'm not

[07:43] going to buy the Godfather Pinball machine.

[07:45] I'm looking at Killian's crib right now.

[07:48] I think this crib would look great if I put those silver leg bracket things on the sides

[07:53] of Killian's crib.

[07:54] I don't think anyone's ever done this before.

[07:56] Bought an accessory kit for a pinball machine to use on their child's crib, not on a pinball

[08:03] machine itself.

[08:04] I think I'm going to do that.

[08:05] I'm going to call Joe at Pinball Star and see what kind of deal I can get on just those

[08:09] leg bolt things that add silver.

[08:11] I don't know.

[08:12] You just knock into them.

[08:13] I don't even know what the point of them is.

[08:14] I think people are going to learn their lesson about speculation or let's talk real quickly

[08:18] about spooky code updates.

[08:20] How many times do we have to go into the spooky threads and listen to people who have downloaded

[08:26] the latest code and they're having issues with the code?

[08:30] It's usually like Spooky's adding stuff that's new to the game.

[08:33] And then that messes up older things that were working properly before the new code was

[08:38] installed.

[08:39] And there's an easy solution here and spooky pinball.

[08:41] I know you listen to this show.

[08:43] What you need to do before you release a code to the public, stop using your buyers as your

[08:50] beta testers.

[08:52] All you need to do is get like 15 people or 10 die hard spooky fanatics who play their

[08:58] games all the time, make those people your beta testers and have them bang on the game

[09:04] for a few weeks before you release a code to the public.

[09:08] I mean how many times are we going to see them release a code and then instantly, I mean

[09:12] on day one, people who are banging on the machine, they find the issues right away.

[09:17] I know you're excited.

[09:19] I know you want people to see the potential of the games they bought.

[09:23] I know you're putting a lot into these machines code wise, but you need to slow down.

[09:29] Take a pause and make sure that what you release, you've gone over it with a fine comb and caught

[09:36] all the potential issues.

[09:37] And that doesn't mean there's not going to be issues down the road, but it's feeling

[09:41] like you're just releasing stuff way too early.

[09:45] So that's my advice to Spooky.

[09:47] And if you ask people on pin side Spooky, hey, show of hands, who wants to be beta testers

[09:52] for our new code, you would easily get like 50 people that would do it for free.

[09:57] You don't even have to spend any money to get quality control testing with your company.

[10:02] I can't be a beta tester because I don't even play pinball these days because I've been

[10:06] waiting for Jack Barr to get a Venom before I go back over there.

[10:09] I hope he gets it sometime soon.

[10:11] Oh man, what else is going on in the pinball world?

[10:14] We saw a video from Haggis Pinball in which Damien is telling us the games are going to

[10:19] be done.

[10:20] The games are going to be done by the end of the year.

[10:22] Okay, well take his word for it.

[10:24] But how many times are we going to get a guy?

[10:26] And he does this every single time.

[10:28] How many videos are we going to get from the factory in which we see no factory workers?

[10:34] We see no games being built.

[10:36] They're using their own machines as props to convince us everything is going well at

[10:40] the factory.

[10:41] The one thing Damien still will not do for any of us.

[10:44] He will not go Facebook live on a random Wednesday and show us how many people are working there,

[10:50] how many games are they making a week?

[10:51] None of it.

[10:52] He's not transparent.

[10:53] And it's so obvious why he's going to this new Castle Pinball show which he shouldn't

[10:58] even be going to.

[10:59] He should be finishing all the fathoms because I have friends who have waited like nine months

[11:03] for games.

[11:04] What he should be doing is that, but the reason why he's going to the show, it's so damn

[11:08] obvious.

[11:09] They didn't sell that many centaurs and he needs to sell more centaurs and lock in deposits

[11:15] from people who don't know the backstory on what's gone on with the fathom builds.

[11:19] He needs to get that new money.

[11:21] Rob Peter to pay Paul.

[11:22] He needs to get those new orders so he can finish those fathom machines by the end of

[11:27] the year and pay for all of his rent and his overhead and everything else going on there.

[11:32] But there is no way that this big factory that Damien put his company into, there is

[11:37] no way they are efficiently making money if it's not running properly.

[11:42] And I think it's just him and a few people screwing these games together and they're

[11:46] making just a handful of them a week and I get it, but is that good enough?

[11:52] Is that good enough to keep Haggis Pimbal afloat for a long time and we shall see people.

[11:57] But again, the fact that he just won't walk around the factory, I don't understand.

[12:01] Like, I'll give you a tour of my apartment.

[12:03] I'll give you a tour of where I work on my nine to five marketing career.

[12:06] Why would I hide what's going on?

[12:08] If you want to convince people that production is going and it's on schedule, then show us.

[12:13] Just walk around.

[12:14] I don't care if it's two or three people, but why can't he just show us?

[12:17] Here's what production at Haggis Pimbal looks like and that is a red flag to me.

[12:22] All right, so Stern Pimbal and the collectors and all of these individuals out there that

[12:27] have been buying these Stern LEs year after year after year.

[12:31] You see what's happening?

[12:33] I think people looked at that visual, that data chart that I put up on my Facebook page

[12:37] and that shows you very crystal clearly.

[12:41] Stern didn't just take the price up a little bit.

[12:44] They took it up a lot.

[12:46] And we're talking about a 30% increase in price.

[12:50] The biggest significant price increase in the history of Stern Pimbal by a lot.

[12:55] And it wasn't just the LEs that went up a lot.

[12:58] The premiums went up a lot too.

[13:00] The pros didn't go up as much exponentially.

[13:03] But man, those LE buyers, when you think about it, I feel like everybody is just feeling

[13:08] this lately.

[13:10] For $13,000, no topper, additional accessories cost extra.

[13:18] Mostly not free shipping for most of you out there.

[13:21] For $13,000, did Stern Pimbal go after the Golden Goose and kill it?

[13:28] Did they look at their buyer base that has kept them afloat with all of these super

[13:33] expensive games?

[13:34] Because that's where the real profit margin is with them.

[13:36] The LEs are where they make the most money easily.

[13:40] So why couldn't they just be good enough with doubling the amount of LEs they made?

[13:45] That's the question I want to ask you.

[13:47] When a Godzilla LE was $10,500 and they sold all of them, wasn't that enough for Stern?

[13:55] Alright, let's just say they go from $10,500 to $11,000.

[13:59] They doubled the amount of LEs they would make, which instantly made each one not as

[14:05] collectible.

[14:06] It's like the only thing that makes an LE special now in the world of Stern Pimbal is

[14:11] its price.

[14:12] And I don't like that.

[14:14] It never used to be that way.

[14:16] That wasn't what made the LE special.

[14:18] What made the LE special was that it was truly limited and there was really like extra stuff

[14:23] in the game where you could somewhat, and I mean this, it was always this debate, you

[14:27] could somewhat justify the difference between an LE and a premium.

[14:32] But even when you look at these latest LEs like James Bond Premium and James Bond LE,

[14:37] look at those two games next to each other.

[14:39] They almost look exactly the same.

[14:42] Look at Venom LE next to Venom Premium.

[14:44] They almost look exactly the same.

[14:46] I don't even think Stern is changing the artwork on the translate between Venom Premium and

[14:53] Venom LE.

[14:54] And even with like Foo Fighters, they almost look exactly the same.

[14:58] The cabinet artwork on Foo Fighters Premium and LE, it's just a different color, but it's

[15:03] exactly the same artwork.

[15:05] Did Stern not expect us to see this stuff?

[15:08] Like they're actually putting less in it to differentiate the game and then they're going

[15:13] to charge us $3,000 more over what Godzilla LE was.

[15:19] And it's a hard pill to swallow and when you see it, there's just something about seeing

[15:23] it visually like that.

[15:25] It makes you say to yourself, well, wait a minute.

[15:27] Why is this pinball machine where they're not putting any more or any extra into it?

[15:32] Why am I paying this much more?

[15:35] Is your company giving you a 30% raise?

[15:38] Mine isn't.

[15:39] In fact, it's been the opposite where I work.

[15:40] They froze everybody's salary increases for the last two years if you were at a certain

[15:45] level.

[15:46] So I'm not making as much money as I was two years ago.

[15:50] Inflation is eating away at everything else.

[15:52] Whenever I go to spend money, it feels like just dinner for two in New York City.

[15:55] Get ready to drop $150 to $200.

[15:58] And I'm starting to travel more.

[15:59] I'm flying more.

[16:00] I'm spending money on other things.

[16:02] And so when I look at these pinball prices and they've gone up more than anything else

[16:06] in my life, like the increase in a pinball price is more than my local restaurants increasing

[16:11] their prices.

[16:12] It's more than the auto industry.

[16:13] It's more than anywhere else.

[16:15] 30% more, 40% more on some of these titles.

[16:18] And it's like, where does Stern's greed end?

[16:21] And that's my other question is, where does it end?

[16:23] Why did they price James Bond's 60th at $20,000?

[16:28] They put that price tag on it somewhere within the halls of Stern.

[16:32] And you know, it was like Seth Davis's decision.

[16:35] That's how they feel about us.

[16:37] And not only did Stern price it at that, but how many people out there who sold the game

[16:42] were telling all of us, oh, they priced it right because you should see where second

[16:46] hand game sales are going and they know what they're doing.

[16:49] Now those same people that were saying that are selling this freaking game for $14,000.

[16:54] $14,000.

[16:55] Are they apologizing for how off they were on how they were trying to convince you that

[17:00] this game was worth $20,000?

[17:02] Nope, not a single apology.

[17:04] It's funny to me watching the way it's all shifting in favor of us, the buyer.

[17:08] No longer is the power in the hands of the distributor where we're banging on their doors

[17:13] trying to get on an LE list.

[17:15] The exact opposite is happening now.

[17:17] What are they doing?

[17:18] They're banging on our doors to buy these damn LEs because they need us to take their

[17:22] James Bond inventory off their hands.

[17:25] They need us to take their Venom inventory off their hands.

[17:27] They're desperate to get rid of their Godfather inventory.

[17:30] Oh my gosh, are they desperate to get rid of their Galactic Tank Force inventory?

[17:34] There are like distributors out there saying, hey, this game's a lot of fun.

[17:37] You can buy it from me now.

[17:38] And then the next post on Pinsight is people playing it at a show and being like, this

[17:41] game is total trash.

[17:43] American pinball needs to rethink everything.

[17:45] So who's right?

[17:46] Right?

[17:47] They're not just polarizing as Galactic Tank Force, but of course distributors who have

[17:51] that game sitting in inventory, what do you think they're going to tell you about the

[17:56] game?

[17:57] Of course they're going to tell you they're loving it and they're having so much fun

[18:00] playing it because they need to sell you one.

[18:03] And look, it's so funny to watch all of this because the power is now ours.

[18:07] The power is in the hands of the consumer and the buyer.

[18:11] And we're just waiting.

[18:12] It's so funny to watch all of my pinball friends that are rushing at these things like it's

[18:17] 2019.

[18:18] And I've got a bunch of friends that have done that.

[18:20] They haven't changed their behavior.

[18:22] And every single one of my pinball friends who has not changed their behavior, they are

[18:26] losing money hand over fist.

[18:28] And look, some of them can afford to lose money hand over fist, but for the rest of us, how

[18:33] much fun is it sitting on the sidelines every few weeks going into the Pinsight Marketplace

[18:39] and seeing all the deals on all of these new and box games?

[18:43] That's where the deals are now.

[18:45] Now look, I would argue I don't even know if they're deals because all of these games

[18:48] were so overpriced to begin with that I don't even know where the bottom is.

[18:53] We know where the ceiling is.

[18:54] The ceiling is where they started these games with MSRP.

[18:57] But when you think about it, it's just kind of comical to see the new and box pinball

[19:01] space not even know what to do next.

[19:03] All these companies strategies are not working out.

[19:06] And then you go to the used pinball market and it's still stupid.

[19:09] It's still stupid land where like people think every used game now is worth so much money

[19:13] and they're not moving.

[19:15] You just don't see sale pending as much as you used to.

[19:19] Games used to be priced right and they would move pretty quickly.

[19:22] Now games are priced so high up they're not moving at all.

[19:26] And I love it.

[19:27] I love seeing this because it just shows each and every one of us that like He-Man said

[19:32] we do have the power to control the pinball marketplace and Stern Pinball has led the

[19:38] charge in killing the Golden Goose.

[19:41] And Jersey Jack idiotically followed them by pricing two of the most mediocre games

[19:45] they've ever made at the highest price pinball has ever been priced next to a few super limited

[19:51] edition games.

[19:52] Was Jersey Jack really thinking they were going to sell Toy Story for $15,000 and the

[19:57] Godfather for $15,000?

[20:00] That's what they think about us.

[20:01] You know if you have money, if you're rich and you make a lot of money, you became rich

[20:05] because you're very discerning with how you spend your money.

[20:08] And that's why I love it.

[20:09] Rich people are smart.

[20:10] Last time I checked, rich people are really smart and they don't like losing money on

[20:15] any investment.

[20:16] And so you're not going to fool anybody like who is fooled by this stuff.

[20:19] And so the next few months are going to be so eye-opening because what's going to happen

[20:24] over the next few months mark my words people as we head into the holidays and as distributors

[20:29] are seeing six and seven figures of inventory pile up inside their factories.

[20:36] They're not used to it.

[20:37] We are going to get spammed like never before from freaking distributors to help them out

[20:41] of their inventory issues.

[20:43] And you're going to hear more and more, I need you to buy this, I need you to buy that.

[20:46] We just got this used game and they're going to have to work harder than ever to make those

[20:50] deals happen.

[20:52] And the distributors that are hustling are going to be the only ones that survive because

[20:56] you're not going to be able to sit back anymore and just have people bang on your door for

[21:00] the next LE because that doesn't work.

[21:03] You know what I really want?

[21:04] I want a game that makes me want to bang on a distributor door.

[21:07] I want a game that makes me want to be on the LE list.

[21:10] I haven't seen a game like that in a long time.

[21:13] I haven't.

[21:14] I've seen some good games.

[21:15] There's been some decent games this year.

[21:16] There's been some total misses.

[21:18] But man, where's that game that is like take my money now?

[21:22] That's what we're waiting for.

[21:23] And man, it's a lot of money now.

[21:25] It's a lot of money now they want to take.

[21:27] So I think Stern has made a mistake.

[21:28] I think if I were them, they're going to need to figure something out because every game

[21:32] is not going to be a Keith Elwin game.

[21:35] Every game is not going to be a triple A theme.

[21:37] And I don't think people are going to fall for it.

[21:39] And I think they're going to start to see more and more distributors not order every

[21:42] single new Stern that comes out because they gamble now and the risk.

[21:47] They're not going to be able to make enough money on JAWS to make up for all the money

[21:50] they lost on Venom if they have to put in a huge Venom order, right?

[21:54] Because what do you do with all that inventory?

[21:56] If you want to get this many JAWS machines, you have to commit to buying this many Venoms,

[22:00] you're going to get screwed.

[22:01] Like you're going to be burning the candle at both ends and it's not going to work out.

[22:05] Ah, everybody, happy Monday, Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[22:09] I also can't wait for one of these new games to come out.

[22:11] One of these mystery companies.

[22:12] Now's the window.

[22:13] You should get your game out now and have it playable at Expo.

[22:18] You know, there's nothing really else happening in the pinball world right now.

[22:22] It would be the perfect time to drop a new surprise into the pinball space.

[22:27] Everybody, happy Monday.

[22:28] I'll be back this week with more shows.

[22:30] Thank you for being a club member.

[22:32] I always enjoy putting on the headphones, talking into this mic about pinball for like

[22:36] an hour a week.

[22:37] And I love the fact that you guys get this content exclusively.

[22:40] This is still my favorite thing to do.

[22:42] Saturday morning is fun, but I love this because I love how we can just pick a topic, stay focused

[22:46] on it, talk about it, and then we're in and out without lasting like 90 minutes about

[22:51] what I did over the weekend.

[22:52] Everybody have a great day.

[22:53] We'll talk to you soon.

[22:54] Bye.
