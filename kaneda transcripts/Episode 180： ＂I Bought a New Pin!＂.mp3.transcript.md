[00:00] One few more times, get old childhood mine, I wonder if you have the stuff I put you for those crimes

[00:05] To be honest, it's a hard role, just keep it fake and God don't win you can scarth

[00:09] Though, look at him walking and talking a little chat with my eyes in my phone

[00:13] So watch over Lil C, tell me God's amount

[00:22] Welcome to episode 180 of Canadian Pimball Podcast

[00:28] That's incredible, we're at 180

[00:30] This is going to be a special sort of Thanksgiving episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast

[00:35] I have some really really big news for everyone out there

[00:38] I have bought a new Pimball machine

[00:41] And I know what you're saying for those of you out there who think I jump on all these Pimball preorder lists

[00:46] And then I back out, I've actually bought and paid for my next machine

[00:51] And I'm super excited, I think you're going to be kind of shocked when you hear what machine I'm getting

[00:56] I think you're going to be a little bit shocked because of some of the comments I've made on this machine

[01:01] But I'm going to explain why as we get to the end of this episode

[01:05] But before we do that, I want to break this episode into a few parts

[01:09] First, it's Thanksgiving tomorrow

[01:12] So I want to just give some shout outs on all the things I'm thankful for when it comes to this hobby

[01:19] And I want to just go down a little list and thank everything that I appreciate

[01:23] That comes into my world and I know many of your worlds when it comes to the Pimball hobby

[01:28] Then we're going to do some Pimball news, some stuff that's been going on like we normally do

[01:33] And then I'm going to tell you what machine I got and then I'm going to wrap it up

[01:36] And I'm going to let you go upon your day and enjoy your Thanksgiving

[01:41] And your Pimball and your families and all the good stuff that comes with the holidays, alright?

[01:46] Okay, so it's Thanksgiving tomorrow

[01:49] And it is, you know, in my household, eat

[01:52] Man, Thanksgiving is usually a time where there's a lot of arguing, a lot of bickering

[01:56] And I think it's hard sometimes for people to step back and just think about all the blessings we have in this world

[02:03] And especially how blessed life is if you're at a point where you actually can enjoy something like a Pimball machine

[02:11] Right? You look at all the troubles in the world and all the troubles people have in life

[02:15] And we're enjoying a toy, I mean that's it, I mean all of us, I think, sort of have this

[02:21] A little bit of an arrested state of development where we refuse to fully grow up

[02:25] Right? We've all refused to become that adult that people wanted us to be

[02:30] That the child inside all of us is still alive and well

[02:34] And wants to open up a room inside the house and see Pimball machines and arcade machines

[02:40] And other toys that bring us joy or collectible action figures, whatever it is

[02:44] It makes you smile and makes you passionate about moving forward through life

[02:50] So I just want to say like thank you first and foremost to all the listeners out there of Canadian Pimball podcasts

[02:58] I mean it's great, this podcast when it came out almost two years ago, it might have been more than two years ago

[03:04] I didn't know how it was going to go, I didn't know if anyone would listen, I didn't know if anyone would care

[03:09] And I think we've got a nice sort of listener base, we're probably not the most listened to Pimball podcasts out there for obvious reasons

[03:16] Right? I don't talk about tournament play, I don't really go deep into code, I don't go and you know almost like I cover the hobby through the lens

[03:24] I think of more of the collector and more of the forum activist for lack of a better word

[03:32] But I want to thank each and every one of you, it's a little bit over a thousand we get every podcast around 1200

[03:39] So there are 1200 people out there in the world that every week tune into this show so I want to say thank you

[03:45] I want to thank all of the forum fans out there and all of the Pimball forum creators and moderators out there in the world

[03:53] The guys like Robin, the people who set up Rex. Games Pimball

[03:58] And all the people who populate those sites and you know who you are, there's so many of you, I can't name all of you

[04:04] But I think without the forums and without the fans online talking about Pimball all day long

[04:11] This hobby never would be where it's at, it would not have survived, right?

[04:15] Because there wouldn't be a marketplace if there wasn't a place to get together and talk about machines and buying them and restoring them

[04:23] And that really brought new people into the hobby because when you're new to a hobby you want to go somewhere where you can share your passion

[04:31] And look, for all of my differences and all of my sort of rancid and raves about Pinside, it's still the best Pimball forum on the planet

[04:43] And I think Robin and the moderation staff do a really good job in creating a place where you can talk about Pimball in a way that's easy to sort, easy to follow

[04:53] You know, I love the fact that there's Aussie arcade forum out there

[04:57] I love the fact that there's like, was it Pimball, I'm gonna get the name wrong, Pimball Light, the UK forum? I think I got the name wrong

[05:04] But you know what I'm talking about, there are these pockets where Pimball fans come together and I think it's great that they exist

[05:10] I also think it's funny that I've been banned by almost everyone that my behavior is just so toxic and so bad that they can't allow me through the doors

[05:20] But you know, I hope they listen to this show because if they did they'd realize that nothing I say is really that bad

[05:27] And nothing I discuss isn't something that other people are discussing

[05:32] And yes, I've gone on missions to expose things to you that need to be exposed both on the manufacturing front and both by certain Pinside personalities who deserve to be called out every once in a while

[05:45] But I think this show has become a lot more positive and I think that has led to more people tuning in

[05:50] Alright, I want to thank all the manufacturers out there making Pimball machines, right? I mean, it's crazy to me that companies in 2017 are still manufacturing Pimball machines

[06:02] That there are Pimball assembly lines that are alive and well in 2017

[06:08] You know, when you look at the Stern Factory tour, I think every time we complain about Stern, I wish everyone would just go see all the people that have to come together

[06:18] And the factories and the tools and the time that goes into making these machines and of course it's easy to focus on some of the mistakes that are made during manufacturing

[06:29] It's easy to focus on some of the cost-cutting efforts that companies make to stay in business

[06:33] But the key is this, to stay in business, Stern does what Stern needs to do to keep that company going

[06:41] And without Stern, there would be nobody else, okay?

[06:45] Without Jersey Jack Pimball, the quality of machines would not be elevated

[06:50] Without Spooky Pimball, right? The boutique fun sort of, you know, new to the game player wouldn't be part of the hobby

[06:59] You know, all those three Stern, J.J.P. and Spooky, the triumvirant of Pimball manufacturers

[07:05] They all play a really important role in this hobby and I'm really thankful for all three of them for the different products and services they provide

[07:13] And also, they're a different approach to making Pimball, okay? They're the good guys

[07:19] I'll put into that Chicago Gaming and PPS

[07:23] They're also, you know, they're doing it right, they're making games that are fun that people can buy, own and enjoy

[07:29] There's some newcomers that were thankful for, right? I'm thankful that American Pimball is doing it the right way with Houdini

[07:35] I'm thankful that they didn't take people's money, right?

[07:38] You know, and the other companies out there, highway Pimball, Dutch Pimball

[07:43] I'm thankful that they've attempted to make Pimball machines

[07:46] I'm not thankful for how they've sort of transpired with their customers

[07:52] But what's interesting and what we all should be thankful for is that in 2017

[07:57] There are more manufacturers making new and box Pimball machines in terms of number of manufacturers

[08:03] than there were during the 1990 heyday of Pimball

[08:07] And that's incredible! It also may seem incredibly stupid, but it's incredible that that's where we're at

[08:14] You know, the demand is not going, is nowhere near the supply of games coming out

[08:19] And we won't talk about that on this Thanksgiving podcast, but we'll talk about that in a later date

[08:24] But it's incredible, and we all should be thankful that we have so many options when it comes to Pimball machines

[08:30] I want to thank all the Facebook friends of mine that I talk with on a daily basis

[08:34] Because what makes this hobby great is not just the machines we love, but it's the people that make the machines

[08:41] And make disgusting the machines so entertaining, because let's all be honest with ourselves

[08:46] We probably talk about Pimball more than we actually play it

[08:51] Maybe that's not true for the diehard tournament guys or the league guys who are obsessed with playing

[08:56] But for most of us, I think most of you on this podcast who listen, we love talking about it

[09:01] So I want to say thank you to all those guys, you know who you are

[09:04] You make this hobby for me, really enjoyable day in and day out

[09:08] Much more than playing a machine could

[09:11] I want to say thank you to all the show organizers that are out there

[09:15] Okay, so guys like Ed, down in Texas

[09:18] All the different Pimball expos and shows that go on are incredible

[09:23] And the amount of hard work, right?

[09:25] The amount of hard work that goes into shows like, fantastically Gabe

[09:29] It's a very thankless profession at time to organize these Pimball shows

[09:35] And these Pimball tournaments and these expos and these free plays

[09:38] You know, lugging these machines

[09:40] Thank you to all of you who bring your machines to these shows and expos

[09:44] And put them in your trucks and your haulers

[09:47] And it's not easy, right?

[09:49] It's not easy, but you all do it because you want to get Pimball out

[09:53] You want to get more people into the hobby

[09:56] And it's always great going to these shows

[09:59] And I love when I talk to people and I say are you on Pinside and they say no, what is that?

[10:05] And I love that because they're just there

[10:07] These are new people that are getting introduced to the hobby, introduced to Pimball collecting

[10:12] And if we're in for these shows, I think there, again, there wouldn't be the kind of resurgence we're seeing now in the hobby

[10:20] So thank you to all you show organizers out there

[10:23] I want to say thanks to all the operators, the guys who put their pins on location

[10:27] Crazy guys like Al that puts a Batman super elite on location for anyone to go play

[10:32] People like Peter at Sunshine

[10:34] And there's so many operators out there, you know who you are

[10:37] The people who put Pimball on location

[10:40] Where Pimball was meant to be

[10:42] The one place where you can't really complain about Deep Code

[10:45] Because you can't even hear the call outs

[10:47] That's how Pimball was supposed to be

[10:49] Just noises and blinking lights and scoring

[10:52] Not these Deep Code games

[10:54] But thank you to all of you guys

[10:56] And thank you to all the distributors out there

[10:58] I mean, if you're worried for Pimball distributors, think about it

[11:01] I mean all these people, it's like this daisy chain of roles and services

[11:05] That all these people that we should be thankful for that make this hobby

[11:09] So well oiled in 2017

[11:12] There's so many great distributors out there

[11:14] Guys like JJ Game Exchange, Chris and Melissa Cointaker

[11:17] I mean, these are people that they're not just distributors, they're friends

[11:21] They're people I talk to all the time

[11:24] They are also some of the time people who give us early information on stuff

[11:29] Before we're supposed to know about it

[11:31] So they help us direct our money

[11:33] Guys like Joe Newhart at Pimball Star

[11:36] They don't just sell games, they bring games to children's hospitals

[11:40] Really, really good guys

[11:42] There's a great network of distributors in this hobby

[11:44] And I think many of you out there have forged great relationships with your distributor friends

[11:50] And it's great to see that

[11:52] And I want to thank all of them out there

[11:54] I want to thank all the modders in this community

[11:57] So those guys who get a machine and look at it

[12:00] And say you know what?

[12:02] Something more could go here

[12:03] Something could be better here

[12:05] Those people to me are amazing because they breathe new life into games

[12:10] They often take games and create play fields and mechanisms and environments and toys

[12:16] They take it to the level that probably it should have been at the very beginning

[12:20] But also you know what? Stern's not going to spend months after months after months

[12:25] You know sculpting things and doing all this they need to get the game out

[12:29] You know when I look at stuff like Batman and Lord the Rings and you know I'm trying all the different awesome mods that are available

[12:36] Games like Jurassic Park you know Star Wars like people have made so many games look better

[12:42] And that's all driven by the passionate individuals out there like the Mezzle mods

[12:47] It's a mezzle, I have to always fuck this up

[12:50] You know they're amazing the mod couple

[12:53] Have you seen this guy's work on a Batman mods in freaking credible

[12:58] You know they're out there back at back alley creations back alley creations

[13:03] There's so many of them out there and this is great guys like Cliffey

[13:06] I consider him like a mod or per se cliffy making all the play field protectors

[13:10] He didn't have to do that kind of wakes up one day and says I'm going to make something that almost everyone would want

[13:16] And I'm going to make it make it affordable and get it to you quickly I ordered something from the guy it came in like two days

[13:21] Amazing amazing

[13:23] You know want to thank first and foremost and lastly that say first and foremost is like the end of my thanks

[13:29] The last people I just want to thank and this is just me it's just I want to I want to thank my parents for like educating me and

[13:37] Making me get a good job so I could actually afford these expensive toys. I mean at the end of the day

[13:42] These things are ridiculously expensive. All right well that's our that culminates our thanks in the hobby

[13:47] I hope I didn't leave any of the thing out. I hope you guys are all thankful for the fact that we have

[13:53] Pimball in 2017 now let's get on to the news of the week so first let's talk about spooky

[13:58] Pimball and total nuclear annihilation I was joking when I was sort of saying it's the best game of all time

[14:04] Because that's how Pinside has it ranked currently

[14:07] But I want to say this and I think for those of you out there

[14:12] Who have you know a lot of people talk to me they want to get me to say something bad about total nuclear annihilation and you know I played it it's fun it's fast

[14:20] I don't really have anything bad to say about it. I think like some people out there maybe I'm like well what's the long term replay value of it

[14:28] But again like that's the only question I would have about owning a total nuclear annihilation but here's the thing

[14:34] I don't think I've ever seen a game come out

[14:38] Where people who own it are so happy

[14:42] Okay, they're so happy they have it. They're so happy for Scott. They're so happy spooky got the game made

[14:48] They're so happy the game is now ranked number one on Pinside

[14:52] They're just really really happy. It's a game that puts a smile on people's faces. It's a game where owning it

[15:00] Owning one is as fun as playing one and the process of buying one was probably the most enjoyable for everyone out there

[15:11] And I think the reason why is the connection everyone feels to Scott to the spooky family the fact that Scott talks to everyone

[15:21] You know he's on Pinside he's one of us. He's at the shows. He made a game in his basement. It's now a real thing

[15:29] He's not trying to fleece the market. He's not releasing collectors editions of it. He's you know they're not stalling

[15:37] They didn't take pre-order dollars. They did it all properly

[15:41] And right now spooky is on they're deep in the batch number two

[15:45] And I just want to say that you guys have done it right. The goodwill is great

[15:50] And the photos of all the total nuclear annihilations at the spooky factory being built those are the kinds of photos I love love

[15:59] Love to see and the other thing that I love to see and I'm seeing more and more and more of this on Pinside

[16:05] Is instead of like all the complaining threads and negative threads they're getting buried right someone had a bump the Kevin Kool-Aid

[16:12] Kevin Kool-Aid thread back up because nobody wants to talk about it anymore

[16:16] Where I think we're all ready to just bury the shitty past the guys like J-pop Kevin

[16:22] You know just get rid of all the negativity and the threads that I'm starting to see more and more of are the club threads

[16:29] We're owners of games are talking about their enjoyment of the game

[16:34] They're talking about strategy on how to play and they're talking about mods and stuff like that

[16:40] Like I love that some guy is about to go do a run of target decal stickers for total nuclear annihilation

[16:48] That is what I love to see that is what got me into this hobby

[16:52] That is what I loved at the beginning of this hobby

[16:55] Before I went down too many dark and negative roads and made too many of my own missteps

[17:00] I loved having the Lord of the Rings and going into the thread and finding out where the mods were and buying them

[17:07] And having everyone talk about the game and all the fun stuff that was made for it

[17:11] That's Pimball and that's what Pimball should be

[17:15] A community of people that help each other out and enhance the experience of owning a machine

[17:20] So congratulations guys I think it's awesome I really do

[17:24] You know the game is fast phone and it's an adrenaline rush

[17:27] It's not like everything else in people's collection and I think for that reason people are loving it

[17:31] People are loving it

[17:33] Alright let's go on to Stern right now because this one is going to be a little bit of like a head scratch

[17:38] I talked a little bit about this with my last podcast when we talked to Christopher Franchi

[17:43] Who by the way? I'm thankful for Christopher Franchi

[17:47] He's amazing, he's honest, he's direct, I love it

[17:50] I love what he's like so truthful about how he felt on a day when his game was supposed to come out and it didn't

[17:55] And he's like bummed out like he's real

[17:58] So I talked to some other people over at Stern and I'll say this

[18:02] I get more of the PR marketing spin with Franchi you get it direct

[18:07] And I'll tell you this this is why I work in PR and I hate PR

[18:10] I'll tell you why I hate PR and I hate PR spin

[18:13] Because it's not real when you tell me what you're supposed to say

[18:18] Because you work for a company that always comes across as false and disingenuous

[18:23] But when you just tell me man it's sucked that like I couldn't show my game at Expo

[18:27] And I was there with my daughter like that's that makes me love him more

[18:31] It makes me love his products more it makes me love his pinball machines more

[18:35] Because I know it's coming from a man who's real and a man who's passionate

[18:39] And I think Stern should let more of those guys talk freely and I think they'd be great

[18:43] Like when I talk to George Gomez you know he was very honest and candid about things

[18:46] If anyone says like if sends me an email about him saying two weeks I swear to God

[18:50] I swear to God I'm gonna ban you now

[18:52] Alright so but here's the deal I wanted to talk a little bit more about the Guardians of the Galaxy stream that we saw

[19:01] And the dead flip stream that we saw because when we saw it there was literally I think probably the most sparring code

[19:09] That had ever been on a machine that's turned it ever shown in one of these types of twitch streams

[19:15] Right there was no callouts

[19:17] Not only that so we have this really early game there's no callouts

[19:22] And then they're also on the same day those games are shipping to customers

[19:27] And we've beat this dead horse a million times around when you buy a new Stern

[19:34] There's a really good chance that the code is not gonna be that far along

[19:37] But it's usually further along than this

[19:41] And you know Batman 66 goes down in history as being one of the most laughably early codes to ever launch

[19:48] But Guardians doesn't seem like it's that much further along

[19:52] And so I'm really you know I'm really surprised and I think all of you are

[19:58] At how empty and barren that experience was

[20:03] A pinball machine without callouts doesn't work

[20:07] It doesn't work it becomes a silent movie

[20:10] The callouts are so important in terms of articulating and communicating to the player what to do

[20:18] Because you could have a whole game think about it you could have a whole game where you simply had callouts telling you where to shoot

[20:26] You don't even need inserts if it's like hey are you ready shoot the ramp

[20:31] Now we have inserts because games are in our Cades and Loud and Environment

[20:35] And these lights to also tell you what to shoot because if you relied only on audio it wouldn't work in an arcade

[20:42] But for a homey's only environment you could get away with only audio dictation of what to do in a game pretty easily

[20:49] So I'm shocked I'm shocked that they shipped the game but here's the thing the more shocking part is not that Stern

[20:56] I'm shocked that this machine with hardly anything in it in terms of code it's the fact that people bought it

[21:01] And people have it in their home and people knew that before they bought it

[21:06] There's going to be a code update quickly the callouts are going to be put into the game

[21:12] There will be callouts there will be audio from the films there will I hope so I hope so because it was really creepy watching all those scenes with

[21:24] They were like looking at each other like they were all constipated like this was like to me I'm like it's like Guardians of Galaxy characters wanting to take a crap

[21:34] And it's like them all just making facial expressions and then right when they're about to say something they run off in some action sequence

[21:41] Right another thing that was curious when I watched the game you know the game does shoot like Metallica looks like it's fun it's very colorful

[21:49] The shot layout is you know we know is good I'm curious about the LCD integration though and this is something I've been talking to a lot of friends about that

[21:58] LCDs are not are they are they helping or hurting Pimble and we'll probably have this as a later discussion

[22:05] I want to interview some people and talk about this but when I watched the stream I couldn't help but think are you playing the game or are you watching this sequence

[22:15] And I think there's like too much going on on the LCD screen in terms of the duration of the video clips

[22:23] Right if you're gonna do use video from a movie it should be short little bursts sort of imagine if a DMD those scenes were what you grabbed from the actual film

[22:34] I mean very short burst of what's going on when you when you have like 10 seconds in a row or 15 seconds in a row of a sequence

[22:42] I don't understand who's watching that like the players not watching it the I guess the spectators are watching it

[22:51] But it just seems like more and more that's being relied upon to tell the story of the modes and the progression of the modes

[23:00] And I think it's a shame I think more of those things used to be physical elements on the playfield themselves

[23:06] But it's it's shipping gardens the galaxy is out that you can go get it it is incredible

[23:14] I am thankful that's turned imagine Stern reveals a machine and a few weeks later it can be in your home

[23:19] And people have said this on the forum they get down voted

[23:22] But I'd rather have a machine with hardly any code in it that I own

[23:26] Versus a machine that I paid for that I'll never get

[23:29] And that's you know it's hard to argue with some of those people because they know the codes going to come eventually

[23:36] It just depends how long and how much patience you do have

[23:39] Speaking of code the the Batman 66 game the Batman 66 code 0.83 was released yesterday ahead of schedule

[23:50] There were rumors that Stern was going to release it before Thanksgiving it is now out

[23:54] The consensus is it's starting to include some of the minor villains I think Mr. Freeze in egghead

[24:02] Really cool that you know people are starting to people are starting to realize like holy shit

[24:08] Like Lyman starting to do it and if all those minor villains get coded the depth of the game the fun of the game is really starting to win people over

[24:17] It's taken a really really long time people have been suffering with this title

[24:22] Like nobody got burned more than the guys who went in on the Ellie's and the SLE's and just the games have been sitting

[24:28] In Lyman they do trust and in Lyman they do have lots of patience

[24:33] The game is really shaping up I mean when I there's some screen grabs if you go on Pinside and Authair Kate Forum

[24:39] Of what it looks like when you engage the minor villains I'm Mr. Freeze the modes are really cool

[24:45] I believe you have to like you turn the inserts from red to blue or blue to red maybe from red to blue they freeze and you have to unfreeze them and maybe it's blue to red

[24:56] But then there's also like these mini TVs up on the screen that show how you're progressing

[25:01] It's on the else it's like the LCD screen and then it has like many TVs that pop up that I believe are indicating your mini villain modes or your modes that are stacked

[25:11] I'm not quite sure sorry I wish I had a game to show you what I'm talking about

[25:17] But it's coming along it's coming along and so here's a comment that George Gomez made that's got everybody super excited

[25:25] People are starting to say you know thank you the games great I'm really enjoying it and George Gomez said you ain't seen nothing yet

[25:33] Nothing yet

[25:35] Wow do you believe it two weeks two weeks no I mean look of course he's gonna hype his product but we also know that if there's anyone that delivers on the hype of a game it's lime and sheets

[25:47] So really interesting to see how Batman starts to sort of are people gonna start buying it more are is there gonna be a run on the game if the code starts to get there or is it too late has it been out for too long do people not care they moved on

[26:01] We'll see speaking of other stern options AC DC vault edition nothing really newsworthy here other than the fact that a lot of people I'm hearing from say the game shoots exactly the same as the originals

[26:14] It's a great game the improvement to the to the lower playfield screen was is is a much needed improvement and it really brings into question what these older AC DCs are gonna be worth because I still see the guys with the back in black

[26:29] Trying to go for 12,500 dollars now the problem is this the problem really becomes is it worth five thousand dollars more than a brand new game for just the stickers and the trim and you could argue maybe the limited nature of it

[26:49] I'm starting to see AC DC Lucy's which used to be really sought after remember when Lucy's were going for like nine to ten grand like easily because they were the rare versions because they didn't make many now they're coming back down to earth and the eight thousand dollar range and more people is he thing is this is like more people will start to sell as they realize it's not worth what they they thought it would be worth and also because they want to get new games I mean it's just it's just the way it goes like people are gonna want the new stuff I still think the stern LC

[27:18] DC games are gonna make the DMD games look really old and really dated in a lineup as people start the stack that new Sterns in a row they're gonna want to free up and get new games and sell old games okay

[27:32] All right, PPS so here's a question I have and I thought for sure we were gonna see monster bash at Texas pinball festival and that was gonna be the next title from Chicago gaming and PPS

[27:43] but someone has been coming on the pinside and saying my source is my internal sources have told me that it is 100% gonna be cactus canyon and so I don't know I don't know I don't know which one it's gonna be I think it's safe to say that they're gonna make both of these games

[28:01] I also heard that when I heard this is the rumor I heard it when they make cactus canyon it is gonna be with improved software

[28:08] so maybe the cactus canyon continued software will be in it or maybe some new version of the game will be in it

[28:15] but I'll say this when these guys remake these games good by good night to your $12,000 version of cactus canyon

[28:26] it's never gonna happen again these guys are gonna they're smart they're smart I don't love remakes I don't like remakes I wish games

[28:35] would have a time in a place and I wish values would remain intact because no new ones could be made and that's what I wish

[28:44] that as a collector I think we all wish that I think there are enough you know not like there's enough of them out there

[28:51] but it's not fun when you remove grail games from a collectible hobby like if someone were to be able to reproduce

[28:59] in the arcade world the game that like a super rare major havoc it comes in this unique cabinet

[29:04] and the PCB boards alone sell for sometimes like a thousand dollars two thousand dollars

[29:09] someone is trying to recreate the PC board they've already recreated the cabinet on it

[29:15] so if you go and recreate everything and then you can make hundreds of major haveics major havoc

[29:22] because the game sucks no longer becomes a collectible because people weren't collecting it because of the

[29:27] gameplay they were collecting it because of its rarity in the marketplace but they're gonna do what

[29:34] they're gonna do and you know they've made attack from Mars they made it they made it just as good if

[29:38] not better the toppers awesome the package is awesome it's a beautiful game I think anyone who's

[29:43] got an attack from Mars remake is super happy game looks great the green looks great on it everything

[29:49] about it I really can't find a thing to complain about on that machine I think it's so here's the

[29:57] other side and I know that as a collector yes but I got to say this my tales of the Arabian knights

[30:03] which looked brand new which looked really good in all the photos that the seller gave me and I

[30:08] got to call this guy out I got to find his name he's from Canada he you know he gave photos that

[30:14] made it look like the game was in really nice condition let me tell you something the game was a

[30:18] total hack job I'm surprised it didn't burn down my apartment Eddie Kramer is restoring it and you

[30:24] should if you're friends with me on Facebook become friends with me on Facebook Chris Kloris that's

[30:29] K double O L U R I S send me a friend request on Facebook so you can see Eddie's restore pictures of

[30:37] my totem and the freaking hack job that was there I mean there were wrong coils there were wires

[30:43] touching diodes there was stuff everywhere there were like cut wires there it was a total hack job

[30:48] I'm surprised the game even worked like I'm surprised it was ever able to play it um and Eddie's

[30:53] bringing it back to better than new he's polishing the metal everything but here's the thing when

[30:59] you buy these old games and all you have sometimes are photos it's so easy to get scammed and when I

[31:06] do like about the remakes is now people can go buy these amazing titles and they don't have to worry

[31:12] about being taken advantage of and there's just too many stories of people taking advantage

[31:17] and selling pins that are not in the condition as described there's no better description of

[31:23] of of a game than it's new in box okay all right let's keep going because I want to tell you guys

[31:30] what keep with pin I'm getting I'm really excited I'm really excited to share the news um

[31:34] couple more things highway pinball the tally right now is that a little over 37

[31:42] thousand dollars is what they owe and refund money and I just you know when you think about it

[31:49] if each machine is like eight thousand dollars roughly thirty seven thousand dollars right

[31:57] like what is that like how many machines is that it's like four and a half machines right it's not

[32:05] that much money and I don't know why they can't afford to refund this money I really don't and every

[32:13] see the problem is if if they don't refund it it makes people even more nervous which makes more

[32:19] people ask for refunds right it's it's a snowball effect and the other problem they're probably

[32:26] facing is let's say thirty seven thousand dollars it's not just four machines right because that could

[32:32] be let's say that's twenty people with fifteen hundred dollar deposits that want it back that's

[32:39] twenty machines times you know eight thousand so that's a hundred you know that's a hundred and sixty

[32:44] thousand dollars um that's now lost in revenue so if if they don't go in on the machine so it's

[32:52] I get it but they've got to refund people's money and I was shocked when I saw this though

[32:57] they have not communicated or paid one person who really needs to be paid and deserves to be paid

[33:05] and that's oric loss in oric did the artwork for the game and oric spent a lot of hours making

[33:12] the artwork for the game now I know we've spent a lot of time on this podcast critiquing the

[33:17] artwork and oric and I had our very public feud for a little bit but that's dead and gone it is

[33:23] so dead and gone it is so water under the bridge the hatchet is beyond buried and I actually like

[33:29] the new oric and I say the new oric because I think both of us came out of that shit show better

[33:34] people and more calm and collected but I like I like him chiming in I like the support he gives

[33:40] to Scott Denise see we have mutual friends I mean I I've forgiven the dude I've invited the dude

[33:46] on my show like I would love to have a work come on the show and we just like bury the hatchet in

[33:51] front of all the view and talk pinball um but he has not received his alien pinball machine and

[33:57] that was the deal Andrew highway made with him it's a very public deal he's been very outspoken

[34:04] about his inability to get the his game and to you know to get any communication from the new

[34:10] highway people and see here's the problem here's the difference between highway pinball and spooky

[34:16] pinball is think about how nice chuck and family are and Scott and all the people over there you

[34:23] know how they how helpful they are you know think about how nice like Jack and Jenner and LTGR in

[34:29] terms of communicating these guys won't even respond to the dude who made the artwork for the

[34:36] game how do you think they're gonna treat you if that's how they treat the person who did the

[34:41] art on the game and that's human nature if they treat him like that just imagine how they're

[34:47] gonna treat you all right he needs to get his game that's can you just pinball podcast saying

[34:53] you guys should ask for refunds until everyone should get a refund until or gets his game you

[34:59] guys should all do that if you have a friend who has an alien everyone collectively say we all

[35:03] want our money back until you give orick loss in his pinball machine because he deserves it

[35:08] enough of this behavior it can't continue they can't keep getting a pass they need to make that

[35:16] wrong right it it must drive or crazy that all of these people out there are are new new to highway

[35:24] pinball are opening up their alien machines before he even gets his that that's such BS you make

[35:30] his Ellie first and you get it to him yesterday yesterday um speaking of ridiculous things did

[35:39] you guys go on eBay and search for pinball and and look at what the most expensive machine is right

[35:45] now it is a big Lebowski machine for sale for thirty thousand dollars thirty thousand dollars for

[35:55] a big Lebowski which was originally originally eight thousand five hundred dollars that's incredible

[36:03] that would be like me selling magic girl uh if you take sixteen thousand dollars was the MSRP it

[36:09] would be like me selling magical for fifty thousand dollars um it's by orange county pinballs they

[36:16] should be ashamed of themselves there is no way they should be listing the game for that price but

[36:22] here's a deal it's a free country they can list the game for whatever they want it doesn't mean

[36:25] anyone's gonna buy it they'll probably get offers I offered them I think eight thousand five

[36:30] hundred dollars which was the sticker price and it was rejected it didn't even it didn't even go

[36:35] through they've got some like auto rejection they've got a minimum offer that they'll accept

[36:40] all right so drum roll I want to tell you my new game now before before I do this I want to tell

[36:49] you why I why I came to this conclusion and and sort of like why this has sort of changed my

[36:55] outlook on pinball and and and and what not before I even do that I want to tell you this game is paid

[37:01] for okay this isn't one of my like I found the game I want to get games paid for games paid for

[37:09] all right okay so here's what happened to me about a year ago last February I bought a game

[37:17] called magic girl and magic girl was a dream theme of mine and I was super excited that legendary

[37:24] pinball designer John Papaduke was finally gonna get his magic girl out the door and my good friend

[37:30] Kim Mitchell was you know he was tired of waiting and he sold me the game at a price we both thought

[37:35] was fair and I I still do think it was fair and I I love Kim Mitchell I think he's a great guy

[37:42] and you know we went back and forth and whether or not the game would actually ship and it was

[37:46] there was some nerve-wracking months where I bonded with people like Chris from coin taker and

[37:51] Bill Brandis and and other individuals that were in on this debacle and I and I became it you know

[37:57] at the middle of it you guys know this story I'm not gonna go down a magic girl story for very long

[38:01] but I'll say this for almost a year I own a magical I've owned a pinball machine that doesn't work

[38:06] I've owned a pinball machine that is beautiful that had such potential but John spent five years

[38:12] and couldn't even get a single mechanism to function properly it's an amazing machine it's an

[38:17] amazing machine I you know it's it is for a pinball collector it is for someone who has probably

[38:23] many pinball machines in their collection it will always be a part of pinball history it'll always

[38:29] be worth a lot of money as I look at it right now it's a gorgeous thing but I also want to put a

[38:33] pinball machine in here that I can enjoy that I can play that I can step up to and have an objective

[38:40] right and so that's what I've been looking for for a while and you know nothing ever really

[38:45] jumped out at me I flipped some games I flipped the Batman 66 I flipped a Ghostbusters LE and you know

[38:52] for a lot of the game that I really want it was Star Wars and and I get that people are having

[38:57] fun with Star Wars but Star Wars doesn't speak to me I've played Star Wars many times I don't like

[39:02] that complexity of the code and I just don't get excited when I look down at that game I don't

[39:08] there's something about it it doesn't pull me in I wanted to dialed in I think dialed in is great

[39:14] I think it is a tremendous machine the only thing missing for me and pulling the trigger would dial

[39:20] in was there was just something missing in like the callouts or the music I just didn't get emotionally

[39:28] pulled into that world it's probably the great like one of the greatest flipping pinball machines

[39:33] of all time in terms of pinball right in terms of geometry in terms of shots in terms of toys in

[39:39] terms of like Jack puts so much into that game patlaw they're put so much into that game and it's a

[39:44] terrific game and I speak to people all the time that own it and love it and if you love pinball you

[39:49] can't go wrong with the dialed in but it just wasn't for me right just wasn't for me um and so

[39:55] that you know that leaves like so many options right like what did you pick Chris what did you pick

[39:59] Chris well here's what I've been doing recently I've been going out to play a lot more pinball

[40:04] I've been going out to pioneer bar I've been going out to sunshine and I've been playing stuff from

[40:11] all different ages all different games and and I've always said this the game that I want to own

[40:18] has great theme integration the game that I want to own um brings brings the world of that theme to

[40:25] life under glass as you know as best as possible um the game that I want to own is just you know it's

[40:32] fun is fun I understand how to play it I understand what to do the game that I want to own when

[40:38] people come over they'll recognize it they'll get excited by it the game that I want to own has

[40:43] great art package has great sound has great callouts the game that I want to own really is a game

[40:52] that I think is going to have a like a lot of depth it'll have you know it won't be boring

[40:58] a six months from now because of all there will be to do in the game and I'm not a very good pinball

[41:02] player so that means even a game with mediocre depth would probably last a really long time in my

[41:07] collection so after looking at everything and after playing stuff for months and after seeing like

[41:14] what's out there and after seeing how people are responding to games I have bought and paid for

[41:22] again that I think it's going to shock a lot of you because I've been pretty critical at times

[41:27] I will be the owner in just a few weeks I got to find you know it's paid for I got to find

[41:32] the one the exact one I want um of a Batman 66 holy holy donut and I could just hear like probably

[41:39] some of you out there being like no canada you ragged on Batman 66 you did this you did that yes yes

[41:47] all of what you're going to say is true but I went and I've played Batman 66 on the new code

[41:54] on point eight one for a very long time I played it next to dialed in I played it next to game of

[42:00] thrones uh you know I've been playing a lot of pioneer bar and I have to say I have to say

[42:06] I loved it I loved playing pinball again magic girl turned me into a bitter angry mean man and I

[42:15] walked up to Batman and the lights are going and the music and the theme song and franches

[42:21] art is popping out at me and I don't know it was like Adam West call out it's in all the clips from

[42:29] the the film and everything you know not the film the TV show and everything was like happening

[42:33] and it's all starting to come together with that game and I'm like I would love to own this game

[42:39] like I grew up with Batman 66 I used to watch Batman 66 reruns all the time when I was

[42:45] a kid remember when Batman was fun and not the like psychoanalytical dark crap it is these days

[42:53] um you know I just fell in love with Batman 66 and the first thought that popped into my head was

[43:02] shit I sold one I had one and I let it go but here's the thing I don't think I would have liked

[43:08] owning Batman 66 in the past year all the pain and suffering people went through but now is the time

[43:15] now is the time because at point eight one which is now point eight three the game has woken up

[43:22] and the game is really good right now and I fully believe that Lyman is going to make the game

[43:28] amazing and I know I know I can hear the critics yes like I've been critical of the world

[43:34] under glass of the turntable mech that they didn't bring everything that they could have yes yes

[43:38] all of that is true but there's enough of the world under glass there for me but here's the thing

[43:44] the integration we are now I'm realizing now that all these new machines are struggling to get the

[43:51] kinds of rights to the actors to the callouts to the music to make the games feel like those properties

[43:59] right and Batman 66 like has it all it has all the actors it has their callouts it has like

[44:06] you know Adam West and you know made callouts for the game for the game itself like we're not

[44:12] getting any of that level of integration anywhere else anymore they mean prior to the Caribbean

[44:17] it doesn't even have the theme song it doesn't have any callouts from from the from the films

[44:22] themselves I mean this is the complete opposite of that so to me to me this is sort of like Adam West's

[44:29] last project it's sort of like a Batman 66 time capsule this will be one of the I think it will

[44:38] go down is one of the greatest theme in a great it pins of all time and I think all these new games

[44:44] like guardians and pirates they're really gonna struggle to have this level of integration and it's

[44:50] also just a theme that speaks to the child and me the nostalgia the emotional appeal to Batman is

[44:55] ridiculous and I say this because when I went from Batman back and forth with dialed in dialed in

[45:00] shoots much better dialed in's got much better toys dialed in's got much better like layout

[45:06] everything is better about dialed in on a pinball level but when the Batman theme song kicks in

[45:12] and Adam West is asking me to like go after the Joker pick up the red phone the bad phone

[45:19] I'm six years old again I'm having a blast I have a smile ear to ear and I just can't get that

[45:27] if you're asking me to save quantum city so I'm I'm I'm so excited to get a Batman 66 the other part

[45:34] that I love about getting a Batman 66 now is the mod community is unbelievable for this game

[45:40] this stuff that has been made for Batman 66 you can make your pinball machine I think look like the

[45:45] best damn stern machine of all time I mean this stuff that's out there the let me call out the

[45:52] atomic pile mod by the mod couple look at that thing look at the look at the detail on it it's

[45:57] amazing um what you got like you can do everything from like new armor you can do everything from

[46:05] like new bat mobiles and you can the eagle moss toys are great like the the fact that you can shop

[46:11] around so many fun mods and dress up the game you know I love doing that I had my lortherings

[46:15] dressed up to the nines and Batman 66 is one of those worlds where like you can put all that stuff

[46:21] in it you know you can go buy like the little van that is the parachute the bat parachute like

[46:26] pickup van you can buy new spotlights you can buy the like toppers you can buy like the bat

[46:31] signal to be shown on your ceiling that to me it's just like this it's it's it's got me so excited

[46:38] um and ultimately ultimately as I said before stern has made a hypocrite of me they've made a

[46:45] hypocrite of me because as much as stern has cut corners and much as stern has done this and this

[46:50] they still I think make the most fun pinball machines and it makes me it always puts me in a dilemma

[46:59] because they make games that are the most fun because they have the best themes it's just there's

[47:07] you can't you just can't win when your themes aren't as good you can't you could win on a pinball

[47:14] level but you'll never get me to move towards the light like if all the sudden you know I'm

[47:20] in a meeting and people are babbling on about stuff and someone just walks into that room with

[47:24] a boom box and has an idea and says Chris listen to this and he plays like you got the touch from

[47:31] Transformers G1 the movie I would like I would be more excited in that moment of my professional

[47:37] career than I would be after sitting through thousands of PowerPoint page documents like I do

[47:42] in a daily basis of like mediocre ideas right because it would bring me back to the movie to the

[47:49] being a child again and that's what pinball is supposed to do is make us feel feel like we're

[47:54] having fun like we did when we were young right when you become an adult the news is never good like

[48:01] there's a lot of hardships and shit that these games become an escapism and Batman 66 is such an

[48:08] escapism I'm super excited and the last point I'll make is this the Batman 66 club thread on

[48:15] pinside is the coolest freaking thread going right now on that site I've never seen a community of

[48:21] people that have been through the pain and they're coming out on the end of that painful journey

[48:27] justified and validated because the pin is freaking awesome it is freaking awesome now and I know

[48:34] it's hard to like man it's like what am I a copa I'm doing on this game but I'm all in I'm excited

[48:41] I can't wait to get it I can't wait to be in that club and it sucks that I'm banned maybe Robin

[48:47] and moderators can let me log in and just join that thread how about that Robin is that like it

[48:54] fair compromise a canada we can call it canada 66 or maybe canada 76 is the year I was born I you

[49:01] can let me back on the pinside to simply join the Batman club thread because as people will tell you

[49:08] I've been hunting for mods for the last couple weeks and I have to like ask my friends to ask

[49:13] people to ask this you know how many times people tell me oh if you want to buy my mod just hit

[49:17] me up on pinside I'm like oh about that I can't um banned um but I want to just say Batman 66

[49:27] is the title that I'm super excited to get I'm so thankful I'll have it in a couple weeks I got

[49:32] to figure out like what trimming everything and all that jazz um but I I can't wait I can't wait

[49:39] I can't wait to show you guys uh how I'm going to turn my machine on I'll share it on Facebook

[49:44] right now I have made the coolest mod I have made it so that you will turn on my machine when you

[49:50] lift up the Shakespeare statue you lift up his head I mod at the bank I'm going to share a photo

[49:54] I'm on on on my Facebook page right now that says here's how my Batman will be turned on but that's

[50:03] that's the game I might lose half of you as listeners because you're like you're the biggest

[50:07] hypocrite I can't believe you um but you know what after a year of broken magic girl I'm going in on

[50:14] a pin that's fun I'm going in on a pin that people are loving I'm going in on a pin that I love

[50:21] I'm going in on a pin that Lyman's gonna make great and even though yes I get it it's clunky my

[50:26] Lord the Rings was clunky some of George Gomez's designs have some clunkiness to it but you know it's

[50:30] part of the charm at times part of the charm is figuring out how to get the damn upper left ramp

[50:35] to stop rattling around and you guys did you figured it out um have a happy Thanksgiving everyone

[50:43] all of you out there to your health and your happiness remember this is just pinball I'm here to

[50:49] give you weekly entertainment in this hobby I'm glad you listen I really am very very thankful I

[50:55] can't tell you how thankful I am that I have this audience that actually tunes into this show I

[51:00] it it's humbling it's great I can't wait I can't wait to go to shows and hang out through

[51:05] dues and play pinball through dues and I think having a working game that I'm excited about

[51:10] is going to make this show even more positive and even better so I have a great Thanksgiving and we'll

[51:14] talk to you real soon
