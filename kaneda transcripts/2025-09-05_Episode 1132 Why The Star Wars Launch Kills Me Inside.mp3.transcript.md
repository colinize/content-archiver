[00:00] Also, you're gonna be seeing the real deal here very soon.

[00:05] Real deal here any minute.

[00:06] Any minute.

[00:07] Yeah.

[00:08] I think just waiting for approvals on all the marketing stuff.

[00:15] Everything we write, everything we show has gotta get blessed.

[00:19] And so, I think that's all the people are waiting for.

[00:23] So, you're gonna see it soon.

[00:24] I had a grand idea of showing off all these toys and mechs and stuff from the game.

[00:29] And as I was thinking about it more, I'm just gonna let you guys experience it when

[00:32] that thing drops because it's a total package.

[00:35] Yeah, it's pretty cool.

[00:36] You guys are gonna like it.

[00:37] And Spike 3.

[00:38] Spike 3.

[00:39] And Streamers.

[00:40] Freaking anybody actually.

[00:41] All you need is an HDMI out.

[00:42] And honestly, it's just the beginning of Spike 3.

[00:44] Oh, heck yeah.

[00:45] It's actually a Surface.

[00:46] Are we coming out with an Expo Z or something about that to explain what Spike 3 is doing?

[00:51] We are gonna spend a bunch of time talking about all the features in Spike 3.

[00:55] Beyond the features in the game.

[00:57] We're gonna outline like here's all the cool stuff you get.

[01:00] There's a lot of it.

[01:01] Heck yeah.

[01:02] And for you folks that have invested in things like our headphone jack and stuff, those items

[01:08] still do work on Spike 3.

[01:09] I am in fact using it now, but I wired it wrong so it was causing a weird delay there.

[01:14] Yeah, but you can get, you know, you'll get lots and lots of, I mean, it's what you'd

[01:19] imagine, right?

[01:20] It's a new hardware set in 2025.

[01:22] It's what you'd...

[01:23] It's beautiful.

[01:24] Love it.

[01:25] All right, Internet.

[01:26] We're coming with us.

[01:27] Let me click this button here so I can get a full size view.

[01:32] We'll see you.

[01:33] See you soon.

[01:34] I almost gave it away.

[01:35] We'll see you soon.

[01:36] Have a good one.

[01:37] All right, see you soon.

[01:53] Everybody knows when the Stern pinball Star Wars launch continues to be a mystery to everybody.

[02:01] It is Friday, September 5th.

[02:04] The damn dealers and distros have no idea when they're gonna see this game, when it's

[02:12] gonna be discussed with them.

[02:14] Usually by now there's an email to them explaining to them the details of the new and next Stern

[02:21] machine.

[02:23] And when you hear George Gomez and Jack Danger, we almost gave it away.

[02:27] I mean, freaking media are coming over next Wednesday.

[02:32] We know the dealer call is like on a freaking Tuesday, but distros usually get in front

[02:39] of all of that.

[02:41] And if you think about the reason why a distro wants to know, it's very simply this.

[02:48] They want to be able to go to their customers and say, hey, I'm gonna get this new Stern

[02:55] Star Wars game and this is the date I'm gonna have information on it.

[03:01] Nope, they know nothing.

[03:03] There is absolutely zero hype for this game.

[03:08] Watching Gomez and Jack Danger play the Costco game as the lead up to this new Star Wars

[03:15] extravaganza.

[03:17] He's just really not doing it for me.

[03:19] Maybe it is for you.

[03:21] And even when George said something there, it was very subtle, but you had to listen

[03:24] to what he said.

[03:25] He said, Spike three, we're just scratching the surface.

[03:32] What Star Wars, your new platform is not going to showcase all of the power of Spike three.

[03:41] You're just scratching the surface.

[03:44] And when he says it's pretty cool, I don't know people.

[03:49] It's pretty cool.

[03:51] Isn't like OMG.

[03:53] I can't wait to see it.

[03:55] Everyone who's been doubting whether or not Stern pinball is going to do Star Wars justice.

[04:00] We can't wait to see the game.

[04:02] Where is the hyperbole?

[04:05] I can almost see it in their body language.

[04:08] Like they know, nobody knows more than Jack and George that this is not going to be received

[04:17] as the second coming of Godzilla as the next chapter in Stern pinball.

[04:23] Maybe it is.

[04:24] And I've been saying this for like a week now because we have nothing else to chew on.

[04:29] I just hope I'm wrong.

[04:32] Everybody all of you out there, Fizzy, Bond, Dave Frazier, Frank, Eric Mitchell, Kim Mitchell,

[04:39] who's Eric Mitchell, Eric Caden, you know, Ed Robertson, all you guys, Robert Mooney,

[04:45] Rodney C, all you guys, Scott, all you guys out there.

[04:50] You all want Star Wars to be great.

[04:53] Even Bond wants it to be great.

[04:55] We don't want these things to be bad.

[04:57] If we're in this hobby rooting for these companies to fail, then you're really on the wrong road

[05:04] right now.

[05:05] I want games to be great.

[05:08] I want themes that are awesome, execute it right.

[05:12] And so yeah, Friday, September 5th, are we going to get anything today?

[05:17] I mean, seriously, if Star Wars, and we know it's next week, if Stern pinball gives us

[05:22] nothing to chew on on this Friday, so we're all huddled around our hype this weekend,

[05:30] what are they doing?

[05:31] Even when George says we're waiting on license or approval for the assets for what?

[05:37] You're at a, like, what, all that should be confirmed before you even started to tease

[05:42] this thing.

[05:44] You should work back from all that.

[05:46] All that should be approved.

[05:47] What do you mean?

[05:48] Like they're working right up until the day the game comes out on submitting stuff.

[05:52] That makes me feel like everything is rushed.

[05:56] Everything is, like, not really figured out.

[05:58] Like you don't have a plan.

[06:00] The game should be done.

[06:02] It should be done for this much money.

[06:04] How many of you out there?

[06:05] Why do we keep buying these products that aren't complete, the marketing is half-assed, and

[06:12] like the companies are like just making it up as they go around Star Wars?

[06:18] You think with the new CMO over at Stern, this would have been a different one.

[06:22] That launch, they would have done something different.

[06:26] They would have surprised us in a unique way.

[06:29] Like I was just thinking about it.

[06:30] How awesome would it have been if they just dropped a gameplay trailer at like two in

[06:37] the morning yesterday?

[06:39] Just drop it at two in the morning.

[06:41] You know what that would have done?

[06:43] People in Europe who can't get the game, it would have been extra salt on those wounds.

[06:47] But what would have happened is everybody in the pinballed universe that is waiting

[06:53] to see this game, their phones would have been blowing up.

[06:58] And you actually could have done a teaser where you make fun of that.

[07:03] Like we just, with the Death Star, blew up all of your sleep.

[07:06] We feel a great disturbance in the Force late at night.

[07:10] And they could have done something unique, something different.

[07:14] Instead, it's going to be the same old thing.

[07:19] It's going to be here, we're going to do a call and have a webinar.

[07:23] And then everyone's going to take photos of the game with their cell phone.

[07:27] And that's the first way we're going to see the game.

[07:30] You know what's going to happen?

[07:31] You know the first thing we're going to get is crappy cell phone photos of the game.

[07:38] Then people are going to complain about the art because they're seeing it in the wrong

[07:42] way.

[07:43] And then Zambietti is going to tell us that the saturation levels aren't right because

[07:49] of what people are sharing.

[07:50] I don't know.

[07:51] It's always the same thing.

[07:53] But what I'm not feeling is I'm not feeling anything from John Ford.

[07:57] Where is he?

[07:58] Where is he?

[07:59] Is he just waiting?

[08:00] Is he on vacation?

[08:02] He's worked so hard on this game.

[08:04] How come he's not out there getting us excited?

[08:07] This is all they got?

[08:08] This is all they got.

[08:10] And I mean it.

[08:11] I think all of us, we just want more.

[08:13] Now in the end, you just want the game to be great.

[08:16] I mean I feel the same way.

[08:17] Like if the game's a banger and the game's amazing and the game has all this incredible

[08:22] stuff and Spike 3's bringing a whole new sort of like period or chapter and Stern Pimball

[08:27] history that's going to be amazing.

[08:29] You know Spike 3 should make Spike 2 feel a little bit obsolete.

[08:34] I think Stern's nervous about that.

[08:36] What I think Stern's going to do and I just, I feel like they're going to make Spike 3

[08:42] for some of the older machines.

[08:44] So if you want to get the bigger screen and the speakers, they're going to sell that as

[08:48] a kid.

[08:49] I think they're going to do that.

[08:50] Like they know they've got tens of thousands, if not a few hundred thousand games out there

[08:55] that potentially if you want to make them look unison in a lineup, they're going to

[09:00] want to sell you the upgrade.

[09:02] Is it easy to do?

[09:03] I don't know.

[09:04] It doesn't seem too hard.

[09:05] I mean how many of us like built gateway computers when we were kids or you know put

[09:11] stuff and components into like PCs, it's not going to be that hard would it be to like

[09:16] unscrew this and screw that in.

[09:18] I think a lot of it is backwards compatible.

[09:21] And you know I love how they're like oh yeah for streamers out there we, no one gives

[09:24] a SHIT except for a handful of people that your Spike 3 system is going to make it easier

[09:31] to stream because the boringest thing to do in the world in the short time we have on

[09:36] Planet Earth is to watch people stream Pimball.

[09:39] If you're one of those guys like let's just jump on and spend three hours of the short

[09:44] amount of time we have on Planet Earth watching me play this game and explain it to you and

[09:49] ruin all the excitement you're going to feel when you get the game.

[09:52] I don't know.

[09:53] I'm just not one of these people that wants to watch people stream video games or Pimball

[09:58] machines.

[09:59] I don't.

[10:00] Maybe the only thing I like to do is watch professional drivers take a nice car around

[10:06] a track.

[10:07] And people watch that.

[10:08] Like that's exciting because if I try to do that in that car I'm going to kill myself.

[10:14] But I really don't get excited watching like you know bone carons blow up a machine or

[10:19] I eat Pimball take us all the way through Toy Story in 20 minutes.

[10:24] Not my cup of tea ladies and gentlemen.

[10:26] Alright so just a few days out the hype is non-existent.

[10:32] I think the silence is speaking volumes.

[10:35] What else is going on in Pimball on this Friday first and foremost thank you everybody for

[10:40] being a member of the Canadian Club.

[10:42] I got a long email.

[10:43] I unsubscribe from Colin at Kinetis is like basically begging for money is like oh man

[10:49] we're journalists now and to keep this livelihood going I need your help and he was like this

[10:55] long speech and then he's like if we can just get 10 more subscribers.

[11:00] Oh man it's so funny.

[11:02] I wish I could share with all of them how you do it.

[11:06] You actually make good content.

[11:09] You don't have to.

[11:10] Once you start calling yourself good.

[11:11] Nah man.

[11:12] I do it all the time.

[11:13] You love Canada.

[11:14] I love Canada.

[11:15] Who is Canada these days.

[11:17] Hi to Maham the paywall.

[11:19] Want to give a shout out to Kale at Electric Bat.

[11:22] Shout out to Rachel.

[11:23] Shout out to all you mofos who tune in every week for a Canadian Spinball podcast.

[11:28] Now look I know there was a rumor.

[11:30] This is not even a rumor that Canada is trying to be kept from Pinball Expo.

[11:35] It is true.

[11:36] It's true.

[11:37] Like I literally have been going back and forth with Rob Burke.

[11:40] Who by the way I said this to Rob because Rob is a nice guy and he's like Chris I need

[11:46] you to hit up this dude who doesn't want you there and I'm like all right well cool.

[11:51] I emailed him.

[11:52] I texted him.

[11:53] I called him.

[11:54] Nothing like Rob look here's the deal.

[11:56] I'm a 48 year old man who's made 1132 podcasts about Pinball.

[12:02] I think I've earned the right to go to your pinball show.

[12:06] I'm not going to cause any drama.

[12:08] I'm not going to get in a fight with anybody.

[12:11] My days of throwing drinks in faces of people are over.

[12:16] I now consume the drinks.

[12:19] All of them.

[12:20] I don't want to waste any bit of vodka as a daddy with no sleep on someone's face.

[12:25] You know I'm not going to give Tim Sexton you know porcelain face with my vodka.

[12:30] It's going to be consumed by me.

[12:33] When I went to Expo last year it was a lot of fun and what Rob doesn't get is this and

[12:37] this is a point about a lot of these Canadian haters.

[12:40] I always ask them one question.

[12:42] Do you even listen to the show?

[12:47] Have you heard what Canada's Pinball podcast has been doing for the last 12 years and the

[12:54] answer by all of the haters is always no.

[12:58] I don't listen.

[13:00] I just hate him and I hate what he stands for and he's toxic and you're like well how

[13:05] can you call somebody toxic that you don't even listen to.

[13:11] And so I will be at Expo.

[13:14] Nobody's going to keep me from the show and the part that Rob also doesn't get is I have

[13:19] a lot of fans.

[13:20] I have a lot more fans than the people that are saying he shouldn't be allowed to come

[13:25] here.

[13:26] He's like a problem for this community and for this hobby.

[13:29] I'm going to be there.

[13:31] I might have to bring the hound's tooth jacket.

[13:33] I'm going to be rolling through Expo.

[13:35] We're all going to be rolling through there together like Death Row Records, Kale and

[13:39] me.

[13:40] We're going to get Retro Ralph in there.

[13:41] Jamie's going to be there.

[13:43] You know like look you're going to watch the way Canada rolls through a show is nothing

[13:49] but good vibes.

[13:50] It's nothing but good times.

[13:52] And we're going to figure this out.

[13:53] We're going to get some dinners going.

[13:55] We're going to get some like omokase going.

[13:58] I was telling Melvin we're not going to waste our time like every minute in Schlomburg wherever

[14:03] the heck it is.

[14:04] We're going to go find a really nice omokase restaurant in Chicago.

[14:09] I'd rather take a 40 minute Uber and have an epic meal with some of you guys out there.

[14:15] So let's plan this.

[14:16] Let's do it right.

[14:17] And then we'll go back to the show.

[14:19] You know think about like at the show we're going to see what Star Wars.

[14:23] Yeah.

[14:24] But we're all going to have played it before Expo.

[14:25] What else is going to happen at Expo right?

[14:27] We're going to see Padready Gaming is probably going to show you Big Bang Bar.

[14:32] Wow.

[14:33] Snooze Fest.

[14:34] Already know about it.

[14:35] Know the quality.

[14:36] Ain't going to be there.

[14:37] I know Rick is mad.

[14:38] He's sending text messages.

[14:39] They're trying to come at me.

[14:41] They're like how does he know?

[14:43] How does he know?

[14:44] And Melvin's like whatever.

[14:45] I told him.

[14:46] I don't care.

[14:47] I'm off.

[14:48] Melvin is the biggest badass.

[14:50] We need more badasses like Melvin Williams over there in the Netherlands.

[14:55] He's like dude I do all the work.

[14:57] I did all the work on this and now you want to tell me the pounds and not not not not Melvin

[15:03] Kale and Canada.

[15:05] The fact is all of these grown men that are holding on to these pinball secrets like if

[15:11] the world knows Big Bang Bar what's going to happen Rick?

[15:16] What's going to happen?

[15:17] You know what?

[17:08] You know what?

[17:09] You know what?

[17:10] You know what?

[17:11] You know what?

[17:12] If you are going to make 500 aliases, and they sell out, I can indict you, right, you are

[17:16] never trying to make 662, Raaza is coming next, it's going to be much less units, then

[17:23] freakin, aliases, and it's going to sell out, instantly, and I know, you are saying, why

[17:27] are you shilling Raaza, get, I'll tell you, because, shilling Raaza, is just, fun, you

[17:33] have, to, look, at, this game, vehicle, Raaza, baby, you, have, to, remember, the, context,

[17:38] This title has been hanging over the pinball world for like over a decade and the fact

[17:45] that it's finally gonna come out.

[17:47] The fact that Melvin's jamming it with like magnets and he's fixed the geometry and the

[17:52] ramp looks great and where do you see?

[17:55] Where do you see what Leor did to this game?

[17:58] I'm just telling you, it's freaking cool.

[18:00] And look, it's not for everybody and I'm gonna show it because he's my boy and we're having

[18:05] fun and I'm not getting any kickbacks.

[18:08] And I'm just telling you this, if you're a collector and you're saying to yourself,

[18:11] well, I want to have stuff that not everybody has.

[18:14] Yeah, cool.

[18:15] Go buy Harry Potter CE and everybody has it.

[18:18] Go buy every stern, everybody has it.

[18:21] If you buy a Raza, I'm not gonna say it's gonna make your ding dong bigger or you're gonna

[18:25] be cooler or people are gonna want it and it's gonna go up in value, but at least you'll

[18:30] have something different.

[18:31] And I will say this, having seen the game and seeing the changes in it, it's just like

[18:36] the deep root game on crack.

[18:39] And that's the best way to describe it.

[18:40] All right.

[18:41] And look, it's not even that far away.

[18:43] I think we might see Raza announced by the end of the year and they need it because once

[18:49] they stop making the Alice's, they're gonna move on to this.

[18:53] Good news for everyone who's waiting on your Alice topper.

[18:56] You're gonna get them real soon.

[18:58] I'm hearing the original vendor is back making them.

[19:02] So if you're worried about not getting the right quality topper, you're gonna get it

[19:08] and everyone's gonna be made whole.

[19:11] This is Dutch's new thing.

[19:12] They'll make you wait.

[19:14] But in the end, like a loaf of bread, they're gonna make you whole.

[19:18] Canada, what are you on this morning?

[19:19] I don't know.

[19:20] It's Friday.

[19:21] The kids are all right.

[19:22] I mean, isn't that all that really matters?

[19:24] I'm watching my little ones.

[19:26] They take a little power wheels around the block.

[19:28] It's the most adorable thing.

[19:30] They both get in it and it makes me happy.

[19:32] You know, it's never gonna make me that happy.

[19:35] A $13,000 pinball machine.

[19:38] You know, it's never gonna make me that happy.

[19:40] A $15,000 pinball machine.

[19:42] I love pinball.

[19:43] I think all these games have their work cut out, but my overall feeling lately, I think

[19:48] Star Wars is gonna be mediocre.

[19:50] I think Beetlejuice is gonna be sold out in nine minutes.

[19:54] And then I think it's gonna be like walking dead remastered is gonna actually have more

[19:59] Spike 3 in it than Star Wars.

[20:02] I also, I'm just gonna say this, I think walking dead might be a smokescreen.

[20:07] How do they not make Tron?

[20:10] Tron is blowing up again in culture.

[20:12] Tron is back.

[20:13] The new movie and you're gonna wheel out the walking dead.

[20:17] If Stern makes that move, again, it just keeps telegraphing that they're like building

[20:22] their plans in a vacuum and they're missing the forest for the trees.

[20:27] I read a long thing from Jerry Stelenberg about tariffs.

[20:31] I mean, Jerry wrote this really long explanation about what tariffs do to small businesses.

[20:38] And, you know, it's interesting.

[20:40] I don't disagree with him.

[20:42] It's making it more expensive for all of these companies to source their parts from China.

[20:49] The US, you know, sort of vendors out there charge a lot more for the products than overseas.

[20:56] Like that was never a mystery to anybody.

[20:59] But I think the part that's gonna really happen is like this could just put people out of business.

[21:05] It absolutely could put people out of business.

[21:07] Like if the margins aren't there, then how are you gonna pay people?

[21:12] How are you gonna make enough money to invest in the next title?

[21:16] With multi-morphic, Jerry listed out like six different options we could do based on this.

[21:24] And I'm just a cynic.

[21:25] I'm a little sarcastic.

[21:27] And I was like, Jerry just keeps forgetting option number seven.

[21:31] Option number seven has been staring him in the face now for 15 years.

[21:36] Just make a normal pinball machine.

[21:38] That's it.

[21:38] Let's just make a normal pinball machine.

[21:40] This whole thing, like when you read the way they talk about multi-morphic, we've revolutionized.

[21:44] We did like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[21:45] You haven't.

[21:46] You haven't.

[21:47] And I'm just gonna say this.

[21:48] I also don't think he sold more multi-morphics than Canadian subscribers.

[21:56] I'm just gonna say it because he won't tell us the number.

[21:58] So I'm here to tell you, I think that Jerry hasn't sold 662 units.

[22:04] Now, I want him, if he disagrees, give us the actual number.

[22:09] How sad is it in this entire hobby that nobody will tell us their sales data other than companies

[22:16] like Spooky where it is transparent because they're only making this many?

[22:21] Like, look at the pinball brothers and all of their shenanigans around.

[22:26] Well, we only have 150 spots left.

[22:28] All right.

[22:29] That's after they said they were making 800 predators.

[22:31] Okay.

[22:32] So what is it, guys?

[22:33] What is it?

[22:34] Come on.

[22:35] Like it just amongst friends, amongst thieves.

[22:37] What did you really sell?

[22:39] Did you sell 100 and you've got 150 left?

[22:41] Did you sell 150?

[22:43] You've got 150 left.

[22:44] What is it?

[22:45] Obviously, this isn't the plan.

[22:46] Nobody, nobody would go down a road to get that license without Arnold, do all the work

[22:53] and all we can sell this 300.

[22:55] Absolute failure.

[22:56] I think, I think they're done.

[22:57] I do.

[22:57] I think they're done.

[22:58] And also with tariffs for these European companies that the games now are like $12,000

[23:05] and that's with them eating the tariffs.

[23:07] It's over.

[23:08] It's game set match.

[23:10] It's a whole new world.

[23:12] Europe can't even get their hands on Star Wars.

[23:14] My poor European friends, they can't get their hands on the Star Wars game.

[23:20] The good news is you might not even want to get your hands on it.

[23:24] If you're reading the room gang, it doesn't seem like this is going to be the game you

[23:29] absolutely need to sort of import, if you will.

[23:32] Oh, look, gang, happy Friday.

[23:35] I really, really, really can't wait because we're just like four days away.

[23:40] There's zero hype.

[23:42] There is zero enthusiasm.

[23:45] I really do question what the CMO is doing over there.

[23:50] I really do question how out of touch Stern has really become with the community.

[23:57] And I think they need to like reset it all.

[24:00] I do.

[24:00] It's what I told George.

[24:02] It's what I told Seth.

[24:04] It's what I told Gary.

[24:05] I don't think they're focused on the right aspect of the community.

[24:10] When you start highlighting for you streamers out there, there's no one gives.

[24:14] No, if you're talking to pinball streamers, you're talking to point one percent of people

[24:19] who buy these games.

[24:21] It's not what you want to highlight.

[24:22] And I know Jack's a streamer, but is that what we need?

[24:25] Do you actually think pinball streaming equals any more sales?

[24:29] I think it turns people off.

[24:31] I got to be honest.

[24:32] When you watch a pinball stream for an hour, the last thing I want to do is go buy one.

[24:36] Like it literally is the last thing I want to do.

[24:39] What makes pinball, and I'm telling you, this is the one thing they all get wrong.

[24:42] You know what the number one piece of content is that they should be capturing more frequently?

[24:50] I'm going to tell you this right now.

[24:51] It's also the only, and I mean this, the only good thread in all of pin side or on all of pin side.

[24:59] It is what you want to communicate.

[25:02] It is what you want to show.

[25:03] It is the best pinball content that is in the world, is looking into people's game rooms.

[25:11] That is what people want to see.

[25:14] I remember watching, I think it was like, I think it was Christina Aguilera had like two

[25:19] pinball machines in this epic living room.

[25:23] That is what I would want to showcase.

[25:25] That is cool.

[25:27] When people see how cool pinball looks in their home, that is the number one thing that

[25:34] would drive people to purchase.

[25:37] It's not your stupid explanation of the rule set.

[25:41] It's not me hearing about how I need to adjust the Vuck with my finger.

[25:46] It's not watching Dwight walk over the machine and hit every switch with his finger and spoil

[25:51] all of the code that's supposed to be serendipitous when you unbox it.

[25:57] The number one thing would be showcasing how when you get a pinball machine, it will transform

[26:05] your home like nothing else you buy.

[26:08] I believe that.

[26:09] That's why when you're going to bring Star Wars out into the world, do you want to see

[26:15] it in Stern's little dungeony room with 30 guys that haven't hit the gym in a year and

[26:25] see all these guys that you know are shilling for Stern in this loud room?

[26:32] I don't want to see Star Wars like that for the first time.

[26:36] How about you go and you unveil it somewhere special?

[26:39] How about you bring it down to Disney?

[26:42] How about you have the door to the Millennium Falcon open up and there's the game?

[26:47] How about you put the first Star Wars pinball machine?

[26:50] How about you put it in the cantina in Disney World?

[26:54] When you announce that and the first person to go see it will share it with the pinball

[26:59] world.

[27:00] My point is this, whenever I see how they bring these games out, it crushes my soul as

[27:07] a marketer because they have so much opportunity to do something that will leave an indelible

[27:13] impression on us and they do nothing.

[27:17] It's lazy and then they want us to spend $7,000 to $13,000.

[27:22] I'm over it.

[27:23] I'm over it.

[27:24] I'm just going to say this, 98% of pinball marketing absolutely sucks.

[27:30] They have no idea what they're doing and I would love to help them out.

[27:35] I went there and they just can't get over the fact that I'm really, really good at what

[27:40] I do because they're nervous about my personality and all I would do is help them sell more

[27:47] games everybody.

[27:48] Canada out, happy Friday.

[27:50] Can't wait to see it later.
