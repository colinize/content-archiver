[00:00] Old Habits Die Hard, Old Soldiers Despaired Away, Old Habits Die Hard, Hard in the November Rhymes.

[00:17] If I had a pinball company, I would make sure that every single move I did was targeting

[00:30] the individual that I know wants to buy a pinball machine.

[00:35] I would put all of my company resources into creating the best possible products that would

[00:42] make those people, when they see what I've developed, have to hand over their money because

[00:48] I made exactly something that they've been waiting for.

[00:54] That is the brief I feel like that should be on the wall of every single pinball company.

[01:00] And yet time and time again we see moves like we saw today at IOPUP.

[01:05] Jersey Jack Pinball is now trying to bring their super expensive pinball machines into

[01:11] the world of redemption games.

[01:14] They would like people to play pinball and go to locations and play a pinball game to

[01:20] get back tickets to trade in those tickets for some cheap gifts.

[01:25] What about 12 to $15,000 pinball machines aligns with the behavior of people that go

[01:33] to redemption arcades?

[01:36] People want to play some ski ball, they might want to do some pop a shot, you know, those

[01:40] fun quick games where you get some tickets but the games themselves are super approachable,

[01:47] super easy.

[01:48] Who's going to go play pinball machines that are so complex, who's going to try to get

[01:54] deep into Elton John or the Godfather or Toy Story 4 for the chance to win some redemption

[02:02] tickets?

[02:03] It doesn't really make much sense.

[02:06] And I just don't understand why Jersey Jack is even applying any effort or resources to

[02:14] this endeavor.

[02:16] And then when I hear from Jack Winari that turning pinball into a redemption game and

[02:21] turning Jersey Jack pinball machines into redemption games has always been a dream of

[02:27] his since he started this company.

[02:31] I don't know people.

[02:32] I really don't know anymore.

[02:35] What motivates these owners, really what motivates these people at the helm of these pinball

[02:40] companies, what I can tell you is this.

[02:44] The thing most people want to redeem in the world of pinball is a return on their investment

[02:48] when they buy your 12 to $15,000 game.

[02:53] If I buy a $15,000 Godfather, I would like to redeem somewhere near maybe $13,000 for

[03:00] my investment.

[03:02] You know what people are getting for their Godfather CEs?

[03:05] More like $9,000.

[03:07] And there's this war going on in pinball against the second hand value of games.

[03:12] I'm seeing it everywhere.

[03:13] A dude just listed a Metallica LE, the new one, the Metallica Remastered LE.

[03:20] He listed it for $17,000.

[03:24] That gentleman is getting thumbs down by everybody.

[03:28] Like 15 or 18 thumbs downs on his post.

[03:32] He has a game.

[03:33] He bought something that has more demand than supply.

[03:36] He's supposed to just give it away, right?

[03:38] He's supposed to do what with it now.

[03:40] Say he wants to sell it.

[03:41] For whatever reason he wants to sell it.

[03:43] Now look, I know what you're saying.

[03:45] Well, Canada, if he just wants to get out and get his money back, nobody would have a problem

[03:50] with that.

[03:51] Okay, so he should sell it for what?

[03:54] $13,000?

[03:56] That's what everybody would love him to do.

[03:58] I want to take a counter argument to this whole thing.

[04:01] I want to play devil's advocate.

[04:02] If we want this hobby, if we want this hobby to survive, I mean this, like as a new and

[04:08] box hobby, because remember, if people stop buying new and box games, all of these pinball

[04:14] companies are going to go out of business.

[04:17] Let me repeat that.

[04:19] If new and box sales dry up, pinball as we know it will be done.

[04:25] It will become a hobby in which we buy games that have already been made, and it'll just

[04:30] be about restoring the classic games and keeping the games that are in the market running,

[04:36] but there will be no new and box pinball machines.

[04:39] There will be no pinball companies thriving if nobody buys new and box.

[04:45] And new and box sales are going to plummet and tank catastrophically if no new and box

[04:52] games hold any value.

[04:54] And also, new and box sales are going to suffer people, and I'm just going to say this, they're

[04:59] going to suffer if no new and box game ever goes up in value.

[05:05] If every single game that comes out goes down in value by a significant amount of money,

[05:11] what do you think that's going to do to the pinball market over the next five years?

[05:16] What do you think that's going to do to all the people that used to buy new and box games

[05:20] and either get out for a minimal loss or actually get out with a little bit of a game?

[05:26] There's only been one machine in the last four years, I mean this one machine that has actually

[05:33] been scalpable.

[05:35] Is that a phrase scalpable where you could actually flip it for more money than you bought it for?

[05:40] And the only time that has happened in the last four years is Metallica LE remastered.

[05:47] Jaws wasn't selling for over 13, James Bond wasn't, Foo Fighters wasn't, Venom wasn't,

[05:53] James Bond 60th wasn't, no spooky game was, heck no Jersey Jack game was, not a single game.

[06:01] Not a single game, and when you have a large portion of this hobby, and when you have a

[06:06] large demographic of this hobby who consider themselves to be collectors, think about that for

[06:12] a minute.

[06:12] So then collecting is just dead.

[06:14] There's no reason to collect any of these games, I mean it.

[06:18] There's no reason to collect these games because if they don't hold any value whatsoever for

[06:22] collectors, then you might as well just get the premium.

[06:26] And then heck why stop there?

[06:27] You might as well just get the pro.

[06:30] Every single game, it's the same exact experience on the pro as it is on the other games for the

[06:38] most part, right?

[06:38] There's some mechanical things here and there, but the software is identical.

[06:43] In every single game, there is no game that removes any of the real sort of feel and emotion

[06:50] and experience from the game when you buy the cheapest version of the game.

[06:55] So I don't know, you know, I'm just sitting here at night, Brenda's flying to Ireland and I'm

[06:59] thinking about this hobby.

[07:01] I'm looking at these Metallica accessories, they just got dropped on us today.

[07:07] A thousand dollars for one of the cheapest looking toppers ever.

[07:11] Expression lighting kit is expensive, side armor, shooter knobs.

[07:16] I think if you bought everything, someone who bought all of it, it was something like 2400

[07:21] dollars for everything to accessorize a Metallica premium.

[07:26] You know, now we've got like premiums with everything on it are getting close to $13,000.

[07:33] It's just kind of crazy and I don't know about you, but I've just been feeling like,

[07:39] man, like where'd the fun go?

[07:41] Like where's the enthusiasm around these games?

[07:44] And at these prices, it's all just gone kind of bonkers.

[07:48] And I just felt a little bit like it was refreshing to see, well, finally a game where

[07:54] there's more demand than supply.

[07:57] Finally a game where like people were fighting to get their hands on it.

[08:01] We haven't seen that in four years, but the problem nowadays is when Stern did that,

[08:07] now everyone's angry.

[08:09] Everyone doesn't want that.

[08:10] Everyone wants to thumbs down anyone who wants to scalp that machine.

[08:14] And look, I've been in this hobby for 12 years.

[08:17] And if you got a Ghostbusters LE and you got it for sticker and you sold it for a couple

[08:22] thousand over sticker, you weren't getting yelled at by everybody.

[08:27] There wasn't this vitriol like there is now.

[08:29] And I don't understand it because you used to get a Ghostbusters for like 8500.

[08:35] And then you would scalp it for 10, 5 and everybody won.

[08:38] Well, now that the LE's are 13,000, add a couple more grand onto the scalp price and 17K.

[08:46] In terms of like the ratio you want over sticker for the game, it's kind of the same.

[08:51] Now look, do I think this guy is going to sell that Metallica for 17,000?

[08:55] Yes, I do.

[08:56] Absolutely.

[08:58] Because you know what?

[08:59] Someone's doing the math and someone's looking at the damn premium, all the accessories.

[09:04] And is like, well, am I going to drop 13,000 on an unlimited run game?

[09:09] If I spend 17 on this LE, at least it's going to probably hold value better than the premium.

[09:17] And I think Metallica LE is because it's such a popular theme.

[09:22] I don't think you're ever going to see one for 13.

[09:24] You're not.

[09:25] I just don't ever think it's going to go that low.

[09:28] And people remember like I saw Godzilla LE's.

[09:32] Godzilla LE's.

[09:33] We're going for 18 to $19,000 during the height of COVID.

[09:38] Godzilla.

[09:39] There's a thousand of them.

[09:40] And there's half as many Metallicas.

[09:43] Now, yes, Godzilla might be the best game of all time, but now they've made so many of them.

[09:49] And I would argue maybe the black and white is the nicest version of Godzilla.

[09:53] And Stern is teasing that they're never going to make it again.

[09:56] They're going to make it again.

[09:57] But my point being is this.

[10:00] If we go to war against the second hand market in pinball and we get angry that people want to

[10:08] sell their machines for more than they paid for them, we will inadvertently destroy this hobby.

[10:16] We will.

[10:17] It'll be over.

[10:18] They might as well then just make one version of a game.

[10:22] And then you might as well just go to a damn arcade and play it.

[10:25] You might as well just stop losing thousands of dollars on every single new and box game.

[10:31] Because the candle has to burn both ways.

[10:34] If you're going to lose three to $4,000 on every single Stern LE, if you're going to lose $5,000

[10:42] on every single Jersey Jack CEU buy, then you've got to be able to make $3,000 to $5,000 on the

[10:50] super hot titles that actually have the demand.

[10:54] And I don't think people should come out with their pitchforks when those moments happen.

[11:01] If you grab a Harry Potter CE and it sells out on day one, yeah, your Harry Potter CE

[11:08] might be worth $20,000.

[11:10] And yeah, you might want to sell it.

[11:12] And you know the reason the guy might want to sell it?

[11:15] Because he might have lost $5,000 on Godfather.

[11:20] He might have lost $4,000 on Toy Story.

[11:22] And he just wants to recoup.

[11:24] He just wants to recoup some of that loss.

[11:26] And he's not allowed to do it.

[11:28] Because the price police will come out, these moral high horse people,

[11:32] and come after anybody that wants to do what they want with the game they bought.

[11:37] And I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

[11:39] But if you get a game there in square from a dealer or a distro,

[11:43] you got on a list and you bought the game, it's yours to do what you want to do with it.

[11:49] Don't listen to anybody else.

[11:51] And it annoys me.

[11:52] It annoys me.

[11:54] Should I sell my house?

[11:56] When I go to sell this house, should I sell it for what I paid for it?

[12:00] Because it's not fair that I made money off of it.

[12:02] Oh, but if the guy unboxes the Metallica and plays it for a few months,

[12:06] then he's allowed to sell it for $17,000.

[12:09] Is that the rule that you have to unbox it and play it?

[12:12] Right?

[12:13] Like all these distributors do when they have like their friends stream the games.

[12:16] And it's like, yeah, we're not going to scalp games.

[12:18] We're just going to open them up.

[12:20] You can't scalp anything, but they have to open up the games to sell them below map pricing.

[12:25] It's all stupid.

[12:26] This hobby needs to wake up.

[12:28] Games that are a year old, you should be able to get them on sale,

[12:32] advertised from a dealer.

[12:34] Games that are super popular and have gone up in price,

[12:38] let people sell them for what the market will bear.

[12:41] If you destroy that, I'm telling you,

[12:43] you're just going to destroy the entire hobby because nothing is going to go up in value.

[12:48] Everyone is going to avoid new and box pinball.

[12:51] And when everyone starts avoiding new and box pinball,

[12:54] then what happens?

[12:55] Right?

[12:55] What's going to happen to these companies?

[12:57] And I don't know how you don't avoid new and box pinball because at these prices,

[13:02] it's all stupid.

[13:03] Everyone's losing so much money and maybe you're just so wealthy.

[13:06] And I know some of you are, but most of you are not.

[13:10] Most of you cannot afford to buy these things and lose this much money on every single game.

[13:16] And you absolutely know it.

[13:18] That's where I'm at right now, people.

[13:20] We need stuff to go up in value.

[13:23] We need stuff to go up in value to counteract the stuff that's lost so much value.

[13:28] You know, when I gave away my metallic at MSRP,

[13:31] I knew I left a lot of money on the table.

[13:34] And if I tried to sell it for more money because I lost a lot of money in other areas,

[13:39] I wasn't allowed to because I'm a public figure, right?

[13:42] I got to do what's right.

[13:44] And when you try to apply like this morality to these super expensive games,

[13:50] when you look at the medium income of the average person on planet Earth,

[13:55] and you look at how many people are suffering out there in the world,

[13:59] and you look at how many people can't afford their groceries or their mortgages or their car payments,

[14:04] you're going to come at somebody who's going to make a profit on a pinball machine

[14:10] as someone who's a bad individual.

[14:13] Let me tell you this right now.

[14:14] I've scalped many games over the years,

[14:16] and let me tell you who buys my games from me.

[14:19] Multi-millionaires.

[14:20] They don't even blink when they write a check for like 18 for that or 22 for that.

[14:27] You know, every time I've sold a game, most of the people who bought them,

[14:30] they're not on pin side.

[14:32] They had no idea the game was even coming out.

[14:35] They're just a fan of the theme and they have disposable income.

[14:38] They're not upset.

[14:39] They were just happy to get one.

[14:41] And it does bring up this entitlement issue.

[14:43] It's like, well, pinball fans who really wanted the game, they feel entitled to getting one.

[14:49] Well, let me tell you something.

[14:50] Then get on a list.

[14:52] Then build a relationship with a dealer and a distro.

[14:55] Then figure out what you need to do to get your hands on a game.

[14:58] If you're just going to kick and scream when someone gets one because they have a relationship,

[15:03] and even if that person just wants to buy it to flip it, so what?

[15:07] So what?

[15:08] How are you going to stop that?

[15:10] If these companies really wanted to stop that, then they could, but they don't want to.

[15:15] It's healthy.

[15:16] I'm telling you right now, it seems like a terrible thing, but it's healthy to have

[15:21] a secondhand market where people are flipping these things for more money.

[15:26] Watch what's going to happen.

[15:27] It's all going to go away.

[15:28] It kind of all has gone away.

[15:30] Metallica has been the only game, as I said, in four years that actually went up in value.

[15:35] And I'm looking at now, there's thousands of you out there, thousands of you out there

[15:39] that have bought Pimball Machines, New Inbox, and yeah, they're bringing you joy.

[15:43] They're bringing you pleasure.

[15:44] But a lot of you out there are going to get bored of those games.

[15:47] And when you go to move them on to get the new New Inbox games, which are so expensive to begin with,

[15:54] it's going to sting like never before.

[15:57] And every year that this goes on, more and more people are going to stop buying New Inbox games.

[16:04] And we're not going to go out and play Pimball to get redemption tickets.

[16:08] I have no idea what goes on inside the head of Jack Winari.

[16:12] If I could morph into Jack Winari for a year, like T1000, like Terminator style,

[16:18] I would change a lot of things with this company.

[16:21] I would go get themes people want.

[16:23] I would stop making so many versions of his games.

[16:26] I would stop pricing himself out of the market.

[16:29] There's so many things this company should be doing differently.

[16:32] But what do I know?

[16:34] I'm just watching what happens out there.

[16:36] I mean, they're seemingly very excited about this redemption thing.

[16:40] I mean, come on, guys.

[16:41] I mean, look at IAPA for a minute.

[16:42] Like IAPA and Pimball.

[16:44] Like Pimball is like this old thing showing up at IAPA.

[16:49] And it's so outdated.

[16:51] Like it's so outdated.

[16:52] Like just embrace what you are.

[16:55] You're an old toy for old men.

[16:58] That is what you are.

[17:00] And look, everyone's going to get old.

[17:03] And the next generation of old men that are going to be into Pimball,

[17:06] because you have to be an old man to make enough money to buy these damn games.

[17:11] Guess who it's going to be?

[17:13] It's going to be Killian and Cassian.

[17:15] It's going to be your children when they grow up.

[17:17] That's the next generation of Pimball.

[17:20] And if they want to expand Pimball right now,

[17:22] it's not doing what they're doing now.

[17:25] The way you expand Pimball right now is you get people like us to invite a friend into the hobby.

[17:31] And you find a way to incentivize people to make that invite to a friend.

[17:36] So if you bring someone in and create a new inbox Pimball buyer,

[17:40] we're going to give you some discount on the next game you buy.

[17:44] Do they try stuff like that?

[17:45] I've never seen a single Pimball company reward someone for bringing somebody new into Pimball.

[17:52] They don't even know how to grow.

[17:54] They don't even know how to measure growth.

[17:56] They just think if they do like contemporary themes, new people are going to buy Pimball.

[18:01] It's not going to work.

[18:02] They don't have the money.

[18:03] When this hobby finally wakes up and looks at itself in the mirror,

[18:08] you got to go more nostalgic themes.

[18:10] You got to create a world under glass.

[18:12] You got to make magic.

[18:13] And you got to give us everything now for this much money.

[18:16] It's that simple.

[18:17] I don't want to go into Dave and Buster's and see a bunch of Jersey Jack games.

[18:22] That's not going to do it.

[18:23] That's not going to do anything for your product.

[18:25] Nobody who goes into Dave and Buster's goes home later that night and says,

[18:30] honey, I had so much fun on that game.

[18:32] Hey, do we have $15,000 lying around to go buy one?

[18:36] No, they got a few redemption tickets and they walked out with like a rubber eraser.

[18:40] Everybody, Canada's Pimball podcast.

[18:42] Thanks for the support.

[18:43] Have a good night.

[18:44] I lost my voice.
