[00:00] Cause the eyes of the ranger are upon you

[00:06] And all you do is gonna see

[00:10] When your indexes look behind you

[00:15] Cause that's where the rangers gonna be

[00:18] Let's do it!

[00:20] We haaa pinball fans!

[00:27] It is Friday March 18th

[00:30] And we are headed to Texas Pinball Festival today

[00:34] This is such an exciting day

[00:36] I've been waiting for this day for so long

[00:38] And it's finally here

[00:40] Canada is gonna get on a plane at noon

[00:43] From LaGuardia and go to Dallas for the Texas Pinball Festival

[00:47] I've got a really fun episode today for you guys

[00:50] Hopefully some of you guys who are traveling will listen to this

[00:53] Have an interview with a really interesting man up in Vancouver

[00:57] His name is Seven Graylands and he's opening up his own pinball arcade

[01:02] Called Pinball Rama

[01:03] So I'm gonna air that interview for you guys in a little bit

[01:06] But I just wanna real quickly just say how excited am I to just be at this day

[01:12] I've been planning it for a really long time

[01:14] Gonna be hanging out with Ty Girl Law and seeing a bunch of you guys from the forum at the festival

[01:20] And I just kept thinking about it

[01:22] I couldn't sleep I've been up since 5 in the morning

[01:24] Sort of have like the nervous energy of a six year old

[01:27] On Christmas morning just like waiting for this day to occur

[01:30] And I just kept thinking about pinball

[01:32] And how special it is

[01:34] You know how this machine and this silver ball can bring us from all these different states

[01:41] All these different walks of life

[01:43] People are coming from Europe, people are coming from probably Asia, from New Zealand, from Australia

[01:48] People are lugging 250 pound machines across the world, across the country

[01:53] To get to Texas, to the pinball festival there

[01:56] You know what makes pinball so special that we give up our time, we give up our energy

[02:03] We give up our money, we give up our vacation days to go celebrate his glory

[02:09] And let me just concisely say what I think is so special about pinball

[02:12] I think pinball is like for me it's the ultimate metaphor for life

[02:16] There's good days, there's bad days

[02:18] Just like in pinball, some days you've mastered it, some days it kicks your butt

[02:22] But no matter how good you get, there's always room for improvement

[02:25] Pinball is like inherently social

[02:27] I think it's the people that pinball brings together that makes it so much fun

[02:32] There's nothing like getting three of your buddies and playing pinball on a machine

[02:36] Pinball is this analog thing, you have to go play it

[02:41] You have to physically stand in front of it, it can't be digitized

[02:44] It's not one of these annoying things that all these millennials with their smartphones looking like zombies playing games

[02:50] No, it's not that crap at all

[02:52] It's a big piece of wood with pain on it

[02:56] And a ball bouncing around

[02:58] I love that, it's a work of art

[03:01] Let me think about it, one of the two biggest elements of pinball is wood and pain

[03:07] What other toy do we use in 2016 or form of entertainment where wood is a primary ingredient?

[03:15] I think that's incredible

[03:18] And ultimately, and this is about the show itself, pinball has the past, present, and future

[03:24] It's really this, if you're in the hobby right now

[03:27] I don't think there's any more exciting time to be in the pinball hobby

[03:30] Because it has such a great past

[03:32] It has the past that's filled with an incredible story of it being banned by the US government

[03:38] It almost went through like a prohibition period

[03:41] It got the amazing shot by Mr. Sharp where he pointed to a skill shot

[03:45] And got the ban lifted in the 70s

[03:48] It's got EM games, it's got solid state, it's got DMD

[03:53] But in 2016, we are at a point where pinball is still live and kicking

[03:59] And there's a future, there's new machines coming out, you know, shipping this week

[04:04] We have the Hobbit shipping, which is amazing news

[04:07] We have Ghostbusters that's about to ship, we have Big Lebowski that's about to ship

[04:11] You know, all these things are happening and there's a future of pinball

[04:14] It's not like people who collect arcade games where you're constantly looking back

[04:17] There's no arcades coming out new and box, but pinball is here and now

[04:21] It's a glorious time so I can't wait to get down there

[04:25] And what a great week it's been, just a little housekeeping

[04:28] John Trudeau was on Facebook yesterday on Stearns page

[04:32] Answering Q&A around Ghostbusters and it was amazing to see this machine and hear him talk about it

[04:37] And the magnetic slings that are really going to add a new element and be this fun new thing to put into a machine

[04:44] And I have to say this, guys, we should celebrate this stop

[04:48] He's putting a new innovation into the machine, I saw some guys ask silly questions like

[04:53] Do you think the magnetic slings are going to make the game fun?

[04:56] What do you think he's going to say no, I put them in there because they detract from the fun of the machine?

[05:01] Come on, guys, we keep asking for innovation and pinball, we keep asking for new things for fun new elements

[05:07] There's decades of machines that have been doing the same stuff over and over

[05:11] Forget the cookie cutter, this guy's putting in magnetic slings, that's an amazing thing

[05:16] What else happened this week? Oh yeah, I can't go an episode without mentioning this

[05:21] But everyone's favorite Ghostbusters critic, Alien Highways creative pinball director is still talking crap about Ghostbusters

[05:29] A machine everybody loves, I mean I don't even want to say a lot about this

[05:33] But he went on the Facebook and said that the video modes are shit on Ghostbusters

[05:39] He's still talking smack, guys, can we all just stop with all the smack talking of other people's machines for once

[05:45] And just build machines, ship them and let the work through the talking, come on guys, it's pinball

[05:50] Make your machine and let it be great

[05:53] I'm really excited, I hope you can hear the enthusiasm, I got to jump on a client call and then I'm like head it to the airport

[05:58] It's going to be great, I hope you enjoy this interview

[06:01] I'm probably going to be doing shows at the festival, hopefully each night

[06:05] I gave up drinking for Len, so we'll see if I can stick with that

[06:10] From the pictures I've been seeing, it's all about beer and pinball and pizza

[06:15] So that sort of goes against everything I'm trying to do for Len, but we'll see what happens

[06:20] Guys, so without further ado, let me air the interview with this awesome guy, Seven Graylands

[06:25] He's looking to open up an arcade in Vancouver that specializes in pinball

[06:30] And I think you guys will be really interested in his story

[06:33] And I hope you guys can help him out

[06:35] He needs a few more games to get the arcade open

[06:38] So without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, Seven Graylands

[06:41] And I'll see you guys at the Texas Pinball Festival

[06:44] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce Seven Graylands, the Canadian Pinball Podcast

[06:50] Seven reached out to me because he's working on a really, really interesting pinball project

[06:55] And I know a lot of what we talk about on the show is collecting and new pinball prices

[07:00] But I think it'd be fun to talk to someone who's actually working on a pinball project

[07:04] That's going to bring pinball into the local community in a really cool way

[07:08] Seven, welcome to the show

[07:10] Hello there

[07:12] And Seven, for the listeners, give us a real quick sort of background on what your project is

[07:18] I know it's called pinball arama

[07:20] What is pinball arama and what are you looking to do?

[07:23] The idea started about a year ago

[07:25] That I had bought a couple of machines

[07:29] Then as it goes, a couple more came in

[07:33] And then a couple more and I'm thinking, you know, I'm getting this collection of machines now

[07:38] And it would be really cool to be able to have an arcade where people can come in and play and do all of that

[07:44] And I had friends that live in Seattle and they go to the Seattle Pinball Museum all the time and they love it

[07:52] And I'm like, well, why can't I do that up here? There's no reason why I couldn't do it up here

[07:55] There's a ton of pinball people in the Vancouver area

[07:59] And Vancouver itself has a handful of bars in our Cades that are kind of popping up here and there

[08:05] That kind of with a focus on pinball

[08:09] So, you know, why not see if I can get together a collection of 25 or more machines

[08:15] And kind of go from there and see what happens

[08:19] So what is the in Vancouver right now?

[08:21] What is the local pinball scene like? Are there a lot of barcades? Is it here and there?

[08:26] What's it like right now if somebody visits Vancouver and is in the pinball?

[08:30] If you went downtown to downtown in Vancouver, off the top of my head there's four places that you can go that have four or more machines

[08:41] Pinball machines

[08:43] There's not a lot of like the barcade kind of thing going on

[08:47] Okay, a new place opened up that is it started it's called land yachts

[08:54] And it started as if I if I understand it right they were a skateboard company

[09:00] And they had a little space off to the side of their building that they were going to turn into a cafe

[09:06] And they knew a fellow named Kyle or maybe Kyle reached out to them and he owns East Van Amusements

[09:15] And he had a bunch of machines and it was like well why don't we before you turn this into the cafe

[09:22] Why don't we throw some machines in there and just kind of see what happens

[09:26] And they called it the pop-up arcade

[09:28] It just sort of took off and they ditched the plans for the cafe

[09:33] I believe when it opened it was our Cades and pinball and now it's pretty much all pinball

[09:38] And how many machines do they have? Are there places that have like upwards of 20 machines currently?

[09:44] No, no, the land yachts has about 11 I think

[09:49] Pub 340 downtown that has maybe eight

[09:54] There's another arcade downtown that has 10 maybe I think

[10:02] Okay, kind of you know scattered like that but nothing that is nothing that would be similar to the Seattle Pinball Museum

[10:09] Where they have 30 to 40 machines

[10:12] Right, right and that's interesting because it's very similar almost to how pinball

[10:16] Sort of had a resurgence in New York City

[10:18] I think they're the first place that sort of brought in a bunch of machines and got known for being a place to go

[10:24] Play pinball was there was a place called reciprocal skateboard

[10:27] It's a very similar thing like there was a skate shop and then they had an area to the side of it

[10:32] And they put a row of pinball machines and it became like the destination

[10:35] Unfortunately they had a they closed their doors a couple years ago

[10:39] But since then the barcade scene here has sort of exploded so there's like lots of places to go play pinball

[10:45] So your collecting these machines for your home sort of collection and you got the idea that

[10:51] You know if I get enough of them I can bring these machines out into the wild and let people enjoy them

[10:57] As sort of like a business is that what sort of like popped into your head?

[11:01] Yeah, I

[11:03] Was thinking I had gone actually to

[11:06] To the arcade that's on Grandville street in Vancouver and I can't remember the name of it and they have medieval madness and a bunch of other machines

[11:16] Adams family stuff, but they're dingy and dirty and gross and and they're just kind of no fun to play

[11:21] Right, and I thought wouldn't it be cool if if you know the focus was more on the game

[11:28] Instead of people dropping quarters into the machine

[11:32] And how do you do that and the Seattle pinball museum had the fantastic idea of an entrance fee and everything is on free play?

[11:41] So people can focus on playing the game and not necessarily only playing the games they want to pay for

[11:48] But they can try games and and sit and get get you know try different things on the machine and get good at it

[11:56] Well, that's a good point and I think something else that you brought up that's interesting is when you play a machine that you've heard a lot about and it's one of the top pinball machines

[12:06] But if you find it on location and it's and it's beat up and it's not in good condition

[12:10] I think they're completely runes the experience that people have with some of these stellar machines

[12:15] What's and so what's your plan though when you do put games out there and you charge an entry fee and people can just play over and over and over again

[12:23] So they get to learn the machine

[12:25] Maintenance on machines out in the wild. Have you thought about how do I keep these machines running in a good fashion and keep them highly maintained?

[12:36] Are there any concerns about machines getting beat up if you just if you know if people don't have to think about money but they're just constantly playing over and over again?

[12:45] Well, yeah, I mean I I hope that the space that I find when I finally get there will have enough room for a workshop and storage

[12:52] So that I can have a couple of spare machines on the side that if if I have a machine up on the floor to play and let's say the board on it goes out and I don't have a replacement board for it or something

[13:06] Then I can pull that throw it in the back and bring out another one to replace it and then fix the one that is having issues that's that's you know kind of like a hot swap kind of thing

[13:18] I guess that'd be a warm swap or cold swap or whatever right and I was reading on your site seven that so you restore pinball machines right that's part of what you love about the hobby and you're your goal

[13:31] How many machines do you have right now if you don't mind me asking 29 29 okay, so your goal was originally to get 25 when you started so you're you're at the point now where you're ready to go is that where we're at?

[13:44] No, I have I have 29 machines but I have about I probably 17 that would be ready to go okay, okay?

[13:54] Okay, the other ones are in some sort of some manner of disarray or you know and kind of like I in the in the workshop right now I have

[14:01] a skateboard which just got the play field just got repainted and in clear coated and then I've got a poluca which is an older machine and it needs a little bit of maintenance and then the front of the cabinet needs to kind of be cleaned up a bit.

[14:20] So those you know those don't count as the 17 or 18 or whatever I have ready to go so I want 25 ready to go before I start looking for space okay, I think that under 25 you probably you know I don't want people to come in and go oh look there's only a handful of machines here you know I'm not going to pay an entrance fee for that I want them to kind of go wow look at all the machines.

[14:44] When I was reading on your site and I thought was interesting is you really are going for a variety of machines I think I saw even a machine from the 60s even I think far back we're going 70s 80s 90s so there's definitely you're definitely going for a variety you're not going for one of these you know just buy a bunch of brand new

[15:04] sturns and call the day but talk about the kinds of machines that are in the lineup and and when what you're going for with with the lineup.

[15:14] Well what actually happened when I started getting machines from my house is going going going back a little bit farther is that when nitro amusements opened in mission I didn't have any

[15:26] machine pinball machines and I saw them loading in these machines into their shop and and thinking oh they're going to open our cake cool and then I found out they're actually a pinball distributor.

[15:39] So I had gone into the grand opening and I was thinking you know I've never I never even really thought about owning a pinball machine and I thought it would be fun you know maybe one day to have a space invaders or you know an old arcade machine but the pinball

[15:54] idea never even really occurred to me and so I looked on Craigslist and what I got home because I they were selling these machines you don't three four thousand dollars or something I'm like I'm not going to buy a three or four thousand dollar pinball machine if I don't even know if I'm going to play it after a couple of weeks.

[16:12] So I looked on Craigslist and I found someone was selling a ballet hard body for about 800 bucks or something and the thing was in beautiful shape it was the thing look brand new.

[16:23] So I bought it took it home and played the crap out of it like I just love that game everybody hates it because it's goofy looking it looks like the 80s threw up on a box it really is there's there's kind of a cool rules set for it it's got the extra flippers with the little or the extra buttons to for the little save allies and stuff and to be good at that machine it can be kind of tough because it's a little brutal.

[16:51] So but you know that that machine doesn't have any pop bumpers so I thought okay if I buy another machine it's got a pop on first so the next machine I bought which was

[17:03] Alien poker it had pop bumpers on it and more drop targets and stuff and so then the next machine that I wanted was one with like a ramp or something you know what so I was what I was doing was I was sort of building this collection like okay I've got these two machines

[17:20] that have this sort of thing so the next one has to have this sort of thing and then the next one after that has to have something different to it and that's how the collection started to grow.

[17:30] And so then I got like comment then I got river boat gambler then I got tails from the crypt and Hollywood heat and they all have something unique and different about them right and so the that's how the line up started and I'm still kind of continuing with that thought that

[17:47] I want them each to kind of stand different than the next one so you can kind of go down the line and you have not only a different set of rules but sort of a different layout and you know kind of mix it up and when my friends come over once a week we have kind of this pinball night and we go to different people's houses and they come over and I don't have like you know a million dollar lineup with all of the

[18:17] most popular you know top 10 machines or anything but many people have commented that they they like my collection because it is diverse like that there are all these different kind of things and people will get hung up you have

[18:31] you know 10 pinheads in my house and everybody's gathering around like roller games or one night everybody gathered around Hollywood heat

[18:41] which is incredibly simple machine but you have to lock the two balls before you can get the multi ball and you have to shoot it up the ramp and getting it up the ramp before your ball ends and then you can lose that and then the two that you've locked the next guy gets and it's just kind of a fun sort of you know a really good game to play with a group of people and

[19:06] yeah right and and I think that's that's a great point because with with modern pins now especially the most popular pins for such an emphasis on on deep code and and the games have become so complex that I think it is important to have that sort of variety and even going back in pinball to a time when games were engineered to be simpler even right I mean games were when they were put on location

[19:32] they were meant to be instantly gratifying and I have a lot of new friends where I try to get them in the pinball machine and I will walk up to say like the walking dead they might be fans of the show and trying to explain what to do it's just so head scratching but you go to an older machine and if there's just like one or two goals to achieve people have just as much fun and actually enjoy it more because they're not trying to think about so much.

[19:57] Yeah and and I've introduced a lot of people to pinball like on my machines people have played pinball for the very first time and we had my girlfriend's friend came over she had never played before and she looked at all of the different ones and I don't remember the line up that I had set up at the time but she looked at all the different ones and I was explaining kind of you know here's sort of what you want to do when you're playing and not getting to you know technical or weird on her but just sort of like

[20:26] this is kind of the basics of it and I showed her motor don't and that's a you know mid 80s ballie machine kind of during that sort of cheap era of ballet and really the objective of that game the thing that you try to pull off is you you shoot down a drop target what's gives you access to a ramp you go up the ramp it goes around the ramp and then there's a little flipper that you then hit the ball up another ramp it's going to be like a lot of people that are trying to do that and don't see the real thing that you want to do is try to pull off as well as a loop that's going to do it's going to work.

[20:56] into a saucer and then you get a letter.

[21:00] And once you get all the letters,

[21:01] you get a million points or something.

[21:03] And so I said, some of these older machines,

[21:06] this was kind of the objective that you did on it.

[21:09] And shorter that she played that damn machine

[21:11] all night playing that shot.

[21:13] And she was having the best time.

[21:14] Right, right.

[21:15] And that's it.

[21:16] She didn't care about points, she didn't care about rules,

[21:18] she didn't care about anything else.

[21:20] She just wanted to solve this puzzle.

[21:23] And I think that that's what a lot of people

[21:26] in the pinball community forget about is that

[21:29] you have this machine that's this amazing glass covered

[21:35] diorama.

[21:36] It's this little world happening in there,

[21:38] this kinetic sculpture.

[21:40] And people are overwhelmed if they've never played before.

[21:45] They walk up to this and they're like,

[21:46] what the hell am I supposed to do with this?

[21:49] But if it's simple, then they can get into it,

[21:53] they can have fun with it.

[21:55] I have a dragon.

[21:56] I took an interflip dragon to my office where I work.

[21:59] There's 50 people at my office.

[22:03] That's an incredibly simple machine.

[22:04] You have these five little dragon heads

[22:06] that pop out of the play field.

[22:08] There's five buttons that you have to hit

[22:13] to light up your pop bumpers to make points.

[22:16] All they want to do is hit down these damn dragon heads.

[22:19] That's it.

[22:20] They don't care about the points.

[22:22] They don't care about anything else.

[22:24] If they're not in the pinball, they just go up over there.

[22:27] Oh, hit the dragon head.

[22:27] Wow.

[22:28] You know, really fun.

[22:30] And I think what's interesting too

[22:32] is with all the new machines that are out there

[22:34] and the complexity of them, I saw a report

[22:36] that the best earning game of 2015 was Wo Nally.

[22:42] Really?

[22:43] Yeah.

[22:43] A simple, much more like a throwback to the EM error style

[22:46] game that doesn't have all that confusion.

[22:50] It's much more simple to play.

[22:52] So I think that's great that you want to bring this variety

[22:56] and sort of let people jump on machines

[22:59] that all bring a little bit something different to the table.

[23:02] So you've got what you have, what, 18 you said?

[23:05] Ready to go.

[23:07] So you're looking at this about 18 here.

[23:08] OK.

[23:09] And so right now you're in the process of restoring some.

[23:13] Are you also constantly looking on Craigslist

[23:15] and looking out there for deals?

[23:18] What's your process in sort of trying

[23:19] to fill in the blanks to get things going?

[23:22] I'm, yeah, Vancouver is a tough town for Pimball.

[23:29] We're close to Seattle.

[23:30] And a couple other places just over the border in the state.

[23:36] So we have the dollar issue for one

[23:39] is that the Canadian dollar is weak right now.

[23:42] And you can go to Seattle and maybe buy a Goregar or something

[23:49] for about 1,000 bucks.

[23:51] If a Goregar shows up here in Vancouver,

[23:55] it's not going to sell for less than 1,500 Canadian.

[23:59] And if you can find one in good shape for 1,500 Canadian,

[24:03] there's 30 people in front of you waiting to get it.

[24:06] So it says mad dash to get these machines.

[24:09] And I've pretty much given up on,

[24:11] I mean, I still look on Craigslist

[24:13] and I look on a bunch of other websites and things like that.

[24:16] But I'm kind of starting to network out

[24:20] and get a buzz going that I'm looking for these machines.

[24:22] This is why I'm looking for these machines.

[24:25] And I'm trying to find the ones that people have

[24:28] in their basement that they've had for 20, 30 years.

[24:32] They haven't done anything with them.

[24:34] They may or may not work.

[24:35] The last two I bought, I got from an older couple

[24:41] in North Vancouver.

[24:42] They had dealers' choice in jumping jack,

[24:45] these two old EM machines.

[24:48] And they actually found me through Facebook of all places.

[24:53] And contacted me and just said, hey,

[24:56] we've got these two machines if you're interested.

[24:58] And I went over and looked and we worked on a price

[25:02] and I got them.

[25:03] And they were happy just getting them out of their house.

[25:07] They didn't care.

[25:08] Right.

[25:09] They were in storage.

[25:10] They were covered with one of them had insulation

[25:12] underneath it, pink insulation.

[25:15] Another one had a box or something on it.

[25:17] There were these kind of work lights scattered around

[25:20] in front of it and boxes in front of those.

[25:22] And they bought them, I think they said 25 years ago.

[25:28] They haven't turned them on for 10 years.

[25:32] She didn't even know about jumping jack.

[25:35] She kind of thought, well, maybe it worked.

[25:36] Maybe it didn't.

[25:37] And the head was off of it and it was just laying on top of it.

[25:40] The glass wasn't even slid into place.

[25:42] It was just laying on top of the play field.

[25:46] And both of them are actually in fairly good shape.

[25:49] Do you look for stuff locally?

[25:51] Most of the time, just because I imagine shipping

[25:53] is probably a pain too if you find something that's not nearby.

[25:57] I mean, do you drive long distances to get stuff?

[26:01] I've gone on a couple of long adventures.

[26:04] Yeah.

[26:05] I haven't resorted to shipping yet.

[26:08] I want to kind of see the machine first

[26:12] because I kind of have this priority

[26:14] that the play field is my first interest.

[26:19] I want it to look good.

[26:21] Then the black back glass.

[26:23] And then on top of all that, the mechanics and the board

[26:28] and everything.

[26:29] But really, the mechanics and the boards and all that,

[26:32] that's all easily replaceable.

[26:34] But the play field, the back glass,

[26:36] that can get difficult depending on what's wrong with it.

[26:39] So I don't know how many machines I've looked at

[26:41] where the people have said before I went to go look at it.

[26:45] Oh, yeah, the things in great shape.

[26:47] And then I go and look at it.

[26:48] And the inserts are like a half an inch off the play field.

[26:52] And it's missing all the paint down by the flippers.

[26:54] And it's just a nightmare.

[26:57] I think every, yeah, we hear so many sellers

[27:01] ascribe machines as being in great shape.

[27:03] And I always feel bad for the guys that go on these 12 hour

[27:06] trucks just to get there and see the thing in real life,

[27:10] I'm only going to realize that it's not nearly as good

[27:12] as described it.

[27:14] Yeah, I went and looked at F14, I think F14 homecat.

[27:21] And I found the guy on Craigslist.

[27:25] And we sent me emails back from Porthin.

[27:27] He was like, oh, yeah, it's really great.

[27:28] And where he was is about an hour and a half away from my house.

[27:34] So it wasn't a long drive.

[27:36] But I got out there.

[27:38] And it was like a man room sort of a man cave sort of amusement.

[27:48] He never even played the thing.

[27:49] He would turn it on when guests came over

[27:53] because every once in a while the little lights

[27:54] on the top would flash for a track mode.

[27:57] It was set to German.

[27:59] It wasn't even set for English.

[28:01] And he didn't know anything about it or anything.

[28:03] He just liked the little lights that went off from time to time.

[28:07] And he assured me that, oh, yeah, it's in fantastic shape.

[28:10] And the inserts were all screwed up.

[28:13] And it was missing paint.

[28:14] And it was pretty well thrashed.

[28:18] But I didn't know that it was.

[28:20] He's not a collector.

[28:21] It is good.

[28:22] The lights turn on.

[28:23] And that's pretty.

[28:24] Yeah.

[28:26] Right.

[28:26] It was sparkly and pretty.

[28:27] And that was fine.

[28:28] That's all he wanted out of it.

[28:30] So for people listening to this show

[28:32] who might have some pins in their collection

[28:34] that they might be thinking about either selling to you

[28:38] or even donating to get the cause off the ground.

[28:41] What's the best way for people to get in touch with you

[28:44] if they have a machine that is with near Vancouver

[28:46] that could be of interest to you?

[28:49] Probably the easiest way is to go to the website, which

[28:51] is pinballorama.com.

[28:54] And then there's a contact page.

[28:56] So that's pinball.

[28:57] Then O and then R-A-M-A.

[29:00] Yeah.

[29:00] OK, dot com.

[29:01] All right, great.

[29:03] And then in terms of the location

[29:06] of where you're thinking about putting this,

[29:08] do you have a spot or an area of town picked out

[29:12] or once you get the machines and you're

[29:13] going to go look for a location?

[29:15] What's your plan there?

[29:17] Yeah.

[29:17] And that's the location is going to be the location location

[29:22] location.

[29:25] It's going to have to be big enough to support the 20

[29:30] or some odd machines that I start with and then grow.

[29:35] And then it's going to be cheap enough that I'm going

[29:38] to be able to make this thing float because I don't know

[29:42] what's going to happen.

[29:44] I know that there's some interest in it.

[29:46] And a lot of people that I've talked to are like, that's great.

[29:48] I'll go.

[29:49] That sounds like a fantastic idea.

[29:52] And it's really going to depend on the biggest space

[29:59] for the cheapest amount that's easily accessible

[30:02] for the Vancouver area.

[30:04] And Vancouver is kind of different than a lot of towns

[30:08] that if you go down to Seattle, you have interstate 5 runs

[30:12] right through Seattle.

[30:14] And you can be kind of north or you can be kind of south.

[30:18] And you can get downtown fairly easily.

[30:21] Vancouver's not like that.

[30:22] You can, where I am, I have to drive quite a distance just

[30:27] get to the highway to get downtown Vancouver.

[30:31] So just me going out on the weekends to go downtown,

[30:34] I never do it because it's difficult.

[30:36] So there's a bunch of other areas that are kind of in the suburbs

[30:42] that are closer to the highway, which might work.

[30:45] We also have a transit line with the SkyTrain Transit Line,

[30:49] which it's a light rail system.

[30:53] And that, to be on the SkyTrain Line,

[30:57] would be a huge benefit.

[30:59] So I kind of, I have a few places in mind,

[31:06] and none of these are going to matter to you

[31:07] because you don't know the area.

[31:08] But Port Moody is a good area, kind of the Abbott's Ferd area

[31:14] might be good.

[31:17] Richmond area might work, don't know.

[31:20] It's just going to, once I get to that point,

[31:24] I'll just go out and start looking for spaces.

[31:28] And something might pop up that someone might go,

[31:31] oh, hey, I've heard about this thing that you're looking to do.

[31:34] And I've got a great space for you.

[31:36] That would be ideal.

[31:37] Right.

[31:39] And is this something, seven that is sort of like a,

[31:44] you just hope in a break even make a profit great?

[31:46] Or is this something that, is this in replace of a day job

[31:51] or this sounds like something that's going to be,

[31:53] how is this fit into your world?

[31:56] Are you going to go full time on this?

[31:58] Or no, it's going to be a juggling act

[32:02] because I do have a regular nine to five Monday

[32:05] through Friday job.

[32:08] And I don't know how busy I would be on a Monday night.

[32:14] So I think to just get the thing off the ground,

[32:19] I'm kind of looking at just doing maybe Thursday, Friday,

[32:22] and Saturday, and Sunday, like Thursday nights.

[32:26] And then I can kind of pull that off.

[32:29] And I'd be working eight days a week,

[32:32] but what are you going to do?

[32:34] You got to do it, right?

[32:36] And then as time goes by, then I can maybe

[32:40] bring in some other people to help out

[32:42] with it and hire someone to stand at the door and take money.

[32:49] And is there an active league scene around you

[32:52] that you're looking to tap into as well

[32:54] to create that sort of consistent people

[32:56] coming by on those nights?

[32:58] There are a couple.

[33:00] And it would be one of those things

[33:02] that I plan on having a projector

[33:08] that people can put scores upon if they

[33:10] want to have some sort of a tournament there or something.

[33:14] And obviously starting some sort of tournament one night

[33:17] would be maybe once a month, I'll

[33:20] throw a tournament or something in there

[33:22] to get that crowd in.

[33:25] And the question that you asked about just breaking even,

[33:29] that's the plan right now.

[33:32] I don't have any intention that I'm

[33:34] going to be able to retire off of this thing.

[33:37] I'm doing it mostly because it'll

[33:40] be a lot of work, but I think it'll be a lot of fun.

[33:43] And if I can not have to put more money into it

[33:49] and it can support itself, I'll be ecstatic.

[33:54] If the project can afford to purchase more machines,

[34:01] then even more so, that would be fantastic, too.

[34:06] But opening up, I don't have any misconceptions

[34:10] that I don't think I'm going to make anything off of it,

[34:13] at least for the first year.

[34:16] OK, if I knew that.

[34:17] And Gibi.

[34:18] Right.

[34:19] Well, I mean, it's great.

[34:19] I mean, it sounds like an encouragement from wrong,

[34:22] but the goal is really to bring Pimball out into the community

[34:26] and get new people into Pimball.

[34:27] And for those who already love it,

[34:30] to give them exposure to a variety of machines

[34:33] that a lot of times, like for Pimball people,

[34:36] they just never get to play these machines.

[34:38] You know, I think we read a lot about them on the forums,

[34:40] but it's not easy to get access to all these machines

[34:43] if you're not, unless you're going to, like, these big expos

[34:45] and festivals, but not everyone's doing that.

[34:49] Right.

[34:50] And you know, that actually, that kind of fueled some of this for me,

[34:54] because after I had a handful of machines in the house,

[34:58] we went out to a couple places to play.

[35:01] And I saw nothing but new machines, mostly.

[35:04] You know, it was just some newer stirons

[35:05] and things like Adams family and that kind of machine.

[35:12] But you know what I really wanted to play was Firepower,

[35:14] because I hadn't played that for years.

[35:16] I wanted to play Firepower.

[35:17] I wanted to play Space Invaders.

[35:19] I wanted to play some of these older ones,

[35:22] and you just can't find those out in the wild.

[35:24] And that's kind of what, that's the area

[35:27] that I want to try to fill is, you know,

[35:30] here are these kind of funky old machines

[35:32] that you just, you can't find anywhere else.

[35:37] Now it's a good point.

[35:38] I mean, even in New York, we have a lot,

[35:41] there's a lot of pinball popping up,

[35:43] but no matter where you go though,

[35:45] you just see a lot of the same machines.

[35:47] You know, I think I've seen Monster Bash in three different locations.

[35:53] There are every, seems like everyone's got the Metallic,

[35:55] everyone's got like an ACDC.

[35:58] So it's great to bring some of those more unique

[36:02] and sort of rare titles into the public.

[36:04] Now right now, are you married seven?

[36:07] And is that, I don't want to make any assumptions.

[36:11] No, I have a girlfriend.

[36:13] And a great one.

[36:14] But that's another story.

[36:18] OK, wow.

[36:20] Wow, OK.

[36:21] So is your significant others, are they cool

[36:26] with the machines being at home?

[36:28] Because I know for a lot of people,

[36:29] it sounds like you have a lot of machines

[36:30] right now during your house.

[36:32] And for those guys who, and gals who listen, who have collections,

[36:37] that takes up a lot of real estate.

[36:38] Is your significant other cool with the machines being at home

[36:42] and is part of the desire to move them out

[36:44] because you just want to free up space where you live?

[36:48] Well, my girlfriend lives with me, and she loves the machines.

[36:53] She comes down and plays them.

[36:55] And she's on our pinball night.

[36:58] She's gone out with us.

[37:00] Well, she went out a couple of weeks ago with us

[37:02] to someone else's house to play their machines.

[37:04] And I think that if I didn't have any machines in the house,

[37:08] she would be upset.

[37:10] But no, part of it is that my collection has grown to,

[37:16] I can't even, some of the working ones

[37:18] are packed up on the end in the house.

[37:21] And I'd like to be able to play them again.

[37:23] That's part of it.

[37:25] I think that there will always be machines at the house,

[37:29] just maybe not that I have to squeeze by.

[37:33] Right.

[37:34] Well, I can only fit one pinball machine in my home.

[37:37] And I tried a few weekends to move the machine around the living room

[37:43] as many different places I could put it

[37:45] to see if I could get another one next to it.

[37:47] And I just can't make it look cluttered.

[37:50] I mean, I could fit more.

[37:53] I was engaged in my engagement ended

[37:55] because I'd built an arcade in my New York City bedroom.

[37:58] And my new girlfriend is actually really cool with it.

[38:00] She actually didn't want to get rid of the arcade.

[38:02] And she loves playing the pinball.

[38:05] And right now we're just trying to figure out,

[38:08] because I do want to get more machines.

[38:10] And to your point earlier, I've got a load of the rings.

[38:13] But I do, you know, it's a long game with long ball times

[38:17] and deep code.

[38:19] But I also want to just have a fast brutal game that

[38:22] kicks my butt in like three minutes and it's over.

[38:25] Get an interflip dragon.

[38:27] Man, that thing is ruthless.

[38:28] I love dragon.

[38:30] Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, well, it's also

[38:32] to like the games you're mentioning, considering

[38:35] the current climate of new machines where, you know,

[38:40] everything's like $6,000 to $9,000.

[38:43] It's great to be able to, you know, just spend, you know,

[38:46] sometimes just a few hundred even just, you know, $1,000

[38:49] or $2 and have a variety, a different machine that can

[38:54] give you, you know, just as much fun, but in a different way

[38:56] than what the modern games are delivering.

[38:59] Right.

[39:00] And I think too, like if, if I look at the price of the machine,

[39:05] the price of the machine versus the value of what you're

[39:08] doing on the machine, and you look at something like,

[39:12] medieval madness, which is what those are like 10,000 US

[39:16] or something.

[39:16] Yeah, they're on, they're on, like,

[39:19] between 83 and 85 or around 9, even up to 9,000 for the

[39:22] remakes.

[39:23] And then the price is on the originals or fluctuating

[39:26] because of the remakes.

[39:27] But yeah, around that area.

[39:29] But when you, when you think about that amount of money that

[39:31] you're putting into one machine, unless you had a particular

[39:35] desire to have that machine, if you just want a machine,

[39:37] a pinball machine is to play for, for that amount of money,

[39:41] you could get four other really solid machines that probably

[39:47] any of them would be almost as fun, I guess.

[39:52] I played medieval madness.

[39:54] And to me, it's like, yeah, OK, it's all right.

[39:58] Yeah.

[39:59] It's, you know, I look at the top 10 list of the machines

[40:03] that you can go to internet football database and you look

[40:06] to see what are rated the highest.

[40:08] And I've played a lot of those.

[40:13] And I'm just kind of like, yeah, they're OK machines.

[40:14] But I don't know if I would put them personally myself.

[40:18] I don't know if I would put them in my top 10.

[40:20] But and those are the ones that demand so much money.

[40:25] Right.

[40:26] So you find one that's pretty close and it

[40:29] costs a fraction of the price.

[40:30] Well, I think you said something earlier, 7.

[40:32] I thought that was, it rings true is that if you get people

[40:38] together, like four people on any given machine,

[40:42] and if it's a new machine, if it's a machine,

[40:44] they haven't played before, whether it's new or old, it's fun.

[40:47] There's that experience of like, everyone

[40:49] is tackling this challenge together.

[40:52] And I think Pinball is so much more fun

[40:54] when you have people overplaying it.

[40:56] And that's something I learned when I started collecting

[40:59] arcade games and I won Pinball Machine is I rarely turn them

[41:03] on unless people come over because as much as I enjoy them,

[41:08] I just enjoy them so much more with people.

[41:11] And that's why I do enjoy actually getting out

[41:14] of the house more and playing Pinball on location

[41:16] and going to Barcage just because it's really what

[41:20] they were all designed for is to have an audience and play

[41:23] and to be social.

[41:24] And I feel I am jealous of the guys that have the local crew

[41:28] who can come by, their home arcades.

[41:30] And it seems like all my friends are always too busy.

[41:34] And it's hard to get people consistently organized.

[41:37] So when you put these machines out on location,

[41:39] I think that's going to be very rewarding.

[41:41] Just to see people playing them and enjoying them

[41:43] and out in the wild.

[41:46] And I love the first timers.

[41:48] Those are my favorite.

[41:49] The people that have never played before.

[41:52] And watching them interact with this machine

[41:55] and they don't, it's like they're

[41:58] almost afraid to hit the flippers

[41:59] because they're afraid they're going to break it.

[42:01] Then you see them like half an hour later.

[42:04] And they're all over them.

[42:04] They're like, woo, you know, and they're just having

[42:06] the best time.

[42:07] And you can watch them get sucked into the machine.

[42:11] And they just, like, they go into that zone.

[42:13] And it's a really cool thing to see.

[42:15] I really enjoy that.

[42:16] That's part of my favorite part of all of it.

[42:19] Yeah.

[42:20] I found out whenever I introduce my friends,

[42:22] they always have the same sort of behavior.

[42:25] They always hit both flippers at the same time.

[42:27] So that's the first thing I always tell them

[42:29] is don't do that.

[42:30] And then they, because that's the first thing

[42:33] is I just don't want the ball to drain.

[42:35] They don't even realize there's like objectives at all.

[42:40] They just think it's to keep the ball on play.

[42:41] As if it's like the lit.

[42:42] Yeah, that's it.

[42:44] But yeah, I created so much fun.

[42:46] And I'll say this, you know, it is super hard for me

[42:49] to get my friends into the newer pins

[42:52] when they've never played before.

[42:53] So I think it's great that there's

[42:54] going to be machines for the newbies to sort of jump on.

[42:58] And even for guys like me, I mean, I'm 39.

[43:02] I grew up in the arcade in the 80s and 90s.

[43:04] I was never really exposed to EM.

[43:06] So I don't have anything against them.

[43:08] But I just, I don't play them.

[43:12] Just I didn't have any history with them.

[43:14] So it's great to play them even, you know,

[43:17] in locations that have DMD error games, EMG error games.

[43:22] You know, I think it's going to be really cool to have

[43:24] that mix out there for people.

[43:26] Well, and that's a thing too.

[43:27] Is that I was a little, I didn't get my first EM machine

[43:33] until this year.

[43:35] And I was a little hesitant because to, you know,

[43:40] you open them up and you look at it,

[43:41] and you're like, holy crap, what the hell's going on in here?

[43:43] And they're kind of daunting when you first

[43:46] think of having to work on them.

[43:49] But really, they're just analog computers, right?

[43:52] They're pretty basic and straightforward.

[43:53] And once you kind of get the hang of how they, you know,

[43:58] I'm no pro at it, you know, I'm not an expert.

[44:01] But now that I'm kind of understanding them a little bit more,

[44:05] they actually seem a little bit more simpler

[44:08] to deal with than the solid state machines.

[44:12] Because they're just a bunch of switches, right?

[44:16] Switches in electromagnets and that's about it.

[44:18] You know, there's no backup battery

[44:21] after worry about a dim leaking or anything, you know,

[44:23] you can't.

[44:24] Yeah.

[44:25] One thing makes another thing happen.

[44:27] And as long as you know what that path is,

[44:29] you can troubleshoot it.

[44:30] So how did you, seven, how did you get into learning

[44:33] how to repair games?

[44:34] Do you have any history with working on electrical devices

[44:38] or do you just sort of self-taught?

[44:39] Or what's self-taught?

[44:42] I got in, I do computer work on my own in the IT nerd.

[44:50] That's what I do for a living.

[44:51] And I got into that because I was doing music.

[44:56] I was recording music.

[44:58] And I got into synthesizers and electronic music

[45:01] and things like that.

[45:03] And I couldn't way back in the 80s.

[45:07] I couldn't afford to get like a big fancy computer.

[45:11] So I got the next best thing and went to,

[45:15] because they were all apples at the time was what you needed.

[45:18] And so I got a PC and kind of, you know,

[45:20] work to put those things together and kind of stumbled

[45:24] into the computer era like that.

[45:28] And then I wanted to build like little analog delays

[45:33] and things like that.

[45:35] So I would find the circuits and I burn my own circuit boards

[45:39] and I solder the things all together.

[45:41] And that's where my electronic background came from is just

[45:43] then need to make some of these funky little circuits

[45:46] to make one sound go, wah, wah, wah, wah.

[45:51] Right.

[45:52] And so moving into, and I've always been one of those kind

[45:55] of people that in my mind, I see a machine type device.

[46:01] And then my head goes, there's no reason I can't take that apart

[46:04] and fix it and put it back together again.

[46:05] And then I just dive in and do it.

[46:08] And so with the pinball machines,

[46:10] when I got that very first one,

[46:12] the first thing I wanted to do was like, you know,

[46:14] open it up and see what made it take.

[46:17] And then I started the process of, you know,

[46:21] converting it to LEDs and kind of fixing it up.

[46:25] And then I was like, you know, God, there's even more fun

[46:30] I could have with a pinball machine other than playing it.

[46:33] I can open them up and I can work on them

[46:34] and I can tinker with them and play around with them.

[46:38] And my, the one thing that I really want to do

[46:42] is re-theme a game.

[46:43] And I have one, it was a Sinbad meteor,

[46:47] or a Sinbad that, God leave Sinbad,

[46:51] that someone had re-themed for a some software company

[46:58] or something.

[46:59] And so there's all these little like,

[47:00] tux penguins all over it and it was just poorly done.

[47:04] And so that's going to be re-themed as dark ride.

[47:11] Remember those rides that they use to have a carnival

[47:13] so you got in a little car and it drove you around

[47:16] sort of the haunted house with all the black lights?

[47:18] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[47:19] I'm going to do a pinball machine based on that.

[47:22] Because it's pretty open.

[47:23] You can kind of get away with doing whatever you want to,

[47:26] you know, little clowns and skeletons

[47:28] and things on springs that move when the ball goes by them.

[47:31] And then of course, it has to all be done

[47:35] in UV reactive paint and lit by black light.

[47:38] So it'll just be sort of fun.

[47:41] And if I could add elements to it,

[47:42] I want to try to keep the Sinbad layout and the rules

[47:47] and all that because a lot of people likes Sinbad.

[47:51] They like how it plays and they like the game.

[47:53] But so if I can keep that, that's great.

[47:55] And then, but if I could add something else

[47:58] that, you know, maybe I'll add a switch or something,

[48:00] you go over it and something jumps out of your, you know,

[48:03] who knows?

[48:04] All right.

[48:05] So it sounds like seven year.

[48:06] I mean, you're pretty much a pinball renaissance man

[48:09] from a collector to a restore, to a rethemer,

[48:12] to an operator coming up soon.

[48:16] It's been less than two years.

[48:18] And that's, yeah, there's like nothing really

[48:19] what's left.

[48:20] I mean, distributor.

[48:21] And then you've got everything.

[48:24] Well, look, we wish you the best of luck.

[48:27] And I definitely want people who are out there

[48:29] who could help you get your collection to that magical number

[48:33] of 25.

[48:33] I think, you know, hit up seven with any suggestions

[48:37] or leads you might have near Vancouver.

[48:40] And we definitely will check in again seven

[48:42] to see like how things are going

[48:43] and even want to see how the retheme is going.

[48:46] Anything else that, you know, you want to talk about

[48:49] or we should discuss before we hit the end

[48:54] of this episode of Canadi's pinball podcast?

[48:56] Oh, I don't know.

[48:58] I think we covered it.

[48:59] OK.

[49:00] Let me ask you some questions, too.

[49:01] Then we can always like, I can always like edit out

[49:03] some of this just like casual back and forth.

[49:04] So I always, I love to ask people.

[49:07] It sounds like you have a passion for pinball machines

[49:11] throughout the decades.

[49:12] But I always like to ask people, if I

[49:14] gave you $10,000 to buy one pinball machine, which one would you buy?

[49:20] Now, it sounds like you would want to buy like eight

[49:22] and get the place open.

[49:25] But if you had to pick one and it doesn't have to be a new

[49:29] in box, it could be one of the new ones coming out.

[49:31] It could be something from the past.

[49:33] But if you have, do you have like a gray

[49:35] else in there you would like just love to have?

[49:39] I really don't.

[49:40] I haven't really followed the pinball scene.

[49:48] Because I've really only been kind of,

[49:51] you know, I've been waiting in the waters now for less than a couple years.

[49:55] And my knowledge of pinball before that point was the games that I used to play

[50:01] in occasionally play out.

[50:03] I was an arcade guy.

[50:07] Because I grew up in the sort of the golden era of arcades

[50:12] when I remember when Frogger came out, it was all the rage.

[50:15] And we all threw our quarters at it, you know, Frogger.

[50:18] But yeah.

[50:21] And during that era, most of the arcades had maybe one or two pinball machines.

[50:30] They didn't have a lot of pinball machines.

[50:31] It was just all arcades.

[50:33] And I grew up in Seattle.

[50:35] And there was one place in town that had, who was at the Seattle Center.

[50:41] And there was a little arcade down there in Seattle Center proper

[50:45] that had machines like old EM machines and some funky old like those,

[50:53] those black light gun target machines.

[50:57] And some of those things.

[50:59] And that was the first place that I ever played an EM style machine.

[51:03] Even then, I didn't even know what an EM was.

[51:06] But so that's my history of pinball is just what was going on kind of from 79 to 85.

[51:21] And just sort of the machines that I remember back then.

[51:23] So you know, Frogger and Zion and Zion and Firepower and the Kiss machine.

[51:31] Right.

[51:32] Stuff like that.

[51:33] I mean, I kind of like similarly when I was growing up, I was much more in our

[51:38] arcades.

[51:39] And I went to like big arcades like the Nathan's, I went to Nathan's and

[51:43] Yonkers in Central Avenue was a huge arcade.

[51:46] And pinball was there, but it was never never had the volume that arcade machines had.

[51:51] There was probably 100 arcade machines, maybe 150 and maybe eight pinball machines.

[51:59] I think, you know, it makes sense though, because the pinball machines required more maintenance

[52:03] and they were more expensive.

[52:05] And also you couldn't hear a pinball machine in an old arcade.

[52:09] Yeah.

[52:10] So the video games were much easier to sort of get into and jump into.

[52:16] I think now it's all shifted in the sense that the barcades are opening up.

[52:22] I think pinball is becoming almost equally as popular as putting old arcade games into

[52:29] the barcade scene.

[52:31] And pinball leagues especially because you can have a pinball league.

[52:35] You can't have like a donkey con leagues in this back.

[52:38] You know, because it's too, you watch a guy play for like an hour, you know, on one credit.

[52:44] And the skills are different too, because if you're okay at pinball, you can play any

[52:50] pinball machine and be okay on that machine.

[52:53] But if you're okay on donkey con, asteroids might kick your butt.

[52:59] Yeah.

[53:00] And it's a different way of playing the machine and looking at it.

[53:04] It's true.

[53:05] And not only does it kick your butt, but it's just not even fun.

[53:09] I like people play like missile command and I'm like, I'd rather be poking my eyes out,

[53:15] but people love it.

[53:16] And I'm not saying it's not a good game, but it's just not my thing.

[53:19] But put me on street fighter too and I'm in heaven and those guys equally would probably

[53:23] hate playing street fighter.

[53:24] So I think it's a good point.

[53:27] All right, so $10,000, you're not in on something.

[53:31] Like Ghostbusters, medieval men, anything that like, what about the new stuff coming

[53:36] out of you following Ghostbusters or have you seen what's there in just reveal last

[53:40] week, what do you think of that?

[53:41] I did.

[53:42] And it's just sort of first impressions on the play field and the layout and the plastics.

[53:51] It's gorgeous.

[53:52] I don't know how it's going to play.

[53:55] It might just be a dog when you get to actually play it.

[53:58] But just looking at it, it's brilliant.

[54:01] It's colorful.

[54:03] There's some nice plastics and sets and stuff.

[54:05] I think it looks really cool.

[54:08] The other one that was Highway Pinballs, what the hell is the name of that racing game?

[54:17] Full throttle, is there?

[54:19] Yeah, it's their first game.

[54:21] They have that down at Nitro and with the LCD back glass on it.

[54:29] I would like to see a little bit more.

[54:32] And I'm sure when they revise the code, kind of get it more up to speed and stuff, the

[54:37] back glass will be a little bit more interesting when you're playing the game.

[54:41] But that's a really nice looking machine, too.

[54:44] It's like, you know, you just, on a cursory glance, you look at it and it's this gorgeous

[54:53] little thing behind glass and it's lovely and then all the lights and everything.

[55:00] It's quite nice.

[55:01] That game itself is a lot of fun.

[55:04] And I like what they're doing from from like an operator standpoint.

[55:07] I like what they're doing that you can swap out just the play field.

[55:13] And so it's going to be.

[55:15] Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see how, you know, if people do that because I've,

[55:21] I'm not, I'm not sure people will do that in the home co like the home collector world.

[55:27] But for the operator, it is great.

[55:28] I think the issue just becomes the operators.

[55:31] It's, you know, it's giving them the value with these new games where they'll jump in.

[55:37] You know, I think Stern is sort of is sort of hitting it out of the park with the operators

[55:41] with the pro models being the price threat and removing some of the features from the

[55:46] games that like as we were saying earlier, the casual new to pinball person won't even

[55:51] realize that there's not like magnetic sling shots on Ghostbusters Pro versus premium,

[55:57] right?

[55:58] The game is significantly cheaper for an operator to buy.

[56:02] Yeah.

[56:03] But yeah, you know, that's, that's, that's an interesting point because I've had this conversation

[56:07] before with what Stern is doing.

[56:09] And I, I don't know if the model is working really well for them when they come out with

[56:17] a new title and they've got, you know, three or four different variations of that title.

[56:22] I would almost rather see them put the energy into having the one title with maybe like

[56:29] two different versions and then coming out with another thing that is maybe, you know,

[56:33] not so glitzy and flashy, but just has that, goes back to the kind of the old style of,

[56:40] you know, here's this machine and you have this really kind of basic objective and it's

[56:44] not a deep rule set kind of game.

[56:47] So we get a little bit more variation and, and original themes too.

[56:50] Like, I think that's one of the things that I like about the full throttle machine is

[56:54] that it isn't based on a movie or a band or anything else.

[56:59] It's just, you know, it's a racing game.

[57:01] Right.

[57:02] That's kind of, that's what's lacking because everything now is deemed after something

[57:06] that already exists.

[57:07] Well, I think, I think, yeah, it comes down to and, and it's marketing, right?

[57:12] And marketing is my, my background is, is, they can, when you throw a license, pan

[57:18] up there, it immediately attracts attention because of the property.

[57:21] But to your point, I think what's interesting and what's, what is definitely missing from

[57:25] Pimbal these days is, you know, why can't someone make like a two to three thousand dollar

[57:32] simple pen that is original and IP is fun as hell to put on location and, and, and

[57:41] fair noobies.

[57:42] Yeah, and exactly.

[57:43] It's like, it's like an entry level pen for people.

[57:45] I think, you know, Stern tried that unsuccessfully with, well, I think they called it the pen.

[57:51] It was like the Transformers.

[57:53] When they made it, it was like, everything was just dialed out of it.

[57:56] Like the back box was just simple.

[57:58] It didn't have like a traditional cabinet.

[58:00] I think the play field was the same size as, as the normal one.

[58:04] But it just didn't look right.

[58:05] It looked, it looked like something, almost you'd find it toys or us.

[58:07] It just didn't seem.

[58:10] But I agree.

[58:11] I think that the collector market is definitely driving the R&D and the development of new pens

[58:20] because it all honesty, like right, we all agree, the collectors are the lion share of

[58:26] the money now.

[58:28] It's not coming from on location or operators.

[58:32] And there's, you know, there's just so many Pimbal machines that are available to operators

[58:38] to put on location.

[58:40] And, you know, I have to say too, like, I think there are operators out there that just don't

[58:45] care about the conditions of the machine.

[58:47] And they don't, and that's a shame because I do hate when I go on location and I'm playing

[58:52] like a machine and it just beat the hell.

[58:54] And I feel like I got robbed and they just took my dollar or whatever and then just leave

[59:00] the sour experience.

[59:01] So, and you're going for an hourly rate, right, seven that someone's going to come in

[59:06] and pay per hour to sort of jump on the machines and have a good time.

[59:10] No, it'll be one price you're in the door and that's the price you pay as long as you

[59:15] want to say.

[59:16] Oh, okay.

[59:17] The one thing that I'm going to have to work out is, and I think that I'm going to try

[59:23] to do something like what we used to do ourselves in the older arcades is if you wanted to play

[59:29] the machine next, you put your quarter on the glass, right?

[59:33] And it's like, okay, I'm next here.

[59:36] But you can't really do that if it's a, you know, everything set to free play.

[59:41] So I'll have to come up with a method like that because you will have one or two people

[59:46] that will come in and they just will play that game all damn day.

[59:50] And that's the only one they want to play that day and they're going to play it all day.

[59:53] But there has to be some sort of like, you know, excuse me, I'd like to butt in and play

[59:58] a game next kind of thing.

[01:00:00] I mean, you're going to get those guys.

[01:00:02] You need to have like showers required to for people who come in and get those guys who

[01:00:07] just like stay all day long and don't leave.

[01:00:11] And do you know what?

[01:00:13] Like you're going to charge for that kind of model.

[01:00:14] Like, well, how do you do the, how do you put up a business plan or figure out like the

[01:00:20] net net on a business like that where it's one time through the door?

[01:00:25] We expect this many guests.

[01:00:27] Is it just, we'll see as we go.

[01:00:29] We'll start with this and then see how it goes from there.

[01:00:31] We might have to make adjustments.

[01:00:33] I want to, I want to shoot for somewhere around the $15 range.

[01:00:36] Okay.

[01:00:37] If I can hit that and actually to sort of steal a little bit more from the Seattle Pinball

[01:00:43] Museums model is that they have one price to get in the door, which I don't remember how

[01:00:48] much it is.

[01:00:49] But then for a few bucks more, you have in and out privileges.

[01:00:52] Okay.

[01:00:53] Which is nice because then you can go down and, and you know, go down there and you

[01:00:58] say three o'clock and play for a couple hours to go out, get a bite and come back and you

[01:01:04] don't have to pay more to get in, right?

[01:01:07] And, and on a business side of things too, there's going to be those people that they pay

[01:01:11] the in-home price and they go outside and smoke a cigarette and come back in.

[01:01:17] And that's it.

[01:01:18] You know, that's their in-an-own is just that they can go out and have a smoke.

[01:01:21] So you get a couple bucks more on them for that.

[01:01:24] I would like to hit somewhere on the $15 mark, but a lot of it is going to depend on how

[01:01:32] many hours I'm going to be open a week and what my overhead is going to be.

[01:01:37] And so that if I can get a big cheap space, you know, I might be able to get away with

[01:01:42] doing ten bucks an hour or ten bucks entry fee or something like that.

[01:01:48] I've sat down and I've kind of done some basic numbers of what I can expect and what

[01:01:55] I know and things like that.

[01:01:57] And I think I can make it work with some of the basic models I've come up with for around

[01:02:03] 15.

[01:02:04] Okay.

[01:02:05] That's not bad at all.

[01:02:07] I mean, I when I hear New York City to give you some references on the places here, so

[01:02:14] the modern pinball does it by the hour.

[01:02:17] And if you don't know, modern pinball is some third avenue in 26th Street in New York

[01:02:21] City and they have about, I want to say, 25 to 30 pinball machines in there.

[01:02:26] And it's 12 bucks for an hour.

[01:02:31] And they're pretty lenient, like you can kind of lolly-yag and make it an hour and a half

[01:02:35] without them tapping you, but eventually they'll come for and get it.

[01:02:38] How did they track it?

[01:02:42] It's interesting because when they first started, I've been going there for a couple years.

[01:02:47] They used to give you wristbands and that's how they did it.

[01:02:51] Now they don't even do that.

[01:02:53] I think it's never too crowded.

[01:02:59] They have league nights where it gets much more crowded.

[01:03:04] But I think they just sort of eyeball and the guys who work there sort of know the regular.

[01:03:09] So I think that makes it easier for them.

[01:03:11] So they're probably much more aware of the regular crowd versus the new crowd.

[01:03:17] I also think too, for the newbies, for the people who walk by, and I see people walking

[01:03:24] by, they're on their first date or they want to just use something different for the night,

[01:03:28] people love to jump in and play pinball.

[01:03:31] But after an hour and a half, I think people get their fill and they're ready to move

[01:03:34] on.

[01:03:35] It's entertainment and people are like 80D and they jump around.

[01:03:41] So I think they do it that way.

[01:03:44] And then Sunshine in Brooklyn, which is the laundromat that he recently just opened up a

[01:03:50] wine and beer bar in the back area that also houses all the pinball machines.

[01:03:55] It's really cool.

[01:03:56] It's like this diving laundromat and then you open up this door and you're in this arcade

[01:04:01] with 30 of the most popular machines.

[01:04:04] I mean, he's got everything from like a trinally next to a big bang bar next to a circus

[01:04:08] full tear and probably like $250,000 worth of machines.

[01:04:12] And he does it a dollar machine and then it's two, I think it's, or 75 cents a machine

[01:04:20] and like the big bang bar is a dollar.

[01:04:23] But I'll say this, spending an hour there, I spend 20 bucks easily.

[01:04:31] And I do agree that I never really get to learn the games unless I want to sit there

[01:04:40] and pump like 30 bucks into trinally in a row.

[01:04:45] So I think your model is definitely going to be great and well appreciated for people

[01:04:49] who are like learning machines and also for people who just want to get their feet wet

[01:04:52] with pinball.

[01:04:53] But it probably will be a thing as you see as you go, like what your traffic is like.

[01:05:00] Or you get like happy hour.

[01:05:03] So if you come in on Thursday night, then it's a little bit cheaper kind of thing.

[01:05:07] Or I kind of fill around with stuff like that.

[01:05:09] And so maybe monthly pass is the people who are the regulars who just want to keep coming

[01:05:13] in.

[01:05:14] But yeah, yeah.

[01:05:15] I mean, there's a lot of different things that you can play with.

[01:05:18] You know, buy four nights for the price of three and you get a punch card or something

[01:05:23] or you know, I'll say different things.

[01:05:26] I'll say this to you what I see modern does a lot of because they're not a bar is they

[01:05:31] do a lot of birthday parties for young kids that seems to be doing really well for them.

[01:05:37] Right.

[01:05:38] Because that's not something that the bar kids can accommodate.

[01:05:41] And I do think that I'll see some of that is that there will be probably people that

[01:05:46] want to book it for the night or something for a corporate event or something like that.

[01:05:53] Vancouver and I'm not like this is a wishful thinking or I don't know, but Vancouver is

[01:06:00] a huge film town.

[01:06:02] There's there's a filming going on all the time around here because they come up from

[01:06:07] the States.

[01:06:08] It's a little bit cheaper.

[01:06:10] Our skies are overcast so there's no deep shadows.

[01:06:15] And we sort of promote the film industry.

[01:06:19] And so I don't I don't have any doubt that at one point someone's going to tap me and say,

[01:06:23] hey, we'd like to use your shop for a couple of days for filming, you know, something.

[01:06:27] Yeah, definitely.

[01:06:29] You know what you do?

[01:06:30] I take a pitch from my book, just throw a bed inside it at night and Airbnb it.

[01:06:34] There you go.

[01:06:36] I was before my co-op board shut me down.

[01:06:39] I was getting 500 bucks a night for people to stay in this apartment.

[01:06:43] Yeah, maybe I can arrange that for like Monday and Tuesday nights or something.

[01:06:48] Yeah, so let me close anyway.

[01:06:49] I'm in my little stadium.

[01:06:50] Exactly.

[01:06:51] Just call it like the pinball pen house.

[01:06:53] It's on the ground floor and you have 25 machines in the bed.

[01:06:58] Well, seven, this has been great.

[01:06:59] I really enjoyed our conversation tonight and I really think that for the listeners out

[01:07:04] there, this is what people love.

[01:07:06] They love to see people putting pinball out into the world, encouraging new people to

[01:07:11] play, broadening pinball's audience and celebrating games of all errors.

[01:07:18] I am self-proclaimed, not that knowledgeable of older games but this is why I love talking

[01:07:24] to guys like you to sort of get more of a knowledge of that and to support projects like

[01:07:30] you have going on.

[01:07:31] So I want to thank you and we'll definitely check back in to see how pinball ram is coming

[01:07:35] along so we can follow its progress.

[01:07:38] Fantastic.

[01:07:39] Great.

[01:07:40] Awesome.

[01:07:41] Thanks for having me.

[01:07:42] Yep, and we'll talk real soon.

[01:07:43] And for listeners out there, for you guys with collections where you have games that are

[01:07:46] just sitting there, that you haven't played, get this, send them to seven and get this

[01:07:52] thing open.

[01:07:53] You should feel guilty.

[01:07:55] You're just hoarding these machines.

[01:07:56] We know you don't play them.

[01:07:58] I've actually considered the idea of having it, there are people that I know that have

[01:08:04] machines that are on end and storage and if you put the machine in my shop, you own

[01:08:11] it, but then you get a free pass, you can come in and play whatever you want.

[01:08:14] There you go.

[01:08:15] It works better.

[01:08:16] Yeah.

[01:08:17] Win win.

[01:08:18] All right, seven, thank you so much.

[01:08:21] Have a great night and we will talk to you real soon.

[01:08:24] Right on.

[01:08:25] All right.

[01:08:26] See you later, man.

[01:08:27] All right, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes Canadian pinball podcast episode.

[01:08:33] I believe 22.

[01:08:35] And I will be in Texas by the time most of you guys hear this.
