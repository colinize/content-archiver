[00:00] I'll save, I'll save, I'll save, I'll save, I'll save, I'll save!

[00:04] Am I allowed to make advertisements for my own show?

[00:08] Is that the most narcissistic behaviour?

[00:10] Well, the man behind the paywall can aided himself with 596 free Pinball podcasts?

[00:17] I want to give some of you out there just a little sample of the kinds of episodes that are happening on the Canadian Club.

[00:23] And it's super easy to join the Club episode 5 went up today

[00:27] And I wanted to give the rest of you out there,

[00:30] just a little sneak peek at the kind of conversation

[00:32] happening on the Canadian Club this morning.

[00:35] It's called spooky pinball making people excited

[00:38] and delusional.

[00:40] And it's a good one.

[00:41] And if you wanna join the club, the good news is this.

[00:43] You get access to all of the exclusive content

[00:46] that is put up on the Canadian Club.

[00:48] So if you join today, you will get episode one through five.

[00:51] And we're gonna do it like that.

[00:53] And I love that this drives everybody crazy out there

[00:56] who hates Canada so much that he's doing this

[00:58] because you know what?

[00:59] We ain't hiding behind no paywall,

[01:01] but we're gonna have exclusive treats for those of you

[01:04] who contribute to Canada's pinball podcast.

[01:06] Take it away, Canada.

[01:08] Even myself, I find myself sort of pulled into the excitement.

[01:13] I get pulled into the FOMO.

[01:15] Like what have I always said?

[01:17] By a theme you love.

[01:18] How many of you love both of these themes?

[01:20] Probably not.

[01:21] So then you wanna support a company you love

[01:23] which is spooky and I get that.

[01:25] But then you ask like, do you love this game?

[01:27] Like have you played this game

[01:29] and do you know you love it?

[01:30] And the answer that everyone can give is just,

[01:32] I don't know.

[01:33] It's just kind of exhausting to see it always unfold this way.

[01:37] It's great for these pinball companies,

[01:38] but as a consumer it's a little bit exhausting.

[01:41] That everything we do is a gamble.

[01:43] That every purchase we make is a risk.

[01:45] We don't know we actually want the game.

[01:47] We know we want pinball,

[01:49] but we ultimately talk ourselves in to buying these games.

[01:52] So this is where we're at.

[01:53] This is where we're at.

[01:54] It's like, old Troman is now an instant sellout.

[01:57] I can't believe people are saying this.

[01:59] I can't believe they're saying this.

[02:01] It's a title nobody wanted 24 hours ago

[02:05] and now it's an instant sellout.

[02:07] Think about that for a minute.

[02:08] Think about the ridiculousness of this hobby we're in

[02:11] that people are now saying that.

[02:13] And where's the other voice?

[02:15] I'm just trying to be the other side of the coin here

[02:17] which is like, come on people.

[02:18] Like this is not instant sellout themes.

[02:22] If this sells out, it doesn't mean

[02:24] they got the right theme.

[02:25] It means the market is just starving for something.

[02:29] And if it sells out, it also shows

[02:32] what a colossal failure American pinball

[02:35] and deep root have been that they can't create this

[02:37] with their titles.

[02:39] Oh, that was just a little, little sneak peek

[02:41] at episode five of the Canadian Club.

[02:43] Everybody have a good day, exciting day tomorrow

[02:45] when spooky pinball opens the order banks

[02:48] for Halloween and for Ultraman.

[02:52] Now I wanna also clarify that I got the date wrong

[02:55] on my last show.

[02:56] The order banks open tomorrow at 9 a.m. Central Standard Time.

[03:02] That is Wednesday tomorrow.

[03:04] Let's see how these games sell.

[03:05] Have a good day everybody.
