[00:00] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Canatus Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcaster on

[00:23] Planet Earth.

[00:24] Who doesn't own a single pinball machine?

[00:27] We're going to talk a little bit about that ridiculous threat.

[00:30] But here's what I want to do on this episode of Canatus Pinball Podcast.

[00:34] I want to go back and talk a little bit about ordering Rick and Morty and where I think

[00:40] there might be some confusion and how this whole thing is going to play out and talk a little

[00:45] bit about that.

[00:46] Because I still don't think there's tons of clarity in the community around how this

[00:52] game is supposed to be ordered by the fans of the show and pinball.

[00:57] Talk a little bit about a Vira.

[00:59] A game that just seems to be fading off into the distance.

[01:05] This happens every once in a while.

[01:07] A game comes out, came out pretty recently, and all of a sudden it's like we've skipped

[01:12] over it.

[01:13] It's like we're jumping from Lily Pad to Lily Pad of which game to get excited about.

[01:18] This one just seems to be one that we're beginning to forget quickly.

[01:23] Wasn't a cornerstone game.

[01:24] Remember we all knew that.

[01:26] This was not one of Stern's big releases and it's pretty much shaping up that way in

[01:31] the community.

[01:32] What else is going on in the pinball world we want to talk about?

[01:35] Let's start there.

[01:36] The other thing I want to do on this episode, I didn't tell you what I wrote in for my

[01:42] Twippy submissions.

[01:44] Okay.

[01:45] Now it's Twippy season apparently and people I want to talk.

[01:48] Let's start there.

[01:49] Let's start with this notion that it's Twippy season and podcasters and pinball personalities.

[01:55] Now all of a sudden have to change the way they operate because they want to get Twippy

[02:01] votes.

[02:02] I think it's ridiculous.

[02:03] Here's what I want to say about this whole thing.

[02:05] I hear other pinball podcasters talking about how it's lame that they think people want

[02:09] support.

[02:10] And I just want to say for the record, if you've been a part of the award show at Texas

[02:16] pinball festival known as the Twippies, it is nothing more than celebrating and enjoying

[02:23] and recognizing all of those people out there who put their creative energy into pinball.

[02:30] That's all it is.

[02:31] It's not a pissing match.

[02:33] It's not a competition mud slinging contest.

[02:36] We're not doing you negative political ads to get people's votes.

[02:40] It's just a moment in which we recognize the best of what happened in pinball the year

[02:46] prior.

[02:47] Now, obviously some categories are easy to see who's going to win.

[02:51] It's a runaway foregone conclusion that Jurassic Park is going to win the best game at the

[02:57] Twippy.

[02:58] There's no way.

[02:59] Nothing can beat it, right?

[03:01] There are some categories obviously where it is a popularity contest between personalities.

[03:07] Not all of it is a popularity contest.

[03:10] People know that it's really hard for a Jersey Jack game to ever win best game of the year

[03:17] because there's nowhere near the amount of people who buy Jersey Jack games that buy

[03:23] Stern games.

[03:24] There's just way more fans of a Stern title that's a hit.

[03:28] That's just the way it goes.

[03:32] As I said on my Facebook page, who amongst us out there that makes anything pinball related,

[03:39] whether it's a podcast or a game or piece of artwork or a streaming show who doesn't

[03:44] want to be popular, who doesn't want people to look at what we create and get excited

[03:50] by it?

[03:51] That's all it is.

[03:53] That's all it is.

[03:54] It's a moment in which we recognize those people.

[03:57] I think it's lame.

[03:59] I think the lame people are the salty people, the people who complain that people are excited

[04:06] about being recognized or the chance of being recognized within the industry.

[04:12] You hear it.

[04:13] You hear it.

[04:14] They always do the same approach.

[04:15] They always say stuff like, I think it's pretty pathetic that people are asking for support.

[04:21] We would love to be honored ourselves.

[04:23] Which one is it?

[04:25] Would you love to be honored yourself or would you want or would you just want to call

[04:29] everyone lame?

[04:30] I mean, we've seen the way this thing unfolds.

[04:33] I think personally that anyone who spends a lot of time doing anything in this hobby,

[04:42] of course they want to be recognized for their efforts.

[04:44] Of course they do.

[04:46] Look, we're all winners because here's why we're all winners.

[04:50] In the real world, we're all the losers.

[04:52] Everyone out there who's not into pinball, thinks anyone who geeks out over pinball.

[04:58] Guess what they think we are.

[04:59] They think we're losers.

[05:02] We are a bunch of nerds and losers in the corner geeking out.

[05:06] 38 pages on Rick and Morty and no one's even seen a game.

[05:10] That's called a being a loser.

[05:13] And I love being a pinball loser.

[05:16] Maybe I should call this loser kid pinball podcast.

[05:19] No, I love the show.

[05:20] I love the show.

[05:21] Okay, so here's what I want to do.

[05:23] Here's what I want to do.

[05:25] First let me talk about the guy who said because I don't currently own a machine that I

[05:30] am a pinball fraud that I can't talk to you about pinball.

[05:34] Now everyone realizes that guy is just one jackass.

[05:37] Someone was like, do a pinside baby's episode about that guy.

[05:40] I'm not going to waste my time and energy on one guy who nobody agrees with.

[05:45] I mean, come on.

[05:47] All of what we do in life when we give our opinion about things.

[05:51] It doesn't mean we have to own something to have an opinion, right?

[05:54] You don't have to own a sports team to talk sports.

[05:57] You don't have to own a movie theater to talk movies.

[05:59] You don't have to own a car to give your opinion about a car.

[06:03] And I own pinball machines.

[06:04] It's funny to me because I'm staring right now.

[06:06] I still have Batman.

[06:08] It hasn't been picked up yet.

[06:10] I'm replacing this game with another machine.

[06:13] I've owned Batman 66.

[06:15] I've owned Lord of the Rings, Tails of the Arabian Knights, and Magic Girl.

[06:20] I would say about two or three of those games are some of the best pinball machines ever made.

[06:25] And I have access to almost every single pinball machine you can think of in New York City.

[06:29] So I think I play enough pinball.

[06:32] I think I know enough about the hobby.

[06:33] And you know me, this podcast is not about like pinball strategy.

[06:38] This podcast is about just what's going on in the pinball hobby in a contemporary sense.

[06:43] I mean, we cover new games.

[06:46] We cover what manufacturers are doing.

[06:48] We cover play field issues.

[06:50] We cover world under glass magic.

[06:52] Are we getting it?

[06:53] Are we not?

[06:54] Is El Vier worth $15,000?

[06:55] It's just the debate that's going on in the hobby.

[06:58] And I'll say this.

[06:59] I'll say this.

[07:00] I was telling this to Brenda.

[07:01] I bet you.

[07:03] I can still maintain the entertainment value of this podcast without doing two things, without

[07:09] ever owning a pinball machine in 2020.

[07:12] And here's the kicker.

[07:13] Without even playing one, probably in 2020, because with all the streamers out there and

[07:19] all the people giving their feedback, I could just find a few streamers that I trust their

[07:24] opinions on a game.

[07:26] And I could go off of what they say to formulate an opinion about the game.

[07:30] You could do that.

[07:31] I mean, I don't get to drive Lamborghinis and Ferraris and McLaren's and Porsche's around

[07:36] a track.

[07:37] But you know, a car and driver like Randy Brandy over at Car and Driver does it all the

[07:41] time on and I trust his opinion because he's a professional race car driver.

[07:45] And there are like basically professional pinball players out there who give us their opinions

[07:49] and we trust them and they have credibility.

[07:52] But anyway, I'm going to play pinball machines.

[07:53] I mean, don't get me wrong.

[07:55] I'm not going to spend an entire year and not flip a game.

[07:58] Oh man, people are weird.

[08:00] People are salty.

[08:01] People are negative.

[08:02] It just takes one bad apple, right, to create a stupid thread.

[08:06] But anyway, anyway, let's talk.

[08:09] Let's talk about Rick and Morty because this game is upon us.

[08:16] It's going to be shown.

[08:17] I believe I think we're going to see stuff over the weekend.

[08:21] I think the games are going to go up for sale on Monday or Tuesday.

[08:24] So get ready to pull the trigger.

[08:26] I've been, you know, all of us are on the same boat.

[08:28] Like some of some of you are like me.

[08:31] You're watching Rick and Morty for the first time and it's a little bit weird to watch

[08:36] it under this pretense or this context.

[08:39] I'll tell you why.

[08:40] I am watching the show, wanting to love it so much because I really want to click with

[08:48] it.

[08:49] So then I know there's going to be a pinball machine available in a few days.

[08:53] And if I love the show and the pinball machine becomes available, it's like a win-win.

[08:58] It's a little weird to watch something wanting to like it so much.

[09:03] I really am enjoying it.

[09:05] But I don't think I'm like it's not blowing me away in the first like five episodes

[09:10] of the show.

[09:11] I mean, I get the humor.

[09:12] I get what they're going for.

[09:14] I think it's going to be a really fun pinball machine.

[09:17] So there's that part of it, right?

[09:19] I'm catching up.

[09:20] So I don't have like, I haven't watched this show since 2010.

[09:23] I don't have like four seasons of like episodes in my mind and I'm not, I don't dream about

[09:29] it.

[09:30] I don't think about it like other dream themes, right?

[09:31] Is that the whole point of a dream theme?

[09:34] It's like a movie or a property you often dream about.

[09:37] I can honestly say that Rick and Morty is not something I've dreamt about.

[09:42] Okay.

[09:43] I mean, now I just dreaming about seeing the next few episodes and see what's up with

[09:46] that.

[09:47] Okay.

[09:48] So there's that going on.

[09:49] All right.

[09:50] The other part is this.

[09:51] I mean, we've seen nothing.

[09:53] We've seen nothing.

[09:54] I hear rumors about the layout and what could be in the game.

[09:58] We just have to see it.

[10:00] But you know what?

[10:01] I think the real takeaway is this.

[10:03] There's more in, there's more energy.

[10:08] There's more activity.

[10:10] There's more excitement in a Rick and Morty thread in which we've seen nothing about

[10:15] the game.

[10:17] Then there is in like the black night thread or the dialed in thread or the, you know what

[10:22] I'm saying?

[10:23] There's like, it just goes to show when you have a theme that's really exciting.

[10:28] It just blows up and people are already writing checks for something they've never

[10:33] seen.

[10:34] So that's just like, if you're a manufacturer, if you're American Pimball and you're watching

[10:40] this, how do you not call a little huddle in the conference room and be like, hey, is

[10:45] our next theme going to create this kind of excitement?

[10:47] And hey, how did spooky Pimball, a company that's smaller than us?

[10:51] Let's think about that for a minute.

[10:53] Spooky Pimball, a company that is smaller than American Pimball.

[10:56] How did they land a title like this that is getting so much excitement?

[11:00] And then if I'm Davao, I'm like, well, what are we doing?

[11:04] What's our marketing strategy?

[11:05] What's our next theme?

[11:07] How calm they were able to do it?

[11:09] I saw, I heard this.

[11:10] I'm not sure if it's true.

[11:11] I heard that somebody posted a Rick and Morty thing on a George Gomez post on Facebook

[11:17] and I think he like deleted it or unfriended the guy.

[11:20] I'm not sure which one it was.

[11:22] It's not confirmed.

[11:24] But you know, that's what happens, right?

[11:25] You get these rumors.

[11:26] Like, Stern's so angry.

[11:27] I don't know.

[11:28] Well, you know, look, Stern must be looking at this being like, yeah, we probably should

[11:34] have made Rick and Morty.

[11:35] You know, but look, I think it's being made by the right people.

[11:39] So we don't know what the game is.

[11:42] Now here's the real confusing part.

[11:44] And I don't even get this.

[11:45] I still don't get this.

[11:46] I'm on the thread and people are like sharing the number that they are in the fang club

[11:51] and trying to understand how it all works.

[11:56] And I don't think anyone is crystal clear on how this works.

[12:02] Okay, here's my guess.

[12:04] And I've heard what Charlie said.

[12:06] I hear what people say on the forums.

[12:08] I just think it's a little confusing.

[12:11] And I never, you know, me, I never like there to be confusion at a moment like this,

[12:17] at a moment in which you're asking people to spend money.

[12:20] I don't know if confusion is like the desired outcome.

[12:24] Okay.

[12:25] So if you're a fang club member, you've signed up and you've spent $45 to get two weeks

[12:31] early access to the game.

[12:34] Okay.

[12:35] Now what does that mean?

[12:36] Does that mean you get to buy the game before distributors get to sell the game to people

[12:43] on their list?

[12:44] See, I, that's where I'm confused because I think games are still allocated to distributors.

[12:52] So let's say spooky just hypothetically as five distributors.

[12:55] Are they each getting a hundred games?

[12:58] And so then there are only 250 available to order through spooky directly.

[13:06] Now here's the other, here's where it gets even more confusing for me.

[13:10] So I don't think that means that you won't get access to a game.

[13:13] So let's say you're a fang club member and you buy a game.

[13:17] It's ostensibly spooky.

[13:18] You could just say, okay, great.

[13:20] You bought this game.

[13:21] The game that you bought has been allocated to let's say Joe Newhart at Pimball Star.

[13:26] So your game will be bought through him.

[13:28] I mean, is that how it's going to work?

[13:30] I don't know how, you know what I'm saying?

[13:31] It's just, it's a little confusing.

[13:33] And then everyone who has early access has the decision on whether or not they want to

[13:38] upgrade their game to the blood sucker edition, which is a $15,000 or $15,000 $25.

[13:46] Sorry, no.

[13:47] $15,000 and $25,000, non-refundable deposit, okay?

[13:53] Okay, so now from there, how do you know what number you are in the order?

[13:58] Like how is this going to happen?

[13:59] Is it going to be first through the door?

[14:01] And then when is that going to happen?

[14:04] Like we don't know.

[14:05] So you basically knowing that if you're within the first 50 to 100 games, like you're going

[14:11] to be excited because you're going to get your game, you know, in the first few months.

[14:16] But man, you could be a year and a half later to get your game.

[14:20] And so I'm not quite sure how people know how to line up.

[14:24] I'm not quite sure people know how to get a low number.

[14:28] You know, I was talking to a friend today and I said, look, I mean, not for nothing.

[14:33] But if you're within the first 50 games, your game immediately is worth a thousand to

[14:38] $2,000 more.

[14:40] Because if some dudes at number 748, I bet you, he would like much rather if he's got

[14:46] means and money and wants the game now, he would buy your early slot off of you.

[14:51] So all those people with early slots, I think, are sitting on easily more expensive games

[14:57] than the ones that come later on down the line.

[15:00] All this though, all this is predicated and I'm glad I'm glad my boy Ken Cromwell over

[15:05] at Special One let's said this.

[15:07] All this is predicated on if the game is any good.

[15:09] Is it not?

[15:10] It doesn't have to be good.

[15:12] It doesn't have to be a great flipping game or will the hype leave the building immediately?

[15:21] I mean, to say that people are ahead of themselves with this game is an understatement like no other.

[15:26] I don't think I've ever seen sort of like a hype for a game that we've known nothing

[15:32] about.

[15:33] I mean, even when we saw Ghostbusters was a rumored title, we already had the leaks around

[15:38] the artwork and around like the play field CAD designs for that game.

[15:43] This game, nothing, nothing.

[15:45] And here's a crazy part, is Stranger Things is a more popular theme.

[15:50] I see some people debating this.

[15:52] It's not even close.

[15:53] We know Stranger Things is coming out as well, but that thread's not blowing up.

[15:57] It's amazing what confirmation of a theme being made will do to get people going crazy.

[16:03] I mean, people are going nuts for spooky pinball, Scott and E.C. game and the Stranger Things

[16:10] with Brian Eddie, not nearly as much excitement.

[16:15] And that's a little bit of a head scratcher for me.

[16:17] If I'm just to be honest, I mean, Scott's brand new.

[16:22] I hope people manage their expectations of what's the come ad of spooky pinball.

[16:28] And they've made every game better and better.

[16:31] So part of me reads some of these people and it's like, I think some people are expecting

[16:35] like Jersey Jack level complexity to the game, like the actual gameplay itself.

[16:41] Are Ken Spooky make that kind of leap?

[16:44] I don't think it's going to be nearly sort of as complex and mechanically, you know,

[16:51] so much in the game that we've seen with other manufacturers.

[16:53] I don't think they're there yet.

[16:57] And I don't think that means it's not going to be a super fun game.

[16:59] I don't think it doesn't mean it's not going to be Spooky's best game to date.

[17:03] But Brian Eddie, man, it's like this guy is like the king of like putting some of the

[17:08] best mix ever and making some of the best pinball ever.

[17:11] And it's sort of like maybe this is a sign of the times that we are more excited about

[17:17] young designers making a name for themselves than we are about the old designers coming

[17:24] back.

[17:25] Because I think everyone probably feels a little bit like there is no way Stern pinball

[17:30] is going to allow Brian Eddie to have the kind of resources and bomb that he had back

[17:37] in the Valley Williams days.

[17:38] No way, no way.

[17:40] But maybe they do.

[17:41] Right?

[17:42] It's like, who knows?

[17:43] Who knows?

[17:44] Like, we'll have to wait till we see it all.

[17:45] Alright, so there's confusion on how to buy it.

[17:47] I think we're all going to find out early next week.

[17:51] Well, I don't think anyone's going to get locked out of this title though.

[17:55] 750 over 18 months.

[17:59] You will be able to get one.

[18:02] People will want to get out of their spots and you will see people transfer spots.

[18:08] It's a really long time to wait.

[18:11] We've never seen anyone ever in the history of pinball.

[18:15] Think about it.

[18:16] In the history of pinball, no one has ever gone in and bought a game in which they knew

[18:23] on the day they bought the game that the wait for them to get it would be a year or 18 months.

[18:31] Never happened before.

[18:32] Now it's happened without people's knowledge when they bought stuff like the big Lebowski

[18:38] or Pirate to the Caribbean.

[18:40] Heck, even Willy Wonka collectors edition people had to wait like eight months to get their

[18:44] game.

[18:45] But they didn't think it was going to be that long because every manufacturer out there

[18:50] knows that the window in which you take people's money and the window in which you actually

[18:56] ship people a game needs to be a small window because people lose interest.

[19:02] The hobby moves on to the next shiny toy.

[19:05] I mean, that's why Robert Mueller is telling people when you order a deep-roo game you're

[19:09] going to have it in two weeks.

[19:10] He didn't say two months or six months or eight months.

[19:13] He said two weeks.

[19:14] I don't know how he's going to do that, but that's what he promised.

[19:18] So will this work?

[19:20] It's going to look, this is an experiment and spooky pinball.

[19:24] Here's where I think they're smart.

[19:25] I mean, this is crazy when you think about it.

[19:28] How many people are signing up for this fang club?

[19:31] Let's just say 500 people signed up for the fang club.

[19:36] They just made like $20, like $2,000 over a period of a week and a half just by announcing

[19:44] a theme.

[19:45] That's incredible.

[19:47] Now I get to have to give them some goodie bag and they're sending us some swag.

[19:52] But man, oh man, oh man, what a smart way to let people through the door.

[19:56] I mean, if I'm stern pinball and I'm watching this happen, I'm like, wait a minute.

[20:00] We can actually make money in another way.

[20:04] We could actually charge people to be able to buy our L.E.s first.

[20:10] Why don't we do that?

[20:12] Instead of the system we have right now, I mean, stern, hey, Zach Sharp, you could do

[20:17] another thing like this and you could easily measure against the revenue you're generating.

[20:24] So when you do stranger things, L.E.s, why not make it that the stern insiders have first

[20:30] access to buying them?

[20:32] You would sell 500 or 1,000 insiders subscriptions immediately and you could charge more for those

[20:39] insiders subscriptions.

[20:40] Canada, what are you doing?

[20:42] Why are you giving stern more ideas on how to make more money and screw us over?

[20:46] I know.

[20:47] I need to stop.

[20:49] If it wasn't for me, they wouldn't be selling $15,000 L.E. virus.

[20:53] But you guys have the power not to buy this crap.

[20:56] Anyway, all right.

[20:58] All right.

[20:59] Well, speaking of L.E. virus, the title that just seems to be fading into the background.

[21:04] Now look, it's not that I think L.E. virus is not a good game.

[21:07] I haven't even played the game.

[21:09] Here we are.

[21:10] Here's the Canada Pinball podcast fraud.

[21:11] He's a fraud.

[21:12] He's a fraud.

[21:13] He hasn't played the game and he can't say anything on it.

[21:16] I'm not here to tell you about the game itself in terms of like gameplay.

[21:19] I'm here.

[21:20] Here's what I'm here to tell you though.

[21:21] I don't need to have a game to know that this game is having like a lot of issues out

[21:28] of the box.

[21:29] And if you go on the thread and you read the thread, I mean most of the L.E. virus

[21:33] thread has been troubleshooting post by people.

[21:37] And that's troublesome and I'll explain why because this is an expensive game from

[21:41] Stern Pinball.

[21:43] And the more you spend on something, I think the greater quality you expect in it.

[21:48] And I'm just not seeing that in this game.

[21:51] And there's a few things that people are talking about that hasn't really been covered.

[21:56] One of which is the clear coat on this game.

[21:59] People are saying it's thinner.

[22:01] Now the whole play field clear coat issue, it's conveniently just gone away.

[22:07] People have stopped talking about it.

[22:08] No one really got a solution.

[22:10] You know, we're weird.

[22:12] We're a weird community.

[22:13] We're a weird hobby.

[22:15] This was a huge issue.

[22:16] This was affecting so many games.

[22:18] We never ever got communication on what the solve was.

[22:21] All we did collectively as a unit, as podcasters, as streamers, as everybody.

[22:26] We just said, well, I think they'll figure it out.

[22:28] And we just like went about our day.

[22:30] And then we started buying $10,000 or $15,000 machines.

[22:34] And people are saying the clear coat's thinner.

[22:36] All right, well, is that the solve?

[22:38] That they only have two layers of clear, not three now?

[22:41] So is that a fix?

[22:43] Or is that a band-aid on a problem?

[22:44] I don't know.

[22:45] But I'm just here to tell you that we'll see how these games hold up over time.

[22:49] I want to see what an LVY replay field looks like after 1,000 plays.

[22:54] Like, what's it going to look like?

[22:56] We'll see.

[22:56] We don't know yet.

[22:57] But other than that, there's just issues with the game.

[23:00] I mean, people are having stuff break.

[23:02] There's like missing washers.

[23:05] There's like decals that are poorly cut on the house.

[23:08] There just seems to be a lot of little issues with the game.

[23:12] Nothing major, nothing major.

[23:14] But more than your typical out-of-the-box issues, I would say.

[23:19] So I think for that reason, I think people are like, you know, I don't know.

[23:22] They're not running towards the game as much as maybe some people think LVYRA would create

[23:27] that kind of demand.

[23:28] It's a niche title.

[23:30] It's LVYRA.

[23:31] It's not a cornerstone.

[23:33] It's, here's what's crazy to me.

[23:35] Here's what's crazy to me.

[23:36] Is you take Lyman Sheets.

[23:38] You're best coder by far.

[23:40] I mean, not even close.

[23:41] You're best coder in the world.

[23:43] He's now working on LVYRA, a game that's not going to sell that many, okay?

[23:50] And I heard that the amount of clips he's going to put in this game,

[23:53] 4,000 clips from the different movies and stuff, right?

[23:58] And then you have Batman SLE, which, or sorry, just Batman 66,

[24:02] which has a ton of clips.

[24:04] And there's only 1,500 in Batman.

[24:06] So almost three times the amount of clips will be put into LVYRA.

[24:11] And my question is this, is the juice worth the squeeze here?

[24:17] And I'm not talking, you know, it's weird when you talk about a VYRA with that, right?

[24:20] If it's like, yes, absolutely it's a VYRA.

[24:21] No, you know what I mean though?

[24:23] Is all this effort for LVYRA worth it?

[24:26] And why does Stern allow Lyman?

[24:28] I get, he gets to pick what he wants.

[24:30] But why?

[24:32] Why aren't they making Lyman?

[24:35] And look, he's an employee of Stern Pimble.

[24:37] He's an employee.

[24:39] Why, it's not even like making him.

[24:40] Why don't they just convince him, like George, take him out for a nice meal?

[24:45] Why don't they align?

[24:47] Imagine this.

[24:48] Imagine this.

[24:49] Why isn't Lyman Sheets working on every Keith L.W.

[24:54] game?

[24:56] Why isn't Lyman Sheets working on the best designers games that Stern makes?

[25:01] Why is not Lyman Sheets working on the biggest properties that Stern has?

[25:07] I want him to code Ninja Turtles.

[25:10] I want him to code Stranger Things.

[25:12] I mean, who's even coding Stranger Things?

[25:15] You talk about working with assets and clips and how good Lyman is with it and he's doing

[25:21] this obscure title to the side.

[25:23] I think it's ludicrous.

[25:25] I don't understand it.

[25:27] I don't understand how you have Dwight Sullivan, which nothing personal Dwight, but people

[25:33] would say that he's not the best coder they have and you give him Star Wars.

[25:38] And maybe just because Steve Richie and Dwight are buddies, but I'm sorry.

[25:42] It's Star Wars.

[25:43] That IP deserved more.

[25:46] It deserved more and it didn't get it.

[25:49] So you know, I mean, and then it's like how long is Lyman going to be sitting on this

[25:54] title that's not even going to be a big sales hit.

[25:57] But here's a thing too.

[25:58] And this is why it's hard to look at these games in a vacuum because ultimately Stern

[26:04] doesn't care.

[26:06] They really, what I mean by that is this.

[26:08] They don't, not that they don't care.

[26:10] They don't mind the fact that Lyman's off doing that because in Stern's world, the only

[26:16] thing that really matters is that the line is moving and that they have games on the manufacturing

[26:22] line and that they have a development cycle where there's no delays and they just keep

[26:28] stuff moving because if you're Stern, you're like, all right, we got a virus on the line.

[26:33] Jurassic Park is a huge hit for us.

[26:35] We've got, we're still making monsters.

[26:36] We're still making Star Trek.

[26:37] We're still making Batman.

[26:38] We're still making, you know, whatever, all the games they're still making.

[26:41] And then we're going to throw stranger things on and that's going to be a jug or not.

[26:45] And then Ninja Turtles and that's going to be a jug or not.

[26:47] And then Godzilla and then this and then we're going to vault Tron or Lord of the Rings.

[26:51] And I'm saying, is George Gomez is looking at a development cycle of the next two to

[26:57] three years?

[26:59] And that's what they're staring at.

[27:01] This isn't like any other manufacturer out there where they need every game to be a hit.

[27:06] They need every game to have high volume.

[27:08] They need every game, you know, to be a winner.

[27:11] Then Jersey Jack needs that.

[27:14] Spooky needs that.

[27:15] Chicago gaming needs that.

[27:17] American Pimball needs that.

[27:19] Deep Root needs that.

[27:20] And Pimball doesn't need that.

[27:22] They only need like a quarter of their games to be jug or not.

[27:26] And that'll make up for any flops, right?

[27:29] I mean, monsters wasn't a sales jug or not.

[27:31] Was it?

[27:33] But Jurassic Park is.

[27:35] So you know what I'm saying?

[27:36] It's like, Stern looks at it like a portfolio of products in which if the overall portfolio

[27:41] performs well and even just look one title, one jug or not can lift up the revenue for

[27:48] the entire year.

[27:49] Why not?

[27:50] Why not hedge your bets?

[27:52] I mean, Stern is playing Pimball as if it's poker and they've got eight different hands

[27:57] they're playing at one time.

[27:59] And you know, all they've got to do is like see which hands are playing better and then

[28:04] go all in on them.

[28:06] And they're going to make money for years to come on these games.

[28:08] That's the other part too.

[28:09] It's like no other manufacturer can quite do what Stern does, which is you capture the hobbyist

[28:15] and the early adopters right away.

[28:18] Like if you love stranger things, they're going to get everyone their game in the first

[28:22] few months.

[28:23] And then they'll sell stranger things for years to people who have game rooms to new fans

[28:29] of the show, to people who walk into distributors across the world and want something fun.

[28:35] It'll be available.

[28:36] It'll be available.

[28:37] And that's, I mean, their model is incredible, incredibly successful doing it that way.

[28:43] All right?

[28:44] But a viral, I think it's just going to go down as another one of those like to me,

[28:48] like a virus in the same category as like monsters, you know, same category as like

[28:54] aero smith, same category as, you know, guardians of the galaxy.

[29:01] Like it had a little bit of hype.

[29:03] Never really is going to take off.

[29:06] And then a hotter title comes out close to it that just takes over people's, you know,

[29:12] intention.

[29:13] All right.

[29:14] Let's get to the twippies now as we end this episode of Canadian pinball podcast.

[29:19] And I didn't tell you guys like who I voted for, I think, in all of the different writing

[29:24] categories.

[29:25] And I want to do that right now and go down the list real quickly.

[29:30] And let's see.

[29:31] First one is this.

[29:32] And this is like my hardest one.

[29:34] And I'll tell you why.

[29:35] Favorite pinball streamer.

[29:36] All right.

[29:37] So favorite pinball streamer writing.

[29:40] So there are two people that I think are doing the best pinball streams right now.

[29:45] And that is Ken Cromwell and Jack Danger without a doubt.

[29:50] And they do it differently.

[29:51] Like there are two different types of streaming shows.

[29:54] And you know, Jack has his whole streaming facility.

[29:57] Jack's got like this incredible personnel.

[30:00] And I love Jack Danger.

[30:01] I just love it.

[30:02] I think he's so good for pinball.

[30:03] I also love the Monday night streaming sessions that Ken does as well.

[30:08] The flipping out streams.

[30:10] Now here's where I'm torn.

[30:11] It's like, well, I love what Ken does on Monday night.

[30:14] And I tell him this.

[30:16] Like I just don't understand why their stream is like someone else's like name.

[30:23] Like it's the flipping out stream, which is Zach Menys distribution company.

[30:28] Like why is it on that channel?

[30:30] Like I just don't like this like I like this guy, but it's not him.

[30:36] It's not his thing.

[30:37] It's someone else's thing that he's like populating the same way like this week in pinball

[30:42] podcast is like it's Zach and Dennis.

[30:44] And when those two are together, it's great.

[30:46] But then like every other week, Dennis is not there.

[30:49] And it's like I like that dynamic.

[30:51] But then it's this week in pinball.

[30:52] Like why is it a podcast named after a site, which is then named after it's also part

[30:57] of the award show.

[30:58] Like they're also the committee on whose deciding like how everything works.

[31:03] And yet they're eligible to win.

[31:05] Now I want to say this for you people out there.

[31:07] That think there is any like insider shenanigans.

[31:11] There's not Jeff runs this thing with so much integrity and so does all the committee

[31:16] members on it.

[31:17] There's not going to be any like foul play going on.

[31:20] So so do not like not vote for who you want to vote for because you think that's happening.

[31:26] Okay.

[31:27] So please do me that favor.

[31:28] Um, but you know what I'm saying?

[31:30] It's confusing where it's just like dead flip is Jack Dangerous thing.

[31:34] Canators pinball podcast is me.

[31:35] But there's no like splitting of the votes amongst like all these other people coming

[31:40] through that, you know, the channels.

[31:42] And they're not like weirdly named or I don't know.

[31:44] You know what I'm saying?

[31:45] So that's that's my biggest confusion with the pinball streamer.

[31:48] So I'm I like both those guys and I just have to see who gets my vote.

[31:53] Um, favorite pinball podcast man.

[31:55] This is the hardest category.

[31:57] It seems in all of these writing categories.

[31:59] No, but you know who we're voting for the guy who doesn't own any pinball machines.

[32:03] Um, favorite pinball YouTube channel.

[32:06] Oh man.

[32:07] See, see also like Zach is in all of these things right now.

[32:12] So straight down the middle, uh, is a YouTube channel.

[32:15] And I think, you know, I think that's where I like to vote for Zach.

[32:18] I think straight down the middle.

[32:20] I don't know if he does as many reviews as he used to, uh, but I love like Greg and Zach

[32:25] on on on their YouTube show.

[32:27] So that that that is where I vote for Zach many because I know Zach's in like four or

[32:30] five categories.

[32:31] He even wants to be rookie of the year as well.

[32:33] If you know he's been in this hobby forever.

[32:35] Um, all right.

[32:37] Favorite pinball mod of 2019.

[32:40] Now this one, I know I was jokingly saying we should all vote for the Elvira piece of

[32:46] the couch and make it make a mockery of this category.

[32:51] But I was joking.

[32:53] I think we all should vote for the mod that is long overdue to be recognized in pinball.

[33:00] It is the mod that is the most important mod in almost everybody's machines.

[33:06] I think in 2018, 19 at the twitties, we should finally long overdue celebrate cliffy and

[33:16] the cliffy mod and there are new cliffts for new machines.

[33:19] And I implore all of you.

[33:21] I know that cliffy will be a category.

[33:24] It has to be that you please vote for cliffy for best pinball mod of 2019 because I think

[33:30] it's long overdue and I would love them to get the recognition or him to get the recognition.

[33:34] He deserves for all the years.

[33:36] I mean, it's crazy how many years we've been putting cliffies into our machines.

[33:40] All right.

[33:42] Favorite home brew pinball machine.

[33:44] Without a doubt, my favorite one of 2019 has been that dragons layer game.

[33:50] I think it's by the guy who made Captain Nemo.

[33:54] But have you seen that machine?

[33:55] Google it.

[33:56] It's so cool.

[33:57] All right.

[33:58] So here's my vote for rookie the year and I saw like, you know, some podcasters are trying

[34:10] to get into this category.

[34:12] It's open to everyone who's a stensibly new in pinball.

[34:17] But if I look at everything happening in pinball this year and who's a rookie who's not

[34:22] and who's doing their first thing in the industry that's made an impact that, you know, look,

[34:28] I land it one guy and again, because I just think his contributions actually made its

[34:34] way into the hobby and I think it actually is, I think the saving grace of a title that

[34:41] people like, even though I don't quite see it as much as others.

[34:45] But I think rookie of the year should go to Tim Sexton at Stern Pinball and, and you

[34:51] know, he coded black night and it's his first job coding a game.

[34:58] And, you know, all I hear from people who play that game, who like that game is they

[35:02] really enjoy the way the game is coded.

[35:05] And so I really don't see another rookie this year that has made an impact in pinball

[35:11] as much as Tim has.

[35:13] And so as, and also like as a rookie effort coding a game, you know, I think it succeeds.

[35:20] I really do.

[35:21] There are, there are, let's just say this way, there are seasoned coders over at Stern

[35:27] that I think have mess games up royally and I don't think Tim messed up black night

[35:32] to actually think the game has got some of the coolest like animations in it.

[35:36] It's got awesome sound.

[35:37] It's got this and that, you know, but you know, my issues with black night are not about

[35:40] the code.

[35:41] It's just more about I wish there was more of what's on that screen in the game itself.

[35:47] Like, you know, you're battling monsters and there's nothing to bash.

[35:50] All right.

[35:51] So that's Tim Sexton, rookie of the year.

[35:54] What competitive pinball player must be registered in IFPA?

[35:58] So here's, here's, here's the one place.

[36:01] I think we should, we should, we should do something that no one would expect.

[36:07] And you know, look, we could bet, we could vote for, you know, the top players Keith

[36:11] Elwin, Raymond Davidson, you know, Johannes, Ostromyer.

[36:17] I don't know, I'm like looking at these guys names, Bowen Karen's, no, no.

[36:22] I think we should vote for the last person on the IFPA list this year because that person

[36:30] to me, at least they woke up one day and said, you know what, I want to give it a go.

[36:35] And I think we should support the underdog this year in Caneta's pinball podcast.

[36:39] That's my vote.

[36:40] And I want all of you to vote for this person.

[36:42] They're, it's too late though.

[36:43] They were never written in.

[36:45] It sucks.

[36:46] But I would vote for Michelle Gabriel of United States, Gabriel.

[36:51] Because he or her, I mean, I'm not sure, she, I mean, Pacific pinball league, they're ranked

[36:58] 39,840th.

[37:02] They are on page 399 of the IFPA ranking.

[37:06] So that is who I would have voted for.

[37:08] It's too late now.

[37:09] I think I, I think I put Keith Elwin.

[37:11] I want Keith to be up there as much as possible.

[37:13] I love the man.

[37:14] I love what he does for pinball.

[37:16] All right.

[37:17] Let's see.

[37:18] Favorite pinball website.

[37:20] That is easy.

[37:22] That is this week in pinball without a doubt.

[37:25] I love it.

[37:26] No drama.

[37:27] Nothing but the news.

[37:28] Favorite pinball publication writer or article.

[37:31] Oh man.

[37:32] This one just, I don't, I don't, I, I didn't write in anything.

[37:37] I have to say because pinball magazine with the John, the juice didn't, I'm not voting

[37:40] for those guys.

[37:41] And then I don't, I don't know what else there is.

[37:44] There's something else.

[37:45] Forget which one it is.

[37:46] But there's some other magazine out there.

[37:49] Writer or article.

[37:51] How many articles about pinball written?

[37:53] You know what?

[37:54] Let's, we should, it should be that guy from IGN who writes all the stern stories whenever

[37:58] they have one.

[37:59] Anyway.

[38:00] So that one was confusing to me.

[38:02] Favorite pinball location.

[38:04] You know, for me, it is sunshine, laundromat.

[38:06] I got to throw a bone to my, my, my boy over there, Peter and Brooklyn.

[38:11] That place is amazing.

[38:13] Favorite pinball convention.

[38:14] I feel like I did this already.

[38:16] Like now that I read this out loud, I'm like, I feel like I've done so many pinball podcasts

[38:20] that I'm like repeating myself.

[38:21] Anyway, favorite pinball convention is T.P.F. favorite pinball tournament competition.

[38:27] I would say pinberg.

[38:29] Favorite pinball league.

[38:31] I, I, I know I called that guy's league out.

[38:34] It, it, it escapes me right now.

[38:36] For this one, I'll say, I think bells and chimes will probably win because I think so championing

[38:40] women's pinball is something that we should do more of and getting more people into pinball

[38:45] is important.

[38:46] And then the favorite pinball topper of 2019.

[38:49] No, it won't be the Star Wars topper.

[38:51] I think it's going to go to the months, medieval madness topper that we just saw.

[38:56] All right.

[38:57] Okay, before I close this show, I want to say that, you know, it is like the end of the year.

[39:02] It is the moment in which we reflect on pinball.

[39:04] A couple of things.

[39:05] I'm going to do my Canadian kudos show in which I give my kudos to different things happening

[39:10] in the hobby.

[39:11] Some of them will be similar to, you know, the twippy categories.

[39:15] But there's going to be other ones like best marketing hype in 2019.

[39:21] Best theme selection.

[39:22] I think that is a, I think that is a twippy.

[39:24] I don't know.

[39:25] I want to come up with some unique categories that aren't just mirrored images of the twippies.

[39:30] Okay.

[39:31] So there's that.

[39:32] The other thing that I was sad to hear is that head to head pinball is not going to do

[39:35] the twirpies this year in which they celebrate the worst in pinball.

[39:40] And I know that's it's somewhat controversial.

[39:43] And I think the twirpies need to live on.

[39:45] So if Marty is not going to do the twirpies on head to head pinball, Canadian pinball podcast

[39:50] will grab the mantle and we'll do the twirpies on this show.

[39:54] How's that sound?

[39:55] Should we do it?

[39:56] Should we keep the twirpies going?

[39:57] I'll send Marty.

[39:58] No, he's not going to let me do it.

[39:59] He's not going to want me to hijack his second, but you can't own the worst in pinball.

[40:03] We'll just call it something else.

[40:05] But I think we should also have a little fun and poke fun at the things that didn't

[40:08] quite hit this year in 2019.

[40:11] Because I think Marty's going on a hiatus in January.

[40:14] I don't know if he's coming back.

[40:15] I think he's just taking a month off.

[40:18] If this burns people out, it burns people out.

[40:22] I mean, I'm already starting to see more and more shows like take longer breaks.

[40:27] I'm already starting to see fatigue set in.

[40:31] I'm already starting to see like softiness set in.

[40:34] It's something about the twirpies, man.

[40:36] It makes people salty.

[40:37] It's weird.

[40:39] I mean, and I'm not just saying that because we've got two twirpies.

[40:43] I'm just, it's just strange.

[40:44] You got to find a way to just do stuff because you enjoy doing it.

[40:49] There's no money or recognition coming to any of us.

[40:54] Either you enjoy it or you don't.

[40:56] I give so much credit to people that do this on a weekly basis with co-host, with kids

[41:03] and families and wives.

[41:04] I mean, I could not do that.

[41:07] There is nobody in my life in terms of like family other than Brenda and Bubba.

[41:13] I walk Bubba in the morning.

[41:14] I put a headset on.

[41:15] I do a podcast.

[41:16] I don't have to facilitate interviews with co-hosts or scheduling around our weekends.

[41:22] I don't have to do it every Monday.

[41:23] I mean, I think we have like three shows this week.

[41:26] Maybe more.

[41:27] And look, the other reason why it's easy for me to do this, and you're going to get more

[41:32] shows in the winter.

[41:33] And it's not because I'm trying to get twippy votes.

[41:35] It's just simply this.

[41:36] The weather gets cooler, gets crappier.

[41:40] I'm home more.

[41:41] Okay?

[41:42] I also work from home more this time of year.

[41:45] There's also holidays.

[41:46] There's more time off.

[41:47] And you see, like, all right, 41 minutes, 41 minutes, and we've got a show.

[41:52] We can upload it and you can enjoy it.

[41:53] And I know this too.

[41:54] And I'm like, I love listening to podcasts out there, like all different types of podcasts.

[41:59] And I always, I'm like, I always hate having to wait because I kind of like listening to

[42:04] this stuff like almost every day.

[42:06] And so I'm happy that we can give you guys a constant cadence of shows that don't go

[42:11] on too long in one stream of thought, even if we do get repetitive, but everybody gets

[42:15] repetitive in Pimbal.

[42:16] So I just want to thank you guys for your support.

[42:19] I want to thank you guys for listening.

[42:21] And you know, even without owning a Pimbal machine, I think we can give a somewhat balanced

[42:26] observation on what's going on in this hobby, all right?

[42:30] That's what we're trying to do.

[42:31] The entertaining and give a balanced counterpoint to what's going on in the Pimbal world.

[42:37] Thanks everyone.

[42:38] We'll have a good day and we'll talk to you soon.
