[00:00] I'm the reluctant dragon, what ho? Quite so, the very reluctant dragon.

[00:05] Oh, very, very, don't you know? They call me the timid dragon.

[00:09] What a robber. I'm not. I just won't fight. I don't rather play. I know I shan't get hurt that way.

[00:15] Welcome everybody to the first Canada Spinball Podcast of 2025. I hope everybody had a great

[00:26] New Year's Eve. It was a busy day in pinball. Who thought everybody was going to wait and cram

[00:32] all this pinball news into one day we got finally the worst kept secret in pinball.

[00:39] Stern Pinball's next title, Dungeons and Dragons, The Tyrant's Eye has been confirmed.

[00:46] We saw the teaser video. We saw a little bit of the mechanism in the game. Remember everybody,

[00:52] they did this with X-Men. We saw the Sentinel head in X-Men. So will this be the major mech in the

[00:59] game? We also got some stuff from Jersey Jack. They did not want to be left out of the party.

[01:05] We got some stuff from Pedretti Gaming. And so as we all know, 2024 is over. It was a lackluster

[01:12] year in pinball. And now we are looking forward to what is going to be the pinball world in 2025.

[01:20] And we know there's some big themes coming. We know that 2025 needs to sort of fire on all cylinders

[01:28] if these pinball companies are going to get us to buy these games new in box. Because that's the

[01:32] big thing, right? It's like, I'm not saying don't buy games. It's just like, is there enough that

[01:39] makes you want to pull the trigger on day one or week one of a new pinball release? And if you

[01:45] just wait, you're going to save thousands of dollars. But here's the thing, Dungeons and

[01:50] Dragons, let's talk about it for a minute. So this game is going to be fully revealed to the world.

[01:55] This Friday on Stern's website, we can see that the game is not going to be more expensive than

[02:02] previous games of recent years. So the Ellie version of the game is still going to be $13,000.

[02:08] Now, a $13,000 Dungeons and Dragons game in which they're going to make 740

[02:16] limited edition versions of the game. The reason why is D&D was a game that was founded in 1974.

[02:25] Stern seemingly will just find some number associated with an IP now, and that will become the

[02:32] number of LEDs. Will that work out for them? I don't think it worked out too well for X-Men.

[02:39] Maybe it does better with D&D. You know my feeling on all of this, less is more. I want to see there

[02:45] be only 500 LEDs. I think that's a nice number. I think when games were just 500, the frenzy to get

[02:54] one was amazing and was incredible. And that's when LEDs were like $6,500 people. Now they're

[03:02] 13 grand and they doubled the amount. So 740 is better than 811. It's better than 1,000. So we'll

[03:11] see what happens. And ultimately, I encourage each and every one of you to just be patient. I see a

[03:17] lot of people arguing right now about whether or not D&D will be successful, whether or not it will

[03:24] be a flop. You know look, there's some things we can't argue. And that is as a property, I get that

[03:30] D&D is a billion dollar property for Wizards of the Coast. And it's grown a little bit over the last

[03:38] few years. Now, does that mean that those D&D fanatics who can go buy a D&D game for like

[03:46] anywhere from $10 to $200 are those individuals going to cross over and buy a $7,000 to $13,000

[03:57] pinball machine? And here's the thing. I don't know. You don't know. We're going to have to wait and

[04:03] see what happens come Friday when the sales banks open up for this game. And I think a lot is going

[04:10] to come down to you. If you ask me, a lot is going to come down to you because we're not going to see

[04:15] the code in the game, right? Dwight has the ability to put us all to sleep when he talks about his

[04:21] rule sets and he uses his finger to hit all the switches. They're not going to do that. You know,

[04:27] we're going to get that two to three minute stern video that just shows off all the features. I think

[04:32] they'll also probably do, you know, one of the extended videos with Gomez and Eddie talking about

[04:38] the game. I'm sure Dwight will be in there, but it won't be like a full gameplay sort of walkthrough

[04:44] of the game, which is good. You know, I don't want them to spoil everything in this game,

[04:48] but what I think is really going to make or break this game, I think the mechanisms really have to

[04:53] be magical. And we're looking at this dragon that they showed. Now, if you look at the way they did

[04:59] X-Men, they featured the main mech in the teaser trailer. So is this dragon the main mech in the

[05:07] game? It does not look like the dragon. I can't tell fully. It doesn't look like he eats balls.

[05:13] I'm not sure if balls come through the front of his mouth. Maybe he doesn't eat him, but he spits out

[05:18] the balls like he's shooting fire. So that would be really cool. But what we can see in the video,

[05:24] Carrie Hardy, like highlighted or he made brighter the video, it looks a lot like Attack from Mars.

[05:31] Like the three target drop bank is underneath that dragon, and it looks like it lowers much

[05:37] like the UFO shot up the middle in Attack from Mars. And so look, everybody, if this is going to end

[05:44] up being another fan layout from Brian Eddy with nothing truly original or unique, knowing that

[05:54] Keith Elwin's King Kong is around the corner, knowing that Eric Minier's Harry Potter is around

[06:01] the corner, knowing that other games are coming out real soon, is that going to be enough? So I

[06:08] think that's going to be one of the things that people look for. Are the mechs magical enough?

[06:13] Is it a unique layout? And also I think with the world of D&D, the artwork is super important. And

[06:20] I really hope they don't use cheesy AI generated artwork, which this franchise has been accused

[06:26] of doing this last year. So they got lazy and used a lot of AI generated art. I hope the art style

[06:34] on this game reflects more of the Capcom arcade versions of D&D from like the 80s or 90s. I think

[06:42] it's the 90s, those games came out. So go look at Capcom arcade, Dungeons & Dragons artwork. And I

[06:49] think if they nail that, and the game's got a lot of magical mechs, I think this game is going to

[06:56] have like not too bad of a reveal. I do. I think coming out of titles that were underwhelming,

[07:03] a world in which there hasn't been many magical mechs in a long time, there hasn't really been

[07:08] that world under glass that just blew us away in pinball anywhere in 2024. So I really do think

[07:16] this game is coming out in a time to start the new year, where we're all looking for a lot more

[07:24] creativity and pinball. Now, where I would encourage each and every one of us to manage our

[07:29] expectations, it's one simple thing. A stern is a stern is a stern. So you know, like just remember

[07:39] who's making this game. I find it hard to believe that stern is going to go above and beyond and

[07:45] throw so much into this game and not fall back on flat plastics all throughout the game. And they're

[07:52] actually going to engineer something that's absolutely mind blowing. I hope I'm wrong. I hope

[07:57] they do do all that. But we're going to know Friday. So the full reveal of this game, order banks are

[08:04] all going to open up this Friday. That's exciting. We just have two days to wait. Now, does that mean

[08:11] they're going to do like a dealer or a distro call sometime before then? Probably not. They're probably

[08:18] going to do it Friday morning. I already see dealers taking orders on this game. I encourage each

[08:25] and every one of you wait to see this game. I still don't think and I'm just saying this. You know,

[08:30] I don't think it even matters like what's in it. I don't even think it matters if this game is

[08:34] incredible. I just don't see this game going up in value or being hard to get. And I do think with

[08:43] what's around the corner, the smart person is going to sort of curb your FOMO a little bit,

[08:49] curb your enthusiasm, if you will, and just get excited about it, right? Geek out over it,

[08:55] join the conversation around it. But man, I wouldn't go in on one yet. I would just wait because I just

[09:01] feel like in just three months, we're going to get Harry Potter in three and a half months. We're

[09:06] going to get King Kong and it's all coming like so soon. And when those games drop, we know that

[09:12] D&D is going to be yesterday's news. Look how much Uncanny X-Men is now yesterday's news.

[09:20] Even Jack Danger posted, you know, that he had a rough 2024. Why do you think he had a rough 2024?

[09:27] Because all the slings and arrows that came at him because of a game that got rushed to market.

[09:32] He didn't want X-Men to be rushed to market. It just was. And I don't think X-Men's going to have

[09:38] some 180 turnaround where the game is all of a sudden going to be incredible in six months.

[09:44] I don't think that's going to happen. I think they're moving on to the next. Here's some funny

[09:48] people. The name of this game, I want to just explain to you that D&D is really nerdy and really

[09:55] geeky. It is. It's like a whole different level of being a nerd and a geek. So the name of this game

[10:02] is the Tyrant's Eye. And I'm like, oh, wow, cool. Like, I don't even know what that means.

[10:08] Let me Google search what D&D Tyrant's Eye means. Let me read you this. It is an item. It is a

[10:16] wondrous amulet that requires attunement in parentheses. Legendary. Okay. I love the way D&D

[10:24] language works. All right. Let me read you what the Tyrant's Eye is. An amulet on a silver necklace

[10:30] with a large pale green gemstone in the middle with smaller pale green gemstones to the left

[10:38] and right of the larger one to mirror a Death Tyrant's central and lesser eyes. The Death Tyrant's

[10:46] Eye is a powerful item made from the eyes of a Death Tyrant and Necromancy. This item allows

[10:53] a Necromancer to bypass Necromancer law through the undead controlling capacity of a Death Tyrant

[11:01] and those in range to be unable to heal while wearing this amulet gain the following effects.

[11:08] Creatures you choose in 120 feet of view can't regain HP. There is no limit to how many undead

[11:15] you can control at a time. How many of you now are feeling excited, right? Oh man, the Tyrant's Eye.

[11:22] Can't wait to get my hands on that amulet. You know what I'm saying? What would you rather have?

[11:27] This or Die Hard? Yippee-ki-yay, mofos. This or Total Recall? Consider that a divorce. This or Predator?

[11:35] Ghostness, mofos? You know what I'm just saying everybody. Like the truth is this. 99% of you are

[11:42] not D&D fans. 99% of you didn't play D&D. 99% of you are gonna turn into Apologies and say this is

[11:52] the greatest game ever. Are you buying it? No, it's the greatest game ever. Are you getting one?

[11:57] No, it's the greatest game ever. Okay, that's what's gonna happen. All right, so not to be left out of

[12:02] the party yesterday was Jersey Jack Pinball once again uploading the photo of Jack standing in front

[12:09] of the Wizard of Oz and also Harry Potter. He's over at Warner Brothers and he loves to do this.

[12:17] He loves to share that photo and we all know that Harry Potter is next. We all know that it's going

[12:24] to be Eric Minier's wide body game and then I think Steve Ritchie is either doing the Matrix or

[12:30] Sonic the Hedgehog and so look, we know that that game is coming out in February and March. I kind of

[12:37] like Jersey Jack's troll post where they're like just don't forget about this ladies and gentlemen

[12:43] and look, I do think these companies need to get a little bit more direct. Like I know what they're

[12:49] doing and it's subversive but just come out and say it. Like we have Harry Potter coming out in

[12:54] three months. Like get ready for magic. One company did that yesterday, Pedreity Gaming, was like here's

[13:01] to a magical 2025 and they have this image. I think everyone's getting this wrong. They have this image

[13:07] that is actually encompassing three different potential title remakes from Planetary Pinball

[13:15] and Pedreity Gaming. So if you look at the photo, they said here's to a magical 2025. So instantly

[13:23] everybody is like they're remaking Theater of Magic. It's right there. They wrote the word magical

[13:28] but then you look to the upper right of the image and there's a flying carpet which is from Toten

[13:35] and then you look below it and there's all these circus tents which is Circus Voltaire. So they've

[13:41] put into that image purposely the three major J-pop remake games, Theater of Magic, Toten,

[13:49] Tales of the Arabian Knights and Circus Voltaire I think are all represented in that image. So it

[13:56] could be one of those three titles. I don't think it's confirmation that it's only Theater of Magic

[14:03] but it's new Pinball week. It's a new Pinball year and it's an exciting time. I really really do get

[14:11] excited when we know there's a new game around the corner. I hope everybody had a great New Year's

[14:17] Eve. I hope everyone is spending time with friends and family right now and not working and I look

[14:24] forward to the live reveal of D&D. What I'm going to do, Canada is going to do my live reaction to

[14:31] this game when they reveal it. We know exactly when that's going to happen. There's a countdown clock.

[14:38] Will something leak beforehand? Probably that always happens but I can't wait to share my reaction.

[14:45] I can't wait to see your reaction. I'll tell you right now. I'm not buying one. I don't even care

[14:50] what's in it. I just bought Brenda a bracelet from Tiffany's that costs more than the Ellie of this

[14:55] machine so it is not happening ladies and gentlemen. I need a few months to recover and then maybe then

[15:03] I'll go on a mission to get the amulet known as the Tyrant's Eye. Everybody have a great New

[15:10] Year's Day. We'll be on like maybe every single day as more things develop around the next game

[15:15] from Stern Pinball. Peace out. They call me the timid dragon. What rock? I'm not. I just won't fight.

[15:23] I know I shop. Get hurt that way. Here we go gathering nuts in May. Nuts in May. Nuts in May.

[15:28] I'm so reluctant. Woo.
