[00:00] I have some dreams they were clouds in my coffee

[00:04] Clouds in my coffee and you're so plain

[00:11] You probably think that song is about you

[00:14] You're so plain

[00:23] After doing 200 and 30 episodes of

[00:27] Canada's pinball podcast you know I've come to one

[00:31] Singular conclusion that pretty much defines so much of the pinball new inbox collectors mentality and that is this

[00:41] So many people bitch about pinball machines and then after they're done bitching they go buy the machine

[00:49] They go buy the damn machine

[00:51] There is this cycle of contempt that most of you can't get out of and the simple reason is because you're addicted

[00:59] You are simply addicted to pinball machines you need new pinball machines

[01:04] You feel like a child on Christmas morning when new game arrives and whenever a new game is revealed

[01:10] You always go through the same sort of feelings of oh my god. It's amazing or oh my god

[01:15] I can't believe that's on the game or they took that out of the game

[01:19] What the hell are they thinking? I'm not gonna buy this game and then a few weeks later you buy the game

[01:24] All right, it's because you know what we finally heard from Jersey Jack

[01:27] He's been hiding out in Europe doing god knows what

[01:30] He's fighting the European front of pinball and we hear from him

[01:33] You got interviewed by our friend Jonathan Justin

[01:36] So I think he's got like two more names attached to that but I can only remember those two of pinball news

[01:40] And he interviewed Jack and I'm not gonna play the interview. I'm gonna summarize the interview for you

[01:46] Jersey Jack apologizes for removing the three concentric rings from pirates of the Caribbean

[01:52] He says the reason why was reliability

[01:55] They're not gonna ship you a broken game. They can't do that

[01:58] They've got an obligation to get you a pinball machine that actually works. Well, thank you Jack

[02:03] Thanks so much, buddy

[02:04] I really appreciate it that you're not gonna ship me a broken product

[02:08] You know that tells me that tells me that your name is not Andrew highway, but okay

[02:12] If you if you believe the reliability story that's cool

[02:15] He also said that you know what we didn't lose orders

[02:19] There might be people bailing out, but those weren't real orders those were there's pre-order dollars that people put down

[02:24] Like the non-refundable orders that people put with distributors that money wasn't going to Jersey Jack pinball

[02:30] So he doesn't really see that as a loss

[02:32] Okay, and here's the thing too he also says that if you want a full-featured game

[02:38] There's nothing else out there quite like pirates of the Caribbean and you know what? He's right

[02:44] Jersey Jack is right. There is no other game

[02:47] That puts as much into the game as Jersey Jack machines and I think Jack is finally

[02:52] Not finally. I think he realizes the same thing that Gary Stern realizes the same thing that George Gomez realizes

[03:00] That you guys out there you guys out there will bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch, but you're still gonna buy

[03:07] You're still gonna buy

[03:08] Because if you want a full-featured game like pirates of the Caribbean if you want a game packed with toys and new things and

[03:16] You know complex code and deep code and LCDs with beautiful animations. What are you gonna go buy?

[03:23] What are you gonna go buy? Okay?

[03:25] That's the thing it doesn't matter

[03:27] It doesn't matter that they remove these rings. I still think pirates the Caribbean is gonna do okay

[03:32] Now I just think it's gonna do okay

[03:33] I don't think that pirates of the Caribbean is gonna be Jersey Jack pinball's best-selling game

[03:38] Because the the thing that is just the ultimate reality about this game is nobody really wants the pirates of the Caribbean theme to game right now in

[03:46] 2018 what you really want is a great pinball experience

[03:50] Okay, now pirates the Caribbean could not come out at a worse time if you ask me because there's another game out there

[03:57] That I think people are lukewarm on the theme, but the game itself the game itself is just blowing people away

[04:05] All right

[04:07] I've never seen more positive response to a new stern pinball machine

[04:12] I've never seen it like it is with iron maiden have have you like what game have we seen since like Metallica

[04:20] Since maybe acdc. I don't know. I don't I can't remember because I came into this hobby after Metallica was out after acdc was out

[04:30] Every stern game that I've seen release has always been a little bit of like a lukewarm response

[04:37] I remember when ghost busters got revealed remember the hysteria there and all 400 ghost busters at least sold out

[04:44] But the thing with this is ghost busters was a game that when we saw it

[04:49] We fell in love with it and then people started playing it and they're like oh my god this game

[04:55] sucks

[04:56] Like it was literally like that like the actual pinball experience of ghost busters was so bad

[05:02] And that and and it was like you know

[05:04] It's like you were staring at this beautiful game and then you realized like it wasn't gonna shoot well and you're like shit

[05:10] Shit and it was ghost busters which is a theme that people love way more than pirates of the Caribbean and iron maiden

[05:17] But man maiden mayhem is real like it is real because if you read the thread

[05:23] This isn't just people who bought it convincing you it's great

[05:26] You know those people are called alien buyers okay an alien buyer a highway pinball supporter

[05:32] That's the person who buys the game and then just convinces everyone. It's the greatest experience ever

[05:36] Even though you go play an alien at a show and it's like really slow

[05:39] It's really floaty. It's really clunky the game itself is not that good

[05:43] But if you bought one then it's the greatest thing ever and you will tell everybody that but iron maiden's different

[05:49] Iron maiden's different because I'm hearing from a lot of people who are not even owners

[05:55] That are playing this game on location saying it's something special

[05:58] It's really something special and here's what I heard today

[06:02] I heard that canada's pinball podcasts might actually

[06:07] Have infiltrated into the code system of iron maiden pinball that when you start an iron maiden pinball game at certain points

[06:16] It says welcome to my world on your glass or something like that

[06:21] And I don't know maybe I should trademark world on your glass and get a royalty every time the game is turned on

[06:27] But that's the thing. It's like bitch and then buy bitch and then buy now what happens when people aren't bitching

[06:34] And they really want to buy a pinball game

[06:36] I think you have a situation like we're gonna have today and today is the day

[06:40] We've been waiting for because today is the day

[06:42] It's either today or tomorrow that we are most likely going to see iron maiden

[06:47] Ellie and iron maiden premium now. I've been talking to some of my people over at stern

[06:54] And apparently there I think the ultimate decision on when to reveal it is up to the band themselves

[07:01] that they have permission

[07:03] Of when it gets released so and I think stern is making these games that they're supposed to be getting them next week

[07:09] And I think we should see an iron maiden premium or Ellie at all in town

[07:14] On May 4th and 5th

[07:16] So it's coming soon. I've it's never been like this right? There's never been this weight to see the premium and Ellie

[07:22] Right up until they're gonna ship

[07:25] And think about that for a minute. Let's think about that for a minute

[07:28] Stern pinball is gonna show you the premium and Ellie version of their game

[07:35] Pretty much within the same week that it ships the same week

[07:40] Now let's think about Jersey jack pinball strategy

[07:42] About how I'm gonna show you a game almost a year out from when it ships now the other part of the jack interview

[07:49] That was interesting as he said

[07:51] Well, we're never gonna show games early like this again. We've learned our lesson. We're not gonna do it

[07:56] All right, we're not gonna do it and part of me is like jack like are you even like is this like a conversation in a strategy

[08:02] You're having with yourself like he just flip flops back and forth

[08:06] Remember jack said he wasn't gonna show a game until it was ready

[08:10] Uh, after the hobbit right he said he learned the lessons from the hobbit and he said he wasn't gonna show dialed in before

[08:16] It was ready for the assembly line and what did he do?

[08:20] He showed it like four to six months early

[08:22] Okay, but this one's been really interesting because they showed it so goddamn early

[08:28] And here's my question for them now. I want you to guys to think about this scenario

[08:33] What if jack didn't show pirates the Caribbean early

[08:36] What if he was designing it with a three concentric disc and they you know, we're doing it all behind

[08:42] Close doors, right?

[08:44] Would they have found out that there was a reliability issue or did they only discover that because they put these games on

[08:51] Location and because of all that constant

[08:54] Abuse that's when they realized that the concentric rings weren't gonna work now here's

[08:59] You could believe what they say or you could believe that

[09:03] It's a bunch of bullshit now. I'm somewhere in the middle because here's here's here's why

[09:08] You're telling me you're telling me that they couldn't figure out how to make those things work

[09:15] And you know if you if you listen to what Eric and jack say

[09:18] They keep using a very specific line after they say it was a reliability issue

[09:25] They keep saying and we ran out of time

[09:28] We ran out of time what what does that mean you ran out of time? I don't get that

[09:35] It's not like we're trying to launch a satellite to catch an image of like Pluto and we have to launch within this window

[09:45] Or else we won't be able to make it because the planets won't be lined up accurately like what what do you mean you ran out of time

[09:53] Like we have to get the game into production are you telling me that the two years

[09:59] They spent aren't doing this mechanism

[10:02] They they didn't see any this wear and tear issue they they nothing popped up

[10:08] That this wasn't a cost-cutting measure

[10:11] And and so like I don't get it. I really I don't buy it

[10:15] I just don't because like I don't get why they can't fix it

[10:19] And I as some people are saying the last thing I want in a pinball machine is to have to stare up at the LCD screen more

[10:26] for these things like

[10:28] You know it's acts like we're gonna spend hundreds you said this hundreds of hours

[10:33] coding

[10:35] the three

[10:36] concentric rings that'll take place on the LCD screen and what doesn't that take a lot of time

[10:41] And in that time can't you make the actual physical things work all right now here is the thing

[10:46] I think all of us just need to put

[10:49] uh, you know spinner gate to rest it's not gonna it this is a done deal

[10:53] You either accept the game as it is you either bitch about it or you don't buy it or you bitch about it and you buy it

[11:01] Some people are still staying in on their orders. I don't you know, what do I think is gonna happen?

[11:07] I look I still think it's a beautiful game

[11:09] I don't think Pirates of the Caribbean is a turd fest by any means right now

[11:14] I just think that Jersey Jack games are really expensive

[11:17] And I don't think they make people as excited to buy those games as they should

[11:22] Considering how much is in those games and I think if you look at how Jersey Jack launches their products

[11:29] And and everything that goes into the way they bring their pinball machines into the world

[11:34] I think they do have a lot to learn about what is the best strategy by which to create the kind of hype

[11:41] And the kind of excitement that you need when you launch a pinball machine

[11:45] And you could argue the way Jack dismisses the pre-order people and the pin-side people

[11:51] That all these companies might look at pin-side people they might look at the hyper

[11:56] uh, you know the hyper fanatic as irrelevant right they might put those people like you people who follow pinball podcasts every day

[12:04] You people who are on pinball forms every day

[12:07] They might consider you to be like pointless in their strategy

[12:10] They might be like we're gonna get those people anyway

[12:13] And they might be right because they might just assume that you guys are addicted that you guys are gonna buy that you guys

[12:19] It is like a drug to all of you and as much as you complain

[12:22] You'll still go in on the next one and in on the next one and can you blame them for kind of considering you guys to be somewhat irrelevant

[12:31] To their marketing strategy that their marketing strategy is more about we need to get

[12:36] New people buying our products who are you know putting game rooms in their homes

[12:41] We need to get people who buy one pinball machine and maybe consider too that the majority of people out there who do buy pinball machines probably

[12:49] Don't have like five to ten pinball machines. I don't know

[12:52] It's hard to tell because none of this data is out there. I mean all we can do is speculate

[12:57] But like I think pirates of the Caribbean it's like when is it even coming out?

[13:00] You know, we still we still don't know and

[13:04] I think what's gonna happen to this?

[13:06] Here's my here's my here's my hunch of what is gonna happen

[13:09] With pirates of the Caribbean. I think it's gonna be very similar to what happened with the hobbit

[13:14] I think that people are going to who buy it are gonna can try to convince you

[13:20] That it is like such an amazing game that you just have to give it you have to give it a chance

[13:26] You just have to play it in a home use environment

[13:28] You just have to play it like in the right settings and you have to set up the machine properly

[13:33] It has to be dialed in you're gonna get all this stuff

[13:36] And then what's gonna happen is

[13:38] People are gonna play iron maiden and have so much fucking fun in like four minutes

[13:43] And they're gonna be like this is pinball. This is what pinball was always supposed to be

[13:48] This like immediate like satisfying and gratifying toy that has blinking lights and callouts and like music and like you know

[13:57] Bright artwork. This is what pinball is supposed to be and I think that's what's happened to me as I look at all these companies out there

[14:04] It's hard to deny that I think Stern just is the best at making the most fun pinball experiences

[14:09] Do I think they make the best games or have the most innovation on a level of fun?

[14:15] I don't think anyone can beat Stern

[14:18] They give you the most fun themes

[14:19] They make the games the most approachable and they like consistently crank out a variety of options for you to choose from

[14:27] I mean if you walk into Stern pinball it's like walking into

[14:30] Baskin Robbins they've got what like 31 flavors for you to choose from you walk into Jersey jack

[14:35] They've got like four so it's like real simple like which pinball company out there is actually appealing to like what your interest are

[14:43] And that's Stern pinball and I think Stern has really got has really

[14:48] Started to understand what makes a machine fun and also what makes a machine desirable

[14:54] So they've they've added the artwork and they've got in that to a level where it's very very respectable

[14:59] It's like the best artwork in the business right now. They've got great coding going on

[15:03] I keep hearing how great the code on iron maiden is and here's the thing what I love about hearing all of that is

[15:09] I'm also not hearing it's coming from lime and sheets so now they have two amazing

[15:15] Code people cranking these games out and the fact that iron maiden is shipping with pretty much complete code

[15:21] says a lot

[15:23] So I just I just think that where jack wins on innovation Stern wins on fun factor

[15:29] And and that's the thing and that's the thing ultimately you need to make your pinball machine fun

[15:34] That is always going to be the reason why people go back

[15:37] It's not just about complexity and graphics and this and that you know, I'm talking a little bit in the world of arcade games

[15:44] Some of the most simple arcade games are the most fun and they don't have the most complex rules

[15:50] They don't have the most incredible visuals, but they're just really fun to play

[15:55] You know, why do we all love playing connect for because I can tell you how to play connect for because connect for

[16:00] Is the game everyone can jump on and immediately enjoy?

[16:03] It's almost intuitive what to do

[16:06] You know when I look at some of these games and even when I try to understand pirates the care being

[16:10] Yeah, all these inserts everywhere. Yeah, yeah, yeah, is it really hard to understand or is it easy to understand?

[16:15] That was my concern about iron maiden is I saw so many inserts on the play field

[16:19] It looked like it was probably going to be really really confusing

[16:22] But what I'm hearing is it's the complete opposite and so that's great and that is great

[16:27] Okay, but here's here's here's here's the thing it's like

[16:31] Ultimately ultimately

[16:34] How long can Jersey Jack go without creating the kind of hype he needs and the kind of demand he needs to see Jersey Jack should be

[16:43] Punching should be lights out against stern as a competitor if they release a game head to head lights out

[16:49] I mean seriously, it's like I don't understand why

[16:54] With all they put into their games they can't create a game that has more hype than than a stern game

[16:59] Can you know why would you email me why why Jack who has a higher bomb who spends more time developing these games?

[17:08] Who's who's who's who can focus on only one game? I mean think about that for a minute stern pimp

[17:13] Is manufacturing at any one time they're R&D probably like four to eight games at once and Jack can focus on like one game

[17:22] And he needs to get that one game right and they never can just like get it right and knock it out of the park

[17:28] Why is that?

[17:29] Why is that

[17:31] There's so freaking close. I want to just like get in my demon drive over to jjp and be like all right guys

[17:38] Time to fuck out like what is going on here? Where's toy story?

[17:42] Let me see this fucking thing is it fucking amazing come on what the fuck are we doing?

[17:46] Let's not put this bullshit

[17:48] Pirate to the Caribbean like wait if I saw the release schedule

[17:51] Pirate to the Caribbean toy story willy Wonka okay. This is cool man. Jack. This is great

[17:55] But what the fuck is that pirate to the Caribbean doing up there? You need a hit all right? You need a fucking hit

[18:01] That's not gonna be a hit the hits toy story the hit is willy Wonka and even that I'd be like

[18:06] Really come on

[18:08] Something contemporary because nobody wants toy story for nobody if this game focuses primarily on toy story for

[18:15] I mean god help us

[18:17] Toy story one. It is the shit. Just make it about toy story one

[18:21] All right, I'm excited today. I'm just walking around my apartment doing a freaking pinball podcast

[18:26] I just worked out. I just where it's beautiful out

[18:30] It ate a healthy breakfast and you know what? You know what? I earned maiden Ellie and premium today

[18:36] Aren't you excited? Here's why because it's freaking iron maiden Ellie and premium

[18:42] This is gonna be the nicest Ellie's turn has ever done. It is

[18:46] I literally I've heard from people who are honest with me and they would tell me

[18:51] eh, but they're like dude wait wait

[18:55] And I got some advice teaky over there selling you as for 10,500 dude. What are you doing?

[19:01] This game is gonna sell for 11,000 plus 12,000 dollars on the second hand market

[19:05] It just is just watch

[19:08] Mark my words people are not gonna want to let this machine go

[19:12] It is gonna be that special and for those of you saying this is just an anomaly

[19:16] It's a fluke game at stern you may be right you may there is nothing to indicate

[19:21] That's that this game is gonna you know, it's gonna raise the bar and that we're gonna see the next games from stern

[19:28] Reach that same level. This is Keith Ellens game. All right. This is Keith Ellens game and you know

[19:34] He designed it it stern bought this game from him

[19:39] That's what you're getting you're not getting a game developed inside stern's factory walls from day one

[19:44] Now that's awesome that they now hired Keith Ellens

[19:49] So he's gonna be making more stern games in the future and I bet you if iron maiden sells like hotcakes

[19:56] And your George Gomez and Gary stern and you're allocating resources and funds

[20:02] Who you gonna give him to?

[20:03] Hey Keith

[20:05] We're gonna give you whatever you want to make your next title because people effing love what you do

[20:10] That's what happens in business in any industry you put your money behind the winners and Keith Ellens right now

[20:18] He's winning his design is a winner. It's a home run

[20:23] All right, he's knocked it out of the park

[20:26] There's no there's no if ends or butts about it. All right

[20:31] He basically this will be the biggest title of stern this year. I I think easily

[20:38] Easily

[20:39] Will this outsell Star Wars? I don't know. I don't think so. I still think Star Wars just as a theme

[20:46] Is easier for distributors to sell to people than iron maiden will this go down as a longer selling game than Star Wars

[20:52] Absolutely will this ultimately eclipse Star Wars sales when all this said and done. I think so I do

[20:58] I think star who wants Star Wars now who is talking about Star Wars like nobody

[21:05] nobody

[21:06] Nobody I mean Star Wars will still go down in history as the worst theme integration ever

[21:12] And it's not even Steve Richie's fault

[21:14] I mean working with Disney and Lucas on the game was probably an F and Nightmare

[21:18] It's just terrible, but here's a thing is like stern easily could have made Star Wars Keith Ellens design

[21:26] You see that's the thing is like they just slapped iron maiden onto this this could have keep that one's design

[21:33] Could have been guardians of the galaxy

[21:35] It could have been ghost busters. It could have been like every stern machine. We've seen it could have been Batman

[21:43] But you know what will only ever be able to see it as iron maiden and it works and it worked. It's working for people

[21:49] All right

[21:51] All right, what else is going on the pinball world?

[21:53] I'm kind of just like spitball. I'm sorry guys. I just wanted to get something up. That's what you get to do

[21:57] You know, I don't have to wait for I don't have to wait for interviews all the time. I don't have to wait for like

[22:02] Like a co-host all the time. I can just get you guys some pinball thoughts

[22:06] All right, so I reached out to my boy a deep route Robert Mueller and they're working behind the scenes

[22:11] They're working hard a little bit of an update

[22:14] I just asked him like you know because I you know I challenged him to show me

[22:18] some magic girl working

[22:20] And he responded that magic girl is being redesigned

[22:24] Pretty much completely redesigned and is just getting to the whitewood phase now

[22:29] It is kind of funny that magic girl again that John poppadook announced

[22:35] for the first time

[22:37] When was it like 2012 or something like that that magic girl is going back into whitewood stage

[22:45] And I was told that the game that comes out will look like the game that we have seen

[22:52] Probably artistically, but it's probably mechanically going to be different

[22:56] But I also heard this interesting point about it that it's not a priority right now for them

[23:01] That magic girl is not a priority

[23:04] And that's just interesting because

[23:07] Which means to me that they're not going to get magic girl done by Texas pinball festival 2019

[23:13] Which leads me to believe that all of the zidware games that are subsequent to follow

[23:18] Will also

[23:20] Not be ready in time that raza won't be there that

[23:24] Alice in wonderland now if I were Robert

[23:27] And you know here's my marking advice for you man. I would I would start with Alice

[23:31] I think it's the best looking game. I think it's the most beautiful art package zombie yet he's ever drawn

[23:36] I don't even know why you're remaking magic girl. I really don't like the magical owners got their games

[23:42] They're broken the only owners that you need to satiate are raza and Alice in wonderland people

[23:48] I don't know why you're even bothering with magic girl and

[23:52] You know, it's I guarantee you

[23:55] Working with john to redesign a john pop-a-doo game is gonna be a colossal nightmare

[24:00] There is there's no way this thing is gonna go smoothly and and there has to be some

[24:06] I bet there's some hesitation happening now in robert's head that you know working with john

[24:12] Probably wasn't the best move because he's got all these other designers who can start from you know can start from page one

[24:19] Without any baggage without any drama without any legal notices without any like pissed off customers

[24:27] But you know say this the man is very bullish the man is very bullish the man is determined to succeed in this industry

[24:34] And I think uh we're just gonna have to wait and see we're just gonna have to wait and see what goes on all right

[24:41] All right, what else is going on in the pinball world anything else

[24:45] Anyone like even talking about Alice Cooper's nightmare castle anymore right see how quickly the hype goes

[24:50] It's like there then it's not you have that window

[24:54] I think the next thing is like Alice Cooper production timelines gonna come out and

[24:59] Do I think they're gonna get 500 people on the list like of course as I said you guys are addicted to pinball and it's like a

[25:05] limited run pinball game

[25:07] I think they're gonna be buyers

[25:10] Big day-to-day with iron made and Ellie and premium big day-to-day

[25:14] Anything else that I'm missing about pinball you know some p3s are trickling out. I mean

[25:20] Wait one at a time. It seems like I don't know. I don't know like you know what it's like pinball is funny, right

[25:28] There's like there's like the major leagues where things are actually happening and then there's everything else

[25:33] I did hear that dutch pinball

[25:36] Things are like looking good. I heard that they are

[25:40] Actually getting close that is what I'm hearing. I also heard they got an investor

[25:44] So we'll see we'll see what happens or might still be hope for the big Lebowski

[25:49] But that's another game where it's like how old is the big Lebowski sound right now like we're still it's like

[25:55] Imagine like a movie that came out in theaters in 2014 and it's like they keep trying to re-release it in theaters every year

[26:01] And at some point you're just like

[26:04] I'm kind of done. I'm kind of done with this game like I don't know

[26:09] Uh

[26:10] All right. Well, that's it folks a little short little podcast for you this morning

[26:14] Bitch and then buy bitch and then buy keep doing it keep complaining, but keep buying you guys are addicted

[26:20] You're addicted

[26:22] You know, I like I talked to some of my friends and

[26:24] You know, it's like they travel around the world no matter where they go in vacation. They have to seek out pinball

[26:29] It's like what's wrong with you people when you go somewhere with your family

[26:34] Like enjoy the culture of that place

[26:37] Don't don't spend don't even waste a minute like going to like play pinball

[26:43] That you play all the time when you're at home and at the pinball shows. I don't get it

[26:48] Are you that addicted to the silver ball

[26:51] Like right now it's starting to get really beautiful out in New York City

[26:54] And it's just like the last thing you should do on a beautiful day or a beautiful night in a city that never sleeps

[27:02] Is is hunker down in front of a pinball machine. I mean pinballs like a winter sport

[27:07] I mean, it's totally a winter sport

[27:09] It's not something you want to do when it's beautiful out you waste a day of your life

[27:13] Like trying to get a higher score in a pinball machine. No way

[27:17] No way and for those of you say like pinball is like more social than arcade games

[27:22] I got it. I want to tell you what I did last weekend

[27:25] I went to barcade in Brooklyn. They've got they got like four pinball machines

[27:29] All right, then they have all arcade machines and they have a street fighter to there

[27:34] All right street fighter to turbo and for two and a half hours with 50 cents

[27:38] I just like stayed on that machine and beat like all these guys with 50 cents

[27:43] And you get to know the people you're playing against it's it's the games are over in three minutes or less

[27:49] It's fun to watch people play street fighter in the arcade

[27:52] Pinball's not like that. It's not like fun to watch people play pinball against other people

[27:57] I mean, it's like and like no one's on the pinball machines

[28:00] I was laughing too because the the crew here in New York City who goes to pioneers bar

[28:05] They're on Facebook complaining about the nights that people actually go to pioneer bar to like drink beers and get laid and meet people

[28:11] Like you don't want to go on a Friday night all these yuppies are there and you can hear the pinball machines

[28:17] And every time I go there

[28:19] They're playing like great music everyone's drinking out of a good time and the pinball machines are empty

[28:24] And I just love the difference of how pinball people look at the world and how the rest of the world looks at the world

[28:31] And I'm somewhere in the middle and I think people who enjoy this hobby are somewhere in the middle is I enjoy pinball

[28:38] But it is not the center of my universe

[28:40] It is not the thing I seek out to have a good time when I when I travel

[28:45] I will never travel the world with my family on a pinball excursion like what the fuck

[28:51] Like the five days of roto Dave have you guys seen this thread on pinside?

[28:55] I mean is there any more like like guy who needs more attention to everything he does in pinball than roto Dave

[29:01] And I know he listens to this show

[29:02] But he creates his own thread called the five days of roto Dave to see what he can do it just like

[29:09] Just dude I challenge roto Dave to actually go on a vacation like spend a week and not play pinball

[29:17] And see what happens like I think your penis will still be there Dave at the end of that week like it's okay, bro

[29:24] Like you don't have to make pinball the cultural epicenter of everything you do

[29:31] All right

[29:32] These things are like expensive too. I mean damn it's like I was looking at you know

[29:36] Some of these recent games and everything and I'm looking at like even my own finances

[29:40] I'm saving for a wedding and it's kind of stupid how much pinball machines are

[29:45] For the experience you get and I say that because I just bought god of war if you haven't played god of war on PlayStation

[29:52] Oh my f in god. It is incredible. It is absolutely incredible

[29:56] And it's like 69 dollars and I keep like it's hard to shake the fact that

[30:02] You know pinball is kind of broken. It really should be like you buy one

[30:07] Platform and you can swap in different games without having to spend $10,000 each time

[30:12] It doesn't work we know that

[30:14] Because a play field can't be stored the way a compact disk can and you don't even need compact disks anymore

[30:19] Because everyone buys and downloads their video games now, but it's just it's just so unfortunate that you guys have picked a hobby

[30:27] Me included that to continue to have new experiences in it

[30:31] It literally is like sending a kid to college each time you buy a new game

[30:36] I know I'm probably talking about a college in like

[30:40] Indonesia, but like whatever like the price of a small car

[30:44] Every time you want a new pinball experience is effing crazy

[30:49] I think more people should open up pinball arcades and barcades

[30:53] That way you guys can get your fix without the whole town having to go bankrupt buying pinball machines

[30:59] I don't think I've anything else interesting to say in this podcast before I lose all of you as listeners

[31:04] I'm gonna go to work see you later nits

[31:23] You
