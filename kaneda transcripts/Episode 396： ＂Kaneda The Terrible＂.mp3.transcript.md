[00:00] I know is pain, I know is pain

[00:03] Why do you lock yourself up in these chains?

[00:07] These chains, these no one can change life except for you

[00:13] Don't ever let anyone step for the truth

[00:16] Sing, sing, sing...

[00:22] Well I just got word that I am a terrible person

[00:28] That is what someone you talk to Jack today said about me,

[00:33] Canadian the Terrible.

[00:35] And it makes me wonder why I even do this show.

[00:39] And I'm just sitting here in my room in New York City

[00:41] wondering why I have done almost 400 podcasts

[00:47] about pinball.

[00:49] And yet when I go up to get the Twippy Award,

[00:51] people are booing in the background,

[00:53] ruining my entire evening.

[00:55] When I cover pinball manufacturers,

[00:58] I try to find the topics and I try to talk about these games

[01:02] and this hobby in a way that I thought was underserved

[01:07] before we started doing this show.

[01:10] And I think throughout all of these episodes,

[01:14] throughout these three plus years, I think,

[01:16] it's been almost three years now,

[01:19] in which we've been doing this show,

[01:21] we've tried to be fair and balanced

[01:23] about what's going on in the pinball hobby.

[01:26] Things you're excited about,

[01:28] things that are frustrating you,

[01:31] games that you think are great,

[01:32] games that you think are mediocre,

[01:34] and all of it has been put through the filter

[01:37] of my point of view on the hobby.

[01:40] And you know where I'm coming from, from day one,

[01:44] that pinball magic is the thing that we all should be aiming for

[01:48] and that pinball company should be giving you

[01:52] what you deserve for the high price of these games.

[01:56] And so here I am September 5th

[02:00] and I'm a terrible person.

[02:03] And I know why.

[02:04] I know why I'm a thorn in the side of some of these manufacturers

[02:09] and it would be very convenient for this show not to be around.

[02:12] I mean, think about it.

[02:14] Think about it.

[02:15] The majority of pinball communications before this show began

[02:20] was primarily shows in which everything was great.

[02:25] Everything was always awesome

[02:27] and it was just fans of pinball ecstatic

[02:31] about every new pinball machine coming out.

[02:34] And there wasn't nearly as many pinball companies.

[02:39] There wasn't the high cost of the machines

[02:42] that there are now and there weren't so many factors

[02:46] like there are today in pinball.

[02:49] And so this is Canadian, the terrible.

[02:52] This I am the worst thing to happen to pinball apparently.

[02:56] And when I go off on missions trying to bring to light

[03:01] issues that are affecting consumers

[03:04] who are spending a lot of money in this hobby,

[03:07] it means that I'm terrible, that I have nothing

[03:10] but sorted agendas.

[03:13] And when I change my mind on a game

[03:15] because it might not have the elements I'm looking for,

[03:19] that's not allowed.

[03:20] I'm a hypocrite, I'm a bad guy.

[03:22] No, I don't think I am.

[03:25] I think I love pinball just as much as you do.

[03:30] I played Batman tonight for an hour and a half.

[03:32] I absolutely loved it.

[03:34] Absolutely loved it.

[03:36] And there just comes a point when I'm really just wondering

[03:40] why I even still do the show.

[03:43] I had 2,500 people listen,

[03:46] but it's not always fun when you have to take all the arrows

[03:52] of the manufacturers who just refuse to engage me on any level.

[03:56] I've tried to talk to Jack.

[03:58] I sent him a note a few days ago.

[03:59] It doesn't want to talk to me.

[04:01] I tried to get official responses

[04:03] on certain things surrounding Willy Wonka.

[04:05] Never really got a straight answer.

[04:08] Zach Sharp treats me like a leprea.

[04:10] Never really gives me anything.

[04:12] Just always says he declines to talk to me

[04:15] every single time I asked to speak to anybody about a game.

[04:19] She go back and listen to all the interviews we did

[04:22] with Stern people back in the day.

[04:24] They were always very great, very informative

[04:26] and very entertaining.

[04:28] And you listen to pinball podcasts to be entertained.

[04:32] But see, the thing is this.

[04:34] The thing is this.

[04:35] I always said, I'll do this show because I enjoy doing it.

[04:39] I do this show on a weekly basis

[04:41] because I love talking about what's going on in this hobby.

[04:45] But I have to say when I hear Jack thinks you're terrible,

[04:49] it hits me in a way that makes me not want to do the show.

[04:55] Because I think I've called it pretty fairly

[04:58] on what's been going on with his company.

[05:02] Hasn't been personal.

[05:04] I have always said, I think Jersey Jack Pinball

[05:07] is aiming the highest.

[05:08] And Jersey Jack Pinball is trying the hardest

[05:11] to make the best pinball machines on the planet.

[05:15] And I still would put their games next

[05:17] to any other games out there.

[05:19] And I still would choose them for the money.

[05:21] Absolutely, absolutely.

[05:24] There's, and I've always said this,

[05:26] I think Jersey Jack games are worth $9,000.

[05:29] I don't think any Stern is worth $9,000

[05:32] when you put it next to it.

[05:33] And I think they would be the first ones

[05:36] to tell you that as well.

[05:38] But on this episode, I just got to say,

[05:41] you know, I'm sitting here and I'm just sort of

[05:42] philosophizing about why I do this.

[05:45] Like why I don't even know how much longer I want to do it.

[05:49] And I'm not going to go out in some blaze

[05:51] of glory right now.

[05:52] Don't worry.

[05:54] I might take a little break.

[05:56] It always comes to this.

[05:57] You know, my other podcast or friends,

[05:59] I think we're all feeling this right now.

[06:01] The hobby's been pulled through a little bit of a grind lately.

[06:05] A lot of the news hasn't been positive.

[06:07] A lot of the things happening to people

[06:08] haven't been positive.

[06:11] Of a wee bit in search of resolutions for you guys.

[06:14] And that's what I've been doing.

[06:15] And I don't mind taking the arrows in the back

[06:19] from the manufacturers and from the fanboys

[06:21] and the shills.

[06:22] If that means getting you a resolution

[06:24] and we saw some of that resolution

[06:26] started to materialize today.

[06:29] I saw that Jack was calling up people

[06:31] and refunding them their money on the play fields

[06:35] because no one should have to pay for a play field

[06:38] if they are shipped a game that has a defective clear coat.

[06:41] And that's good progress.

[06:43] Now do you think that would happen

[06:44] if we didn't keep beating their drum on this show?

[06:47] But I'm a terrible person for doing that.

[06:49] I'm a terrible person for looking out for consumer rights.

[06:53] I should simply be championing the companies

[06:56] so that they stick around.

[06:58] Okay?

[06:59] See, you know what the other thing I just felt lately?

[07:02] And I just want to be honest with you guys on this show.

[07:04] I know you listen to it for entertainment.

[07:07] I'm going to air the Dr. Frightner Larry interview

[07:11] sometime in the near future.

[07:13] I just didn't want to put that show up now

[07:15] because it's just more of me and him arguing

[07:17] about the merits of Willy Wonka.

[07:19] But you know what?

[07:20] I don't even want to talk about that right now.

[07:22] What I want to talk about on this episode

[07:24] of Can you just pinball podcast is just the grind

[07:28] of where I think we're at

[07:30] and why I think we're here a little bit.

[07:32] And here's a thing.

[07:33] For a lot of you out there, you might not be feeling this

[07:36] maybe I'm just in a different position

[07:38] because I put myself out there and I say stuff.

[07:41] And so I also I'm going to get blowback

[07:45] and this is blowback when manufacturers

[07:47] think you're a terrible person.

[07:50] But lately I just can't shake a certain feeling

[07:53] and it's not about Jack, it's not about George Gomez,

[07:56] it's not about Charlie, it's not about the manufacturers.

[07:59] It's just about where we've ended up

[08:02] and this sort of daily, weekly, even hourly analysis

[08:08] of pinball, it takes its toll on everybody

[08:12] who dives in deep enough into this hobby.

[08:15] And here's what I've just been thinking about,

[08:17] as we just got Jurassic Park and you hear

[08:21] some conversation about it,

[08:22] but we're already onto the next.

[08:24] It's already about what's gonna be at X,

[08:26] but what's gonna be here?

[08:27] What's gonna be guns and roses?

[08:29] What's gonna be toy story?

[08:30] What's gonna be deep rude?

[08:32] What is Chicago gaming going on next?

[08:34] And I can't help but feel somewhat

[08:38] of this entire hobby on some level

[08:42] is just collapsing a little bit under its own weight.

[08:45] And here's what I think happens.

[08:47] And it's a cycle.

[08:48] It's a cycle and om to blame.

[08:50] Other podcasters are to blame.

[08:52] Streamers are to blame.

[08:54] Everyone has a little bit of the blame

[08:56] and what I mean by that is this,

[08:58] we're in this vicious cycle.

[09:01] In the pinball hobby of over analyzing everything about it.

[09:06] It's a toy, right?

[09:08] And we over analyze it, we deconstruct it.

[09:10] We want it to be the best possible version

[09:12] of the theme that comes out, right?

[09:14] But it's a toy.

[09:16] And the way we look at these pinball machines right now,

[09:18] it's like every game is either the best game ever

[09:21] or the worst game ever at the same time.

[09:24] And there's like people love it, people hate it,

[09:26] people deconstruct it, people complain about it,

[09:28] people love the art, people hate the art,

[09:30] people love the callouts, people hate the callouts,

[09:32] people love the shots, people hate the shots.

[09:34] And it's just so much analysis of these damn things.

[09:40] And here's the thing, I gotta say this,

[09:42] we don't even give games a time anymore to become great.

[09:48] We don't give pinball machines time anymore

[09:52] to even win us over because none of it's happening naturally.

[09:57] The way it used to work is these games would go

[10:00] into our cage with absolutely no fanfare whatsoever

[10:04] about them coming out because here's why nobody

[10:07] even knew they were coming out.

[10:09] Games would just appear in an arcade one day

[10:12] when we walked in.

[10:13] There was no release date.

[10:15] There weren't a bunch of people wondering

[10:16] what's the next game from Valley Williams,

[10:18] what's the next game from Stern or Daddy East

[10:20] or this or that or Gottlieb or Capcom.

[10:23] It was a different time.

[10:25] These games were allowed to be worked on.

[10:27] They were put on locations to see quality control issues.

[10:33] It was so much different.

[10:35] It didn't have this obsessive following

[10:39] on podcasts, on forums, on Twitch streams.

[10:43] Games were allowed to be made and improved

[10:47] without this silliness of selling it to some obsessed

[10:52] group of people in limited edition form.

[10:55] And then hoodwinking those people

[10:57] because you're selling the same exact game

[10:59] they just bought for 9,000,

[11:01] you're gonna sell the same exact game for 7,500.

[11:04] And all of this is just stupid on some level.

[11:10] It's so stupid where we're at.

[11:13] What we basically are inflating the expectations

[11:18] of every single game and it has to live up to these ungodly,

[11:23] like unrealistic expectations,

[11:26] because why?

[11:27] Because the prices are so high,

[11:29] because people wanna put these things in their home.

[11:32] And because we just expect that every next game

[11:37] is gonna be an improvement and enhancement

[11:39] upon where we've been.

[11:41] And you don't get a chance for a game to become great.

[11:44] You don't.

[11:45] And I've been a fool too for like,

[11:47] well, is Willy Wonka gonna turn into the game?

[11:51] I don't know.

[11:52] I don't know if it is, I don't know if it's not,

[11:53] but I'm already like ready to get off.

[11:56] At the same time, people are already saying

[11:57] it's the best game ever.

[11:58] Listen to Zach Menny, it's best game ever.

[12:00] It's a best game ever.

[12:01] I put up any game.

[12:02] I put up any Bolly Williams game

[12:03] and Willy Wonka's better.

[12:04] And that's the problem.

[12:06] That's the problem.

[12:07] He's the blame, I'm the blame.

[12:09] You know, we have one guy saying,

[12:10] it's better than any Bolly Williams classic game

[12:13] that has earned the right to be a classic,

[12:15] because over 20 years, the games have held up

[12:18] and are still amazing.

[12:20] Nobody knows if Willy Wonka is still gonna be

[12:22] fun a year from now, but we're already.

[12:25] We're already labeling these things.

[12:27] Winners and losers immediately.

[12:30] And it just wears you down.

[12:33] It wears me down, it wears them down.

[12:35] It must wear you guys down too,

[12:37] who follow it day in and day out.

[12:40] We can't even give these games a chance to become great.

[12:44] We can't.

[12:45] And we're also, you know,

[12:47] games are shipping like sewing complete.

[12:49] So you never quite know when a game is done.

[12:53] I don't know if it was like that in the 90s,

[12:55] but I highly doubt that games went out on location

[12:59] so unfinished the way they are today.

[13:02] You know, games went out like we're still having

[13:04] code update seven years later for Wizard of Oz.

[13:07] There was no code update seven years later

[13:10] for medieval madness or for Adam's family.

[13:13] You know, they finished the game.

[13:15] They designed, manufactured and finished a game

[13:17] before they put it out there for people.

[13:20] It's not the way anymore.

[13:22] Where everything's constant beta,

[13:24] everything's constantly being, you know, adjusted.

[13:27] You never know when is the right time to go in on a game?

[13:31] You never know when is the right time

[13:33] to either call it a hit or a miss.

[13:37] And it's really difficult.

[13:39] You know, if you're a movie reviewer,

[13:41] I can go see the movie when it's done.

[13:44] And I can tell you if I like it or don't like it

[13:46] when it's done.

[13:48] I, the pinball is not like that.

[13:50] It's not like that.

[13:51] It's a very unique hobby in which we are all guinea pigs

[13:56] to trying to know what we're actually buying.

[14:00] And it's not right.

[14:01] It's not right.

[14:02] You shouldn't be paying these prices for games

[14:05] that are not finished.

[14:06] Batman 66 should not ever have been released

[14:10] until it was done.

[14:12] Two years people had a way to get the game finished.

[14:15] Why?

[14:16] Why did it release two years before it was even finished?

[14:19] Why?

[14:21] You know, we are all at the mercy of the manufacturing schedules

[14:25] of these companies, which means they're going to push out

[14:28] stuff regardless if it's ready to go to us.

[14:32] And that's an inconvenient truth that they don't want you

[14:35] to know about.

[14:37] But yet we still want the games.

[14:40] Right, it's been aggrined.

[14:42] It's been aggrined lately listening to early achievers

[14:46] with Stockholm syndrome.

[14:47] Have you read the EAs are the most empathetic and sympathetic

[14:53] to bury around this whole thing?

[14:56] The guy is a crook.

[14:58] The guy wants to do a Ponzi scheme economics.

[15:02] And people are forgiving him.

[15:04] People are cheerleading him.

[15:06] People are saying, let's give him a chance

[15:08] that the best shot he has.

[15:10] You know, and on top of what I was just saying

[15:15] about the overanalysis, then there's also just like the never

[15:19] ending second chances people get.

[15:22] I mean, we're about to see John Papadu get another chance

[15:25] at redemption.

[15:27] Will it happen?

[15:28] Will it not?

[15:29] I don't know.

[15:30] But I'm a terrible person.

[15:32] I'm a terrible person because I just want to see maybe the songs

[15:38] from the musical I love in the game.

[15:41] And you know what the thing is?

[15:43] I don't mind if it's not in the game.

[15:45] I don't.

[15:46] I don't mind Jack.

[15:48] I don't mind Joe if you didn't put it in the game.

[15:51] I'm not a terrible person.

[15:53] But just tell me when I ask you if you have the rights to it,

[15:57] don't refuse to answer the question or don't spin it

[16:02] and say something that's just, it's a yes or no question.

[16:07] And as consumers, all of us out there, right?

[16:10] But I'm getting ready to write a check for $12,500.

[16:13] Shouldn't I be able to ask them a very simple question like that

[16:18] without getting back an ambiguous answer?

[16:22] And yet that's what we got.

[16:24] And it's still ambiguous.

[16:26] Fine, I'm terrible.

[16:27] I'm sorry I asked that question.

[16:30] Let me just say I love it the way it is and don't question any of it

[16:33] or don't ask you what's to come in the game.

[16:36] It's just not fair.

[16:38] It's not fair that we can't ask questions without being labeled

[16:42] as negative people, as terrible people.

[16:46] Like we're cranky consumers.

[16:48] These games used to cost.

[16:50] I mean, if people just want to forget that too,

[16:53] it's almost like these manufacturers,

[16:55] they only want you to think about the here and the now.

[16:58] They don't want you to go back and just a few years ago,

[17:02] you could get a Lord of the Rings fully loaded for $3,500.

[17:07] They don't even want you to remember that.

[17:09] With better built cabinets, better mechanisms,

[17:12] much more magic on the play field.

[17:14] Let's not go there.

[17:17] $3,500 for Lord of the Rings.

[17:20] $9,000 for Black Knight sort of rage Ellie.

[17:25] Three times as much, with less than a third going on in it.

[17:32] They don't want you to know this stuff.

[17:34] They know they listen to this show.

[17:37] That's the thing is, I'm terrible.

[17:40] Never going to get an interview now from Stern for saying that.

[17:43] Never going to get an interview again from Jersey Jacket Seams.

[17:46] Never going to get an interview from American Pimball,

[17:48] though, Josh came on the show.

[17:50] I give Josh credit.

[17:53] I'm not here to hurt the Pimball hobby.

[17:56] I just have a few ideas every once in a while

[17:59] that I think would help.

[18:01] But I'm terrible.

[18:02] Maybe I should just stop hanging it up.

[18:05] I mean, we've got so many, so many other Pimball podcasts out there.

[18:09] You don't really need canada anymore.

[18:10] Do you people?

[18:11] If I were to just go away tomorrow,

[18:13] would you really even miss me?

[18:15] Seriously, would you miss me?

[18:17] You've got so many other things.

[18:20] You've got slam tilt.

[18:22] You got loser kid.

[18:23] You got Pimball nerds.

[18:26] You got poor man's Pimball podcast.

[18:28] Special win lit.

[18:29] This week in Pimball, head to head Pimball.

[18:31] Slap save Pimball podcast.

[18:33] Brodo even talk Pimball.

[18:36] The list goes on and on and on.

[18:40] All right?

[18:41] I'm just one dude in New York City who loves Pimball,

[18:45] who got banned from a Pimball form.

[18:47] And I just want to tell you what's on my mind.

[18:50] But you know, I'm terrible.

[18:52] Sorry.

[18:53] Sorry I did this.

[18:54] I'm so sorry, Jack.

[18:56] I am.

[18:56] I'm sorry that I changed my mind on Willy Wonka.

[19:00] Am I not allowed to?

[19:02] Am I not allowed to?

[19:04] I don't get it.

[19:06] I don't get it.

[19:07] And then maybe you don't want to listen anymore.

[19:09] Maybe this is an entertaining to you.

[19:11] Maybe you just find this to be one of the downer episodes.

[19:15] Come on, canada.

[19:16] Snap out of it.

[19:17] Like half thicker skin.

[19:18] And I do have thick skin.

[19:20] I do.

[19:21] I was hitting up my friend Christopher Franchini.

[19:24] He said, look dude, aren't you used to this by now?

[19:27] And of course I'm used to this by now.

[19:29] This isn't just in Pimball.

[19:31] This happens to me throughout my entire professional career.

[19:35] Sometimes people don't like me.

[19:38] They think I'm too abrasive.

[19:39] They think I just want to do things my way.

[19:41] They think I have better ideas on how to get it done.

[19:43] And I am where I am in my career because I do think I have

[19:47] good ideas and I have executed great ideas.

[19:50] And I have built great teams.

[19:52] I do great work.

[19:53] And I do surround myself with amazing people.

[19:56] And I've surrounded myself with some of the most amazing

[19:59] people in Pimball.

[20:00] The only thing they're not are the manufacturers.

[20:03] They don't want to be anywhere near me.

[20:05] They can't come near me.

[20:08] Even though I know, and you know right now, so many people

[20:12] who work for the other companies out there, the Pimball

[20:14] companies, they listen to the show.

[20:16] If you're working at Stern, Jersey Jack, Spooky Pimball,

[20:21] American Pimball, what would show do you want to listen to

[20:24] to hear what's being said about your company and in the hobby?

[20:27] Right?

[20:28] I mean, yeah, I could just cheerlead every single thing they do

[20:31] or I could call it like it is.

[20:33] I mean, I'm on great terms with Charlie Emory.

[20:36] Look at me times I've given Charlie crap for stuff.

[20:39] I mean, half the time he's probably like,

[20:41] Canadian's right.

[20:42] You know, I don't think I've called it unfairly.

[20:46] Would anyone listen to this show if I was just a terrible guy

[20:49] who unfairly and abrasively went after other companies

[20:53] and just attacked them senselessly?

[20:55] Is that what I do?

[20:57] All right, maybe I can't get Keith L. went on the show.

[21:00] Maybe I can't get like, you know,

[21:01] Bowen Carrins who just doesn't, you know,

[21:03] want anything to do with me and unfriends me for no reason

[21:06] or blocks me on Facebook.

[21:07] I can't even see what the guy does.

[21:09] All right, I know I pissed off some tournament players.

[21:11] I've known I've done some things that I've apologized for.

[21:14] But this last few months, in these last few episodes,

[21:18] where I really tried to stand up for like,

[21:20] what was important to you guys?

[21:22] And I tried to lead a charge because I felt like you guys

[21:25] needed a resolution on something that was very important.

[21:28] And I think we're starting to get progress.

[21:30] And you best believe there is no way these companies

[21:33] would be answering on this stuff as quickly

[21:36] if we didn't keep highlighting it, all right.

[21:39] And I don't think there's anything wrong.

[21:42] If you want to see more in a game

[21:44] that potentially could be put into a game

[21:47] to speak up and say you want to see more stuff in the game.

[21:51] What's wrong with that?

[21:52] These things cost so much money.

[21:54] We're allowed to have opinions about these things.

[21:57] There aren't always A plus and B plus, right?

[22:00] These aren't straight down the middle reviews of games.

[22:02] Like I think some games are great, some games suck.

[22:05] And they're all just opinions.

[22:06] We know that.

[22:07] We know that.

[22:08] I know Zach's like, you son of a you, you went after.

[22:11] My goddamn reviews again.

[22:12] Zach, I love you brother.

[22:13] And I love all the people in the pinball media.

[22:17] But what you guys need to know out there,

[22:19] listener of the show, and this is just the damn truth,

[22:21] is we get lied to a lot by people

[22:25] who are trying to protect their IP

[22:26] and protect their company secrets.

[22:28] And that's fine.

[22:29] But we get misled and we get misinformation

[22:32] and we get lied to on occasion.

[22:35] And it's not fun.

[22:36] And you just ask Jeff Patterson, the amount of work

[22:40] that Jeff puts into this week in pinball

[22:43] and then he gets lied to about certain things.

[22:45] And he'll tell you personally what those things are.

[22:47] But it's just, we do this for no money,

[22:51] for nothing other than your entertainment.

[22:55] OK?

[22:56] But I'll just say, when people want to personally attack

[22:58] can they define?

[23:00] Fine.

[23:00] Zach, fine.

[23:01] George, fine.

[23:03] I'll go away for a while.

[23:05] And then what's going to happen?

[23:06] It's not going to solve your clear code issues.

[23:09] It's not going to solve your lack of assets issues.

[23:12] It's not going to change.

[23:13] The problem you will always face is, I've

[23:17] existed for the last three years.

[23:19] People are starting to think more and more critically

[23:24] and scrutinize what they're spending their hard-earned money

[23:27] on.

[23:28] And you don't, they don't want that.

[23:30] You guys, it's like I was saying earlier,

[23:33] they want you stuck in that cycle of contempt

[23:38] where no matter what these companies do,

[23:40] you just run to it like a moth to the flame,

[23:44] where every new game is just the greatest game ever.

[23:47] And we deconstructed and analyzed it for two months

[23:49] and then no one cares about that game.

[23:51] Like nobody's talking about monsters.

[23:53] Nobody talks about, and there's some great games, right?

[23:57] Great games that just get missed.

[24:00] I'll give you an example of one of them.

[24:02] Like Deadpool.

[24:03] I hear so many good things about Deadpool,

[24:05] but it didn't even have its time to be in the spotlight,

[24:10] right?

[24:10] It just came and went.

[24:12] And yet, even though it's so good,

[24:15] it gets buried under a mountain of other releases

[24:18] and new expectations, and then you know,

[24:20] you own a Deadpool elite and it's like,

[24:22] well, so what?

[24:23] That's like yesterday's news.

[24:25] And that's just the problem I do.

[24:28] I think the problem is we can't slow down

[24:32] and enjoy these games.

[24:34] And games used to become sought after

[24:37] because they prove themselves over time.

[24:40] With so many games all aimed at the same targets,

[24:45] you know, these home collectors, it's really difficult.

[24:49] It's really difficult to process it all.

[24:52] And it becomes overwhelming.

[24:54] And I don't know, I think some other podcasters out there

[24:57] and you as listeners of the show,

[24:59] you might agree with some of this.

[25:00] Maybe you do, maybe you don't.

[25:01] Maybe I need to get off the soapbox tonight.

[25:04] But I just got to say, you know,

[25:06] when I was called a terrible person,

[25:08] by someone who I respect,

[25:10] I respect Jack and I respect everything

[25:13] they're doing over there.

[25:15] But I wish he would just respect my opinion

[25:17] about some of this stuff happening

[25:19] and not make it so personal.

[25:21] But when you call me terrible,

[25:23] I will take that personally.

[25:25] And it does make me not wanna do shows for a while.

[25:30] So I don't know what that means.

[25:33] You know me, I go away, I come back.

[25:35] I do this show when I wanna do it.

[25:36] And I don't feel like doing it really.

[25:38] I'm gonna upload the Larry show.

[25:41] I think you're gonna like it, Dr. Frightner.

[25:44] But you know what, it's my birthday this month.

[25:47] I'm going to Japan in October.

[25:49] I have a lot of awesome stuff going on in my life right now.

[25:54] And if you people wanna call me names

[25:56] and take shots at me fine, but you know,

[25:59] I've reached a point where I just don't feel

[26:01] like doing it right now.

[26:02] So this isn't the end of Canada's pinball podcast.

[26:06] I'm not even gonna give any timelines of anything.

[26:08] When a show goes up, a show goes up.

[26:10] I might do one tomorrow.

[26:11] I might wake up tomorrow and feel like it,

[26:13] but I'm just saying this pinball podcast,

[26:17] it's the inconvenient truth of this hobby.

[26:20] But nobody would listen.

[26:23] It's not, no one would listen if what we were saying

[26:27] wasn't resonating.

[26:29] And I still believe, and I still know that you know,

[26:34] there's more to come in this hobby.

[26:36] There's more magic out there

[26:37] that's not in these games.

[26:40] And what is the point of making a game?

[26:43] If you're not gonna make it right.

[26:45] I just, and I know that's subjective.

[26:50] But man, there are just some decisions that are being made

[26:52] and we are just all just accepting it.

[26:55] Like, oh, can't afford to have Jurassic Park movie.

[26:59] Yes, you can.

[27:00] For this much money, you can.

[27:03] You know, I was talking to someone today

[27:04] and then I'll just shut up and end this show.

[27:07] Let's say it was a million dollars more

[27:10] to get songs into Willy Wonka.

[27:12] Million dollars more, okay.

[27:15] That's $300 more game.

[27:18] Okay, at this price point,

[27:21] you're gonna sell two times as many games if it's in there.

[27:25] So maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.

[27:27] Maybe I just don't understand the financials

[27:29] of these companies and that is true.

[27:31] But just be honest with me.

[27:33] Be honest with your consumers.

[27:36] And you know, if you have issues, you gotta solve them.

[27:40] And if you're gonna make a game on a theme,

[27:42] you gotta put as much as that theme into the game as you can.

[27:46] And what's the point of having billionaire investors

[27:49] if you're gonna like cut corners on things

[27:52] people want in the games?

[27:54] What's the point?

[27:54] I'm not a billionaire.

[27:56] Heck, if I was a billionaire,

[27:57] we'd have every single movie ever made

[28:00] into Pimball Machines and I'd be,

[28:02] you carry me on your shoulders

[28:04] into the Pimball heavens.

[28:05] But anyway, that's just it.

[28:07] Canate the terrible signing off.

[28:10] Yeah, you might hear from me sometime soon.

[28:13] You might not later people.

[28:15] Don't you know, please don't change.

[28:17] Things will go your way.

[28:19] If you hold on for one more day, yeah.

[28:23] You hold on.

[28:26] Yeah.

[28:33] Don't you know, things will change,

[28:35] Things will go your way.

[28:37] If you hold on for one more day.

[28:41] If you hold on for one more day,

[28:45] Things will go your way.

[28:47] And I'll know that I will know that.

[28:49] Hold on for one more day.
