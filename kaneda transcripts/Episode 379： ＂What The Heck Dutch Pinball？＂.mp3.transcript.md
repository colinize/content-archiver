[00:00] Welcome to Episode 379 of Canada's Pinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada. And on this episode,

[00:25] we're going to talk to Mr. Ben Heck about what the heck is going on with Dutch pinball. And what

[00:32] is the likelihood that we will see more big Lebowski's made? You're going to love this interview.

[00:37] But before let's talk a little bit about pinball news and what's going on in pinball.

[00:43] Let me start out by first thanking a couple more people who have donated the Canada's Patreon page.

[00:50] I want to give a shout out to Mark Felt and Jeff S. Thank you, gentlemen. You get to

[00:55] lead the show because you showed your support to Canada's pinball podcast, truly appreciated.

[01:01] So first let's start out with a very interesting thread about pin stadium, spamming,

[01:08] pin side. Whenever you go on pin side now and you look up a game, I've always noticed this and

[01:13] I'm glad someone called it out. You are bum-barded with pin stadium ads and every single like

[01:21] linked to every single game and it's reached the point of just it's so silly. Like I'm so sick

[01:28] and tired of seeing pin stadium ads every time I look for anything pinball related because they

[01:35] linked these products to every single game every ever made like 18 times over. Now here's my

[01:41] thing with pin stadium. I think the product is great. I don't take anything away from it.

[01:46] There's no denying the fact that we're probably spending $200 plus dollars on an item that costs

[01:53] them $30 to $50 at most to make. Like it's insane the markup on a strip of LED lights with plastic

[02:02] over it. Insane, insanely overpriced. I'm also just shocked. I am shocked that the pinball world

[02:10] can't design cabinets that have a little bit of a groove inside the wood to put that strip

[02:17] of LED lights because if you've seen most modern games, the lighting is so piss poor. Like go play

[02:24] a Willy Wonka in a dark room. It's so bad. And yet when you put pin stadium lights into the game,

[02:31] it looks amazing. So here's the quagmire with the whole thing. It does a $250 $10

[02:38] strip of LED lights. Is it worth it because it wakes up your $7500 to $9,000 game? Absolutely.

[02:46] But that's besides the point. They need to stop spamming. It's not just pin sight. It's everywhere

[02:52] you go on Facebook. These guys advertise left and right because it's not expensive to buy pinball

[02:58] advertising. And I think they're making a small fortune on the profit margins on pin stadium lights.

[03:05] But I still love them. I still would have them in all my games. What can I say? All right. So

[03:09] speaking of accessories and mods, I got a question for you guys out there, the community out there.

[03:15] And maybe you'll agree with me. Maybe you'll disagree with me. But at what point does a company

[03:22] and a manufacturer protect the IP that it's spent a lot of money on when it comes to mods in the

[03:30] game? And what I mean by that is I just saw that people are designing, I think the mod couple

[03:36] and other people are designing Willy Wonka mods that are clearly infringing upon the IP rights

[03:45] that Jersey Jack pinball has paid for. And in doing so, mods are being created that I think

[03:53] take away two things. They take away the special nature of the more premium offerings from

[04:00] Jersey Jack pinball. And they also remove Jersey Jack's ability to make money on similar type mods.

[04:09] Money which they deserve to make because they are paying for the rights of that IP. And you have

[04:17] to look no further than people making God stopper shooter rods for Willy Wonka, right? Why should a

[04:26] mod person be allowed to make a God stopper shooter rod that is IP around the Willy Wonka franchise?

[04:35] And all of a sudden now, the God stopper shooter rod that is supposed to be on the collector's

[04:40] edition, which is a special little feature that only should be on that high end version of the game.

[04:47] Now everyone can put it on their game. And now, you know, the mod couple is not spending any money

[04:53] with Warner Brothers. They're not spending any money with Jersey Jack pinball. Now they're allowed

[04:57] to profit off of that IP without spending any money. Now, what are your thoughts on that?

[05:05] Should we allow, you know, people to do that? And I've been back and forth on this, right? Because

[05:10] back in the day, no one ever cared about going after people modding games. Like when people modded Lord

[05:14] the Rings, you know, they were going to buy like all the different toy figures and make all these

[05:19] mods and those things are also, you know, IP protected by the studio, by new-lying cinema.

[05:26] So I don't know. I'm on the fence a little bit. Part of me is confused to why companies don't

[05:32] understand that they could sell more mods to people and make the money themselves. Like Jersey Jack,

[05:38] Stern Pinball, Spooky, all of them should have a little bit of a mod division in which they make

[05:44] enhancements to the game that you can buy separately. And I think there's a lot of profit to be made

[05:49] there. But when I saw that Gobstop or Shooter Rod, I just said to myself, wow, like that sucks for

[05:55] Jersey Jack because now they're going to make all the Ellie games. Look, you know, almost as cool as

[06:02] the collector's edition games and every time you chip away at the specialness of the higher-end

[06:07] versions of the game, it makes it less special. There are a lot. I have to say this, there are

[06:14] a lot of Willy Wonka mods coming out and I just want to give people a little word of caution.

[06:20] Don't overmod this game. Don't go crazy. I think it looks stupid when there's an Oompa Loompa

[06:27] by the TV camera and then people are putting like chocolate bars, like big chocolate bars at

[06:32] its feet. Like why would he be standing on top of two chocolate bars? People are modding the

[06:38] smoke stack. People are modding the factory. People are modding, you know, they're putting

[06:43] Wonka's hat here and there. They're putting the tube that the kid gets sucked into. But here's

[06:50] the thing with all these mods. I'm all about, you know, changing things and making them look better.

[06:55] But for some reason, I always enjoy mods that are, you know, enhancing something that's interactive

[07:02] in the game and making something more than just sticking stuff everywhere. And a lot of these

[07:08] mods are just sticking stuff everywhere. So I'll give you an example. It's like in Lord of the Rings,

[07:12] when you mod it Gandalf and you put the Gandalf with the lightest staff and the staff actually lights

[07:18] up with the game. I mean, that's really cool. Or the eye of Sauron, right? And then they

[07:24] got the Palantir eye, right? When that mod was super awesome. But I think a lot of these latest

[07:29] mods are, they're just, it's just tacking stuff on everywhere. Not a big fan of that. I think it

[07:35] starts to look overcrowded and the stuff is just stuck there, but doesn't really do anything. All

[07:39] right. What else do I want to talk about? So have the problems. This is something that we might

[07:44] have to do a whole nother show on. The problems of play field dimpling, which leads to cracking,

[07:51] has that been solved. Because if you go into the Willy Wonka thread, people are starting to notice

[07:57] that the same thing that has plagued pirates of the Caribbean is also starting to plague Willy Wonka

[08:04] play fields. Now, it's not exclusive to Jersey Jack. Someone put up a photo of a Guardians of

[08:11] the Galaxy in which the same exact thing was happening around the different posts. It was starting

[08:17] to ripple. And that is not a good sign. So what, what's the issue here? Now that we've seen this on

[08:24] many games over the last few years, is it the play field manufacturer? Is it their problem? And

[08:31] they're sending the problem to the manufacturers. Are they over screwing the posts in the game and

[08:38] screwing them too tightly? Are they not letting the play field cure long enough? And they're

[08:44] rushing these games out. And that's the problem. Nobody really knows. And that's the problem. It's

[08:50] like a disease in life. It's like nobody really knows the cause of what is making these play fields

[08:55] do this. But it does have a lot of people concerned because if there's one problem, you do not want

[09:02] to get. It is a play field problem. The hardest thing to do is swap out a play field and a pinball

[09:10] machine. 99% of us are not qualified to do that kind of work on a machine. All right. So I really

[09:16] hope that the Willy Wonka thread does not turn into what the pirates of the Caribbean thread was.

[09:22] And then it all becomes about the quality control issues in the game. So let's see how things transpire

[09:27] there. A hilarious thing happened is one person is selling their Willy Wonka standard edition and

[09:33] people are like, oh my god, it's for sale already. It means the game's not good. No, it doesn't mean

[09:38] that you ding bats. There are going to be people who bought a standard edition Willy Wonka, who love

[09:43] it, who are going to trade up for a limited edition machine now that they're available. So I would

[09:49] not look at someone selling a standard as a sign that this game is not good. The price they were

[09:55] selling it for was $6,800. All right. What else is going on in pinball? We want to give a big

[10:01] congratulations to Keith L. Win for I believe defending his title at pinburg and hoisting up

[10:09] what has to be the biggest damn trophy in the pinball world. But super awesome to see Keith

[10:15] win at pinburg again. What's awesome about Keith winning and just think about this from in it.

[10:21] He's the best player in the world pretty much one of them. And he's also designing what people

[10:28] consider to be some of the best pinball machines in the world. And it's not you don't have to add

[10:34] those two things up to realize that Stern pinball has probably one of the most valuable people in

[10:41] pinball on their staff. And I think that's incredible because if you think about it, not only does

[10:46] he know how to design a game, he knows how to play pinball so well. But I would I think makes

[10:51] Keith special and I say this and it's the same reason why I think Lyman Sheets is special.

[10:56] It's the same reason why I dream about the two and then making a game together one day.

[10:59] The truly magical people in pinball, they understand how to make something rewarding for the professional

[11:08] players. But they also know how to make stuff rewarding for the casual player at the same time.

[11:14] And it takes a special kind of genius to combine that art and science, right, to get those things

[11:21] together. And I think Keith understands that like he knows what shots are rewarding. He knows what

[11:26] people will have fun playing and flipping. But he also knows how to make the game challenging

[11:32] with combos and different ways to approach the game that the higher skilled players will also enjoy.

[11:38] So he sort of gives both parties the best of both worlds together in one package. And I think

[11:44] Lyman Sheets is also similar in that he knows how to do that as well. He knows that a coded game

[11:50] in which you can immediately walk up to it and be satisfied with how you're progressing in a simple way

[11:55] or you could dive deeper and explore more of the game if you're a higher skilled player. And I think

[12:01] that's it's an art form. It really is an art form. So congratulations on that victory. Keith,

[12:08] all right. What else is going on in the pinball world? You know, not too much, not too much.

[12:14] A lot of debate around Dutch pinball, which we're going to talk about on this interview with Ben Heck.

[12:19] Let me read a couple of your emails. And then I'm going to air the interview. Sorry, this show is

[12:22] going to go a little bit over an hour, but it will be worth it. I've got an email from James

[12:29] and he writes October Fest and why it's a year round theme. Let's read this. He says, first of all,

[12:34] congrats on an epic podcast. How you manage to speak your mind with such clarity and consistency

[12:41] of purpose is incredible or great editing. Either way, it comes across concise and feels so much

[12:47] fuller than a man rambling on about pinball for the length of a show. All right. Well, first of all,

[12:53] I don't edit. So it's all just me. He goes on October Fest. I keep hearing people yourself included

[12:58] saying, Hey, man, why are we celebrating October Fest in July? Or this game has no appeal beyond

[13:04] October? Come on, really? The theme is an embodiment of that vibe, that feeling, that moment. I don't

[13:12] think it stuck in a box to be just for that time. No, it's a festival, but it's supposed to embody

[13:18] that feel and the good euphoria of what a festival is about. Good times, maybe a brewer too and being

[13:26] together. Isn't that why every pinball tries to do or what every pinball tries to do? It's an

[13:31] euphoric moment that you try to recreate. Remember the first time you dropped the shield and smashed

[13:37] a saucer and attack from Mars? Remember the first game you bought home thinking, what am I doing?

[13:44] This thing is way too big for a home environment. Remember the first time you smashed a jackpot in a bar

[13:50] and everyone looked up? That's what October Fest is going for. That feeling. So maybe beyond the

[13:55] actual nuts and bolts of, Hey, October Fest can only mean that point in time, we embrace it as the

[14:03] fun, feel good, lighthearted, jaunt, it should be and get on board for a game that should excel in a

[14:09] public setting should operators be brave enough to give it the square footage it deserves. Keep

[14:16] up the great work, buddy. We all love it. Even those that love to moan, especially those very

[14:21] best James, the UK pinball club. Well, James, look, I mean, you're right. I mean, look, October Fest

[14:27] isn't like Christmas or Thanksgiving. I get it to beer festival. The only thing is this James

[14:32] is I think you hit the nail on the head. Operators have to be brave enough to give it some real

[14:37] estate space on location. It's just not a theme. It's just not a festival. It's just not a moment

[14:44] that most Americans are really into. And that is why it just won't sell. I understand that there

[14:53] are October Fest festivals in America, but those things are very much tied to fall. And even though

[15:00] the game is fun and whimsical, the execution of it for some reason, it's not just what I say in

[15:06] this podcast. It's not resonating with pinball buyers. And for that reason and that reason alone,

[15:13] they should have thought about making something else. They need a hit at American pinball. All right,

[15:19] I got an email from Blade from Jay. He writes, Lebowski, Chris, the Lebowski machines are disgusting to

[15:26] me. How a company can resell machines over people who already paid for them is crazy. If you're

[15:32] buying the machine to turn around and make it profit from that same machine by selling it,

[15:37] you are no better than them. That's just effed up in a repugnant way to be in the hobby. Jay.

[15:44] All right. So Jay, I have your vote against flipping the big Lebowski. Dolly noted my friend.

[15:51] All right, Alan. Okay, Alan. I'm going to read your interview. Alan Robertson at another time,

[15:55] because it's too long. I can't, I want to get a short one. All right. All right. Another long one

[15:59] from Ben Crane. Guys, all right. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to make you, I'm going to do

[16:04] another, another podcast in which I read more of your emails. Here's a short one from David

[16:09] Rendon. And this is just something for you guys. If you want to email me, this is what I do. I don't

[16:13] edit this show. I don't take notes. I don't read your emails. I like to just open up the emails

[16:18] live while I'm recording and read them. So if you write me a mountain email, just think about that

[16:24] before you do it. Try to try to summarize your thoughts in a way in which I can read it on air

[16:30] without it being too laborious. All right. So David Rendon says podcasts love you man from Texas.

[16:36] I'm a huge pinball fanatic have been for many years. I recently got into podcasts listening.

[16:41] You are definitely my number one. Oh, I think I got another Twippy vote. David, remember,

[16:45] Twippy voting, Canadian pinball podcasts. He says in your opinion, what Stern Pro will hold more

[16:52] value in the next year? I want Elvira, but I would like a pinball machine in the meantime

[16:59] to trade in the future. All right. David, I think it's a really weird question. I'll explain why.

[17:05] You're asking me what machine you should buy based on what I think the resale value of it will be.

[17:12] What you should have asked me is Chris. What game should I buy? And I, that's a Stern pro. And the

[17:19] first thing I would say is buy the machine you enjoy. Buy the machine you would love to play.

[17:24] Don't think about the resale value. Now, if you are going the Stern pro route, here's the good news.

[17:31] They're not expensive to get into. And the other good news is they're not going to lose a ton of

[17:35] value. Stern pros are pretty solid in holding their value. You might lose like 400, 500 bucks,

[17:40] maybe a little bit more, but you'll easily play four to 500 games on it over a year. If I were to

[17:46] say right now out of the games that are out, let's just take those. If you wanted to get

[17:51] a Beatles, I say no way. You're going to lose money on the gold. If you were to get a

[17:56] monster's, I think you'd lose some money in that game. I think demand for that game is dying.

[18:00] If not dead. Jurassic Park is hot. I would really probably get a Jurassic Park pro. I think that

[18:07] one will stay in demand for a while. I don't know what a buyer is. I haven't seen a buyer. I

[18:12] don't even know when a buyer is going to be out. I would not recommend you get a game that you

[18:16] haven't even seen or played. That's the whole thing. The other thing is this. David, if you really

[18:23] want to get a game that will hold value, go look at a standard edition of a Lord of the Rings.

[18:30] If you want to go back, there are so many good Stern pros. There's a lot of games out there

[18:36] that go get a really cheap Game of Thrones pro, which shoots really nicely. I don't know,

[18:43] Black Knight pro. There's just games you can get that have already hit rock bottom. You won't

[18:48] lose much money if you just keep in a good condition. The world is your oyster, my friend. I would

[18:53] just recommend jumping on a machine, playing it, and get that game. Don't worry about the resale value

[18:58] of the game. We're going late here. This is going to go over an hour, which is not what I do.

[19:03] But let me air this interview. I think you're going to enjoy it. Everybody. Ben Heck talking about

[19:09] what the heck is going on at Dutch Pimball. I want to welcome back to the show, the designer

[19:15] of Jurassic Park, Mr. Ben Heck. Ben, welcome to the show. I didn't design Jurassic Park. I know,

[19:21] but I realized that nobody from Stern will come on the show, so I got to just falsely

[19:27] attribute these to my other guests. Oh yeah, Jurassic Park. It's the greatest game ever. You should

[19:32] buy it. That's me, the designer of Jurassic Park. There are other. All right, I sold. Where do I place my

[19:37] early order? No, Ben, the reason why I wanted to talk to you today is I want to talk about a topic

[19:44] that a lot of people are speculating on. That is Dutch Pimball and their ability to maybe one day

[19:54] remake the Big Lebowski. Yeah, I was trolling that forum as well. I definitely have some thoughts.

[20:04] I mean, I do have some experience with what it takes to get a machine going. So I was there once.

[20:11] So when you heard the news that ARA was going to sell the games that had been built almost three

[20:18] years ago. Were you shocked when you first heard that news? No, because it was inevitable.

[20:24] They're owned by ARA, but the thing is it's not like it's a load of gravel or a bunch of lumber.

[20:35] I mean, it's a pretty specific market if you have a bunch of Pimball machines as a commodity.

[20:40] So of course, they have to be resold to the community through CoinTaker because they're obviously a large

[20:45] distributor. So I wasn't shocked. It was inevitable. The way it was handled, how do you feel about that?

[20:52] I mean, there are those saying that the early achievers should have had first right of refusal.

[20:56] What do you think about that? Well, okay. Early achievers were in for like what, 8500?

[21:02] All paid up. Most of them. So yeah, so they're clearly looking for new money over old

[21:11] because they're pretty obviously in a pretty deep hole. I mean, we don't we have no idea how deep.

[21:16] So if you think about it, like if they need 12.5K per game no matter what, to like

[21:23] settle up with ARA or not even settle up apparently, but so they're basically like, hey,

[21:29] early achievers, the money you already gave us, it's like that South Park. Yeah, and it's gone.

[21:35] And we need 12.5K more for you to get a game. So what is that? 21,000. Yeah.

[21:41] So basically, yeah, they would they would have the first crack at buying a game for 21,000.

[21:48] And everyone else could get it for 12.5K. People would have gone nuts if they asked people to buy their

[21:56] game again for that much more. Yeah, and I mean, it sucks no matter what. But yeah, if you think

[22:03] about it that way, I mean, they weren't, I mean, well, aside from the money that Coin Takeer was

[22:08] holding an escrow, which is good because, you know, that means that money didn't get too touch

[22:12] from all. But it's yeah, I mean, people need to think about, okay, that's exactly what would have

[22:19] happened because it's not like they're like, oh, well, you already got $8,500 in. Yeah, they do,

[22:23] but that money and it's gone. So it doesn't matter. They they needed 12.5K per game. Right.

[22:31] To shore up. Now, Ben, before we get to like the logistics of trying to remake this game again,

[22:38] do you did you hear the story that way back when a array was making these games, they asked for

[22:44] 1,000 more euros per game from Dutch pinball and apparently that sent this whole thing into a

[22:52] tailspin. What what do you why do you think that happened? Well, I'm sure that the

[22:59] DPN probably also a array massively underestimated the cost of what it would take to get these

[23:04] spun up. Either that or this happens with kick starters, everything else. They're like the profit per

[23:13] game. You know, that's one thing, but they spend so much money in development that the money,

[23:18] the whole they dig themselves in development is much larger than the profit per game, even when

[23:23] the things got the door. So they're always behind. So they probably, you know, they're building

[23:29] that in, you know, Europe, which is not the cheapest place to build things, especially large things

[23:33] like that. And they probably just, you know, massively miscalculated it. Although if it was really only

[23:38] 1,000 euros more, which would be like what? While 1,000 were $150 US people would have gladly paid

[23:48] that. That's a lot better than asking EA's to pay 12.5 K more. Right. Yeah. Which makes that story

[23:56] always seem a little bit fishy because that was three years ago. And in hindsight,

[24:01] they all would have paid it just to get their game. I mean, when you hear from the early achievers,

[24:06] I mean, these are especially people who love this movie so much and really wanted this pinball

[24:12] machine. And they would have forked over that money. Now, it's weird that they were never even

[24:18] given that option. We just watched the whole thing sort of slow motion train wreck over three years

[24:25] of excuses, right? Yeah. We heard that it was an option, but also didn't that also involve

[24:29] a IRA taking 51% control of Dutch football. Right. And what do you think would have happened if

[24:34] they did that? If they would have done that, they would have immediately fired Barry,

[24:37] Yop and anyone else that was still involved with the company. And perhaps what the deal was was

[24:43] maybe they actually did need more than $1,000 per game. And they're like, okay, but if we control

[24:49] the company and the IP and the ability to make more of these games, we can sell more of them

[24:54] down the line and maybe recoup some money there. But I think part of the reason they stalled for

[24:58] so long is they had this DP had this dream of like, oh, they were the bell of the ball back in 2014.

[25:06] And then it kind of went downhill. So if they would have taken that deal, the game's probably

[25:12] would have had a much better chance of getting made because IRA, obviously, is a much bigger company

[25:17] than DP. So they actually would be, they would probably fulfill their end of the deal. But it would

[25:24] have ended the pinball dreams of Barry and Yop and whoever was left. And I think they were just

[25:28] they're too much pride to let that happen. Right. And also, IRA is a contract manufacturer.

[25:34] They don't want to be a pinball company per se, right? I mean, why would they want to do that?

[25:40] Like, well, the only reason for the money is right. But that's not their business model. It's not to

[25:48] hostile takeover, you know, their clients because their clients can't fork up the money. I mean,

[25:54] that's not really how it's supposed to go down, right? Well, a bank doesn't want to foreclose on your

[25:59] house. It's the last option. But, you know, if you get far enough in debt, they have no other choice

[26:06] but to do that. Right. The other thing is, yeah. And the other thing Ben is, all we know,

[26:12] all we've ever heard is one side of the story. I mean, it's Barry and Yop were communicating

[26:18] this stuff, right? We saw the newsletters like they wanted to take 51% of our company. We just

[26:24] couldn't do that. Right. And so we're going to go to China. Right. Remember that whole escapade?

[26:29] What do you think the chances were that they ever were going to make this game with what was

[26:35] Zaitek in China? You know what? Many, many years ago when I had a normal day job, I worked this

[26:46] place. And after I left, it kind of it went down the hill. What, you know, it was like, it failed. And

[26:52] I think I think it failed. And then they, one of the owners bought back as much of the equipment

[26:58] as possible at the bankruptcy option. Anyway, but so I didn't work there, but my friends still did,

[27:04] and they would tell me the stories and stiffing vendors and finding another vendor that you don't

[27:11] owe money to so you can basically rack up debt with them and then find another vendor. That is a

[27:16] sure fire sign of a broke ass failing business. And that's kind of what that Zaitek thing smelled like.

[27:21] I mean, the fact that they were going to China instead of like resolving something like in their

[27:25] own, you know, or at least in the EU. Right. That's that's pretty insane. And going to China, it's,

[27:32] you know, it's cheap, but it's not, it's not as easy as people think. And they're very,

[27:37] you know, it's, it's different over there. So what must have happened to because

[27:44] it seemed like they were out of money and they couldn't pay a array. Then they get these Zaitek

[27:49] partners on board. And they must have promised those people equity in the company, right? Some,

[27:53] some equity. Yeah. Because why, who, where did that money come from to fund that operation?

[28:01] Yeah, I'm kind of surprised that, you know, it's different if you find like some sugar daddy

[28:06] here in the States or, you know, like some angel investor. But it's strange that a Chinese company

[28:12] would be so altruistic about it. You think they would be like, where is our money, you know?

[28:16] Right. And maybe they maybe they were. So that whole thing, we don't really know much about that

[28:21] at all. But apparently that died on the vine as well. With the little array sued them and is like,

[28:27] wait a minute, like you can't, you can't do that. We've invested all this money. We've,

[28:33] we've built these games. You can't not pay us. And then, and I think that's what shut down the

[28:39] Chinese manufacturing was the lawsuit. So ARA sued DP for unpaid invoices. I said, okay.

[28:49] So why didn't they knock on the door of home pin? Yeah, that would be your first stop. I mean,

[28:56] it's like, oh, look China. It's cheaper. Hmm. Who's already making games over there? And I mean,

[29:01] there are things about Thunderbirds that are cheap. But, you know, it's still basically a pinball

[29:07] machine. You know, it's the general idea is there. We're flipper buttons inside. Yeah, that would

[29:14] have made more sense. Or as you've said many times, like why not talk to like American pinball or

[29:19] or somebody else. Yeah, but they wouldn't even have had to have cheap in the game. You know,

[29:24] Thunderbirds was being designed to be a much cheaper game. Lebowski was not. I mean, they already had

[29:29] all of the parts designed and engineered. So really, you know, just one thing back up a bit. I mean,

[29:36] if you're talking about like when DP was flung and around like a fish 2016, 2017, home pin hadn't

[29:42] even released Thunderbirds at that point. So maybe that that's why it may not have been seen like

[29:47] not. No, no, you're right. And they would have been better off if they never released Thunderbirds. But

[29:53] I digress. So, okay. So then we get to this period in which there's almost no updates for a long

[30:00] time. Then they rock up to Texas pinball festival. They have a plan, Ben. And it's to sell you

[30:08] a new version of bride of pinbott. Oh, yeah. So I was there the year they showed that. I remember it

[30:14] well. Right. And it was well, so you know, surprisingly priced at $12,500. It seems that

[30:20] that is they've done some market research. That's just as much as we can get away with when we

[30:26] know we're trying to do this. It was new money. You know, over old, they clearly needed it. And

[30:33] you know, who in the right mind says, you know what this pinball machine needs less of? It needs less

[30:39] Python, Angelo art. Let's replace that. Right. Yeah. And they were making that game also. Well,

[30:48] remember they said I think they were making that game at a array. And a array had like the prototype

[30:53] of it and wouldn't let it go. And so then they were trying to redo it in China. It was the whole

[30:59] thing. Just sound it like more of a mess. Yeah. The art package was terrible. I mean, that would

[31:06] well clearly, you know, they were fishing. But you know, if it looked good, it might have worked. But

[31:12] you know, Brite of Pimbot isn't really, I mean, the Brite of Pimbot 2.0 kits really cool. I

[31:18] think that's I thought was very impressive. However, Brite of Pimbot as a game isn't really, you

[31:23] know, that sought after. I mean, it's cool. Right. Okay. So then we fast forward to this most recent

[31:30] event in which we get a newsletter from Barry in which he says, here's the deal. You know,

[31:36] we lost the lawsuit. But I was able to sort of reach a gentleman's agreement with a array that if

[31:43] we sell these new games or those 40 games at 12,500, those games will go to new buyers. I will,

[31:51] it doesn't clear their debt completely with a array. But somehow they'll also be given parts for

[31:58] 100 additional games. Now, how does that work, Ben? How, why are they giving those parts if the

[32:04] debt's not clear? Then what leverages are a have if they give Barry back everything? That,

[32:09] that is really strange. Because, but I have, I have a few theories on that release basically one

[32:16] like, like 100, if it's 100 games for the parts, all they said it doesn't include cabinets,

[32:21] which is actually cabinets are more expensive than people think. But still 100 games for the parts,

[32:27] even not including cabinets, that's a lot, you know, that's a lot of money. That's probably like

[32:31] at least half a million in parts. So it's possible that some of the sunk cost or the outstanding

[32:37] balance could be in those parts, right? Right. So, so it's possible that by selling, oh no, I'm

[32:44] giving legal advice without a license, it's possible that by reselling the 40 games, you know, for

[32:51] 12.5 K, maybe that money didn't necessarily go just for those games, or maybe it also went for

[32:57] the parts, because it sounds like ARA probably was the one who ordered the parts as well on behalf of

[33:03] of Dutch pinball. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, but the numbers just don't ever add up, right?

[33:10] Because like even if you have those 40 games that, you know, let's say they're not 8500,

[33:15] because that's that was retail. Let's say it cost ARA, let's just say hypothetically 6,000 per game,

[33:21] right? But it could have cost more than 8500. Right. We don't know. So let's just say hypothetically,

[33:26] it's 6,000, they're they're bomb or you know, the cost per game for ARA. Yeah, I'm sure that's what

[33:32] they were aiming for. 240,000 dollars, right? Now Dutch is getting 500,000 dollars from these new

[33:41] buyers. So, I mean, that starts to paint a picture of what you're describing. So maybe, maybe they're

[33:47] giving 200,000 dollars for those games, maybe 300,000 dollars is going for the parts with an IOU of

[33:55] whatever the additional money is that I bet this is what Barry told them. Look, give me the parts.

[34:02] I will give you half a million dollars now. Give me those 40 games in the parts. I'm going to make

[34:07] 100 more games at 12,500, which will net me. That's probably the math he's doing, right? Yeah.

[34:15] That nets him one one million, like 100, wait, one million, $250,000, right? Yeah,

[34:23] ostensibly. But to your point, okay, let's talk about the logistics of that promise, right?

[34:31] He's got to make 100 cabinets for this with no money yet. Yeah, that's, you'd probably,

[34:39] for a game like that, I mean, remember, that was a very well made game. I mean, you'd probably

[34:42] looking at at at least a thousand dollars a cabinet, probably more like 1500. Okay. So then to do

[34:50] that, just put in that order, he to do anything, he needs to preorder money. He needs to presell these

[34:58] games. Right. So who knows? Maybe, again, we do not know how in debt he was, but perhaps, you know,

[35:06] this new thing, you know, like, oh, he gets, you know, half a million dollars for these 40 games.

[35:11] Maybe that, maybe he uses that to, you know, he needed, let's say he needed 300,000 dollars to

[35:16] settle with ARA and then he's going to need to other 200,000 dollars to buy the cabinets to put

[35:21] these parts into. That's possible. Although if he's still in debt to ARA even after this transaction,

[35:28] I would think he probably isn't making any profit or have any liquidity yet, you know,

[35:34] cast that he could use to, you know, buy cabinets or whatever else. You know, even before the logistics

[35:39] of building games, when you were talking to me earlier about the red flag being, you know,

[35:44] someone is in debt to a vendor who moves on to another vendors is a huge red flag of,

[35:49] of financially being like, at a control. Yeah, you're basically getting in debt to vendors and

[35:56] using them as like banks in a way. There was another pinball manufacturer. Let me, let me see if

[36:01] you can guess who it was who did not pay their rent and would simply move on to another factory.

[36:06] And then not pay that rent and move on to another factory. And he guesses who that was.

[36:12] Oh gosh, I think I know it's a highway pinball. And you're highway did the same thing.

[36:20] Okay, so here's the thing then. Let's talk logistics. Let's say he gets the cabinets.

[36:28] Where can he set up assembly of a game like this? That's a good question.

[36:34] I mean, you know, houses and residences are smaller over there. Like, you know, you can,

[36:42] I mean, you could almost maybe do it in like a large American garage, you know, like at a

[36:46] McMansion. I mean, because spooky started out barely bigger than that. But like how many games

[36:51] are we talking? Okay, so then you have like just the way how it is. Where do you put 100 cabinets?

[36:57] Where do you put up with? Yeah. So where do you put 100 cabinets, 100 bowling alleys, 100

[37:03] rugs, 100 of play fields, right? There's a lot of stuff, right? When we see stern pinball and we see a

[37:08] real like a Jersey Jack and a real assembly line, it always seems you need space. And you also need

[37:17] employees to put these games together in a quality manner. Do you think, I mean, he can't do it by

[37:24] himself. He's then got a salary people and get, yeah, isn't it isn't one of them like it'll

[37:30] or something like you got cancer or something? Yeah, Yop is he's out. He's out. He's he's his

[37:36] his cash return. He's not coming back to the company. So then Barry needs let's let's do a list

[37:41] of what Barry needs. He needs a miracle. He needs. Okay, that is a good way to like describe it all.

[37:47] Sorry, go on. Yeah, no, he needs pre-order money. He needs a factory. He needs workers. He needs

[37:59] you know, he needs to make sure he has all the parts required. That's the other thing too,

[38:03] is does he have every single part needed? Because we know it only takes one necessary part to

[38:11] exactly. And then you're you can't build them. And then some of their stuff, remember they had

[38:15] custom LCD glass cut, which is not a trivial thing. So they and that bronze wick a bowling mechanism,

[38:22] which I know we've argued about this before, but I honestly think they should have

[38:25] costed that out as soon as things started to go south. But yeah, I mean, yeah, if you have if you

[38:30] have one thing missing, you're done. That's the hardest thing with the manufacturing of

[38:35] imbal is not just supply chain, but you know, keep well keeping your supply chain moving. It's

[38:39] like a war, you know, you're not going to get to Germany unless you have a whole line of gas tanks

[38:44] behind your behind your tanks. Right. And he's also got zero credibility. Right. And yet the

[38:50] factor that in there's zero confidence now in this company. And so yeah, I mean, you have to do

[38:58] an American pinball where you find some people that don't know how to use Google. Right. So

[39:05] here's what I think is only shot is. I think is only shot. And I've said this before,

[39:10] is if another pinball manufacturer that has credibility is willing to take on this project.

[39:18] But then there's another big if like how do you solve this? And you know what that is? It's like

[39:24] but then how do they make those hundred plus people who already spot the game? How do you make

[39:32] them whole again? You've got to sell like hundred to twelve thousand five hundred. Did you

[39:39] ever see that the coolest cooler on Kickstarter? It was a it was a it was like a cooler that you

[39:46] take to the beach or whatever. But for whatever reason, it had a blender built into it and it had

[39:52] it had actually had a refrigerator element so it could keep itself cold and a radio and Bluetooth

[39:56] and some other stuff. It was a big smash hit on Kickstarter, right? But of course surprise surprise,

[40:04] they underestimated what it would cost to build it, right? So that thing has been a it's been you

[40:09] can buy one on Amazon right now. It's been for on retail sale for years now. And they're still trying

[40:16] to you know, collect up enough profit to fulfill the original backers. Right. So it happens in a lot

[40:24] of different situations and that's like a $350 cooler. And of course, you know, we know how it is

[40:29] like in the real world like, you know, you sell someone a $60 video game. And if it's not eight hours

[40:34] long, they're going to bitch and mow and act like the sky is falling. So these pinball people are

[40:39] lucky that pinball people for whatever reason they have the patience of Job even with this huge

[40:43] huge purchases. Yeah, I don't the thing is you know, when you talk about paying back an investor,

[40:50] right? If you're like, Oh, I've got another money, you know, for whatever project. Let's say it's

[40:53] pinball. And each pin after I do everything, I make 2K profit. Well, the 2K profit, that's what

[41:01] pays back the investor, not, you know, the the gross, you know, cost of the pinball machine, right?

[41:08] So yeah, I mean, even if you have a profit, yeah, if you make $2,000 per game, but you owe, you know,

[41:14] people a $6,000 game that means you have to sell like three games to build one game for a back

[41:19] customer, right? And then if the money is going to paying air, air a debt, it's not going to the

[41:27] new cabinet manufacturer, it's not going to your new employees, it's not going to storage costs

[41:32] for all these parts. I mean, it's just the list goes on and on. So I don't know how there's making

[41:38] a hundred games, even if they got, even if they have or find the capital for cabinets, and even if

[41:45] they have a place to put all this stuff, even if they had like 10 employees, it would take years

[41:52] to do that. And I highly doubt they can afford any employees, you know? Like, I mean, in theory,

[41:58] one person could just sit there and, you know, build cabinets until his debts are repaid, like that

[42:03] story about the woman and the fake necklace, you know? But it would be years and years, right? And

[42:09] then that person isn't paying themself, right? Right. And, you know, and then, you know, it's in the

[42:16] EU, so you probably have like console tax and national insurance and all that stuff, like, you know,

[42:22] you know, the government's going to want its tax, you know, if you're just sitting there,

[42:25] if you're making something, but you're not being made any, making any money, they're going to be

[42:29] like, what's going on? Right? You're like, you basically would have to turn yourself into an

[42:33] indentured servant. Right. So out of all the PIMMOL manufacturers out there right now,

[42:40] if one of them was keen on waking up to perform a miracle for the early achievers,

[42:46] who would make the most sense to bring on this project? Deep root would make the most sense because

[42:54] they're throwing money around like a drunken sailor. Right. But I guarantee Robert would not be

[43:00] interested because I could just tell you that doesn't seem like a theme that he'd like, you know,

[43:04] because he just cares about art. Well, he also in one of his correspondences said that he approached

[43:14] them with, oh really, with a scenario that apparently just didn't work out or they couldn't come

[43:23] to any sort of agreement. But he is making, well, it was probably the same kind of thing where he's like,

[43:30] I'll take this burden off your hands, but now, but then you're done. So you think the same

[43:36] rather like, no, we can't give up our dreams. Well, that's what it's, that's what it comes down to,

[43:39] is like, Barry and Yop had a dream and they failed to execute that dream. And now everyone has to go

[43:48] down with the ship in a way and except for 40 lifeboats that are going out into the world that are

[43:54] saving people who were not even on the ship. Oh, you mean a array like those 40 games are going to go.

[44:03] So let's talk about that because you know that I have one on order. I also do know that are you

[44:09] and Brenda going to start sleeping under your games? I mean, you live in Manhattan, right?

[44:13] I'm right around. But what do you think about the people who bought one of those 40 games? Are we

[44:18] morally reprehensible scumbags or are we just taking advantage of an opportunity? And it's not

[44:25] our fault, but it's still just Dutch pinball's fault for putting, you know, the games for sale that way.

[44:35] I don't really feel any any one way or the other about someone that would take that deal. I mean,

[44:41] let's face it, we live in a capitalistic dog eat dog world. And you know, I think anyone given the

[44:46] chance would go for it. I mean, you know, like all the I or towards John Papa to go over the years.

[44:52] If he makes a really beautiful functional magic girl, people won't care, you know, they will they'll

[44:58] plunk down their money. Yeah, the thing is, yeah, it might seem they Dutch pinball did sell the games

[45:07] twice. There's no doubt about that, right? But it's Dutch pinball that are screwing the EA's not the

[45:14] new buyers. You know, if I if I hire a guy to fix my garage and he buys a bunch of lumber or orders

[45:21] a bunch of lumber and the contractor runs away with my money, I'm not I can't go to the lumber yard and

[45:26] say that's my lumber because it's not, you know, it was the contractor that screwed me not the lumberyard.

[45:31] And I think just the fact that it's a pinball machine, which is a very specific thing rather than a

[45:36] generic commodity is why people and those are going to sound awful, but you know, have a sense of

[45:40] ownership and they do take it. Oh, yeah, but they don't because you know, here's a thing if DP would

[45:48] have built the games themselves and not relied on an external contractor, like you said George Gomez

[45:52] talked about years ago. Right. Then it would be then it would be an entirely different situation like

[45:57] then if they were selling games twice, I think what people would be even more pissed off. Right. But

[46:02] people need to realize ARA is a separate entity. And you know, I remember like when, you know,

[46:06] it was really going down everyone's like, oh, ARA is evil. Bob, blah, blah, you know, they're the bad

[46:10] guys, you know, the typical kind of stuff. And it's like, well, they're they're a contract manufacturer.

[46:14] And if you don't pay them, then they're not going to build you anything else, you know, it's like,

[46:20] it's just like we were talking about like rents or vendors like, you know, I could skip a few months

[46:24] with my electric bill, but eventually they're going to come after me. You know, you can,

[46:28] you know, it's and why wouldn't they? Because I owe the money. Yeah, I think what's painful for people

[46:33] also for the early achievers is they just know whoever had number, whatever like 51 to 90.

[46:43] Yeah, that's their game. Like they might be removing the plaques to avoid. That's a funny move,

[46:50] right? They're removing those plaques to avoid complete like in your face, like I sold your

[46:57] game to somebody else, but everyone knows they are. Exactly. So let me ask another question

[47:04] as a pinball speculator is someone who flips the big Lebowski for a profit. The biggest scum on the

[47:11] earth. See, you're trying to get me to make you feel better about your decisions. No, I'm not,

[47:21] I'm not, I'm not sure what I'm doing. I, I, I think that's kind of what you're doing. But that's

[47:26] okay. I'll still answer. Well, people are already flipping those games for a profit. I mean,

[47:32] what was it? Was it was it predatory where they're talking about like selling the games and

[47:37] dividing it up and giving it to all the people? I mean, right. That that's equally ridiculous. I

[47:42] mean, right? And like unless you actually have like some sort of judgment against a company,

[47:46] like a class action lawsuit and only lawyers win those as you probably know, it's kind of silly,

[47:53] you know, it's like you're trying to get blood from a stone. Right. And you know, there's,

[47:57] there's predator games out there too. And I was like, ooh, predator. I mean, same thing like with

[48:01] that, like, you know, Kevin would have never been able to make that many games anyway. He would

[48:06] have run out of money as well. But, you know, the people who are probably the most pissed that he got,

[48:10] you know, ratted out to Fox are probably the people like with like game 20 or 30, right? That would

[48:16] have gotten one if it wasn't for you meddling kids. Right. Right. So I think that

[48:23] there's this was never going to end in a situation in which people felt good either way. And I

[48:29] think to your point, the buyers of these 40 games, they won't, they won't really care. I know,

[48:35] I know a bunch of them who are buying this machine. And they're, they're just happy they're getting

[48:40] a machine. They same thing with like magic girl, if it comes out working, people will buy it,

[48:46] they would, they people have revision revisionist history when it comes to like these calamities.

[48:53] But if the games available, like all that goes away and hey, I got my shot and don't, you know,

[48:57] don't point your finger at me because you would have done the same thing. How much do you think these

[49:01] games will go for? Well, you know, it sounds like D.P. is trying to keep the dream alive. And I think

[49:09] that's where people maybe need to like think a little bit more realistically. We're just talking

[49:14] about 100 games. How do you build them? Where do you build them? How do you ship them? Blah blah blah.

[49:19] You know, that's a lot of work. So it's like, oh, well, this is the first step to finally getting

[49:23] the early achievers their games, which is we talked about, you know, with the math, even if they

[49:27] start building games again, like that is so far down the road, right? And if you see that so often

[49:33] with especially Dutch pinball, like they keep, you know, metering out little bits of hope, right?

[49:37] Like, oh, there's hope, there's hope. So same thing, like if this was the end for Dutch or the big

[49:44] Lebowski, of course, the games would appreciate past 12.5 K because, you know, cactus Canyon is

[49:49] worth quite a bit. They made a lot more of those than 90, right? Right. But if as long as Dutch pinball

[49:55] keeps acting like there's a chance, well, I'm of course technically there is a chance, but that

[50:00] might keep the prices kind of low. I think it would take some sort of catastrophic end point for the

[50:06] price to actually start going up. It's just like the like the remakes. It's like, oh, you know,

[50:10] there's this, you know, theater magic is not going to go up to hot wow. It's kind of quite a bit,

[50:14] but you know, it's not going to go up too much higher because people know that, you know, sooner or

[50:18] later, it will be remade. So cactus Canyon, there's one sitting on eBay right now for $20,000. Guys

[50:25] never going to get it because we all know that games next. Well, you know, it's like Sunshine Laundry

[50:31] has theirs in the F and window. It's not nuts. I know. Well, they he has a diamond edition.

[50:38] He wanted to put his magic girl out on location, but John designed the game where you can't,

[50:43] it won't work for operators because well, that guy has a he has a supreme on location. Yeah,

[50:49] he's got supreme. I mean, Peter's crazy. I mean, I love him the death. He puts, he, he,

[50:53] anything's an operator game. I mean, he has, I think he has two the big Lebowski's and they're both

[50:58] broken, which yeah, that's the other thing. It's, I mean, I've heard that it's not a super reliable

[51:06] game. There's like flipper lag and they have all those circuit boards underneath the playfield,

[51:14] which kind of is questionable. And yeah, I mean, that's, I'm out while the alien people have

[51:19] been solving that. Like I think that's awesome. How the alien buyers are like helping each other

[51:23] design. They're making the they're making the game better than Andrew did, right? Absolutely.

[51:28] Well, you we didn't even talk about that, right? So you've got an unreliable game. It is an unreliable

[51:35] game. I mean, it's there are there are only 40 out in the world and and they have issues. And we

[51:41] know this for a fact that Dutch Pimbal with feedback from coin taker was making significant changes

[51:49] to the boards in that game with the Chinese version. We instead of like that one big that will never

[51:55] see right that will never see. So knowing that and knowing these games are being sold somewhat

[52:02] as is there is a desire for buyers of these 40 games to buy spare parts. Now Ben, I would assume

[52:12] that Barry is not completely moronic and understands that those parts those spare parts he has,

[52:21] he could sell them for a fortune to the 40 buyers of these new games and even the existing buyers.

[52:28] So like he's got 80 people with with games in homes. Right. But then again, there go his dreams of

[52:34] building games. But how much would someone pay for spare rug mechanism or spare bowling alley?

[52:42] Yeah. The thing is I'm sure most of the parts in that are standard Williams mechs. So really,

[52:49] it's yeah, it's like the bowling alley or the rug. Those are the one of things that are like really

[52:53] proprietary or the car that pops out. But everyone you sell used is chipping away at the 100

[53:02] you know, and eating away at that one point two million dollar potential.

[53:07] That yeah, that does remind me of something I was going to see a little while back. We talked about

[53:13] like you know, ARA having 40 games then having apparently a hundred games with the parts, right?

[53:17] And why would they part with the parts? A complete game is very easy to sell, right?

[53:24] Parts are a lot more nebulous. They're not well, you know, actually as parts, they're worth it or

[53:30] the yeah, but as as parts think are worth more than some of their parts, but they'd be easier to sell

[53:36] if they were in in the form of a complete game, right? Because you have to wait you have to wait for

[53:40] a rug to break, right? Before you can sell a rug Mac and you know, how often is that going to happen,

[53:45] right? But if you had a hundred games itself, just like we saw boom, they're gone like in a heartbeat.

[53:50] Right. So he doesn't have enough of a of a buyer base, right? To sort of

[53:58] correct. Yeah, it's like I'm just going to sell these things as parts. Well, what you what you

[54:03] probably do is you'd sell them for a lump sum to like come all life or someone like that. But yeah,

[54:07] I mean, it's the same thing like, you know, actually that would make that would be the most logical

[54:10] thing to do. But then again, it's what is if you if you do like a flow chart, that ends up in my

[54:15] pinball dream is over. And it seems like there's a lot of choices that would actually have a better

[54:21] resolution, but they ended my pinball dream is over. And but of course, he can always make another

[54:26] pinball machine. Although, and then people people were saying this is why years ago, they should have

[54:32] just sued Dutch pinball and forcibly removed barriany up from the operation declared bankruptcy

[54:40] call it a day sort of all of pinball brothers and drew highway, you know, company like that's what

[54:45] they did. They they they realized it wasn't going to work. They bankrupt did it. And then they

[54:50] moved on. And that doesn't mean we won't see alien again. But it just means that no one who is

[54:56] owed a highway alien machine will see their game. I mean, highway built a lot more games than the Dutch

[55:02] did. I mean, they got they would did like a hundred and eighty or something like that. Yeah, well,

[55:06] that's when because I had the aliens, the money and flux from pinball. Remember, pinball brothers

[55:11] were very, very wealthy men behind the scenes. These were the original investors in highway pinball

[55:18] from the very get go. Yeah. So people forget that. And these guys had bruised egos.

[55:24] And they're they're still going to they haven't they haven't stopped. Yeah. No, I mean, you're right.

[55:31] Alien has not been abandoned. That that ship has not yet sailed. So we'll I mean, I don't it'll be

[55:38] back. But going back to the Dutch thing, you're right. If they would have if it would have been

[55:44] some sort of shareholder thing or I think even like this, some parts of the EU were if a business

[55:48] isn't enough debt, you can actually force bankruptcy and like, you know, stop, you know, stop the

[55:52] bleeding, you know, pay out what you can and you're done, you know. And you're right. I mean,

[55:57] it would have been better. It's it's kind of like, you know, like a like an undiagnosed, you know,

[56:02] medical condition. It's better to catch it early and stop it because yeah, look what's happened.

[56:06] You've had these things in storage for three years. You've had three years of inflation,

[56:10] making the making the original money or parts value worth less. And you know, it's only gotten

[56:15] worse because of the time they've wasted. Yeah. And I've and I've always said it. I just wish

[56:20] they would just pull the plug. I mean, this thing has been on a dialysis. Is that it? What's the

[56:27] machine they put you? What's the machine they put you on to keep all your I don't know what

[56:31] organs functioning, you know, a machine whose plug can be pulled machine. Yeah, my sister would

[56:37] I just feel like they they continue to use this false hope to prevent people from suing because

[56:46] then that's the funality of it all. It's it's over. You're never going to get your machine if you

[56:50] do that. And I think yeah, and Andrew highway used these exact same tactics. I mean, he would sort

[56:57] he would blame me like he blamed this podcast for his business failures. And it was like my god.

[57:04] And meanwhile, the people who are closest, I mean, look at hindsight right now. How how much better

[57:11] off would it have been if when remember when Philgate happened and he refunded everyone's Dutch

[57:16] pinball money because he realized, well, we sold a lot of America's most honours that week. So

[57:24] right. So if I mean at the very beginning, it seemed like these are not that makes that makes me a

[57:30] that makes me a scumbag too. Why? Well, because that money went into my pocket. But so like,

[57:36] but half this room was paid for because of Philgate probably was. Well, look, sorry. Do you think

[57:46] we've all learned a lesson? You think pre-ordering is dead for good? It seems to be. I mean, unless,

[57:53] like Spooky still does it, but you know, Spooky's delivered. But as far as the new company doing it,

[57:59] like, yeah, I'm like, look at Deeproot. I mean, Deeproot has serious cash behind them and still,

[58:03] you know, they're like, hey, you know, you can order the game when you see it. Right. So let's talk

[58:08] let's talk for a few minutes. Let's even like just one more thing, even Kickstarter, like,

[58:14] you know, Kickstarter was, you know, it's Apex's fire like 2012, 2013. Even that has come down

[58:20] a long way. It's like the bloom is off that rose as well. Right. Because like 80% of them fail.

[58:25] Okay. And the ones and the ones that succeed are always late. Let's close the door on Dutch by

[58:33] summarizing that it would take a miracle. Because of everything we've just said on this podcast to

[58:39] get more games made. You agree with that? Well, you would just take, you know, some rich person who

[58:44] likes pinball. I mean, I don't think, you know, it wouldn't, it probably wouldn't cost that much.

[58:49] You could probably save it. Well, again, we don't know the state of their debts. But, you know,

[58:53] half a million dollars would probably go a long ways. Yeah. But, but who, again, you know,

[59:00] there's probably only so many really rich people in the world who also love pinball. And, you know,

[59:06] to put the money in and, you know, they've probably gone to Deeproot or Jack or whoever. So, right.

[59:13] Okay. So a miracle, a European miracle. If it was over here, their chances might be better if

[59:19] they were in America with all those parts and all the different companies here that could do it.

[59:22] Yeah. That's the thing because I'm sure most of their customers are here as it is, you know.

[59:27] And then, you know, if you didn't Chicago, you know, Chicago was essentially located. There's a reason

[59:31] it was a manufacturing hub. I got to tell you this. I'm glad the games are at ARA because if those

[59:36] games were in America, people are showing up at ARA with some shotguns and demanding their game.

[59:44] Yeah. I mean, I guess that makes sense. Although, I don't know, I have, I have, it would have been,

[59:51] it would have been cheaper to make them here no matter what. I mean, let's face it, even a state

[59:55] like Illinois is cheaper than the EU. Right. So they should have, well, as George Gomez says,

[01:00:01] they shouldn't have done contract manufacturing. But then they have to, well, you know, Charlie did

[01:00:06] it and he started out slow. He just, he's have to take your time. But maybe they were drunk on

[01:00:10] their own cool aid. I remember that they were, you know, they're the lords of all creation at,

[01:00:15] you know, what was it? Pimball X, but 2014. And you know what, I'm sure,

[01:00:20] that presidential suite probably wasn't that expensive. I mean, that party was probably a very small

[01:00:25] drop in a very large bucket of their problems. Right. Okay. So let me ask you a few questions.

[01:00:31] Just non-secretary questions about what's going on in Pimball and just give me quick answers. Okay.

[01:00:36] What's going to sell better? Willy Wonka or Jurassic Park? Probably Jurassic Park.

[01:00:44] Because it's cheaper. I saw there's a cheap pro. Okay. I mean, I don't know how well has Wonka sold?

[01:00:51] I mean, I don't know. I mean, it's still early on. Okay. What, do you think Pires of the Caribbean

[01:00:56] will ever be remade? No. Why not? Licensing. It's, and it's from Disney. Two strikes you're out.

[01:01:06] Okay. It's the same thing with Big Lebowski. I mean, I can't believe that license is still active.

[01:01:12] Right. It should have, if it's 2013, it should have expired twice by now. Right.

[01:01:19] Another problem with theirs. That's gone. Do you think out of these two bands,

[01:01:24] which one would have a more popular selling pin? Motley crew or guns and roses?

[01:01:29] Well, guns and roses is more mainstream, isn't it? Yeah. I would say guns and roses. Although they're

[01:01:36] already had a pin. Although Motley crew did have a Netflix show about them. So maybe they're back in

[01:01:42] the public zeitgeist. Well, guns and roses is still touring. I mean, they neither lead singer is

[01:01:47] aged well, but Axel's managed to keep the money machine going where Motley crew not so much these

[01:01:53] days. Vince Neil just looks, oh my god, bad. Well, you know, of course, just like Errol Smith,

[01:01:59] everyone's going to like, you know, have a connection fits and you know, oh god, they can't put

[01:02:04] Axel Rose 2019 on the back glass. And of course, they won't. Right. Right. It's so dumb.

[01:02:11] All right. Next question. Out of the four American pinball titles, Valkyrie, Poker Run,

[01:02:19] Sherlock Holmes and Robin Hood. Which of those would be the best bet for them?

[01:02:26] You mean the least worst? Yes. The lesser of four evils. Oh, god. Actually, how about how about

[01:02:34] worst to best? Definitely not Poker Run. What was the other one? Oh, hold on. Robin Hood is also

[01:02:43] terrible. I mean, we've seen that in Hollywood, like the Robin Hood myth, nobody cares anymore.

[01:02:48] You know, it had a good thousand years. It's done. Right. Valkyries. I mean, does every person know

[01:02:56] what a Valkyrie is? I mean, it's Tessa Thompson. I mean, it's in the, you know, Thor universe,

[01:03:02] right? Isn't that the Valkyries are the wind warriors? It's North mythology.

[01:03:09] Uh, Sherlock Holmes. I mean, what is it you're like, again, I don't think a lot of people sit down

[01:03:17] and think about what would actually be in a pin. Like, I think that would jaws, right? It's like,

[01:03:21] jaws has one monster and a boat and a sheriff who spends half the movie painting signs. Like,

[01:03:27] how do you translate this into modes? Right. Well, Sherlock Holmes is like, oh, I've got clues,

[01:03:31] and I'm talking to someone, and I'm being witty. Like, right. I mean, nobody says who done it is

[01:03:36] the greatest pinball ever. Right. And Sherlock Holmes too. It's like, it's fun in movie format and

[01:03:42] book form because you're, you're unraveling a mystery slowly. But once that mystery's unraveled,

[01:03:50] it's kind of like how many times do you want to play that over again? Like, yeah. Actually, you know

[01:03:55] what? If they gave it like a heavy metal art style, Valkyries could work. But then you'd have,

[01:04:01] you know, oh, God, there's too much cleavage or, you know, some outrage like that.

[01:04:04] But you mentioned like a heavy metal pin. I mean, wouldn't that be awesome?

[01:04:09] Yeah, I'm surprised we haven't had like, I mean, is that one like Iron Maiden is?

[01:04:16] I guess, yeah. But you know, you want like the heavy metal like art, like the sexies.

[01:04:20] Yeah, there needs to be like women on flying bird things and like,

[01:04:25] spacemen and yeah, heavy metal. Of course, it would be based off the movie, not the comic books.

[01:04:30] But right. Well, Elvira might satiate those who are looking for a little bit more sex appeal

[01:04:35] on the games. All right, deep root. This is not even a question. Let's, let's end the show with

[01:04:40] deep root because they're coming out in November. What do you think? You think, Rod?

[01:04:45] That's the news. November is the new June. It's the new June.

[01:04:53] Oh, yeah, right. No, the deep root was, well, no, March. It's supposed to be Texas, remember?

[01:04:58] Well, yeah. And then June was the date by which

[01:05:01] Zidware customers were supposedly guaranteed to have games. June of 2019, we've blown past that.

[01:05:11] It's now and now we're hearing.

[01:05:13] In ball is hard. Again, look at, he's got all that capital and you know, he's behind

[01:05:19] what hope does Barry have? I mean, Robert? No, no, I'm talking about that. Oh, yeah. No, Barry's

[01:05:26] I know. Right. But what people don't realize about deep root. It's so, it's like, it still boggles my

[01:05:33] mind that people can't understand that deep root. Pimball is part of deep root funds, which is an

[01:05:40] investment company where the money from the investment company is what is paying for the

[01:05:46] Pimball venture. And that they have outside investors. I mean, that's whose money they're playing with.

[01:05:53] Yeah, it's instead of like Pimball enthusiasts, it's like a bunch of rich dentists.

[01:05:58] Yeah, and Robert promises a return and part of the money is going into the Pimball venture.

[01:06:05] But they're always making money. I mean, I don't like, I don't know. It always seems too good to be

[01:06:09] true that there has, it would seem silly that you'd have a Pimball arm of an investment fund that

[01:06:16] is spending, spending, spending, and nothing's coming in. I mean, there's going to have, there's

[01:06:20] going to have to be a point where the rubber meets the road and we see, you know, if they can make

[01:06:25] this a viable business model. He's definitely investing in talent. I mean, he's not

[01:06:31] kidding around. Right. So what do you think the expectations around this are just too high now for

[01:06:39] this to be successful? Well, the longer they're delayed, the expectations might be tempered by

[01:06:45] that actually. You know what I mean? People might not be expecting the moon and the sun anymore.

[01:06:50] They might be like, oh yeah, they're running into the usual problems. And because have they even

[01:06:55] gotten to the manufacturing part of it yet? Because that's the really hard part. Yeah. I mean,

[01:07:02] so they're supposed to show retro atomic zombie adventure in Houston arcade expo in November.

[01:07:09] I think if they miss that, they might be in, well, I mean, think about it. And if they have

[01:07:17] investors, of course, I wouldn't want to be accused of giving legal advice without a license. But

[01:07:22] you know, I think it's pretty obvious. Like, if you have investors, they have, they expect

[01:07:26] to return or at least they expect to see something happen in a certain amount of time. So,

[01:07:30] ultimately, you're answering to them, not the Pimball public because it's the investor's money

[01:07:36] that you're using. But at least in that case, unlike Barry Yop, Andrew and other people,

[01:07:40] you know, it's all SEC filings, it's all by the book. So, you know, you will answer to the

[01:07:46] investors right at the end of the day. I mean, do you think we're going to see a five days of

[01:07:52] deeper? I don't know. I mean, honestly, you know, if they are that behind, they're probably

[01:08:05] scrambling to get Raza showable for Houston. So, that's probably their, you know, that's probably

[01:08:11] their main concern right now. Okay, we shall time, time will tell. My last question, Ben, I only

[01:08:17] let you go. What's your future in Pimball? What do you want to do? Well, I did design a new

[01:08:25] controller board with my friend Parker, the same person I designed the previous Pinhek driver board

[01:08:32] with. So, that's something that I actually just did recently and the idea is to make an affordable

[01:08:38] Pimball machine controller for the people, right? Yeah, so that's something that I've been working on

[01:08:44] and we actually just got it working, got the boards in and tested it last week. So, that's pretty

[01:08:49] cool. And, you know, I'm a big fan of like classic Apeic computers. So, I think of things like

[01:08:55] Commodore or the ZX Spectrum from the UK and I'm like, the real winners were whoever were the

[01:09:00] cheapest, right? Right. And so, that's the mentality that we try to take with this sort of thing.

[01:09:06] Um, yeah, so right now that's pretty much the only thing that I have done regarding Pimball

[01:09:12] lately. And then the last Pimball machine I worked on was Al Scoopers, Nightmare Castle. So,

[01:09:16] now do you want, do you want back in the game? You want back on the court? You know, I, that's,

[01:09:23] yeah, I would like to, you know, I would like to finish the game I was working on because mostly I

[01:09:27] want to see how much better I could do, you know, because I did a homebrew game, Bill Paxon Pimball,

[01:09:33] and then I made a lost fan game which sucked, we tore it apart, then I made America's most haunted,

[01:09:39] which, you know, was good enough to start spooky. And I'm like, okay, how much better can I do,

[01:09:43] right? And like now there's actually more resources. So, I kind of, that's what I miss the most,

[01:09:50] or I would like to say how much better I could have done, you know, at least one more game to see,

[01:09:55] you know, to see where, if I plateaued yet. So, right. How are you in Chuck D's,

[01:10:00] are you guys talking or are things better? Yeah, yeah, I actually, actually visited them last week.

[01:10:06] So, we haven't fought in a while. So, yeah, yeah, I did feel, and he bought me,

[01:10:14] oh, you were talking about Meatloaf. He found a Streets of Fire soundtrack record at a swap

[01:10:19] meet, and so he bought that for me. Streets of Fire is the William Hills flop movie,

[01:10:24] follow up to the Warriors, which has like a Jim Steinman soundtrack.

[01:10:29] Tonight is what it means to be young is the greatest song of all time. Of course.

[01:10:33] Yes, you know exactly what I'm talking about. I had the biggest Jim Steinman fanatic, you know,

[01:10:38] people don't realize it. You watched that movie, and you actually had Ryan Lane's in it.

[01:10:43] Yeah, and she's like 19, but he's not credited in the movie, right? And like years ago,

[01:10:49] Charlie was talking about the movie because he hadn't seen it. And I'm like, there is no way

[01:10:54] those aren't Jim Steinman songs, right? And so, you dig a little deeper and then sure enough.

[01:10:59] Yes, and the songs are incredible. I mean, the guys, I'm still convinced he's the greatest composer

[01:11:06] in human history, but... What I think is cool about Jim Steinman's music is, well,

[01:11:12] people should know, but Jim Steinman is the one who wrote like the music and lyrics for Badad of

[01:11:16] Hell and Badad of Hell too for Meatloaf. But even what he's done stuff for other artists, and it

[01:11:22] doesn't matter who the artist is or what their style is, you always can, you can just smell it.

[01:11:28] You know it's a Jim Steinman song. I mean, he wrote totally clips of the heart. Yes, air supply,

[01:11:34] right? Making love out of nothing at all. And the Celine Dion had one too. I mean, he's all coming

[01:11:39] to Celine Dion. It's all coming back to me now. And he also wrote, I need a hero, which is Bonnie

[01:11:44] Tyler's other hit. Yes, I mean, I think that's what's so cool about him. It's just like,

[01:11:50] it's just like when you hear someone on the radio, like Ed Robinson's a great example, like,

[01:11:53] you know, his voice is so distinct, you immediately know that it's spirit-iccad ladies.

[01:11:57] Right. Same thing with Jim Steinman's music. Right. Well, Ben, always a pleasure having you on the show.

[01:12:03] We'll do this again soon. It's going to be a great fall. We get to see Wonka versus Jurassic Park.

[01:12:08] We got a Vira. We got Deepru Common. We got Guns and Rose is coming at the end of the year.

[01:12:13] It's going to be an exciting time in Pimball. We hope you find a new home in Pimball because I think

[01:12:19] you bring an energy and a passion. And you're connected to the community, which I love. I mean,

[01:12:24] I feel like you're in it. We want to get you back on the court. So any help I can do, just let me know.

[01:12:29] Okay. Yeah, I even need to buy games again. Like I sold my games before I moved. So I need to

[01:12:33] I need to start filling my basement back up. Do you want to apply it to the Caribbean?

[01:12:36] Clicked as an addition. I got one. I got to either pay for or move on very quickly. No, if I bought

[01:12:43] anything, I'd probably just ask Hilton because he has so many goddamn games. So he did he ever

[01:12:47] build that bunker of his? He wanted to build a bunker on your ground.

[01:12:55] I don't know about that, but I mean, hopefully doesn't think this is doxing him, but like his whole

[01:12:59] basement is filled with games on end, folded up. Like he's got so many games. So I mean, I'd probably

[01:13:06] ask him if he wanted to sell me a game. So yeah, he's going to wish those were

[01:13:11] were stocks certificates in 20 years. I will say one thing. I mean, I know like people on

[01:13:17] Pinside rag on him and you rag on him, but you know, he he operates a shit ton of games all over

[01:13:22] Madison. He's spread so much pinball around like he's really, you know, he's he's grown it

[01:13:27] immensely around here. So, you know, and he buys every new game. So when he talks about what earns

[01:13:32] on route and you know, what does well and what the kids like, he knows. I mean, he he lives it.

[01:13:37] He's got all the data in the location. No, I mean, he look he he knows how to troll Pinside and

[01:13:43] you know, push people's buttons and he's doing that with effort. Not like I don't think he's a bad guy.

[01:13:49] Don't don't we all push buttons with effort? Absolutely. Go on these forms. I mean, these guys who

[01:13:55] like are earnestly on there spending all their life. It's sad. Like it's you should go on there

[01:14:01] to like stir the pot a little bit. It's a freaking form full of dudes talking about

[01:14:05] dim ball. Come on. That's that's why your podcast is successful because you know that it's all

[01:14:10] about the drama. It's entertainment. Like you should not go there for for like earnest reasons.

[01:14:18] Unless unless you need, you know, some troubleshooting tips, but that's, you know, whatever.

[01:14:23] I like to watch I like the restoration threads. I mean, I think those are cool. But I mean,

[01:14:28] otherwise it's like, okay, what's a new game? What's the latest scandal? What's some technical advice?

[01:14:33] Like what else would you really need to learn? Right? I know. Look, I bought a stern machine. Batman

[01:14:39] 66. It's had zero issues for two years. Like it's just it just works. Yeah. Yeah. So what is left?

[01:14:46] But the drama. I know. I know. Anyway, Ben, always a pleasure. Have a great evening and we'll talk to you soon.

[01:14:54] All right. Sounds good. All right. Later.
