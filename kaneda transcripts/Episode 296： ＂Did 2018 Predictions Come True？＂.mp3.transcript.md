[00:00] Well here we are, it's the final show of the year, not the final show ever, the final show of 2018.

[00:24] And it's that time of year when so many of us are looking forward and looking backwards.

[00:30] And I know that a lot of us want to try and predict what is going to happen in the Pimbal World in 2019.

[00:37] And we're going to do that. We're going to have a show in which we do our predictions.

[00:41] What I want to do on this episode though is actually go back a year and see how accurate

[00:48] it can be.

[00:54] And this is going to be a fun episode because we're going to go back to January 5th of 2018.

[01:05] The beginning of the year and we did a podcast, it was me and Ted, and we predicted what we thought would happen in the Pimbal World throughout 2018.

[01:15] And what I want to do is I want to just see how accurate we were as we look towards 2019.

[01:22] Was this Pimbal podcast pretty accurate and on point when it came to predicting what would happen?

[01:30] And you know, you know me, I like to feel that I've somewhat of a grasp on what will happen in this hobby.

[01:37] So what we're going to do on this special New Year's Eve edition of Knai to Pimbal Podcast is we're going to play what my prediction was from a year ago.

[01:46] And then analyze on whether or not we think that came true.

[01:50] How does that sound? We're going to jump right into it.

[01:52] Alright, and we're going to do it by manufacturer. Where should we start?

[01:56] Let's start with American Pimbal.

[01:59] Number one, American Pimbal, Houdini, go.

[02:03] Fantastic. I think it's going to be a humongous hit for them.

[02:07] Okay. Perfect. We're going to go into the second.

[02:10] So my prediction is this. I think Houdini is going to be a Pimbal machine that people want to buy.

[02:17] I think people are not going to want to wait a year to get it.

[02:22] I think they have like a four to five month window to get the machines out the door before people's desire to own a new machine moves on to a new tight on.

[02:34] Alright, we're going to stop there. So if you remember a year ago, Houdini was barely getting out to customers.

[02:40] I think they sent out one unit before the new year just to say that the game shipped in 2017.

[02:47] And so my prediction was that there was going to be demand for the game and that they would have to get people their titles pretty quickly before people's demands moved on to other titles.

[02:57] How accurate do you think I was in that prediction?

[03:01] I will say that after an entire year, I think it's fair to say that Houdini, the response to it and the success of Houdini,

[03:09] and the success of the game has not been that strong. That it was pretty much a lukewarm reception to Houdini within the Pimbal community.

[03:20] You know why that was for the most part. I think people probably felt the game was too difficult to frustrating.

[03:28] And then also what happened is because it took a long time for people to get their games.

[03:35] People started selling their games on the second hand market for a decent discount.

[03:40] And once games start selling for a thousand dollars cheaper than a new inbox version, I think people sort of pumped the brakes and said, hey, I don't really need it.

[03:50] There's nothing limited about the game. They're going to keep making it. And I also can go buy the game on the second hand market and save myself a lot of money.

[04:00] It also showed that people who are buying the game were willing to get rid of it pretty quickly, which is another red flag that it's not a game worth owning.

[04:09] And I think we can chalk up Houdini as just being a mediocre first effort from American Pimbal. I don't think most people would disagree.

[04:20] And I think I was wrong. I think I thought there was going to be more demand for the game because of all the toys and features in the game itself.

[04:27] But ultimately, I think this podcast was a little overly optimistic about the reception people would have for Houdini.

[04:37] So I think that's were 0 for 1 on our predictions. I think this one's an interesting one. We're going to go to Stern.

[04:44] And I'm curious to see if you think I was right or wrong on Stern Pimbal in 2018.

[04:49] Here's my prediction. I think Stern is going to have one of its weakest years in history. And I'll explain why.

[04:56] So if you think about the year prior, let's talk about the last 12 months of Stern releases.

[05:01] 2017 Stern was like hot selling Ghostbusters Batman and Star Wars.

[05:08] There is no way Iron Maiden, Deadpool, and maybe Monsters or maybe like Pulp Fiction. I don't know.

[05:17] These titles have nowhere near the cashier or the demand that Ghostbusters Batman and Star Wars does.

[05:25] I think here's my prediction. I think Stern really got Star Wars wrong.

[05:31] I thought they thought Star Wars would sell well into 2018 and demand would be much higher than it was.

[05:38] I still think that game is a mess. I think Stern is going to have a lukewarm year.

[05:43] And here's why. I think Deadpool is a title that doesn't speak to many Pimbal collectors.

[05:50] And I think that that game is going to struggle. I think Iron Maiden gets you even more into like a niche rock group.

[05:58] I love music. I love major rock acts. I couldn't even tell you an Iron Maiden song.

[06:05] I think Guardians of the Galaxy will ultimately be like a mess in Stern's world.

[06:12] Again, I think that game and I think the way Stern handles a launch of it and the WWE armor and just throwing songs in late.

[06:23] Those aren't the kinds of themes that Pimbal fanatics want.

[06:28] Pimbal fanatics want jaws. Well get us jaws. Pimbal fanatics want.

[06:34] Nostalgic titles that like they have like an almost like an emotional and indelible attachment to.

[06:43] I think Monsters is niche but has emotional appeal for people. So I think that title will do well.

[06:50] Alright, wow. That was a lot. Right. There was a lot the process there in my assessment of Stern Pimbal in 2018.

[06:57] And I said I would I thought it would be a lukewarm year for Stern. What do we think about that? Was I right or was I wrong?

[07:04] And I think what's difficult whenever you're sort of analyzing Stern Pimbal is there's two ways to look at it.

[07:11] There is how well will the new titles sell in 2018? You know, and the new titles were and we didn't know all of them at that point when I was doing that podcast.

[07:21] We knew that Iron Maiden would be a machine. We knew that Deadpool would be a machine. And that was it.

[07:27] We kind of knew Monsters was in the works. We weren't sure that it would come out in 2018.

[07:32] We had no clue that Beatles was actually coming out in 2018. We had no clue that Primus would be out as well in that year.

[07:40] We had no clue about supreme Pimbal in that year as well. Right. So if you were to look at it from when I did that podcast.

[07:49] It was Star Wars Ghostbusters and Batman versus Iron Maiden and Deadpool.

[07:55] And looking at those themes alone, my prediction that they wouldn't have a great year because those themes wouldn't be as appealing.

[08:03] How did I do in that prediction? And I have to say I probably underestimated the power of Keith Owens design in Iron Maiden.

[08:12] I think the response to Iron Maiden was super strong. It was stronger than I imagined it would be.

[08:18] And again, we didn't know that it was going to be an archer risk in at that point.

[08:23] So I was wrong on that. I think I was accurate on Deadpool not being the juggernaut of Pimbal.

[08:31] Right. I think the response to Deadpool has been a little mediocre. It's probably sold decently well.

[08:38] But again, when we look at the response to the L.E.s and the premiums and the amount of people unboxing Deadpools, I think that is going to be chalked up as a B-level title for Stern.

[08:49] And they know that too. It's not a cornerstone release. We never really got a fourth quarter cornerstone game from them.

[08:56] So did Stern have a lukewarm year in 2018?

[09:02] I would have to say I probably was off because I've heard from people at Stern that they had a phenomenal year, one of their best years ever.

[09:10] And they probably did because remember, they're still selling to customers, Batman. They're still selling Star Wars. They're still selling Metallica.

[09:19] They're still selling so many games, ACDC, Lucie. Right. The Stern ability to offer you eight to ten games in box throughout the year means that even though their newer titles might not pop as big as some of their older titles, it doesn't really matter.

[09:40] Right. Because they still can get you those older titles new in box into your home. So from a business standpoint, I think Stern had an incredible year.

[09:50] But I will say I do think that there are last few releases have not blown people away. And we're not seeing sales of Deadpool or Iron Maiden or Guardians of the Galaxy.

[10:02] We're not seeing those games sell as well as games probably like the Walking Dead, Metallica, ACDC.

[10:13] Again, I think that the newer titles aren't lighting up the sales charts. And here's the hard part is we don't know. I don't have any sales numbers to say I was right or wrong in terms of the reception of these titles.

[10:27] All I can really go off of is the number of unboxings I see the number of L.E.s that sell out. But for the most part, for the most part, 2018 was a very good year for Stern.

[10:39] It might have been their best year financially and that just might be because of the expansion of buyers. But I don't think the titles in 2018 will go down as some of Stern's best games ever.

[10:51] Caviot being I think Iron Maiden rises above the rest. But if we look at the other titles of 2018, I think we could safely say it was in Stern's best release year to date.

[11:03] Is that fair? You agree or disagree? Let me know. All right, who should we go to next? Well, here's another thing I predicted in 2018 at the beginning of the year.

[11:12] L.Vyra is not coming out in 2018. All right, we finally got one 100% correct that there would be no L.Vyra 3 in 2018. So what does that make us right now?

[11:26] We are definitely got American Pimbal wrong. I think we also probably got Stern wrong in the sense that the company had a bad year because I think they did have a good year.

[11:36] But I would still say Stern were some on the middle. So let's just say we're one for two right now on our predictions of what would happen in the Pimbal world in 2018.

[11:46] Now let's move on to the next prediction.

[11:49] Okay, so here's my prediction for Chicago gaming. I think Monster Bash when revealed at Texas Pimbal Festival is going to be a jug or not hit.

[12:00] I think with the new screen, new play field, new topper, I think this game is going to sell out faster than attack from Mars remake.

[12:12] I think there's way more in Monster Bash that makes it more interesting than attack from Mars. I think this game is going to be a ginormous hit.

[12:21] So if you want a Monster Bash, like I would get in on one early.

[12:26] Oh, like I feel like I was so close to predicting this one. But remember when we did the show in January, Chicago gaming company was supposed to be at Texas Pimbal Festival with Monster Bash.

[12:38] How wrong I was. Everybody was off on this one because they were so delayed. We did not see Monster Bash remake until expo in October.

[12:51] Right, like eight months later we got the game. And so I was completely off. I was completely wrong. And I also think besides the delay was the demand for the game as high as I thought it would be.

[13:05] Right, did the L's of Monster Bash sell out immediately? And I have to say, I think I was wrong to there. I don't think people ran to this title the way I thought they would.

[13:18] Simply because I think the delay of revealing the game really had an impact on people's enthusiasm to jump right in. It doesn't mean that people don't think the game is great.

[13:29] But when they finally did release the game in October of 2018, there were a lot more titles that were revealed to the world that I think have people waiting. I do. I think people are waiting because the monsters is right around the corner.

[13:45] I think the fact that they're making what like 1200 L's of the game or a thousand L's of the game. I don't think people are afraid that there's a shortage of L's if they want one. I do think people are starting to pump the brakes again and not running in and just buying every single new game.

[14:05] Like they used to years ago and so the demand for Monster Bash Ellie I think is not as high as I thought it would be.

[14:13] Okay, so I think we were we were off there. But I think everyone got this one wrong because no one could have predicted the extraordinarily long delay to get Monster Bash remake out into the world.

[14:25] This is starting to look like Canadian Spinball podcast is is is off right we we are now one for three on our predictions of what would happen in 2018.

[14:36] Hopefully I can recover on the next one. I think the next one is Dennis Norman's pitch and bat and how well that game would do. Let's air that prediction now.

[14:45] My prediction is nobody gives a shit about pitch and bats in 2018 this game will come out I do think the zombie one looks interesting I played them at the shows.

[14:55] Okay, all right if we see more than 400 new inbox openings of pitch and bats I will send Ted to check for one thousand dollars.

[15:02] All right, so that was my prediction Ted thought they would sell at least 400 pitch and bats in 2018 and these games are out these games are out here's a thing nobody is unboxing them you don't see people opening them.

[15:14] The the price point of these games I believe is too high that's why people are not going in on them.

[15:20] And so I think we were correct in our assessment that the pitch and bat games from Dennis Norman you know the zombie one was zombie it artwork they have not sold very well they are not very popular so I'm going to call that an accurate prediction by Canadian Spinball podcast we are now two for three in our predictions of 2018 the next prediction we made was around circus maximum is pinball and whether or not they would fall.

[15:49] Whether or not they would finally deliver on pinball circus and the king pin remake they're doing and here was this shows prediction.

[15:56] All right well here's my prediction these guys have been promising pinball circus for a couple of years now they've delivered nothing now they're tearing apart king pin saying they're remaking that here's my prediction in this company.

[16:12] I just still think these guys do absolutely nothing of significance in 2018 and again this is our prediction for what happens next year all right well 2018 is coming on and has you know circus maximize have they delivered anything of significance and I think the answers no they have not I mean we we saw the king pin prototype they brought to a show they sold some king pin translates they still haven't finished the first game they're now showing us the prototype of the game.

[16:41] How many years off are we from actually being able to buy this product either one of them they had a dead year so I am going to chalk that up as we were accurate in our prediction of circus maximize in 2018 so we are now three for three we are starting to turn a corner let us now go on to our next prediction in pinball but before we do that I just want to answer one a question you might be having in your head which is why I'm going to talk about it.

[17:10] I'm going to talk about your head which is why I'm not airing Ted's predictions on this podcast and here's why I'm saving Ted from the embarrassment.

[17:18] Okay I think people are going to get their big Lebowski's in 2018.

[17:21] I think they're going to come out with it with with big Lebowski in 2018 and they're going to start delivering games.

[17:26] Yeah so that was Ted's prediction on Dutch pinball here was my prediction on Dutch pinball so here's my prediction I think that Dutch pinball closes its doors in 2018.

[17:46] I'll tell you what the business model these guys have in place to make more games requires a lot of new orders to come in to pay for all of the new manufacturing they need to make the game's reality.

[18:05] So they need to build the old machines and that is nothing short of a Ponzi scheme business model and because of that they are not going to be able to hoodwink new investors or new buyers to go in on the big Lebowski and this company will close in 2018.

[18:29] I mean there it was. This wasn't really a hard one to call. I think the writing was on the wall for this company for a long time and we successfully let the world know that it's over.

[18:42] It is over. You know it's crazy though unlike another company which we're going to talk about next.

[18:47] The problem with Dutch pinball is they won't just come out and confirm that it's over because for those of you in on the big Lebowski you still probably have a little bit of hope because they haven't communicated the end is here but it's over you didn't get anything you're not going to get anything they're out of money they've spent so much money trying to retool the company I think you have to finally admit that you're lied to you were deceived that they did everything right.

[19:16] When it came to getting you the your big Lebowski pinball machine and it turned out to be a total total cluster fuck and I think it's time to put Dutch pinball in the past and just forget about them because it's over lesson learned by everybody now speaking of lesson learn remember when we did this podcast last year a year ago there was still hope that highway pinball was going to turn a corner and this was the point where there was new investors coming out of the market.

[19:45] They were going to do things differently they were going to get people their alien pinball machines this was the point a year ago when we had a few members of the highway fan base mainly helped in and a few others who are really trying to convince people to stay in on alien pinball you have to remember this was a full year ago and they were shilling the company they were trying to convince people to stay in and to stay invested in highway pinball.

[20:15] This was a Canadian pinball podcast prediction of what would happen at highway here's my take and I've been brutally honest highway pinball and Dutch pinball are both going to go under in 2018 and I'll explain why these guys had no idea how deep the rabbit hole went in terms of Andrew highway is bad business decisions and there is no way to get to the green.

[20:43] There is no way to make a profit in companies that spend four to five years putting the company in the red and alien pinball is not even that good and that's my opinion this game keeps it's it keeps being like put on life support and it keeps being sort of shield by the 20 guys on pinside who wanted to be great but when you really look at the alien pinball machine it's plagued with issues.

[21:13] It's plagued with problems. It's plagued with like all the things that Andrew highway like left these guys and so that's pretty much how it went down right the the new investors inherited a sinking hydrofoil ship from Andrew highway we know how the story ends so we were accurate there and for unlike Dutch we actually got confirmation from highway pinball that it doors were closed that they were filing for bankruptcy that it was over.

[21:43] Game over man game over man and so what does that make us right now we're five for three in the world of pinball predictions let's go on to the next company right now.

[21:55] All right cool all right so test prediction is that Thunderbirds will sell well in 2018 and that it will find buyers my prediction is this.

[22:09] I think Mike is a terrible terrible terrible marketer anyone you start the company wants to create one thing and that's buyers and fans of the company Mike has shown time and time again to give two shits about that and the number one market in the world for pinball is the United States of America and Mike is time and time again.

[22:38] You know said he doesn't give a shit about that he's selling games to Australians okay that's cool here's the thing I have many friends in Australia and I have many friends who are the target for this game the game looks like a leftover data east say up game you're going to come out with a pinball machine in 2018 that is orange DMD dots as the display.

[23:03] The Australian podcast that are out there also won't even deal with this guy like he has no fans all right and a year later we've noticed the same type of behavior from Mike he's still battling the community but Thunderbirds did come out it did come out and the sales of the game have been most likely atrocious and we know the story he still has not shipped to many of the pre order buyers in Australia their machines yet.

[23:32] And so I think we can chalk up 2018 as a horrible year for home pin and we will talk more about them in our 2019 predictions but I think we're once again we're spot on with Mike's ability to be successful in pinball he has not achieved it and I don't think he's going to achieve it especially with the way he talks to people in the community all right.

[23:56] So what is that now we're now six for three within pinball predictions I think the next one is going to be this one's a difficult one because remember a year ago we knew very little about deep route other than the fact that they were partnering up with john pop a do and we still sort of like a mystery company we know a lot more now about deep route pinball but remember this was our prediction for what the company would actually do in 2018 and let's air our prediction of deep route pinball my prediction.

[24:26] So the prediction is this nobody has ever proven to have successfully been able to work with john pop a do to get a game out and that even goes back to the valley Williams days where they had to kick him off of World Cup soccer because he wouldn't finish the game and when john pop a do is left as the sole designer of a machine it turns into magic roll bullshit.

[24:53] I think these guys are not going to show anything in 2018 that shows any progress on these machines.

[24:59] Okay so in an entire year have we actually seen anything that proves to us that deep route pinball has made progress in living up to the expectations they put out in the world and remember this was a year ago at that point the deep route team had it materialized as much as it has today.

[25:22] We didn't know all the designers and all the other team members that would join but still our prediction that we would see nothing that would prove that deep route is a viable player in pinball in 2018 was accurate.

[25:36] It was absolutely accurate. Do you know what they're working on? Have you seen what they're working on? So we were right in our prediction that 2018 would be a dead year for deep route and we also now know that we're not going to see anything at tpf.

[25:50] But I'm going to do this in my prediction show. I think something's going to happen at tpf. I'll explain more when we get to my 2019 prediction show but there we were once again correct on another manufacturer.

[26:01] So I think we're are we seven for three right now. Am I telling this up correctly? Let's move on to spooky pinball.

[26:10] So my prediction is this. I think that total nuclear annihilation will continue to be like a decent like seller for spooky it'll probably go down as spooky's best selling machine of all time in 2018 in terms of volume.

[26:26] I think there's so more than 300 total nuclear annihilations. I don't I don't know right Alice Cooper's a game that none of us have seen much on right we haven't seen anything.

[26:38] I've seen a translate and I've seen maybe like the back box art which is and we saw that skull that looks like a ball might fly right so which is like embarrassingly little to predict on a pinball machine.

[26:51] So we're moving on to Stern right and we're moving on to Stern. So we already covered Stern. I did this show in a little bit of a different order because when Ted and I did it it was alphabetical.

[27:00] So my prediction for spooky was that TNA would sell and become their best selling title I thought it would sell more than 300 units. I would say that I was accurate in the sense that they will go on to sell 550 TNAs and I don't think anybody predicted TNA to be as successful as it has become and that's great it is it is the most popular spooky title of all time.

[27:25] Remember a year ago we knew nothing about Alice Cooper's and I think it was fair for us not to say how we think Alice Cooper would do or sell or be received because we had absolutely no information to go on other than the theme itself.

[27:39] And as we know as we know 2018 has been a little bit of a weird year for Alice Cooper right we got the reveal at tpf the game is still not shipping so we we will make a prediction about Alice Cooper's nightmare castle as we look towards 2019 in the next episode but I think we were pretty accurate in saying TNA would be the best selling spooky title and the sales would be over 300.

[28:06] So we're what are we eight for three right now all right what else is next we had a little bit of a prediction on multi more fake we both didn't think you would light the world on fire I'm not going to air that because I think that has been pretty accurate I won't even count that as I was being correct on multi more fake.

[28:23] But the last one I want to air for you is one that's really interesting because it is a title that we have talked a lot about recently and it is finally starting to ship to consumers and that is Jersey Jack Pimball and Pirate to the Caribbean now remember remember we recorded this prediction show last year in January early January at that point we had seen Pirate to the Caribbean reveal that expo.

[28:53] So in October okay and so at that point when we recorded the show Jersey Jack Pimball had promised people they would get their Pirates to the Caribbean Pimball machines in q1 of 2018.

[29:09] I want you to listen to what my prediction was of Jersey Jack Pimball and Pirates to the Caribbean and when people would get their games after the reveal at expo let's air it now.

[29:21] Canate is prediction for Jersey Jack in 2018 is you know I've been thinking a lot about this because I do like Jack and I like what his team is doing over there.

[29:31] The game came out at expo in October and people loved it right I mean people like when bonkers for it they were excited to see Eric and his new mechanisms and the game itself look great.

[29:45] But six months will pass between that and when the game goes on sale and here's my prediction and I think you hit it on the head Ted is when you said theme is everything and this continues to be the quagmire for me when I look at Pimball marketing because it's like nobody really wants Pirates to the Caribbean Pimball in 2018.

[30:09] The movies have been long forgotten in the sense of cultural relevance so you're going to make Pirates to the Caribbean you're going to send your new designer your new engineer Eric who's brilliant and you're going to ask him to make a game based on a theme that nobody wants on a movie that bomb the last to have bombed at the box office.

[30:34] Right wait a minute wait a minute though but don't forget I mean a lot of people are not like maybe like you're either buy it on the theme along they buy it because it's a fun game if you talk about bombs I mean look at everybody was predicting the dialed in was going to tank and be a be horrible and I don't know anyone that's played that game that says that they don't think it's one of the top games they've ever played it's tons of fun including me.

[30:59] Here's my other prediction. Nobody but people love it because they just love the game play. Yeah but here's the issue here's the issue.

[31:06] I bet Stern has sold more Mustang machines than Jersey Jack has sold a dialed in and I'll tell you this is the problem and this is Jack's biggest problem.

[31:18] Jack let Pat Lawler spend five years making dialed in five years in the making people forget this that game has been in the works for five years and he wraps it in a theme that makes it hard for Jersey Jack to sell even 2000 units.

[31:40] And meanwhile Stern can sell five to six thousand units of ACDC and that is Jack's issue and I say this with like almost like compassion and empathy for Jack where it's like why would you let Pat Lawler work on a game for five years?

[32:03] I think he invested a million dollars in Pat Lawler and you let him determine the theme and you make it dialed in if that was JAWS Ted how many units would have sold?

[32:17] Yeah but that's it like that game could have been anything.

[32:23] Well amazing that he brought up JAWS there because that seems to be the hot new theme that people are really clamoring for with Stern in 2019.

[32:31] But my prediction for Jersey Jack was that the game was going to ship six months after reveal and I thought that was going to be a hard sell and the reality was it actually took 12 months after the reveal of Pirates of the Caribbean to get the game to consumers.

[32:48] I was almost completely spot on by saying they wouldn't be able to sell 2000 units of dialed in and we heard from Jack specifically from him that they've only sold 1500 dialed in to date.

[33:04] And so I think we were pretty accurate I think we were pretty accurate nobody could have imagined it would take Jersey Jack pinball a year after revealing Pirates of the Caribbean to actually start shipping games to consumers.

[33:19] And for those of you out there who think like that doesn't matter it's a great game it does matter it does matter we're going to talk about this when we talk about the 2019 predictions for Jersey Jack pinball.

[33:31] But ultimately it's hard to look at 2018 as a successful year for Jersey Jack pinball I think it was a year of incredible expectations that were not met.

[33:43] And once again manufacturing delays and themes that people don't really want continue to sink this company's success.

[33:54] And these aren't difficult things to get right the manufacturing part is obviously a lot harder to get right when you're using temp workers but picking themes that don't make people go crazy for that's a marketing decision.

[34:10] And that to me continues to be the head scratcher we know we're going to talk about what's coming down the road from Jersey Jack with 2019.

[34:18] And it seems to be themes that are much more popular and we'll talk about that in the next episode but those were our predictions.

[34:25] And I think when we look at 2018 we were pretty spot on with a lot of what would happen in the pinball world we were spot on with calling the companies that would fail we were pretty spot on with how different games would be successful in 2018.

[34:43] And we weren't able to know everything right we obviously got some stuff wrong we obviously didn't see some stern titles come out that did come out.

[34:52] And so overall if we were to look at 2018 as a whole my overall assessment of the year was that it was another good year to be a pinball buyer it was another good year to be a pinball tournament player.

[35:07] Another good year to be in the hobby because you had a lot of options come out in 2018 it was a bad year for people who pre-ordered games years ago.

[35:19] For most of the people who went in on the new boutique companies 2018 was a painful year for you.

[35:25] If you were an alien buyer if you were a big Lebowski buyer it was a terribly painful year.

[35:32] You probably had to tell your wife or significant other that the money was gone that it's not coming back you're not getting your game.

[35:40] And so that was a shitty year for those individuals.

[35:43] If you were a fan of stern pinball another stern year another year in which stern gave you a variety of options for you to choose from I think iron maiden surprised a lot of people I think getting zombie Eddie artwork on so many games was exciting for a lot of people.

[36:02] I think you're starting to see stern improve year in year out what it's offering is for people and I think again stern fanboys had another good year they if you're rooting for stern is like rooting for the Yankees you're gonna get a team that's gonna be good every year and some years the win the championship and come out with the best pinball imaginable.

[36:22] For everyone else out there I think it's a good year I think it's hard to look at pinball in the last few years and find a lot to fault in the hobby now that being said I think you're gonna be a little bit shocked at what I predict is gonna happen next year I think we're gonna see a little bit of the same but I also think we're gonna see more of a a finality in the realities of this hobby take place in 2019 right.

[36:51] This almost feels like 2019 is the final chapter in a trilogy of pinball collecting and buying and boutique companies it's you know it's like all of the armies are assembled and we are going to see a battle in sue in 2019 in which there are gonna be winners and losers and they're gonna be survivors and they're gonna be casualties and it is going to be I think we're gonna be the best in the world.

[37:21] I think a brutally honest year in the realities of pinball and the realities of companies trying to be successful in pinball and I think it's going to be one to watch and one to enjoy and all of you out there have the best vantage point of what will happen in 2019 you know why because you don't have to go in every day and try and make a pinball company successful you get to just keep your money in your wallet and buy the stuff that you get.

[37:51] It is such a good time to be a pinball buyer it is it's such a nerve wracking time to be a pinball manufacturer trying to steal some of Stern's market share I can't wait I can't wait for 2019 so look forward for my prediction show real soon everyone have a very amazing new year be safe.
