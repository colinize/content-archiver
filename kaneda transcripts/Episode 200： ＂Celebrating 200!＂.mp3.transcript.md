[00:00] Who maybe do you know that's work?

[00:04] Who heaven is a place on earth?

[00:08] They say heaven, love comes first

[00:12] We'll make heaven our place on earth

[00:16] Who heaven is a place on earth?

[00:20] Welcome to episode 200 of Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:32] I'm your host, Canada, and I want to just say thank you to everyone out there who listens to this podcast on a weekly basis

[00:40] Without you, I would never have made it this far.

[00:43] 200 episodes talking about Pinball

[00:46] I think that shows that Pinball is alive and well in 2018

[00:50] It's going to be a very interesting year for Pinball

[00:54] There's going to be a lot of new games coming out

[00:58] There's going to be a lot of companies trying to get you to buy their titles and send money in to buy expensive toys in the world of Pinball

[01:04] But I think that's amazing that here we are in an error when Pinball probably should be obsolete

[01:10] And we're enjoying it and it's almost in its biggest resurgence moment of all time

[01:14] So that is exciting

[01:18] On this special 200th episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast I have to say I was trying to get a lot of different Pinball luminaries on the show to talk to you and discuss Pinball

[01:28] But I decided to do something different and bring someone else on the show

[01:34] And the whole reason why you enjoy this podcast and get to listen to Canada's Pinball Podcast on a weekly basis

[01:42] So I'm going to air that interview in a little bit before that

[01:46] I just want to talk about a few news items that are happening in the world of Pinball

[01:50] So I got a lot of good feedback on the Dave Sanders interview with Highway Pinball

[01:54] And I think that for those of you out there the thread about Alien Pinball continues to be sort of a never ending story of one of the most important things that I've ever seen

[02:02] And I think the most important thing that I've ever seen is the never ending story of when are people going to get their games

[02:06] When are people who went in on the machine years ago going to receive their product

[02:10] And I think the stress in that thread and it's almost at like a breaking point

[02:16] Is that new people who got their machine years after other people paid for it are creating a real sort of tension and an anger in that thread

[02:28] Because how would you feel if you bought the game in 2014 and some new guy just got it and just paid a few months ago

[02:36] And he's telling you how great it is

[02:38] It's this weird thing because without those new people saying how great it is without there being any cheerleaders for the company

[02:46] The whole company might go away and the original buyers might never get anything

[02:52] It is a very very strange sort of stressful and still dramatic situation over there

[03:00] I hope they figure everything out

[03:02] You know Dave Sanders I couldn't thank him enough for coming on and being very honest and open about what the experience was like

[03:10] Working at Highway and getting Alien Pinball out the door

[03:14] So time will tell

[03:16] I think we've sort of adopted this new approach of it's just you have to wait and see what happens now

[03:22] They're not communicating what's going on very well over there

[03:26] But I don't know I don't know what's going on but I hope you guys get your games soon

[03:32] I haven't heard any updates on what's going on over in the world of Dutch Pinball

[03:36] It's now February of 2018 and we still have no timeline

[03:40] We still have no dates of when to expect games to come out

[03:44] Again another wait and see moment over at Chicago Gaming

[03:50] The news I'm reading about there's a board fix it looks like for attack from Mars Remake

[03:56] Where there's a board you can swap out I guess one of the issues with that game was you couldn't control the flipper strength

[04:02] And the flippers were really strong and you couldn't lower them

[04:06] So people were getting a lot of airballs and now there's a new board I guess you can swap in

[04:10] That actually allows the flipper coil to be controlled

[04:14] So I'm reading about people putting that in

[04:16] It seems to be the desired setting is a minus 4 flipper strength makes for a good playing experience

[04:22] So if you haven't attacked from Mars Remake you should probably want to look into that

[04:26] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[04:30] Stern pinball so Batman code update 0.87

[04:34] I actually managed to get to bat sui multi ball yesterday without taking the glass off

[04:42] It wasn't as hard as I thought now what I've realized is the minor villains in Batman pinball

[04:48] You activate them by hitting one of the three stand up TV targets that's right above the right sling shot

[04:54] And when you do the TV insert will blink on the left orbit you shoot that

[05:00] And it allows you to select a minor villain now the way it's it's set up and it's really cool

[05:04] You pick your minor villain from season one two or three

[05:08] And for some of them I think they're going to be selectable from all three seasons

[05:12] So like for example, they'll be a tut in season one a tut in season two and a tut in season three

[05:18] Now here's the amazing part is each of those seasons if you select them

[05:24] They come with different clips that come from those actual seasons of Batman now how awesome is that just think about it

[05:32] It's like you're actually playing through the season of those characters of those minor villains

[05:38] I actually think there's a lot more work that is that went into the minor villains and even the major villains

[05:44] It almost feels like two separate games in a way combined into one awesome experience

[05:50] This game continues to impress me so I got the batsuit multiple and to get there you have to beat a minor villain from season one two and three

[06:00] And the best way to do it because I realize that a lot of the minor villains like they the difficulties can get harder and harder

[06:08] They're not all the same in terms of shots required so I go the route of doing bookworm that I believe it's egghead

[06:16] And then I believe it's tight and those are easier to complete than some of the other ones

[06:22] Because they're not easy it's like ten shots you have to hit to complete a minor villain and when you drain your minor villain mode ends

[06:32] It's not like the major villains where you stay in the mode which makes it easier to complete

[06:36] But Batman is turning out to just be a phenomenal experience

[06:40] I think anyone who has one is really enjoying it and the fact that we still have more to go will back girl make an appearance in the game

[06:48] That's the big question on everyone's mind is will back girl make an appearance

[06:52] Now the other side of the stern coin right now that I think is annoying people is Batman is now sort of coming into the prime of the game

[07:01] Like people are realizing how great it is the code it's taking off

[07:07] On the other side we have Guardians of the Galaxy which is their brand new game which a lot of people are wondering where the hell is the code

[07:15] Is this game going to become great like where's the attention going to be on Guardians now

[07:19] I think everyone who knows pinball without lime and sheets there is no way Guardians is ever going to become as magical as Batman

[07:27] There's no way it's just different levels of talent working on the game

[07:31] I also from from what I've seen of Guardians it just doesn't seem to have the same cohesiveness between what's on the screen and the callouts and what's in the gameplay experience

[07:41] So I'm starting to think like Guardians was a little bit of like a rush job

[07:46] I don't know there's something about it it's just it's just not clicking for me

[07:50] If you feel otherwise hit me up

[07:53] Canate a pinball at gmail.com and let me know why you feel otherwise

[07:57] So we're we're on the verge of tpf so not a lot more stern news out there in the world other than where the hell's the star wars topper

[08:04] Which seems to be forever a mystery

[08:07] How could it take them eight months to get the topper approved?

[08:11] I mean you can make a pinball machine in less time as American pinball showed us

[08:15] Speaking of American pinball who deenies are starting to go out

[08:19] I keep hearing from people that the game is great I have to play it I haven't played it yet I still think the shots look a little tight

[08:25] But all early reports are the game is great now will the quality be there again these are all things that we will learn very soon enough as games go out to consumers

[08:35] But I'm really I don't think I've seen any who deenies go into people's homes yet I saw our friends that straight down the middle habit

[08:42] Greg and Zach can't say enough great stuff about this game I mean they they're they're telling me this game is just phenomenal so there's that

[08:49] Speaking of early reports of a game being phenomenal I have a report from a gentleman who owns 150 pinball machines

[08:57] And he has spent a lot of time on Jersey Jack pinball's new pirates of the Caribbean game and I'm hearing that he considers this to be one of the best pinball machines of all time

[09:07] So take that for what it's worth but I do tend to trust people who play a lot of games when they give a glowing review of a game that's new like Pirates of the Caribbean

[09:18] So as much as we have been down on the theme and the license of pirates and the integration of that could this game produce a pinball experience that is amazing

[09:30] Now here's the thing even though pirates the movies has sort of become culturally irrelevant I still think a pirate theme pinball game is a better theme than dialed in

[09:42] Okay without a doubt I still think treasure hunts and shipwrecks and firing cannons and all this stuff much more of an exciting theme than saving quantum city

[09:52] So if the pinball experience is good as dialed in and the theme is better then I think it could we could get there we could get there in terms of like things clicking for Jack at the same time

[10:04] Anything else going on in the pinball world not not too much so without further ado I hope you enjoy this interview

[10:12] There's a lot of great stuff to come on this show I have a lot of great people coming on in the near future and I probably will be going to Texas pinball festival

[10:23] I say probably because I haven't booked a ticket but I have a room that I could jump into

[10:30] It's just a matter of getting my airfare to go down there so we'll see I think I need to go down there I really do

[10:36] It's going to be one of the best TPFs of all time I think this is probably one of the most exciting shows with all the stuff that's going to be there

[10:42] Everyone thank you so much for listening to the show for getting us to episode 200 and who knows we might have 200 more episodes over the next couple of years

[10:54] I'm your host I'm your humble host thank you once again for voting this show as your favorite pinball podcast

[11:02] Enjoy your Super Bowl Sunday and we'll talk to you again real soon

[11:06] It is episode 200 of Canada's pinball podcast and I've been thinking a lot about what I wanted to do with this 200th episode

[11:16] And who could I get on the show as a special guest that you guys would all want to hear

[11:20] And I won't lie to you you know I asked some people out there that are pretty big pioneers in the pinball world

[11:26] I asked John Borg he's kept delaying I asked try to get Gary Stern on I try to get Ed Robertson who's taking a vacation this week

[11:34] But then I sat back and I thought you know what who's actually the most important person to this pinball podcast

[11:40] Who's the one person that actually is the sole reason I'm allowed to grab a mic and record a pinball podcast for over the last two years

[11:50] And that is no other than my incredible fiance Brenda O'Donovan O apostrophe

[11:58] She's going to join the show today we have a snowball mic setup and we're going to do something for the first time ever

[12:05] Brenda's actually going to interview me about pinball about whatever she wants to ask me

[12:12] But I'm going to turn the tables and turn the mic over and let Brenda do the questioning

[12:16] So Brenda welcome to the pinball podcast that you hear every week being recorded

[12:21] Wait so just let me get this straight you're basically saying you said to me I want this to be really special

[12:27] I want you to interview me for episode 200 bring it back 100 episodes ago you offered me the 100th slot

[12:34] But then booted me from that takes a while booted me from that okay so I got I got 99 and now you're saying and admitting that I actually wasn't even your top choice for 200

[12:44] Out number five or six right great fantastic and Boba probably came before that as well

[12:48] Baba he we're looking at him right now he's lying on the ground so so Brenda what do you want to ask me

[12:54] I suppose the tables have turned here at about have a may yeah I really should have probably crowdsword some questions before before doing this

[13:01] And really get to what the people want to know about all right but let's start with it's been about a hundred and one episodes since I've been on

[13:08] Right it's probably been about a hundred and one episodes since I've listened right so tell me how is your own approach

[13:13] Do you think has changed to to podcasting and to this hobby in this industry how has it changed?

[13:19] I mean the last year I think all you guys noticed the difference in the show and basically the difference being

[13:25] Instead of just being negative Nancy on the hobby I think I've tried to take a more positive approach about what goes on in the pinball world

[13:33] And you know over the last year I think I've gone from I got to have a magic girl because remember last February was when we when we received magic girl in this household

[13:42] And I think I was so obsessed with like having this rare game to collect them to own and look owning a magic girl was probably one of the most negative periods in this hobby for me

[13:54] Because I think I focus on all the wrong parts of the hobby which was rarity having something other people don't have

[14:02] And just having thing something for bragging rights only which I think is the worst way to approach pinball

[14:07] I think after that the last sort of once we got rid of magic girl I would say like the last six months have probably been the best period of this podcast

[14:15] I'd say your tamer I think you're definitely still in it and love the notion of being able to brag uses as a platform to be able to have your very large voice heard

[14:26] But you also have such an amazing listenership which would then tell me that the quality of the content that's there is still there

[14:33] So from my perspective definitely not as negative but God don't talk to me about that magic girl phase I try to just imagine that was a bit of a blip

[14:43] So what me ask you a question so what was it like knowing that we're planning a wedding right now and you witnessed me pay $23,000 for a pinball machine?

[14:51] I mean it's kind of just stupid, it's really stupid, why would you be so much money for one god damn game?

[15:00] Especially when what I'm hearing now is that they're like having like one or two other companies even tried to bring it out again so like this notion of rarity is it even a real concept?

[15:09] Well I mean that's the thing I mean with deep root pinball saying they might bring it out so like let's imagine you did buy a magic girl for $23,000 and actually just sold mine for $20,000

[15:19] For the people who own that game if that game gets remade if they figure out a way to make it happen who God knows what the values of those original machines are that don't work so I'm just happy I got out.

[15:29] I also think you have to think of us Tom Brenda's as we're planning a wedding and I'm giving a wedding budget it's really hard not to give your fiance a decent budget for a wedding when you own a $23,000 pinball machine so it's like shouldn't my wedding cost at least twice as much as a pinball machine and it's like crap now.

[15:48] That'd be nice, something I'm getting more money for the wedding.

[15:50] No, no, the budget is a little bit under under under that.

[15:54] Brenda's starting to shut up.

[15:57] But again like magic or you pay $23,000 for it right?

[16:03] You end up selling it you got rid of a thank God and you broke even what not but it's so much money for a game that you could barely even flip.

[16:11] I remember you got it here you were super excited it was like a box of basically blinking lights and then at super excited the one day we figured out you could actually just like flip it and then the excitement died almost as quickly when you realized that you were going to get a $20,000 pinball machine.

[16:23] Okay, when you realized it was absolutely no gameplay.

[16:26] Well I think what's interesting right I think a lot of people in this hobby can relate to this is so the chase to find the rare item is often times far more exciting than actually getting the item itself especially when the item arrives and it doesn't work.

[16:40] But here's the thing I think everyone in this hobby can relate to and I agree with you Brenda there is a point where I had a magic girl I think I had a tails of the Caribbean nights and I also I think was on the hook for like Batman.

[16:52] You can count up just three pinball machines and it's like $50,000 for three pinball toys and you start to you start to scratch your head and wonder what the hell happened like how how have we in this hobby attributed it such a high value to things that really 99.9% of the world don't care about now

[17:15] but here's the thing I noticed too the danger that we do in this hobby when we start to think oh yeah it's just a $12,500 collector's edition or $15,000 super limited edition.

[17:26] We all justify the cost by sometimes looking at other hobbies and what other things cost like you could go on eBay and right now type in Pokemon cards and there are Pokemon cards for sale one card for like $90,000.

[17:42] So you start to like look at other obsessed and crazed hobbies to justify sometimes what pinball costs and I'll say this all of that all of those hobbies that have like these rare inflated prices nobody who owns that Pokemon card is actually having a better life.

[17:59] In fact the only people that give a shit are like five other Pokemon losers around the world who also are chasing after that gold foil three headed dragon BS card that will just sit on a shelf.

[18:10] Now at least you can play pinball but I'll say this like I don't want to spend a small fortune on pinball anymore and I think having one game is cured me of that desire to keep looking for more and more.

[18:22] Do you think there is a risk though that with this notion of collectors in this hobby which the notion of collectors even in itself is pretty new right maybe only the last five or 10 years would you say and this the prices have completely skyrocketed in that time as well.

[18:37] Like how sustainable is that?

[18:39] Yeah I mean it's like I think there's always this conversation around is it a collectors hobby or is it an operators hobby like are these pinball machines made to go into people's homes or are they made to go on location and actually make money now everyone knows the true answer to that is it's a collectors market.

[18:56] And look collectors I've met collectors in this hobby and this is the other thing that I do love about pinball is I know people that are kind of broke and all they can afford is like a pinball machine.

[19:08] And that's it that's their major toy in the household. I know guys that are multi millionaires that have watches that cost more than you know 50 pinball machines and the dichotomy of who actually is out there in the collector market is interesting.

[19:26] Now I think what's happened recently is if you want to collect new inbox pinball machines chances are you're a very successful wealthy man because the games are really expensive and as I said before you should not buy a pinball machine unless you may be saved two to three times that much money that year in your finances.

[19:47] So if you're buying a $12,000 machine I hopefully you're putting away $50,000 elsewhere for more important stuff in life. Now look I can't tell people how to spend their money it's up to them but it's a collectors market now I still think that nobody caters to the collector I still believe that.

[20:04] I'm not in it I'm not in it I don't read these stupid forms lots of things you waste no your goddamn time get outside and just get outside and talk to a human being.

[20:19] But for you like it feels like the collectors might represent 5% but they're the ones who are driving the price and you have these you know young fellas who really want this game they'll save up all their money and then they put this game into their home and as you said it's the one toy in their house but it's then so expensive to operate.

[20:37] Then they have lost all their discretionary spend everything's gone into this and pumped into this it's like so unfair.

[20:44] I think the collector market is definitely more than 5% but I do agree and this happened with the advent of Jersey Jack pinball and the advent of Zidware and by advent I mean the beginnings of what they did with pricing so once companies started to show that there was a market to pay more for pinball machines.

[21:06] The only company that actually could manufacture games quickly they latched on to that bit of market insight and that is stern pinball and look a stern pinball machine if you look at it now it is criminal that people are spending $9,000 on an LE that it's $7.00.

[21:23] What would be the base price of a stern?

[21:25] I mean it used to be able to get an LE for $5,500, $6,000.

[21:29] Chris they've almost doubled the price and they've cut the quality in half on a lot of again.

[21:36] I will say I looked at those three games when we were at that Chicago show what was it just the basic one it's an LE in it and it's an SLE.

[21:43] You get the premium the LE.

[21:45] They all looked the God damn same.

[21:46] It looked like they gone out to Toys of Rust and bought like a bunch of plastic cars and stuff.

[21:50] Well and that's the thing is once you realize if we just change the stickers and put some cheap toys on it we can charge another $3,000 for this game and in here is a scary part it sells out.

[22:02] And so as long as collectors continue to show that they have a desire to own something that's limited they're going to start to keep raising the prices.

[22:12] Now here's the thing I think Jersey Jack Pimball where his prices are at are very reflective of the quality and the amount of stuff Jersey Jack puts into his machine.

[22:21] I can't say the same about stern Pimball.

[22:24] I can say the same about Chicago gaming with attack from Mars and soon to be monster bash.

[22:29] But you know the issue is this it's like I think the real battle is in the $6,000 price range.

[22:35] I bet most of Stern's machines sold our pros.

[22:38] So I think the real battle for companies that want to come into the marketplaces can you offer a great value between $6,000 and $7,000.

[22:46] I think that is where if you want to sell volume you need to be.

[22:50] So who's really in the market place right now you have Stern who said really I suppose they're the biggest player right and they have both the collectors and they have what you call that a pro at the $6,000 month.

[23:01] They only operate in the market.

[23:04] And then you have Jersey Jack who I agree I've seen their games definitely much higher quality but they're on the larger end of the price tag right.

[23:12] So they're more lean towards the collectors then there's American Pimball right that's another company.

[23:17] They have Odini just came out right.

[23:19] Oh that came out.

[23:20] Yep $7,000.

[23:21] All right that's what that seems to be much more accessible for most.

[23:25] Who else is really okay?

[23:27] Spooky.

[23:28] So those slots were lovely.

[23:29] Yep.

[23:30] Okay what games do they have?

[23:32] They have Rob's on me.

[23:33] Okay.

[23:34] And they have Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle coming out.

[23:36] And now Spooky is right in that sweet spot of between $6,000 and $7,000.

[23:41] I believe Alice Cooper is going to be like $6,800 or something like that.

[23:46] But here's the thing it's like in terms of bank for the buck there probably is no better Pimball to buy than just a Stern Pro for $5,200.

[23:55] I mean it really is incredible that you can pretty much get the exact same Star Wars game, Star Wars experience, same, Aerosmith game, same, same, you know almost everything in that Pro edition for less than $6,000 is incredible.

[24:09] And that look that's for the guy from the Pro is for the guy who just doesn't give a shit about this arbitrary limited manufactured thing.

[24:17] He also doesn't care about the few features that they might put in the game to charge thousands more.

[24:22] He's just enjoying his Pimball machine.

[24:24] Is code in the notion that that updates and you can get to unlock different levels of gameplay which again to me I was like I could just barely keep the ball alive.

[24:32] That's game to me.

[24:33] But like to someone like you or any one of these collectors you're in the harvester needs much more advanced.

[24:38] Is that unlocking of code something that everyone gets regardless of what you're doing?

[24:42] So here's it and that's you know it's a good point.

[24:45] I didn't by the way people I did not feed Brenda any of these questions.

[24:48] We're doing this all real time. But I think what's interesting when we think about collectors and rarity and what drives the value of the game.

[24:55] So one of the most valuable secondhand games of all time is Tron Ali and simply because Tron Ali had some code in it.

[25:02] It was like a daft punk multi ball that wasn't found in any of the other versions of the Tron game.

[25:07] So people really made it limited exactly the gameplay experience was limited because only the elite guys had code.

[25:12] Now what I find really interesting now is that Stern does not use their code as a way to make the elite people.

[25:20] The people who pay the premium don't get an exclusive code or mode experience.

[25:25] And I think that's a mistake and I'll give you an example right now.

[25:28] So for the first time yesterday I actually got to the new Batsely multi ball on Batman.

[25:33] Batsely.

[25:34] Yep. It's very it's very cool.

[25:37] But that to me is a perfect example of if they put the batsely multi ball only in the S.L.E. version of the game or the S.L.E. and L.E. owners get it only immediately.

[25:48] The value of those games almost becomes justified for what people spend. But it also would raise the value of those limited versions of the game.

[25:55] Now I know everyone else kicks and screams and cries. This is what's annoying about pinball people.

[25:59] They will kick and scream and cry that they want the same experience as people who paid a lot more money.

[26:04] Okay, let me use a car analogy because I know crazy levy loves it.

[26:07] Do I kick and scream if I buy a base level Mercedes that someone who paid a lot more for the AMG has a much faster car?

[26:15] You see this notion that pinball people think that they all deserve to have the same experience no matter what they spent is stupid.

[26:23] I actually think if you spend more you should get more of an experience versus just window dressing with stickers and toys.

[26:32] You should actually get a different experience. I don't think they have figured that part out yet.

[26:37] I think people are starting to like Jersey Jack is going to have on the collector's edition of Pirates like an interactive topper that isn't available on any other game.

[26:44] So that's an interesting.

[26:46] Who made Charlie?

[26:49] Stern.

[26:50] So at what point do they stop this very obvious model of giving those who pay more a little bit more of a premium experience within the game play?

[26:59] Yeah, I mean, you know, it's the first time is the only game I'm seeing in a long time where the actual like the code is different or the code is something special that they might have certain features that are on LEDs and premiums but not on the pro.

[27:12] But we're starting really where they really fucked over every collector was the premium, which is like you can have the same exact thing as the le just not have some stupid plaque and different artwork.

[27:23] But you're getting the same experience and you know that doesn't happen anywhere else like again like Mercedes doesn't put the AMG engine in a non AMG and just said you can have the same performance.

[27:33] We're just not going to call it an AMG and it's and again, I think it's smart for them to do it business wise because consumers have shown that they'll buy up all of it regardless.

[27:45] So, yep, I mean, that's where we're at. I mean, no one is catering to the collector that one by that. I mean, the multi milleners out there who want to have a very rare truly exclusive experience.

[27:55] Tell me who is catering to those gentlemen out there who don't want to open up their garage or open up their game room and have the same exact game that's found in thousands of other places in America.

[28:05] Nobody's catering it. It's not just multi millenaries. It's the folks like yourself who are obsessed who want to have that the one game that nobody else has. I mean, that's what motivated you for a magic girl.

[28:17] Yeah, and look, and I'll say this. I think that motivation and that behavior that desire is what made me sort of get down on the hobby because I realized like, well, what happens when I do have a magic girl?

[28:28] You go on Pinside, you say, hey, look what I have and everyone calls you an idiot for spending that much money.

[28:32] So why'd you bother going on there if there's so much hate?

[28:35] Well, you know, I don't really go on to Pinside much anymore. I'll tell you why because this week in Pimball, which is the website that Jeff runs.

[28:42] What thing is?

[28:43] Yeah, well, we should talk about the Pimball that we're staring at it right now. It's arrived. Pinside is not the same. It's just not the same.

[28:51] It's just a bunch of people either complaining that they haven't received their game in years or is the same 20 personalities arguing about Pimball and who cares?

[29:01] I'm supposed to be moderated for him, right?

[29:03] Yeah, the moderation is very one-sided. I mean, it's...

[29:06] That's unfortunate.

[29:07] Yeah, I mean, look, Robb and decided long ago who he was going to protect and build a bubble around on that site.

[29:13] I think what's really ruined Pinside though is not even the moderation. Well, I guess this leads to moderation.

[29:18] There's too many stupid threads about nothing on there. Like, if you go on that site, it is like navigating an asteroid belt trying to find the threads that actually have value.

[29:31] And that is the problem with Pinside. Whereas, even if you go on like a CERK form or some of the other forms, there's like one thread about each game.

[29:40] And you have to stay on topic about that game. So I can go into that thread and I can just see things of value.

[29:47] But you go into Pinside and you've got like six different threads about each game within each thread, people meander and talk about like everything from...

[29:56] Coca-Cola soda, different sodas around the world. They start arguing about other games and other threads. And it's just...

[30:03] I don't want to read 400 pages to get to the 8 pages that are actually of value.

[30:09] So tell us about this weekend Pimbo. When did that start?

[30:12] So I don't know exactly. I want to say it began about four to six months ago.

[30:18] Oh right, wow, so it is really...

[30:20] Yeah. And Jeff is amazing. I mean, I've never seen a guy sort of do all the leg work to sort of chronicle and capture all of the latest Pimbo news.

[30:30] And not just like what we used to do, which is I used to read Pinside and do my weekly updates.

[30:35] But Jeff also like hyperlinks the stuff. He lays it out with photos.

[30:40] So if you really need to know what's going on in Pimbo and you want to feel better about the hobby, I would simply go there every Monday, read it, listen the podcast like this one and head to head Pimbo.

[30:53] And you'll get all you need to know because I think what's good about the combination of Jeff's site with podcasts, you get the news.

[31:00] Then you also get sort of like the commentary and the point of view. Because what I love about Jeff too, he's like real journalism.

[31:06] He's not sharing his opinion. He's simply objectively reporting on the facts.

[31:12] And that's why he gets guys like Deeproot to interview with him because it's just an interview where Deeproot came on this show.

[31:20] I'd have a lot more poignant questions, but they're scared of coming on, Brennan. Did I tell you? Like they don't want to.

[31:26] Deep roots, the guys who are now working with Poppity.

[31:30] Yes, yep. I pressed anything that's disgusting. That's my own personal opinion, but I'm never on the show. So I'm just going to say it. I just think the notion of enabling Poppity.

[31:38] Now you talk to, now something you guys don't know about Brennan. So when I was trying to get a magical Brenda actually talked to John Poppity gun the phone a few times, right? What was that like?

[31:48] It was interesting. This was probably about three years ago. Maybe three or four years ago. And yeah, he called me at work out of the blue one day.

[31:57] And just I had originally reached out to him because I wanted to understand what it would really mean to get this game. You know, we were a couple years dating.

[32:04] I was like, Jesus could be really, really interesting. You know, we back and like get him something for this game.

[32:08] Very quickly into my conversation, I realized this game is never going to be because he was just all about excuse after excuse and how hard it is to make a rainbow machine.

[32:17] How difficult it is and how much of his own personal time and effort and resources and nobody understands and nobody will ever understand his vision.

[32:25] I was like, so why are we trying? So we're here now. What three companies in four?

[32:31] Four. Four. The fourth attempt. I just personally think you're wasting your time.

[32:35] The notion of all of the people who you're really giving false hope to. And that's I suppose what's really kind of as someone who's watching this and is like a consumer almost.

[32:44] Like that's what's really kind of pathetic. Well, that's it's interesting because like this is the fourth attempt to bring the game out. And at some point, you have to I just ask, is it worth it?

[32:55] And I asked us of all the the games that end up in these like, Clagmire situations where they can't quite get the game made. So we've got magic girl, all the zidware games, you've got alien pinball, you've got the big Lebowski, right?

[33:10] And I think what's defined my podcast has not just been my commentary, but my sort of never ending and relentless reporting of the companies that I believe are really hurting the hobby.

[33:22] And you know, Brennan, you hear me. I mean, it's like it's hard. It's this balance of like, am I being too negative? Should I be cheerleading and supporting all these ventures? Or should I be asking them to either put up or shut up and go away?

[33:35] Because the more people have their money frozen with these organizations, the more crippling, the more negative, the more sour the hobby becomes because you have people walking around right now.

[33:46] There are people who have bought in on alien in 2014 who are not getting their games, but people who are buying their games last month are getting them first.

[33:56] What do you think about that? What would I mean? It's so many works in marketing and spends a lot of time on the phone on customer service in the restaurant world. I mean, that's just not acceptable.

[34:06] Well, it's like, you know, they find themselves in these situations where they have to do it. So imagine a friend who works for a lobster roll company, which makes the best lobster rolls in the world. Now imagine if people pre-order their lobster roll and they showed up and you're like, you know what, we're out of money, we can't make your lobster roll.

[34:20] But if new people order lobster rolls, we'll get them their rolls first and hopefully we'll get enough new orders to make the old lobster roll people whole.

[34:28] And that's sort of, that's where we are with a lot of these companies. Now, like, I hope they all figured out, I think DeepRoot though is going to, they're going to realize once they take a look at John's designs, how much work has to be done.

[34:40] So, okay, but again, just like last known of that, again, that example you gave, it's still absolutely unacceptable. Like, you just can't do that.

[34:48] So why do you think they're able to do it and do it for years? Like, these people let them get away with it and sound something. They, I mean, they have no choice. Like, they, because imagine, you're the marketer at Luxlopster, imagine the guy who bought, who pre-ordered his lobster roll, right?

[35:03] You have his money. All he wants is his goddamn lobster roll. So you say, but you say it's unacceptable, but imagine if you guys did that.

[35:11] Would you, and then you're meant, you're meant to, we wouldn't be in business. We absolutely wouldn't. I just think between the negative backlash. And I think maybe that's something that the people in this hobby don't have an outlet for. Like, there's no one really championing them.

[35:24] Right. But let me ask you a question because let me, let me, let me say, let's, let's imagine this scenario actually happens.

[35:30] If you knew that you guys took someone's money to give them a lobster roll, would you guys as a company, then say, we're going to do whatever it takes to make sure this person eventually gets their lobster roll.

[35:43] I mean, that's sort of like the mentality of these pinball companies. And, but the problem with that mentality is there's also like financing involved with businesses. And if you can't financially make it work, you're literally just entering into a Ponzi scheme business model where like new money is being.

[35:59] Taken in to try and build old games and eventually it doesn't matter. It might happen in a month or a year. You're just going to run out of money. Like there you can't make up unless you started charging more for the new lobster roll.

[36:13] You got to begin by honoring those, those people who actually enabled your business to get off the ground in the first place. You know, and I told you what you're saying, understand it. Like, but in that case, what is the plan to, to make sure that those people who were the first ones who took that first risk, who, who invested in you and believed in you four years ago back in 2014.

[36:32] And, and what is your plan now to make sure that every single one of those, those people gets their game and are you communicating to them? I think that's the other thing for people.

[36:40] If you put your money down, especially that early, that's fine. You know, you're investing in a hope and you're super excited about it. You call it a theme or a license, right?

[36:47] I know you license. All right. So a license. But so I'm willing to wait, but also communicate with me. And I feel like in this hobby from what I see, it's so cluttered and these companies don't do a very good job about communicating out status on anything.

[37:03] Right. Well, the thing is this is I think what happens is there is no real plan or there, there is no plan that can work. Like whenever we hear Dutch pinball talk, it's sort of like, well, this is the best we could figure out.

[37:16] But if you, again, if you just, if you run the numbers, if you look at it objectively, there is absolutely no way you can make up, which isn't, they're now going on like two years of no money coming in.

[37:27] You can't make up all the lost revenue with, with, with selling the game at the same price. And here's the thing. I just don't understand my pinball companies when they attempt to make a new pinball machine and they run into financial disaster.

[37:44] Why they just don't go away. Like I think people would rather say it's over. I made a mistake. I've learned a lesson. And the next time I buy a game, I'll wait for it to be in a box at a distributor's warehouse ready to come to me.

[37:59] Because if we really count the companies that never have screwed people over, Stern pinball, spooky, Chicago gaming, American pinball track record is good.

[38:10] Jersey Jack, no, Jersey Jack, now I would put in that bucket, but Jersey Jack screwed people over on Wazen Hobbit. They waited three years. And people cut the line.

[38:20] But again, that was before. So Jersey Jack pinball after they've got their angel investor, completely different company. But there would be no Jersey Jack pinball today if Jack did not get his investor.

[38:31] Now I'm happy there is because I know what's coming down the pipeline for Jersey Jack pinball. And it is, it is going to be amazing guys. Like this company is you have you have not seen anything yet. I think Pirates of the Caribbean.

[38:45] I'm hearing reports and Brennan knows I'm in on a pirates just with a pot refund. Sorry, no, I don't know. No, I have a $1,000 refundable deposit. Where's that going to go? I don't know, maybe next to Batman.

[38:58] Our apartment is very small people. But the thing is is I'm hearing from people have played the most recent version that it is incredible. And I didn't get that feedback when people played Hobbit or Wizard of Oz.

[39:10] I got it from dialed in, but this seems to be as fun as dialed in, which is good.

[39:16] Tell me though, I mean pirates as a license that just personally don't like it.

[39:23] How do licenses get picked? And you know, is that something that the companies are listening to what people are looking for?

[39:34] Or they're just going out there and they're kind of taking what's accessible to them. And then they just hope to build up some hype and market market the license.

[39:40] I mean, I don't I don't really know right. I don't know what goes on behind the doors of these manufacturers. I hope they listen to what people want. I think I think half of it is listening.

[39:50] I think most of it is just they need to take what they can get. And by that, I mean, if Jersey Jack goes to Disney and says I want to do the following games, I want to do Toy Story. What do you have available?

[40:00] I'm doing Toy Story? Yes, yes. I mean, I'm just going to say they yes. Everyone knows that that is a rumor titles.

[40:06] I mean, that is a license. I think that so if everyone will get behind it. If they announce Toy Story, Brenda, do I have permission from you to buy one?

[40:14] Absolutely, but it has to go into the place where Batman is. Where are one pin home?

[40:18] I think we can fit to. But here's the thing. I think what happens is they go to Disney. They see what's available because it's very competitive with the manufacturers trying to secure licenses.

[40:29] And I bet Stern has a bunch of Disney properties locked down. Stern has deep relationships with a lot of the different movie studios. So you just can't mosey in and go get like back to the future of Pimball or whatnot. It's harder than people think.

[40:43] I also do think though, there is a complete lack of market research on what would be a successful pin by a lot of these companies.

[40:50] So just you had something that I think is interesting for me because I think one that you were super excited about that equally so I would have been like absolutely thrown into the apartment.

[40:58] You know, that's actually a license I can get behind. And only actually in full honesty watch even watch these movies when I started dating you.

[41:07] Star Wars. I mean, I had high expectations for Star Wars. You know, raw, raw girl power, Ray, I was like this is going to be super cool.

[41:16] I'm 100% get behind this. And then I saw the artwork that you shared with me before the whole thing came out and I was like, what the hell is this?

[41:24] Well, look, I think everything about Star Wars just completely sucked this past like a year. The new movie sucked.

[41:32] The Pimball Machine, look the Pimball Machine doesn't suck. I know you guys who own it or enjoy it.

[41:39] It's not about it being a fun pinball experience only. I think Star Wars just deserved more.

[41:46] But also like the more I hear from people who talk to Steve Richie, the more I hear that their hands were so significantly tied that there wasn't much they could really do.

[41:55] I mean, think about it like this. And this to me is the biggest indicator of how much their hands were tied with this property.

[42:01] Where is the Star Wars topper? The topper for the machine is still not out yet because it's a waiting Disney approval.

[42:09] And let me tell you, this game came out in like June of 2017. So June, July, August, September, October, November, December, January.

[42:22] So we're like eight, nine months since you've owned a machine without the topper being approved.

[42:28] That is never happened before. It just goes to show what a nightmare must have been when they were submitting stuff for Disney.

[42:33] All that being said, you don't put a tie fighter on a spring and you don't have like just an LCD screen just plopped on the plate.

[42:40] I thought it was okay. I don't know any of that stuff. But let's bring it back.

[42:45] So if you say their hands were tied, then what's the point then like chasing some of these licenses?

[42:50] Because they made they they're making millions selling they put they sold every one of Star Wars LEDs.

[42:56] They'd sold so many of the game. I mean, it's because you know, Stern knows if you get the license right, it doesn't matter.

[43:04] It almost doesn't matter if the game is good or not. Like let's take Ghostbusters for example.

[43:08] That is one of the most amazing licenses of all time. The artwork by zombie ate is incredible.

[43:13] It is one of the worst pinball shooting experiences ever ever.

[43:18] The game is a brutal. It's superly hard to play. It's a brutal turd.

[43:23] And the fact that nobody at Stern like when they were testing you'd be like wait a minute Trudeau.

[43:28] In between your sessions with inappropriate pornography, everyone knows this Brenda.

[43:34] You can't put this flipper gap here. Wait a minute. The ball keeps hopping over the outline with these metal rails aren't like didn't any did anyone play that game and say this is not for anyone who's a casual player who loves Ghostbusters.

[43:47] This game is just brutal. I mean, I remember watching like pro players like crazy levy playing it.

[43:52] Like struggling to keep the ball alive. And I'm like, I'm not buying this anyway.

[43:56] But Stern is learning their lesson. I think they're they're going to deliver more in the future because competition is going to increase.

[44:04] And again, knowing what Jersey Jack has coming down the pipeline knowing what other people are working on.

[44:10] I don't think people are going to be throwing $9,000 at Stern for much longer. The game has changed.

[44:15] And Jack is right on the precipice of reaching what I believe is the dream of his company which is to truly like to truly hurt Stern with game.

[44:25] That are going to be must own games that will go down as classics. I really do believe Jack is right there.

[44:32] Jack has good taste in music too. Guns and roses. Yeah, it's great guy. I mean, I love to Jack's accessibility.

[44:39] You know, I mean, he's he's it's such a great family run business when you go in there and you meet with him and you talk with him.

[44:46] You know, he's very genuine and he tells you stories that would blow a lot of you guys away. I mean stories about other people in this industry that would be shocking to you.

[44:56] And I think sometimes people don't realize all the different hurdles that guy had to overcome to make his pinball dream happen.

[45:03] And I would like about Jack is this is he he had a vision for the right way to innovate pinball.

[45:09] He basically his mission was let's make a modern version of the Valley Williams games of all that people love.

[45:14] He didn't do what Andrew highway did what Jerry is doing. He didn't try to reinvent pinball and change all these things that weren't necessary.

[45:22] And because of that, I think his company is in the best position to create the kinds of machines that will last in a world where like people are looking for collector quality, amazing pinball experiences.

[45:35] And I think no one delivers no one's aiming for that as well as he is.

[45:40] What was his last game the one with the dialed in dialed in so that wasn't a license right that was that's an original IP right which won the most trippy awards by the way.

[45:49] I mean when the community spoke about what's the best pinball machine. I think rightfully so that game was was was heavily rewarded.

[45:56] Oh, that's amazing. I mean, I actually had so much fun playing it while I and I think that's the thing about about pinball from me is that it's originally just been about this game.

[46:04] Just like keeping the ball alive the license really isn't something that's important. I think to a casual player as well.

[46:10] You don't understand that there are supposed to be modes that you're unlocking you're supposed to be telling a story and whatnot.

[46:15] So for me, it was a lot of fun to play and I think it just felt modern. It's like you trying to keep up with what's happening.

[46:22] We able to like plug your mobile phone in and even just the notion of the selfie silly but fun.

[46:28] Right. I mean, look, you put a dialed in next to a Star Wars and you tell someone these two games are the same price.

[46:35] They will laugh in your face. They will not understand how that's even possible.

[46:40] But again, the power of the license cannot be taken for granted.

[46:47] 99% of people would rather play Star Wars on theme alone and license alone.

[46:53] But again, Jack let Pat Lawler make... This is Pat Lawler's magic girl.

[47:00] This is a game he's been wanting to make for five, six years.

[47:03] Now that Pat Lawler's next machine will be Toy Story. It will be the moment where you've got the greatest designer of all time making quite possibly one of the greatest film franchises of all time.

[47:17] I think that's the moment. That is going to be the moment where like Jersey Jack Pinball is going to be put on the map and I think orders are going to fly in and he's in Jack's going to sell out of collector's editions beforehand.

[47:28] No, I'm sure Jack. Chris, you're really hyping it up here.

[47:31] No, and I think people are going to play pirates as much as I've been sort of questioning why they picked that theme.

[47:36] I think people are going to play this game and really want one and I think Jersey Jack is...

[47:43] It's kind of like that company where like you don't have to be ashamed of owning every single Jersey Jack game because one game every 18 months is Jack's strategy and everything that have gets put into that game.

[47:55] I think that's the way to go. Sturms approach, like there's shotgun approach of four to five games where like three are mediocre and like maybe one good one comes out.

[48:04] I think that's a tragedy. And I'm also hearing a rumor which could really...

[48:09] And I'm going to share it right now on this episode. I heard a rumor from a very reliable source. Now this is like... I don't know, this might not be true and he could easily say that's not true.

[48:19] I heard a rumor that Lyman Sheets is getting ready to retire. That this might be...

[48:24] Lyman Sheets is the best damn Pinball code or in the history of Pinball coding. He coded Stern's best machines, Metallica, he rec...

[48:33] That's a fun game.

[48:34] He's dead, Batman. So Lyman Sheets is basically been working on Batman for like almost two years. About like a year and a half. But this might be his last game.

[48:46] Now this is just a rumor I'm hearing. If he does retire, his games are going to skyrocket because you just can't replace Lyman Sheets.

[48:55] I don't even know what that means. But anyway. But back to Twippies. So Fair Play to Jack and Team and obviously it sounds well deserved. They racked him up. Yeah.

[49:06] Wacked up those awards. Yeah, they got the most Twippies out there.

[49:09] I haven't listened to your podcast that came out after you learned that you were a winner of the best Pinball podcast. I hope that I don't affect your ratings.

[49:20] Too negatively. But why don't you have you told people how you really felt?

[49:26] Yeah, I mean I put up a podcast afterwards. Again, I feel extremely humbled and excited to have such an amazing listener base.

[49:35] And it is only because of you guys out there who listen to this show that we got those votes. And it's extremely humbling.

[49:43] I was super excited. I was jumping up and down like a little girl in my head.

[49:49] Let me say you guys. So that was what Friday night, a couple of weeks ago.

[49:52] Yeah. And I had worked from home that day and I was going out with my guy friends that night.

[49:57] And it was about seven o'clock. I was running out the door. Chris had nestled himself up into the couch very comfortably. Super excited.

[50:05] There was like a nervous giddiness to him. It was like the night before Christmas almost. He was like Will or Will not sound to arrive and deliver.

[50:12] And here I was like, yes, he ate her. I might off the door. And I'm sitting in a bar with waiting for a drag show to come on surrounded by five gay guys having cocktails and a flaming fantastic time.

[50:26] When all of a sudden my phone starts ringing off the hook and it's Chris. And he is beyond giddy and sounding so humbled.

[50:35] And I think there were definitely tears in his eyes, although he'll say that that's just a music background.

[50:40] Just so unbelievably excited. Like he really genuinely did not think that he was going to be a contender.

[50:46] So from my perspective, so you guys know who truly is very, very humbled by this.

[50:52] Yeah, you know, because I was a third nomination. So the first two and I was I thought for sure like slam tilt would be up there.

[51:00] And I mean, I've said it before and I'll say it again. I think all the Pimbal podcasts are great.

[51:05] My approach and to Pimbal podcasting is in my belief is that podcasts should happen on a timely schedule that you should hear stuff when it happens because conversations do have a half life.

[51:18] I also just like I try to make it entertaining. I've never pretended to be this Pimbal expert. I don't really care about setting high scores or reaching wizard modes.

[51:27] I just want to make you guys enjoy your time as you're commuting to work or you're probably taking a dump on the toilet.

[51:33] It listened to this. But this is what people listen to.

[51:35] No, I know it like it helps. I think my voice helps people like squeezing out.

[51:41] So I appreciate it. And like I think this show is is just unique. I and a lot of it's just because you know I've got listeners who enjoy the more sort of provocative and disruptive stands we take at times because nobody else.

[51:58] I don't think anybody else out there keeps the manufacturers as honest as this show because I'm not here to make friends.

[52:05] I'm here to just tell the truth or try to get to some sort of truth in Pimbal.

[52:09] And I don't think there's a single whether it's manufactured designer, who I ever out there that at one point in a row that you haven't had some sort of negative or negative sort of the right word.

[52:21] But you haven't had a there's definitely been times where you challenged. I've challenged all of them.

[52:26] You know, like I've challenged all of them. And I think because of that I think they all somewhat respect me in the show.

[52:35] I'll say this they all listen to the show like whether it's they won't always admit it. But how can you not listen to what I think is you know.

[52:45] And this is not just my show, but how can manufacturers not listen to all the podcasts out there because these podcasts whether they like it or not we have an influence on the hobby.

[52:56] And that is something that as a company you need to pay attention to. So you think Mike from home pin is happy that all 1300 listeners of this show now know his true colors.

[53:07] That is that is potential buyers that that might not buy from him now. And I think that's what this show you know if this show is super excited about gardens the galaxy.

[53:17] Maybe more people are excited about gardens the galaxy. But if this show is saying like you know what putting the leftover WWE armor on the game is a cheap cash grab I would not go near it.

[53:29] That has influence. I'm sorry, but I just wouldn't get excited if someone was giving me their opinion that would maybe is trying to help me save money. And I I think also if we look at where we probably had the most influence.

[53:41] It's with companies like highway pinball when I'm like everyone should get a refund and they should and I don't think it's right that these companies should ask people to be investors.

[53:52] They should get the product they bought.

[53:54] Are any other podcasts out there saying similar stuff for is it just more a narrative of what's happening.

[54:00] Yeah I mean I think a lot of the podcast will cover the hobby I think what I don't see is I think people are more nervous to go directly after manufacturers because look when you do it here's the downside of my approach when you do what I do it makes it harder to get people to come on your show as guests right it also makes it.

[54:22] That's why I'm on that's why I'm in the race. Well it's a thing is like the stern people they're always really nervous about coming on the show I mean I interviewed Jared and he wouldn't let me air the interview because people at stern wouldn't approve it and see it's behavior like that that always makes me laugh because this is just pinball we're just having a dialogue about pinball there is nothing that Jared said that would have warranted that interview not being aired and that's why I give Dave Sanders so much credit at highway pinball who I interview.

[54:51] Last week last Sunday so Dave Sanders is the lead designer highway pinball now highways a company that I you know constantly was like attacking Andrew's business tactics.

[55:03] But here's the thing and I learned this and I thought about this more over the last week Dave Sanders he is highway pinball like he did all the hard work to get Andrew's vision off the ground.

[55:15] Andrew highway was just like a salesperson who actually you know his vision actually hurt the intelligence and the all the skill sets of a guy like Dave Sanders so I like I love that Dave came on and shared his his stories with us about what it was like going through the the difficult period and where he's at now trying to get alien pinball off the ground.

[55:39] But that's a thing it's like Andrew highway I invited on this show many times he never would come on I know who I would love to have as a guest in the new year because I think this would be the ultimate burning of the hatchet moment and I've asked I've tried to sort of work between mediators but I really would love oric loss and it come on the show and talked me about pinball and I'll say this even more.

[56:01] Oric was the designer wasn't he?

[56:03] Yeah he was the designer him and I had a lot of personal back and forth I would say that I'm I've 100% bird the hatchet on the whole thing I hope he has to and even I know he's he's in this weird place too because he still has not received his alien pinball machine and I think he's adopted the same mentality that a lot of us have is you know what it's not worth like getting frustrated or staring at this anymore like it is what it is just let it go.

[56:30] If you want to come into the thread and talk about the game talk about it otherwise don't read the thread but I would love oric to come on because deep down he's he's just a pinball fan and I think a lot of people fell victim to Andrew highways bad business plan and I think all of us I did too I got really negative I I it's not easy sleeping at night when you're personally attacking people and I think everyone's had this sort of a convalescence recently so I would love if he's listening to me.

[56:59] If he's listening or you listen and you know or a gloss and to have him come on the show and let's just talk about pinball and let's let's move on from from what I believe to be a like a pretty sorted period and pinball history.

[57:12] All right well I'll ask you've been formally invited.

[57:15] Yeah.

[57:16] All right so Chris tell us a little bit about Totten right so for again my perspective Chris really gets super excited about a theme or a license.

[57:25] You'll get really good idea about it you found Totten you you loved the gameplay you loved the the the concept you loved everything about it the simplicity I really enjoyed being able to play that game it was just really accessible.

[57:36] You know you you bought it it wasn't what you expected it to be it honestly was this kind of a piece of shit underneath and you did a lot of work.

[57:44] Right she's not talking about the gameplay yes so I bought this is one of those examples and when you buy sight unseen I bought it from a gentleman in Canada off of pinside he put a new CPR goal play field the whole thing like all the trim was brass played it like the legs and the armor.

[58:00] I get the machine I lifted up and it was like one of the biggest hack jobs ever so he basically put lipstick on a pig that was kind of frustrating Eddie Kramer in New York Pintek if you need.

[58:12] He's the best dude on the planet Eddie spent hours like I think like 80 hours basically not full restore but basically pulling out every mech fixing every bad connector like removing all the hack job elements of the game cleaning every part so it looks better than new.

[58:31] And he basically restored it to a point where like when you lifted it up it looked pretty much as nice as when you close the play field and and look to it is still one of the greatest games ever it really is it's not as deep as some other new games but in terms of just it's a work of art it's hard to explain now what I'm happy to report is the gentleman who bought my toad and amazing guy he's a doctor in Tennessee and toad and was one of his favorite games and he was growing up and his.

[59:00] His wife went in on this on buying my machine and and I'll say this I get accused a lot of times of being a bad seller and this and that I like a ripped off a guy from my fix of Felix Jr all that all that long tail stories that follows my my name but you as this guy I said look man here's the price I guarantee you this game is going to make you really happy I've I've bought a game before site unseen and I know how stressful it is not knowing what's going to arrive so I said I'm going to do it.

[59:29] I just give me half of the money as a deposit now you don't have to pay me the second half into the game arrives and you unpack it and are satisfied with it and I also I said to him look I'm going to get fast Eddie who fast Eddie's the other guy locally who delivers all my machines he's the most incredible pinball deliverer or

[59:49] one of his best friends he's like this amazing dude he wraps a machine for like two hours so it arrives mentor then men and so I actually paid fast Eddie to like wrap up this guy's machine all and I paid for all this personally because I just wanted to make sure this guy was happy now I like for those of us who sell him a machine there's nothing more rewarding than the new buyer being ecstatic being super happy and this guy is like that.

[01:00:19] I mean it is it's a dream machine it looks incredible I'm so happy it's found its proper home and that's that I couldn't be happier so like I don't miss toad in because I had my fun with it for a year and start and start Star Wars about to say Star Wars that man is just so incredible I'm absolutely loving Batman I don't regret putting it in the apartment.

[01:00:40] But back to like this notion of collecting right you you wanted it you got it you took the box it was like scratching an itch then there was magic girl like you never thought you'd get that you got that nowhere on that

[01:00:52] from a collector mentality how does your goddamn brain work.

[01:00:56] I think that what happens in you guys out there can relate to this is you get a game you play it for a while and then you realize it is a game all games get a little bit

[01:01:08] stale you do get bored and you want a new experience I mean it is you know who who out there still playing there you know there are video games from five years ago you know you're you're playing the new stuff you know

[01:01:21] Greg Colton over there is playing Splatoon and Mario Odyssey he's not playing Super Mario Brothers it's because we we want a new experience in the it's still a game in a toy and I think that's what happens to people you know the notion of like is it a keeper

[01:01:36] and that's something that is floated out there a lot and I do think Batman though I do think it's a keeper there is something special about this machine that it's the last thing that Adam West ever worked on and you know it's coming Brenda is like

[01:01:50] he's going to personally call out my name and say Chris answer the backbone because I bought Chris Marquette's machine from coin taker and they had Adam West personally make call outs for all the owners of the SLE's so you tell me when that happens what what SLE owner is going to get rid of a game where Adam West personally calls their name out I can't imagine anyone

[01:02:15] so we're going to figure out that where that one goes then or we just get a bigger apartment let's make some more money that's the other that's the other thing is like well if room if space is a problem maybe we get a bigger place right you're going to you're going to make the money right I thought you're making yeah

[01:02:32] aren't you the male ticket for me because yeah bread winner right over here mm-hmm all the money's in the lobster and New York City apartments are cheap you guys would like honestly going zillow and like we look at apartments all the time

[01:02:43] New York City is the only place where literally on our block which is not even like the treniez neighborhood I could go spend two million dollars on a two-bedroom apartment where nobody would be impressed if they walk through the door that is New York City bring that two million dollars to Ireland right now we'll have the penthouse in Dublin so I want a penthouse in Dublin

[01:03:03] here's what we're I mean what we're what Brennan I do now this is just personally this is how we like a kind of for pinball machines is I've lived in this apartment for 17 years it is you know our monthly cost of living is not that high and so we save our money we save our money like pinball is not something that I buy I don't save up to buy pinball I there is constant savings going on pinball is just it's just a byproduct because right now we don't have kids we're not even married like one

[01:03:32] once you know once we have some little types running around I I think their diapers come to four years anyway so anyway what what is next for this hobby what is going to be that next thing that excites not only you but moves maybe the what's the next step the next chapters

[01:03:49] or innovation that's being worked on right now that you think is going to right excite you look I think what's next for this hobby I think the bubble is going to burst a little bit

[01:03:58] so I think a lot of people are going to stand up there I think that's what I mean by that is I think there's going to be a consolidation by the amount of companies that are out there I also think that we are going to see new young designers come up as the

[01:04:14] have to. You know, when Deeproot shared their photo and it was so funny that they shared

[01:04:18] this photo like all these old designers in a room, I don't think people were excited.

[01:04:24] I think it was more about like here are all the leftover designers that don't have current

[01:04:30] employment or are not getting paychecks from anyone who need work. That to me is not

[01:04:37] what would excite me. What would excite me is if they showed a picture of new young designers

[01:04:43] like in their 30s who are like, I'm going to make a name for myself on Pimball. Here's

[01:04:47] my like and you've never heard their name before because to me the real excite me comes from

[01:04:53] people who are fresh, who are looking at Pimball with new eyes and also have new skill sets

[01:04:59] because they grew up in an error with different technology innovations and have like a desire

[01:05:06] to make a name for themselves. You know, I say to every industry it's like it is people

[01:05:10] who are unhappy that change the world. It is people who are hungry and hustle that make

[01:05:15] things that are special and magical and I think a lot of these old designers, I think

[01:05:21] they had their period, they had their moment and we, I think what excites me is new guys

[01:05:26] like Eric at Jersey Jack Pimball, brand new. Like he's got a mission to make a name for

[01:05:31] himself and that's what excites me watching what he's going to do. Guys like Scott Denise

[01:05:36] he, you know, young guys who, who like, they're just getting started in this hobby. Now

[01:05:41] I also think what's going to happen with consolidation is for some reason everyone thinks they can

[01:05:45] make a Pimball machine and there's all these companies coming out promising Pimball machines.

[01:05:49] I think that's going to, I think you're going to see about two or three companies absolutely

[01:05:54] go away by the end of this year. I also think you're going to see new boutique companies

[01:06:00] that are focused primarily on the high end market come to play and by that I mean small

[01:06:07] volume high price games basically the zidware approach but people are going to think, I

[01:06:13] think people are going to figure out how to do that right because there's money to be

[01:06:15] made but it's difficult but I do think we're going to see some new players in that space

[01:06:23] but we'll see. Is there anyone out there right now who's like going to fit that bill?

[01:06:27] No, I mean like there's nobody out there doing it and like guys I firmly believe if someone

[01:06:32] said I'm going to make a new King Kong Pimball machine, I'm going to make 50 of them and

[01:06:38] I'm going to charge 20,000 each but you know if they actually get it, if the game was done

[01:06:45] and they could show they could make it they would sell out you know and that's no small

[01:06:51] change of the million dollars for 50 machines. You know, can you make it for, can they make

[01:06:57] it with the material cost for half a million and pocket 500,000 maybe? Yeah, how much

[01:07:01] does the game really cost? You know that's I don't know, I don't know. I mean we I think

[01:07:06] the bomb on machines which build up materials are on materials it's something like $4,000,

[01:07:11] $5,000 it depends. Like I think some games like Jersey Jack is barely breaking even on

[01:07:17] what's in the game. Wow. So then when you when someone like you know okay deep root comes

[01:07:23] out that now that's a fresh name right new company is it? Yeah, I mean they're new to the

[01:07:28] Pimball scene. New to the Pimball scene so you know to kind of go back to what you're saying

[01:07:32] this notion of like fresh energy but then they go and they bring in credible, no not really

[01:07:39] but known. I'm probably you can credibility to back together. But they those other guys but

[01:07:45] you said that they're all like guys who are figures who have been in this industry for

[01:07:50] decades. Yeah, look I mean look they they've what is it about them though do you think that

[01:07:55] gives them the belief that they're not going to fall victim to the same pitfalls that other people?

[01:08:00] I don't know I don't know what goes on in the heads of men who decide to make Pimball

[01:08:05] companies you know I think it is a mixture of of excitement of confidence or overconfidence

[01:08:13] of it can't be that hard it's just a toy that we can build and I think what everyone learns is

[01:08:23] that until you build it you shouldn't reveal anything you shouldn't talk about it you shouldn't

[01:08:30] hype it you shouldn't brag about it and you know look deep root seems very confident right now

[01:08:35] in their ability to do it and as I've told the people over there if you make it happen I will buy

[01:08:41] game number one so I hope they prove us wrong but I also just hope they sort of go away and figure it

[01:08:47] out and yeah Robert come on he he's I would love to talk to Robert about it all but also this I

[01:08:54] mean Robert I don't even think you should come on now I don't think it's a good time for Robert

[01:08:58] to talk at all I think Robert should come on the show when he says hey Chris like we proved you

[01:09:05] wrong you know we you said this about us you said we couldn't pull it off and I'm here today to share

[01:09:11] with you that we did and I'm here to invite you on a tour to see you know as making the games and

[01:09:17] and look I have nothing personal against any of the people over there now that I'm out on my I'm

[01:09:23] out of the magic girl drama and look deeper it hasn't taken any money from anybody the only issue

[01:09:29] they face now are the zidware customers and I think that's it's silly to absorb that baggage but

[01:09:34] they decide it they decide it that John pop it Duke is valuable enough right he's valuable enough

[01:09:40] these games will sell if and the that we're willing to accept the baggage that he brings to get to

[01:09:47] those valuable titles and I look I'm here to tell them in the world I don't necessarily think they're

[01:09:53] wrong in that assessment that I think people will line up to buy Alice in Wonderland and Raza if

[01:10:00] they can figure it out and magic girl if they can figure it out it's a big if they can figure it

[01:10:05] out so we'll see what happens I it's it's interesting to see how this develops well that's the

[01:10:11] looks them yeah I look I I want everyone to succeed but if if people start taking people's money

[01:10:19] that's when I will come after companies because I won't I will always be on the side of the customer

[01:10:24] I don't want people to get screwed again we don't need another you know pre-order model to get to a

[01:10:31] game if the game is done then I can see you taking some pre-orders to actually build the games

[01:10:36] but we haven't I can't wait to the day though Brenna I do want to see a working magic girl one day

[01:10:42] I want to see that center mechanism actually do something I want to know what John did for six

[01:10:48] years like what was in his head like can they figure it out that to me that is the most curious

[01:10:54] thing on my mind about pimple is can they make the damn magic girl mechanisms work don't waste your time

[01:10:59] man I will see um all right so what advice then would you give to someone say my brother turns around

[01:11:05] to you now and young fella never been in this industry before he casually likes to play he decides

[01:11:12] he wants to buy a pimple machine what advice would you give him or anyone coming into this hobby with

[01:11:20] a small amount of money they want to invest I would say run away as fast as you can now if you

[01:11:25] had a small money this is the other part that I think people like forget you can go get so many

[01:11:33] good pimple machines between like one in three thousand dollars there are so many great games out

[01:11:38] there that people are flipping and enjoying there's an unnatural focus on the new stuff on

[01:11:45] pin-side and on the forums it's because I think a lot of these guys they they need to justify their

[01:11:51] nine thousand dollar purchase by talking about it non-stop but you can go get you know a demolition

[01:11:59] man a judge dread all these games that they're fun pimple machines and you can you can enjoy them

[01:12:07] you can go get a Jurassic Park all these things that are out there that they're just good pimple

[01:12:12] experiences for people and without breaking the bank and I think that's that's the thing about

[01:12:18] this hobby is it can it can provide fun and entertainment no matter how much money you want to spend

[01:12:27] and and also like I would also advise people do you really need to own it in your home I think the

[01:12:32] first question I would ask someone is how close are you to pimple on location and I don't mean just

[01:12:37] barcades and where pimple machines are out there in in the public but also go on a forum and say

[01:12:44] hey my name's her name's her or those names Dave hey it's Davey here does anyone who lives near

[01:12:50] here have like a pimple collection I'd love to come over and play and you'll find too that often

[01:12:55] times if you're within like a 20 mile radius of some other guy who's got a pimple collection you

[01:13:01] can sort of combine forces and be like well why don't I buy Star Wars you buy gardens of the

[01:13:07] galaxy like you can you can you don't it's silly that you you and your friends all own the same

[01:13:13] machines I think it's like you know because it because in pimples like if everyone has a size 10

[01:13:18] shoe why do you all have to buy the same shoes like eventually you could just loan them out maybe

[01:13:24] shoes are a bad example because they get a great example of my world right but it's just that's

[01:13:29] it I mean I would advise people do you want to play do you want to own pimple you know and

[01:13:35] and and just do it so it doesn't become too much of the center of your universe like when you

[01:13:40] become obsessed with it I think that's when it goes too far how much time do you think is too much

[01:13:46] time spent on these forums in this hobby like head down in a computer screen wait wait too much

[01:13:54] I mean I think everyone will agree like way too much yeah I try to advocate that people

[01:13:59] should spend as much time at the gym or doing something productive as they do playing pimple

[01:14:05] but I think the the people on the forums are somewhat obsessed with it but it but forums create

[01:14:11] compulsive obsessive behavior you know like my friends who are in the tournaments these guys play

[01:14:17] like every day like crazy levy will probably be playing pimple today before the super bowl or

[01:14:21] doing the super bowl every night every social outing is playing pimple and I think what happens

[01:14:27] to a lot of these guys is they become so obsessed with scoring and figuring out how to climb the

[01:14:33] pimple ladder that they miss what actually makes these games fun you know I was reading levy's

[01:14:39] review of Batman and it's you know it's it's like it's all about scoring and and figuring out how

[01:14:46] to manipulate the code to get higher points to him like it's not emotionally fun to put the

[01:14:52] villains in jail he doesn't get excited because he hears like the music during the book I love the

[01:14:56] music it's great the music is so good I think the TV clips the TV clips the Batman is incredible like

[01:15:04] the way each villain and minor villain in the music but again like I haven't gotten that level

[01:15:09] for guys who all they care about is how to find the pathway to the highest score they don't care

[01:15:14] about any of that stuff and I think pimple was meant to be entertaining these games aren't

[01:15:21] designed just for tournament play that is just like you you could do it you could you could make

[01:15:26] a tournament out of any game it doesn't have to be just pimple but I think that people who really

[01:15:34] enjoy the machines and enjoy like all the nuances of the music the callouts all the things

[01:15:39] happening I think that's that's where people are having the most fun and most guys out there who

[01:15:44] listen to this show we all share a common trait most of us kind of suck at playing pimple and that's

[01:15:50] the other part of the collectors is they they they bang about how they want these deep games and then

[01:15:55] most of them will absolutely never see any of it it's just knowing that it's there makes us feel

[01:16:00] better it's kind of weird how many listeners do you have these days uh let's before this podcast we

[01:16:07] have about about like a thousand a 1300 people listen per episode which is great I think yeah yeah

[01:16:13] it is unique it's not just me and in my friends hitting refresh delete cookies uh which is great

[01:16:19] I think this this is sort of we have a consistent listener base um everyone's in a while if I have

[01:16:25] it like a special like Jersey Jack on we might go up around 2000 wow but it's um you get jack on again

[01:16:32] yeah I know I should I should have him on every week but yeah I mean we have we have a great listener

[01:16:36] base and and I think my listeners are incredibly loyal and are obviously prone to activism with

[01:16:45] their trippy vote so again guys let's let's let's just win it every year like we can become I can

[01:16:49] become like the Tom Brady of pimple podcast oh you wish oh make me just I'll let's do that yeah

[01:16:55] let's do that um and what are one of the most common questions you get from from your listeners

[01:17:00] I'm throwing you ones just because like based on what I'm what I see in here and in like what is

[01:17:05] honestly a lot less time that you're spending in this hobby and you are you very respectfully wait

[01:17:09] for me to be either at work or I'm bad before you jump into this I think a lot I think most most

[01:17:14] of the email feedback I get is is that people enjoy the show I get a lot of sort of keep it up um

[01:17:20] that people don't always agree with what I say but they do for the most part uh and I think you know

[01:17:27] they they just love the cadence and the frequency of the show and sort of the show is sort of

[01:17:33] honest or provocative sort of approach um I also get emails every once in a while from manufacturers

[01:17:42] telling me that I'm wrong it's telling me that I don't know what I'm talking about or challenging

[01:17:47] what I say on the show and that's fine it's cool you know like it's a two way thing I say

[01:17:53] stuff on this podcast that it lists its responses from people or makes people think um and I'm saying

[01:17:59] stuff about people's products I mean I it's it's not easy being a critic uh even though it seems

[01:18:05] like it when I say something negative it it it I have to make sure that I feel really confident

[01:18:11] in what I'm saying and that also that you guys for the most part would agree with my assessment

[01:18:16] right because if I was just crapping on everything and you didn't agree with me I think my listener

[01:18:21] base would would erode very quickly if I was just a show that was negative and I don't think I

[01:18:26] am I think I sort of call it like I see it and you're also the first to also revise or edit your own

[01:18:32] original maybe viewpoint or even a review you would have given a game if they do eventually come

[01:18:37] around and you know walk the talk and actually deliver I shit on Batman for an entire year yes you

[01:18:43] did but it like I say it's my my opinions will change and I apologize to people and I've changed

[01:18:51] how I thought about different companies it's just that's but isn't that life I mean who doesn't have

[01:18:56] a change of heart or who doesn't after seeing things differently have a new opinion about something

[01:19:01] so I I don't think that wherever like we're not stubborn on this show I I think we're open-minded

[01:19:07] and I think we we often do make mistakes and I think we apologize when we do make a mistake

[01:19:14] what's your dream license I big trouble in little china and transformers g1 move it that those

[01:19:20] that are either existing licenses no no I think that transformers the movie the soundtrack the whole

[01:19:30] like you would play no no this is 1987 this is or some roles last movie as unicron I just think

[01:19:39] that game lends itself perfectly to pinball I think it'd be incredible I think that if they could

[01:19:48] make that game it would sell like hotcakes I also think big trouble in the china though

[01:19:52] is just the greatest theme for pinball or license for pinball ever where you play as jack burden

[01:19:59] and and if you think about your battling all the different gods in that movie from the thunder god

[01:20:06] to the wind god to to low pan and I just have this vision in my head of low pan as this toy that

[01:20:13] like rises up like inflates and you have the bash them to beat them just the best game best movie ever

[01:20:19] it'd be the best game of all time and it's like it's got that fun like campiness that pinball needs

[01:20:25] I I think themes like the big Lebowski or terrific license integrations for pinball because of the

[01:20:31] humor and and and that's what pinball needs is it needs to make you smile and laugh and and enjoy it

[01:20:39] not not just be like too serious how would you describe what you do to your mother

[01:20:48] mom I I took all the education you gave me and I threw it away it's funny when I tell my parents

[01:20:54] I got voted like the best pinball podcast they're like you have a pinball podcast

[01:20:58] they're probably like what what is a pinball and what is a podcast right well I look my my mom

[01:21:05] has spent her whole life scratching her head at my decisions even though everything that I've done

[01:21:12] in my career both professionally and personally is because my mom always let me be the geek that I

[01:21:16] am I mean my my mother ladies and gentlemen she's amazing Florence I love her I love her to death

[01:21:23] she she got me when I was a child because me and my brother would go to the arcade every day and

[01:21:29] she was worried that we were gonna meet drug dealers and or be kidnapped she said to us if I get

[01:21:35] you to an arcade machine will you stop going to the arcade every day so one day we came home and

[01:21:42] in the living room or in the den was a brand new street fighter to championed edition this was

[01:21:50] when the game first came out in our like living room or in the den can you imagine like a the love I

[01:21:58] would have for mother for all eternity when that happens but every kid on the block would just come

[01:22:03] over every day and we play street fighter to championed edition and I still have that game today

[01:22:08] that game that my mama got me is actually residing in in Robert's game room who listens to the show

[01:22:14] who's taking good care of it but my mom has always been like look whatever you love in life just

[01:22:19] it's going that direction so that I love gaming I love guns and roses everything that I've ever loved

[01:22:26] personally has always become the thing that professionally I've sort of built my career around

[01:22:33] which is great getting in our arcade game when you are a kid I think a lot of your customers might

[01:22:37] agree with me when I say that sense just like being spoiled well look I mean it's like if we factored

[01:22:42] in all the money we were spending in the arcade it probably yes we were a little spoiled growing up

[01:22:47] but it I'll say this I want to be able if I have children with with Brenda this you know spoil my

[01:22:54] kids with the things that they enjoy but also like you know my parents installed in us that you

[01:23:00] need to work hard and you need to make you know your own living and and you need to follow things

[01:23:04] you're passionate about and and I think I've done somewhat successful on my own in life so I don't

[01:23:09] know if you guys can hear this but Bob is literally snoring in the background um what do you think he

[01:23:14] would say to you feed me he doesn't care is that can they make a pinball machine that I can eat that

[01:23:20] dispense his treats that's what he would like um but anyway anything else be we're like we're a

[01:23:27] little over an hour no I mean I'd say people are pretty sick of hearing both of our voices now at

[01:23:31] this point what what so let me ask you are you how do you feel about this whole thing I mean you've

[01:23:38] watched me do this for two years now a lot of the free time that you you would want to spend

[01:23:43] cuddling or me telling you stories I've spent making a podcast what what what what are your thoughts

[01:23:51] um I think there has been a bit of an erroda coaster here both emotional and otherwise with you and

[01:23:57] this hobby in the last two to four years um I think definitely in the last six or so months it's uh

[01:24:05] it's got a lot more positive I think you really spend a lot more time consciously being present

[01:24:10] whether it's with me or your friends or or whatnot and being mindful about when you actually

[01:24:15] commit time to this podcast um you're less in the forums you're less trolling I think in the forums

[01:24:21] and more relying on just real real real conversations with people to to get your news and get your

[01:24:26] information um yeah I mean I'm pro it makes you happy and as I said you never stop putting me first

[01:24:34] so that's a lot of important thing yeah you guys are like honestly you guys want to complain about

[01:24:40] pinball prices like I always tell them take a walk into Gucci and then you'll understand the

[01:24:46] rationale for why people think a nine thousand dollar pinball machine is nothing um yeah

[01:24:51] Bren I always put Brenda first uh she gets more than well I'm second after bubble right yeah

[01:24:57] bubble is always there's that's be honest he's looking at me one eye open um well guys and gals

[01:25:03] out there I want to thank you for your support and listening to this show and Bren I especially

[01:25:08] want to thank you for for allowing me the time because I think a lot of people they do get a lot of

[01:25:14] guilt and pressure from their significant other to give up their hobbies and I've always said

[01:25:20] that people who are the happiest in life are the people that have hobbies that have things that they

[01:25:25] geek out over that is what brings people together it is what makes life interesting it is what keeps you

[01:25:34] sort of excited for the future because you're really excited to see what comes up the things

[01:25:39] you're into and that that's not just true of toys but also of people themselves so I especially

[01:25:44] want to thank Brenda I look forward to getting married to you in December apparently we're gonna

[01:25:48] have some pinball we will have pinball machines at our wedding we're gonna try we are also gonna

[01:25:52] have a table then we might get some pinball some of my pinball friends at as well um but I just

[01:25:59] want to thank everyone for listening because this podcast only exists because people enjoy it

[01:26:05] and there's there's listeners out there if they if you know I see some of the pinball podcasts out

[01:26:10] there and god bless them or they get like a hundred or 200 people every episode but they do it and

[01:26:15] it's because I think pinball is a it's it's a relic that probably should be obsolete that's not it's

[01:26:23] almost like we're living with modern day dinosaurs right it's that's pinball it is this thing that

[01:26:29] shouldn't be around that is around and because it's around it's only around because people like you

[01:26:35] are so passionate about it that you still play pinball you still buy pinball machines and you

[01:26:42] still listen to podcasts about pinball and I think that's that's cool but we're still a really small

[01:26:47] small small small niche hobby but that's what it makes it even more fun as I I love walking into a bar

[01:26:53] where anyone can talk about football anyone can talk about you know movies and music but if you

[01:26:58] were to like let me tell you a story about pinball all right well first thing happens is half the

[01:27:02] bar clears out more than half but the remaining half they you know there's about 10% that will

[01:27:07] actually listen to you but anyway guys this has been episode 200 enjoy your super bowl Sundays

[01:27:14] eat a lot of food run to any final sign off that you have for the listeners of the show
