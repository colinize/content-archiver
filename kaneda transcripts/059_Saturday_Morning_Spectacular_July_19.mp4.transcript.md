[00:00] All right, we are live.

[00:03] We are live in Casa Daca,

[00:05] Neda we are on both YouTube and Facebook at the same time.

[00:10] I can't even believe it took me so long to just realize I could put the phone up

[00:15] where the computer screen is, how is everybody doing?

[00:18] Let's wait for people to come into the house.

[00:20] I haven't done this before double.

[00:22] So you could watch, it's backwards though.

[00:24] I'm looking at mirror images of myself because Facebook won't allow me

[00:29] to flip the mirror around.

[00:31] I got to get that screen thing and you put on the back.

[00:33] What's up?

[00:34] Now, I actually think it's better on YouTube.

[00:36] The mic is better, the quality is better, but I want to give people the option.

[00:42] So we can now make money both ways.

[00:45] What's up, Brian?

[00:46] What's up?

[00:47] Dante Charles Thomas is in the house.

[00:51] Everyone's confused.

[00:52] Where is he?

[00:53] Is he on Facebook?

[00:54] Is he on YouTube?

[00:55] Canate is on both were monopolizing this whole pinball content space.

[01:00] It is a beautiful day here in Rewaiden, Connecticut.

[01:03] It's so beautiful that I don't think I'm going to be doing this for an hour

[01:08] or sorry, I meant more than an hour because it's just too nice out.

[01:12] Join on YouTube, join us live on YouTube.

[01:18] Exciting day for me today because I'm going to hang out with someone.

[01:24] Franci, we're both on Facebook and on YouTube.

[01:27] I missed the Facebook because I could jump around and bring it anywhere.

[01:31] But I also just want to give people options.

[01:33] You know, canate.

[01:34] I'm a man of many options.

[01:36] How's everybody doing?

[01:37] We got Brian.

[01:38] He's out there trying to get rich off pinball.

[01:41] You know, speaking of getting rich off pinball, speaking to my friend,

[01:44] a Neil who does pinquest and, you know, just talking about the pinquest offering,

[01:51] giving him some feedback about it.

[01:53] And in the end, you know, it's funny because I was like, you know, like, why?

[01:58] Like, why does anybody try to make money in pinball?

[02:01] It's just like really hard to do.

[02:03] It is really, really hard to do.

[02:05] You either got to be a distributor or you have to make products.

[02:10] And this is product.

[02:11] This is product.

[02:12] How's everybody doing?

[02:14] Is everybody liking the new NAPS arcade?

[02:16] I got a, I signed up.

[02:19] I got to sign up for the subscription service.

[02:21] I was talking about it.

[02:23] It's so different looking.

[02:24] I got to get used to it.

[02:25] You know, there's something about there was like a comfort with the old blog.

[02:29] And I just got to get used to the new NAPS arcade.

[02:32] Has anyone signed up and been in the, the forum yet?

[02:37] I'm curious what it's like.

[02:39] There's going to be a marketplace of forum.

[02:43] You know what I would do?

[02:44] I would just make a better pin side.

[02:45] I mean, that's the goal.

[02:46] That is the goal.

[02:48] Pinxides very addictive.

[02:50] I mean, Robin did a good job making a very, very addictive site that makes people want to keep going back.

[02:57] You know what he did well?

[02:59] He's a gamified being a jerk.

[03:01] I mean that like he made being a jerk fun.

[03:04] So like, and I just want to get as many thumbs up or thumbs down as I can.

[03:09] And for some reason, these grown men are like, they feel validated that they got a thumbs up.

[03:13] Oh, yeah, I said something that eight other alcoholics agreed with.

[03:17] Welcome to pinxide.

[03:19] The smartest people never go on pinxide.

[03:21] And I would say 90% of pinball buyers and owners are not on pinxide.

[03:28] They're not.

[03:29] They're just, they are not on pinxide.

[03:31] They don't care.

[03:32] When you go to a pinball show, it's always fun.

[03:34] I'm just going to move this here this way.

[03:35] Like I'm staring, you know, I think it'll work well.

[03:40] I'm not just on YouTube right now.

[03:41] Tell me does it look like I'm looking at the screen because I literally have my phone in front of my screen.

[03:47] 24 people over here, 12 people over here.

[03:51] It's Saturday.

[03:52] Where's the audience?

[03:54] Has Canada lost it?

[03:55] Can you guys give money?

[03:56] Is it working?

[03:57] Are the super can someone try the monetization?

[04:02] Anyway, we're going to talk all about what's going on in pinball.

[04:05] If you're a member of the canada club, this week, I will tell you what I think the new Steve Richie

[04:11] or the next Jersey Jack game is going to be.

[04:15] I've got a, I've got a feeling on something.

[04:18] It's a root.

[04:19] You know, it's like, look, I haven't seen it.

[04:20] I always say, unless I've seen it with my own eyes,

[04:25] stare, let me look upon you, Canada, with my own eyes.

[04:28] Unless I've seen it with my own eyes, I, I don't know.

[04:31] They have like five titles somewhere in the mix.

[04:34] So Jersey Jack is going to make, you know, Steve Richie's next marks side in.

[04:40] I don't think is on a game.

[04:43] I think he's helping out how much are Kong Ellie's going for now?

[04:46] Nine.

[04:48] Kong Ellie.

[04:50] What's up, Andrew?

[04:51] Wayne, thank you for the stars.

[04:53] Can someone test to see if, can someone test to see if the monetization is working on YouTube and send me $50?

[05:00] You're like, I'm just, I'm joking, but I'm not.

[05:01] We're going to make some money here.

[05:03] We're going to give big shout out to the leaderboard as we go.

[05:06] So right now we got Wayne with 50 stars, which is nothing.

[05:09] Wayne, come on.

[05:10] We need 5,000 stars.

[05:13] I think Kong Ellie is going to be easily a $9,000 game by the end of the year.

[05:22] And anyone who bought an L.E.

[05:25] Now I heard something else.

[05:27] I'll just talk about it here.

[05:30] I heard a rumor.

[05:32] And you know, rumors like these, I don't really like feel it, like it's my position to,

[05:41] again, just what I'm about to say.

[05:45] Please, please, please, take it with a grain of salt.

[05:49] The thing I'm about to say is that I'm hearing a rumor.

[05:54] And this is so rumor that Keith L.

[05:58] Wins contract with Stern might be coming up.

[06:03] And he might be looking to go elsewhere.

[06:08] I don't like rumors like that because like, you know, it's like, I think he's going to stay at Stern.

[06:16] But if he were to go somewhere, it would be there, Jersey Jack Pimble.

[06:31] Imagine a Keith L.

[06:33] Let's just imagine for a minute, right?

[06:35] We can imagine he trades, he switches teams, right?

[06:39] Imagine is the chat working guys?

[06:42] Is this working in YouTube?

[06:44] Is it working?

[06:44] Because no one's chatting.

[06:45] Imagine, imagine Keith L.

[06:51] Wins making a Jersey Jack game.

[06:55] Now, I think that would be the greatest thing ever.

[07:05] Because the Jersey Jack platform is the nicest.

[07:11] You know, someone just said it would crush Stern.

[07:14] I know that they tried to get Keith L.

[07:17] When they got Steve Richie, they actually want it.

[07:23] Keith first.

[07:26] He declined.

[07:28] I think Keith L.

[07:29] Wins had a very successful career at Stern.

[07:33] I think the years pros and cons.

[07:35] Let's talk about the pros and cons, ladies and gentlemen, of Keith L.

[07:39] Wins moving to Jersey Jack.

[07:43] Pro.

[07:45] He can make games with bigger bombs,

[07:49] with more of a beautiful platform.

[07:52] He'd have more to work with.

[07:54] Pro.

[07:58] I think he would, I think,

[08:02] you know, I'm trying to think of like,

[08:05] I think he'd make more money.

[08:07] I think he's handsomely paid at Stern though.

[08:09] I don't think Keith L.

[08:10] Wins is sort of, you know, short, short end of the stick when it comes to salary.

[08:15] I think he's handsomely paid.

[08:19] Now Todd said something interesting.

[08:21] J.J.P.

[08:22] should pay Keith one million per year.

[08:26] I think he's worth that.

[08:28] I do.

[08:30] I think it's criminal.

[08:32] I don't think distributors should make more money than Keith L.

[08:35] Wins.

[08:36] Now, I'm not saying districts are making a million a year,

[08:38] probably some are making like half that at least.

[08:41] And I think the best pinball designer in possibly history

[08:49] should make a million dollars a year,

[08:51] considering what these games can move volume wise.

[08:54] The thing is this.

[08:57] I think the smart play.

[09:00] Yeah, he's not making, yeah, he's not making him here.

[09:03] I think what's interesting is,

[09:06] if you look at like Harry Potter, and I think about this,

[09:09] Harry Potter would sell good or bad thousands of units.

[09:15] And I mean, it's good or bad.

[09:17] Now, I think Eric made a great shooting game.

[09:19] Great shooting game.

[09:20] Is it as good as King Kong to shoot?

[09:23] No.

[09:24] Like, let's just, let's just be honest here for a minute.

[09:26] Eric Minier is not as good as Keith L.

[09:29] I don't think anybody would argue that.

[09:31] I don't think Eric would say he's as good as Keith L.

[09:34] He's not like he's, it's just, it's, it's, it's just not there yet.

[09:40] I would say that the best two designers going right now in pinball

[09:44] are Keith L. and Steve Richie.

[09:47] And I don't think people would say Eric is even third.

[09:51] Maybe.

[09:52] I don't know.

[09:53] Let me think about this for a minute.

[09:54] Who's the third best designer in all of pinball right now?

[09:57] Because you might make an argument that like evil dead,

[10:00] maybe bugging Luke, are they up there now?

[10:02] Like Luke, is it, is it bug?

[10:04] Is it, I don't know, is it John Borg?

[10:07] No.

[10:08] Is it Brian Eddie?

[10:09] I don't know.

[10:10] D&D wasn't bad.

[10:11] It wasn't bad, but it wasn't like, wow.

[10:13] You know, Eddie's much more fan layout.

[10:16] Who do you guys think is the, the third best designer in pinball right now?

[10:26] I'm reading both threads.

[10:28] I know evil dead is now selling for 15,000.

[10:31] That's amazing.

[10:32] John Ehrlich, we're on Facebook, we're on YouTube.

[10:35] We're backwards on Facebook because they don't let you flip it around anymore.

[10:41] Yeah.

[10:42] Well, how did I forget about this guy?

[10:45] Of course.

[10:47] Of course.

[10:48] The, well, I actually think he might be the best designer in pinball.

[10:52] Oh my god.

[10:54] Can we just say, sad boy just gave one hundred dollars.

[11:00] I think this is the most sad boy I've ever got in a single donation ever on a live broadcast.

[11:12] One hundred dollars.

[11:14] And I want to read what he said.

[11:17] Predator is DOA cup head cup head.

[11:20] No way to be found.

[11:22] Benem L. Lee's for 8500 Potter AI disaster Kong is whatever.

[11:26] Jaws 50th is dope.

[11:28] And I lost 13 hundred dollars at the casino the other night better than buying a wick hourglass topper.

[11:36] Go get some sushi with this cash brother.

[11:40] Thank you so much sad boy.

[11:43] What's your, what's your name name because it sounds like a nickname.

[11:47] Love you.

[11:50] And you get like see this is why canada has wane wane you gave me 50 stars when you gave me like 50 cents.

[12:03] I love it.

[12:04] Come on.

[12:05] Keep it coming.

[12:06] Let's look you take over the show when you donate the dough.

[12:09] Oh, that's going to be my new phrase.

[12:11] You take over the show when you donate the dough.

[12:16] All the other content creators out there be like damn you doing it still.

[12:21] Canada lost the trippy was second place this year.

[12:26] Even though he got a hundred more first place votes he lost the weighted Gen Z woke scoring system got him.

[12:36] Yeah, predator is DOA.

[12:38] Okay, Jack danger is the name I forgot.

[12:42] Jack danger I'm going to go back on what I said I think Jack danger is the best designer in Pimbal right now I do.

[12:52] And I will fight you if you disagree.

[12:55] I think Jack danger is above Keith L.

[12:58] I said it.

[13:02] I said it.

[13:04] Wane 200 stars.

[13:05] Thank you.

[13:06] I think it goes Jack danger Keith L.

[13:09] Win Steve Richie.

[13:12] That's it.

[13:14] That's it.

[13:16] Melbourne Pimbal Expo.

[13:17] What's up guys?

[13:19] They gave my seat to Eric Minier.

[13:23] No, they did it guys they invited me to Pimbal Expo.

[13:26] I wasn't sure I could go Eric is going.

[13:29] It's an expensive flight.

[13:31] We were going to do a Canadian fundraiser to raise a ticket to get me to Australia.

[13:36] We could still do it.

[13:37] We could still do it.

[13:38] But as I said, Canadian flies business class when it's over like even I'm going to Austin Texas.

[13:44] I'm going to Austin Texas tomorrow.

[13:48] If anyone's in Austin tomorrow and wants to hang out with canada.

[13:54] Maybe we can make it happen.

[13:56] I'm going for a work meeting on Monday rehearsal tomorrow.

[14:01] And you know, they put canada in coach.

[14:04] It's our company policy coach domestic business class international.

[14:10] They didn't get the memo.

[14:12] Canada don't fly coach.

[14:15] So yeah, they booked the ticket and went in this morning delta.

[14:52] I'm going to load.

[14:55] I look this is 450 bucks people by the way.

[14:59] When you think about the fact that like a stern toppers two thousand dollars.

[15:04] They get at a dodge.

[15:07] It's loading.

[15:08] It's loading wait for it.

[15:10] I got it all set up to go.

[15:24] I'm so excited to play donkey Kong bonanza.

[15:26] I don't even want to watch the intro yet.

[15:29] But when you think about Frank, I can't believe you just gave me a dollar.

[15:33] I can't believe you are going to come in at the bottom end.

[15:39] But you still you give the dough you take over the show Frank Mac ladies and gentlemen.

[15:43] My good friend Frank the angel.

[15:45] One of my best buddies local.

[15:57] Just yeah just keep giving a dollar every bride.

[16:01] Thank you.

[16:03] Look everybody.

[16:06] Keep the stars coming on Facebook.

[16:08] I got 65 people on YouTube.

[16:10] 30 people on Facebook.

[16:12] Does this work for you guys by the way?

[16:15] I'm just like doing it on both.

[16:18] YouTube and Facebook are you guys feeling the vibes?

[16:21] Is it okay?

[16:23] Is Canadian making it easy for everybody to witness the gun show?

[16:28] I can't do the guns on Facebook as much.

[16:31] But I see the screens wider on YouTube.

[16:35] So yeah.

[16:38] You know retro Ralph won't talk to me anymore.

[16:41] Don hasn't accepted any of my apologies.

[16:44] John Early and I are still buddies.

[16:47] We want to you know look I want to serious note.

[16:50] Really really sad Rob Anthony passing away this week terrible moment for the Pimple community.

[16:56] Our thoughts and prayers are definitely with Rob's family his friends a lot of which are my close friends in this hobby.

[17:05] Joe body real brand is these guys are really close with with Rob so I know they're taking it really hard and it sucks like it's.

[17:13] Yeah I'm assuming he was young too like it just it's a short.

[17:22] Life is short is what I want to say.

[17:26] So be kind until it's time not to be kind to pinball brothers predator.

[17:33] Let's talk about what's going on in pinball people should we get into it?

[17:37] Should we get into it?

[17:39] Let's start with Harry Potter.

[17:42] What's up Hector Miami Hector Hector I got a warn you brother.

[17:48] Our boy here sad bow just donated a hundred bucks now Hector Hector has been a big Donator of canators big ball podcast.

[17:57] Yeah I love the name patreon because these are my patrons.

[18:00] You know I feel like some Renaissance artist in the pinball space.

[18:06] Let's talk about Harry Potter.

[18:09] I think Harry Potter is a game.

[18:12] That is is really making people happy and and I you know you can nitpick certain things you know how I feel about the Jersey Jack coding approach.

[18:23] I'm going to have some intimate conversations with some of the leadership at Jersey Jack in the next few days and weeks and just giving them some feedback.

[18:33] But there's no denying the fact that Harry Potter is taken off has been well received and people are just really enjoying it.

[18:46] And you know you have to reach a point in pinball where that's what it's all about right I mean that's what it's all about.

[18:53] I don't think it's a game for everybody I think there's things I would have done differently I don't think it's loaded.

[19:00] People thank you for the $2 brother I appreciate it.

[19:04] You're now beating Frank Mack by a dollar.

[19:08] I think that and for those of you on Facebook.

[19:12] You send the dough you take over the show.

[19:15] Okay so I think it's it's really well received I think the the way to get one is going to be what makes people you know and the one thing.

[19:29] And this is like I hope this doesn't become an issue I think they're getting ahead of it because I saw on some of the new shipments.

[19:37] Crazy it this wasn't there from the get go the play fields were chipping by the scoop by the mode scoop below the upper right flipper.

[19:47] Little chip hairline chips right right on the where the scoop entrance is now they have a cliffy there.

[19:54] Why they didn't have that ready to go on day one I confuse me.

[19:59] But there are already fixing it at the factory it's why you don't want one of the first ones you know if you got one of the first ones you got the AI artwork and you.

[20:09] You have to now add a cliffy which is never fun it's always a pain in the ass.

[20:14] So I think Harry Potter is going to be a very successful pin for Jersey Jack I also think.

[20:22] It's going to lose a lot of value because they're going to make so many of them not yet you know what I'm saying like not quite yet but I still I 100% 100% we're going to see Harry Potter C.E.s sell for around $10,000 within a year.

[20:44] It's just it's just the way it's going to go the thing that could alter that is I don't think people are going to be selling this game that much Wayne thank you for the thousand stars brother really do appreciate it we got Wayne with the thousand we got sad boy here thank you so much I really appreciate it.

[21:04] Wayne's a great guy Wayne's over there in Australia Wayne has given me some really great insided and that I won't say scoops but like when when Damien Hardin was doing his shenanigans Wayne was one of the only dudes like me.

[21:19] That was calling him out on his BS and everybody was saying Wayne's being vindictive and so is Canada no we were just trying to help y'all and we would have saved y'all money instead some of y'all lost y'all some of you lost.

[21:33] Some of you lost $15,000 ordering a centaur edition whatever that stupid edition was with a bike helmet.

[21:41] I just don't know people are going to sell Harry Potter a lot you know what I'm saying it doesn't feel like a game that is going to come and go in people's collections.

[21:56] It and you know I think that's that's the thing about it so it might not go all the way down but it's going to go down it's going to go down I actually think the wizard edition is the nicest edition.

[22:08] I think it's the nicest edition I think the top or on the CE is garbage and Dana what's up buddy Dana we're on Facebook and we're on YouTube so you can join gang thumbs up if you want me to do it like this every week the double platform.

[22:24] It's really easy for me to do I don't think anyone misses out and I think it gives people two opportunities it's also nice because Facebook will show this video to like 4,000 people then retro Ralph and Don will watch it later today and still not talking to me but that's that's the good thing about Facebook you know is everybody.

[22:46] I do someone ask like why is Ralph not talking to me I don't really know I don't know.

[22:51] Kale and I are trying to figure it out.

[22:56] But we had a fun we have a fun chat going between Jamie Kale myself and Ralph and then Ralph removed himself from the chat so I don't know I don't know feelings hurt somewhere feelings hurt don't turn into a Gen Z person Ralph come on you're supposed to be retro Ralph.

[23:15] Right like we're children of the 80s and the 90s were supposed to be able to take it and dish it.

[23:23] Ah man.

[23:27] Okay so here's the thing the next game from Steve Richie I'm going to give you guys a little bit of a hint it's not matrix it's not top gun it's not Sonic the Hedgehog it's not Super Mario Brothers.

[23:46] It's not a movie from the 80s or the 90s.

[23:54] That's all I'm going to say.

[23:57] And I'm worried about it if what I think it might be it is I'm worried about it.

[24:04] I think it yeah that's all I'm going to say I don't like I'll say this I think.

[24:10] I think your Harry Potter won't lose any value because of what's coming out after it.

[24:25] Orbiter Albert doesn't like.

[24:29] Dana thank you for the thousand stars buddy this is great this is you guys are the best.

[24:38] You know I wake up I wake up some days in better mood than others but I love waking up every Saturday knowing I get to hang out with

[24:47] Frenchie and Charles Thomas and Robert and Brian Cosmer Wayne Anthony Gray Dana Pete Rosen Hector you guys are all over the freaking world.

[25:00] It's a beautiful sunny day here in Rowein and Connecticut I'm looking out the window my beautiful wife is is is is is gardening right now she looks really hot by the way when Brenda gardens I got to say it's like it's a good view from up here just saying I love my hot wife.

[25:15] And the two kids are with her and family of four my parents are still around I've got awesome pinball friends I've got awesome people at work I love I've got some really fun projects I'm working on I feel blessed I feel blessed.

[25:34] I also wish I bought more than just a few bit coins like two years ago in my financial advisor told me to put more into it but I did buy some and I'm very happy about that.

[25:44] I know everyone doesn't want to think about that right like five years ago if we didn't buy ten thousand dollar pinball machines and we just bought Bitcoin when it was like seventeen thousand coin think about it think about it don't think about it please don't think about it.

[25:57] You you like literally be like I can't believe I actually pay twenty thousand dollars or a James Bond sixty it when Bitcoin was thirty thousand dollars.

[26:10] Yeah but it's not an investment can either yeah yeah it kind of is when it's as much money as other things you should be investing in it kind of is.

[26:23] And then you lost twelve thousand dollars isn't crazy you you lost twelve thousand dollars on your James Bond and you would have made a hundred thousand dollars on your Bitcoin.

[26:35] But it's not an investment canary to these cheap plastic toppers I mean seriously you can walk into a best buy and get a switch to hours of fun this is a quarter the price of a stern topper what happened to pinball women are really expensive.

[27:00] I've got all Brenda's rings here I'm like literally Brenda's jewelry is right next to me I'm not going to show you but I'm counting yeah you know you know the she's got this she she she I don't normally buy Tiffany because it's like you know over price you're paying for the box but like they have beautiful jewelry like let's let's be honest.

[27:27] We are I got a couple bracelets and then you know they were like moderately price sad boy again man.

[27:36] I love that sad boy with the twenty dollars I love this dude by the way like he do you you're you're at my speed man you're at the casino I've lost thousands at the casino I've lost thousands sports betting some weekends.

[27:48] Few whiskey's in me bro we're live we're on the night train baby that's the one thing about Harry Potter you can never be on the night train you know what I'm saying like you can't like have a few whiskey's and then let's go play Potter like let's be honest people you have a few whiskey's in you and it's Saturday night you're like God let's go like welcome to the jungle baby like this machine still rocks out like you're not going to like let's go to Hogwarts bro we wasted not happening.

[28:17] Anyway he said shout out for Johnny come out for being a Johnny come lately who drinks hate or a damn I love the donation of the money for you know for us to troll Ralph a little bit and watch you know it's the thing about Ralph I really like retro and he knows that and it's but he can't joke around about it like it's just weird to me it's so weird to me.

[28:42] You know we're all grown men with disposable income like just if you've reached that point in your life and a blow hard pinball content creator who doesn't even play pinball who's got the most successful pinball podcast in history who is insecure vain narcissistic and sociopathic if that guy with a bad haircut.

[29:12] Makes you want to like like get you upset it's on you it's on you Ralph I it's so obvious you know my angle which is just to entertain bro.

[29:27] And like most of you guys never turn on your machines you know you walk by and do I really want to play turtles ever again now you're good for the rest of your life with turtles we know it.

[29:36] Oh man guys guys like Ralph has not had a gender transition the world's funny now like I think about how just sensitive men have become and and like it impacts all of us now but like men are the new women like literally the last like 10 years.

[30:06] Well new like young men now like are there any like is anyone left like are any dudes left out there you know it's funny because I work in an industry where like legit one of the briefs I have I'm not going to name the client Dana thank you is to help bros get back to hanging out with their bros.

[30:27] I like whatever's happening on Facebook I love it get bros to go back to hanging out their bros and I'm like and you gotta remember like I walk into what's usually like mostly a room filled with women and I'm like.

[30:46] Uh y'all created this problem like what do you mean Chris I'm like well it's usually the wives and the girlfriends that are like the reason why guys can't get together like they used to like what are you talking about like right there.

[31:03] Now the thing is is you got to marry a cool a cool one and I married a cool woman I mean she's off the boat Irish this is something about the off the boat Irish woman.

[31:15] They're like soft of the earth like they're not pansies like they're not weak they don't put up with they don't put up with men but they but they they treat their man right there's a that that's the key anyway.

[31:30] All right let's get back to pimples so we went to potter Jersey Jackson thank you for the every time Wayne gives me a thousand stars I have these funny glasses on this is really awesome we've now got some great let's get a goal let's set a goal here I can do super check goals.

[31:50] All right.

[31:56] You know I can set a goal of like a hundred dollars and then I'll tell you what I think Steve Richie's next game is I can try I don't I don't want to do it like that.

[32:09] I because I want my podcasters to hear it first.

[32:13] Yeah I don't want I don't I don't I don't always I don't want to hold my content hostage for additional amount I will never I don't have tears like I don't do that game of like for this tier like you ever notice like pinball content creator tears how bad they are like you know I'm saying there's like there's like the first tier which is like all anybody wants which is usually like.

[32:35] And that's why like for canada like my tears I don't promise you anything more like I love that I have people that give 10 15 a month 30 a month some 50 some 100 I love those people right it's just they're donating because of the means they have and how much they enjoy the content but I always love it when people try to create like arbitrary value like oh yeah for for 10 a month like you're going to get like.

[33:05] First look at my video like for 30 a month like I'm going to let you see my show notes for 50 a month like I don't know man like I'm going to tell you what I'm having for dinner every Wednesday for 100 a month I'll give you this polo shirt I don't think anyone ever got a polo shirt you know I'm saying like so I just I just find it funny it just you know I'll put you in the credits like it's like it's.

[33:30] Just stop like just let's just call it what it is it's crappy pinball content all of it all of it is crap all of what we have created it's crap and like when you know you're just putting crap out into the world.

[33:47] Just make it good crap funny crap because it's crap right like like legit like 50 years from now they're going to be like man man like remember like head to head pinball.

[34:00] Oh nobody nobody even five years from now can it like I guess the thing for me is I'm on episode 1,100 and 15 right like retro

[34:12] is on like 37 he's telling me telling me he's going to remove me from the chat he's going to he's bailing out on episode like no like Ralph 1,100 and 15 podcasts about pinball brother you're in it you're in it you can escape canada it's not going to happen bro.

[34:36] And they never seem like they're having nearly as much fun and they're at like they'll do it like these round tables you know like Jamie Cal and Ralph like like let's actually seriously since like talk about this hobby like like this is a thing like like people are spending $45,000 on three pinball machines and yet the average medium income in the world is $7,000 there's people dying all over the world but that wizard mode isn't in yet.

[35:01] Like I really think it's it's it's you know how can we live in a world in which in incomplete pinball machine is sent out and that could send kids to college but you know like let's discuss this though let's let's let's put on a serious face and put on the headset and unsubscribe from canada's pinball podcast everybody let's talk about let's talk about stern okay so next by the way I'm having a good time I hope you're having a good time.

[35:28] I really do I hope you're entertained because this is what it's all about okay so stern's next king Kong is I feel bad for calm I do I feel bad for calm the master baiting gorilla arms are falling off the shots are great the upper shots like that wire formed by the airplane a loop around the shots in Kong are phenomenal

[35:53] but then you got stupid stuff being said like Neil McRae's like the Gong shot is the greatest shot in him no it's not Neil these guys can put like ears and this is great I love this no the Kong Gong shot is not one it's every time you hit the Gong and King Kong your game is losing $15 that's what that shot is

[36:23] I just feel bad for Kong because like recycling the art across all three models and you know like it's just like no assets no empire state building it's just going to come and go it's it's the it's the modern day Avengers

[36:40] I don't think there's any better way to um to describe this game Avengers is a I think Avengers shoots amazing I think Avengers has amazing toys and yet you don't really want it like nobody really talks about it so this is the next Avengers

[37:00] all right what do we got here what do we got here oh sad boo okay hold on shout out to all the men man I'm not going to say that word in the world who need to find their look I look Albert I don't disagree with sad sad boy here is it sad boy B.O.I

[37:26] I think men have been emasculated we have and and when you try to grow out like it's like the dudes now they're like chill bro chill like it's like come on man he's not wrong he's not wrong Albert

[37:39] and here's a thing women for the most part want manly men back in the world like they just do okay so after Kong we're talking

[37:55] Star Wars Star Wars is Kong better than Iron Maiden in my opinion it is and I'll tell you why I can't stand Iron Maiden music I I literally never understood why that band was even remotely popular I would rather own a King Kong and an Iron Maiden

[38:22] now and yeah so that's that's my answer can two things be true Chris Eric thank you for the for the two bucks I am a manly man who isn't going to make fun of other men just because they are not as freaking manless me

[38:47] yes those two things get me true I think the moment you call yourself a manly man you're instantly not a manly man you know how you say this at work when you self describe with adjectives it usually means you're not that okay so in my field of work it's like whenever we say here's a fun idea I'm like well by saying that it's now not fun here's an awesome idea no don't say it like one of my

[39:17] best piece of it as a advice is ever comes from my really good friend Joe Brown Joe Brown is a great journalist he used to be editor and chief at wired magazine right he now has a great website it's called one one five C I believe it is about is about

[39:37] in its environmental website helping people you know keep the temperature down so we don't flood our coastlines anyway he told me once when I was really young in my career

[39:47] and I didn't really know as well as I do now but he's like I had a press release and it was like it was like oh you know imagine if it was like storm pinball releases groundbreaking new game like King Kong

[40:00] and he'd be like don't tell me it's groundbreaking I'll tell you it's groundbreaking right don't describe with adjectives what your thing is let people say it

[40:16] all right what do we got here honestly pinball manufacturers need to fix the dirty problem they have with free play barcades

[40:28] what's the problem with free play our case I think it's a problem that we can't have both without debate it should be totally okay to bro out and be super masculine just like it should be yes I agree Josh

[40:46] you know we I'm not going to go down this road of thought I just know we're going to talk to him we're here to talk to him well

[40:53] okay so here's the thing no first of all like nobody in pimples like real like bro bro like pinball pinball nerds got their asses kicked you know in high school like let's be honest like we weren't the cool kids you know like oh yeah man like yeah man like I'm dating the high school cheerleader and I'm a pinball wizard said nobody ever we the pinball guys were the loose like the pinball guy is really cool

[41:23] let's be honest people in the 90s the dudes that were cool mastery fighter you know tron Daytona USA

[41:37] you mortal combat the dudes hanging around the pinball machines like let's be honest like some of those dudes look like like Chris Hanson was about to come out and be like excuse me sir can you have a seat over here you know like like seriously like let's be honest it's different now it's different now

[42:05] because I think most of us were not really into pinball in the 90s when we were kids of the arcade we like pinball was like what you jumped on as you waited for the other stuff to open up like nobody went there was like I'm going to get see a far can get an Adams family today nobody nobody you just want to see the hand come out and grab the ball

[42:25] you pay $15 to play pinball and when you get over to the machines they're all sitting there with a four play game started and a ball sitting in the shooter lane all right what's this hold on a second my powers dying all right hold on

[42:47] okay all right we're good hold on okay we're good oh where do we go I can't see anybody I'm alone there we go we're back all right oh my god what is happening okay um okay

[43:17] hold the start button reset the game I don't know do people really have problems at free player Cades I've never heard people really complain that much about it um our G and R3K a canada only you and I will know who paid for my canada club all right

[43:37] ah Albert someone someone someone gave you money to sign you back up I love it you know you can give the gift of canada it's like the gift of gab that I have

[43:47] um all right so shall we talk about star wars do we think we're going to see it early September that's what I think

[43:57] I think it's going to be episode three four three four four five and six new hope empire and return the Jedi

[44:07] dude that's amazing Albert I bet it was I hope it was done

[44:13] does Ralph have memberships

[44:19] you know I um I think Stern's in trouble I I really do I think the reason why I think

[44:28] Stern's in a little bit of trouble not a lot of trouble but just a little bit of trouble I just

[44:32] think Stern like they just seem like it seems like they're like stuck in their own process

[44:41] and let me um let me expand upon what I mean by that I just think like this whole thing of like

[44:48] they it's like they built this entire company around a process and around a formula and and they

[44:59] forgot the formula that made them successful and that's the weird part about it is like you know

[45:05] I'm saying is like the formula that worked was games were more affordable games had better themes

[45:16] and Ellie's had 500 units so the formula that made Stern really successful 500 Ellie's of really

[45:24] great themes where there was more variety in every sense of the word and and in Ellie was

[45:30] 7500 a premium was 6800 and a pro is 5 grand I get that price has had to increase

[45:40] but not where they are now so they so they built this big factory based on that formula bait for

[45:48] the most part and they witnessed a a covid frenzy free a feeding frenzy around their

[45:56] product and so they scaled up to a size now where they need to try to like be successful now with

[46:05] a new version of that formula which I think is is is is dangerous jack danger welcome to the party brother

[46:12] you missed it out jack I was just listing the three best designers in all of pinball

[46:21] initially I forgot about you and I said elwin richi and then maybe bug and I was like I'm forgetting

[46:29] somebody and then I was like danger and I have you at the top of my list of best pinball designers

[46:40] and I think it goes danger elwin richi and and I love you brother and I know you work at Stern so

[46:49] tell this to the new cmo they've got this formula of like three cornerstones a year plus

[46:57] anniversary additions plus remastered games a thousand of every Ellie a ridiculous price on the

[47:05] Ellie's a ridiculous price on the toppers and it's like we're just they just doesn't work

[47:12] we're tired it only works if it's like take my money now dream theme which they're usually not

[47:22] and then every way every game starting to look the same they're like they can't get spiked

[47:27] three out because they need the price increase and they don't want to because they know

[47:32] if they know like can you imagine if Kong Ellie was 13-5

[47:45] it's just it's tough Todd Tuckies in the house T and T baby T and T

[47:53] we go back Todd we go back like peanut butter and jelly like Stern and 6500 Ellie remember

[48:02] when they were 6500 people remember when Toronto Lee was like 58 hundred and it had more in it

[48:11] than most of these modern games remember that remember when there weren't like newbies that bought

[48:21] but like literally only newbie idiots bought Venomeli for 13,000 like series it like if you bought

[48:30] a Venomeli for 13,000 you just like you have a big bullseye dummy dummy on my head

[48:37] yeah I love Avengers layout

[48:50] all right gang what do we want to talk about we how long what time is it all right we got

[48:54] like another I'm really another 20 minutes this has been a fun show by the way thank you for all

[48:58] the support by the way thank you for the stars on Facebook we've got 5,000 stars here we've got

[49:07] wow like a hundred and about $50 on YouTube I think we can you know this is good this is good

[49:14] sad boy is now my new number one patron and you know when you send the dough you'll in the show

[49:23] oh I'm going back into the city tonight meeting with someone special that you'll you'll hear about

[49:35] I'm um I don't know I think we're all feeling a little bit good and here's what I mean by that

[49:48] I think most people right now are just kind of like content with the games they have

[49:53] yeah I was talking to Neo at Pinquess and I always love asking people I'm like dude how many

[49:59] let's ask you guys right now I'm I'm so curious I really I've got 90 people on YouTube I've got

[50:06] 30 people on Facebook this is one of the largest collective audiences I've ever had

[50:14] I would just like each and every one of you to do me a favor because I really am curious

[50:20] in the chat and the comment section type how many pinball machines you currently own

[50:29] I just would love to read out the numbers and I think because I want to pivot from what we get back

[50:38] all right six five

[50:42] 18

[50:44] one

[50:45] four

[50:46] five three

[50:47] 96

[50:48] 13 255

[50:50] three

[50:51] six to seven 15

[50:53] seven over here 48

[50:55] five three 15

[50:57] 105

[50:59] Wayne has 1200 because he's a distributor seven by PJ Thomas is 10

[51:06] Jason has 105 Jason damn

[51:11] Thomas to Jeff to

[51:13] Lou 37 Chad 34 5

[51:16] 0 one digital

[51:19] to Jeff to Brian

[51:22] 34 Orion

[51:24] six Adam 8 Anthony

[51:26] all right

[51:30] six eight

[51:35] zero

[51:39] 23 25

[51:43] nice

[51:45] all right these are good amount Dana said four

[51:49] what I'm seeing here is like kind of what I expected you know most people have

[51:55] you know four to five

[51:58] most people have like between two and two and six

[52:04] is really common then you get the guys 10

[52:07] 10 to 20 right some dudes have like a lot more um

[52:15] so few people said zero

[52:18] and so few people said one which is what I have right now

[52:22] and Greg Colton what's up Greg you have like what like 20 pins

[52:27] but my point is this

[52:30] if you have one pinball machine in your house

[52:35] you have enough pinball in your house

[52:39] and it is I I 100% believe that

[52:43] you get to unlike most homes in the world Greg has 21

[52:48] most people in the world have zero like most like 99.999% of homes have zero

[52:57] when you have one you can always scratch the itch and go play pinball in your house

[53:04] and that's an amazing thing and I think most people right now

[53:08] and you saw that most people had more than one

[53:12] you know most people are good

[53:15] and let me ask you guys that have five to 25 machines

[53:21] I bet those five to 25 machines are all amazing machines

[53:28] I bet most of those five to 25 are in the pinside top 50 games of all time

[53:36] right so you've got this like collection of like really good games

[53:40] and I bet for all of you that have more than five games

[53:44] you most likely have games that complement each other

[53:49] right like you might have some long ball time games or you might have like a Lord the Rings

[53:54] next to a Rick and Morty great great two titles if you only had two titles

[53:59] and you had a Rick and Morty next to a Lord the Rings

[54:02] now obviously I think Rick and Morty kind of shoots like crap

[54:06] I would say to me like a one two a Lord of the Rings next to an Elton John

[54:12] a speed game and a more of a trapping go long ball time game

[54:18] I mean you really can't have more fun in pinball

[54:21] than in Elton John next to a Lord of the Rings

[54:25] you know what I'm saying like you would you would actually have the best of both worlds

[54:28] the Lord of the Rings long ball times lots of fun toys stop and go got all the assets you want

[54:34] such an amazing you know theme integrated pin

[54:39] Elton John music speed energy excitement you know combos awesome game

[54:47] awesome game modern cabinet modern light show if you have those two games

[54:53] you you know what I'm saying like you wouldn't like oh man like I really wish I had like 27 others

[54:58] so that's the thing that's the thing

[55:06] John you know I'm not everybody at John Gallo said like F the pinside yeah like the

[55:10] pinside top 100 is a it's a dumpster fire of of fanboy fanning you know

[55:19] and they they're just that's all it is

[55:21] but I like I think most people are getting to a point now where you know the enthusiasm to run

[55:30] after new inbox is just completely gone like I've never I don't think I've seen new inbox

[55:36] energy so low as it is right now I mean that like it's just like there's no urgency to get Harry

[55:43] Potter right now I mean I'm not saying it's not a great game but like why would you get one right

[55:47] now they're gonna make him forever nobody's buying predator new inbox nobody cares about

[55:52] King Kong new inbox jaws 50th like yeah like cool they're gonna make a ton of them

[55:58] distros are you know why buy it at full price you're gonna be able to get it we've you know it's

[56:02] not like it's like a wow game it's like I don't know you know it's just like new inbox like

[56:07] seeing all these new inbox games like lose so much value makes to me makes new inbox like silly

[56:13] you know and name me another hobby and like that turned into this because this it used to be

[56:21] like when you bought a new inbox game it was more like buying a Rolex like it didn't lose so much

[56:25] value now we're using the car game it's like driving a car off a lot yeah it didn't used to be like

[56:30] that what made pinball so successful and what made this hobby so exciting at every launch was it

[56:37] wasn't like buying a depreciating car it was like buying a Rolex that more people wanted than they

[56:43] made you know what I'm saying now it's the opposite now it's it is that depreciating car where there's

[56:50] way more supply than there is demand and good luck trying to you know get close to what you paid for

[56:57] it back that's a big difference and that's gonna hurt Stern more than anybody

[57:08] well here's what's gonna happen with evil dead if you if you I wouldn't pay over for evil dead

[57:13] even though people are because once beetle juice is announced evil dead will will drop

[57:20] not significantly but they'll drop they'll just be available

[57:26] they'll be available

[57:27] Stern's looks so dated and cheap it's a problem I don't disagree with that you know it's a problem

[57:40] like you know here's the thing about Stern that annoys me you like you you have this beautiful

[57:46] Batman S.O.L.E. foil cabinet decal you can make we don't now get that on a $13,000

[57:55] L.E. it's not nearly as nice even the stuff they put on the L.E.s it's not as nice as that

[58:00] Batman S.O.L.E. want notice flipping out selling lots of almost new games of course

[58:09] you know because like the stupid map pricing it's like Zach has to do that he's got to find the

[58:14] loophole in them in the map pricing BS nobody bought the finance remake nobody

[58:25] the more you have sitting in line the more money you are losing

[58:31] if you buy used you can still get great the the thing about pimples gang too

[58:36] is like come on like these games are a pimple machine is enclosed in a protective

[58:45] big box you know I'm saying these games don't have wear and tear the way cars do

[58:52] even Rolex is scratch up much worse you buy a pimple machine with like 200 plays it looks

[58:58] brand new when it arrives this Guns and Roses is three times cooler than any Stern machine I'm

[59:10] just saying it's it's like this thing is look at this thing I love this thing I mean I have a

[59:22] love hate with it but I love it more than I hate it it's just cool it's just a cool machine

[59:33] my cousin just bought finance L.E. from Zach save thousands because I preach canade his

[01:08:15] five grand cheaper it's the same exact game five grand less like I meant to go into a restaurant

[01:08:27] sir you could have our filet mignon for a hundred dollars

[01:08:35] or you could have it for 50 it's just on a paper plate

[01:08:47] same piece of meat same deliciousness that's all it is that's all the CE is it's the filet

[01:08:57] on a fine piece of china but is it worth it your stomach won't know the difference

[01:09:04] and nor will your brain your brain

[01:09:13] you know it's funny I think I think some of the reason um you know people don't like me

[01:09:21] is they I mean besides my incredibly obnoxious voice and haircut and insecurities

[01:09:29] and how I dress wealthier than I am and how I only have a three bedroom house and you know

[01:09:35] drive an American muscle car that is over-compensating from my lack of endowment um I think the reason

[01:09:42] they hate me is they can't be honest like me and that is what burns the

[01:09:52] oh it's what burns the most painful he can say anything he wants and he just did oh shoot I

[01:10:01] have to say I like this game because I'm friends with those people that sucks because guess what

[01:10:09] I say whatever I want about these companies and I'm still friends with them

[01:10:14] because they respect it because they know that game sucks too you know what I'm saying like when
