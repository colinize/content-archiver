[00:00] Is it the end of the world as we know it?

[00:02] Is the pinball hobby gonna crumble in the midst of the global pandemic happening?

[00:08] Can a woman just sell a game on pinside without being attacked for asking more than the MSRP of the game?

[00:16] Let's talk about that on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:30] So is it the end of the pinball world as we know it?

[00:38] Is this hobby going to collapse right in front of our eyes as we all together in separate places are going through this global pandemic at the same exact time?

[00:49] We'll talk a little bit about that, but then I want to get to the heart of this show, which is an interview with someone who's very unique

[00:57] and I think brings an underrepresented part of this pinball hobby to life.

[01:02] Her name is Julia and I discovered Julia inside a pinside thread and you're gonna hear all about what that thread was about, who she is, and how at first she got vehemently attacked by the pinside mob

[01:16] for just trying to do something very simple that a lot of us do.

[01:21] And I don't think she did anything wrong and I actually love the way the story ended because everyone thought she was lying about who she was and what she was doing.

[01:31] And now all these guys out there are gonna be in for a surprise as they go through the internet now thinking everything is what it seems because as we know it usually isn't but this one was a pleasant surprise for most of you out there.

[01:45] Now look, before we air that interview with Julia, I want you guys all to do me a favor and do the right thing and be safe.

[01:54] Quarantine yourselves if you need to stay inside unless you have to go out.

[01:58] I know there's a lot of people on pinside and there's a lot of morons telling people that this is gonna be over in 10 days.

[02:05] That life is gonna go back to normal in just a few weeks. That's not going to happen.

[02:10] Everybody is dealing with this in separate ways and I just want all of you out there to do the right thing and make sure you don't get arrogantly stupid and go out there and become a carrier of this thing and then put people that you love and jeopardy.

[02:24] I mean that. I mean it. I see those pictures of those idiots down in Florida on the beach during spring break.

[02:32] I think if anything this whole pandemic has made everyone come together and realize that Gen Z is a bunch of freaking morons that no matter what no matter what you tell them they're just gonna do it ever they want and then they want us to pay for their college and they want us to pay their rent and they want to have everything handed to them absolutely moronic behavior.

[02:53] But I'm seeing adults do it too and I'm seeing people on pinside do it too. I'm very fiscally conservative socially liberal but there comes a time when you have to turn off the Fox News people and realize that stop being stupid stop listening to politicians and listen to the medical experts now.

[03:11] What does this mean for pinball is pinball going to collapse and I don't think you can walk away from hearing all of this news and not wondering are these pinball companies screwed are they in trouble what is going to happen what's going to happen to the pinball companies that are launching games right now we saw hot wheels you probably saw Jerry's ice game by P3 multi morphing by the way I interviewed Jerry today that interview is going to go up any day now very cool machine.

[03:40] That machine I think raised a lot of people's expectations of what can be in the P3 platform so really need stuff going on with that game I have to admit but what does it mean can these companies survive stern today delay the release of heavy metal that that didn't get revealed so what does that mean for Ninja Turtles it's quite obvious that getting parts from China is really really difficult now China is starting to send parts again they're actually getting back to normal.

[04:10] But will all these pinball company survive and we're seeing so many games go up for sale over the last few days as people try to raise capital and get some cash flow going now it's no mystery that some people in this hobby have a lot of money other people in this hobby have probably bought too many pinball machines and don't have enough money and savings and if they lose their jobs they could be in jeopardy of meeting their bills and paying for the essentials in life and I think that's the word that keeps.

[04:39] Sticking in a lot of our heads is there's essentials and there's non essentials and at the very bottom of the essentials list is the number one non essential thing and that's pinball it almost feels ridiculous to be thinking about or worrying about the state of the pinball industry and the state of the pinball hobby these are toys that people have enjoyed for many many years.

[05:05] Since 2008 once we climbed out of that recession the economy has been phenomenal people have had a lot of money a lot of excess money people have had good jobs and good fortune a lot of good will has come into people's lives and we've been riding that wave now for a very long time and when you ride that wave and you have that excess money and it's more about it's not even about the money it's just about the mentality that I think the next year is going to be better than the next year.

[05:35] And we've all sort of had that in the way we've planned our lives and our lifestyles that I'm going to make more next year than I did this year that my money is going to grow again next year that my job is going to keep advancing that my ability to put money aside and then buy the thing I want because it's it's it's well within my means and within my grasp and I think what's happened over the last week it's happened in my mind probably in yours is maybe that's not always going to be the case maybe we're not going to be able to do that.

[06:05] We're going to be able to get the things we want because we have to get the things we really need and it's a humongous it's a humongous lifestyle shift for everybody to be hit by this and to start to reprioritize what's important and so pinball is not important and pinball is not necessary and these pinball companies that have all developed over the last few years they were all anticipating that the market would keep growing that pinball would keep growing.

[06:35] They're going to keep expanding that these buyers would keep buying and now now how can you how can you open up your wallet right now and put your money into a pinball machine if you're going to buy anything you would buy stocks but I don't think we've reached the bottom of the stock market although I am so sick of people acting like they're their stock market experts all the sudden right where were these people three weeks ago telling us all to sell because this was going to happen right nowhere to be found now everyone knows it's going to be a lot of money.

[07:05] Exactly what stock to pick but pinball right now is in a state of limbo and it's in a state of uncertainty I do know that one thing is certain it's not going to get back to normal anytime soon and anyone who tells you anything else is not listening to the experts now I will say this in moments like these what we need more than anything is community we need a sense of belonging and we need to treat each other with respect and help each other out and I think you're going to see

[07:34] great great things from humanity over this the next few months everyone is in this together it doesn't matter if you're rich or you're poor you've got a great job a bad job if you're a member of bear naked ladies or your canada you're not going out you're not going to be able to enjoy life the way you want to you're going to be detached from people you love it's can you affect everybody and we're going to need each other now more than ever and as a community and as a member of the community

[08:04] I feel happy that all of us have each other and we're going to have things to talk about and things to discuss there might not be as many new games to discuss I don't think we're going to see as many releases as we thought we were but they will come these companies won't shut off I do expect to see guns and roses from Jersey Jack I do expect to see Ninja turtles I don't know when I don't know when deep route is going to finally show us what they're made of I don't think that it's going to be a big deal of money

[08:33] I don't know but they're going to eventually do it or if they don't they're going to go under there's there's only those two options these companies have to go about eventually releasing what they were planning to or they're going to fold

[08:49] because the last companies that are going to get bailouts and any sympathy or empathy are companies that make such non-essential items like pinball machines and you have to kind of admit it if you really stop and think about it do we really need five six seven eight companies making pinball machines most of which are making mediocre games most of which have been riding high on on this hype train approach to these toys now we really don't

[09:19] I mean my mind the two companies that are best best suited right now to ride out this wave are our stern because they've got cash in the bank and spooky pinball because they've got every game sold over the next 18 months

[09:33] JJP completely at the mercy of their big investor I think he's got the money to see this through but imagine how much money that guy lost if the market's going down the way it's going down but I think JJP will be okay

[09:48] Chicago gaming company I never know what's going on with them ever they're just like always delayed and then P3 multi morphic Jerry's got a fun game but he can't get it to people right now

[09:58] tpf was a big show for him and so that's where we're at deep route I mean deep route it's it's kind of like when are they even going to get on the launch pad when are we going to see something now they're indefinitely delayed and why is it always down to the wire with a company that's had years

[10:15] Robert knows everyone wants to see it but just give us at least something to chew on right now hot wheels a game for operators right now operators are closing doors

[10:25] operators are having to adapt their business model some operators are renting out their machines to customers so they can stay in business

[10:34] so how is a game designed for operators going to do right now who's ordering that game right now right weird times for all of us weird times for all of us but I'm going to be here doing this show hopefully entertaining you guys and giving you guys pinball content

[10:50] so at least when you get tired of the wife or tired of the kids yelling at you and you just want to escape into your man cave and put on canators pinball podcast you can and there will be new episodes so without further ado let's talk to Julia about what she experienced on pinside I think it's a really interesting story I love her enthusiasm for the hobby and I think more and more of us should understand that this hobby does not have any experience

[11:18] that this hobby does have a diverse fan base and it does have a lot of different opinions and perspectives that we should we should bring to light and think about more and more okay so let's air that and the next podcast you're going to hear from Jerry over at p3 all about heist and what went into making that game I had a great talk with Jerry and next Saturday night get ready people were one week away from the twippies all right let's let Julia take you guys a break out of the game

[11:47] let's let Julia take it away so ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome to canators pinball podcast a special guest who has listened to this podcast before so Julia I have one person out there who admits to listening to canators pinball podcast welcome to the show

[12:12] hello how you doing so you're coming from are you in veil right now yes and are you surviving this global pandemic I'm as good as I can be it's definitely a little disturbing are you guys quarantine right now are you self quarantining yes yes I might even have it it's crazy so someone at my job has it I was just talking to Jack danger two of his friends have it I think we're all just going to get it which sucks but yeah

[12:41] we didn't do a good enough job keeping it out and now it's here to stay that's right so so Julie the reason why you're on people might be wondering who's talking to canator so Julia you had a very interesting for sale thread on pinside that I wanted to pick your brain about you are selling a Rick and Morty blood sucker addition what were you listening at four was it 4300 yes okay now was that 4300 dollars over the total

[13:11] price of the game technically no because it also included the deposit which was 1525 dollars okay so my math is not to is that 2800 over then pretty much yeah okay now some change for for for listener of the show how did you even get into pinball and get access to a Rick and Morty machine

[13:35] so totally through my boyfriend like you were saying I used to think your voice was annoying he listened to your podcasts all the time and I'm like who's this guy speaking in the background every second of the day and then once I started listening a little more because he got me more into playing pinball actually I realized you're pretty smart guy and your shell is entertaining you're not the

[14:05] first woman to think I'm annoying I mean there's a much longer list there it's cool I can be annoying to I just yeah for the longest time I just

[14:13] don't understand it really and then I got more involved and we end up going to like the Rocky Mountain pinball showdown and long story short I kicked his ass by entering the amateur competition for fun great so now I'm into it I like it and I'm fine with him listening to you more than often

[14:34] thank you did you did you vote in the twippies no I just I'm realizing what that is finally now thanks to my thread if I lose by one vote I'm going to be upset so all right so he got you into pinball and does he have a collection in the house so what's your what you're at home pinball situation right now yeah we've got a couple we had the monsters sold that a few months back and then got Jurassic Park we also have Deadpool which was a recent buy

[15:04] and pirates of the Caribbean okay Jersey Jack yeah that was actually my choice what's your what's your favorite in that lineup right now right now truthfully it is Deadpool okay all right interesting okay so so let's let's talk about Rick and Morty because you know that when you're where you're going to put up a game for sale at this stage in which they're building maybe 10 a week and people are waiting for them

[15:29] why don't you want it I guess that's the first question I have so it's actually kind of an interesting story with that so when it all got hyped up that that was the new release

[15:39] truthfully my boyfriend was like what the hell's Rick and Morty and I was like did you never get stoned in college and watch all of Rick and Morty like every night with your roommates

[15:48] so then he started binge watching and decided that he had to have the machine and obviously knowing it's a limited release it became super sought after especially by him

[15:58] so really we both he was so worried he wasn't going to get a machine at that point because it was such a limited release I said okay I will also

[16:08] try and buy one and you try and buy one and we'll figure it out and with him the minutes that it went for sale you know just hoping we'd get one to be honest with you

[16:17] where like is it going to be so popular that we're going to end up with nothing or one if we're lucky what happens if we end up with two you know at the time

[16:25] truthfully we didn't really care um we were just like let's go for it and see what happens so we both went for it and we're

[16:32] refreshing our pages like first thing in the morning when everything's available and to be totally honest there is a glitch in the spooky pinball

[16:41] website and we're not the only ones because there was an email sent out but actually when you click to refresh the page because it got stuck

[16:50] we ended up with four machines wow we ended up with two each and within the day spooky sent out an email basically saying if you ended up with two in your

[16:59] cart please don't panic call us let us know and unless you want to keep the two we'll refund you so we gave the two back

[17:08] and at the time I truthfully was thinking I'm like could this be such a great game maybe we want to keep one for later on

[17:17] like as a collectors edition like new in the box we don't really know we're kind of just flying by the seat of our pants

[17:24] yeah and then honestly with the way things have like turned around lately it's kind of like

[17:30] all right I would sell this spot to make a little money right now because there's like 90% unemployment and veil

[17:37] and yeah I mean many other reasons just kind of like all right given the times it's a little crazy

[17:42] right so so this is the machine number two so you're gonna keep one and sell one correct okay

[17:50] so all right so that that helps I think clarify why you're putting one up it wasn't just you only have one

[17:55] machine and it was bought just to flip so there is an economic reason why you want to sort of test the

[18:00] market now I think I found what was really interesting is when you posted on Pinside at first you have

[18:08] a little bit of a thumbnail headshot and people thought you were like catfishing the community did

[18:13] you notice that oh I sure did I was supposedly like a 300 pound man in my basement trying to sell

[18:20] this machine and honestly eventually during this call I would love if you just could validate my

[18:27] existence by switching on the video and you know giving the thumbs up that yes I do exist I am a female

[18:34] human being right I am what my picture is right right well and that was it so was it was a

[18:41] strategic decision let's have your boyfriend sell it or have you sell it was there any bit of a

[18:48] maybe you might soft in the high price below by being an attractive woman parachuting into Pinside

[18:54] which if you've been to Pinside or been to a show you are rarer than a collector's edition

[19:00] probably on that on that site so like was it was that a strategic decision in a way yes but not

[19:07] for the same reason you're saying so truthfully part of it well first of all the one we're selling is

[19:13] the one that was charged to my credit card you know bottom line is he really wanted a machine but yeah

[19:19] truthfully part of it is we were honestly worried about a little bit of kickback by posting it and

[19:26] he's so much more into the pinball community than I am and I rather take the hit to be honest

[19:32] right so that was kind of the strategy was like honestly like let him have the pinball community if

[19:38] they want to shoot on me I can take it right right it's fine and what what's the what's the

[19:48] what's the latest on the game because I just went on Pinside and it was archived have you had any

[19:53] interest do you have anyone online yeah so I actually have a sale pending it's verbally sold

[20:01] but the funds are technically unhauled via PayPal so we're just kind of like waiting to make sure that

[20:07] in the next couple days like it says it will that it goes full truthfully you don't have to disclose

[20:12] the price did you get around what you were looking for for it I kind of met in the middle and

[20:16] that's kind of why I was so shocked I got such crap because I did put on there I'm totally

[20:22] willing to negotiate and I'm open to any offers and I really meant that when I said it so I ended

[20:29] up I ended up meeting at 2050 okay so yeah the profit was about 1300 which is not bad and like I

[20:41] I've I've sold games I've flipped games before with with no with no intention of ever ever putting

[20:49] it in my apartment I sold the ghost busters a Batman LE those are my favorite transactions when

[20:54] you can actually flip it not even have to accept the game and then the distributor just sends it

[21:01] right to the new buyer which is probably what you're gonna do correct is transferred over and

[21:05] completely yeah and to be totally honest I really want to like shout out to spooky because they're

[21:09] like an incredible company and there's a woman who works there named Morgan who's just been like

[21:14] a peach to work with she's so easy they're all super nice and it's just been a really easy

[21:21] transaction like just transferring it over and buying it in the first place and then the refund

[21:26] on the second game like they've been great right what number games did you guys secure I had 267

[21:35] I think my boyfriends is like 30 spots closer than mine okay so like in the early 200s and you

[21:45] so you're looking at and to Summarish for this game to come right now with all I think they're

[21:50] around number 60 right now they're doing about 10 a week yeah I think that sounds right I'm not

[21:55] at this point who knows right I know I my game's number 50 it's it's basically sitting there built

[22:01] and I can't even deliver it now because my building is on a lockdown of all delivery I heard that

[22:08] actually I don't know what we're gonna do people keep acting like it's three to four weeks but all

[22:15] the experts keep saying three to four months before its life is unusual and we really don't know and

[22:21] like you know that's scary at least in my position with my job and or I should say my many jobs

[22:28] right they're all pretty much on hold right now so yeah it's freaky for everyone it's definitely

[22:33] a weird time so you're not the only one I went on Pinside today and I saw a lot of games pop up

[22:39] for sale over the last 48 hours and yeah Julia do you think there's going to be a lot of people

[22:46] out there who are going to try and sell games right now just knowing that if you have to free up

[22:51] some cash now's a good time to sell it's hard to say I mean it really is such a gamble and to be

[23:00] totally honest with you with my transaction I was really surprised the guy is very eager to buy it

[23:05] and then I'm not going to disclose who he is but via the pinball loop I had with spooky in transferring

[23:14] over the position he ended the conversation by telling the woman hey if anyone else is going to bail

[23:21] I'd like to buy one or two more units so it looks like he's speculating on the Rick and Morty

[23:29] market to try and for sure get in and nothing against him like he paid you know what we agreed on

[23:35] and he was super easy to work with so no issues there but I just I find that pretty interesting and

[23:42] also his name was a little interesting also which I could disclose later but I don't feel comfortable

[23:49] doing that right on the podcast and and so you did PayPal well yeah I mean I will keep

[23:55] him anonymous for now yeah nothing that we discussed on the show is ever anonymous and I have a

[24:01] tendency to out all the information that I get without care so I'll keep that to myself for now okay

[24:08] and so when you did PayPal did you guys do the not the friends and family sounds like you did the

[24:13] PayPal that you could actually okay which is smarter because yeah I I've done deals before with

[24:20] friends and family you get burned because you have no protection and I know you pay a little bit

[24:25] of a fee but there's a reason for that you have some sort of security that if the deal doesn't

[24:29] work out so spooky was really cool with you transferring over no issues there no not at all they were

[24:35] just like loop us on the email and basically once you confirm with us that you've received payment

[24:41] or this person's good to go you know we don't do anything until you let us know and he was able to

[24:47] ask questions to to verify that I wasn't in this camera also right so that was helpful um but yeah it

[24:54] is it was a real purchase and did it exist right and I exist so here we are as I was watching the

[25:02] thread and I was watching you posted a link to Instagram and I'm like all right like I'm like

[25:07] damn it now all these guys are gonna fall for a million catfish scams after this because they're

[25:12] gonna be like actually it's real like all these Russian women who want to friend me on Facebook are

[25:18] really those people so I think you might have you know hurt these guys as they move through social

[25:24] media um so what do you think about the overall sort of negative because I think you got something

[25:31] like over 40 down votes and it was just like this anger that would be surprised by the vitriol

[25:36] that you got for just trying to sell something that is yours for sure just because I mean my

[25:42] mentality was like if you don't want it that's fine you don't have to say anything move along but I

[25:47] didn't understand was there is all these other posts asking for you know a little less if it was

[25:52] a worser spot or a ridiculous amount of money and then here I'm like why is my thread right

[26:01] getting variety at this point like how come no one else is dealing with this so it was really

[26:06] interesting to me because I'm like I don't feel like I'm doing anything different than some of the

[26:10] other people are doing I do understand the mentality of like being angry that I possibly took away

[26:16] this spot from someone else is it the fact of the matter was like I got to the computer in time

[26:20] I bought it in time that wasn't the initial intention like we really were hoping hey let's at least

[26:26] get one I mean it was like black Friday right so I think spooky is going to figure out a different

[26:34] system right and I think what Charlie they they they're not set up for this kind of demand on a

[26:40] game yet right with their system and I think what happened is within four hours all of them sold

[26:45] but right when sales started and everyone was coming through the door at once it was hard if

[26:51] people people's computers were freezing people were oh yeah people didn't realize you could call up

[26:55] I mean I'm still getting hate mail because I've number 50 and everyone's like wait a minute like

[27:00] can it has been bagging on this company he hasn't bought any spooky game ever and he gets number 50

[27:06] my response to those people that's what you get when you win best pinball podcast two years

[27:11] in a row you get to cut the line no but I think they realize that so many people were trying to get

[27:16] it and people thought it was unfair but ultimately if I was a business owner and this is where I think

[27:21] pin-side people just need to wake up to the reality if I'm a business owner I just want I just

[27:25] want to get sales right I want I don't care who buys it I don't care what they flip it for

[27:29] I just want to make sure I sell out of my product and get the games to the people who want them

[27:35] and if people want more than one it's still America it's still fair and they can do what they want

[27:40] and I always say this when you flip a game as long as the seller and the buyer are happy who cares

[27:46] what what the angry mob on the side thinks of the sale yeah for sure and I mean it's helping spooky

[27:52] I mean I'm happy for them when I called to get my refund on that second game you know the lady's

[27:58] like we broke records today I mean we sold out so fast and they were just so excited and I just

[28:03] think that's really cool and I bet it is so exciting for them to see their game sell for more

[28:09] than the even sold it for it it shows that it's a compliment absolutely it shows that there's more

[28:14] demand uh you know versus other titles and games that come out where you give it a week or two

[28:20] weeks later and they're already going at a discount from distributors so Julia why I have you I

[28:25] I just want to pick your brain because we don't get that many female guests on the show and I know

[28:30] that if you've been following the hobby have you picked up on a lot of the conversation of how

[28:35] this hobby is is male dominated and and how do you feel as a woman in pinball do you feel that

[28:41] at times do you feel like people are insensitive to that or you just enjoy it and don't care um

[28:47] a little bit of both I definitely enjoy it and don't care for the most part it really was just this

[28:53] thread that kind of got to me otherwise like going to the pinball show in Denver and just playing

[28:59] in general I've met a lot of cool people who are like yeah we should play with my girlfriend and

[29:04] I don't think it's I haven't seen that it's like super male dominated until pinside to be honest

[29:11] but that's a woman too do you do you think pinside is a very inviting environment it or do you think it's

[29:20] no to put it bluntly not at all right I just I feel like these people are really just bored and

[29:26] hanging up behind the screen and feel like they don't think before a lot of the things they say

[29:31] they're telling me I don't say anything on there and they don't comment I never posted anything

[29:35] it's like so I'm not allowed to be a part of this unless I say something like yeah I don't know

[29:43] it's monitored very differently to play devil's advocate I think you know to go back to your

[29:48] post about this sale you have a new poster with a a model-esque headshot of a woman

[29:55] who's selling a rickid board for $4,300 almost I'm like can you blame them that they were like a

[30:02] little bit skeptical and and coming at you with arrows but I think you shall shock them with

[30:08] with the the links and what what we'll do is this when we put up this podcast we'll do this Julia

[30:13] take a photo of just holding up a piece of paper that says canada yeah in front of you and I

[30:19] think that will be the ultimate proof that you're real all right awesome and that's how we'll

[30:24] validate it but in terms of the toxicity of the community it it does feel like a boys club and

[30:31] does that bother you or do you it's like just that's just guys being guys mean what's your your

[30:36] point of view on that um I don't know it does bother me a little bit because there's a way

[30:43] I don't know to present yourself in certain things you should and could say and things you definitely

[30:47] shouldn't and I think that there is that camaraderie of like the stereotype of guys playing more

[30:55] video games and arcade games and things and that it's not really a girls hobby right or like we

[31:01] don't understand like there's definitely like t-shirts that say certain things that are definitely

[31:06] male oriented and you know things about balls and all of that good stuff so yeah it's a little annoying

[31:16] yeah yep have you when you think about the games themselves do you do you wish there were different

[31:23] themes what kinds of themes are you into I mean the themes are obviously they're going after the

[31:29] larger consumer base I work in marketing and and and in all fairness advice sad and

[31:34] are you do work in marketing as well yes awesome what what kind of marketing do you do uh mostly for

[31:40] like local stores around the Vale Valley so I kind of partner with them and try and help them out

[31:45] I do a lot of well like you said model ask photo I do modeling I do the photos I do at my major

[31:52] is journalism so I do a lot of the writing and I basically just try and help in any area the

[31:57] company needs it to promote their business it sounds like public relations would be good for you too

[32:01] that's I majored in comms and and now I'm pitch and Oreo cookies all day long so but when it comes

[32:08] to marketing those as I was thinking about themes it if you're sitting down in your pinball company

[32:13] and you're picking themes I mean the majority of the audience who buy these games are most likely

[32:19] men 40 to 60 not a very diverse background buyer base do you wish there was different types of

[32:27] themes that people explored for pinball machines that would open up to a broader audience you know

[32:32] that'd be cool but I do I mean I feel like there's such a variety out there as far as like you know

[32:37] I see things like Willy Wonka Wizard of Oz being like family games they're not super like manly

[32:43] but yeah it's interesting that there's like playboy and you know girls with big boobs

[32:49] out by right and then there's like nothing really yeah there's nothing there's no magic mic pinball

[32:55] machine not that I want one but I do also understand that you know these are these machines are

[33:00] expensive to make and they're expensive to buy and maybe there really isn't the market for that out

[33:05] there right and like I'm cool with that I'm totally cool with that I grew up with brothers I can

[33:11] get down with all the comics and things and gore but yeah I do think that that that there isn't

[33:20] really too much out there for women is there a is there a theme or a movie you would love to see

[33:26] get the pinball treatment oh gosh that's tough because honestly I think I was so excited about

[33:32] Rick and Morty because I really did just binge watch it all the time that I don't know right now

[33:38] that's just where my mind's at so I'm excited that my boyfriend will at least have his and I can

[33:42] play that that's when I really have to think about what I think what I think it's it just goes to

[33:46] show the the great selection Rick and Morty was right for spooky is they picked that theme and it

[33:52] it is a broad appeal and a lot of people a lot of younger people too are very into that theme

[33:58] but if you're older I think a lot of the older dudes didn't hear of Rick and Morty but then they

[34:02] watched it and realized why it's so popular well that's exactly what happened here you know I

[34:10] explained I used to watch this all the time you know you pretty much had to be stoned out of your

[34:13] mind to super enjoy it and then my boyfriend just started watching it during breakfast and was like

[34:20] this is great yeah like then he bends watched it so yeah that's how we ended up going for it honestly

[34:27] my wife Brenda we we love it and I had not seen it before I mean I ordered the game and I was like

[34:32] I kind of ordered the game before even watching it and it's it's weird when you watch a show knowing

[34:38] that you have an eight or nine thousand dollar pinball machine coming because you're watching it hoping

[34:43] it clicks with you because you've already it bought the machine and luckily it did and then I

[34:49] can't wait to play it and I've played it and it's it's it's it's definitely worth the wait so Julia

[34:53] are you going to be a more active member on Pinside now and and keep the mob off your back by being

[35:00] a part of the community or you kind of like gonna step back a little bit you know probably step

[35:06] back until there's something I feel intrigued with any creepy people like flooding your PM and

[35:12] inboxes no not at all actually I'm really I'm really happy with that I haven't really had that

[35:18] it was just more so all out there for people to see and like the guy he said something about

[35:24] the lavish vacations I go on in things and I'm like you know nothing about me right I go on those

[35:31] vacations because I do model and they're paid trips to model clothing and regardless it's like have

[35:38] you never gone on a vacation before doubt it isn't it's an interesting phenomenon of the modern world

[35:47] is people will look at your photos online and just make a broad observation of your life

[35:53] yeah and like just because I post the positive things doesn't mean that you know my life's not a

[35:58] total shitshow yeah no nobody but because no one's honest on social media they they just post it when

[36:05] when the meal looks right when they're out looking good when yeah they you know they get that

[36:09] job promotion or that new car or they're on vacation but no one's like just another Tuesday and

[36:13] my wife's annoying me today and like this sucks like hey we present the best sides of our

[36:20] our lives and everyone you know for for likes and clicks and comments it's it's I know there's no

[36:25] real real window into people's lives on on social media at all no it's not real connection at all

[36:30] you know it is real canate is pinball podcast yes the number one pinball podcast in the world

[36:36] well Julie I want to thank you for taking the time I'm actually about to to talk to

[36:40] Jerry at p3 multi morphing did you see his new game today his no oh check it out so he's got

[36:46] it's called the heist and it's what do you think do you see hot wheels yes what do you think

[36:52] um I do think it's cool like hot wheels is definitely a theme that I think is a good pinball

[36:57] machine as far as like the structure of what it already is like loops and speed and things but

[37:03] truthfully kind of lame so I'm not I'm not like being unfair when I and when I say the game

[37:09] isn't really all that no no my boyfriend and I had this conversation too I was just kind of like

[37:15] want what what's like what kills me like everyone says the same thing about it it looks colorful like

[37:21] like they were expecting a black and white version of hot wheels oh okay well the but it's like

[37:26] weird like it looks colorful and then everyone always says it looks fun to shoot like it's a pinball

[37:30] machine that's like that's like it's like walking up to a car and being like it looks like it drives

[37:35] like that's not enough to sell a game exactly exactly like it's cool the idea was already great

[37:42] for pinball like I said because the loops and you know just the mechanics of things but just the theme

[37:48] in general it's like what six-year-old guys and to be like yeah hot wheels machines bad ass

[37:56] it's like not really well and then the the immigration is the show for kids like four to eight

[38:04] yeah and that's kind of how I see it like my boyfriend's son would love it but would we spend

[38:09] money on it no probably not I mean definitely not well right and so that's just like it's a weird

[38:16] theme and I work for Mattel and hop and I work on hot wheels for them too and it's it's one of those

[38:21] things where I get the popularity of the theme but will it translate over into people who actually

[38:27] buy the machines and that's a you got to get that part of the marketing equation right because if you

[38:32] guess wrong and someone said this like you can make a Justin Bieber pinball machine you could I

[38:37] mean he sells millions of albums but does that yeah wait to those millions of fans wanting a pinball

[38:44] version so we'll see and what because ultimately right in marketing sales don't lie so it doesn't

[38:49] matter what can you think or what you think it's will the buyers line up to buy it and Rick and

[38:54] Morty sells out in four hours they did something right and hot wheels are open I there's no way they've

[39:01] sold even 70 by now yeah that's interesting and so and it's the worst time ever to sell a game to

[39:07] operators because the whole country shutting down right exactly I just really want to see the

[39:13] Ninja Turtles yeah so I've heard yeah I've heard big things about it and so today we were supposed

[39:19] to see heavy metal from Stern but they've hit pause on all reveals and I don't know when we're

[39:25] going to see turtles now because of of the coronavirus I think they're going to wait well because right

[39:31] now I bet Stern struggling with parts from China nothing's coming over right now I bet they're

[39:36] struggling with 400 people working in the Stern factory is that safe to I mean general motors shut

[39:41] down Stern pinball still going you know it's like right right so I think there's going to be a

[39:46] delay with manufacturing and I don't know if we're going to see it which is going to make

[39:52] podcasting about pinball really hard over the next few weeks because there's nothing now are you

[39:56] going to watch the Twippies next Saturday night I mean I would love to yes I didn't even know

[40:01] when they were so yeah I'll plan on that for sure so next Saturday night the 27th we will the

[40:07] Twippies is going on it's going to be online so you can watch it from anywhere and best pinball

[40:11] podcasts Julia without your vote we're going to try and win a win a third but thank you so much

[40:17] for coming on and I'd love to have you come back on when there's I'd love to get like a female's

[40:22] point of view on new games and new reveals and just get what your thoughts are because I think

[40:27] you bring a different perspective than a lot of the people that I talked to on a daily basis how's

[40:31] that sound be awesome I'd love to all right and we'll get that photo up people so if you're thinking

[40:36] Julia is catfishing you and she's really a 300 pound man who loves hot wheels you're going to

[40:42] think again all right well thanks so much it's been a pleasure all right we'll talk soon yes have a great day
