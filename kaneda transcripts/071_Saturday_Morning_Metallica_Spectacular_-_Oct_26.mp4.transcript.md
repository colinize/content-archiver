[01:28] All right, all right, here we go.

[01:55] Thank you.

[01:58] Ah, good morning everybody.

[02:00] How's everybody doing?

[02:02] We're on YouTube, we're on Facebook,

[02:05] and we're just gonna have a fun.

[02:07] Like 90 minute chat about pinball,

[02:10] but you know why if you're here today, 47 people,

[02:14] 47 reasons why everyone's excited about this metallic

[02:18] a giveaway.

[02:19] I'm excited to get someone in Metallica

[02:21] for basically MSRP, 13 grant.

[02:24] All right, I know I worded it,

[02:25] like I was giving someone a Metallica,

[02:27] but this is your best bet to get one.

[02:29] Everybody knows it, everybody knows it.

[02:31] Let me open up a Dacity right now.

[02:33] And like we got three things going.

[02:35] This is amazing.

[02:36] Cory's, I got people on Facebook,

[02:38] I got people on YouTube,

[02:40] and I've got the best community in all the pinball,

[02:43] just trying to do something good for the audience

[02:45] and for the community.

[02:47] It's interesting, you know, no good deed goes unpunished.

[02:50] It's amazing to me how even after doing this,

[02:54] people are like, oh, you're just doing a marketing stunt.

[02:56] Yeah, okay, cool.

[02:57] Marketing stunt for what?

[02:58] For another five bucks a month,

[03:00] from like four people that joined the show

[03:01] since I announced this giveaway of a spot.

[03:04] It's not a giveaway of a game.

[03:05] It's a giveaway of a spot at MSRP.

[03:08] All right, let's do this.

[03:10] Stop.

[03:12] So welcome everybody to the Canadian Saturday morning,

[03:16] Metallica Spectacular, one lucky club member

[03:20] who is a member of the Canadian club

[03:22] is gonna get a chance to buy

[03:24] a Metallica LE remastered for MSRP.

[03:29] The rules are very simple.

[03:31] You have to have been a Canadian club member before entering.

[03:35] You have to give me your name and phone number

[03:37] and then you have to pick up your phone

[03:39] when we pull your name out of a hat.

[03:41] I'm looking at right now a list of names.

[03:44] I've got something like 47 names here.

[03:47] I'm not gonna show you the numbers

[03:48] so you can start prank calling my club members.

[03:51] But it's gonna be a fun day.

[03:54] Thank you Brian Cosas here, Lord Olaf.

[03:56] I mean, we got people from all over the world.

[03:58] We've got some people on Facebook.

[04:00] We've got some people on YouTube.

[04:02] We're doing it both ways.

[04:04] I wanted to open this up to everybody.

[04:06] So this show today is a special show

[04:08] because it's not behind any paywall.

[04:12] I want everybody to see this goodwill gesture.

[04:15] I think it's good.

[04:16] I heard your feedback when I went to go flip this game

[04:19] for a profit just to see where the market was.

[04:22] People lost their mind.

[04:23] They absolutely lost their mind.

[04:25] They're like, you're not allowed to,

[04:26] Canada, make a few bucks on a scalp of a game.

[04:30] I get it.

[04:31] I get it.

[04:32] Everyone was happy to see me lose like $2,000 on toy story

[04:36] at $1,000 on Ultraman.

[04:38] For those of us in the pinball space,

[04:40] speculating on games and their value

[04:44] is a age old tradition.

[04:46] I don't know what the big deal is.

[04:48] What's the big deal?

[04:48] Like if I buy Netflix stock at 200

[04:51] and it goes up to 400 or 500 or 600,

[04:54] do I have to sell it to you at 200?

[04:56] Yeah, I guess you do in the pinball world,

[04:58] but I do understand that with this audience

[05:02] and with my voice in this hobby,

[05:04] I do have a responsibility to set an example.

[05:08] And I think everyone is kind of over

[05:10] sort of like the world of scalping and flipping

[05:13] and making money that way.

[05:15] Sort of taking the game from someone

[05:18] who's a fan who really wants it.

[05:20] So I heard that.

[05:22] I heard that loud and clear.

[05:24] Now, if you're on Facebook,

[05:25] you can come over to the YouTube channel.

[05:27] It is also public.

[05:30] Let me post it in the page two

[05:33] so people know they can go there.

[05:35] Let me just go on Facebook right now

[05:38] and let everybody know we're also on YouTube.

[05:42] And we're gonna have some fun today.

[05:43] We're gonna also talk about what's going on in the hobby

[05:45] because we're not doing the drawing

[05:47] until 11 o'clock.

[05:50] So I am hopefully killing and will be back

[05:53] from the supermarket because I would love for him

[05:56] to be the one who pulls the name out of the hat.

[05:59] So that's gonna be a lot of fun.

[06:02] We're also on YouTube.

[06:04] Yay.

[06:07] Let's post that.

[06:09] And we might have a surprise guest join the show today.

[06:12] We'll see what happens.

[06:14] Yeah, so thanks, Wood.

[06:15] I what I shared about back to the future.

[06:17] We're gonna talk about that.

[06:19] We're gonna talk about everything going on in Pimbal.

[06:21] It's what we do on Canadian Pimbal podcast.

[06:24] Super happy to spend that time at Expo and meet people

[06:29] and hear rumors and sort of get ready

[06:31] for the next wave of games in Pimbal.

[06:35] And I think everyone is sort of feeling that right now.

[06:38] Like we're kind of in that little bit of a limbo period.

[06:42] Avatar hasn't really caught on.

[06:44] People are not loving the game

[06:46] and ordering it left and right.

[06:49] Unless your name's Joe Abadi,

[06:50] you're not going to bat for Avatar.

[06:52] As you know, I think the game just needs

[06:54] to wake up in the software department.

[06:57] I think Keith Johnson has coded a game that has a lot,

[07:01] I think in it, but I don't think it has a lot of feels

[07:06] and a lot of emotion and a lot of energy

[07:09] and a lot of excitement.

[07:10] And I think the challenge with Avatar now,

[07:13] you know, when you start making all those inserts,

[07:15] sort of like the Navi language,

[07:17] like nobody knows what you're talking about, right?

[07:19] Nobody knows.

[07:19] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, multiple.

[07:21] You know, it's like all these weird names

[07:23] and we just don't click with the vernacular of Avatar.

[07:28] The way we do with Star Wars, right?

[07:29] If I'm like, I'm doing beggars run or Millennium Falcon,

[07:33] you know, we're going to sort of Dagobah, right?

[07:35] You like those things matter.

[07:37] I don't even think like the Hallelujah Mountains,

[07:40] like make anybody feel anything.

[07:42] And I also think the game just didn't put mechanical

[07:47] wow in it at all.

[07:49] I think the lower play fields are underwhelming.

[07:54] I think that there should have been more

[07:57] of an upper play field, Hallelujah Mountains, sort of.

[08:01] I think they should have done something similar

[08:03] to the Star Wars hyperdrive, right?

[08:08] Like they should have had something where it felt like

[08:10] you were getting on a banshee and you were flying

[08:13] around Pandora.

[08:15] And so much of the game is just like not, right?

[08:18] Translating that.

[08:19] So look, the consumers are speaking.

[08:20] It's not just Canada.

[08:22] I think a lot of people out there are realizing too

[08:25] that, you know, those $15,000 CE's of Avatar

[08:28] are going to be closer to $10,000,

[08:32] especially as we go into the spring of next year

[08:35] and Harry Potter is coming out.

[08:37] So I keep telling everybody, look, if you like Avatar,

[08:40] just wait.

[08:41] They're going to make 1,000 of those CE's

[08:44] and you're going to be able to pick one up

[08:46] at a wholesale price.

[08:48] And why wouldn't you just, if you really want

[08:50] an Avatar CE, why wouldn't you just wait

[08:52] and save like $3,000 to $5,000?

[08:54] Now, a Tale of Two Games because the one game

[08:58] that's going in the opposite direction is Metallica Ellie.

[09:03] This game is probably the best Stern launch since Godzilla.

[09:11] I think the demand for Metallica, Remastered Ellie,

[09:15] is actually greater than the demand was for Godzilla.

[09:20] I think only making 500 was a very smart move

[09:24] by Stern Pimbal.

[09:26] In just one move, they've restored sort of the FOMO

[09:31] and the frenzy and the excitement around in Ellie.

[09:35] And they really needed to do that.

[09:38] We hadn't felt that with John Wick.

[09:40] We didn't feel it with Venom.

[09:42] Jos was like, all right, but not really hard.

[09:45] It was not hard to get a Jos Ellie.

[09:47] Now I'm seeing Jos Ellie's, you know,

[09:50] Cell for 12, 11, 5, I get their losing value.

[09:54] They're just no way around it.

[09:56] They're losing value.

[09:57] But Metallica Ellie, I don't think it's ever

[09:59] going to sell for less than 13.

[10:02] I've had offers north of 17,000 for the game

[10:05] I'm about to give someone here for 13.

[10:08] You know, it's interesting.

[10:09] I just want to just say this for the record.

[10:11] I literally left $5,000 on the table with this game.

[10:18] Okay, I charge people $5 a month to do a podcast.

[10:22] Okay, so and when you sell a game like this,

[10:25] like you're not declaring these things on your taxes

[10:27] when you do a scout, right?

[10:29] So legitimately, one sale of a Metallica Ellie for me

[10:34] is equivalent to all the hard work I do over two months, right?

[10:39] Because I have to pay the government

[10:41] with my taxes on Patreon.

[10:43] Two months worth of work I could have made up

[10:46] in one flip of Metallica and everybody got mad.

[10:50] So I just like, I just want to say,

[10:54] I'm doing the right thing.

[10:56] You know, it's not lost on me how much,

[11:01] you know, how much money, you know, dealers and distributors

[11:05] can make you come on.

[11:06] You know there's dealers out there, gang,

[11:08] who are holding some of these back.

[11:10] And in a month or two, oh look what I got,

[11:13] new inbox, Metallica Ellie, $19,000.

[11:16] That's what's gonna happen.

[11:18] Look, and Stern can't stop it.

[11:19] It's a market adjusted price.

[11:22] And I would say the market price on this game

[11:24] is north of $17,000 right now.

[11:27] And look, I think it's a good thing

[11:29] because I think most people who buy it aren't gonna sell it.

[11:32] I think most people who buy this game are big fans.

[11:35] They were fans of the original.

[11:37] I think the value of the originals is gonna go down for sure.

[11:42] And as I told my friends at Stern Pimble,

[11:44] I think next time they do this, the smart new would have been

[11:48] to try to identify diehard Metallica fans

[11:52] who bought the original one and still own it after 12 years.

[11:57] Those people should have had first dibs at the new game.

[12:02] I think a lot of them sort of waited on the sideline

[12:05] and pretended their dirty, donny version is nicer.

[12:08] It's not.

[12:10] And now it's too late for a lot of them.

[12:12] I think they all should have listened to Canada

[12:14] and just got their name on a list.

[12:16] Look, if you got one and you just listen to me,

[12:20] I just handed you $5,000.

[12:23] I legitimately, there's no other way to cut this.

[12:27] I just handed you a $5,000 stock tip

[12:31] that you could exercise all day long.

[12:35] So you're welcome.

[12:36] And I think people got confused about my wait and see sort

[12:39] of approach to Pimble.

[12:41] Yeah, wait and see on almost everything.

[12:43] I always say this on almost everything.

[12:47] But don't wait and see on a super hot game like this

[12:50] because you're gonna get locked out,

[12:52] you're gonna regret it.

[12:53] And the only way you're gonna be able to get one

[12:55] is if you spend more money and that's where we're at right now

[13:00] with Metallica Ellie.

[13:02] I think the game is great.

[13:03] I think it's beautiful.

[13:04] I also think people need to realize

[13:06] that Spike 3 is coming.

[13:08] So when Spike 3 comes and Spike 3 enhances,

[13:14] what a Stern experience is, better sound, better lights,

[13:17] better screen, better everything.

[13:20] Better internet connectivity.

[13:21] Everything's gonna be better.

[13:23] I think that's gonna knock Metallica down a little bit, right?

[13:26] I think people are gonna have hoped

[13:28] it would have been the first Spike 3 game.

[13:30] It was planned to be the first Spike 3 game,

[13:33] but they didn't have it ready in time.

[13:36] I still think Spike 3, King Kong, Keith L. Winner

[13:39] is what's gonna happen.

[13:41] And Brian Eddie's Dungeons and Dragons will be next.

[13:45] We talked on my show this week about back to the future

[13:49] and how a Dutch pinball would have in a herculean task

[13:54] to fulfill the demand for the orders they would get

[14:00] for back to the future.

[14:02] Yes, Dutch has been talking to Stern to Jersey Jack.

[14:07] They've been seen in the building.

[14:10] And you know me, I think Stern should make the game.

[14:13] I think Barry would be a hero

[14:15] and I think that's the right thing to do.

[14:18] I don't think Jersey Jack would make a better back

[14:21] to the future than Stern.

[14:23] And if Stern had one of their amazing designers

[14:27] like Danger or Ellen Do it,

[14:29] I think a modern day classic would be born.

[14:33] If Jersey Jack did it, I just don't know.

[14:37] Like a maybe Steve Richie would be the one to go with,

[14:40] but I'm not sure, even with Steve,

[14:43] you know, Elton John is kind of a recycled idea

[14:47] of older games.

[14:49] I, you know, we haven't seen Steve really wow us

[14:52] in a really long time.

[14:54] He played a safe bet with Elton.

[14:56] It's a bet that worked.

[14:57] It's a great game.

[14:58] It shoots, it's the best shooting Jersey Jack game of all time.

[15:02] But it's just the way it goes.

[15:04] You know, I want to see Steve,

[15:06] you know, sort of like do something along the lines

[15:09] of ACDC again, or you know, something along the lines.

[15:14] I'm trying to think of like the last Richie game

[15:16] and I was like, wow, you know, I just think Ellen's so good.

[15:20] I think Danger is just so good.

[15:23] So someone says, JJP actually puts the money in though.

[15:26] I think JJP will surprise us with a killer mech

[15:29] with Harry Potter and back to the future.

[15:31] Well, I don't know, man, I don't know.

[15:34] It's yet to be seen.

[15:35] What's the killer mech in Toy Story?

[15:38] What's the killer mech in the Godfather?

[15:41] What's the killer mech in Elton John?

[15:43] What's the killer mech in Avatar?

[15:46] You could even argue what's the killer mech in Guns and Roses.

[15:48] I don't think Jersey Jack has made a killer mech

[15:51] since Pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:53] That's six years ago gang.

[15:55] That's five games ago.

[15:57] And so I just don't see it.

[15:59] Like I just don't see Jersey Jack engineering

[16:03] these killer mech games.

[16:06] And I've lost faith that they will do that.

[16:10] I mean, if Fumihwan's Fumih twice, Fumih 3, 4, 5 times now.

[16:15] And it is a little confusing to me

[16:17] with the amount of money and the amount of resources they have

[16:21] that Jersey Jack is in, running circles around everybody else

[16:25] when it comes to mechs, when it comes to like exciting things.

[16:29] So that's where we're at.

[16:32] I'm going to move my face, my camera over here.

[16:34] Let's get everything in one shot.

[16:37] How's that?

[16:37] That looks better.

[16:38] Because I got the sun coming in.

[16:40] I'm going to go up to the side just a little bit.

[16:43] There we go.

[16:44] Everything's good.

[16:44] We got Neo Geo.

[16:45] We got Pulsar going on the Neo Geo SC 14.

[16:50] We're going to go like this.

[16:52] So you can see a little bit more Neo.

[16:54] I love my setup.

[16:56] I'm on my living room table.

[16:58] And I've got the names people.

[17:00] The names you're like, Knai to shut up.

[17:02] Like let's get to this drawing.

[17:04] You're going to get your name put in a hat.

[17:07] We've got my Knai to hat.

[17:10] And let's read out the names.

[17:13] I got to cut these suckers up because I didn't do that yet.

[17:17] So I want to do this real quick and wish everybody a good luck on this.

[17:22] Well, let's do this in 10 minutes.

[17:23] I'll do this in 10 minutes because we've got 40 minutes to go before we do the drawing.

[17:29] I hear my take on everything happening in pinball.

[17:32] Prices are still sky high.

[17:35] They're really high.

[17:37] Jersey Jack Harry Potter is going to be the moment in which

[17:43] they either nail it or I kind of feel like it's a nail and a coffin for these guys because

[17:50] like, and I think the requirements to do Harry Potter right are going to come down to the

[17:57] assets and how they translate Harry Potter into pinball.

[18:02] And I think what people are worried about does it have the movie assets?

[18:06] And if it does and they don't sync up the clips with the film scenes, I'm done.

[18:12] I said it.

[18:13] I'm not buying another Jersey Jack machine where the voices and the sound effects are not

[18:19] synced up with the clips.

[18:22] I just won't do it.

[18:24] You know, it's like a little bit of Godfather has it, but not a lot.

[18:27] Willie Wonka doesn't have it.

[18:28] The Guns and Roses has it.

[18:30] Guns and Roses to me will I think there's like, there's a reason why Guns and Roses sold

[18:34] like five, six thousand units.

[18:36] It's kind of perfect.

[18:38] Say what you will about the layout.

[18:39] I get it.

[18:40] It's a little bit more of a stop and go game.

[18:42] It doesn't have the flow of a stern.

[18:45] But when you really understand GNR and you understand like how to set up the game right

[18:52] and how to achieve things.

[18:54] So when you start a song, you've got everything ready to go.

[18:58] You collect the band members.

[19:00] You get to band frenzy.

[19:02] You get to encore.

[19:04] You know, there's always a great moment in Guns and Roses whenever you play it where

[19:08] you're trying to get to the applause jackpot, right?

[19:11] It's very similar to the eclipse jackpot in Avatar.

[19:15] You build it all up during the song and then you got to hit that shot as the song is ending

[19:20] and it's awesome.

[19:21] And if you hit it, you go to encore and then you play another song from that album and

[19:27] the crowd's cheering and the lights are going for it.

[19:29] It's a great, it's a great moment.

[19:30] I mean, I love, love, love, love playing my Guns and Roses.

[19:34] I'm never selling it.

[19:36] Yeah, I get it.

[19:37] The market is sort of falling out from underneath it simply because they need too many.

[19:42] I think Jersey Jack overproduced the game for sure.

[19:46] Harry Potter, I know, is a monster theme, but as a holder fantasy nerd, it doesn't hit

[19:53] for me.

[19:54] The thing about Potter is this.

[19:56] Like, let's be honest, people.

[19:58] Like, how many adults are age?

[20:01] Are we really the Potter demographic?

[20:04] I'm not.

[20:05] I didn't read the books.

[20:07] I saw all the movies, but like Potter to me was like movies that I saw and I didn't need

[20:13] to see them again.

[20:14] Like I saw everyone.

[20:16] I saw everyone in the theater and they were enjoyable.

[20:20] I was entertained.

[20:21] I thought the actors were great.

[20:23] I thought they brought that world to life in such a good way, but it doesn't stick with

[20:28] me culturally.

[20:31] The way Han Solo does or Luke Skywalker or Optimus Prime or Galvatron and Megatron, you

[20:39] know, it just doesn't.

[20:40] I just he-man.

[20:42] Like I just, I don't know.

[20:44] When I think about things that the moment I see them or hear them, it awakens something

[20:50] in me.

[20:51] And look, I'm not saying that some people, yeah, they're all in on Potter.

[20:56] I just don't know if the 40 to 60 year old demographic is as into it as people think.

[21:05] So we shall see, you know, like I'm more into goonies and back to the future.

[21:10] I'm more into a Kobra Kai karate kid.

[21:14] I'm more into die hard, total recall.

[21:17] Give me a Vondom game.

[21:19] Give me big trouble in little China.

[21:21] Give me Fifth Element.

[21:22] Give me Matrix.

[21:23] Like, you know, these are the things that like, all right.

[21:25] They have much more, just much more connection with me.

[21:29] I mean, from what I can tell Harry Potter, like, Val the Mort, like it's just this long

[21:35] drawn out narrative or him versus evil, how he got the scar on his head.

[21:41] And it's cute.

[21:43] It's campy.

[21:44] It's fun.

[21:45] It's good.

[21:46] But I'm just not sure that people are gonna, you know, I don't know.

[21:52] I don't know.

[21:53] I really don't know.

[21:54] I mean, I'm not sure if you're gonna watch movies.

[21:55] It feels like a, again, a Herculean task to take all those like eight or nine movies

[22:01] and make it a Pimbal Machine.

[22:02] I mean, Keith already just makes one or two movies into a ginormous Chinese diner menu

[22:11] of how to play a game.

[22:12] I feel like our heads are gonna be spinning with how much Jersey Jack tries to cram into

[22:19] Harry Potter.

[22:21] So, you know, I, I've sort of like love where we're all at now in Pimbal because I do

[22:28] the community for the most part is really connected.

[22:33] I think a lot of the newbies who came in during COVID, I think they've all been burned.

[22:39] I think they've all learned a lesson.

[22:41] You know, I see these guys.

[22:42] You know who they are.

[22:43] I don't have the name names, but they came into Pimbal during COVID.

[22:47] They got bit by the bug.

[22:48] They bought every game as it came out and then they sold games and made humongous losses

[22:55] on their spreadsheet.

[22:56] And they didn't even play the games that much.

[22:59] They didn't enjoy the games nearly enough to take the losses that they took.

[23:04] And the little dirty secret about the hobby that we're all in right now, gang, is that

[23:11] there's a thousands of unsold games.

[23:14] And one of the show topics I'm going to be discussing over the next few weeks, as we

[23:18] think about what do you do with all that unsold inventory, something's got to get, right?

[23:24] This map pricing model, it's again, like it's not working.

[23:29] Like you got these dealers with Venom Elise in box.

[23:32] I know a dealer that's got 100 GNR Elise in a box.

[23:36] And the thing is they can't publicly list these games for sale.

[23:41] I think the Pimbal industry needs to more reflect a car dealership where, you know,

[23:48] a last year's model is discounted, right?

[23:52] And two years ago, even more discounted, Guns and Roses is almost a four year old model

[24:00] of a Pimbal machine.

[24:02] And you know, if Jersey Jack is telling dealers, you can't advertise GNR for less than 10

[24:09] to 5, but the market value for one is 7,500, I think it gets a little silly.

[24:16] And then dealers have to have their friends list the games for sale and it's all disingenuous

[24:22] a little bit.

[24:23] Or dealers have to open up the game and stream it and then sell it used.

[24:27] We see that a lot, like streaming a game and then, you know, because they have to, because

[24:33] they're not allowed to sell it at a discount.

[24:37] You know, the only company I saw that their games on sale was AP.

[24:41] I mean, I mean, we know they need to sell their games and they got to clear out that inventory.

[24:47] You know, the hard part is like, it's because a company that does it, I think what makes

[24:53] them reluctant to do it, it's admitting that you handed people a loss.

[25:00] So like, let's face it, like Venomle was 13,000.

[25:04] It's now like a $9,000 LE, like new in box.

[25:08] You know, and I think Stern, you know, Stern struggles to sort of, because if you communicate

[25:15] to the early adopters that they, that their game is now worth $4,000 less, they're going

[25:23] to have a fear of commitment of buying future titles from you.

[25:28] I think Venom should have only had 350 LEs.

[25:32] I also told this to my friends at Stern, and I say my friends at Stern because I do

[25:36] think Stern is listening and I think they need to try different stuff.

[25:39] I don't think every game should have an LE.

[25:42] I mean that.

[25:44] Like, why does every game need an LE?

[25:46] I get the margins are good.

[25:48] This and that.

[25:49] But like, I don't know, like, is there demand?

[25:52] And if you are going to do an LE of a game with low demand, like John Wick, like John

[25:57] Wick, a thousand LEs, well, it's just like a bone-headed move.

[26:03] Like you didn't do any market research.

[26:06] You just put, you know, the next title into the same playbook and thought that the defense

[26:12] would intercept and man to the community intercept that move and destroy the value of John

[26:19] Wick, LE's.

[26:21] Now Stern making old titles, Chad just said this on Facebook.

[26:25] I think, you know, what we've seen with Metallica, I think as people super excited, super nervous

[26:33] at the same time.

[26:35] If you own a Tron LE right now, and this is what I'm really imploring a George and Seth

[26:42] really think about, if you own a Tron LE right now, you're part of a special club.

[26:48] I believe they only made 400 Tron LEs.

[26:54] I think Tron was 400, not 500, correct me if I'm wrong people.

[26:58] I'm pretty good at my pinball history.

[26:59] You know, I'm pretty good.

[27:00] Sometimes when I talk to people at Stern, I'm like, I'm telling them what they did.

[27:05] They're like, no, I don't even think they were numbered.

[27:07] Yeah, they were numbered.

[27:08] You know, sometimes they say stuff and I'm like, do you not know your own product history?

[27:12] I think Tron was 400 or was it 500?

[27:16] Someone let me know.

[27:17] Someone here must have them.

[27:18] So the special thing about Tron is when they made Tron LE, there was no premium, right?

[27:26] You gotta remember what that means.

[27:29] It's like, this is it.

[27:31] Like this is it.

[27:32] So there was 400 and there was no premium and it had like the fiber optic ramps and it

[27:38] had an exclusive, daft punk multi ball.

[27:44] Now think about Stern since then.

[27:47] Have they ever given people like a real exclusive gameplay experience in the software for

[27:54] buying an LE and I think that's one of the reasons why Tron LE is so damn like coveted

[28:02] because it's like you either have that experience 400 people on the planet have it and nobody

[28:08] else does.

[28:10] And then you go from the LE to the pro and they never screwed over the LE buyers by making

[28:15] premiums.

[28:16] You know, remember when they did walking dead LE and no premium and they said they were

[28:21] never making premiums and then they did.

[28:24] Remember what that did to the walking dead collectors at that time.

[28:28] And so if Stern is going to make another run, what I would do if I were them is I would

[28:35] do 400 new trons.

[28:37] I think you got to keep the numbers consistent.

[28:40] I think you got to give original owners a chance to have matching number of games.

[28:45] That's how I would do it.

[28:46] I wouldn't make a thousand even though the demand is there.

[28:49] I can just make it special.

[28:51] And what Stern can now do as they see the feeding frenzy for Metallica, I know this is not

[28:57] going to be popular with some people right now, but the truth is this Metallica LE could

[29:03] have been more than 13 and they still would have sold everyone.

[29:08] And in a weird way, they could have priced it even higher because it is more special

[29:16] than a John Wick LE or a Venom LE or James Bond LE and a Pooh Fighters LE.

[29:22] I think what they should have done.

[29:25] I think what they should have done because now that you've got this, you know, a plethora

[29:31] of games at a thousand LEs, does in 500 become a super LE, right?

[29:37] Just think about that for a minute.

[29:38] Like 500 now is super limited in a world where everything else has a thousand.

[29:44] And so I think they could have done something like that.

[29:47] And I also think, you know, make it a real SLE of Metallica.

[29:52] It should have an exclusive topper.

[29:54] It should come with exclusive songs.

[29:57] It should come with stuff that maybe is just not in the premium of the game.

[30:03] And I think if you did that and you really made it awesome like that.

[30:06] And again, like get James or Lars to do a personal call out.

[30:10] Like are you ready to rock, canada?

[30:12] Like they could have done that.

[30:13] Like they could have done that the way they did it with, you know, Adam West and Batman

[30:18] with unique call outs.

[30:20] So when people say, please don't encourage higher prices.

[30:23] So just the truth is, I'm just looking at the market, my friend.

[30:28] I'm looking at the market and I'm looking at like who buys these things and there is

[30:33] an opportunity.

[30:35] You know, and again, I look.

[30:36] Sterns got to find that balancing act.

[30:38] You know, they don't want to charge too much and remove all the second hand value.

[30:44] Who's, what's the agenda?

[30:46] Are we buying as an investment or just buying the game we want?

[30:49] Which is it?

[30:50] It can't be both.

[30:51] Why not, Mark?

[30:53] Mark, I don't understand that.

[30:54] That makes, some Mark just said, are we buying it as an investment or are we buying a game

[30:59] we want?

[31:00] It can't be both.

[31:03] Absolutely it can be both.

[31:05] Mark, why can't you buy a game you really want?

[31:08] Play it for a few years and move it on for a lot of money because it was a good investment

[31:15] at the same time.

[31:16] You know, I really love my Dodge Demon and it's, you know, it's held value.

[31:21] It's gone up a little bit, but I'm happy that if I ever need the money, right, something

[31:25] could happen in life and I need to free up $100,000, I could go sell it versus my friends

[31:31] who just bought electric porches and they spent $150,000 on a TyCon, GTS and now it's

[31:41] worth like 90.

[31:42] They lost $60,000.

[31:44] We both love cars.

[31:46] We both love what we're driving, but one was just a better investment.

[31:50] I think those two things don't have to be mutually exclusive of each other.

[31:57] They should have only made Metallica remastered unlimited.

[32:01] No, I don't agree, Louis.

[32:03] I don't agree.

[32:04] I don't know why there's such an anger towards these like collectible versions of things.

[32:09] It's healthy for this hobby.

[32:11] It's been what's pulled stern through all these years.

[32:16] Stern shouldn't care about the secondhand value.

[32:18] That's not their problem.

[32:19] Make a game and sell it.

[32:20] It's not Stern's problem that people want to make money.

[32:23] This isn't the stock market.

[32:25] Well, it's a market though, Pimballer.

[32:28] You know, this is a market.

[32:30] You know, I don't understand why people think this is not an asset.

[32:33] It's an asset.

[32:34] And when you spend north of $10,000 on anything, who doesn't want to get some sort of return

[32:40] on that investment?

[32:42] I think some people, you know, don't get it.

[32:45] Well, look, Trent, if you ever take a ride in a Dodge Demon, you would understand in a heartbeat

[32:50] why the cars worth $100,000.

[32:52] Go inside a $100,000 or BMW Mercedes Audi, which you can easily get those cars north

[32:59] of $100,000.

[33:01] And you won't even have half the thrill of driving a Dodge Demon.

[33:05] Just trust me, man.

[33:06] Anyone, there's an ignorance in the car world that the Dodge Demon isn't worth the money.

[33:11] And then I take people for rides.

[33:13] And I'm talking about people who have exotics, who have roles, voices, Ferraris, Lamborghinis,

[33:19] they get it.

[33:20] Like they get it.

[33:22] You know, it's a special vehicle.

[33:24] And if you're a car enthusiast, you know how to appreciate what each company is putting

[33:31] on the table.

[33:32] If sternal out dealers to discount models after years, does that affect the standard production

[33:38] quantities?

[33:39] I don't know.

[33:41] I don't know.

[33:42] I think not.

[33:43] I think there's a title wave coming where there's just so many games in boxes.

[33:54] This is sitting in a warehouse in Chicago.

[33:58] Where are those games going to go?

[34:00] I mean, that's the question I'm just curious.

[34:02] Like where are they going to go?

[34:03] Who are they going to go to?

[34:05] And when that does happen and we oversaturate the market, I think it's going to be a pretty

[34:11] rough period.

[34:13] And, you know, like I think people just add a room.

[34:16] I don't know about you guys, but like I'm at a room already.

[34:19] I got maybe room for one more pin upstairs.

[34:21] Like it probably sneak one into the garage.

[34:24] But how many of you like raise of hands are just at a room?

[34:28] You need to sell a game to bring a new one in.

[34:30] And that's probably more of the issue for people than money.

[34:35] Absolutely.

[34:36] It's harder for operators to make money with games costing so much.

[34:40] So it's an interesting time in pinball.

[34:43] It's an interesting time in pinball.

[34:44] I'll say this.

[34:45] As I get older and hopefully a little bit wiser and I realize some of the mistakes of a

[34:52] younger version of me, I'm sort of sort of over the whole collecting and having just

[35:00] stuff to flex and thinking that, you know, I don't know.

[35:05] When I see all these guys with less than two and a half plays on a game that's been

[35:10] out for like six, seven years, I don't get it.

[35:16] I don't get it.

[35:17] You know, I drive my car.

[35:19] I play all my Neo Geos.

[35:22] I bought too many of them.

[35:24] I don't need three for them.

[35:25] You know, I started to collect all the different cabs.

[35:28] And then I didn't care anymore because the community that loves Neo Geo, they're all bitter

[35:34] a-holes anyway.

[35:35] Like they just, they come at you with jealousy, envy and hate.

[35:39] Like legitimately, I tried to sell my SC19, which is the bigger version of this for like

[35:45] $6,500.

[35:46] And everyone on Facebook is telling me I'm an idiot.

[35:49] I'm a moron.

[35:50] That's too much, you know, too much for it.

[35:52] And I've got a guy in Kuwait that wants to wire me $11,000 for it.

[35:56] I just don't want to sell it to someone in Kuwait and DHL shipping and customs.

[36:02] I don't want to sell it like that because if anything happens to it and then he does

[36:07] like a charge back through like eBay and then the eBay fees and then what?

[36:13] I've got this busted up unit and I'm going to have to deal with- I want someone to pull

[36:18] up here with cash and hand and put it in the back of their truck and take it home and

[36:25] enjoy it.

[36:26] That's- who keeps saying we love Trump?

[36:28] Like this is not- this is a weird- is this like a spam?

[36:32] Let's get Trent Briggs verified.

[36:35] Who- Trent, you're going.

[36:37] We're moderating you, okay?

[36:40] Let's- we're going to put you on a timeout for 10 minutes because this isn't like a political

[36:45] page.

[36:46] This is a pinball chat.

[36:49] Vote for who you want people.

[36:50] I think we're kind of in trouble.

[36:51] Maybe a little bit either way.

[36:53] It just- is what it is.

[36:54] All right.

[36:55] So let's- let's read the names.

[36:57] Let's get them in the hat.

[36:58] Let's read the names.

[36:59] I want to say congratulations to everybody that followed the rules.

[37:03] I told you how to do it.

[37:05] It was very simple.

[37:08] I'm just going to say this.

[37:10] Pe- let's- let's just go down and read all the names and then I'm going to cut them

[37:14] up and we're going to put them in the hat.

[37:15] How's that sound, all right?

[37:17] All right.

[37:18] So here are your contestants for the Metallica limited edition.

[37:22] It is- this game is coming from- I will connect you with how to get this game afterwards.

[37:29] I'm waiting for a kill-in to pull the name out of the hat at 11 o'clock.

[37:34] Tentatively, if he's home by then.

[37:37] I will use Brenda's phone to call the winner.

[37:40] They- you know- and we're going to do it that way.

[37:43] It's going to be fine.

[37:44] I'm not even going to announce the winner.

[37:45] I'm going to call the number first so we can announce the name live as he or she picks

[37:50] up.

[37:51] I don't think there's a single woman on this list as I always say.

[37:55] Women are too smart to drop $13,000 on pinball machines.

[38:00] Did I say anything about back to the future?

[38:03] I already talked about it a little bit.

[38:06] Jersey Jack and Stern obviously would love to make the game.

[38:10] I think that- I think Stern would be the smarter move.

[38:13] I think Stern can make thousands of them in a year.

[38:17] Jersey Jack couldn't.

[38:19] And I think someone like Elwyn would make it.

[38:21] Can you- I think about it again.

[38:23] Would you not want Keith Elwyn to make back to the future?

[38:26] Who at Jersey Jack would make a better game than Keith Elwyn?

[38:31] And look, it's all going to come up to Barry now.

[38:34] I think there's a combination of humbleness versus ego versus reality check for Barry.

[38:42] I don't know if he wants to be the designer and be pinball famous by making back to the

[38:47] future.

[38:48] I don't think he's as good as Keith Elwyn.

[38:52] And I do think that Barry was smart.

[38:55] He'd ink a good deal.

[38:57] Make money on every game sold.

[38:59] It's a win-win win for everybody.

[39:01] Everybody wins that way.

[39:03] So I just think- I think that would be the way I would do it.

[39:07] But it's in his court.

[39:08] It's in his court.

[39:09] I know that every company would love to have the license.

[39:12] All right.

[39:13] So we got Robert- I'm going to read the names.

[39:14] Robert Cuccini.

[39:15] Hopefully I'm saying your names, right?

[39:18] Joe Fiori, Jim Bond, who's in Tokyo.

[39:21] So I got to see like gang.

[39:24] You international guys, like I don't know if they can ship internationally.

[39:27] I know the Hector is on there internationally.

[39:30] So we'll have to figure this out.

[39:32] I didn't exclude anybody who was not in the- who was global.

[39:37] All right.

[39:38] So like there's that.

[39:39] I don't- I don't know if there's anyone on here from Australia.

[39:42] So we've got Jerry Benney, Richard Harris, McLaughlin, Kevin Smeange, Steve Dobbins, Tyson

[39:53] Hoffman, Brian Malard, Chris Greeney, Zach Boocamp, Keith Galasey.

[40:00] If I butchered your names, people, sorry.

[40:02] I mean, it's Glenn Hansen, Ryan Heath, Adam Greer, Hector, Castray Hong, Castray Hong,

[40:14] Hector, Patrick Oles, Willie Mittly, Ray Garnbari, Nick Sagan, Mike Donk, Ryan Dexter, Lawrence

[40:25] Levine, Adam Fresselone, Pete Rosen, Pablo P, Jay McGuire, Dean Heinrichsen, Tom

[40:36] Pletcher, Mike.

[40:37] Wait, wait, wait, do we have two Heinrichsons?

[40:43] I thought I just said Heinrichsons.

[40:45] Hold on.

[40:46] No, Heinrichsen.

[40:47] Oh, there's two different names.

[40:50] There's a Heinrichsons and a Heinrichsons.

[40:53] There's two different names.

[40:54] One area, because it's sound familiar, but they're spelled differently.

[40:56] All right.

[40:57] Dana Martin, Enzo Ventreia, Greg Jones, Pete Meno, Will Ware, Ben DeLong, Kevin Peters,

[41:07] Troy Swope, Craig Roth, Jeff Eppner, B. S. Scandari, Nahiti, Anthony Salerno, Ryan

[41:19] Saunders, Rodney Cumgis, Cucongis.

[41:25] Sorry, Rodney.

[41:26] It's not, it doesn't roll off the tongue.

[41:27] Jason Riffa, Chris Chapman, and Marty Robbins.

[41:34] No, Marty Robbins is not on this list.

[41:37] Marty Robbins is watching a movie right now doing A. OK.

[41:42] I can't believe, I mean, it's funny to me.

[41:45] It is funny to me that whole thing is trying to unfold.

[41:51] And it's not fooling anybody.

[41:54] Obviously he knew what was going on with Hages when he was shilling the centaurs.

[41:58] And I just love all the revisionist history, the whitewashing of it.

[42:02] And you know, as I literally, just the reason why I did the show I did about it this week

[42:08] is you don't get to do that.

[42:10] You just don't get to like mislead people when you should have known better and you did

[42:15] know better.

[42:17] And then just get like, you know, forgiven and you get to come back and enjoy the hobby

[42:22] and just act like you were just an employee that didn't know what was going on.

[42:27] And I think what Jeff called all of us was really unprofessional, uncalled for.

[42:33] And I think it just shows the true nature of some of these gentlemen.

[42:36] I think they have tremendous egos.

[42:38] I think they're very entitled.

[42:41] And I think they're very angry.

[42:43] And I think they think they're better than us.

[42:45] I really do.

[42:46] When you call people unintelligent, if you think Marty had anything to do with like the

[42:53] haggis is like collapse or knowingly misled people, come on man, you did a show for a

[42:58] year where Marty dodged every single question about haggis.

[43:02] And not only that, he laughed in the face of people that were concerned about haggis

[43:06] pinball and their ability to manufacture games.

[43:10] I think they do live in a bubble.

[43:13] And you know, I again, just had to call it like I saw it because it's not cool.

[43:22] And it just was a stupid show to do.

[43:24] It's like, if you want Marty to come back, just come back and let him talk for himself,

[43:29] but to insult everybody as a way to sort of pave the way for his return.

[43:35] Like, I don't know, Jeff, man, that wasn't smart.

[43:38] Craig Roth, why do you want to join the video right now?

[43:40] You're not joining.

[43:41] I'm not having a guest on right now, okay?

[43:43] Big so set.

[43:44] No one's joining.

[43:45] No one's joining.

[43:46] All right.

[43:47] Let me cut these names up as we talk.

[43:50] And everyone's going into the hat.

[43:53] Everyone has equal opportunity to win.

[43:55] I'm excited for each and every one of you.

[43:57] I'm, you know, in 46 of you are going to lose.

[43:59] So it is what it is.

[44:02] I don't know any other way to do this.

[44:04] I thought this was the most fair thing to do.

[44:07] People gave me slack for even doing this game.

[44:09] Like I, they're literally like, there's a marketing storm.

[44:11] You're not doing any, like, come on.

[44:13] Like no good deed goes unpunished in the pinball hobby people.

[44:17] And I really do mean it when I say it.

[44:20] I think there's a lot of really awesome people in pinball.

[44:24] And then I think there's a lot of really, I don't know, like strange people in our hobby

[44:29] that really do hide behind a keyboard and just insult.

[44:36] And, you know, we don't know who they are.

[44:38] They're kind of behind their avatar names.

[44:40] And, you know, they don't really stand in front of their vitriol.

[44:46] And you know, it gets a little tiring dealing with it.

[44:49] And I think, you know, there's no room for that anymore.

[44:53] And I think if you kind of approach your life as like how many days can I wake up in a good

[45:02] mood, you're not going to wake up and, you know, curse people out on pinball forums and

[45:12] all that stuff.

[45:14] Now that being said, if we're unintelligent efforts because we think that, you know, one

[45:20] of two employees, the guy I want to talk to is that duck pinball guy.

[45:24] You know, all those employees at Quit Haggis, they quit the company, they knew it was going

[45:29] on.

[45:30] You know, then why didn't Marty quit?

[45:32] I mean, that's really the easiest question.

[45:35] If you, if everyone else saw that the house was on fire and exited the house, why didn't

[45:42] you know you, you stayed, you promoted the company, you convinced people to spend more

[45:49] money when everybody else was quitting.

[45:53] Okay.

[45:54] George Gomez is in the house.

[45:56] I told George to join George.

[45:57] Welcome to the Metallica Ellie sort of offer to a fan out there to get one at MSRP.

[46:06] George, welcome to the party.

[46:09] And George, you're right.

[46:10] No good deed goes unpunished.

[46:11] I think sometimes too with all of, all of what happens in pinball.

[46:15] And I mean this when I say it, when you, when you take the tour of Stern and Jersey Jack

[46:21] and these, you see what goes into these games and you see the people that make them and

[46:25] the amount of work and the amount of effort.

[46:29] And then how easy it is, right?

[46:31] How easy it is to unravel.

[46:33] They, the joy this hobby brings everybody because you're at home and you're unhappy at

[46:39] you're probably drinking and you're typing angrily.

[46:44] It's weird, right?

[46:45] It's weird.

[46:46] I think it makes everybody, especially at the pinball companies, sort of you know, reluctant

[46:52] to engage as much as they want to.

[46:55] I remember walking through Stern and it was the day after, you know, Jack Danger had

[46:59] done the initial stream of X-Men and he was kind of all bummed out.

[47:05] And because they had done the stream, they were having fun with it.

[47:08] They dressed up in X-Men costumes and they were having some brutal games and the code

[47:13] was still early.

[47:15] And it just like, you know, it wasn't the best showing.

[47:19] And then Jack is just like deflated because he realized like, you know, people are not

[47:24] seeing like what the magic is and the magic is there.

[47:28] And so, you know, but he just had this look like he was just, just destroyed.

[47:34] And I'm like, man, like what, like what?

[47:35] But this is your moment, like, you know, and I can see how the community at times can

[47:43] weigh people down to the point where the very people that are giving everything they have

[47:50] to making people happy are just exhausted and feeling like they never win.

[47:56] So it's something interesting for all of us to think about.

[48:00] And I look, I struggle with this all the time on this show.

[48:04] I think my show's been an ever evolving journey, you know, to give constructive criticism

[48:10] or feedback.

[48:12] And I think when you do give constructive feedback, it's delivered without curses, without

[48:18] personal attacks.

[48:20] And I think when you, when you give constructive feedback, it should be clear that you're giving

[48:26] this feedback on the game because you want to see the games get better.

[48:30] And you have a thought on how they could possibly improve the games for the marketing around

[48:36] Timbal, right?

[48:37] I have a lot of thoughts on that.

[48:39] I have a lot of thoughts on, you know, these L.E.s and again, but when you approach it,

[48:45] where you're trying to help, you know, I want Jersey Jack Games to get better by integrating

[48:50] the clips in a better way.

[48:52] We know it can be done, right?

[48:53] Stern did it with jaws, wise avatars, all muted, right?

[48:57] And I mean that.

[48:59] I really like Mark Sidon.

[49:00] I think he's a great guy.

[49:02] I'm just perplexed how nobody gave that feedback internally over there.

[49:07] But I'm not going to blame like or be angry.

[49:10] I just, just not the way I would have done it.

[49:12] All right.

[49:13] So we've got all these names.

[49:15] George going into a hat.

[49:18] You know, this is the hottest game in Timbal in a long time.

[49:21] I think Metallica, Ellie.

[49:24] Metallica, Ellie is the hottest launch I've seen.

[49:28] Since Godzilla, when Godzilla came out, a little history lesson for all of you out there,

[49:35] it was $10,500, right?

[49:38] You should, George, George, cover your ears.

[49:42] How was Stern able to make that game with all that stuff or $10,500?

[49:49] And John Wick with half as much in it is $2500 more.

[49:54] But it was like, it was kind of like that last 10-5 game.

[50:00] And it was like awesome.

[50:01] I mean, it's not just me saying this.

[50:03] Godzilla is ranked on the top 100 as number one, right?

[50:09] So the number one game of all time ranked by the community came out at a great price.

[50:16] And you know, we used to complain 10K by Christmas.

[50:19] Remember when that was the joke?

[50:21] Now it's like 18K by Christmas with this Metallica.

[50:24] So it's like, it came out at 10-5.

[50:27] They made 1,000 of them.

[50:29] They sold out.

[50:31] No, it wasn't impossible to get one.

[50:33] Like you could, when they make 1,000, you can call around and get one.

[50:38] But here's what happened to Godzilla.

[50:40] That was right before COVID, remember, when the lockdown happened, right?

[50:44] And the supply shortage happened.

[50:46] Godzilla is instantly, like within a few months, a Godzilla Ellie, after we realized,

[50:52] oh my gosh, this game is everything.

[50:55] Like it's got the moments, it's got the assets, it's got the personality, it's got the

[50:59] next, it's got the humor, it's got the, you know, the mod community's gone crazy.

[51:03] Like it was amazing to watch how everyone rallied around Godzilla, right?

[51:09] Rallyed around the game.

[51:11] I think the only like controversy at launch was does Godzilla look like a watermelon

[51:17] and maybe a little bit, maybe zombie Eddie don't kill me, maybe a little bit, maybe a

[51:21] little bit watermelony?

[51:22] But you know, we all got over that because it just looked great.

[51:25] And when you stood over at Godzilla and you played it, I think it reminded everybody what

[51:29] they love so much about pinball.

[51:32] And it had personality, the way you could change the audio to be in Japanese.

[51:38] It just, Godzilla is just perfect.

[51:41] It is a perfect example of translating a theme into a pinball game where there's like

[51:47] George, you always used to say this, it's got to be like three interesting things to

[51:51] shoot at.

[51:52] It has that.

[51:53] It's got to have like, you know, call outs that get your energy going.

[51:57] It has that when a multi ball starts.

[52:00] It has like this energy, right?

[52:02] And I, you know, like when we have a tar multi ball starts, it's like you literally are

[52:06] like, I feel like I'm in church.

[52:09] I feel like when they're like, all they lose your mountain multi ball, it's like there's

[52:13] no energy.

[52:14] There is no energy.

[52:15] Everyone should go study how Adams family and Metallica sort of get you going.

[52:22] Kill.

[52:23] I do need help, Killian.

[52:25] All right, here we go, Killian.

[52:26] We've got five minutes, though.

[52:27] Give me five minutes.

[52:28] And then you're going to pick the winning name out of this canada hat.

[52:34] And I'm going to call the number.

[52:36] And here's how it's going to work.

[52:38] You need to pick up the phone to win this spot, right?

[52:43] Not the game.

[52:44] I'm not buying you a game for $13,000.

[52:46] You will win this spot.

[52:47] I know there was some confusion there.

[52:50] Not going to give you a free game.

[52:53] But this is going to be super fun.

[52:55] And Killian is going to be the decider of somebody's fate.

[52:59] And gang look, I hope whoever wins this, I just want to say this.

[53:02] I hope you don't sell it.

[53:04] I hope you really entered this because you are a Metallica fan.

[53:07] And I want to say thank you to everyone that reached out and shared your personal stories

[53:12] about Metallica.

[53:14] Some of you had babies wearing Metallica clothing.

[53:17] You had game rooms filled with Metallica artwork.

[53:21] And you know, you really are in love with the band.

[53:25] And I think that to me is how every music pin should be, right?

[53:29] It's like, I always say this.

[53:31] Like, out of all the pinball machines that have been made over the last like 10 years,

[53:35] the 8th fans have really had it the best.

[53:38] I mean, if you love ACDC, Guns and Roses, Metallica, if you love food fighters, if you love

[53:46] Elton John, if you love Iron Maiden, you know, if you love, what am I missing?

[53:52] I said ACDC, like, if you love, I mean, heck, kiss.

[53:57] I even think Erasmith, like talk about an awesome toy in a game.

[54:00] Like, if you love those acts, you love the pinball machines.

[54:05] And the thing about music pins that I think make it easier to get it, right?

[54:11] Is because the one thing you just have to do is play the damn music, right?

[54:16] It's not like stuff physically is missing that you want it in the game.

[54:20] Where a movie and TV show is different.

[54:23] Because when you make a pinball machine based on a movie, there's like physical things

[54:28] you want to see in there.

[54:29] So if you make back to the future, you got to have a delorean where the doors go up, right?

[54:35] Or the clock tower.

[54:37] You got to have a hoverboard.

[54:39] You got to have maybe a Pepsi perfect coming up from underneath the play field.

[54:43] You know, you get, there's certain things where like, oh, if it doesn't have this, it's

[54:46] not connecting to the theme the right way.

[54:48] But music, just hit him with it and then do fun stuff.

[54:52] Killin' you getting ready, buddy?

[54:54] Hold on.

[54:55] Hold on.

[54:56] We got three minutes to go.

[54:57] Mama, I need your phone.

[55:00] And then we're going to do this.

[55:01] I'm cutting up all the names.

[55:04] And we're almost got everybody in the hat.

[55:08] You know, I think one of the coolest, you know, when I look at guns and roses and slashes

[55:14] involvement with that game, it's absolutely like, it's a rare thing.

[55:20] And I tell this to people, you know, slash made this game.

[55:23] Hold on.

[55:24] Don't touch any of the names, buddy.

[55:25] I don't want to kill any of it.

[55:26] Why do you have middens on?

[55:29] Here come on, buddy.

[55:30] I'm going to get you up here.

[55:31] We're going to, we're going to interview for you free live it.

[55:33] Okay?

[55:35] You want to tell Mr. Gomez what you think about his Ellie?

[55:39] Is Ellie?

[55:40] Hold on.

[55:41] Again, we got four more to cut up.

[55:46] Then we're going to get killing it on the lap.

[55:48] Brennan can have the phone, please.

[55:49] Don't touch, don't touch.

[55:51] Killin' I like your gloves, your middens.

[55:55] Okay.

[55:56] Is this everybody?

[55:57] Okay.

[55:58] Okay.

[55:59] So I want you guys to see this.

[55:59] All the names are going in.

[56:02] I just knocked that over.

[56:04] All right, here we go.

[56:06] We're back.

[56:07] Well, all the names go in here.

[56:09] Okay, the names, buddy, are going to go into the hat.

[56:12] And we're going to pick Brennan's handing me her phone.

[56:15] All the names are going in.

[56:16] Okay?

[56:17] So we're going to drop them all in.

[56:19] I'm going to move it around.

[56:23] And we're going to let Killian pick one out.

[56:29] I wish I could give 47 people Metallica Ellie.

[56:33] George will talk.

[56:34] I think Stern doing a lottery like this would be a lot of fun.

[56:38] And I think it would be a moment.

[56:39] I think you make the Stern lottery.

[56:41] You get set there and get in George with the big.

[56:45] Everyone gets a, you know, their name on a ball.

[56:48] And we pull out like 10 names.

[56:49] Like make it like an NBA draft lottery where you're in the draft and we can figure out

[56:55] different ways where you can increase the amount of odds of winning.

[56:58] I think it'd be a lot of fun.

[56:59] All right, killing here we go.

[57:01] You ready?

[57:03] I don't know why my boy has, it is 11 o'clock.

[57:06] We're not missing any names.

[57:07] Come here. Come on.

[57:08] Sit up here.

[57:09] That's it.

[57:09] Okay.

[57:10] That's it.

[57:11] Yeah.

[57:12] That's it.

[57:13] Killian, how much, how much do you think a pinball machine should cost?

[57:19] One.

[57:20] One dollar?

[57:22] Okay.

[57:22] So we've just put Stern pinball and everybody else out of business.

[57:26] Killian.

[57:27] Do you like Metallica?

[57:30] Okay. That's good.

[57:31] That's good.

[57:31] All right, Killian.

[57:33] You're going to pick out of your hat.

[57:37] This canada hat, you're going to pick a name, right?

[57:40] Now I want you to, we're going to move the names around.

[57:43] I'm not looking.

[57:43] I'm not looking.

[57:45] All right.

[57:46] All right.

[57:47] I want you to pick.

[57:48] I want one fell out.

[57:50] Good job, Brenna.

[57:51] Put it back in.

[57:52] One fell out.

[57:53] All right.

[57:54] Okay.

[57:55] You ready?

[57:55] All right.

[57:57] All right.

[57:58] Here we go.

[57:58] One.

[57:59] Just pick one.

[58:01] Just one.

[58:02] Okay.

[58:03] Don't show me who it is.

[58:05] All right.

[58:06] We have one in hand.

[58:08] All right.

[58:09] Now we are going to call, Killian.

[58:10] I want you, when I call this number, to say you won.

[58:14] Okay.

[58:15] Can you do that?

[58:16] All right.

[58:17] We're going to call right now.

[58:18] Take him, mommy's phone.

[58:20] This is fun, right?

[58:21] It's fun.

[58:23] This, this, you know, Killian doesn't come cheap.

[58:25] His hourly rate is about 10 times mine.

[58:28] He brings a level of adorableness to this.

[58:35] And we're going to see if we have a winner.

[58:40] Yeah.

[58:41] He just loves his overrefection right now.

[58:43] All right.

[58:44] Two.

[58:45] Yeah.

[58:46] Okay.

[58:47] Here we go.

[58:48] Okay.

[58:49] I'm going to say.

[58:50] Say you won.

[58:51] You won.

[58:52] You won.

[58:53] Oh, thank you very much.

[58:55] I'm so stoked.

[58:56] All right.

[58:57] All right.

[58:58] So our winner.

[58:59] I know 46 people right now are like staring at their cell phones.

[59:03] Pawbo P.

[59:04] Pawbo P.

[59:05] Congratulations.

[59:06] Congratulations.

[59:07] Now Pawbo, where are you from?

[59:10] I want to Paw.

[59:11] Pawbo, where are you?

[59:14] Where are you from?

[59:15] Well, where are you from?

[59:17] Don't scream.

[59:18] Okay.

[59:19] Where are you from, Pawbo?

[59:20] I am from Delaware.

[59:21] Okay.

[59:22] Are you a big Metallica fan?

[59:24] Huge, absolutely huge.

[59:26] I am from I will win.

[59:29] Kaling, Kaling, Kaling.

[59:30] Okay.

[59:31] Okay.

[59:32] Okay.

[59:33] So tell us like, have you been a Metallica fan since the 80s, 90s?

[59:35] What's your, what's your, how much do you love them?

[59:39] I love Metallica as much as the next guy.

[59:43] I saw the Metallica back in the late 80s.

[59:46] I didn't even really know who they were.

[59:49] All right.

[59:50] What's your favorite album?

[59:53] Because I was nothing but an Oscar I could tell.

[59:56] It wasn't until Lou King.

[59:59] Fire, man.

[01:00:01] It was so much better hair.

[01:00:03] Yeah.

[01:00:04] I wanted to hate it.

[01:00:05] Yeah.

[01:00:06] I was like, oh, look at this guy.

[01:00:07] I feel like the black album, right, with Andrew Samman,

[01:00:11] was like, what, 91?

[01:00:13] And that was really when like the old fan base was sort of like,

[01:00:16] they're selling out with more mainstream hits.

[01:00:19] But that's I think when a lot of people like just

[01:00:22] fell them up with the band.

[01:00:23] Well, Pablo, here's the deal.

[01:00:25] Congrats.

[01:00:26] You're going to keep this game, right?

[01:00:27] You're not going to flip it.

[01:00:28] You're not going to scalp it, right?

[01:00:30] Okay.

[01:00:31] So we're going to check in.

[01:00:32] We're going to check in every like six months

[01:00:36] and just want to see a photo of it in that game room.

[01:00:38] How's that sound?

[01:00:40] All right.

[01:00:41] All right.

[01:00:42] All right.

[01:00:42] And I will, Pablo, I will connect with you after this.

[01:00:46] And I'll get you all the details on how to get the game paid

[01:00:49] for and sent to you.

[01:00:50] But congratulations.

[01:00:53] And thank you for everyone who participated in this drawing.

[01:00:57] Again, I wish I had more games to give away to all of you.

[01:01:00] But what we'll keep doing this.

[01:01:01] This is a lot of fun.

[01:01:02] And then you're not going to back out.

[01:01:03] Because last time we did this, it was James Bond,

[01:01:05] Elliot, everybody packed out.

[01:01:06] But this is good.

[01:01:08] This is good.

[01:01:09] Pablo, I'm happy we can make your Saturday morning

[01:01:12] a special one.

[01:01:14] I skipped the gym for this.

[01:01:16] All right.

[01:01:17] Well, go hit the gym now and place a Metallica and hit it hard.

[01:01:21] It goes against everything you ever said.

[01:01:24] Yeah.

[01:01:25] I always say like if people did as many pushups

[01:01:27] as words they posted on Pinside, this whole hobby would be ripped.

[01:01:32] And like, it's just, it's amazing to be.

[01:01:35] All right.

[01:01:35] Pablo, well, thank you very much.

[01:01:37] I'm super excited for you.

[01:01:38] And I can't wait for you to get the game.

[01:01:40] Thank you.

[01:01:41] Thank you, Kylian.

[01:01:42] Kylian, say thank you.

[01:01:43] Oh, poor.

[01:01:45] You say you're welcome.

[01:01:45] OK.

[01:01:46] See you, Pablo.

[01:01:47] All right.

[01:01:48] Thank you.

[01:01:49] All right.

[01:01:50] All right.

[01:01:51] Well, that was great.

[01:01:52] You know, look, I'm, I feel like I want to like, should I give one other number and give

[01:01:56] a T-shirt?

[01:01:57] I don't even have T-shirts to give.

[01:01:58] I don't know more merchandise.

[01:01:59] They took all my merchandise down.

[01:02:00] Look, Pablo, I'm super happy for you.

[01:02:03] For all of you who are in the running, thank you for sharing your stories of Metallica.

[01:02:09] I know everybody.

[01:02:10] Give me this baby.

[01:02:11] Hold on a second.

[01:02:12] There's one more.

[01:02:14] Get here.

[01:02:15] We go.

[01:02:16] OK.

[01:02:17] See, this sweet child of mine is the future.

[01:02:21] You know, I keep telling this to everybody.

[01:02:23] This is the future of pinball are the people with children who are going to get bit by

[01:02:29] the pinball, right?

[01:02:30] I mean, you're going to play pinball, right?

[01:02:31] Yeah.

[01:02:32] Of course you're going to play pinball.

[01:02:33] His head looks like a pinball.

[01:02:36] It is completely round and it's absolutely adorable.

[01:02:40] Are you doing all right?

[01:02:41] He's so chill.

[01:02:42] Like, he's the easy one.

[01:02:44] You know, it's killing.

[01:02:46] That's like all the energy and making everything go nuts in our house every day.

[01:02:50] All right.

[01:02:51] Sweet child of mine.

[01:02:52] See, he's got his guns and roses t-shirt on.

[01:02:54] Yeah, get him out of here.

[01:02:55] Get him out of here.

[01:02:56] There we go.

[01:02:57] There we go.

[01:02:58] There's the future of pinball podcasting right there.

[01:03:01] Right there.

[01:03:03] Everybody look, I'm super happy that we did this.

[01:03:06] I'm thankful too that a lot of you sort of helped me see clearly why flipping the game

[01:03:13] was not the right thing to do.

[01:03:16] And you know, look, it's going to happen.

[01:03:18] If there weren't scalpers, gang, there'd be no chance for some of you to get the game once

[01:03:23] it does sell out.

[01:03:25] So when you look at the price of a Taylor Swift concert ticket, you know, paying a few

[01:03:31] thousand over for this masterpiece of a game isn't so bad.

[01:03:37] I think there's a lot of good momentum coming out of this game.

[01:03:43] And I think, you know, the whole hobby has gone like, you know, and it's gone in different

[01:03:48] directions over COVID.

[01:03:49] I think we're all back now.

[01:03:52] We're all kind of, I think appreciating life on a new level now that we've been through

[01:03:56] the pandemic.

[01:03:57] If you've been to shows, I highly recommend going to a show.

[01:04:00] It's a lot different.

[01:04:02] For those of you who went to expo toured the different manufacturers, met the community.

[01:04:07] The amount of good energy and good vibes that were coming out of that show.

[01:04:13] I don't know.

[01:04:14] It made me feel reenergized about pinball.

[01:04:16] And I know it made a lot of you feel that same way.

[01:04:19] And I do encourage everybody, you know, just tune down the forums.

[01:04:23] You know, a lot of noise and echo chamber happening on pin side that I don't think is really

[01:04:28] reflective of the positivity that's in this hobby.

[01:04:33] Now don't get me wrong.

[01:04:34] This isn't some like spreading pinball positivity show.

[01:04:38] Never will.

[01:04:39] Like, I am going to call it as I see it.

[01:04:41] Like, there are good games and there are bad games and there's good quality and there's

[01:04:45] bad quality and there's real talent in pinball.

[01:04:49] And then there's, I think, just some people figuring it out as they go.

[01:04:53] Everybody look, we've had a really fun show.

[01:04:56] I kind of want to end it on a high note.

[01:04:58] Thank you, Mr. Gomez for hanging out.

[01:05:00] Thank you for all the work you do over at Stern Pinball.

[01:05:03] And thank you to all the manufacturers that actually give us enough to discuss, right?

[01:05:08] How games coming out?

[01:05:10] What would we talk about, right?

[01:05:12] We'd still be like, if it wasn't for these guys, we'd be talking about hepp restored theater

[01:05:17] of magic or how much is it going to go up?

[01:05:19] Like, you know, I know, like there's a lot of new stuff happening in pinball that is so

[01:05:24] exciting.

[01:05:25] We've got Spike 3 around the corner, got Harry Potter coming.

[01:05:29] We've got back to the future coming.

[01:05:30] We've got maybe King Kong, maybe Fallout, right?

[01:05:34] Oh, I love speculating what's around the corner.

[01:05:37] Because even when you know like what some of these themes are, you still, it gets your

[01:05:42] imagination going.

[01:05:43] And I mean this when I say it, you know, in a world of Gen Z kids that are all lonely and

[01:05:47] miserable and not happy, it's because they're not imagining stuff.

[01:05:51] They're not dreaming of things.

[01:05:53] They're not in hobbies.

[01:05:54] They're just looking at vapid content all day long that does nothing to make them feel

[01:05:59] a part of something.

[01:06:00] And I always say this, like this community is the elixir to the number one problem in the

[01:06:06] world, which is loneliness.

[01:06:08] Like that is the pandemic that a generation is struggling with.

[01:06:11] And as long as we have these products on each other, I never feel alone in pinball in

[01:06:16] fact, like at any hour, I can hang out with people from all over the world, whether we

[01:06:21] Skype or we do this, yeah, you put up a message on a Patreon chat and people are in it.

[01:06:27] Yeah, buddy.

[01:06:28] Okay, he put some more stuff in a hat and these are just blank pieces of paper.

[01:06:34] Thank you, buddy.

[01:06:35] Okay, thank you for the more letters.

[01:06:37] I appreciate that.

[01:06:38] So everybody, have a great day.

[01:06:41] I love doing this.

[01:06:43] Thank you for all the support.

[01:06:44] All you club members, you know who you are.

[01:06:46] And if you're not a member of the Canadian club, you know we would love to have you.

[01:06:50] It's $5 a month.

[01:06:51] I just went and got two bags of Dunkin' Donuts, ground coffee beans for $20.

[01:06:58] That's a third of the year of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[01:07:00] Everybody be good.

[01:07:02] We'll talk to you soon.

[01:07:03] And again, congrats the pop-up.

[01:07:05] I will, I will.

[01:07:07] We'll do it.

[01:07:10] What did devastating loss last night?

[01:07:13] Up all night watching it.

[01:07:15] Great game.

[01:07:16] We just had to close out the bottom of the tent and that grand slam.

[01:07:19] All right, everything's in there.

[01:07:21] Good job, everybody.

[01:07:22] Canadian Out.

[01:07:23] See you guys.

[01:07:24] Be good.

[01:07:25] Happy Saturday.

[01:07:26] Enjoy this fall day.

[01:07:28] Bye.

[01:07:36] Oh, that note, sweetheart, please don't throw it around the cave.

[01:07:39] Listen to me, please.

[01:07:40] Put it down.

[01:07:41] Listen in here, please.

[01:07:42] What we need to clean the outside of it because it's absolutely just great, it's really dirty.

[01:07:47] And what we need to clean the passes.

[01:07:50] And you can hear the sound of the door.

[01:07:54] That was great.

[01:07:57] Thank you, Bob.

[01:07:58] It's almost time for an ad money.

[01:08:01] Is it?

[01:08:02] Time's not going to let me.

[01:08:05] It's getting smaller.

[01:08:07] I'll put that cross.

[01:08:09] Okay.

[01:08:10] Okay.

[01:08:11] It's time to shoot.

[01:08:14] It's super happy.

[01:08:16] Yeah.

[01:08:17] It's super happy.

[01:08:19] Yeah.

[01:08:20] That's it.
