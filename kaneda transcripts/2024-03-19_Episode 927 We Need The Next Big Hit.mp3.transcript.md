[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] We are post Texas Pinball Festival.

[00:24] A Texas Pinball Festival without the Twippies, but we did get a lot of new games rocking up

[00:30] to the show.

[00:31] We're going to talk about that now.

[00:32] Look, I wasn't at the show, so I can't tell you if the show was any good or not, but I'll

[00:37] say this, I've been to enough TPS, I've been to enough Expos.

[00:41] Going to a pinball show is all about hanging out with people.

[00:44] It's about grabbing some beers and whiskey and talking about pinball in real life to a

[00:49] bunch of nerds like us and having a good time.

[00:52] So I'm sure if you were at the show, you had a great time.

[00:56] It's the worst place on the planet to play new games and get a sense of if the games

[01:01] are any good or not, because if you've been to a show, the games are so loud, all the

[01:06] games are on at the same time, you're really not immersed in any of the gameplay experience

[01:12] unless you're like Canada and you sneak into the show early on when nobody's there and

[01:18] you get to play the games.

[01:19] You know, pinball media should be invited to play these games separate from the show

[01:24] opening.

[01:25] Do you know in my 10 years of doing this show, I've never been invited at a pinball show

[01:31] to get in early and play a manufacturer's game.

[01:35] They throw me in there with the rest of the public and I'm trying to get my opinions on

[01:40] a game while I've got some people behind me making me anxious or I've got some jerko in

[01:46] front of me who's playing a four player game and he's just one person.

[01:50] That's how they treat the world's favorite pinball podcaster with absolutely zero special

[01:55] treatment.

[01:56] So let's talk a little bit about TPF.

[01:58] We're going to get to the news that Canada broke this weekend, the first Bali Williams

[02:03] remake.

[02:04] It's not one of the spectacular titles that you guys were expecting it to be, but it's

[02:08] also a little bit of a unique thing the way this game is coming out.

[02:11] We're going to talk a little bit about Elton John and Jaws Pinball and then what's right

[02:16] around the corner because we know once TPF hits, once we get past March, we're then now

[02:22] looking for the next Stern Cornerstone game and we're thinking ahead.

[02:27] We're not thinking behind us anymore.

[02:29] We're thinking about what's coming out in spring, summer in the pinball world.

[02:32] All right, so at Texas Pinball Festival, the new games were David Fick's Disaster Barbecue

[02:38] Game.

[02:39] We're going to talk a little bit about that.

[02:41] We had Multi-Morphix, The Princess Bride and as far as like new games go that you've never

[02:46] seen before, that was it.

[02:48] Those were the two main new titles.

[02:50] Those were really the two big reveals at TPF or the new games that people had not played

[02:55] before.

[02:56] We got a lot more people getting time on Jaws on Elton John.

[03:00] We got more people getting time on Pulp Fiction, more time on Looney Tunes, more time on Texas

[03:05] Chainsaw Massacre.

[03:06] So look, a lot of new games that are out in the world.

[03:09] A lot of new games that each and every one of you are contemplating whether or not you

[03:13] want to go in on these games.

[03:15] And I think a lot of you out there, when you think about the lineup in pinball, this is

[03:20] the highest pinball has ever been in terms of how much these games cost.

[03:24] Let's just go down the lineup and you tell me if these pinball companies are giving us

[03:29] the dream themes we want for this much money.

[03:32] All right, let's go.

[03:33] Looney Tunes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Jaws, Pulp Fiction.

[03:38] Those two are great.

[03:39] Those two are pretty great A themes, if you ask me.

[03:42] Then we've got Elton John, Barry O's Barbecue Challenge, and the Princess Bride.

[03:48] You know, I wish I was saying like Die Hard, Top Gun, Matrix, Harry Potter, Christmas Vacation,

[03:56] Transformers G1 the Movie, G.I. Joe, A-Team, Cobra Kai, Karate Kid.

[04:02] You know, like there's so many themes that I wish I was saying right now.

[04:06] But I think it's a mixed bag right now in pinball.

[04:08] Oh, I forgot Labyrinth, right?

[04:10] We'll throw Labyrinth into the mix.

[04:11] A lot of people were playing that.

[04:13] And by the way, that build out at TPF where Labyrinth was, absolutely phenomenal build

[04:18] out where they were displaying that game.

[04:20] But I don't even think Labyrinth has sold out, right?

[04:23] It's a whole new pinball world now.

[04:24] I don't think Texas Chainsaw has sold out.

[04:27] I don't think Looney Tunes has sold out.

[04:29] We all know Jaws is not selling that well.

[04:31] You know, I'm hearing distributors are sitting on Jurassic Park 30th Anniversary editions.

[04:36] It's a whole new pinball world, people.

[04:38] And so here's what I heard from the show.

[04:40] I heard people absolutely don't like this barbecue game by American Pinball.

[04:44] It's an absolute joke.

[04:46] We're not going to spend a lot of time on it.

[04:48] I don't even think they're going to sell like 200 units.

[04:51] This thing is dead on arrival.

[04:52] They're not going to sell all 100 LEs.

[04:55] I don't understand it.

[04:56] And look, I spoke to people who played it with an open mind.

[04:59] They went up to the game and they wanted to walk away after ball number two.

[05:03] And again, I just don't think there's any future for American Pinball.

[05:07] As long as this team is over there, this company is never going to make a hit pinball machine.

[05:12] They just don't have the creative vision to make hit pinballs.

[05:16] And I'm just wondering how long New Kesh is going to have the patience before he pulls

[05:20] the plug on this entire thing.

[05:22] So that's American Pinball.

[05:23] Now, multi-morphic The Prince's Bride.

[05:25] Again, didn't hear that much.

[05:27] Like just not hearing that much about this game.

[05:30] The whole thing now is Jerry's got to figure out how to get to more manufacturing efficiencies

[05:34] because if you order one now and you have to wait four or five months to get your game,

[05:40] I just don't think that's going to cut it anymore in pinball.

[05:43] I think the distance between when you give a deposit and when you get your game has to

[05:48] be shorter than where it is right now with multi-morphic.

[05:51] But the platform is always going to be Jerry's issue.

[05:54] You know, it's like a lot of people have issues with this platform and a lot of people are

[05:58] just better human beings than Canada and they won't say anything.

[06:01] See that's always when you have the biggest problem is when people just don't even care

[06:06] and they walk away.

[06:08] They're not going to say they don't like it, but they're not going to buy it.

[06:11] You're not even getting a reaction or any feedback and we know that over the years this

[06:15] has not been a very favorable platform for pinball and I think at this much money, you

[06:21] know, you really are going to have to want to get all the portfolio of games to make sense

[06:26] if you go in on a multi-morphic unit.

[06:28] And so that's why I think it's going to be a really hard sell for people to plop down

[06:33] like 10 to $13,000 for this thing, knowing that like back to the futures coming, knowing

[06:39] that the matrix is coming and knowing that there's just a lot of other games out there

[06:43] that you're not going to lose your shirt on if you want to sell it one day because we've

[06:47] never seen anyone get anywhere close to the return on their investment when they go to

[06:53] sell their multi-morphic platform.

[06:55] It's just a losing proposition and I don't care what anyone says that matters like it

[07:00] matters like resale value now is something everybody has to take into account.

[07:06] It's like I said, if you bought every new in box game over the last two years, I mean

[07:11] all the LES and all the CEs right all the supposed collectors editions of these games,

[07:16] you lost $57,000 people.

[07:19] We did the math.

[07:20] We did a whole show on this thing.

[07:22] You lost $57,000.

[07:24] All right.

[07:24] So nothing huge came out of TPF.

[07:26] So now we're turning a corner to what's next in the pinball world.

[07:30] And I think the pinball world is in for a rough year unless the game is a triple A theme,

[07:37] unless the game is a take my money now kind of game.

[07:41] I don't think there's any middle room anymore.

[07:43] There's no just like, oh, let me just put some time on this game, buy it and lose $3,000.

[07:49] Like nobody's going to be doing this anymore.

[07:51] So here's what's around the corner.

[07:52] And you tell me that we're still not hitting or firing on the right cylinders at these

[07:58] pinball prices.

[07:59] So here are the next three games that are going to come out in the pinball world in

[08:04] the order in which they're going to come out.

[08:06] And all of these games are going to be revealed.

[08:08] Money will be taken on these games before the end of April.

[08:12] So the remainder of March and to the end of April, the next three titles are Funhouse

[08:18] from Pedretti Gaming.

[08:19] Canada broke the exclusive to the world.

[08:22] We're going to talk about that.

[08:23] That game is going to be revealed by the end of this month in March.

[08:27] So Funhouse coming back.

[08:28] Do we want one?

[08:29] Do we need more Funhouse games?

[08:31] You're about to get them.

[08:33] And we're also then going to get ABBA from the pinball brothers, which I think they're

[08:36] going to announce.

[08:37] I think it's April 6 or 7, which is the 50th anniversary of ABBA winning Eurovision.

[08:42] That's going to come out in just a couple of weeks.

[08:45] And then we've got Stern's next cornerstone, which is John Wick, which they are going to

[08:50] reveal to the world in April.

[08:52] Now, right there, let's just stop right there.

[08:54] Are any of you truly deep down in your guts?

[08:57] Are you truly excited about Funhouse remake, ABBA, and John Wick?

[09:03] The only thing I'm excited about right now is my wallet is marked safe from buying any

[09:08] of these themes.

[09:08] Like, where are the themes that are take my money now themes?

[09:12] Now, look, this would have been fine three, four years ago when pinball was so much cheaper

[09:17] and you were somewhat willing to go in on new games and support every company's propositions.

[09:23] But nowadays, like, are you going to be running at this stuff?

[09:26] I don't think so.

[09:27] So let's start with Funhouse.

[09:29] So everybody thought it was going to be Twilight Zone.

[09:32] And trust me, I think Twilight Zone is coming.

[09:35] And Funhouse was not supposed to be the first Bali Williams remake that Padready Gaming

[09:40] put out into the world.

[09:42] But here's why they're doing it.

[09:44] There is a US distributor.

[09:45] I don't know which one.

[09:47] We should guess which one it is.

[09:49] If you know which one it is, please email me at canadepimballatgmail.com.

[09:53] But there is a US distributor that basically is commissioning and working with Rickett

[09:59] Planetary to bring back Funhouse as the first remake.

[10:03] And this distributor has put in a significant order.

[10:07] They've already ordered 400 units of Funhouse Collector's Edition, which will then sell for

[10:14] $11,000 a pop.

[10:17] That's almost a $4 million commitment on the part of this company to sell Funhouses for

[10:24] $11,000.

[10:26] Here's what we know so far about this Funhouse remake.

[10:28] It is the first Bali Williams remake from Padready Gaming.

[10:32] There's going to be three versions of the game, which I also think is a mistake.

[10:36] There's going to be a standard at $8,000, which is just the regular game.

[10:41] Then there's going to be a premium at $9,500 and a CE at $11,000 that will feature Brian

[10:48] Allen's artwork on the premium and the CE.

[10:52] There will be 500 CEs.

[10:55] All of these games will be running on fast boards and have CPR playfields and have genuine

[11:01] Bali Williams parts.

[11:02] Here's the problem though right now.

[11:06] If you go onto the pin side marketplace right now, you can go get a good condition Funhouse

[11:12] for around $6,000.

[11:14] Who the heck in their right mind is going to want to spend $11,000 on a Funhouse?

[11:19] Almost twice the price of what this game is in the current marketplace.

[11:23] What happened to Pinball?

[11:25] If you're going to remake a game, how are you going to remake one that isn't even in

[11:28] that much demand and charge this much money?

[11:32] 2.0 kit, like Rudy's Nightmare, will be some of the upgraded code that will go into these

[11:38] games, but they already released those kits.

[11:41] Those kits weren't even that successful.

[11:43] There's just not enough demand for this stuff and so that's going to happen.

[11:47] I think this is a huge gamble for whoever this distributor is who put in this big order for

[11:52] these games and I don't think they're going to sell well.

[11:55] I just don't.

[11:56] I don't think there's this much demand for Funhouse in 2024.

[12:00] 3.0 kit, like Rudy's Nightmare, will be some of the best games in the world.

[12:04] What about the next couple of weeks?

[12:06] Are you going to lock your money up there?

[12:08] Some non-refundable thing?

[12:10] And then by the time you realize that they're going to sell for less than MSRP and they're

[12:14] going to sell for less than MSRP because there's no way there's no way 500 Funhouse games at

[12:20] $11,000 are going to hold value.

[12:22] It's just not going to work.

[12:24] And then we got the Pinball Brothers which has been teasing their next game for a really

[12:28] long time.

[12:29] Things like everything they're doing has this stranger things vibe to it and it's going

[12:34] to be ABBA and then it's going to have that helicopter mechanism in it.

[12:37] Again, I love their music.

[12:39] I'm just not sure this is what the pinball buying demographic wants.

[12:43] I know this band is very popular in Europe even more so than in America.

[12:48] They will sell a ton in Sweden.

[12:50] But again, gang, at this much money with all the games that are out there that are great,

[12:56] like there are basically Jurassic Park 30th sitting in a box that you could probably get

[13:01] 2000 off sticker on.

[13:03] Would you rather have Jurassic Park or ABBA?

[13:06] And I'm just saying, would you rather have like the Matrix or Back to the Future or ABBA?

[13:10] And I've been saying this since the beginning of the year because all of us know that Back

[13:14] to the Future is coming.

[13:16] Why wouldn't you just wait until that game comes out?

[13:18] We all think that Matrix is coming next from JJP.

[13:22] Just wait for that.

[13:23] Those are themes you'd rather have.

[13:25] So I don't know.

[13:26] I don't think ABBA is going to be a huge success.

[13:28] We'll see what's in the game.

[13:29] That mechanism does look promising.

[13:32] I'm just curious like who's designing this game from the ground up.

[13:35] We shall see in just a couple of weeks.

[13:37] So that's coming.

[13:39] And then we got John Wick from Stern Pinball and all of my sources.

[13:43] And I've talked to people who have seen this game.

[13:45] All of my sources are telling me that this game is going to be a dud.

[13:49] And I'm almost happy to watch Stern Pinball try to figure out how to move units in a world

[13:53] in which their games are going to never go cheaper in price.

[13:56] Like how are you going to sell John Wick for 13K and make a thousand le's?

[14:01] How are you going to sell $9,500 premiums of a John Wick game?

[14:05] It's not going to work.

[14:06] Like it's just going to be so brutal.

[14:08] What happens middle of this year to some of these pinball companies and these distributors

[14:12] and these manufacturers who need to sell hundreds of products?

[14:17] And so here's where I'm at lately people.

[14:19] I mean I got to buy a house.

[14:21] I have other expenses.

[14:22] I've had a really good few months at work.

[14:24] I've made some good money and I don't want to buy any of this stuff.

[14:28] I'm basically pausing like never before.

[14:30] As much as I enjoy Elton John, I'm also not going to jump in on an Elton John for $15,000.

[14:37] Sure it's a beautiful game.

[14:38] Sure it's great.

[14:39] And it's always going to be a great, beautiful shooting game.

[14:41] I just don't need to own it right now.

[14:44] Because if Matrix is around the corner, I would much rather own a Matrix machine than

[14:49] an Elton John machine.

[14:50] And I think Jersey Jack needs to put more into the games.

[14:53] As much as I love Elton John and I do love Elton John game, I still think it's a total

[14:58] ripoff for $12,000 to $15,000.

[15:01] I mean it is basically Star Trek wearing Jersey Jack clothing.

[15:05] And you lift the hood on an Elton John and we saw the seminar at TPF when they talked

[15:10] about making the piano mechanism and there's like kids in China making it or whatever they

[15:14] said.

[15:15] And then the topper is just leftover screens from Toy Story 4.

[15:19] I mean hello, Steve Richie never should have said that.

[15:22] They've got to media train these people.

[15:23] I don't want to feel like the parts for this game are just leftover parts from that game.

[15:29] That's not a key message brother.

[15:31] That's not what you want to say.

[15:32] And then I look at that topper on the CE and it doesn't make any sense.

[15:35] It's just playing random clips.

[15:37] Like they're not even synced up with the songs that he's singing in the game.

[15:41] And look it's beautiful but so is the Matrix.

[15:44] Harry Potter is going to be beautiful.

[15:46] People don't forget.

[15:47] Jersey Jack games are always beautiful.

[15:50] They're always pretty.

[15:51] They're always heavy as can be.

[15:53] But I want a Jersey Jack game with just more in it.

[15:56] It will always be easy to go get an Elton John.

[15:59] They're always going to be available.

[16:01] You know it's funny.

[16:02] There's a lot of honeymoon period going on with the new owners.

[16:04] I saw this one new owner go.

[16:06] These CEs are going to sell out instantly.

[16:09] Instantly.

[16:10] Well they already have not.

[16:11] And he's like they're going to be worth $20,000 one day.

[16:15] This is what someone is saying on pin site.

[16:17] They're going to sell out and then they're going to be worth $20,000.

[16:20] And I'm here to tell this person right now.

[16:22] If they make a thousand Elton John CEs they will never be worth $20,000.

[16:28] They won't even be worth over $15,000 ever.

[16:32] It's just not that kind of market anymore.

[16:35] And no game moves like that anymore.

[16:38] Especially a game that didn't have much demand when it came out.

[16:41] People forget pirates had huge demand when it was revealed.

[16:45] When pirate order banks opened up we all ordered one.

[16:48] Then there was like a year delay and then they only made a thousand of them.

[16:52] In total.

[16:53] The only reason pirate CE is worth so much money there's only $200,000.

[16:58] There will always be $800 more Elton John CEs in the world than pirates of the Caribbean.

[17:05] Not to mention gang.

[17:07] Pirates of the Caribbean is packed.

[17:09] There's so much in that game.

[17:11] And as much as I love the way Elton John shoots you have to admit there's nothing really

[17:16] in it.

[17:17] Like there's not a lot of mechs in that game.

[17:18] So it's a beautiful shooting game.

[17:20] It's a lot of fun.

[17:21] But man it's like the best $10,000 game Jersey Jack ever made.

[17:25] And I just can't see myself writing a check for $15,000 or $12,000 for one.

[17:31] And we all know Matrix is next.

[17:32] Like it's going to be Matrix.

[17:34] If it's not Matrix it's going to be Muppets.

[17:37] But it's going to be one of those two games.

[17:39] And I would just rather wait to see what happens.

[17:41] Because trust me you're never going to have to pay over $12,000 or $15,000 to get an Elton

[17:47] John ever.

[17:48] Remember when people were trying to lie to us like Jurassic Park 30th was going to be

[17:52] an instant sell out?

[17:53] Elvira, Black and White Edition.

[17:56] None of those games are hard to get.

[17:58] None of them went up in value.

[17:59] So trust me just wait it out and you'll be able to get whatever you want.

[18:04] And for me it's all about Alice in Wonderland, Back to the Future and the Matrix.

[18:09] Those are the three that I really want to see this year.

[18:12] Those are the three that I need to make sure are good before I buy them.

[18:15] And I think out of those obviously my order of preference would go Back to the Future,

[18:20] the Matrix and then Alice in Wonderland.

[18:22] If there was one that I could see I don't get it's easily Alice in Wonderland.

[18:26] Because there's so many question marks on this game.

[18:29] And again it's not like a dream theme of mine.

[18:32] It would just be cool to own a rare beautiful work of art game if they can do it right.

[18:37] And I have not seen yet that they can absolutely do it right.

[18:40] So I'm not telling you to order one today but it's going to happen.

[18:44] I've seen photos of it.

[18:45] It is coming.

[18:46] But is it going to be better than Back to the Future?

[18:48] I don't think so.

[18:49] Is it going to be better than the Matrix?

[18:51] I don't think so.

[18:52] A lot's coming around the corner.

[18:54] But we need a big hit.

[18:56] And that's my thing about all of this going on in Pinball right now.

[18:59] We need a big hit.

[19:00] We haven't had a big big hit since Godzilla.

[19:04] Everything has really been the next Godzilla.

[19:07] It's not Jaws.

[19:08] It's not Elton John.

[19:10] It's not Looney Tunes.

[19:12] It's not Texas Chainsaw.

[19:13] It's not Pulp Fiction.

[19:15] This hobby needs a hit.

[19:17] And we haven't had a hit game that is universally loved across the board.

[19:22] It just hasn't happened since Godzilla.

[19:26] And again at these prices this hobby needs one big hit a year to become the center of

[19:32] gravity or else the new and box market is going to be in trouble.

[19:36] It's just the way it's going to be people.

[19:38] Everybody look I'm still recovering from St. Patrick's Day.

[19:40] Have a great week.

[19:41] We're going to be back more this week with more episodes of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[19:45] On my next episode we'll revisit those 80's movie themes and kick off where we left off

[19:52] and see which one of these would make a good Pinball experience.

[19:55] And come on.

[19:56] There are so many of them that are better than freaking Funhouse, Abba and John Wick.

[20:03] We need more hit games.

[20:06] And the greatest way we're going to get these hit games people is keep your money in your

[20:10] wallet.

[20:12] Don't buy unless those hit games come out.

[20:15] And it's going to force these companies to either give us hits or go out of business.

[20:19] There's no middle ground.

[20:20] Well half of them won't go out of business because they're all backed financially by

[20:24] other entities that don't even need the Pinball money.

[20:27] Everybody will talk to you soon later.
