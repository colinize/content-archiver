[00:00] Welcome everybody, happy Friday, it is Canada, this is Canada's Pinball Podcast, the world's

[00:22] favorite pinball podcast, when people actually got a chance to vote.

[00:26] What are we going to talk about today?

[00:27] Well, there's a lot going on in the pinball world, we got Pulp Fiction machines are making

[00:31] their way out into the world, that is exciting.

[00:34] I can't wait for more people to jump on Pulp Fiction and get more reviews of this game,

[00:40] they're sending out both the Black Coin Door Edition and the Silver Coin Door Edition, so

[00:45] that's happening right now.

[00:47] Exciting news from the world over in Spookyland, we are going to get Texas Chainsaw Massacre

[00:53] and Looney Tunes are both starting to ship on Monday, that's great news, some of you

[00:58] are going to have this game for Valentine's Day, that's exciting, most people haven't

[01:03] played these games yet, we're going to see them pretty soon, I'm not sure if any are

[01:07] going to make their way to New York City, it's always like a conundrum, it's like where

[01:11] exactly are we supposed to play these boutique games?

[01:15] I'm in New York City, you'd think every game would find their way through New York City,

[01:20] I still have not been able to play The Godfather, I know people are mad at me, they're like

[01:24] Chris, you're saying Elton John is amazing and you're ragging on Godfather, is it my

[01:30] fault?

[01:31] That a pinball machine based on The Godfather, which is a movie that takes place in New York

[01:35] City, there's nowhere to play one, and you would think Jersey Jack Pinball would basically

[01:41] get a game to New York considering that New Jersey, you're called Jersey Jack, you should

[01:47] have at least set up a game somewhere in New York City to get people on it, get people

[01:52] excited, they've done no such thing, you know I don't know, by the time I get on A Godfather

[01:57] everyone's already talking about Elton John, we've got Stern Pinball and Jaws Pros making

[02:03] their way out the door, and I know there's a lot of conversation happening around the

[02:08] Jaws Code and whether or not Stern is going to fix the code in the game, and what we're

[02:13] hearing from people over at Stern is that they are reworking the way the clips are going

[02:18] to be laid out in the game, so right now the game is a little bit of a mess, right, it's

[02:24] all over the place, it's a little janky, it's kind of like throwing a ton of clips into

[02:29] a blender, but Stern Pinball is going to get this game right, I think by the time this

[02:35] game is done it is going to be a beautiful interpretation of Jaws Pinball, yes there is

[02:42] not the mechanical magic I would love in this game, but it shoots really well and they're

[02:47] going to get the code right, and I think that's going to give a lot of people some confidence

[02:51] in ordering the game, now I still would not order the game right now, and here's why,

[02:56] why would you order a Jaws right now in which the code is not done, and they might be overhauling

[03:02] the code and that's going to take a few months to do, by the time they redo the code in the

[03:07] game and make the game it should be, the game is going to be out for a few months, and if

[03:12] you wait you'll be able to save a lot of money, you'll be able to get an LE for less than

[03:17] $13,000, and I think it's going to be an easy deal to make with distributors who are going

[03:23] to be sitting on a ton of premiums and pros and probably some LEs, I know it sounds like

[03:28] I'm beating a dead horse, but every single game is basically going to go down in value,

[03:33] the entire market is overpriced everywhere you look, and so if you just wait it out you're

[03:38] going to be able to get a Jaws when the code is right for the right price, and I think a

[03:43] lot of people are just starting to do that, you know you don't have to like slam people

[03:47] buying it right now, I understand why some people would buy it right now, because Jaws

[03:51] might be your dream theme, and you might still have some FOMO and you might want to get an

[03:56] LE, and if you have a Jaws LE on order, I don't think you're going to be disappointed, and

[04:02] I don't think you're even going to care if your machine loses like a thousand or two thousand

[04:06] dollars in value, because the peace of mind for people buying it at $13,000 is just simply this,

[04:13] you got one, and you don't have to worry about getting one, there's no anxiety around getting one,

[04:19] now if you're one of those people who bought James Bond LE, and maybe Foo Fighters LE,

[04:24] looking back now, do you wish you would have waited longer to get the game because you could have

[04:29] saved so much money, but look the flip side devil's advocate on that approach, if you waited a year,

[04:35] you would not have had a year enjoying the game, and that's the balance everyone's just

[04:39] got to figure out for yourselves, how much do you want to enjoy today, and how much do you want to

[04:45] enjoy tomorrow, can you wait and be patient and save money, or do you want to jump in the brand

[04:50] new game right now and have some fun, there's a lot of people out there right, two to three thousand

[04:55] dollars doesn't mean anything, and they're willing to take that hit, and they might never want to

[05:00] sell the game, and if you never want to sell a game, you don't care about the resale value,

[05:06] and yes, everybody would love to get something for less money, that's just obvious, I was looking

[05:12] over pin side, and then I saw once again this Haggis pinball thread creeping up towards the top

[05:18] of the pin side thread list, and I started reading up on what's going on, and here's what's going on,

[05:25] there are still people that ordered this game over eight months ago, and I'm talking about

[05:31] Fathom Mermaid editions, over eight months ago, there are still people who paid in fall that

[05:38] don't have their game, and I just want to ask each and every one of you, at what point, and maybe you

[05:43] don't care, and I think most people don't care, but at what point, at what point do we hold Haggis

[05:49] and the Haggis Apologists accountable, right, when do they become accountable? They once again told

[05:55] people they were going to do something, and they were going to get all the Fathom Mermaid editions

[06:00] done by the end of the year, remember when they were taking deposits on Centaur, and I told everybody,

[06:08] don't give a deposit on Centaur, because they're not going to hold true to their word, they're not

[06:14] going to finish Fathoms by the end of the year, they're not going to start shipping Centaurs in

[06:20] January, go back and read what they said, it's not just read what they said, remember they made a video

[06:26] in which when they took your money on Centaur, they said they were going to have Centaur production

[06:32] happen in January, here we are, it's almost mid-February, and has anybody seen any Centaur

[06:40] production going on? And not just that, there's people that have deposit money in on Fathoms,

[06:46] and they're not getting any correspondence, and I'm just going to say this right now, I don't

[06:51] understand why anybody, why is anybody defending Damien and Marty and this company at this point,

[06:59] and I'm just asking them to just get back to your customers, you don't have to get back to

[07:03] Canada, I'm never buying anything these guys ever make, never, I will never support a company like

[07:09] this, I don't think you get to do this, I don't think you get to lock in people's money for years,

[07:15] and then not correspond with the people, why, why would we forgive them of this, like someone could

[07:21] have $8,000 in a savings account that's giving them 3-4% return on their investment, you know,

[07:27] and you could be making a few hundred dollars, or your money could be tied up with Haggis Pimbal,

[07:32] and why are you giving them a loan? Like think about that, when Damien is taking your money,

[07:38] he's promised all of these people you would have your game in 8 weeks, and so you're giving him a

[07:44] loan to keep his company afloat, I bet your money is going to rent, I bet your money is going to

[07:51] vendors, you know where your money is not going, it's not going to your game, and how long can he

[07:57] string everybody along, I think the apologists are just looking real silly, and once again,

[08:03] Damien said something that did not come true, how many times do these guys get to lie to the

[08:08] Pimbal community before people hold them accountable, and here's what I think is happening, I think

[08:13] people are holding them accountable, I don't think people are going to order Centaur, you know, it's

[08:18] one of these like fool me once, fool me twice kind of scenarios, like who's going to invest in this,

[08:23] and now that everybody's witnessing, there's no secondhand market on any of these games,

[08:28] so why would you lock your money in on any of these Centaur remakes, here's what you should do,

[08:33] just let the people that are distributing this game, let them take the risk, let them order the

[08:39] games, don't put the risk on your shoulders, and hey, when the distributors get a game, and it's in

[08:44] a box, and it's in their warehouse, yeah, then order the game, not until then, why would you want

[08:50] to order it now, let the distributor pay for the air freight, and filling up a container, why would

[08:55] you take that cost on, on top of the game, so you're going to lose $1500 in value on an air freight

[09:02] cost, it's absolutely a name, so I think Agus Pimbal is on a short list of companies that I

[09:08] really don't know how they're going to survive 2024, with so much competition, there's just too

[09:14] many companies executing on a much better level, new companies like Barrels of Fun, right, is anyone

[09:20] getting jerked around by Barrels of Fun, are they telling you you got to pay in full for your game,

[09:25] and you're going to have it in eight weeks and eight months go by, no they're not, Spooky Pimbal

[09:30] is not jerking anyone around, there's Elton John's inboxes, you can go get this weekend,

[09:36] Chicago Gaming Company, now that Pulp Fiction is on the line, I fully expect to see a ton of

[09:41] Pulp Fictions out the door over the next six months, there's going to be a lot of Pimbal

[09:46] making its way into the world over the next six months, it's going to get really really interesting

[09:51] to see what happens over the next six months, and it got me thinking like what am I most excited

[09:56] for, if I were to be honest, what am I most looking forward to in the Pimbal world, well I'm

[10:01] going to go from the end of the year to now, like everybody else, I'm so excited for Back to the

[10:07] Future, I can't explain enough how excited we all are that we're going to get a Back to the

[10:13] Future game made by Dutch Pimbal, and it's going to have all of the assets in the game, I mean that

[10:19] is so exciting to each and every one of us, now there's a lot of questions, how much is the game

[10:25] going to cost, how is Dutch Pimbal going to deal with the overwhelming demand they're going to get

[10:31] for this game, right, we know on day one a Dutch Pimbal Back to the Future game would easily get

[10:37] 5,000 orders from this community, even if the price is 13,500 they're going to have 5,000 people

[10:45] who want this game, there's no way they're going to even be able to get close to supplying enough

[10:50] games a week and a month to even get near the high demand for this game, which I think has some people

[10:56] nervous that Dutch might price it really high to try to soften some of that demand and give their

[11:03] manufacturing line a chance at this thing, right, it's still crazy to each and every one of us that

[11:09] Stern Pimbal didn't secure this license, I don't know what magic Roger Sharp worked on this theme,

[11:15] got this game for Dutch Pimbal and Stern didn't lock it down, it's crazy, especially because

[11:20] Joe Kamnikau has such a relationship with Gary, like how did all of this go down, so we've got

[11:27] Back to the Future from Dutch Pimbal, right, are they going to make 88 Super Limited Edition games,

[11:33] how much are those going to cost, right, with all the demand for this game, it feels like you could

[11:38] charge $88,000, so I'm super excited for Back to the Future, that's the thing that has me the most

[11:44] excited. The second game that I am so excited for is the next game from Jersey Jack and I'll

[11:51] explain why, because it's Mark Siden, it's a new designer who's been over at Jersey Jack for like

[11:58] three years now and this is his first game and I do believe this, that when you're a designer and you

[12:04] want to make a name for yourself in the Pimbal world, your first game has to be a hit, you want

[12:10] to put everything into your first game because it's your moment, right, it's your moment to tell

[12:16] everybody out there in the Pimbal world that you belong on the big stage and Mark's been given a

[12:22] great opportunity with a company that's got a lot of money, they've got a beautiful Pimbal package,

[12:28] but they're also a company that's in a strange position right now. Jersey Jack's had two flops

[12:33] in a row and you might even say they've got three potential flops in a row and it's not that Elton

[12:39] John is a bad game, it's just not selling. None of their last games have come anywhere close to selling

[12:46] the amount of games that Guns N' Roses sold within a month and it's obvious why, the themes aren't

[12:51] really clicking with the Pimbal buying community and the price is so high. So Mark Siden's going to

[12:57] come out with the game at an interesting time, is it going to be standard body or wide body, I think

[13:04] it's going to be standard body, what is he going to put into the game, right, is he going to give us

[13:08] a fast game that's pretty empty but with great flow like Elton John or is he going to load it

[13:14] back up, is he going to be something more like dialed in, is he going to find a way to put a lot

[13:19] more toys and mechanical magic into a standard body Jersey Jack game and then the real thing that

[13:25] has everybody excited is the possibility that this is either going to be Harry Potter or The Matrix.

[13:32] Now I'm just going to tell you right now, I did not read the Harry Potter books, I've seen all of

[13:37] the Harry Potter movies but I am not a Harry Potter aficionado, I would much rather it be The

[13:43] Matrix and I hope it's based on the first Matrix movie and I'll explain why. I think it's much

[13:49] easier to take that first Matrix movie and turn it into one of the most incredible theme-integrated

[13:56] Pimbal machines ever made and Jersey Jack with its lighting system and with its ability to use

[14:02] magnets and toys. I could just see the world of Matrix coming to life like never before

[14:08] in a Pimbal experience using like magnets to create bullet time, having a phone booth that you can

[14:15] lock balls inside of, it's right there, the sentinels that you need to destroy, like there's so much

[14:20] opportunity to bring the Matrix world under glass and then just think about all that black and green,

[14:26] the green lights just raining down the machine and making it feel like you're inside the Matrix

[14:32] and I feel like if they can get the assets from that Matrix movie and the music and the callouts,

[14:38] it could just be one of the coolest Pimbal machines of all time and my worry with Harry Potter is I

[14:43] don't think they're gonna have the movie assets, I think it's gonna be more like Wizarding World

[14:48] and it's gonna be inspired by the world of Harry Potter but it's gonna be so hard to translate that

[14:53] into a Pimbal machine that's absolutely gonna be incredible but there's no denying the fact right

[14:59] that Harry Potter is a juggernaut theme and if you love Harry Potter, absolutely you're gonna

[15:04] want to own that pin, it's just not for me so personally Harry Potter is not something that

[15:09] I'm dying to see, I would much rather see Top Gun, I would even rather have Beastie Boys than Harry

[15:15] Potter so that's what's got me excited though is like Mark's game and Back to the Future. Now after

[15:20] those two games, the next on my list is Alice in Wonderland, I'm just gonna say it, Alice in Wonderland,

[15:27] a John Poppity game made by Dutch Pimbal and you know it's gonna have a lot of magnets, you know

[15:33] it's gonna have an upper play field, you know it's gonna have toys, you know it's gonna have the

[15:37] craziest art package of all time and it's also just gonna be super limited like they're not gonna make

[15:41] a lot of these games and I think as a collector and you want to have something unique in your lineup,

[15:47] I think this game is gonna be it and I'm looking at the game right now people, I can tell you right

[15:51] now this game is gonna shoot pretty awesome, it's not gonna be a clunky J-pop Raza design, trust me,

[15:58] I think it's gonna shoot just fine and I think it's gonna shoot more like a Tales of the Arabian

[16:03] Knights and a lot less like a Raza. So that's Alice in Wonderland and the questions around that game

[16:09] are tremendous right, it's like how many are they gonna make, how much is it gonna cost, how are they

[16:14] gonna finish the artwork without Zambietti so a lot of question marks on that game, we know that game

[16:20] is coming out within six months and I'm not even mentioning Stern Pimball, I'm not even mentioning

[16:25] Pulp Fiction which I have to pay for and all of a sudden like I'm sitting down in my chair and

[16:30] realizing well wait Chris you've got too many games you want, you don't have a house yet, you don't

[16:36] have room for all of these things, you're gonna have to make some choices and I think all of us

[16:41] are in the same boat, we're gonna have to make choices right, we're not gonna be able to buy

[16:45] everything we even want, we're not gonna be able to go in on full price on all of these games,

[16:50] because it's probably just too much money to invest in Pimball in one year and if I had to like look

[16:55] at all of it I would just wait for back to the future, I mean it's easy to just wait for back

[17:00] to the future, it's probably not gonna be impossible to get an Alice in Wonderland second hand, you

[17:06] know there's just gonna be a lot of people that don't want that game because they hate J-pop,

[17:10] I get it, that's gonna happen, Pulp Fiction Elise are not gonna be hard to get, we all know this,

[17:14] like once they make a thousand Pulp Fiction Elise I think we're gonna see a lot of them up for sale

[17:20] at any given time, there's always gonna be like eight to ten of them for sale and yeah you might

[17:24] have to spend a thousand or two thousand dollars more to get one but they're not gonna be hard to

[17:28] get, but back to the future to me feels like a game that when people get it they're never gonna

[17:34] let it go, it's just that kind of theme, I feel like the Matrix is the same way, if they nail

[17:41] Matrix that collectors edition of a Jersey Jack Matrix they will sell out of a thousand of them

[17:48] at fifteen thousand dollars a pop instantly, so it might be a year in which we might have to get

[17:54] back into the good graces of our distributor friends to make sure they can grab us one of these

[18:00] in-demand games, but we're all gonna have to make choices right, we're all gonna have to make choices

[18:06] because for a lot of you out there you don't have any room, for a lot of you out there you need to

[18:12] sell a game to get a new game, if the second hand market is gonna just destroy you, you know you're

[18:17] not gonna be very happy and it might not free up capital for some of these newer games, but here's

[18:22] the good news, here's the good news, the second hand market on almost every single game that came out

[18:28] before 2019 is really strong still, you're still gonna make money on those games because you got

[18:35] those games for the right price, the only people getting destroyed are the newbies who came into

[18:42] pinball during covid and bought all the new stuff, if you're one of those people you're just gonna

[18:48] get destroyed on the second hand value, but for most of us out there you got your games at a different

[18:55] time, you didn't spend that much money on them and almost none of them has lost that much value,

[19:01] so you're not really feeling the pain, it just feels like in the world of pinball today if you

[19:06] go in on everything new that's where the pain lies, like that's when you're gonna get absolutely

[19:13] hosed, I think it's gonna be a really interesting year, I'm really happy to sort of wait and see

[19:18] what happens next, I think there's a lot of pressure on companies like Haggis to survive,

[19:23] there's pressure on companies like American Pinball to survive and Multimorphic, I think what

[19:28] we're gonna see in 2024 is a real division of those that are gonna make it and those that are

[19:33] clearly about to flatline and I don't think there's gonna be any in between, you either have a hit

[19:38] game that people want, there's no longer gonna be the ability to just slowly survive, I think those

[19:44] days are gonna be over, I could easily see us thinning out the amount of companies making pinball

[19:50] in 2024, I would not be surprised if three to four pinball companies closed their doors this year

[19:57] and it's not that I'm rooting for them to close their doors, remember all of these companies

[20:01] have been making their own decisions, if a pinball company has to close its doors,

[20:06] it's because it made bad decisions, they brought stuff into the market people didn't want, you

[20:12] know unless you've got a billionaire backer, unless you've got another company floating your

[20:16] operation and some of them do, everybody else is in big trouble if they're a boutique company that

[20:22] needs sales, it's gonna be quite the year to watch how everything unfolds, everybody have a great

[20:28] Friday, we'll be back tomorrow with our Saturday morning spectacular, let me know what you think

[20:33] about this episode, let me know in the comments section, what's the one game that you're really

[20:38] waiting to get in 2024 and let's just compare notes and have some fun, everybody talk to you soon.
