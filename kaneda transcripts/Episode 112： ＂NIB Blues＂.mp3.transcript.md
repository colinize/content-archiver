[00:00] See the line with the sign to see it calls me

[00:05] And no one goes, a boring girl

[00:18] Welcome to episode 112 of Canadian Pimball Podcast

[00:23] We are midway through April of 2017

[00:26] And it's an exciting time

[00:29] There's a lot going on in Pimball

[00:32] A lot of machines that are on the horizon

[00:35] I know a lot of you guys are in the same boat that I'm in

[00:38] And not knowing exactly where you want to apply your dollars

[00:42] Do any of you feel like that?

[00:44] You want to buy something but you're not quite sure which direction to go in

[00:48] There's all these titles on the horizon

[00:50] There's all these games of yesteryears that are also great that you could consider

[00:54] There's people getting divorced that are getting rid of their tronds and their walking deads

[00:59] There's always an opportunity to spend your money in Pimball

[01:05] And in the chase, right?

[01:07] That chase of, I'm not quite satiated yet

[01:11] If I get this next thing, I'll be happier and happier

[01:14] We might talk a little bit about that on this episode

[01:17] How our hunger and our desire for a new Pimball to arrive in our homes

[01:23] is never quite satiated and that can kind of mess with your head

[01:28] Can kind of ruin your relationships with other people

[01:31] And can kind of overtake your world

[01:34] But on this episode, we're going to talk about a bunch of things

[01:37] I've been reading Pinside, I've been talking to you a lot of you guys on the side

[01:41] I want to talk a little bit about Wall Street Journal article

[01:45] A lot of people in that thread sort of saying stuff about me

[01:48] I want to clarify some stuff

[01:50] Of course, we have to discuss this Metallica new and box drama that was popping the other day

[01:56] Got a home pin rumor

[01:58] Got some alien things I want to discuss

[02:00] Big Lebowski, Attack from Mars going up for sale

[02:03] And what people are saying in that thread

[02:05] But let's jump right into the first thing which is Star Wars not being at the Star Wars convention

[02:10] And we sort of predicted this, we talked

[02:13] We initially thought they would be there, we talked to JJ

[02:16] He confirmed for us that they were not going to be there

[02:19] And there were no surprises, right? Stern did not show up to the Star Wars convention

[02:23] And what do I think about that?

[02:26] Like do we think that this was a missed opportunity for Stern to get pinball

[02:30] Especially Star Wars pinball that is based on the original trilogy in front of

[02:36] You know, I don't know how many people go to this thing, right?

[02:39] Tens of thousands of people, maybe a couple hundred thousand people, probably a ten this convention over the weekend

[02:45] It was a missed opportunity, I mean the answer is obviously yes, I think it would have been great

[02:51] To put that machine in front of people, especially because a lot of these people

[02:56] And I've said this before, Star Wars collectors are unlike any other collector base out there

[03:02] There are a lot of people that will just collect in item because it's Star Wars

[03:07] And I know people have said like well why don't they buy the old Star Wars games and the answer I think is

[03:13] Well they're not that good, they're not that good and they don't do a great job of putting you into the Star Wars universe

[03:20] The way the new pins will with the LCD and just the modern aspect of these games

[03:26] I don't know about you guys but when we first hear the Star Wars theme song playing through the Stern spike system with the great audio

[03:34] I think it's going to be a game changer

[03:37] I think that moment is what we're all sort of giddy about and waiting for

[03:41] So even though they weren't at the fan convention, I think we all are looking towards May 4th as the day we will hopefully get something

[03:50] But I don't think you're going to see the full game reveal on May 4th

[03:53] I think you're still just going to get a Game of Thrones like teaser

[03:57] You know something that sort of has a pinball rolling around

[04:01] I would assume they're going to do something where pinball is fired towards the Death Star

[04:05] Like something along those lines to sort of just announce that it's coming and it's coming soon

[04:10] I did talk to someone who played Star Wars

[04:13] Yeah, I did and I can't say too much

[04:17] I can't say too much

[04:19] Obviously they are internal and working on stuff with Stern

[04:24] And they said that the game is really fun

[04:26] And they said that Star Wars fans are going to be really happy

[04:29] And they said the package that they've seen is really nice

[04:33] I mean what did I expect in this day right?

[04:35] I hate that it was garbage and there was no flow

[04:37] It looked like crap but I'll take whatever I can get

[04:42] I know everyone is hungry for some Star Wars news

[04:44] So more to come on Star Wars but I think we're going to get there

[04:47] I think we're going to get there in a couple weeks

[04:49] So there was a Wall Street Journal article

[04:53] And I want to clarify something

[04:54] And I've talked about this on the show

[04:56] But even though I talk about it, it seems that people somehow don't believe me or people want to make up

[05:01] Their own assumptions about some of these things

[05:05] So let me clarify for the record exactly what's happened with these two media stories that covered Magic Girl and John Papaduke

[05:15] The Wall Street Journal article that you guys saw this weekend that was about Magic Girl

[05:23] It interviewed me, it interviewed Justin Kelly, it interviewed American Pimball

[05:29] Nate Schivers was even in it, right?

[05:32] That story was not set up by me

[05:35] I had nothing to do with it

[05:37] It was set up by American Pimball

[05:40] American Pimball decided to tell their story and announce their plans for Houdini

[05:48] And they were getting a story with the Wall Street Journal

[05:51] So right there, like all of you guys out there who said

[05:56] This is just Canada, the PR hack

[05:59] He wrote this story and gave it to the Wall Street Journal to print

[06:04] I think those individuals really should lose credibility with a lot of you guys

[06:09] And I'm looking right at Vid 1900

[06:11] I mean if you read what he said

[06:13] His assumptions that that's what happened that I wrote the article

[06:18] This is the Wall Street Journal

[06:21] Call them out as being fake news and not doing adequate reporting

[06:26] I think is really irresponsible and should be shunned upon

[06:30] Because I think that type of accusation does nothing to make people smarter

[06:37] To further the conversation that people are having around this topic

[06:42] And also it just makes everyone dumber

[06:44] When you say something like that as idiotic as canada, a PR guy

[06:49] That I would have written that article and just submitted it and they would print it

[06:54] I just think of alunacy when it comes to how some people look at the news that that's out there

[07:04] And so I didn't write it, I was interviewed by Patrick

[07:07] But I want to tell you guys what happened

[07:09] I want to tell you what happened and what I think I think the Wall Street Journal story was actually a really bad idea

[07:15] By American Pimball if what their goal was

[07:19] And I know what their goal was, their goal was to say American Pimball has arrived

[07:24] Look what we've done, we've made magic girl happen, that's a miracle

[07:29] And our next game is Houdini

[07:31] See the goal of that story was to get people excited about Houdini

[07:36] Now obviously that's not what the story is about

[07:40] And even though before talking to the Wall Street Journal

[07:43] I had spoken to individuals in American Pimball and they wanted me to talk about American Pimball

[07:49] And I did, I talked to Patrick, the reporter

[07:53] And I spun as much as I could information about American Pimball and how really is amazing that they did get magic girls out

[08:00] And I do believe that

[08:01] But I also think that what you don't ever want to connect to magic girl anymore

[08:10] If you're American Pimball there is no way a reporter or anyone doing their due diligence is going to look at you shipping magic girl as a celebratory moment

[08:21] They will never look at it like that

[08:23] They will also not look at magic girl and think

[08:27] Wow we really can't wait to see what's next from American Pimball

[08:31] Simply because the magic girl you shipped didn't work

[08:36] And as much as I'm friends with individuals at American Pimball again I think you guys listen to this show because I tell it like it is

[08:44] I don't hold back, right?

[08:47] I don't hold back but I'm not going to be mean and nasty anymore

[08:50] I think a lot of you guys too have liked the new direction of how we discussed these things

[08:55] So the thing is this

[08:57] If you ship magic girl in its current state

[09:00] And then you want to take credit for it

[09:03] And the current state of the game is inoperable in a lot of ways

[09:07] People are not going to think you guys know how to build a Pimball machine

[09:12] So somebody at American Pimball decided that that game was good enough to go to customers

[09:19] So whoever decided that really doesn't know much about Pimball

[09:25] Whoever removed the rails from the levitation chamber on the American Pimball version of the play field

[09:33] Whoever made that decision didn't know what needed to happen

[09:37] I'm still confused by a lot of the decisions that were made in the final game and who made those decisions

[09:45] I do feel as if John was not in total control but the people who had the reins also had no clue

[09:54] Had to really create a Pimball machine that was fully working

[09:59] And that's what happened

[10:02] That's what happened

[10:03] So it is not a time for you to then go to the press and try to get a story about American Pimball and Houdini

[10:11] And people were saying this too, you know the pictures of me holding up the magic girl topper with Bubba in the room

[10:17] Look how happy I look

[10:19] The picture of a Doble next to Houdini, not the most flattering photo or image of the company that you want out there

[10:26] So I think a lot of it was bad timing

[10:30] And I think it's also way too early for American Pimball to be trying to place a story like this

[10:37] Because there's a lot of time that we have to cross between Houdini and Houdini is available

[10:46] It's not like you invited the Wall Street Journal reporter into American Pimball to see the operations, to play Houdini

[10:54] And really talk about how Pimball is back

[10:57] I think you could get that story

[10:59] We're sort of in this new era of made in America

[11:02] Bringing jobs back to America, American innovation, American inventions

[11:07] Even though I think Pimball is invented in France, right?

[11:10] But you know what I'm saying? It's like that story would have been a much more positive story to tell

[11:15] And you don't get two chances to do this, right?

[11:18] I mean the Wall Street Journal gives you one shot to sort of tell the story you want to tell

[11:23] And there's no way you're going to be able to tell American Pimball's story using Magic Girl as the jumping off point to get to anything positive

[11:31] Now the story I did set up is the popular science story

[11:35] And I think if you read the popular science story, again you won't come away thinking this is the Chris Chloris story

[11:41] I thought the popular science story was very fair, was very accurate

[11:46] And the way that story was set up is I pitched that story to a friend of mine who works at popular science

[11:53] But he said he's like, look, I think this is an interesting tale Chris, I'm not going to cover it

[11:58] I have to recuse myself from writing this for journalistic integrity

[12:04] And he gave it to reporter who, you know, they interviewed me guys

[12:07] They videotaped me for about two hours talking about Magic Girl

[12:11] They used to none of that in this story

[12:13] They went off and they interviewed John and they got, and obviously the guy on Pop-Sci

[12:19] Read through all the threads on Pinside to get his story together

[12:24] And I think that story is actually a more in-depth exploration of the Magic Girl tale

[12:31] But also remember this, and this is something vid and a lot of you guys just don't get

[12:36] Pinside is not the target for the Wall Street Journal

[12:41] The Wall Street Journal is writing this for a broad audience

[12:44] They're writing it for people that have no idea that there's probably even new-in-box pinball machines

[12:51] They have no idea that pinball is even a category that has all these different companies in it

[12:58] And to those people, Magic Girl, they've never heard of it

[13:01] So for an introduction into Magic Girl and this sort of pinball machine that...

[13:08] This is all they were saying, pinball machine created by pinball-like designer

[13:12] Who's kind of a mad genius, a stumbles coming out

[13:15] That's really the truth

[13:18] I know you would have liked them to be like class action lawsuit and raked John over the calls

[13:23] They're not going to do that

[13:25] This is not like investigative reporting into whether or not Chemical Warfare was used in Syria

[13:31] This is a little bit of a fluff piece that's a weekend edition story about pinball

[13:38] So I think you have to look at it in that context

[13:41] Alright, let's move on, but just know this

[13:44] I think people should be ashamed of the people who say those things that are really incorrect

[13:51] And damaging to my character, I can't defend myself on pinside

[13:54] But there are people on there who have

[13:56] And I want to thank those people, I want to thank you, a rare hero

[13:59] My one-time arch nemesis, he came to my defense in that thread

[14:05] That was really fair and I really appreciate that

[14:08] Because again, Robin won't let me back on to defend myself

[14:11] But I take so many arrows, but I don't over react anymore

[14:14] Alright, let's talk about Metallica new-in-box issues

[14:17] So this story happens all the time, right?

[14:21] It's a classic tale, like boy gets game, game arrives broken, boy doesn't contact distributor, boy cries on pinside first

[14:34] And then wonders why distributor and manufacturer are in bending over backwards to help out, right?

[14:42] So it may be it wasn't that dramatic, but we always see this happen

[14:45] And let me give you guys who haven't heard about this story, just the top line of what occurred

[14:52] A man ordered a new-in-box Metallica premium, it arrives

[14:57] I think it's his first pin, he pays $7,000 for it

[15:01] And when it arrives, he looks over the box, everything looks okay, he signs for it, right?

[15:07] He pulls the game out and he, at first he doesn't notice anything wrong

[15:13] Then he notices where the legs go in, it's clear that Stern drilled the holes in the wrong position

[15:19] And bondoed over that area to cover it up

[15:24] And then he also notices some scratches on the front of the cabinet that did not align with any damage to the box

[15:31] Which means those scratches must have occurred at Stern and not in shipping

[15:36] So what does he do?

[15:39] What does he do?

[15:40] He notices this, at 8 o'clock at night he contacts his distributor and tells him of what he's saying

[15:48] Now does he allow his distributor and Stern to respond to him?

[15:53] No, he doesn't, and his name is Green Marine

[15:57] He goes on the pin side and starts a threat about it

[16:01] And his first line is, I need some guidance

[16:05] Here's the thing, I want to tackle this from a few angles

[16:10] The first one is, do I think that he should have gotten that game in that condition from Stern

[16:16] And the answer is absolutely not, absolutely not

[16:21] Nobody should ever get a new product that clearly has a manufacturing defect that's been covered up

[16:30] You wouldn't accept it in anything you bought new

[16:34] When we buy anything new we expect it to be perfect

[16:37] Now what happened in this thread was there was a bunch of monkeys who were jumping into this thread

[16:43] They were being like, you know, just enjoy the game

[16:46] If you expect a pinball machine to arrive perfect like you're fooling yourself

[16:51] You're just a newbie sort of like slandering this guy and accusing him of just being a neo fight

[16:59] And a newbie to the hobby and this is part of pinball and you need to accept it

[17:03] And I think look, all those people who say stuff like that, like just flip it and have fun, don't worry about it

[17:09] Those people are morons, they're idiots and they're hypocrites

[17:14] If anybody got anything new in that condition they would be upset

[17:19] I don't care if it's your most seasoned veteran, your old cramudge and pinball guy who used to be an operator

[17:27] $7,000 these machines are

[17:30] People have high expectations, people deserve to get things in great condition

[17:37] And look, it's just a few of these wanksters who are saying that stuff

[17:42] The majority of people are smart, have common sense, you've got to be out of your mind

[17:48] Stern needs to make this right

[17:50] Now, the other part I want to talk about is, which I think is the original poster's mistake

[17:57] Is why are you going on pinside?

[18:00] Why are you running to the forum for guidance when you've already done what you need it to do?

[18:06] Which is contact your distributor

[18:08] If distributor, by the way, happens to be one of the greatest distributors out there who we just talked to

[18:14] And that's JJ from Game Exchange

[18:16] JJ comes into the thread because what's happening too, right?

[18:20] Is people are like, well, who's your distributor?

[18:23] Your distributor's not helping you out

[18:25] All of the sudden, the angry mob, right, is like their matted stern

[18:29] Now, they're matted at the distributor

[18:31] And this guy hasn't given Stern or the distributor a chance to respond

[18:36] And now they've got a mob on pinside waiting for answers

[18:40] And they're basically arguing, tell us who the distributor is

[18:44] They want to out the distributor so they can say that distributor is not good

[18:48] And then JJ, who we all know and love, comes in and says, wait a minute

[18:52] I just got an email from this guy at 8 o'clock at night

[18:56] And I'm reaching out to Stern and we're going to come up with a fix

[19:01] But this notion that you need to run the pinside

[19:06] And sort of why?

[19:09] We know why people do it

[19:11] We see it all the time

[19:12] My favorite is the guys who always do it when they get their game new on a Friday

[19:15] And they lose their shit on a Saturday or Sunday

[19:19] Because they find something wrong with their new inbox game

[19:22] And instead of waiting to Monday morning to talk to the distributor or Stern

[19:27] They go on a pinside and they lose their shit over the weekend

[19:30] Because they're like grown men who I really do feel like act like impatient babies

[19:36] When their new toy has an issue

[19:39] I understand their frustration, I understand that they're looking for one thing

[19:44] They're looking for solace

[19:46] They're looking for sympathy, camaraderie from the community

[19:52] And the more they get people to be like, don't worry about it

[19:55] Your distributor would take care of it

[19:57] Like the more people who post that the better it makes them feel

[20:00] But again, it's a two-sided coin here

[20:04] Because this always creates that angry mom

[20:07] It never gives Stern a chance to actually fix the problem

[20:12] Before they're already publicly declared guilty

[20:16] And for those of you out there who think that any product arrives without issues

[20:22] Are fooling themselves

[20:24] I go on to car forms and guys who buy brand new $70,000 cars

[20:29] Drive them and realize that, oh my, my hood doesn't align properly

[20:34] Or there's a defect in the paint

[20:36] Or the supercharger blows up after 500 miles

[20:39] All these different things occur on products far more expensive than pinball machines

[20:44] And so it happens, like shit happens

[20:48] And there's also people debating about restocking fees

[20:52] And how it should be free for people to return games

[20:55] And that's also idiotic

[20:57] So ultimately, I think what this Stern does is it was an invitation for Stern Bashers to come back in

[21:04] And make their case

[21:06] And then there's also like this Stern apologist who defense Stern no matter what happens

[21:12] So that's the problem I love Stern but I would never come in there and say that this guy should just deal with it and play the game

[21:19] I think most of us, most of us are not this like extreme Stern apologists that just says

[21:25] Get over all the Stern issues and play and have fun

[21:27] And most of us aren't sort of like I want a new game because my decal is scratched

[21:33] Most of us are somewhere in the middle where we understand that things could happen

[21:38] And we're willing to give Stern a chance to correct the issue

[21:41] So look, I think this thread is something that we see every few weeks

[21:46] And I think people know better by now

[21:50] And this guy, he's clearly on pinside

[21:53] He clearly knew what it steps to take

[21:57] And he clearly just wanted some attention to his issue

[22:01] Maybe hoping that that attention would get Stern's attention

[22:05] I think that's why people do it

[22:07] I think they really know that Stern does read the forums

[22:10] And if I push and I complain on a public forum

[22:14] I will get their attention

[22:16] But the problem is you're going to get their attention

[22:18] But they're not going to be happy you didn't give

[22:21] They're customer service channels a chance to operate during normal business hours

[22:27] I really don't think that makes them happy

[22:29] And we saw the biggest culprit of that of all time was KPG with his ghost buster issues

[22:36] And ultimately Stern didn't help him out in a timely manner

[22:41] And Stern just gave him a new play field

[22:43] They didn't buy back his game

[22:45] And I kind of feel like KPG got what he deserved

[22:48] His public slander and his crusade against Stern

[22:52] Even after Gary Stern gave him his personal phone number and said he'd take care of him

[22:56] Just showed that some of these guys, they're impatient

[23:01] They're cranky

[23:03] And they can't just tune it out for a few days and wait for a resolve

[23:09] And again, I think it indicates that for a lot of these guys

[23:13] Pinball is the center of their world

[23:16] Even though they would like to think it's not

[23:18] And if there's any pinball issue they just can't sleep into its resolve

[23:21] So I think JJ and Stern will figure out a fix for this guy

[23:25] I think they'll probably give him probably new decals

[23:29] I don't think the holes drilled incorrectly and filled in that are covered up by the legs when they're on

[23:36] Like if the legs are on you can't see anything

[23:38] I mean I can't see them replacing a full game because of that

[23:41] But they might, we'll follow and see what the resolution is

[23:44] Alright, let's keep going

[23:46] Dialed in!

[23:48] An email has been going around from a distributor that is basically telling people we're getting close

[23:55] We're getting close to dialed in and that in May

[23:59] Or like they've already started to retool the assembly line for dialed in

[24:04] And it's looking like dialed in will be on the line in May and out in June

[24:12] So that's coming up real fast

[24:14] We have not been asked to pay any more money for dialed in

[24:19] The deposits will be asked for when your game is 30 to 60 days out

[24:26] I don't know that 60 day out seems kind of long to me if I am asked to pay the remainder of a dialed in a collector's edition

[24:35] I don't want to then have to wait two months to get it

[24:38] Because we all know that when a game goes on the line it's only on the line for like a day or two before it's finished

[24:46] So not sure why we would need a two month wait for that

[24:50] Also just curious to see what the collector's edition looks like

[24:53] We haven't been shown that yet

[24:55] I think it's time to reveal that

[24:58] I mean Stern showed you what the Super Ali looked like right away

[25:01] I'm Batman when they reveal the games I think dialed in

[25:04] Has sort of shown us the LE but the Super Ali remains ambiguous

[25:11] So Jack if you're listening show the people who are spending 12,500 bucks what they're getting

[25:18] Don't just show us a plate of food and be like here's your lunch with Pat Lawler

[25:23] It's a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

[25:25] Alright

[25:27] So there's news from China

[25:29] I was hearing a rumor and I'm going to tell you what I heard and I don't know if it's true

[25:33] But I reached out to Mike and he never got back to me so this is what I do on this show now

[25:38] If I hear a rumor about a manufacturer and I reach out to you and say any word any comment and you don't respond

[25:45] I will simply air the rumor but I'm going to give these manufacturers the benefit of the doubt

[25:52] I've asked Andrew to clarify some things he won't talk to me

[25:55] I'm never going to get any communication from highway but I reached out to Mike at home pin

[26:00] I'm hearing that and this is even from the thread that there are 20 thunderbirds almost ready to go out on location

[26:09] And that's really exciting because all we've seen so far are parts being manufactured for this game

[26:16] And he's manufacturing every single part that goes in the game

[26:20] And his goal is to completely not have to rely on any vendors for parts

[26:26] Get the price down, have it manufactured in China and be a real competitor to the likes of Stern

[26:32] And because he's manufacturing so many of the parts

[26:35] Game 1 will obviously take the longest but once he gets going there he can easily ramp up additional games

[26:41] So here's the rumor though that's really interesting

[26:44] I'm hearing that home pins thunderbirds is going to come out at $4100

[26:51] I don't know if I believe that $4100 for a pinball machine

[26:57] Do you guys believe that?

[26:59] Do you think that's even possible knowing what it costs to make pinball machines in the states

[27:05] Has Mike found the Achilles heel of other manufacturers when it comes to manufacturing costs

[27:11] And can he make a machine that cheap?

[27:14] And will it be any good?

[27:16] These are all questions that I have that I know you have

[27:20] Will thunderbirds be fully featured?

[27:22] Will the artwork be any good?

[27:24] Because I think he's going to get one chance

[27:27] We know he has that really freaking cool lighted decals that go on the back box and the cabinet

[27:32] Like the lightning bolts light up

[27:34] I think that's going to be definitely a game changer

[27:37] And something that other manufacturers are going to want to implement into their games

[27:41] If Mike doesn't have a patent on that I would be surprised if he doesn't

[27:45] But we know that he's bringing some interesting new things to pinball

[27:49] So there's not much else we know

[27:52] There's not much else we know

[27:54] I think we're going to see home pins a inaugural title soon

[28:00] And if it comes out at $4000 in the current marketplace

[28:04] It's going to do well

[28:06] I mean there's just no denying it

[28:08] Like that is half the price of where the current market is sort of going with machines

[28:14] With these LE's

[28:16] But if it's going against the pro

[28:18] Yeah it's even cheap

[28:19] It's $1,000 cheaper than an Aerosmith pro

[28:22] The thing is this

[28:24] The part that I'm just always like

[28:27] Yeah but I know we buy lots of goods made in China

[28:31] But a pinball machine coming all the way from China makes me a little bit nervous

[28:36] It's not like shipping an iPhone from China

[28:40] There's just a big piece of machinery where a lock and happen when it has to move great distances

[28:46] So I'm not sure what people's sort of enthusiasm will be to get a machine coming all the way from China

[28:54] I also don't know what their US which is the biggest pinball market in the world

[28:58] What their US distribution channel is

[29:01] And what their customer service will be knowing that he is located halfway across the world like that

[29:08] So more to come I hope they get Mike on the show

[29:11] I know he's hours are all over the place

[29:13] But hopefully we can get him on this show to talk more about home pin when he's ready to talk

[29:18] All right so Alien Pinball

[29:21] We are closing in on Alien Day

[29:24] It is April 26th

[29:27] That is the day

[29:29] That is the first date that Andrew threw out there as one of two possible dates by which he feels he will be able to show the Alien Ellie artwork

[29:39] Right that mysterious this better be the best freaking artwork ever

[29:43] I mean part of me is like when they show it and it's just like

[29:47] Okay you know like it's just a bunch of like assets that are photoshop dragged and dropped on to the game

[29:55] I don't know how it's ever going to live up to the hype

[29:58] I kind of feel bad I almost feel like somewhat responsible that I've been harping on this and the hype for the Alien Ellie artwork like better be worth it

[30:06] But we'll see

[30:08] So those are the two dates, April 26th and then May 19th

[30:12] And those dates are like three weeks apart

[30:15] So we'll see I'm still betting that we're not going to see anything April 26th

[30:21] I have my standing bet that I will pay $100 to the first person who gets their Alien Ellie pinball machine if they get it before Alien Covenant comes out

[30:32] I think look if you were to tell someone back in August when Andrew said you would definitely have your Alien launch party is happening by Thanksgiving

[30:42] If you were to tell someone canada has just made a bet Andrew that he bets $100 at the Alien Ellie won't be out by May 19th

[30:51] If I had said that then you guys would have called me insane and now how good is that bet look

[30:58] The thing about my canada bets I don't win anything if I get the bet right other than maybe some credibility

[31:05] Maybe that's good enough for me so I've heard from coin taker that they have not gotten those 10 Aliens that they're expecting and they don't know when they're coming

[31:17] So they don't have a date they're expecting them to arrive I don't know if they've gone out yet but they don't seem super confident that they know when they're going to receive those machines

[31:28] Remember when we talked to Brad we talked to Brad when and Brad is the individual in Texas who who took an Alien pinball machine home at T.P.F.

[31:37] And his xenomorph board was not working and Andrew promised him that the board would be available any day now right remember he said like I'm not going to say two weeks and Andrew indicated that it would be less than two weeks to get that xenomorph head

[31:53] Okay this Sunday will mark one month since T.P.F. has been over and Brad has not gotten his xenomorph board yet

[32:05] So there we go still delays they're not ready if the if the 10 games coming over from coin taker had final xenomorph boards in them

[32:18] Then what in Brad have been mailed his board by now that's just a question that comes to my head so I still think they're developing it

[32:28] I was reading in the Alien thread that the people who are coding the game the US team that is coding the game

[32:37] I don't even know if everyone working on the game in the US has got in their game right so that like the sound guy hasn't the sound guy hasn't got in the game

[32:47] But customers have and there needs to be changes made to the code and to the sound and tweaks that how does everyone on the US team of alien not get their game first

[32:58] And again my my my theories my theory remains the same as a customer is getting it so they can say how great it is to get more money to come in the door

[33:08] Because Andrew needs that more than he needs to finish the game and I think I think again I think things are tight I think it's it's gonna be interesting to see if they can hit these alien dates

[33:18] But production hasn't begun and we're halfway through April so look he knows he needs to get it on the line and we'll see what happens

[33:26] We'll see what happens we're gonna stay on this one but you know little updates I'll give you like Brad didn't get his xenomorph board when he was told by Andrew he would have it any day

[33:35] All right let's let's talk about big Lebowski so are we gonna get news this week about the big Lebowski I don't know I reached out to Barry and I said Barry I will happily happily report back anything you tell me is going on instead of speculating on my podcast I didn't hear back from him

[33:58] It doesn't mean I'm gonna go in some crazy speculative rant about the big Lebowski I hear the ARA meeting is next week so I assume we're all here from them by Friday that they have a meeting on the book for next next week to talk about a resolution

[34:15] Again I don't know why this thing's taken so long why does it take two weeks like what what you know here's here's my confusion about this whole thing

[34:24] If I go into a client meeting and and we're trying to figure something out nice okay you know we said we make the games for this much money this is how you said you make it for this much this is how much

[34:38] Dutch the games are actually making like so you these two sides talk for two hours they said a meeting went well why would it take two weeks like why would it take that long

[34:49] to come back with with something I don't get it like it can't be that much work didn't we figure out a solve to getting the astronauts home on Apollo 13 in just a matter of hours with like materials made you know like with like a pencil sharpener and a coke can and a you know I'm saying like if you're if you're smart and you're dedicated to a resolution on this thing

[35:18] I just think it should take much less time to accomplish this I just don't understand two weeks then they're going to meet and if this meeting happens and there's not like a deal signed I think people are going to start to lose their faith their confidence and their shit all at the same time

[35:39] I just I just can't believe it's April of 2017 and we've only shipped like 50 La Bouskies I mean Stern makes that many games in like a day so tell us once again you know bearing not man again I go back to like all the shit talking they did about Stern and how many arrows

[36:01] Smith have shipped to date how many do you think way more than 50 way more than 50 and all this hoopla all this like all this like attention these guys wanted for their company and they're really not delivering and I think they need to move faster than they're moving that that's my advice is get on this shit guys like two weeks to just whatever you need to do do it and if you need to be honest if you need more money from people if you need to raise the price of each game to pay our a ray and that's it then do that and move on

[36:31] put this behind you and get Greg is freaking game alright alright what else real quick rumor that Leonard Skinner might be the next turn pinball machine if that happens I will quit doing this podcast that's it I'm serious that's a threat to you Stern if you make a Leonard Skinner pinball machine I'm done I'm out no this is no longer for me I give up this hobby it's pointless I'm out what else attack from Mars have been going up

[37:00] for sale more and more people are trying to sell their attack from Mars is and and which is interesting is the price right we see them all for around like seven seventy five hundred which is exactly the price of a brand new attack from Mars

[37:12] you're you're out of your mind you're out of your mind if you think an original attack from Mars is worth exactly the same price as a brand new one with one of the most amazing pinball

[37:27] toppers of all time with one of the coolest new uses is of display with so much better dots you're out of your mind now I get some of these original ones have mods on them that make them really cool it doesn't matter

[37:42] brand spanking new I love when guys like big D nineteen seventy nine wrote on pin side many people prefer in original especially in nice shape and with great upgrades like this one

[37:57] if I didn't have a nice one I'd be a buyer as I prefer the customizable lighting blackout upgrade screen printed cab strobe and boards on the original

[38:09] well I don't think big D you've seen what the remake looks like because it's freaking stunning it's phenomenal it doesn't need a lot and you can drop a lot of those other mods in

[38:21] but you put an attack from Mars remake with all the new stuff on it next to an old one that's got all the bling and yeah like that you can make it all you can dress an old one up to look really incredible

[38:34] but look people want the new one that's just like the nature of these remakes they're always they're always going to make the originals less desirable not more desirable right that we always see we saw with medieval man is people like

[38:47] oh no original numbers matching a medieval man is still what people will want collectors will want bullshit collectors don't care

[38:56] um you're collectible ceases to be a real collectible once a remake happens let's all be honest are remake is a death sentence to a collectible right it's that's the truth

[39:11] a remake is a death sentence to someone who feels like they have a rare collectible if they remake kingpin if they remake cactus canyon if they remake king

[39:21] if they remake magic girl the collectors will suffer hugely if that happens all right we're going to close out this episode of the

[39:31] Kenyans pinball podcast with a little update of my own I am getting rich of my bedroom arcade I'm not getting rid of it I'm transforming it to to be more pinball focused

[39:46] I I woke up and Brenda and I are doing a renovation in this apartment we're redoing the kitchen we're redoing the floors and when you start to do these things it's like

[39:56] well first of all like your budget just like starts to spiral a little bit out of control with any home renovation because you think you're just doing the cabinets and the refrigerator and the dishwash and then all of a sudden like well if you need new floors you might as well put them in now so that's like another cause and then I'm like all right well if I'm going to do the floors in the living room I might as well do them in the bedroom

[40:15] because so they all match right so it's just like one thing after another after another part of me is like wow this is what it feels like to be an adult and actually spend money on things that adults are supposed to save up for

[40:28] versus limited edition pinball machines right because when you when you're pinball fanatic like all of us you sort of you you weigh everything in in terms of what pinball I could get if I didn't spend that like if the

[40:42] kitchen renovation is there's 20 grand oh man I could have got to dialed in and a star wars like you can't think like that like I got to step out of my my pinball

[40:52] boy shoes and into my like grown up man shoes and and and and give Brenda the renovation she deserves because she's been a trooper she's been sleeping in this

[41:00] damn arcade for for like a year on a pull out couch so this thing so I woke up one day I'm like you know I love this

[41:08] room it's it to me it still feels like a New York City landmark it's kind of iconic people people love coming into this

[41:14] room and then the joy they get but I also realized everyone else was getting enjoyment out of it more than I was

[41:21] and mainly because I don't play the arcade games anymore I don't play the video games I don't enjoy video games like I do

[41:27] pinball so he said look I know I can get to pinball machines inside this room and I can sort of put a real

[41:34] bed in it and I can make it still really cool but much more like minimalist where like the pinball

[41:40] machines would be the focal point with the art it won't look like a skittles bag exploded inside this

[41:46] room and so I decided to make the change and and I'm excited about it I love making a room into a

[41:53] sort of like a project and seeing what I can do with it and so the first thing I was trying to do was like let me

[42:00] just sell my games let me sell my arcade games and and list them for sale and I and put them all over

[42:06] different Facebook groups that collect and sell arcade games and what happened immediately I got

[42:13] inundated by the the clav haters who were just like it's that asshole canada who ripped off

[42:20] someone years ago for fix a field exterior and they also just started shitting on my prices right so

[42:27] I have a punch out that's fully restored mint and I asked for three thousand dollars for it and people you know

[42:34] there's always the same thing with pinball you get the people who are like it's not worth that you're crazy you know

[42:39] and they take it as a personal insult so I always say this to people go try and find a fully restored punch out

[42:47] fully restored with everything new capped monitor go go try and find one just just even try and locate one

[42:55] and you won't you won't find one probably available so what's it worth if you want to game that week

[43:02] if you want to restore one out in the world there's none out there you can have mine you can have it for

[43:08] three thousand dollars which is what maybe five hundred dollars more than I paid for it after three four years

[43:13] but again the price of all these things has gone up so I decided to do this I decided to store the games

[43:20] instead of selling them because I think if I impulse sold everything I'd probably regret it and if I ever want to have

[43:26] another game room again and I want some of these like these classic games like fix it Felix you'll never find another Disney

[43:31] original fix it Felix I'll never find another Steve we be Kong off edition Donkey Kong I'll never I'll never get rid of my home

[43:38] you so many street fighter so this is what I love about this hobby a member of this hobby and I don't want to say who it is

[43:46] he's a good friend he's a great guy he lives close by he said Chris you know I help you store your games he's got he's got access to

[43:58] storage facility and he's going to take the punch out in the fix it Felix and put it in his house in his arcade

[44:06] in his game room which is like a maculate it's like a museum to some of the coolest games out there and I couldn't be happier

[44:13] I couldn't be happier for a few reasons I couldn't be happier because you know I don't have to like put these things in a

[44:20] storage unit where no one's getting any love and pay like a hundred bucks a month and no one's even using them he's going to

[44:26] get to enjoy these these great machines and I think they should be enjoyed I think punch out should be played Felix

[44:32] should be played I never want to be that guy that has like a storage locker full of things that just sits there for

[44:40] months so that's the good news and that transition is going to happen pretty quickly I'm excited to show you guys what I do

[44:47] with this room in terms of the kind of pinball shrine I'm going to make it but you'll just have to wait I know it's

[44:54] going to piss off a lot of you what I do I know I know for a fact but you'll just have to wait and see what that

[45:01] is but that's episode one 12 of Canada's pinball podcast exciting exciting interview happening soon on the show

[45:08] I will be talking to Roger Sharp about licensing I think it's going to be great so many good questions I have for

[45:15] for Mr. Sharp I'm so happy he's agreed to be a guest on the show we just have to figure out if his Skype is working so we're

[45:22] going to try and do that tonight I've been talking to other individuals about coming on and I don't want to spoil who they are but they're coming on soon too
