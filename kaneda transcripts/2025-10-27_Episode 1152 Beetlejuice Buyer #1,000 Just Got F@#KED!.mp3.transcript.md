[00:38] Spooky speak the world's first like interactive voice pinball machine is coming it is right around the corner and the moment we've all been waiting for

[00:49] November 14th everybody tell your wives they ain't going on vacation this year you're getting Beetlejuice baby

[00:58] and we've known this for a long time that this game was going to be a statement game and I've been saying it for months and I'm so happy to see them implement the voice interactivity between the player and the game

[01:14] it's going to be standard body game with great speed Christopher franchise artwork is going to be insane it's got an LCD screen that's not going to wash out all the blacks people are you ready are you ready for the next evolution of what a boutique pinball company can put into the market

[01:38] I mean this is it people this is it this company once made the ugliest game in all of pinball with America's most haunted and now a tiny little company in Benton Wisconsin all these years later is going to bring out into the pinball world a theme that Stern pinball passed on a theme that Stern pinball said nobody wanted to make George Gomez got up there and said

[02:07] I asked around to my design team and they didn't want to make this game well here you go George here you go it's showtime they're about to sell 999 units like instantly flipping out has been sending people deposit invoices gone and every single distributor knows their allocation so if you get asked for a deposit you are buying one of those allocated spot

[02:35] these things are going to go so fast it's not even funny it's based on the first movie the studio did not make them jam the second film into the game it's going to have DJ on code and a new guy from American pinball two coders working on it it's going to have so many scopes in this game it's going to make your Star Wars look like the Costco piece of crap that it is

[03:05] and here we are just a few weeks away spooky pinball dropping right before Halloween exactly what they needed to do because I think this week Stern pinball is going to try to get people to buy the walking dead remastered and all of a sudden now all the hype around Winchester's mystery house come on you got to be honest some of that hype has dissipated now that we heard

[03:35] Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice and even in just that quick flash of the speaker grill with the snake and it's like Beetlejuice is black and white suit and you can see the Frenchy Translight looks amazing and you can tell this game is just going to be like evil dead on crack and only 999 and here's the big thing it might seem like that's a lot of games but it's not

[04:03] because it's only 999 ever they're not going to do another run they're not going to do a blood kiss edition of it they're not going to do a comic book edition 10 years later this is it and while everybody else is out there making thousands of stuff this is going to be a very hard if not impossible to get game for guy number 1000

[04:30] because you got to think about it anybody over 1000 right guy number 1000 can't get one and if there are 5000 people out in the pinball buying world and there has to be because 5000 people bought like Harry Potter's 5000 people bought guns and roses Metallica ACDC so if there are 5000 people are more that want to Beetlejuice game and there's only 999 ever

[05:00] instantly instantly the demand is always going to outweigh the supply and this game is going to go for sale and we're going to see the whole thing on November 14th another really wise decision spooky keeps pulling it back just a little bit their reveal dates they just you know evil deads have all been spoken for but we're going to get this game in November and then the games are not going to ship until January so there's going to be a bit of a wait while they play test it while they quality test it

[05:30] while they iron out some of the kings but there's always been about a two month wait between spooky reveal and the games going on the line but I think this game is just going to be that special where nobody's going to care what's going to get really interesting is this it is now a very crowded end of the year people gave deposits on Winchester 525 people committing to 11 6 for that game.

[05:56] Stern pinball did sell some Star Wars I feel sorry for everyone out there who bought a Star Wars but that's still you know they're going to make a few thousand Star Wars games that people have bought then we're going to get the walking dead any day now and I think that's going to be funny because Stern's actually with a straight face going to launch the walking dead a game that was once $6500 they're going to launch it for $13000 and it's going to be twice the price of the original and I also think they're going to be able to sell some Star Wars.

[06:26] So there may be a price increase if they put all of Spike 3's elements into the walking dead now look Beetlejuice as an entry level game seems like a bargain but there are some additions that everyone's most likely going to do it is 999 so let's just say $10,000 then the butter cabinet is another like 15 1600 and then the toppers another 15 1600 so ostensibly you're looking at all in a $13000 game but nobody came to the game.

[06:56] I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because

[07:26] I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because I think that's going to be a good thing to do because

[07:56] The best theme we've had ever from stern pinball and they made the game pretty damn bad like it's brutal to shoot

[08:03] It's got some real issues with the game and it's on a DMD

[08:08] It's crazy that stern pinball knew that they were moving to the spike system and they were going LCD screen

[08:15] And they could have held Ghostbusters back and spent some more money and got all the assets instead

[08:21] We've got a DMD Ghostbusters

[08:24] It's definitely looking really dated and this would have been the perfect time instead of remaking the walking dead

[08:32] Instead of even remaking Tron even though there's a new Tron movie out there that kind of sucks

[08:37] They should have brought back Ghostbusters

[08:40] How amazing would it have been if stern pinball brought back Ghostbusters and punched this holiday season

[08:48] against a haunted house game and Winchester and a Beetlejuice game with spooky pinball

[08:53] Instead they're gonna bring back the walking dead. I think it's gonna be dead on arrival now this Beetlejuice game

[09:00] I just want to tell you right now if you're not calling around to your distros now now that it's official and

[09:07] You're not getting a game

[09:09] Don't come crying to me and asking me to get you a spot. You've had so many months now

[09:17] To get on a list. What are you waiting for and I mean it when I say it?

[09:22] I think this game is gonna go all the way up to

[09:28] $18,000 instantly because I think the demand to get one is gonna be just that high and I've said it before a

[09:37] Lot of people now are adopting a new mindset. I'd rather have one beautiful girlfriend

[09:43] Then two mediocre girlfriends. I'd rather have one

[09:48] spooky machine

[09:50] Than two stern premiums

[09:52] So if stern premiums are

[09:55] $9,700 each and they're easy to get and there are diamond doesn't heck stern a leisure a diamond doesn't in easy to get

[10:01] What would you rather do if you get locked out of Beetlejuice at 9 9 9?

[10:06] I keep saying it like there's that unlucky guy

[10:09] That's gonna get bit by the pinball bug the day after Beetlejuice gets launched. I feel so bad for that guy

[10:15] He's out there. He doesn't even know it yet

[10:17] He's like gonna stumble upon one of these cool toy

[10:21] YouTube's or see a Ralph video or a flipping out video

[10:24] He's gonna get bit by the pinball bug the day after Beetlejuice gets launched and he's gonna go hey, honey

[10:31] Look, here's a Beetlejuice game. What do you think should we get one for the the game room for the basement and his wife's gonna be like

[10:36] Yeah, sure go get it and he's gonna be like a doctor a lawyer. He's gonna look out into his driveway

[10:42] He's got like six figures and cars and he's gonna call up a distra

[10:46] Hey, I'd like to order a Beetlejuice. They're gonna be like you want a Beetlejuice

[10:50] You want a turbo man?

[10:54] They're like oh, sorry ain't got that but I do got this Star Wars Ellie that I think you might like

[10:59] That's what's gonna happen

[11:01] And I think what's gonna happen with this game when we see it in all seriousness

[11:05] I think we're gonna see a level of passion and attention to detail and a level of love that went into this game

[11:14] That is gonna make this game stay in place

[11:17] I don't think you're gonna see a lot of people buying this game and then getting tired of it and then listing it for sale

[11:25] I think it's gonna feel like one of those special moments in pinball that you're just gonna want to be a part of I

[11:30] Think you're gonna remember where you were when you saw it for the first time

[11:34] I think you're gonna remember the day you unboxed it

[11:36] And I think it's gonna bring a level of smile to your face that you haven't had in a really long time

[11:42] Unboxing all of these stern games and I think the pinball hobby has gone through a lot over the last four to five years

[11:48] I think the pinball community has been

[11:52] Abused by the biggest pinball company in the world

[11:54] I think Stern took advantage of everybody by putting mediocre cheap products out into the market

[12:01] And I think Stern is gonna be very embarrassed when they see the detail on Beetlejuice

[12:06] And then they look over at Star Wars and they see that at-at on the side armor of the game

[12:12] And they see how lazy they've become and the biggest pinball company in the entire world

[12:19] With the most resources in the entire world thinks that that's good enough for

[12:26] $13,000 and the problem today is we have

[12:29] Eyeballs and we can see and we can compare what one company is saying is worth this much money

[12:35] And what another company is saying is worth this much money

[12:39] Every single spooky game comes with a topper included

[12:43] Even if you don't buy the expensive topper every single game comes with a topper included

[12:49] There are not three variations of Beetlejuice

[12:52] There's one you can upgrade to the butter cabinet if you want

[12:56] But they don't make you do it and I think you're gonna go from head to toe on this game and Christopher

[13:02] Franch is gonna fill in one of the most beautiful games we've ever seen and there's no excuses anymore

[13:09] There's just no excuses anymore at these prices for these companies to come out with anything that doesn't feel head to toe a

[13:17] labor of love

[13:19] attention to detail

[13:20] pinball passion and pinball personality and moments and things that wow us in the final product a

[13:27] Lot of companies have been swinging at the plate and missing horrendously bad

[13:32] I think this pinball hobby is gonna lose a few of these boutiques this year because there's no need for them anymore

[13:37] How many of you looking at what spooky pinball is doing? Are you saying? Hey, man?

[13:42] I can't wait to get the next game from Padredy. I can't wait to get the next game from pinball brothers

[13:47] Home pin is still making pins. I think pinball adventures is still out there all of these boutiques American pinball is dead

[13:54] They're not making any more games, but so many of these boutiques just don't have it figured out

[13:58] I think when the dust settles at the end of this year what we're gonna see is the following

[14:02] I think Jersey Jack pinball is gonna lead the high-end bespoke like boutique company that they are

[14:08] They're gonna be in second place by volume after stern

[14:11] But they're gonna have a lot more energy and momentum and enthusiasm

[14:15] Around their products then stern will moving forward then it's spooky pinball

[14:21] Spooky pinball is really in an interesting place because I think they have so much excitement

[14:26] They have themes that they know they could sell way more than a thousand of but I think they're gonna do it right

[14:32] I think they're gonna build themselves up to a size where it works for them

[14:36] It works for them in Benton, Wisconsin

[14:38] It works for them to remain a family-run operation where everyone's going to bed at night

[14:44] Even though they're working hard they feel like they're not gonna bite off more than they can chew and they're gonna establish a company

[14:50] That's a win-win win for everybody

[14:52] I think they're doing it so well, and I think they're delivering on something

[14:57] We never thought was imaginable from spooky pinball, and I think it's amazing and after spooky pinball

[15:03] I think the next in line right now, and I mean this is barrels of fun

[15:07] I think barrels is in a good position if David can pick themes that are better than dune and have sort of like appeal

[15:15] I mean the fact that Winchester sold in two days what dune couldn't sell in six months is

[15:21] Just indication that dune was a bad pick. I know he keeps trying to resuscitate that game and resurrect it

[15:28] But David it was just a bad pick if you pick something better and more mainstream and has that nostalgic value

[15:36] You're gonna see what you saw with Winchester ten times over, but barrels makes a good game

[15:42] They've got passionate people over there when you look at the barrels products very shiny very beautiful

[15:49] And I think the future for them is gonna be a okay. I think people have faith in them

[15:54] They haven't ripped anybody off right they haven't had any shenanigans. I think they're gonna be just fine

[16:01] Chicago gaming company will be fine because they've got you know church Hill

[16:06] Cabinetry company keeping them going, but they're kind of annoying, but they'll still be around like CGC will always be there

[16:12] They're gonna make more

[16:14] Freakin medieval madnesses next year, which is so annoying, but whatever they become

[16:18] The medieval madness company I feel like and then maybe we get mark richie's halo

[16:23] But they might shelve that because let's be honest nobody wants a halo pinball machine

[16:28] Dutch pinballs obviously got back to the future the questions still remain whether or not they can make it

[16:35] How are they even gonna supply even in iota of the demand for that game?

[16:39] But it's coming and it's coming at the end of next year

[16:43] And so they're gonna release Raza as a bridge between Alice and back to the future and I think they're gonna get there

[16:51] I think the game is gonna come out. This is Barry's moment if he can knock it out of the park

[16:56] I think they're gonna have something very very special the early reports

[17:00] I'm getting from that game are

[17:02] Phenomenal and I'm here to tell you right now

[17:04] I told it yesterday and maybe some people know this some people don't I'm here to 100% confirmed for you

[17:09] That the artist on back to the future will be no other than mr. Christopher franchise

[17:15] So that's exciting and I'm excited that spooky

[17:18] You know didn't have any problems with him working with his old friend Joe Camnikow and they're gonna put together

[17:24] What will be a stunning back to the future game and I know that spooky they have this vibe

[17:29] We're like if someone's got it and they make it right we're happy for them

[17:33] Like I know they're happy probably that they didn't even make Godzilla that Keith Ellen and Stern did so that is

[17:39] Coming at the end of next year. We've got a Sonic the Hedgehog from Jersey Jack coming out next year

[17:44] I've been hearing mixed things on this rumor about

[17:48] JJP having ghost busters. I know Don reported that. I don't know if that's gonna be true

[17:52] I don't know I can't imagine that rumor being true

[17:55] I mean I would like it to be true, but I'm not sure that's gonna come to fruition

[17:58] We've got Turner pinball out there doing his thing again like Chris has got this really interesting

[18:04] Technology but he needs to make a game people want it's just that simple

[18:08] He needs to make a game people want and you know if he's got this easier way to manufacture

[18:13] Then he's got a you know connect with one of these pinball companies that has stuff people want and ink a deal

[18:19] I think it's gonna be a very interesting few years and I think Stern is in big trouble and I've meant this for a while

[18:25] I think they're in big trouble because I think they made some colossal mistakes

[18:29] And I don't think they know how to get out of it

[18:32] And I think the more we get games like Beetlejuice the more we get games with attention to detail and pure passion

[18:39] The more it's making their games look cheap and here's the problem. How do they get out of that perception?

[18:45] How can they keep charging 13,000 for these le's and 10,000 for these premiums as their games are looking so cheap?

[18:53] And they look half the price when you put them next to an evil dead or a Harry Potter

[18:58] How do they get around that and they're not gonna survive with Costco or being an operator friendly game?

[19:05] I think they got way too greedy and I think they fleeced us for way too many years

[19:10] And I think people are just moving past them. I really do. I think the collectors especially are not looking at Stern anymore

[19:18] Because if you're a collector and you've been unboxing these stern le's the last three to four years

[19:23] You've lost like almost

[19:25] 30,000 to $30,000 in value. How is that something worth collecting and how would that make you happy?

[19:31] Well life is short. I just want to buy the toy. How does that make you happy?

[19:35] How does that make you happy that knowing that some dude who walks into the hobby today could save

[19:41] $30,000 and have the same exact collection as yours and by the way, nobody wants those games at all anymore

[19:47] I mean look at people trying to sell the walking dead le that used to be a game that people held on to because it's a good game

[19:54] But nowadays look at it. Everyone's trying to ask 8500 for one and nobody wants it

[20:00] I have friends who have listed that game for sale now for four months at

[20:06] 8,000 8500 nobody wants it absolutely nobody wants it and guess what happens when the new game comes out

[20:11] It's gonna go down even more. It's not good

[20:14] Stern did not think about the long-term effects of burning their customers and I think spooky is the exact opposite

[20:22] I think they're playing the long game

[20:25] Yeah, we could make more Beetlejuice machines

[20:29] But if we make 999 and we pass on to all of our customers

[20:35] tremendous value if we see our customers flip their games for three to

[20:41] 8,000 or $5,000 profit that would make us happy if we try to take all that money

[20:48] ourselves and increase the prices of our products or make more games when we said we wouldn't which is what Stern did if

[20:56] We do that we will make a short-term gain

[21:00] But we will lose our customers in the long run and that is what Stern did

[21:07] They turn their back on people

[21:09] They made more le's and they fleeced us with the price of things and they didn't give us any

[21:17] Secondhand value they took it all for themselves and now they're in big trouble

[21:23] Spooky's in the driver's seat

[21:25] They're gonna sell these things in like nine seconds and then the next game if it's gremlins or goonies

[21:30] Just make a thousand of each you will have people waiting up for years to get one

[21:36] You will sell out of every single game every single year at this time of year and have the greatest Christmas of your lives

[21:45] Why not just do that you think it's a good Christmas over at Stern?

[21:49] You think George Gary and Seth looking at the numbers around Star Wars and King Kong you think they're having a good Christmas

[21:57] You think the folks over at Stern are having a good time. No, they're not I can tell I can tell they're not having a good time

[22:04] And they did it to themselves. So spooky pinball keep doing what you're doing, baby on November 14th

[22:11] You're gonna send a message to everybody that you're no longer that little company in Benton, Wisconsin

[22:18] You can now make what this community is considering to be

[22:23] some of the most spectacular and amazing pinball the world has ever seen and

[22:29] Nothing would make me sleep more like a baby at night than that. So congratulations. I can't wait to see it

[22:35] I think everybody feels the same way and if you're a skeptic about

[22:39] Spooky and you stayed off the list get ready people

[22:43] Canada's got five games coming from spooky that I'm gonna figure out how to handle that these are gonna be special

[22:50] These are beyond super limited edition. I don't know what they're gonna do

[22:53] They said they might do something for the special canada editions of the game

[22:57] I should make it so you can't turn on these versions of the game unless you say canada canada canada, baby

[23:05] That's how you turn it on let's see. I can't wait to see spooky speak everybody happy Monday. Thank you for your support canada out

[23:28] You son of a bitch
