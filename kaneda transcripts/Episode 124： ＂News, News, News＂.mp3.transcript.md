[00:00] Welcome to episode 124 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:27] It's a very hot and humid Friday here in New York City.

[00:31] But I wanted to do one of my shorter news focused podcasts.

[00:35] I actually interviewed Christopher Franchi, the artist for Batman 66, and we had a great talk this weekend.

[00:42] I'm going to air that, most likely Sunday or Monday morning.

[00:47] The reason why I just want to break up the monotony of the show a little bit.

[00:49] I know I've been doing a lot of interviews.

[00:51] They've been a little bit over an hour.

[00:52] I know you guys love the interviews, but I also want to give you balance.

[00:56] I want to give you balance so I need balance too on this show.

[00:59] So I just want to go over some news items on this episode 124 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:04] And let's start at the top, the top of the big news of the week.

[01:08] And that is probably the boringest news I think I've ever seen.

[01:12] It's probably the thing I could care the least about.

[01:16] And that is ACDC Vault Edition has been announced officially.

[01:21] We all knew it was coming.

[01:23] We've been speculating.

[01:24] We've called it correctly that they were going to show us ACDC before Star Wars.

[01:29] And Stern put out a press release that it's hyper or sort of like it's ultimate sort of

[01:35] powerhouse game ACDC is going to be remade in both pro and premium editions.

[01:42] And they showed us what the pro edition looks like.

[01:45] And the big major change on that game is that the the disgustingly ugly Angus phase that literally

[01:52] looks like a terrible decal slapped onto the middle of the pro play field has been replaced

[01:58] with an image of Angus doing his like little air guitar dance.

[02:04] So what do I think of that?

[02:06] I think look it looks better.

[02:07] It looks better.

[02:08] I still don't care on any level.

[02:11] I still have absolutely zero no interest in ACDC pros.

[02:17] I think there's so many of them out there.

[02:19] I don't think this game has been hard to find.

[02:22] And I think this move clearly will make this new version of ACDC pro the one to have.

[02:28] It's a nicer version.

[02:29] It looks better.

[02:30] No one's going to want the one with the Angus phase.

[02:32] So if you have one of those, good luck selling it now.

[02:36] And you're not going to find many people who are going to want it.

[02:40] The only way you will sell it is if you sell it within the $4,000 price range.

[02:45] Because no one's going to pay anywhere close to $5,200 for it, which will be the street

[02:50] price most likely on this new one.

[02:52] I think the MSRP is around $6,000.

[02:55] And then the premium is the interesting one.

[02:57] So the premium is the one that most people are going to be looking towards.

[03:01] And I know for a fact that this new premium is going to have a new art package.

[03:06] Will it be hand drawn artwork or not?

[03:08] Will it be in a different style?

[03:10] The cabinet?

[03:11] I'm hearing the cabinet art will be different.

[03:13] And I'm hearing the...

[03:15] I see I don't know about the play field artwork.

[03:17] How different it will be.

[03:19] But I think it will definitely have a different looking cabinet.

[03:22] It will not have an LCD screen.

[03:25] And I don't think we're going to see it.

[03:27] I don't think it's coming out until the fall.

[03:30] So it's like one of these weird things.

[03:32] It's like why do this?

[03:33] I've been trying to figure out why Stern felt now was the time to announce an ACDC vault.

[03:42] Right?

[03:43] I kept hearing for the longest time that the reason why Star Wars wasn't being

[03:48] announced was to help Aerosmith sell more.

[03:51] Because Aerosmith has been a popular title.

[03:55] The reviews of it have been very great.

[03:58] People love the artwork.

[04:00] It's got a great toy in it with the toy box.

[04:02] It's a great package, right?

[04:03] Aerosmith is a great package.

[04:05] How do you help sell more Aerosmith pinball machines

[04:09] by releasing a vault edition of another musical pin?

[04:14] All right?

[04:14] I just don't see how that helps at all.

[04:19] But look, I would rather get Aerosmith.

[04:21] It's just newer.

[04:22] I think it looks better.

[04:23] I still think the Aerosmith Pro is the best bang for the buck in pinball this year.

[04:29] And it's just another,

[04:31] you know, it's also this seems to be an indication, though,

[04:34] that Stern really just wants games on the line.

[04:38] They just need to keep stuff going.

[04:41] It's a little bit of a,

[04:43] I'm just wondering, but like,

[04:45] are they really having a problem with games on the line?

[04:48] And I don't think so.

[04:49] I mean, they've got tons of Ghostbuster orders that they still need to make.

[04:55] I'm assuming I'm, this is just an assumption.

[04:57] I don't know if Batman has sold as well as they would have liked.

[05:02] I doubt it has sold that well,

[05:06] considering Batman again, cost more than everything else.

[05:12] And so, Star Wars, you know,

[05:14] people are probably just waiting with money in their pockets for Star Wars.

[05:18] And, you know, I thought it was kind of like a little,

[05:21] Steve Richie posted on Facebook, a quote that was

[05:27] seemingly a Star Wars quote, but he was really just joking because it was going to be ACDC.

[05:33] And, you know, whatever.

[05:36] These guys know that they know what everybody wants.

[05:39] And they're now teasing us once again.

[05:42] ACDC is a wha-wha kind of moment.

[05:46] I don't think people care.

[05:48] Did you see the guy who's selling his Lucy?

[05:50] He was selling it for $16,000.

[05:52] Now, he's raised the price of that Lucy to $18,000.

[05:58] Absolutely ridiculous.

[06:00] I think it's funny.

[06:01] If you go in eBay, if you go in eBay and you search for Pimball,

[06:05] you'll see his game listed there.

[06:07] But go look and see what's listed for $1

[06:10] below his listing of his Lucy edition for, for like, I think he lowered the price now to

[06:19] $18,000 flat or $17,500.

[06:22] Go look at what's there.

[06:23] Just eBay Pimball.

[06:25] Search for highest price.

[06:26] It'll come up pretty immediately.

[06:28] I want you guys just to discover that on your own if you haven't seen it yet.

[06:33] And then I'll explain why I did that.

[06:34] But, okay.

[06:36] So, what else is going on in the news?

[06:37] The other big news, which is happening immediately as I do this podcast is there is an update

[06:43] on the Big Lebowski situation.

[06:45] Not just a recap.

[06:47] These guys are still negotiating with ARA, a deal to get those 40 Lebowski's out to their owners.

[06:55] And production has been halted.

[06:57] It will be.

[06:58] This is incredible.

[06:58] It will be a year in July, August that the Big Lebowski's stopped shipping to customers, right?

[07:06] A year.

[07:07] I think people forget how long they carried that lie about the board issues.

[07:10] Like that lie went on for months and months and months.

[07:14] So, here's the update.

[07:14] And it's not a good one.

[07:16] It's not a good one.

[07:17] The update is this.

[07:19] That currently, the deal on the table is that ARA with like 51% control of Dutch Pimball

[07:29] to move forward.

[07:30] 51%.

[07:31] Okay.

[07:32] So, they want to take over the controlling shares of Dutch Pimball, which means they would

[07:39] would for all intents and purposes, they would own Dutch Pimball.

[07:43] They'd be the controlling partner at 51%.

[07:46] In another way to describe this to me is a hostile takeover.

[07:52] Is it not?

[07:52] Isn't this what hostile takeovers do?

[07:55] Someone comes in and basically takes over the controlling portion of your company.

[08:01] This is, if you're a Dutch Pimball, if you're if you're up in Barry, this is a nightmare offer.

[08:06] How do I say it's a good offer?

[08:08] The guys that you went to to help build your game, right?

[08:11] They didn't do any of the the back work.

[08:14] They didn't do any of like the concepting.

[08:16] All the years of developing this game, the Pimball,

[08:22] you know, drive that these guys had.

[08:24] And now they're at the mercy of their contract manufacturer.

[08:28] And this is exactly what George Gomez told me would happen to these guys when I shared that

[08:35] taxi ride with him back from Texas Pimball Festival two years ago.

[08:40] He said to me, and I repeat, Dutch Pimball will never make it because they are contract

[08:45] manufacturing the game.

[08:47] And he basically said to me, the contract manufacturer will hold them hostage and can make

[08:53] whatever demands they want and there's nothing that Dutch can do.

[08:59] So right now we're in a situation where what can Dutch do other than other than accept these terms.

[09:08] So if they accept the terms, I think you guys will get your games.

[09:13] I think the pressure will be on them to accept these terms and to allow

[09:18] this new version of Dutch Pimball to form where ARA and them are sort of connected.

[09:23] Now look, I don't think they have another option because I think that ARA sees these guys and

[09:29] realizes there's no way they could afford to go find a new contract manufacturer.

[09:35] Right? They just can't.

[09:37] All the tooling that went into getting ARA ramped up to make La Bouskies,

[09:43] they like, there's a lot of work.

[09:45] A lot of work that goes into getting your contract manufacturer set up to make your product.

[09:51] They can't afford to then start over with that process with someone else.

[09:54] So ARA knows this.

[09:56] ARA knows that Dutch is kind of fucked.

[09:59] So why not?

[10:01] Because you hold all the good cards and you have the leverage here.

[10:07] ARA doesn't care.

[10:08] ARA doesn't care that rare hero our boy Greg is suffering.

[10:13] He doesn't care that Dutch Pimball is getting raked over the coals on Pinside.

[10:18] And the reason they don't care give a shit because they haven't been paid by these guys.

[10:22] They haven't been paid.

[10:24] And look, they want to get paid but they also know that it's not just about

[10:30] helping out the Pimball community.

[10:31] Like that's not their agenda at all.

[10:33] Their agenda is how can we make sure this doesn't happen again?

[10:39] We might have bit off more than we could chew when it comes to manufacturing a Pimball machine.

[10:44] Like they might have realized these things are more complex.

[10:46] They're harder to make.

[10:47] Our original contract wasn't good.

[10:49] Dutch Pimball should be charging $15,000 per machine based upon the complexities.

[10:54] And this and that.

[10:55] And this and that.

[10:55] I don't know.

[10:56] All I know is every time I see these companies price their machines where they're at,

[11:02] they fail to get into mass production.

[11:05] They struggle to manufacture the games.

[11:07] So that leads me to believe that everybody,

[11:09] all these new boutiques have no clue on how to price a Pimball machine

[11:14] when it comes to actually pricing it to a point where they can

[11:19] survive the manufacturing process.

[11:21] Right?

[11:21] We see it time and time again.

[11:23] These companies completely flounder when it comes to manufacturing.

[11:28] And if you're not manufacturing Pimball, then you're not really doing much.

[11:31] All the money these companies spend going around to different shows.

[11:35] Bragging about how great they are.

[11:36] Showing their games off at all the different expos.

[11:39] All that stuff costs money.

[11:40] All those flights.

[11:41] All those dinners.

[11:42] All those penthouse sweets.

[11:43] These guys run it out.

[11:44] Oh man, look where the money is now.

[11:47] Now you're about to lose control of your company because you didn't plan properly.

[11:51] All right?

[11:51] They're planning.

[11:52] They didn't plan for success because this thing has not been successful.

[11:57] I'm calling on Dutch to accept the terms of ARA.

[12:00] I think what's the worst that could happen?

[12:03] You connect with them.

[12:04] You build your future games with them.

[12:07] And you put this behind you.

[12:09] You form a new entity and Yoppenberry.

[12:11] You've got 49%.

[12:13] It's what happens.

[12:14] It's what happens when you miss manage your company.

[12:18] ARA knows how to make the games.

[12:20] They've proven they can make and ship the games.

[12:22] And they've got the capacity to make future games for you.

[12:27] So I think these guys need to bite the ball and take the deal and get people their Lebowski's.

[12:31] I think they need to do it soon too because I don't know what else

[12:35] their consultants are going to tell them.

[12:37] Yeah, they're a little bit fucked.

[12:38] Yeah, this isn't what they wanted to happen with their company.

[12:40] Yeah, they're about to lose control over their company.

[12:42] Yeah, that's what happens when you completely

[12:46] mismanage this whole thing.

[12:47] Right?

[12:48] Okay, let's move on to the next topic.

[12:51] So let's talk about a better manufacturing situation going on.

[12:55] And that's dialed in.

[12:56] And I'm really excited to see the dialed in line.

[13:00] I had a friend of mine, Robert and you Jersey,

[13:03] took a trip over to Jersey Jack yesterday, shared some photos with me

[13:07] of the assembly line going on.

[13:09] It's game one is built, the test game, game two is built.

[13:14] There is a whole bunch of dialed in cabinets lined up waiting for play fields to be put in.

[13:20] But the line is up and going.

[13:21] The line is up.

[13:22] The play fields are above the workstations.

[13:25] Right?

[13:25] All the parts are at the workstations.

[13:28] And seeing a pinball manufacturing image is awesome.

[13:36] It's something that is always fun to see.

[13:38] If you guys have never been to Stern or never been to Jersey Jack,

[13:43] it's such a cool visual that this modern day,

[13:47] sort of old school kind of assembly line of how these games are made.

[13:51] Right?

[13:51] And so we wish Jack all the luck in getting those early games out the door.

[13:58] It does look like dialed in will be in customer hands in May,

[14:04] which is I think just maybe one month later than Jack said,

[14:09] I think they were initially saying April.

[14:13] But man, right?

[14:14] Jersey Jack, I've done a 180 on Jersey Jack.

[14:17] I don't know if you can tell.

[14:18] You can go back and listen to some of my previous podcasts.

[14:22] And I remember one specifically, man, where I was down on Jersey Jack.

[14:26] I was calling these guys a Ponzi scheme.

[14:29] I remember making a podcast,

[14:31] and Tiger laws apartment in New Orleans,

[14:34] just railing on these guys.

[14:36] And I think that ever since they've got this new investor,

[14:41] Jersey Jack has turned to corner.

[14:42] He's turned to corner for the better.

[14:44] He's still done some some things he said he wasn't going to do,

[14:47] like show the game before it was ready to ship.

[14:49] But here's the deal.

[14:51] Jack said this game was going to ship in like Q2 of 2017.

[14:56] It's going to ship in Q2 of 2017.

[14:59] It's a little bit just a few weeks off from when he anticipated,

[15:03] which is nothing.

[15:05] But we also know that they have this game on location,

[15:10] getting feedback from people playing it for months.

[15:14] Feedback that is going to be implemented into the first games that go to customers,

[15:18] which is how it always should have been.

[15:20] Right, that's always how Stern used to do it.

[15:23] This whole notion of like, let's keep a game absolutely secret.

[15:27] Let's not put any out on location for testing

[15:31] before customer games roll out.

[15:34] Is really a new phenomenon that Stern has utilized that sort of method.

[15:39] They're doing it for one reason,

[15:40] just to create that bubble of hype that makes the games like sell out immediately.

[15:46] Because you don't really have time to think about whether or not you want to go in on an

[15:50] L-e or not now with Stern.

[15:52] You just you have to jump in and get it or it's going to be gone.

[15:55] But if they put games on location and people play them and look,

[15:59] even if they put games on location and people play them like,

[16:01] let's say Batman for example, they put it on location for a few months to test it before

[16:06] the order banks open up.

[16:08] People might not give it glowing reviews and people might wait for the next title.

[16:14] But when you don't even get a chance to see Batman or play Batman and Batman already sells out,

[16:20] you can tell that Stern's method is great at creating sold out products.

[16:28] But it's also really bad at catching quality control issues.

[16:31] And that's the balance that Stern needs to figure out.

[16:34] Because we've seen time and time again.

[16:36] Some of these games is really shipped with quality issues.

[16:39] And those things would have been caught.

[16:40] Had they been on location like dialed in.

[16:42] So dialed in has been on location.

[16:44] Pat Lawler has been implementing some of the feedback into the game.

[16:48] We saw that what the final version of the playfields going to look like.

[16:52] The subway station has been redesigned.

[16:54] Looks really cool.

[16:55] Not sure if they're going to redesign the quantum theater.

[16:57] I think they're going to have to put a sign on that to make it look better.

[17:00] Because it's just a black box right now.

[17:02] But all signs are looking really good.

[17:04] The customers are going to get their dialed in very soon.

[17:09] We still don't know what the collector's edition looks like.

[17:12] But I think Jack's probably going to get that together next.

[17:15] And I think the way he's doing it is he's going to put a few standard edition dialed in

[17:20] out on location that are final production builds.

[17:24] And then he's going to do a run of L.E.'s.

[17:27] And then he'll do the collector's editions.

[17:29] Once he's confident that they've sort of caught any early issues with manufacturing of the game.

[17:35] And I think that's the right way to go.

[17:38] Don't launch with the most expensive version and find out there's issues.

[17:43] I mean that was like Ghostbusters.

[17:45] L.E.'s.

[17:45] And that was the problem.

[17:46] L.E.'s went out first and all the issues were hitting the most expensive versions of the game.

[17:52] So we look forward to playing more dialed in.

[17:55] I'll say this.

[17:56] There's just one thing that I think dialed in needs.

[17:58] And I don't know about you guys.

[18:00] But I've heard this from multiple people.

[18:02] And Ryan said this when we interviewed Ryan.

[18:04] There's just something about the game that's not clicking in terms of pulling you into the game.

[18:08] And when I think dialed in needs, when you start the game,

[18:11] it just needs a very simple, how you doing, player?

[18:15] Like we're here to save Quantum City.

[18:17] Quantum City has been overtaken by the cell phone company that has the power to control the weather.

[18:22] What does that mean?

[18:23] Like just a real like quick like 30 second,

[18:27] like introduction to the story or the narrative, I think is really important.

[18:32] Because it's like one of those games where like you start playing it and you really don't know what's going on.

[18:38] It doesn't have the luxury of a movie or a TV show that people are already aware of.

[18:45] So they get the gist of what they're trying to do.

[18:49] And I think because this is an original storyline, they need to do a better job of even having

[18:54] just like a tutorial or a welcome to Quantum City that you can play for people.

[18:59] Like how cool that be if there's just like a one to two minute.

[19:02] Here's like it's almost like take the comic book and make it like a video that

[19:07] people can watch to show their friends and people who come over their houses and their game rooms.

[19:13] Here's what we're doing in this game.

[19:14] Like watch it and then like it pulls you in and then you're ready to go.

[19:18] I think that like it's kind of like when you get like on a roller coaster and I was like that

[19:21] video that explains to you like the journey you're about to go on.

[19:25] I think Dal then needs that video, that that tutorial that gives people an explanation about what

[19:31] it is they're about to do and why it's important and why they should care.

[19:37] I think if they're listening at Jersey Jack, I think that would be a great addition to dialed in.

[19:42] All right, what else is going on? So Alien Pimble, I was just chatting with my friends over at Coin

[19:47] Taker. They still have not received their machines and they were supposed to get 10 machines

[19:53] before Allentown. They still haven't gotten any of them.

[19:57] I think the latest number they've been told they should receive is five machines.

[20:02] But then we saw there's a gentleman in Florida who got his.

[20:06] There's a gentleman in Germany who got his.

[20:10] And we know Helpton has his. I think there's like a few more that have gone out.

[20:14] I think in total, in total I think the total number of Alien machines that are in customer homes

[20:21] right now. I want to say is anywhere between 10 and 20 at most. I don't think it's even that many.

[20:29] But I'm just I just still don't know what's going on with production. I still don't know what's going on.

[20:34] I'll say this. I've watched some of the videos. I've seen the Xenomorph head working.

[20:38] It's good to see that finally functioning.

[20:42] I don't know it doesn't seem to be grabbing the ball that fast but whatever it is what it is.

[20:46] The light show on the game is incredible. The sound on the game is incredible.

[20:52] I still when I watch the videos though I still think Alien looks really slow and floating.

[20:56] That's not just I think every wide body game. Every time I see the Hobbit, every time I see Alien videos

[21:01] I just think this game would have been so much better as a standard body.

[21:06] I think Andrew needs to buy some black screws for the front of the machine. Seeing those silver screws

[21:12] on this all black Alien machine is a head scratcher aesthetically. Come on. It's like that's such an easy

[21:20] thing to do. And I think we're at the point now. We're again it's just about production.

[21:26] I want to see production ramp up to the point where a container with like 50 Aliens arrives in

[21:35] America. I mean that's really what needs to happen next. The fact that these individuals have

[21:42] gotten their machines ahead of everybody else ahead of the distributor getting their machines.

[21:48] Again it just doesn't seem right. Are people still just paying cash and cutting the line

[21:55] and getting games before everybody else? I mean I don't even understand how coin taker the number

[22:00] the biggest distributor of Alien Pimball isn't isn't getting games before anybody. Why aren't they

[22:08] getting their games first? Why are games going out to other people who are just just one-offs or

[22:15] like one game going to one person like one game in a truck going to Florida, one game in a truck

[22:20] going to Germany. Obviously the truck's not going to Florida. The truck is taking that game to

[22:27] to an airplane or shipping freight. But look this one to one to one to one to one will not work.

[22:36] Alien Pimball needs to start shipping out something more like 50 a week for the to meet the

[22:44] demand of this game and to really fulfill the orders that he must have on Alien. So we'll continue

[22:51] to monitor it. I do not think you're going to see Alien Ali's insignificant numbers go out in

[22:58] June and July. I'm curious to see what the Ali owners excuses will be when that occurs because

[23:04] I love hearing these guys keep telling me how well that just means that the game's getting better.

[23:10] Well I think we're at that point now where the game's not getting better anymore. The game is just

[23:15] not getting to you. So that's where we're at. Another update in the world of manufacturing.

[23:22] Another this one's a good update came from Chicago Gaming Company and they gave everyone a really

[23:29] nice update on where they are with attack from Mars remake and I want to pull that up and just

[23:35] give you guys some of the highlights from that update. All right so the things that stick out to

[23:40] me with this update are the following. They're ramping up their production line and they said

[23:48] at first it will be slow but we hope to get up to 15 games per day within a few short weeks.

[23:54] This line will run six days a week. So 15 games a day someone I think did the math on it and

[24:00] that's around 30 500 games a year they're capable of manufacturing which is a lot which is a

[24:07] huge number. So that's an ambitious goal. We'll see if they can make that. Again I take all of

[24:15] these manufacturers goals with the grain assault. They said the first games up online will be

[24:22] attacked from our special editions. These games will be shipped to our dealers worldwide for the

[24:27] purposes of pinball festivals trade shows and display models. After that our focus will return to

[24:32] limited editions. So it looks like they're going to do 500 limited edition games and they're going

[24:41] to sort of go back and forth between MMR and attack from Mars. So they said we still have a lot of

[24:48] demand for MMR. In fact we have orders for nearly 500 games standing at this point. It is our

[24:53] plan to build the first 500 attack from Mars pins and then break to make the next run of 500 MMRs

[25:00] following the MMRs will be back to attack from Mars. As many of you know they said they artisted

[25:06] the top of her attack from Mars. It looks absolutely great. I don't know if you guys saw it too. I think

[25:11] the final version of the attack from Mars remake will come with that really nice decal that's on

[25:18] the the back box area which is normally just black in that game. The game looks amazing with the

[25:24] the mirrors the mirror side blades and then you I think there's also like those animated decals that

[25:31] you can put on the side that have like the laser beams from the UFOs and the lights going that

[25:35] looks really incredible as well. So it look attack from Mars remake game is game is really impressive

[25:42] if you like attack from Mars and you see this package coming from Chicago gaming company

[25:49] it's all going to come down to whether or not these guys can really get the production to where

[25:54] they say they want it to be because as I've said before people are so tired of waiting they're

[26:00] tired of being told to preorder and all this stuff and if you have a game in box that's a great

[26:07] classic game like attack from Mars I think these guys will find buyers for every single one. I

[26:13] really do. I don't think it's going to be challenging for them to find homes for these games and for

[26:19] those of you out there who don't think the new display looks better than the old you're out of your

[26:24] mind you're crazy you're holding on to the past I think the colored dots on attack from Mars remake

[26:30] even the even a larger screen just looks so much better when you see it in person and the final

[26:35] note I'll say is the green armor which has been an area of contention looks absolutely incredible

[26:41] on this game and I don't care if you hate it go see it go see it and and and tell me you think it

[26:47] doesn't look good it looks much better than silver I mean it's either you either go black or green

[26:51] on this game and I think you'll be in good shape so that's what's happening over there right so we

[26:56] have we have these guys coming out with games in the next few weeks we have dialed in's going out

[27:01] in the next few weeks we have alien that's supposed to be shipping in the next few weeks

[27:06] we have Star Wars that okay so here's the Star Wars rumor right I'm gonna I'm someone sent me

[27:13] new information about what was going on with Star Wars and I want to I want to read what their

[27:21] information is telling them and I don't believe any of it but I will I will simply pass it on to

[27:28] you so this looks like it's like a distributor in in Europe leaks some information but what I'm

[27:33] hearing is Star Wars Pro the European costs will be $5,480 and will be available in July

[27:43] August of 2017 Star Wars premium with the LCD will be at the price of $7,680 and will be in

[27:57] September of 2017 and then Star Wars LE will be August or September of 2017 and costs roughly

[28:08] $9,000 okay and then there's a CTC Pro information which is July August and then

[28:16] ACDC premium which is August the premium is looking at $7,150 so what does that mean that means

[28:25] it looks like there will be no Star Wars no well looks like Star Wars Pro could be in July which

[28:34] means we should then see a reveal in June so that is that's interesting you know but doesn't look

[28:42] like Star Wars LE will ship into August September so man that's that feels like a pretty pretty

[28:48] long ways away it's not too far out there but if this information is correct I think we can expect

[28:54] to see Star Wars revealed next month and look it is what it is at this point it's almost at the

[29:02] point where I think there's only so much you can stay excited waiting for Star Wars before you

[29:10] kind of are just over it a little bit you know I don't know that's just me personally I'm kind

[29:16] of my expectations they go up they go down they go up they go down this game and it's going to

[29:22] be a juggernaut and we just have to wait and we just have to be patient but that's what my

[29:27] information is telling me so we'll see if any that comes true don't don't hold me to it but that's

[29:34] where we at with that's where we at with Star Wars people just trying to think if there's anything

[29:39] else going on in the pinball world I want to tell you guys about what's going on with my magic girl

[29:44] because as as as I've shown from the very get go I am not a show for magic girl I'm not a show

[29:52] for American pinball I'm not a show for John Papa Duke I will tell you exactly my experiences

[29:59] with the game and I was the first one to break to the world the world exclusive that the game

[30:03] that arrived for customers was not complete it wasn't finished and it was pretty much a

[30:09] disappointing gameplay experience the game looks phenomenal the game sounds phenomenal the game

[30:14] has an incredible light show everybody who is supposed to do their job did it to the utmost

[30:20] degree everyone knocked it out of the park except for John Papa Duke he everything that he

[30:25] was in charge of to make work doesn't really work the big mechanisms the different toys the

[30:30] different functionality doesn't function on the game he simply stood on the shoulders of some

[30:37] very talented people and and he let them down he let them down he let them down not only financially

[30:44] he let them down by not giving them games he let them down by not having a final product work

[30:50] okay now American pinball I've been you know I've been friends with dovel for a few months we've

[30:56] we've he's he's you know as a stand-up guy I talked to him about the light board issues that I'm

[31:02] having my LED RGB light boards had stopped working and on a game like magic girl the problem is

[31:08] when you're when your stuff stops working nobody has prior experience fixing this thing right

[31:14] there's no there's no manual there's just a bunch of kind of crappy wire charts on zidware.com

[31:22] but nobody has any history of fixing one there's nothing to refer back to there's nobody to call

[31:29] there's no John Papa Duke to pick up the phone and and walk us through anything now that's that's

[31:35] the part that really sucks is that you can't you can't call John and he won't be like a normal dude

[31:41] and just help you and you know someone made the LGB are you know the LED RGB light boards

[31:49] somebody made the software that went on to the Arduino board so here's how it works there's

[31:54] this little board called the Arduino that sends the software signals to the LED boards okay now I

[32:01] don't know if my problem is a board issue or if the problem is the Arduino and the software on it

[32:08] sound complicated it does these aren't words I use in my everyday life it's actually not that

[32:13] complicated think about the Arduino it just as the engine that drives the boards okay now I had

[32:20] a tech come over who specializes in LED RGB boards we looked over the game for about an hour and

[32:29] we don't think it's a board issue because the boards are all getting power so we don't think it's

[32:33] a power supply issue we think it might be that Arduino board and the software running it and maybe

[32:39] that got corrupted somehow and maybe we need a new Arduino with new software on it I ordered a

[32:45] new Arduino board they're like 20 bucks plug it in nothing it doesn't work but again like then

[32:51] you know that didn't surprise me because the software is not on that brand new Arduino board

[32:58] so I moved over the chip from the old Arduino board to the new one just to see if maybe it was a

[33:02] connector on the Arduino board maybe if I moved the chip over to the new board it would work nope

[33:07] didn't work so my next step is I call up American Pimble I write an email to Davos explaining

[33:15] everything that's happened and the first thing Davos is to me is you know he's like well if it's a

[33:20] software issue you should call John and I just started laughing it's like man you can't tell people

[33:24] to call John telling people to call John is like telling them basically to kind of like fuck off

[33:30] like because John's not gonna help John's not gonna pick up the phone I'm not gonna call John I

[33:35] have been calling John I have been emailing John John has not responded to one of my inquiries

[33:41] since I got my magic girl I don't know if he's upset with me I don't know if he's pissed off with me

[33:46] but I know that John has spoken to the reporters at both the Wall Street Journal and popular

[33:52] science right so he speaks to my media friends over at pop side but doesn't return my calls so

[33:58] maybe he's mad I know that he spoke to Chris at coin taker for a little bit I didn't have any

[34:03] new information really I know he has some his mom is sick and all this stuff and I get that I mean

[34:08] life is happening around this whole scenario but my next steps are this I don't think John's gonna

[34:14] help me so what I'm going to do to troubleshoot this machine is I'm going to send my Arduino and

[34:21] the first light board and the connectors that are there I'm gonna send them to coin taker and then

[34:27] Chris and Scott over there his son who's the taker nice enough to sort of just swap those in to

[34:32] their working game and see if that's where the problem is because when you have such a rare

[34:36] machine like this the only way to troubleshoot it to identify the problem on on these boards is

[34:43] with another magic girl and just go one to one to see like where is like which thing plugged in

[34:49] stops it from functioning properly it's gonna have to be an arduous drawn out I think

[34:56] process to find the problem and then if we identify that it is the Arduino board I need to figure

[35:02] out like how do you move software from one Arduino board to the other can you do I need the source

[35:07] files from John like will that happen I got to be honest this whole thing this whole thing has

[35:13] completely destroyed my my enjoyment of magic girl it well not like destroyed it I'm not even like

[35:20] that OCD about it it's just it's it's kind of like beyond frustrating where I'm just like all right

[35:26] I'm kind of like well at least the game works I know it's just a lightboard issue and I know

[35:30] lightboard issues have been a problem on a lot of these new games that use them and use PCs to run

[35:36] them look at Wizard of Oz for example but I'm also I'm gonna be honest you know owning a magic girl

[35:44] and I'm the only one who's like really flipping it consistently who plays it a lot if it would just

[35:50] even if it just played the way it did I'd be fine with it you know even incomplete but it is a

[35:56] boxing blink it's a boxing it's a box of lights that are beautiful the arts beautiful the lights

[36:02] are beautiful and the lights go out then it's not that fun anymore because you can't show people

[36:06] the amazing light show and I I gotta get it fixed or I'm gonna get rid of it I mean that's sort of

[36:13] like where I'm at with magic girl I I have no time anymore I don't want I don't want pinball to

[36:20] be a hassle in my life I don't I had a great plan for my my bedroom where magic girl was like

[36:26] the centerpiece of it and that throws a wrench in all of my plans because I I don't want to wake

[36:32] up every day and stare to broken magic girl I just don't and I know you guys feel the same way

[36:36] about pinball in general like there's just there's no room to have a pin in your collection that is

[36:42] just going to cause you headaches gonna cause issues and and and magic girl in particular the

[36:50] kinds of headaches and anxieties owners will face are going to be huge huge if we don't figure out

[36:58] a good support system we already lost the code or to the game he's like quit he's like said he's

[37:03] never going to help us again and so for you magical owners out there like all of us are in this

[37:09] together like we're in this boat together so canators machine going down it does one thing

[37:14] it lowers the value of every single magic girl it just does it it adds anxiety to every magical

[37:21] owner and I want you know and I'm gonna work to get this fixed and I want to find out what the

[37:27] issue was and I want I want to give that fix to every magical owner and I think this is where we're

[37:33] at like we we all need to work together to to try and get these machines better you know

[37:39] functioning better and and operating better or at least like bullet proofing what we do have I

[37:44] mean those are our two options like how can we bullet proof what's here and how can we improve

[37:49] upon was here to make the game better functioning but there's absolutely like zero incentive or

[37:56] motivation by a lot of really smart people in this hobby and the reason why is simple because

[38:02] John burns so many people helping fix magic girl doesn't make people feel good it just doesn't

[38:08] it doesn't it doesn't feel like something that's that's necessary you know what I'm saying you

[38:14] know it's it's not like cactus canyon you know where it didn't get finished but the reason why

[38:19] didn't didn't hurt anybody it's not like King Kong where the reason why I didn't get finished you

[38:24] know it didn't hurt anyone same thing with with Kingpin right all these really rare games big bang

[38:29] bar they they weren't they weren't um they weren't inflicting horrible amounts of pain on on a lot of

[38:36] people but magic girl and John and Zidware have done that um and that's why I know that anything to

[38:44] do with this game is going to be a struggle and I and I was open for it and I am open for it like I

[38:50] know what I got myself into it with this kind of like handmade like one of only 25 in the world

[38:55] machines um but the fact that John is still hiding the fact that nobody really wants to take responsibility

[39:02] for these games the fact that like Dovel thinks people should go talk to John no no Dovel like

[39:08] go talk to John you guys made the machine the way I look at it is this you made the machine with

[39:14] John so if he told me that John worked with with a with a software tech guy who installed all the

[39:19] Arduino boards well look American pinball paid all these people so who was that guy do you have a

[39:26] record of who that was like who who did that who made the plastics who made the ramps who made the

[39:33] play fields who made everything I think American pinball needs to understand that like it or not

[39:39] like it or not they just can't wash their hands clean uh of magic girl support they they really

[39:46] can't they made that because it's because here's the thing there's the only ones who know no one

[39:52] else knows anything no one else knows what's going on and so I'm going to continue to to reach out

[39:59] to Dovel and it like if it's a board issue I know he'll help if it's an Arduino software issue

[40:04] I got to figure out like where we go from there um but I'm not going to stop I'm just going to tell

[40:08] you this I'm not going to stop until we figure out a fix um but I may reach a point I may reach

[40:13] a point where I just say fuck it I'm sick of this shit I'm not doing this anymore I'm going to go

[40:18] by a stern I'm going to go by a dial then I'm going to go by like a libousky and and I'm just going

[40:23] to put like three machines in this apartment that work that have companies behind them that will

[40:28] support it uh and that won't create any headaches or hassles because at the end of the day it's not

[40:33] worth it these are the toys of our lives these aren't uh these aren't necessary things so I don't

[40:39] want to look at something and be frustrated and when a game goes down it is frustrating to stare at

[40:44] something knowing that you don't know how to fix it you know it's not like I'm waiting for a part

[40:47] or I can just go by a part like money can't solve this problem with magic girl um it's it's it's

[40:54] it's gonna take more than money it's gonna take research it's gonna take time it's gonna take

[40:58] troubleshooting um and that will also cost a lot of money that's a that's the shitty part

[41:04] you know I paid a tech already a few in her bucks for no fix he's he's got to come out it's his time

[41:09] he deserves it it's not his fault he didn't make magic girl it's not his fault there's no manual

[41:14] it's not his fault the whole thing is like this daisy chain like kind of fucking mess under there

[41:19] it's not his fault he didn't make it right so that's it we'll see what happens with magic girl

[41:25] but other than that I think we're right at the precipice of a lot of exciting games coming out

[41:31] it's a good time to be in the hobby uh I think you guys are really gonna love the interview with

[41:34] Christopher franshee Chris franshee really interesting guy I enjoy talking to him tremendously

[41:41] that's gonna go up again like Sunday night Monday morning I enjoy your weekend it's a hot one in

[41:46] New York um all of my arcade games are getting moved out today from the apartment I'm working from

[41:52] home today it's a sad day canada's bedroom arcade is no more in in a couple hours so um I can't

[41:59] wait to show you guys well I don't know now like magic girl being broken throws a monkey wrench

[42:03] in all my plans but you'll see one day like what I what I what I do with this apartment but um

[42:08] guys have a good one have a great weekend play some pinball and again I thank all of you for

[42:14] tuning in to canada's pinball podcast on a weekly basis without your support and without your

[42:18] ears I wouldn't be doing this have a good one you and your mind and make sure to have tomorrow

[42:24] with another day in the sunshine fine in the morning and 10 tomorrow is another day
