[00:00] So where's your class if you are wrong and all the right ways are undergone

[00:06] We will never be never be anything but loud

[00:15] Welcome to the end of the year

[00:17] Canada's pinball podcast new year's Eve special show

[00:21] I am so excited for you to listen to this show Mr. Ben Hack joins Canada's pinball podcast because the theme of this show

[00:28] Is it's been one heck of a year and it has and it has and I want to thank all of you who have put up with Canada's pinball podcast for one more year

[00:37] The only pinball podcast where people are trying to get me fire

[00:41] They're trying to ruin my career. They're trying to ruin my life

[00:43] They want to keep this show from being on the airwaves which means one thing

[00:48] I must be doing something right if they want to get this show off the airwaves

[00:53] But we're not going anywhere

[00:54] And I want to raise a glass to all of you out there who listen to Canada's pinball podcast

[00:59] Everyone out there who listens to every single show

[01:02] I want to say from the bottom of my heart

[01:05] You're the reason why I do this show you are the reason why I pick up this mic once a week

[01:10] And I try to find the most captivating and entertaining way to deliver to you

[01:15] What is going on in the pinball world?

[01:18] I know I don't get to interview the pinball royalty of the world

[01:22] But I'm telling you this right now from the bottom of my heart

[01:25] I would rather speak to you and tell you exactly how I feel about stuff

[01:30] Then try and sugarcoat my feeling simply because I want to get people onto this show because you know you listen to this show

[01:37] We still do great interviews

[01:38] We still get great guests on this show and Ben HECK is one of the greatest guests

[01:43] You can have on a pinball show and you're gonna love this episode

[01:46] I love this interview with Ben HECK in which we talk about his new game

[01:49] We talk about the best machines of 2020. I also want to thank each and every one of you out there who hangs out with me on Facebook live

[01:57] If you are not a friend of Canadian pinball podcast on Facebook

[02:01] You should be because a few times a week I go on Facebook live and we just hang out and we talk about pinball

[02:07] We talk about other stuff going on and it is a super awesome time

[02:11] And I enjoy so much of that connection with all of you out there who do that

[02:15] We do it every Saturday morning and we do it throughout the week

[02:18] Because this has been a really rough year for me. It's been a rough year for a lot of you

[02:23] I did not expect to be quarantined basically in a one bedroom apartment in New York City

[02:29] I have a baby on the way. I'm super excited to have my first born enter this crazy world of ours

[02:35] But it's been hard and I mean this when I say this the most devastating thing that happened to me this year

[02:40] Was when people tried to get this show off the airwaves and they tried to room the connection that I have with so many of you

[02:47] Because I tell my beautiful wife Brenda all the time the reason I do this show the reason I love it is for the personal

[02:54] Connections and friendships I've made in this hobby and that is always the most valuable thing in this entire industry

[03:01] I'm gonna tell you this right now

[03:02] I believe so many of these games are pretty mediocre

[03:05] But what's not mediocre is the friendships and the bonds I've made through this hobby and that's what pinball does

[03:12] It brings us together and yes

[03:14] I am always rooting for magical games. I am always rooting for more magic under the glass and more worlds under that glass

[03:21] I'm always rooting for these games to deliver us pinball moments that will blow us away

[03:26] That's what we deserve from the amount of money we spend we deserve to have that kind of experience when we play these

[03:33] Pinball machines and I don't care if that means that designer won't join my show or that guy won't talk to me because I said his

[03:40] Arts sucks or this guy won't come out. I don't care. I don't care. We are gonna keep pushing the only agenda

[03:46] This show has which is to get the most magical pinball machines into your homes and into your locations because that is what we

[03:55] Deserve as the pinball buying community and I do want to say thank you

[03:59] It's the end of the year. I do want to say thank you to all the men and women out there who are part of these pinball companies that make these

[04:05] Products for us to choose from and I mean that and I want to thank them especially this year because most of them had to go into work and do

[04:13] Something that wasn't the safest during a COVID pandemic

[04:16] It was not the safest to go into these companies and build these machines and so many of those men and women you don't know their names

[04:23] You don't you don't know all the people at Stern

[04:26] They have hundreds of people there. There are so many people at Jersey Jack pinball

[04:29] You don't know who they are we always give thanks and praise to the designers and the artist and the coders

[04:35] But they are just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many people

[04:39] There's an army of people out there that I want to say thank you for all the hard work you've done this year

[04:44] I mean that and even if I might say something positive or negative about your product

[04:49] It's a product. We're gonna review it. We're gonna tell you how we feel about it

[04:52] But without you and without your work none of us none of us would be enjoying this hobby the way we do it

[04:59] I want to thank all my friends that create the entertaining content that's out in the world

[05:03] I mean everyone is spoiled right now who comes into the pinball hobby

[05:06] They have so much awesome content to choose from when I first picked up this mic four and a half something years ago

[05:12] There weren't that many shows there wasn't that much to listen to you now

[05:16] There is so much and that's another reason why it's so meaningful to me when I see the amount of people that are still checking out

[05:23] Canadian pinball podcast we've never changed the format

[05:26] It's still just me solo on the mic for the most part talking about pinball

[05:30] And that is why I want to say thank you to everybody out there who is going to vote for Canadian pinball podcast in the twippy's

[05:36] Voting opens up tomorrow January 1st

[05:39] And I know people debate on whether or not you should ask for votes and I want to say this every vote

[05:43] I get does mean a lot to me because I work really hard to create this show

[05:47] But most importantly a vote for Canadian pinball podcast is a vote for you

[05:52] It's a vote for the fans who want to say something to the industry we talk about industry awards

[05:58] Well here's the message that a canada vote sends that we believe that we should have a voice that isn't always cheerleading

[06:04] Everything that happens in this industry that we believe someone should speak up for the ridiculously high prices of all these games

[06:11] That if we're gonna spend a thousand dollars on a topper it should come with what looks like a thousand dollars worth of materials

[06:17] And that's what a vote for Canadian pinball podcast is but ultimately I hope you vote for the show for just one simple reason

[06:24] I hope you find this the most entertaining and enjoyable pinball podcast in the world and chances are if you're listening to this right now

[06:31] You agree everybody have a very happy and healthy new years

[06:35] I really mean that to a better 2021 for all of us may 2021 bring us all together

[06:41] I can't wait to I see all of you at pinball shows again in 2021 and it's gonna get better

[06:47] It is gonna get better so please enjoy this amazing chat with Mr. Ben Hack because it has been

[06:54] one heck of a year

[06:56] All right ladies and gentlemen it's been one heck of a year and I thought what better way to do an end of the year show

[07:02] Than to bring back Mr. Ben Hack to the show Ben welcome to Canadian pinball podcast

[07:07] So because it's been one heck of a year that's it you bring wouldn't it be one more hell of a year

[07:12] But in a negative connotation Ben Helen Dorne so Ben here's what we're gonna do

[07:16] We're gonna talk about what we think were the most impressive pinball

[07:21] releases of the year and we're gonna use the trippy voting sort of categories as our guide

[07:27] But before we do that Ben I want to check in with you and just see what your thoughts are on some of the recent things that have happened in pinball

[07:33] How's that sound yeah sure let's start with deep root

[07:36] So are you surprised to see people pre-ordering deep root not really a lot of them a lot of people are probably you know new

[07:42] Pinball fans. I mean heck even Robert is like that you know

[07:47] He wasn't even into pinball back when John started zidware so it's something shiny you know people go for it now

[07:53] Over the years we've seen this story before where a new company has a new product and

[07:59] Manufacturing is still the most important thing and you're someone who's a maker a builder someone who understands what it takes to make a

[08:06] Machine and get it to market do you feel confident these guys are gonna get this machine to market by March?

[08:11] It's is that too aggressive for them. That's when they're going to start shipping. That's what they said

[08:15] Well, they might get some out the door. I mean I don't think they're gonna how many they sold like 200 allegedly or around there

[08:26] Okay, I don't think they're gonna be able to get them all done in March

[08:28] I could very easily see and see it taking longer

[08:32] Honestly, and if you're gonna make anything more than like 10 or 20 games you might as well making a thousand games

[08:37] Why is that well you have to get a line set up?

[08:40] You know you can't just have people working in stations, you know and you have to you know

[08:44] You have to have an assembly line and have all the parts lined up and and if you want to do it within the experience

[08:50] See it all right, right so I mean it's 200 or 300 is it's pretty good run

[08:56] I just wonder if they're gonna be spooled up in time

[08:59] That's I know I've mentioned that on the on the topic as well

[09:02] But and it's not just like oh we're gonna hire the people

[09:04] But you know are the people experience how many mistakes do they make how many air is do you have how many times do they drop something under the playfield and you have to rebuild the whole game

[09:14] I mean I was down at spooky couple weeks ago when you're talking about

[09:17] Boards and whatnot and most of it was I mean this isn't really nothing against the workers

[09:20] But most of it was okay. How do we resolve this when someone screws it up?

[09:25] I mean a lot of it was like basically just making it as simple as possible for the manufacturers

[09:29] And you know spooky's been doing it for years now. It's a great challenge

[09:33] And the way they're doing it is they are going to see how many raza orders they get by December 30th

[09:39] And that's the cut-off date which is today I believe and then ultimately

[09:44] If you're in Australia right and

[09:47] Ostensibly then Robert probably is taking that number and ordering parts to build that many games

[09:53] And he said no more than 300 like how long would it take for a company to order specialized parts for a game?

[10:00] I would say they would probably already have to have to have them ordered now

[10:03] I know like like P rock like comes from China

[10:06] I want to say the lead time on that for large orders is something like four months

[10:10] I think I don't know but I think they're still using John's rip off of p rock that was made by that

[10:15] Captain Nemo guy. I'm sure that's why that's probably the secret reason why Jerry doesn't want anything to do with them

[10:20] Right well how many custom mechs are in that game?

[10:23] They've got like the World Cup soccer target and that I got the pin bar

[10:27] Which is they probably have ordered a bunch of those because that's in every single game moving forward for deep route

[10:32] Right you wouldn't have to burn the stock if you didn't sell enough for Raza

[10:37] Yeah, it's a good point like yeah, you could order multiples of the cabinet

[10:41] I'm just trying to think I

[10:43] Had honestly be surprised if they I mean they might trickle some out the door in March

[10:46] But have they hired production like you have they hired manufacturing professionals or production experts or anything like that

[10:52] Yeah, that was the question I was gonna ask you is being at a company when you were at spook at the very beginning

[10:57] How long does it take to train people get the line tooled up?

[11:01] Is that something that takes a few weeks? Is it something that takes a month before you feel good about it?

[11:05] Well, you know spook kind of did it by their bootstraps, you know, so to speak which because they didn't have any money while they had very little money and

[11:13] But back then America's most hot honnets sold slowly, but that was okay because they couldn't build them fast either

[11:19] You know if you if we were what a sold 300 units right off the bat

[11:22] We would have been in the same boat as like the diglabowski people right or

[11:27] Predator even though you were very um, you know

[11:29] You were very nostertomous like when you said look at this skull on the kitchen counter

[11:33] This guy doesn't have the license nobody listened to at least we saw a skull on a counter

[11:39] We haven't seen anything over a deep route in terms of their production line anything

[11:43] Yeah, and that's the most important thing and apparently it's a patented secret

[11:47] It's like, oh, I mean, I don't know I

[11:49] He I get the impression with deep route that they think that are you know Steve Jobs or Apple

[11:54] Which everybody wants to say so what is he also think he's Henry Ford?

[11:57] I mean, how can you really as some people is that how do you really innovate?

[12:01] Scrooing wood or screen things into wood right right I mean

[12:06] They might have you know, maybe they have more modular connectors

[12:09] But that actually has its own set of problems. That's what Andrew Highway tried like those things they can actually fail faster than

[12:17] Sottered joints like they can come loose or they can you know come to attach and shipping when he had that demo video

[12:23] I remember where he was showing the cabinet. I think the cabinet's really cool, right?

[12:26] Yeah, looks great the game looks great the game it like let's face the John is doing once again

[12:31] What John always does he gets people to give money because of how sexy the games look?

[12:37] Yeah, I mean again

[12:38] Obviously he pissed them off too much, but American Pimblehold could have kept him on as a you know like a art director

[12:44] And he would have excelled in that role

[12:46] But of course, you know you they were too pissed at him to do that and you know

[12:50] That would be a good role for him

[12:52] I just there's a lot of things I see with deep route where it just seems like he's doing a lot more than that even like act on

[12:57] Manufacturing I mean that's just John pulling words out of his butt

[13:00] Robert said that was a joke

[13:02] He said there is quiet manufacturing and that means that they're gonna have four different stations within the company where four different

[13:09] Components are made so like the wood over here the electronics over here the mechs over here

[13:14] So he was making a joke

[13:16] I think the thing is with so much hyperbole

[13:18] No one knows what's a joke and what serious all they want is a game to come out. Yes

[13:23] Yeah, I mean it's not looking even need that big of a line like if anything like again

[13:28] I think about spooky which is probably the closest in terms of volume right now because

[13:32] Because you know you got stern then you got cgc slash jjp probably about the same and a lot of it is just where you store things like you know

[13:40] Like you know

[13:41] Well, where you put all the games where you stage the games spooky is already talking about building on again

[13:46] For instance, you know as far as the actual playful construction that doesn't necessarily take a lot of room

[13:51] But you still have to have a pipeline for it like oh

[13:54] So this thing if you have one part missing you can't make the game right and then it's like at this traffic jam of all

[13:59] And it's not like there's a lot pads or cell phones like this traffic jam of these huge cabinets

[14:03] Trying to come in the door and you know if you're missing to me to put them out the door

[14:06] You're gonna be in trouble even if they're like okay

[14:08] Let's see. Oh, we're gonna sell 100 or we're gonna sell 200 we're gonna sell 300

[14:11] Well, I found out how many we're gonna sell and then we get our orders in and also scale for manufacturing

[14:15] Even then you'd think they would have to be ordering stuff already right people have forgotten when I interviewed them on my show

[14:22] They said any orders of our games will be shipped to customers within two weeks and

[14:28] Someone needs to go back and pull all of my sound clips from those interviews and and hold them

[14:34] Accountable to some of those promises, but my stern stern doesn't even doesn't even do that. I mean the distributors might

[14:39] No, there's no pointing in actually setting a finite date because then you're you're never delayed if you don't put a data

[14:45] Into the world so

[14:47] Speaking of games. How is your game coming along, Ben? I know you were looking for an illustrator. Have you found your artist yet?

[14:54] I think I know who they're gonna use yes, and it's been put into CAD right now

[14:58] And I think they're started they have the first toy done. I think they've started on the next

[15:03] I'm actually probably gonna head down there in a few weeks and talk with the mechanical designer and some stuff

[15:07] So it isn't progress. Yes, okay is David feel providing any music for your game?

[15:13] I think he might help out. I I'm not sure yet. I know he's freelance. That's why I know he doesn't he's not beholden to

[15:22] Deeper. Oh by the way, I should say maybe if I forget this for the twitties

[15:26] I think you should get best vocabulary award for the twitties

[15:30] You're being facetious. So let me ask you

[15:34] Let me ask you yesterday. I said I had to change it

[15:37] I said fondue instead of fondant in terms of what you pull over a cake to decorate it

[15:43] Yeah, that's fondant. Yeah, it's not fondue man the world would be so much better though if we poured fondue on top of cake

[15:50] But I always make fun of of my misuse of words every once in a while

[15:53] So let me ask you a question. Do you feel confident your game is slated for 2021 or is it 2022 at this point?

[16:01] Oh gosh

[16:03] I could see it slipping into 2022. Okay. Why do you feel that way? Well, it just I took them all out to get the license nailed down

[16:10] And I know they've started working on the on the play field and whatnot

[16:14] Yeah, I mean it doesn't really matter to me. I can I can be patient

[16:18] I've already waited like two years. I think I was supposed to come out in 2018

[16:22] So you know, I'll just do other things in the meantime. It's not a big deal

[16:25] So how does it work? How do you come into this process? So they're doing stuff. What are you doing right now on the game?

[16:30] Well, I did a lot of it. I'm basically working with

[16:34] Pete to try to you know basically to get the mechs done and whatnot

[16:37] But you know, he's an old-school Williams engineer guy. So obviously he's gonna do better job than I I did

[16:42] So you know, I basically did the concepts for the mechs although

[16:46] Yeah, I think we have to do we have to tweak a few of the things like it's like

[16:49] Oh, you know because of our cabinet we can't fit this much behind the backboard. Oh, okay

[16:54] So we'll move it this far forward, but in order to do that

[16:56] We have to make sure the shot is still smooth. Well since we did that we have to move this other thing and

[17:02] You know that kind of stuff happens, but you know, I'm completely open to it

[17:05] You know open to like other people's suggestions as long as you know as long as they're pretty decent because obviously you know

[17:10] Most of them have more experience than I do right. Yeah, just so long as you know the toys

[17:14] I mean one of the toys I am you know, I think it you know well just well after you know run it a million times and see if it's

[17:20] It's reliable, but my goal is to have it be a very mechanically satisfying game on the play field

[17:26] Okay, now this is a collaboration between CDC and spooky. How does that work? Like who's doing the work right now?

[17:32] Where's the work happening?

[17:33] Uh right now, but mostly is at CGC and most of it is Pete who's the contract engineer

[17:38] He's the one working on it at the moment as I mentioned

[17:40] I'm planning to head down there in a few weeks because I don't think I don't think he actually because I was talking to him

[17:44] I didn't realize he wasn't at CGC itself and I'm like oh Doug should have this macro this foam core mockup

[17:50] He's like oh, I actually work from home. I don't have that. I'm like oh, okay, so but actually I'm gonna spooky last week

[17:55] Up in there up in their loft of doom. We found some of the original foam core mockups

[18:01] They're in the back of my car so I'll probably just oh it's starting to snow

[18:04] I'll probably just take those down when the time comes. I know they're still I think they're switching their main CPU core

[18:11] I get out I want to talk about it too much

[18:14] But at some point I will have to be brought to speed with their operating system because I'm going to be coding my own game

[18:20] Because that was one of the things people liked the most about america's most haunted was the code

[18:24] I thought they love the artwork the most

[18:26] You know

[18:27] You know

[18:29] It could be worse. I mean it's October fest is worse my vocabulary or the artwork on america's most haunted no

[18:35] But but then question are you next in the roster after what most likely will be cactus cannon or are you the game after the next game?

[18:44] Think I'm the game after the game. Okay. I built yeah

[18:46] I said it's another remake and then I pretty sure it's an original title or I'm sorry and a license not a remake and then it would be mine

[18:55] Okay, I don't know I have enough crap to do

[18:57] I mean I'm not like I'm not like a designer who like just has to work endlessly. I mean whatever

[19:02] I made enough money. Let me ask you a question about the theme

[19:05] Are you happy with the theme and are you happy with the integration with the theme?

[19:08] So do you feel like you're you're gonna get the the right amount of assets to make this theme come to life?

[19:13] hmm

[19:14] There well assets can be very limiting

[19:17] There are some licenses where they'll give you the whole thing

[19:19] They'll give you all the um all the clips the entire movie and then there's some licenses like this one

[19:25] where I have to go through and watch the master you know the master you know the time code that starts at one hour that that whole thing

[19:31] And then pick out a certain amount of time

[19:34] Yeah, but the thing is I'm not really too worried about that

[19:36] I'm not thinking about the screen that much and I also have an idea of how to ex while not extend the footage

[19:42] But how to supplement it because I believe we're going with a wide screen kind of like the bigger the fancy version of like monster bash

[19:50] But slightly taller because you know how they use the LCD to light up the uh Williams logo or wherever that usually is

[19:56] You know yep, so the LCD is taller than you can see

[20:00] So I believe for my game and probably the other one as well like after the remake

[20:04] They're going to basically open up the aperture a little vertically

[20:06] Which is cool because I like that aspect ratio. I mean it's kind of like what deep-root has except for it be taller

[20:12] Right, I think that's more interesting than like having a big you know 16 by 9 square

[20:16] Well rectangle in your back box. Well, I just think it's exciting Ben that you are saying that you want more of the game

[20:22] And more of the theme to come to life physically under the glass versus just on the screen

[20:26] Do you think that is something that when you look at a lot of games today

[20:30] There's way too much emphasis on the screen and not as much emphasis on what's physically on the game

[20:35] Like I was thinking about that with guns and roses. Obviously the new one not the data east one

[20:40] You know, there's lots of stuff on the screen, but the play field is so lively

[20:44] You don't even really need to look at the play field even though there aren't really any toys per say that you know

[20:50] Interact with the ball. It's still you can get all of your enjoyment from there, right?

[20:54] Absolutely. I think sometimes like when you pull more stuff out of the game

[20:57] And I know I think Al's Cooper had an issue with this is like oh, we got to you know

[21:01] We got to make the magic happen on the screen and you know, I mean they did really great great job of the animation

[21:07] Or black night was the same thing

[21:09] But I don't know it's a pinball machine, right?

[21:11] I think that's a problem you have all these ancient designers

[21:14] You know who are all you know, they're all old and they think oh what do kids like oh they like cell phones, right?

[21:23] Well, we're making the pinbar, but they what they don't realize is young people on location

[21:28] They walk up to a pinball machine and enjoy it because it isn't

[21:31] A screen you're right. It's like oh look at this cool throwback thing. It's a mechanical game under glass

[21:38] This is cool right and I don't think the old people realize that they they're trying to they're trying to make pinball into something

[21:43] They think the kids want but were kids like pinball because it's something that it's not what they're used to right

[21:48] It's the same reason they're obsessed with vcrs and taper quarters just like our parents were obsessed with cowboys

[21:54] Yeah, yeah, no

[21:55] I've always felt like there's too much emphasis on the screen and when I talk to Ryan who's making the sonic the hedgehog machine

[22:02] I think he said something very very important

[22:04] He said when you're a kid you walk up to a pinball machine and you just want to see something fun in the game

[22:09] And you want to interact with it with the ball in a very analog way and so with your game

[22:14] Do you have one sort of main mech that is the highlight of your machine that people are gonna be like wow

[22:20] What's that yeah? I do or I should say we do because obviously it's gonna take a team to make it happen

[22:26] Because I want like the big dumb dumb shot as I like to call it right

[22:30] So like you hit that something happens, but it also has some negative feedback

[22:34] But I guess you'll see when and when it's made

[22:36] Yeah, and then there's also a new thing

[22:39] Yeah, there's also a few other things where the toys interact with the ball you know

[22:44] If the ball isn't really affecting the toy

[22:47] You know like the weight of it or moving but you know the mechanism make it look like it is right like I think a pinball machine

[22:54] Should be like a little Disney world underglash or the bunch of like tricks, you know I agree

[22:59] I that's all I want I know I asked for a lot

[23:01] I want that in every game and I want the game to have moments now

[23:04] I've been talking a lot about this recently where pinball moments are where the magic lies and you brought up a good point with

[23:10] GnR

[23:11] It's not just that mechs equal moments

[23:14] It's the overall experience of how a game makes you feel and I think that matters more than score

[23:20] And I think there's so much emphasis on scoring and multipliers and rule sets and not enough emphasis on pinball moments

[23:27] How do you feel about that statement? Oh, I would agree definitely. I mean, it's like it's like a movie or a book

[23:32] You know if it's a form of art really the ultimate expression that you should receive from it is emotion right right and like you get to like live and let die in

[23:41] GnR and it's just it's just I don't want to see it's like say it's like transcendent

[23:45] But it's it's really cool. You're like you don't you don't care that there's just a static hat and a static skeleton because it feels alive

[23:53] You're like oh my god. I'm a rock star, you know like you you feel awesome when you're playing it

[23:57] And you know, oh, I gotta keep playing because I gotta see what it does next. I gotta get to the song

[24:01] You know, it's a very guitar hero

[24:03] So have you played this game a lot or you just talk about it all time? No, I played it for about four hours straight when it first came out

[24:09] And you what you just said there is exactly why my hypothesis is that so many of these games are being coded by hardcore tournament players

[24:19] And if you think about it who gets excited about 10 times x who gets excited about stacking multipliers

[24:25] It's tournament players, but emotionally everyone else who loves pinball is left completely unsatisfied when those are the main moments coded into these games

[24:35] Right, and then I mean look at somebody like math wars versus Jurassic Park from stern

[24:40] And you know stern has you know, oh, there's a dinosaur. There's a helicopter. There's a raptor pin

[24:45] You know, there's ways you can interact with the story that's on the play field it like really turn them into sight

[24:50] If you're playing a pinball machine a new during really well, you have no idea what your score is

[24:54] Now, but the game the play field should be giving you the feedback that you know your kicking butt, right?

[25:00] Yeah, again, it's more about a feeling than a score because really

[25:03] Score is like it's like money, right? It really is meaningless, right? Like like how much you make an hour

[25:09] I know that sounds a little silly, but it's the value behind it like you know, the number it's just a number, right?

[25:14] So it's like oh, you know, we got a jjp game with 10,000 points

[25:17] You got a stern game with 10 billion points who cares? It's like how does the game make you feel are having fun?

[25:22] Are you enjoying it? Is it executing the theme well? I think that's what really matters and I keep I just keep trying to you know

[25:28] I'm I'm 45. I'm not like that young anymore, but I do think about like okay

[25:33] What what the young people like and I also I'll watch like a lot of millennial YouTube channels and yeah

[25:39] They're really obsessed with this world that predated them this mechanical world and I that's what I want to try to accomplish

[25:45] Like basically tell a story with tricks and mechanics that can also have good flow and be excited and then

[25:52] Yes for the hardcore players you put in deeper strategy that will make them happy

[25:56] But you know, just just for the walk-up factor this got to be you know, this got to be big

[26:00] That was one thing I had an issue with alien, which I Hilton had one so I played it quite a few times is

[26:05] You know, there was an alien mouth, right? It should have been like bam bam bam it grabs the ball, right?

[26:09] It should have been the dumb dumb shot

[26:11] But there's all this stuff you have to you know qualify and then doesn't even work, right?

[26:16] I don't know that's what that's what I like about games is like you walk up to it and you just understand what to do

[26:22] Just by looking at like it and also like I talked about this like I we talked about how I wanted

[26:26] I thought it would make a rampage pin right where the diagesis. There's a word for you

[26:31] Of the Pimma machine fits the theme like oh, I'm physically destroying something like a wrecking ball

[26:36] Smashing right? So I angry birds would have been a cool pinball right?

[26:40] Imagine a rampage machine in which you bash the buildings and and then they fall down into the perfect

[26:46] Oh, yeah, I was coming up with prototypes right even I was gonna have

[26:49] LCD like so you have like a building right and you have three of them right and they can ratchet up to different heights

[26:55] So when you go to new city you change the lighting of the play field

[26:58] You could connect to the internet and simulate the weather from the city

[27:01] Then you then you spawn the buildings like maybe this one's five stories this one's three stories and this one's ten

[27:06] And then you're gonna love this so you have like the front of the buildings actually an LCD, right?

[27:12] So you can draw in different like window shapes

[27:15] Then you could put a different sign at the top so like you come to this city

[27:18] Oh, and the three buildings is the DMV the IRS and a bank that's where you got to destroy in this city, right?

[27:23] And then you can animate little people like silhouettes running in the windows

[27:27] And then you hit the buildings and then the windows break like break break break break all the windows are break and then it falls down

[27:32] And then the people are like oh and you get you get a hurry up once the buildings about to crumble

[27:37] You can see the people evacuated and the faster you completely destroyed the building before ever and evacuates would be a bonus like a

[27:42] Re-up bonus and it's all on the play field

[27:45] Why aren't you making this game? Why aren't you doing this come on Ben bring it to us

[27:49] I mentioned it to Charlie, but Charlie is so tired of working with Warner Brothers

[27:54] Right, so maybe it you know, maybe I should just build it on my own

[27:57] Oh, and then it was gonna have like kind of an iron monitor come out of the middle play field

[28:00] And that would be like get the giant atomic monster fighting robot, you know kind of like a play on Pacific Rim

[28:06] Right, so like every three cities you'd have to fight this monster robot

[28:10] Yeah, but talking to Charlie about it. I'm like, he's like well

[28:13] Why don't you make a generic monster game on my Charlie because if you call the game rampage

[28:16] You do not have to explain it to people you recognize the power of theme every time we talk

[28:21] We always talk about it the theme moves product. It's what people want. It's what people have an emotional connection to

[28:28] Yeah, so Ben let's let's talk quickly about Led Zeppelin because that just came out

[28:32] I want to get your thoughts on it and then we're gonna go through the best of

[28:35] 2020 and give our picks for what we think should win in each of these categories. How does that sound?

[28:40] Yeah, I can't call if I played every game, but I'll do the best I can

[28:44] Everybody's in the same boat. It's gonna be a weird year for voting for stuff because I think most people haven't jumped on every machine

[28:50] So a lot of it's just gonna be from what we've seen in streams and from what we've seen on twitch and and whatnot

[28:56] So yeah, cuz usually we'd see them all at shows absolutely

[28:59] That's why I feel bad about every new game whether it's Avengers or Guns and Roses

[29:03] There would have been thousands of people who would have played all of these games multiple times

[29:09] By December right now. It's just a few hundred

[29:12] It's like 10% of the potential reach of these games and I'll also like location play is dead

[29:17] So you're not even getting people out in location

[29:19] I know some states are open, but for the most part barcades have been shut down for like eight nine months

[29:25] Yeah, I mean you're probably a little biased because you're in New York and are more open than that. Oh, yeah

[29:30] Like here. I mean you have to wear a mask, but we've been pretty much open since June

[29:34] Ben let's talk about Led Zeppelin

[29:36] So what did you think when Led Zeppelin was revealed? What are your thoughts on that title?

[29:40] Well, I didn't I haven't played it right

[29:43] My initial thought was this and looks incredibly empty sorted black night like the non-LE version of black night

[29:49] Just looked ridiculously empty right I

[29:52] But I saw that I'm like oh so they gave them the bill materials for the night and then nothing else

[29:56] It's kind of sad and so Led Zeppelin

[29:59] It looks really empty and then they basically got looks like iron monger, but now he's a spinner that comes out of it

[30:05] If you have the good version right the artwork. It's obviously that you know style guy out artwork

[30:10] Like this is what it has to be and nothing else kind of like Game of Thrones

[30:14] Which isn't really Stern's fault. I mean I guess is there fault if they choose to work with a license out restrictive

[30:19] But so notwithstanding the limitations that went into the artwork. It's

[30:25] Not you know it doesn't look very good

[30:27] You know at least like supreme there's like an aesthetic reason to make your pimo machine look like that

[30:31] This was just like yeah, yeah, it's visually underwhelming

[30:36] From a mechanical standpoint. I think it's also a little bit underwhelming

[30:40] It's gonna play fast. It's gonna play like every Steve Richie pin

[30:43] But I just think people are looking for more especially when it's these themes like Led Zeppelin like once in an eternity

[30:50] You're gonna make a Led Zeppelin pinball machine for a band that has sold 300 million albums

[30:55] And this is the best the pinball world can do to pay tribute to that band. Ah not good enough

[31:00] And then you don't have a starway to heaven in it right and Guns and Roses does not help their cause with that coming out

[31:05] Just a few months earlier and showing us what a concert in unbox can be so

[31:11] Speaking of Guns and Roses, let's do this. Let's jump into the best of 2020

[31:14] Let's first go down a list of the games Ben that we think are eligible for the awards this year. Does that sound good?

[31:21] Yeah, so stranger things stranger things

[31:25] Stranger things we've got let's do the Stern titles first. We got stranger things

[31:29] We've got Ninja Turtles. Yeah, we've got heavy metal

[31:33] We've got I forgot about that. I know everyone does we've got Avengers and we've got Led Zeppelin

[31:39] Am I missing anything? I think Star Wars the

[31:43] What was it the comic book came out too, but I don't know if that counts

[31:46] That's four cornerstone games in one year. Yeah, okay, so that's Stern then over at Haggis pinball

[31:53] We have Celts which is new this year which also shipped this year. We have let's see at Chicago gaming company

[32:00] I don't know if anything's new. I don't know if they're gonna allow medieval madness royal as a game this year

[32:06] So I don't think that game is up for any awards. Yeah, you're right. I don't think they actually had a new launch this year

[32:13] No, we've waited we've waited and we've waited maybe make you best topper. I mean their toppers are amazing

[32:18] They are amazing

[32:19] You can't play the topper though. Obviously the juggernaut launch this year was Guns and Roses from Jersey Jack pinball and

[32:27] Who am I missing here? We had hot wheels from American pinball?

[32:31] Did Ricka Morty come on this year? Yes, Rick and Morty from spooky pinball. Okay, so I think those are gonna be the main ones

[32:37] I don't think I'm missing anything. We're not gonna count and about to be again. Do we count Raza?

[32:42] No, it hasn't shipped, but I think Raza might be eligible for stuff like artwork

[32:48] I'm not sure if the game has to ship in that year

[32:51] If we want to give Raza an award we can let's just let's just play fair. We'll throw him into the rain

[32:56] Is it like the Oscars where it just has a play in one theater before the last two weeks of the year?

[33:00] Right

[33:01] And studio strategically released it just in that time to be eligible

[33:06] All right, so the first category is best music and sound effects in pinball what game this year? Do you think had the best music and sound effects?

[33:13] Ah

[33:15] I'm trying to think

[33:17] Ricka Morty had pretty good sound and custom speech, you know like what's his face?

[33:21] What's a guy's name Justin Roland?

[33:23] He did all that custom speech. I know they I don't think they were able to use all of it because

[33:28] Because Warner Brothers. Oh, man. It's like AT&T bought them and they went from Warner Brothers to hold my beer

[33:34] It's like well, that's a different subject

[33:36] Yeah, I mean Scotts game has always sound amazing, right?

[33:40] Yeah, that would probably be pretty high my list. I mean guns and roses obviously it's a really really good concert in a box

[33:46] But it is based off music that's pre-existing so I don't know if you can necessarily

[33:49] Say that's an accomplishment of the pinball machine itself

[33:52] Yeah, I agree with you. I think this is going to be one of those categories where

[33:55] Obviously studio material from Led Zeppelin and guns and roses

[34:00] Exceeds Scott Denise's ability to make music. Yeah, but but I would agree with you

[34:05] I think the best music and sound effects in pinball should go to Rick and Morty

[34:09] Because of the score in it and all the original music and I love the sound effects that happen in all the different dimensions

[34:16] And I think that studio material isn't it's kind of cheating when it comes to this category

[34:22] Because I think this is stuff that should be originally created for pinball

[34:25] So we agree on on Rick and Morty for best music and sound effects

[34:30] So the next category best toys and gimmicks in a game which game band you think has the coolest mech or something in it

[34:37] That's a gimmick that just wowes you the projector and stranger things works better than you think it would if you see it in person

[34:44] Okay, is that your pick? Well, I

[34:47] Just thought I would bring it up because I'm the Oop the demigorgan is revealed and the demigorgan is awful

[34:53] What about the UV kit though? I mean is that more impressive than the projector?

[34:56] I haven't seen it with the UV kit. Oh, wasn't that they already had UV reactive ink which is kind of stupid because all sorts of things react to UV

[35:03] You know they probably just realized that a certain color on it reacted to UV

[35:08] You know, it's like oh, it's a hidden feature and we're so we're thinking so far ahead of our time

[35:12] Um, I'm just saying if you played it even in a reasonably well lit game room it actually works pretty well

[35:18] I don't think the game itself is very good

[35:20] But it was an interesting innovation on Stern's part and I think companies could do more with projection mapping and pinball in the future again

[35:26] Go to Disney World is projection mapping everywhere right

[35:30] Okay, so are you picking that?

[35:31] I'm not sure if you're picking it or just like reminding us that it has like well

[35:34] What else came out for toys and Mac for this one the game that are the most toys in it

[35:40] Probably Ninja Turtles if you look at all the stuff that was in the Ninja Turtle premium NLE

[35:44] Yeah, you had the spinning magnet pizza you had the diverter you had the turtle van had a lot of toys in it like

[35:52] If you're just if this is yeah, but did they interact with the ball?

[35:56] Well, and that's the thing is is the word best is really the most interesting thing here because you could say that

[36:01] Man is a is the light show in GnR gimmick, but there is a best light show category

[36:06] So I don't think people are gonna vote for it in this category. I would pick ninja turtles for this just because of all the games

[36:12] That came out this year. I do think turtles just has the most toys and gimmicks by the definition of what a toy in a gimmick is

[36:19] Okay, you know, I'm gonna you know, I'm gonna go with stranger things just because I think even though obviously

[36:24] Obviously brine-edity did not invent projection mapping. I think I was innovative to put that into a pin

[36:29] I'm gonna go with that even though it's not really a toy

[36:31] This is a good category. I'm curious to see what wins this year best theme of 2020 in pinball. Why don't you go first?

[36:38] Oh, I'm sure Rick and Morty will get it. I agree. I absolutely agree

[36:42] I mean people didn't see the machine. It's sold out in just four hours

[36:47] It's such a perfect theme for pinball. Will it win best theme integration? That's good

[36:51] I don't think it's going to and but it's great

[36:53] It's gonna win the best theme though because it's original and it's the perfect theme for pinball

[36:58] And I think everyone would agree with that. Okay, we agree on that one. Yeah

[37:02] Best theme integration is the next one. This is like best movie, but not best director, you know

[37:08] So well, that's true because the best picture not Oscar goes to the producer not the director

[37:14] Right, so what do you think the best theme integrated pin of 2020 was?

[37:18] Oh, I'm just trying to think I think this is a runaway easy selection. Come on

[37:23] Yeah, I'm probably gonna say guns and roses. It's so easy

[37:26] Easy when everybody's trying to please make absolutely. I think I've only played Avengers and news articles once they actually have the

[37:32] Mon location here

[37:33] But that was also the same time I played a guns and roses for the first time and I honestly wasn't that interested in like Avengers and turtles

[37:39] Also because they're both kind of too cartoony. I mean, I you know, I love the news turtles when I was a kid

[37:44] I still think the first movie holds up

[37:46] But I don't know. I just was they were both a little too cartoony for me

[37:50] I just kept on playing guns and roses. So the guns and roses is gonna go down as probably

[37:55] Maybe the best theme integrated pinball machine of all time because slash made the game with them

[38:02] And I know it's a music pin

[38:04] There have been other great theme integrated pins, but never before have we seen such access to a theme

[38:10] The way they had access to G and R and so I think that's gonna win hands down. All right

[38:15] So we agree G and R are best animations and display

[38:22] Don't give it the hot wheels

[38:25] Well, well

[38:28] Just Rick and Morty have a lot of they just use clips from the show, right? Yeah, there's there's there's some animated stuff going on over the show clips

[38:36] But there's not a ton of original what got it last year Jurassic Park

[38:41] Uh last year Willy Wonka won it last year really just inched out Jurassic Park by 0.03 percent

[38:48] It got 23.6 to Jurassic Park's 23.3. Oh, I thought Jurassic Park had better presentation than Willy Wonka at least on the screen

[38:57] I mean I mean they had to make it all from scratch, but well, I know you've talked about Willy Wonka's theme integration to no end

[39:03] Um

[39:05] Shit, I forgot what were we talking about what's the best animations and display? Oh, let me just think

[39:10] Well, I like you know what I'm gonna give it to guns and roses again because I love when they take your video footage

[39:16] And they put you in the show, you know, they're like oh look you're on stage, right?

[39:20] And then they take your image and they put you if you get like a high score they put you on a VIP pass can us next to slash right

[39:27] So it doesn't pretty good job of putting you in the game

[39:29] I'm like the animation of G and R they're good. I mean they're not like amazing, but they're all well rendered the animation style is consistent

[39:37] I'm American pinball and uh you've noticed

[39:40] Is it just me or does Axel Rose now look like a younger Trump you ever noticed that go ahead kind of

[39:45] We're not gonna go there. I think G and R is gonna win and I'll tell you why so I do think the animations in this game are really good

[39:52] Jump is a jump all the guy who does JJP's animations. He has a huge fan base and following

[39:57] But here's the other part of this category when it comes to the display itself the G and R display with the HD concert footage

[40:06] And they don't overcrowd the screen for once finally Jersey jack lets that big screen just saying and and it's perfect

[40:15] Like when you stand back and watch someone play G and R it just looks so good

[40:20] Yeah, that's got really good graphic elements like when you collect a band members

[40:24] It's like the bullets being loaded into the revolver and then Alex is the you know the one in the middle

[40:28] He's like the Axel oh

[40:31] Right see what they did there, you know, so yeah, not only is it not overstuffed

[40:36] But the iconography even though it's heavily borrowed from like a tar hero games it works right

[40:41] All right, this category is gonna be one that I think we're gonna agree on best callouts in a machine

[40:48] Oh Rick and Morty easily easily. I mean it's it's like the most custom speech and psych what stern spider man

[40:55] Right and also probably the funniest callouts in pinball history hands down

[41:01] Rick and Morty is gonna win this those callouts are some of the best elements of the game

[41:05] Incredible callouts. Yeah, I think that's something people don't appreciate with spooky

[41:09] I mean Alice Cooper himself didn't do the greatest job, which is a little weird considering his talk show

[41:14] But yeah, I know spooky did like you know we had Rob Zombie then we got

[41:19] Yeah, we got Justin Royal in and so they've actually done really well with like custom callouts in in games

[41:25] Or new callouts well, what I love about the callouts and Rick and Morty is is how they're so tailored to pinball

[41:32] They even have lion man jokes and it's just such a perfect sort of bringing that property

[41:38] To the world of pinball and saying stuff that pinball fanatics would just find incredible

[41:43] And then that's why it's so cool. All right best light show in a game. I think this is another one. That's easy winner. Yeah

[41:50] The greatest light show in the history of pinball guns and effin roses

[41:54] Oh, yeah, it's guns and roses obvious guns and I am sorry scapegoons and roses makes TNA look like a light bright

[42:01] man

[42:02] Well, it just makes everything it makes everything look so

[42:07] Outdated when it comes to presentation it does and I played it at jack bar and and Ben

[42:12] I'm not overhyping it right

[42:14] I mean when you play this game in a dark room and you stand over any other of the new games out there

[42:20] They look old compared to it especially once you get a song going

[42:24] I would say one caveat you know like the light strips on the side which is just neopixels

[42:29] In person they tend to look a little bit more like isolated balls of light whereas when you see an unvideo it tends to smear

[42:35] Into the lens a little bit more and look like more of an aura um so that part of it might look a little less impressive

[42:40] In person is because the way our eyes work versus cameras, but still yes

[42:43] Once you get a song going the light shows are different for every song and the light show changes as a song goes right

[42:50] Which is you know especially cool and live in light die because you know something mccartney songs

[42:53] So it's like four songs in one right and it's yeah

[42:56] It just really makes you feel like you're there and it's just fun

[42:58] And you know even though I said there's not really a lot of toys to interact with the ball

[43:02] There are a lot of like diverters gates

[43:05] Uh the symbol thing is cool the spinner. There's a spinner under the axe. Oh no, I'll slash his hat

[43:10] I love the chrome like the chrome frets. They just look so good everything about it just looks like quality

[43:16] You know what I mean? It's next level and I keep telling people this until you stand over when you're not gonna

[43:21] Understand I'm not chilling for jjp nobody gives that company more crap than me over the years

[43:26] But when you oh yeah

[43:28] When you play gnr and I say this every song in that game is its own separate moment

[43:35] And the way they code the lights and the experience around each track makes it like 21 different

[43:41] Incredible moments in one game and and that whole toy

[43:45] I mean I mean the whole game is the toy the whole game is the mech it's supposed to be like a

[43:50] Concert going experience and I think they knocked it out of the park. It's possible

[43:54] They also dialed back on the toys a little bit because of the issues they have in pirates

[43:59] You know, they probably wanted Eric to be a little bit more conservative

[44:02] But yeah again the game it really wows you and even stuff like like

[44:06] What's someone that they have down at spooky? They have the one that has the album artwork on the sides right? Yeah

[44:12] And something like yeah, even something like that you'd think that would be kind of normally you'd be like

[44:16] Oh, that's not a good choice. You know, it's that's lazy art

[44:19] But in person it looks really good, you know like because all the all the

[44:23] Album covers are somewhat desaturated so they kind of blend into the same color of the background

[44:28] So it yeah, it just looks really good in person. It has meaning too, right?

[44:32] Those are the cities that Guns of Rose is went to and those are the actual tour posters from all the different locations for not in this lifetime tour

[44:41] And what's cool about that is when you hear people who are buying this machine

[44:44] They love the fact that like Detroit's represented or Australia or New York or Chicago and and that's really cool

[44:52] I mean we haven't really seen a game that's used the official tour posters

[44:56] Which are so much better than like the crappy Led Zeppelin artwork. Why didn't they pull from different Led Zeppelin

[45:03] Source material. It just kills me when I see that game. Well, there's probably more guns and roses source material

[45:09] No, there's way more Led Zeppelin albums than G and R. Oh, D&R is like a little bit of a flash in the pan ban

[45:15] I mean they only from 86 to 90 like two was really their heyday. Yeah

[45:22] Democracy for 15 loves Chinese democracy. All right best rules in a pinball game band best rules. What do you think? Oh gosh

[45:29] I don't think I've played any of them deeply enough to appreciate that

[45:32] You know what let's just go with guns and roses because I like how you have to earn the song like you have to collect the band members

[45:38] Right and they load into the gun which is a great animation and then it's like okay

[45:42] We've got the band together now we can play the song right so you don't just randomly get the song and you're playing the background

[45:47] It's like you had to build up to it is kind of weird how you can fail you can kind of you can basically guitar hero it

[45:53] You know and I would say sometimes the light show works against actually knowing what target to hit you know

[46:00] Because everything is going like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, like bonkers and it's like what inserts are actually supposed to hit and they do you can tell

[46:08] But it's a little harder to like you know just earning your periphery because of all the right commotion going on

[46:14] But I love that you just told us what your pick was for best and then you went off on all the things that are wrong with it

[46:21] Well, here's the thing. I think rules. It's hard right because most people haven't played most of these games

[46:26] I hear good things about the Avengers rule set, but then again

[46:31] It's like a 24 page rule set book are people gonna vote for something that complex

[46:35] I do love the simplicity of G and R and Rick and Morty's rule sets

[46:38] I like both of those rule sets for their simplicity and the ease of understanding what to do

[46:43] Collect the band members start a song you're in this amazing moment go on adventures with Rick and Morty right like fill up Morty's adventure card

[46:52] I love that it's that simple to understand how to play that game

[46:55] You know, I don't came out last year, but the new viral game is really good

[46:59] I think it's kind of like kind of forgotten, but it's well, of course. I like it's a lineman sheet game

[47:05] All of his games are good. Yeah, I know that's off topic

[47:08] Yeah, no, I mean if you want to talk about last year's game

[47:11] We'll do another show all right best artwork in a pinball machine

[47:14] And I'm skipping over favorite pinball podcast because that's the most dramatic category. It feels like every year

[47:20] That's artwork. Well, they have so many gosh darn packages this year

[47:24] I guess whatever package has my neighbor has a chimney. I'm kind of jealous. Let's see best artwork

[47:31] I think I mean yet he's got his fan base with turtles and with Avengers

[47:36] Well, I guess subjective subjectively I

[47:39] You know, I'm not I like you know, I'm I have nothing against you know cartoons or animation

[47:44] But for a pinball machine honestly doesn't really do it for me even though on the rickum well

[47:49] Ah rickum Morty's artwork is cool, but it's not

[47:52] Well, I was all done by cartoon swim like spooky had basically

[47:56] Cart did I say cartoon swim?

[47:58] It's all done by cartoon networks. So they didn't really have any choice

[48:01] And it's it looks cool, but it's not you know

[48:04] Jeremy does a better job of filling the frame, you know with action right

[48:09] So what do you think? What do you think not hot wheels?

[48:14] Um, oh shoot. Do you think it's gonna go to a yeti game?

[48:18] It probably will what about gnr art? Do you think it stands a chance or is that standard cabinet gonna be what sinks it?

[48:24] The playfield on gnr is pretty good. They turn everyone into skeletons

[48:28] So you don't see how much weight axle roses gained

[48:30] But yeah, but I think with the overall package like the cabinets might hurt gnr

[48:35] I

[48:36] If we're trying to predict what's gonna win

[48:38] I would say probably a Jeremy game, but I don't know which one I'd actually say as the best artwork

[48:43] I'm gonna say Avengers wins over turtles

[48:48] Just because I don't know why I don't even have an answer why it's gonna be one of those

[48:52] I think it's gonna be a coin toss, but I think Jeremy Packer will be

[48:56] Hoisting up the trophy and I think what hurts gnr and and I love Dale

[49:00] I believe it's Dale Henry Jr

[49:02] His artwork on the play field of gnr. I think is the nicest most detailed

[49:07] Playfield and it fits perfectly with the theme of the world tour of gnr

[49:11] The problem is is there's so many artists on the gnr package

[49:14] You don't know who you're voting for because you've got the tour cluster art

[49:18] You've got the standard cabinet. You've got the appetite for destruction

[49:22] Stuff so it's like it does feel like three different design directions where yeti stuff is so much more cohesive

[49:29] And all feels like it's coming from one man right one man who has to do a whole lot of artwork for stern

[49:35] Best playfield gameplay and layout like how it shoots huh yep trying to think

[49:41] I mean you know this man wins every year. Who's Steve Richie? No key that Owen. Oh

[49:46] Did put wait Avengers? Oh

[49:49] Right, god. He's a he's a new doctor flash except for he's not in prison

[49:54] You know I gosh, I only played it once I okay well if you say so yeah

[50:00] Since I haven't played Avengers enough. I'm gonna take a mulligan on this one. I haven't played it either

[50:05] I just I if I were to pick a winner and last year Jurassic Park right one with 53.6% of the votes

[50:14] The second place was wonka with 18% so I think Keith Owen whenever he's up for best layout

[50:21] Is gonna win have for for the rest of eternity. But Jurassic Park was really good

[50:26] There's no doubt about that right. Yes. Okay, so game of the year. Where's designer of the year? Hold on

[50:33] We missed that so who who's designer of the year? I think that that has to be a category. I don't know why it's not up here

[50:39] I could see that going to

[50:40] Gnr and Eric um, I think a lot of it's kind of like well

[50:44] It's not as politicized and I don't mean that like republicans and democrats

[50:48] You know how the Oscar thing is like well martin scrucacy

[50:51] This wasn't your best movie, but we're gonna give you an Oscar for it because you never got one before you know like departed

[50:56] Right

[50:57] I could see like you know

[50:59] You know, everyone knows eric kind of got I don't want to say screwed on pirates

[51:02] But that game was not allowed to reach its full potential. I don't know if designer is a separate category

[51:08] Here's why I think layout should go to

[51:11] Elwin but best designer I do think should go to eric minier because it's a design choice

[51:18] To make that game what they did it's a design choice to have all those instruments be represented

[51:23] It's a design choice to make the game itself a concert in a box like it's almost like a designer's a movie director

[51:29] And he directed guns and roses pinball to be this way

[51:32] Yeah, I I wouldn't say guns and roses is like the best shooting game ever

[51:36] I mean it shoots fine

[51:37] But there's certainly games that have better flow and and whatnot

[51:40] But again

[51:41] Stern games tend to be emptier with you know shots near the back more and so just as a game as a package

[51:48] Well as I mentioned like you know

[51:49] I've just gotten back from a road trip and yeah

[51:51] We went to blue moon saloon or whatever it's called and they had

[51:55] Turtles guns and roses and Avengers and the only one I wanted to play more than once was guns and roses because I'm like

[52:01] You know like I see the Avengers got like comic book art. I'm like. I don't care about that

[52:06] I mean, I know that's not that's not critiquing the game itself

[52:08] But it's like what draws you to a game. So yeah, I mean we're growing adults and I don't think most grown men want

[52:15] Ninja Turtles as opposed to more mature themes like gnr and the matrix and terminator and you can go down a list

[52:23] La Boussie yeah, we're grown men

[52:25] Well unless unless they had it unless they had transformers g1 well. Yes. Yes

[52:31] It's like it's like it's like cars, you know, it's like more masculine. Yeah

[52:35] Transformers has remained in adult property over the years Ninja Turtles has not and it's always been just for kids

[52:42] All right, so game of the year the moments in which all of the

[52:48] Pristigiousness of the Twippy Awards sweeps the globe millions of people not tuning in

[52:54] What wins game of the year? Well, it's probably gonna be a toss up

[52:58] Well, maybe not toss up. It's probably gonna be Infinity War Infinity Quest. Whatever it's called versus gnr

[53:03] Again, I even I've only played it once. I know people were just like creaming themselves over it

[53:07] I'm pinstive when I was released

[53:09] But I don't know I I guess I should have gone over to blue moon and played it some more

[53:15] Before we did this podcast

[53:17] Just like from what's in it though. I mean, I think guns and roses a lot more interesting

[53:21] You know, it's like it's actually the van members talking not, you know

[53:25] fake Tony Stark or whatever if we define game of the year as the pinball game that really made the largest

[53:32] Impact on pinball and brought pinball forward and raised the bar right and showed us a new thing in pinball

[53:39] We have never seen before I don't know how you don't vote for guns and roses

[53:44] And I know that Jurassic Park one last year and that was an L win game

[53:47] And I still hear people say that Jurassic Park is better than Avengers

[53:51] And I think Avengers was a little bit of a rushed effort over at Stern and and I heard rumors about that

[53:56] And not that it's taking anything away from the game

[53:59] But there's nothing about Avengers that really feels like it took pinball forward that it created a new way to look at this

[54:06] Incredible hobby of ours

[54:08] And I think gnr has transcended pinball in a lot of ways and has

[54:12] Pinball to a new level. Yeah, if you look at if you look at Avengers

[54:15] It has that really cool like Captain Marvel black widow ramp thing or whatever

[54:20] You know that that's really cool where it goes up and then I guess there's balls into the play field

[54:24] But you know even get my Jurassic Park. It's like okay. Well what what's in it?

[54:29] You know, but Jurassic Park had like the fake Jeep and the dinosaur head

[54:33] You know just like from a sir even if he hadn't played it from a surface level it looks like this more there right

[54:38] Also, I get you're right avenger. I heard it was like six months or something ridiculous like they just my new criteria for the game

[54:45] That should also win game of the year obviously should be the most fun

[54:48] I can hear Ed Robertson beating me in the head saying it's all about the fun Chris

[54:52] But I think it should be the game that has the greatest moments in pinball that makes you feel something and if we're to look at the games

[55:00] I see I think that should be a category. What's the best moment that moment in a pinball machine like that's such a more meaningful thing to sort of

[55:08] Highlight then favorite pinball location favorite pinball podcast favorite pinball streamer favorite pinball

[55:14] Like what's the best moment? What was the best moment in a pinball machine? What was you know that deserves to be up there?

[55:20] It's movie equivalent of Superman catching the helicopter, you know

[55:25] Yeah, because you think about that like if you look at the 90s you had

[55:28] You had like you know attack from Mars is like boom

[55:33] Right or the castle same thing. Yeah, basically the same game to tell anyone

[55:37] But those were like one which like yeah, you're like you knew it was coming

[55:40] You're right. It was like padlocks dog. You know, it's coming and you want to see it and then you know

[55:45] You're rewarded like there's the there's the

[55:47] What's the what's I think in your brain that and and door fiend hit?

[55:51] It's gonna be an interesting year because the other thing though

[55:54] And this is where I think it could swing towards Avengers is Jersey Jack is so slow on getting these games to consumers

[56:01] And it's like half of the people who bought this game are also really frustrated with Jersey Jack for making them wait so long

[56:08] And the collectors edition owners don't even know when they're getting them and by the time voting is over

[56:12] There will be 10 times more Avengers in households than GNRs

[56:17] So if this is just a vote I worry that GNR even though it should be game of the year

[56:23] Might just be outvote it because there's not that many out there. Yeah, and there's certainly yeah

[56:29] I mean that that is possible a lot of people a lot of people would be having to go off as much faith for

[56:36] Guns and roses ironically as we are going with Avengers because you know

[56:39] We didn't really care for Avengers, but we've both played guns and roses a decent amount. So right

[56:44] Yeah, I could see that's like it's like not what's best, but what you know

[56:47] This is Eric's year though, and it should be Eric's year and we should recognize Eric this year because we've recognized

[56:53] Elwin a lot we but Eric just made a game that I just don't think we're gonna see a game like this in a very long time

[56:59] Ben anything else you want to talk about before I let you go

[57:01] You have to jet pretty soon, but thank you for joining the show. It's always a pleasure. Oh um well

[57:07] I hope to have really good team integration with my game. That's my goal

[57:12] Well, don't mess it up. I'll try not to do I want me to sign an NDA and give you some you know some some tips on some things

[57:18] We could do I would love to work on a game no one wants to talk to me. Why is that? I don't know. I mean kind of abrasive

[57:25] What abrasive where?

[57:27] Well, tell you when it comes to like rule stuff. I'll hit you up

[57:33] I'll probably hit Hilton up as well Hilton's even though Hilton is also annoying

[57:37] It would be amazing if Hilton and I coded a game with you. I mean imagine us two men who can't see eye to eye on anything come together to solve

[57:45] The Quagmire of pinball moments. Yeah, I'd be like Israel and Palestine, you know shaking hands

[57:50] Yeah, I know be great

[57:52] I mean I used to have a Subaru we could bond we could start there

[57:55] And then we could we could go on and talk about pinball. It's super. I mean, yeah

[57:59] I know you probably don't like it because it's a station wagon, but it is a nice, you know for what it is

[58:03] It's nice. I mean I have a station wagon. I'm gonna be in a station wagon very soon when the baby comes

[58:08] All that's right, but then you you can also fit a pinball machine in it. You're gonna love it. I tell you man

[58:13] That thread on pinstile will pinball machine fit in it. That's like stop. Oh you guys stop

[58:17] There's like there's something called the tape measure

[58:19] Well, it's not just the size of the open and also the shape

[58:23] Like you can get like one of those Chrysler specificas and you'd think you can fit a pinball machine in the back

[58:29] But the tailgate is so rounded at the top you actually can't right

[58:33] But then you have something like a little Honda fit and you you wouldn't think it, but then it can fit it

[58:37] So I mean, I don't know. I think there's some validity to question it that goes beyond the tape measure in 2021

[58:42] Will people be saying will it fit a pin pod in it?

[58:46] Will a pin pod fit no door fit through a doorway?

[58:50] I'm ordering a pin pod and converting it into a podcasting studio for myself. It's gonna be amazing

[58:56] You could rent it out as a New York apartment for $3,000

[59:00] It's amazing. It's amazing. I think the pin pods kind of cool, but it's way overpriced and I mean

[59:06] I like the idea of recyclable a reusable shipping, but Ben always a pleasure

[59:11] It has been one heck of a year and we look forward to talking to you again in 2021

[59:16] So thank you for taking some time to talk to the listeners and giving your predictions for the best games of 2020

[59:22] All right, I guess we'll see y'all next year. Alrighty
