[00:00] Mornings spectacular.

[00:01] Ah.

[00:04] All right, let's see what we got going on here.

[00:06] We got we got sound, which is good.

[00:10] We're not going to share this link.

[00:14] Get some people in the house and then talk some pinball.

[00:17] I know everyone's like, where is it?

[00:19] You start and lay I started late today because I went to the gym.

[00:23] And it's snowed here in Rewatin.

[00:26] And so we had a beautiful, really beautiful morning.

[00:30] I mean, with Killian getting his snow outfit on and he's having a blast.

[00:36] So I don't even if I have to keep telling everybody, I'm at the point now,

[00:41] where if I have to tell you to join, I'm done.

[00:44] People updates.

[00:45] They should just join.

[00:47] It is like, it is real easy to know where we're at right now,

[00:52] doing our Saturday morning spectacular here on YouTube.

[00:57] I'm sure some people have figured this out.

[00:59] What's up, Tony Jeremy Charles is in the house.

[01:03] Let's put this on Facebook right now.

[01:05] Got a lot of fun stuff to talk about world of pinball.

[01:08] Happy holidays, everybody.

[01:10] I love this time of year.

[01:12] It is such a nice time.

[01:14] And it is like a time when we all should just give a tremendous amount of

[01:19] thanks to being alive.

[01:23] I mean that.

[01:25] It's too easy to get lost in all the

[01:29] all the BS of the world.

[01:31] It's just too easy.

[01:32] You start to live in your head too much.

[01:34] You start to forget what a miracle it is just to be on a planet,

[01:40] circling the sun, hurling through space at like 10,000 miles an hour.

[01:47] How's everybody doing?

[01:48] Welcome to the Saturday morning spectacular.

[01:50] Do I need to even let these people on Patreon know?

[01:52] I mean, it's at the point now where they should just know to go, right?

[01:57] Like let's just make a post real quick just in case they need,

[02:02] they need to have a reminder we live.

[02:07] We live right now.

[02:12] All right.

[02:13] No, I just messed that up.

[02:17] Hold on.

[02:21] We live right now.

[02:25] It's going to be here every Saturday morning.

[02:27] I know I did a few on Facebook.

[02:30] I know I did a few like when I was traveling and the old medium,

[02:34] but this is this is where we're going to do it.

[02:37] And so let's give a shout out to Mr. Christopher French.

[02:40] He's in the house.

[02:41] We've got little Everett in the house.

[02:45] We've got sad boy.

[02:47] We've got Robert Castle.

[02:50] How's everybody doing?

[02:50] Should we record this?

[02:51] Let's hit record.

[02:53] Let's just let's give the kids what they want.

[02:55] Let's see what this does.

[02:58] Main output.

[02:59] All right.

[03:00] Here we go.

[03:00] We're recording.

[03:01] I'm trying a new mixer.

[03:03] Let's see how this sounds on this audacity thing.

[03:05] I'm maybe it sounds better than it would if I was recording it on audacity.

[03:11] So we'll see what happens.

[03:12] Who knows?

[03:13] Who knows?

[03:14] You get more than your money is worth on.

[03:15] Can you just pinball podcasts everybody?

[03:18] We're going to go around the horn today.

[03:20] There's a lot happening in pinball.

[03:23] And it's almost like just nothing happening at the same time.

[03:25] Mr. French, I'm happy to report that favorite pinball artists will be returning

[03:31] to this year's Twippy Awards.

[03:34] So can it is pinball podcasts was successful in getting that reinstated.

[03:40] It was a it's crazy that I had to even do that.

[03:45] But it is back.

[03:46] It is going to be a category.

[03:48] I spoke to Colin.

[03:50] I spoke to Jamie.

[03:52] The one thing is this.

[03:53] The one thing is this they still.

[03:57] I think they still removed too many of the manufacturer categories.

[04:01] And you know, Colin was kind of like, if you were going to add a couple more back in,

[04:05] which would you do?

[04:06] Right?

[04:07] And he's like on top of artists.

[04:08] And you know, you got animation.

[04:10] You got call out.

[04:11] You got sound.

[04:12] You got toys and mechs.

[04:14] You got theme versus theme integration.

[04:18] So it was like, I don't know, it's hard to say which two,

[04:24] when I think there was about four or five categories that should all have been put back,

[04:29] but it is what it is.

[04:30] This chat is worth $5 alone.

[04:32] Of course it is.

[04:35] I can't tell you how expensive the world is becoming.

[04:37] I mean, I want to go get gas.

[04:39] It's like 490 a gallon.

[04:42] One gallon of gas or Canadian pinball podcasts.

[04:46] Just so you know, the thing is this, I told this to Colin that evil dead should be eligible

[04:56] because the art is out.

[04:58] And I don't understand why a game that's been fully revealed is ineligible for art.

[05:05] If it comes, because spooky always releases games this time of year and starts shipping in January.

[05:11] And I just think it's silly to not make it eligible because then every single spooky machine is not going to be eligible

[05:18] when the iron is hot, right?

[05:21] Hot off the press.

[05:22] We get to see this artwork.

[05:24] Why would that not be eligible?

[05:27] So let's go around the horn.

[05:29] Let's go around the horn.

[05:31] Let's talk about what's going on in pinball.

[05:33] So look, I love that.

[05:35] I love that.

[05:37] I don't know why people think King Kong is next.

[05:39] carry.

[05:40] Look, look, it's funny to me that I always feel like carry has to make these a little bit snarky snipes at canada.

[05:47] The reason why I was I was told by a few people at King Kong might be next because of the delay with dungeons and dragons, major mechanism.

[05:58] But who told you it was dungeons and dragons in the first place.

[06:02] Can you just been bought podcast?

[06:05] And in the end, it doesn't really matter.

[06:08] We know it's gonna be D&D and King Kong

[06:11] as the next two-stern games with most likely

[06:14] maybe another remaster of something.

[06:18] So I don't really care, you know what I'm saying?

[06:22] I don't want Dungeons and Dragons.

[06:24] I don't want it to be next.

[06:27] I don't think Dungeons and Dragons is gonna sell very well.

[06:32] I also don't really think people understand

[06:35] to this day what Spike 3 is.

[06:38] It's not gonna be this humongous difference.

[06:40] I don't even think Spike 3,

[06:43] I don't even know what's gonna be a bigger screen

[06:45] to be honest now that I think about it.

[06:46] It might just be a better screen but not bigger.

[06:50] And I really do think people are gonna be

[06:52] a little bit disappointed.

[06:54] I've been told, I'm just gonna say this straight up.

[06:56] I've been told by the senior senior brass

[06:59] at Stern Pimball that everybody should just

[07:02] like sort of curb their enthusiasm

[07:05] around what they expect from Spike 3 as a thing.

[07:10] You're not gonna see some like major platform innovation

[07:14] or some major, like visual difference.

[07:18] What you're gonna see is more of a power source

[07:23] and more internal beefing up of components

[07:27] that will allow Stern Pimball to put more into the games.

[07:31] So that is where your excitement should lie.

[07:35] I don't think everyone's like,

[07:38] well, Spike 3 is gonna launch

[07:40] with some major King Kong moment.

[07:43] And I think that is probably not gonna be the way it works.

[07:47] I think we've already seen some of Spike 3

[07:49] and Metallica Remastered, we're gonna see more of it.

[07:54] I also think you're gonna see a rolling out

[07:57] of Spike 3 components throughout the year.

[07:59] It's not all gonna come at once.

[08:02] So I just think everyone needs to realize that

[08:05] that the problem with Dungeons and Dragons right now,

[08:08] I fully expect there to be only 500 D&D LEs.

[08:11] I absolutely would be shocked

[08:15] if Dungeons and Dragons offers more than 500 LEs.

[08:19] I think even at that,

[08:21] it's gonna do a much better job of creating FOMO, right?

[08:25] Because if you go back to this whole,

[08:27] like half of them go overseas,

[08:30] and remember, if Stern cuts the LLE number in half,

[08:34] they haven't cut in half their dealer and distro list.

[08:39] So they have so many more people

[08:41] that are now selling their product than ever before.

[08:45] So I expect the sell through of a 500 LLotman

[08:49] to be instantaneous.

[08:52] So they will sell through every single Dungeons and Dragons

[08:54] on day one, whether or not consumers will buy everyone

[08:59] is up in the air.

[09:03] The spooky boners, man, someone's gonna have to explain

[09:06] this thing to me because I've been,

[09:09] I mean, my Patreon chat has turned into nothing

[09:12] but spooky boner images.

[09:14] Funny stuff, I absolutely love that we've become

[09:18] sort of a home base and ground zero for spooky boners,

[09:23] but I don't know the context.

[09:26] If someone could write here,

[09:28] what's the origins of that?

[09:31] I would be great.

[09:32] I would love a spooky boner hat.

[09:34] I would love it.

[09:35] I would wear it with pride.

[09:37] I would love a spooky boner sweatshirt and t-shirt.

[09:40] You get me those anything spooky boner, I'll wear it.

[09:44] Well, we're gonna get to spooky in a little bit.

[09:48] All right, so fully expect Dungeons and Dragons gang.

[09:52] It's coming out in two weeks.

[09:53] The game is gonna be at CES January 7th.

[09:58] Carey's update was funny because he's like,

[10:00] I'm being told the pro is the way to go on this game

[10:02] and the pro's gonna have so much value.

[10:05] Stern pimples and big trouble people,

[10:08] if they make a $6,500 pro machine,

[10:12] as good as a $13,000 ELE.

[10:16] I don't think there's gonna be a lot of sales success

[10:22] if you look down at a pro and it's half the price of an ELE.

[10:29] I think that's gonna be a big issue for Stern.

[10:31] I think what's happening with Stern

[10:33] is they're designing these games now

[10:35] where they can't remove the major stuff from the game

[10:39] and still have the game function properly.

[10:42] And I think that's gonna, you know, that's why,

[10:45] like if you look at an X-Men pro,

[10:47] you really don't feel like you're missing out

[10:49] that much versus an X-Men ELE.

[10:52] And definitely doesn't feel like you get

[10:54] twice the game in the ELE.

[10:56] Now speaking of X-Men, it seems to be,

[11:01] and I don't know if this is confirmed or not,

[11:04] or there seems to just be this rumor

[11:06] that Jack Danger is sort of kinda over it,

[11:10] that he sort of wants nothing more to be done with this game.

[11:13] I can't imagine that is true.

[11:15] Jack does not strike me as a guy

[11:18] that would ever, especially publicly,

[11:21] abandon ship on his own creation.

[11:24] I don't see him as an individual who quits.

[11:28] I think he is extremely frustrated

[11:32] with the co-development of his title.

[11:34] And I think he knows that Stern has this sort of like,

[11:40] well, if it's not a hit, move on to the next.

[11:43] So I'm a little bit worried

[11:45] that he's never gonna get the support for this game.

[11:49] Now, this game kinda blows.

[11:51] Like everyone is really feeling bad

[11:54] because the game's art package, the design, the toys.

[12:00] Remember when X-Men launched,

[12:02] like it had a great launch.

[12:05] And Wysons code really became the Achilles heel.

[12:10] And then also, it's not just Wysons fault,

[12:13] a lot of the mechanical quirkiness of the game

[12:16] really did get people down.

[12:19] I think over time, I don't ever think this game

[12:23] is gonna be a hit, hit.

[12:26] I think we will see this game end up

[12:29] in a very similar fashion to Avengers.

[12:33] So that is what I believe X-Men will become.

[12:36] It'll always become a really unique game

[12:39] to have in a lineup.

[12:41] It'll never be sort of the game.

[12:44] Everyone gushes about.

[12:45] It's not gonna end up in the top 30 on Pinside.

[12:49] It's not gonna be a game that goes up in any value.

[12:53] It'll just be another Stern Marvel game.

[12:57] That is fun because all pinball is fun.

[13:00] But I don't think it's gonna reach a level

[13:03] that like Fluffyter's got to.

[13:05] I think it's gonna just kinda be,

[13:08] one of these B-minus games when you add it all up.

[13:13] So that is sad to see.

[13:16] I think the silver lining in all of that is this.

[13:20] I think Jack is pissed.

[13:23] I think Jack is mad at what was done to him

[13:27] in terms of rushing a game.

[13:28] I think he's a little bit disappointed

[13:31] in the code of the game.

[13:33] I think he's angry.

[13:34] And what I know about in my industry

[13:38] and in creative fields like what he's in,

[13:41] there's nothing better than an angry creative

[13:44] who's never gonna make that mistake again.

[13:47] This is only Jack Danger's second title.

[13:50] I fully expect him to channel that frustration and anger

[13:54] into his third title,

[13:56] which I think is gonna be a humongous hit.

[14:00] I'm gonna give you guys a little bit

[14:01] of an exclusive bit of information I've heard.

[14:05] I normally do this for my paying customers,

[14:07] but it's the holiday and I think given a gift.

[14:10] So you heard it here first.

[14:11] I'm here to tell you right now.

[14:13] I heard Stern Pimball has the license for Super Mario Brothers.

[14:21] So you start to think about that for a minute, right?

[14:24] Maybe they have Pokemon and Super Mario.

[14:27] Maybe they've inked a few Nintendo deals,

[14:31] but I'm hearing from very good sources

[14:33] in the belly of Chicago,

[14:36] that Stern Pimball has Super Mario.

[14:39] And that is music to everybody's ears,

[14:45] the bright kinda music,

[14:46] dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

[14:51] dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

[14:54] If they don't do a Super Mario Brothers

[14:56] with a lower play field that goes into the dungeon

[14:59] that plays that music, then what are we doing here?

[15:04] They also need to do the green sewer pipes

[15:07] that you go into.

[15:09] It would be amazing with subway systems left and right.

[15:12] So look, the thing is this everybody,

[15:14] I think we're all in the same spot right now.

[15:16] We're, it's so easy to sort of get into the theme,

[15:20] rumor mill, and get all excited.

[15:23] Then executing is a whole nother thing.

[15:27] And how long we have to wait to get those said titles

[15:31] is also a really interesting thing

[15:34] because I don't think the pinball hobby,

[15:39] as we know it, can survive another two years at these prices.

[15:44] And what I mean by that is the new inbox stuff

[15:47] is just going to continue to sit

[15:49] and the amount of games in collections, people are at a room.

[15:54] So something's going to have to give, right?

[15:57] The boutiques are going to be fine,

[15:59] but Stern's pumping out a few thousand games every month.

[16:02] Like that, like where do they all go?

[16:04] Where will they all end up?

[16:06] So Stern pinball, we're going to see Dungeons & Dragons

[16:10] by January 7th, then January, February, March, April,

[16:15] then whatever, April, May, right?

[16:17] That's when we're going to see King Kong expect that.

[16:21] I think Comic Con might be around that time of year.

[16:24] So it's going to go Brian Eddie with D&D,

[16:29] Keith Lwynne with King Kong,

[16:32] fully expect there to be a tron remake

[16:35] in the mix next year.

[16:37] Will we get another original title from John Borg

[16:40] before he remakes another one of his classics?

[16:43] I think Tron is next.

[16:45] I think he sees these remakes as completely new games.

[16:49] So that's going to happen.

[16:52] And then we're going to also see some very interesting moves

[16:57] from the company down the street.

[17:00] Don't worry, we'll get to you spooky.

[17:01] We know we want to talk about spooky.

[17:03] Jersey Jack pinball.

[17:07] By the time everyone gets their collector's edition

[17:10] of Avatar, those games are already worth $12,000.

[17:15] They're not even going to be,

[17:17] I know I bag on Avatar and I will continue to bag on Avatar

[17:24] because I just think it's such a waste of a sort of everything.

[17:30] It's a waste of all the resources.

[17:32] It was a waste of JJP's time and money to do it.

[17:35] They just didn't nail it and the theme was bad to begin with.

[17:42] And there's just so many better options.

[17:45] And the more I jump on that game,

[17:49] the more I realize something's got to change

[17:53] in the way Jersey Jack pinball codes its machines.

[17:58] I think they need to spend some time

[18:01] on other machines a little bit

[18:03] and see what theme integration should look like.

[18:09] Out of all the pinball companies out there,

[18:11] I think Jersey Jack pinball has severely struggled

[18:14] on the theme integration and they've listened to no feedback

[18:19] and I just don't get it.

[18:22] I don't get it.

[18:23] When you play the Avatar game,

[18:26] the level of disconnect between the characters,

[18:30] what's happening on the screen,

[18:32] the storyline from the movie,

[18:35] and then what's actually happening on the game itself

[18:38] is completely disconnected.

[18:42] It is emotionless, it is sterile, it is repetitive,

[18:48] and in my honest opinion,

[18:52] it is maybe one of Jersey Jack pinball's worst games.

[18:58] And I know Mark is a really good guy.

[19:02] I don't think he was handed a very great theme

[19:05] and I don't think he was helped out at all.

[19:08] And I don't know how you have a whole organization

[19:12] over there who knows how to make really fun pinball machines

[19:15] and then you end up with those lower play fields.

[19:18] They're not fun to shoot.

[19:21] Nothing really innovative about them.

[19:23] And then above the game, above the play field,

[19:26] there's nothing or there's no toys, there's nothing.

[19:28] So again, Jersey Jack, that's the past.

[19:31] Avatar is dead on arrival, like it's dead on arrival.

[19:33] Like if you bought one,

[19:36] sure it's beautiful, sure it's pretty,

[19:38] that's not gonna have any impact on creating new demand.

[19:43] It's just gonna be, I'm telling you,

[19:45] the CES is gonna go the same way of Godfather.

[19:48] It's gonna be a, if they even make a thousand,

[19:51] I highly doubt they got an order 4,000 of those games.

[19:54] Because the thing is this is Harry Potter's coming gang.

[19:58] February March, we will see Harry Potter.

[20:01] I wanna thank the fact that we have 100 people

[20:03] who have finally figured out

[20:04] how to get the Canadian Saturday Morning Spectacular

[20:07] and you're here right now on YouTube.

[20:10] I wanna thank all of my subscribers, Gang, thank you so much.

[20:15] I finally had a cash out, some of my Patreon money.

[20:19] You know where it went?

[20:20] It went to paying the damn contractor

[20:23] to get my apartment in New York City ready for sale.

[20:26] We've closed on a deal.

[20:29] Money just goes out the door people.

[20:31] It is, it really is crazy.

[20:33] It's like a distributor can sell 4 L's

[20:39] and make more money in that one move

[20:41] than I make all month.

[20:43] Who does more work to sell those 4 L's?

[20:45] But just think about that.

[20:47] So whenever you feel like $5 is too much

[20:50] and upping your amount from five to 10 is too much

[20:53] and then you go spend $2,000 on a plastic top

[20:57] or just remember time and my life that I enjoy doing this.

[21:02] But I'm still shocked I haven't seen any other

[21:05] pinball podcaster take their show completely behind

[21:09] the firewall.

[21:10] It's weird to just always split it up.

[21:14] It's just, to me it doesn't seem worth it

[21:15] because I believe me, I love watching what everybody does

[21:19] like observing it all.

[21:21] And in the end, nobody's grown their audience at all

[21:27] for like two years now.

[21:29] So it's just, you're just plateau.

[21:31] I mean, I'm kind of stuck now in this like 73740.

[21:36] I mean, I wanted to get to 800 by the end of the year.

[21:40] It's not going to happen.

[21:41] It's not going to happen.

[21:42] I mean, I'm a realist.

[21:44] I just need it like 60 people to invite a friend

[21:46] or give a gift of Canada.

[21:48] I don't think anyone's even given the gift of Canada.

[21:51] All right, so Harry Potter is coming out real soon.

[21:54] I think it's going to be a return to wide body.

[21:57] I think it's going to be Eric Minier's sort of,

[22:00] all right, man, like this is it.

[22:02] Here's the thing though, if Harry Potter comes out,

[22:05] I mean, if it comes out and it's got muted clips,

[22:09] I think I'm just done with Jersey Jack Pinball for good.

[22:13] I mean that.

[22:14] I just, if they mute the clips and they don't get

[22:19] the rights to use the actors with the voices,

[22:23] with the scenes, with the moments, I'm done.

[22:26] I can't play these games that are like

[22:30] these weird clips, muted clips in a blender feel.

[22:34] It just doesn't work.

[22:36] It just doesn't work, you know?

[22:37] It didn't work with, it's like,

[22:39] Wanka would have been one of the greatest pins of all time

[22:43] if the modes were actually the musical, like the movie,

[22:48] and you're in those scenes and those songs are being sung

[22:51] as you go through the iconic moments of that movie.

[22:55] Like it's just, it's not there gang, it's all muted.

[22:57] Like there's nothing in it.

[23:00] It's just, I don't understand why they code that way.

[23:03] Complete opposite of James Bond.

[23:06] Yeah, but I'm so tired of being, you know,

[23:08] Sad Boy said, Wank is great for what it is,

[23:10] but tired of being what it is.

[23:12] It's like so obvious what it could have been.

[23:15] You know what I'm saying?

[23:16] Like yeah, I get that it's great though.

[23:18] Like it's good for what they made it,

[23:20] but it's not what it should have been.

[23:23] It's the same way I just won't get over

[23:26] what's turned into Star Wars.

[23:28] That Star Wars game is an abomination

[23:32] of what a Star Wars game should be.

[23:34] It not only that, the code I hate,

[23:38] I hate stacking different scenes

[23:40] from different movies together just for points.

[23:44] It is the worst thing I've ever seen.

[23:46] Like I never feel like I'm in those Star Wars moments

[23:50] at all.

[23:51] Like it's just so badly done.

[23:54] So it's just, look, JJP Pirates is not the best JJP ever.

[24:00] JJP Pirates doesn't even have any clips.

[24:03] They don't even have any clips.

[24:04] They don't even get the rights to the music.

[24:06] Look, I get that it's like a Pirate inspired game,

[24:10] but man, how are we saying that a muted clip,

[24:14] no clips at all?

[24:16] It's one of the worst theme integration

[24:18] in the history of Pimble.

[24:20] It's like all it shares with it's like,

[24:23] I'm gang, it's like this appall,

[24:27] if they just kept making Pirates guys,

[24:30] like we wouldn't be talking about it anymore.

[24:33] All right, so look,

[24:35] and then we've got Steve Riches, the Matrix.

[24:37] Now look, I know for a fact that if they do Matrix,

[24:40] it's gonna be a muted clip disaster.

[24:43] I don't even think they're gonna have any clips.

[24:47] I think Matrix might be like real difficult

[24:52] because I know that that is a license that

[24:54] you don't get anything.

[24:55] All right, so Pirates is now at 1.0.

[24:59] After six years, six freaking years gang,

[25:04] I don't even know, is that a good thing?

[25:09] Is it like just like, it's just pathetic?

[25:13] Can we just be honest?

[25:14] Like it's pathetic to take six years

[25:17] to finish your homework assignment.

[25:19] Six freaking years.

[25:21] Now look, most people are never gonna get

[25:23] to that wizard mode anyway.

[25:25] And I think I saw it on YouTube,

[25:26] and it was stupid anyway.

[25:28] Like it's just the whole thing.

[25:30] The whole thing of like,

[25:31] all right, you can finally get to this impossible

[25:34] to get to mode.

[25:35] It's not gonna blow you away.

[25:38] And it took six years to complete

[25:40] because the thing is,

[25:42] it's more about what the delay means to everybody

[25:46] than the actual finishing of the code.

[25:50] What do you think of David Fix on loser kid?

[25:53] We'll get to American Pimble.

[25:55] So we can go to them now,

[25:57] and then we'll go to Spooky, okay?

[25:59] So like anyway, wow,

[26:02] thousand Pirate owners finally have a wizard mode

[26:05] they'll never get to.

[26:06] Okay, happy holidays, Pirate owners.

[26:08] Luzer kid interview David Fix.

[26:11] That happened like two weeks ago.

[26:13] I think we've talked about it.

[26:15] I don't think, I don't know if Sophia's still there.

[26:17] I don't know who's even still there.

[26:19] It seems like there's a long list of people

[26:23] that have been like, go from the organization.

[26:26] I don't know who's even still a part

[26:29] of the organization as of today.

[26:32] I think, you know me, I mean,

[26:36] I'm like, let me be candid here.

[26:40] I'm not surprised by any of this.

[26:45] I think, you know,

[26:48] the decisions that were made over the years

[26:54] put that company in a position

[26:56] to not be competitive with what the other companies

[27:01] were bringing to market.

[27:03] And you know,

[27:06] it does, there's,

[27:08] because in the end, like whether it's,

[27:10] it's AP or Stern or Jersey Jack,

[27:13] I mean, look, everybody can make colossal mistakes.

[27:16] Stern has made it with John Wick.

[27:19] Jersey Jack made it with Avatar, Godfather.

[27:23] The ability for this industry to pick horrendous themes

[27:27] and use no market research before selecting a title.

[27:31] Never ceases to amaze me.

[27:34] So I think that in the end,

[27:38] when American Pimball and David Fix walked into a garage

[27:43] and saw Dennis Nordman's white wood

[27:45] for galactic tank force,

[27:48] that was a seminal moment of,

[27:52] do we think this is what the Pimball community will buy?

[27:57] And so then you just make a judgment call.

[28:00] In the end, it's a judgment call.

[28:02] Like Jody Dankberg thought that John Wick would sell.

[28:06] So did Tim Sexton and George Gomez, right?

[28:09] Jack Winari, Gwenaeri, Gwenaeri, right?

[28:14] Still things Avatar is an amazing theme

[28:16] to bring to the Pimball market, right?

[28:18] Spooky Pimball thought Ultraman was great.

[28:21] It's like,

[28:23] but in the end,

[28:26] a lot of these companies have failed

[28:28] to even sell a license theme,

[28:29] let alone an unlicensed theme known as galactic tank force.

[28:35] Now,

[28:36] that's, that's it.

[28:38] You make a judgment call.

[28:41] And ultimately, it seems like,

[28:44] and I don't know much,

[28:46] it just seems like Mukesh has had enough.

[28:51] And he's sort of holding them accountable

[28:54] in a way now that has made it impossible for them

[28:58] to retain a lot of the staff that was over there.

[29:03] But here's what everybody really knows.

[29:07] Nobody cares.

[29:09] Nobody.

[29:11] This isn't like your,

[29:12] if you lose AP,

[29:16] you even lose any sleep.

[29:18] You have so many Pimball companies executing

[29:22] every single year

[29:24] that you're not losing any sleep over this.

[29:28] And I think that that's it.

[29:31] Like if,

[29:32] if half of the Pimball companies went away tomorrow,

[29:36] you would be just fine.

[29:38] There is absolutely that,

[29:41] that's the reality.

[29:43] Is that we have,

[29:45] you know, 50% of these companies are in real trouble

[29:50] of becoming obsolete

[29:52] because they just don't have enough

[29:54] either manufacturing ability

[29:56] or don't have themes people want.

[29:58] And they're going to struggle to sell.

[30:01] So that's it.

[30:04] That's it.

[30:05] See, you know,

[30:06] someone just said this like,

[30:07] and you know, you always hear this like AP builds a good game

[30:09] and they've mastered the technical part of Pimball.

[30:11] But again, that's why it's so frustrating.

[30:16] Is if you can do the hard stuff

[30:19] like manufacturing, right?

[30:22] How do you get the easy stuff wrong?

[30:24] The easy stuff is getting a good theme

[30:28] people want,

[30:29] getting a good artist on the game.

[30:32] So it looks pretty.

[30:33] I mean, October Fest is one of the most loaded games of all time

[30:38] in modern times.

[30:40] Like you go look at an October Fest

[30:42] and put it next to Avatar.

[30:44] It has like so many toys,

[30:47] so many unique quirky shots,

[30:49] so many like fun modes,

[30:50] like one handed, drinking beer mode,

[30:53] October Fest then

[30:55] when and put the ugliest art package imaginable on the game

[30:59] because Josh Kugler was in control of art.

[31:04] Josh Kugler shelved Matt Andrews' Houdini artwork

[31:08] because that's what AP has been for like,

[31:14] I don't know, maybe since it's inception,

[31:15] like just people making really strange decisions

[31:20] seemingly with no accountability

[31:23] or no taste for what the market wants.

[31:27] And again, as I said last time,

[31:30] if they have a hit game next and, you know,

[31:32] as I heard, he said on the interview,

[31:36] you know, major districts got to see Cuphead

[31:39] and placed orders and were really impressed.

[31:42] I mean, I don't believe anything he says

[31:45] when it comes to like, he's not gonna say otherwise, right?

[31:48] I don't know who these major distributors are,

[31:52] but you know, if they have a hit game,

[31:54] they can turn it around.

[31:55] I mean, that's really, and I mean that, like,

[31:59] you know, that company has personally hurt me more than

[32:06] than anyone's ever personally hurt me

[32:09] and I can't go into the detail, so I just,

[32:12] but I've let go of all that vitriol and I don't have any,

[32:18] anything more really.

[32:20] I just, I wish them luck.

[32:22] I think if they have a hit, they need to show it.

[32:25] I don't think they have, I don't,

[32:29] I think they're running out of time

[32:30] with all the stuff coming and I don't think, you know,

[32:34] I don't know, I don't think they're gonna bring out a banger

[32:37] if they're gonna go up against Harry Potter and King Kong

[32:40] and Matrix and Evil Dad is gonna start shipping

[32:45] and hope fictionalese are finally going out.

[32:47] That's it, that's how I feel.

[32:50] So no ill will, you know, they sort of, they beat me.

[32:55] They beat me and I know when to retreat at times

[33:01] and just let them have their victory and that's that.

[33:07] Okay, you know, because in the end,

[33:10] I've got to take care of my family and my livelihood

[33:13] and I've got to take care of a baby boy,

[33:16] I have a six month old baby eight months now, I think he is.

[33:20] But I just want you guys to know that it was really difficult

[33:24] for me to have someone trying to really hurt me

[33:28] as I was a new father with a baby and a morgue and again,

[33:32] like really, really, really destroyed me

[33:37] and destroyed the happiness in this household for a while

[33:41] and I'll just leave it at that.

[33:43] And I don't think anybody,

[33:44] if you ever wanna like go at people, just make it fair,

[33:48] just fight fair in life, fight fair,

[33:51] like reach out to people, talk to them, man to man,

[33:53] but nobody fought fair, nobody fought fair and it hurts.

[33:58] It hurts to be sucker punched and not being able

[34:02] to do anything about it.

[34:04] But when you know that's who you're up against,

[34:07] sometimes in life you just have to be the bigger man

[34:10] and walk away and that's what I'm doing.

[34:12] I'm not engaging any of those people.

[34:18] That's it.

[34:20] So that's that, you know, like they got a game to release

[34:26] and that's it.

[34:27] So the thing is, let's go to spooky.

[34:32] You know, spooky pinball, spooky boners, Christopher Franchi.

[34:38] Why do people keep,

[34:41] why do people posting lawyers and retracting messages?

[34:44] I don't know what people are doing that for.

[34:47] I don't need a lawyer.

[34:50] I'm not being sued.

[34:51] I'm not in legal trouble.

[34:55] I just do a pinball podcast a few times a week.

[34:59] All right, so the thing is with spooky

[35:03] is I just wanna be on,

[35:06] I wanna be on that train with them.

[35:09] I am on the train with them.

[35:10] I mean, these guys are awesome.

[35:11] I mean, I don't know if you know this,

[35:13] but like bugging Luke, hang out all the time

[35:17] on the Patreon chat.

[35:19] There are subscribers to Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[35:21] They apparently are making me some hats and t-shirts

[35:24] with spooky boners.

[35:25] I do believe that we have reached a place now in society.

[35:30] I'm gonna talk a little meta,

[35:31] but I'll bring it back to spooky.

[35:33] I think we're all tired of feeling bad about things

[35:37] we're supposed to feel good about.

[35:39] And I think we're tired of Superman movies

[35:42] that are dark and grim and overly serious.

[35:46] And now we're finally gonna get a colorful Superman movie

[35:50] that looks like what Superman should be.

[35:53] And I love it.

[35:53] I love James Gunn's Superman.

[35:56] And I think the most important thing

[35:59] to wake up as many days as possible in a good mood

[36:02] is to surround yourself with good vibes.

[36:05] And I think vibing has become like a thing, right?

[36:08] I mean, it's like kind of like the one good thing

[36:11] about Gen Z is they understand this.

[36:13] Like you gotta have good vibes.

[36:16] And when you're around people with good vibes

[36:18] and you feel good vibes, good vibrations, right?

[36:22] Like beach boys, like you just,

[36:24] you just have a good time.

[36:26] Like you know, you don't want anyone to sour the mood.

[36:29] You don't want anyone to bring you down.

[36:31] And when I look at spooky pinball

[36:34] and I look at this game, I mean,

[36:35] I don't like the theme still,

[36:36] but I look at the way this game is sort of landing

[36:40] in the community and I look at their culture

[36:43] and I look at their sort of,

[36:46] the way they carry themselves.

[36:48] I feel the vibes and I feel the energy.

[36:52] I feel the enthusiasm.

[36:54] I, you know, even if, look, and I'm gonna say this,

[36:57] it doesn't mean they're gonna release a perfect game

[36:59] that might not have some issues and this doesn't matter.

[37:02] What they've built is something far more powerful

[37:07] than just a good pinball machine.

[37:09] They've built a brand.

[37:13] And what people in this hobby just don't understand

[37:16] is how much more important it is

[37:20] for the future of your organization

[37:23] and your products and your customers

[37:25] to build a brand.

[37:29] Start there and yeah, absolutely,

[37:32] the product is also a lot of what makes your brand your brand.

[37:37] And they've had some hiccups along the way,

[37:40] but they've built a brand because they've put the people

[37:45] forward, they've connected with the community.

[37:49] You all know the brand of spooky pinball.

[37:52] You know who's there.

[37:55] You know what they look like.

[37:56] You know what they sound like.

[37:57] You know what they drink.

[37:58] You know they like to have fun.

[38:00] You know they like to laugh.

[38:01] You know they have crazy scientists like Ben Heck

[38:05] working on these games.

[38:06] They've got the most passionate, passionate artists

[38:09] in the history of maybe playing at Earth,

[38:12] the most passionate artists in all the pinball

[38:14] in Christopher, France,

[38:15] you they've built a brand and they've built a motley crew

[38:19] of people that like give a damn and really care

[38:24] and they're not only in it for the money.

[38:27] And they've also built a brand that listens.

[38:32] I mean, if I had to like give one thing I love the most

[38:36] is just they listen.

[38:39] They listen.

[38:40] So Ian's like, stern cares dude, come on.

[38:43] Did I, I didn't, well, I'm not even talking about stern Ian.

[38:45] You gotta grow up brother.

[38:46] You gotta learn how to have an adult conversation

[38:49] with people, Ian.

[38:50] I love you brother, but I didn't even mention stern.

[38:53] See, this is the thing with Ian bro.

[38:55] I'm gonna, Ian, I'm gonna,

[38:56] I'm gonna single you out right here.

[38:57] This is the problem with people nowadays.

[38:59] Ian's just like, I'm not even talking about stern.

[39:02] I'm allowed to praise spooky pinball

[39:06] and give them credit for all the great things they do.

[39:09] And me saying all of these great things about spooky

[39:13] is not me saying stern sucks.

[39:16] You're making that conclusion, which is juvenile, right?

[39:21] It's a juvenile way to listen to someone praise a company.

[39:26] I am not talking about anybody else right now, but spooky.

[39:30] So like just learn how to listen, Ian.

[39:35] Listen to what I'm saying about spooky.

[39:38] I didn't mention stern at all.

[39:40] I know stern cares because I know stern.

[39:42] I know stern better than you do, Ian.

[39:44] I know Seth Davis, George Gomez, really well, right?

[39:48] Do you have you had meetings with them?

[39:50] Intimate meetings with them?

[39:52] Probably not.

[39:54] All right, they care, but it's a different beast.

[39:57] And they've got a, they can't, they can't quite navigate it

[40:01] as well as spooky.

[40:04] So Ian, it's all right, man.

[40:05] It's all right, Ian.

[40:06] It's all right.

[40:08] It's all right.

[40:10] We know, we know.

[40:12] Nudge magazine, we love it.

[40:13] We love the photos.

[40:15] You capture a hot chick's plain pinball,

[40:17] which is almost impossible, but you do it.

[40:19] We're appreciated of it.

[40:21] But that's it.

[40:23] Spooky's vibes are the best in pinball though.

[40:25] They're the best, they're vibing better than anybody else.

[40:28] Come on, you kick open the door to a pinball company

[40:31] with a six pack of beer.

[40:34] Which door do you want to kick open?

[40:37] I mean, that's like, to me, that's like, that's it.

[40:39] Like, do you want to, I mean, kick open the door at spooky.

[40:43] You're having the best time ever.

[40:45] Let's see what else.

[40:46] Kick open the door at stern.

[40:47] Oh, first it's so damn big.

[40:49] You might not even run into anybody.

[40:51] And also, when you kick open the door at stern,

[40:54] you're in this like weird sort of like holding room

[40:57] where nobody's there.

[40:59] There's just some games lined up in a sort of empty lobby.

[41:03] It's big, man.

[41:04] Stern is big.

[41:05] You kick open the door at Jersey Jack.

[41:07] You know, you're running into a cubicle farm right there

[41:11] in the front.

[41:13] I don't know, man.

[41:14] I don't know.

[41:15] That's just the way it goes.

[41:16] That's just the way it goes.

[41:18] So look, the thing is, spooky is winning, man.

[41:23] They're winning and they're, they're vibing and they're jiving.

[41:27] And when they do goonies next, when they do goonies next,

[41:31] and it sells out instantly and they know they've got a few

[41:33] other more mainstream things coming.

[41:35] Like, come on gang, if they do goonies and beetle juice

[41:40] and Christopher French, he wasn't wrong.

[41:42] Like Superman 78, Wonder Woman, all those things go make it.

[41:47] They made an original Wonder Woman TV show,

[41:49] Pimball Machine with Linda Carter bouncing around.

[41:53] You know what I'm talking about?

[41:55] You're selling them.

[41:57] You're selling them.

[41:58] We want this stuff.

[41:59] A team, Wonder Woman, Knight Rider, heck, Knight Rider.

[42:04] How is there not a Knight Rider Pimball Machine?

[42:07] You're gonna sell, because if they only have to sell 888,

[42:10] they would sell more Knight Riders than they would of Evil Dead.

[42:14] And this is why Spooky's in the best position,

[42:16] because they can make these like freaking nostalgic things

[42:21] we love and they don't have to make thousands of them.

[42:24] And they can do all this fun stuff.

[42:25] And then you know, we're vibing there.

[42:28] We're vibing.

[42:29] Ian hasn't, Ian hasn't wrote anything yet.

[42:32] I'm sure, you know, this is what happens with good data.

[42:34] Then I get like a dude, dude, like dude, dude, dude, dude.

[42:38] Come on, dude, dude, dude.

[42:41] It's all right.

[42:42] It's all right.

[42:43] Stern Pimball does care too.

[42:45] They just have to make 800 games a week.

[42:49] And they can't be as transparent

[42:52] because they've got too many customers to feel.

[42:56] But look, Stern's learned a lesson.

[42:59] But the problem with Stern's transparency

[43:01] is that it only comes when they're desperate.

[43:06] They only started inviting people in

[43:09] when they needed to sell John Wicks.

[43:15] Now, I think they're gonna bring people in.

[43:19] I think they're gonna bring people in

[43:21] for this D&D launch before CES.

[43:24] So I don't know if I'm gonna get an invite.

[43:27] Maybe, like, but it's also the holidays.

[43:30] Like I don't really wanna travel in the winter months.

[43:34] But I mean, I'd go there and check it out.

[43:36] But as I said, send me a game.

[43:40] I'm the world's favorite Pimball podcaster

[43:44] for seven, eight years in a row, or eight.

[43:46] I don't know how many years now.

[43:47] I've lost track.

[43:48] I don't even know.

[43:49] World's favorite Pimball podcaster

[43:51] will one of the largest audiences in Pimball

[43:54] like in terms of community sizes of a content creator.

[43:59] I just send me a game.

[44:01] Put it in a box.

[44:02] I'll set it up here.

[44:04] We're sending it to automate it.

[44:05] It's a 30 minute drive.

[44:06] I'll happily go to automate it.

[44:08] And I'll bang on it for two days straight.

[44:13] But I'll go out there too.

[44:17] I'll go out there too.

[44:21] Ian, Ian, I learned the word vibe an hour ago,

[44:26] not even this week.

[44:29] I hope everybody supports Nudge Magazine.

[44:31] If you haven't.

[44:32] Ian, how can they support Nudge?

[44:35] Can you put a link in the chat here for people

[44:37] to order or subscribe?

[44:40] Nudge is a beautiful magazine.

[44:41] They just did a year end video.

[44:43] Really cool.

[44:45] Love watching me some,

[44:46] Kineata watch to you long.

[44:48] Oh, nice.

[44:49] Thanks, Pimball.

[44:51] I thank you guys.

[44:52] I've always enjoyed making this content for all of you.

[44:57] So, okay, so where are we at now?

[44:59] We got spooky vibe in.

[45:00] Let's go next.

[45:02] Who should we go to next?

[45:03] I'll let you guys.

[45:03] Who do you want to talk about next?

[45:06] I'm completely like,

[45:07] I think I've covered off on like the big stuff.

[45:09] I know we've got pulp fictional leads

[45:11] are starting to ship.

[45:12] Who cares?

[45:12] I don't care.

[45:13] I really, I could care less, man.

[45:15] It's like, who cares?

[45:17] Like I get it.

[45:18] I'm just over CGC.

[45:21] I'm over their whole thing.

[45:23] I think they've just,

[45:25] day late, dollar short on all of it.

[45:27] But anyway, guys, what do you want to talk about?

[45:30] We can talk about anything.

[45:31] Like you could ask me my thoughts on which dog I should get next

[45:35] or if it's snowed.

[45:36] Is this live?

[45:38] Yeah, it's live.

[45:39] Abe flips.

[45:40] What do you think we're here?

[45:41] We think this is recorded.

[45:42] You just wrote something live, Abe.

[45:45] And I just responded to you here.

[45:46] Look, I'll hold up a Twippy for

[45:48] Canadian's favorite pinball podcast, 2020, four years ago.

[45:54] Here's another one.

[45:55] I don't know what year this is.

[45:56] It doesn't say the inability for them

[45:59] to make the awards look consistent is silly.

[46:01] Every year they were different.

[46:05] Every year they were different.

[46:07] Now this one year it was like a gold base.

[46:11] Yep.

[46:12] At least they spelled Canada right all the years.

[46:15] We are live.

[46:16] What do you guys want to talk about?

[46:21] Hey, and did you have a nice

[46:22] cry session when come?

[46:23] Oh, damn, they're calling you out.

[46:26] Oh, don't bring politics into this show.

[46:30] You might lose your friends like I did.

[46:32] It's amazing.

[46:34] Anyway, any updates on Alice, we can go there.

[46:37] No, I've been talking to Melvin.

[46:41] All things, according to him,

[46:42] everything's going smoothly.

[46:43] The parts are coming in.

[46:45] And the plan is still to have Alice's

[46:47] on the line in January for Dutch pinball X.

[46:51] So I know he's working on code.

[46:54] And that's as much as I know.

[46:57] So there's nothing, nothing's different

[47:01] about Alice and when you should start

[47:04] to think about expecting games.

[47:07] So get ready.

[47:08] Now the thing about Alice is,

[47:10] you know, it's going to be a full year build.

[47:12] So I hope you're patient.

[47:15] What are your thoughts on the pinball cup?

[47:19] I thought it was stupid.

[47:23] I'll tell you why.

[47:25] Why did they make a pinball tournament

[47:28] skinned as a race, like a NASCAR race?

[47:34] And then why, first of all, just why that?

[47:37] Like why did it have to be this weird thing like that?

[47:42] And then this whole, like, depending on what tier you're in,

[47:45] you're like playing against people of similar skill set.

[47:50] So then who cares?

[47:51] Like I just thought the whole thing makes no sense.

[47:55] Like what I would love at the end of the year,

[47:58] is a much easier way to just,

[48:01] I would like to see the top 64 pinball players in the world

[48:05] play in a simple like March Madness bracket,

[48:09] but do it in a way where it's just more fun to watch.

[48:13] And I think, I don't know,

[48:14] maybe everybody just gets one ball per machine.

[48:16] You go, you go, then you go, and that's it.

[48:18] Like just want, like, you know what I'm saying?

[48:20] Like, because he's got, I don't want to watch for 35 minutes

[48:22] as like dudes are nudging machines

[48:24] around over three balls with extra balls.

[48:26] I don't want all that.

[48:28] I don't want all that.

[48:31] It's just not, I don't care.

[48:33] Look, gang, you know me,

[48:35] like I'm not gonna go play in a pinball cup.

[48:40] I don't care.

[48:42] Like, yeah, I don't even have time

[48:44] to turn on my machine most weeks

[48:47] because I can't play it when the kids are sleeping.

[48:50] But it's fine.

[48:51] I just, from a marketing standpoint,

[48:52] the thing that really made me be like,

[48:54] what is this is stupid?

[48:55] It's the stern vault.

[48:57] This whole like, we're gonna put games away

[49:00] for at least two years.

[49:02] And so you better get them right now.

[49:05] And that desire to create FOMO

[49:07] around existing inventory that, what's two years?

[49:11] Like, it's just all of it just feels so,

[49:15] like desperate to get games going out the door.

[49:18] Are you going to pinball at the beach, Todd?

[49:22] All right, that's a message for Todd.

[49:24] Pinball cup would have been fun if,

[49:26] while playing, you hear a unique sound, game audio,

[49:30] GI goes off, you enter a random mode,

[49:32] longer you last the more points you get.

[49:35] Are you going to be downtown for the New York City,

[49:38] New Year's celebration?

[49:41] Dwayne, it's funny that Dwayne said downtown

[49:48] cause I don't,

[49:49] I don't, you know, as a New York City resident

[49:53] for all those years, the ball drop is in time square.

[49:57] I would not go near time square in a million years

[50:01] for New Year's Eve.

[50:03] I think it is a terrible place to be.

[50:07] Dude, they, they, they hoards you like cattle

[50:10] and you can't go anywhere, you can't go to the bathroom.

[50:12] Like you're stuck in these like,

[50:14] holding areas for hours.

[50:15] Stupid, it's cold out.

[50:17] And I'm too old to stay up to midnight anyway.

[50:19] But if I was gonna do New Year's even New York City,

[50:22] I would be at Tommy Jazz and I would be celebrating there.

[50:25] That is where I might end up.

[50:28] Franchi, what is your beach diet?

[50:30] What?

[50:31] Oh my God.

[50:32] So yeah guys, I asked you who you want to talk about.

[50:36] I got one question about Al, it's nothing Al,

[50:39] it's like, love it.

[50:40] Well, let's just go up top and who cares?

[50:41] What do you guys want to talk about?

[50:42] Haven't heard from Derek.

[50:44] Best friend Derek is still a band in ship.

[50:47] He's over there in California trying to ban

[50:50] all internal combustion engines with the California politicians

[50:56] who have absolutely destroyed their state.

[51:00] They want to make owning any gas car illegal.

[51:03] Ugh, like these people, they're just misery.

[51:07] Like go look at the new Dodge Challenger Skatpack EV.

[51:11] It's the lamest car ever.

[51:14] Has no soul.

[51:16] Do Tesla's make good cars?

[51:18] All right.

[51:19] I mean, if you ask me, the thing about Tesla's now is they're just boring.

[51:25] The only one that's not boring is the Cybertruck,

[51:27] but it's also it's just like ridiculous on its own, on its own level.

[51:31] But they don't make good quality cars.

[51:34] When you get into a Tesla, they just, they're so crappy inside.

[51:38] What was Canadian Spotify wrapped this year?

[51:41] How do you even get to Spotify?

[51:43] I wrapped.

[51:44] Can someone show me how to do that?

[51:45] Because I have Spotify right here.

[51:49] And I'm not even sure like what, like everyone talks about Spotify wrapped.

[51:52] And I'm like, all right, where is it?

[51:54] Like I'm on my, if I'm on my homepage, like, what, what, what, what, where,

[52:01] where does it say my rap?

[52:05] I don't know.

[52:07] Like I thought it would just be like front and center.

[52:09] Like like, like, I don't know.

[52:12] Like do I type in wrapped?

[52:16] Let's see.

[52:19] I can do my, your top songs 2024 is at it.

[52:23] I mean, I get this.

[52:27] Is it the bottom one?

[52:29] Is it the bottom one?

[52:32] It's a tab up top.

[52:35] Let me see.

[52:39] There's no, I don't, oh, here we go.

[52:43] Let's see.

[52:45] I don't see a tab up here.

[52:47] Do you see a tab up here?

[52:49] Let's go here.

[52:57] Do I hit music first?

[52:59] Click playlist.

[53:00] All right.

[53:04] Playlist.

[53:06] All right.

[53:07] I click playlist.

[53:09] Yeah.

[53:09] And these are my playlist.

[53:10] Is it up top?

[53:13] Is it by Spotify?

[53:14] Do I hit that next?

[53:22] Yeah, I don't see him.

[53:33] First of all, it shouldn't be,

[53:36] it, no, it shouldn't even be this hard to find it.

[53:38] Let me just do rap 24 and rap.

[53:40] I don't know if I have an update at the Spotify app

[53:43] in a while.

[53:44] Let's see.

[53:46] Your top song.

[53:48] OK, rap.

[53:52] I mean, I don't know.

[53:55] Thing is, I play so much anime on here

[53:58] because when I drive the title, I don't know.

[54:01] I don't know.

[54:02] I don't know.

[54:03] I don't know.

[54:04] I don't know.

[54:05] I don't know.

[54:06] I don't know.

[54:07] I don't know.

[54:08] I don't know.

[54:09] I drive the Toyota.

[54:12] It's all like, and I mean, music.

[54:14] So I just saw like most of it just that

[54:16] because I'd play them over and over and over.

[54:19] All right, so like, what were we talking about before?

[54:23] I was asked what my rap is.

[54:25] The best motor cycle, I don't know anything about motorcycles.

[54:32] Talk about DPX Space Mission X.

[54:34] What is that?

[54:35] You mean Blade Runner?

[54:38] Look, the thing is rumors about what is in King Kong.

[54:44] I'm assuming King Kong has a big gorilla.

[54:50] You know, like, I think Kong is going to have a big Kong

[54:57] with like two hands.

[54:59] Like, you know, I think it's going to have to have something

[55:04] with big hands.

[55:05] I know we just got that in X-Men, but I mean,

[55:07] I know there was people in rumor being like X-Men looks

[55:09] like it should have been Kong with the big head and the two hands.

[55:13] You need the Empire State Building.

[55:16] But they might also do more Skull Island Kong

[55:19] than Kong being in New York.

[55:21] So you need to have, it is a Subaru.

[55:24] It is not a Toyota.

[55:25] I can't wait to Toyota makes a ground up version of this car.

[55:30] That is the trade-in will happen instantly.

[55:35] But yeah, you look, the thing about rumors gang is,

[55:41] I think we know them all.

[55:44] We know them all.

[55:46] And I just want something to come out that actually delivers

[55:53] and exceeds our expectations of what the rumors are.

[55:56] What is stopping?

[55:56] I think Superman's going to be made into a pin, for sure.

[56:01] I bet Kong is going to be like Frankenstein

[56:04] tossing down the play field.

[56:06] Maybe just change the building in Godzilla

[56:10] to the Empire State Building.

[56:11] That's true.

[56:12] Let's talk about why people insist on making their stuffing

[56:15] for holiday dinners with twigs and nuts

[56:17] and why they don't just make good old but I mean,

[56:21] I don't like, nobody likes raisins and stuffing.

[56:24] My mom makes the best stuffing, but it's homemade.

[56:26] But you got to use like, she uses like Italian bread,

[56:30] crumbles it up, like really makes it amazing.

[56:33] My mom's stuffing is like, I think it's bread based

[56:37] with sausage and it's just, oh, it's so good.

[56:42] It gets, it's just, no, no raisins, no,

[56:45] I don't think there's any veggies in it.

[56:48] Just like X-Men, Flipper's going wild,

[56:52] did I miss your reaction to Jenga's calling you out

[56:55] on the WAP podcast?

[56:58] I don't listen to WAP podcasts.

[57:03] I don't know, yeah, I don't really care

[57:05] what Jenga says, bro.

[57:06] I mean, I haven't even thought about that guy

[57:08] since he ever, like I don't.

[57:12] I don't.

[57:14] I don't even, I don't even, last,

[57:17] I don't even, is that show even like,

[57:20] is it even like free?

[57:22] Like I think they now charge you, right?

[57:24] To listen to that show.

[57:26] I'll tell you how much money I would pay

[57:29] to listen to Jenga's talk about Pimball.

[57:32] Zero, okay?

[57:34] Zero.

[57:35] I'll tell you, like, you know, that's it.

[57:38] I don't, again, I don't know how to even respond

[57:43] to something I haven't heard about.

[57:45] I'm doing my thing.

[57:46] Last time I checked, I've got more subscribers

[57:49] in every single Pimball podcast or combine.

[57:53] You know, some happy with that.

[57:56] So that's that, you know?

[57:58] I, if I had a dollar man for every time people call me out,

[58:03] it's just, it's bait man, cause they, again, they want it.

[58:06] They want me to talk about them on my platform,

[58:09] cause nobody cares about their platform.

[58:12] I mean, it's just that simple.

[58:14] That's it.

[58:15] That's it.

[58:16] We've got, we've got an audience.

[58:17] Like if they went live now, they, they, they, they're not doing it.

[58:20] If they ask for subscriptions, they don't get them.

[58:22] If they, you know, they do YouTube videos, nobody watches.

[58:25] They don't care.

[58:26] Like nobody cares.

[58:29] And you know, he used to be a friend and that's what happens.

[58:31] He's like, look, every once in a while, every once in a while,

[58:36] you just, you realize like I can be friends with grown adults

[58:39] and men and, you know, sometimes people just become,

[58:43] I mean, I don't even want to say a derogatory word,

[58:46] but they just like, you know, they get their panties in a wad

[58:51] and they can't, they can't handle getting jabbed at like or,

[58:55] like boys, you know, the thing about men is like,

[58:57] you got to be able to jab your friends and make and,

[59:00] and take the piss out of each other and, and pull each other's leg

[59:03] and like make fun of each other.

[59:05] I, when you can't take a joke about you,

[59:08] it's so, it's like you, if that's like having such thin skin

[59:14] is so funny to me because it's like, well, I don't know.

[59:18] I don't even, you know, it is what it is.

[59:21] Also gang, you all know this.

[59:25] You all know this.

[59:27] Yeah, because I don't take myself seriously, Robert.

[59:29] I really don't.

[59:30] I think people should wear hats to say, love a boy.

[59:34] I mean, my sort of torialed choices are all over the place,

[59:37] but I have fun every time I dress up.

[59:39] Like whenever I walk around,

[59:41] and whether it's my double breasted Ralph Warren or Gucci

[59:44] or this hat, like, do people are just like,

[59:46] they love watching people with like, who are having fun?

[59:49] The world's boring, man.

[59:51] People all drive boring cars, dress the same.

[59:55] And I get it, like, not everybody can feel confident enough

[59:59] to just express themselves a little bit differently,

[01:00:01] but I just, I grew up in a fashion family

[01:00:04] and I just like the fact that clothes can just,

[01:00:07] you can have fun with them

[01:00:09] and you shouldn't have to dress conservatively

[01:00:12] just because you're an adult.

[01:00:14] And look gang, trust me when I say this.

[01:00:17] I know what to wear when.

[01:00:21] And for those of you out there, you know,

[01:00:23] I dress up for this show because it's my,

[01:00:25] I dress a certain way for this show because it's a show.

[01:00:27] But if we're gonna go,

[01:00:29] if we're gonna go have like a nice espresso martini

[01:00:32] at the greatest bar in all of New York City,

[01:00:35] which is not Tommy Jazz, it is the grill,

[01:00:38] which used to be the four seasons.

[01:00:40] It is the only restaurant in the entire country,

[01:00:43] but you didn't know this.

[01:00:44] It's the only restaurant in the entire country.

[01:00:49] That is landmark.

[01:00:51] Do you know what that means?

[01:00:52] It means nobody could ever come into that restaurant bar

[01:00:56] and change a single thing.

[01:00:58] It is the most stunning bar you will ever have

[01:01:01] a drink underneath.

[01:01:02] The chandelier above the square bar is so incredible.

[01:01:07] And they make the best espresso martini in the world.

[01:01:11] So good.

[01:01:12] They don't even call it the espresso martini.

[01:01:14] They call it the vodka martini.

[01:01:16] That's how good it is now.

[01:01:17] I took Derek there.

[01:01:19] I've taken my friends there.

[01:01:20] I think each one is $22 or more.

[01:01:22] I think it's $24 a drink for one of those.

[01:01:25] So here's the thing though.

[01:01:27] Here's the thing.

[01:01:28] When I go to the grill,

[01:01:29] I don't wear a lover boy hats and Louis Vuitton jeans

[01:01:34] and stuff like no, I dress appropriately.

[01:01:37] Okay, so it's just like, that's it.

[01:01:40] That's how you should be.

[01:01:42] When in Rome, when in Rome?

[01:01:43] But if I'm just slubbing around the mall or whatever I want,

[01:01:46] I look like, yeah, I don't care if I would look like a clown.

[01:01:48] I don't care.

[01:01:49] You know, I'm confident.

[01:01:50] I get to get the come on and make love to a beautiful Irish woman

[01:01:53] who's a, you know, was winning beauty pageants.

[01:01:55] Now she decided to marry me.

[01:01:56] Friend is the best.

[01:01:58] You know, so it is what it is.

[01:01:59] It is what it is.

[01:02:00] I get to feel a beautiful woman who loves me

[01:02:03] and is attracted to who I am.

[01:02:06] And so that's all that matters.

[01:02:08] I don't care what other people think.

[01:02:10] If I care what other people think,

[01:02:12] if I cared, like, it doesn't matter.

[01:02:14] It doesn't matter.

[01:02:17] I make fun of you all the time.

[01:02:19] You should.

[01:02:21] You don't pronounce the ex-dutor Mary Christmas.

[01:02:25] Okay, I don't know.

[01:02:26] Albert, what's up, brother?

[01:02:28] I think Albert's angry Alpaca.

[01:02:30] Who cares how people dress?

[01:02:32] It would suck to be.

[01:02:34] Look, you know, the thing is,

[01:02:36] is like, the thing is, just have fun.

[01:02:39] It's journey's 2DM short.

[01:02:42] You know, I don't even know.

[01:02:44] I don't even like, that's it, you know?

[01:02:48] All the Canadian haters out there, they all listen.

[01:02:50] That's the funny part.

[01:02:52] It's like, they listen.

[01:02:53] I don't listen to anybody anymore.

[01:02:55] Like, I, like, everyone's in a while.

[01:02:58] Yes, I'll listen at the topics on the Pimble Show

[01:03:01] are good, you know, Zach's been putting a lot

[01:03:02] behind the paywall.

[01:03:04] I, again, like, I just, I don't like that format.

[01:03:07] And I told them this, like, they all know this.

[01:03:09] Like, I just don't like, team up a free show

[01:03:14] to then make people pay.

[01:03:16] Like, it doesn't work,

[01:03:17] it doesn't work on that platform.

[01:03:19] Don looks silly, always asking people to subscribe,

[01:03:22] only for $400 a month, it just doesn't make any sense.

[01:03:25] Like, why?

[01:03:26] Like, and the amount of effort,

[01:03:28] these, like, they have to do to make two different shows.

[01:03:33] It's a, you know, in the end,

[01:03:36] if they all just went behind the paywall,

[01:03:39] they would just make more money.

[01:03:41] You know, because, you know, they want the attention.

[01:03:45] And so I think Canadian realized,

[01:03:48] well, you can have both.

[01:03:49] If you make a really good show,

[01:03:51] people are really not gonna wanna go

[01:03:53] a week without having it.

[01:03:57] Again, 100% behind the paywall.

[01:04:02] I had, like, three to 5,000 people would listen

[01:04:06] for free, made $0.

[01:04:09] Maybe that was successful.

[01:04:11] I don't really think anyone hates you these days.

[01:04:15] We need a late night stream today.

[01:04:18] Yeah, like, no, I mean, look,

[01:04:19] I bet Jenga's hates me because, you know,

[01:04:23] he's just like, he's like Derek, you know?

[01:04:29] They just, they take their ball and they go home.

[01:04:33] They can't have a, if they get upset,

[01:04:35] they can't call you like a man.

[01:04:37] I mean this, I wanna just say this.

[01:04:39] Like, if you have a problem with somebody,

[01:04:42] just call them up and say something.

[01:04:44] Like don't make stupid videos, don't do stupid podcasts.

[01:04:48] Like, it's just like you can't, you can't,

[01:04:51] you can't even face the people.

[01:04:54] Cowards, man, they're cowards.

[01:04:55] They fight, they fight unfair.

[01:04:58] They fight behind closed doors,

[01:05:00] but they can't fight you face to face.

[01:05:02] Cause they know, destroy them, destroy them.

[01:05:05] I would do a show with that guy in a heartbeat, destroy him.

[01:05:08] Destroy him.

[01:05:10] Cause you know what he is, they don't even wanna answer

[01:05:12] like the tough questions.

[01:05:13] Like, what do you actually do for a living?

[01:05:15] That's always my favorite.

[01:05:15] Like, what do you actually do for a living?

[01:05:19] Right, like, what do you do every day?

[01:05:20] You wake up, what do you do?

[01:05:23] They don't really, walk around,

[01:05:25] Denmark, collect the, collect the money

[01:05:29] that my brothers, games make, and that's what I do.

[01:05:33] That's it. Wow, real, riveting.

[01:05:36] Great use of a college education.

[01:05:39] Everybody, you don't wanna,

[01:05:44] oh, we got a few more minutes.

[01:05:45] How's everybody doing?

[01:05:46] Happy holidays, people.

[01:05:48] Cargo shorts, I gotta go Christmas shop in the day.

[01:05:51] I got a few more, I gotta get, I don't know.

[01:05:54] You know, the thing is is like,

[01:05:56] we, Brendan and I made this deal to just like,

[01:06:00] not do grand gesture gifts, make sense.

[01:06:04] Like, we are in a very expensive time right now

[01:06:09] as we get the apartment sold,

[01:06:10] because we're paying for a New York City apartment,

[01:06:12] the maintenance, guys, maintenance, 3000 plus a month.

[01:06:16] Okay, this is just maintenance.

[01:06:17] Apartment's fully paid for.

[01:06:20] Every month, 3000, childcare, 6000, mortgage right now

[01:06:23] until I knocked the apartment against this,

[01:06:25] it's like 6000, you know, then you got,

[01:06:27] that's just, okay, so then you're at right now,

[01:06:30] 15, 17,000 dollars a month.

[01:06:34] That's not even car payment,

[01:06:35] that's not even insurance, that's not,

[01:06:37] it's like, hello, hello,

[01:06:40] who wants to go buy a 15,000 dollar Jersey Jack CE?

[01:06:44] So a year from now, less than a year from now,

[01:06:48] once we refinance with the apartment money

[01:06:51] against this house, I'll be at Gucci again,

[01:06:56] doing, doing champagne shots in the DIY shop,

[01:07:01] in the DIY room.

[01:07:02] So like, you know, like buying expensive Christmas gifts

[01:07:06] at this juncture, this year,

[01:07:10] doesn't make much sense, but that being said,

[01:07:12] I know myself and I'll probably just go drop

[01:07:14] like 10 G's on her today at the mall,

[01:07:16] like I'll go to Cartier or Tiffany,

[01:07:18] that's what Keny to does,

[01:07:20] I'm, ah, you know, I was like,

[01:07:21] and then I just think about how much I love her,

[01:07:23] I've got the money, I'm like, well, cool,

[01:07:25] only live once, I'd rather buy Brenda like a 10K,

[01:07:29] like piece of jewelry than a pinball machine,

[01:07:34] take care of her first.

[01:07:37] Anyway, she is taking care of me.

[01:07:39] Don't get me wrong, I mean,

[01:07:40] I mean, you've got to this house too.

[01:07:42] Can't quite say that even though it's true,

[01:07:44] you know, you know what, you try to tell your wife,

[01:07:46] like, oh, I did get you this house,

[01:07:47] you're like, well, what do you mean you've got me this house?

[01:07:48] And when I was like, well,

[01:07:50] where do you think the down payment came from?

[01:07:52] What do you mean, wait, wait, wait,

[01:07:53] like, we're a team, 100% a team,

[01:07:56] but financially, we were not equals,

[01:08:00] like, but, you know, but like,

[01:08:02] the work she does trust me is she does way more than I do.

[01:08:05] She got all this together, she found this house,

[01:08:08] she found the realtor, she did,

[01:08:09] women will like run circles around men

[01:08:14] in their ability to work hard to stay focused,

[01:08:16] to get all the paperwork together,

[01:08:18] to get everything going, like,

[01:08:19] like, I would have just sat on my ass in that dumb apartment

[01:08:23] and still be there being like, well, it's not so bad.

[01:08:26] So, I know.

[01:08:30] Oh, this is the most tap dancing we've seen this morning,

[01:08:33] Ian, geez, come on, let me get her a copy

[01:08:36] of Nudge Magazine for Christmas

[01:08:38] and then we'll get divorced.

[01:08:41] Hey, you going after operators now?

[01:08:44] Hans, what are you talking about?

[01:08:47] Hans, I feel like you're like stuck in a moment.

[01:08:50] I feel like Hans, for some reason,

[01:08:51] has been stuck in a moment of, I don't know why, man,

[01:08:54] Hans, it's time to let it go.

[01:08:55] We didn't even talk about operators.

[01:08:58] But, you know, I just, Hans, what was the thing you were all,

[01:09:02] hung up on earlier?

[01:09:03] I don't even remember, man.

[01:09:05] I don't even, like, if you're operating games

[01:09:07] and you're making money, God bless you.

[01:09:09] What else, what do you want me to say?

[01:09:10] Like, I don't know, you know,

[01:09:12] that's what these things were supposed to be for.

[01:09:15] There was a reason there was a coin slot

[01:09:17] in the front of every game, it's to make money.

[01:09:19] Like, it's idiotic that we spend all this money,

[01:09:22] put them in our home and they make no money.

[01:09:25] It's a coin-operated device.

[01:09:28] This is staying on topic as often as an orby pod.

[01:09:33] Well, we already covered what's going on.

[01:09:34] Getting it to the end of the year,

[01:09:35] it's the holidays, it's Christmas on Wednesday.

[01:09:39] I think everyone is in the same boat.

[01:09:42] The games have to be magical, you're not going anywhere near them.

[01:09:46] There's a lot of rumored games coming out.

[01:09:48] We just want to see them.

[01:09:49] We want to make sure there is good

[01:09:50] as our expectations of them are in our heads.

[01:09:55] Games are way too expensive.

[01:09:56] Everybody knows that, I don't have to tell you that.

[01:09:59] And I think we're going to see more and more people just wait.

[01:10:03] I don't, like, why would anybody rush in on anything

[01:10:06] unless it's a Keith L. Winnele, and there's only 500,

[01:10:10] unless it's a dream theme.

[01:10:12] And everything else is going to be, you know,

[01:10:15] just spectate for a while and you'll be fine.

[01:10:18] Metallica, we didn't talk about Metallica,

[01:10:22] but it's, you know, like Metallica is going to do just fine.

[01:10:26] I think what's going to be scary is, like, you know,

[01:10:29] in like a year from now, we're going to have like thousands

[01:10:31] of each version of Metallica out there

[01:10:34] that there's going to be so many Metallica's on the market.

[01:10:39] The LEs are definitely cool.

[01:10:42] They, you know, I mean it when I say it, like,

[01:10:47] I think the smart people sold out at 18,000.

[01:10:49] I don't think you're ever going to see that again.

[01:10:51] I think it was a sell it for 18,000, make $5,000,

[01:10:57] go buy a premium for $5,000 cheaper than it, you know,

[01:11:00] then your premium only cost you what, like $4,500.

[01:11:04] And you're, for $4,500, you're having the same exact experience

[01:11:08] as a guy that spent 18,000 on it.

[01:11:11] Think about that for a minute.

[01:11:13] The $14,000 difference to play the same exact game.

[01:11:18] I just think owning LEs to me, and I mean,

[01:11:22] it's just the whole vibe around having the nicer version,

[01:11:29] that's exactly the same game as everybody else.

[01:11:32] Does anyone know where a cat woman edition of Batman is for sale?

[01:11:37] If you do, can you PM me?

[01:11:40] Because I didn't even talk off of it like SLE, SLE, you know,

[01:11:44] so apparently the cat woman version of Batman

[01:11:48] was built at a later date, it's built better,

[01:11:51] they fixed a lot of the issues, it shoots way better,

[01:11:55] and also the cat woman edition is kind of now become

[01:12:00] very rare, like you don't see them anywhere.

[01:12:03] So they weren't numbered, but it's a,

[01:12:07] it's a different edition.

[01:12:09] I won the one thing I'm curious,

[01:12:11] I think Stern might do a 60th anniversary of Batman next year,

[01:12:15] and that could be a real thing, or 2026 maybe it is,

[01:12:21] because I think it was 2016 we got Batman,

[01:12:25] so maybe it's in, yeah, a year after next.

[01:12:28] There's more than 100 cat woman's out there.

[01:12:31] That's not true, they only made 100?

[01:12:35] No, that can't be accurate.

[01:12:38] I don't think Stern's ever made that low of a number ever.

[01:12:43] Chris, I know, I don't know where you got that number.

[01:12:50] Stranger things is weird frustrating basically

[01:12:53] up that is much better than it should be.

[01:12:55] What does it's the theme, man?

[01:12:56] I mean, when Stranger Things music comes on and the upside down

[01:13:00] and it really does give you some wow moments.

[01:13:05] Problem is they can't do a new art package.

[01:13:09] They don't need to do a new art package.

[01:13:11] Franchise given them enough art that they could just arrange

[01:13:14] that art, they own the art now, right?

[01:13:17] And you know what I'm saying?

[01:13:18] Like I think when Franchise makes that art for Stern,

[01:13:24] whether the license holder owns it or Stern,

[01:13:26] but the Stern can now rearrange it without having to go back

[01:13:30] to Franchise, I would assume.

[01:13:35] So we'll see.

[01:13:41] I'm assuming they have all the high res images.

[01:13:46] Yeah, I mean, look, Franchise,

[01:13:49] if Franchise said he'd go back and work with them,

[01:13:51] look, they have a dialogue, those guys, again,

[01:13:53] everything's negotiable.

[01:13:55] I think the L.E. should have lifetime benefits

[01:13:57] like a lifetime warranty or something.

[01:14:01] Nothing gives you a lifetime warranty, man.

[01:14:03] Kevin, you'd be out of business

[01:14:06] in less than a lifetime if they offered stuff like that.

[01:14:11] You're gonna be giving people warranty on 15 years later

[01:14:14] on a broken, Sparky, no.

[01:14:23] Diddy's pinball mods, not even live.

[01:14:26] I think that's what the contract is.

[01:14:30] What's the clown comment?

[01:14:34] We don't talk about Abba, we don't talk about,

[01:14:39] did anyone even buy?

[01:14:40] Did anyone out there buy the Funhouse remake?

[01:14:44] That whole thing, man.

[01:14:46] I think Rick at Planetary just really botched

[01:14:52] all these remakes, like the strategy around it all,

[01:14:57] is just, he should have just done it better.

[01:15:02] We're only gonna make this many of each.

[01:15:06] There was gonna be one or two tier of the versions,

[01:15:08] and that's it, and I just like the code updates

[01:15:13] they've done have been bad.

[01:15:19] I want to make my own for my Jurassic Park.

[01:15:21] Look, I don't think also like Spooky's gonna have an issue

[01:15:23] of Franchi Goes and like touches up another version

[01:15:26] of Batman, that's different, you know?

[01:15:32] Look, gang, gang, it's a beautiful day here

[01:15:39] in Rueiden, Connecticut.

[01:15:41] I wanna encourage everybody to burry, burry in the snow.

[01:15:48] Any bad vibes you might have with anybody in this hobby,

[01:15:51] I think everybody probably has a tenside enemy

[01:15:54] that is they've blocked, they've ignored.

[01:15:59] I think it's life's too short.

[01:16:01] You know, when people drop in, like,

[01:16:03] oh, this person says something about you,

[01:16:05] this person's like, well, you listen to this show,

[01:16:08] like I'm not going down a list of people attacking them,

[01:16:11] and if people wanna use their platform for that,

[01:16:13] it doesn't matter.

[01:16:15] I'm a 100% confident in who I am,

[01:16:18] and that this is the place to be.

[01:16:20] And I think, you know, that's why we've got

[01:16:22] a great audience here.

[01:16:23] I'm actually happy, I'm seeing more people join here

[01:16:26] than we used to have on Facebook.

[01:16:27] I think YouTube will help more people

[01:16:30] to discover the show as well.

[01:16:33] And, well, you don't bend over because people,

[01:16:35] well, the thing is Josh, it's got it,

[01:16:38] like, the thing is this too.

[01:16:39] It's like, I just don't care to be friends

[01:16:42] with the manufacturers.

[01:16:46] I'm openly transparent about this.

[01:16:48] Would I love to have a senior level marketing creative role,

[01:16:53] like a chief creative officer,

[01:16:55] like a CMO role at a pinball company one day?

[01:16:57] Sure.

[01:16:59] But that's the only thing that would excite me.

[01:17:01] I'm not just, you know, I wanna help them understand

[01:17:05] that after 12 years of studying this industry

[01:17:08] and this hobby and the community,

[01:17:11] that I think I know more about the mindset of people

[01:17:15] who buy their games, and I mean this,

[01:17:18] like the new-in-box home buyer

[01:17:21] is the most underserved community member

[01:17:25] when it comes to the decisions these pinball companies make,

[01:17:28] and then yet they're the most important

[01:17:29] for these pinball companies to survive.

[01:17:31] Because they've treated everybody,

[01:17:33] like their mindless cattle that will just buy anything.

[01:17:37] And maybe they were not wrong there

[01:17:40] because people were mindlessly buying everything

[01:17:42] for so many years, but that's over.

[01:17:45] Like that is over.

[01:17:49] I know.

[01:17:50] Part of me is just like, I don't even wanna think,

[01:17:53] you know, what a salary would be like at Stern

[01:17:57] for a role like that.

[01:17:58] I bet it's half as much as I make right now.

[01:18:02] But, you know, I don't know.

[01:18:05] It is what it is.

[01:18:07] Who knows? I don't know.

[01:18:08] I really don't know.

[01:18:09] I can't even speculate.

[01:18:09] I can't even speculate.

[01:18:12] Everybody, look, we're all gonna have a good time

[01:18:16] over the next couple of weeks.

[01:18:17] I hope you guys are all getting the eggnog ready.

[01:18:21] This is the time of year to meet friends,

[01:18:24] have merry drinks with people,

[01:18:27] and have cookies, and watch little kids eyes light up.

[01:18:32] I mean, I can't tell you what excitement awaits

[01:18:38] in this household.

[01:18:40] I, I, I, Killian's gifts are gonna blow him away.

[01:18:45] He is so excited.

[01:18:46] He loves the Paw Patrol.

[01:18:48] And I have a big surprise for him in that space.

[01:18:50] He got a bunch of stuff coming.

[01:18:53] To see the holidays through the eyes of a child

[01:18:56] is just the most magical thing.

[01:18:59] And even this morning when he woke up

[01:19:01] and it was snowing and there was snow on the ground,

[01:19:04] he's like, daddy, I wanna show you.

[01:19:05] Look, daddy, the, you know, and he's so cute

[01:19:07] because he gets excited that there's also snow

[01:19:11] in the backyard and the front yard.

[01:19:12] He's like, and daddy, come here.

[01:19:14] Look, there's also snow back here.

[01:19:16] Like every little thing makes their world just light up

[01:19:21] and they get so excited.

[01:19:23] And I'm really, really, just, I mean,

[01:19:27] I can't express to all of you what family means, right?

[01:19:33] And you guys all know this and I'm happy to say that

[01:19:35] I feel like we're all part of an extended pinball family.

[01:19:40] And as long as we have each other and hang out

[01:19:42] and have good, you know, good conversation like this,

[01:19:47] I think all of us, you know, don't really feel that alone.

[01:19:51] I think we've got our immediate families

[01:19:53] and I think we've got our pinball family.

[01:19:55] And we've got a fun product that there's not too much of it.

[01:19:58] I think that's why I love the most about pinball.

[01:19:59] There's too many cars out there.

[01:20:01] There's too many watches.

[01:20:01] There's too much other stuff.

[01:20:03] Like I went on eBay last night.

[01:20:06] I typed in Nintendo and like people selling like 80,000.

[01:20:10] Like $400,000 Nintendo DS Pokemon cards.

[01:20:13] I'm like, what's wrong with all this crap?

[01:20:16] At least in our world, the prices do get crazy

[01:20:19] but at least you have an understanding

[01:20:22] of how pinball market place happens

[01:20:26] and the forces at play are easy to understand.

[01:20:31] I don't understand how a sealed copy

[01:20:33] of Mike Tyson's punch out could ever be worth $200,000.

[01:20:38] Why would anybody even care about an unopened Nintendo game?

[01:20:43] Like I just don't even understand that.

[01:20:46] And at least our hobby isn't driven

[01:20:49] by just ludicrous stuff like that.

[01:20:51] Like with the, you know what I'm saying?

[01:20:52] Like there's no $100,000.

[01:20:54] We only made one X-Men with a different color leg on it.

[01:20:58] Like you know, some variation.

[01:21:00] I mean, it's just, no.

[01:21:04] Yeah, I love the Superman trailer.

[01:21:06] I thought it was amazing.

[01:21:08] It gave me goosebumps.

[01:21:11] It gave me goosebumps.

[01:21:12] I'm also love and skeleton crew.

[01:21:13] If you haven't seen the new Star Wars TV show,

[01:21:16] Skeleton Crew, it is one of my favorites.

[01:21:20] It's like Goonies meets Star Wars.

[01:21:22] It is absolutely incredible.

[01:21:24] I love this story.

[01:21:26] I don't want to spoil it,

[01:21:27] but the story is what I love so much.

[01:21:30] It just, I miss good storytelling, you know,

[01:21:32] because for the longest time,

[01:21:35] Disney was taking everything and jamming their social

[01:21:40] woke D.E.I. crap down our throats.

[01:21:42] I mean, when you look at the Acolyte,

[01:21:44] that's all that show was.

[01:21:46] It was like jamming every social D.E.I. representation thing

[01:21:52] that Disney wants to jam down our throats.

[01:21:55] That's the Acolyte.

[01:21:57] Cool.

[01:21:58] Story wasn't that good.

[01:21:59] You're canceled.

[01:22:02] Now I'm watching a great story with kids,

[01:22:05] and it's not trying, you know, I'm not gonna,

[01:22:07] there's not gonna be like all this forced BS happening

[01:22:11] in it, like it's not, whoa, it just is great.

[01:22:18] Well, I think a skeleton crew pin,

[01:22:20] knowing how fun the show is,

[01:22:24] would be awesome.

[01:22:26] But I worry though that I don't want them to make it

[01:22:29] until the story is complete.

[01:22:31] I don't like, I don't like they're like missing out.

[01:22:36] Stranger Things is like that.

[01:22:37] Like the pins never gonna capture all the show.

[01:22:42] Look, no Star Wars pinball machine should be praised

[01:22:49] because it's decent.

[01:22:50] That is a failure.

[01:22:53] If your Star Wars machine is decent, you've failed.

[01:23:00] Yeah, Gina, Gina got the raw end of the deal.

[01:23:03] Anyway, everybody, look, we're at 1130.

[01:23:06] I know I started a little bit late,

[01:23:07] but everybody have a very,

[01:23:10] because we won't be talking until after Christmas.

[01:23:12] Have a very, very, very Merry Christmas.

[01:23:15] Thank you guys for subscribing and for hanging out

[01:23:18] and don't worry, more podcasts are coming.

[01:23:21] I'm off from work.

[01:23:21] So you're probably gonna get podcasts all the time.

[01:23:24] And I think we will, we see a teaser.

[01:23:26] I think we're gonna see Stern tease it like January,

[01:23:29] like fourth or that Friday before the week of the seventh.

[01:23:35] I love Andor.

[01:23:36] I mean, I named my second child, Cassian,

[01:23:40] after Cassian Andor.

[01:23:42] I don't know if you guys know that.

[01:23:44] He's a leader of the rebellion.

[01:23:46] I think Andor is one of the greatest things ever.

[01:23:48] And I just love the name Cassian.

[01:23:50] I love Killian and Cassian.

[01:23:53] Both my boys have my initials so that

[01:23:56] when I have all my monogram stuff, it works.

[01:24:01] Andor is amazing.

[01:24:02] All right, everybody.

[01:24:04] The happy holidays to you and your families

[01:24:07] we'll talk soon later.

[01:24:09] One good guy.

[01:24:12] His first call he a Saturday so quick he's a princess,

[01:24:16] never a man, não absolut traumas.

[01:24:20] But now my four kids aren't built up to make it hard.

[01:24:22] But good boy, if my three kids don't create drive,

[01:24:25] but you always of course,

[01:24:26] have to by your can Vanne already sees the most

[01:24:29] damn strong fallen guy out of it.

[01:24:31] But when I did see him,

[01:24:33] I realized that I do,

[01:24:35] became testified with same education minister
