[00:00] No, I won't be afraid, oh I won't be afraid, just as long as you stand, stand by me.

[00:14] Welcome everybody to Canade is Pinball Podcast, how's everybody doing?

[00:24] It is July 10th, Superman is in theaters, it seems like people are liking the movie, I

[00:30] might go see it tomorrow.

[00:32] Where is a Superman pinball machine?

[00:35] I think everybody would love to see The Man of Steel in a pinball game, right?

[00:40] It's a great theme for pinball.

[00:42] Now would you base it on one of the movies, would you base it on the comic book, I think

[00:48] any Superman pin, unless it was made by like Home Pin would do really really well.

[00:55] I would love to see a little bit more Batman back in pinball, I know everybody out there

[01:00] would love it if Spooky Pinball or Stern or Jersey Jack made a new version with modern

[01:07] technology, Batman 89, the Tim Burton classic with Michael Kenan and Jack Nicholson, how

[01:16] awesome would that be?

[01:17] I know there already is a pinball machine based on that movie, but man it's right there,

[01:23] just make it again, make it again and make it better from the ground up.

[01:29] These modern pinball machines are really the most beautiful pinball has ever been and stuff

[01:35] that was made years ago just can't hold a candle to what you can do now and I think we

[01:41] all would just like to see better themes overall.

[01:45] I think everybody would love to see better themes in pinball overall.

[01:49] Now look Harry Potter is out, I'm in the thread, I think there's a little bit of a delay on

[01:55] shipment as they fix some of the artwork on the play fields, but overall Harry Potter is

[02:01] getting good reviews and I think it's simply because it shoots fine.

[02:04] I think it's simply because it's a good shooter.

[02:07] It really is a good shooter.

[02:08] It is maybe the second or best Jersey Jack shooting game to date.

[02:13] I still find Elton John to be a better shooter than Harry Potter, but both of them are really

[02:18] fun to shoot.

[02:20] It's a damn expensive pin though.

[02:22] What do you think is going to happen to the collector's edition value on a Harry Potter

[02:27] right now?

[02:28] I mean right now they're 15,000, none of them are selling for less than 15, but I have to

[02:33] imagine come the end of the year and we're getting Star Wars, some Harry Potter fatigue

[02:40] sets in, there's thousands of these games out there and I think there's going to be

[02:45] a lot of CEs out there and they're going to make more than a thousand of these CEs.

[02:51] They're going to be everywhere and I think we're going to see these games really, really

[02:56] go down in value simply because there's just going to be so many of them.

[03:00] Now you know how I feel, if I were you, I still think the smart buy right now would be to get

[03:07] the arcade edition for $10,000 because I don't think the arcade edition is going to be worth

[03:12] like five in a year, but I could definitely see the $15,000 CE losing about $5,000 in

[03:22] value.

[03:22] I actually don't think the CE is going to hold that well at all and again the topper

[03:27] is not nice, the artwork is different, it's unique.

[03:30] It's not wow though, I mean it's like when you see the game in person, it just doesn't

[03:36] pop the way some of the other Jersey Jack games pop.

[03:40] I think losing the glossiness on the cabinet does take away from the wow factor, but it's

[03:46] definitely unique.

[03:47] I'll give them that.

[03:48] All right, so what else is happening in the pinball world this week?

[03:52] I'm hearing more and more people say that it's most likely going to be Star Wars episode

[03:58] four, five and six.

[04:00] If Stern remakes the original trilogy with John Borg and hopefully launches it with

[04:08] Spike three, that's going to be really interesting and I think it's going to happen in just like

[04:14] a couple months.

[04:16] And so we should see at the end of August, early September is usually when we get Stern's

[04:21] next cornerstone game.

[04:23] Right now they want to sell you a Jaws 50th.

[04:26] I just saw the unboxing of that game from Great American Pinball, I believe.

[04:30] I love their unboxing video because it like speeds up the unboxing.

[04:35] It is not fun watching someone over 45 minutes slowly pull a pinball machine out of a box.

[04:44] But when they speed it up and they set up the armor and they put on the red legs and we got

[04:48] to see what the game looks like.

[04:50] I'm still on the fence about Jaws 50th.

[04:53] I don't hate it.

[04:54] I just don't love it.

[04:55] It's just kind of a little plain Jane looking.

[04:59] It's definitely a divisive art package with that red armor.

[05:03] I'm hearing people say they love it and they hate it.

[05:06] Now look, good art gets a reaction.

[05:08] So it's definitely going to stand out amongst a lineup of pinball machines.

[05:13] In general, Jaws continues to hold value nicely.

[05:16] I'm looking at the Jaws LEs and they're really sort of not selling anywhere south of 14.

[05:21] So if you bought a Jaws LE, your game has held value over a year and a half,

[05:26] which doesn't happen very often.

[05:29] It's holding better value than even Metallica remastered and there were only 500 of those.

[05:35] I think for a lot of people out there, Jaws is a dream theme.

[05:40] I think it's a keeper and I think it's bolted to a lot of people's floors.

[05:44] Stern should sell an SLE that they actually do bolt to your floor and you can never sell it.

[05:50] So then we're looking at Star Wars next from John Borg.

[05:53] Then I think we're going to get a Tron remaster to go with the Tron movie.

[05:57] And then Keith Elwyn's Pokemon, which should come out sometime in January, February.

[06:03] And who's up after that?

[06:04] Is Brian Eddy next or Jack Danger?

[06:07] I think X-Men came out before Dungeons and Dragons.

[06:12] I want to say it was before.

[06:13] So that means Brian Eddy would be up next.

[06:17] Who knows? Who knows?

[06:18] I definitely feel like Jack Danger is really probably feeling like you guys better give me

[06:25] everything on the next game.

[06:26] Getting screwed over on the X-Men code.

[06:29] I know that was really tough for Jack to see his creative game, not get the time it needed.

[06:34] And the time worked against that game on perfecting the geometry a little bit and also the software,

[06:40] which just wasn't ready for prime time.

[06:43] And hopefully that game continues to get better and better.

[06:46] I'm reading people with John Wick's.

[06:48] This is funny.

[06:48] People with John Wick don't like the new code that they want to go back and get the old code.

[06:54] Now Stern is telling people, we won't give you the old software.

[06:59] We're not going to distribute it.

[07:00] So is that fair?

[07:02] Like, why shouldn't you if I bought a $13,000 pinball machine?

[07:08] Why am I not allowed if I liked the previous code?

[07:13] Why am I not allowed to get that from the manufacturer?

[07:16] I mean, that's kind of crazy when you think about it.

[07:19] I understand why Stern doesn't want people to have older code because with Insider connected

[07:25] and other things happening on the latest code, they want every game to universally be the same

[07:30] with the most updated code.

[07:32] A little weird that they made this game less enjoyable for people.

[07:35] I think they added too many multi-balls and I think they made the game too easy,

[07:39] which is not something we say very often.

[07:41] In fact, I would argue that too many pinball machines are way too complex.

[07:45] Like people just don't know what's going on.

[07:47] I was reading on Pinside, a gentleman was playing Dune and really enjoyed it.

[07:53] He enjoyed the theme integration.

[07:55] He enjoyed how the game communicates to you, what you need to do in an easy fashion.

[08:01] Like it doesn't mean the game is shallow.

[08:03] It just communicates to you and what's on the screen telegraphs to you what to do in the game.

[08:08] And then he went over to Harry Potter and he's like,

[08:10] I have no idea what I'm doing here.

[08:12] Like another JJP, eight things happening at once and he's not wrong.

[08:17] And I think that is still the main feedback I have for all of these Jersey Jack games.

[08:22] They're all over baked.

[08:24] They're over produced.

[08:25] You know, when you listen to Stand By Me, the song is so beautiful and it's just a vocalist and a bass.

[08:32] And that's it.

[08:34] And you don't need 18 instruments.

[08:37] Guns and Roses, when they made their best music, only had five members.

[08:41] When they overproduced the sound of their music and all of a sudden you had all this stuff

[08:46] happening up on stage outside of the Core Five, it lost the rawness and the energy that was Guns and Roses.

[08:54] And that's why I think people are appreciating Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[08:58] And I'm reading people who are playing that game in a world of very complex games,

[09:02] in a world where so many games you walk up to them, you have no idea what to do.

[09:07] Sometimes it's just refreshing to get up to a machine and it's like a Baldy Williams error machine

[09:14] in which you know exactly where to shoot because that's the only thing blinking.

[09:18] And those are the only lights lit up.

[09:21] And the game is communicating exactly what you need to do, what you need to do to progress through the mode or in the game.

[09:27] And it doesn't require like a Bible full of instructions on what to do.

[09:32] Every time Keith Johnson would hand out that huge like diner menu of how you play his games,

[09:41] you're like, bro, this is not what people want.

[09:43] This is not exciting to anybody.

[09:45] And so I think more simplicity is a good thing.

[09:48] I think the greatest coder of all time is still Lyman Sheets.

[09:52] And he will always be the greatest pinball coder.

[09:55] God rest his soul because he knew the perfect way to balance a game where you could walk up to a game

[10:02] and you could get things going and his games were easy to understand how to get through them.

[10:08] They were also deep.

[10:09] So if you were a good player, you knew the journey, you knew how to get to that stuff.

[10:13] And stuff might be 20 minutes away from you or 30 minutes away from you,

[10:17] but you still knew exactly how to get it.

[10:20] To this day, I still do miss out of all the games I've had.

[10:24] I think the two games I missed the most were Lord of the Rings and Batman 66.

[10:28] Now, look, Keith Johnson did Lord of the Rings.

[10:31] Now, imagine if Keith Johnson did Lord of the Rings today.

[10:34] He would have ruined it.

[10:35] He would have ruined it because he would have put 18 things on the screen.

[10:39] The DMD actually made Keith Johnson a better coder because it forced him not to overdo it.

[10:46] And I think this 27 inch screen has invited him to put in so much insanity into these games

[10:53] that they just lose their enjoyment.

[10:55] OK, so speaking of like enjoyment, I got a great email from Peter.

[10:59] Peter wanted me to talk a little bit about Insider Connected and what I would love to see

[11:04] happen on Insider Connected in 2025, 2026.

[11:08] And I have to be honest, I haven't had much time with Insider Connected.

[11:12] I don't own a Stern machine.

[11:14] I'm not even registered with the QR code because I don't care about collecting any of those badges.

[11:20] I just don't.

[11:21] What was interesting about what Peter was saying, though, is if you think about it,

[11:24] Stern knows everything about how you play each of your games.

[11:29] And they could do more with Insider Connected to reward you.

[11:34] Right now, it's mostly about these achievements and there's a certain number of achievements

[11:38] with each game and you're trying to collect all the badges.

[11:42] So there might be something like 68 or 69 achievements in Elvira and you're trying to get them all.

[11:48] But once you get them, there's really nothing else to do.

[11:51] And they haven't really done more.

[11:54] They haven't been more creative with it.

[11:56] They haven't done stuff like measuring how long you've played your game.

[12:01] And what if you've played your game a thousand hours?

[12:04] Does that unlock something?

[12:06] Have they connected it to the bars, right, on location?

[12:09] So if you do this, you could trade it in for a drink ticket.

[12:12] I don't know.

[12:12] Like, I don't think Stern's done this stuff yet.

[12:15] You know, and also when you think about it, because it's connected to the Internet,

[12:19] wouldn't they be able to sort of make code adjustable in real time?

[12:25] So, for example, Peter had a good idea.

[12:28] Like, if it knows you've never been to the final wizard mode, do you get invited?

[12:32] Maybe some midnight madness.

[12:34] We're at midnight tonight.

[12:36] If you play your game, we're going to unlock the final wizard mode for you so you can

[12:40] finally experience it.

[12:42] Like, that would be fun.

[12:43] You know, the one thing they've never really done and nobody's done this.

[12:46] And it is crazy that it is 2025 and we don't even have like any pinball,

[12:52] like any mass produced pinball machine that's really fully connected to the

[12:56] Internet and connecting two games to each other.

[13:00] The fact that you can't co-op play any pinball machine is ridiculous.

[13:06] The fact that you couldn't have special versus modes.

[13:09] So for example, if you have Ninja Turtles, I could be playing as the Turtles and

[13:14] you could be playing as the foot clan and your two machines are synced up or you

[13:19] could both be playing as Turtles.

[13:21] Like I'm Raphael, you're Donatello, and we're both playing the game at the same

[13:25] time in fun modes that are designed for two machines at the same time.

[13:30] I know that would require some more software, but that would be a lot of fun.

[13:35] And here's the reason why I think they don't want to do it.

[13:37] I think the reason why they don't really want to connect games and have like fun

[13:42] player versus player stuff happening, because I think that would add a lot of

[13:47] replay value and a lot of fun.

[13:50] And I don't think they want that because when you think about video games and a

[13:55] game like Halo, how many of you play through the storyline?

[13:59] No, you go online and you play with friends.

[14:02] And because you enjoy Halo, you're not buying every first person shooter that

[14:06] comes out.

[14:07] And I think if you own a pinball machine and that single machine was so much fun

[14:12] because every night you and your friends go online and do different fun quests in

[14:16] your games together on the same game, you might not want to buy three to four

[14:22] games a year like they want you to.

[14:24] You know what I'm saying?

[14:25] Like that game might now satiate and give you so much connected fun with your

[14:30] friends that also own it that you'd be good.

[14:33] Part of me feels like some of the strategy here and you got to remember

[14:36] like these companies to survive need to keep manufacturing games and keep that

[14:41] line going is they want you to buy the next game and the next game.

[14:46] They don't want you to fall in love with the game so much that you might not need

[14:49] more games.

[14:51] It's a really weird industry.

[14:52] It really is when you stop and think about the concept of owning these things in

[14:58] your home and not only that owning like a lot of them in your home and how big

[15:04] they are and how much room they take up.

[15:06] I mean, room is really the number one problem for all the pinball companies

[15:11] because people have to sell games to bring in the new stuff.

[15:15] If they're losing a lot of money on the sale, they're not going to want to sell

[15:19] it or they're not going to find buyers and then they're not going to be able to

[15:22] buy the new stuff.

[15:23] But I would definitely love to see more creativity when it comes to internet

[15:27] connectivity.

[15:28] Look at Harry Potter.

[15:29] What a great game to internet connect.

[15:31] No, nothing.

[15:32] Jersey Jack for all of its technology for all the money they have.

[15:37] You think they could do something a little bit more interesting with their

[15:41] online connectivity as we're in the middle of summer.

[15:44] I think summer is a period where a lot of people are out and about.

[15:48] You're probably not pulling the trigger on pinball machines.

[15:51] You probably are waiting for something you ordered.

[15:54] A lot of people are going to be waiting for Dune.

[15:56] I heard someone ordered it day one.

[15:58] October is when they're expected to get the game.

[16:01] Harry Potter's are not flying out the door.

[16:04] Stern's the only one who when they reveal a game like Jaws 50th, it's already on the line.

[16:10] Hundreds will be made a week.

[16:12] You'll be able to get one.

[16:14] They want to get you those games as fast as they can.

[16:17] Look at Predator.

[16:18] Look at Predator.

[16:19] It's not even going to be on the line until August, September, which means if you

[16:23] ordered one now, man, you know, your money's locked in, non refundable, not a smart move.

[16:30] I'm trying to warm up to that game.

[16:32] I just every time I see the video content of it, every time I see more of it on Facebook,

[16:38] I get less excited.

[16:39] It's just something about Arnold carries that movie on his shoulders, his humongous

[16:46] shoulders on his huge biceps.

[16:48] And when you remove him, I just don't think it works.

[16:52] I don't.

[16:53] And I still like that leak with him in it.

[16:57] That wasn't a leak.

[16:58] They sent it out.

[16:59] I really do think they wanted people to see the potential of what the game could be

[17:05] because they're like, oh, yeah, everyone's just going to remember the Ripley edition

[17:09] and how people waited years for that, but it eventually came.

[17:12] So if you buy this, that also might happen with our Predator game.

[17:17] I don't think it's going to happen.

[17:18] And it's such a competitive space now where if you don't have a great launch,

[17:22] I mean, it's a great launch.

[17:24] It's going to be rough unless your theme is a take my money now theme.

[17:28] Dune's getting a lot of good word of mouth, but it definitely didn't sell out.

[17:33] And they're making what, a thousand dunes and it's not a cheap property.

[17:38] And they got all those assets and they did a lot of engineering.

[17:42] It's got some mechanical magic in it.

[17:43] It's not the cheapest game to make.

[17:45] Still not sold out.

[17:47] It's going to be a long burn.

[17:48] Now, the good news is, is barrels of fun doesn't make games that quickly.

[17:53] So it's okay for them if they have, let's say, 3, 400 sold.

[17:58] It's okay because when they get those 3, 400 out, it's going to take them six months at least.

[18:04] And you know, and their hope is that more people will play it at shows.

[18:08] More people will play it at dealers and distros.

[18:10] More people will play it at a friend's house and that will lead to more sales.

[18:14] The only thing they need to do is sell everyone by the time the next game is ready

[18:19] and sell enough so that the line is moving every week.

[18:23] That's it.

[18:24] David Vaness, he once told me and I was like, come on, David, that's BS.

[18:27] He once told me, he's like, Chris, I don't want a day one sell out.

[18:30] Really, David?

[18:31] Really.

[18:32] That is BS.

[18:33] Everybody wants a day one sell out.

[18:35] I mean, it's easy to say that when you don't have a day one sell out, but who

[18:38] wouldn't want a day one sell out?

[18:40] That's a thousand nonrefundable deposits that you're getting and you're good.

[18:46] You're good.

[18:47] You've made your margin on the game.

[18:49] If people back out, you get to keep their money.

[18:51] Why wouldn't you want that?

[18:53] I think what he meant was, I don't even know what he meant.

[18:56] Maybe he doesn't want like a thousand people waiting all at once because that

[19:00] also creates a lot of anxiety for a company knowing there's customers out there

[19:05] waiting.

[19:06] But when you order a game from a company like barrels or spooky, you know what

[19:10] the typical wait time is going to be.

[19:13] The one company nobody knows what the wait time is is CGC.

[19:16] I mean, people have no idea when they're getting their Merlin's edition of

[19:20] medieval madness.

[19:21] Absolutely ridiculous.

[19:23] So I think we're going to see a pause in the summer.

[19:26] I'm still going to be doing my show two to three days a week.

[19:28] I'm going to come up with more show topics.

[19:30] Don't worry.

[19:31] I will keep you entertained.

[19:32] I want to start revisiting what I'm doing on Facebook.

[19:35] Like what are some themes that I think should be made into pinball machines

[19:40] that we haven't seen?

[19:41] And I want to also do it in a way where we're being somewhat realistic about

[19:47] what could be made.

[19:48] You can't get Tom Cruise.

[19:50] So I'm not going to say top gun.

[19:53] You're not going to get Bruce Willis with where he's at.

[19:56] His family is not going to sign off on something like this.

[19:59] So you're not going to get fifth element or die hard.

[20:02] It's just the way it is.

[20:04] But there are plenty of themes out there that are gettable that have nostalgia

[20:10] that these companies should be exploring.

[20:12] So I'm going to start incorporating that into more future shows.

[20:15] I also want to get a new MacBook Air so I can do some more interviews.

[20:19] I know you guys have been waiting on some interviews.

[20:21] It's just a lot more time to do interviews, but now might be a good time

[20:25] to incorporate more of that into the show.

[20:28] So keep a lookout for that.

[20:29] But thank you everybody for subscribing to Canada Spinball Podcast.

[20:32] We're coming back a little bit.

[20:34] We got more people joining.

[20:35] It's good.

[20:35] More people are signing up.

[20:37] We dipped a little bit.

[20:38] We're heading in the right direction though.

[20:39] We're heading in the right direction.

[20:41] I really do appreciate each and every one of you.

[20:43] And I do want to thank Apollon for raising his donation because he saw

[20:49] that some of my old friends canceled their subscriptions.

[20:52] They're back though.

[20:52] I definitely think Kale is back on.

[20:55] Ralph for some reason won't talk to me anymore.

[20:57] I don't know what happened.

[20:58] I don't know what I did.

[20:59] I don't know.

[20:59] He removed himself from we had a group chat.

[21:01] Me, Jamie and Ralph and he removed himself from the chat.

[21:05] Ralph, come on.

[21:06] We're just having fun.

[21:08] Got to learn how to take the piss out of all of this.
