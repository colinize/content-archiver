[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:25] Happy Monday after Harry Potter morning.

[00:30] How's everybody doing?

[00:32] Is everybody surviving?

[00:33] You know what I love about a new game like this?

[00:36] That everyone's been waiting for.

[00:38] It's one of the biggest themes in the history of pinball.

[00:41] Obviously, it's awakened a lot of opinions by everybody and that's a good thing.

[00:48] I love reading everybody's feedback.

[00:51] There's really good suggestions on how to make the game better.

[00:55] There's really great feedback on how the game plays and how it shoots.

[01:01] There's opinions about the art, the topper, the code, the callouts, the sound effects

[01:07] and when you hear it all and you absorb it all.

[01:12] Here's my overall feeling and I should be playing the game sometime early this week but

[01:17] here's what I can tell.

[01:19] I think what this game has done is a difficult thing because I think in this hobby we really

[01:26] always want to think in extremes.

[01:29] You have to absolutely love the game in its entirety or you need to hate the game in its

[01:36] entirety and say it's a miss.

[01:39] I think that's not how I see this game and I think when I look at Harry Potter Pinball

[01:45] and probably a lot of you feel this way.

[01:48] I think this game succeeds at doing some things really, really well and I also think this

[01:55] game has some big issues that could be issues for the duration of this game's existence.

[02:03] I think Jersey Jack as a company, overall, as a company never really has incorporated

[02:10] any of the feedback.

[02:11] People have been trying to give them game after game after game.

[02:17] The feedback they have listened to that they've implemented is stronger flippers and make

[02:23] the games actually fun to shoot.

[02:26] It's taken this company a really, really long time to make a game that's rewarding to shoot.

[02:33] They've achieved that.

[02:35] The gameplay feedback that we are getting on Harry Potter is very positive.

[02:40] I don't doubt that this game is going to be fun.

[02:43] I don't doubt that it's going to be fast.

[02:45] I don't doubt that this game is going to be satisfying when you're looking down and just

[02:51] flipping the game.

[02:52] Okay, so they got the gameplay down, right?

[02:55] I haven't heard people say it's a brick fest.

[02:57] I haven't heard people say it's sluggish.

[03:00] I think the game is going to play just fine.

[03:03] So what I want to do on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast is I want to talk about the

[03:07] dichotomy, which is Harry Potter Pinball, and how it's okay to hold in your head two opposing

[03:16] views.

[03:17] You're allowed to do that.

[03:19] You could think this game shoots amazingly well.

[03:23] You could think the artwork is incredible, but you also could think the callouts are atrocious.

[03:29] You could think the boing, boing, boing sound whenever the slingshots go off don't feel

[03:34] like Harry Potter.

[03:36] You're allowed to like this and not that.

[03:39] Because when you think about a pinball machine, it's serving up a ton of stuff at once.

[03:45] So here's the thing.

[03:46] I want to start out by saying this theme alone is a juggernaut.

[03:50] It's a juggernaut.

[03:52] This game is, for the first time ever, I've seen new people coming into Pinside because

[03:58] of the theme.

[03:59] I'm seeing people with just like two or three posts being like, I didn't even realize there

[04:05] was modern pinball.

[04:06] I saw this game and I just ordered a CE and I'm happy to be here.

[04:11] And that is the power of Harry Potter.

[04:14] It's bringing new people into pinball.

[04:17] Potter has so many fans that when they saw this game released, it awakened in them the

[04:23] desire to own a toy based on a theme they really, really love.

[04:28] So the debate about whether or not Harry Potter would be a good selling pinball machine to

[04:33] the pinball buying demographic has been erased.

[04:38] It is selling tremendously well.

[04:41] This game is not going to have a problem selling units.

[04:45] I'm almost a little bit surprised it's selling so damn well because there's no FOMO.

[04:51] I'm also a little bit worried that Jersey Jack might be so inundated with orders that

[04:58] they're going to be making this game not just this year, well into next year.

[05:03] So I don't know if we're going to see Steve Richie's pin anytime soon.

[05:07] I think we're going to see it at the end of next year because Jersey Jack doesn't have

[05:11] two lines.

[05:12] Jersey Jack has been making just one game at a time.

[05:16] Also remember Jersey Jack hasn't really had a game with that much demand since Guns and

[05:23] Roses.

[05:24] So I think this game is going to be easy to build.

[05:27] When I saw underneath the play field, it is pretty damn barren.

[05:31] I know guys you don't play underneath the play field, but they definitely made this

[05:36] game a lot simpler to manufacture and they had to.

[05:41] If this game was loaded, which it's not, can we just stop the debate?

[05:44] This game is not loaded.

[05:46] If it was loaded like Hobbit, if it was loaded like Pirates, it would be a nightmare trying

[05:52] to make those games and get them out to people.

[05:55] They're never going to make another game like that, but let's just stop being stupid.

[06:00] It's got one diverter and then a drop target and nothing really else going on mechanically

[06:06] and no complex toys in the game.

[06:08] So you know what's funny?

[06:09] I saw someone say the whole damn game is a toy.

[06:12] So now we're there.

[06:14] Panzer Freak said the upper play field is a toy.

[06:17] I don't care anymore.

[06:19] These have become such a name arguments.

[06:22] It doesn't even matter.

[06:24] It's not loaded.

[06:26] Okay, let's just move on to the next topic.

[06:28] So this theme brought so many people into pinball.

[06:32] It created so many week one sales for a game that has no FOMO.

[06:38] There's no limit.

[06:39] You still don't know how many CEs they're going to make.

[06:42] I saw a lot of people are ordering the CEs and that brings me to my second point.

[06:48] Next to the theme being so powerful, the smartest move they did around this game was the uniqueness

[06:56] in the collector's edition artwork.

[06:59] I think Stern Pinball needs to wake up and look at what Jersey Jack just did.

[07:04] They made the top of the line version of the game look so radically different from the

[07:12] other versions of the game and that is what people want.

[07:17] Not just that.

[07:18] They found a different artist that had a unique story.

[07:21] When you hear the story about why the collector's edition looks the way it does, it makes you

[07:28] want one.

[07:29] It gives you a feeling of having something special.

[07:32] And again, the games don't look like matching luggage.

[07:36] Go look at King Kong.

[07:38] What a joke.

[07:39] There's no story there around the L.E. artwork.

[07:42] And for the longest time, Stern Pinball hasn't really made its L.E. art cabinets nice enough.

[07:49] And they need to take notice here because I'm seeing people write checks left and right

[07:54] for a $15,000 version of Harry Potter simply because of the artwork.

[07:59] The artwork is the number one reason everyone's going in on the C.E.

[08:04] It is not the topper because everybody knows the topper is atrocious.

[08:10] And even with this atrocious topper, everyone still is feeling like if I'm going to get

[08:16] Harry Potter.

[08:17] I want that special art package and it does look stunning and I love it and I'm glad they

[08:23] did it.

[08:24] And I think it's a wake up call to everybody else.

[08:27] If you want to make a top of the line version of the game, it can't look anything like the

[08:32] next lower tiers of the game.

[08:35] Stern, you better be paying attention to this.

[08:37] Okay, so that art is moving units.

[08:40] So we got beautiful artwork.

[08:42] I think the artwork looks good on all the additions, but that C.E. is special.

[08:47] We've got Harry Potter theme.

[08:50] We've got the theme song from John Williams.

[08:52] They can't play it in the clips on the internet because it'll flag it as copyright.

[08:57] That's why you're not seeing it.

[08:59] And so the gameplay is fast.

[09:01] Okay, so there's so much right there to like about Harry Potter Pimbal.

[09:06] But then there's the stuff that isn't really working for people.

[09:10] It's pretty cringe and on the surface level, it seems to be things they could fix, but

[09:16] historically they won't.

[09:18] So I just want to tell you this right now.

[09:20] Historically speaking, whatever you see now is what you're going to get in Harry Potter.

[09:25] I get it is 0.70.

[09:28] But this company is not going to go do what I think some people think they're going to

[09:33] do because they're going to be doing it.

[09:35] So this company is not going to go do what I think some people think they're going to

[09:40] do because they are so far down the road on how they decided to theme translate this game.

[09:47] And I'm just here to tell you right now what this game misses the mark on.

[09:51] And Eric said it in an interview and I can't believe he went down this road.

[09:56] He said, instead of focusing on the story, I wanted to focus on the lore of Harry Potter.

[10:04] The reason why Harry Potter has millions, if not a billion fans around the world is

[10:12] because of the story.

[10:14] It's what this whole franchise is about.

[10:17] What do you think those books were about?

[10:19] It's the story of Harry and his friends defeating Voldemort and that journey from being a little

[10:27] boy discovering his origin, finding his powers and then defeating the evil.

[10:32] That story is not coming through in this game at all.

[10:37] The story of the movies is never going to come at you.

[10:41] It's done so differently.

[10:43] It's like all these 96 little modes where you're just shooting the same stuff over and over again.

[10:50] And you don't even really hear from Harry gang.

[10:52] And I mean this, like how does anybody who loves the story of Harry Potter look at this

[11:00] gameplay and feel connected to the major moments in the movie?

[11:05] It's not happening.

[11:07] The reason Lord of the Rings is such a pinball masterpiece is it took the major moments from

[11:15] those three movies and that's what you play.

[11:19] The physical mechanisms in the game connect to those moments in the movie.

[11:24] The callouts between the characters all happening from the movie.

[11:29] And when you start a mode, you feel like you're progressing through that mode with those

[11:35] characters and the sense of urgency and the sense of excitement that that game telegraphs to you

[11:41] as a player is phenomenal.

[11:44] And then you go look at the Harry Potter stream and again, if you close your eyes, you don't

[11:49] feel like you're going through anything.

[11:50] It still sounds like a slot machine and all the noises and the sound effects.

[11:56] You hear so much more from Mark Silk than you do from the actors in the film.

[12:03] And that is not going to change.

[12:06] Okay, so there you have it, everybody.

[12:08] That's the dichotomy of Harry Potter pinball.

[12:12] You're going to get a lot of the stuff I said at the beginning.

[12:15] They did so damn well.

[12:17] But the stuff that they got wrong, I think they missed the mark by so much that it's almost comical.

[12:25] It's hard to talk to the fanboys about it because a lot of them are the pinball fanboys.

[12:30] So they're just happy that the game shoots well and then they walk up to the machine and you

[12:35] know, Jersey Jack machines always do this because they're beautiful.

[12:39] When you walk up to them for the first time, they're stunning and you want to love them

[12:44] and you want to connect with them and you want it to click with you.

[12:47] It's like it's like sitting in front of a beautiful woman.

[12:50] Have you ever sat at a table with a beautiful woman?

[12:53] No matter what she's saying, you're going to nod and smile.

[12:56] I mean, that's just how it goes.

[12:58] And that's what jumping on a Jersey Jack machine is for the first time.

[13:03] But over time, if you're a Potter fanatic, will this 96 mini mode world really be exciting to you?

[13:15] You know, I had a friend say to me yesterday, he's like, a pinball machine is a three to five minute

[13:20] experience, maybe five to 10 at most.

[13:23] Why are they putting 96 modes into a game?

[13:28] And it just starts to feel again, like they don't truly understand.

[13:33] They still don't get it Jersey Jack.

[13:35] Always too much of what you don't want and not enough of what you want.

[13:41] There are some clips that are synced up, but most aren't.

[13:45] And it's there.

[13:46] And you could tell it like, I think they have permission to use it.

[13:50] And that's the part that's killing everybody.

[13:53] That's a fan of the property is because you can kind of hear it in the background,

[13:57] but they're burying it underneath Mark Silk, underneath these slot machine sounds,

[14:03] underneath their original orchestration.

[14:06] We all were so excited that David Thiel is on board for this game.

[14:12] And I've seen nothing but complaining about the way the game sounds.

[14:17] And so even Thiel couldn't save what Jersey Jack's new sound approach is,

[14:23] which makes every game lately sound like a slot machine.

[14:27] And look, that criticism is accurate.

[14:29] I don't care what anybody says.

[14:31] Close your eyes.

[14:32] Listen to this thing.

[14:33] Close your eyes and listen to a spooky game.

[14:36] Listen to a stern game.

[14:38] Listen to barrels of fun.

[14:39] Listen to everybody else's machines.

[14:41] They don't sound like this.

[14:43] It just feels like it belongs in a casino or in a Daven Busters.

[14:47] But again, we've been giving Jersey Jack this feedback gang for four years now,

[14:51] for four years, and they haven't changed it once.

[14:54] So they're just doing what they do.

[14:56] And if you like it, you like it.

[14:58] What you see is what you get.

[15:00] That's been Jersey Jack's response to all the feedback we've been giving them.

[15:05] All right.

[15:05] So that's Harry Potter Pimbal.

[15:07] I look forward to playing it.

[15:09] It's not a game I'm going to buy.

[15:10] I think they're going to make so many of them.

[15:12] They're going to be everywhere.

[15:14] They also have some new innovation for operators called like Game Changer or

[15:19] something where you can hold up a QR code and it could change the difficulty of

[15:25] the game on location from easy to normal to hard.

[15:30] I'm not sure why an operator would even want or need that.

[15:35] Operators want to make money.

[15:37] They want to set the game on hard.

[15:39] You think an operator is like, you know, I really just want people to go deep into

[15:43] the 96 modes of this game.

[15:45] Guys, come on.

[15:46] Like I feel like Jersey Jack as a company lately is like creating solutions that

[15:53] are in search of a problem.

[15:55] If you're on location, every game should be set up the same way for everybody.

[15:59] There should be one grand champion.

[16:01] I'm sorry.

[16:02] Like just play better.

[16:04] Okay.

[16:04] So here's the other thing I'm hearing.

[16:07] It is Monday, June 9th, and I think we're going to get predator news today.

[16:12] I think we're going to start to see some predator news because I think

[16:15] predator is going to be out June 12th, which is the anniversary of the movie

[16:19] coming out.

[16:20] So if you weren't impressed by Harry Potter without much Harry Potter speak,

[16:25] I think get ready for predator wide body from the pinball brothers with

[16:30] possibly no Arnold.

[16:33] I was watching the new predator animated movie on Disney plus.

[16:36] It's insane.

[16:37] So cool.

[16:39] But if you're going to bring out predator, I don't know.

[16:42] They've been teasing it with the red polo shirt.

[16:45] So if Arnold's not in it and they tease this game with that shirt, I think

[16:52] they're going to get a lot of backlash.

[16:54] But you know, I've been asking Genghis is Arnold in it.

[16:57] He won't tell me.

[16:59] I think the silence is speaking volumes that he's not in it.

[17:02] If he was in it, they would just be on loop playing his sound clip.

[17:07] Get to the chopper.

[17:09] Like seriously, that would be all you would have to do to tease this game.

[17:12] I also think everyone's over this like drawn out a few weeks of teasers.

[17:18] Like it just doesn't work.

[17:19] It only works if you give people the release date and they know when they

[17:25] can really start paying attention.

[17:27] We got the Harry Potter countdown.

[17:29] I think that was nice.

[17:31] And if this predator game is coming out June 12th, you know, come on, guys,

[17:35] like let people know.

[17:36] Like this is so stupid.

[17:38] This world of like, we're going to keep everything a secret and expect you to

[17:42] just like wait and stick around for a stick around.

[17:45] Right.

[17:45] See what I just did there?

[17:46] The problem is Harry Potter just gobbled up all the money people have right now

[17:52] and enthusiasm people have right now for a new pinball machine.

[17:55] So, you know, I would not in a million years launch my pinball machine the week

[18:01] after the second biggest IP launch in the history of all the pinball.

[18:05] It just goes to show you these guys don't know what they're doing.

[18:09] So that's going to happen.

[18:11] And then I'm like, gang, I'm here to tell you right now.

[18:13] John Borg's game is Star Wars Episode one through three.

[18:18] Get ready for Darth Maul, Kona Mata, like it's coming.

[18:22] Like I'm excited.

[18:24] Stern needs a hit, everybody.

[18:26] King Kong did not sell.

[18:28] And now with all this money going to Potter, I think it's going to be a rough,

[18:33] rough few months for Stern.

[18:34] And the big question mark for this month is I think it's June 20th.

[18:39] Are we going to see a 50th anniversary of Jaws?

[18:43] And the rumor is they might actually make only 750 Jaws, 50th anniversary games.

[18:49] I don't think that's going to happen.

[18:50] They said they're never going to make another LE.

[18:53] But this is it.

[18:54] Like Stern's got to figure something out.

[18:57] They let too many of the competitors eat away at the market share.

[19:02] They've had too many mediocre themes in a row.

[19:06] Like how did Stern not get Harry Potter?

[19:09] Right. Great get by Jack, by the way.

[19:11] I mean, OMG, they're going to sell 8000 Harry Potter.

[19:15] They ain't going to sell 8000 King Kongs.

[19:17] This game is going to sell more than Venom, John Wick, X-Men,

[19:23] food fighters, all combined, like all combined.

[19:26] They're going to be selling Harry Potter pinball machines for the next five years.

[19:32] That is unless people do get this game and get a little tired of the 96

[19:38] modes over and over and over again and no real moments of magic.

[19:41] We'll see what happens.

[19:42] It's in their court, but I'm a little worried.

[19:44] I'm a little worried.

[19:45] You know how I feel fools rush in and I just think rushing in before you get to

[19:49] play it is difficult because the people playing it right now.

[19:52] Remember, there's a honeymoon phase and look, is gameplay all you need to buy one?

[19:57] I think for a lot of people, yeah, right?

[20:00] It's like everybody wants a beautiful Jersey Jack game in their lineup.

[20:04] You don't necessarily want the Elton John.

[20:06] I don't think this game shoots better than Elton John.

[20:09] They both shoot differently.

[20:11] But I think that's why this game is going to do well, because it's just going

[20:14] to be satisfying to shoot.

[20:16] Everybody bought guns and roses and then they realized the gameplay was the reason

[20:21] why you had to get rid of it.

[20:23] So it's going to do phenomenally well for Jersey Jack pinball and Stern needs a hit.

[20:29] Barrels of fun needs to figure out what to do now.

[20:32] How do you get people reignited around Dune?

[20:35] How do you get people to buy predator if your pinball brothers and Arnold isn't in it?

[20:41] The world's going through some crazy stuff right now.

[20:43] A lot of people are anxious.

[20:45] A lot of people are stressed out.

[20:47] I think a lot of people just want magic and we need better themes.

[20:50] Harry Potter should sell a ton because the theme is great.

[20:54] There's no room in pinball anymore for mediocrity when it comes to theme selection

[20:59] and Stern does need to wake up.

[21:01] So that's why I think we're going to see Star Wars and I think we're going to see

[21:05] Pokemon one, two punch and those are big punches.

[21:08] And if the rumors true, that Keith Elwin is a big Pokemon fan.

[21:13] And he's working on the Pokemon pinball machine that much like Harry Potter will

[21:19] bring new people into pinball.

[21:21] And Pokemon is a much bigger property than even Harry Potter.

[21:25] And I actually think it's easier to translate Pokemon into pinball.

[21:30] Really difficult to take eight movies and put it all into one pin.

[21:35] And will it work out?

[21:36] We shall see.

[21:37] But everybody look, I think it's a buyer's market.

[21:41] There's no need to rush.

[21:43] Right.

[21:43] Everyone's either in a rush to glorify the game or overly indicted.

[21:48] I think I've been very fair and balanced on my feelings on Harry Potter.

[21:53] The problem is a lot of these people on pin side and Facebook, they're not

[21:58] subscribers, so they're not listening to the full story of how I feel about this

[22:03] game. I have not unfairly indicted this game.

[22:07] There's stuff I really, really like and there's stuff that's really, really

[22:11] cringe. And so I just want to go play it.

[22:14] I want to go play it.

[22:15] And that's what I'm going to go do this week.

[22:17] And even if I play it and I enjoy it, I still wouldn't feel like I would

[22:21] order one right away.

[22:24] The codes got at least a year to go.

[22:26] You know this.

[22:28] They're going to make this game for a long time.

[22:31] And you all know, and we haven't talked about it.

[22:34] None of these models are holding value.

[22:36] None.

[22:38] So just let them make them all.

[22:40] And then you can march in.

[22:41] These CEs are going to go down because they're going to have so many of them

[22:45] out there.

[22:46] I don't think everyone's going to bolt this game to the ground like they say.

[22:49] Again, I think it's a really good effort.

[22:51] I would give it like a B overall.

[22:53] I just don't think they nailed the theme.

[22:55] I don't.

[22:56] I really don't.

[22:57] And that's just what I would do.

[22:58] And that's just historically looking at how it goes.

[23:01] That's how it's going to go.

[23:03] Unlimited runs of every model.

[23:06] Oh, yeah. Let me order now.

[23:07] Why?

[23:08] Why?

[23:09] Why?

[23:10] When you haven't even played it yet.

[23:11] Okay.

[23:12] Everybody look happy Monday.

[23:14] More to come on this.

[23:15] I might have to do another show today if we see Predator, but I don't think we're

[23:18] going to see it to the 12th.

[23:19] It's going to be like Predator Day.

[23:21] So I think that's coming.

[23:23] So get ready.

[23:24] Another new pinball machine.

[23:25] Right.

[23:26] Do you guys all work in finance?

[23:27] Like how does everybody have this much money to absorb all these games?

[23:31] Everybody can eat it out later.
