[00:00] Check it out. I am the ultimate bad ass.

[00:04] Stayed as a bad ass or you do not want to fuck with me.

[00:16] We had to pay a little bit of homage to Bill Paxton. His untimely passing at 61 was really such a tragic event.

[00:25] A lot of people all over the world remembered him from many of the different movie roles that we enjoyed.

[00:33] But maybe no role greater than his role in aliens that just provided so many memorable lines. He is just so good in that movie.

[00:44] I remember watching so many of you have Bill Paxton who is growing up.

[00:48] Even loved Edged Amaro with Tom Cruise and Bill Paxton was in that as well.

[00:54] But I am happy to be changing gears. I want to talk about Alien Pimball.

[00:58] The fact that Alien Pimball has somewhat arrived. It is out there. It is being played. It is on location.

[01:05] It is a big day to finally see what is in the game. I want to talk about that.

[01:13] I just want to change gears too.

[01:17] A lot of us have been so hyper focused on magic girl and what has been going on in that thread.

[01:23] All the different characters, assassination stuff and battling back and forth.

[01:27] People threatening people with lawsuits and this and that.

[01:31] I think that thread is run its course. I don't think there is going to be much magic girl news for a while.

[01:38] I think the game is going to end up in collector hands. Some might sell for a lot of money.

[01:44] But the game itself there is not much to talk about.

[01:47] Let's talk about a game that actually is a game that you can play. That has stuff in it that works.

[01:55] That is going to provide a lot of Pimball fun. That is Alien Pimball.

[02:02] I just spent the last 10 or so minutes watching from beginning to end Andrew Highways recent gameplay video.

[02:12] This has been a video that people have been waiting for a long time.

[02:16] I just want to come out and say that I was really impressed by what I saw.

[02:22] I thought the game looked pretty fucking cool. I'm going to curse.

[02:29] I think the game has one of the greatest light shows I've seen in any modern Pimball game.

[02:37] I think all you need is the screen on the play field.

[02:44] I don't know if you even need the big screen on the back box because you kind of get it all.

[02:50] With just that overhead view, just looking down, you don't even have to look up to understand what you're doing, what the modes are.

[02:57] It's all right there for you on the play field.

[03:00] I don't remember each of the different modes that I saw.

[03:04] There's one really cool one where you're, I think it's cargo drop where you're loading the different soldiers onto the plane.

[03:11] Then you're going to drop them.

[03:14] I just say it's just really cool the way the lights go from being all green to all red in an instant.

[03:23] I just think that and then they block out and there's just sort of like the sound connected with the lights are really amazing.

[03:34] I really think that the music and the call outs and the light show from what I've seen so far is incredible.

[03:44] The shots look like there's great flow and it looks like there's a lot of stuff to combo.

[03:50] I love the fact that there's an upper flipper that actually has an upper flipper shot.

[03:56] Remember all the controversy around the hobbit when we have the upper flipper that didn't really shoot anything?

[04:02] This shot is perfect for that ramp that's on the left side.

[04:09] Lots of cool stuff going on in the game.

[04:13] I think if you see this video I recommend everyone go look at it.

[04:18] I think people are going to walk away and feel confident in the alien pinball machine they're going to get.

[04:25] I don't think there's any reason for concern or anything in the video that should make anyone who's in an alien be anxious.

[04:33] I also think people will see this video and want to go in on an alien.

[04:37] I think it's always exciting to see a pinball machine that has a lot going on in it.

[04:45] I haven't flipped it yet so I can't get my personal opinions.

[04:49] I know that Hilton got his in Madison, Wisconsin and that's about to go on location.

[04:55] There's going to be more videos and pictures coming from him soon.

[04:59] But it's out there.

[05:00] I don't know how many have gone out yet but alien pinball is out in the world.

[05:08] I think that's always a moment for those of us on this show.

[05:12] We've had our beef with highway and this and that and there are still things I would have done differently.

[05:20] Had any creative control over the product.

[05:23] But all that's bygones at this point.

[05:27] I always said to Andrew highway, just ship your machine and all this goes away and it's true.

[05:32] The second you can just get your product out there, all the speculation ends, all the bickering stops.

[05:39] The product itself then becomes what people talk about and a product will survive or fail based on its own merits.

[05:47] I think this is a good indication that alien pinball is going to be immersive.

[05:54] It will connect people to the alien world.

[05:58] I definitely saw a lot of that.

[06:00] Yes, of course everybody would want Sigourney Weaver in the game.

[06:04] I want to also do a little correction and I think I misspoke when I said stern have locked down Sigourney Weaver or sort of like blocked highway.

[06:14] I got a lot of feedback from people saying that wasn't the case and it sounds like it was just a case of she's too expensive.

[06:21] Again, no one knows the exact conversations that highway had with Sigourney Weaver people or Roger Sharp had with the people.

[06:31] Let's just put that to bed, Russ.

[06:35] I don't think it's fair for me to say stern did this to block highway.

[06:39] That was wrong so I apologize for saying that.

[06:44] I guess the next question is this.

[06:46] This is sort of what some people have been asking but when now will people get their games?

[06:52] I've been told by someone close to the project or someone who's been in constant contact with highway that by end of March LE's should be going out.

[07:04] Now I hope so. I hope so. Again, because I think the real hurdle now is getting these games made.

[07:12] It is one thing to make five games. It's another to make 50. It's a whole another thing to make 500.

[07:18] So I definitely think that the excitement to get one will be there.

[07:24] I think it's now just a question of manufacturing and can highway get these games on the line and get them out to people?

[07:32] I think there's going to be a lot of interest in it. I really do.

[07:36] I personally am not going to get an alien again because I just don't have room.

[07:44] There's one sci-fi game that I'm waiting for in that Star Wars.

[07:48] But I do see a lot that people will like.

[07:52] I think it's going to be a really interesting next few months because I think if the games can go out and they can go out in volume,

[08:02] then I think a lot of orders are going to flood in.

[08:04] But I think if they're slow to get games out, I think people are still going to be hesitant to pay now and to give money now.

[08:13] I think it's just going to be, look, and I think the little Bowsky situation has made everybody fearful.

[08:19] And I think it's just a climate. It's just a climate of where people are at right now when it comes to the world of pinball.

[08:28] So good news for alien people. Lots to be excited about with alien right now.

[08:34] And those threads are going to keep blowing up. And I'll say this too.

[08:37] I was happy to see the thread. I just like seeing these threads where it's like, here's a new pinball machine out in the world.

[08:43] There is nothing exciting to be found anymore in the J-pop magic girl thread.

[08:50] Again, I think that thread is sucking the life out of pinball.

[08:54] And I think it's perfect timing for alien to be out there to breathe new life just into the hobby.

[09:02] People, we should be looking at new games. We shouldn't be just fighting each other and arguing about legal things and arguing about being insensitive to each other.

[09:13] I hate the fact that all of, or not all of, but some of these threads have sort of derailed into stuff that just has nothing to do with pinball whatsoever.

[09:25] What else do I want to talk about on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast?

[09:29] So I saw an interesting thread a few days ago about a sort of a gentleman who was having a dilemma about whether or not he should open up a Tron Ellie new in box.

[09:41] He had just purchased it. I want to pull up my show notes. And he was just asking, like, should I open it?

[09:50] And it was kind of like a, it was a little like weird. It's like, well, why did you get it if you're not going to open it?

[09:56] It was by user TexasFF78. And he literally, like, just was asking, like, do I open this?

[10:05] And what would be the point of buying a pinball machine and not opening it?

[10:11] What would be the point of keeping something that you want it in a box?

[10:17] And this isn't like transformer collecting, like, which I do some of, because at least you can see the toy, at least the box is colorful and a worker art.

[10:28] Pinball just comes in a big brown box. And I really do think that if you buy a game new in box and then you open it,

[10:40] especially with games like Tron, you just lose like a fortune the moment you pop the lid on the box.

[10:48] We all saw that on eBay. There was that Big Bang bar that's in a box for $25,000. And then moment like you pop that box open, you're losing like nine grand.

[11:00] But what was great about this is so he puts it out there and ultimately he decides to open it, which I think is good.

[11:08] So TexasFF78, we congratulate you on doing the right thing and opening it up.

[11:15] You know, there's been a lot of talk about like taking magic rolls out of the box and how people won't take magic rolls out of the box and they're just going to keep trading them.

[11:23] Like the only exciting thing about magic girl is the art. Having one in a box, I get it. People look at it like it's an investment and they're just, it's worth more if it's not opened.

[11:34] But I really, you know, I don't even know like is my magic girl worth less now that I've opened it, inspected it, and set it up.

[11:45] And now you know exactly what you're getting versus one that's in a box. Now look, it's brand new. So no one's like worried about like battery damage or other things.

[11:55] But like I think it's just, I just can't ever get into the mindset of like someone who would have like a storage locker full of games still in boxes waiting for the price to get to the right level before they'll ship the game on.

[12:10] But people do it. So I'm happy that that game was opened. Let's talk, you know, imagine all the people who still have like Avengers in new inbox and kiss all these.

[12:22] I love seeing all the kiss all these new inboxes. People who speculate on that, they just got hit hard. I heard, and this is just a rumor, but I heard that there's going to be an Adam's family, new inbox never open that goes up for sale soon.

[12:39] That's what I heard. Now I don't know, I don't know like where it's going to go up for sale, but oftentimes these things, they never go up for sale on like eBay.

[12:52] You know, a lot of times these things will just trade hands amongst high end collectors. So it's going to be interesting to see if that ever pops up. But I heard through the grape plan that there is still an Adam's family out there new in box.

[13:04] I wonder how many there are out in the world considering they made something like 20,000 Adam's family pinball machines. I'm sure there's a few that are still in a box never opened.

[13:17] What else is going on in the hobby? And again, this is again news news news today. So did you guys see there's new dialed in videos?

[13:27] You know, as we have alien videos in one corner, we have dialed in videos in another corner. Jack also sent out an email. He sent out an email explaining a little bit of the backstory of dialed in how they sort of got Pat to come out of retirement and work on dialed in.

[13:46] And there's just some silly little like $250 refundable deposit. I don't even understand. I don't even sometimes, oh my god, look at some of these deposits. Like really? Like, do these even make sense? I don't get why you even need such a little deposit. But I'll say this. The dialed in game is looking phenomenal.

[14:06] Like the game, the more I see it, the more it wins me over. And I think we have really exciting stuff coming out between dialed in an alien and aerospace myth.

[14:19] I think I think dialed in is going to be successful. I really do. And I think the game is worth the money every time I see it.

[14:28] There's so much going on inside the game. The LCD looks awesome. I think they've toned down like the ringing of the cell phone. So the only issue that I think that people are concerned about right now is the magnet by where the drones are.

[14:44] It doesn't, it just seems to be wearing that area down really heavily. And I think they put mylar on it. But I still think the mylar is also like wearing through now. So that's why you put games on location, right? You put games on location to see how they hold up, how they flip.

[15:03] Did you guys see the funny speaking of like putting stuff on location to see if the game actually plays. There is one thing that really indicates or summarizes John Papadu can in that show.

[15:17] There is a target that's underneath the left ramp in magic girl that just can't be hit. There's no way for a ball to hit it. There's no way for a ball to get to it.

[15:29] And that just goes to show it's like a game that was never flipped a game that was never really played a game that was never put on location things were things were just dropped in without any real rhyme or reason.

[15:42] So I'm happy to see to we heard from Jack that Pat Lawler has been visiting dialed in on location and is making tweaks like that's how that's how it should be. It should not be like the first people that buy the game are also the beta testers.

[15:59] And I think a lot of people wish that Stern would do a little bit more of that as well. I think with with Ghostbusters and some other titles, it just seems like games were never really put on location.

[16:13] And the guys who are buying the L.E.s are spending the most money on these games and if they get games with issues, whether it's clear code issues or toy issues or things falling off or things not working right.

[16:28] You know, putting a game on location would help solve all that. I don't think anyone would ever ever problem with with with the game being on location for a couple months before consumer products start shipping.

[16:40] You know, it's the proper testing that is I think all games should go through. All right, let's see. I also got a note from Jerry from P3. I don't know if you guys are on his email newsletter, but he talks about how their production is beginning.

[16:55] He shared some great photos of a lot of products and pieces arriving to get P3s out the door. And I believe he's doing it. I think sorry, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I think there's 25 initial games going out with with and then round two will have like another sort of 20 to 25 games going out as well.

[17:17] So we are happy to see P3 go out the door. You know, also, like it's like, you know, when I think it is this time of year. And this is why I knew that like coming out of expo, it just felt like nothing was really going to materialize and then, you know, before the year was over and I was right.

[17:34] Because I really think the show that is the most important one is the Texas pinball festival. And for those of you who haven't been to the Texas pinball festival, it is I think by far the best pinball show in the country.

[17:48] And I think it's also now become the show where you better have your shit together by the time T. P. F. rolls around because you don't want to go into T. P. F. with with lingering issues. You don't you it's because there's you're in front of most consumers at T. P. F. There's more people that attend that show than way more than expo. Right. So and I think a lot of people are starting to realize that this is the moment.

[18:16] These show to announce stuff to have stuff ready to bring pinball machines in box for people to take home with them. And to get the conversation going. I think T. P. F. has really become that show and I and I think if there's one guy who's not looking forward to it to start friend over a Dutch pinball.

[18:34] I don't know what they're going to say. Are they going to come and just say that they still haven't figured it out or are they going to come say problem solved. You know I I wouldn't want to show my face unless Dutch is going to tell people they've they've figured it out and they know exactly when games are going to ship.

[18:52] I mean I think it's exciting for for Jerry to be talking about the pathway to production for P. 3. And and now when he shows the game at.

[19:02] T. P. F. finally people can order them right and I know they always could order them but it was always just a question mark about when they were actually going to start making the game.

[19:11] And production is everything I think people have reached the point where no one cares about your intentions anymore. Nobody really cares about your promises.

[19:20] They want to see games being made sort of been like a weird kind of miracle mythological year in the sense that like magic girl came out right that.

[19:32] So it's sort of like started the trend of anything is possible now yes I magical still doesn't work so it's not really a game but it's it's it's physically out there right it's things we have been waiting for are now materializing and things are materializing on top of each other so it's it's it's an exciting time to see where all this stuff nets out somewhere in all of this I don't know about you guys but somewhere in all of this.

[20:01] I think like everyone's just like forgotten about aro Smith right I just there's absolutely no no conversation happening around aro Smith pimp on a thing stern kind of you know like they announced it but it wasn't shipping and now that it is I don't know there's just so much other stuff happening that is more interesting and exciting to talk about then aro Smith.

[20:26] I think the next turn title is going to be the one that that really is is is a huge hit in the home run.

[20:36] Let's see what else so my god I want to I was going to talk about see I was going to talk about alien in the outland drains but I didn't see the outland draining to be too bad in the video I saw today.

[20:51] So I'm sort of just going off of that what else is going on in the pinball world I'm trying to stay clear of the manager girl stuff for now I'm just looking down the list of different threads.

[21:05] You know it's it's there's not too much else going going on I'm going into the big Lebowski I want to see if there's any any there's any update 71 pages in the big Lebowski thread.

[21:20] And it doesn't look like there is any update whatsoever what a shit show this continues to be was written 13 hours ago by user cabbie so I'll take him for his word on that one.

[21:38] And you know we'll see what happens I think I think that's a lot of explaining to do a lot of explaining that have not handled this in the best possible way so let's think about 2017 and what this means so alien can get out the door and we start to see game shipping in March aren't we supposed to see dialed in in in April I believe so.

[22:05] So that's just it's just interesting to see if all these things start to happen at the same time who's going to win and who's going to lose is the room for all of this stuff to be going out at the same time I don't know I hope everything goes according to plan for all these guys I hope highway doesn't run into any more hiccups I hope p3 goes out without a hitch who knows what's going on with home pin right our friends over there in China.

[22:34] What is going on when when will home pin surface and will they be able to come at at the competition with a pin that's four or five thousand dollars or will will they be able to do it it's going to be a really interesting year I still I still stand behind my belief as much as I want to stay as positive as possible that not all these guys are going to make it I really don't think it's going to happen.

[23:04] We know spooky is going to show their next title tpf and and we know that they can start making those games quickly so it's going to be interesting when you have four to five manufacturers all trying to sell people new in box machines there's no way the money is going to go to each of them right someone's going to have a hard time gaining traction.

[23:28] Look the bars keep getting razor which is good I think the alien video with that you know that light show and what's going on if Andrew can figure out his production problems then I think he can be a competitor but I don't think they're out of the woods by any means like I don't see a few early games equaling everything's fine now everything you know as again and we see that we can see the same thing.

[23:58] I saw with like Jersey Jack that you can be sending out hundreds of games and you still could be in financial trouble so it's it's really hard I would say this if I would get my alien pinball machine as fast as I could I think I would I have the same advice for everyone when it comes to your money down with like one of these boutiques is just get your game as fast as you can possibly get it once you have it no one can take it from you.

[24:28] The same is true with these magical guys they don't have to worry about the games being repossessed but you know it's it's just you know people are just not going to want to wait and wait and wait and the money is going to go towards the companies that can get people games quickly.

[24:47] How long is it going to take to make dialed in when will dialed in production begin how many were pre ordered will will Jack avoid what happened last time where people who pre ordered hobbit we're getting cut in line simply because distributors just ordered a bunch more games and they even got orders and they were you know they as people are waiting for their specific game to be built.

[25:14] Distributors would just sell new new buyers games immediately so I guess I just I don't know I've just never seen the reason why anyone would like going early on a lot of stuff there's there's no advantage to it unless you think you're going to get locked out of getting an alley but even then we've seen that every alley comes up for sale even the Batman alleys were for sale for pretty much what people paid.

[25:38] So you know it's going to be an interesting next few weeks heading into tpf I do love that tpf does create this sense of urgency and makes people act it makes people put out bold statements and it makes people accountable right these shows do make people accountable because when you're out of show you have to face people face to face you can't hide behind messages anymore you can't hide behind the forums you actually the talk to your customers face to face and no one wants to.

[26:08] So I'm going to go there and have any confrontation nobody alright what else is going on attack for Mars remake who is in someone is asking that question and it looks like there's a poll attached to this one so 16% of people said they're in 67% of people said they're not in and 17% of people said they're on the fence so majority of you are not excited about attack for Mars remake.

[26:38] I'll probably you know plus or minus 15% of those those knows are just people trolling and just answering the most negative way possible.

[26:49] Levy wrote no but I'm 100% in on any and all attack for Mars remake drama threads that was funny.

[26:58] I don't think attack for Mars remake is is going to set the world on fire I think that's another game they're going to show a tpf but in this climate of new stuff of dialed in of alien of you know possible home pin who deenies going to be showed at tpf you know spookies new game who cares about looking back who really cares about looking back we are at such a state now of being able to look forward and be able to look forward to the game.

[27:27] I'm not going to be able to look forward and be excited about what the future holds that I just don't think pps is approaches is going to really be that effective moving forward I really don't unless they remake kingpin or remake some of these like heyday titles that never really saw much volume.

[27:45] They're not going to get the orders flowing with games like just attack for Mars I really don't I mean look I'd rather have an alien attack for Mars just because it's new I can go play attack for Mars on location if I was a home buyer who wanted a new experience I just I wouldn't really look towards the past.

[28:05] Alright anything else going on that I'm just like missing like something interesting I'm trying to think if I could search for I wish you could search for just like.

[28:16] I mean I guess you can see that like which threads are on fire you can't really like just search for the fire only threads I don't really think you can.

[28:25] Any more Nemo's to do have they shipped have you guys like seen any more news and like the Nemo's I think there's only been like three or four that have gone out it's going to be interesting to see more on that game I think that game is beautiful and I would love to see more get revealed on that game as well.

[28:47] Alright what's going on the ghost busters Ellie that guy who's restoring his own play field let's check in on this thread and see where this guy's at now for those of you who didn't hear this guy had some issues with his ghost busters.

[29:01] Ellie and in turn like I think sent them a little bit of clear code and some sandpaper as the ultimate f you and he is tearing it down and redoing the clear on his ghost busters I can't believe he's doing that but he is I looks like in this thread now we are we are seeing that there are.

[29:24] Insert issues there's a someone's pointing out there's a ghosted insert a small little ghosting on one of the inserts on aero smith so can we can we just put to bed once and for all this whole like there can't be any ghosting on any inserts anywhere on a pinball machine or that means.

[29:46] Catastrophe is going to happen to that play field that clears just going to chip there's a little ghosting on my magic girl and I know magic girl is not the benchmark for for quality craftsmanship I these are very like limited handmade things but there's ghosting on my inserts on my CPR gold and I know those are extremely high quality play fields I cost upwards of a thousand dollars so.

[30:16] Okay so looks like this guy strip down his ghost busters Ellie play field and it's it's at the clear code facility and he's guessing it'll take six to eight weeks before it returns.

[30:29] So interesting interesting because what what's what I'm curious about here.

[30:35] Is will this clear coat facility that's doing it will they be able to do a better job than what stern has done and I think a lot of what we we talk about when it comes to these these play fields is there's just a certain level of expertise that a company needs to have in order to know how to.

[30:57] Clear a pinball machine properly and if you just send it off to someone are you going to get it back in in the right way and I think there's a lot of just institutional knowledge that if the places and doesn't get pinball they might not know like what the best way to do it like how much is too much clear code and this and that and I don't know I don't know we'll see what he comes back with the.

[31:26] He comes back with on that but it's definitely an interesting thread and I give the guy credit for doing what he's doing not in a million years would I would I ever do it alright so is there anything going on with Kevin cool it lately again this is just like can you to go down the news items i think the last thing was we were getting like Friday court updates but I don't.

[31:55] I don't know if there's like a if there's been like another audio recording but there seems to be a nice thank you flinny bus because I'm jumping into this thread and there's just a summary so let me just go down some of the summary items for you guys so Kevin let's see I'm not going to go to the the new stuff I want to go to the summary of like what's happened in court.

[32:16] So basically Kevin is is uncooperative in the case even though it's his bankruptcy case ultimately leading to a bench warrant being issued for Kevin because he wasn't showing up to court so we knew that we heard about that let's see what the latest is so while he is discharges denied he's still in chapter seven and still has debts so trusty and Keith are still working to identify all his assets and liabilities.

[32:46] So the bankruptcy can continue several orders have been signed with regards to clawing back assets Kevin spread around so they're trying to go after the stuff they're trying to get everything that he.

[32:58] You know the people that he gave money to the items that he bought for family members are going after that stuff it's depressing thread i'm going to get out of it because again I just can't with all these threads that just.

[33:12] So I'm going to suck the life out of this hobby what else is going on let's go to like pinball machines for sale and see like if there's anything interesting right now that's coming up for sale.

[33:26] Besides that fifty five thousand dollar magic girl did you guys see that that's insane you've got to be out of your mind to spend that much on a magic girl and.

[33:35] And also guys just again I'll say for the record i'm not flipping my magic girl i really i'm not looking to i know a lot of people are flipping them for the amount of magic girls that were made the number that i've gone up for sale.

[33:49] Is incredible everyone's is trying to get you know there are another ten fifteen k out of it.

[33:55] A lot of those guys are in on raza so they're really not making back much they're they're just but you can't deny it it's kind of ridiculous that you can turn a sixteen thousand or pinball machine into a thirty thousand or thirty five thousand or pinball machine without even doing anything you might as well just take the money and run and a lot of people are saying that's what I should do but again like I don't want to I love the game I love the story behind it and it's an interesting thing.

[34:24] I don't personally need that right now actually you know it would be nice because we're looking to renovate the kitchen so that would help actually maybe I should just I don't know Brendan would love appliances more than a magic girl.

[34:43] Let's see just looking at pinball prices there's a Simpson pinball party for forty two hundred spider man for forty seven hundred walking dead pro for forty three hundred.

[34:55] What else anything Batman dark night for fifty five hundred lots of let's see you know so like a lot of stuff between four and five thousand dollars there's a hobbit smoug sc for seventy six hundred.

[35:12] Nothing kind of crazy in the last really exciting one was that big bang bar collection for twenty grand that ended up selling it ended up selling I love how there was so much.

[35:23] Sort of speculation about whether or not it would sell there was all this back and forth and everyone was like this is proof that things have stall that these things are worth it and boom it sells and just like that all that means absolutely nothing.

[35:35] There's still a guy trying to sell is the bowsky pre order for number one twenty five for nine thousand I just think you got to be out of your mind to go into a bowsky at this point knowing everything they're going for.

[35:49] All right there's a beautiful.

[35:52] Theater of magic for sale play feel clear cloded by Bob gold and let's see him can you ramps you start pose okay see what's in this thing.

[36:05] It looks really nice you know looking at when you look at theater magic to it's like you can't help but just think of magic on and how.

[36:12] Like you know even when you see the magic spot.

[36:15] Sort of magnet over like the rail that goes across the play field it's like John clearly tried to just put the same thing onto magic on just never even got around to it.

[36:30] God it's such a it's such a shame mad girl is it's such a failed attempt at making a better version of theater magic it really is.

[36:41] I don't know I'm I'm only in on a theater magic when the whole thing's been brought played it there's a lot of the rings these titles are interesting lower the rings for sixty five hundred.

[36:53] You know are these ones going to start inching up more and more I I don't think so I do think that the stern LCD error is going to cause the prices of the dot error games down I just think it will and.

[37:08] Things are holding on right now just because there's only been really just one LCD game so far but I really think when it's Star Wars hits it's going to create a shift that's going to drive the prices of the older games down I just I that's that's my opinion on it you know because I see stuff like this AC DC premium AC DC premium.

[37:31] Early let's see this is a premium or not like this is a I think this is a I don't know this is a premium or not only eight thousand nine hundred dollars from I think it's a premium and it's just like no way man like come on.

[37:48] There's no way that I think AC DCs are still should be fetching like eight nine thousand dollars plus there's just I don't know for each the run on each the run.

[37:58] All right well that's it on this edition and canate his pimple podcast some news items really wanted to say aliens looking good I really hope that all these manufacturers can get this stuff out that is the ultimate question though I don't believe it until I see it and even if you see it I don't believe it works.

[38:17] Hey gay magic girl and I want everyone to just try and get a little bit further away from all the character battling and fighting name calling and all that stuff I don't know about you guys but it's it's exhausting I'm exhausted I don't I don't want.

[38:33] Pimple forms to be talking about all these other things in life and everyone's like challenging each other's like sensitivities and and where they stand on certain things that have absolutely nothing to do with Pimple they get taken way out of context so it's good news that there's a lot of Pimple news and I think the next three weeks leading up the T.P.F. are going to be in exciting time.

[38:58] And if you're going in that show I think you're going to be in for one heck of a ride I think you're going to see a lot and I think you're going to get excited by what you see and I think you know boutique Pimple has a lot to prove at T.P.F. so let's see if they can deliver that's it episode this is like what 94 of Canadian Pimple podcast I'm talking to Jerry from P3 next week I don't know what happened to Mr. George Gomez I wish I could get him on I'm going to the stern guys.

[39:27] They really don't like talking they really don't like coming on these shows and I hope to convince them otherwise because I said a lot of great questions for them and I'm still a stern fan don't get me wrong the next game I buy will most likely be a stern so have a great night and we'll talk to you guys soon.
