[00:00] Hahaha! You mean I should go back to that nursery and behave myself? Ah! You want to use chemicals to turn me into a humanoid?

[00:09] Like those other kids!

[00:11] Ah!

[00:13] Kaneda!

[00:14] Stop! There's no Ghostbusters song coming because there's no Ghostbusters reveal. It is March 7th. We are going to get going with Kaneda's pinball podcast at the so-20.

[00:37] We're going to talk about the lack of Ghostbusters reveal this far in the March. I thought we were to see it by now.

[00:44] We're going to talk about some Hobbit. We're going to talk about MMR. We're going to talk about a little bit of Texas Pinball Festival.

[00:52] We're just going to talk about the overall sort of vibe that's happening on Pinside recently. So let's get right into episode 20 of Kaneda's Pinball Podcast.

[01:01] I hate it here! I want to go!

[01:05] Yeah, we've been listening to a lot of feedback from people when we first started this podcast. God, it's almost been like a month and a half now.

[01:14] And I think something that I've heard over and over again was you guys want to hear more interviews. And I have done my best to line interviews up.

[01:20] We've had Ted out a couple times. We had Ben Heckon for a long interview. And last week I interviewed Sean McDermott, who is an operator in Wisconsin.

[01:31] And I enjoyed talking to Sean. I thought he had a lot of good insight to share about Pinball and what it's like being an operator.

[01:37] And that didn't stop some people from complaining that Sean doesn't have a huge Pinball collection or have a lot of games out in the wild.

[01:47] But regardless, I think the information he shared about the reality of being an operator are very relevant.

[01:54] And I think it's hard for people to just accept the fact that a brainless claw game or key game will generate more money than Pinball on location for the most part.

[02:06] That's not always the case. And I'm also going to track down some of the New York City operators that are local who have operations going that I hear are successful.

[02:17] Thank you to Levy for pointing that out so vehemently. So I took him up on his statements and I'm going to track those guys down and talk to them.

[02:28] But that's not why we're going to talk tonight. We're going to talk about just some of what's been going on lately. And first things first.

[02:36] Where is the Ghostbusters reveal? I think waiting for Ghostbusters has sort of created this environment that has created an overwhelming sense of fatigue.

[02:48] I don't want to say anxiety, but just there's a lot of hesitation on the forum lately. People just want to know.

[02:55] They just want to know if this pin is going to be all it's cracked up to be. They want to know if they should wait for it.

[03:03] And we still are waiting. It's all been but confirmed there is an advertisement in a magazine. It's coming.

[03:12] But when I've been almost holding back even on podcast because I know that once Ghostbusters drops, I'm going to want to do a podcast about that.

[03:22] So I don't want things to get too cluttered. But I don't think any of us have any idea. I assume it's going to have to be before the expo in Vegas.

[03:31] So we know it's going to be in the next couple of weeks. But still nothing. And that's just I think once that happens, people are going to like settle down.

[03:40] And the mob needs something new to talk about. You can see on the forum right now, people are just talking about the same old stuff over and over and over again.

[03:51] And that just leads to just a lot of just fatigue and these threads that are just I mean especially the Ghostbusters one.

[04:00] There's like three of them now and one of them is over 100 pages long. And that nothing has been revealed.

[04:06] That thing is going to balloon to a thousand pages when the game is actually revealed. So hopefully we hear something this week.

[04:12] Fingers crossed. If it is, we're going to have a podcast up real fast around that.

[04:18] So but what's interesting and one of the things I want to talk about quickly is the reality of what the Ghostbusters quasi leak has created.

[04:31] And what it's basically exposed within the community is that people are willing to go in and on a pinball machine.

[04:37] And this is nothing new, but they're willing to go in on a pinball machine without ever playing it, without ever really seeing it.

[04:44] And yet they're committing to it. So what does that mean?

[04:49] It is almost like an arranged marriage of sorts. You know, you you you've agreed to make this commitment.

[04:55] People are even in on on the on the LEDs. I've got the posits in and they've never seen it.

[05:01] What what if it comes out and they don't like it? What if it comes out and they don't really like the art or the shot layout is too tight or there could be many other factors that don't agree with them in terms of the type of pin they're looking for.

[05:12] But I think it spells one thing is that people talk so much about learning their lessons and waiting for a game to be complete with completed code and seeing a pinball machine and making sure it's fun before they go in on it.

[05:29] And for some people that's true, but I think there is an equal if not more percentage of people in this community that that say that but don't really act that way that if there is a theme that they're into that's announced that they like they'll go in on it.

[05:46] You don't even have I guarantee you could you could you could announce a dream pin theme and put it in a cardboard box without ever showing to someone and say hey we made a hundred of them who want some there are $9,000 and they would all sell.

[06:07] And people could open up that box and that could just be a complete turn inside and they would still.

[06:12] Convince us that it was it was right thing to do to go in on it.

[06:15] But I think what what it means is that theme is everything theme trumps everything and we're going to talk a little bit about that on this podcast that as much as we talk about oh the only matter is is that it's fun and that it's great to shoot.

[06:31] Along with good theme but I think if you put your priority list of what's the most important thing that draws you to a pinball machine beyond flow beyond fun factor beyond code it's going to be theme and we keep seeing that over and over and over again.

[06:48] Something that I don't understand with ghost busters and I've seen this in the thread a bunch of times is people who are already in on the premium people who have deposits down on premiums can we all just agree that they are going to make ghost busters until the day after I die I mean this thing is going to just keep being made it's going to be like Metallica they're going to make it for years let me repeat that they're going to make this premium for years.

[07:17] As long as people want to buy it they will make it and I think people are going to want to buy it for a long time so I don't understand going in early at all on a premium.

[07:27] It just makes no sense to me why not wait until they fix any issues until the code is more complete and then you still get your premium and who knows stern might make certain adjustments to the game that you'll see later on that the people who got it originally won't.

[07:44] The only thing I understand is people going in on the LEDs early that makes sense they're all afraid they're going to sell out and then that artwork is going to be exclusive to the L.A.

[07:53] But the premium people right now that's a real head scratcher so ghost busters hopefully we see it this week and you know we'll have something really really exciting to talk about when that happens.

[08:08] There are other forces that work in this world for themselves that would have even built both was meant to find the ring which case you also are meant to tell it and that is encouraging thought.

[08:22] You want to know a real encouraging thought putting a hobbit Pimple machine inside a box and shipping it to people who ordered it and that day is here people.

[08:34] Hallelujah there is a picture of a hobbit Pimple machine inside a box now I don't I don't know there's actually a machine inside there.

[08:45] There's a box that says hobbit on it I actually wouldn't put it beyond Jack to upload a picture like that there's not actually a game inside I kid I kid there is that that game is going out and the hobbits are going to start shipping.

[09:01] And I'm really really really happy that this day has come I know for those of you who have pre ordered it and waited forever this day of reckoning is finally here and that's great.

[09:15] Something that just I just can't understand though and I hope you guys can explain this to me so Jack took this game on this like West Coast trip and some of the stops just seemed really strange the one in particular was no down comics on a Friday at five o'clock.

[09:40] If anyone's ever been on the West Coast on a Friday at five o'clock trying to drive somewhere to get to an event and I saw on the flyer said hobbit Pimple between five and six p.m. at a comic shop I mean I don't understand.

[09:57] All these trips with machines they cost money and everywhere you go and travel with machine should have to equals some orders right to rationalize doing that and I think there's nobody really unaware of the hobbit who is in the Pimple collects Pimple and is in the market for a new Pimple machine.

[10:26] You can maybe argue that Tolkien fans and hobbit fans out there might not be aware and that's why they did this but that was just weird to see that and hardly anyone really show up to that.

[10:41] But yeah I want to read someone who went to it they said this is from Pinside User Vic J. W. 66 he says went to play the hobbit tonight at the comic bookstore in Hollywood want a hobbit translate for one of the high scores but I think anyone who asked probably could have gotten one since not a lot of people showed up.

[11:05] All you so-cal guys drop the ball by not coming out seriously you can't hand a little traffic it's no wonder Pimple companies never have these events here.

[11:15] Well I'm not so sure about that I think the timing is off and I think common sense would tell you not to do it in that fashion.

[11:26] He also goes on to say as for my first impression of the hobbit after getting four plays in it tonight it was set up with a low pitch felt like maybe six degrees and low flipper power so it played slow and felt rather easy.

[11:41] Of course I just got the walking dead premium which makes almost every Pimple machine.

[11:46] I'm not sure why they set it up that way kicking up the flipper strength setting pitch to seven degrees and a fresh coat of wax would make for a much more fun and challenging experience.

[11:56] Well I want to thank Vic for posting that and I just continue to scratch my head at this setup of this pin and I know I've complained about in the past but Jersey Jack it's his pin.

[12:10] You think he would set it up so that people's first impression of the pinball machine is a great one.

[12:17] I am still perplexed and confused as to why when he sets it up we keep hearing the same feedback and he knows this feedback so I don't know I am not convinced that this isn't all on purpose and that there's a reason why those flippers are dialed down and there's a reason why.

[12:38] It's at the angle it's at and everything and I hope the reason is not with powerful flippers and a steeper angle stuff is going to break.

[12:48] I really really really hope that's not the case for you guys who are getting the habit.

[12:53] I was laughing at the picture they had at the Louis Vuart Cadix build the habit there. Did you guys see that photo?

[12:59] There's like a little kid in an Iron Man costume waiting in line to play.

[13:03] This is a beautiful panel. I will always attest to that. It looks great.

[13:10] This game set up with all these cardboard boxes. It looks like a bunch of trash just surrounding it with this Tupperware container.

[13:17] It looks like the machine is crapping out a Tupperware container. I don't know. If you're going to set it up, Louis Vuart Cadix build I'm talking to you guys.

[13:28] Put it somewhere nice and not like it's in the back storage area. I mean come on. That just looks bad.

[13:35] I saw the photos from the SoCal Premiere party and that looked like fun. Is that someone's house? Can someone email me at canadapimballatgmail.com and let me know?

[13:45] It's like this home with all these amazing machines in it. It's weird. It's like a weird environment because it looks like in arcade.

[13:56] But there's nothing in the home that is a game room in terms of signs and you know people usually have neon and they have like different posters up.

[14:05] It just looks like a model home with a bunch of pinball machines in it. Anyway, it looked like a fun time.

[14:12] I had a laugh at at Aurex review of the game because I apparently got to play it there.

[14:20] It's always interesting because I love to call out Aurex and his sentiments because I think he's one of these guys who's highly opinionated and I think he also is a very vocal member of the community.

[14:34] But something's happened to him recently and I'm getting a little bit concerned. So in his review of the Hobbit he starts out by saying,

[14:44] and I quote, I want to be fair and not say anything that wouldn't be fair as a competitor to say.

[14:50] I think I've pushed that line too far in the past. And I read that and I was like, what does he mean by?

[14:57] I want to be fair but not say anything that wouldn't be fair as a competitor.

[15:01] I think what he's saying is I'm not going to shit on your product because I'm making a product.

[15:10] As someone who's competing with you with Alien, I'm not going to throw you under the bus like I've done in the past.

[15:17] I think that's what he's saying. So it's like, all right, you know, he wants to be a little bit more positive about stuff.

[15:23] Then he goes on to say, so how about I listen to my favorite things about it and then maybe give a couple thoughts just in terms of what I'd like to know more about or didn't get.

[15:33] And I'll do my best to be fair and just share my thoughts in a constructive and positive way.

[15:37] So we've got this brand new version of Orch. I mean, I kind of miss the old guy who would just tell it like it is.

[15:44] I think that kind of, you know, bravado and straight forness is exciting to read. I get it. Everyone's trying to be super, super nice.

[15:57] He then goes on to say, Jack and I were chatting about the old play field and what I said when it was revealed, friendly chat honestly.

[16:04] And I really want to give him credit for being glad they decide to make things right. It's better.

[16:09] He knows it just like everyone else. And I think they should be proud of the end result.

[16:13] Not every company would take the time and money to do that.

[16:16] He then later on made a comment about that he's not really worried about Ghostbusters and that, you know, he hopes that people by both and put him next to each other.

[16:31] I think this was in the alien thread. I think it was. Here's what I think is going to happen if people put alien next to Ghostbusters and walk up to the game. We're going to hear a lot of this.

[16:42] You're okay. This one. Real fucking ugly.

[16:45] Yeah, I just I have to say I don't buy this whole new nice guy act and I'll tell you why. I think if if or is going to say congrats, Jack, on fixing your play for art, I think he should look in the mirror and go back and adjust the alien play field art.

[17:01] I think that game still needs work. I don't think the play field art is amazing by any means, but it doesn't matter. Everyone's just going to still defend it.

[17:11] And that's fine, but if you put once we put that play field next to what's coming out and what's coming out down the road, I don't think it's any comparison.

[17:19] But again, we'll wait to see it populated. That's what everyone keeps saying. Oh, and by the way, when those eggs were revealed on the pop bumpers, I didn't hear anyone really get excited.

[17:32] No, in fact, they look a little too big if you ask me, but that's just my opinion. Anyway, but underneath this new sort of super positive Zen version of oric, he does make some valid points and he it's weird.

[17:45] He asked them in this like roundabout way, but I think the points that he picked up on the game that are very valid is number one.

[17:53] What the hell is going on? I don't, you know, everyone is playing the pin and looking up at the display.

[17:59] There's just too much going on. So it is a hard pin to jump in and learn quickly and to know what you're doing quickly. And I think that's a pretty universal feeling.

[18:11] Again, I think that will come with time, but this is definitely a pin where if you look at the display, it's impossible to know what's going on. It's just so much going on.

[18:22] He said something to that create a little bit of debate that when you play a pinball machine within 10 plays, you should get what that machine is about. And I agree with that.

[18:32] I think there's too much of, you know, this excuse that a great pin requires hours and hours of learning code and getting intimate with it and learning how to stack and the rules.

[18:49] That is BS. And that's not what made pinball great. It's not what great pinball machines are like.

[18:59] There is a lot of machines out there that don't require that that also have great code and are really deep and enjoyable.

[19:08] And I don't know. I'm on the fence with that debate because I think some people really think about it more from the, or see it more through the lens of the die hard player who studies code.

[19:23] But for pinball to broaden its audience, for pinball to reach new people and for pinball, I got to be honest, just to be fun to guys like me.

[19:33] And I think there's a lot more guys like me. We don't want to have to like learn how to like stack the rules and do all these multipliers.

[19:42] I do eventually want to get that good with pins, but I also want it when people come over to my house and play it.

[19:49] They're enjoying it pretty quickly. And then even with Lord of the Rings, which I think are pretty easy rules to explain to people. People are just lost.

[19:57] They need to just know like, okay, shoot the ring. That'll start a mode and then shoot the red lights and flash. I mean, it needs to be that simple for people.

[20:05] So something else that I just, I can't for the life of me figure out with the Hobbit is the, is why isn't the code done?

[20:17] It's mind boggling and I'll explain why.

[20:22] The Hobbit has been worked on now for a few years. And when it was revealed at Expo 2014, I mean the shot layout hasn't changed.

[20:33] The game mechanisms haven't really changed. So am I wrong in sort of looking at this like Keith has had two years at least extra since reveal to be finishing this code?

[20:51] Or even if you want to say 2014, you know, that first year after reveal, they were still working on stuff. But the last year, the last year where this pin has been delayed.

[21:08] It's been delayed. It's two years late from when it was supposed to ship. But the last year was probably I think the most painful because it's like, what's the hold up?

[21:18] So all the speculation is around money and financial issues. And that's fine. But did they not have money to pay Keith to code? I don't get what's been going on.

[21:29] So I wanted to get to the bottom of this and I, you know, I called Keith up and I said, Keith, why isn't the code finished? Like, can you tell me why? And here's what he said to me.

[21:43] I've been in this business 15 years. What's your name? Fuck you. That's my name. Yeah, I don't, he got so mad. And then I was like, Keith, well, you've had so much time to code this pinball machine.

[21:54] Is it going to be more fun and lower the rings? And do you think that the Hobbit theme can even come close to bringing that level enjoyment considering how much better those films were than the Hobbit? And he got even matter at me.

[22:08] First, take a big step back and literally fuck your own face. So, all right, fine. So Keith, I'll give you a pass on the code. I'm just assuming it's going to be done when the pin ships.

[22:20] But one other question everyone's been asking is the third flipper. I mean, you're coding this machine. You got a third flipper. Can you once and for all tell us what the third flipper is for. Keith, very simple. What is that third flipper for?

[22:37] Say what again? Say what again? I dare you. I dare you, motherfucker. Say what? One more goddamn time. So I let it go. There are some answers we may never get surrounding this pin. It is shipping soon.

[22:51] But I want to conclude my discussion with the Hobbit tonight by saying this. I think those of you who have pre-ordered this machine years ago have been once again tortured waiting for you.

[23:06] And I know some of you will say it wasn't torture and you don't mind waiting. But for a lot of you, you deserve better. You gave your money on a promise that a pin would ship at a certain time.

[23:22] And that not only was that promise not met, it was significantly exceeded in terms of timeline. And what do you get for it? Do you get anything extra for it? Do you get anything more than you expected?

[23:38] I think people will say yes because the artwork changes. But I think deep down inside, when you think about this pin and where the expectation levels were and then what happened at the expo reveal, it still in the heart of hearts of pinball lovers out there.

[24:00] This pin missed an opportunity to really capture the imagination and just hit it out of the park. The dragon that everybody wanted never came. The artwork improved. But the shots and the innovation on the play field, they're just not there.

[24:20] And that doesn't mean it's not going to be a fun pinball machine. It doesn't mean it's not going to be enjoyable. It doesn't mean you guys are not going to get a kick out of it. And I mean that. But I just don't think this pin has been worth the wait. And I think by the time it comes out, I feel bad for you guys who have had a wait so long for it.

[24:39] And this is not pouring lemon on the wound. This is not trolling. And I just wish pin side would get over this whole notion that if you're not in on a game, you can't talk about it.

[24:53] Because that is created in environment now in pin side that has become isolated that has become almost like every single thread now about a machine is just the buyers club for that machine and the threads are becoming boring still and myopic.

[25:10] It's just tunnel vision of owners who don't want to hear anything other than the pin is great who don't want to hear anything other than how awesome it's going to be.

[25:20] And so they've pushed all the other people out. I want to remind people it was the unhappy people that dissatisfied people who spoke up and got positive changes made to games.

[25:34] And they didn't speak up in a constructive way. They bitched. They moaned. They cried. And that ladies and gentlemen is what the company heard the most. It wasn't constructive feedback. It was like, oh my god, I can't believe this crap after waiting all this time. And this is what we get. That was a sentiment. Now, look, I really hope that this is the final time that Jersey Jack pinball does is the people in the pinball community.

[26:03] I do think that people in on was suffer tremendously from Stockholm syndrome. They really do. It is unbelievable how they all guaranteed us that this would never happen again after what happened with was and I I

[26:20] I set by and watched it like other people did and it it all happened again and then some what I hope happens now and I hope and this almost better happen is that for those guys who pre ordered and gotten early that they get their machines before everybody else.

[26:38] I do hope that that is honored and that's the case. I do not want to see Jersey Jack taking new orders and those people getting machines in front of people who waited so long.

[26:51] New money coming in is better than money that they've already put in the bank. So we'll see what happens. But the game is shipping that is very, very good news and I can't wait to get reviews from people who have it.

[27:05] And also from people who don't have it and just to get people's thoughts on the hop in now the price for a medieval madness remake is between 83 and 85 hundred dollars.

[27:17] Now why would I ever consider paying more than that because I intend to squeeze you. I don't like your kind of people. I don't like to see you come out to this clean country and oily hair.

[27:30] Just stepping those silk suits to try to pass yourselves on because decent Americans. I live business with you but the fact is that I despise your masquerade that just honest way you pose yourself yourself in your whole fucking fact.

[27:49] Right so that was not the response from the great American pinball company who just listed for sale to medieval madness remakes numbers 997 and 998 that are in stock for $9,000.

[28:09] So they listed this for sale on Pinside and all these people got all but hurt by the price and you just read that threat. I think it's very indicative of the price police swooping in again and making their bold statements about what everything should be priced.

[28:24] And people were saying that's more than it costs that planetary pinball is still accepting orders on Ellie for cheaper than that. That's fine.

[28:34] Look at how long it's taken people to get their medieval madness remakes. So for them to offer one inbox that you can have that week for $9,000. I don't know not such a bad deal.

[28:49] I'm really getting sick and tired of people not understanding one simple thing that in this hobby and people who buy toys like pinball machines a lot of people just want a toy ASAP.

[29:11] That is how it works with a lot of these entertainment things we just get bored and we want something new and for someone who wants a new inbox, medieval madness remakes you can either go to eBay which they're selling for above $9,000 or you can just go get one from great American pinball company and you have it in a week and you're playing it and guess what you're enjoying it and you're loving it and all those people who are on their moral high horse who paid $500 less are still waiting.

[29:40] And you know that's the reality of it and we all know in this hobby $500 just to have it to have peace of mind and to not suffer the weight is totally worth it.

[29:55] I think people need to stop this notion that paying over for what you think something is worth is criminal. It's not. I saw the same thing on the arcade message boards for years. Everyone thinks that MSRP is what it should be worth.

[30:15] Let's talk about that real quickly. Manufacturers suggested retail price on something and then what the market will bear. Now if a game is hard to get and there's no new inbox ones shipping right now and there's a weightless and you want one you're going to pay over.

[30:33] And the market prices in pinball are pathetically small when I think about what people paid over for the hellcat I've got a front paid $15,000 over sticker for a hellcat.

[30:46] He's depressed because he learned I got mine for sticker in Pennsylvania but like it's not bad a few hundred bucks here and there I mean come on.

[30:56] Here's an interesting thing Ghostbusters Ellie seems like the demand can far outweigh the supply. So I don't think people are going to be getting that that whole street price $1,000 off Stern's MSRP. I don't think people are going to be getting that.

[31:11] In fact if you say there's going to be 500 Ghostbusters Ellie's I don't know what the numbers are going to be and there's way more demand for the Ellie than 500 then what's this stop distributors from marking up the Ellie they're not criminal for doing that.

[31:29] People might not like it they'll get but hurt times 10 if that happens but I don't know let's say it's $89 hundred for the Ellie and more people want it.

[31:43] What if a distributor says okay I got one new inbox it's 10 grand but you're going to get one and it's not going to be use or second hand and you can come with a warranty.

[31:53] Someone will probably buy it and that person is not a criminal they just really want it they want it now they don't want to wait so I think everyone is just stop with this whole notion that people are idiots when they spend a few hundred dollars more and they get the pin immediately so let's leave it at that.

[32:08] Funny funny seeing Mr. Labnip selling is that he's pronounced it Labnip selling a tron Ellie for $45,000 and $45.

[32:20] He has his tron Ellie used to be new in box I thought that was funny in response to what tron Ellie prices are lately.

[32:28] People who don't understand the sarcasm that thread really really really need some help I don't know if they're being sarcastic but when you read the thread it's funny how people actually think he's selling it for that much money but kind of crazy but look it tron Ellie is really this anomaly within the system.

[32:49] And it's going to continue to go up in price up until the day that stern vault additions the thing and then they're going to come plummeting down and I really think that is going to happen but we will have to wait and see on that you know it could be a sunny day 75 degrees out and there could be 50 beautiful virgins that just want to mate with the first menu steps outside and why snow it's so funny.

[33:18] Why snow it's still be inside on pin side I had a laugh that you know I saw the pictures of his full throttle have come in and here I just when it comes to full throttle and this is my opinion and you might have a different opinion but I can summarize it real quickly.

[33:36] I don't give a fuck yeah full throttle I keep hearing how much fun it is and it's just it's like Mustang for me no matter how fun.

[33:47] How fun that pin is it the theme is just so on appealing and and that's and I'm glad people are getting it and it's finally shipping and I saw Ellie number three is going out but he uploaded photos of it and it just reinforces my initial opinion of of highway design and I hope they change it but that thick bezel is just got to go I mean look at the picture it's got this like sort of light gray bezel.

[34:16] And it just it just looks off it just looks totally off I get that they were trying to take a step forward in making it easier to work on a pinball machine without having to remove the glass but they took two huge steps backwards aesthetically and to me it wasn't worth it for that at all you never hear anyone say oh man I'm so happy with like the the way it's you don't have to remove the glass from highway system no one says that.

[34:44] And inside everyone is thinking the same thing and I know they are they just want to admit it but that bezel I think looks pretty bad we're in we live in a world in a cultural world where we're trying to get rid of bezels I have a new OLED TV that just came and it just like no bezel on it at all I mean and we can't go back to TVs with thick bezels so for pinball machine bezels to start getting pick all of a sudden.

[35:10] Ah Andrew please you you're working so hard on these machines make them as aesthetically pleasing as you can because that matters when you put it next to other machines that bezel just stands out but not in a good way.

[35:25] So a few weeks ago I this is true I got an email from Jpop asking to talk and I in typical Jpop fashion I responded to him and this is all true I'm not making this up I respond it to him and said cool like I'm available like when you know when can you talk like is there good news and I just never heard back.

[35:49] For those who have dealt with John over the years it's a lot of that where he literally like reaches out to you and if you don't respond immediately or pick up his phone call and he doesn't respond when you follow up I mean I've literally had many times where he'll call me I'll be in a meeting at work and I literally just miss the call and I go out of the room and I call him right back like within seconds and he doesn't pick up and it's just a little bit of a change.

[36:19] I don't understand like you just called I know you're available but you know I was actually able to get through to him tonight and I asked him I said John how are things going you know can you come on the podcast can you talk to my listeners and let them know how things are going lately and we had we had a good conversation and I asked him John tell the listeners how you're feeling right now.

[36:45] I want it to be over done with I do.

[36:54] I'm tired boss.

[36:57] I had to be on the road long as the smell in the rain.

[37:03] I never have any of it to be with to tell me where he's going to coming from.

[37:11] Most love tired of people being ugly to each other.

[37:16] I'm tired of all the pain of feeling in the world every day.

[37:22] There's too much of it.

[37:24] It's like he's the class in my head all the time.

[37:32] Can you understand?

[37:37] Yes John Nick I can.

[37:40] Whenever J. Pupp and I would talk I would always have emotional music playing in the background at the same time.

[37:46] I think it just just add it a little bit extra to our conversations.

[37:51] So ladies and gentlemen I just want to end this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast by giving a few shout outs to some of my listeners out there.

[38:01] Yes I actually do have some listeners and I know this will shock some of you but I have had 10 over 10,000 people.

[38:09] Listen to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[38:11] Well I don't know if those are obviously not individual listeners but those are total listeners but I'm actually proud of that.

[38:17] I didn't think anyone would actually listen.

[38:19] So I want to give a shout out first to John Del from New Jersey.

[38:25] John actually sent me my first congratulatory email.

[38:28] So I want to thank John for for doing that and for sending the nice note.

[38:33] I really appreciate it getting that.

[38:35] When you're starting a new podcast it's always great to have some positive reinforcement.

[38:40] I want to thank Gavin from Australia for listening to this show.

[38:44] Gavin's really fun dude.

[38:46] Something interesting about Gavin is he's in on a Rob Zombie and it's going to go all the way to Australia.

[38:52] I think that is just super awesome.

[38:55] I want to thank Luke.

[38:58] I think Luke is also from Australia.

[39:01] Luke shared some info on Thunderbird with me and I really hope we all get to see Thunderbirds soon.

[39:07] I want to thank Luke for that.

[39:09] I especially want to thank Kevin.

[39:12] Kevin has been updating my podcast threads on Pinside in my absence and I really appreciate him doing that.

[39:20] I also want to thank the mods for actually moderating that thread and ejecting people and then read the thread.

[39:28] It's been a very positive place.

[39:30] That's all I ever asked when I had my own podcast threads is that the mods would come in there and actually help out instead of letting me get attacked over again.

[39:41] But you know, that's the past.

[39:43] But for Kevin's job and in taking those arrows in the back on behalf of Canada,

[39:49] Kevin has a Pepsi perfect coming his way.

[39:51] So thank you Kevin.

[39:52] And there's more fans out there that I've got and messages from that I will give shout outs to as we go forward.

[39:58] But I want to thank you guys for checking out Canada's Pinball Podcast episode 20.
