[00:00] Didn't need no help for a hell of a time.

[00:05] It's a long way home.

[00:12] It's a long way home.

[00:30] I'm going to ask you a question.

[00:31] What kind of pinball company would you want?

[00:34] Would you want a humongous pinball company like Stern where you've got hundreds of employees,

[00:40] a ginormous operation to keep going every single week?

[00:45] Would you want a company where the pressure to sell so many games every launch or else

[00:54] all of this ginormousness doesn't make any sense?

[00:59] Or would you want a company where you could focus all of your energies, all of your efforts?

[01:05] The company feels like a family and everyone's pushing the same idea in the same direction.

[01:13] Which would you want to be?

[01:14] I mean, when you really think about it, I was like, man, I kind of feel bad for what

[01:19] Stern pinball has to do now with the next game.

[01:24] I know personally the company's been trying to find a buyer.

[01:28] They were trying to find a buyer maybe a few years ago.

[01:31] Maybe they're not doing that anymore.

[01:33] But if you think about looking at what the job has done to Jack Danger, I mean, it's

[01:38] obvious what the job did to Jack Danger.

[01:40] He was one of the most positive, happy, go lucky, a man who loves nothing more than pinball.

[01:46] And I remember walking into that factory and it didn't look like he was having fun.

[01:51] And I get it was in the middle of like the X-Men beatdown he was taking from people because

[01:56] the code wasn't there and there were some issues with the hardware.

[02:00] But still, why?

[02:03] Why did his game ever get rushed out?

[02:06] Why did his game have to have code that bad?

[02:09] Because the better resources, the better coders were put on other people's projects.

[02:17] That speaks of a political issue.

[02:20] I go through the same thing in my company.

[02:22] We have really good creatives.

[02:24] We have some mediocre creatives and we have some junior creatives that are just learning.

[02:30] And you could give us the best like assignment ever and you might get the A team that's going

[02:36] to crush it or you could get like the interns working on it because everybody else is busy.

[02:43] And when you put Weissin on it as lead coder, when was the last time you played a Weissin

[02:48] game that was absolutely incredible.

[02:50] Yeah, keep thinking.

[02:53] And so Stern Pinball is under so much pressure.

[02:57] Spooky Pinball, they can all rally around just one game a year.

[03:02] And look Spooky Pinball is really small.

[03:05] Jersey Jack Pinball, all the money in the world, all the resources in the world.

[03:10] They still focus it all on one game a year.

[03:15] Barrels of fun, one game a year.

[03:18] Dutch Pinball, one game every 12 years.

[03:23] Haggis Pinball, one lie every four years.

[03:28] American Pinball, by the way, is done.

[03:30] I don't know if you've seen this, but they did not even renew the trademark around their

[03:36] name, American Pinball.

[03:39] I think we can probably finally stick a fork in this company.

[03:44] They've let all their trademarks go for all their games for the company name.

[03:49] I don't think it's ever going to come back.

[03:52] Like I don't think Cuphead's ever happening.

[03:55] Chicago Gaming Company, I don't even know what they focus their efforts on.

[03:58] It's not even like it's one game every two and a half years if you're lucky.

[04:04] So here we are on the precipice of the next Stern game, right?

[04:09] The Star Wars game.

[04:11] There's one in Costco down the block from me.

[04:13] Haven't even taken Brenda's Costco card to go play it because I don't really care.

[04:18] But the next game is going to have a lot of pressure.

[04:20] Now we know there's now been, Kari said, the next six games are not what everybody thinks.

[04:26] I don't even care if the rumors are right or wrong.

[04:28] If I were to look at the games that are happening that were rumored, Transformers and Fallout,

[04:33] I think are fake.

[04:34] The two reasons I think they're fake is Brian Savage has the Transformers relationship.

[04:41] He is over at Dutch, no, not Dutch.

[04:43] Sorry, he's over at Barrels of Fun Pinball.

[04:45] You got to look up Brian Savage people.

[04:47] He was like the head of the G.I.

[04:49] Joe and Transformer fan bases and has that relationship with Hasbro all those years.

[04:55] So I kind of feel like even though Stern did a Transformers game, if G1 was going to come

[05:02] out, I would expect it to be with Brian and the relationships he's forged over the years.

[05:08] Why don't we have G.I.

[05:09] Joe?

[05:10] Why did Barrels of Fun make Dune over G.I.

[05:14] Joe?

[05:16] If they had made G.I.

[05:17] Joe based on the 80s cartoon, they would have sold all thousand right away.

[05:23] Dune, Timothy, Shyamaleh movie, nobody, man, nobody in this demo is clamoring for this stuff.

[05:32] I saw a Facebook post yesterday by Barrels of Fun.

[05:35] I'm going to call them out on this because marketing matters and you got to really, really

[05:41] be on top of what you're saying as a company.

[05:45] I said it on my last show that the companies that make you feel good, that are transparent,

[05:53] that is what you're going to remember.

[05:54] Those are the companies you're going to want to be a part of.

[05:57] It's the companies you're going to want to support.

[05:59] So Barrels of Fun puts up a Facebook post to sort of highlight Dune Pimbal.

[06:05] All right, I expect that of them, but they start out the Facebook post saying we don't

[06:12] make a box of lights or a slot machine.

[06:15] Okay, so wow, shots fired.

[06:17] The first sentence of that Facebook post is making fun of Jersey Jack Pimbal indictments

[06:25] from yesteryears.

[06:26] Oh wow, you're going to make fun of a game that is the hottest selling game in Pimbal

[06:33] right now to promote your game, which can't move units.

[06:39] Who posted that?

[06:40] I know who posted it.

[06:41] David's like hiring some guy who's in the Pimbal community to run his Facebook page.

[06:47] And I just want to say this right now, I haven't really been in that much communication with

[06:52] David.

[06:53] I know I signed an NDA, but man, like the two things he told me, I'll never talk about

[06:58] them.

[06:59] And that's that, but I didn't sign any future NDAs.

[07:01] And I'm just going to call it like I see it.

[07:03] David, you got to take your company back.

[07:06] And by that, I mean, you got to really look in the mirror and ask yourself, how am I

[07:11] presenting my company to the Pimbal community?

[07:15] Who is the face of barrels of fun?

[07:17] I mean that who is the face of your company?

[07:20] Who's out there making Facebook lives?

[07:23] Who's out there taking a tour of the factory on a weekly basis, getting people excited

[07:29] about your company?

[07:31] Who in your company is in charge, connecting to the community and making them feel good

[07:38] about your company first?

[07:40] What your products, but the company, you have someone out there representing barrels of

[07:45] fun trolling Jersey Jack Pimbal, who has the hottest game in Pimbal right now, and you

[07:52] can't move a thousand units of your game after four months.

[07:55] And they've sold thousands of Harry Potter's in the first four weeks.

[07:59] You know, I mean, look, everyone needs to just follow what spooky does when it comes

[08:06] to community management.

[08:07] I mean it.

[08:08] Just follow their pattern.

[08:09] They're out there.

[08:10] They're authentic.

[08:11] They're real.

[08:12] They own up when they make mistakes, but they're part of the community.

[08:17] Stern Pimbal is so big, so I don't expect them to do that as much.

[08:20] And that's the thing, right?

[08:21] But when George Gomez talks, it's great.

[08:24] And people respond and the response is always positive.

[08:28] You know, I wish there was more transparency from the designers over at Stern, right?

[08:32] When do you hear from them?

[08:34] Where's John Bork?

[08:35] His game is next.

[08:36] Why is it?

[08:37] I can't wait for you to see my next game.

[08:39] Why isn't he hyping what we know is around the corner?

[08:43] It's his game.

[08:45] And you know, this hobby, I really mean this.

[08:47] It's arrogant.

[08:49] It's elitist.

[08:50] We know when a movie is coming out.

[08:52] We know when a freaking $20 movie is coming out and the people that worked on it, what

[08:59] do they do before that $20 movie is in a theater?

[09:05] They do a circuit around the world and they get everybody excited about it before it even

[09:12] comes out.

[09:13] And yet for a $7,000 to $15,000 Pimbal machine, everybody that worked on it remains absolutely

[09:22] quiet until they want your money on the day it's revealed.

[09:28] That is stupid.

[09:30] That is idiocracy.

[09:32] That is arrogance.

[09:34] That is the reason why they are so bad at this.

[09:42] Why don't they?

[09:43] When you know it's Star Wars, you know it's coming out in a few weeks.

[09:46] Why didn't they at the beginning of August travel around with the game, make all of the

[09:53] major Pimbal content creators sign an NDA and get to play the game.

[10:00] Don't take pictures.

[10:01] They'll be there.

[10:02] They'll invite us to a location to play the game for hours, have no photography and then

[10:08] what would you get?

[10:10] You would get weeks of all of us hyping this game if it's great.

[10:14] You'd only want to do it if you know you had something great.

[10:17] But still, you would still get all the happy go lucky shills out there which is like 90%

[10:22] of Pimbal content these days.

[10:24] But you would at least ignite those guys to get you excited about the game.

[10:29] The other thing they don't do, unlike a movie, unlike a video game, is they don't even give

[10:35] you a release date.

[10:36] You don't even know when this game is coming out.

[10:38] That is arrogance.

[10:40] That is elitist attitude.

[10:42] We're so good.

[10:43] We're not going to help you as a buyer know when you can expect our next product.

[10:50] So you don't know because all we care about is that you buy Jaws 50th right now.

[10:55] And if you buy Jaws 50th right now, we might drop Star Wars on your butt in two weeks.

[11:01] And we need to sell the existing inventory so we're going to keep you in the dark on

[11:05] everything that's happening.

[11:06] I hate it.

[11:07] I hate it.

[11:08] This is why I like Spooky.

[11:09] I know every November, December, that's when they're going to reveal their game.

[11:13] There's no shenanigans.

[11:14] There's no this and or that.

[11:16] But again, as an overall hobby, as an overall community, as all these manufacturers do their

[11:21] marketing, it's always still piss poor.

[11:24] It's absolutely piss poor.

[11:26] They don't know what hype is.

[11:27] They don't know how to do it right.

[11:29] And look, I'll just say this.

[11:31] When you get the theme right and you execute it right, yeah, you might not need to do much

[11:37] marketing.

[11:38] You might not need to do much hype.

[11:40] Harry Potter doesn't need much hype.

[11:42] Star Wars does not need that much hype.

[11:45] It has decades of a fan base that is in the hundreds of millions, if not billions of fans

[11:50] around the world.

[11:52] Yeah, it's going to work out.

[11:54] June Pimbo, Timothy Chamolet, you need to hype that thing.

[11:58] You also need to release it when it's more ready.

[12:00] You can't release a pretty empty software beta version of a game like that.

[12:07] They got lucky even that King Kong was a stinker.

[12:12] You know, I'm looking at this King Kong, a guy can't sell a King Kong new inbox.

[12:17] Now, every day he lowers the price or every week.

[12:20] Now it's 10,400 new in a box.

[12:24] I love all these Kong apologists being like, the game's great.

[12:28] The code's just early gang.

[12:30] It's the next Avengers.

[12:33] Nobody cares.

[12:35] This game is never going to click for people.

[12:38] It's just never going to happen.

[12:41] It's never going to click the way that Jaws did.

[12:44] It's never going to click the way that Godzilla did.

[12:47] And the reason why it's never going to click the way Jurassic Park did, I'm going to tell

[12:52] you right now, it's real simple.

[12:54] One thing, when you hit the start button on Jurassic Park, what do you hear?

[13:01] You hear that theme song that gives you butterflies.

[13:06] When you hit start on Star Wars, the same thing is going to happen.

[13:11] When you hit start on Godzilla, that theme song, the way the game begins, it does the

[13:16] same thing.

[13:17] When you hit start on King Kong, you feel nothing.

[13:22] There is nothing you hear.

[13:25] There is nothing you feel that transports you to that place you need to be instantly

[13:31] in a pinball machine.

[13:33] When you hit start on Batman, it has you right away.

[13:36] When I hit start on Guns N' Roses and that spotlight's going, it grabs you right away.

[13:42] When you hit start on Dune, what is the feeling like?

[13:45] And I mean this.

[13:46] If I worked at a pinball company, I would think the moment of start is so important on

[13:54] every single game.

[13:56] I don't care what the game is.

[13:59] When that person walks up and hits start, that moment should be magical.

[14:05] And hey, you should rotate a few different moments that happen when you hit start.

[14:10] Batman does it when you've got to make so many games.

[14:13] And back to my initial point.

[14:15] When these companies have to make so many games a year, Stern Pinball, it's hard for

[14:21] them.

[14:22] It's hard for them to stand over one thing and as a company and as a community and as

[14:28] a family, really massage that game perfectly before they bring it to market.

[14:35] It feels like Stern's entire thing is always about meeting deadlines.

[14:41] And I have to say this.

[14:42] The last few years of my life have felt like this.

[14:45] Tremendous pressure to be creative and deliver something magical.

[14:50] So many deadlines.

[14:52] Every single day I have to put my time in or they turn off my email.

[14:56] Yeah, it's terrible.

[14:57] And so the more pressure we have to grow as a company, the more the creativity dies.

[15:04] The more the enthusiasm leaves the building.

[15:07] The more the culture of the company just erodes.

[15:12] And I hate that feeling.

[15:14] Can you imagine being over at a company where that's not the issue?

[15:19] Do you think Spooky Pinball is feeling that pressure?

[15:21] No, they're just excited for everybody to see the next game.

[15:26] They've already sold 887 of them to Canada.

[15:29] So sorry, you guys, you're going to get locked out.

[15:31] I'm going to corner the market on it.

[15:34] Is it Beetlejuice?

[15:35] Is it Goonies?

[15:37] But Stern's feeling the pressure.

[15:38] I'll tell you this.

[15:40] Jersey Jack's not feeling any pressure.

[15:42] And maybe that's worked against them.

[15:44] And I think it has.

[15:45] But I think they're waking up.

[15:46] I do.

[15:47] I think for the longest time, because the Abbott family's been financing this company,

[15:51] I think a lot of these guys acted like they were taking a paycheck and there was no personal

[15:55] accountability for what they were putting into the marketplace.

[15:59] And I mean like Jack on a whim wants to make Godfather a bad decision.

[16:04] Not a great decision.

[16:05] You know, in the end though, this is crazy.

[16:08] In the end, that might have still made them money.

[16:12] The people who lost all the money, probably not JJP.

[16:17] It wasn't a huge hit.

[16:19] But I doubt they lost money on Godfather.

[16:22] Who lost money on Godfather were all the people that bought the CEs and all the dealers

[16:27] and distros who are sitting on the inventory because JJP got paid.

[16:33] And people, there's a margin on these things, right?

[16:36] So they're making a lot more in all those CEs.

[16:38] And I think they did sell all 1000 CE Godfathers.

[16:41] There's probably a lot of dealers and distros that are just ashamed to say they even have

[16:45] it for sale because they don't even know what to list it at.

[16:48] They've got to list it on the black market and take cash and get it out the back door.

[16:53] So here we are, August 13th, Stern shooting its newest game this week.

[16:58] I have no idea when it's coming out.

[17:00] Neither do you.

[17:02] And so here's the other reason why they're silly.

[17:04] So maybe you might want to buy it, but maybe you also might want to buy something else

[17:09] for yourself.

[17:10] Maybe a new TV.

[17:12] I just spent on Brenda's birthday, basically the price of a pinball machine on all these

[17:17] other things.

[17:18] I mean, it adds up pretty quickly.

[17:19] 2000 here.

[17:20] Pilates classes are like 1200 bucks.

[17:23] Who knew?

[17:24] Who knew?

[17:25] And so like here we go.

[17:26] All this money going out the door in other areas, I don't know.

[17:31] I don't know if I should wait.

[17:32] I don't even know what it is.

[17:33] They won't confirm the theme.

[17:34] John Borg's not out there hyping it.

[17:37] Welcome to the world of pinball.

[17:39] It doesn't work anymore.

[17:41] It really doesn't work anymore.

[17:43] And what's shocking to me, Stern hired a new CMO.

[17:47] Have you seen a single move?

[17:49] Have you seen a single new thing Stern has done?

[17:52] Maybe this is going to be the game they do it on.

[17:55] Now here's the thing that I think is just going to be comical.

[17:58] They're about to raise prices.

[18:00] And is not there at the existing price.

[18:03] It's not.

[18:04] Even the big themes, they're all losing value or sliding back down.

[18:08] And maybe only the LEDs will hold.

[18:11] Everything else won't.

[18:13] And yet now we're going to get premiums are going to be over $10,000 for an unlimited

[18:20] run premium.

[18:22] This is what's killed a lot of the enthusiasm in the hobby.

[18:26] It's killed it for me.

[18:28] I don't know how many of you out there.

[18:30] And continue to buy $10,000 plus games that are all going to lose $3,000 in value.

[18:39] It just doesn't excite me anymore.

[18:41] I'd rather, I don't know, play around on Coinbase with some crypto.

[18:46] I'd rather do other stuff with that money.

[18:49] I'd rather, you know, I'd have regular investments in life.

[18:53] But the whole concept of it just feels so weird to me.

[18:57] And here's what I love about all of it, everybody.

[18:59] If you just follow my advice and you wait for all these games to come out, the only game

[19:04] you can sleep on is obviously the spooky game.

[19:07] Star Wars, Ellie.

[19:09] Yeah, you might not want to sleep on that, Ellie.

[19:12] But the way Stern's been making their games lately, they really haven't made the LEDs

[19:19] special enough.

[19:20] It's not even about the limited number anymore.

[19:22] They just don't look much better than the premium and the pro.

[19:26] And that's another thing is I think Stern Pinball, they're reluctant to do this.

[19:31] But that Ellie needs an exclusive Ellie topper.

[19:35] That's the thing is that they don't want to give it to us.

[19:38] Like look at what Jersey Jack gives you on the CE.

[19:41] And now Stern LEDs are going to be 13, 5, 13, 7 and not have any exclusive accessories,

[19:51] really.

[19:52] It doesn't work.

[19:53] It doesn't work.

[19:54] And they make all the art packages are looking too similar.

[19:58] It's not enough.

[19:59] It's really not enough.

[20:01] So my advice to each and every one of you is if you love Star Wars and hopefully it's

[20:08] episode four, five and six, Jason Knapp said something interesting.

[20:12] He thinks it could be a game that's entirely based on the battle of Hoth.

[20:17] And I'm like, what?

[20:18] No, there's no way there's enough.

[20:21] From one battle in Empire Strikes Back to make an entire pinball machine.

[20:25] But what there is in that battle is what I've been waiting to see is the at-at-walker falling

[20:31] down and shooting the ball around its legs to drop it.

[20:36] The only thing is there's not enough storyline in just that battle.

[20:40] Now if Stern was smart, I mean, I mean this, just make Empire Strikes Back pinball machine.

[20:46] I mean, I would start with a new hope.

[20:47] I would make all three, but it is what it is.

[20:52] You know, I think it's going to be a really interesting two weeks.

[20:56] I want to say congratulations to Rachel over at Electric Bat Arcade.

[21:02] She had an awesome story in the Phoenix newspaper about that arcade, about Rachel.

[21:08] You know, if you don't know Rachel, she's got thicker skin than most of the men in this

[21:12] pinball content space.

[21:13] Have you been following some of the drama they're trying to throw my way?

[21:17] People are trying to make people pay for a subscription to hear a story about how Canade

[21:23] is an a-hole.

[21:24] Well, I'll tell you right now behind my paywall, the only truly successful paywall next to

[21:30] I think second to mine would be Cary Hardy's.

[21:33] You watch Cary videos, man.

[21:34] Those names are stacking up.

[21:36] I'm happy for Cary.

[21:37] He works hard.

[21:38] He's earned it.

[21:39] The only paywall that you should ever have to pay to hear that Canade is an a-hole is

[21:45] me.

[21:46] I'll tell you myself, I can be an a-hole at times, but I'm more of a nice guy than all

[21:52] of these people complaining about me because you got to remember these are men who say

[21:58] they believe in God.

[22:00] These are men who say they have good hearts.

[22:03] When you try to do the right thing and you try to make amends and you try to move forward

[22:08] in a positive light, and this is why all these men are really hypocrites and it eats them

[22:13] up inside and you could see it.

[22:15] They don't look like they're having fun.

[22:17] They're like, oh, they refuse to do it.

[22:19] And you know what's funny is I bet most of these men lean very much to the political

[22:24] far left and they're the ones who are always saying we should aim for peace and that's

[22:29] exactly what I'm trying to do.

[22:30] And don't worry.

[22:32] I am very moderate.

[22:33] I respect both sides of the political party.

[22:37] I think it's healthy to have both sides of the political party.

[22:40] I think it's healthy to have different points of view.

[22:43] I think it's healthy to put a hot blonde woman in a sexy pair of jeans.

[22:49] I think it's healthy to have Beyonce over there competing in a sexy pair of jeans.

[22:54] That's what makes the world go round.

[22:57] 95% of stuff that offends people today would never have offended them in 1985.

[23:05] Everybody today's lame.

[23:06] The internet is pathetic and social media is for losers.

[23:11] Social media sucks.

[23:12] It gave everybody a microphone to complain about everything and then it made us look

[23:16] into the world of all these people that don't deserve it.

[23:22] The only one who's really made a good use out of social media is Canada's Pinball Podcast

[23:28] and our 660 faithful subscribers.

[23:32] I thank each and every one of you.

[23:34] Thank you for staying on board.

[23:36] I really do appreciate it.

[23:38] More great shows coming.

[23:39] Happy Wednesday.

[23:40] Happy Humpty.

[23:41] We'll be back this week with more episodes of the world's most entertaining, entitled

[23:46] and self-deprecating Pinball Podcast.

[23:48] Canada out.

[23:49] It's a long way home.

[23:50] It's a long way home.

[23:51] I got my shades on.

[23:52] It's always like there's a lot of people.

[23:53] Because the world's long.

[23:54] I'm on my way home.

[23:55] I'm on my way home.

[23:56] I'm on my way home.

[23:57] I'm on my way home.
