[00:00] We are live.

[00:07] There we go.

[00:08] It's post this.

[00:10] Publish a virtual post.

[00:13] Lots to talk about.

[00:14] Lots to talk about.

[00:18] And you know, I'm feeling

[00:20] um,

[00:23] let's see.

[00:27] I'm going to put a Patreon now.

[00:30] Maybe no one's joining today.

[00:32] I mean, it's Sunday morning.

[00:34] I feel like people have much less time.

[00:37] But we'll do this.

[00:38] We'll record it and people can.

[00:42] People can watch it at a later date.

[00:45] It isn't our normal programming.

[00:48] And that is understandable.

[00:50] Jeremy is in the house.

[00:51] What's up? Jeremy,

[00:52] the only one is going to be you and me, bro.

[00:54] Talking pinball.

[00:56] Oh, top of the morning.

[00:59] We are a little late, but we are never.

[01:02] We are never without an entertaining show.

[01:07] How's everybody doing?

[01:09] Carlos prime laser system.

[01:12] Jenga's is in the house.

[01:14] Pete Rosen is in the house.

[01:16] Sad boy.

[01:19] Thoughts on evil dead being number one.

[01:21] Robert is in the house.

[01:23] Scott bird dog.

[01:24] 22.

[01:27] Prime laser system is Steve.

[01:30] Paradis Steve.

[01:31] Welcome.

[01:33] We're going to we're going to talk all about the new games.

[01:38] I think everybody knows by now.

[01:40] Nobody cares about the pinside top 100 ranking.

[01:47] The only thing that matters in life is.

[01:51] I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

[01:54] I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

[01:57] Do you enjoy the games you own?

[02:00] And.

[02:03] Are you going to regret what you paid for your game that you now need to go sell?

[02:08] Because you want something else.

[02:10] T ball was was really eye opening.

[02:14] Killian is such a sensitive, amazing, caring, loving little boy.

[02:18] He's a good kid.

[02:21] And so getting him talked into playing.

[02:24] What was a little difficult, but, but he, he eventually at the end.

[02:30] Wanted to just keep fielding ground balls and.

[02:33] Was a natural.

[02:34] So it was a lot of fun.

[02:36] It's such a beautiful thing seeing young children.

[02:39] Learn things for the first time.

[02:41] And their enthusiasm for it.

[02:43] And they're old men like us complaining about over price pinball machines.

[02:47] And yes, they are over price.

[02:52] Hold on.

[02:53] I'm going to try to raise this screen up a little bit for you guys.

[02:56] You go find something.

[02:57] Hold on.

[03:03] What can I put it off?

[03:09] I need a.

[03:16] I knew there's a reason I kept all these Gucci boxes around.

[03:24] Oh, cozy.

[03:25] I'm on the bed.

[03:27] Let's try to not miss this up so I can start over.

[03:35] I'm just going to get better height.

[03:38] So you guys are not.

[03:45] Get to see my brand is beautiful arm more.

[03:49] All right, who we got in the house here?

[03:51] Who we got in the house here?

[03:53] We've got.

[03:55] Barcelona.

[03:56] Man, Olaf.

[03:57] How's that avatar?

[04:00] 10 grand for the CE coming up real soon.

[04:04] We've obviously got Harry Potter around the corner.

[04:09] What's what's an amazing moment in Avatar Olaf?

[04:13] I'm just curious.

[04:14] Like I'm not I'm not saying this to just single you out or make fun of you.

[04:19] But like describe for us the moment in the game that gives you goosebumps.

[04:24] I'm just curious.

[04:25] Like I've played Avatar so much.

[04:29] And every time I get on it, I just feel like nothing.

[04:33] So I'm just curious what in the game is giving you goosebumps.

[04:39] Like is it just the game itself?

[04:41] Like do you feel like you're in those battles?

[04:44] Do you feel like you're.

[04:47] I don't know how to discover the love of Avatar.

[04:55] Eclipse jackpot.

[04:56] That's the same thing everybody always says that's it.

[04:59] All it's got is that one shot with the eclipse jack.

[05:04] Like that's it.

[05:05] Caching in on that really hard to hit shot is the moment of magic.

[05:12] Bill Brandis is in the house.

[05:22] We're going to get people a couple more minutes.

[05:24] And we're going to start with the topics.

[05:26] We'll be my time on King Kong, my time on June Harry Potter around the corner.

[05:34] My overall observations of walking around pinfest and just seeing the.

[05:43] You know, reading the kind of vibe of the community.

[05:46] I mean, this is what the shows.

[05:49] This is what the show's always been about.

[05:51] You know, my stale pinball podcast.

[05:54] Yeah, apparently.

[05:56] I don't think Rob joins the stuff, but.

[06:00] You know, him and I had a good back and forth, but I don't think my show's stale.

[06:04] I don't think talking about pinball pricing is stale.

[06:07] I think.

[06:09] I think that's been.

[06:12] The talk track of the last few years.

[06:14] And I think when people.

[06:16] Want to avoid it, you're kind of like giving immunity to these pinball companies who are not really giving you what your money.

[06:23] You should get for the money, you know, the value is not there.

[06:28] Canada street is brought to you today by letters.

[06:33] Yeah, I mean, where do you guys want to start?

[06:37] Should we start with King Kong?

[06:39] And I'll explain you my feelings on the game and then we'll go from there.

[06:49] I can't.

[06:54] Balls of I could care less about price talk.

[06:57] Well, balls of steel.

[06:58] I mean, first of all, I don't know who that is, but.

[07:01] Start with Dune.

[07:03] All right.

[07:05] We can start with Dune.

[07:09] Okay.

[07:12] So.

[07:14] Get them in the cook get them in the podcast.

[07:19] The thing about.

[07:26] The poll sweater on him.

[07:29] The thing about Dune pinball.

[07:32] And I.

[07:34] I sent a note to David Vines and by the way.

[07:38] I am.

[07:41] I will talk about it more at a later date as I know more, but I have.

[07:46] Officially signed in NDA with barrels of fun and you'll understand why.

[07:54] And the reason why is.

[07:57] They have some stuff coming that.

[08:00] I really want to help them sort of do these themes justice.

[08:05] They're that good.

[08:08] I think it's kind of like.

[08:11] If you know.

[08:14] I won't be the leak of these themes.

[08:18] It's not happening.

[08:20] I take every NDA very seriously, but I as you'll see, like it's not going to stop me from talking objectively about this company at all.

[08:27] And again, I don't know.

[08:29] I don't think these themes are coming out for a while.

[08:32] So.

[08:33] It is what it is.

[08:34] So nothing I sign will prevent me from talking about the products that they have in market.

[08:37] The thing about Dune is this.

[08:40] And I said it on my show.

[08:42] I'll say it again.

[08:43] This game.

[08:45] Feels.

[08:47] Almost like Batman 66 did when it first came out.

[08:51] There's just no.

[08:53] Game here yet.

[08:56] Okay.

[08:58] You can keep guessing what's next.

[09:00] There's no this game is just isn't ready.

[09:03] Because of that, if you think about like what software does for a game, I mean, it is very much the engine of the game.

[09:09] Yes, there's gameplay.

[09:12] And I'll talk about that.

[09:16] The thing about when you know when I played Dune this weekend.

[09:21] And I played it after I played King Kong, you know, I went one to the other.

[09:26] There is a.

[09:27] A stark difference if you will.

[09:31] And I think that it's a lot of games.

[09:34] I think that Dune.

[09:37] If you look at it in a little bit of a vacuum of, you know, comparing it to.

[09:44] Labyrinth.

[09:45] It's a step up in every possible way from labyrinth.

[09:49] I think the theme again is like it's so over the top Dune.

[09:55] It does the theme justice.

[09:57] It's a game.

[09:58] Obviously has a lot more.

[10:01] It's hard for me even to talk about it because like nothing right now.

[10:06] Grabbed me because even though like the ball literally gets grabbed by the sandworm.

[10:11] It's like the flippers were really weak.

[10:15] The flipper geometry when I was talking about this, I want to explain what I mean.

[10:20] You know, like, okay, flippers are like this.

[10:24] For some reason in Dune when I played it at full flipper travel, it was only like that.

[10:32] It like it got like really flat.

[10:34] I want it more like that.

[10:36] And I think some games that angle of where the flipper flips to definitely changes the control you have can change is the snappiness.

[10:48] So not only did the flippers feel weak, the full flipper travel wasn't really like energy.

[10:55] And or like with any energy throwing the ball up the play field and I just felt like the snappiness and the power wasn't there.

[11:06] I mean, the ball was struggling to get up that left ramp, which is steep.

[11:12] You know, and I just don't think any shot in a game should be hard to hit from a trapped flipper when you nail it.

[11:23] And that is what I noticed when not only I played the game, but Frank played the game, Cliff Albert played the game.

[11:33] And then there was just a really difficult time getting, you know, all the shots hit because of the weak flippers.

[11:46] I think that the thing is when you play the game right right now.

[11:54] There's just no game in it right now. Like there's just not enough game in it. Like the game itself feels bearing like the desert.

[12:07] And I know a lot more is coming, but I just, and nothing will change my mind on this.

[12:16] I just don't think this company was ready yet to launch this game, but I think they had to launch it to get deposits in and to keep the line going because they've got employees.

[12:31] And if there's no more labyrinth games to make, you need to have them make something.

[12:38] But, but it pains me to see a game, you know, where they got so much of what they wanted from the license holder.

[12:51] And yet not being able to get it in in the right way. So it is absolutely a game that if you get it now, you're going to have to wait a long time.

[13:07] And it feels like before a lot of game is there. And with so much competition and so much out there.

[13:17] Is that something you want to wait for now that being said.

[13:24] I mean, I really did like the artwork in person the cabinet look really nice almost how like a rad cow field of translate was nice.

[13:32] It looks really nice. It definitely has that world under glass feel to it. I'm not crazy about their expression lighting system.

[13:44] It you can see the sort of like each individual LED kind of it feels more pin stadium before pin stadium.

[13:57] Now has the cover so you don't see the reflection of the lights.

[14:03] I think the Jersey Jack hot rails really changed the game with inter cabinet lighting and I don't know why engineering something similar is so hard, but there's something about when when lighting just feels it feels artificial when you have like that strip of LED lights.

[14:24] And you can see the strip of lights. It sort of takes you out of that world under glass. And I think I would like to see these guys engineer a different lighting solution that would be more seamlessly incorporated into the cabinet.

[14:42] No lighting is not a new toy that the thing is you know the Sanworm Meck is is really cool like it it shows a real ability to engineer something really awesome again gang you know how I feel all of this is wrapped up in a theme like if this theme were goonies right if it were karate kid.

[15:09] If it was die hard if it was fifth element you know even in its infancy stage they would have sold out.

[15:19] So I think that's kind of my feeling now for them is it's going to be a slow burn.

[15:29] I don't know how burn or how hot it will ever burn for people wanting to get their hands on it because now I don't know what happens next so again my first impressions as I said to David I'll say to all you guys this game was not ready to be released.

[15:49] There's nothing there's no other way it wasn't ready to be released the gameplay is okay it's not it's not like it doesn't have gameplay that's going to win you over like an L win I'm getting completely candid here it's just not.

[16:08] But I could I could start to feel in it when the music was going when the movie clips did come in at certain points and the energy of the soundtrack with the clips and look they've got the assets they've got the Timothy they've got Zendaya they've got in all the clips are synced up with the movie scenes when that starts to happen in the game all of a sudden the game starts to come the life and again I just.

[16:37] I just want so much more of it and I think it's going to get there eventually but I just don't think you can be successful launching in a crowded space with a game that's not going to have people walking away wanting to plunk down at a positive on it so then what's the point.

[17:06] This is part of the you know I'm giving you exactly the same thing I gave David because I just don't think it was ready.

[17:19] So there's there's it is a beautiful game.

[17:25] It is a much prettier game than labyrinth it's much easier on the eyes in my honest opinion than labyrinth like the translate is really cool it feels like it has a real mirrored back glass you know the other thing like gang we don't really bring it up it's not cheap either.

[17:44] You know games 11 6 before you know it doesn't have the final topper all in all in you're now at a 13 thousand dollar game and again I think at these prices you know you're going to buy games because you really connect with the game the theme the package.

[18:07] I don't know you know and as I think about where the game currently stands will they sell 1000 doons at that price I don't think they're going to do it.

[18:22] I just don't think and they might but not they're not going to get like a crazy amount of orders now and you know we know that Harry Potter is just two weeks away.

[18:37] So that's my feeling as on doon pretty game if you really love the theme you probably ordered one.

[18:45] Really cool meck in the game.

[18:49] I love that they got the assets they did and it shows me that if this company is going to make a game they're not going to make a game with like muted clips and a game where the theme is not integrated right like they really did a great job with theme integration.

[19:04] It's just it's not a dream theme for a lot of people.

[19:09] So you know I worry about the sales when I when I think about that aspect of it I don't think King Kong's a great theme either.

[19:22] Let's talk Kong next is that sound good.

[19:24] Harry Potter is on the line right now the reveal video will be out within two weeks I have confirmation from that from distros Jack has been telling people that at pin fest Harry Potter is being made as we speak.

[19:44] So that's going to happen.

[19:48] There's no leaks right now will it leak I don't know.

[19:52] I think we all can wait two weeks.

[19:56] Before we talk about it let's talk let's talk King Kong.

[20:01] So I'm going to say something that I think is true and I think it's something that a lot of people in this hobby struggle to understand.

[20:12] And that you can hold to opposing points of view on something and it can be true.

[20:23] So my overall feeling on Kong is this I think Kong is going to be a phenomenal game.

[20:32] I think it's going to be a fun shooter for people I think it's going to be like you know one of a you know the Ellen fans are going to love it.

[20:42] I think it's a fun for people I do I there's a lot to shoot at.

[20:48] I'll be it I you know I don't think all the mech serve magical but doesn't matter like the some of the parts of Kong you know are going to be very rewarding for people when you play.

[20:57] I just don't I also don't think it's worth anywhere near the money and that's my thing is I just I'm over Stern's modern pricing.

[21:07] I just don't I don't I just I wouldn't buy one I mean that that's my feeling like I just wouldn't buy one new in box.

[21:16] So as as great as I think this game will be I just wouldn't go anywhere near one new in box.

[21:22] Stern has to make thousands of them.

[21:25] And that's the part I love is like unlike other boutiques Stern is stuck gang like they have to crank their manufacturing on all these games to even stay in business.

[21:36] So let them make the game.

[21:39] Let the poor distros.

[21:42] Gobble them all up because of fear of losing their allocation numbers on these precious at least that aren't even precious anymore.

[21:51] And I'll wait because the code in Kong is also nowhere near complete.

[21:56] It is a good six to eight months before this game will even be code complete it.

[22:02] And by then if I even still if I ever wanted to own one I could go get one.

[22:08] So I played it I enjoyed it but I saw it didn't like make me giddy like again no goosebumps.

[22:17] What's so ever on the theme nothing happening it just it did feel cartoony to me.

[22:23] The animations are fine but again I just don't feel any terror right the myth of terror island there's nothing I'm sorry but when you when you make King Kong like this with child like animations any feeling of terror and and like there's no tension at all in making a game this way.

[22:51] And I don't know it just nothing it just feels a little gimmicky a little a little child like when you see the way the game comes at you which is fine.

[23:05] Which is fine but I just I don't know I much prefer Godzilla's assets I much prefer seeing the jaws movie I much prefer a game that is serving up something that's more fun.

[23:21] More relatable and and more I don't know more more more accurate if you will to the theme right this to me this is not King Kong like if I saw this separate of the game I would not be like that's awesome I can't wait to see more.

[23:43] I'm reading some of your comments um pimp a boo.

[23:47] These are available and look I'm going to tell you right now.

[23:57] It is it is hokey um francey welcome to the party look I I want to go off on a little bit of a tangent now.

[24:08] Sterns and trouble.

[24:10] Sterns and trouble guys the mighty Keith L. Win can't sell out of the model they need to sell out of not only that the mighty Keith L. and can't sell through these models.

[24:26] You understand the they needed this game to be bigger than it is.

[24:32] And Sterns and trouble because they've got a price increase around the corner and they know that and they've held spike three back because they didn't want to jack the price up of this game because they need volume they're not getting the volume they clearly thought there is no way.

[24:51] If I'm the CMO Stern and I've got a Keith Owen game I need to adjust the amount of L.E. on every L.E. now so that they sell out week one if we don't get that week one sell out we messed up because everything pins against that L.E. always having some strong demand it's not there right so that they're in trouble.

[25:12] Whoever made the decision to use the same art package across all three models huge mistake that person should be reprimanded the pro model should just have King Kong logo real big no other artwork the fact that you're giving someone with the cheapest model the same exact thing you're going to get when you spend twice as much money these guys are so out of touch in the marketing department.

[25:37] There's so out of touch because think about what you when you're the chief marketing officer or you're in the marketing department of Stern guess what sets the price.

[25:49] The market you know what I'm saying like there's a reason why in your title marketing what is the market telling us that every single Stern L.E.

[26:05] is now trading for $10,000 or less so the market does not want to absorb your 1000 units at 13k.

[26:19] And have they done anything to listen to the market nope they'll just keep plowing forward and raising prices next they're in trouble.

[26:31] They're in trouble they don't have Keith L one on every game they're in trouble and I was thinking about this the other day they don't have and I know what the themes are coming from spooky I know what the themes are coming from barrels of fun I know what's coming from Dutch pinball stern pinball does not have the themes that you and I want I don't know what happened over there I don't know why they were asleep at the week.

[27:01] They're still but they've allowed the boutique companies to go grab some of like the take my money now nostalgic themes you and I want and I think they are delusional when I walked around pinfest this weekend these are the people.

[27:20] These are the people that buy your products these are the cars they drove here in when you go to a pinball show do you see Bentley's in the parking lot you see Ferraris you see Lamborghini's you see $100,000 cars like no no no you don't this is your target audience it's not that people don't have money the people with the money aren't buying like they people don't have 13 to 15,000 dollars per title to throw at these games lose the money.

[27:50] They're going to be $3,000 to $5,000 and you know what I think people have woken up and even the people I know who have that kind of money don't want to lose $3,000 to $5,000 because they don't have phone will be because they have a lineup of great games and they can wait because they're not suckers they're seeing everybody run in quickly and lose a gazillion dollars lose 30% of the value of the game in six months and we're just going to keep doing it.

[28:16] We're not going to stop putting our hand in the fire they're in trouble Keith L. Wynn can't sell his own L. E's out he that that is it people that why isn't it sold out why what's what's the problem so who's the blame is it the art department is it the lack of McKay OK let me let me I'm going to I'm going to tell you something right now when I walked around pinfest.

[28:46] When I walked around pinfest and I looked at everybody there alright these these are the people right for better words this is the clan of people that buy pinball this is the tribe if you will these people are not going to buy Pokemon there is not a sync there's like nobody in the crowd of a pinball show that looks like a Pokemon fan that is into Pokemon.

[29:10] And they're going to they're going to learn in such a harsh way that Pokemon won't sell you more games than back to the future that Pokemon won't sell to this demographic more than predator I'm serious when I say this go walk around a pinball show there's no overlap with who's into Pokemon none whatsoever none.

[29:37] And when you start when you start turning your back on who buys your product what they're actually into what they can actually afford and and then remove from all of those people right thousands of people you removed from all of them any secondhand value of the product because you took it all for yourself.

[30:02] And you don't think turns in trouble they're in big trouble big trouble not in little China they're in big trouble in Chicago Illinois's because what their problem is and it's not just about price gang because now the shift has happened well if I'm going to spend $10,000 or more I'd rather buy from spooky because they're only going to make eight eight.

[30:32] Because I know they need it I know they I know they it matters to them more and I know they're listening to us and I know they're they care they're walking around the show was anyone from stern pinball at pinfest no.

[30:49] How does stern not have no they don't have anybody there.

[30:53] Do they go to every show with reps nope.

[30:55] Nope Nope they don't every sale counts now are they do they do Facebook lives with their internal employees no they don't what do they do they walk around the factory and show you their make it's all they do lazy they've lost touch this new CMO do know who he is nope have you heard from him yet nope has he introduced himself to the community nope.

[31:22] Bro you're the new CMO of stern pinball the battleground for your customers is here you know and again if he's not charismatic if he's not out there if he's not going to become a member of the community like a bug and a Luke.

[31:38] I mean for all these guys like you can't keep hiding you can't keep hiding and we're not just going to keep buying buying buying and all the shell content creators and you know who they are.

[31:49] Well I just want to talk about pinball positivity and I just want to talk about how fun it is and if you played more pinball can either you feel the same we know no no excuse me sir I don't need to play more pinball to get ripped off do I need to eat more hamburgers at McDonald's if the prices get too high just because it's delicious I'll pay whatever they want me to pay.

[32:12] And that's the big change is happened in pinball is while my audience is going up and my subscribers are doing great in my you know the only one getting consistent like canada.

[32:24] Okay go make go make the content that tells you know youtubers get all get all the youtubers who don't even understand pinball to blindly say how great pinball is and how much fun it is because none of those none of those guys were around when when you know and saw any of it they have no they've no historical knowledge of any of it so to them yeah 13,000 dollars for a stern sounds great.

[32:49] They can't sell out they can't sell out of a key fell when Ellie that's it during trouble during trouble because what's next you think John Borg is next alright now you think John Borg has got a 13,000 dollar banger I bet it's skeleton crew.

[33:12] Do you guys want star wars skeleton crew. Do you think John Borg is going to make Pokemon that makes no sense he's not into Pokemon.

[33:22] So John Borg I mean what's it going to be.

[33:27] We know it's going to be something that's not take my money now.

[33:35] But again stern doesn't have momentum anymore.

[33:42] They don't have the good will like they used to you know they just don't and again I think all of this all of this is it all caught up to them.

[33:55] I mean this when I say this they they took advantage of their own buyers.

[34:02] They took advantage they saw what was happening during covid and I understand that prices might have gone up a little bit but they didn't just raise them a little bit and then they started remaking when they said they would in gang they put their thumb on top of the very people.

[34:23] That kept this company so healthy for so many years and why should these people forgive them.

[34:33] And then the new cohort that ushered in over the last three to four years.

[34:40] They look like chills.

[34:43] Do you guys want to be part of that kind of mentality and then I love the notion of like well you know it's about positivity you saw you see this right is like woke ass way to process the world.

[34:57] Where if we want to get prices lower we should just shut up about it.

[35:03] No the way you lower prices is you stop spending money and they'll have to lower their prices they're not going to go to business they'll just have to lower their prices.

[35:13] And guess what automakers have lower their prices watch manufacturers are lowering prices other companies are lowering their prices.

[35:25] I don't know how much money does a distro get to sell in L.E.

[35:30] At margin could go back to you the customer why not why couldn't you just get it why why do they get to make money they're just putting in.

[35:39] Can't say this stuff is why nobody sponsors me now talking to jeng is this morning as shown him you know very proud about the the support I get on the show and all of it is with no sponsorship no endorsements no distro.

[35:54] Like kickbacks nothing.

[35:59] No I don't want to turn the drop the L.E. line L.E. should be 500 units and they should be no more no more.

[36:07] Then 12 5 for stern only and only 500.

[36:11] I'm willing to meet them in the middle a stern only 12 5 max with a topper 12 5 with a topper max.

[36:23] Only 500 12 5 with a topper of premium should be 89 99 and a pro 6500 whatever 12 5 with a topper I'm not spending 13 and then another to.

[36:41] I'm you know and an L.E. needs to really be special.

[36:55] Am I right or wrong I mean look maybe I'm in my own vacuum talking to my own little.

[37:01] Army of people.

[37:03] But man it is so easy now not buying a new inbox stern and and guess what a lot of people are like you and me now because I've reached out the distros Kong is not flying off the shelves and you know and like let me let me give another like truth bomb right now if the L.E.s don't sell out.

[37:25] That negatively impacts the orders for premiums and pros the L.E.s selling out is quintessential it's necessary it is mandatory for that L.E. to be a hot commodity to move the other units.

[37:43] The moment you don't have that L.E. fire everything else suffers because then everyone starts to second guess and guess what their second guessing is accurate.

[37:55] They have to make these games you don't have to buy them.

[38:05] You're in the drivers seat.

[38:09] You can control pinball pricing not them they're about to take the price up.

[38:18] You imagine what's going to happen when a stern L.E.s 13 6 plus more for this more for that.

[38:28] I mean insider connected you know people are realizing insider connected all these dumb badges you know you know you're all realizing now.

[38:36] I don't know if you guys have realized this go play Xbox and PlayStation if you want to get online play that's fun.

[38:42] Playing Halo again FIFA been playing lot more video games you know when you start to realize how overpriced these pinball games are and they've never made connected play a fun really fun.

[38:55] It's like you're not connected to the other people that own your freaking 13 thousand dollar King Kong what so you're just connected to when these dumb badges all the time that's it that's it.

[39:09] Where's the where's the co-op modes where's the alright I'm playing as Kong you're playing as like the airplanes and where's the one V one nothing on any game where's the four player co-op with ninja turtles so four dudes who own turtles can all go out at the same time nothing.

[39:28] Is this to you this is internet connectivity in 2025 for 13 thousand.

[39:37] Game wake up wake up for so much less money you can now have so much more fun and you know that's the truth.

[39:54] And I get some guys out there have a lot of money and you know who they are and I've never told you I have a lot of money to burn on people you know I still need my paycheck.

[40:06] You know I'm not sitting on tens of millions of dollars I'm very transparent about that I dress as Bill Brandes would say I dress wealthier than I am absolutely.

[40:18] You know I know I have very wealthy friends I'm not one of them I didn't do as well as my father I'm part of that generation right.

[40:28] But I'm happy most days not every day curve balls will happen.

[40:36] You know I'll tell you I'm on a personal note I had a real convalescent moment last weekend that.

[40:45] Rocked me to my core so I don't know and most of you know this but I've had I've had an estranged relationship.

[40:51] With my older brother for the last 25 years and unfortunately his wife passed away.

[40:57] Of cancer and at the funeral service.

[41:02] We reconciled after 25 years of not talking to each other.

[41:09] And he was the first one to say to me and my twin brother I'm really sorry for the last you know 20 so you 20 something years and I mean you want to talk about grown men crying like babies in public.

[41:23] It was everything to me and I feel such a burden lifted off my shoulders because I've carried that childhood trauma with me for so many years.

[41:32] And having him back in my life and having he has a beautiful son.

[41:37] And families everything and I mean as I look at the some of these things and.

[41:42] You know I I don't know I feel like we've placed an over emphasis on these material things and they're just that gang like they're just transient things and I get it it's all about having fun.

[41:58] But man you got to like put into context I would trade all the Pimball machines in the world to have a better relationship with my older brother and I would.

[42:07] Burn every Pimball machine just to like live longer to see my kids grow up right and you guys all feel the same way but my point is this is and I mean this once you cross these thresholds and these games cost this much money they actually are they actually are costing you other things that would be far more valuable in your life.

[42:32] And I don't even think it's the money gang a lot of it might just be the time like the time like the mental time you spend.

[42:42] Worrying about this or that in Pimball like the money lose like.

[42:49] See to me here's what's fun about Pimball.

[42:53] Can you just Pimball podcast think about like you join the show you get 320 minutes shows a week sometimes longer not too much time out of your week right you join here for 90 minutes we have a lot of fun we talk about stuff on a level that nobody else does like nobody else even comes close to actually like all right.

[43:16] Let's just be real and I feel like I'm the only one now that actually talks on behalf of us.

[43:26] Like everyone just became a manufacturer of shill man everybody.

[43:33] If French I mean I feel the same way man but like forgiveness man it's like.

[43:43] And don't get me wrong like he was that to me two man and I think he just got broken.

[44:04] I'm just reading your comments gang.

[44:14] Well thank you Josh Josh.

[44:17] I mean there's you know what it is you know gang there are no show notes there and I think the live and I think people understand this is when you do live it's so much more who the person is and I think you guys understand this right is anyone can you know do a show and like edit.

[44:45] But it's just something different you know it's just something different.

[44:50] Alright so I think Stern is in trouble.

[44:54] I think their new cmo has his work cut out for him and it's not because I think they're bad people at all gang I don't and I want to I want to talk about the flip side is I I think Stern just bit off more than they can chew.

[45:09] And I think they grew too big and I think Jody and George and Gary and somewhere along their licensing department they just.

[45:21] I keep going back to this singular moment because remember like in life there's sometimes there's like a seminal moment.

[45:30] If that's the right use of the word but there's like it there can be a singular moment.

[45:35] That absolutely it's like the moment blockbuster had a chance to buy Netflix for 20 million dollars or whatever it was like 60 million dollars and they said no.

[45:50] And so the moment in every company's history where they made a move that sent them on a course they can never recover from okay and to me that moment for Stern is when they had an opportunity to make back to the future and they said no.

[46:13] I still can't understand it. I still can't comprehend it and it it's still telegraphs to me.

[46:25] Oh my gosh how out of touch they are with who buys their product to the point where they hired an agency to help them know who they are.

[46:40] And once you reach that point like George Gomez could have called me up and said Chris we got a chance to do back to the future with Joe Camman cow should we do it yeah George absolutely absolutely do you want to make 50 million dollars or not 80 million dollars I guarantee it.

[46:58] They lost touch money was rolling in you know and what made Stern so good over the last 10 years right iconic stuff Batman ghost busters AC DC Metallica transformers spider man I mean you know they have a viral like the iconic themes but it feels like they're out of it like it's dried up.

[47:22] And now like their strategy is oh crap like if a current day thing flops we're just going to burn old customers with a remake like if they come out with walking dead remake dead on arrival and I think they're going to do it if this company does walking dead remake it another what will that telegraph there they're out of touch nobody wants another walking dead.

[47:52] Yeah I mean it should be tron there's a new tron movie coming out will it be tron that would be the smart move will see I don't know if they make the smart move I'll be the first to congratulate them but I don't think it is tron.

[48:08] Let me tell you something about getting new people to care they don't they don't.

[48:19] New people don't care about pinball. New people can't afford school they can't afford rent they can't afford their car payments this is the most ridiculous way you could spend $15,000 just think about it for a minute just think about it.

[48:40] It's not it's not a it's not a wealth generating use of money right when you when you have disposable income 99% of financial advisors would say you use your extra capital and put it into wealth generating areas that's what adults do so this is a item for man children.

[49:10] So it's a toy.

[49:14] You think young people have money to buy these toys they don't.

[49:22] Look the the the easiest way to approach stern pinball it is you get everybody who's into pinball to invite one friend to join in on the fun.

[49:43] Can you let me give you a marketing idea right imagine this.

[49:53] What do I know about marketing what do I know nothing.

[49:58] You're stern pinball and you want to bring new people into the hobby.

[50:04] You've got L.E.s are always selling out.

[50:09] But I want these L.E. owners I want them to invite a friend to join in on the fun.

[50:16] There's so many things you could do to introduce the friends of these people.

[50:22] Do they ever invite L.E. owners to the factory only L.E. owners with a plus one friend so they could see what goes into making pinball machine.

[50:34] If you took a tour of stern and you're another one of these like wealthy dudes you grew up with our kids and you saw what went into this maybe right now you're only in the cars or this is that.

[50:44] I think you'd come away from that factory tour feeling like you know what like instead of just another Rolex in the drawer or another hundred thousand dollar s class you know order one.

[50:55] Have they ever done that.

[50:57] Do they ever invite L.E. owners only to the factory think about that for a minute that people who have spent the most money on their product.

[51:07] Have they ever invited just those people.

[51:11] No.

[51:15] Instead you've got these youtubers running around like making throw away content talking to a bunch of broke ass kids don't even know why they're gaming.

[51:28] They're gaming personalities now talking about pinball.

[51:32] I mean seriously and I'm not talking about retro Ralph I'm talking about some of those other like when you know people that had running around there that have absolutely no.

[51:42] No connection to pinball whatsoever.

[51:44] They didn't even think about like new ways to introduce people to pinball they just they thought they'd get new owners with contemporary titles and that is a recipe for disaster.

[52:15] The next idea is they can pay me for.

[52:17] I mean look you know I will say this if Stern did offer me the CMO role and I would have to make at least I mean it be taking a pay cut for sure.

[52:36] But at least a quarter million dollars or more right and I don't even think that job pays that.

[52:44] But it be like one of those jobs you take because you could you know you could justify it with the you know the the the you know the funny would be to do it.

[52:56] But if I if I were to take a Stern CMO role and again I don't think the salaries are that great I would also want to have a bonus built into my salary or to my contract.

[53:08] That was conditional on revenue based on marketing decisions that I implemented.

[53:20] You know like okay so like the way a designer might make more per game sold like well the CMO should have a bonus based upon sales I mean that's it.

[53:32] Because I still think they're leaving a fortune on the table in areas like modding in areas like art in areas like merchandise in areas like.

[53:52] Exclusivity I mean that.

[53:56] Kelly Daniel King Kong the great in person and please amazing Kelly Daniel ladies and gentlemen pinball palace operator extraordinaire thank you Kelly.

[54:08] How about this Kelly it is it doesn't look amazing it looks okay.

[54:15] It looks okay it does you know Kong is big.

[54:18] I just I just don't think Kong as a wow mech though in it am I wrong Kelly.

[54:35] Did you see the Jamie Kale and Ralph video where Jamie was trying to get everyone to unsubscribe I did see that I've been asked about that many times.

[54:46] Jamie and I had a nice.

[54:50] Like we had a nice text battle that ended up in us.

[54:55] Burying the hatchet.

[54:59] Look I am.

[55:02] I didn't think it was fair spring in that on those other two guys and and I just I don't you know I really don't.

[55:09] No one unsubscribe so like I I and I know he'll be back so.

[55:15] I know he was just sticking up for his friends at barrels but I don't even think he realized too because I'm like bro like I'm still.

[55:23] In good company with David Van S and the people over there so I don't know why you're so mad at me you should be mad at them.

[55:30] For releasing such an unfinished game.

[55:39] Um.

[55:43] Let's talk about the spider and King Kong.

[55:51] I am.

[55:54] I think it sucks it is the new tie fighter on the spring but whatever it's fine there's so much other stuff in common the spider just feels like yeah it just feels like after thought thing they put in.

[56:04] It is it's so crappy though like it just keeps going like this after it's activated and it just it's it's annoying.

[56:20] I don't know I I I wouldn't.

[56:23] I don't know it looks I don't even I wouldn't even bother modding that part of the game.

[56:28] I love that we've got now 142 people watching after I go on these like truth bomb or you know what I'm saying it's like funny it's like oh man I feel like people are like I'm he's talking about you talking about you's talking about you.

[56:41] You know I don't know man I mean maybe I should reach out to the new stern CMO but again I just think he's got his work cut out for him.

[56:47] I think he comes from the gaming space I know they know him I think I heard he came from like wrestling to or something.

[56:54] I don't know if he knows pinball though and as I told this to George.

[56:59] This is a very unique hobby and I think when you bring in people from outside categories to try to figure pinball out.

[57:07] Good luck.

[57:08] Good luck.

[57:09] Nobody nobody knows this hobby now more than me who has a marketing job.

[57:15] I mean that I literally have spent 12 years of my life alongside my job.

[57:24] Becoming an expert on pinball and not just the products the people the community the the realities like you can never you can never learn what I know it comes from over 10,000 hours of studying this hobby in this industry.

[57:43] I would be the most valuable addition to any company's marketing team.

[57:49] It's just absolutely I you couldn't even put a price on the institutional knowledge I now have.

[58:00] And and and the effectiveness and the efficiencies of being able to make the right calls instantly because you know so much.

[58:11] But you know what you know what's like.

[58:15] You know my dad said this to me is like well.

[58:18] You know because I when I was talking to my dad about like when I was like actually meeting at Stern and he's like well.

[58:24] You know do really want to give up though like the freedom you have and the creative outlet you have of your show.

[58:31] I was like oh man like.

[58:33] Right I mean imagine being the Stern CMO and you walk in there and like what do we got and then you they tell you everything like oh F no right this is what we got and they're like okay and we also have the raise price.

[58:44] And we've got 600 people working here and we need to make 800 games a week and we've got thousands of games in inventory unsolved like a mat because if I walked in as a CMO like Chris what would you do here we've got 3000 we've got 2000 unsolved John Wicks and boxes and 1800

[59:04] items in boxes unsolved the first job you have is to get rid of these.

[59:11] You got what?

[59:13] Jack Danger looks like burnt out and I've noticed that.

[59:39] I don't think he's I think he's seen the other side right he never looked like that when he was streaming these games right I mean you can think about like he's he crossed the Rubicon and it and it's like I you know it pays more but like at what price.

[01:00:03] And I bet when you work on a game like these guys work on a game for so long like you can't even like you're kind of over it by the time it comes out and then everyone's complaining about it is probably a very thankless thing to be in.

[01:00:17] Well I'm in the corporate world to it's like all corporate jobs are kind of like on some level are the same you kind of just have to like.

[01:00:33] To the company line and be careful and you know work as long as you can before they get ready to.

[01:00:41] Christie thinks during could sell out of WIC if they drop the MSRP on them by one or two K now now because the the market value on them is way less than one did you K off like right now at John WIC ELE is about $5,000 off MSRP.

[01:01:02] Thank you Brian that's exactly what I just said right.

[01:01:05] Like there's no one it's like it's like Jersey Jack trying to sell these GNR at least for 2000 off when the market is almost $4,000 less on everyone.

[01:01:16] I'll make you guys a bet X men uncanny X men never gets saved I don't even think.

[01:01:37] It's not going to get saved gang that you do actually thinks during pinball it when they can't even sell out of an L one L Lee when sales of Kong are not as good as they needed to be you think they're going to divert resources.

[01:01:53] To save a game that died on the vine and X men do you think they're actually going to go all in on that they're not going to save that game there's the work required to fix that game is too much and they're not going to pump more money there again because they didn't make the money they're telling you right now.

[01:02:16] Yeah good luck thinking X men's going to get a major overhaul.

[01:02:23] Exactly the reason why they fixed Game of Thrones and Ghostbusters is they sold really well nothing thank you Josh nothing is happening on this X men.

[01:02:41] The thing is that T shirt of like I told George could also apply to my father because that's his name.

[01:02:53] George Gomez tells the truth.

[01:02:59] What about when he said he wasn't making more at least.

[01:03:05] Except except that time.

[01:03:09] No but I don't think George understands like what what the gripe is on the game.

[01:03:19] Let's in the next 22 minutes.

[01:03:28] What's what's everybody's feelings on a by the way and I mean this when I say this and I know I've been accused of saying this before and I because I know and I'm going to say this because I'm in the presence of the of the artist.

[01:03:47] Evil dead is the most stunning game of the year.

[01:03:53] I mean it was at the show every sign on it was sold out it it looks better than Kong.

[01:04:02] It looks better than Dune it looks better than Avatar.

[01:04:07] It as a total package that game is just a stunner.

[01:04:16] There's so much in it there's just I mean this when I say this.

[01:04:22] Beetle juice will sell out in 10 minutes.

[01:04:31] 10 minutes.

[01:04:36] I I'm getting a beetle juice you're getting a beetle juice and evil dead gang that the demand for it is greater than the supply.

[01:04:44] I the game is going to hold value.

[01:04:47] You are not going to see evil deads losing $3,000 in value in a year like a sternile.

[01:05:01] I just I got to give credit where credits do.

[01:05:05] I never thought I'd see a day where I walk into a pinball show and spooky pinball has the most stunning game out of all the manufacturers.

[01:05:13] And again to people's point not just the art I mean everything the next the shots the amount to hit the wide body like it's got more in it.

[01:05:23] What is Kong have in it you start asking these questions let's ask these questions.

[01:05:30] From stuff that interacts with the ball what is King Kong really have in it oh you can you can ask that canada oh you got it you're going to get in trouble.

[01:05:40] Shots are the new toys truthfully Elton John shoots way better than King Kong.

[01:05:51] I said it it's a much more fun game to shoot Elton John can say it can say that.

[01:06:01] Not allowed to say that I might be Steve Richie's like recycled layouts but man it's it's it's got more.

[01:06:13] Close better got better combos has a cooler wire form.

[01:06:22] That dies more fun instantly when you hit start.

[01:06:34] I don't know Albert I don't know I mean I don't want it either one I wouldn't buy other one but yeah.

[01:06:47] What's up clan.

[01:06:51] Look man where this guy pretty good audience should we do this let me ask you guys a question should we do this on Sundays it might have to be Sundays from now on because of T ball.

[01:07:04] I I don't know who glens talking to you.

[01:07:11] You guys like Sunday.

[01:07:21] Alright I mean I like Sunday too.

[01:07:29] I like canada Sunday morning surface it just feels like feels very like a religious experience being here with all you guys.

[01:07:42] Well look I mean you know who's going to dictate this is killing not me.

[01:07:55] You guys like Sunday morning spectacular I you don't like canada Sunday morning service come on I think it's a different name.

[01:08:04] Alright let's spend the next Harry Potter.

[01:08:07] Oh man how many of you deep down.

[01:08:11] I still nervous about Harry Potter I mean I feel like it's only natural.

[01:08:17] I just wonder how Jersey Jack is going to mess up this game.

[01:08:22] I just I don't want them to but man I just I glad how are you not nervous like have you not seen Jersey Jack's last few offerings.

[01:08:37] I don't understand how could anyone be like oh man yeah with with with utter confidence Jersey Jack nails it every time.

[01:08:44] Come on like how are you not nervous.

[01:08:52] I don't know anybody could like act like dead J.J.

[01:08:55] He's got this.

[01:09:00] Well I'm nervous about the mute eclipse.

[01:09:05] What does pinball look like in 10 years it's over in 10 years no it's not.

[01:09:10] I mean 10 years like we're all hopefully we're all still around hopefully we all still have some money.

[01:09:15] I think I think in 10 years it'll be all boutique companies I don't think major companies like Stern will survive in 10 and 10 years now.

[01:09:24] What's the level of sales they need to meet the cost.

[01:09:29] Well Jersey Jack doesn't need to make any sales because they have so much money.

[01:09:39] It's not going to be more stacked than was gang it's a single body single body game is that it the single body standard body game.

[01:09:47] Single body game it's not a wide body.

[01:09:51] I don't you can't really fit as much in a standard game as a wide body.

[01:09:58] Here's my worry about Harry Potter mute eclipse lack of magical toys and just eight movies of material like in a blender.

[01:10:11] That's my worry about the game now what I think is going to be amazing gang is David feels back when that David feel music and the and I just hope it's not.

[01:10:25] I'm not worried about multi balls because it's Joe cats I'm worried about rainbow puke lighting and Harry Potter.

[01:10:34] That's my big worry to Jack already confirmed there are muted clips clean he in an interview that people asked him and he said that there's both.

[01:10:46] Which makes you nervous like why would there even be muted clips.

[01:10:59] You know the biggest mistake in all of of pinball is that stern did not make an individual game for the star wars trilogy.

[01:11:08] There should be a new hope game in empire strikes back game and return of the Jedi game what dumb decision it was to split those up into one pin why would you do that.

[01:11:20] I mean seriously they would have sold 8000 of each each and everyone would own all three.

[01:11:30] Should we make 24000 pins or just one.

[01:11:38] John at jack bar did you look again I'm going to tell you right now the way to go on Kong is Kong pro.

[01:11:49] I think it's a great shooter.

[01:11:51] It's a great shooter the animations are kind of kitty like feels like a Netflix animated show.

[01:11:57] But I think when you order Kong pro you're going to get the best of what Kong has to offer.

[01:12:04] And again I think if you buy Kong pro for 6500 you'll bang on it for a year and then get rid of it for 5500 5000 great you didn't lose much money if you buy the other models you're going to get destroyed in the price.

[01:12:26] No I don't like the Kong art at all I just don't like it.

[01:12:31] It looks like a con it looks like I don't know it just looks like a kids book I you know I'm saying like I I have books for killing that.

[01:12:46] It's just it's not how I think it misses the mark they should have done more iconic King Kong movie poster vibe.

[01:12:56] And they should have gone way more into the romance and the.

[01:13:02] I wish they would have leaned all in on like an art deco King Kong like make make the whole game.

[01:13:09] Here's where they messed up the whole game should have taken place in 1932.

[01:13:17] You make this whole game take place in 1932 and you have this art deco romantic and even with the illustrations and the animations yeah you can make it 1920s New York.

[01:13:29] I think the whole game should have taken place then.

[01:13:33] And then you could have had this beautiful you know all the moments on the island animated to look a little bit more like stop motion the way the original movie was I think it looks it looks

[01:13:45] like a movie.

[01:13:48] It looks like it looks like it looks like a comic book it looks like it looks like a comic book it looks like a comic book when I look at it.

[01:14:01] Am I having audio scratches did this thing uh oh did it can you still hear me.

[01:14:13] I might have messed this up is that better.

[01:14:19] See what going on here how's that.

[01:14:25] Almost at the 11th or any mark it's not better.

[01:14:31] I think I think I moved it.

[01:14:55] you

[01:15:25] you
