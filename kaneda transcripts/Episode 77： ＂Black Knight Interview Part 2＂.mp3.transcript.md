[00:00] So, Minnesota's sweetest tragedy won't ask for absolution.

[00:04] This melody inside of me still searches for solutions.

[00:16] All right, this is part two of Canadian's interview with the Black Knight episode 77.

[00:23] If you haven't listened to episode 76,

[00:26] do not listen to this episode as you won't be able to track what we're talking about as well.

[00:32] So, go back and listen to episode 76. You'll really enjoy it. This is part two.

[00:37] If you remember, we last left you with the following question.

[00:41] When the market stalls and there's no operators to buy games, what happens to manufacturers?

[00:49] So, that's where we left it and I'm going to roll the tape for part two right now.

[00:55] When the market stalls and there's no operators to buy games, what happens to manufacturers?

[01:03] They go away.

[01:04] They go away because they had to have nobody that buys their games and I can guarantee you this time

[01:11] around if Stern's in that pickle, our collectors will not buy their games in volume. They'll buy them in

[01:18] the LEDs and the stuff like that, but they will not be able to make anywhere near the number of

[01:22] games as a result they'll shrink, but they'll still be able to do the one or two pinballs again.

[01:27] That's how they'll do it. Instead of introducing maybe three or four titles a year,

[01:32] maybe they'll scale it back to two. But they do that. These other companies can't.

[01:38] Well, the other companies don't even... I mean, I kind of laugh a little bit because most of them

[01:42] are not even shipping anything. It's this weird climate where like... So, Jack right now has

[01:50] Hobbit on the line. I think Dial they're supposed to come out in line.

[01:54] Line knowledge. There's plenty of distributors that have Hobbits and Boxes.

[01:58] Oh, tons. You see them all the time. Look, and that doesn't even count what's in the market now is used.

[02:03] The crazy thing is there are some people who pre-ordered and paid in full for Hobbit when it was

[02:08] first announced years ago, who still haven't gotten their pin. Well, they have a special serial number.

[02:14] They're just waiting for theirs to be made. But the way it works is like a lot of distributors

[02:22] just put in orders and stockpiled a bunch of games. But it's a tricky business. This is a

[02:30] slippery slope and it's like one mistake. And as, woo, you're... I mean, all of a sudden, it's like,

[02:36] oh, I'm in trouble. Well, that's the thing. I know Jack has investors, but I don't think they

[02:42] can afford to have Dial then be a flop commercially. No, I don't think it'll be a flop. I think it'll

[02:47] be a marginal success. And I said that to other people. I think based on their pricing models and

[02:53] the number of LE's and Super or whatever they limit addition and collectors additions,

[02:59] I think they're going to break even and make a marginal profit. But this isn't the game that's

[03:06] going to save pinball. I mean, I mean, I'm not making fun of somebody did a rationalization and

[03:13] trying to compare it to pinball without 2000. And they said, well, this is exactly an example of why

[03:18] pinball like pinball 2000 that failed. And I was like, what? I'm like, do you know the history of

[03:24] pinball 2000? You know, it didn't fail. All right. It didn't fail. It sold. It sold. And it actually

[03:31] sold better than expected. Although there was another state of the climb, of course, after episode

[03:36] one because they and they writing was on the wall and then the old is like, no, I'm not playing

[03:41] this game anymore and taking a risk because there was that huge lag, which is what we've been talking

[03:46] about between the design phase and the production phase. They didn't have another game ready yet.

[03:55] They had played, well, they had wizard blocks and then I mean, and sometimes it's just fun to

[03:59] think about the past. That's why I say to every time if you think about the past, you can see so

[04:05] many commonalities and I'll tell you a stir. They're not stupid. They've been, hey, they've learned

[04:11] some lessons and I applaud them because they needed to. So Chris, do you think Jersey Jack then

[04:18] needs to accelerate game number four. Just have it ready. So dialed in isn't right. That's kind of

[04:25] his backup plan where he, I mean, as he's producing, he better, I mean, I don't want to like

[04:33] demand something. But I mean, if he isn't like past the drawing board phase and starting to think

[04:39] about a prototype and as this game is being produced, he's way behind the power curve because you

[04:46] have to have just like sternos. Stern's got stuff planned out for over two years. Oh yeah, easily.

[04:52] I already know what we're going to do now. I mean, that's not how this works because once again,

[04:58] they know that they got to keep moving that assembly line down the road and keep moving with

[05:03] pins as soon as the hike dies. People said, I mean, you said yourself Batman 66, what's that?

[05:09] People are already starting to forget and it just came out three weeks ago. I know. It's like,

[05:15] I mean, I'm not making fun of the game. I personally didn't really like it myself because I

[05:21] think that whole way there was handled kind of put a little sour taste in my mouth. But that's my

[05:26] perspective looking at it from a history standpoint. Remember, I kind of look at myself as an historian,

[05:32] more than even a collector now. I just like knowledge because it, you know, it's in, and of course,

[05:39] it goes with things like technical knowledge and stuff too because it all comes together. You know,

[05:44] somebody I had a discussion with someone on a related note. It was about the importance of

[05:51] pinball documentation and paper and says, well, why do we care? We just go to the internet pinball

[05:58] database and I can download the PDF file, the manual, and I'm good to go. Really? Well, where did

[06:05] that come from? All right. How's the originals? Where are the originals? What happens when you make a

[06:12] copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy? You can't read it. Where do you get the technical work?

[06:19] I mean, there's all sorts of things that, so there's what I'm trying to say is there are more

[06:23] aspects and interesting things in the hobby than maybe just even machines. How about, you know,

[06:29] what about prototype artwork? What about, you know, all these promotional items? That's why things

[06:33] like coasters are popular. I mean, there's all sorts of cool things, by the way, I tell people,

[06:38] for all those listeners out there, just never forget, there are lots of cheaper things you can buy

[06:43] and be interested in pinball than the actual machine. Oh, yeah. I'm not saying you should be a

[06:49] collector of paper manuals or schematics, but I'm not telling everybody else to turn into,

[06:54] you know, Sam Harvey, but it's, but you know, artwork, I mean, CPR does pretty good job with their,

[07:01] you know, reproduction backlasses and they're generally pretty affordable and you can stick those

[07:05] things in a frame and wow, they look nice. Yeah, I think that's something that, I think John

[07:11] and Papa Duke, he failed to realize that even just the artwork zombie Eddie created for him,

[07:18] he could have just started selling a ton of that. Yeah. People everyone would have hung on their

[07:22] wall. I don't even know about a play fill. I mean, there are people out there right now that, I mean,

[07:26] I have a friend of mine and there are, he's by far not the only one, but it's always interesting.

[07:32] I mean, I have a pretty big back glass and translate collection. I've got about 100 backlasses

[07:37] starting from 1950 and about 200 plus trans lights starting from 1985, right? And I have like no way

[07:45] possible enough space in my fucking house because the biggest problem with backlasses is you can't

[07:52] put them up unless you have a frame. You know, and I walk into my friend's house and he likes playfields.

[07:59] All right. And he has, he's the classic one where you go into the game room and this isn't even

[08:04] this game room. This is his play field room. Okay. He's got play fields on the ceiling on the walls.

[08:11] I mean, he's got stacks of play fields in boxes, not in boxes against the walls. It takes

[08:16] to be for decks, you know, it's not. I mean, but the amount of money that's in that room.

[08:21] Right. There's not a game you can play. They must have spent 50,000 in play fields. I mean,

[08:27] it was just like incredible, but, but, you know, once again, he can appreciate art. And I just,

[08:33] I help people that because when one games get too expensive, don't feel like you can't be involved

[08:38] in pinball. Just go a different route. Right. And I think it's a good point because, you know,

[08:44] if you just get off the hype train, it's a lot more enjoyable. I just had a friend who called me up

[08:50] and he's like, Chris, I just started dating his girl and she really likes pinball. He lives in St. Louis

[08:54] and there's all these great barcades in St. Louis with pinball. And he's like my favorite game.

[08:59] I was like, I really hope to own one one day is an NBA fast break. He's like, it's just so

[09:03] much fun. And I'm like, I'm like, it just felt good to hear. Hey, someone's not getting

[09:09] something. It's like a holy grail. Yeah, and it's just great because, and me, I'm like,

[09:14] I'm like, man, like, you can go get that for, you know, like, two, three thousand dollars.

[09:18] And that's a great thing. Yeah. It's the same costume with early solid state

[09:22] bovver game like synth R, right? Well, the last and I'll love it. And, you know, I'm almost like,

[09:28] don't ever go on to pinside. Don't ever get it's like, don't ever go down that road.

[09:33] They'll get sucked into the line. Yeah, you'll start, you'll no longer have fun and you'll

[09:38] start spending the price of a small car on a pinball machine and it won't even make you happy.

[09:45] That's the crazy part. So here's another idea for collectors out there. If they get really

[09:49] annoyed with pinball and, you know, taking the Canadian break, which is obviously an acceptable method,

[09:55] like I started doing videos. I did two videos because for a couple of reasons. I did two EM

[10:02] videos. One was on Joules. If you guys can look it up, just look up the black night wash and state

[10:06] pinball stronghold. My shameless plug. But the only reason I share it with the audiences,

[10:11] the first one I did was on my ballet Joules from 1969. And the reason why I did it was a

[10:17] history features and gameplay videos. Each video is under 30 minutes long and it goes through the

[10:24] history and all this stuff on the game. And the reason I did it is guess what? There was no

[10:29] information whatsoever on the internet other than the internet pinball database. It never had a

[10:35] video been done. Ever in 47 years. So I'm like, well, crap. I mean, there's a lot of people that

[10:42] need questions and ask her, how does this work? What is it supposed to do? So, you know, there's an

[10:47] idea too. Hey, if you've got a fairly decent, you know, size collection, you want to do something

[10:52] to help the community do a pinball video. A good one, by the way, with a tripod. So the

[10:57] shit's not shaking all over the place. You know, because that's the bad part, like my significant

[11:02] other girlfriend, like she gets like motion sick when she watches these people with these pinball

[11:07] videos. That by the way, she really likes. She wants to own her own first machine. Get that for a

[11:11] matter. What does she want? She wants a paragon. Yeah, from 90 get a fire. I want it. Well,

[11:18] first thing I told her is, well, what's your price range? Because they go from anywhere from

[11:24] the thousand bucks to like 3500 if you want one that's just completely cherry and redone. But,

[11:29] you know, and that's extreme for a paragon. I mean, Robert Urbanowitz just put up a new old stock

[11:35] playfield for a paragon and he won it eight hundred and seventy five dollars plus fifty five

[11:39] dollars shipping, which by the way, isn't a bad price for that game on parable playfield. New old

[11:44] stock. Right. They, well, until CPR makes them, they don't exist. There's not that many. So,

[11:50] yeah, I, well, I told her I might buy her one. Let's say I might. Yeah, artwork is incredible.

[11:55] Oh, yeah. I love the backlash because I've got a, well, I'm not trying to shame this bug, but,

[12:01] you know, that's why I said there's other things to collect. Like I have a new old stock paragon

[12:05] on backlash. It's been sitting on my wall for 25 years. So, you know, she saw that backlash and

[12:11] she was like, what is this game? So, you know, we did a little research and well, I guess that's

[12:17] become her holy girl. But it, it's just opportunities for all sorts of these other things. I mean,

[12:22] you, why not? If you are starting to get good at let's say learning how to repair EM games.

[12:28] Why not contribute the pinwiki? I mean, you can see where I'm going here. I'm not trying to do a

[12:34] shameless plug in regards to tech. But there's just so many other areas in pinball that can be equally

[12:40] as exciting as getting that brand new game new inbox. Oh, yeah. And you can learn so much more

[12:46] because you're not learning anything once you put this new game out of the box and you play it.

[12:50] Okay, it's great. And you turn it off. Well, what have you really learned other than you had fun?

[12:55] You can have a whole lot of fun. Obviously, we talked about like, you know, pinball gatherings.

[12:59] You've discovered that the Texas pinball festival is one of the best shows in the United States.

[13:05] It is. It is. And it's like, hey, that's not a revelation for a lot of people. It's definitely one

[13:12] of the best shows. And why the people? Right. Well, I think a lot of these guys who, you know, if the,

[13:21] if they're only engagement with the hobby is new inbox collecting, I'm going to get everyone.

[13:28] I mean, you could see it. Like they're chasing after something and they're trying to.

[13:34] They'll never get it. They'll never get what they're looking for. And it's, it reaches a point

[13:39] where it then it starts to just consume their lives in a way that is just unhealthy. And I recommend

[13:46] that people take a few like Buddhist classes and meditation and learn to just like, it's all,

[13:54] it's all, it all means nothing at the end of the day. But you can enjoy pinball without getting

[14:00] consumed by pinball. But even the guys who get very consumed by like the details and the repair

[14:06] and collect like, you know, learning how to fix it, for example, like that journey to learn that

[14:11] skill to fix and work on machines is more rewarding at the end of the day than just saying,

[14:15] in the long run, yeah, take my 15 grand. Yeah. You take my 10 grand, take my 10 grand. People

[14:20] need to watch the, have you ever heard the movie, the red violin or the VLAN Roush?

[14:25] Okay, it's the start. It's a strategy. Just try to vary. They're looking for. Correct. Okay.

[14:31] I, if it's Samuel L. Jackson, see, I love quotes sometimes. You know that. I'm a quote guy.

[14:36] And he says, in the end of the movie, I won't spoil the, I recommend if you're like pinball

[14:41] collector and so watch the movie because it's pretty damn good. There's a lot of similarities

[14:45] between pinball and this red violin. But the point he says is at the end of the movie, he says,

[14:50] well, what do you do when the thing that you've been looking for all your life and you finally

[14:55] find it? Where do you go from there? Right. Okay. For purpose is gone. There's nothing. What do

[15:03] you strive for? Well, the answer is, well, that's why you have to look beyond turning the power

[15:08] onto a new machine and playing and have fun. You can see how much of a big advocate or I am as a

[15:13] collector to expand people's horizons and worlds beyond what they know because I know for a heartbeat.

[15:21] A lot of, I mean, don't get me wrong. I got a lot of friends that they only like solid state stuff,

[15:25] late model and not. Right. And I tell people, I says, have you ever played a wood rail?

[15:32] And they'll go, well, no. I says, I always just go by those. I says, you really need to try it.

[15:37] And what you find a lot of times is they go, wow, this is different. I mean, it's slower. You

[15:44] know, they say it's slow and the balls hard to play or whatever. But the reality is is once you get

[15:50] that sensation, you're, you're satisfied with your, your collector goals and where you are in your

[15:56] life, if you step backwards and go backwards in time, you're going to find out, all guess what?

[16:02] You're starting all over again. No, totally. And it's, and it's never ending. That's why you keep

[16:08] going backwards until eventually you go back to the games that don't even have power.

[16:16] It's true. I mean, and it's very relatable as a car and do this is the same thing car guys. I mean,

[16:23] they go back and they drive the cars that were more visceral, more raw, had no power steering.

[16:29] And it's a different sensation. And part of it's just connecting with the history of the thing

[16:33] they love in a way that no new car can provide. It's funny today because they announced this week

[16:42] that Dodge is making a more powerful version of the Hellcat called the Dodge Demon. And now all the

[16:48] Hellcat guys are like, this sucks. Like, I just convinced my wife that this was the final car we

[16:54] were going to get. And now they're all second fiddle. And Dodge is caching out in the last

[17:02] error of muscle cars because it's all going to be autonomous and electric soon, which leads me to

[17:07] a question, Chris. So, yeah, where do you see this hobby going like in the next five years? How

[17:11] much longer does it have? Well, there's a lot of, well, there's going to be a lot of change in

[17:16] five years because in the next two years, like, like some of the predictions, you're, we're going to

[17:22] start losing some manufacturers. We just, they cannot be sustained if the price rises continue to go.

[17:29] I don't see pinball machines of a super le nature. And you mentioned this flipping thing.

[17:38] Certain flipping is going to be over that older machines, it's like I said, that, that

[17:43] pinflation. I like that word, pinflation. It just has a nice ring to it. But that limited funding

[17:49] option that, you know, there's, there's a breaking point with the people that want to buy a pinball

[17:55] machine. And, and that, and that price range for a used machine is $2,000. That's where it is right

[18:03] now at the economy, we're carrying out between $2,000 and $2,500. And once games go past that,

[18:11] they can't buy. They, they, they just can't afford it for the, you know, average, you know,

[18:18] average buyer. And then if you look at the hard core guys, you don't see them dropping more than

[18:23] eight or $9,000 in one shot. They just don't, not the, the more hard core guys. So when you look

[18:31] at the where the pricing is today, you know, you've got, you're right at the cost. Yes, the super

[18:39] LEs and the LEs will, will sell out for the 250 year, 300 games or whatever. But that's,

[18:45] that's not a mark. That's not an industry. That's not healthy. You know, you, you know, the

[18:51] haven't have nats will always continue to move farther and farther apart. Pinball will remain

[18:58] accessible for the average person as long as they're realistic in their goals. You know,

[19:05] but they're going to have to reach farther and farther back in the time. That means that EM pinball

[19:10] machines, this year was just plain retarded stupid. I mean, we had popular EM titles, the ones

[19:19] that people know like Atlantis and Mermaid and, and, uh, just, I can, yeah, KISS has always been

[19:28] popular. That's because of the branding. But there's a lot of EM pinball machines out, by the way,

[19:33] well, KISS is solid state. But the, the lot of the EM games, I mean, they were commanding prices

[19:39] close to a low end early, bali solid state or low end solid state modern game or late model game.

[19:47] So they're, they're pricing up too. So yeah, the days of like buying 102 out of dollar EM pinball

[19:54] machines are pretty much over. But like I said, you can still get something as long as you're

[19:59] ruling the role of your sleeves and, and, and start cleaning stuff. But, but you know, in terms of

[20:05] the, the, the expansion factor of the hobby, we're going to see that pot, let's stall happen within

[20:13] the next two or three years. And then you're going to see a regression for a while because remember,

[20:18] you don't have the operators to sustain the industry. Right. I think I think this stall is like

[20:24] beginning, right? When you look at, oh, we don't already. Well, the game sales, it's stuff is

[20:29] sitting. Right. But the, the new inbox sales for the Christmas season this year dropped. They did.

[20:36] Because they, they couldn't, they couldn't, well, they're competing against use games. And people

[20:40] are looking at go, do I want to spend, you know, $7,000 on a new game or do I want to spend $3,000

[20:46] on a use game that's pretty good? Well, they're going to, they're, it's just like I was talking to

[20:51] a dealer the other day. I, I'm in, I've been in the market for 4 million BC. And there was a guy,

[20:57] he was a new buyer. This is that classic scenario, a new buyer kind of, you know, and it relates to

[21:02] your question. This is directly answering your question. He walks into the dealer. He is not

[21:07] familiar with pinball. He doesn't have a specific holy grail in mind or a theme or anything else.

[21:12] He just wants to buy a pinball machine for South's because he thinks they're cool because they're

[21:16] popular. And the guy offers him a 4 million BC that's 40, 45 years old. That's in good shape.

[21:26] It was well restored. It has a single bell and it has multiple, right? And then he offers him a

[21:34] lethal weapon three from Dada East that has bells and whistles and beacons and has sound calls

[21:41] in music. Which do you think he chose? Litho weapon. Yep. Exactly. And it wasn't because the gameplay

[21:50] on Litho weapon was better than 4 million BC. It's just because it was flashy. And, you know, the,

[21:56] the prices were the same. See that, that's an indication of where the market is right now.

[22:03] Right. But that can't hold. You can't eventually pins just sit.

[22:08] Well, and also, you know, if I always just look at it too, with so many new games coming out,

[22:14] you know, now it's like the LCD error. Well, it's also like, at some point, if you're a collector,

[22:21] you want to, you're new to the collection and you find out, hey, like, did you know, like,

[22:26] Stern's had like 15 titles in the last like three years and you can go get them used for anything

[22:31] much cheaper than all these absolutely. You're not going to be an idiot and go,

[22:36] go run to a new game that has unfinished code that's not proven. You're going to have your

[22:42] selection of some terrific titles for thousands less than they were new with low plays in

[22:49] that edition. Yeah. And that is the catch 21 of pin the pinball industry. Every time it thrives,

[22:55] it struggles because it competes against its own. It's kind of why? It's on market. Right. Why?

[23:01] Exactly. It eats itself alive. But here's the other thing I always throw people out.

[23:06] Something to consider as it applies to the market and as it applies to buying games. Look carefully

[23:15] at whatever game you're going to buy. It doesn't matter what title and think about spare parts too.

[23:21] Stern does not make spare parts for games that are older than 10 years old.

[23:31] They usually don't support games after five years. And whatever stock parts they have in their

[23:38] warehouse are usually they might hold up into 10 years and once they're gone, they're gone.

[23:45] They don't want their pinball games from 2003 to survive because they want people to buy new

[23:54] machines. Yeah. They don't see a dime on a secondary sale. They're fine. Well, that's bad.

[24:01] That's bad for business. I mean, if they have their competing against one of their old

[24:05] Simpsons pinball parties from 2004, who was like the third or four or third or four front,

[24:11] they're not winning there. And they certainly don't want to support the game to make more parts.

[24:16] It was rare for them. They actually made a run of white star board sets, which was they sold out

[24:22] almost immediately. So think about that guys because if whatever game you want to buy,

[24:30] make sure it doesn't just make sure it's a good example to game. Well, that's fine.

[24:34] But what happens if you want to buy spare parts for that game and it's from Stern?

[24:41] And it was, I mean, good luck trying to find a ramp for like a roller coaster type,

[24:45] who knows something. Because they don't exist. And that's something to consider when you buy

[24:51] your toys too. Because if you're considering that you want to keep it for a long time,

[24:57] then you need to think about this stuff. A lot of people don't really think about their, you know,

[25:01] they see it as that throw away toy, which is exactly the way that Stern's looks at it,

[25:05] which is kind of the scary part because you think about it a guy is buying a seven or eight thousand

[25:10] dollar toy. And then it's almost to the point that it's designed to be thrown away.

[25:16] Yeah, well, that's 10 years. And that's scary to me because I don't look at games like that.

[25:22] Well, yeah, it's also funny though because like on Pinside, I feel like no one even plays their

[25:27] pins. Everything's got less than 200 plays. You got to wax it down everything. All of that glass,

[25:32] right? Less than 200 plays. That's everyone's like four-sale. They all they do is,

[25:37] well, they just take the code, right? Exactly. They turn back to your dominer by putting the code

[25:43] back in again. Stamp roms on their old game. I mean, I don't know. I think it's hilarious.

[25:49] Reset the batteries. But I mean, it's just, you know, I just, I laugh because there are a lot of

[25:55] people that, and even I get wrapped up into it, you know, but at times, but I just like to educate

[26:01] people because like I said, there's so many good things that you could talk about with pinball that

[26:05] don't relate to the hype. That's the whole thing. I mean, if you want to talk about hype,

[26:10] it just gets tiring. I stepped out of the whole AP thing and Houdini and Magic Girl because the

[26:15] reality is there's nothing more that'll come with it right now. For example, either builds it,

[26:19] Magic Girl, he doesn't. We're at that point. We're done. Yeah, and look, I, the reports I'm hearing are

[26:25] really, really positive right now. And I think it's going to surprise people when they see it. I mean,

[26:30] it's AP. Yeah, I mean, AP did not spend a year working on something that's just going to like not

[26:37] ship. That's, that's a huge loss. I mean, all the parts, all the labor, I mean, all the parts.

[26:44] If, if for people getting Magic Girl, the first thing I would do is try and get a replacement

[26:51] part of everything. Well, I don't know how much that would cost, but I mean, it's good.

[26:56] Amps stuff might be a good idea, but you know, like I said, the key is, you know, if you're a new

[27:03] and box buyer, boy, I would think that you would be buying some of those extra hard to find breakable

[27:08] parts. I mean, I used to do that. Hell, I have a whole box full of parts for Lord of the Rings

[27:13] that I bought my new inbox in 2004. I know they're still on the box. And I don't even know in the

[27:18] game anymore. We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll. Stirns. Sell you. If you go through a new

[27:22] stirring, will they sell you part by part? Anything you want? You have to go through. You normally have

[27:27] to go through your distributor. And if it's something that you can get us an aftermarket parts supplier.

[27:31] if if something breaks then you can go directly to your distributor and then they

[27:35] will you know contact or you can go through part that stern if you're nice you

[27:39] can go to their parts department and sometimes they will sell it but the reason

[27:42] they don't want to sell things sometimes directly to consumer is that they're

[27:46] afraid they don't want to get flipped right okay that they'll get some like

[27:51] like all to rare part and then all of a sudden it shows up on ebay for 300% of what

[27:56] they buy 10 of the

[27:58] they won't have that they will not sell you like a hundred sparkies so you can

[28:04] put them on ebay they won't do that so you know that there been real tight when

[28:08] it comes to parts in the last I don't know about jersey jack and the other

[28:12] companies but stern tightener grip and it was about three years ago because the

[28:18] trans like there was a trans like boom doggo and it was because they were all

[28:24] allowing owners to purchase additional trans lights at cost and then they were

[28:31] shown up on ebay particularly when they were trying to avoid that that that whole

[28:36] le phenomena right they didn't want like you know owners

[28:41] you're saying oh well my game is an le and you know they're they're putting

[28:44] something together using parts and you know they wanted to avoid that that's

[28:48] they don't start all the way back for example with spider-man with black spider-man they didn't

[28:53] they didn't like sell it's actually pretty funny we ever heard how they what they require to get

[28:59] like a replacement back glass or something for like an L.D. spider-man come out before because I

[29:03] know lower their rings too there's big issue with like they won't sell anyone the back glass

[29:08] unless they like well you can leave back as broke actually well the way it works you can actually

[29:13] now you can still find onesy and twosies out there that not just on ebay there's like there's

[29:19] other like parts suppliers that actually have that back glass that you can buy it's like an

[29:24] absurd amount of money it's like three hundred dollars or whatever but you know for that back

[29:28] glass you know I look at back glasses back glasses can be very expensive but they have to be either

[29:33] really old and in good shape or very rare you know like long a sponsor I have a locked

[29:38] a sponsor in store that that's a good example because it's just like 15 of them left and over

[29:42] 15 were made but the the way they worked it simply was this is you had to take a picture

[29:48] of your broken glass and then they had to send them the pieces which I that makes sense that makes

[29:56] sense it's not funny I was like you had to put them in like like a novel open it makes sense because

[30:01] what would happen is one guy would take like multiple pictures and hand it around to his different

[30:05] friends you own machines and they were just well if they validate if you didn't have the physical

[30:10] glass with the pictures then you didn't yet now you can report it with that but here is a caveat

[30:15] is if you wanted like parts for oh let's say that you have a black spider man today and you break

[30:22] your back glass you you can call up Stern and ask him can I get an extra back glass and they're

[30:27] going to laugh at you because they've been sold out for years I mean they the last time they had

[30:34] them probably was somewhere around like 2009 2010 because there just wasn't that many of them made

[30:38] but my my point is is that's a concern when it comes to games where you have to think about this

[30:44] kind of stuff because if you have like an le you know don't expect it to be running the Stern

[30:49] and saying oh well we'll give you another le back glass because they're not going to do that I

[30:54] mean they just won't do it anymore because well once it cuts into their profit margin and two they

[30:58] may not simply just not have it right so yeah don't get to I mean it's that don't don't drive

[31:04] yourself insane on the le train how about that for a quote yeah well true like well I think Stern's

[31:10] learning too there's a lot of money to be made there's a lot of profit in especially in mods

[31:16] yes they they finally wise up on modding equals they're trying to get more profit oh I mean they're

[31:24] probably paying like 80 bucks for that Ghostbusters topper from China if that and selling for five

[31:31] hundred dollars I don't know I have imprised it I know that they're deal with metal mods and they're

[31:36] trying to attempt the control copyright laws sounds like pps yeah okay I mean they're they're

[31:42] 40 that's just insane one of the thing one of the biggest things that and I'm not going to call

[31:47] anybody individually out but people probably knew who I'm talking about don't promise that you're

[31:52] going to make certain parts and never build them okay I've got there's some stuff that was promised

[31:57] five years ago and I haven't still haven't seen anything about certain parts manufacturers right

[32:03] and I'm seriously I mean I got people collectors have gone out and made their own for Christ's sake yeah

[32:09] I mean it's also frustrating too because you're like if even just a few years ago you know there's

[32:14] all this like talk of IP and Frenchman and Stern's protecting the IP it's such it's so not

[32:20] fun anymore because there and I work for major brands and creativity yeah and they are and

[32:26] these major brands new line cinema is not going to go after some dude who made 50 Gandalf light

[32:33] its staff pinball mods like it doesn't you know when you bought them from hobby lobby exactly they don't

[32:40] even don't the only thing that would ever happen is a letter would go out being like hey can you

[32:44] can you think about stopping this they would it would never pursue so it's unfortunate just on a

[32:50] funny note just for leaders viewers or listeners education and funniness you remember was it the

[32:57] pinball decals website what pinball decals dot com they they remember all the mods that they

[33:04] were you know they're like obscenely absurd costs right like three or four hundred dollars

[33:09] but I I still remember like on medieval madness they had like a two headed dragon that had like

[33:14] a fire breathing thing with an LED or something and it costs like three hundred and fifty dollars

[33:19] and I remember I went to Joanne fabrics and I found the same exact dragon for two bucks oh yeah

[33:26] and then he and I mean there's no way he put two hundred and ninety eight dollars for

[33:30] actually made even been higher I work into like drilling this thing and putting out the leds in I

[33:35] mean it just I hate a hundred dollars for the I think it might have been even more for the

[33:41] shiny genie lamp and toad in and that's pretty yeah that's pretty expensive I mean it is looks like

[33:46] a two dollar toy it was probably been like Peru and hopefully the paints good and it doesn't flake

[33:53] now don't get me wrong I love creativity I think mods are awesome I think some of the mods that

[33:58] make are things that should have been designed with the games and you know for example the one

[34:04] that everybody can know is like the fangs on Metallica for the snake that should have came the way

[34:10] it was from the factory I mean that it should have but it didn't and I'm not saying they cheat

[34:14] out they just didn't think about it or maybe it they thought it might have interfered with the

[34:18] operation of the actual you know snake itself but yeah it's creativity I mean it you know if

[34:25] if if Stern had known that that was a big hit they would have put a cease and assist on

[34:30] letter on that three three years ago or two years ago well there's things they the things they

[34:35] can go after are things that are directs like I'd like you like yeah right yeah like you could

[34:42] so so for example like they can they don't have you couldn't go after someone if they just made like

[34:48] slime like if you have a slime on top of a piece of plastic that goes on Ghostbusters like slime

[34:55] itself is not trademarked as I'm aware of but if you make a a topper that has like the Ghostbusters

[35:03] logo on it and you're selling it yeah like you're they're gonna they're gonna nuke that sale yeah so

[35:09] I definitely think it's a little bit of a shame that they're they've sort of monopolized even the

[35:13] modding of their own games because I think to your point too it's like it stunts growth you're

[35:19] now something it's another it's another example of people being turned off and saying okay fine

[35:24] this isn't as fun as I thought it was and they're the ones that wanted the mod because modding

[35:28] huge I mean everybody's like oh mods I mean granite I'm a purist and you know like when somebody puts

[35:33] like LEDs in a EM pinball machine I start shuttering but I mean it but that's me I mean not that's

[35:40] me personally I know everybody else likes you know LEDs because they last longer and they're cooler

[35:45] and you know use less power I mean I get it that makes sense to be I just don't I mean but I have

[35:51] them in my house and I don't have them on 24 seven and I'm not operating games so okay so it's my

[35:58] choice and why would I want to spend $300 per game to get some ridiculously expensive LED set right

[36:07] so do you think American pinballs new home pin who knows when they're gonna ship thunderbirds

[36:13] do you think anyone out there at this stage is like let's also jump into the ring and become a

[36:20] pinball company another manufacturer I don't think so I think it's a lot of people that probably

[36:26] would like to but I don't think anybody's willing to take that step of trepidation based on some

[36:33] of the mistakes that have been made in the last three years I mean there are people that really

[36:37] were like oh I can do this and they're like oh oh I mean you have silver castle pinball that's

[36:42] still doing development of time shot I don't know when they're gonna release a prototype I don't

[36:49] know if they're gonna bring it to Texas I don't even know if it'll be like that game's not even on

[36:53] my radar we didn't even talk about that yeah most people are not aware I mean I I was fortunate enough

[36:58] on that well if you if you're guys are if the listeners are curious because I kind of I'm kind

[37:03] of like slightly inside this this track with jargon who's one of the primary designers

[37:09] him and his team from Holland they started this project after Adrian started their kickstarter

[37:17] back oh my god it's probably five in five years now they did their kickstarter campaign to

[37:22] remake propimbal time shock as a digital version and then when they did that though they had the

[37:28] Adrian was part of the original empire interactive team that made the original game back

[37:33] in 1999 yeah that's how old it is and they used but he had the same code so they already had

[37:41] the code and the sounds and the music and everything or the dot matrix display animations were already

[37:47] but they obviously have a physical game so they they talked to Adrian and they said well this is

[37:52] with his dream and so he ended up getting an engineer and some artists and he started doing the

[37:58] design and you know it's been under designer ever since they got Dennis Norton involved for a while

[38:03] I don't know if he's still involved in the project but ultimately in 2016 they had finalized

[38:10] the artwork because basically the artwork on the playfield was the original game anyway just kind of

[38:15] got souped up and they read it you know they did artwork for the cabinet and the back glass

[38:21] image was fairly similar and they finalized it I was fortunate enough to be an owner of one of the

[38:27] three prototype translates for that game so I was able to get one on my wall so I'm still waiting

[38:34] but basically their goal and they recently had a new year teaser again and they showed the

[38:40] the updating of the artwork this just sound familiar reminds me of the art work teasing but they

[38:47] up to the point they didn't have a functional game because they had an actual game that worked as

[38:51] a prototype you know more than the classic you know paper mishay ramps turned in the plastic kind of

[38:57] thing but their main problem is the game has a time crystal in the center and it rotates so it's

[39:02] like a combination between a judge dread dead world and a Indiana Jones idle lock okay so it

[39:10] has to shoot balls vertically and it also has to keep them in a crystal and that particular assembly

[39:16] is kind of complicated and it obviously didn't exist in real life so they have not been able to

[39:22] get that to work correctly at least up to the point with the current coding therefore they

[39:27] uh you know it didn't finish the prototype so their plan was to have it prototyped and brought

[39:33] to the show this year with the potential being able to start building the game in 2018 that was

[39:40] the plan and that's still the plan so far I mean I I don't I mean it's one of those things

[39:47] for 11 years later oh it's insane well the conception of the game was like 20 or not

[39:54] in games but remember this is one of those things like a lot of people do it's almost at a level of

[40:00] homebrew you know will it happen I can tell you that you know if if they actually build a game I'll

[40:05] probably like fly to hall and pick it up and fly it back with me because I don't like I'm not

[40:10] going to pay him money if I don't like have the game in my hand you know my saying you know it's

[40:15] better you than box that I'm taking it back with me you know so yeah so yeah there were there is

[40:20] a potential for you know you still talked about p3 but you know once again that's floating around

[40:25] and you know we wish in the best and I think I think he waited too long I mean it's getting

[40:33] dated now it's problematic well he needs another he needs a he he looks he needs a license theme

[40:40] to move it and he does definitely some that kind of get that influx injection into his platform that

[40:45] that would help him for sure he needs it you it's and every time you know and I and Jerry's a great

[40:51] guy and I see him at the show and he always pulls me to size like you know Chris is not about Lexi

[40:56] lightspeed it's a platform I'm like yeah but dude that's all people know that's all people remember I

[41:02] mean well because that was a game you know and then you got the the simple games for the kids but

[41:07] you know when we when we talk about like hype works and if you show something and you don't

[41:13] deliver it every day you feel deliver the hype seeds and that's why like Andrew's having a hard

[41:20] time selling out alien L.E. is because he showed so much of it along the way that it's like by the

[41:26] time it comes out it's like the Acura NSX it's not selling because we've seen it for four years now

[41:32] and by the time it's yeah the Pimble industry is like a balloon it inflates and it deflates and if

[41:38] you don't if you don't catch it on the inflation that means you're not going to sell your games go

[41:43] talk to anybody that any any single member of the management of stern pinball that has around

[41:50] for ballian Williams in the days of those days holy or or data east they will I mean there's not

[41:58] many people left on the management staff that were actually part of that process and I'll tell you

[42:05] they knew they that their times I mean that they they things were tight you know because you know

[42:13] they it's like hey you know we got a time crunch you got to get this thing out now you know and

[42:19] otherwise you know we're gonna lose we're gonna lose the ability to make sales because every day

[42:23] we dot all we lose money right so it's like any other industry the only difference is it's just

[42:30] freaking small right it's just not big enough to sustain large amounts of of volume at its

[42:38] current moment there's plenty of feeding frenzy but that dies really fast I mean people right now

[42:44] are like pinball X-Foot 2016 what was that oh no well I mean yes you got a guys like Jerry must

[42:52] just be like what the fuck I'm trying to innovate I'm trying to do and then stern just put some

[42:58] cheap five dollar toys on a batman and basically takes a game that was pretty much already

[43:06] are indeed for them yeah and and charges 10,000 more than they then they then the dark night game

[43:14] cause and and it didn't have a visit class or it didn't have anything innovative really I mean

[43:20] the neck is the neck is cool but I you know it's a big mech I it's not the most innovating thing

[43:24] I've ever seen enough as an innovator they've used that has been used in other games of the

[43:29] three way the three way turn I forget which game right used it well you know Gilgames Island

[43:35] there it is Gilgames Island he's slaving away and then these guys are making you know a million

[43:43] dollars overnight selling 80 of these things where you know the profit margin on an SL is is

[43:49] tremendous and it's because sometimes I think people a lot of marketing is frothing I mean that's

[43:55] part of it too I mean what's what's Jerry's marketing ability in terms of costs what does he have

[44:00] available to do he doesn't have to say I need to be able to do that I said it with home pin it's like

[44:06] people fail to realize the value of market research until they enter the market and then they

[44:12] then they understand the value of market research immediately when they go out of business

[44:16] because well half the companies are trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist so if you did your

[44:21] market research you know you you can't really show that like swappable playfields is a solution

[44:28] no that doesn't work it's just like a clone you know like when games when they did they did

[44:35] the famous swapping out of games even in the 80s you know when they did when they did the the

[44:42] kits the conversion kits they just weren't popular and you know and then of course you know it tried

[44:48] with pinball 2000 there's other examples other than pinball 2000 but it never worked because

[44:55] you know from a collector standpoint nobody wants to swap playfields no they they want they want

[45:01] a game and then you know if you're if your space constrained as a collector you're I mean it's

[45:07] just too much trouble that you know it's just a pain in the butt I mean you can do it it's not

[45:12] that hard but it just does work you have you have you have like new companies new to the market that

[45:19] do something that's proven to never work so to me that's like that's just bad business and then you

[45:24] also have like companies out here who come out with themes that nobody wants nobody wants you're it's

[45:30] like what are you doing it's definitely a tough sell I am not I don't quite understand I mean

[45:36] once again I'm not a market research guy I'm a more of a market seller kind of evaluating kind of

[45:42] guys so you're right I mean it's you have to have something that grabs you I mean it I think back

[45:49] to the 90s because you know I guess I'm like a 90s child I'm not like a 70s flower child but I'm

[45:54] like a 90s child where I think about all the original theme games that were produced and

[46:01] they all had something to try to some something to grab on to even though it wasn't a license

[46:08] theme something that was unique or different and and it's hard to do today it really is I mean

[46:14] because you know whether you have a lot of choices but that's it that I mean new games are still

[46:19] competing with use games and I don't mean just in the last 15 years we know that your tales from

[46:26] the Arabianites will compete against Jersey Jack styled in oh yeah and he will do equal if not

[46:33] better and its price is probably the same as a standard addition and I and I also think for a lot

[46:39] of people out there it's much harder to let go of your nice tales of the Arabianites then it is

[46:45] to put your Wizard of Oz up for sale yeah that one's a tough sale these days that people don't

[46:50] realize that all those different additions who yeah they're like crap I mean obviously the

[46:56] the best price back in the day was the 6500 but they they don't sell they sit Emerald Edition Ruby

[47:03] Red I mean they all sit and nobody wants to buy him because you know it's like well why not

[47:08] just buy a new one right and every collector out there always thinks how hard will it be for me

[47:15] to get this back so if I let this go out into the world and sometimes that's true though I mean

[47:22] sometimes that's true but that's not one of them right I mean if I if I sold my just a link of

[47:28] joke but if I had to sell my punchy the clown okay I probably have a hard time getting it back now

[47:34] some people argue well why would you want it back right so I would argue that I've been talking to

[47:40] people about magic girl like and if it comes out what it'll be worth and and you know regardless

[47:45] of like what would shape the code is in because it's probably going to be a mess right it's the

[47:50] game's going to be clunky and not cohesive I mean I think everyone probably agrees on that but it

[47:55] is a day if there's only 19 or 20 right how are you if you good good luck finding another one I mean

[48:04] I say that too as I look on eBay Christ there's a big bang bar inbox one of the ones

[48:09] you're talking about there for two years I know he lowered the price he lowered the price five

[48:14] grand it was it was 30,000 last year yeah but he's going to keep it at 25 for another year or more

[48:20] because he's just waiting for the market he's been offered plenty of offers and he's refused

[48:25] I know a little bit about that game because it's been sitting on eBay for so goddamn long I mean

[48:30] he when he bought that game in 2000 or he got the game in 2007 and kept it in the box in the

[48:37] corner you know initially was going to keep it and then he'd started speculating with it and

[48:43] well now it's like going on 20 years or whatever 10 12 years ago basically he's speculated ever

[48:50] since and he keeps the bar higher than the speculation of the market and the economy in hopes that

[48:55] somebody will buy the machine and so he keeps adjusting the value and the court and city the

[49:02] economy he keeps upping it so you know in two years so it'll be clear it'll be back up to 30,000

[49:08] if nobody buys it for 25 it's funny but in the listing he says probably the worst thing you ever

[49:16] would want to say to sell a game for $25,000 he writes by the way this item could be remanufactured

[49:23] at any time by those companies that have we wish but we know that's not going to happen

[49:29] anytime soon if this listing helps make that remanufacture happen then that is great for the

[49:34] pinball community but that's I don't understand that comment at all it makes it counterproductive

[49:41] well it's like I mean it's just like we do you talked about the whole pps shenanigan with like

[49:46] attack from ours I mean here's my take if you're curious on that that's another relevancy to 2017

[49:52] yeah he made a smart move not to release make the release statement why because the market couldn't bear

[49:57] it if he can't we'll go back again how many machines is he going to be able to sell if he sells less

[50:05] than 500 attack from Mars remakes is he going to make his money back will he make a profit no he will

[50:10] not so it makes no sense because he's competing against the new titles yeah I don't think the game's

[50:16] going to work it's just weird I don't think it's going to work like I don't know people want it like

[50:20] they want new stuff you know you don't need to buy an original for $6,000 and a and an excellent

[50:26] plus condition yeah he their whole strategy seems sound for four four five years ago or three

[50:34] yeah but nobody wants to wait two years that's the other reason well they hear it oh yeah well

[50:39] you will already will give it to you in two years you just have to wait two years until it's ready no

[50:43] that ain't going to work either because there's no patience they they've fumbled yeah they've

[50:47] fumbled mm I mean the right now he is just question marks it will it told me that he's he's preparing

[50:55] at some point down the road to build bang big bang bar and I laughed I said no he really did tell me

[51:00] that like really personally and I said you know that's great right Rick I look forward to it is it

[51:07] going to have original parts in it because if it doesn't and it's not like IPB I don't want it

[51:13] right I don't want if he was smart again market research make kingpin make king calm yes that is a

[51:21] more viable title I mean I agree it's more desirable and I mean some people said cact is can

[51:26] but the problem with that is that that's kind of a niche game too we're getting kind of like off to

[51:31] the side on some other individual games but yeah there are if you do the market research there definitely

[51:36] is a market for certain type of remake pins not may not cater to my needs but you know for the

[51:42] individual collector that's breaking into the market and can't find an example and you know the

[51:47] condition they want and if they were able to get it at a price value that's equitable right

[51:53] i.e. 55 you know 55 to $6500 not 85 to $9000 then speed would be a feasible deal but that probably

[52:02] isn't possible with the production runs are under a thousand units right it also like it's

[52:07] counterproductive to what makes the game special because if like a game like cactus canyon

[52:13] it's special because it's like the last game it was low volume it it was like the end of an error

[52:20] it was the last DMD game of Williams and Valley and you know and you know right what made even more

[52:27] you know cactus canyon continues with the corrections of the code kind of gave it its own legacy

[52:33] you know and if you just mass produce it again good luck you you've you've you've destroyed it

[52:40] it makes it special so i think if they're like the story and what the hell i know i know you're

[52:45] you're having it involves don't destroy the image of the past in a creation of them you do you

[52:50] sell like me we don't need it we just don't need it and i think what happens is if you look at the

[52:55] climate now everyone's looking to the president of future and they are looking to the past and they

[53:02] and there are but there are so many good versions of games that are obtainable for a good price

[53:08] why go through the effort to re manufacture it it sounds like you're getting your wings Chris

[53:18] i just want to see people make the smart business decisions because it will help the

[53:24] hobby yeah it's a samsie that's the whole point i mean every single stupid decision that a

[53:30] manufacturer makes that hurts the industry hurts the market it just happens that way i mean

[53:37] it's just like pricing it isn't about the price it's about what you're getting for the price and

[53:43] if it isn't what people are expecting i eat the hype okay still get disappointed they get turned

[53:49] off they aren't happy about it and some of them say you know i'm not going to buy your games anymore

[53:54] well i think that totally happens to this little search there's all sorts of those little

[53:58] nuances and when you do that you cannot build the hype up so high that it's like a balloon ready

[54:03] to pop no and in a in a hobby where the end product is a toy that's supposed to bring joy

[54:10] if if the process brings headache and anxiety and sleepless nights tears it does i mean for so

[54:18] many people it's it and they reach that point where they're just like if i want to be happy in my

[54:24] life i have to get rid of the pinball part of it because the the train they're on uh and you know

[54:31] you saw like the mmr guys two many years two years and then they you know god forbid they got a

[54:38] play filled with you know with that those ink issues when they're the black ink was in working

[54:43] there they were pesty you know what they have a right to be pissed away that's a shit it look like

[54:47] i mean i i i don't think that's acceptable i mean i think that that's i mean that is unexcusable

[54:52] it's just like it most of the things that i mean it's sort of like the whole you know we

[54:58] joked a long time ago about things like the clear codish i still laugh about that only be not

[55:03] anything to do with kpgs thing that you were talking about with their i i told him good luck you

[55:08] know my post was good luck you know they we you know you know stern will change their warranty policy

[55:14] you know for consumers in the future based on your efforts or whatever but i also know that other

[55:20] people got their playfields so okay they say they singled him out and you know he i don't know

[55:27] i mean i don't wish the guy ill will i don't think stern but stern read inside they read

[55:34] inside and they blacklist people who don't give them a chance to do the right thing and

[55:40] to stern normally does the right thing now like i said in the last podcast it doesn't you know it

[55:47] doesn't matter stern needs to fix the guys playfield at the end of the day yeah like i mean just do

[55:51] it i mean you've got this one guy who's leading a revolution against your company's reputation

[55:56] well they that's because the world is so small and i tell people at all the time i mean people

[56:03] it's even in the hobby as a collector be careful what you know they said on i saw that and i

[56:09] stopped reading obviously like drain but you know that if you burn bridges in this hobby you're in

[56:15] trouble because everybody knows everybody and and if you've got a bad name out on this hobby you're

[56:22] going to have problems to find parts you're going to have problems to help find somebody to fix

[56:26] your machine i mean your board probably if you need boards repaired i mean people will go i

[56:32] sorry i don't i'm too busy i mean it's it's really small and you know and

[56:40] hey you know i'm not saying it was like but stern but but stern's the one

[56:45] see stern doesn't mind burning consumers because they can throw everything

[56:52] all right now they well they that that's fine but like i said when the time comes and the and the

[56:58] tides turn they may regret some but because they've alienated they did a wonderful job but like

[57:04] i said it alienating older collectors in regards to the fiasco with batman 66 and their 30 of

[57:10] anniversary party in a very short amount of time yeah i mean i was just incredible i mean all the

[57:16] old clikers are like what i mean it was like you what not granted you don't need to say it 80

[57:22] million times but i mean it it's you know like i think i'm blacklisted for like stern's Facebook

[57:28] page because i said something i asked a question that they didn't want to answer but

[57:32] but they do that everybody i mean you like you say anything that's like well i don't like that

[57:37] it's negative block them you know i yeah it's you know the world of free speech hey you know

[57:41] it's stern's Facebook page they can do whatever they want yeah okay i don't i'm not i'm not here

[57:47] to bad master my main concern as you know and i will repeat this because i think it's very important

[57:52] is if they continue to reduce features on games not necessarily the game design but the basic features

[58:02] of games and they raise the prices what are they doing they're trying to get away with doing i mean

[58:11] somebody recommended hey we need to get rid of coin doors they're useless we don't need coin

[58:17] mechs that that's what mmr did they didn't ship with coin mechs in the game right okay they did

[58:23] that they said well there's it's irrelevant the games still haven't there's no use for coin door

[58:29] it should be like beautiful with nice art on it what okay so you basically invalidated every single

[58:35] operator because you think that only thing that pinball should be made for his home market see that

[58:42] that kind of stuff is bad because it has very terrible consequences because there's a standard

[58:48] like vision of what a pinball is and is not right there's a coin door on magic girl right

[58:55] well right i mean there's really i mean pinball itself let's think about it how many i mean this is

[59:00] always one of those funny moments i know this is probably get long-winded because i see the clock time

[59:04] isn't i everybody's enjoying this but you know it's like you know what is pinball you know well it's

[59:10] not any m anymore so that means that the cabinet in the lower half is empty except for a spasker and

[59:17] maybe a coin you know a coin box and some other various wiring but not much especially with spike

[59:23] okay so what's the back box well that's you know where they're originally the artwork was now but

[59:27] now it's held by an LCD screen and the boards are smaller and basically they're one border in some

[59:35] cases so it doesn't have a whole lot of use except for the speakers and a display they they got

[59:41] rid of the back classes and now they use LCD screen so when you turn the game off it's completely

[59:46] black so there's the advertisement there when the game's off all right so that I mean what's the

[59:52] point of that right i mean you might as well just do away the back box right no i mean i'm not i'm

[59:57] making facetious arguments but that the point is it's like you got to have two flipper buttons

[01:00:02] you know it's got to have legs i mean so when you look at a pinball machine you have that kind of

[01:00:06] vision of what it so that's the limitations that many factors have because there's that nostalgia

[01:00:12] see that's what brings people bad that's what the whole cool thing is i'm looking at something that

[01:00:19] looks like it should should yeah and it looks like it should be in an arcade but it's in my home

[01:00:25] right it's cool yeah yeah i want to see twenty twenty five cents push to eject you know

[01:00:32] well Chris thank you so much i mean i know we went long um but you know what you can never go too

[01:00:38] long when you're spitting truth like this uh over now i'm hopefully people had fun because

[01:00:42] this one was more fun than others because i really did try to put a real positive spin on it

[01:00:46] and we're gonna i'll probably break it up into two so people will probably be hearing the end

[01:00:51] of the second chapter which would be great it's a long weekend for most people so they'll enjoy that

[01:00:57] and you know i think any closing remarks you want to make Chris as we i think we covered a lot

[01:01:04] and giving people a lot of good advice and and and how to approach the hobby and also

[01:01:09] where we think the hobby is going i think this is all been like really great information i guess on

[01:01:14] this this interview i would say this much if if if you feel that you're you're no longer able to

[01:01:21] be a part of the hobby because of the increasing costs by the new manufacturers look to the past

[01:01:28] look to games that you wouldn't necessarily anticipate go back to the e-m's go back to the

[01:01:34] wood rails dealers are bringing these things out of warehouses because now they feel they might

[01:01:40] be able to make a little bit of money on them so you can sometimes find still a great game that will

[01:01:46] be incredibly entertaining for yourself or your family and it will not cost you eight thousand

[01:01:51] dollars it probably not even cut it might even cost you a thousand bucks right you can do it you can

[01:01:56] get one for five hundred dollars and it will work so don't give up hope based on what you're seeing

[01:02:02] with like this whole market and it's basically gonna price a just you know look to the past there

[01:02:08] are other options as long as you stay away from the hype well there you have it listener there is

[01:02:15] hope in the past probably more hope than there is in the future with what we've what we're seeing

[01:02:21] going on well Chris thank you so much for joining us and um have a happy long weekend and we'll talk

[01:02:29] again soon all right keep flipping all right and there we have it ladies and gentlemen i hope you

[01:02:35] enjoyed that interview i think there's a lot a lot of important pieces of information we can

[01:02:42] all learn from to ultimately just make the hobby more fun and more enjoyable really i mean it's

[01:02:48] it's such a good hobby and you can focus on all the wrong areas and get overwhelmed by it and i

[01:02:54] think if i have learned anything over the last year it's just get off the hype train once you get

[01:03:00] off the hype train man you're on that other train which lets you just enjoy pinball and stops worrying

[01:03:07] about having these like special versions of limited games aren't really limited that they make

[01:03:13] hundreds if not thousands of so that's it we're gonna hit stop and we're gonna be back again

[01:03:21] this week with more of canada's pinball podcast
