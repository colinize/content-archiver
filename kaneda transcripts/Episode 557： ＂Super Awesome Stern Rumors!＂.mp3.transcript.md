[00:00] I got a natural skill but I didn't think the Lord

[00:02] Cause I feel blessed, I'm casually dressed

[00:04] I always got my gun but I never wear the best

[00:07] Quick call in the drawer like the whole name of the cooler

[00:09] From the cartoon boom shall I rock

[00:11] Oh shall I rock oh

[00:13] All right, got it long

[00:14] Shall I rock oh, never mind

[00:19] Ah, it's happening again out in the pinball world right now

[00:23] People are doing stories and they won't say the name canada

[00:26] I keep listening to all my friends shows out there in the world

[00:30] And when they want to say something about someone saying something about canada

[00:34] They can't say the name they'll say like oh this other show

[00:38] Or David Fix came on and was pinpointing one pinball podcaster

[00:42] It was me boys

[00:44] It was canada David Fix was talking about

[00:46] It's me that the super awesome pinball show won't mention my name

[00:51] Christopher Fransche I got nothing but love for you brother

[00:54] But here's the thing if you're having fun

[00:57] And you're having a good time doing your show

[00:59] Then why did you ban canada from your Facebook page man

[01:03] Don't be a coward we're just grown men talking about pinball

[01:07] And I'm about to drop it right now in just a few minutes

[01:10] We're gonna give you guys a stern rumor

[01:14] That they're not gonna want you to hear

[01:16] I don't need two and a half hours to talk about pinball

[01:20] I don't need an hour and a half to discuss pinball

[01:24] We're just gonna give you the rumors news and speculation that you want to hear

[01:28] And we can do it in 15 minutes or less

[01:30] And then you can go about your day

[01:33] Doing this stuff you should be doing as a grown adult

[01:36] And not listening to pinball podcasts that are as long

[01:39] As the Lord of the Rings films okay

[01:42] I know that upset some people

[01:44] And I want to say that I've been making fun of long pinball podcast

[01:48] Well before anyone over at super awesome pinball show even picked up a microphone

[01:53] So it's not personal it's not a personal attack

[01:56] I'm just tell you that you can get your pinball news rumors and speculation

[02:00] In much less than one hour

[02:03] Okay so I'm just having a little fun

[02:04] I'm always having fun on this show

[02:06] But I do find it funny how people cannot say the name canada

[02:10] It just ruins their ratings on their shows

[02:13] I sound like macho there right now

[02:14] Where's macho how did macho not get a nominee for a nomination for a recipient award

[02:21] Of the industry awards okay you don't want to hear canada go off like this

[02:24] It's early in the morning

[02:25] It's early in the morning I just want to give you the fun stuff right now

[02:27] So I'm hearing from my little birdie source

[02:30] Now I have some people that feed me information

[02:32] And this person is usually pretty accurate

[02:36] But I want you to listen to this and take it with a grain of salt

[02:39] But I think there's some validation

[02:42] To what you're about to hear in these rumors

[02:44] Because here is what I'm hearing

[02:46] And this is the kind of podcasts that Stern doesn't want you to hear

[02:49] This is the kind of podcast that would upset them if any of this is accurate

[02:54] Because you know Stern they got to protect their license holders

[02:57] They got to do everything they can to protect their relationship

[03:01] With those properties

[03:03] The one thing they don't do is they don't put everything they can into their damn pinball machines

[03:08] And people are starting to realize this more and more

[03:12] People are starting to start threads that said if you have a dream theme

[03:17] The last company you would want to make it is Stern pinball

[03:21] Everyone wants a p to turn a corner

[03:24] Everybody wants Jersey Jack to make their dream theme

[03:27] And everyone would rather have Chicago gaming company

[03:30] Stern wake up

[03:31] We love you Stern

[03:32] We do love you

[03:34] We are very thankful you saved pinball all of these years

[03:38] But we want you to put more into these games at these prices

[03:42] You basically are fleecing us all

[03:45] And you know it

[03:46] You know it I don't need Gary Stern to come on here

[03:49] And justify thousand dollar toppers like I don't understand

[03:54] Gary we get it

[03:55] You're a multi-millionaire because of these things

[03:59] You and the investors over at Stern have made so much money

[04:03] But I'm not an investor

[04:05] I'm a customer and you can do better

[04:07] Okay so here are the three rumors I have for Stern pinball

[04:12] And then I'm gonna get off the mic and I'm gonna prove

[04:15] Like less than ten minutes

[04:16] Canate is gonna drop some heat and you don't need two and a half hours

[04:21] Oh what just just part one

[04:23] Part two is coming next five hours of Roger Sharp people

[04:27] Okay here we go

[04:28] Oh I'm talking a little bit of smack

[04:30] I know I'm not doing personal attacks

[04:32] I'm taking the high road as we get to the end of January

[04:34] So here we go

[04:36] Rumor number one

[04:37] The rumor that Stern pinball is working on James Bond

[04:41] I keep hearing is accurate

[04:43] Now what we don't know is where the game is and who's working on it

[04:48] And why the game is not out yet

[04:50] So here is the rumor I'm hearing

[04:52] That Steve Richie is working on a James Bond game

[04:56] It will be based on the new James Bond movie

[05:00] No time to die

[05:02] Okay

[05:03] Who's got time to die when Steve Richie is working on a James Bond pinball machine

[05:09] So this is the new film in the James Bond franchise

[05:12] And it was delayed

[05:14] So since COVID has delayed the movie release

[05:17] And the theatrical release of this new movie

[05:20] Does that mean that Stern pinball's James Bond game is also being delayed

[05:24] And has Steve Richie been working on James Bond for a while

[05:27] Because we've been hearing James Bond as a rumored theme

[05:30] For quite some time and we know

[05:33] That Stern pinball can work on multiple games at once

[05:36] We know that these designers can work on multiple games at once

[05:40] And when we look at Led Zeppelin

[05:42] It doesn't look like much work went on in Led Zeppelin at all

[05:46] You can't tell me Steve Richie took a very long time to design Led Zeppelin

[05:50] So maybe the reason why Led Zeppelin is so damn barren

[05:54] Is that he's been applying most of his efforts to James Bond?

[05:57] Is this rumor going to be true?

[05:59] And I'm gonna tell you right now

[06:01] It's just the rumor people

[06:02] So don't do your shows about how Canadian is always wrong

[06:05] And you're always right

[06:06] Okay? Because this is more exciting

[06:08] This is more fun

[06:09] And it's gonna be over in less than 10 minutes

[06:12] And the next rumor is this

[06:14] I am hearing that Stern is possibly going to re-release Ghostbusters

[06:20] To coincide with the new film coming out

[06:23] Now I'm not sure if this rumor is gonna be true or not

[06:27] But let's think about this one

[06:29] Ghostbusters was an extremely great selling pin for Stern

[06:34] Currently there are no Ghostbusters available

[06:37] It's still a very hot property

[06:40] I still think the game shoots a trotious

[06:42] You know why I don't like it

[06:43] I hate the flipper gap

[06:44] I always feel like I'm holding on for dear life when I play that game

[06:48] But Ghostbusters toppers are selling for like $1,000 or $2 now

[06:53] And so will Stern come out with a new

[06:56] Zambietti art package Ghostbusters like a vault edition

[07:00] When the new film comes out

[07:02] That film also was delayed until 2021

[07:06] I'm not sure about that but it would be easy for Stern to rerun Ghostbusters

[07:10] So if you're in the market for a Ghostbusters

[07:13] You might want to wait a little bit and see if this rumor comes true

[07:16] Okay

[07:17] The final rumor in this Canadian Spinball Podcast

[07:21] Having fun on a Tuesday morning with a broken bathroom

[07:26] Is this

[07:27] Here is the final thing I'm hearing that Brian Eddie's next game

[07:30] The man who's responsible for some of the greatest pimp ball machines of all time

[07:34] The man who came back after all these years

[07:37] And sort of underwhelmed us with stranger things

[07:40] I'm hearing the rumor is don't sue me people

[07:44] This is just a rumor

[07:45] Is that Brian Eddie is working on

[07:48] Or was working on he might not still be working on it

[07:52] But Brian Eddie was working on Harry Potter for Stern Pimp ball

[07:58] This theme gets tossed around in the Pimp ball community

[08:02] More than any other theme

[08:03] It is also a theme that everybody wants Jersey Jack to make and not Stern

[08:09] But this could be a moment for Stern to shut all of us up

[08:14] And I mean that

[08:15] And I think Stern I know they listened to this podcast

[08:18] I know they're listening to this podcast

[08:20] I know they're listening right now

[08:22] The final criticism of Stern Pimp ball is they don't put enough of a world under glass

[08:27] In the machines

[08:28] They don't put enough mechanisms

[08:30] They don't bring a physical world to life

[08:32] They rely on art and code

[08:35] And the rest of it is pretty pedestrian

[08:37] Every once in a while we get a decent mech

[08:39] But even the most recent releases haven't been anywhere near as cool as Ghostbusters

[08:43] Is world under glass

[08:44] So this could be a moment

[08:46] In which Stern Pimp ball lets Brian Eddie do his thing

[08:50] And lets Brian Eddie create the world

[08:52] The magical world of Harry Potter

[08:54] Which is a theme that begs

[08:56] For so much magic under the glass

[08:58] You know it's magic

[08:59] Like there's so much cool stuff in that franchise

[09:02] You can't just have the mailed in

[09:04] Just a few things in the game

[09:06] And everything else is plastic

[09:07] And nothing interacts with the ball in a magical way

[09:10] You can't have that with Harry Potter

[09:12] It's not the way you can do it

[09:13] So I do think that 2021 is going to be a year in which Stern Pimp ball has a chance to flex

[09:21] And show everybody what they're about

[09:24] And I hope they do it

[09:25] I know I rag on them

[09:27] I know I make fun of them

[09:28] But there is no way with the amount of money they've made

[09:31] With the amount of like revenue and talent inside the walls of Stern Pimp ball

[09:37] There is no way they can look at a game like Guns and Roses

[09:40] And they can't get into a room

[09:42] And say we can do this

[09:44] We can do this Gary

[09:46] We can do this George

[09:46] We can do this investors

[09:48] Stop making us design to this cheap bomb

[09:52] These consumers will spend the money

[09:54] We could sell $12,000 Stern Harry Potter machines

[09:58] If it's loaded

[09:59] So let us load it up

[10:01] The days of Stern continuing to make these games at $3,000 bombs

[10:06] And then doubling and tripling the price of these games

[10:09] We can see right through it all

[10:10] We can see right through it all

[10:11] And it's embarrassing when you see a $9,200 lead Zeppelin

[10:14] You know it's embarrassing

[10:16] It's embarrassing to put that game next to Guns and Roses

[10:18] It would be laughed out of the room if you put it next to Guns and Roses

[10:21] And Stern Pimp ball's people

[10:22] It's not because of a lack of talent

[10:24] It is not because of a lack of passion

[10:26] So I hope in 2021 some of these rumors come true

[10:30] And they flex their muscle

[10:32] And they show us what they can fully do

[10:34] In terms of bringing the greatest worlds under glass to life in Pimp ball form

[10:39] And the last thing I want to say because I'm a little over 10 minutes

[10:42] I'm breaking my own rule

[10:43] Is that the Godzilla license

[10:45] That is the movie is the Warner Brothers

[10:47] A Godzilla fan correcting me

[10:49] I want to get him on the show to talk all about Godzilla Geekdom

[10:52] But apparently I was wrong too

[10:54] Because Godzilla and King Kong are not enemies

[10:59] What is probably happening in that trailer I was told is that's mega Godzilla

[11:04] Attacking ships to make King Kong confused

[11:08] To think it's Godzilla to get King Kong to fight Godzilla

[11:12] But then they're both going to realize the real enemy is mega Godzilla

[11:16] And they got a team up together to fight mega Godzilla

[11:20] Do I sound like the biggest loser on planet earth right now?

[11:23] I do and I am

[11:24] And I am the biggest loser

[11:26] With the number one Pimp ball podcast right now

[11:28] Now that might not last and people might get upset when I say that

[11:32] But I got nothing but love for you guys out there in the Pimp ball media

[11:35] Come on why can't you just say my name?

[11:37] Why can't we just get along again?

[11:39] I'm friends with everybody who just talks to me

[11:42] You don't have to ban me

[11:43] You don't have the silence canada

[11:45] We're all here having fun talking about Pimp ball

[11:48] If you want to take this hobby so seriously

[11:51] If you want to treat these people in the industry like they're gods

[11:54] Like interviewing them is so precious

[11:56] And we're delivering this and we're not going to talk about his name

[12:00] And what he says about Pimp ball

[12:01] Get over yourselves everybody

[12:03] We're all in this just to have fun talking about

[12:05] A stupid toy that is so overpriced

[12:08] It's ridiculous

[12:09] The average American doesn't even have $500 for an emergency bill

[12:14] And we're here debating

[12:16] Five to $13,000 Pimp ball machines

[12:19] And everyone says they're having fun

[12:21] But man we're having fun over here on canada's Pimp ball podcast
