[00:00] Alright, club members, if you've ever wondered why you're a member of the Canadian Club, because

[00:04] I will give you the scoops, I will give you the rumors, just put the six Twippy in the

[00:09] bag people, this is probably, if it's true, the greatest scoop I've ever had on Canadian

[00:15] Pinball Podcast, and this is going to be the biggest shockwave, I think, in the history

[00:20] of pinball launches, if this comes true.

[00:23] So here's what I'm hearing, are you sitting down, ladies and gentlemen?

[00:27] As we know, James Bond Pinball is going to have a pro, a premium, and an LE, and George

[00:34] Gomez has alluded to a mystery surprise that is going to come out when this game launches.

[00:41] Are you sitting down?

[00:42] Are you ready?

[00:43] Now make sure when you take this information to Pinside, you say, Canada is reporting,

[00:50] and he is asking for your Twippy vote, are you ready for it?

[00:53] So the mystery version of James Bond is going to be a pinball machine based on the 60th

[01:02] anniversary of James Bond, and it is a completely different game from the George Gomez game,

[01:11] and it is being designed by Keith Elwyn.

[01:16] Let me repeat that, Keith Elwyn is designing a special version of James Bond, and here

[01:23] is how it's going to work.

[01:25] It's not going to be limited, what Stern is going to do is this, it is going to be made

[01:30] to order, and they are going to let the distributors set the price of the game.

[01:36] I don't even know how you begin to price this thing, I don't even know what this means,

[01:42] like if it's not limited, I don't know what the heck is going on, but you are hearing

[01:47] this first, from Canada, that Keith Elwyn is designing a fourth version of James Bond,

[01:55] go take it to the interwebs, this is why you sign up for the Canada club, and you go tell

[02:00] those Pinside babies that even though it just says Doctor No on the translate, that people

[02:06] can just walk up and realize it's James Bond.

[02:09] I think the art package on these three games might be hideous, but maybe the Keith Elwyn

[02:15] game is going to look a lot better, and maybe all three of these are just Trojan horses

[02:20] to get us to buy the Keith Elwyn version of the game.

[02:24] Everybody, I don't even know what to make of this, I've never seen this before, this

[02:27] is absolutely crazy, either Canada is crazy and being trolled really hard, or I think

[02:33] this is true, I'm getting this from a very reliable source, Keith Elwyn, James Bond,

[02:39] run with it, thank you for your support, I love each and every one of you, later.
