[00:00] I tried to tell everybody that the popularity of guns and roses is bigger than you realize,

[00:20] and the popularity within Pimball of Eric Minier and his games was gonna be bigger than

[00:25] you realize and put those two entities together. And I think everyone realizes right now what I've

[00:31] been saying for a few months and that this pin is special, it's unique, and you're probably never

[00:37] going to see another Pimball machine like this ever again. And I think everyone's starting to come

[00:42] around to that, like whether or not you like guns and roses, you're gonna want this machine. Now

[00:46] here's the problem. I've been telling people for months that you're gonna want to get a collector's

[00:52] edition of guns and roses, get on your distributor list, get ready to pull the trigger on the collector's

[00:58] edition. So I did my job and many of you did your job and you lined up to get this game only to realize

[01:06] that the way this game was solved this week is highly, and I mean this highly problematic for all

[01:13] involved. And there has been a big mess up here and it's unfortunate and I want to go down a list of

[01:20] the reasons I think this thing went awry when it came to trying to get a collector's edition of

[01:25] the game. So for those of you who don't know what's been going on real quickly, there are 500

[01:31] collector's editions of guns and roses available to the world. There is 100 million guns and roses

[01:37] album sold globally. So just start doing the math there. GNR is a global phenomenon. I mean they're

[01:44] huge everywhere, not just in America, they're big in Australia, Brazil, Latin America,

[01:49] you name it guns and roses fans are everywhere. Okay. So there was always going to be, there was

[01:55] always going to be way more demand for a guns and roses collector's edition than supply. So you

[02:01] have to start out with that and I knew that would happen. The marketer and me just knew there would

[02:05] be way more demand than supply. So they were never going to be able to satisfy everybody with only

[02:12] 500 units. And for those of you out there just saying well they should just make more, they should

[02:16] just keep making them and printing them. No, no, no, that's what the Ellie is. You know every once in

[02:22] a while it's okay for a brand like Dodge to say we're only going to make 3000 demons in the United

[02:28] States. That's all we're going to make. That's no more no less 3000 units and that's it. And it

[02:34] creates a level of like hype and demand for that version of the car. Everyone else can go get a

[02:41] red eye which is basically the same car as a demon. It's pretty much just as fast. The same way

[02:46] the Ellie is pretty much the same exact game as the collector's edition. You know minus that little

[02:51] ball lock on the apron of the game. But for the most part, you know this is meant for the diehard

[02:57] collector, the die hard guns and roses fan. And even the die hard Jersey Jack fan who wants to have

[03:02] like the best version of the game. So they were never going to be able to make enough to satiate

[03:07] the demand on the game. Now look I don't think anyone realized how big the demand for this game

[03:12] was going to be. I don't think Jersey Jack realized it. I don't think distributors realized it.

[03:17] I don't think customers out there realized it. I thought people thought this was going to be a

[03:21] slower burn because here's the thing we've never seen a Jersey Jack pinball machine ever sell out

[03:27] this fast. We've never seen a frenzy to get the latest Jersey Jack pinball machine. And as I go

[03:33] through the different players with this whole fiasco. I want to talk about where I think each one

[03:38] went wrong and how people are going to learn from this moving forward because I do think there are

[03:44] key things to learn and take away from this sort of sales fiasco that happened this week. So for

[03:50] those of you who don't know, here's what happened. It's real simple. Jersey Jack pinball sold this game

[03:55] to distributors and to customers directly. That's where the problem lies because they had only 500.

[04:03] Now before Monday, they did not allocate exact numbers to their distributors. They did not say

[04:11] the following. They should have said before Monday, this is how many machines we're going to sell

[04:17] direct and they needed to pick a number. They needed to set a finite number before Monday. So for

[04:23] example, if Jersey Jack pinball said we're only going to sell 100 of these games direct. Anyone in

[04:30] the world can go to Jersey Jack pinball on Monday at one o'clock Eastern time and there will be 100

[04:37] games available for direct sale after that. They are sold out. They didn't do that. They didn't say

[04:42] that. They didn't say what time. They didn't say where they didn't communicate any of that. So

[04:48] there was absolutely no understanding from anyone out there. How many they were going to get.

[04:53] Okay. So from there, you've got 400 games left. You've got distributors all over the world,

[05:00] Australia, Europe, South America, the United States. They did not before Monday tell those

[05:07] distributors how many games they were getting. Now just think about the perfect storm that was

[05:12] beginning to brew with that decision by not doing that. What they allowed to happen was this.

[05:18] They allowed everybody to get super excited about a game. They let everyone see the amazing

[05:24] launch video get there. You know, get their energy going. They're blood pumping and then they

[05:28] made you want it. But then you just didn't know if you could get one or not because here's what

[05:33] happened because the next step if people really want this game, most people will buy from distributors.

[05:38] There is a reason why there is a distributor network and you can't do both. You can't do it this

[05:45] way. It does not work. Stern pinball does not sell you any games directly. They only did it once in

[05:51] the history of Stern pinball. Remember what it was? They sold the super LEDs directly from Stern to

[05:58] handle this problem. Because they knew they were going to get way more than 80 people that wanted

[06:02] an SLE Batman and they did it that way was direct sales only. Okay. So here's the problem that

[06:09] happened Monday. So people went to their distributors and the problem then became this. Distributors

[06:16] without knowing their allotment of Guns and Roses Collective's edition, they started to sell people

[06:22] games. They started to take deposits on games and they had to assume they were going to get a certain

[06:29] number of games. But here's the problem in that. How could a distributor make an assumption of the

[06:35] amount they were going to get? Where's the prior sales example of CES for these gentlemen? What

[06:41] distributor out there ever had a problem getting a collector's edition of a Jersey Jack machine?

[06:46] Remember I mean Pirates of the Caribbean CES they only made 200 right? Those games sat in boxes

[06:53] for months. Remember go back in time. There was no like frenzy to get a pirate CES when it came out

[06:59] on launch day like there was Guns and Roses. Willy Wonka Collector's edition which they announced

[07:04] 500 they can't even give those games away. Any distributor could call up JJP and order as many

[07:10] collector's editions of Willy Wonka that they want and they could get it. So what number did

[07:16] distributors assume they were going to get? This is what I'm confused about. It's not like Stern

[07:21] which always sells through a distributor. So if you're a distributor of Stern you know exactly how

[07:26] many LEDs you're getting because you sign a contract with Stern to determine your LE number.

[07:32] So it doesn't change each new release. So if you get 25 Stern LEDs you're going to get 25 of

[07:38] every single Stern LED that comes out and you don't have to worry and then you don't have to worry

[07:43] about pissing off customers because you're not going to take orders 26, 27 and 28 if you know

[07:48] you're only getting 25. Now what happened here is so many distributors took people's deposits

[07:55] and put people on list assuming they were going to be able to fulfill those orders and I think for

[08:02] a lot of them they just assumed they'd be able to put in an order with JJP for a certain number

[08:08] of games. So let me give you an example like let's say JJ at the game exchange. Let's say he has

[08:13] 25 people who are interested in Guns and Roses Collective's Edition. Let's say he takes 25 people's

[08:19] deposits. He then wakes up the next day and submits an order to Jersey Jack Pimbal for 25 games and

[08:25] they're like, well wait a minute we can only give you 10 because of how many are left after our

[08:30] direct sale and why I've got to give games to this distributor and that distributor. So then JJ's got

[08:36] 15 people that he can't give a game to who think they're getting a game. Now here's where it really

[08:42] sucks for everyone involved who really wanted a game. When the dust settled on this thing anyone who

[08:48] went direct to Jersey Jack Pimbal and ordered directly they got their order in like that was the

[08:54] direct route to getting a game they got their order in and so basically you cut your legs off your

[09:01] distributors. If you're going to let that be the practice then what's the point of having a

[09:06] distributor but the problem is Jersey Jack can't do this you can't make your distributors lose like

[09:12] this because your distributors are the ones who are your sales force for your company they're the

[09:17] ones lining up your customers they're the ones servicing these games at the local market level

[09:23] they're the ones that have been dealing with your reliability issues they're the ones who have been

[09:27] keeping your company going and finding you new customers all these years you can't make them lose

[09:33] the distributors should be the one that you're protecting the most and I feel like they they basically

[09:39] have hurt their distributors and now the collateral damage of that is pretty catastrophic when you're

[09:46] trying to sell people toys that bring entertainment now people are waking up and they're disappointed

[09:52] they're disappointed they don't want to hear that they can't have it they thought they were in and

[09:57] that's where the disappointment lies if distributors knew the numbers they were going to get they

[10:02] could have communicated to everyone who wanted one what the reality was that I'm not getting that

[10:08] many I can't get you one I'm only getting 10 and they're all spoken for I'm sorry but I can get

[10:14] you an le and people would be like okay like they be bummed out but that's the reality but people

[10:20] thought they had it like there's nothing more painful than being on a list it's like being online

[10:25] and they're like you're gonna get into the concert and then they're letting everyone in the

[10:29] line in and then right when they get to you they're like nope you can't come in we're at capacity

[10:33] sorry you gotta go home I mean that's what happens when you take people's money and they assume

[10:39] they're gonna get it it is a painful experience to feel like the game has been robbed from you

[10:44] and you could have you could have hedged your bets you could have bought the game directly from

[10:49] Jersey Jack Pimple but this is a learning because I was using a cargument on my Facebook page

[10:54] when a hot car comes out here's what happens and I think people are realizing that this hobby

[10:59] does have a hot product like never before this is the hottest game that I've ever seen since I've

[11:05] been covering this hobby this is hotter than Ghostbusters this is hotter than any stern le ever

[11:11] and now that Jersey Jack has this hot game I think everyone's realizing what those of us in other

[11:16] collectible industries have known for many many years that when something like this happens normally

[11:22] you can never buy directly from the from the manufacturer right so let me give you a car you

[11:27] mean when Dodge came out with the demon you had to buy it through the dealerships and the dealerships

[11:32] are the ones that are a lot of cars from Dodge and here's the way it works some dealers will sell

[11:38] you the car for MSRP what Dodge says it's worth so in the demons case it's $90,000 basically okay

[11:45] now what other dealerships do is they realize there's more people who want it than there are cars

[11:51] which is what's happening right now and dealers will put what we call an ADM in a just it market

[11:58] price on to the price of the product and they'll usually mark it up by like 10 or 15 or 20,000

[12:05] dollars you think pinball markets are bad go look at the car industry okay and then they'll just

[12:10] let the car sit on the showroom floor and if you want it you might have to pay like 20 or 30% more

[12:15] because they know the market value and what people will pay is greater than a the supply Dodge has

[12:23] and b the price at which Dodge has placed on the car and that's what's happening right now with

[12:28] guns and roses is there's way more people that want it than 500 and for those people who really

[12:33] wanted who got locked out if they were to say okay like I'll sell you one for 15,000 people would

[12:39] probably buy it immediately and 16,000 17,000 and you just don't know like you don't know how bad

[12:45] people really want this game until you see what the second hand market is but I can't if I want a

[12:51] demon I can't go to Dodge directly and buy it you can't order directly from the manufacturer it's

[12:57] all through the dealerships which are basically their versions of distributors now this is the problem

[13:03] is Jersey Jack split it they were splitting hairs and we know why I mean it's no mystery why

[13:09] they make more money on every game they sell directly because they're cutting out the middle man's

[13:16] cut right because a distributor makes money on every game sold if they don't have to sell it through

[13:21] a distributor they don't have to pay the distributor that money again but as I said earlier you don't

[13:25] want to burn those people that are your sales force and that are your service force like this is

[13:30] you need them you need them to create happy customers and loyal customers I don't understand for

[13:36] the life of me how they didn't before Monday sit in a room and pressure test this thing like how

[13:43] do they not sit in a room and say what do we do if we get more than 500 people who want a CE this

[13:49] game is super hot they know what they were sitting on I mean they put all that energy into the amazing

[13:55] launch video they put all that energy into all the different stuff they did with slash and nobody

[14:01] sat down and said okay this is amazing we're gonna have the biggest pinball launch in history and it

[14:07] was we're gonna have the most amazing reveal on the history of pinball are we ready to deal with the

[14:13] amount of people that are going to want to get this limited version of the game what's our strategy

[14:18] for that how did they not how did they not sit in a room and figure that out I think part of this

[14:24] is exposing that Jersey Jack pinball has never been in this situation before there's still a very

[14:30] small company there's people over there that are still pretty new at doing some of these things when

[14:36] it comes to like the marketing and understanding the PR crisis that could hit if this happens and I

[14:41] think there was someone who made a decision it just seems like someone made a decision to try to

[14:45] make as much money as possible by selling as many games as possible directly they sold these games

[14:52] directly for like a very long time on Monday I mean it wasn't limited for I don't think they shut

[14:58] off the order banks until late late Monday night and the other part I don't get on Monday how did

[15:04] the distributors who actually had a phone call with Jersey Jack at 11 a.m. how did they not pound

[15:10] their fist into the table and say Jack we need to know our numbers before you announce this game is

[15:17] for sale at one o'clock so there was a two hour window between the distributor phone call and

[15:24] games going on sale in which still nobody was given their allotment number that never should have

[15:31] happened and they never should have ever taken any orders unless they knew how many they were

[15:37] getting there's like blame to go around by both sides but ultimately the blame does fall on

[15:44] Jersey Jack Pimble because really what's screwing everyone over here the real thing that's

[15:49] screwing everyone over here is that their direct sales are locked in they're locked in they're not

[15:56] telling people who ordered directly from them sorry you can't get a game no it's the customers

[16:02] of the distributors that are being told they can't have a game that sucks that sucks that is a

[16:09] huge problem now what do they do now what's done is done what do they do now so one of the

[16:13] things they're trying to do and I want to just like for the record say that canada does not have

[16:17] four collectors editions of guns and roses all right I was joking with iceman and now he's going

[16:22] around saying that canada is not flipping guns and roses canada is putting a guns and roses

[16:28] right here okay and I got one for my friend okay so canada is not this evil bad guy who's trying

[16:34] to like flip this game and make you guys pay over so just for the record you heard it here did I

[16:39] did I flip my big labowski for profit no I donated the money so take my word for that so I don't

[16:44] know where that that whole rumor started now they're like in damage control now they're trying to

[16:48] figure out like what do we do now so the first thing they're trying to do is limit it to being one

[16:54] per customer and that that opens up a whole nother debate right so I have a friend I'm not going to

[16:59] name his name he has two homes and he wants to buy one guns and roses for each of his homes he's

[17:04] the biggest guns and roses fan is he not allowed to do that if he got in early and he got his

[17:10] orders in or he ordered directly from Jersey Jack does he now have to lose a game because of what

[17:16] because there's not enough he did everything that they said you needed to do to get these games so

[17:22] now after the fact I think they want to limit it to one per customer but you need to say that

[17:28] before you open up your order books it's like Sony is telling people we're only going to sell one

[17:34] PlayStation 5 per customer but they let everybody know that beforehand you can't really change the

[17:40] rules of how your sales are going to work midway through again they should a pressure test at this

[17:46] they easily could have done this a week before Monday and said hey maybe we should do a lottery

[17:51] system in which every distributor will allocate you but what your number is going to be based on a

[17:57] lottery system or how about this everyone who wants a guns and roses collector's edition like

[18:02] raise your hand and you enter into a lottery but nobody thought this was going to happen nobody

[18:07] but canada I was telling you this would happen with this game so many of you were like no one's

[18:11] going to care about guns and roses the game has been made before you I told you this band is so

[18:16] much cooler than you realize this band is so much more relevant than black Sabbath people wake up

[18:23] there's more guns and roses fans right now than led Zeppelin I'm telling you led Zeppelin is

[18:28] not going to have this kind of frenzy poor led Zeppelin and Steve Richie that pain is going to

[18:32] come out after this anyway I digress but they easily could have done that so now they're trying to

[18:38] make it so like one per customer and that's okay fine fine but I still think if some guy bought one

[18:43] or more I don't think he should have to lose his spot because it's like now you start to get into

[18:48] this like Pandora's box where it's like well what are you going to do with your second one well what

[18:52] if it's for the guy's wife what if it's for his brother what if it's for his like nephew who

[18:57] loves guns and roses does he now have to like explain to you what he's doing with his money on the

[19:03] two games he bought he just shelled out twenty five thousand dollars he's allowed to do with his two

[19:09] games whatever he wants and here's the thing too I'm just going to say it if someone gets in and

[19:14] gets in early and gets two games he's allowed to flip that second game even if he wants to I know

[19:19] this annoys some of you so much this is called the free market this is called the free market I'm sorry

[19:26] if I buy a PlayStation 5 even if I buy one per customer I'm allowed to take the one for me

[19:32] and sell it for double on eBay this holiday season and I'm so tired of people trying to like

[19:37] police this thing and say you're not allowed to do that you're not allowed to do that people are

[19:42] gonna flip look at all the people that flipped Rick and Morty's I mean thank God for all of us thank

[19:47] God for all of us Hilton as a 90 day ban on Pinside because he would be going crazy that you're not

[19:53] allowed to take advantage of the free market you know and those kind of people like they shut down

[19:58] they shut down what I believe is just the basic fundamentals of supply demand economics I'm sorry

[20:04] I'm sorry if you got in early the lesson for everyone is get in early and find the right way in

[20:10] find the right way in to get this stuff it's just the way life works and I'm telling you right

[20:15] now the sooner you realize what I'm about to say the better life isn't fair it's not fair it's not

[20:21] fair if you go to a restaurant and there's four tables open and you asked to be seated and they say

[20:26] sorry we're full tonight and then someone else who knows the owner walks in right after you and says

[20:32] hey you know table for two and he's like right this way Jim and that's the way it happens even if

[20:38] he didn't have a reservation that's life it's not always fair some of some people out there have

[20:44] relationships with their distributors where they know they're going to get one they don't even have

[20:47] to be on a list they don't even have to give a thousand dollars because they buy every Ellie from

[20:52] that distributor so yeah that's life they have a bigger relationship than you do they have a

[20:57] stronger connection to the product than you do and I see people moaning on Pinside about this I'm

[21:02] like did you just wake up to how life works it does how it works it's not fair I get it they're

[21:07] trying to do damage control one per customer we'll see how that works out for them they're now

[21:12] going down with their distributors and breaking the hard news to a lot of them today that this is how

[21:16] many you're going to get and you're going to have to submit to us everybody who's buying one from

[21:21] you and this is it like no duplicates are they going to call up everyone on those lists to confirm

[21:27] that are you are you are you Bill Brandis is nephew or you are you are you rare heroes like cousin

[21:32] are you like you know what are they going to do are they going to go on a witch hunt trying to

[21:36] find out what's happening here and who everyone is and everyone has to validate who they are I think

[21:42] the only thing they can do right now is what's done is done I think they need to let it ride out

[21:47] the way it's going to ride out it's going to be what it is you're going to see some people flip

[21:52] these games you're not going to be able to stop it okay I think that's just the way it works I think

[21:57] it's actually a good day that Jersey Jack has something so popular people will do that and people

[22:02] will pay over 12.5 to get one of these it's just the way it is can Jersey Jack make more if

[22:08] her people say this should they do what's turned it with the monsters and just increase the production

[22:12] of it and make everybody happy and the answer there is no you can't do that you have to stay true

[22:18] to making the amount you said you were going to make I'm sorry you can't rewrite the rules

[22:23] of your own product and the reason why it is collectible is because there are only 500 and you

[22:30] can't sell 500 oh tomorrow there's 250 more because then what happens then when you have 750

[22:36] but then another 250 people want them you just keep making them until there's no more demand and

[22:41] then you cut the value out from all of them it doesn't work that way that's not how Rolex makes

[22:46] their watches it's not how Dodge did the demon it's not how Ferrari makes limited edition versions

[22:52] again this is a very limited edition version of the game same exact game as as the Ellie except for

[22:57] that little you know coma lock in the apron all right so they can't make more if they do make

[23:02] more I think it's a huge mistake I think they'll lose trust with their customers more than ever

[23:08] and I think people just won't go in again the other thing people are are wondering if Jersey Jack will do

[23:12] this will they just make another collector's edition right we saw this with Wizard of Oz will they

[23:17] make a like a Ruby red version of this game will there be like a slash top hat edition I don't know

[23:23] I don't know they're sort of stuck in this weird place where like they said 5000 LEs that's like

[23:28] too many LEs they easily could have like you know 22500 or this 2500 or that but 5000 of the same

[23:36] art package I don't know what you do now I think you let it ride I think those 500 are always going

[23:43] to be special I think people are going to keep them though for the most part I mean some people

[23:48] will flip them I'm not flipping one I can't wait to get the game I have one I've been on this

[23:54] list forever for this game and I think for those of you out there I mean can you know canators the

[23:59] biggest guns in roses fan canators the big you know I've been covering pimple for a really long time

[24:03] this is the game that is like my dream come true it's like my dream man that my dream designer

[24:09] a dream game and from what I'm hearing this game shoots like a dream this is like my final part I

[24:14] want to say is like I've been hearing people moan too like the haters are coming out like the long

[24:18] ball times and everything's a multi ball and like everyone just needs to shut up okay because I'm

[24:22] here to tell you right now people who spend $13,000 on a toy that's a pinball machine based on a

[24:29] band they love they want there to be long ball times they want to enjoy the game they love multi

[24:34] ball they want to see all the balls going they want to see all the lights going they want to play the

[24:38] November rain mode and be able to play in 11 minute game in which they go through the entire song

[24:44] and that's not annoying to us you know it's annoying to home collectors constantly hearing from

[24:49] tournament players to learn how to play better to make up for bad geometry and games that shoot like

[24:56] crap that brick left and right that have terribly short ball times because the games are way too hard

[25:02] it's not fun I'm sorry most of us have lives we have jobs we have families we have things we do

[25:09] with our days we can't spend the amount of hours you spend to become good at pinball to the level

[25:14] where we can actually get more than two golden tickets so I am happy to hear that guns and roses

[25:20] shoots phenomenally well that it's super fun that the ramps are wide open that the game is

[25:25] approachable that everyone is going to hop on this game and start a song and probably get a

[25:30] multi ball going that makes me excited I don't want to jump on a game in which it's like oh you're

[25:35] just gonna keep breaking and breaking and breaking in each game is gonna be like 90 seconds and

[25:39] that's it and you're never gonna get this many adventures and you're never gonna get this many

[25:42] golden tickets and you're never gonna see wonka's office and you're never gonna see pure imagination

[25:46] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sure there's stuff that's buried deep in the code to get to those deeper

[25:51] wizard modes but but for most people they wanted to make a game where you're gonna be able to

[25:56] experience what's exciting about this game that's how you make a pinball game it's so stupid that

[26:02] you like burry wonka's office so no one ever gets to see wonka's office great job on that no

[26:07] everyone's gonna get to see the amazing light show with the amazing songs and the amazing integration

[26:12] so what let them enjoy it this notion that and it's so we it's always the tournament players who

[26:18] are complaining about this oh there's just gonna be really long ball times yeah great so you

[26:22] can't put this game in your little tournaments because you guys are so good you'll sit on it for an

[26:26] hour I don't care I don't care Lord the Rings is the greatest machine ever and it's long

[26:32] ball times and I love it and I love that G and R is a game that's gonna be fun to shoot and not

[26:37] be a brick fest all right to close the loop on this episode let me just say this this is the ultimate

[26:43] first world problem all right if you tell anyone else with what's going on in the world that you

[26:48] missed out on your 13 thousand dollar pinball machine and have been relegated to your 10 thousand

[26:54] dollar pinball machine watch people's eyes glaze over I mean we're seeing it on the guns and roses

[27:01] message boards these fans of the band who are like the music fans when they hear how much this game

[27:07] is they are like offended they're like mad they're angry I should know because I used to be on my

[27:12] G&R form for like 20 years I'm also banned from that form people I'm banned from everywhere because I

[27:18] call these people out like they're so ridiculous on that form they're still waiting for another album

[27:24] there is no studio album coming out from this band they never release albums it's like the white

[27:29] whale of the music industry but to close the loop Jersey Jack pinball has to learn from this they

[27:36] have to put out a statement but they can't make a move that's going to like make it even worse

[27:42] and I think printing more games is not the answer I think they need to put out a statement that says

[27:47] we were overwhelmed by the support and enthusiasm for our latest title guns and roses we were not

[27:54] prepared for the volume of orders we received on day one unfortunately we will not be able to

[28:01] satisfy all of you who want a collector's edition but in the future we are going to figure out

[28:07] a new system by which people can get in on the rare versions of these games and I think they

[28:13] need to say something simple like that and then just let it ride I do I there's just like because

[28:18] you're never going to please everybody it reminds me when I launch Pepsi perfect we only made 9000

[28:24] bottles of Pepsi perfect I mean it was ridiculous like you just have to realize when you make a

[28:28] highly sought after collectible you're always going to piss off more people than you please and then

[28:34] it just becomes for those of you who really want these collectibles you have to figure out the

[28:38] right way to get it you know whether it's direct or through distributor you have to figure out how

[28:43] do I become one of the lucky few and that's just what a collectible is like a lucky few amount of

[28:48] people get it and that's it and that's it and I know that's not what everybody wants in pinball

[28:53] but that's just life and life isn't fair I don't know how this is all going to unfold but it is

[28:59] definitely it is definitely guns and roses man everything that has to do with G&R is always drama

[29:04] there's always fighting there's always screaming so this is just perfect perfect and if you think

[29:09] about the irony of it all for all of you getting shut out and feeling pissed off you can't you know

[29:15] you can't say they misled you because it is not in this lifetime so for some of you out there

[29:20] unfortunately having a CE is going to be not in this lifetime everyone have a good day we'll talk to

[29:26] you soon
