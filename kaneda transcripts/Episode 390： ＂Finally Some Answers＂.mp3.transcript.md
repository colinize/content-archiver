[00:00] The point of no return, no backward glances, the games we've played to no other than us.

[00:16] Alright, we're finally starting to get some answers from these pinball manufacturers on

[00:27] what they're going to do with the play field issues that are permeating the entire hobby right now.

[00:33] I talked to Richie Ranch last night. We're going to air that interview this week. Awesome guy has a

[00:39] huge collection and maintaining these games and making sure he's buying quality products is number

[00:46] one to him. So I think you're going to find that really interesting. The stance he's taking on

[00:51] pausing on buying a Willy Wonka collector's edition. So what has happened in the last like 24 hours?

[00:58] Well, this week in pinball, Jeff has got some responses from manufacturers on what's going on with

[01:05] this issue. Now, let's read the responses from manufacturers and give our point of view on what

[01:11] they're saying here. So first and foremost, we heard from the largest pinball company in the world,

[01:18] Zach Sharp over at Stern pinball. Here is what Zach is saying. He said, no widespread issues here at

[01:24] Stern can't speak for other manufacturers though. If anyone does have any issues with their games,

[01:32] though, they should definitely be reaching out to their distributor. Alright, so no widespread

[01:39] issues. Well, we're seeing a lot of Jurassic Park photos going up with this issue occurring. So

[01:46] we also know that Stern ships a lot of games, right? They make like 50 games a day. They make as

[01:52] many games in a day as Jersey Jack probably does in one to two weeks. So is this a widespread issue?

[01:59] Now the thing is this, they're still having an issue. So why is that the case? Because we also found

[02:06] out another interesting bit of information. And that Stern pinball does not use Mirko to make their

[02:15] playfields. Jersey Jack uses Mirko. So why is it that we're seeing similar problems? And

[02:23] although these are not coming from the same source. So my speculation that maybe all of these

[02:29] troubled playfields are coming from one manufacturer or vendor is wrong. So that is an interesting

[02:37] tidbit. I did respond to Zach because all he did when I asked him what Stern's POV on all of this,

[02:43] he just cut and paste that this week in pinball a screenshot for me. He didn't give me my own

[02:49] answer. But I did ask him one very specific question. And that is what will Stern be doing to the

[02:56] individuals and what will they be doing in terms of resolution to those individuals that have had

[03:02] issues? And I asked him straight up, have you seen the photos of some of these Jurassic Park games

[03:08] in which clear coat is clearly just chipping or puddling around the post? And I do encourage all of

[03:16] you to go somewhere today and listen to what Ian thinks the loser kid pinball podcast Ian was

[03:23] interviewed by Zach many on this week in pinball's podcast. And I'll just summarize it for you if you

[03:28] don't want to listen. But he's worked in the clear code industry for years. And here's the issue

[03:34] that he thinks is the problem is that when you're mixing the clear code, the formula for the clear

[03:40] code spray, right? The actual chemical formula of the clear. It should be like 50% hardening and 50%

[03:49] of softener. So you got to get the right mix. So it's not too hard because if it's too hard,

[03:53] it'll crack. And we've seen that in pinball before. It's brittle. It'll just break. But if it's too

[03:58] soft, you'll get the puddling issue that we're seeing in which the the post are sinking right into

[04:04] the game itself. So he believes in his summary is that the clear code formula that these companies

[04:11] are using is the problem that they're not getting the right mix of hardness and softness together

[04:19] to create a play field that won't break, but also won't be too soft, right? And you have to find

[04:25] that 50, 50 formula of when you mix the compound. And his recommendation is you should go to the big

[04:32] companies that make these water-based clear codes because it's not water-based as the problem. It's

[04:38] the way they're mixing it. So if Mirko is making in-house their own clear code formula, then clearly

[04:45] that's the issue that the vendor themselves doesn't have consistency on making this clear code

[04:52] formula. And same is true with whatever's happening at Stern. We're seeing it, right? The mixture

[04:58] must be creating clear code that is too soft. And maybe some of it's too hard. And that's why we're

[05:03] seeing some of those posts chip away at the clear code on some of those Jurassic Park. So I do recommend

[05:08] you listen to that podcast. There's a good 15 minute chunk, about 15 minutes in when they talk

[05:14] about the clear code issue. So we know that Stern's response. Do we expect anything more from Stern? We

[05:20] know they're going to sort of never really admit there's an issue. But we do we do know one thing.

[05:26] Stern will take care of their customers if you buy a new game and your play field has sort of like a

[05:32] catastrophic clear code issue. I am fully confident that Stern has set the precedence that they will

[05:39] send you a solution to your liking. If they don't, I know we'll hear about it from customers, but

[05:45] we've seen them in the past send out fully populated play fields for ghost busters when we have

[05:51] the ghosted insert issue. Will they do the same for Jurassic Park customers that are having these

[05:57] issues on these new games? Only time will tell, but time has shown us that Stern will do the right

[06:04] thing and make the customers whole. Now the other side of the fence is Jersey Jack Pimbal, a company

[06:10] which we know, which we know cannot afford to send people fully populated play fields if they're

[06:17] having issues and yet they are having issues. Now Jeff reached out to Jack himself and here is the

[06:25] response that he got that he contacted Jack who shared that he was out of the country with

[06:32] spotty service and would respond after he returns on September 8th. Let's talk about that for a minute.

[06:40] How can you be off the grid in 2019 while an issue that is at your front door that is severely going

[06:51] to impact people's desire to buy your product? This is hurting sales for Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[06:58] If this hurts one company the most, it's going to be Jersey Jack Pimbal. We've seen this problem

[07:04] far more prevalent, if that's a word, on Jersey Jack games and we saw a lot of pirates the

[07:12] Caribbean owners with this issue. We're seeing Willy Wonka owners with this issue and Jack's responses

[07:18] I've got spotty service in Europe and I'll get back to you in a couple weeks. Do we consider that

[07:26] to be an adequate response right now considering what's going on and I'm just going to say it it's not.

[07:32] You know it's not I know it's not there is no excuse for being off the grid when your company is

[07:39] having a little bit of an issue and a crisis and the problem right now is this they are still

[07:46] shipping games to consumers for a lot of money without figuring out what the problem is. So I don't

[07:54] understand how you can continue to assemble games before you've hit pause and figured out the

[08:01] solution because for every single game that Jersey Jack ships out that has a potential flaw in it

[08:08] that's another customer that is going to want a resolution and it will be far more expensive

[08:14] for them in the long run to have to send these people replacement play fields that are populated

[08:20] than it would be to hit stop and figure the problem out if they were to communicate right now we are

[08:26] not making any more Willy Wonka's until we figure out what is wrong with the clear code I think

[08:31] people would rather hear that the problem is this they're sort of they're sort of effed either way

[08:37] because they need it to solve this problem before Wonka production began because now what's going

[08:45] is anyone who took delivery of a Willy Wonka over the last few weeks is going to cry that they got

[08:52] an inferior version of the game and they're going to want a replacement version of the game that has

[08:58] the solution in place because the main thing if you listen to Ian's podcast with Zach he said

[09:05] if the clear code is too soft it will never cure hard because the formula in that clear

[09:13] was mixed incorrectly and it's overly soft and there's no way to make it harder so for all of you

[09:20] out there who think if you just wait a month or you wait a week or you wait a year it doesn't matter

[09:26] you're still going to have a soft permanently soft clear code in your game so if your

[09:31] pie are to the Caribbean isn't doing so well or your Willy Wonka isn't doing so well it's just going

[09:36] to get worse it will never get better so that is a damning bit of information on this whole issue

[09:45] and we're getting some of this information from experts in the field so you know not good news

[09:51] and so I guess I can't help but think about this issue now if Jersey Jack doesn't figure out a

[09:58] solution before the collector's editions go on the line and collector's editions of Willy Wonka

[10:05] go out to customers and they experience this issue could this be potentially a fatal mistake

[10:13] for Jersey Jack Pimball will they be able to recover goodwill and will they be able to retain

[10:21] customers if they knowingly if they knowingly put the most expensive version of the game on the line

[10:28] before they fix the problem and I know this is an issue in a crisis for these companies and I know

[10:34] they want to sort of avoid it but there's no avoiding it I know some podcasts are still avoiding

[10:40] the topic I just so I head to head interviewed Keith L. and that's great they don't talk about the

[10:45] play field issues that you know I don't I don't think people really want to talk about game strategy

[10:50] and this and that if the game they're going to buy has a defective play field in it I'm sorry but

[10:56] it just sort of it it overrides everything else and the enjoyment of these products because nobody

[11:02] wants to buy a game that has a defective clear code nobody raise your hand if you're willing to

[11:07] live with this I know our good friend of the show Derek on Pinside he keeps trying to like convince

[11:12] people like you could just bail on Pimball or you could live with it and have fun but Derek you

[11:17] don't you're wrong you're absolutely wrong nobody should have to put up with this this is a

[11:24] manufacturing defect when we're hearing from people who know how to do clear codes and they're saying

[11:30] this is the this problem is coming from whoever is making these play fields but the problem is they

[11:36] and now that we're seeing it across the board nobody's saying stop wait a minute what are we doing

[11:41] what's the solution here and I and and we're still not getting direct direct answers about what

[11:46] the solution will be but I think if the collectors additions come out with issues I would hate

[11:54] I would hate to be in the board remote red jersey jack pinball when the investors are are

[11:58] going to be told hey to fix this problem we're going to have to spend X amount of dollars and go

[12:03] back and lose all of our profit probably on these games to make these customers happy or else we're

[12:09] going to have an army of unhappy customers at our door because jersey jack buyers are not

[12:14] stern buyers I think the majority of stern buyers are more casual Pimball buyers they have far more

[12:20] distributors they get far more casual people to walk into showrooms and distributors and just

[12:25] buy these games I think a lot of stern buyers would not even notice there's an issue but jersey

[12:31] jack is different they make less games they make more expensive games they make premium games the

[12:36] jersey jack audience is primarily on pin side and these guys are connected and they're talking about

[12:44] this issue and their most of them are experiencing this issue and I think it's much more prevalent in

[12:49] the jersey jack game so a lot more to come but jack you can't hide in Europe that's not a good

[12:55] response that everyone has to wait while you're on vacation because for people buying these games

[13:00] right now jack it's no vacation for them that they have to open up the game and see these issues

[13:06] knowing that it's always going to annoy them it's always going to bug them and god forbid

[13:12] this clear code starts to chip and remove and pull up the artwork it's you know it washers are

[13:18] not the answer and people who think like putting a washer underneath is going to solve anything it's

[13:22] not it's just going to sink more into that soft clear code that is a defective clear all right so I

[13:29] also reached out to Charlie Emory at spooky pinball because they've been able to solve the problem I

[13:34] mean Charlie told me like look we had issues with TNA and we quickly realized it we were panicking

[13:40] and we figured out what the issue is and we made a solve now he's not telling me specifically

[13:45] what the solve was and nor should he let's not for a minute fool ourselves like if you're a company

[13:51] that doesn't have this issue you you had knew you now have a competitive advantage if you're able

[13:56] to make your clear codes better than your competition and they're having issues you're not going to

[14:01] divulge your secrets on what you're doing why would you do that and and I think Charlie has figured out

[14:08] the problem and we're not seeing any issues on Alice Cooper's nightmare castle now he also did not

[14:13] want to speculate on why other people are having the problems they're having but he did give me

[14:18] something he said would would be his response that I could read on air and I will do that right now

[14:23] and I haven't even read it yet it's right here in my inbox I just got it 21 minutes ago and he says

[14:29] spooky pinball LLC would like to assure everyone that our issues on TNA were resolved long prior to

[14:37] the run of that game ending and have not since been seen in hundreds of total nuclear annihilation

[14:43] in Alice Cooper's nightmare castle games we've fought incredibly hard to make those issues right

[14:50] with our customers and apologize if it was ever a problem in the first place playfield are the

[14:56] most proprietary process in making any pinball machine so getting companies to give absolute details

[15:02] on what issues are happening is always going to be like pulling teeth I can tell you at spooky

[15:08] pinball that no expenses spared no corners are cut and there is no fast and cheap way to make a

[15:15] playfield that a company can or should be embracing to save a buck it's far more cost effective

[15:23] for a company to spend more now and have no issues later to be blunt the boards we used in TNA were a

[15:30] big cost increase but not a big improvement in quality I've talked to several people in the

[15:37] industry about this subject and I believe if spending more money would solve their issue today

[15:43] they do it in a heartbeat but obviously I can't and don't speak for everyone I can only relay

[15:50] what our personal experience and beliefs are here regardless we are incredibly happy with our

[15:56] process and locally made playfields are and are confident in their ability to last for years to come

[16:03] we test constantly abuse them in ways nobody ever should and hope those results are speaking

[16:09] volumes about our level of care quality and customer support nothing about making pinball is

[16:16] easy least of all making playfields we wish everyone who is working every bit as hard as we are

[16:22] in the industry nothing but the best of luck and success peace love and all things pinball Charlie

[16:29] Emmering well that that was great Charlie thank you so much and I think you hit the nail on the head

[16:34] it is it is not a place in which you can cut corners but it is something you need to get right

[16:40] there is no there is no way to accept an inferior playfield with what these games cost and just knowing

[16:49] what the target audience expects from pinball you need to make a playfield that is rock solid and I

[16:54] think the thing that's hanging over everyone's head is is just why now like why is this happening now

[17:02] for years we've had no issues with games for years we've had nothing but solid playfields for years

[17:08] we can go back 20 years and play a game that that's experiencing no issues so why all of a sudden

[17:13] are we having these issues and the bottom line is this we're going to keep beating this drum you know

[17:18] you know how I like to do this podcast I mean I want to know from stern what they're going to do

[17:22] for people who open the box and the clear is defective I want to know from Jersey Jack what they're

[17:27] going to do you know he's supposed to show the collector's edition games by the end of August well

[17:31] guess what that's this week but Jack's not going to respond to what the saw is until September 8 so

[17:37] clearly we're either not going to see the collector's edition or they're going to ship it with the

[17:42] defective issue do you think they've solved the problem by now I don't I think we're still going

[17:47] to experience some of this stuff and you know we're going to keep reporting it we're going to keep

[17:52] reporting it you know miracles not going to answer anyone directly Charlie is right it's going to be

[17:57] like pulling teeth and I still recommend to all of you out there you don't have to bail on pinball

[18:04] all of you guys out there have machines you have machines you enjoy I just wouldn't buy anything

[18:08] new in box right now I absolutely would not roll the dice with this kind of money knowing that

[18:13] these issues are affecting stern and Jersey Jack I think you could buy spooky games confidently

[18:18] right now I think you can buy American pinball games confidently right now you can definitely buy

[18:23] p3 multi morphic with confidence right now Chicago gaming company I haven't heard this issue happening

[18:29] on any of their games this is really a Jersey Jack and stern issue and we're going to look forward

[18:34] to see what the resolutions are but if you're having issues with this I recommend you contact your

[18:40] distributor immediately and you open a ticket about this you take photos you document you document

[18:46] what's going on it sucks right it totally sucks and man I just I just I want to get back to talking

[18:53] about how excited we are about other things happening in pinball but between this issue and Dutch

[18:59] pinball trying to convince people that they can ponsy scheme their way back into a successful company

[19:04] it's just it's comical every time we were turning a corner here right we're we're seeing like

[19:10] new issues pop up that we didn't expect and old companies that have failed time and time again

[19:15] trying to convince us that they can make it work I mean I won't even go into Dutch again if you I've

[19:19] read that newsletter again from them and it just it makes no sense it it they're literally is no

[19:25] you know Barry says ask me a question just ask him where the money went and ask him where he's

[19:29] going to get the money to restart that company there there he has no answer for that he has no

[19:34] answer for that and and that's that those are the two most important questions so look ladies and

[19:39] gentlemen we're going to keep on this topic thank you for tuning into Canadian pinball podcast

[19:45] uh you know how we do it we just do episodes when we have something to cover and I think Charles

[19:49] responds to this speaks volumes and I think he's right and I think these companies need to figure it

[19:55] out and figure that figured out quickly and much like what happened at spooky I do think there

[19:59] needs to be some more urgency and some more panicking going on and I don't hear that when I read

[20:06] Zach's response and I don't see that when I hear Jack's response it's just like well it's not that

[20:10] big of an issue even just one is a big issue and and I know that's being a little dramatic but it's

[20:17] far more than just a small little percentage of play fields that are experiencing these issues it is

[20:22] and and we have the pictures to prove that so we'll see what they say next but you best believe

[20:27] can you just pinball podcast we'll be on top of this on a weekly basis everyone have a great day

[20:32] Richie Ranch will be on the next show and I think you're really going to enjoy it have an awesome

[20:36] awesome Monday afternoon

[20:52] and
