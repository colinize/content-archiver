[00:00] Welcome to the jungle!

[00:02] We got fun and games!

[00:04] We got another thing you want!

[00:06] How do we know the names?

[00:08] We are the people that can find

[00:10] Whatever you may need

[00:12] If you got somebody, how do we got your disease?

[00:16] A jungle! Welcome to the jungle!

[00:18] Welcome to the jungle!

[00:20] Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

[00:22] Me, me, me, me, me!

[00:30] In all my years of doing

[00:32] Canatus Pimball Podcast

[00:34] and in all of the different interviews

[00:36] I've done over the years

[00:38] on this show

[00:40] I do think this interview might

[00:42] just spark the most

[00:44] reaction from people

[00:46] and from the Pimball community

[00:48] and I kind of feel like it's going to

[00:50] So I really think you're going to

[00:52] enjoy listening to this

[00:56] a little bit over an hour

[00:58] with Robert Mueller

[01:00] over at Deeproot Pimball

[01:02] and Robert has done

[01:04] me the favor of spending an hour

[01:06] and answering all of the questions I had

[01:08] about Deeproot

[01:10] about Raza, about what the future holds

[01:12] and I tried to capture

[01:14] what I think

[01:16] are the big questions on

[01:18] everyone's mind

[01:20] as we move into 2020

[01:22] and as we sort of think

[01:24] about a world

[01:26] where Deeproot Pimball

[01:28] machines will become available

[01:30] to consumers, okay?

[01:32] Now you know

[01:34] Robert speaks his mind

[01:36] you know he doesn't hold back

[01:38] when he's talking about

[01:40] Pimball companies

[01:42] and Pimball personalities, okay?

[01:44] He kind of reminds me

[01:46] a little bit of myself at times

[01:48] in terms of not caring

[01:50] what anyone thinks

[01:52] he's going to tell you how he feels

[01:54] and I do think the one big thing

[01:56] I would love to see Robert

[01:58] sort of turn a page on

[02:00] is you're going to have to sell

[02:02] to the people in the Pimball community

[02:04] and on the forums, right?

[02:06] There's no reason why you have to go

[02:08] on the offensive against them

[02:10] but you know he sees it

[02:12] the way he sees it

[02:14] and ultimately

[02:16] what all of us want to do

[02:18] is judge a man

[02:20] or woman because it's 2019

[02:22] by the game they make.

[02:23] They should speak volumes

[02:25] for your company. It's the game you make.

[02:27] And we've seen some of the game, right?

[02:29] It's a prototype but we've seen some of the game.

[02:31] And as you hear a lot of the game is there.

[02:33] So that game

[02:35] will be judged on its merits

[02:37] and when they are ready to show

[02:39] us the final package, that's it.

[02:41] That's going to be

[02:43] either worth the hype

[02:45] or not worth the hype.

[02:47] And we're going to be able

[02:49] to as consumers

[02:51] if this is worth it,

[02:53] if all the years were worth it,

[02:55] if this is a company we want to support,

[02:57] if this is a company

[02:59] that has done enough innovation

[03:01] to get your money,

[03:03] have they brought enough value

[03:05] into the Pimball world

[03:07] to warrant your hard earned dollars, okay?

[03:09] And that tale is not done yet.

[03:11] We are going to see more

[03:13] of what they have to offer come 2020.

[03:17] Okay, so I think you're just going to like have to listen

[03:19] to this interview.

[03:21] But before I air it,

[03:23] I do need to wish

[03:25] an early birthday, okay?

[03:27] An early birthday

[03:29] to Paul, who is a listener of the show.

[03:31] Now I was going to do it on Thursday

[03:33] when his actual birthday is

[03:35] but Paul, the reason why I'm not doing that right now

[03:37] is because I kind of just want to let this interview

[03:39] stay up for a while

[03:41] and let it simmer

[03:43] and let people listen to it.

[03:45] But I'll say this Paul,

[03:47] Robert Mueller from Deeproot

[03:49] and that Nicole,

[03:51] she's awesome.

[03:53] You have an awesome girl, right?

[03:55] So everybody, enjoy this interview

[03:57] with Robert Mueller.

[03:59] I am so sure it is going to spark conversation.

[04:01] We will talk more about what is said on this

[04:03] interview at a later date.

[04:05] I don't like to talk after an interview

[04:07] that I do with somebody

[04:09] because I don't think that's fair

[04:11] to do it right after the show.

[04:13] Like, Robert and I finished talking

[04:15] about summerization

[04:17] or summarize what he said.

[04:19] Now, this is just the way it was.

[04:21] No editing on this show.

[04:23] No notes. No nothing.

[04:25] I just called him

[04:27] and we had an hour and 10-minute conversation

[04:29] and I'm going to play it for you right now.

[04:31] All right, ladies and gentlemen,

[04:33] I want to welcome back to

[04:35] Canada's Pinball podcast,

[04:37] a very special guest coming

[04:39] to the show after a very big moment

[04:41] for his company, Deeproot Pinball

[04:43] and Robert Mueller back to Canada's Pinball podcast.

[04:47] Thanks, Chris. It's nice to be back.

[04:49] And it's nice to be able to actually talk about some stuff now

[04:53] instead of, you know, kind of say that

[04:55] we can wait and see what's going to happen in the future.

[04:57] So I'm looking forward to some great questions

[04:59] and maybe to clarify some things.

[05:01] And I'm ready to go whenever you are.

[05:03] Yeah, no, I think the word that comes to mind for most of us

[05:07] is finally we get to talk about

[05:09] something of substance over words,

[05:11] which is great. And we're going to have a good time talking about it.

[05:13] So I guess the first question I have for you, Robert,

[05:15] is just how does it feel to finally have something out there

[05:19] in the world, even though it's a prototype.

[05:21] We will confirm that.

[05:23] But how does it feel to finally pull some of the curtain back?

[05:25] Well, I think I have mixed feelings.

[05:27] I think as the loser kid,

[05:31] Pinball podcast, one of my answers there was kind of real.

[05:35] I think that I've been overwhelmed

[05:37] in being delayed by the time we launch it.

[05:39] And I think that we've been delayed by the time we launch and march

[05:43] of next year, about a year.

[05:45] And sometimes I struggle to find that passion still for Pinball.

[05:49] And I know that a lot of people inside the company have been wondering

[05:53] whether or not this year that we've been delayed will be worth it.

[05:57] And can we succeed in the grand vision that we set out on?

[06:01] And I think in some ways this last weekend was a big confidence booster

[06:05] that we can do it and that people will receive a low bill type of machine

[06:11] like what we had, let alone what we plan to unleash in a couple months.

[06:15] So it's day by day, but I've got a lot of my play because Pinball is one of

[06:21] just a few things that I deal with on a daily basis.

[06:25] And so I'm relieved, but also I realize that we still have a long ways to go.

[06:29] Right. So how has that been 2019?

[06:31] Because we know at the beginning of the year there was a lot of

[06:33] excitement and would you say a little bit of overconfidence in the ability to get

[06:39] stuff to market in 2019?

[06:41] Yeah, I know you love to continue to relive some of my comments from

[06:47] Chicago Expo 2018.

[06:51] And you know what? Look, I've said a lot of brush things.

[06:55] You know, I, as I said before, I don't believe in the phrase no regrets

[06:59] because there are regrets.

[07:03] I truly wanted to do everything that I promised and my team expected

[07:07] themselves and myself when we made those statements at Expo.

[07:11] But at the end of the day, someone had to take the bull by the horns

[07:17] and they had to make a hard business decision about whether to show before we already.

[07:21] And it was tough. We took a definitely a PR hit for it.

[07:25] But I'm hoping that in time when people will get to enjoy what we've been working on

[07:29] and they can see why we delayed it a year and all the benefits of that delay.

[07:33] I think that in the end all will be forgotten by most.

[07:37] And we'll continue to make great pinball designs for the world.

[07:41] Let's talk about Houston because I know that was a big moment.

[07:45] And I know you guys struggled on whether or not it was too early to show.

[07:49] We'll talk a little bit about it.

[07:51] And timing when it comes to showing stuff before stuff's available to buy.

[07:55] But as far as a show went, Robert, what kind of feedback did you get?

[07:59] And have you been reading the feedback around your game on the forums?

[08:03] No, when I left Pennside in July, it was probably the greatest thing that I've ever done in pinball this far.

[08:11] It's an absolute sewer.

[08:15] And I want to say that I'm not going to be able to do it.

[08:19] I'm going to be a sewer.

[08:21] And I want nothing to do with it.

[08:23] So any report I get from Pennside, a immediately disregard.

[08:27] However, I will say that my team, and there were quite a few deep root members there, are so grateful for all the people who came to Houston and played the game and gave positive comments.

[08:39] As well as constructive criticism.

[08:41] And we've written all that down.

[08:43] We're analyzing it and assessing it.

[08:47] And I think that's because we didn't explain what Raza was, what it was meant to be, what it was not meant to be.

[08:53] And because of its prototype state and what it will become, some of the comments, I think, could be disregarded just for the fact that they're irrelevant.

[09:01] And when the full package is seen, that will become more evident.

[09:07] But we're grateful for those comments.

[09:10] And it's nice to have those real concrete things in the world that people can now have constructive comments.

[09:16] Comments rather than assuming to know it.

[09:20] Right. Well, and there's a mixture of comments.

[09:22] And just because you know me, I have to live on Pennside or I don't have much content for the show.

[09:27] There's a mixture of comments from those who have played the game at Houston.

[09:32] And so those people obviously have an advantage to share an opinion because they've actually played the game.

[09:38] But we also know the forum loves to give feedback, even if you've never played the game.

[09:42] Do you have you instructed though anyone on the deep roots that because people have, and I'll say this Robert, people have, who played the game left some very detailed feedback.

[09:54] And I think most of it is very positive.

[09:56] So I think if you did take a peek, you would be pleasantly surprised that most people enjoyed playing the game at the show.

[10:02] So does anyone, is anyone trolling Pennside on the deep group team?

[10:07] I mean, I know Dennis is on their Dennis Normans on there, even in the thread, I think.

[10:11] And so is David.

[10:14] I haven't heard from either one of them as to what they posted or what they saw.

[10:19] I don't believe that anyone from the immediate team that I would normally get feedback is reading Pennside.

[10:25] I think that they feel pretty much the same way that most of the feedback is useless.

[10:30] I have heard quite a few of the pinball shows, and I think that right now without the proper frame of reference that I think a lot of the comments are all over the place and that a lot of what might be considered negatives are things that don't have perspective.

[10:45] Right.

[10:46] And assumptions are being made.

[10:47] And I think on the other side of that there's a lot of positive comments.

[10:50] I know there's two or three that I've heard that definitely I'm thinking about making some modifications to, to, to the game for a final.

[10:59] Right. Yeah, let's talk about that. So what kinds of feedback did the deep root team at Houston receive?

[11:06] Was it, you know, what kind of things did you hear?

[11:10] So I'm in Utah right now.

[11:12] So I'm not in San Antonio where, you know, the team members are.

[11:16] So I plan to get back there soon before the Thanksgiving break and get a more full report, but from the comments that I received over the weekend via, you know, email, etc.

[11:27] I think that a lot of the comments coming back were very positive.

[11:33] I think that the machines basically kept up with the pace and the pounding better than I ever expected.

[11:43] And so I can't be happier to hear that most of the comments were, hey, we like this. We like this. Why did you do this?

[11:52] It's like that versus more negative things on, hey, I can't get up the ramp or, you know, it doesn't look like it has any innovations or, you know, this is way too, there's not enough flow.

[12:03] Those, those are just perspective issues that people don't really understand the foundation of what Rosy is and what it's meant to be.

[12:12] And I will completely understand and those because we haven't explained yet what Rosy is and what it's meant to be.

[12:19] Right. Now let's talk about the ramp just a little bit because that was, I think it's one of the most visually stunning things in the game.

[12:27] And we, and Jay pop, when it comes to ramps, Oli seems to try to push the envelope, right? Of what's possible with a ramp and a pinball game.

[12:36] And so I think the feedback was like the ramp is really cool. It just became enough power to get up the ramp. Is that something with the show?

[12:45] Did you guys turn the power down at all in the flippers or were you testing different flipper powers or will it be easy for people to hit that ramp and go all the way to the top or is that is it supposed to be something where you only hit it, you know, maybe half the time.

[12:59] Yeah, correct. The purpose of the ramp is to be difficult.

[13:03] This is not a flow game that all the other competitors keep for speeding down with family out sin and everything else this.

[13:11] I let Jay pop for the most part, you know, 80% of this is his passion, his homage to a bunch of other games and to this weird quirky kind of narrative, right?

[13:23] And so what we've done with him and with all of our other designers is try to stand out of the way and let them, you know, just pour their passion out in that theme on that plate field and take back those things and refine those things that really need to be refined.

[13:39] The ramp has never been discussed internally. It's supposed to be hard.

[13:44] I know before both games left for Houston, one ramp was a lot easier to make than the other.

[13:51] And when asked whether I wanted the other one tweaked, I said no because I wanted to get some real world data on the difference and the tolerances.

[14:01] And the problem with pinball is you right now is you typically have to talk about the location situation, right?

[14:07] I played the game and this was working and this wasn't working and we don't know if it was, you know, out of leveled or leveled at all and, you know, this might have been broken and stuff.

[14:16] And so what we want to do with deep root is we want to try to have the most consistent play amongst all our games and all different environments.

[14:24] And so as a result, I made the decision to keep those ramps at different tolerances to kind of understand even at full power and the flippers were at full power the whole time.

[14:37] What the shots would look like and whether, you know, one third success rate is good or whether we needed to make some adjustments and go for more of 50 or 60%.

[14:49] But, you know, in house, we've made the tolerances in multiple levels to where you always make it into where it's much more difficult.

[14:57] And so because this game is a precision game at that end of the spectrum, something that really hasn't been done a lot in recent years, instead of a flow game.

[15:07] We decided to keep the foundation and purpose of the game, a precision game, meaning that it's not meant for a lot of beginners.

[15:15] It's meant for people who have ball control and have to work to get that flow and work to hit up that ramp and to get the benefits because when you do believe me, it is a satisfying feeling.

[15:26] Right. And we heard that from people when they when they nailed it, it was a very satisfying shot. Let me, let me ask you about that, though. So you're in terms of who this game is designed for. Are you saying it's designed more for a pretty medium to good level pinball player or versus the novice.

[15:46] Absolutely, all of our games and today, you know, we went over the first 21 games that we have planned over the next few years.

[15:53] Every game is going to be different. It's going to be to a different demographic. It's going to have a different theme, different style, different types of mix, different play requirements.

[16:04] It's going to have different rule sets and all of those things going go into the deeper package, the deeper portfolio.

[16:12] And Raza is just the first one that we've showed just because it was really the first one we took most of the way.

[16:19] And so this is a J-pop game. It is very quirky. It's weird. It's whimsical. It's not an easy shooter for, let's say, a beginner.

[16:28] This is for someone who can do some ball control and not just bat it away as most people do and can control the ball and create flow on their own and make shots when they need to make shots.

[16:42] And the great thing about Steve Bowden and Quikton is that they've done a great job of creating some simple rules for when beginners do get on so they can feel satisfied and get the zombie and maybe get a multi ball, etc.

[16:56] Maybe three to five minute ball time. But this game is really going to be the most satisfying by intermediate or people who have little ball control to advance tournament players that really can precision shoot a lot of these shots.

[17:11] Okay, that's really interesting because we haven't really seen another company sort of openly design a game for someone with a higher skill level.

[17:22] But as you were saying, so you said 21 titles. I have to go back to that. So how far along are you in development of those 21 titles? I mean, that's a lot. So when people hear that number, are you guys, is that like two, three years down the road?

[17:38] How many titles a year? I know, Robert, we I don't want to get trapped into like a number per year, but like how far along are you with that many titles in development?

[17:47] I would say 13, we're probably 50% or more. And the others were probably 25. Well, maybe as low as 10 to 15, but 25 to 50%.

[17:59] We haven't sat around on our hands the last few years and just done Raza. We've been very busy. And I think that it's going to help make each of these titles that come out the best that they are for what they're meant to be.

[18:13] Right. And we understand that's not going to come out just yet until launch. And you know, everyone can see why we're doing what we're doing.

[18:21] But Raza has its special place, right? It's got a lot of history, both positive and negative. And so it was a great opportunity to have a J-pop theme like that.

[18:32] Finally, see the light of day in a more final form and really get something that is more precision play than flow being tested on location.

[18:41] And so we can really see that a harder game like this, how are people going to approach it?

[18:46] Right. What's the positive history on Raza? If you don't mind me asking because it, you know, it didn't really develop back in the day.

[18:54] Yeah, I think Raza is an homage. I mean, this is J-pop's as any designer would do and have done before. This is his homage to, you know, Asseler and like Hurricane and Cyclone to, you know, Zombie.

[19:10] Zombie slash, you know, kind of 50s weird alien kind of homage that we've seen a little some other games like, you know, Tech from Mars, et cetera.

[19:19] This is just a quirky kind of J-pop on a plate sort of game.

[19:24] And I can tell you I played it when it played like crap and I played it where it plays more like better like what we showed in Houston.

[19:32] And the game is, it's fun to me, you know, I appreciate what J-pop puts into his games and the shots there and making me a better player by being more precision than flow.

[19:42] Because as I said before, I kind of like flow, but beginners like flow because it's easy. It's mindless. It's, it's like, you know, playing game on your, and Zombie out on your, on your phone.

[19:51] And this is more of a quirky precision shot type game. And so I'd love different types of games. That's why Williams Valley days with all the different designers and all the great teams and elements and world under class that are so beloved.

[20:04] They're so different. Right. Is that each one was its own world, its own game plan. You stand over it and you look at the inserts and the artwork and the, and the lanes and the mix and you go, wow, how am I going to approach this game versus the last game.

[20:18] And so, you know, if you stand over Raza and see it for what it is, right, as a J-pop game, a part of the D-proof portfolio, I think that you'll have a lot of appreciation for it.

[20:29] If you compare it to sort of what I consider the lackluster and thoughtless kind of titles that we've seen recently from, from other competitors, I think that you missed the point.

[20:41] So that's, that's what we want to convey.

[20:44] Something that, yeah, I want to, what you just said, I want to ask you a question about that because something that was said back in May was basically, and I want to pull up, I have the actual commentary.

[20:58] I just want to read it word for word because I just think it's interesting to compare what we saw at Houston to, you said that you did not want to compete with other pinball manufacturers and churn out the outdated and uninspired pinball packages, right, as, as a scene in the market today.

[21:17] And I know that you said that the prototype we would see is on par, right, with where company games are today, right.

[21:24] So I guess the question, Robert, is just, is there going to be, how are you going to sort of fill in the gap between this prototype and sort of delivering on that innovation?

[21:37] And I think that leap forward, people were expecting to see at Houston. So is there going to be a big leap forward with the final product?

[21:45] I think it's tough sometimes. You know, I will say that I promised a lot and I think over time a lot will be delivered and appreciated for what it is, but the problem in pinball is it's dysfunctional.

[21:59] And people sometimes lose the force for the trees. There's a lot of, it's sort of a microcosm of the greater age of outrage that we have in society as a whole.

[22:11] And it's much more magnified in pinball. And I'm sure there's going to be haters of deep roots, haters of what we've designed and they don't think it's innovative enough.

[22:22] And I think that there will be other people who can't wait to pay money to have their homescriced by a different take on pinball.

[22:31] And that's what we're about is it's completely different takeover fully of games. So in a year from now after we've, you know, released a couple of games,

[22:39] you can see sort of what we're doing. I think that that's a great question to come back to and maybe see what you think and what how the pinball community thinks about how we're approaching both designing and creating a portfolio of deeper games that each one or innovative in of itself, but, but, you know, kind of come together as a, as a very unique coach podge portfolio.

[23:02] Right. Something I said in one of my shows recently was this does feel and it is it's a J-pop game, right? And he's been working on this game for a while. Is it fair to say, Robert, that this game, Raza, you guys, you guys actually unraveled what's in John's mind and made a working game, which is a miracle in itself, if you followed the Zidweer story.

[23:22] Would you, is it fair to say that this is, you know, you sort of gave John a platform to get a working game out there that has all of J-pop's quirkiness, but this isn't the full representation of what deep route will be a year from now.

[23:39] Yeah, I think it really depends. It's sort of like, you know, when people equate my comments for Ferrari and, you know, a Pinto, they quit that with lowest price ever, right?

[23:49] They don't equate that with how I mint it and how I've, you know, continued to clarify where we talk about value at every level.

[23:55] So I think in answer to your question here about J-pop and Raza, I think it really depends on how you define and how you look for innovation, right?

[24:06] The game, as you saw it,

[24:09] so on, you know, sort of the play field artwork, which is not the final play field artwork, and definitely the cabinet artwork is, was just placeholder.

[24:17] Most of the max, most of the layout is 95% complete.

[24:22] And so when we talk about innovations, it might not be, hey, there's this groundbreaking thing that's on the play field and it's never been seen before because there's maybe one or two on there.

[24:31] It's sort of the whole world, right? It's putting these homage and all of these things that were unique on all these other games together in one playable package and experience, this user experience is what we're after.

[24:45] Rather than, rather than talking about innovations, now, one of the innovations that we're talking about will be internal, will be aesthetically looking in the cabinet, and will be how deeper games are used for decades to come.

[25:00] And so, the innovations were not on this package, were not on display in Houston. But as far as Raza, the game is concerned, 95% of what you saw less the artwork and toys will be in the final Raza cabinet.

[25:16] Gotcha. And so the cabinet itself, is that the deep root cabinet or no?

[25:23] Not the deeper cabinet. It's something that was we wanted to do to be familiar, though I do like because they did the silo and looking kind of grill, because they know I'm in the battle star galactica.

[25:36] And I thought it looked really, really sexy. But it would not make our final deeper package.

[25:45] Okay. If we ever released a package like this, it would be a lower end model that would be stripped down for price only.

[25:55] Well, and that's the thing I've been calling people, you know, me on my show, I call everybody suckers on the show, but I've been calling people crazy for thinking this thing a J-pop game, which I've always looked at J-pop games as sort of works of art that are playable that are like to your point, just kind of quirky, different, and it's J-pop.

[26:14] Like it writes hard to even explain. But he was, you know, these games were selling for a lot of money when he was only making a hundred Raza's and we know magic grow was selling for 16,000.

[26:25] Are people way out of bounds when they think this thing's going to come in at the price of a Stern pro or lower?

[26:32] I think that I'm frustrated.

[26:37] I understand how some people kind of viewed my comments about value to mean that we're going to sell all of our games for 3,000 bucks, which is why I've continued to clarify that it's about value rather than price.

[26:58] Right. And I'm frustrated that our game at Houston in the shape it was was likely had more value in it than a $15,000, you know, Elvira signature edition and maybe with some touch ups, a collector's edition, wonka.

[27:15] And so for people to say, well, it's not going to be worth anything unless, you know, it's it's it's priced as a Stern pro, I think is a problem because we have had for years now penball consumers throw crazy amounts of money for no value at all.

[27:33] And yet they expect deeper to put all of this value in there and expect us to to to cheap it and out right and we're not we're not deserving of charging more money.

[27:44] And so it puts us in a very difficult position of how we approach marketing and how we approach pricing and our competitors in determining what we're going to do at the end of the day.

[27:56] Right. And so I'm personally going to make that decision and I'm digesting how pinball consumers are are using their money and I'm going to make a decision about about what they're doing and what we're doing and, you know, where the competition is and and where those price points are going to be at the end of the day.

[28:14] Right.

[28:15] Right. Let me I want to give you a little advice because I think it would help. I do think a lot of your buyer base might be on the forum of pinside because they are the enthusiasts and the collectors as well because that's the other question I have is we see games and you brought up a buyer and I've been slamming a virus signature edition for a really long time right people paid $5,000 more and got nothing in the game and yet it sells out in a few hours and it it it almost it almost leads me to believe that pinball.

[28:44] Buyers and collectors don't deserve much if they run after that stuff so as you're looking at it Robert one of the I think key factors in sort of figuring out where you price a game is how many of the games you make right so in your mind are you thinking about this J pop game as a mass market game or as a game that you'll keep limited and almost like a special rare thing for the discerning J pop.

[29:13] So in this respect I'm going to keep some things close to my chest and wait for the reveal because there'll be a more meaningful marketing plan and why we're going to price and in additions that we might have and you know in each of these titles as we get there but I'll answer it this way.

[29:38] I think that each title has its own purpose in this world and it has its own audience and its own consumer base and something like a J pop game which has a lot in it I think should be priced accordingly and what we're trying to do is we're trying to price things according to the value they bring in the grand scheme of the entire market.

[30:06] And so there will be some games that will be priced very high and we'll see if the market is receptive to that and if not then we'll make adjustments and we might price things well under market and we'll have to raise the price just because we won't be able to keep up with supply with demand.

[30:21] But as far as you know as what you're going into what you're you know discussing as far as how we view pricing and value in the grand scheme of things.

[30:35] It's hard for me to say any more about that given how pinball consumers are actually spending their money right now because it is counterintuitive and it's very difficult to make that decision right now.

[30:50] Without getting a few months down the road and seeing if they're going to continue to spend their dollars in the same way that they have been the last half of this year.

[30:58] Right now and we talk a lot on this show about the hype window right and and you've you must watch how stern does it how Jersey Jack does it how spooky does it everyone has a different approach in terms of how to create that sort of feeding frenzy when a game becomes available for sale.

[31:18] And so I'm just curious to see how you guys do it be happy to talk off line Robert to give you some some of my thoughts on it because I do think this J pop game.

[31:28] I think you're right I think it's a unique game that has a unique target and it's not necessarily a mass market game.

[31:36] And I think if you hit the right target with the right amount of games at the right price it becomes something special in the pinball world versus something that's just you know there's too many of them and then it doesn't feel like you have to get one and then all of a sudden you're like dead on arrival with with with the game reveal.

[31:54] Question for you so what was the decision to put Raza in front of magic girl.

[32:00] We have something very special plan for magic girl and the the time and the money that it's going to take to accomplish that doesn't make sense in the early launch months of deeper.

[32:18] Okay and so and the same goes for Alice and Wonderland and so Raza became an easy and easy first option along with a couple of other titles to start with for that very reason and you're right I mean I don't think that we're going to launch Raza and sell you know thousands of Raza's you know that's just just not going to happen it is it is a more niche game.

[32:45] But it's going to be a beloved game by enough pinball consumers to you know to profit and pay for the development time of it and to move on to the next title right some of which to the very first titles will be very large volume sellers okay and so what it's not lost on us that Raza is a very unique start and it's not meant to launch you know deeper and suddenly make us you know profitable and pay back all the years of R.D.

[33:14] It's not what it's meant to do right question about the game in terms of do will there be multiple tiers of Raza or one version.

[33:25] All of our games will have one to three versions okay but it will be different than what any of the other competitors are doing right now in what way think right right now we have like the pro premium Ellie model right you've got the pro which strip stuff out you've got the premium Raza and you know what I'm going to do is

[33:42] strip stuff out you've got the premium Ellie which is normally the same game with with just cosmetic differences so you're saying you'll take a different approach to that if you have three tiered.

[33:54] Yeah each title will be treated differently and some of them we might just have one tier and some of them we might have up to three tiers but the tiers I think and I hope will be seen as a more fair and valued approach to people on deciding which of those might be the most important.

[34:12] It might be there with like a two in three tier one wait you might actually give us like unique code inside a game that costs 3000 more.

[34:20] I think that that would be the simplest and easiest and most fair for us to do I think that there will be a lot more that will be involved in giving pinball consumers value upon value more than they could have ever imagined right and the most important question for in 2019 will there will there be a top or included with Raza or part of the Raza package.

[34:42] I think that might be a tier of Raza that would have a top or that I absolutely flipped out when I saw the engineering model of awesome flipped out positive way yeah yeah no we need to hoppers so Robert you talk a lot about and I know we're probably going to see more of this but the innovation happening underneath the game that we haven't seen yet are are what can we expect are these games going to be easier to service are they going to be more reliable is it are we going to have to.

[35:12] I put the soldering iron away forever like any yeah tell me without spoiling your your review I yeah all of the above and I said this in a recent interview is that when I first got my Williams Valley collection I had tons of questions about why this why that why is it so hard how do I need to learn how to solder vertically why does this keep breaking why to leave switch a suck you know and and don't work even if they're brand new.

[35:42] Why is this you know type of meck used why why is this unreliable most of the time why does this machine at my house play like this but I go to my office and play the same title and it can place you know place completely different I think all of these frustrations and observations that I had and and in working with you know been heck and Charlie and J pop in Dennis and and Greg Ferris in the early years and talking with them about their thoughts and stuff.

[36:12] Help to me over time get to the point where we started in 2017 with a deeper package plan that went from thoughts and innovations high in the sky you know buying this guy sort of stuff to actually a real business plan that we've been working on for years and while it's a mystery there were a lot of innovations in those two games in Houston that people did not see and will not see that we needed to test we need to really see are these going to be.

[36:42] At the level that deep route in our warranty and how we back games are they going to be there and I can only say that that the feedback I got was everyone was just you know blown away with how well things stood up we have some you know action points that we need to continue to work on a refine over the next few months but we're really happy about it right.

[37:02] Let's talk lighting so I heard some feedback that the games were a little bit dark at Houston will the deep route cabinets will they address the lighting things we hear all the time in this hobby right how you know I it's amazing that pin stadium is such a big business model going on how easy it seems to to light up a cabinet with with an LED strip what are we going to see unique lighting in the deep route platform.

[37:29] Yeah, that was the first one of the first things that I I put into the deep group package years ago and it's one of many things that just comprised the package that we've tried to do standard to try to improve the user experience.

[37:45] Okay, and the artwork on rasa now we I thought we were going to see just like a white wood with like mex on it I didn't even think we'd get as much as we got at Houston so who's doing the art package for rasa.

[38:00] Yeah, all of the art animations done by the very talented folks up in Utah that are in deep route studios.

[38:10] Okay, and the artwork that we got from Matthew and Jeremy was was pretty much a hack job and so as we re looked at the narrative for rasa specifically we basically took out what wasn't working from a 2d perspective on the playfield and reinserted the new narrative and characters etc.

[38:32] And we did the same with a lot of the artwork that Matt did Matthew did and touched it up created you know additional artwork that needed to be there and believe it or not internally rasa artwork is a complete hack job because because of that but I think that most people as I saw and I think that I would personally my personal opinion would be it's still better than any other animations I've ever been on a pinball machine.

[38:58] And so we've continued to refine the rasa package you know I my favorite of the three artwork packages that we have behind the scenes right now is called nebula that's the that's the you know the the R&D name for it and I really love it and I think that some other people like one of our other types of artwork and so it's going to be very interesting coming down because I'm very much against

[39:27] using artwork to sell pinball machines and so the question is are we going to allow and offer multiple artwork packages for for customers or not and that's something that's still up in the air and we'll probably make a decision on that right before launch.

[39:43] But we have some great art packages to look at the one that was seen at Houston was a very early edits that was done back in 2000 at the end of 2017 so it is something to put on there to kind of get some basic ideas about what's on the play field as far as art but there has been a lot more refinement of that artwork and the plastics around it.

[40:10] What do you mean a hack job though because people did really like the zombie Yeti work that he did I know the big issue was like there's a lot of IP infringement you had Robbie the robot you had the attack from Mars you had Godzilla was on the I think on you know on the play field and cabinet artwork.

[40:26] Did you just mean like the quality we're going to see is going to be above and beyond that.

[40:32] Well I think you saw some of the early changes that we made to to Jeremy's our package right on the play field and Jeremy is a great 2D artist and with strong lines and stuff like that and so what we tried to do was

[40:52] and all that he made to try to pay homage to what he started but change the world and the narrative as we needed to do to as we continue to develop the Rosalew world.

[41:02] Okay now interesting so you're saying that you guys are actually considering there might be an opportunity for a consumer this has never been done before to actually pick possibly the play field artwork that goes on the machine they order.

[41:16] I think there's going to be a lot of customizations that consumers will will have with deeper the deeper package.

[41:25] Okay very cool I mean that hasn't been done before in terms I guess you know probably the main reason is when it comes to ordering parts which is something have you run into that because I think the biggest the next big question is manufacturing right I mean it's always the it's always the elephant in the room when it comes to launching a pinball company.

[41:45] At what stage Robert do you have to tell people pencils down we now need to transition into how do we manufacture these or have you been planning for manufacturing all along that you won't run into the same issues that other companies have when it's come to manufacturing pinball machines.

[42:04] Yes I answered in a recent interview the same question so let me let me make two points about that in rear to right first manufacturing always has the same foundational issues right.

[42:16] And those dealing with inventory and problems you didn't expect and problems you did and waste and labor and and cost and delays and all of those things are always going to be there we can try to minimize them by using many engineering pipeline and manufacturing processes.

[42:32] Or processes or theories or or stuff like that.

[42:38] That aside that every manufacturer has to deal with we are from the beginning and everything we've done try to.

[42:48] So we use you know the the step gate process and a lot of what we do from an engineering standpoint what we try to do is look at as we go through the gates.

[42:59] What is going to be required for manufacturing going through the analysis of how it will look what will be there what do we need to minimize how do we need to design something now to minimize for instance waste and other complications and inventory problems.

[43:16] So all of that has been going all this time through all these years and talking about the entire process and while I've had fun with quad manufacturing and octo manufacturing and stuff like that.

[43:27] It doesn't take away from the real work we've been doing behind the scenes to try to minimize some of those very real and very common things that happen in the manufacturing process.

[43:39] Okay. Now when does is manufacturing set up right now or when do you expect to give it a test run right at what point do you actually have to get the line going and get all of those people who are going to be building these games.

[43:55] So you know making them to see if you guys can do it in a timely manner.

[44:00] I think that's tough because a lot of what we've done even including you know building the games for Houston we've been testing out different assembly and manufacturing techniques.

[44:11] We've been timing things we've been making notes of what's working and what's not working.

[44:15] We're refining engineering and you know because for manufacturing line you typically have to boil down the instructions to a fourth grade level.

[44:24] For especially for the assembly process we've been doing that to make sure that we could pay to align worker you know what needs to be done what tolerances are okay and what's not okay.

[44:34] What's special with this game that we know is a problem going into the manufacturing process that needs special attention and extra tender love and care.

[44:43] And so all of these things we've been doing along the way so some of our assembly and some of our heavy manufacturing is already set up and we're testing and we're refining things and some of it is not.

[44:55] And I think as we turn the year and start to finalize a lot of those things to start to run consistency and tolerance tests through a line we're going to find out really quick and be able to what's working what's not working in the final kind of approach.

[45:11] And start to make those those edits but it I'm not diluting myself that we will not through the end of 2020 continue to refine the manufacturing process and deal with problems both that we can catch in house and even things that might go into you know consumers houses and trying to refine that process and make it better and better.

[45:39] And that's what we're about is delivering the best valued product that's consistent and built well for decades to come to the consumers and we're going to work very hard to make sure that happens and as my comments about play fields have been very clear where I stand on that we're going to back it up with with with our pledge and our money in our time.

[46:03] So the the sledgehammer comment is no no no Chris we need to go to jackhammers now jackhammer not getting that but you said it but you also said recently it is made out of wood so yeah okay I'm trying to figure out how this is going to work.

[46:18] I think I think a lot of the play field and clear code issues that come up I think there's been some some crazy comments by people who thought they were experts and I think that there's been actually some very thoughtful comments that have come out and I think that both the type of wood the age of the wood the type of wood or substrate being used how it's processed prior to the clear code how the clear code is processed and what type of clear code and and how you know.

[46:48] Well i'm not going to go into any more detail and give away some of our secrets but and then how how that's cured and the time to consumer it were simply and then to consumer all of those things play into it it's not like it's one thing it is a grand recipe that's why you could have a thousand people you know pick a chocolate cupcake and all of them will taste slightly different some will be better than others.

[47:13] Because it's it's the entire ingredients that go together and are then baked into a luscious cupcake right now are you are you guys making your play fields or are you outsourcing to someone who you feel confident can deliver.

[47:28] You know the most premium product when it comes to play fields because that's been a huge issue for people in 2019 that has people holding on to their money so okay.

[47:38] First i'm i'm confused by consumers who continue to be outraged by it yet continue to spend money on it i understand they don't have a lot of other options at this point but still it's not like you have to go out and just let money you know burn a hole in your pocket and just blow it.

[47:56] When you have and you will have a lunch banner option to go to so on the one hand i'm kind of confused by that is i study you know the market and consumer you know psychology and why they're doing what they're doing but on the other hand.

[48:10] We're determined to to live by the standard that we're setting and by by using what because would it still the best in my opinion the only real option for a pinball play field surface and we're going to continue to to refine that in house to make sure that when we put a good warranty on it and we take a hammer to it.

[48:31] And of course i was joking about you know the sledgehammer and the jackhammer but even a hammer to it to show how we develop and engineered our play field to withstand those common things that you're going to get with every other competitor by doing it in house whereas before we were going to go with Mirko i'll just be honest with it but after the latest viasco i just can't i can't trust and there's not just Mirko right i know he's trying and he's got a really nice process set up and you know it's just.

[49:01] it's a it's a whole recipe of issues but we can't we can't let that happen with deeper it's got to be brought in house it's got to be done right and you know Sean Gibson who is you know one of my greatest assets has spent years.

[49:18] Thinking and developing and testing how we're going to do this and many of the options he's brought to me all with stand hammer strike the fact when we got the mere code boards and one of them was at Houston.

[49:30] They pulled them out you can still smell the clear and i said give me a hammer and i took a hammer to it and oh my goodness it was the crater it was just a crater i mean there was no there's no missing it and so i then took out one of Sean's test play fields.

[49:47] And slammed it with a hammer and not a dent you couldn't even see that i hit it are we never going to have dimples on a deep root game.

[49:55] Well what's funny is you could basically draw our test is and i don't know what's exact height it's a couple of inches but that's the equivalent of the greatest force that could come down with a pinball as it slaps against the glass or something else on the thing and i can tell you from the first time we plunged a ball on the mere code boards are you you plunge it on a spooky game.

[50:16] Spooky game a stern game an AP game or anything you're going to get instant dimples and or JGP game etc and with our play field tests we we basically with hammer don't even get a dimple we don't get a scratch we don't get a scuff we don't get anything and that's the type of deeper quality that we want to provide.

[50:37] I think that's i think that's music to everyone's ears and it's amazing to me how so much because you know this Robert people collect these things and they spend a lot of money on them and as you talk about the value proposition.

[50:49] Having a play field that's not going to fall apart in front of your eyes sometimes right out of box for some of these new games coming out has been.

[50:58] No no Chris it's worse than that I guarantee you pull any manufacture right now whether they're doing it in house or not.

[51:05] And you drop a ball from three inches which is probably less than what the strongest strike could be every one of them will dimple and i'm sorry that's an engineering defect and deeper is not going to put up with that and we're just going to be different and we'll let them continue to to turn those play fields out whether they do them in house or whether they try to engineer better and we hope they do but.

[51:27] Deeper will be different and i'm making my company on those those types of values and quality propositions for consumers and then ball Robert do you do you feel like you have your George Gomez over at deeper like the guy that's sort of.

[51:43] Seeing all these moving parts and and has experience knowing what it takes to sort of foresee the hurdles in pinball and is just keeping everything going.

[51:53] I think I have a lot of different types of people I mean I think that I know you've mentioned it and other people kind of see that there's there's one or two people that that basically have to keep the ship you know formation at the tight you know and what I find and is very difficult in my and what I do is I get everyone information then I look the other direction and they've come out of formation and I get them back information I look back where I was and they've come.

[52:22] It's a constant yo yo and you know I'm not going to take credit for for much in deeper because I have an amazing staff people in Texas and in Utah and contractors across the country that do an amazing job but at the end of the day there has to be the captain there has to be the someone that does that that understands the buck stops here.

[52:45] That is willing to say no and is willing to say yes and is is basically there to to motivate people and the threatened people right and to challenge people and to reward people and that at this point has has landed on my desk and sometimes it's very difficult and sometimes it's very easy but it doesn't take away from the very talented people at every aspect of a deeper tech and deeper pinball and deeper studios that are pounding out a maze.

[53:14] They're pounding out amazing things on a daily basis and that have passion and that are there you know to create the best pinball experience ever created for for the pinball community right.

[53:26] So how are how are the investors feeling right now are they are they on board for the long run because it's been longer than there are no investors in pinball and this this is what I mean I just let people just spout off right.

[53:39] Nobody understands how we work and and the more they try to act like they're the experts on everything the more I laugh because the the more wrong and ass and I they sound so there are no investors in pinball.

[53:53] It's it's it's company money it's it's my money and you know I find that you know even when people say well oh my gosh you know they're blowing all this a month and they're never going to be able to make a packet I just I just laugh because it's obvious that the more they do that they are going to make a packet.

[54:08] The more they try to convince themselves and others about all of this the the less they they're in reality there's some other universe and yet the other day it's not their money right.

[54:20] Robert a year from now what do you hope people think and feel about deep root pinball.

[54:27] I hope that the people who want to care can see that we came through and we delivered some amazing experiences very different unique experiences but but experiences and that they're excited about everything new that we bring to the market that we're not going to come out with the same experience over and over again.

[54:52] Everything will be fresh everything will be new and but at the core is that value in that quality that we want to keep for decades to come.

[55:02] And in terms of the other designers who can you tell us whose game we might see next after J pop.

[55:11] Yeah I think that I want to be fair to all the designers because all of their games are very unique to to that designer right.

[55:19] And all of them want their games out there and they want the praise and the law etc that comes with it and you know everyone interested from the beginning that J pop scheme would be first and but they're all different right.

[55:32] John Norris still works for another company and he's still you know just us pinball in in his spare time and so as a result you know there might not be as much coming from John Norris.

[55:43] Dennis Orman has some great designs coming I know he really wants them to see the light of day and they will very shortly and you know as well as just a machine I mean if he if I let him loose he could create a pinball machine design every month.

[55:57] So he's more of a machine and just gets the basics right and you know it just it feels like Barry right.

[56:04] J pop the same I mean it takes him a lot longer he's working on two other titles right now that are not magic role or Alice in Wonderland one's a licensed title once not and they're they're just classic J pop.

[56:17] And so all of these these different passions and and personalities that we saw back in the great William Balli days I want to bring back I want there to be very unique titles that that don't look like each other right there they they speak to that designers dreams and goals with that theme.

[56:37] So you know you talked a little bit about in 2019 there's a little bit of a period of you you've started this thing right you've you've decided to make a pinball company and there is there was that period of maybe anxiety of can we get this all done and I know you still have a road to go to get the game to production.

[56:57] What do you feel now do you feel remotivated coming out of Houston and you feel good that you're going to get those deadlines hit for for 2020 I think right now Robert you're saying a March reveal and then sometime shortly after they'll be rosas available to buy.

[57:15] At a minute of yes I don't know if i'm remotivated I know a lot of my employees are this it wasn't the only thing because there were a lot of other reasons why we did Houston instead of you know either backing out of it or not doing it and just waiting to launch.

[57:30] But I think one of the biggest most important things is as as the captain as a commander I needed to show my troops a win and and this was a win internally and morale is is is really high in texas right now and.

[57:45] And they deserve all the praise in the world for for pounding it out and meeting a deadline and showing off something I think that just blew off most people socks even if they don't want to admit it and so for me i think it's a little different for me it's the first of many steps to come and I feel relieved because there were a million things that could have gone wrong.

[58:08] You know and i'm not worried about the you know the crappy videos and the color problems because it was not meant to be any of that right and you know I I know I did watch a couple of them and they were the greatest and you know a lot of them were just adding the ball around and not showing it did I I look at you know Jeff.

[58:26] Jeff to all this is and he did a great job he's good player he showed what Rosy could really be if you if you have some good ball control on his Facebook Facebook you know video post and you know for me that was that was a win right he understood and other people who played it and we heard that feedback understood what they were doing what they're interested in what the concept of Rosy was and that was more precision and and knew how to approach it and so for me it was a relief because there was a million things that could have gone wrong but they didn't.

[58:56] We accomplished all of our goals and even more I got a reengined Jike's team we've got a couple months to we show the world what we're going to do and we're going to pick up on this excess and we're going to have another one and another one after that and another one after that and so relief is is really what I feel right now.

[59:14] Does does Rosy go back in the back now are we going to see it out on location again being tested over the next few months.

[59:22] You know that's a good question to be honest with you I I had even thought about it I hadn't intended to put it out but we might I don't know I think we got all of the the data testing and feedback that we really wanted so I don't see that there's any benefit from doing that but I don't know that that's a good question.

[59:44] I think you can you can send one to New York I'll happily put it in my bedroom Robert you know I thank you for taking the time we're right up upon the hour and I know that this has been a long road I know there's still some road to go before getting games out there walk us through what's next so the plan is to have a sort of media event in deep route auditorium right before tpf correct.

[01:00:13] That's correct now is that the beginning of some of speculated and I have to ask you as a marketer is that the beginning are those going to be five days of deep route starting in the middle of the week going through that Sunday.

[01:00:26] I think we will still have five days of deep route I think that it's very observant I think when I talk to Ed about tpf and unsure about whether we wanted to show up whether we wanted to launch around there it became more and more evident that we did not want to launch at tpf right.

[01:00:46] I know you're going to you're going to laugh as most people were look I have a lot of criticisms of our competition but I know how hard ten ball can be behind the scenes and I respect them and all the artists and the designers and the people who put so much work and effort and recently internally I apologize to some of my employees because we we heard someone who was a long time stern staffer and you know I made a comment during an internal meeting about about.

[01:01:16] One of the machines he had a neck and and I realized that sometimes you know I kind of get away with myself and and I forget that you know all the hardships and the struggles and the even the successes we've had internally are are I've been shared by companies who have failed and companies that still exist and so at the end of the day i'm going to continue to criticize where I see see problems but I also have to at the at the end of the day also respect the good things and the right things that a lot of these other manufacturers are doing.

[01:01:46] So our launch events and marches delay out the vision the plan.

[01:01:51] Okay.

[01:01:52] And and tpf just happens to be you know I seem on the cake that we get to go out and everyone just gets to just have fun and relax and just just enjoy the events rather than creating you know launch at the event and and being under that pressure.

[01:02:11] Right.

[01:02:12] Well Robert let me ask you because I think if someone listens to this and and I personally love your brazen candid note note no holds bar to approach to talking about your company but you know it might not seem necessary to go on the attack with the competition and just you know make your own amazing game and let it speak for yourself but what types of stuff are you impressed when you look at a stern pinball or Jersey jack pinball are there things that you can do.

[01:02:40] Are there things about those companies that you are impressed by and that might be worth emulating a little bit because they you know especially stern who's probably shipping 10,000 plus games a year what types of stuff to stern do that you think is is good.

[01:02:56] Yeah so let me let me preface that by I've paid stern tens of thousands of dollars for games I've paid Jersey jack tens of thousands of dollars for games and I've paid spooky tens of thousands of dollars for games.

[01:03:09] And so I've supported each of these manufacturers and as a personal customer and most of my opinions I've tried to frame when it comes to my experience with their machines as a as a customer of theirs you're right there's been some things that I've had fun with I mean all of these games are played either at my house or.

[01:03:29] At one of our two locations by our employees and left right and there also heavily hated and criticized for many of the very things that we're trying to solve in our deep brew package so it's not like where we're just you know spouting off and taking cheap shots we're we're going to walk the walk and I think that most of what we're going to show on our launch day is going to be point after point after point after point where we saw a weakness or something that the competition refused to fix or do.

[01:03:58] And we're doing it because it needs to be done and so at the end of the day you're right I take I take some shots at them and I think some of them they they write out deserve but at the end of the day I've also put my money where my mouth is by spinning a lot of time fixing those problems and also spending time supporting those companies and you know one of these days I hope you know some of those companies might support deeper and and by gave from us even if they don't I'm still going to buy their games for the games that makes sense.

[01:04:27] And one of your recent interviews you talked about licensing of your innovations and have you guys filed patents for things that you think other pinball companies are going to see and want to license from you guys.

[01:04:42] I think you know at the beginning that when you talk about almost 200 innovations as you break them down it's just not legally possible just just lock it all up so I think over time what we've done is looked at okay what what would make the most sense to launch it.

[01:04:57] So we're going to be talking about the things that are going to be the greatest competitive advantage to us that we would not want a competitor copying or we're doing something similar and I think that you know when you boil those down this probably down to you know 5 10 15 patents really depends how how you break them down.

[01:05:20] And we talk about licensing those I think you know I look I tried to get Charlie and Scott before they released TNA to kind of think about what we were doing it didn't work out and you know TNA is great I bought a TNA.

[01:05:32] We've had a lot of problems with it and you know we've spent a lot of time fixing it and stuff like that but at the end of the day Scott and Charlie did did an awesome thing they took a white wood that was pretty awesome they refined it.

[01:05:44] You know Charlie got it out and fulfilled all those orders and and kudos to them and I put my money around this I bought one right.

[01:05:51] And so as we look at this process we want to continue to look at those things as well and and take care of them.

[01:06:00] Right what internet connectivity is something that just keeps me like it's a it's a it's like innovation even though everything we have in our lives is internet connected is that going to be part of the deep root package.

[01:06:12] Yeah I think that and so many things that people go why wasn't that done before that just make so much sense I think those are things we have years ago.

[01:06:21] And while there have been some competitors and you're going to see that on launch day that might have beat us to the punch I think that our approach to it I think will be better approach and it will make more sense in a package of features rather than just this or that right.

[01:06:39] If you had to buy one new game today amongst what's currently available and I know you're a player and a collector Robert and you enjoy pinball who do you think is making the most fun games right now or like what's the best game you've played recently that at least you fall you enjoyed even though you might want to change stuff in this that but what what game do you say to your designers and like this is fun like let's capture the fun of this game but we can do better with innovation.

[01:07:08] Yeah that's a hard one I don't know if I had the time to get out and play a lot of the more recent games like Wonka I have not played I bought every other JJP game so I probably one of these days will buy a Wonka.

[01:07:25] Of course I as I said I already bought TNA we have two Batman 66s that look like the moon unfortunately but they play well.

[01:07:36] It is hard to talk about some of the others I I've heard lots of great things about Jurassic Park I've not been able to play it I I really haven't bought a lot of stones I really have been really motivated by a lot of what they've done and impressed by a lot of what they've done to really go out and buy it I mean some of the artworks nice but I'm not going to buy a pinball machine for artwork I'm going to buy it for you the full package and my problem is is if I see it dimple I'm going to see it.

[01:08:05] I'm a CD and if I see a dimple in that play feel I know every game I'm going to buy out there it's going to have it I'm just going to drive me nuts that I paid all that money and and I'm every time I go up to play I'm just going to see the moon.

[01:08:17] And so for me right now it's it's a big problem in buying you know other other manufacturers just because I know that one thing alone is just going to drive me nuts.

[01:08:26] Real quick on the artwork comment because you must see that these companies have been able with artwork alone right to sell games and to sell more expensive versions of games without changing anything mechanically are you still aiming though to have some of the most beautiful pinball machines ever released from an artistic standpoint.

[01:08:47] You know that that's almost like an impossible thing to do or ask right I mean because the beauty is in the eye of the holder.

[01:08:54] It has been very difficult you know I look I disagree with Christopher French's description you know on a recent podcast with you about about what happens I'm not going to sit there and I'm not going to say anything about it right I wish Christopher the best.

[01:09:10] And I think as artwork is amazing is very talented individual and that's all I'm going to say about that but what we've tried to do is is try to take from the greats that have put some great artwork out there but but really do our own thing and we have a lot of very talented people in deeper studios who I think have gotten you know what the core art requirements are for a pinball machine and try to make it their own.

[01:09:39] And so I think that with Raza we built upon and that's why it's a hack job we built upon what other artists in pinball did and so it was easy to follow the template in that theme but I think our second and third and fourth and so on those titles is going to be a good good measure of whether what deep roots art style will be and whether we measure up now some people are going to like it some people are not but let me tell you what I don't want anyone buying my machine.

[01:10:08] Because just because of art I would actually take offense to that.

[01:10:12] I want them buying it because it's the best value for the book and they can't stop playing it and they they want to part with their hard earns money to put that deep root machine in their house that would make me happy.

[01:10:25] But I one of our machines for artwork I would be very very upset if I heard someone say that.

[01:10:31] Is there any concern Robert that the market is becoming oversaturated with the amount of companies and titles.

[01:10:38] Sure I think I think that I want to stick away from talking about tactics of competition and I'll say this is that I think a lot of money has been unnecessarily spent over the last few years.

[01:10:55] I think space is very limited now and I think that we're heading towards some economic turmoil eventually.

[01:11:03] I would have guessed it would have been here already last year or this year but who knows when we might see another downturn in the economy and money gets tight again.

[01:11:11] What we're trying to do is provide and anticipate that and provide the best value for the book so when it happens consumers can say you know what I could buy the latest license or unlicensed title from this company.

[01:11:25] But you know the best thing for my buck is a deep root machine and so I'm going to spend my hard money there.

[01:11:31] And some extent you know I think pinball recession proof and I don't think that there's going to be a crash in pinball and the grand scheme of things I just think that there's going to be some honest competition and consumers are finally going to have a choice about where to put the harder money and I'm going to make the best case that we can for me and my company that deeper is where that money should go.

[01:11:54] When you look at where you want your company to be size wise are you going for something as big as a stern or Jersey Jack we know you're already bigger than spooky so well stern is very weak right stern is completely weak.

[01:12:09] And their model is very precarious and I know that they'll completely laugh but when you build up a structure like that you get weaker and weaker when that structure can't continue to be fed in the same way that that you've planned.

[01:12:27] And so we don't need to take away most of what do you mean but what do you mean by that what do you mean by that.

[01:12:34] The bigger you get the easier it is to fall I mean it's like building you know house of cards with an with an unsteady foundation right labor costs fixed costs you know park costs you know those are very very painful when you have a throttling and a variability of sales.

[01:12:57] And you see that with a lot of you know not only there but with the ggp as well and why they suddenly brought up these new titles are rehashed old titles and brought them out new and why they suddenly brought something out early and stuff what you just you see that their actions right.

[01:13:12] And so we want to do is we don't even want to worry about that because we're focused on a very different value proposition we're focused on different price points we're focused on different themes and different approaches to pinball.

[01:13:26] And so what we want to do is we want to be profitable on every title we want people to enjoy and want to continue playing our games and so when it comes to you know those comparisons and stuff like that you know I'm not really worried I hope stern continues to pound it and continues to sell the best they can and ggp and spooky you know I don't I don't see any benefit to anybody for those companies going out of business or for for a deeper to come in and crush them.

[01:13:53] I think that there's still plenty of a market and an opportunity for each of these companies to make the best star and argument they can to consumers and continue to innovate and to pound it and I hope they they when they see what we have I hope that they they go wow we need to catch up.

[01:14:07] Wow we need to do this you know because it keeps all of us honest and it makes a better pinball market for consumers.

[01:14:15] And as we always say on this show competition will always benefit the the consumer and we will see products get better and better the more people that come into this hobby to disrupt and to innovate all Robert I really want to thank you for taking the time I know you're not feeling 100% so I really do appreciate you spending an hour or hour 10 minutes on Canadian Spinball podcast.

[01:14:39] And we look forward to seeing the final product I might have to get a plane ticket hopefully I'm on the your little media list of for the deep route tour in March to see the reveal in the auditorium and I know people are waiting you know to see the final package of of Raza and to see what deep route pinball has in store for all of us any final words Robert before I let you go and recover.

[01:15:04] Yeah this will be the last interview I do before launch and I appreciate you you asking me on we've always had great conversations and you know we we have some good banter behind the scenes I want to I want to just say a couple things you don't mind I want to thank all of the hardworking people at deep route those who are still here in those that have left for other opportunities for everything they did to make use impossible and everything they're doing behind the scenes to to to drive innovation and I'm sure you know I'm sure you can do that.

[01:15:34] And have the passion to create the best pinball experience that we can provide to consumers. I want to thank all of the pinball media out there for for the good comments and the bad comments I even want to think even the most negative people in the world that that mainly the reason why I just won't go to Pennside anymore because you know their negativity makes us stronger and it forces us to really keep keep our eyes on the price and not be

[01:16:04] distracted and you know most most importantly I want to think the pinball community out there for for keeping pinball around as a finish vintage part of Americana and we're going to do our best to have our little stake in that community and do the best we can to to come through with a with a great launch.

[01:16:24] And lastly I want to say something special to those Zidware customers who went through the claims process and decided last July to to trust in deep route and to delay instead of take a cash out I told you I would take care of you and you better believe it's coming and I'm going to take care of you in grand fashion with VIP experiences for launch and for for T.P.F. and for getting what most people won't get and behind the scenes a look at

[01:16:53] what we're doing and I am very grateful for for those that were claimants for for trusting in us and and being willing to to be patient with us as we get everything ready to go.

[01:17:06] Can I get one of those VIP passes because I bought a magic girl for $23,000?

[01:17:11] I think that we're going to be handing out quite a few VIP passes to those people who to quite a few people who will be attending T.P.F. next year.

[01:17:20] I've spoken to Ed about it and he's stoked about what we want to do with the VIP room and more will be discussed on that later.

[01:17:29] Well Robert I think that was well said and and thank you again for coming on and you heard it here people the last interview before we see the big reveal of the deep route platform featuring retro atomic zombie adventure land from John Papaduc Jr.

[01:17:43] Robert thank you so much and have an amazing evening.

[01:17:46] Yeah you too Chris keep it up and stay motivated and pinball community needs you so I look forward to hearing many more podcasts to come from you and all the other great podcasters out there who try very hard to make a great product.

[01:18:00] Thank you Robert appreciate it.

[01:18:16] you
