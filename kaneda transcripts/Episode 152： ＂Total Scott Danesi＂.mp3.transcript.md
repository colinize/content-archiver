[00:00] When I find all of the reasons, maybe I'll find another way, find another day.

[00:11] With all the changing seasons of my life, living again right next time.

[00:21] Welcome to episode 152 of Canada's Pinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada. We're in New York City. It's Brenda's birthday today. Super excited for what I have planned for Brenda. If you're friends with her, if you know her, shoot her a happy birthday message on Facebook.

[00:42] I'm excited for the episode. I talked to Scott Dinesy about total nuclear annihilation. A big day for Scott yesterday. The order banks opened up. So we have a great talk about how he feels about that.

[00:53] I know I saw that Nate interviewed Scott on Coast to Coast Pinball. I'm like, what's up with that? I was supposed to talk to Scott last Friday. He said he was busy. Then I see Nate has an interview up before me. He scooped me. You did it. Nate scooped me. I'm happy. I'm happy to see more Coast to Coast Pinball interviews and more shows from Nate going up.

[01:10] I think it's a good thing. I really, really am happy Nate is back in the game. New episode up from head to head pinball from Ryan C. and Martin over there in Australia. I love that show as well. You guys should check it out. I'm going to do a couple news items. Then we'll get right to it. So news item number one is Jersey Jack Pinball going to be making a new guns and roses pinball machine. That's why you heard a little GNR to start this podcast.

[01:36] There's a photo circulating Joe Newhart from pinball star got slash and duff of guns and roses to play dialed in. So there's definitely a relationship there between some guns and roses members and Jersey Jack Pinball. I think slash owns a wizard of Oz. I remember seeing a picture of him with that machine.

[01:56] Does this mean GnR will return for a new machine? I would love it. I would love Jersey Jack to make a guns and roses pinball machine. I don't know if it'll happen. I don't know. I would love to have some Chinese democracy mixed in with some illusion and appetite and some lies. I still think GnR is the greatest band of all time. But I think if it does happen, it's going to be a few years out.

[02:20] If they were planning properly, they'd want that game out when guns and roses is doing their fair well not in this lifetime tour.

[02:30] So what else is going on in the world of pinball? I saw that an alien has started to ship. I felt so bad. This guy finally gets his alien machine. It's coming from coin taker and the glass shattered in the game. On delivery, he opens it up and the glass is all shattered.

[02:49] Now this is the second time we've seen the alien pinball machines arrive with the glass busted in the game. One arrived at T.P.F. with glass all busted. So I think you have to worry a little bit since there's only about 20 games that have gone out is something wrong in terms of how that glass is a too loose is a too tight.

[03:12] And why is the glass shattering? I don't know. Hopefully it's not going to be a problem that plagues more aliens as they go out to owners. But it is really good news that alien is going out the door. I want everyone who paid for their alien to get their alien. I think it is good that we're seeing games go out and that coin taker is getting some machines.

[03:35] Alright, so some other news updates and I got an email on this and I deserve to get my wrist slapped a little bit for not covering this news. Andy Tucker, thank you for listening to the show. And he's a kiss ali owner. And I totally glossed over the fact that there's new kiss ali code that's been released.

[03:53] But Andy hit me up to let me know that there's a bug in the code that he's waited a year and a half and there's the code is still buggy. And the bug that he found and he wrote me an explanation of it.

[04:05] So something with all the arrows light up when you're in a mode and then one arrow changes color to tell you what shot you have to hit. And apparently the bug is all the arrows stay white.

[04:17] So something's not changing color. So there's a bug in the kiss ali code. Look, the reason I don't cover kiss ali code. It's like covering Kevin Koolik.

[04:28] It's been forever and a day. I think Stern is giving up on this game. They still didn't code the cities into the game. And what do you I really don't honestly I feel like there's nothing really more to say about the fact that because Stern waited so long on kiss.

[04:46] They'll never get the excitement back into that game. They never will. There's just there's a window of opportunity to keep people excited on a property and people have moved on. So if you have a kiss. I think Stern abandoned you for such a long time.

[05:00] And it's just a real shame. It's a real shame. You know speaking of code. So do here's another rumor. I'm hearing here's another rumor. I'm hearing that lineman is not just coding Batman that lineman is coding another game.

[05:16] He is coding L. Virat 3. He is coding L. Virat 3. That's the rumor. That's the rumor that he's working on the game. He has white wood in his basement. Do you believe that rumor? I don't know if I believe it. That's what I heard.

[05:30] I know he's frustrated. I've heard from people that some of these frustrated it's taking so long. It has taken a really long time. But part of me is just like it's been eight months since he's had Batman 66 to work with. Does it really take that long to code a pinball machine?

[05:50] I don't understand that the thing is we know when he finishes it's going to be great. But when will that be? And will Batman wake up the way the walking dead woke up the way he was able to make Metallica great?

[06:05] That's the thing with Batman. You just don't know if the physical shots and the code will ever sync up to make Batman worth what people paid for Batman.

[06:16] That's something that continues to be on people's mind who own a Batman 66. I don't see many of them for sale though. I think owners are holding on. I think it's one of those things where you'd be dumb to get out now because if the code does become incredible and you sold your Batman, I think you'd regret it. Especially if you have an Ellie or super Ellie because those don't come up for sale hardly ever. I don't see them. I don't see people wanting to get rid of them.

[06:45] What else is going on? So rumors about next title. So here's the thing. It's the rumors about Christopher Franchi coming to Expo having a panel discussion about Batman art and his next game. Does that mean his next game will be there? I don't know what his next game is. It's within the rumor mill. It's either going to be Guardians of the Galaxy or it's going to be Deadpool. I would think one of those two or it's going to be Iron Maiden. I'm really just going down all the time.

[07:15] The titles that are rumored to be Stern's next. My guess is I think he's going to be on Guardians. I think it makes sense for Franchi's kind of artwork.

[07:24] And I, the rumor that I'm hearing, it's going to be a very, very detailed game. If you think Star Wars artwork was a little disappointing and you want to see more detail and hand drawn artwork, I can almost 100% guarantee you that what Christopher Franchi's next game delivers will be a world of art.

[07:44] So you won't be left with a lot of barren playfield Photoshop drag and drop stuff. I think I think Stern is going to turn the corner. I've been so down on Star Wars and I have my reasons why and you know that I'm not going to go into them again.

[07:59] But machines can be so much more. And I think we're hearing that. And I'm glad. I'm the final point I want to make here. I'm really glad that people haven't remained silent and people have been very vocal about their discipline.

[08:13] And I think that's about their disappointment in certain aspects of new pinball machines when they come out and they're not living up to your expectations. You know, there's certain people that think we should just cheerlead every single pinball machine that any pinball is good pinball and we should applaud it.

[08:29] But that's like saying I'm going to give I'm going to be excited that any movie comes out because I like movies. I like pinball should I be excited because every pinball machine is about to come out.

[08:40] And I don't think so. I think you're allowed to have an opinion like movies like music. And we talk about this when I interview Scott pinball is 100% subjective 100% subjective.

[08:53] There is no formula or objective way to say I made a great pinball machine. Some people love the walking dead. Some people hated. Some people love tron. Some people hate it. Some people love Lord the ring. Some people hate it.

[09:06] And that's just pinball. And so you're going to get a lot of varying opinions about a game. But but value. I don't think value is subjective. See value is the one objective area of pinball.

[09:20] You know if you look at a machine and you look at the price of the machine and you look at an L.E. versus a premium and you can objectively say is there $1,500 more value in this game versus this game.

[09:37] And in terms of parts, right, if all of the value is just in different artwork and a couple hundred dollars worth of stuff and rarity, then I think I think I think you're in trouble. And I've been saying it limited edition from here on out.

[09:53] I think limited edition games. Ellie is starting to stand for the loser edition. Yes, you are starting to showcase that you are loser. If you are buying an L.E. and there's no real value, I'll tell you why because you're losing items from the machine.

[10:12] You are losing a shaker. You're losing a backlash. You're losing features. You're losing the things that made an L.E. And I hope this is just a blip in the radar. I really do. I think what's happened here is I think they spent a ton of money on the Star Wars license and they yanked everything out.

[10:30] I think we're going to get a return to what a real L.E. is. And remember, a real L.E. should have stuff that make it undeniably the edition you should get.

[10:44] Look at Batman, for example. The L.E. owners got the top. The top was everything in that game. It's so awesome. And you know what? If you didn't get an L.E. or if you didn't get a super L.E. you couldn't get the top.

[11:00] That's how it needs to be. There needs to be some exclusive item, exclusive feature that warrants paying more. They can't just be 800 of art. That's not really that special.

[11:15] Okay, we've belaborated. I know. Let me read another email I got from a listener to the show. I want to give a shout out to David.

[11:25] David F. Thank you for listening to Kinne's Pinball Podcast. David told me the story of how he found my show. He came to Pinside after I was banned.

[11:36] He had uploaded a comment about how he didn't like. I believe it was dialed in. He said a remark. Someone said this guy sounds a lot like Kaneda.

[11:48] Can we get a poll to find out how many people think he sounds like him? Because he was called that. He went and found out who Kaneda was.

[11:57] He realized that he found the smartest man on the planet next to him. That was me. Him and I. Between the two of us, we know everything there is to know.

[12:07] If I don't know it, David knows it. David, thank you for listening to the show. He was having some next surgery and he was recovering.

[12:16] He said that my episodes helped him in his recovery. It's true. My voice has a numbing effect on the human body. You hear it? And it'll put you out. You'll be out of your pain pretty quickly.

[12:30] David, thanks for listening to the show. He wrote something. He said, I think you nailed it when you said that Stern makes great $6,000 machines. I have the four original unlicensed data e-titles in my collection.

[12:42] I love them. It is hilarious that people that snub their noses at the data e-s games and pay double for Bally Williams games are standing in line to buy these cheap machines from Stern.

[12:55] Stern knows a license will move units. And he has a big facility with a lot of people. He has to sell and deliver X amount of pins and he has to make X amount per pin. That is how they start their design process and it shows.

[13:09] I think you're right that Stern needs to stay in business. Now I was reading on Pinside and this is crazy when you think about it. Scott Dinesi would be happy if they sell 50 total nuclear annihilations when the order banks open.

[13:26] Stern makes 50 pinball games a day. A day people. That just shows the difference. It shows the difference between Stern and everybody else. 50 a day. They will make it one day. What spooky might sell making total nuclear annihilations for months.

[13:45] That is just the reality of who Stern is. Stern is mass market. Now my issue has always been don't pay a premium for the mass market product. If Stern wants to make something special call it limited call it super then it should be limited.

[14:04] I think they are going to get back to it. Home pin is getting thunderbirds ready. I have been holding back because I want to get Mike on the show. I have been hearing from a lot of you that you don't really like the artwork.

[14:23] I am not going to name names because someone just said I can't believe this shit. He sent me a picture of the thunderbirds back glass. I can't believe people aren't just roasting this.

[14:40] I think that's the case. I think it's going to come out at a time when there are so many things people love.

[14:55] I think thunderbirds has an uphill battle to climb. If the game doesn't speak to people I think it's going to have a hard time selling it over here. I can't speak for people over in Australia who love this theme thunderbirds. I don't know what's wrong with those Aussies.

[15:15] Why do they love thunderbirds? The show is so old and so weird and so quirky. It is the last theme I would ever pick to launch my pinball company.

[15:26] Last point real quick. I want to say a big congratulations to Mr. Zack Sharp for being named the marketing manager over at Stern.

[15:37] I think it's great that Stern is sort of shuffling the cards a little bit, shaking stuff up over there at Stern. They are marketing. You know me. I work in marketing. They are marketing today. It hasn't been the best.

[15:54] They have some figures within their marketing department that have some anger management issues at times. You don't curse out your customers on Twitch streams. You don't do that. You don't ban people on social media.

[16:08] They have a problem with their game. The whole point of social media is that when people buy your product and they have an issue they want to be able to go on to social media and explain their issue and get customer service. They don't want to be banned and blacklisted. That's not the way the modern world works.

[16:26] So, Zack, I am happy that there is a new error within Stern marketing. I think Zack and Jared are going to do amazing things together. I really do. I think both these guys have the right mentality, have the right passion for pinball and the right mindset.

[16:43] I told Jared, you are coming back on the show and this time we are going to freaking err the interview. We are not going to do an hour and a half or two talk and then I have to shelve it because it didn't get final approval from someone up top. Come on, we are just talking pinball.

[16:59] I think the main reason I got canned is I asked him what he thought of Steve Richie calling pinside a cancer. Maybe I shouldn't have asked that question. Sometimes I try to get the dirt, a little bit of the drama and sometimes it comes back to bite me and they didn't approve it.

[17:15] Next time I won't ask such a loaded question. I probably will anyway. Come on, Jared, come on the show. I will promote what is it? Where is he working these days? Hooters? I have always seen him post about bacon wrap buffalo wings all day long and it makes me hungry.

[17:33] Anyway, I am going to give you Scott and E.C. I want to say congratulations to Scott. This game will be coming out by the end of the year. It is going to be interesting. I would have hoped them to get it out a little sooner because I think by December, there is going to be a lot of competition.

[17:49] The interesting part about this game is the non-refundable deposit. You will only go in on one if you want one. This is a game for pinball fans. These guys are having fun making the machine. They have worked hard to get the machine to $6,000.

[18:05] My hats off to them. I think Scott and Spooky are doing something that is good for the pinball community. Even if I don't love everything about the game, I love the fact that the game is coming out because it is a different type of game.

[18:23] There is anything I am tired of. It is these glorified old designers who keep recycling their ideas and charging me more money for games they made 10-20 years ago without anything original or new.

[18:37] Scott, congrats for making a game that will stick out in a good way in someone's collection. Without further ado, Mr. Scott and E.C. Oh, and I will say this. The quality is not the best because my call recorder software was added date.

[18:52] I had to use a different program and also, Bubba was not a heat. Bubba was a hump in me all day yesterday. It is solely because he saw that Magic Girl is working again. My Magic Girl is back 100%.

[19:04] You will hear him huffing and puffing at certain points. If you hear a lot of heavy breathing, that is not Brenda being really excited because she is dating me. It is Bubba.

[19:15] You got to love Bubba. He supports Pimbal too. Give him a belly rub if you see him. Here is Scott and E.C.

[19:22] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canada's Pimbal podcast, a very special guest on a very special day for this man.

[19:31] Scott and E.C. creator of Total Nuclear Nilation on the day the order banks opened up. I have to say Scott, collectively. I don't think this could happen to a nicer guy.

[19:44] I think the community universally is super proud and excited that your game is coming to market. Welcome back to the show.

[19:50] Thank you very much. What was it like waking up today? You are like, shit, orders are coming in today. Were you nervous?

[20:00] Absolutely. I mean, anyone would be nervous. I am not really nervous. I think we are going to sell 50. I think that was someone posted that in the thread.

[20:15] I think there was a 50 sold. I don't really know right now what the numbers are. The feeling of just being nervous, I guess, for the fact that I am the guy that did everything or most of everything on this machine, software wise and physical design and all that other crap.

[20:37] I don't know, it's just kind of like a nervous thing. I mean, this thing needs to go out now into people's homes. That's kind of scary.

[20:45] Nobody can blame Disney when they look at Total Nuclear Nilation. This is all you. Which is also rewarding.

[20:54] I wish I had a scapegoat of some sort.

[20:58] Walk us through because the last time we talked on this show, it was a while ago. It was when TNA was total annihilation and was making the circuit.

[21:09] You hadn't yet announced that Spooky was going to build it. You probably mentioned this on Charlie's podcast.

[21:17] Tell us how it went from being your game to a spooky game.

[21:22] I mentioned this a few times. Hopefully people aren't bored with my story yet.

[21:30] I've known Charlie for a long time beforehand. He was watching what I was doing really with it.

[21:37] He started talking after Expo 2016. It was really kind of coming together.

[21:47] We kept figuring out if it was feasible to make the game. We did.

[21:53] It just kind of worked out. We worked very hard, not just myself, not just Charlie, but everybody involved in this project worked very hard to get that price down.

[22:04] It was just the overall complexity of that game.

[22:09] Let's talk about that. When you guys started to look at the bomb, which is the build of materials, I always get this wrong.

[22:17] It's a build of materials. When you put it together, it must have been a very expensive to put everything in that game when you're just building a one-off prototype.

[22:30] I stopped keeping track of it. I was going to be really good about it and see how much I spent on it.

[22:37] I stopped keeping track of it because there were things I was doing. I was bartering for certain things as well.

[22:41] I don't really have a good number about it. I'll tell you it was very expensive to put that together.

[22:47] When you connected with Charlie, what was that going through the game and actually pricing out what it would cost to source the parts to make the game as close as they possibly could to your initial vision?

[23:02] You probably don't want any element of the game to suffer because of material costs.

[23:07] It's not just that Chris. I didn't want...

[23:12] If you take out elements from that game, it really would lose a lot of people wanting to get it because they played a game with full RGB, full GIRGB.

[23:26] If we pulled that out, let's just pretend that we turned the GI to non-RGB or something. People would be really disappointed by it. It would lose some of that magical factor.

[23:37] We left every single thing in the game. We were able to do that and how we were able to do that was we went through each part and we just tried to efficiently get the parts from different sources or wherever.

[23:53] The thing even has a beacon on top of it for production, which I was thinking for sure they were going to make me take that out, but we did not.

[24:02] When you guys started this, did you have a final price point in mind that we got to get this thing around this price?

[24:10] What we did first was we put the bill in materials together and we said, here is how much it costs to build this thing.

[24:18] Then we said, now can we smash that down a little bit by getting different parts or whatever.

[24:26] People taking pay cuts or whatever we had to do to get that down below a certain number.

[24:34] We were like, hey, I bet we could get this below 6.

[24:38] We had 5 bucks below 6. That is where we ended up and we landed. It was very hard. Sure, could Spooky make more money selling this game?

[24:49] They probably could, but we did not think it was really fair to mark up a game unnecessarily. We slammed it down and went the opposite direction with it.

[25:00] That is why I think people love Spooky and love what you guys are doing because the complete opposite is going on in other areas of the hobby.

[25:10] Even when we were looking at the communication today of communicating the game itself, it is not by coincidence that it says no Ellie's exclamation points.

[25:24] I got the email from Pimbal Star selling me on the game and we are seeing the complete opposite in other parts of the hobby where people are taking stuff out of the game, charging more money, so it all adds profit.

[25:37] But the collector and the Pimbal hobbyist has really started to become wiser and wants to see value.

[25:44] Scott, what is the final price point on TNA right now?

[25:48] What is it cost right now to buy it?

[25:50] How much if I want to buy it tomorrow?

[25:53] It is $59.95.

[25:55] Is there street prices or that is the price?

[26:01] We always hear MSRP and that is the street price.

[26:04] No, that is just the price. You are pretty much buying it directly from Spooky. There are some distributors that have them, but I do not believe they will be marking those down at all.

[26:13] I do not think there is no room. There is no possible way that could get any cheaper.

[26:19] This game is so much stuff in it that it is like I am surprised we were even able to work hard enough to get that down.

[26:26] I do not know if you can tell me this, but when you first priced it, what was it coming in at?

[26:33] I do not really remember. We did not have everything done. We just started moving stuff around to try and get under 6.

[26:39] The way Charlie is building the game is you are taking orders of 50.

[26:45] After that you will take more orders and you will build the games in units of 50.

[26:52] That is correct.

[26:54] Yes, that is how it works.

[26:58] Charlie is taking orders now.

[27:00] He is taking orders now. Whether it is above 50 or even if it goes above 50 he is still going to take those.

[27:07] But it will be built in batches of 50.

[27:11] I do not know the specifics. Let us just pretend it sells like 60 units or something.

[27:17] I do not know the specifics and what happens with those 10 people.

[27:21] I am not sure.

[27:23] What is the timing?

[27:26] I want to get all the basic questions out of the way Scott and I want to talk more about some of the emotional stuff that is going on in your head.

[27:32] The timing, if I order this game, what is the time frame people can expect it?

[27:38] Basically, I do not have tons of visibility into this so I apologize.

[27:45] He is going to start shipping those two customers before the end of the year.

[27:52] It is like December.

[27:56] I would safely say December.

[27:59] Is it going to go on the line simultaneously with Alice Cooper?

[28:06] We should be seeing that game two over the next few months.

[28:10] If all goes according to plan.

[28:13] It will be first before Alice Cooper will hit the production line first anyway.

[28:18] But then Alice Cooper will be on the other line next to it.

[28:23] The way people place orders to we were talking about this right before we hit record.

[28:31] It is a thousand dollar deposit.

[28:34] That is non-refundable.

[28:37] I believe Charlie decided to do that this time because there were a lot of people who were dropping out last minute on things with the Rob Zombie.

[28:47] The way spooky makes these games is basically you pay a little bit up front.

[28:52] They build your game completely and when it is in the box ready to go, you pay the rest of it.

[28:58] What was happening was they were building these games and then they were saying,

[29:02] they give me the rest of your money and they are like, no, I want my deposit back.

[29:06] Now spooky has got to take this game and do a whole bunch of stuff and get it to somebody else.

[29:13] It is not like a major manufacturer.

[29:16] They are just building them to spec.

[29:20] Taking it a non-refundable deposit.

[29:23] It helps to eliminate a lot of speculators, flippers, the guys that aren't really...

[29:29] You can't tell if they really want the machine but if it is non-refundable, you really have to want the machine to order one.

[29:37] That is good.

[29:38] That is how it should be.

[29:40] You should be excited and want to play the Pimble machine.

[29:43] It weeds out idiots like me who are flipping batmans and ghost busters for a profit before even getting it.

[29:50] I think Charlie made a wise move there and I think it is going to be good because

[29:55] another thing that we hear distributors and manufacturers doing are all these $250 refundable deposits.

[30:03] I saw who Dini is doing that and I think when you do that as a manufacturer, you have no idea knowing what your actual orders are going to be.

[30:12] People can just bail the second you announce the price and then you have ordered parts for maybe hundreds of machines and then overnight,

[30:20] you order the list might dry up.

[30:22] It is a small company that can really hurt.

[30:28] Right.

[30:29] Right.

[30:30] So today was day one.

[30:32] I know that because I got emails from different distributors.

[30:36] I was reading Kinsa.

[30:37] Do you guys know yet how you got some early sort of tally on how many orders came in on day one?

[30:44] I don't know.

[30:46] Someone told me that there were 50 but I don't know anymore over that.

[30:51] I don't really honestly, I don't really want to know.

[30:53] I'll wait.

[30:54] It's like election night, right?

[30:56] Yeah, I know.

[30:57] You don't want to watch but then you kind of do and then you're like, yeah, I don't know.

[31:01] Right.

[31:02] Well, the good thing is, I mean, not every single order is going to come in on day one too.

[31:06] It wasn't like, it wasn't one of these, uh, Jersey Jack, you know, everyone who orders by midnight in 2016 gets a dialed in,

[31:15] collectors edition and then, you know, there wasn't like this race to order today.

[31:20] But it's not really, you know, that's not fair.

[31:23] Yeah.

[31:24] This isn't much better way of doing it in my opinion.

[31:26] But again, that's just my opinion.

[31:28] Yeah.

[31:29] No, I mean, it's, look, I think every step of the web, this game has been communicated properly.

[31:35] Charlie's always sort of been a straight shooter with all his games.

[31:39] And, you know, what's exciting is that this game is different.

[31:42] And I think as we look at the pinball hobby and we look at what other manufacturers are providing, there's a lot of options and there's a lot of great games.

[31:51] And, uh, Scott, talk to me about, and I know you read the feedback and when people, your game really does bring in the question, what is a modern pinball machine?

[32:01] Right. Talk to me about when you hear people saying, because it doesn't have a ramp, it's not really a modern pinball game.

[32:07] Like, what are your thoughts when you hear stuff like that?

[32:10] Well, I mean, it's the first of all, the game's not for everybody.

[32:14] Okay. I mean, not everyone is going to like it.

[32:16] I really, um, I really prepared myself for people not to like it.

[32:22] Um, just because it is really different.

[32:24] It's got everything kind of stacked against it, you know, it's got, um, you know, no ramps, right?

[32:31] It's got, uh, you know, the numeric displays on it, which are, I don't know, I guess it's not really a negative thing.

[32:37] That's a really, that's a really cool thing.

[32:39] Um, but like, it's an unlicensed theme, right?

[32:42] It's got really loud artwork on it.

[32:44] Um, you know, it's just, there's a lot of things about it.

[32:47] Like, it plays like a modern game except it's like not at the same time.

[32:54] But anyway, like, it's just, I really prepared myself for people not to like it.

[32:58] But I understand not everyone will totally fine, you know, um,

[33:05] but the people that do like it really understand what I was going for, right?

[33:09] I wanted to make something that was the ultimate goal is to make a fun pinball machine that you play with your friends, you know?

[33:16] Isn't that a novel idea in 2027D?

[33:20] That actually made the game fun.

[33:22] Well, it must have been exciting when we interviewed George Gomez and he said that out of all the games he played at different shows.

[33:27] Your game was the one he loved to own.

[33:29] Um, and I think feedback has been really positive.

[33:33] And I think the reason why is when you start with an original theme, uh, it's your vision, right?

[33:40] You're not disappointing people's expectations of a movie they've loved and seen a thousand times.

[33:47] Yeah, that scares me.

[33:49] Yeah, well, you're, you know, this is a world you created.

[33:52] This is a pinball game that has an amazing light show that sounds incredible, that is, is a different gameplay from everything else that people have been experiencing recently.

[34:02] And I think that's why people saw it as a refreshing break from the normal programming that we've been getting in pinball.

[34:11] Now, this has gone pretty quickly, right?

[34:14] I mean, you, how many years have you been working on this game?

[34:18] Um, it's, I started it in November of 2015.

[34:23] So, yeah, about two years of it.

[34:25] Wow, okay. So, and it was just you, right?

[34:29] You did the programming, you did the design, you did, you built this thing basically.

[34:34] Did you have any help when you were making a prototype?

[34:37] Um, not really. I mean, I had, well, so the things that I did do were, I designed it myself completely.

[34:46] Um, I did the, um, basic programming for it.

[34:51] I did have some help on the programming just from the open source p-rock community, um, with, you know, with a different framework and that I'm using every next skeleton game.

[35:01] So, there's a bunch of us using that.

[35:04] Um, I did all of the audio.

[35:07] I did all of the, you know, light shows and stuff like that.

[35:12] Um, at first I did the animations on the screen there and those were just like some basic placeholder things.

[35:20] Um, but those have now been completely redone by the spooky animator who is like ridiculously talented.

[35:26] Um, and no one seen that yet, right?

[35:29] No one seen it yet, but we're going to be doing a stream really soon.

[35:32] Uh, and it'll have the new animations, it'll have the actual machine with artwork on it.

[35:38] You can see the, the new GI that I engineered that's like, it's like three times brighter than the one that was in the whitewood version.

[35:45] Wow.

[35:47] Let's talk a little bit about, well, and before we, I want to talk a little bit about the artwork, but you were a DJ, right?

[35:54] At one point, or still are, you never lose the skill.

[35:57] Yeah, I don't really do much anymore, but I've been, uh, I've been doing like music writing stuff and tinkering with that since the late 90s.

[36:04] Right.

[36:05] What, so, Kid Ball Sound is something that I believe, you know, when you, when you play your game and, and the way it sounds so awesome and it really like just hits you on an audio level.

[36:17] Unlike most games, do you, when you, did, did you feel like the audio and pinball had been lacking in terms of like just kind of giving you that punch of music that gets your adrenaline going?

[36:30] Absolutely. Actually, I've been feeling that a lot longer than I've had an idea to build a machine. I mean, I've always, like when I first got into pinball, then I realized, like, I came from the arcade scene.

[36:41] So, like, arcade machines, there were so many arcade machines, like different arcade machines, like titles, right?

[36:48] Like, just, to me, it felt unlimited, you know?

[36:51] And then I got into this pinball world and it was, there was a lot less titles of pinball machines than there were arcade machines and I was like, oh man, I got to find one.

[37:01] Like, I shouldn't have any problem. I want to find one with like some drum and bass music in it, right?

[37:05] Like, there's got to be one somewhere, right?

[37:07] And I looked around, I couldn't find anything. Like, the music and pinball machines was just not great to me.

[37:14] You know, none of it was like the, because I was really into like hard techno and drum and bass and stuff like that. And I thought it was really like pinball machine just supposed to amp you up and music is a really good way to do that.

[37:26] So, when I did Earth Shaker after shock, I put a whole bunch of like drum and bass music in there. There's some like, you know, early dubstep in there and stuff.

[37:36] There's stuff that just kind of like gets you excited. And I think that's, you know, and I really, when I started writing music for this game, I really focused on keeping it, you know, in this whole genre of exciting music, but not not too far out that it's, you know, going to offend people.

[37:54] Like, you know, that dubstep stuff with the screeching noises and stuff like that. Just like people don't, like people who don't listen to electric music listen to that and go, what the hell is that? Like, that's awful.

[38:05] Right. So, you know, so I stay with, but like, you know, I stayed in this exciting genre of electronic music that I really like and it just, you know, it works out real well.

[38:17] Now, I mean, the game sounds incredible. Now, in terms of the speakers in the game, because even not just the music, but your machine was just kicking at a T.P.F. when I saw it.

[38:28] So, I have the speakers like what kind of speakers will be in the final production version of the game, right? Is it going to sound as good as it is the shows?

[38:37] I'll tell you what, let me tell you first, I'll start with what's in the whitewood version, and then we'll talk about the production one cool.

[38:43] Yeah.

[38:44] All right. So, the whitewood version has two five inch speakers on the top. Those are controlled by one of those cheap, like $20 leppy amps off Amazon. Right. No big deal. Really standard, you know, home brew guys use that amp all the time. It's fine.

[39:01] But there's this band pass box that I built in the bottom of the cabinet, which has a 300 watt subwoofer in it kicker subwoofer. It's only an eight inch subwoofer.

[39:15] And I've got a 300 watt matched kicker amplifier for it. This is all like car equipment.

[39:23] So, I'm running that like pretty damn loud. That took all the base out of the top. Now the top speakers and then put all the, you know, took all the treble out of the bottom obviously.

[39:36] And it made a really nice cohesive sound, right? So, that is extremely loud the way it is. The production version though is actually a little louder than the whitewood version.

[39:51] We use different components. What we did was we got a completely different amplifier. We're not using any cheap like leppy amps off Amazon or anything completely different amplifier.

[40:03] It has two five inch speakers up above just like the whitewood version. But it's got instead of an eight inch sub down in the base. It's actually got a 10 inch sub, which is power mesh to the amplifier.

[40:17] And that is also encased in the production version. It's encased in a speaker box so that all the sound is going to be forced out of the pinball machine and not into it rattling the glass and the mechanics and stuff.

[40:30] So, we were able to keep that sub chamber thing that I built.

[40:34] Which is awesome because I think I saw a lot of people asking that, you know, when they saw the price, people just assumed it was going to lose some of that, right? And it's really no point in tenant music to people's ears that this game is going to sound just as good as it did at the shows.

[40:51] I mean, it sounds incredible. I agree with you. I think that sound is one of the missing elements in so many machines. And, you know, we have like the machines that are based on rock bands and that's sort of cheating because we're playing music that has already stirred people's souls for decades.

[41:09] But for the most part, pinball machines should have like an incredible soundtrack. So, let's talk about art. Scott, because I know the artist on this machine is an artist that the world has come to know in pinball, Matt Andrews, who worked on some of the John Papa do games.

[41:27] How did you get connected to Matt? Was it through spooky? Was it through Ben? Like, what's the story of how you sort of found him as your artist?

[41:35] Yeah, that's actually interesting. Yeah, so Charlie and Ben were, you know, new of him. And, you know, when I actually heard Matt Andrews on your podcast, and then I was, it was one of the people that I was thinking of reaching out to.

[41:53] And when I heard about your podcast, I was listening to him and I'm like, you know, it's, you know, it's pretty, you know, he seems like a pretty cool guy. So, you know, I just shot him an email. And from there, we just kind of connected. But Ben and Charlie had, you know, had recommended him as well.

[42:11] So, it's, it was coming from multiple directions here. So, I'm like, all right, well, I guess that's meant to be.

[42:17] And how was that working with Matt? So, talk to me about, was that nerve wrecking? You've got like a whitewood, right? It's just a, it's a blank game. And it's, is it difficult to just figure out like how am I going to cover this with art?

[42:33] Yeah, it's, it's very difficult. This, the play field itself, one of my buddies, Jeremy Wilson actually mocked up some ideas with me when we first, when I first started, like, looking at getting some art on the play field here, because I, I just can't do artwork.

[42:50] Like, I'm also not a good art director, like by any mean. But, but Jeremy helped me like get some ideas down on the play field. And then from there, like, we, he, we, he, vectored a bunch of stuff.

[43:02] But from there, it allowed me to see a little bit about what I wanted on the play field. And then I was able to, when we, when I switched over to have Matt do the art, like completely drawn, you know, like, illustrated.

[43:17] It, it, it really helped a lot to get that going. And in this project, too, like working with Matt has been just outstanding. I mean, he's a great communicator. You know, he's really, really talented. He doesn't need too much direction.

[43:33] And he kind of figured out, you know, he figured out what I was trying to get across, even though I'm, you know, a bumbling fool, you know, when it comes to that stuff sometimes.

[43:41] Right, right.

[43:43] So I gave him tons of freedom. So he, he was able to do a lot of things. And I was able to say, hey, I don't like this or I like this. Or how about like something else, you know.

[43:51] Right.

[43:52] Let's talk about the back glass. Cause who is that? Is that woman someone you know? I know people are speculating.

[43:59] Yeah. Well, there's no speculation actually that girl. Yeah. A lot of people know this already. But that girl was based off of my wife actually.

[44:09] So it's not my wife, but it is a drawing that slightly resembles her. She, it sounds super corny, but she's like the reason I'm able to spend so much time on this project is she's like been really pulling a bunch of weight around here and letting me get away with things I shouldn't.

[44:29] Right.

[44:30] So are there any Easter eggs or things in the back glass that are cool to point out? I'm just looking at it now. It's got it's got a lot going on here.

[44:38] There's tons of stuff in there. I don't know if you want me to just like call them out because it's not fun.

[44:42] Give me one give us one to start.

[44:45] Well, there's a who's the guy above the door?

[44:49] The guy above the door is that is not even that's not even an Easter egg. That's just the security guy.

[44:58] The there is a lion man movie poster in there with two of my best friends names on it.

[45:06] Okay, so we we've been somewhat critical of the artwork on this show. You know me. I'm an art fan.

[45:14] I love detail. I love like dab. You know, I'm blinded by magic girl. Even though the game doesn't work. I'm just such a detail horror.

[45:25] There was a lot of feedback back and forth and when you show a game early, right, Scott? I mean, there's always that pin side sort of response to everything, which is like, I love it.

[45:36] Then the next day they're like, I hate it. Then the next day they're like, we love it again.

[45:40] What was it like reading people's feedback when you showed what the game looked like?

[45:47] You know, it's actually okay. I honestly, I mean, I know I had already accepted people weren't going to like it.

[45:54] It's different. It's very different.

[45:58] The play field itself, it looks from a distance. It looks like it doesn't have a lot of detail.

[46:07] And it doesn't have as much detail as something like, you know, dirty Donnie would do or Jeremy Packer would want a play field.

[46:13] You know, it's like, it's a lot more simple and it's very different from what's out there already.

[46:19] I mean, there's tons of detail play fields already. You know, look at like Houdini and look at Aerosmith. You know, look at Metallica.

[46:25] Even like it's, they're so detailed, you know, but I wanted to make something slightly less detailed with, you know, but have more, you know,

[46:36] but there's more going on like in the game with the lights and everything. You know what I mean?

[46:41] It doesn't eat all this super depth.

[46:44] But don't go. I mean, there are, there are tons of stuff in that play field.

[46:49] And no one's seen it lit up yet, right? With the art.

[46:54] Have you bring it to, like, it has some pictures. Oh, no, I haven't seen it in real life. No.

[46:59] Unless you stop by spooky pinball and played it. But I have not yet.

[47:04] Yeah, the prototype is sitting over there. It's spooky pinball.

[47:09] That one, there was just pictures of it lit up, which is they don't really do it justice.

[47:14] But yeah, we're going to be showing the game at the pinball life open house for expo.

[47:25] Okay. The games will not be at expo.

[47:29] Game will not be at expo, but pinball life will be at the bottom of the open house.

[47:33] Okay. So pinball life is doing the party again. Yeah. I don't have any details on it yet.

[47:38] But well, it'll be soon. I think last year, right? They didn't have their party that Stern's big epic.

[47:45] No, it was there. Was it there? I thought.

[47:48] Okay. Maybe I'm sad this year. Listeners of the show. I just realized that I'm going to be in Greece during pinball expo.

[47:55] Because it is it is the what the weekend of like the 15th 16th and 17th or something like that.

[48:02] Yeah, I'd have to look at it. It breaks my heart, but I'll be at the acropolis and the Greek Isle.

[48:08] So I'm devastated on a small level.

[48:13] Okay. So Scott, this is like, this is like, so what's what's next?

[48:18] Is it just getting production ramped up? Like what's what's between now and games going out?

[48:23] Like what are you doing on a day to day basis?

[48:26] I need to bulletproof the software. So my number one priority right now.

[48:31] Because production, I don't have to deal with production, right? Like spooky pinball deals with production.

[48:37] But I have to make sure that when this game goes out, that software is a very stable.

[48:44] B works for all the operators and C has all the features and everything in it that, you know,

[48:52] because I want to release it. It's pretty much done. It has everything in it.

[48:57] I'm not ruling out the fact that I might add stuff later for fun.

[49:01] Or, you know, because someone gave me a great suggestion or something.

[49:05] And I'm like, oh, that might be really cool. I might add that later on or something.

[49:08] Right.

[49:09] I might do that because people kind of like getting new software and exploring the new software, you know,

[49:14] it kind of makes the game fresh again.

[49:16] Even for your game, you know, changing the musical tracks everyone throughout

[49:20] to be fun as well, you know, because there's stuff you can do.

[49:23] You can play around more than just the pinball objectives.

[49:26] You can change audio even and have a new sort of experience.

[49:29] I can do whatever whatever I think is fun, I guess.

[49:33] I, you know, I don't know yet what I would change.

[49:35] But as it sits right now, all the features and functionality are in it.

[49:39] I just need to make sure that it's just rock solid and there's no weird behavior or anything in it that's, you know,

[49:47] that would make it look bad, you know.

[49:49] So something that Jersey Jack did successfully with dialed in is he put it on location for a while

[49:56] to get feedback from people and see how the game held up to being out and about.

[50:02] Right. Because the games get really used and abused out on location.

[50:06] Is that something that spooky might do to see how this game is holding up?

[50:10] And if there's any areas of wear on the play field or any issues with any of the mechanics of the game.

[50:16] Well, first of all, adjust the play field issue.

[50:19] Right now we have a production play field in a test rig and it is.

[50:25] It has been on like firing balls up in the air and dropping them on inserts like thousands and thousands of times.

[50:33] And it's just running right now.

[50:34] It's testing. It's firing things into the eject scoops.

[50:37] The eject scoops are firing things in with like, we were just like, you know, bent some ball guides and just screwed them right to the play field and like making the ball.

[50:45] Flying to the pop bumper, you know, thousands of times.

[50:48] But there's an actual test rig set up right now to make sure that that play field is going to hold up and not going to ghost and not going to do anything weird, you know.

[50:56] But you know, so that's that's that part of it.

[51:00] We are going to be putting a few of these on location.

[51:04] The first few off the line are going to go on location just so we can test the software.

[51:09] Make sure it's really, you know, there really is nothing wrong.

[51:15] The software is pretty cool.

[51:17] The fact that like when you if you have to do an update, it's super easy to do like it's you just take a file.

[51:24] You take one file and you put it on a USB stick and that USB stick you just pop it in the computer and it completely just does everything for you and then you're done.

[51:33] And it tells you to take the stick out.

[51:35] It doesn't even like yeah, you don't have to go in any service menu or anything like that.

[51:40] Okay, that's unsupersymple.

[51:42] Yeah.

[51:43] Okay, so the game so we're polishing it and it's I think it's also you know, people are so used to waiting so long for code.

[51:49] This game's going to come out.

[51:50] It's going to be done.

[51:52] Talk about, again, I've been reading some of the feedback.

[51:55] Some of the people who are saying the game is very repetitive and you're doing the same objective over and over again.

[52:01] What do you what do your thoughts when you hear people say that about like the gameplay itself?

[52:06] No, I agree. I completely agree.

[52:08] The little the rule sets very linear, right?

[52:11] You start a reactor one, you try and work your way to reactor nine, but I'll tell you what, if someone wants to come over here, throw some dollars on the glass of my white wood that I have sitting right next to me and try to beat you know, I would love that.

[52:26] So crazy levy, do you hear that?

[52:29] And then I want them to after they're done trying to beat me, which they may or may not, then I want them to tell me if they like the software enough.

[52:38] Right.

[52:39] Because it's a different beast, man, and this is not a game that allows you to play in control.

[52:47] Right. It's challenging and I think what people like about it as well.

[52:52] We saw this on the streams and people have been bringing us up.

[52:55] It's a really fun pinball game to play with four players because you're not going to sit there and watch someone play for a half hour.

[53:03] Nope. And what's really interesting too that I've noticed and I've noticed myself doing this.

[53:07] I've noticed other people when I just watch people play is you know, two people, this is pretend two people are playing a two player game, right?

[53:15] And they're playing for dollars. They're they're going to lose their dollar if they don't win.

[53:19] But I see the other person rooting for the other guy when it's their turn.

[53:24] Right.

[53:25] Like, oh my god, you're one shot away from destroying like the third reactor.

[53:28] They're like, there's an extra ball after that. You got to hit it. You got to do it. And then like they choke and everyone's like, no.

[53:33] Right.

[53:34] Well, it's what's fun about and you're into video games and arcade games. It's fun about just breaking up the traditional pinball approach, which is.

[53:44] These billion point scores and it's all about the scores and the objectives of the game don't really matter.

[53:51] It's all about like sort of manipulating the scoring and the multipliers and the stacking of modes.

[53:57] What I like about the way your game is is it is a little linear and that's fine because it's you're trying to get to the end and you're trying to get through the game versus just trying to beat the person with a score.

[54:11] Because the satisfaction is in getting through the reactors versus just scoring.

[54:17] So I think that that's important in pinball because I think so much is like only focus on tournament players and how they manipulate the scoring and games.

[54:27] Yeah, absolutely.

[54:28] And you know, there are random factors thrown into this too. I mean, let's just I'll just throw you a situation.

[54:35] I'll walk you through like the first reactor, right? So you have to solve a grid kind of like pinball in the middle of the play field, right?

[54:42] To unlock the reactor, right? You're trying to find you're basically trying to like hack in and get the code right, right?

[54:48] Then you shoot the scoop that's to the left of there and that actually starts the reactor.

[54:55] Then once that reactor is running, you fire the ball, you got to get to one of the orbits, right, to get up top because there's control gates up top.

[55:04] If you hit one, a hidden orbit that's not lit, it's just going to fly all the way around. You're not going to get into the core, right?

[55:09] You're trying to get into that reactor core and heat it up.

[55:11] So that changes when you hit the slingshot. So it's not easy.

[55:15] So you get to top, let's say you bring the reactor critical, so you got to get out of the reactor now.

[55:21] And there is now a random shot, one random shot lit on the bottom of the play field flashing super bright in your face, right?

[55:29] And that is the shot that you have to go for. It could be some it could be easy. It could be a hard shot.

[55:35] It could be a very risky shot. You never know. I mean, sometimes it's the pop bumper, you know?

[55:41] And this and this will be randomized. Scott, so if you play it multiple times, that won't always be the same shot.

[55:47] Correct. It is random based on the like it's some crazy random thing that I made based on milliseconds of when you actually started the game.

[55:57] See, I see I like that because I think what happens in a lot of these games is people just memorize the patterns of the modes.

[56:06] And that's what makes a game get old is you're always shooting the same couple shots in the same order to get through to achieve whether the mode complete the motor to get the points.

[56:19] So this is completely different. And it's it's so for people out there who think it's you're always doing the same thing.

[56:25] Yeah, every pinball machine, the shot like the physical shots don't change.

[56:30] That's why you rely on software to make the game come alive in different ways and random randomized stuff.

[56:37] So that that's actually it. You know, I think it will be really fun for people. And you know, look, I think that the game itself being difficult. I like that.

[56:49] I there's the reason why I dropped out of my pinball league. I just couldn't watch people play like spider man with like 20 minute balls. I just I couldn't because I think this randomness also evens out the play field a little bit between like great players and good players and decent players.

[57:06] So everyone's going to struggle a little bit to get reactor nine blown up. Is it how hard is it to get through all nine reactors?

[57:14] The best I've ever seen anyone get to was reactor five. Wow.

[57:19] Yeah, and that's that was a pretty damn good game.

[57:24] So when it's on location test, I have a bunch of I have a bunch of audits that collect and collect all this data.

[57:33] So I can see kind of where we're at. And I don't really want you know, I don't really want people to be able to get in a lot.

[57:42] You know, but it should be deaf. It should be achievable like once, you know.

[57:48] Yeah, I mean, you know, there are some people I've some friends out there Scott like when they beat a game they're kind of like I'm done with it.

[57:55] And then they're like, is there going to be a wizard mode and.

[57:58] But you know, most people never beat games right. Most people like no one ever like how many people get the valina or how many people sort of actually achieve that really difficult final goal.

[58:11] And for a lot of those guys like that's what keeps them owning the machine. So I think for people who get TNA, they're going to be blown up reactor nine like anytime soon. So that's that's good. It'll stay challenging.

[58:23] So, so, so, so.

[58:24] I mean, my first is like a good example of that is high speed, right? So high speed the game. I don't know if you're familiar with it at all. But like you basically collect all the traffic lights.

[58:35] Get the get the ramp to light red like a red light you run the red light you get you lock your balls do all sorts of stuff you get you get your jackpot, you know, whatever.

[58:45] But then the game restarts you start over again like that's the end of the game. I mean, so what you do with that sort of game is you don't set it easy. You set it hard. So it's very, very hard for you to get to the end of that game right.

[59:00] And that's like that's kind of what I've done here in them, you know, you know, and there be some settings and some people can do in the service mode if they really want or they can put rubber bands over the outlines or whatever.

[59:13] The valines are.

[59:15] Or they can do it. I just played with the glass off and then I'm a pinball champion every weekend. I'm like, oh, yeah.

[59:21] So Scott, like, talk me. Let's talk about the hobby a little bit because your games coming out and on this podcast, you know, we cover everything that's going on in the news of pinball and all these new machines.

[59:33] And I think on my a couple podcasts ago, I was counting the amount of new inbox machines that are going to be available just by the end of this year. We're talking about something like over 20 titles, which is incredible in 2017.

[59:46] There's that many games coming out new inbox that people can buy. What I believe that.

[59:52] Yeah, how do you how do you feel?

[59:55] Teenage going to do you do you get nervous that you're going up against these juggernaut themes or do you feel just like it's really happy it's coming out and it's it's a different kind of pinball for a different kind of player.

[01:00:07] Oh, it's I I'm not even concerned about it all.

[01:00:10] Like it's not so it's not meant to compete with Stern. It's not meant to compete with who do you need? You know these these games.

[01:00:19] I mean, it probably won't sell a ton of games. You know, I mean, I I think maybe maybe if I bluff, it'll sell like 200. That would be amazing.

[01:00:28] But like, you know, and but it's a completely different thing, man. I mean, it's not it's not a I don't even know how to word it properly. It's it's a it's a pinball.

[01:00:40] I've seen for a pretty niche market, I think, but I could be totally off base. I'm not exactly sure now.

[01:00:48] So so Charlie, I mean, there's there's not really a sales goal. I mean, it's sorry. You guys ordering like enough parts for 50 that way.

[01:00:58] You don't really have to like that that's each each finish on few guys is 50 games. Then that's where it makes sense to order parts for that many machines.

[01:01:07] So you're not stockpile and parts for like hundreds of games and you do 50 at a time. Right. So

[01:01:13] you can do that because they're small. They don't they don't have to have like 200 employees and a huge factory to make that viable.

[01:01:21] So

[01:01:23] in regardless of the success of TNA Scott, are you working on another game right now? Absolutely not.

[01:01:30] No way. This game has to be done. This this thing has to be rock solid. Like if I just if you just just imagine what would happen if I just started working on something else and like the software got out and there was like tons of

[01:01:42] bugs in it. It just wasn't good. It just looks like I you know half-assed everything. That's awful. Like no one's going to be like, oh, it's next game. Great.

[01:01:52] Great. So it's 100% focused on TNA making sure everything is great. No side projects, no distractions. Get the game to consumers in the best possible way. So that's that's good news too.

[01:02:06] I mean, we've we've seen so many people spread so thin. You know everything from you know the J-pop's working on four games at once of the world to you know people waiting for their batman code to be done after almost a year of the game being out.

[01:02:19] It's still not there. So I think the advantage you guys have is you know you're going to buy a game that's done for the most part right. And you're going to have a guy who built it who's going to focus on giving you support and listening to your feedback.

[01:02:34] And incorporating that because yeah, I mean, you know, I listen to as much feedback as I can. I mean, I do read that thread on the inside when I have time. I don't really respond in it because I just honestly I just don't have time to respond to everybody's questions.

[01:02:51] But I do read it, you know the feedback and you know people say say things about you know like the art like it should be this or that at this point in time like it's just too late to change the art. It is the way that I do want it.

[01:03:06] And I'm not saying some of the feedback that people are saying is good or bad. It's just you know it's just feedback. It's opinions.

[01:03:13] But I'm very happy with how yard is right now. Matt and I are both very happy with it.

[01:03:20] But you know we said this on. I mean I had to give or some shit on my pocket. I should know me. I mean because he was always the most critical of everyone else's art. And then he's on there being like everyone.

[01:03:31] He's just like but it's you know somewhere in the middle is is is is is where everyone should be which is okay to have an opinion at the end of the day.

[01:03:41] You know either buy a game or don't buy a game right. I mean this is just him ball where we're talking about a non essential item that is subjective.

[01:03:49] The whole entire machine is subjective. You can like the game play you can hit the game play. You can like the art you can hit the art you can like the music you can hit the music.

[01:03:57] Every element of a toy like this is subjective. Yeah I think I think my friends are also really like something that they'll hop in there sometimes and say stuff like that because they see how hard I'm actually working on this thing.

[01:04:08] It's just like it's it's brutal to hear like people just being mean for just the sake of being mean to someone who's working so hard to deliver something to the pinball community.

[01:04:19] It's for you know it's for people now you know.

[01:04:22] I mean it's easy for me to put a mic on and just the last like Star Wars pinball over and over again.

[01:04:31] It's a lot harder to be Steve Richie make Star Wars pinball and then have to hear.

[01:04:36] It's like me going off on it but I think Scott you know my big thing with the hobby recently is just all been about value that people are paying a lot for these and they they should get the value for what they pay for it and I think without a doubt nobody looks at TNA and says I just don't see the value there I think people expected it to come in higher I thought it was going to come in even higher a couple thousand more even.

[01:05:04] So I think at the price point I think it's a really attractive game to come out of this time you know games are getting really expensive and I also like that there's no LEDs that you're not making people feel like they're getting like a lesser version or putting stuff in that doesn't enhance the gameplay or the experience just to make money which is what we're seeing from other manufacturers.

[01:05:28] What are your thoughts on the hobby that just in general Scott what's going on right now are you you just sort of focus on your thing you don't want to say you know you don't really pay too close attention to the other stuff going on.

[01:05:40] I have been I mean I think I don't know why people are upset at like Star Wars for instance like I went from what I played on it I really liked it I don't I think what what Dwight did with the software with the like bonus multiplier thing and like I think what he did was pretty creative.

[01:05:57] Yeah you know is the game a little bit deep for my own liking maybe slightly but that's just my opinion I mean it doesn't really make the game a bad game you know I mean it doesn't at all actually.

[01:06:08] Yeah I mean my my gripe is always just been the amount of stuff in the Star Wars universe and again this is just like theme integration right and this subjective like you I just think you can put more in a Star Wars pinball machine than we're getting but it's also this is how Steve which he makes games so it's no surprise.

[01:06:26] That this is he's a he's a king of speed right and he wants you you don't get speed when you drop a lot of stuff on the plate.

[01:06:34] So and Star Wars is just a game where the expectations are super high as they should be it's Star Wars you know it's hard for pinball to to deliver on it on a theme where the expectations are through the roof.

[01:06:48] You can do it better with a video game you can do it better with virtual reality now it's just you want to immerse someone in the Star Wars world.

[01:06:56] It's it's difficult I mean I don't envy people trying to make these themes come to life on a pinball playfield.

[01:07:02] Yeah I mean you only get limited amount of space I mean there's not that much space inside a pinball machine you know it you can't just throw everything in there you'll you'll just clutter it up and it'll be just too much stuff in there.

[01:07:13] I mean I don't know I could be also biased too because like Steve Richie is one of my favorite pinball designers all the time like my first pinball machine ever owned was a high speed.

[01:07:25] It's you know it he just I don't know the way his layouts are pretty they're just great man he just like it's a job done you know it's fast.

[01:07:34] There's really you know it's the the the early Star Wars games are shipping this week so we'll get more reviews from people yeah but it's it's pinball right I mean people who buy the games that we say they're great people who are not even in on it say how much they hate it it's like that it's the way of the pinball form universe.

[01:07:53] I'm trying to step back even from being so hyper critical because I didn't the day I was like look it's we have a lot of options out there and buy what you love play it and buy it and I think that's that's a thing is what's coming to an end in this hobby is the buying the game before you play it buying it before you see it and then having to justify buying it without even playing it because it makes people very very defensive and I think that's the way it works.

[01:08:22] I think that's another thing with these Ellie models of selling games is a lot of people went in on Star Wars Ellie and wanted to like they were you know they were going to get something that other people didn't get because it was so in demand and I think now that the man the demand for that game is you can so go get an Ellie today in Star Wars not even sold out I think that's like people to be like oh see it's not that good it didn't sell out but that's not that that may not be the case it's just there's 800 of them and it's not grand.

[01:08:52] You know it's a lucky man. Yeah I mean I don't know what the future of the Ellie is actually going to be to tell you the truth I mean I never really was a fan of the Ellie's because it's like you know they're just it's a you know it's a machine that you know they put more stuff in obviously to make it more collectible but I don't know if you can force collectibility like this it's not really how it works right.

[01:09:16] Games that were collectible before this whole error they either didn't make many of them or there aren't many surviving editions that aren't good shape so games like monster bash and medieval madness and tells the Arabian Knights and Circus Voltaire like they do they those games were never built to be collected right most of them went on location and were beat up and to have a nice one.

[01:09:46] It was really hard to find but now it's like arbitrary collectibles where you set a number you try to create scarcity you try to put elements in that are seemingly more valuable but the problem is there's just too many games like I was saying right 22 games coming out most of them have like an Ellie version then nothing's really limited I mean it's like when Jack has like a thousand wizard of Oz is that are limited.

[01:10:16] And then makes another thousand limited in Ruby red edition it's just 2000 of them out there.

[01:10:22] I don't know though I mean at first I think it was I think it worked really well at first but I just don't know what the future holds for that we'll see I guess.

[01:10:31] Yeah what's good about your game is one edition everything's in it it'll be working on day one it'll be you know spooky will make the games that people put deposit on there's not going to be a game.

[01:10:45] There's not going to be any question marks about whether production will occur so we're thinking sometime in q4 2017 people so.

[01:10:53] Scott if someone wants to order total nuclear annihilation like what's the best method is it to find a distributor contact spooky is either one works.

[01:11:02] You can I think they're opening up the I think they're opening up orders for the like just anyone on Wednesday of this week which would be the 16 something was at 16.

[01:11:16] Yes yeah so they're opening up orders for them and then I guess I think you can just send a message to kt it's spooky people that.

[01:11:25] The letter k and letter t.

[01:11:28] Alright well Scott this is definitely where we're coming up on the hour this is definitely been in exciting I know experience for you and it's an exciting day with the order banks opening up and I talk to a lot of people and.

[01:11:43] Everyone I talk to has nothing but you know just positive things to say about you and are happy to see your game come to fruition and to be out there I mean it's got to be fun knowing that your product will be in collections for decades and maybe who knows got like maybe 20 years from now people will be spending 50 grand because.

[01:12:03] There's 210 is out there and that's it versus like thousands of star wars machines out there.

[01:12:10] I hope not man.

[01:12:14] No no no no we're all going to be playing virtual reality I keep saying people don't understand what's coming to tech wise it's like this is the last error of pinball it really is like we're going to have a good like another 10 years maybe hopefully but man you you seen VR and it's just like.

[01:12:31] Oh yeah I played my buddies HTC vibe the other day and that was the craziest thing I've ever done it's insane like kids growing up these days they're not even going to you know it's kind of like in back to the future to where he plays the light game and the kids like like you have to use your hands like what you do and like it's going to be like that well Scott anything else before we sort of wrap up here anything you want to say to the.

[01:12:56] The loyal listeners of the greatest people podcast no but thank you for listening to my ramblings alright well Scott it's always a pleasure we hope to have you on again soon as as game start to go location and games ship it be great to have you come back on.

[01:13:12] As you hear more feedback on t-na but everyone out there I think you know Scott's an amazing dude and we're just really happy to see your game out in the world and it's just another option that people have when they want to go buy a fun pinball machine that's not the typical cookie cutter approach the pinball.

[01:13:30] Thank you very much man I really appreciate it anytime I have a great night.

[01:13:35] I'll see you too.

[01:13:36] See ya.

[01:14:05] you
