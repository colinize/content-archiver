[00:00] I spent all my money drinking on my own, yeah.

[00:06] In this bar just sat here staring at my phone.

[00:11] And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?

[00:16] I know I'm proud, but I've left one too many.

[00:20] Come take me home.

[00:22] Cedars, cedars, cedars, cedars, cedars, cedars, cedars.

[00:27] Aw, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:30] Make sure you get your Twippy votes in, Favorite Pinball Podcaster,

[00:34] Favorite Pinball Content Creator, and no, not eligible for the Favorite Pinball Community Member.

[00:40] Okay everybody, we've made it through another week in Pinball.

[00:44] The reviews coming in from D&D are very good.

[00:49] I've been reading some mixed stuff on the pinside thread,

[00:52] but pinside will do what pinside does.

[00:56] A lot of opinions in a blender by 50 people, 30 of which are not going to buy the game,

[01:03] and you have to sort of weed through it all to know where the overall feeling is on the game.

[01:10] But overall, a lot of positive feedback on this game.

[01:14] I want to talk about whether or not you should buy the pro or the premium of the game.

[01:20] I think the LE buy is absolutely stupid.

[01:23] You're going to lose $3,000 on that cardboard box right away, and the LE is not even that nice.

[01:30] Let's face it, you're going to be able to make the premium nicer than the LE,

[01:34] and no one's ever going to really want the LE, so that's just my two cents on that part of the game.

[01:39] And then we're going to talk about this Alice in Wonderland Kickstarter that just popped up.

[01:45] I can't wait to read this for each and every one of you.

[01:48] This is the most anane thing I've seen in a long time.

[01:52] No common sense.

[01:54] Hire someone like Kaneda, guys, and you won't put out something like this.

[01:58] We're going to talk about Josh Sharp thinks it's funny that it took CGC two years to get you your bad mofo editions of what?

[02:07] Pulp Fiction? Why is that a funny thing, Josh?

[02:10] Aren't you like a marketing and sales dude?

[02:12] Like, you revealed the game, you locked in everybody's money, and you basically took two years to put a topper on a game.

[02:20] Why did that take so long, and what's wrong with you guys?

[02:24] And if you think that hasn't damaged your brand, you're dead wrong.

[02:28] Alright, what else are we going to talk about?

[02:29] I'm going to read for you some of the feedback I got about how I could make my pinball content better.

[02:36] Right? The world's number one favorite pinball podcaster.

[02:39] I do a stream every week. It's really unedited, just right from my brain into your ears.

[02:45] But I wanted to hear how I can make the show better and give you guys my response to some of your feedback.

[02:51] How does that sound?

[02:52] So where should we start on this show?

[02:54] So I asked you guys, let's start out with some of your feedback.

[02:57] So I asked you about D&D and to email me at canadapinball.com.

[03:03] And I think I got three responses.

[03:05] Let me read them right now.

[03:06] So James Garassa said, I think D&D Pro is the best value we've seen in the past few years.

[03:14] I believe that Stern knows perfectly well that the premium is not going to sell.

[03:19] I can't think of any pro that loses less from the premium than does this game.

[03:25] Look at the comparison to Jurassic Park, which essentially uses the same main feature.

[03:31] So he basically breaks down that Jurassic Park Pro was $1,600 less than the premium.

[03:36] And D&D Pro is $2,700 less than the premium.

[03:41] Well, that's true now of every single game.

[03:43] And the main feature on Jurassic Park, the T-Rex does not move on the pro.

[03:49] In D&D, the dragon moves on the pro.

[03:52] But here's the thing, James. That dragon doesn't really move.

[03:57] There's just a coil attached to it that makes it spring up and down.

[04:01] It's pretty bad, bro.

[04:03] We're going to talk about that next.

[04:05] And then he writes, the secondary feature removed.

[04:07] Jurassic Park, the raptor pit, extra up post, drop target and lunging raptor are removed.

[04:13] D&D, the trap door.

[04:15] Yes, I would say that Jurassic Park loses more.

[04:17] The trap door does not seem like a lot of fun to hit.

[04:20] Even talking to people who played the game, they basically said the trap door is kind of meaningless.

[04:26] It doesn't attach to a subway.

[04:28] It doesn't create any moment of wow in pinball.

[04:31] I think it was a big missed opportunity that when you go in that dungeon, depending on which way you go,

[04:37] the ball doesn't exit somewhere differently.

[04:40] I think that was a major miss in the design of this game.

[04:43] All right, then other features removed.

[04:45] Jurassic Park removes the helicopter blades and the upgraded pop bumper caps.

[04:50] And D&D, the sidehand guardrail extension.

[04:54] All right, well, look, James, here's the thing.

[04:56] Is the pro of D&D a great value game?

[05:00] Absolutely.

[05:01] I'm going to go back to this in a minute.

[05:03] Let me read two more people's comments on the game.

[05:05] Then I want to talk about whether or not the pro is the way to go on D&D.

[05:11] So Miles Short said, hey, Chris, my thoughts on whether D&D will be a success are below.

[05:17] Man, everybody always writes so much.

[05:19] Everybody's got to learn how to get a little bit more concise.

[05:21] He goes on to say, I think it depends on how you measure it.

[05:24] I don't think it will be a huge seller considering all the competition this year.

[05:29] Kong and Harry Potter and some of the rumored remastered and Goonies.

[05:34] D&D also has an aura of ultra nerdiness that some just can't get past.

[05:40] However, I think it's already a success to some degree.

[05:44] It shows us Stern is still trying.

[05:46] It shows us some of the love, creativity and passion of Brian and Dwight.

[05:50] It shows us some unique gameplay, elements and toys.

[05:54] It shows us that they can make a new game in a new factory and have it be developed

[05:59] and put together properly.

[06:01] Assumptions that this one will be delivered soon in play as well as a few others out in the world.

[06:06] I'm not going to read everything Miles says.

[06:08] I enjoy the show so much.

[06:10] So I doubled my paid amount.

[06:12] Thank you so much, Miles.

[06:13] I really appreciate that.

[06:15] He said, I definitely get my money's worth.

[06:18] So Miles, I 100% agree with you.

[06:20] I think this game has been a success for Stern on a lot of levels.

[06:24] I think it's exceeded people's expectations.

[06:26] I think the creativity and passion is oozing when they talk about this game.

[06:31] I didn't feel that way when they talked about Venom at all.

[06:34] I didn't feel that way when Stern talked about John Wick at all.

[06:38] I kind of felt it when they talked about Jaws, but not as much as this game.

[06:44] This game feels like they achieved what they wanted to.

[06:48] Nothing major was yanked out of the game.

[06:51] I think the thing that got yanked out of the game, I think the dragon was supposed to have wings that flapped as well.

[06:58] I think they removed that and replaced it with the cave.

[07:01] I totally agree.

[07:02] Now, will the quality be there?

[07:04] We don't know yet if there might be an issue with this game the way there is with X-Men.

[07:08] And you know, the game's coming out of the new Stern factory.

[07:12] Haven't really been the best quality experience for the pinball buying base.

[07:17] So we will see what happens when we actually get production models of the game out there.

[07:22] But yeah, overall, overall, I think this game is going to convert people even though it's a very nerdy theme.

[07:29] And even though it goes very deep into D&D.

[07:32] Alright, last one.

[07:33] Kelly Daniel said, love the game.

[07:35] Don't think it's a take my money now license.

[07:38] Sales will be moderate.

[07:40] I bought in LE, but I run in arcade.

[07:43] Most folks are out of room and money and not able to sell their older games for what they want to get.

[07:50] Also, King Kong on the horizon and that is much more suitable to the pinball demographic.

[07:56] Great job by Stern adding more mechs and deeper software, but better themes will make their factory busier and more profitable.

[08:04] Die hard, take my money now.

[08:06] Okay, I think he means the die hard theme.

[08:08] Kelly absolutely each and every one of us would buy die hard if we could.

[08:13] Alright, so overall, right?

[08:14] Overall, I think everybody is impressed by the game and I know people are talking about a few things around this game,

[08:21] but the major conversation is which model.

[08:24] And remember the pro version of this game is half the price of the LE version of the game.

[08:30] Right away, that to me makes the LE stupid.

[08:33] You really, really, really have to be stupid to think you're getting twice as much game in the LE.

[08:39] I don't even like the LE artwork.

[08:41] I don't like the armor that much.

[08:42] I don't like anything really about the LE.

[08:45] I like the artwork better on the premium.

[08:47] I think you're going to be able to make your premium look even better easily than you can with the LE of the machine.

[08:54] So like right away, I think the LE buyers are going to lose the most amount of money.

[08:58] Now, the real decision happening in your head right now should be between the pro and the premium.

[09:04] And I'm just going to say this.

[09:05] I get all the feedback.

[09:06] I get what everybody is saying, but you have to be out of your mind not to buy the premium.

[09:13] This is one of the coolest mechs Stern has ever made.

[09:16] It's hands down, stop the conversation right there.

[09:19] This mech is amazing.

[09:21] How could you have this game and play this game and not have that dragon mech working

[09:27] the way it was engineered to work?

[09:29] I could not own a game knowing that there's a version of it where this main mech.

[09:34] This is the main toy.

[09:35] And not only that people, this is one of the best toys Stern has ever made.

[09:39] And you're not going to want it in full working form.

[09:42] That is idiotic.

[09:44] I don't care.

[09:45] It's worth the money.

[09:46] It is worth the money to get the premium.

[09:50] And then you get everything else, right?

[09:51] There's nothing happening in the LE that you're not getting in the premium.

[09:54] And so I think if there was one game where I know it, I know it, like I know visually it looks like the pro is the way to go.

[10:02] But the problem is there's so much in this mech.

[10:06] That's just so much cooler.

[10:08] Like in Jurassic Park, the T-Rex doesn't really block the ball or three pathways the way this dragon does.

[10:15] And the way this dragon moves, it just adds so much to the experience.

[10:19] And the way the dragon is in the pro is just so silly.

[10:22] Now look, I know for some of you, that doesn't matter, right?

[10:25] If you just want the gameplay and you want all the fun of the modes and all the software, then yeah, absolutely the pro is the way to go.

[10:33] But I'm the kind of guy that wants to have all the bells and whistles doing what the bells and whistles were designed to do.

[10:41] Now, I've been seeing a lot of feedback in the thread about the dragon and how in D&D, this is interesting, in D&D, the dragons are evil.

[10:51] Like they are the enemy.

[10:53] They're not supposed to be humorous.

[10:55] They're not like Smog in Hobbit.

[10:58] They're not supposed to be talking to you with a little sarcasm.

[11:02] And I think that's turning off some of the die-hard D&D fanatics, because this is not what it's supposed to feel like when you encounter a dragon battle.

[11:13] So there's some people asking for more call-outs that make this game more serious and a little bit more intense.

[11:21] My feedback to those nerds is get over yourselves. Who cares, man?

[11:26] Look, this game would be more fun to me if the damn dragon started singing Kata and I Joe in the middle of a mode.

[11:31] I don't really care. Like, oh, Michael Dorn has to be serious. And we know he can be.

[11:36] You know what? Come on, gang.

[11:37] It's a pinball machine.

[11:39] Now, what I do think is silly about the dragon is when Michael Dorn is talking and the dragon is talking at us,

[11:46] I don't think Dorn has coded it in a way where it feels like the dragon is speaking.

[11:52] And I still think that's a huge miss.

[11:54] I do. I think when you go over and play the Hobbit, it's really going to feel even better now,

[12:00] even though it doesn't interact with the ball, but Smog talking to you is absolutely awesome.

[12:07] It just looks kind of crappy the way the dragon just kind of randomly lights up.

[12:11] And I don't even think the dragon is lighting up with the words.

[12:15] And I don't even know how you make that work because that's not really how we connect a spoken word with a dragon's head with just lights.

[12:24] Like, you kind of need to see some movement.

[12:26] All right. So D&D, we will see what happens. We will see how the sales go.

[12:30] I heard that this game is selling kind of a little bit below Jaws.

[12:34] It's selling better than John Wick. Everything has.

[12:37] It's selling better than Venom. Everything has.

[12:40] And it's selling better than X-Men.

[12:42] So not surprised, but again, the stern games of late have been sort of really bad sellers.

[12:49] And it's obvious that they're selling mostly pros and premiums because the LEs are still available.

[12:56] And you know, this was a hotter theme.

[12:58] Those 740 LEs would have been taken by now.

[13:03] All right. So remember when Wonderland Amusements announced that they were making an Alice in Wonderland game

[13:10] and announced that like after Melvin brought the DPX game to market.

[13:15] Now it turns out that these guys are doing the biggest mistake you could possibly do in the history of Pinball.

[13:23] And that is expect people to invest in your company before you've made the game.

[13:28] They've launched a Kickstarter.

[13:30] I mean, I don't even have to go on. It's over. It's already over.

[13:33] Nobody is going to invest in a Kickstarter around a Pinball machine.

[13:39] It has been tried. It has failed every single time and it's never going to work.

[13:45] But let me read for you how they think they're going to cajole people into supporting this project.

[13:52] And they write at Wonderland Amusements,

[13:55] Our goal is simple to make real mechanical Pinball accessible for everyone.

[14:01] Affordable, compact and full of fun.

[14:04] Okay. You could stop right there.

[14:06] Everybody needs affordable housing. Everybody needs affordable food.

[14:11] Everybody needs affordable transportation in life. Right.

[14:15] Affordable health care.

[14:16] Those are the things that we need affordable versions of.

[14:21] What the world doesn't need are affordable versions of Pinball,

[14:27] especially compact versions of Pinball, which is like a kitty size version of the game.

[14:34] They go on to say real mechanical Pinball is an unmatched sensory experience,

[14:41] a perfect blend of skill, strategy and gravity that no virtual table can truly replicate.

[14:48] Well, I don't disagree with that. Let's go on.

[14:51] This is the part that makes me laugh so hard.

[14:53] They write, while companies like Stern and American Pinball have revitalized the hobby with exciting commercial tables.

[15:02] Okay. Let's stop right there.

[15:04] You're going to pick two companies to highlight as the companies that have revitalized the hobby.

[15:11] You pick Stern. Absolutely.

[15:13] The second company you picked is American Pinball.

[15:17] Are you freaking kidding me? Would you give these guys a dollar?

[15:21] If they think that the company next to Stern that helped revitalize the hobby was American Freakin' Pinball?

[15:27] It just goes to show you these guys have no clue what they are doing and what they are saying.

[15:35] I don't care where they come from. I don't care what their backgrounds are.

[15:40] I don't care what they've done in a previous business venture.

[15:43] You put American Pinball into the description of a company that revitalized Pinball.

[15:49] It sends a signal to everybody, you don't know what you're talking about.

[15:53] They then go on to say, there are $5,000 to $15,000 price tags.

[15:57] Put them out of reach for most home enthusiasts.

[16:01] Okay. You've done no market research.

[16:03] I don't even know. What does that mean? Home enthusiasts?

[16:05] What does that even mean? Do you mean game enthusiasts?

[16:08] What's a home enthusiast?

[16:10] Do you mean someone who just really loves the home or someone who has a home who's what?

[16:14] Are they a pinball enthusiast?

[16:16] See, this is what makes no sense.

[16:18] I love this because we have to stay on this because they have done no market research.

[16:22] If you love pinball and you want a pinball machine in your home,

[16:26] there's absolutely nothing keeping you from putting a pinball machine in your home.

[16:31] There's nothing. You can get a game for $500.

[16:34] You can get a game for $2,000.

[16:36] If you want to go buy a brand new and box game from American Pinball or Stern,

[16:41] you can go buy so many games that are still in working order for much less money.

[16:47] And this is the problem.

[16:48] They are now positioning themselves as a company that is a solution in search of a problem

[16:55] because there is no problem.

[16:57] There is nobody that's a home pinball enthusiast who's just been priced out of the hobby.

[17:02] No, you might be priced out of the expensive new and box stuff,

[17:06] but all those people know that there's thousands of games out there

[17:11] that they can buy for much less money than $5,000 to $15,000.

[17:16] Okay, but then they go on to say,

[17:18] that's where Wonderland Amusements comes in,

[17:21] founded by the creative team behind the Arcade OneUp line.

[17:25] We're reimagining pinball for the home with high quality, affordable machines.

[17:31] And they have some pictures of Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[17:34] Our first table, Alice Goes to Wonderland,

[17:37] combines the whimsy of Lewis Carroll's classic story with modern design and engineering,

[17:43] sized at 80% of a full machine and with a target price under $1,000.

[17:50] It is designed to make real pinball accessible to everybody.

[17:54] What is this even going to be?

[17:56] How are you going to do anything that's a good pinball experience for under $1,000?

[18:03] It just doesn't even make sense.

[18:05] It really doesn't.

[18:07] I mean, look, I get what they're going for.

[18:09] I do.

[18:10] Like they made smaller versions of all the classic arcade games,

[18:14] and they were successful doing that.

[18:16] But what these guys are missing is that when you shrink down,

[18:20] for example, Tron or Street Fighter,

[18:23] you can still put, I know you don't have a CRT monitor,

[18:27] but you can still put the exact game everybody remembers on the screen.

[18:32] Right?

[18:33] Nothing about the game itself has had to have been altered to make a smaller version of it.

[18:40] When you make a smaller pinball machine for under $1,000,

[18:45] what have you now made?

[18:47] You've made a crappy pinball machine.

[18:50] It's not a smaller version of Twilight Zone.

[18:53] It's not a smaller version of the Addams family.

[18:56] You've just made a compact pinball machine that nobody will have any emotional desire to play.

[19:03] So it's just going to be like a really expensive kids toy that they want to sell to adults.

[19:09] Again, I don't think there's a market for this.

[19:11] We will see.

[19:12] The market will determine this.

[19:13] And then they write,

[19:14] Love pinball and always wished you could find an affordable machine that would actually fit in your home.

[19:20] Look no further.

[19:22] Please click the notify on launch button to receive an email when our campaign goes live and help us make Alice Goes to Wonderland Home Pinball Machine a reality.

[19:33] Gang, why?

[19:35] Why?

[19:36] Why should we have to fund this thing?

[19:38] I don't get it.

[19:39] Did people fund Arcade 1 up?

[19:40] I don't think so.

[19:41] I just don't think this is going to work.

[19:44] I don't think they're going to get funding.

[19:46] And again, I think it's a solution in search of a problem.

[19:49] Nobody's like, oh man, I can't find a pinball machine to fit into my home.

[19:52] Who are those people?

[19:53] Those people do not exist.

[19:55] And if you love pinball, then you want pinball done right.

[19:57] And this is going to be neither.

[19:59] All right.

[20:00] Before I get to your feedback, just real quick, look, real quick, Josh Sharp.

[20:03] Look, it's not funny, man.

[20:04] It's not funny that you guys did this reveal two years ago.

[20:08] You went radio silent for almost an entire year.

[20:11] Your company has been terrible in all of its marketing around this game.

[20:15] And so, yeah, I canceled my pre-order deposit on the game.

[20:19] I know other people have as well.

[20:21] If you were happy waiting two years to get your Pulp Fiction, that's great.

[20:25] I don't care.

[20:26] I still think as a sales and marketing guy, Josh Sharp should not find it funny that this company absolutely has destroyed a lot of people's excitement around the brand.

[20:37] And yeah, I get play mechanics, isn't CGC.

[20:40] I get it.

[20:41] But Josh, you're going to now have to go sell people on Halo Pinball.

[20:45] And they're not going to forget how long it took to get the Pulp Fiction.

[20:48] And you don't think that's going to bite you in the Halo ass?

[20:51] It is.

[20:52] And guess what, Josh?

[20:53] We don't want Halo.

[20:54] So dead on arrival with that game.

[20:56] All right.

[20:57] So let's go on.

[20:58] So I asked people, what could I do better as a pinball content creator?

[21:02] Right.

[21:03] It's only about like, I don't know, 100 or so people that actually know what it takes to make pinball content on a weekly basis.

[21:11] And they understand the challenges, but I'm always up for feedback because I always want to make the show better.

[21:17] And I just want to grow as an individual.

[21:19] So here are some of the things that people said.

[21:21] Chris Smith said, for me, I think it's great that you call out issues with games and companies.

[21:26] In fact, several improvements have been implemented as a result.

[21:30] I think at times you beat a dead horse to a pulp.

[21:33] Not going to lie, Chris.

[21:34] Hell yeah.

[21:35] Maybe branch out a little bit.

[21:37] I think he wants more interviews, special interest stories in the community.

[21:41] Oh, and stop bashing people about the placement of pinball machines.

[21:46] Sometimes we work with what we got.

[21:48] Oh, Chris, thank you for the feedback.

[21:50] And look gang, I love making fun of pins in front of windows.

[21:54] I know myself has a little bit of a pin window problem going on upstairs.

[21:58] It's just funny.

[22:00] Like we got to learn to take the piss out of things in this hobby.

[22:03] All right.

[22:04] I'm not like bashing people mean spirit it.

[22:06] It's just funny to call out how some of you out there, though, have horrible taste.

[22:11] Maybe I am bashing you.

[22:12] Some of you have like the worst taste ever in how you lay out your game rooms.

[22:17] And hey, just like the feedback you're giving me, I think my feedback to some of those game rooms is valuable.

[22:24] And most of you, I know your wives are not happy walking into a room and there's a bunch of neon signs with wires everywhere.

[22:32] And there's pins in front of windows.

[22:34] It doesn't look good.

[22:35] You shouldn't block artwork with the back box of your machines.

[22:38] It doesn't look good.

[22:40] All right.

[22:41] Paul Rubin said you could figure out how to get an old pinballer who doesn't know what a podcast is in the first place.

[22:48] Otherwise, listen to your audience on forwarding the pinball ethic.

[22:53] I'm not going to be long and prosper.

[22:55] Paul, I have no idea what you just said there, brother.

[22:58] I mean it.

[22:59] I have no idea what that means.

[23:00] Christian said talk more about what's happening on pin side.

[23:04] I mean new topics and interesting new contributions as you sometimes mention.

[23:09] Yeah, Christian, I think I do a good job of scrubbing pin side for what's happening with all the new games and the other things happening in the hobby.

[23:17] The stuff that I've shied away from, like, I just don't care.

[23:21] You know, are these new toppers or these new accessories?

[23:24] Like, I don't really care about that stuff anymore.

[23:26] I do read pin side a lot and a lot of my opinions or sort of show topics are formed by what I'm reading on pin side.

[23:35] So for example, like with D&D, I'm reading what people's feedback on the game is.

[23:40] It's not just my own opinions about the game.

[23:42] I'm also sharing a lot of the point of view of the community that happens there.

[23:46] Jeremy Streak Strecker wrote,

[23:49] You put on a good podcast and you should get paid for what you do.

[23:53] That I agree on.

[23:55] The persistent badgering on who has the most money, biggest game rooms and how much they should be contributing, yada, yada, yada, is a complete turn off.

[24:05] Well, Jeremy, first and foremost, do I badger on who has the most money?

[24:11] No, I think I maybe make fun of Neil McCrae and like Bill Brandis and all their millions.

[24:15] That's about it.

[24:17] And I don't really ever talk about whoever has a bigger game room has a bigger, you know what, like I never bring up that.

[24:25] Now look, every once in a while, Jeremy, I will ask people, you know, if they could and they like what they get, if they could up the ante, that would be great.

[24:34] That would be much appreciated.

[24:35] He goes on the right this, no matter how good the episode is, when you get on the topic or go full doctor fill on us, I turn it off.

[24:44] I'm not here for that.

[24:46] I'll 100% admit that I'm a $5 subscriber.

[24:50] I'll also admit that I pay way more for way less on other Patreons because they get me there on my own.

[24:58] Okay, so Jeremy, let me get this straight.

[25:00] I didn't get you there on your own.

[25:02] So I had to ask to get you there and you're not going to get there because I didn't get you there on your own.

[25:07] Is this clear?

[25:08] So you're giving other pinball, maybe pinball, Patreon, maybe other people, more than Canada.

[25:13] Even though Canada gives you way more because I ask people if they can up their ante to do it and that turns you off.

[25:21] Like get there on your own.

[25:22] Okay.

[25:23] All right, so let's just to summarize.

[25:24] Jeremy didn't get there on his own.

[25:26] He'll never get there on his own because I asked him to get there and because I asked him to get there, he won't get there on his own.

[25:31] All right, Jeremy, I hope on a future episode, I can give you a big shout out for being a member of the Raise the Roof Club.

[25:39] So Jeremy, we're all looking at you now, all 720 of us.

[25:42] Will Jeremy Streak Strecker, will he join the Raise the Roof Club and will he be able to get there on his own now?

[25:51] Jeremy, I hope you can.

[25:52] This name is going to be fun.

[25:54] Streckham Burger Romaine?

[25:56] Did I get that right?

[25:58] I love listening to you in the car.

[26:00] Thank you for your work.

[26:01] Maybe sometimes focus a little less on just the news and a little more on the gameplay or anecdotes from the world of pinball because sometimes it's a bit of a repetition.

[26:13] But congratulations and continue.

[26:16] Thank you so much for that feedback.

[26:18] I'm going to read more because I think more people have mentioned gameplay, but we'll talk about it in a second.

[26:22] Mark Nellis, friend of the show.

[26:24] Mark says, turn up the volume on everything.

[26:27] Be a walking firework, more sparkles, more sequenced, more unapologetically chaotic broadcast energy.

[26:34] Lean into the chaos, rock outfits so flamboyant they make peacocks jealous.

[26:40] Your drunken Facebook lives are your art form.

[26:43] Give us the rants and the unexpected plot twists.

[26:47] All right, he goes on to say, this is your golden formula, unfiltered, outrageous and unbiased pinball content.

[26:53] Well, Mark, I will always deliver that.

[26:55] The drunken rants aren't really the way to do it.

[26:58] And I mean that because whenever I do it, I wake up and I don't like not exactly knowing what I said.

[27:06] And if I'm going to get drunk, I told this to Brenda, I'm never going to do it really on camera again.

[27:13] Unless it's under a highly controlled environment.

[27:16] I've learned a lot over the years.

[27:18] Let's just say that the amount of times I've been drunk and did anything pinball related.

[27:23] The amount of times I've regretted that behavior is about 90% of the time.

[27:28] I get it's enjoyable.

[27:29] I get it's entertaining for you, but it doesn't make me wake up in a good mood.

[27:35] And you know me.

[27:36] I think you measure life by how many days you wake up in a good mood.

[27:39] All right, so this guy said, Joseph Palermo said, stop doing Saturday morning spectacular's spend the time with the family.

[27:47] Well, Joseph, thank you so much.

[27:49] And I think Joseph, you get it, right?

[27:51] There's a lot of time out of my family time that I take to do this show.

[27:57] That's hours I could be spending playing with Killian, watching Paw Patrol with him.

[28:02] And that's another reason why.

[28:04] And I mean it when I say this, Mr. Jeremy Strecker, soon to come do it on his own conclusion that maybe can ate is worth more than $5 a month.

[28:13] You know, there's a lot of time and energy that goes into this.

[28:15] And I really do appreciate those that do appreciate that and appreciate the time I'm taking away from family.

[28:21] But I'll tell you this though, I also have so much time with the family.

[28:24] Don't get me wrong.

[28:25] I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything, especially with more remote work.

[28:29] We spend more and more time with our family than we ever have before.

[28:33] I see them in the morning.

[28:34] I see them at night.

[28:35] A lot of times people didn't get that.

[28:37] I also see them all week and long.

[28:39] So trust me as a parent, you know this, like if you have kids my age, you know, you actually kind of look forward.

[28:44] To having a couple hours to yourself.

[28:47] And so this is a pretty good gig I got going because Brenda knows every Saturday from 10 to 1130.

[28:55] It's my time and every parent needs their time.

[28:58] Eric Jackson said more back to the future.

[29:01] I don't know anything more and back to the future.

[29:02] Eric, I don't think it's coming out this year.

[29:04] That's all I know.

[29:06] Chris Ward said and Chris Ward, what's up brother?

[29:09] I think Chris is on Patreon.

[29:10] Chris and I used to work together.

[29:11] Awesome guy.

[29:12] He said, try playing pinball sometimes.

[29:15] It's really fun.

[29:16] You know, Chris, I'm going to be honest with each and every one of you.

[29:19] I told this to Brenda a few years ago, so don't cancel on me now, people.

[29:23] I said, Brenda, I bet you I could go a whole year, not play a single game of pinball and still be voted the world's favorite pinball podcaster.

[29:32] I just did that as a challenge, right?

[29:34] I could be entertaining enough and know enough about what's going on in the hobby that without even plunging a single ball,

[29:42] I could win favorite pinball podcasters.

[29:44] Now, of course I play pinball, but yes, I'm going to play a lot more pinball.

[29:48] I hear this from people.

[29:49] I'm going to go to automate it more often and play games, especially when a new game comes out.

[29:54] I want to drive there.

[29:56] It's only 30 minutes away and it's a lot easier to get to than it was even for me to get to jack bar.

[30:02] It is.

[30:03] It's like a lot nicer to I can get in my car, in my pajamas, walk into my car, drive to automate it and get out.

[30:11] And be right there.

[30:12] If you know what it took to get from the sixth train to the L train, then I had to walk to jack bar.

[30:18] It wasn't much fun and then Uber's back were like $40.

[30:22] So I will be playing more pinball now than ever before.

[30:26] Zach I Hussain said, yell at somebody.

[30:29] Well, I think I do enough yelling on the show.

[30:31] Robert, I'm going to butcher your last name.

[30:33] Sikini Sikini.

[30:34] He wrote, it's just fine now as is.

[30:37] I agree, Robert.

[30:38] Perhaps get a distro as soon as new releases are available to spend a decent time on the game.

[30:43] Yep, that's going to be automated.

[30:45] You may need to go incognito and regular interviews.

[30:49] I think they work better when you have a private chat, take notes and then explain what you can discuss in the podcast.

[30:56] Yeah, I look, I want to do more interviews.

[30:58] The thing is, interviews are really time consuming.

[31:01] And when you talk about eating into time with family, those things really eat away at your personal time.

[31:09] Aaron Davis, what's up brother?

[31:11] Keep your word.

[31:12] Oh, Aaron's funny, you know, because I think Aaron, Aaron's funny.

[31:15] Aaron, I'm not going to out you.

[31:17] I'm not going to tell you what you told me that led you to say that.

[31:21] But yeah, you look, sometimes people tell me stuff and I say, I'm not going to say anything.

[31:26] I'm not going to say anything, but here's what usually happens.

[31:29] I hear it from a few other people and I get impatient and I want to be the one who has the scoop and then I reveal it to the world.

[31:37] And you know, so people feel like I burn them.

[31:40] Aaron, sorry brother, I will keep my word.

[31:43] I will keep my word next time.

[31:45] But remember people, none of this, all of these secrets in pinball are stupid.

[31:49] And some of these people have secrets on companies that aren't even the companies they're working for.

[31:54] And they still like act like they don't want the world to know who cares.

[31:58] We all know King Kong is coming.

[32:00] Harry Potter is coming.

[32:01] Goonies is coming.

[32:02] Beetlejuice is coming.

[32:03] We all know Aaron.

[32:05] Jason said more Todd Tucky.

[32:07] Absolutely.

[32:08] Charlie Martin said, tell us what you really think.

[32:11] I know he's joking.

[32:13] Javier said, don't talk S-H-I-T on Avatar.

[32:16] Avatar sucks.

[32:18] It sucks.

[32:20] It is one of the worst theme integrated pins I've ever played.

[32:24] The mute eclipse are stupid.

[32:26] There are no toys in the game.

[32:28] It is absolutely the worst $15,000 pinball machine, maybe of all time.

[32:35] But yeah, enjoy your topper.

[32:37] Look, I'm being a little facetious, but I'm not.

[32:39] How did they spend all that time making a game with no toys in it?

[32:45] Also, the movie kind of sucks.

[32:46] Like you don't even want to watch that movie again.

[32:48] All right, Craig Young said, it's always great when you focus on staying grounded and appreciating others.

[32:54] It helps build stronger connections with your audience.

[32:57] The heated disputes, although entertaining, are off-putting.

[33:02] But please keep calling out the outrageous pricing.

[33:05] Absolutely, Craig.

[33:06] Great feedback.

[33:07] Bruce Zamo says, wear a shirt that reads, I make good podcasts for pinball babies.

[33:13] And wait to see if any of your subscribers noticed.

[33:17] I should try that.

[33:18] Daniel Brennan said, stop being a prick.

[33:21] Oh man, Daniel.

[33:22] What side of the bed did you wake up on?

[33:24] Did I pee in your cornflakes this morning?

[33:26] Daniel, I'm sorry, brother.

[33:28] Well, you know, like, I don't think I'm really a prick.

[33:30] I think I'm pretty even keel.

[33:32] And if I ever am a prick, anyone who's on the receiving end, trust me, deserves it.

[33:38] Berto Moon said, arm wrestling challenge is live once a month.

[33:42] Loser plays winners game of choice for four hours straight.

[33:46] All right, sure.

[33:47] Why not?

[33:48] Dan Janssen said, teach us to live catch ball and drop catch the ball.

[33:52] Dan, I know how to do that.

[33:53] Okay, for those of you out there who think I suck at pinball and don't know how to do

[33:58] like live catches and post passes and all this stuff, I know how to play.

[34:02] I've put up decent points on GNR, albeit it's five ball and I've lowered the outlaying post.

[34:07] Oh, let's see.

[34:08] We've got Tony Agrusa said, he says, I walk a lot and pinball podcasts have been my go-to

[34:14] for years, including yours.

[34:16] The main thing that makes me cringe is when you get into what I call Chris's life lessons.

[34:22] When you launch into your log off pin side, go to the gym, pinball is all about the people,

[34:27] copy, paste, I tap out.

[34:29] Wow, it's weird, right?

[34:31] Why would that upset anybody that I'm just trying to give you a little bit of advice?

[34:37] And look, I'm not like going low on anybody.

[34:39] But yeah, Tony, like get to the gym.

[34:42] You should be doing as many push-ups as plunges and I would give that advice to everybody,

[34:46] but you walk a lot.

[34:48] Walking is not as good as weights and pull-ups.

[34:53] God, man, Canadian's life advice.

[34:55] See, I think some people like it, some people hate it.

[34:57] Hey, but here's the thing, I like it and I like having the freedom on my content to say how I feel about life

[35:03] and other things happening.

[35:05] I think that's what makes my show a little bit more interesting.

[35:07] It's not just this transactional content about pinball.

[35:10] Michael Brasda says, might be a bit more work, but sounds like you're brainstorming, so here are some random thoughts.

[35:17] The biggest issue I have on watching Pinball Podcast, it's normally an hour of ranting.

[35:23] What I would like to see is to break up segments of the cast, like the news does.

[35:28] Maybe like Pinball News segment, then maybe follow some tournaments, announce winners and highlights if you get them.

[35:35] Maybe this month in Pinball history, then maybe a quick tech talk.

[35:39] Okay, Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael, that's a lot of work.

[35:43] I'm one person.

[35:45] Do you know how a news program operates to have all those different segments?

[35:49] They've got multiple producers that are creating all the content that they then hand to the hosts and the talent to simply read the teleprompter

[36:00] and get through the sports, the news, the weather, the this, the that.

[36:05] So you want one man, which is me, to do all of that work.

[36:09] And guess what'll happen, Michael?

[36:11] If I do all that work, I won't get one more subscriber.

[36:14] It's not happening.

[36:16] Mark Henry wrote more Facebook Lives, more roasting, more merch, some giveaways.

[36:20] I stopped doing merch because again, like the juice wasn't worth the squeeze.

[36:24] Steve Masa said more content about gameplay, less about pricing.

[36:29] Here's the thing.

[36:30] I want to address this because the thing about gameplay,

[36:33] I am going to play more.

[36:35] I want to tell you the reality is a game gets revealed and how many of you get a chance to jump on a brand new game when the company asks you to buy the game?

[36:44] Almost nobody.

[36:45] Right.

[36:46] By the time the game actually makes its way into market and on location and now that Stern is making Ellie machines first,

[36:54] there's almost like a two month gap between the reveal of a game and the ability to actually play it.

[37:01] And then there's like a six month or more gap between a new game and the code actually being done or at a place where it's worth reviewing.

[37:13] And this is the problem is by the time all of that happens, the game becomes old news.

[37:21] And so the lion's share of the energy around any new game happens in a window in which most gameplay is not happening.

[37:31] It's the reason why it's a weird market, right?

[37:33] It's like nobody can take a game on a test drive before these companies want you to buy now.

[37:38] And my show predominantly is about discussing whether or not you should buy now, right?

[37:45] If we see enough good in the game, if we're excited enough about the game, if the theme is great,

[37:50] if the art's great, if the code looks good, all of that is what drives my show predominantly.

[37:56] Okay, so let's say by the time I jump on a game and talk gameplay, is anybody going to care?

[38:02] And also trust me on this, so many other pinball podcasts are so dialed in and so many YouTube content creators are so dialed in on gameplay.

[38:13] And yeah, you're definitely going to get that it's scratched by those individuals.

[38:18] You're not really coming to me for most of that.

[38:21] Now, what I want to do is do this.

[38:23] I do want to play games more and give you more gameplay feedback.

[38:27] But what I really want to look for in pinball machines is I want to look for those moments of wow.

[38:33] And that's sort of what excites me.

[38:35] I want to figure out if these games have those moments of wow.

[38:39] I want to jump on them, get to those moments and then communicate to you whether or not, you know,

[38:45] I think this game really crushes it in pinball gameplay and moments of wow.

[38:50] Cliff Albert sort of said the same thing, like get better at pinball.

[38:54] I'm actually not terrible, Cliff.

[38:56] I mean that.

[38:57] I just don't have enough time on a lot of machines.

[39:00] Okay, I'm going to read some of these at a later date because there's a lot more and I don't want this show to keep on going.

[39:05] But everybody look, happy Friday.

[39:07] I will read more of this feedback on another show.

[39:10] All good feedback.

[39:12] I take all of this seriously.

[39:14] I mean that.

[39:15] So everybody look, have a great weekend.

[39:17] Josh Sharp, you should be ashamed.

[39:19] It took two years to get a game to market.

[39:21] That's it.

[39:22] I don't think it's funny.

[39:23] DnD hype is real.

[39:25] I think premium is the way to go.

[39:27] I think pro you lose too much of one of the greatest Mechs Stern has ever made.

[39:32] I also still think though over the next few weeks, the hype is going to die down and we're going to start to think right.

[39:38] Like what else could be in Kong?

[39:41] What is spike three going to be?

[39:43] Because don't forget people DnD is not spike three.

[39:47] So there's going to be more muscle happening when Stern releases spike three Kong.

[39:54] I also think there's going to be a price increase.

[39:56] So we shall see everybody have a great Friday.

[39:59] We'll talk to you soon.

[40:02] Thank you.

[40:32] Thank you.
