[00:00] Some people call me Maurice.

[00:02] Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon.

[00:07] Welcome everybody, happy Sunday.

[00:09] It is Super Bowl Sunday.

[00:10] This is Canadian Pinball Podcast,

[00:12] and I'm gonna do what I do best.

[00:14] I'm gonna give you breaking exclusive news

[00:17] on something about to happen at Stern Pinball.

[00:20] You didn't hear this anywhere else.

[00:21] This has been a little bit of a rumor floating around,

[00:24] but I've got more details, more specifics.

[00:27] But first I wanna thank each and every one of you

[00:30] for not voting in this year's Twippy's.

[00:33] Did you see the numbers?

[00:35] I didn't really talk about it much

[00:36] after it happened last week,

[00:38] but let me just put it like this.

[00:40] The top 13 content creators combined

[00:44] only got 477 votes combined.

[00:49] Kari Hardy won the category with just 96 votes,

[00:53] and he made an acceptance speech with 96 votes,

[00:57] and I've been direct messaging Kari jabbing him.

[00:59] I mean, come on, at what point are we gonna get

[01:02] some pride people and not make acceptance speeches

[01:05] with just 96 votes?

[01:07] Just to put things in context,

[01:08] Canada got 664 first place votes last year.

[01:13] So you tell me everybody,

[01:15] did all that pinball positivity work out

[01:17] for Colin and Will and all those other content creators

[01:21] that slammed me for months, destroyed this award show,

[01:25] and this is what we're left with.

[01:27] Anyway, if they ever wanna get the Twippies back on track,

[01:30] they're gonna have to make Canada eligible.

[01:32] I really do feel bad for Jack Danger.

[01:35] He should have been up on stage in Texas,

[01:37] having everybody clap and celebrate his inaugural game,

[01:41] Foo Fighters, which was a tremendous pinball launch

[01:44] last year.

[01:45] All right, so what's going on, Chris?

[01:46] What's the news?

[01:47] Nobody cares about the Twippies, they're dead.

[01:50] Tell us to stir news.

[01:51] Now, before I get to it,

[01:53] we're also getting some breaking news

[01:55] from Naps Arcade, Jason Love Your Brother,

[01:57] and he said that American Pinball

[01:59] might be bringing its next title

[02:01] to Texas Pinball Festival.

[02:04] Well, of course they are.

[02:05] It's been a year since Galactic Tank Force tanked.

[02:08] Nobody's ordering that game,

[02:10] and we all know they're gonna march into Texas

[02:13] with their Berrio Food Truck Barbecue Inspire

[02:17] Dead On Arrival game.

[02:18] And I hear it might be a single level game.

[02:21] I'm not sure if that's gonna be true or not.

[02:23] Will it have any of those fancy,

[02:25] shmancy, deep root mechanisms

[02:28] that were in that food truck game?

[02:30] I'm not sure.

[02:30] There was like a soda fountain thing

[02:32] where those were like the targets,

[02:34] and I don't know what's going on with American Pinball,

[02:37] but I can tell you right now,

[02:39] after you hear this news,

[02:41] it's gonna get even harder to sell a Berrio game.

[02:45] All right, Canadians, shut up.

[02:46] Canadians, stop talking.

[02:47] What's the big breaking news?

[02:49] Okay, everybody.

[02:50] Are you ready?

[02:52] I have, from one of my best sources in all of Pinball,

[02:55] this guy's never been wrong.

[02:58] He is telling me the following.

[03:00] I'm gonna deliver it as a rumor,

[03:01] but man, this sounds like it's gonna happen.

[03:04] I am hearing Stern Pinball is about to transition

[03:07] from Spike II to Spike III.

[03:10] Now, it's not just better LCD imagery.

[03:13] You're also gonna get more computing power.

[03:15] Stern Pinball needs this, right?

[03:17] They don't have enough power

[03:18] to like light up their games with modern lighting.

[03:21] I think that's one of the reasons

[03:23] why we're not seeing a lot more mechanical stuff

[03:25] in Stern games,

[03:26] because I don't think their system right now

[03:28] can handle a lot of mechanical stuff.

[03:31] So that is good news.

[03:33] Now, here's what I'm hearing that gets very interesting.

[03:36] The game that they are going to launch Spike III with

[03:41] is going to be Metallica.

[03:44] Now, I'm not done.

[03:46] What I'm also hearing is this.

[03:48] This is not a remake of the old Metallica game

[03:52] by John Borg and Dirty Donnie and Lyman Sheets.

[03:56] This is going to be a brand new spanking Metallica machine

[04:01] with an all new design, an all new layout,

[04:05] all new code, all new animations,

[04:08] all new this, all new that.

[04:10] And so you are hearing it here first

[04:12] on Canada's Pinball Podcast

[04:14] that a new Metallica game

[04:16] is going to come out sometime soon.

[04:18] Maybe it's the next title or the title after the next game.

[04:22] If you're a betting man,

[04:23] I would bet this is the next game

[04:25] because Stern usually gets out a music pin a year.

[04:29] And I don't think Jack Danger's going to do another music pin

[04:32] and John Borg did the original Metallica.

[04:35] So maybe he's doing this new version of the game.

[04:38] And so this raises a lot of questions, right?

[04:42] Who's doing the art package?

[04:44] Who's designing the game?

[04:45] How much is this game going to cost?

[04:47] Well, that's the only thing we know.

[04:48] It's going to be expensive.

[04:50] All of these Stern machines are expensive

[04:52] and they weigh a hundred pounds less

[04:54] than Jersey Jack machines.

[04:56] They need to just put some dumbbells inside those games

[04:59] to make them feel as solid.

[05:01] So when I heard this news

[05:02] and I'm like, another Metallica, which is crazy, right?

[05:06] There's already out in the world,

[05:08] somewhere close to 5,000 to 6,000 Metallica machines

[05:13] when they made the game like over 10 years ago.

[05:16] And my first thought was if Stern releases a new Metallica

[05:21] and you know they've got to do illustrated artwork,

[05:23] I don't want to see the old band members

[05:26] up there with Photoshop, nobody does.

[05:28] Like Guns N' Roses was done right.

[05:30] They illustrated the band in skeleton format.

[05:33] So I think we're going to see something similar

[05:35] the way we saw the Dirty Donnie artwork.

[05:37] So we're going to get this new game out there.

[05:40] And then I was like, well, what happens

[05:41] to all of those old Metallica machines?

[05:45] Now, maybe you're happy

[05:46] because it's a new version of Metallica, right?

[05:49] I think for people who own an existing Metallica,

[05:52] what would have been more painful

[05:54] if they re-released the game you have

[05:56] with like new LCD screen stuff and new art packages,

[06:00] that would have made all of your games less desirable.

[06:04] So now that this is a totally new game,

[06:07] maybe this makes some of those Metallica owners feel better.

[06:10] Maybe you're going to own two Metallicas.

[06:12] Does anybody want two Metallicas in their lineup?

[06:15] Well, yeah, if you're a die-hard Metallica fan,

[06:18] I know Guns N' Roses fans who have both the dad

[06:20] at East Game and the Jersey Jack game,

[06:23] but man, oh, man, oh, man, right?

[06:24] In a world in which we want more original stuff

[06:27] we haven't seen before to go back

[06:30] to an older theme we've already had.

[06:32] And not just that, we have a great version

[06:34] of a Metallica pinball machine

[06:36] that is one of Stern's best games ever.

[06:38] It is one of Lyman's best games ever.

[06:41] It is one of John Borg's best games ever.

[06:43] And it is actually the pin that really showed Stern Pinball.

[06:46] If you do illustrated artwork,

[06:48] you can have a ton of success.

[06:50] So more Metallica's coming.

[06:52] Jaws Pinball, is it gonna keep selling well

[06:55] over the next few months?

[06:56] Elton John is out there.

[06:58] It's not selling very well.

[07:00] There's a lot happening in Pinball.

[07:03] And I really do believe this.

[07:05] Stern Pinball is gonna have the most difficult time

[07:08] with the size of the company.

[07:10] They need to make sure every launch they come out with

[07:13] has like thousands of people ready to absorb

[07:17] all of these games.

[07:18] And so we shall see more on this.

[07:20] And I think this is gonna be the game after Jaws,

[07:23] a new Metallica.

[07:25] This is just gonna be a short breaking news edition

[07:27] of Canada's Pinball podcast.

[07:29] I will be back this week with more shows,

[07:32] more to talk about, but now you can run the pin side.

[07:35] So let everybody know that Canada has informed you.

[07:38] There is a new Metallica coming, new design.

[07:42] It's a Spike Three system launch title.

[07:45] All right, just make sure when all the crybabies

[07:47] on pin side who don't wanna ever give me credit

[07:50] for giving you these scoops that nobody else

[07:52] is giving you, that it's spelled K-A-N-E-D-A.

[07:56] Happy Sunday everybody.

[07:58] Let's go Niners.

[07:59] I'm gonna root for the Niners.

[08:00] I just wanna see Taylor Swift lose something this year.

[08:04] Later.
